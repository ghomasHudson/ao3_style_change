“Ugh,” Draco said under his breath. He changed into a fresh set of pajamas, more easily this time now that Potter was out cold, and tentatively climbed into the cot. It was stiff, so different from the custom mattresses Draco had slept on all his life. He grimaced and shifted, trying to get comfortable, before placing his head on the pillow. He inhaled and the smell of Potter hit him like a freight train, overwhelming his senses and his surroundings. Draco was hard in seconds, and any desire he had previously had to get some sleep left him in a flash.
“That’s the best you’ve got? Really?” Harriet said, voice rising in volume. “Funny that you should say that, being as your friends are probably future murderers and--”
“Why’re you…” Harry began, trailing off when his eyes fell upon Draco’s exposed collarbone. “How come you came to find me?”
“This is Kingsley. Leave me a message.”
“I didn’t.”
“What, you think you’re better than me because you’re rich?” Harry scoffed. “Get out of my way, I have places to be.”
“Hello there,” The brunette said, placing a manicured hand on her hip. “May I ask why you’re wearing suits on the beach?”
Harry stopped at the shop of every familiar merchant he knew to be trustworthy (he only possessed a small amount of cash and would not allow himself to be gypped) and purchased what was needed as quickly as possible. This granted him more time to roam freely.  His bags were exceedingly heavy today, however, since he was carrying an extra load of laundry (courtesy of Dudley’s floor) so Harry decided that he would head home sooner than usual in fear of losing both of his arms. The thought of returning home so quickly had Harry feeling even more bitter than before, so naturally when he bumped head-on into a scrawny, blonde rich guy he didn’t think twice before shouting angrily at him.
Draco looked down, moving his wiry legs about and giving Harry a good kick to the shin. Harry sucked in a breath of pain but Draco failed to notice, too absorbed in his own failing attempts at kicking.
“S-Shut up, Potter, you--”
“Merlin, you’re hopeless. It’s his voicemail. He’ll hear the message when he sees that you left it. Push the red button now.”
Ron’s mouth dropped open. “What? Where do you sleep?”
“Hmm?” Harry asked slyly, tracing his fingers over the new, red marks peppering Draco’s porcelain neck. He added a few more, savoring every one of Draco’s breathy moans.
Harry heard Ron’s muffled “WHOOP!” at Draco’s words.
“U-Understand what?” She asked, confident tone faltering for a moment. Harriet reached out a gentle hand, and stroked her index finger along Draca’s shining bottom lip.
Potter mumbled something in his sleep and stirred slightly.
It was just past five AM when Harry arrived back at Grimmauld Place. He could have apparated if he had so desired, but his legs had needed a good stretching. Wordlessly and without a flick of his wand, Harry lit his fireplace. He plopped down onto his couch and sighed,  basking in the warm glow. His chest ached. Alone again. He considered owling Ron and Hermione but then thought better of it-- Harry wasn’t so sure his friends would take kindly to being woken up by a screeching bird in the wee hours of the morning. Before he had even taken his shoes off, Harry had dozed off. Through the windows, a strip of orange sunrise illuminated the clock on the wall. Six AM.
“I’ll see you after class, then. Bring your wand.”
“Yes,” Hermione shrugged, unfazed. “And we were what, twelve?”
“Erm,” Harry said stupidly before standing up a bit taller. “We’re part of the Serious Organized Crime Agency. Official business. Classified. Sorry, ladies.”
Draco just stared at Harry, eyes huge and lust-blown, and said nothing. Harry gaped and assumed that he must be dreaming; of course this wasn’t real, it couldn’t be real. He could not have been cursing at, insulting, and fucking around with the goddamn Prince this entire time. He couldn’t have.
“What--What is the matter with you?!”
Harry did as told, reluctantly. He always enjoyed watching Vernon cajole Dudley into obeying him.
He knew then that he had to tell his father that he had fallen in love with Harry Potter, the lowly servant.
“Absolutely not,” Draco replied with venom in his tone. “I’m taking the bed.”
Rather than shut Potter up, however, this just made him laugh harder. Draco watched in silence, somewhat transfixed. How could the bastard just stand there and laugh like that, after everything he had seen?  How could he just...continue to enjoy being alive? Potter wiped a tear away and cleaned his glasses.
“Sorry about that. I, uh, had a situation,” Harry said, nodding at Draco. Vernon didn’t appear to have even noticed the gesture or Draco’s existence, however. His chubby face was morphing into an ugly shade of angry, purplish-red and his beady eyes were glued upon Harry.
“Fantastic?” Ron said, eyes still wide. “Better than fantastic, I’d say. You can marry him and be filthy rich for the rest of your life.”
Harriet put her hands up in a surrender, stupidly giddy. She was sure, then, that she and Draca would get along fine from now on.
Potter raised an eyebrow and pushed the stack towards Draco. He began reading through the numerous autopsy reports as quickly as his exhausted brain would allow, hoping to confirm his suspicions. With each page, his pulse quickened. These Muggles had been tortured in an attempt to cause as much pain as possible before death. It was sickening, yes, but it went further than that. A darkness beyond what most could fathom. Sadism for Sadism’s sake. Something Draco had hoped he would never see again.
“In,” Draca panted, already past the point of forming coherent sentences. “Get inside me.”
“It’s not bad, Draco, you priss, just get in!” Harry shook his head, water droplets spraying about, and Draco was momentarily reminded of a wet dog.
And then Harry realized that Draco’s robes were a familiar shade of white, and suddenly he began to laugh. He laughed, and laughed, eyes clouded with tears, and when he took in the appalled look on Draco’s face, he only laughed harder.
“Er,” Harry replied stupidly, somewhat stunned. “S’alright. We’re almost there. But, er, thanks.”
“Come in, Mother,” Draco said with a deep sigh.
Harry swirled around and looked at Draco expectantly. “What?”
Draco tried and failed to obey, slipping on the slimy walls of the river and staring distastefully at the mud on his hands. Harry groaned, hoping he sounded repulsed at the idea of touching Draco’s bare skin again. Because frankly, he wasn’t.
Harry sighed in resignation. Fighting wasn’t worth it at this point. He’d assumed that he would be forbidden to attend, which is why he had worked out a rendezvous for Ron. Harry had doubts that he would even show up, so he prepared himself for the worst. The worst? Harry thought, grimly. Since when was the worst not being able to go to a horrid ball?
There was another beat of silence, and then Draco whispered something almost inaudibly. “Teach me, Potter.”
Draco straightened up, eyes widening. “An...apology? Pardon?”
“Know your damned place, you commoner.”
“Uhm, Harry, do you think someone slipped something into your drink?” Hermione asked, placing a smooth, dark hand on Harry’s forehead.
“They’re going left.”
“Not up to your standards I take it?” Potter asked with a sly grin.
Scorpio chose that moment to re-enter the kitchen and attach himself to his parents’ legs, squealing in delight. Harry laughed, removing himself from Draco, and pat his son on the head.
“Oh, you know,” Harry mumbled, taking in the clean scent of Draco’s soap. “I’m just thinking about how much you love it when I fuck you, even after all this time.”
Harry breathed out a sigh of relief. Ron didn’t mock him, didn’t seem to be looking down upon him, and Harry felt like flying.
The dim dungeon was suddenly doused in an electric red light, walls shaking and cracking in time with an invisible pulse. Harry, blissfully unaware of the ringing in his ears and the debris falling onto his body, merely sat with glazed eyes as the walls caved in. Metal bars keeping him from freedom shattered into hundreds of shards, and warm sunlight streamed down from gaping holes in the ceiling.
Draca trounced off, her usual grace returning, with Pan and Blaise following in her wake.
“Yes, Ronald, it’s spectacular. Can we go?”
“Oh, yeah. See you,” Harry waved stiffly and bent down to continue doing his laundry. He prayed for Draco to just go before things got out of hand, but he could still feel cold, grey eyes on his back.
Harry stepped out on his own, practically tripping in his bulky shoes in the process, and the three made their way over the daunting, wooden door of the castle. Two knights, completely still and quiet, held axes up to their chests. Harry paled; Ron, however, seemed very pleased to see them.
“That’s not--You can’t put it back in the dirt after you wash it. You’ve never done this before, have you?” Harry asked, deciding that maybe he should try to be a little more patient. He was making a rich nobleman wash clothes, after all.
“Come on,” Draco whined, pressing up against Harry desperately.
“Ah. Yes, of course,” Draco said, and Harry raised his eyebrows when Draco failed to respond with a witty retort of his own.  “Would you please put a shirt on?” Draco fussed with his own shirt collar, shifting awkwardly. “It’s...distracting.”
“Yes?”
After hours of drudgery, Harry finally finished the odious task. He had done a surprisingly decent job of it--Harry thought for a moment that maybe he should pursue a career in housekeeping. He shuddered at the mere prospect of it.
“I…” Harry’s voice broke, because it was impossible. They were impossible. Soon, they would be found, and Harry would be killed. And that would be the end of it. The end of everything. Harry knew that he should have at least been unsettled by that fact, but his aching chest wasn’t a result of his impending doom; it was all because of the willowy man in his arms. “Never-mind.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Blaise grumbled, shifting under the weight of her many textbooks. “Tell him to get me out of Herbology homework, too.”
Draco’s eyes widen at that, and Harry feels a pang of sorrow at the way his face pales. His thin eyebrows are drawn together, dark circles beneath his eyes, and Draco looks like he used to again. Before the war, before everything. His hollow cheeks, although more filled out and healthy, still shadow the tormented man he used to be. And at that moment, Draco looks so vulnerable, so afraid, that  Harry leans over and places a gentle kiss on his still lips.
Harry nodded and grabbed the huge stack. He looked at Malfoy, who was still desperately avoiding his gaze. “My office, or yours?”
“Fuck off and listen to me,” Potter said. Something about the genuine frustration in Potter’s tone did something to Draco, something sinful. Oh, right. He was supposed to be listening. “They’re going to attack Truro next. Or-or somewhere around there.”
“Er...I...You’re attracted to me?”
Draco gasped when Harry snaked an arm around his waiste. Harry chuckled at his eagerness, pulling him closer.
Draco pounded on the rickety door of Potter’s house and tapped his foot as he waited for a response. When no one greeted him, he knocked once again, Harry’s loafer in his left hand.
The knight, who was about to reply, suddenly whirled around at a thunderous voice:
Harry shrugged. “S’pose I stopped getting hungry years ago, but yeah, I could eat,” He said, looking around the room pointedly. “Don’t think you can transfigure food, and you obviously didn’t pack anything. Gonna pull a royal feast out of your ass?”
Draco was throwing himself quite the pity party as he sat at his mahogany desk mulling through his Potions homework once again. He’d gotten a short but pleasing flight in before his lessons, but somehow it didn’t seem to be helping clear away his inner turmoil like it usually did. Why Potter? Why did he have to be painfully attracted to him, of all people? For as long as he could remember, Draco had been able to get what he wanted with a swish of his hand and a curt request. But Harry? He couldn't have him, ever, and he felt like throwing a hissy fit. Unless, of course, his rather hopeless plan succeeded. (Which, Draco thought. It won’t.)
Hermione spun around and scowled at Harry’s loud entrance. He grimaced and mouthed “Sorry!” and that seemed to do the trick; her sharp features relaxed into a warm smile. Luckily, Ron was there as well, and Harry couldn’t help but wonder if he fancied Hermione. Why else would he come so often?
Draco tried to speak, but his voice failed him. Harry seemed to notice and  smiled down at him reassuringly, beauty wild and otherworldly. He tucked a strand of Draco’s disheveled hair behind his ear. Draco's breath caught in his throat because Harry’s eyes were impossibly soft and tender, full of...love?
An awkward silence fell upon them. The only sounds permeating the stillness were the soft croaking of frogs and the whispering current.
“I’d be glad to! Hermione, I can get you something too if you’d like!” Ron offered proudly.
“Don't you look at me like that, Draco,” Harry whispers against his mouth before he can protest. Harry can just barely feel the slight hitch of Draco’s breath beneath his thick sweater. “I am lucky to be with you. You're the best thing that’s ever happened to me.”
“Oh…” Draco mumbled, wide eyes locked on Harry’s newly-visible cock. “You’re...big.”
be sharing a room with Potter. No possible way. No chance in the fiery pits of hell--
Draco whimpered pathetically when he felt Harry’s clothed erection pushing against his own. His legs spread slightly as if on instinct and Harry groaned, burying his head in the crook of Draco’s slender neck.
“Hold on, he what?!” Harry’s voice came out hoarse.
Harry swallowed. Oh dear. “Are you that lazy? Seriously?”
“Places to be, hmm? Can’t I come with you?” Draca asked sweetly, wrapping a teasing arm around Harriet’s slim waist. After getting a good whiff of Draca’s flowery shampoo, Harriet raised her eyebrows.
“Shut up, you sap!”
“You wouldn’t want to impair your servant, would you? If you have him sleep outside and fail to feed him, his quality of work will decline. What if he falls ill and can no longer cook your meals? My family, unfortunately, has learned this the hard way. If you want to punish him, perhaps you should increase his workload.”
“NO-no-no, I definitely was not trying to kiss you, why would I even want to?!” Harry said, turning beet red, “I was trying to give you CPR since you neglected to mention that your noble arse can’t swim.”
“Hello there, and welcome to the Regulus Black Library! I’m Hermione, and you?” She thrust an eager hand towards Harry, who took a moment to shake it.
“Hermione! What are you doing here? You look...nice,” Harry said, in awe. She giggled, covering her mouth with a silk glove.
Harry knew for a fact that he had not lit it, because that would use too much wood and end in a one-sided feud between himself and Uncle Vernon. Could Dudley have...no, of course not, Harry thought. Dudley would never do something nice for me.
The other woman giggled and elbowed her friend just slightly. She nodded her pointed chin at Malfoy, who was looking her over with slightly narrow eyes. “Wicked! You’re an officer as well?”
“What do you need me to do? Haven’t seen enough to give you any pointers yet,” Harry said smugly as Draco scowled at him.
The Muggle woman’s face fell a bit. “Ah, it’s always the handsome ones isn’t it? Well, have a good day then.”
“Are you going to kiss me, Potter? Or does my royal blood and powerful magic intimidate you--”
Harry, flustered, uttered out a desperate “What?!” only to see that Ron and Hermione had gone on ahead, arm in arm. Traitors, Harry thought with a huff. He cursed under his breath, completely alone now, and stared at the scene before him. At least a hundred people, all dressed in absurdly flamboyant clothing, were dancing to a rather obnoxious symphony. No one had noticed him, at least not yet; he was obscured by the shadow of the silver awning above him. He waited for a few moments, allowing a three more royals to pass him, and then made his way down the staircase.
“Wonderful. We’re by a river though, yeah?”
“Bloke? Who says I like blokes?”
Harry scarcely remembered what decision she was referring to; something involving trade, perhaps?
“Draco,” Harry said over the crunching of their feet. “We’ve been walking for half an hour. Can you please tell me where we’re going? Or are you too ‘mysterious’ for that?”
“Ah,” Narcissa cut him off, voice gentle. Her eyes were unusually warm as she clasped her two thin hands together. “I see now.”
“Er,” Harry spoke for the first time, rather stupidly. “Your Highness. Where are we?”
“Are you blind? There’s her blood.”
Face flushing, Harry shook his head. “He’s not in love with me, Hermione. Why would he be?”
“Fuck off, Pansy!” Draco wailed, flinging one of his arms out dramatically and practically ripping Pansy’s pearl necklace off in the process. “This is serious!”
Harry thought with a snicker. “Whatever you say. Come here.”
“Wow, Ron!” Hermione said. “I think you might actually know what you’re talking about for once.”
“You...fine! Please!I need you to...please,” Draco said breathily, eyes flickering down to what he could see of Harry inside of him. Harry grinned devilishly and pulled out, agonizingly slow, only to decide that he’d made Draco suffer long enough.
Harry was still. He was in a daze as he watched parts of the granite ceiling fall in. Had he done this?
Draco exhaled. “Barbaric.”
“Yeah? Why’s that?”
“It’s settled then. I’ll be sure to invite only those of royal blood.”
When Harry awoke, it was strangely quiet. No bells, no booming demands. He realized sluggishly that it was still the middle of the night; the sun had not yet risen and the sky was a dewy, blackish grey. And then, he realized as he sat up, it was warm.
“Fucking hell,” Harry murmured. “Malfoy. Where can we find them?”
So Harry did. He found his favorite couch and took a seat after thumbing through various editions of fantasy stories. He settled on a collection of children’s tales and once again, despite their simple vocabulary, Harry found that he quite enjoyed them.
Hermione snorted and Harry couldn't help but smile despite the fact that he had just been notified of his impending doom.
Harry was startled awake in the dead of night by something akin to a gentle sob. He sat up and reached for his wand on instinct, only to set it back down when his tired mind processed what exactly he was hearing. Malfoy was...crying. Harry picked up his glasses, and squinted to see in the dark. A strip of moonlight illuminated Malfoy’s face, which was scrunched up. His cheeks were covered in fresh tear stains and his head thrashed back and forth, eyes still closed beneath wispy blond lashes.
“Is that how they treat you all the time?” Draco asked.
“HARRY!”
Why me? Was all Harry could think as the Prince allowed him to place his hands around his waist. He was lean, but toned; Harry could feel the warmth of skin through satin dress robes. Despite not being able to see his face, Harry had a feeling that the Prince was probably gorgeous (if his body and complexion were any indication).  Not as gorgeous as Draco, of course, but still gorgeous, Harry thought. He shuddered, suddenly realizing how sickeningly smitten he had become in the last few weeks.
And so they did. Harry stripped himself of his own shirt, failing to notice the way Draco’s eyes mirrored his own just a few moments before, and plunged into the frigid, clear water.
Ron bellowed something at the footmen and the three were off, horses clopping along at a steady pace. It didn’t take long for them to arrive at the castle. Harry was almost appalled at how unnecessarily large the building was. He’d expected something more classy, more delicate; but to Harry, the castle just looked like an extremely overbearing hunk of brick. The Royal Family’s crest, a bold ‘M’ surrounded by serpents, waved proudly from the highest tower of the castle. The amount of knights blocking the entrance was just excessive; there had to have been at least fifty of them. Harry wondered idly how much knights like Ron got paid.
Draco stuck a pristine foot into the river and grimaced. “Cold. It’s cold.”
“You--Shut up!” Draco spat, face continuing to redden. Harry huffed out a laugh.
“That’s enough, Ronda,” ‘Mione warned. Ronda, however, seemed not to hear him; she was laughing maniacally at her own joke.
“Not at all, Sir.” Harry said, eyeing Malfoy curiously. It had been five years since the War, so why did Malfoy’s face look like something crawled up his arse and died? Did he still see Harry as a rival even after all this time? Harry wouldn’t put it past him.
“No, Pansy, he hasn’t,” Draco sighed, “ He simply wishes to uphold the Malfoy family’s reputation which is entirely understandable.”
There we are, everyone, the final chapter of the main story!!! I can't believe it is (almost) done!
The guard was silent, only to reply reluctantly a moment later. “There’s been an explosion in the far right wing of the castle, Your Highness.”
Malfoy’s gaze was focused intently on his own shoes, and Harry noticed a sheen of sweat on his forehead. His right foot tapped rapidly against the carpet. His eyes were more sunken in than Harry had ever seen them; they were surrounded by purple circles that just made the man look miserable. Harry felt a twinge of pity. He nodded curtly at Malfoy, who would not meet his gaze in return.
Draca’s face was a bright shade of pink and she was blinking rapidly, leaving into Harriet’s touch but avoiding her gaze. “Shut...Shut up, Potter.”
“Ah! Sorry, sorry. Shouldn’t make assumptions!” The witch fumbled with her notebook, an embarrassed flush rising to her already ruddy cheeks. She flipped through the pages. “Let’s see here...oh, dear. I’m afraid we only have one room available at the moment. I truly do apologize! We can give you a cot for the floor.”
Pansy giggled like a schoolgirl, eyes suddenly twinkling with a youthfulness that Draco hadn’t seen for years.  “That was Hermione Granger. She’s a librarian’s assistant. She’s quite sexy, isn’t she?”
“You’re not going to the ball, boy, and that’s final!” Vernon shouted at Harry from the kitchen. Harry had tamed his hair as much as he could, and although he had failed miserably Vernon had still picked up on the change. When Harry told him that he was planning on attending, he had laughed in his face.
Harry cringed, groaned, and stood up. The wood floor was cold against the bottoms of his feet. He stood over Malfoy who was now actively kicking someone in his sleep. Harry thought back to the last time he’d seen Malfoy crying, many years ago, and how he’d practically killed him with that dark hex. Guilt and shame practically knocked the wind out of Harry as he stared down at the terrified man below him. Perhaps it was time to act.
“So how is it, working with Malfoy?” Ron’s nose wrinkled as he said Malfoy’s name. “Have you considered resigning yet?”
“I’m not surprised. Bet he can’t swim either,” Before Draco could blow up, however, Harry continued. “Dunno if I’ll make a very good teacher but I suppose it’s worth a try.”
Harry was immediately filled with a ridiculous sense of pride. “Look at you! You’re doing it!”
“You were. Well,” Draco cleared his throat and waved his hand rather stiffly, without any of the grace he usually possessed. “No matter. Let’s begin.”
Harry cut him off with a wet kiss and began finger-fucking him harder and quicker, brushing up against his prostate with every thrust.  Draco, keened, arching his back and pushing himself onto Harry's fingers.
This time, Harry went ahead and made the decision himself, reaching his hand behind the Prince’s head and pulling the lace bow apart before The Prince could protest.
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione smiled, placing a chilly hand on his cheek affectionately. “He’s already in love with you. Something tells me he won’t mind if you’re still in pajamas.”
Harry conjured up some lube and quickly inserted a finger into Draco, who moaned obscenely at the intrusion. He never seemed to be in pain, no matter how quickly Harry went; that, or he just didn’t mind it. After fingerfucking him shallowly for a few moments, Draco lost his will and began begging, chanting Harry’s name and pushing himself onto Harry’s finger.
“Malfoy,” She nodded curtly, eyes sweeping over the other witch’s body. “I’d appreciate it if you’d stop shitting on my friends.”
“Yeah. Yeah, of course I want to,” Harry said, voice more steady and sincere now. He walked over to Draco, who colored at Harry’s suddenly close proximity.
Draco shrugged and followed Potter up the rickety staircase. When Potter unlocked the door to room three, Draco was greeted by the scent of must and old wood.
(This is just for fun and it's not edited or anything, so sorry for any typos or grammatical errors!)
Harriet grinned wickedly, pushing Draca’s legs apart with a sudden force. Draca keened, pressing her hips upwards expectantly. Once Harriet finally found her intended target, Draca parted her legs, cheeks pink and chest heaving with quickened breaths. Harriet sighed dreamily at the sight; Draca was wearing white panties, with a dainty green bow and in the middle. Harriet ran her fingers across the front of them, and Draca gasped sharply. Harriet chuckled softly, brushing a sweaty strand of blond hair away from Draca’s pretty face.
“More,” Draco hissed, pushing back against Harry’s fingers. “Give me more, just fuck me already, just--”
“Hah!” Potter barked out one final laugh and then seemed to calm down. Draco rolled his eyes and secured himself under the covers of the bed. He silently thanked God for their clean scent. Before Draco could start to doze off, Potter began stripping right in front of him. Shamelessly. Draco’s eyes widened. He watched from behind as Potter took his clothes off and tossed them to the corner of the room until he was wearing nothing but a pair of boxers. Draco swallowed thickly, taking in the curve of Potter’s arse and the broadness of his shoulders. Shit. Potter seemed unaware of Draco’s ogling (thankfully) as he collapsed on top of the cot and let out a deep sigh.
“For the experience. Isn’t that what you said?”
“Someone knocked on the door and mum opened it. She practically passed out, Harry, I think it’s him! I’ve only met him once, but it’s gotta be, he has the blond hair!”
“Really? You’ll do it?” Draco asked, grey eyes flickering with something Harry might have labeled as eagerness. Harry smirked.
Harry pulled out for a moment, only to thrust back in with more force. Draco cried out, biting his own fist, and Harry grinned as a bead of sweat dripped down his forehead.
Draca’s fingers were unsteady, but Harriet was so far gone that they were doing the trick just fine. Harriet thrust her fingers deep into Draca, just how she knew she liked it, and Draca’s noises were music to her ears.
"Alright, alright. I’m awake.” Harry said, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes. The bell continued to chime as Harry sat up and dragged himself out of bed. “I’m coming!”
“Put it on!” Ron said.
“Well?” Potter’s voice ripped Draco from his own mind and he practically jumped out of his seat. Potter looked at him strangely. “You alright?”
“Bossy,” Harry stripped himself of his shirt absently, completely unaware of Draco's’ lingering gaze fixated on his broad chest. Harry shook his head when he noticed the color of his very basic T-shirt.
Draco was at a loss for words. Part of him was tempted to reply with sarcasm but he could tell from his father’s cold, empty stare that he was already unhappy with him. “No, Father.”
Draco, trembling now, allowed Harry to manhandle him onto the ground. Before he had time to whine about the condition of his clothes, Harry was on top of him, heavy and warm and strong and--
Potter scoffed. “Brilliant. Well, you’re in for a bit of a rude awakening then.”
“Well,” Harry said, “Thought it’d at least be worth a try.”
Harry flushed and cleared his throat awkwardly. He was definitely not excited to see this pansified nitwit without all those clothes on, definitely not. “Oh, you weren't ? I suppose you’re not as thick as you look, then.”
A small, almost inaudible whimper escaped the Prince’s lips at Harry’s words and his grip went lax. Harry took this opportunity to gently press the Pliant Prince against the wall. He was so delicate, so pristine, that Harry thought he might break him if he used anymore force. The Prince, however, almost demanded it, practically yanking Harry closer and placing his hands on his hipbones. Harry blinked quickly, trying to clear away the sudden heat pooling in his groin. The Prince was just so needy, Harry could probably make him beg if he wanted to, just like he had imagined he could do with Draco. The Prince was blond, too, and a similar height; so naturally Harry could not help but allow his thoughts to wander. And when the Prince allowed himself to be manhandled by Harry, it was almost too much; Harry granted himself the pleasure of abruptly slotting his thigh between the Prince’s legs and biting a kiss into his pale neck. The Prince moaned, allowing his voice to be heard for the first time during this encounter, and fuck, he even sounded like Draco. Part of Harry wanted the Prince to keep the mask on so that Harry could immerse himself in his own twisted imagination, but he knew that would only serve as fuel for his unwelcome desires.
Harry was still for a moment, eyes suddenly wide. “Oh, shit. I didn’t expect you to actually--shit.”
The next morning, Harry took care of his numerous chores and then headed to the library. He jumped from cobblestone to cobblestone, and this time decided to talk to Neville.
“Whatever you say, Your Highness,” Harry said, eyes glinting devilishly. There was something about making Draco flustered that turned him on to no end.
“Yeah. It’s, erm, good to see you?”
“Hah!” Draca snorted, crossing her arms. “More like another bullshit lesson conjured up by Dumbledore. I swear, that blood traitor has dementia or something.”
“Hello, Neville,” Harry said as he approached.
“My father is capable of anything,” Draca said proudly, pointed chin held high and glossy lips in a proud pout.
“Hey, s’alright, don't cry,” Harry said, uncharacteristically tender. He wiped away Draco’s sudden tears with his thumb. “I never thought I could be this happy, do you hear me? Thought I'd be stuck in that bloody hell hole until the day I die. But then you came along, you priss, and you made everything good again. Brought the color back.”
Pan snorted, clearly deeply amused by Draca’s antics (he’d always had quite the crush on her, after all) while Blaise leaned on a statue of some famous wizard, yawning and picking at her split ends.
Harry swallowed. It was one thing to come to terms with the fact, and another to vocalize it. “He’s the Prince.”
“Excuse me? Are you implying that our library is lacking in some way? I’ll have you know that we have every book on every topic possible, and it is no fault of ours that The King has refused to publish any of his speeches.”
“I do, actually. My husband is pretty uptight, so I suppose I should be getting home soon.”
Harry barked out a laugh and pat Neville on the shoulder. “None taken. Well, alright, I’d better be going. Hope the fish bite today. See you, Neville!”
“A commoner? So I’m not a filthy Squib anymore? What an upgrade!” Harry grinned slyly, unfazed by Draco’s insults. He took a seat on one of the armchairs, propping his feet up on the oaken coffee table, and stretched. Draco, who was glaring daggers into him, took a seat in the opposite chair.
<3 femmefatales and thatsayouproblem
Harry grinned slyly; Draco would sometimes slip back into his petty “Potter” stage when he was frustrated; sex was no exception. And if Harry liked it, well, no one would ever have to know.
“BECAUSE!” Dudley yelled as he ripped away the coat Vernon was attempting to place around his shoulders. “You’re ugly, stupid, and worthless! I can’t be seen with you!”
Harry picked Draco up as easy as anything and practically tossed him onto the bed. Draco looked up at him, eyes huge and heated, chest heaving.
“What do I--You know bloody well what I want, Potter, so just--”
“God, Draco. Fuck,” Harry gasped. A sick sense of satisfaction warmed Draco’s chest at Harry’s reaction; two could play at this game. Draco sucked on his own fingers for a moment, wetting them, and then began stroking Harry’s cock in time with his own.
“Seems so,” Malfoy’s words shook. “This is their handiwork.”
Harry failed to see the appeal of that job, but he smiled politely anyway. “That’s quite impressive, Ron. What about you, Hermione?”
“We’re here, you oaf.”
He groaned into his pillow, shuddering slightly. He wanted to get off. He really, really, wanted to get off; but there were more important matters at hand.
“Me! It’s me!”
“Unfortunately.” And then Draco was off, leaving a trail of water behind him.
Draco snorted. “I believe you mean ‘west’, you absolute oaf.”
“No? Are you a child? Are you--”
“Oh, how proud your father would have been to see you now,” She whispered fondly, placing a weathered but graceful hand over her heart. “Such capable Kings.”
Draco nodded, too eager, and Harry smirked. “Draco. You really are a slut, aren’t you?”
“Please,” Draco begged wantonly, arching his hips up to meet Harry’s. “I n-need you to…”
“I’ve seen their work before,” Draco released a shuddering breath. Images flashed before him-- a Muggle child screaming for his mother as she was torn from limb to limb, the Dark Lord smiling slightly at the show. Pleased.
“Christ,” Draco said, scrubbing his hand over his face. “What’s gotten you in such a spectacular mood this early?”
“Shut it, they suit my face just fine. And they’ll suit Scorpius’ too,” Harry said, hand on his hip. By now, Scorpius had run off and was bouncing around the living room, giggling and screaming a lullaby about Babbity Rabbity.
Finally, summoning what little courage he had, Draco stood up. He rubbed his own arms and threw on some particularly ornamental robes (the ones his Father had chosen for him years ago) in hopes of winning his favor. He rolled his eyes at his own ridiculousness. Like his father would ever remember or appreciate such a thing. He sighed, gelled his hair back with a generous glob, and walked stiffly to his father’s study.
Hermione clucked, disapproving, but Harry noticed a slight smile gracing her lips as she dipped her quill in ink.
“I couldn’t show up in my mother’s carriage, could I? I’d probably be lynched!”
“Say what?” Harry said slyly.
“Why you always pick fights with me. Why you always piss me off,” Harriet trailed her fingers downwards, capturing a soft strand of Draca’s hair and twirling it between them. Draca shivered, mouth parting slightly. “You just want my attention.”
Malfoy blinked and stared at Harry for a moment before shaking his head, hard. Recognition dawned on his features and Harry breathed a sigh of relief. “See? You’re alright.”
The Prince was quiet, refusing to utter even a word, and he moved with a certain grace that Harry had only ever read about. His limbs were quick, tactile, calculated; they somehow guided Harry, who had absolutely no idea how to dance. One foot pushed back, one foot gliding forward; to an outsider, it might have seemed as though Harry actually knew what he was doing. The Prince’s hand was clasped tightly around his, skin so soft and clean that Harry couldn’t help but wonder if he had ever touched a broom in his life. Their feet echoed on the sparkling, tile floors and Harry was keenly aware of the hundreds of eyes on his back. The Prince, however, was unfazed. He continued on without so much as a backwards glance, movements gracile and sure.
Harry knows how much he will hate himself for this later on, but he gives into his impulses and pulls Draco into a tight hug. He smells of fancy cologne and clean air; his taught body is warm and pliant.
Harry shrugged and climbed back into his stiff cot. Just as he was about to fall back into a dreamless sleep, Malfoy whispered:
“In the third corridor, on the left side of the castle. The twelfth bedroom, your highness.”
“No.”
“That’s it! Keep going!”
Harry snorted, waving a dismissive hand. “That old thing? Of course not,” Harry’s eyes widened as he took in what he’d just said. “Oh, God, I even sound like one of you royal arseholes now.”
“Shit, me too, God you’re so fucking sexy--”
“I HATED those damned lessons! And I don’t care if he’s a prince, I won’t marry another man!” Dudley stomped his foot like a child about to throw a tantrum, and Harry couldn’t help but snicker.
“It’s quite alright, Ronald,” She said. Her feet were suddenly dangling in front of Harry’s nose and then she had hopped down, clad in a set of tattered blue pajamas. Her hair was practically an actual nest at this point. “I take it he was wearing a disguise of some kind?” She said through a yawn.  Ron looked at her with wonder as she took a seat next to Harry on his bed.
This chapter was more plot based, but more romance/smutty will be coming soon in the next chapter !!! Any ideas as to where Draco might take Harry to hide? ;) Also, this fanfic is gonna be longer than we originally anticipated, more like 11 chapters instead of the original 9 we once thought it would be. Hope you enjoy this chapter! <3
“Yes, Ron, that’s what he said,” Hermione said, tapping her heeled shoe against the pavement. “This is fantastic!”
“I suppose that’s your job as a servant isn’t it?” Draco huffed.
Harry decided to try and sleep through the noise. But as soon as his head hit the pillow, Malfoy mumbled something incoherent. Harry strained his ears and tried to make out Malfoy’s words.
“Potter?” Draco asked, voice shaky. “ Are you implying that you’re a Squib?”
“Don’t take the bait, Harriet,” ‘Mione said, voice eerily calm. He’d always possessed the unique ability to remain composed in any situation; aside from that one time he’d given in and given Draca a hard shove. Ronda, on the other hand, seemed past the point of words; if Draca didn’t know any better, he’d say that she’d go up in flames at any moment.
Harry’s eyes widened in mock-fear. “Your father? Oh, Merlin, anything but that. And it’s Potter.”
Draco grumbled in protest but did not object, following Harry down the path once again. The two walked in silence for a moment. Harry kicked a rock and watched it tumble down the road.
Hermione looked at Ron, who grimaced. “Well, erm, that’s a bit complicated, mate…” He trailed off, trying to find an answer in Hermione’s eyes. She shook her head, aghast at Ron’s uselessness.
Harriet cupped her face before she could finish her sentence and kissed Draca with everything she had. This wasn’t the first time they had shared a kiss, but in the past they’d always been violent, careless, and without tenderness. Now, however, Harriet took her sweet time, worrying Draca’s plush lip with her teeth. Vanilla, Harriet thought. She tastes like vanilla. She hummed, placing her hands on Draca’s slim, boyish hips.
Lucius’ pale eyebrows rose, intrigued. “A servant? His power must be exceedingly strong for you to consider someone so beneath us.”
“Because of me?! You’re the one who invited me along in the first place!” Draco howled, shooting Harry a cold stare.
“You’re so fucking hot like this, Draco,” Harry murmured, grinding against Draco only slightly. Not enough, Draco thought desperately as he grabbed onto Harry’s collar and yanked, hoping to get the message across without words.
Ron’s shoulders seemed to sag with relief. “Thank Merlin. I think I’d throw up. You have terrible taste in men, Harry, you know that?”
“Me?” Harry pointed to himself, rather stiff.
“Are you insulting the King?!” The knight said incredulously.
Draco wrinkled his nose and tentatively dipped the shirt in the river, sloshing it around awkwardly for a few moments before pulling it back out and placing it on the ground. Harry raised his eyebrows, feeling somewhere between amused and bewildered as to how anyone could be so incredibly useless. Well, Harry shrugged to himself as he observed Draco's clumsy movements. I suppose some help is better than none.
“Uh, sorry about that,” Harry said, his eyes cast downward in shame.
Harry tensed up and then he was kissing Draco sloppily, breaths quick. “Next time, sweetheart.” When Draco moaned in protest, Harry shushed him quietly, biting at his pink lips. “I can’t hurt you, alright? Will you be good for me and wait until next time?” He panted.
And then he was off. Despite the servants and knights that practically begged to follow him around whenever he so much as left the castle, Draco held up a dismissive hand and continued on his way, alone. The bustle of commoners outside of the castle gates parted ways for him like the red sea, and Draco beamed. That right there, he thought, is something I’ll never tire of.
Through the magic of owl post, Harry had somehow convinced his two best friends to come visit him at the Inn while Malfoy was upstairs analyzing the crime scene photographs. Ron and Hermione were all smiles this evening-- and Harry couldn’t blame them. It had been ages since the three had been able to just go out and have a pint.
“That’s a bit of an understatement.”
“But Draco, he’s basically treating you no better than a whore, ready to sell you off to the highest bidder-”
The days that followed were incredibly uneventful. Dull, drab, dim; everything that Draco Malfoy was not. Harry shook his head in an attempt to shake away the invasive thoughts of the ponce; they seemed to be constantly nagging him ever since that damned lesson. But who could blame him when the man was so bloody attractive? Harry was only human, after all.
“I know what laundry is,” Draco snapped. “I was just wondering what you were doing with it. It’s servant work.” Harry turned around to give Draco a deadpan look.
“No, no, you can’t,” Harry interrupted, “if you get my uncle arrested I’ll have nowhere to go.”
“Excellent,” The bartender replied. “One room and a king-sized bed, I presume?”
As soon as Harry entered his office, he was barraged by countless memos. His eyes narrowed-- this was way more than usual. He gingerly opened up one of the little birds and began to read the neat handwriting:
“I’ll bring it back.”
“You’re so fucking hot,” Harry said, voice hoarse. Draco was chanting his name over and over, voice strained from begging to be fucked harder. Harry obliged, and soon he was past the point of rational thought. Draco seemed to be as well, mumbling gibberish into the crook of Harry’s neck.
“That’s Marquise Shrew to you, Draco!”
Harry sat up, almost hitting his head on Hermione’s bunk. “What?! What do you mean?!”
After almost two hours of studying Gillyweed properties (Harriet was all too familiar with the subject, and she shuddered whilst remembering its taste), she was just about ready to keel over from boredom. Professor Sprout was a wonderful man, but he could certainly drone on and on. When Harriet remembered her post-class plans, however, she a thrill shot through her body. She crossed her legs and drummed her short, red nails on the potting table in front of her. Just a fifteen more minutes, she thought eagerly. Rapid images flashed inside of her mind, snippets from their latest encounter. As per usual, their meeting had begun as a bitter battle of both physical and mental proportions; although, every half-assed shove that Harriet directed at Malfoy was, in reality just an excuse to get her hands on her. Harriet had ended up shoving her up against a bathroom stall, disguised as an act of malice; but Malfoy had seen right through it. Harriet shuddered in her seat as she remembered the way Malfoy had parted her legs for her, so pretty and eager…
Extraordinary, was what it was. Harry yearned to meet the rest of the family, all of Ron’s brothers and sister, but they were either in school or had places of their own. Hogwarts, the most well known Wizarding academy in the world,was home to their youngest child, Ginny. Ron practically lost his marbles when Harry revealed to him that he had never heard of such a school.
“Making ourselves at home, are we?” He asked, blowing a stray strand of blond hair away from his eyes. Harry noticed fondly that it wasn’t gelled, and appeared almost feathery-soft.
Harry smirked knowingly, and winked. “I sure did. I had some help getting to bed, though.”
Draco just swallowed, chest constricting, and leaned into Harry’s touch.
“There you go,” Harry said. He allowed his hand to wander, placing it against Draco’s firm, clothed chest. “Now you're getting it.”
Hermione grabbed the book from Harry and gave it a once-over, focusing intently.
“Er, yeah. No problem. You alright?”
“Shit,” Harry said. “What do we have, evidence-wise? And, erm,” He gestured towards Malfoy. “Why is he here? No offense.”
Malfoy clearly couldn’t hear him-- he was too lost in the horrors of his own mind. His chest was rising and falling at a rapid pace and he continued thrashing about, only with more intensity now. Harry tried calling his name again, and when that didn’t work he placed a tentative hand on Malfoy’s shoulder.
Draco, after taking a carriage in town, arrived back at the castle. Its white spires contrasted with the cloudy late afternoon sky. A long marble bulevarde led to the main gate where Draco was greeted by the palace guards. He alighted in front of the castle’s wide steps. As Draco strode through the golden gem encrusted front doors, he was stopped by one of his father’s retainers.
“Scorpius! That’s right, you don’t have tutoring this morning!” Harry grinned, taking his son into his arms. He was so tiny, so breakable; at age three, Scorpius was much smaller than most toddlers his age. “How are my favorite boys this morning?” Scorpius squealed when Harry kissed him on the cheek, and Harry’s heart swelled. Draco rolled his eyes, repressing a grin.
He’d been prolonging the inevitable by wasting away in bed all afternoon. Telling his father about Harry was not going to end well for him, but what else was he supposed to do? His father was waiting impatiently for Draco’s choice so that he could marry his son off as soon as possible, to the person most beneficial to their royal legacy. But Draco couldn’t be with anyone else, not now, not after last night. Draco grumbled, willing his stubborn problem away, and only after dunking his head in the frigid water of his washroom basin did his traitorous body finally listen to him.
Hermione’s eyes widened, deep and hopeful. “Did he really? I threw the invitation away before opening it.”
“Wow, uh, that’s great. I’ll have to check those out,” Harry mumbled. Hermione seemed unfazed by the flatness in Harry’s tone; she just smiled and gestured to the entire library.
Lucius failed to acknowledge the acid in Draco’s tone as he opened the top drawer of his desk and pulled out a sheet of shimmering parchment. He handed it to Draco.
“You seemed rather pallid at dinner,” She said, voice tinged with genuine concern. “Are you ill?”
The days passed quickly, for Harry had never known such contentment. The rhythmic sound of Hermione’s gentle breathing in the bunk above his own served as a sleeping draught, as did the fluffy quilts enveloping his body each night, and Harry was more well-rested than he had ever been in his life. He and Ron passed the time playing Wizard’s Chess and chasing garden gnomes away, while Hermione read by the fire. The three of them often helped Mrs. Weasley with chores, without having being asked; Harry figured that it was the least he could do.
“Hmm?” Draco mumbled, his translucent eyelids fluttering. “Oh. Well of course. Father wants us to marry at once, actually.”
“Hypocrites, both of you.”
Potter looked between the woman and Draco and then voiced an awkward apology before turning back towards him. Potter was certainly no Gilderoy Lockhart when it came to his fans, at least.
“Did Dadda read you a story?” Scorpius asked, green eyes huge and naive. Harry nodded, ruffling his hair.
“Let’s just leave it as it is, Pans,” Draco retorted, voice cold and void of emotion, “I don’t have a choice in the matter.”
“Yes, Harry, you should!”
“It happened right here. Keep your voice down, yeah? Don’t want to have to obliviate them if we can help it.”
Harriet tilted her head to the side, green eyes determined and silently belligerent. “Sure, if it’ll shut you up.”
“Thank you, Ron, but I can make something for myself.”
Harry felt his ears burning with embarrassment. Normally he could take Vernon’s insults without a problem but today he had a guest. A guest who just so happened to be a wealthy noble. Harry shuddered.
The Prince shivered at the forcefulness of Harry’s demand but shook his head. Hm, Harry thought with a smirk. Perhaps the Prince is imagining someone too.
“Sure, sure. Your manners are just astounding, Prince Malfoy. Do you need me to walk you home? It’s getting dark and bandits tend to come out at this time of night. Not that you would know,” Harry mumbled, avoiding Draco’s cool stare.
The black door closed immediately with a slight bang.
“What?” Harry asked, finally turning around and looking at him incredulously. “I should be apologizing, I’ve disrespected you, I’ve insulted you, I’ve--”
Draco is clenching his fist now, jaw set tight. Despite his air of faux-confidence, however, his cheeks are still dusted pink. “That I’m...that I’m good enough for you.”
So Harry placed a gentle kiss to the Prince’s lips. They were softer than the chemise scarf around his neck and Harry instantly felt the urge to fall into them, to taste them further, only to remember that this was the fucking Prince. So, despite himself, he pulled away, breaths quick.
“Who the bloody hell is Ron?” Draco asked, staring unabashedly at the man beside him. “Aren’t you freezing? You’re in shorts!”
“This castle will be mine someday,” Draco growled, and the knight shrank back ever so slightly at the pure acidity of his tone. “Once I inherit the throne, you will regret this.”
“Potter?”
“Of course! I must protect his Royal Highness. I’m a door guard!”
“You’re already wet for me? Little bit of a slut, aren’t you?”
“Father, what is it?” Draco asked, approaching the man behind the desk.
“I won’t look,” Potter said with mirth in his tone. “I’ll even cover my eyes, see?” Potter placed his hands over his glasses like the idiot he was, and Draco stood still, suddenly feeling extremely awkward. Since when was Potter a bloody mind reader? Starting with one button Draco slowly began to undress. He opened his briefcase and pulled out his silk pajama set, his favorite. He changed into it as quickly as possible and then cleared his throat.
“It'll be okay. I want you to find someone who loves you like you deserve, alright? Someone who'll treat you right. And I--”
Harry allowed himself to push in a few more inches and groaned at the tight heat. “Fuck,” He said throatily as he pinned one of Draco’s arms to the bed. “You alright?”
“Sorry, it’s a bit of a mess right now,” Harry mumbled, clearing some coffee-stained documents from his desk. Malfoy snorted.
The door swung open, scraping against the polished wall and making Draco grimace. The Queen always had to make an entrance, no matter the circumstances. Draco turned around to greet her. Narcissa’s black and white hair, tucked behind her bejeweled ears, was plaited into a complex network of braids. Her robes were floaty and shapeless, crafted from the finest silks in the kingdom.
“Potter,” Draco said quietly. “Don’t sleep here.”
Lucius stalked off into the back room, leaving Draco a stationary, trembling mess. He was alone, now; the only sound he processed was the steady ticking of the grandfather clock across the office. His eyes burned with unshed tears. He clenched his teeth and dug his long nails into his palm, hard enough to leave small, pink crescents on the unblemished skin. He swallowed the urge to cry, refusing to let a single tear fall. He’d already disgraced himself enough for the day. With that, he returned to his quarters with only one thought in mind:
them. My father kicks them around a bit, but that's only when they deserve it. What I said was true, you know. Servants must be fed in order to work.”
“Bugger off, Hermione,” He mumbled shyly, still unconvinced by their arguments. Draco Malfoy would never, ever, see Harry in such a way.
Ron grimaced. “Oh. I see. Sorry, it just seemed to me like you have some pretty powerful magic.”
“Knew it’d be easy to get you to moan like a whore,” Harry whispered into Draco’s ear, catching a whiff of Draco’s girly shampoo in the process. Draco whimpered, body shivering, and Harry could feel his lithe muscles spasm beneath the supple skin of his abdomen. “You want it so fucking bad, don’t you?”
Harry took the sandy item from Malfoy’s hands and dusted it off with his own. It was indeed a child’s sandal, made out of leather. A small white flour was sewn into the strap.
Draco tensed. “Not exactly. Most of my work stays behind a desk. I like it that way.”
Harry sighed dejectedly, smile fading, and he swam quickly back to Draco and pulled him up. He coughed out a bit of water but seemed otherwise unfazed, eyes piercing Harry with a venomous glare.
Harry glared at them, cheeks slightly flushed, because well...her friends were right. “Shut it, both of you.”
“You need to work on your patience,” Harry bluffed, although he was close to caving himself. He made quick work of Draco’s last layer and grinned hugely when he saw how hard and wet Draco already was.
Harry blanched , throat tightening at Hermione’s explanation. “Shit,” He said, stupidly hoping that this was just one big, cruel joke.
Harry snorted and gave Blondie a once-over. He was lanky, dressed in white robes and shiny black shoes. Judging by his golden jewelry and silk cloak, this guy was probably the farthest thing from poor. Harry, if not for being completely disgusted by this pretentious dick, would have called him handsome. His cheekbones sat high on his pale face, accenting his thin nose and sunken, stormy eyes.
“I can help you there!” Ron said, puffing out his chest proudly. “Each employee of the castle is given access to the Royal Wardrobe! I’ll get something nice for you.”
Draco moaned obscenely and pressed his cock against Harry's abdomen.
“You’re just as bad as them, you know,” Draca grinned slyly, white teeth contrasting with her pink lips. “For spending so much time with human dirt.”
“And who is this? A Muggle friend of yours?” Vernon asked, eyeing Draco with distaste. Draco, who had been staring wide-eyed at the scene unfolding in front of him, seemed to snap back to reality.
“Mmm? Harry blinked, taking in Ron’s freckled face inches above his own. “Whatsit?”
“Potter! I’m hungry,” Dudley barked at Harry from where he was surrounded by silk comforters and plush pillows. “Fetch me something to eat.” Dudley paused. “Also, I will to be visiting the emporium with father in an hour. While I’m gone, I want you to clean up this mess,” He gestured with a pudgy hand glittering with rings at the mess of toys, books, and clothes that completely covered every inch of Dudley's tacky, purple carpet.
Draco opened his mouth as if to reply, but Harry pound into him once again and whatever he had to say died in his throat.
“A-Anything, Good Sir. I’m sure your advice would be of much help to us,” Vernon said, looking up at Draco hopefully. Harry repressed the urge to scoff at Vernon’s obvious, desperate thirst for money.
Draco looked down through his pale eyelashes, cheeks pink, and nodded stiffly. Harry laughed, pressing down on his hip bones forcefully and pinning Draco down in the process. “Of course you do.” He ground against Draco, who moaned helplessly.
“Dammit, just let me out! I’m the fucking Prince, for Merlin’s sake! Can’t I at least see what’s going on?”
“Don’t be daft, Harry!” Hermione said, whacking Harry on the head with her parchment. Harry grimaced.
“I never admitted to having feelings for someone!” Draco swallowed, palms suddenly clammy. Harry was...a Squib, wasn’t he? The powerful magic Draco must have sensed was surely a trick of his mind, a grasp for straws; however his mother did have a point. Malfoys were notorious their magic-sensing capabilities, after all. If Potter had been able to use magic as a child…
“Well, I wasn’t expecting to keep them on in the water if that’s what your stupid arse is implying!”
Harriet sighed at that, tucking hair behind her ear. Her features smoothed themselves back into a facade of forced neutrality. “Are you finished, Draca? I’ve places to be.” Harriet, without waiting for a reply, attempted to walk past Draca and her friends, only to be blocked by the lithe blond.
Draco nodded in agreement. “Seems as though Harry’s right for once.”
"H...Harry," Draco barely whimpered, voice fervent with desperation. Harry snapped his hips and began fucking into him mercilessly, pounding into his prostate with every thrust. Malfoy was practically screaming at this point, pushing Harry deeper into him with his legs.
Before he knew it, Ron had ordered the three of them a round of shots. And then another, and then another. Harry’s head was spinning by the time Ron and Hermione said their goodbyes and apparated back home.
“So are you going to come over here or do I have to push you into the river to get my hands on you?” Harry smirked, suddenly sly. Draco sputtered, face hot, but said nothing and walked awkwardly towards Harry. He sat down cautiously, grimacing at the scrape of his embroidered robes against the dirt and grass.
Draco flushed, deeper now, and scoffed, kicking a rock with his left foot. “Excited? Hah. The day I’ll be excited to spend more time with a petty servant such as yourself will be the day pigs fly.”
Draca colored once again at the implications of Harriet’s words. She stepped away quickly, almost tripping over her own feet, and smoothed out her robes so awkwardly that even ‘Mione laughed aloud at the sight.
Before Draco could reply, Harry was on top of him again, tugging at Draco’s trousers and finally pulling them off. It was freezing, but somehow Harry’s hard body radiated warmth.
“Hold onto my waist, Potter, you imbecile!”
Once he was spruced up in his typical attire, Draco looked at himself in the mirror. He knew he was good looking, of course, but today he was doubting himself. He shook his head and puffed his chest out while smoothing back a stray strand of hair. Perfect, he thought.
“You wish.”
a pleasure.”
Draco sighed and rolled his eyes. With a shaking hand, he wandlessly conjured up some lube and Harry’s hands were suddenly wet and cool with the liquid. Harry raised an eyebrow.
“Can’t even keep track of today’s date, Potter?” Draco smirked-- the insult felt a bit forced, but it provided a comfortable familiarity.
“You mean...I can marry him?”
Draco cleared his throat and Harry just about jumped out of his skin. “Draco?! I-I mean, Your Highness?! What the hell are you doing here, it’s the middle of the night--”
Draco lay beside him, ivory skin still glistening with clean sweat. His eyes, although colorless, lit up the dim tent. Harry opened his mouth to speak, to tell Draco what words were practically spilling off of his tongue.
Hermione laughed ruefully and rolled her eyes, subtly gesturing towards the Knight with her slim shoulder.
Draco was close, now, so close. His wet chest was chilly against Harry’s exposed skin.
“What are you laughing at?!”
“Oh, you know you don’t need to call me that anymore. You’re our second King!,” She replied, blushing at Harry’s gentlemanly act. “It went well. Those Americans, they can be tough, but I think I got through to them somewhat. The decision, now, is left to you two.”
“Purple is a fantastic color, Potter! You should be grateful!”
“You don’t have to hold back, Draco. I can see how bad you want it, so go ahead and make all the noise you want.”
“Not that we know of, Prince Malfoy. At this time, I am unsure what caused it, but I’ll let you know if--”
“I can’t marry him,” Harry said dejectedly. “He wouldn’t want to marry me, I’m a commoner. I can’t even use magic, remember?”
Harry’s heart sank a bit when he saw what Malfoy was pointing at-- a miniscule droplet of blood, practically smaller than a pinhead.
“I was two feet away. And you were ready. You didn’t even need me, you just freaked out like the pansy you are and forgot about what you were supposed to be doing.”
“Let’s go home, alright? We can finally get our room in order.”
“You will not,” Lucius said, voice suddenly rising in volume. Draco flinched. “Marry vermin. Do you realize how absurd this request is? You will not allow a Muggle to lay a single hand upon your skin, Draco.”
“Is this one of your ridiculous follies, Draco?” Said Lucius, voice erily steady . Draco shook his head.
Harry scrambled to the door, confused, and opened it with shaking hands.
But sure enough, the man in front of him was indeed Draco. More dolled up, perhaps, but most definitely him.
“I’m truly flattered,” Draco said, voice proud and eloquent. “And I can’t speak for Officer Brooks, over here. But I actually prefer my men in uniform as well.”
Draco flipped through the papers on his desk to confirm. “Yes. Are we finished?”
“Good,” Harry said quietly, placing a friendly hand on Draco’s lithe shoulder. He allowed it to linger a little too long, however, and he noticed Draco’s eyes flitting over to where his hand rested. Harry pulled it away as though he had been burned, and he must have imagined Draco’s slight shudder.
“Well, I suppose I’d better get back to my cleaning and laundry. Enjoy having actual careers!” Harry said, chest lighter than it had been a while.
“That, Pansy,” Draco said, beginning to walk a little quicker. “Is none of your business.”
“Both, perhaps. But the drinks come later.”
“No!” Draco practically yelled, embarrassment creeping up his spine as soon as the word left his mouth. Harry only grinned, eyes glinting. Bastard, Draco thought.
The retainer lead Draco through the richly furnished halls of the palace, ornate tapestries adorned the walls and thick plush carpets muffling their footsteps.
Scorpius ran to her, delighted, and hugged her as hard as his tiny body could allow. “Gramma! Gramma! Gramma Nasissa!” He said, still unable to pronounce the Late Queen’s name properly.
“Er, of course I have. It’s just...I didn’t know.” Harry cringed internally at his own awkwardness.
“I told you not to call me that, you scum!”
“Oh, I’m not. You’re an honorary Muggle now! Congratulations!”
The words were simple, an easy read. Harry had never been a fan of long and complex stories. The plot was rudimentary, almost childish, but there was something about the tale that had him completely engrossed whenever he picked it up. An invisibility cloak? Surely there was no such thing.
Harry kissed Draco once more, sloppy and sated, and lay down next to  him. He flung his arm across Draco, who cleaned them up with a quick flick of his wand and a mumbled spell.
“Want more?” Harry asked, voice rough with desire. Draco nodded, fingers flexing against Harry’s back. His grey eyes were a bit unfocused, but they were on Harry; impossibly wide and lust-blown. His lips were parted slightly and his cheeks were flushed; He looked completely and utterly debauched despite the fact that Harry wasn’t even fucking him yet. Draco looked so good like this, impossibly good, and it took all of Harry’s self control not to shove into him all at once. Though, judging by the way Draco reacted to a second finger inside of him, that wouldn’t have been a problem; Harry could find no indication of pain in his sharp features.
"You...you can...do more. If you want."
“Breakfast, boy! And be snappy about it,” The lump responded, and Harry quickly backed out of the room and into the bright hallway. His soft footfalls on the carpeted floors of the manor made his creaking steps down the wooden stairs leading to the kitchen sound even louder. He shivered in the frigid air and rushed to light the fire before beginning Vernon’s and Dudley’s breakfast.
“You--” Draco began, eyes widening when Harry removed his own shirt with a swift flick of his wand. “Get on with it!”
Draco sniffed, and if the situation had been less serious Harry would have teased him endlessly about shedding tears. But this time, Harry took a gentle hand and swiped away their stains. Draco took a shuddering breath, leaning into Harry’s touch.
‘Mione glared at her pointedly, and Harriet smiled at the display. Draca, however, was still wallowing in her own shame.
Ron scratched the back of his head and shifted awkwardly. “Er, yeah. They are. But of course I’d never speak badly of his Royal Highness, that would go against my Knightly Pledge!”
Harry had to admit that he was attractive. Not that he would ever be interested in such a person, but still. He could recognize that the man was aesthetically pleasing. Draco resembled an ice prince, something cold and complex and sharp; almost like a veela disguised in glamour. Now, Harry thought as his stream of consciousness finally began to slow, How the hell do I teach an incompetent noble to swim?
“It’s a child’s shoe. They killed her.” Malfoy said, voice monotone and stare suddenly vacant.
“Hold on,” Harry began, swallowing thickly. “Your father, The King, was happy about the fact that I destroyed a solid one sixth of his castle?”
“Well,” Harry said with a smirk. “We’ve the house to ourselves, now.”
“What the hell are you doing with your step-brother’s laundry?”
“Neither!” Harry said in alarm. “He’s not interested in me, not at all!”
Harry had been waiting, waiting, waiting for his death for about half an hour when a ridiculously loud knock broke the tense silence of his mind. He’d been sitting on the floor, feeling strange doing anything else, and when he stood up he felt slightly woozy. It had been days since he’d eaten.
Potter laughed and leaned over once again, placing a rough hand under Draco’s own. Draco repressed a shiver. “What are you doing now?!”
“Of course, lead me to him,” Draco said.
Harry shook his head in a frantic attempt to clear it. “But that’s...why would he come here?”
Hermione rolled her eyes, lashes thick and curled. "Of course we would save you, who do you think we are?"
“It’s not my fault your motor skills are far below average.”
Harry snorted and placed his hand back on Draco's head, resuming his rhythmic hair-stroking. “So you haven't, then?”
Nodding to his father with as much respect as he could muster under the current circumstances, Draco trounced off, robes billowing behind him.
Regards,
“A bit.”
“You seem pretty excited about that idea for someone who can already swim,” He said.
Potter ignored him and sat up, body swaying a bit. “What’re you doing?”
Harry raised an eyebrow. “A Muggleborn?”
Draco rolled his eyes, trying and failing not to smile a bit. “You fell asleep. Go to bed.”
Harry was about to burst out laughing-- these Muggle women sure were direct. And sharing women with Draco Malfoy of all people? Merlin. But before Harry could make a sound, Draco spoke. He was smiling devilishly, teeth practically glinting. Shit, Harry thought rather absently. When did he get so charming?
“Of course it’s cold. What were you expecting, a warm bath?”
Draco opens his mouth to say something but his voice breaks and Harry grins hugely into his chest. There we are, he thinks. Not even an insult. Perhaps I’m getting through to him.
Fuck, Draco thought, stifling a moan. Get him off. Harry was going to get him off.
Draco looked hurt for a moment, shrinking back, but then his eyes hardened. “If I were to find a companion in any insignificant Squib, Potter, it would have been you. But you’re not. I’m sure of it.”
“Sure thing! Here, look at what I brought you,” Ron opened a leather satchel that he’d slung around his shoulder and pulled out a white, high-collared dress robe with shining golden buttons and silk embroidery. Harry had never seen something so fancy in his life, aside from Draco himself, and he couldn’t hide his shock.
“I told you, Malfoy. They’re--” Potter hiccuped. “They’re moving left.”
“But you have magic, lots of it, I can feel it!”
The pads of Draco’s boney fingers created a repetitive song against his mahogany desk. Focus, he thought, gritting his teeth. Focus.
Before Draco could snap back with an insult of his own, Potter was already flagging down the barkeep. Fluffy black hair covered her eyes and she wore a tattered apron.
“No problem.”
Draco huffed and stood up, brushing off his now-soiled white pants. “Shut your mouth, Peter, or whatever your name is. If you keep disrespecting me like this my father will hear about it.”
Moments after Dudley polished off the remainder of his eggs, Harry yanked the plate out of his chubby hands and practically bolted out of the bedroom. He peered into Uncle Vernon’s bed chambers, only to observe that the plate of breakfast had been left untouched; Harry quietly shut the door.
“Might be your own insecurities talking there, Draco. You should be careful.”
“I’m not--” Harry began, scandalized.
“Hmm. Correct me if I’m wrong, but I thought it’d be the other way around.”
“Well,” ‘Mione began. Harry could feel another lecture coming on. “First of all, you hate each other.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I was making a point!” Draco whined, throwing his head back in exasperation. He groaned, lazily creating circles with the tip of his wand, and a pile of crumpled clothes appeared on Harry’s lap. “There you go, you degenerate. Take off those tatty things.”
“We’ll see to it, Mother,” Draco said with a respectful nod.
"In case you haven’t noticed, Mr. I’m-the-Prince,” Harry chuckled at the sheer hilarity of the idea, “I am a servant.”
“Don’t even start,” Harry mumbled, kissing Draco’s neck before his lips. Draco whimpered pathetically and leaned into Harry’s touch, already hot and hard against Harry’s thigh. “You would get on your knees and beg for it, if I made you.”
Harry cleared his throat and Draco whirled around, eyes wide. He was wearing a black cloak, dark and simple; the exact opposite of anything Harry had ever seen him wear before. He looked tired and even more gaunt than usual.
“I thought maybe you didn’t recognize me, didn’t...but, uh, yeah. I’m the same. I mean, I’m attracted to you, too,” Harry swallowed, adam’s apple bobbing.
“Blimey,” Harry said. “You really did mean it when you said you’d bring me nice robes.”
“Hey,” Harry whispered, wiping a bead of sweat from his brow as he approached his two friends. “Can I talk to you guys about something?”
“If marrying a stranger is what it takes to preserve our family’s prestige then you will do it, Draco,” said Lucius, eyes growing steely.
“And you? What do you have to say about this?”
Harry gulped and tentatively entered his home, shooting Draco another glare. He was screwed.
“Potter. I’m finished.”
All of the blood drained from Vernon’s face. “N-No, Good Sir. Please, do take a seat. Harry will cook something up for you in a moment, isn’t that right, Harry?”
“So?” Hermione snapped, arms crossed. “What was so important that you had to interrupt our quest for knowledge?”
Draco wrinkled his nose. “I don’t drink that Mugg-- I don’t drink it. But thanks.”
Harry’s eyes widen at Draco’s foul language, and all of a sudden he’s not cold anymore.
Draco clung to him, body taut with pleasure, as Harry continued fucking into him with increasing speed. Draco was making obscene noises with every thrust, pushing back against Harry with ridiculous enthusiasm.
Harry was on Draco in an instant, dipping him rather dramatically and capturing his lips. Draco rolled his eyes but went along with Harry’s display of grandeur. We’ve been together for over ten years, Harry thought as he snaked a hand under Draco’s pajama shirt, and our sex life is still bloody incredible.
“I’m aware, Potter. I’ve studied the case files.”
As always, I really hope you enjoyed!! Please please comment below and let us know if you did, it means the world to us!!!!
Harry lets go of Draco who seems to deflate immediately at the loss of contact. His eyes are fixated on the white-brown sludge under his polished shoes. With chilled wind in his ears, Harry barely hears Draco’s broken whisper.
Draco felt a bead of sweat drip down the side of his forehead and into his shirt. He wanted to get up and run, to grab Potter and travel far away and never return home.
“Now,” Harry said, possessively taking Scorpius from Draco’s arms. “What would you really like, sweetheart?”
Neville revealed the news enthusiastically. “Her name is Granger. Hermione Granger. Smartest witch you’ll ever talk to, I swear it! She’s young, like us. Just graduated from the School for Muggleborns.”
“Shh!” Blaise hissed, spit flying from her mouth as she tied her textured hair into two parallel buns. “What if someone hears you?”
“Shut it, Potter, before I change my mind,” Draco scowled, flush deepening. “I’ve come to take you somewhere. With me.” Draco fussed with the unkempt hem of his robes. “T-That is, if you want to.”
“Merlin,” Harry said. “Is life really this easy for you all the time?”
“Ron- you didn’t need to--”
“He bloody better be!” Ron slammed his butterbeer down in front of him, causing yet another spill. “Takes everything in me not to punch his pretty face every time I see him at the Ministry. I can’t believe they gave him a job after what he did.”
He scoffed and nodded, like it should have been obvious. So Harry numbly made his way over to the Prince, who still refused to utter a word. Strange.
Harry awoke to the frantic ringing of bells chiming from where they had been mounted on the stone wall of the chilly kitchen. The bell labeled Dudley’s Room, in flowing script, rung, shaking wildly.
The boys had the Gryffindor common room all to themselves today as a result of the campus' Christmastime lull. Despite copious amounts of available space, Draco and Harry had chosen to sit together on a plush, small sofa. Draco had his head in Harry's lap like the princess he was, and the crackling fire warmed their bodies.
Draco shrugged, nonplussed. “Whatever. Merlin knows you need it.”
His thoughts immediately strayed to that rich imbecile, Draco. He was a puzzle, to say the least; A complete snob with an absurd, glorified self-image. And yet he had still saved Harry’s sorry arse (perhaps, as compensation for the drowning incident)  and asked him for swimming lessons.
Draco’s mouth opened and closed a few times, wordlessly. Perhaps, Harry thought, Draco had no idea how to respond to this ingrate, this lowborn degenerate that was himself. With his mouth hanging open stupidly like that, Harry thought Draco looked sort of like a fish. A rather dashing fish. But regardless of how dashing, this Draco boy was still a pointy, foul-tempered fish.
Draco nodded, cheeks pink, and chewed on his bottom lip. “Only for you.”
“Show you? Show you what?”
“No, he doesn’t!” Harry grimaced when Ron shot him a glare. “Sorry, guys, but neither of you do. Why would someone so rich, so gorgeous, so bloody stuck up be interested in me?”
Upon returning to the Dursley’s, Harry’s positive mood began to dwindle into a somber boredom. As he completed his chores, all he could think about was the infinite amount of tasks farther on his list. They were never ending, it seemed to him. And then, as he splashed his hand about in the warm water he’d brought from the fire to clean dishes with, he was reminded of tomorrow’s plans. The swimming lesson with Draco, that obnoxious nobleman.
“Because I have class, unlike y--”  But Draco failed to finish his sentence, choking out a moan when Harry repositioned his hips to line up perfectly with Draco’s once again. He leaned down, capturing Draco’s open mouth in a dirty kiss that was all tongue, and then pulled away only to whisper:
Narcissa smiled, taking Scorpius’ hand and leading him towards the door. “Enjoy your time with Harry, my dear,” She said to Draco before making a swift exit. Harry caught a whiff of her sweet perfume.
Draco blinked, lips parted slightly, and sunk to his knees to be level with Harry, who was still sitting on the red couch. Harry's throat was suddenly dry. Draco on his knees was a very, very good image.
“Hey, er,” Harry interrupted, clearing his throat awkwardly. “I can help too, if you’d like.”
Narcissa laughed; a strong, sharp sound. “I’m only teasing, my dear,” She gestured to Scorpio, who was still clinging to her leg. “I’ve come to see my beautiful grandson. Do you two have anywhere to be? I would love to take him for a walk in the gardens, if you’d allow it.”
The night air was cool against Harry’s skin. He looked back at the cookie-cutter houses that reminded him so much of his childhood and shivered. Playing Muggle for an evening had been nice, but it was time to return home. His world needed him, after all.
Draco calmed down, body relaxing, and he nodded. Harry kissed the side of his mouth tenderly and Draco’s hips bucked involuntarily. He was going to lose it, too soon, and He hadn’t even felt Harry’s cock yet. He wasn’t having that, so his trembling hands found their way to Harry’s fly and pulled his thick member out. It was heavy in Draco’s hand, just the right size to fill him up and fuck him properly.
Vernon paled slightly; the were low on income as it was.
Or, Draco thought with a dizzying surge of hope. It’s your magic.
Vernon grabbed the hem of Harry’s shirt. “No dinner for a week,” He said, spit flying onto Harry’s face with every word. “And until you make up for this you’ll be sleeping outside.”
And then Draco’s orgasm hit him hard. Wave after wave of intense pleasure pulsed through his body, Harry’s hand working him through every second of it. His thoughts were white, and Draco could have screamed, he wasn’t sure. Once the high wore off and Harry’s hand had left him, he sunk down on the soft grass and tried to calm his breathing. Only then did he realize that his hand was sticky with Harry’s come.
“You’re stunning.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Babe?” Harry croaked while trying and failing to smooth down his hair. “Draco?”
“I don’t mind it,” Harry said. Ron grinned at him.
“So it is. Tricky to read it though. I’d say rewrite the title anyway. Oh! I’ve forgotten to get you a quill!” She handed Harry a cheaply made red quill, feather dyed to appear similar to a phoenix's.
The color had drained from Vernon’s cheeks and he swallowed, sinking impossibly closer to the ground. “Y-Yes, your Highness. Of course.”
“Of course they will,” Draco snapped. “He inherited my looks.”
“He isn't, Father, I'm telling you, I can feel his power, he’s--”
“But he--
Harry’s eyes widened. He looked to Draco, who had grown pale.
“Yours,” Malfoy replied instantaneously. He seemed to catch himself, and then added a quiet: “Please.”
Draca rolled her eyes, pale lashes reflecting the sun oozing from the open ceilings. “Oh please. I can say whatever the hell I want here. My father will make sure I don’t get in any ‘trouble’ for speaking my mind. He opted me out of Herbology homework just yesterday, you know.”
In the past, Draco would have made a stink about Hermione’s blood status and her biological inferiority, but today he decided to keep his mouth shut. And if that had something to do with the image of Harry that suddenly appeared in his mind, no one would ever know.
“Oh, hello again! Harry, wasn’t it?”
Draco sniffed and looked away. “Lazy? Of course not. I want you to guide me, that’s all.”
He deepened the kiss, running his tongue across Draco's bottom lip. A soft moan escaped from Draco's lips, immediately followed by him tensing up. Harry chuckled and just barely pulled away.
“Father, perhaps we should invite commoners as well? They may not be of royal blood but you and I both know that status doesn’t actually dictate the purity and power of someone’s blood.”
“They've come for me, Draco,” he whispered. Draco looked down at Harry's hands, clutching the soft material of the sleeping bag, and saw that they were shaking.
Harry was dozing against the kitchen table, head sinking further and further into his own arms. He had just finished his most grueling chore, which was scrubbing the permanently stained marble floors (Vernon would never stop pestering him no matter how hard he scrubbed; he didn’t seem to understand that they were impossible to remove). His entire body was lethargic and he craved sleep almost as much as he craved water. The well was closed off today due to an infestation of gnomes and it had been ages since he’d last had something to drink. His mouth was dry and the air, still sticky, was practically choking him to death. When he heard Dudley’s heavy clomping, however, he suddenly found his energy, shooting up out of his chair and bolting out the door. No more chores today, he thought as he tied his left boot. I’d rather be executed by the King himself.
Harry’s stomach unclenched and he released a tight breath he was unaware he was holding. “How do you even know that? And is this your own bigoted way of saying you’re okay with this?”
“S-Shut your mouth, you sad sap,” Draco mumbles, cheeks glowing. There’s a snowflake on his pale eyelashes and Harry almost wipes it away. It melts, however, so he settles for cupping Draco’s cheek and stroking the soft skin there. Draco is rigid for a moment, shocked by the tenderness of the action. Harry sighs, brushing clumsy, mitten-glad fingers through white-blond hair. The two have been an item for months now and Draco still is not used to being treated this way. Not used to being loved.
“Yeah, I suppose so,” Harry thought, mulling over the last couple of days in his head. “He doesn’t say much anymore.”
Draco said nothing, but avoided Harry's burning gaze. The dim light from the stained glass window on the adjacent wall made Draco's long eyelashes appear almost white. He was ethereally beautiful; so much so that Harry temporarily forgot his plan.
“Alright, alright!” He took a breath and tried to gather his thoughts. “I don’t...I don’t want to marry just anyone,” He mumbled, face reddening in shame. “What if they’re rude? Or unattractive? Or--”
“I’d rather not,” Draco said in a monotone voice, shooting Vernon an icy stare.
Once Harry returned to an empty manor, he plopped down in front of the fire and shivered as the information sunk in. Merlin, Draco had been the fucking Prince this entire time? Harry could have been arrested for treason with how flat out disrespectful he had been over the course of their interactions. He would have felt betrayed if it wasn’t for the fact that Draco (or rather, His Highness) actually had referred to himself as the Prince on multiple occasions; Harry just hadn’t taken him seriously. Why was it that Harry felt so sure of himself in those moments? His chest ached with a dull detachment. Although he had known from the start that Draco would never return his unwarranted feelings, he had allowed himself to hope, if only slightly. Now, however, he was confident of that fact. A Squib and a Prince? Yeah, right.
When there was no reply, Harry ventured into the kitchen. Any anxiety he felt on behalf of his missing husband faded when he was greeted by the beautiful sight of Draco with a tiny boy on his shoulders, baking something over the fire.
“Oh yes, I am. My mother would be appalled if she knew I’d messed around with a Muggleborn at the ball!”
“He’s not a Muggle!” Draco bellowed, eyes suddenly stinging. Lucius stood and pounded his fist against his desk, causing many decorations to wobble precariously.
Draco would have sworn on his own future grandchildren that he’d only gone to spy on Potter and his friends for research purposes. To...further understand the man he was being forced to work on this case with. That was all. He’d thrown on a t-shirt and a pair of work pants after trying and failing to actually learn anything from the case files. Now, as he walked down the stairs into the taven, he felt as though he was being puppeteered by some invisible puppet master-- one who got off on his suffering, apparently.
“My apologies, Father,” Draco said, repressing his smile with great difficulty. His heart was going a million miles a minute as the news sunk in. “I...thank you. Thank you,” He breathed, voice cracking slightly. Lucius squinted his eyes and nodded stiffly.
Draco flushed all the way up to his ears, eyes widening in shock.  “Oh. You...actually were?”
Harriet rolled her eyes, pushed up her glasses, and began her trek to Herbology.
It was ridiculous, and Harry knew it to be so; however when were fantasies ever realistic?
“You’ll see. Ready to go? Got you a footmen and everything, it’s pretty incredible.”
“Alright then, Your Highness,” Potter muttered under his breath.
Harry tugs on Draco’s cold wrist, taking in Draco's slightly red nose and snow-flecked hair.
"Yes, and I’m Head Auror,” Harry responded. “Did our earlier impact damage your brain?”
“What--” Harry began.
“Shut it. You’re going. It’s the law, you know.”
“You should ask him to dance,” Ron said plainly. Harry blanched at the thought, but Hermione nodded eagerly.
“You…,” The man’s eyes shifted from shocked to angry in an instant. “Do you know who I am?!”
“Oh please. That’s basic magic. You haven’t even seen the inside yet.”
“Yes. The name’s James Blake, Violent Crimes Division. At your service.” Malfoy reached out a spindly hand and shook the woman’s hand firmly and with crisp professionalism. Harry raised an eyebrow. Malfoy wasn’t bad at this.
“Fair enough.” Harry responded, “ Hopefully, then I would die of starvation and even that would be better than living with you.” Dudley sputtered. Giving Harry a dark glare, he started shoveling the eggs into his mouth.
“What? Didn’t catch that,” Harry replies, fighting back the urge to take one of Draco’s hands into his own. I suppose I’ve tortured him enough for one day, haven’t I? He thinks.
“Why not?” Draco challenged. “Scared, Potter?”
Draco sputtered, flushing further. “Of course I don’t, Mother! I’m simply anxious about who my future spouse will be! That's natural, isn't it?!”
Harry laughed, tipping his head back and appreciating the warmth of the sunlight on his wet skin. Yes, Draco was a pretentious, snobby arsehole but there was something about him that Harry couldn’t help but find slightly charming.
Potter slapped him on the shoulder, grinning from ear to ear. “You--you did it. Nice work.”
Harry’s chest was heavy with the realization that the book was almost finished. He would have to go to the library tomorrow and exchange it for something else. What else was he supposed to do during his fleeting free time during the night, when it was too cold and dangerous to roam the streets?
Harry placed a confident hand on Draco's soft, freshly-shaven cheek and gently pulled him forward, connecting their lips. They had kissed on multiple occasions since they had become official two weeks ago, but that was all. Harry struggled with keeping his pent-up desires in check.
That shut Draco up long enough for Harry to grab his slender waist and lift him up high for a bit of momentum. Draco successfully pushed himself out of the water and onto the gravelly earth.
“Pardon?” Ron choked out, sputtering.
“Shut it!”
“Since my parents died and I lost my magic, yeah.”
Harry raised an eyebrow and considered Draco’s words. “Haven’t been cold at all for the past few days, not sure why. I feel rather warm, actually.”
“Then he is a Squib, Draco. A filthy, insignificant Squib! He is filth!”
The knight cleared his throat. “King’s orders, Your Highness. You must stay here until further notice.”
“He doesn’t hate you, Draco. He was probably just shocked.”
“Oh, you don’t want me to…” Harry trailed off, realizing how stupid he probably sounded. “Sorry, Your Highness, but I’ve never met a royal before. I suppose I’m not sure what I should do.”
“So you admit it then?” Ronda asked, grinning wildly. ‘Mione stared at Harry, hands on his hips.
“Yeah?”
“Let’s go!” Ron yanked Harry outside and gestured towards the grand carriage that awaited them. It matched Harry’s robes; it was a creamy shade of ivory and seemed to be encrusted in gold. Two black stallions, all muscle, stood still and complaint in front of the footmen, who donned a silly white wig and glossy shoes. Harry was rendered speechless; all he could do was follow Ron inside.
“P-Potter, I’m going to…” He trailed off, face pink.
“F-Father…” Draco stammered, a million thoughts racing through his mind at once. “You...Are you referring to Harry?”
“I don’t,” Harry said simply, deciding to change the subject before he had to explain further. “So, you work for the King?”
Draco cleared his throat. “It’s me, Father.”
There was a moment of silence and Draco could have sworn that he heard a slew of muffled curse words. Then the door swung open, practically hitting Draco in the nose, only to reveal the stout gumdrop of a man he had (unfortunately) met once before. Vernon Dursley looked up at him with terror in his eyes, swollen cheeks a nauseating reddish-purple.
“You’re not going to break me, Potter, s-so hurry it up!”
The brief trek back to Harry’s place consisted of somewhat awkward silence and occasional bickering. Once the two arrived, Harry grabbed the spare key from under the doormat and let the two of them inside only to be greeted by an immediate:
Harry was about to decline her offer and tell her that he was just fine on his own, but she continued speaking before he could do so.
“Of course we remember, Harry,” Hermione said, more serious now. “But he loves you. I’m sure of it.”
Pansy just shook her head, silver earrings dangling about. Draco was about to get up, only to remember something and flop back down onto Pany’s lap.
“Potter.”
Harry blinked. “Yeah. Sure.”
“Now, Ron,” Hermione began sternly. “That could get Harry in trouble, or you could lose your job, or--”
Harriet laughed breathily. She’d barely seen any of Draco, only felt her under her robes, and she was already ridiculously turned on. And by the looks of it Draca was too; her pupils were wide and lust-blown and her body was absurdly pliable in Harriet’s arms.
Draco pulled his hand away from Potter’s and did as told. The sound continued for a moment before Kingsley’s voice began speaking into Draco’s ear. It sounded tinny, almost garbled.
The two kept this up for a while until Harry made the decision to silently detach himself from Draco.
“The quidditch pitch.”
Draco shivered and nodded pliantly, avoiding Harry’s eyes.
After a few wrong turns and few stuttering commoners assisting him with directions, Draco had made it to the river. He was shocked to see Potter already sitting on the edge, dipping his bare feet into the slow-moving water. He was staring at the sky, delicate features illuminated by the sun, and Draco was stunned into silence. His eyes were so green, so different from Draco’s own harsh grey. God, it had been ages since Draco had been with anyone, much less someone so beautiful--Draco shook his head, rather ashamed of himself. Was he really so desperate that he found a petty servant attractive? He grimaced, however still failed to remove his eyes from Harry's person. Finally, after noting the faint red highlights woven in Harry’s black tresses, Draco cleared his throat.
Harry gave Draco a funny look and said, “Well, till tomorrow then.”
He heard a booming knock on the door of his bedchambers; one that was strong and short, unlike the feeble tapping of his many servants. That could only mean one thing.
“Why, I-I
Draco narrowed his eyes. It was cold enough for his breath to freeze in the air, coming out in puffs; he was chilly even in his multiple layers. “Do you?”
Harry flushed. “Well, er, not anyone who would ever want to dance with me.”
“On the floor,” Harry replied, humiliated. God, why did he think this was a good idea? Ron was a knight, someone of a much higher status than he--
“Alright, then. I’ll come get you at sundown, how does that sound?”
He breathed a sigh of relief as he walked the streets of his kingdom, appreciating the fresh air and the familiar, bustling sounds of the people. He waved to Neville Longbottom, the clumsy son of a fisherman, but continued walking. The two would usually make pleasant, mildly awkward conversation for a few moments but Harry was in no mood for small talk today.
Draco ran as fast as his feet could carry him.
He managed to get there in a few minutes. The moon was full, illuminating the scene in front of him. And sure enough, there was Harry, staring up into the endless sky like Draco had seen him do so many times before. Green, Draco thought for the hundredth time as he quietly took in Harry’s glowing features. He’d never seen eyes so green. As Harry continued craning his neck upwards, sloshing his feet about in the black water, Draco wondered if perhaps he was wishing for something, or flying somewhere else. Maybe he needed a broomstick.
“Bloody hell, that’s terrible. And you’ve been doing that your whole life?”
“Erm. Yeah?”
“Shown me how to be a decent human being?” Before Harry could stammer out a reply, Draco continued. “I regret nothing. And although it’s rather obvious, I suppose this needs saying.” Draco tried in vain to keep his voice steady and failed. “I...am...absurdly attracted to you, Potter. Someone of my blood status feeling this way is unheard of, but I figure there’s no use in denying it, i-is there?”
Draco looked down. “Never-mind. Go on.”
Vernon’s eyes widened. “That Squib? What could you possibly want from him?!”
Draco was positively beaming. His eyes, normally sunken and sad, shone brighter than anything Harry had ever seen. He donned his usual attire (Harry found that he’d gotten rather used to Draco’s unexceptional disguise) and wore heeled boots.
Harry simpered, eyes twinkling. “Sure, Draco.” He swam towards him with quick and graceful strokes, revelling in Draco’s look of wonder.
"What exactly is in this bag?” Draco said, wrinkling his nose in disgust, “It smells absolutely revolting.”
“What do you mean--” Ronda and ‘Mione said in unison.
“A-Alright, darling boy. Gold it is. Whatever you’d like.”
Draco sniffed proudly.  looking down at Harry with false contempt. “Excellent. I could use the company, even if it is from a good-nothing-squib such as yourself.”
“Sorry, Hermione.”
“That’s it?” Harry asked. “Just ‘alright’?”
Malfoy scowled and handed the Muggle device back to him. “Don’t patronize me, Potter.”
“He’s insisted that I hold a ball to search for the proper partner who will keep our bloodline pure and powerful.”
“Oh, yeah,” Harry mumbled, feeling awkward now. He seemed to forget that Hermione was a Muggleborn. Hermione didn’t seem fazed, however; her glossed lips still formed a gentle smile.
“No, I don’t. Take your money and go. I hope you’ve brought towels,” Harry said. Draco reminded him of a soaked cat, droplets of water sliding down his abdomen and leaving dark spots on the dirt below.
“Oi!” Ron couldn’t help but bark out a laugh, placing an arm around his girlfriend’s shoulders.
Fuck. Draco sure knew how to get Harry going.
Malfoy sighed, looking at Harry through long eyelashes. His skin was a flawless, milky ivory that left Harry a bit breathless. “Of course I did well. I’m a Malfoy.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’ll take care of you,” Harry whispered into Draco’s ear. The blond man shivered, clinging to Harry for dear life, as Harry lined himself up with his entrance. He pushed the tip in, growling at the softness of Draco’s body around him. Harry sighed, fighting back the urge to thrust into Draco all at once.
And oh, how Draco resented that politeness.
Hermione clapped a hand over Harry’s mouth and then Ron was yanking him into the bushes. Harry would have cussed, called Ron every name in the book, if it wasn’t for the fact that his mouth was still blockaded. He had half a mind to lick Hermione’s hand, but before he could do so she began speaking in frantic whispers:
Ron’s red eyebrows knit together. “What do you mean?”
Harry smirked, lubing up his cock and groaning at the much-needed friction. Draco squirmed at the sight, gaze fixated on Harry’s length, and licked his lips.
Anyway, I hope this chapter was satisfying!! Prepare yourself for some forbidden love angst and a plot twist next chapter...the story only has about 3-4 chapters left. There may be some bumps in the road but remember, it's a fairy tale, so there will be a happy ending. Thank you for reading and sticking with us! <3
“Y-You...fools, all of you. Potter, I’ll report you to my father for harassment!”
Scorpius stuck his tongue out at Draco and Harry smirked. One point for him. “I think that’s great, Little Bug. I think we can manage that, can’t we darling?”
Potter chuckled and Draco’s breath caught in his throat. The other man’s voice had gotten deeper, raspier even, since they had last spoken properly, and that laugh was...well, it made Draco queasy.
Ron deflated at her words. “Why? Isn’t this supposed to be a place for everyone?”
“We...we did not think a useless boy such as him was worth worrying about, surely you agree Your Highness, his magic is--”
The look on his face as he wiped a fleck of mud off of his porcelain chest had to have been one of the funniest things Harry had seen in his entire existence. Suddenly Harry was laughing like he hadn’t in ages. He laughed, and laughed, loose and free. I’ve forgotten how nice this is, Harry thought briefly before finally catching his breath. He opened his eyes to Draco staring intently at him, mystified.
Harry swallowed thickly; it’d been so long since they’d had enough alone time to do this, and he felt just as desperate as Draco was acting. Without any gentleness, Harry shoved two more fingers into Draco, who took them like a chant. He whimpered, pushing his hips up.
“You need some help there?” Harry asked, snickering. Draco glared at him and Harry couldn’t help but laugh. “Very intimidating. Thanks for this, by the way.”
“Good eye. Could’ve belonged to her parents as well.”
Draco stood his ground, staring pointedly at the rather obnoxious knight blocking his path.
“Er...yeah. My magic. It’s back. I think. How did you know?”
“That’s called ‘ringing’,” Potter was smirking-- he seemed to be thoroughly amused by Draco’s ignorance. “Put it up against your ear and listen.”
Harry blinked a few times, mind blank, and then the dam broke.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Potter. You’ve...successfully aided me today. I must insist on paying you.”
“Nothing, nothing,” Harry patronized. “Let’s just get this class over with.”
“I would never--”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You love it.”
Light snow is blowing about and the sky is grey and endless. Draco’s hand is heavy in his; a welcome weight.
“What brings you here, my son? Have you made your decision?”
Harry was quiet for a moment. “Hmm. That’s good, I suppose.”
“Y’know, for being a sheltered Pansy, you’re pretty good at sex.”
“Lovely,” He groaned as he took the room in. There was one twin bed with stained sheets in the corner, a single decrepit rocking chair across from it, and a wardrobe missing one of its drawers. This was a nightmare.
Harry placed his hands on Draco’s cheeks, pulling him in once again, and for the first time in his entire miserable existence, he was home.
“Tell me, Potter. Or should I say, ‘Squib’. Are you...certain...that your magic has dissipated?”
“Good to meet you. And it’s Ron, by the way. Granger over here doesn’t understand nicknames.”
Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.
“S-Shut...shut up, Potter! I don’t need you to--”
Harry stood up, brushing his hands on his trousers, and made a show of unbuckling them. Draco visibly swallowed, eyes flitting back and forth over various areas of Harry’s body. He cleared his throat and turned around, ears slightly pink.
“Oh,” Harry replied stupidly. “Yeah. Your kicking is off again. Last time I was just trying to keep you from drowning but now I think you’re good, so. You’re just flopping your legs around so you can stay afloat. That’s why you’re not getting anywhere.”
“Hello, Ron. Hello, Hermione,” Harry said, grinning. Hermione seemed delighted at his presence as usual, waving and uttering an enthusiastic: “Hello, Harry!” Ron smiled and mumbled a quick “Hello” of his own. Harry joined the pair at a table. In front of them was a giant pile of books without covers; most were incredibly tattered and poorly bound.
The severity of Harry’s confession seemed to sink in, then. Draco’s mouth fell open.
Harry said nothing, eyes huge. Draco figured he was flushing, though the dim night muted it.
Harry cut him off, placing his large hands on the back of Draco’s head and pulling him in for a rough, uncoordinated kiss. His lips were warm, and they slotted against Draco’s perfectly; he instantly craved more of it. Draco's prayers were answered immediately when Harry deepened the kiss, curling his fingers at the base of Draco’s neck, and sighed. Draco shuddered at the rush of Harry’s breath against his cheek, and Harry smirked against his hair. Draco made an embarrassing noise (how could that even have came from him?) when Harry slipped a hand under Draco’s thick robes and began tracing his fingers across the pale skin of his abdomen.
Before the two could sit in an awkward silence for too long, Kingsley walked to his desk and took a seat in front of him. His gaze was intense-- sad, even.
Malfoy snatched the shoe back with unnecessary force and Harry just barely caught a glimpse of  the blond’s shaky hands. He pointed with one long-nailed finger.
“Good, Draco. So fucking gorgeous,” Harry mumbled almost drunkenly, and Draco couldn’t take it anymore, all he could think about was how Harry would feel inside of him, how full he’d be.
“What now?” He snaps, eyes as sharp and cold as the slippery ice beneath their feet. Harry, after all these years, is unfazed.
“Everyone except obnoxiously loud knights like yourself.”
“PLEASE! LEAVE MY MOTHER ALONE, KILL ME. JUST KILL ME! PLEASE, KILL ME!” Malfoy was looking through Harry, true panic in his moonlit eyes. Harry panicked and backed away until Malfoy grabbed his hand with such force that Harry’s fingers throbbed.
“He’s lost it. Your father has lost it.”
Harry’s magic had returned.
They kept this up for a few moments, still-clothed bodies pressed impossibly close to each other in desperation.
“Excuse me?” The blonde man asked, looking stunned.
Draco seemed to soak up the praise as he kissed Harry with growing enthusiasm. Harry took this opportunity to nibble Draco's lips. He drank in his boyfriend's responding squeak of surprise and pulled him close. He could feel Draco's heart beat even through his thick robes.
“What?! What are you guys doing here, what’s the matter? You’ve never been to my house before--”
“Fair enough. Shall we get to work? Kingsley seems to think you’ll have some helpful insight, yeah?”
“Huh?”
“How do you think they found us here, then?” Harry said softly, voice wavering. “Look, Draco, they're going to kill me. I know that. But I don't regret this. You're the best damn thing that's ever happened to me.”
There's going to be an epilogue chapter coming by the end of the week, so stay tuned. I hope you guys enjoyed this ending.
“You're beautiful, you know.”
Draco realized then that he himself hadn’t the faintest idea what day it was. He flushed and folded in on himself slightly, shame and embarrassment creeping in-- that was until Potter began to laugh. The sound seemed to bubble up from somewhere deep below and explode out of him-- a warm rumbling that Draco wanted to bottle up and save for rainy days. It was almost painful when Draco felt his own grimace twist into something resembling a smile.
“Wh--No! Of course not, Potter, you imbecile--”
Draco was not an insatiable teenager anymore and he was not about to start wanking in his office. He would absolutely not sink so low.
Draco was silent for a moment. He sighed, sitting up languidly. “Alright, alright! I’ll go find him! But I’ll order Father to behead you if this makes things worse.”
Soon, Harry was lost in the music. The Prince’s muted perfume and gentle, repetitive melodies lulled him into some sort of stupor; soon the absurdly grandiose clock above him chimed eleven-thirty. He was startled when the Prince leaned impossibly closer, mouth ghosting against the shell of Harry’s ear, and whispered: “Follow me”.
Harry raises an eyebrow. “Oh?”
“And how do you know what that old hag looks like in her night clothes? Do you fancy older women?”
“Look, I...I know you want me to shut up. It’s just. You’re kind, Draco. And good. I wouldn’t want...erm, I wouldn’t want to be with anyone else. And I want to make sure you know that.”
“I-Yes. I couldn’t seem to...I couldn’t seem to let myself dispose of it. Would you like it back?”
“See you, Harry.”
“For the fiftieth time today, lowly servant: Shut. Up.”
Despite the intense urge to run away and go lock himself away for eternity, Harry maintained eye contact and nodded.
“I don’t give a rat’s arse about the law, I won’t go.”
Harry raised his eyebrows.
“Potter!” Draco shouted, bounding towards him with an almost frightening excitement. He was so close, so suddenly, and Harry was momentarily lost in the deep grey of his irises. “Your magic!”
“You can look if you’d like. But I guarantee you won’t find it.”
Draco growled, “I’m not crying!”
“Well I suppose that’s a start. Kick harder, stronger. Don’t be so dainty about it.”
“It’s...important,” Harry said a bit helplessly.
“Huh?” Harriet asked, still in a daze from the lingering smell of Draca’s perfume. It had smelled expensive, and sweet. “Oh. Er, we aren’t.”
“Think we’ll catch them?” Potter asked through a yawn. Draco tried and failed to keep his eyes away from Potter’s seemingly sizable...package.
He didn’t sink.
Harry had turned around and made his way over to Draco, suddenly determined. Before Draco could so much as utter a word, Harry had bent over him, one hand on each arm of the chair. His nose was almost brushing Draco’s as he peered down at him, resolute.
Potter opened the door for him-- a gesture that made Malfoy wrinkle his nose in distaste-- and the two entered. The smell of fresh butterbeer had Draco salivating; it had been his favorite back at Hogwarts. Various witches and wizards, some dressed in rags and others dressed in pristine robes, clinked glasses and laughed together. People soon began to whisper, pointing and nudging in the direction of The Boy Who Lived, and Draco suddenly felt very alone. After a moment, he gave into the temptation to take a look at Potter, who was already shaking hands with a grey-haired witch. Draco truly resented Potter’s fame. That was, until he caught a glimpse of his fine arse in those suit pants. Draco shook his head and walked towards Potter and the witch. He cleared his throat.
Before Draco could question him, Lucius continued speaking. “You will be married tomorrow morning. I’ve gathered our finest scribes to craft the invitations and our most skilled chefs to cater. The celebration shall be grand, Draco. I’ve decided to invite commoners as...compensation for my previous doubts.”
“No, I don’t!” Harry snapped, turning away from Draco and crossing his arms defiantly. “And if you don’t like it then you can get the hell out of here and find someone else who will deal with your incessant whining.”
“I am. Thank you, Draco,” Harry said, suddenly sincere, and Draco’s face immediately softened.
Harry,
Harry turned around and looked at Malfoy strangely.  The way Harry’s name fell from his tongue was acidic, so eerily similar to how he had sounded when they were teenagers. “Would you like help with that?”
“Yes, Uncle Vernon?”
“Don’t be silly, Potter. I can do it myself,” Draco muttered, averting his gaze and wrenching himself away from Harry’s grasp with an absurdly dramatic flair.
Harry found it ironic that the Royal Family had the last name Malfoy. Perhaps Draco really was a distant relative of them after all. Harry snorted at the thought.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Do you really want my advice or do you just want to cry on me?”
“If I  shove a stick up your arse, Ronda,maybe you’d learn to stop talking,” ‘Mione glared pointedly. Now it was Harry’s turn to laugh.
Harry rolled his eyes, grasped Draco’s shirt collar, and kissed him with everything he had. When he pulled away, he net Draco's wide eyes and sneered: “I look like a beggar? What about you? Wearing normal clothes must be killing you.”
Potter was silent for a moment. “Pardon? That’s a bit quick, don’t you think?”
“I was mocking you,” Harry sneered, overcome with fondness when Draco glared at him in response. Draco opened his mouth, probably to form an equally acidic comeback, but Harry seized the opportunity to capture his lips once again and slide his tongue between them. Draco’s taught body relaxed and he sighed, which was music to Harry’s ears.
If it had been anyone else Harry would have fought with everything he had, but the trust he had for his two new friends was unyielding. He nodded pathetically and Ron’s grip eased up on him at the same time Hermione took her hand away.
“You just-- for fuck’s, sake, Potter! You’re embarrassing yourself.” Draco’s heart was in his throat. Draco? Why the bloody hell had Potter thought to use his first name? He wanted to hear it on repeat, a recording to use as wank material, maybe--
Silence. Ron seemed to be calculating, eyebrows scrunched in confusion.  Hermione, on the other hand, was on the cusps of laughter; she was covering her mouth with her dark hand. “Harry,” She said. “That’s...incredible! I can't believe this!”
“Yeah, well. Not like I was at all prepared to have such an esteemed guest in my office today,” Harry pulled up a chair and shoved it towards Malfoy. “Sit.”
“Dunno. But I have it handled,” Ron said dismissively. Hermione looked towards Harry.
Draco, as ashamed as he was to be wearing such a ghastly ensemble, felt absurdly giddy. He was leading a flustered Potter deeper and deeper into the woods beyond the Weaselbies' house, making random twists and turns and cringing whenever his outerwear caught on a bramble. The sky above them was slowly fading from blue to a pink and orange gradient, bathing their eerie surroundings in a warm, honey-colored light. Harry’s green eyes, although muted by the dimness, were still striking.
“What the bloody hell are you on about, Potter?!”
“I like you, Harry. How come I haven’t seen you around before?”
Harry looked up, finally taking in Draco’s current state. Although he still wore one layer of undergarments, his legs were spread lewdly. Harry sighed at the beautiful image before him, shaking his head.
Draco colored, and Harry almost laughed out loud at how seriously he’d taken her. Harry had always admired how much respect Draco had for his mother. “No, no, of course not, I was just--”
“We’ll share it,” Potter said, before Malfoy could even get a word of protest in. “The Ministry will have the payment to you by tomorrow. You’ll be receiving an owl.”
“I believe so. But if you think we’re going to continue my lessons at a time like this, you’re surely mistaken--”
"Sure, sure," Harry taunted, ghosting the pad of his index finger over Draco's entrance. Draco took a sharp intake of breath, wriggling slightly,and Harry idly wondered how they were going to pull this off on such a small armchair. He couldn't bring himself to move Draco, however, not when he was staring up at Harry so beautifully .
“Thanks.”
“Hmm…” Harry began, barking out another laugh at Draco’s horrified expression. “Kidding, kidding. Of course I have.”
“Well. I’ll see you soon, there.” Draco said, pulling Harry out of his own head.
“No. You look like a -- I dunno, like McGonagall in her nightclothes.” Potter continued cracking up at his own joke.
“I’ve suspected that The Prince would be showing up any day now. The King would never let him come find Harry, of course, considering Harry’s a wanted man and also scum in His eyes.”
And yet, he had an aching need to show up and prove to* ...what was his name again? Potter) that he was superior than him in more ways than just status; he was born better, and he would surpass him in even something he didn’t quite know how to do yet. But there was also...a fondness? Something about Potter’s uncivil behavior towards him  made his stomach flop,  made him feel...normal. Not that being normal is a good thing, he thought as he stripped off his satin pajamas and began to dress himself.
“Merlin,” Ron seemed to calm down, then, and he smiled. “All the more reason for you to enjoy a fancy night, then.”
“Do not ask me to repeat things, Draco.”
Draco looked puzzled as he continued kicking his feet sporadically. “What do I do?”
“Get in the water? Is that the only advice you have for me?”
“Bugger off, Hermione. I’m fine,” Harry said, shrugging his friend’s hand away. “It’s just...something I’ve noticed.”
“Well,” Harry said as he demonstrated. “You need to use your arms, too. Don’t let them just fly around or you’re going to stay in place. And you need to close your fingers so you can push the water away from you and gain speed.”
“Do NOT call me Draco.”
“Do you mean to tell me that that's the main objective of this lesson?” Draco asked incredulously and mildly horrified.
“It’s absolutely appalling. Kingsley couldn’t find us anywhere more...tasteful?” Draco said.
“Who’s the Prince?’ Hermione and Ron asked simultaneously.
“C’mon, I’ll help you out.”
“Hmm?” Harry asked devilishly, hands tracing the hot outline of Draco’s cock through his velvet trousers. “Please what?”
Draco sputtered. “A Malfoy never backs down from a promise, I’ll have you know! Now teach me, Potter.”
“You’ll be useless while you’re like this,” Draco managed to breathe out, every muscle in his body tense. The desire to lean in, to be flush against Potter’s warm body, was overwhelming.
The knight cast a furtive glance in the direction of the King, who nodded at him.
The intrusive thought hit Draco like a freight train. He’d had Crabbe and Goyle, sure, but they’d never actually given two fucks about him. He’d had a painful realization a few years back that they really only spent so much time with him under the direction of their fathers. Pansy had been good to him--well, she’d tried to be. But she had gone the moment the War ended. They all had.
“Hush, Draco darling,” Narcissa cooed, tucking a strand of hair behind Draco’s ear. “I won’t allow your father to partner you with someone unworthy.”
“You’re just...you. And I’m glad for that.”
Potter snorted. “Excellent feedback. ‘Night.” He rolled over, facing away from Malfoy now, and pulled the covers up to his chin. All Draco could see now was a messy head of black hair. Something akin to warmth bloomed in Draco’s chest for a moment before reminding himself that he and Potter were not, and never would be, friends.
Harry woke up still dressed in his fancy clothes, which were now squashed and wrinkled in awkward places. When did I fall asleep? He thought as he yawned and threaded his fingers through his tangled mop of hair.
“You’re bloody ridiculous. Now get out.”
“I-I...um. I’ve chosen a boy named Harry Potter. A...a servant.”
Draco crossed his arms and huffed. “Fine! Your advice, I want it. Give me your damned advice.”
He abruptly fucked into Draco, who cried out in relief. He thrust into Draco exactly how he knew he’d like it; all force and power. It only took a few thrusts for Draco to lose all of his control, calling out Harry’s name like a dying man. Harry, engulfed in the softness of Draco’s body, barely registered the sharpness of Draco’s nails digging into his back.
Harry snorted, still avoiding Draco’s gaze. “You’re not wrong.”
“Fine!” And then he plunged in, all flailing limbs and white light.
There was that laugh again-- the most incredible sound Malfoy had ever heard.  Then Potter sighed. He sunk down and rested his head on the desk, eyes falling closed. Draco, just half a foot from him, could not tear his gaze away. Potter’s breathing began evening out as he fell deeper into his slumber. His dark eyelashes were long and curled. Draco reached out his hand, almost touching Potter’s hair, before yanking it away and mentally chastising himself. Fucking damnit.
“I know he’s not. I could sense his magic from a mile away. I just like to rile you up. Now, if you’ve finished interrogating me about my romantic endeavors, I’ll leave you to go track down...what was his name? Perry?”
“No!” Harry yelled, and Draco winced slightly. “Of course I want to marry you, you imbecile! What happened to your crippling narcissism all of a sudden?”
“Ronda!” ‘Mione hissed, placing two large, dark hands on his hips. “Stop it, you’ll only make things worse.”
“Well, Potter, say something!”
His mind was so busy processing the erratic beating of his own heart that he failed to notice the sudden silence of the dance hall. Once he finally gathered the courage to tear his gaze away from the marble floor, however, he was shocked to see that all eyes were on him. Is it because I’m late? Harry thought dazedly as he scanned the room. He couldn’t see Draco and his heart sunk; perhaps he had decided not to come after all. One figure, however, did stand out to him. The Prince stood in the middle of the hall, turned towards Harry. He wore a navy blue masquerade mask and matching robes that fit his slender frame excellently, and his blond hair was slicked back behind his ears. The same shade as Draco’s, Harry thought. The Prince was dancing with a young lady in a fluffy purple dress until Harry met his eyes. He seemed to freeze, then, and immediately released the purple-dress girl and began walking towards Harry, who suddenly could not move his legs. Why would he be coming over here? Harry thought, stunned. He realized with a start that he should probably bow, so he began to bend his knees; however the Prince held up a gloved hand indicating that he stop at once.
“DRACO!”
Harry was confused, but grateful. Perhaps he had lit the fire and forgotten? He sighed contentedly, rolling around in his blankets and smiling. He breathed in the scent of burning wood, a welcome odor, and his chest bloomed with happiness. What a fantastic night, he thought, immediately seizing the opportunity. Harry fetched the copy of his book from under the dusty velvet sofa. He had been hiding it there for months, Uncle Vernon would never approve and Dudley would burn it up, and so far he had not been caught. The novel was old and yellowing, with a rusty red cover and loose binding. The Tale of the Deathly Hallows.
Ron’s indignant huff blew a bright strand of hair in front of his eyes. Harry grinned.
“What?!” Draco said, sudden panic squeezing his insides. “I won't let them! And we've put plenty of charms on the tent, haven't we?! They won't see us!”
“Don’t say that to Dad, Dadda! Be nice!” Scorpius' voice was small, but stern. At the tender age of three, Scorpius was already becoming a carbon copy of Draco, who allowed himself to smile this time. It was bloody contagious; soon the three of them were giggling like fools. Draco scooped Scorpius up, and he screeched in delight. “My little Prince,” Draco hummed, squishing his son's chubby cheek. “What do you want for your fourth birthday? A house? A stallion? A--”
“Will you keep quiet, you insolent fool? I’m actually spending my time doing something useful, unlike you.”
“Probably for the best,” Hermione said sadly, taking a swig of her fresh butterbeer.
It was so still, so quiet, that when Draco was rudely awoken by the shouts of his father's knights he practically went into cardiac arrest. He sat up immediately, as did Harry, who was looking at him with wide, fearful eyes.
“Shut it. I know I am. You're lucky to have me--”
Harry shrugged and took a swig of his butterbeer, grinning suddenly. “So does Hermione.”
As Harry threw some wood into the fire and began cooking what would be a very mediocre breakfast (just because he was a servant didn’t mean he had to be a very good one) he imagined what his life might have become if he hadn’t lost his magic. Would he have been respected by Vernon and Dudley? Probably not. But maybe he wouldn’t be stuck sweeping the floors and cleaning up after his pig of a stepbrother. Perhaps he would have made something of himself--Maybe he’d even be training to become an auror.
And so, Harry was pleasantly surprised when he heard a stone bounce off of his chamber window that night. He rushed downstairs, booming footsteps disrupting the silent evening. He yanked the door open only to be greeted by a very-fancy Ron. He donned a sparkling, golden placard engraved with a grand “M” and glittering gauntlets.
Kingsley Shacklebolt
Potter snorted. “Why am I not surprised? Lucky for you, I won’t fight you on it. I’ve slept on much worse.”
“I won’t fight with you anymore,” Harriet said, hoarse and determined. “I won’t.” Harriet ghosted her hand along the inside of Draca’s smooth thigh. Oh, how Harriet wished she could take these robes off. But they had a class next period.
“Malfoy,” Harry said politely. Malfoy nodded back but said nothing, gaze still cast downwards. Harry took a seat in the chair beside him and Malfoy noticeably tensed. Merlin, Harry wasn’t going to hex him or something. “How’ve you been?”
Harry flushed and crossed his arms, eyeing Draco up and down. “I, erm. I should go get dressed.”
It was obvious that he had, being that his hands were still glowing with...something, but Harry didn’t feel as though he could have done such a thing. How could he, probably a Squib, have caused so much destruction without a wand? He shook his head, trying to quiet the ringing in his ears, to no avail. He supposed that he’d be executed even sooner now as punishment for causing such damage. Although that’s probably a good thing, he thought. I won’t have time to wallow in my self pity.
If Harriet’s eyebrows could have risen any higher, they would have been floating in mid air. “Okay, and what are you going to tell him exactly? That I didn’t fall to my knees and beg for your approval like all of your other kiss-arse friends?”
“How did you know?” He asked incredulously. Hermione grinned, pleased at his reaction.
“I’ll show you too casual!”
“To find you, obviously,” Hermione mumbled groggily. Ron grimaced, having realized he’d woken her.
“Don't make me repeat myself.” Draco snapped. Harry was nonplussed.
“You can check out anything you like, Harry. As long as you bring it back,” Hermione said rather sternly. Harry laughed.
“Of course I can. You don’t really think I’d allow myself to be trapped in this wretched tent in the middle of the wilderness without necessities, do you?” Draco swished his wand a few times, pointing it towards a cracked teacup resting on the table. The cup turned to unblemished porcelain in an instant.
There was something in Draco’s tone and ridiculous mannerisms that hit Harry like a freight train. The acidity was merely an act, a defense mechanism, and it made Harry’s chest ache with something he was only just beginning to identify. Harry pondered this foreign emotion for a moment. Could it be that he actually had feelings for this brat? This absurdly lovable, attractive brat? Dread clouded Harry’s head at the realization. Why? Harry thought ruefully. Of all people, why him? Draco would never, ever feel the same way. Not only did class factor into it, but sexuality did as well. Draco probably had no interest in other men. Not that he would ever go for a servant like Harry if he did. Harry realized with a start that he had not yet responded to Draco’s retort; this could have been why the other boy was staring at him expectedly.
“No!”
“What? What caused this? Was anyone hurt?”
“Shall we go, then?”
“Fuck,” Harriet swore, pressing against Draca. Their moans were soon filling the lavatory, echoing off of the walls, and Harriet silently thanked Merlin that Moaning Myles was busy somewhere else for once.
“My deepest most sincere apologies, Sire,” She said, rolling her deep brown eyes playfully and walking alongside Draco. “Where are you headed?”
“Draco! We were...you know, doing stuff in the hallway and I took the Prince’s mask off and it was...yeah!”
“I’ll get right on that,” Harry said, turning around and walking quickly towards the kitchen. Perhaps he had gotten away?
“I saved your life, dumbass.”
“Never,” Harry said with a smile, chest warm with an everlasting fondness for his fellow King.
Draco’s mouth opened and then closed. He raised a finger, almost as if he was about to scold Harry, but settled for crossing his arms instead. “I presume you’ve changed your mind about me?”
“Disrespectful lowlife,” Draco grumbled as he stepped out of his robes. Harry, ironically out of respect, turned his head. Draco did not seem to mind, however, being as he stepped in front of Harry in all of his shirtless glory the moment he had finished stripping. Thankfully, he was wearing a fancy bathing costume; deep green shorts with white trim. They fit him rather...well, and it took all of Harry’s self control not to curse under his breath. As obnoxious and prissy as this man was, Harry had to admit that he was simply gorgeous.
Draco laughed humorlessly. “And why would you? Let’s get back to work, shall we?”
Ron snorted. “You have The Prince himself waiting in my living room and you want to make him wait?”
“Prince Malfoy,” One of the knights said, kneeling in front of Draco and obscuring his view of Harry. “Your father has requested that you return home at once.”
“Generation after generation of the Malfoy Family, those worthy of the throne, have worn this ring with pride. The thought of passing it on to you sickens me.” Lucius continued, every insidious word causing Draco's chest to constrict. “You’re forbidden from seeing this Potter boy again. If you weren't my only heir, I would have you banished.”
Malfoy grimaced. He clearly did not want to be spoken to. “Alright, I suppose.”
“I suppose,” Draco said, looking miffed. Draco fingered a still-damp ornately embroidered sleeve.
“No, Father, you know I would never jest about such a thing. Please, I...I love him,” Draco was surprised at his own words but even more surprised at how natural it was for him to say them.
Draco smiled wickedly, clasping his willowy hands together. “So you’ll come?”
“How dare you!” Blondie sneered, refusing to budge from his place in front of Harry.
“Leave me,” He snapped, and the knocking stopped abruptly.
“What do you want?” Harry asked with faux-sweetness.
“Alright, alright, I get it. I'm going to kiss you now, so get off me.”
Harry was more alert now, mind spinning in confusion. The living room was always freezing at night, without fail, but tonight Harry felt warm and...cozy? He hadn’t felt cozy in years.
Ron nodded in agreement, expression sharp and determined. The three stood up, brushing leaves and dirt off of their clothes, and they were off.
The rest of the night consisted of merriment and laughs, recounting old Hogwarts stories and reminiscing. Harry, though pleased to see his friends, found that he couldn't stop his thoughts from wandering to the other man upstairs. What was Draco doing up there, exactly? How did he look sitting at that old desk? He would stand out quite a bit, Harry thought absently. Such an affluent-looking man sitting at a rickety old desk.
Harry raised an eyebrow. “Is that what they’re calling swimming nowadays. Sorry, but that looked more like drowning to me.”
“U-Um, well. I’m a Muggleborn, you know. I would get kicked out.”
“POTTER!”
“Of course you do.”
“It was nice to see you again, Harry,” Hermione said with a gentle hand on her hip.
“I know who did this.”
“You do that a lot?”
Harry reddened. “Doubt it. But thanks.”
After Vernon had forgotten Harry and his letter, he turned to Dudley who was staring down at the paper in disgust, nose scrunched. “I won’t go, father!”
“Are you two going to the ball?”
Ronda and ‘Mione stood at her side. Ronda’s freckled face was turning pinker at every one of Draca’s snickers; her straight, orange hair paled in comparison to her cheeks. ‘Mione stood still as a statue, jaw clenched; Draca observed how tightly his fists were clenched at his sides.
Draco rolled his eyes, grumbling under his breath about “incompetent squibs”, and pulled out his wand. It was dark and smooth, probably crafted from hawthorn wood; it fit Draco perfectly. He flicked it with a graceful wrist, and a modest tent materialized before them. Harry rose his eyebrows, impressed.
“I’m not dainty, you scum!”
“More,” Draco begged, attempting to shove himself farther onto Harry’s cock immediately, without an adjustment period. Through his cloudy lust, Harry had the mental image of Draco fingering himself, calling Harry’s name. God, Draco’s desperation was going to be the death of him.
This continued throughout the entire journey. Girls blushed and giggled as he passed by and many men dropped to their knees and bowed. As satisfying as this was, however, Draco felt a fleeting pang of concern that someday Potter would see this, would figure out who he was. He was not entirely sure why that bothered him, so he shrugged and continued on his way.
“I don’t know!” Draco snapped before he could stop himself. Any excuse to tear away his gaze, to distract him from the sound of his last name on Potter’s tongue. “They’re clever, these two. Could be anywhere.”
“He’s not a Squib, Pansy!”
“Why don’t you follow me and see for yourself instead of asking increasingly dimwitted questions?” Draco challenged flatly as he lifted the entrance flap and stepped inside.
The Prince said nothing; he just stood there, shadowed eyes boring into Harry’s own. Although Harry was beginning to find this behavior rather strange, he did not have time to dwell on the matter for the Prince had grabbed his collar, hands trembling with what Harry could only describe as sheer want. Merlin, Harry thought as he stared at the man in front of him, awestruck.
THIS CHAPTER WAS SO FUN TO WRITE BA DA BOOM, HARRY KNOWS DRACO'S THE PRINCEE!!!!!!!! And the fanfic is finally starting to live up to its rating lol. Prepare yourself for smut soon. Also, in case you can't tell by now, I love torturing readers with cliffhangers.
Vernon looked as though he was actually considering this idea, forehead wrinkling in thought, and Harry felt a flicker of hope.
Harry raised an eyebrow, grinning at the realization. “Oh? Is that why you’ve suddenly become dumb as a door-nail?”
Draco seemed to realize how enthusiastic his reaction had been, cheeks coloring as his face returned to its usual hardness. “Er, I mean. I’m pleased to have found you here, Potter.”
“She’s right, you know,” Ron said. “He wants you.”
He sat for a moment, eyes flitting between the mountain of paperwork and his own shaky palms. He stood up stiffly and locked his office door.
Harry adjusted the bandanna on his forehead, trying to keep as many stray black hairs out of his face as possible. He struggled but to no avail; he could not tame his ever-present bed head. Sighing, he returned back to the gargantuan task of cleaning Dudley’s room. He was about halfway through after spending four endless hours on it yesterday. On the left side of the room, Harry could now see the ornate purple carpet lining the floor, although it had a few stains that Harry had not been able to get out. The other half of the room was still trash hell. Piles of rubbish, dirty clothes, broken toys, and half-read books lined the floor. Trying to breathe through his mouth to avoid the pungent odors coming from the piles of mess, Harry grimly set himself to work.
“Yes,” Harry says, voice suddenly hard and honest. “I am.”
“Draco…” Harry whispered, voice almost swept away by the wind.
“I trust that you’ve chosen well. Tell me, Draco.”
“No!” Harry said, somewhat appalled. “They can’t kick you out, the Prince declared that everyone of any status is to be invited!”
“Are you finished?” Draco asked pointedly.
“Shh, it’s alright, you idiot. I understand,” His voice was low, musical almost, and Draco's chest ached. “But I won't give up, I hope you know that. Magic or not.”
Harry stared, wide-eyed, as a frantic Ron and Hermione came to a halt before him, blocking his path. Ron’s face was red with overexertion and a bead of sweat trickled down Hermione’s smooth skin.
“Not bad? Not bad?! Are you bloody kidding me? It’s fucking freezing!” He bellowed.
Draco’s legs were spread lewdly, and Harry groaned at the sight. “You’re always so pretty for me, aren’t you?”
“Beg for it.”
A beat of silence, and then:
Draco gasped when Harry placed a kiss against his neck, gentle but somehow dirtier than anything Draco had experienced. Harry was smiling against him, he could feel it, and damn him for being such a smug arsehole about this--
He continued on, taking in the brick buildings and various street vendors practically begging for his business, until he reached the worn-down establishment that was the kingdom’s center of knowledge. Little actually knew that this building existed, and the select few who did treated it as some kind of sanctuary. The library was special. Harry would always see the same people there, the same faces, reading the same genres of books.
“Did you wear these for me?” She asked breathlessly, moving her fingers in small circles. Draca said nothing, but pressed against Harriet’s hand eagerly.
HERE YOU GO, FOLKS. Shameless porn. But that's not all ;)
Draco’s eyes narrowed. “Let me see them.”
“Father, you can’t be serious,” Draco said, handing the invitation back to him. “This is ridiculous.”
“Look, he...he isn’t a Squib, I can tell. Pansy agrees with me. He’s just...there’s something wrong, he can’t use it!”
“Lemme see these.”
“No. I haven’t. This type of...chore isn’t for someone of my status,” Draco said, picking up the muddy shirt and dipping it in the river once again.
“Cat got your tongue, Potter? Never met a gay man before?”
“He thinks I’m a liar! He already thinks I’m a stuck-up ponce as it is, now I’ve just gone and made things worse!”
“There’s twenty-nine more.”
Draco felt something akin to excitement. Curious.
Harry Potter could not sleep either that night.
“ 'Spose they do. Uh, come in,” Harry said, cringing. “I’m afraid it’s pretty ghastly in here.”
Harriet waited for a few moments so as to avoid suspicion, and then made her way out of the classroom, shadowing the remaining students. After the coast was clear, she stealthily made her way to the unused lavatory down the hall, where she hoped pathetically that Draca was waiting for her.
“Hello there! Looking for a drink or a place to stay?”
“What are you smirking about?” Draco said breathily as Harry began trailing kisses down his neck.
Harriet felt Draca tighten around her fingers at the same time she was pushed over the edge. For a blissful moment, Harriet’s climax clouded her mind with sheer relief and pleasure. Draca writhed against her, gasping for breath, as she too shook with her release.
“I think I understand, now,” Harriet said, eyes locked on Draca’s. Draca backed up, chin raised high, until her small body was flush with the bathroom stall.
“Mm,” Harry mumbled, threading his fingers through Malfoy’s hair again. “Are you sure?”
Draco laughed, genuine and light, tracing his fingers against Harry’s exposed chest. “You really are an idiot.”
Before Harry could force his incompetent brain to reply, Draco continued, voice wavering. “I...I understand that you probably wouldn’t want to marry me, of all people. I’m a snob. And I’m petty. Not nearly as powerful as you are. I suppose I just thought...it’s alright, I can tell father that--”
"I...I suppose it can," Draco mumbled, suddenly a blushing virgin. Harry chucked throatily.
“Hello, Mother,” Draco said, embracing her and kissing her on the cheek. She wore flowing, black velvet robes and her white and black hair was laced with light streaks of grey. Her lips were painted a dark shade of rouge.
“S-Sure,” Neville said, looking rather dejected. Harry couldn’t bring himself to feel guilty; Neville could get his herbology books later. Hermione sighed but begrudgingly followed Harry and Ron outside. The air was warm and soupy, immediately making Harry a bit sleepy.
Draco looked down at himself and felt a rising sense of panic when he realized that he was still in his work suit. He couldn’t sleep in this. How was he supposed to change when Potter was standing right next to him, probably placing judgments and--
“He hates me, Pans, he hates me!” Draco moaned, head in his best friend’s lap. She twirled a silvery strand of his hair between her fingers.
“Yes, I do. Now listen. You need to use your legs. They aren’t just dead weight, you know. They’ll keep you afloat.”
Harry huffed out a breath and shook his head, but did as told. God, Harry thought as he wrapped his calloused hands around Draco’s white waist once again. His skin is so soft.
“Shut your mouth, commoner. Is Harry here?”
“Let’s get to bed then. Ah,” Potter raised his eyebrows when a small, tattered cot materialized in front of him. “Right on time.”
“Fine, I’ll teach you. It’s something to do other than laundry. You can meet me by the river. I do the laundry at noon there every Monday, Tuesday and Sunday.”
And then Draco really did cry, tears spilling over and leaving trails on his impeccable skin.
“Accio glasses,” Harry whispered, catching his spectacles in midair as they flew to him. Once he could see clearly enough to navigate through the dark Muggle bedroom, he dressed himself and set off to find the front door.
“Next time try not to be so damn clumsy, Draco.” Harry admonished. When there was no response Harry opened his eyes. “Draco?” “Draco!!!” He called, realizing that his new, pissy acquaintance was no longer present. He spotted Draco floundering in the middle of the river desperately, trying in vain to keep his head above water. Harry watched as Draco’s head dropped like a rock beneath the surface. Frantic with worry, Harry once again dove back into the river to save Draco. He grabbed hold of the blonde's heavy, now-still limbs and dragged his body slowly to the shore. Bending over, Harry tried to pump as much water out of the other boy’s lungs as possible, but when he still refused to wake, Harry resignedly mumbled, “I guess I’m gonna have to do it.”
“I see. That’s...admirable,” Harry said.
Pansy gave him one of her looks, that implied there was no way she was letting it go. She did drop it for the moment, though, but Draco heard her mumbling something about “unfairness and Draco deserving true love,” before she trounced off in a flurry of silk and gems.
“Hey!” Ron interjected. “I’m not lazy! You just work as fast as a deranged Niffler!”
“Whatever you say,” Harry continued, voice wavering only slightly. Draco did not seem to notice; he merely scowled at Harry for a few more moments.
Harry obeyed. He walked into the kitchen, shed his rags, and dressed himself in the fancy robes. After conquering the seemingly endless amount of buttons, Harry succeeded. He marvelled at the feel of the soft material on his skin and moved his limbs around; it was tight, but not unbearable. He caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror above the sink; he looked...fancy. Rich. Good. He walked out into the living room, feeling more handsome than he’d ever had, and Ron gave him two thumbs up.
“You should to teach me to swim,” he said abruptly.
Woohoo! This was a super super long chapter, hopefully made up for the last one! I really hope you guys enjoyed this, uGH I LOVE WRITING THIS!!! It is so so so much fun for me. I introduced Ron, I hope you guys like how I write him! He's such a cute lil dork and i love him. Thank you for reading and sticking with us, please tell us what you think!
Harry grumbled and only pulled Draco closer. “Stay,” he said, voice gravelly, and so fucking sexy that Draco shivered again, a pang of arousal muddling his senses further despite the fact that he’d just came.
“Er, alright,” Harry muttered, avoiding Draco’s eyes. God, this was humiliating.
Time was different, wrong even; but Harry’s body was strangely relaxed. It felt as though a heavy boulder have been lifted off of him both mentally and physically, like he was free of a dark, malignant illness that he’d been unaware of until this moment. Could it be that he... ? Harry shook his head, which was pounding rhythmically. His magic couldn’t have returned, not now, not after so long.
“Don’t...make me ask you, Potter,” Draco said in an attempt to preserve some of his dignity. Harry only laughed, sitting up and removing himself from Draco in a swift movement.
“I’m on duty, Harry. I’m helping Mr. Longbottom here find our top selections on Herbology,” Hermione said sternly. And sure enough, there was Neville, waving awkwardly at Harry and struggling to hold his huge pile of books in the process. Harry nodded at him and turned his attention back to an agitated Hermione.
Malfoy’s eyes narrowed and he looked the chair up and down. He seemed to consider  protesting, opening his mouth for a moment and then closing it. He dusted off the chair with his hand and then sat down.
