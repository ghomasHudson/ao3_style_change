“What are you doing here? Malfoy, what happened?” Harry questioned hysterically. The other boy was black and blue and swollen, reminding him horribly of the corpses in the lake.  Malfoy winced, squeezing his eyes shut and drawing in a breath with difficulty. Harry could hear the liquid in his lungs gurgling as he just barely managed to sit up, swaying. He mumbled something nearly inaudible.
“So, what, are we the inter-house unity club now? What happened to hating all Slytherins?” His voice had taken on a pleading tone.
“Of course not! I just thought it was common courtesy to help someone who has obviously been beaten within an inch of his bloody life.” Harry knelt wasn’t Madam Pomfrey’s fault, but he couldn’t help the anger rising in him.
“Listen, Malfoy, I know you don’t like her, but she can help to make sure this doesn’t happen again. It isn’t right.” Draco’s head snapped up at that. Potter sounded like he almost… cared?
Malfoy was different. He saw that the tall boy stuck with Parkinson, Goyle, and Zabini at mealtimes, but Harry hadn’t seen him at all other than that. A wave of guilt passed over him as he realized that this was probably not the first time this had happened to the Slytherin.
He was pulled out of his thoughts by a group of younger students emerging from a classroom, looking right satisfied with themselves. They were a motley crew of two Gryffindors, a Ravenclaw, and two Hufflepuffs, and they had the look of trouble on them as they swept by him, snickering.
“Do you mind if I come later to check on him?” The words were out of his mouth before he had even registered them, and he flushed, realizing how odd it sounded. Madam Pomfrey let out a disbelieving snort, but ultimately agreed.
Harry burst through the door of the hospital wing. He had gotten increasingly angry as he made his way through the halls of Hogwarts, the place he had always felt safest. For this kind of abuse to be going on, someone had to know. It reminded him of growing up on Privet Drive, the way the neighbors would turn a blind eye to Harry’s obvious malnutrition and the bruises that marked his body. He though that the Wizarding World was different, thought that they would and could correct injustice when they saw it. He was obviously, glaringly wrong, he though at he looked at Malfoy’s unconscious body.
Once outside of the hospital wing, Harry went straight back up to the eighth year common room, seeking out Ron and Hermione. They must have seen the anger in his face, because Ron took a step back as he stepped through the portrait hole and approached them.
“… you doing here? Malfoy, what happened?” Potter’s sickeningly concerned voice made the pounding in Draco’s head even worse. Draco tried to tell him to sod off, but even thinking of speaking hurt. He settled for squeezing his eyes shut and drawing in another gurgling breath, managing to hoist himself into a sitting position. He was already humiliated beyond belief, so he used the last of his strength to plead with Harry Potter. Typical.
“Just making sure, Potter. You two haven’t exactly been friendly in the past.” She was right there, Harry thought. Up until Malfoy had helped them escape the Manor, Harry had downright detested him.
At least he’s not dead, Harry thought, oddly rational in this situation. Habit, he thought absently. He shook Malfoy’s shoulder as gently as he could, wincing as the blonde’s grey eyes rolled into view and registered his presence.
Draco didn’t know how long he was on the floor, but one thing is for certain, he would have rather had literally anyone, including Voldemort himself, shake him awake. But no, he had to swim into consciousness staring at the bright green eyes and utterly ridiculous hair of Harry fucking Potter. Of course.
The constant disgusted stares, the muttering, the curses and hexes and jinxes that followed him down the halls, into classrooms, into his own head were about to drive him absolutely mad.
“So, er, what are you doing this morning?” Harry cringed internally. Can’t a man make amends with his rival without embarrassing himself?
Quickly removing the thought of Draco Malfoy as cute, Harry just smiled back, feeling a rush of satisfaction when color rose on Malfoy’s pale cheeks.
“It’s not my fault I’m rubbish at healing charms! Flitwick set me a foot of parchment on the theory and I haven’t the faintest idea what the fuck I’m doing.” Harry fumed, then flushed. Of course, on the first day they hung out Harry had to reveal his ineptitude, and sure enough, Malfoy arched a regal brow.
“Well then, I’ve got a heap of homework up in the dorms as well, and er, thanks for the help. We should do this again.” Harry was determined to control the heat that threatened to rise in his face. ‘we should do this again’? What was that all about?
“Well, if there’s nothing else, I think I’ll patch him up now if you don’t mind.” Madam Pomfrey herded him towards the door.
“So, basically, you have to really envision what you want the spell to do. It’s not just pointing and thinking of it healed, you have to understand the process of it healing,” Malfoy finished explaining.
“Oh, so that’s why you have to know all the anatomy stuff to be a healer!” Harry was surprised, Malfoy was actually a good teacher.
God, this fucking hurt. The pain radiated from his chest all the way up to his neck, choking him. The fish years were quickly losing interest in Draco’s lack of reaction. He had learned from experience to just stay still.
“Yes, Potter, that why you have to know the ‘anatomy stuff’,” Malfoy smiled, and it took Harry off guard. He was actually quite… cute? When he wasn’t being all pompous.
“I-I just wanted to make sure you’re alright,” Potter said lamely. Draco raised his eyebrows questioningly. “You took a hell of a beating.” Potter tried for a smile, but it came out as more of a grimace.
Draco looked the other boy in the eyes, making sure he wasn’t joking before chuckling a little. Man, his life is strange.
The curtains opened, and Draco was pulled out of his thoughts by Madam Pomfrey handing him yet another elixir. He drank it without question, feeling the calming effects almost immediately. He should really invest in some of these.
Harry had been walking alone, trying to calm himself. Some ignorant third year had, probably on a dare, asked what it had felt like to kill Voldemort, in that hushed, awed tone younger kids took on when they spoke to him or anyone else who fought in the war. His stomach turned as he thought about it, the fascination bordering on hunger in the child’s eye. He had made some lame excuse about forgetting his bag, and ended up here, reminiscing once again about the war and what he could have done differently. He knew that Voldemort had to die, there was no getting around that, but the guilt of taking another person’s life weighed heavy on him still, and to think there were kids wishing that they'd been there to fight? He was ashamed at how angry he got when he heard third years boasting about what they would have done if they were at the battle of Hogwarts. Harry didn't have the heart to tell them they would probably just be another name in the still-growing list of casualties.
His chest still ached, sending out shooting pain whenever he tried to move quickly. His head felt much better though, and he raised a hand to his face to find most of the damage had been taken care of. He always felt at peace in the hospital wing, soothed by the odd but comforting smell of antiseptic and the quiet art of healing. He’d always wanted to be a healer, but of course nobody would trust Lucius Malfoy’s son to do so much as put on a bandage.
“Honestly, Ron, I think we’ve gotten a little too old for that.” She gave Harry a knowing look, which he did not understand in the slightest. “If Harry wants to befriend Malfoy, then its his decision. I, for one, think that this is a big step towards putting the past behind us,” she said with an air of finality, and promptly returned to Fantastic Beasts.
It happened a lot, enough to where Draco though he’d just get used to it eventually. But then again, it’s not really possible to get used to someone beating the absolute fire out of you because you looked at them the wrong way. Another day, another cracked rib, another reminder that no matter how hard he tried, he’d always be tainted by the stupid mark on his arm, tainted by the sins of his parents.
Well, more mad than he already was. It was hard to sleep, he discovered, with the constant screams of innocent muggleborns stuck on replay. Almost every morning, he’d wake up with a cry stuck in his throat, only to realize the waking world wasn’t much better.
“I thought I’d go to the library, I have rather a lot of work this week.” Malfoy said, polite but cold.
“I wanted- well Hermione told me to- anyways, have you spoken about this to McGonagall?” Potter stumbled over his words.
“H-ostpital wing,” He rasped before collapsing forwards onto Harry’s shoulder. A quick glance confirmed he was unconscious, and the sight of blood trickling out of his ear spurred Harry into action.
“You did what?” Ron shouted, causing some first years a few seats down to jump. Harry had just told he and Hermione about his and Malfoy’s conversation in the hospital wing over dinner in the Great Hall.
“I know! I know mate, it just felt like the right thing to do!” Harry exclaimed, frustrated. He really did feel bad for Malfoy, and why was it such a big deal to make amends? Percy had made up with the Weasleys, Pansy Parkinson and Hermione were on speaking/studying together terms, and hadn’t Harry himself vouched for Malfoy in front of the Wizengamot?
Malfoy let out a soft noise, and Harry realized he had a death grip on the other. Harry quickly relaxed his grip, and adjusted Malfoy so that his head was resting on Harry’s shoulder. He knew that there was blood seeping into his robes, but he was beyond caring.
“Yes, well, things happen. Not the first time, probably not the last either.” Draco tried for flippancy, but a wave of irritation washed over him as well. He was tired of all this, just wanted a peaceful year for once in his bloody life.
After making sure they had left for good, Draco tried to sit up, but black spots began to blot out his vision. He rested his face on the cold stone of the dungeon classroom, letting its coolness seep into the hot pain now making a home at the base of his skull. Maybe he’d just die here, it wouldn’t be too hard to just Avada Kedavra himself right here and now. At least this fucking pain would be gone behind the veil…
“Why do you give a rat’s arse, Potter? I thought you’d be ecstatic someone finally got around to putting me in my place.” Draco let the anger seep into his voice, making sure to look Potter dead in the eyes.
“Once again? What do you mean, once again?” Harry nearly shouted at the healer, who just sighed and pointed towards an unoccupied bed.
“I told Madam Pomfrey I’d be back to check on him, see if he’s alright,” Harry told them. Both of their eyebrows raised, almost perfectly in sync. Harry rolled his eyes at them.
“He comes in here, or rather, some unfortunate soul drags him here at least a few times a month.” She paused as Harry gently sat the other boy onto the white sheets, checking his breathing. “This is the worst I’ve seen the poor boy. You didn’t happen to have any part in this?” She narrowed her eyes suspiciously, and Harry felt his cheeks heat.
Of all the people Harry Potter wanted to see today, Draco Malfoy was one that hadn’t even crossed his mind. The blonde hadn’t been causing any trouble since they’d all returned to Hogwarts. In fact, Harry couldn’t remember the last time he’d seen the tall Slytherin outside of the Great Hall. Many of the eighth years stuck together, preferring the company of those who had been at the final battle over younger students who hadn’t experienced the horrors of war firsthand. Harry was content to sit and chat with Neville and Luna, go out to Hogsmeade with Ron and Hermione, and generally tried to get along with everyone else as best he could. Harry was even on good terms with most of the Slytherins, as hard as it was for him to let go of old prejudices.
“Look Harry, I know you’re upset about this but, well, don’t you think he might have… deserved it? After all his family did in the war-“
“Listen, I know he’s a right prick, but nobody deserves to be held accountable for things their family has done. He hasn’t done anything to us this year, hell, I rarely ever see him besides in the Great Hall,” Harry protested. Hermione raised her eyebrows at the mention of Harry looking for Malfoy, but said nothing of it.
He wasn’t a great student, that was Hermione. She still poured all of her energy into schoolwork, determined to live up to her moniker of “the brightest witch of our generation”. Harry knew she’d make a great Minister of Magic, if she ever stooped to governmental work.
Pansy and Goyle were the only ones privy to the Draco behind the cold, aloof mask he put on during the day, the unflappable ex-Death Eater who seemed completely above everyone else, above the mourning and death and regrets of the churning masses.	More than once, Pansy had fetched Draco from the hospital wing with injuries ranging from a Stinging Hex to a Cruciatus Curse. She would walk him down to the dungeons, never commenting on his injuries.
They worked quietly for a time, until Malfoy noticed Harry growing increasingly frustrated at the essay he was writing.
He wasn’t anything like this character people expected him to be, the strong and kind leader. He felt like an imposter in his own skin, and when people asked him how he defeated Voldemort, how he could take abuse from Umbridge without cracking, how he could live on after the horrors of his youth, he usually gave some lame approximation of “I couldn’t have done it on my own”.
He’d never really been comfortable with the reverence, bordering on hero-worship, that he received from the younger students (and even some of the teachers), and after the war it had reached an all time high. He knew it must be grating on Hermione and Ron’s nerves as well, as much as they laughed along with him whenever some unfortunate first-year confronted him and announced that Harry was the greatest wizard in history.
Scooping Malfoy into his arms, careful to avoid touching his chest, he strode out into the hallway. He was beyond anger, he was livid. It must have been those kids, who else could it have been? Who the fuck did those kids think they were, trying to play hero? What had Malfoy done to them?
To be honest, Harry felt like he was barely holding it together. Ron and Hermione were the only people he felt he could trust with this information, after he and Ginny had split over the summer. She deserved someone who could match her relentless, fiery energy, not someone who laid in bed replaying the events of years past, sometimes well into the afternoon.
“You told Granger about this? And the Weasel, too, no doubt. Merlin’s sake, It’ll be all over the school, the Golden Trio saving the Death Eater,” Potter winced at the mention of Death Eaters, but Draco didn’t care. He felt more awful than ever. Now that Potter knew, things were only going to get worse, younger students vying for his attention by targeting Draco. He lay back again, coughing slightly.
“Uh, yeah, I really am rubbish at healing, so if you want to, yeah.” Harry stumbled and Draco nodded at him, launching into a detailed explanation of the spell.
“Vulnera Sanentur? It’s a pretty complex spell.” Draco glossed over the moment easily, and harry was grateful. “I learned it last year, it wasn’t easy.” He rolled up the sleeves of his jumper, and Harry saw his faded Dark Mark, crisscrossed with lines. “I can explain the theory of it, if you’d like,” He offered, and Harry jumped as though he’d seen something he hadn’t supposed to.
“I daresay we should, Potter.” Grey eyes met green, and it felt like Malfoy was X-raying his soul before the blonde picked up his things and began to walk away.
“Oi, Dra-Malfoy!” Harry called, awkwardly half jogging towards the Slytherin. Blimey, he’s tall, Harry thought to himself as he caught up.
“You’re right Harry, but Ron does have a point. He kind of is a living reminder of the war, and some people might not be as forgiving as you,” She pointed out.
“No, shut up and listen to me, both of you.” They sobered up immediately, and Harry relayed the story of finding Malfoy unconscious to them both. By the end of it, Hermione looked almost as angry as Harry, but Ron seemed oddly subdued.
“All right, Harry?” One of the Gryffindors that Harry faintly recognized called out to him as they passed. He raised a hand in greeting, and headed towards the classroom they had vacated. He was young once too, and he wanted to make sure there wasn’t any evidence of their mischief. He chuckled to himself, thinking of the time they had made Polyjuice potion in a bathroom stall, and all the other trouble he and Ron and Hermione had caused, but he stopped short at the sight of the body on the stone floor. It was Draco Malfoy.
“Just making sure he’s good. He took a hell of a beating.” Hermione’s eyes softened, remembering when Harry used to show up at the Burrow at the end of the summer, bruised and malnourished.
“Now listen here, this is a place of healing not cavor- oh.” The anger melted off of her face and became something more resigned. “Mister Malfoy, once again.”
“I want to put the past behind us, Malfoy. We’ve been at each other’s throats for as long as I can remember.” Yeah, that was true enough. But being enemies with Potter was a constant in Draco’s universe, like the sun rising in the east. It was strange, but he felt a bit of comfort in it, a testament to how miserable his life was at present. Potter seemed to take Draco’s silence as a cue to continue.
“I had to, Dra-Malfoy,” Potter caught himself. “I didn’t know what else to do! Anyways, are you going to talk to McGonagall?” Draco narrowed his eyes, trying to see what Potter was playing at.
Poor Malfoy, I believe his pride is hurt more than anything. Drop a comment and a kudos, and let me know what ya'll want to see!
He wasn’t witty and quick, not like Ron. The redhead could easily gloss over an awkward pause following the mention of one of their dead classmates or friends, and he could beat anyone in a game of Wizard’s chess, even Hermione.
"Going to take us there today or what?" Potter's voice brought Draco out of his stupor. Draco felt his cheeks warm, there was a weird feeling in his chest. Potter's stupid aftershave scent was tickling his nostrils. Draco swallowed hard and exhaled softly, trying to block everything out and picture his destination.
There was a place he really liked to go to. A restaurant just past St. Mungo’s where they served all kinds of food; Italian, Chinese, Indian.
So here's Chapter 3. Constructive criticism is always welcome. Your kudos and comments mean a lot and keep me going!
Harry walked soundlessly beside Smith, hiding from view of House 248. Harry cast the Deprehendatur Spell at the house but there was no trace of magic apart from the Dark wards that surrounded it.
"Don't go near it, you understand?" Potter hisses at Draco and it sounds so much like the hisses of the evil wizard that Draco can't help but release the whimper building in his mouth or the tears gathering in his eyes. He has no idea what he shouldn't go near but he wasn't going to ask, nor was he in any condition to.
Draco carefully removed the cork from the vial and emptied the whole bottle into a little dish. The potion glistened under the light, looking like the most mesmerizing thing one would ever see.
Harry got up to leave as Ron muttered, "We aren't finished. Take care of yourself, Harry. Take this." Ron pushed a tiny vial of bright orange liquid in his hand. Harry immediately recognized it as an energizing potion and grinned at Ron.
"Let's just stop. Clearly I can't do this." Draco exclaims in frustration after his 12th try and sits down on the sofa, cradling his head in his hands.
Harry looked at all the other names on the list and went through their accomplishments and expertise. In the end, he had chosen three names; Stacey Smith, Ezekiel Jones and Draco Malfoy, two of them had to go. Harry rubbed his temples as he thought about who to choose.
"Have you made much progress?" She asked, trying to hide her smile. She wanted her son to be happy, he did deserve it after all.
"Don't flatter yourself, Potter. I don't care about your ugly face." Draco had exclaimed and busied his hands with the potion he was supposed to be investigating.
A ringing was in Harry's ears now, he desperately tried to block it as his hands shook with weakness and dropped way from his mouth. He was gasping now, trying to get oxygen into his lungs which seemed impossible as of now. Harry felt tears stinging his eyes. He couldn't see, couldn't hear, couldn't fucking
Kreacher beams and disapparates. Harry turns to Draco and his Mother, "Uh-sorry about that.. Kreacher has umm... a tendency to say.. umm.. a little too much."
Draco sighed, he knew she wouldn't like this so he cryptically said with a wave of his hand, "Nothing to worry about, Mother. The Aurors wanted my help with a case which involves potions. You know how skilled I am in this field so they asked if I'd be willing to aid them and I agreed." He didn't mention the fact that Harry Potter was supposed to be his partner, no need to worry Mother even more.
"You look amazing. Dray'll probably faint seeing you. Or he might kiss you. Depends on how bold he's feeling" Pansy smirks and turns around, entering the living room.
"Y-yes. I did. I was able to levitate a leaf higher than that-that day and after much practice, I could even lift a cauldron!" Draco exclaims, excited about the progress he was making in so  little time. He had pushed himself to the limit and had fainted actually. His mother had found him on the floor, wand in hand and had scolded him for over-exerting himself but she was proud with Draco's progress nonetheless. Potter, however, didn't need to know that.
Thankyou for you comments and kudos! It was the highlight of my day. I am glad you like this story. Please share your thoughts on the new chapter. I will try to post as soon as I can.
He held up a hand and his Mother stopped talking. "What's done is done, Mother. I will not take back my decision." He said firmly and his Mother nodded with a sigh. "But this wasn't the only thing I wanted to talk about." He continued.
At night though, when Harry was back home, he had thought about all those events; the pain, the hissing and the violent words. Harry had downed a whole bottle of Firewhiskey and swallowed a vial of dreamless sleep potion. He had a tendency to get nightmares after particularly traumatizing events. He had given it a thought, and concluded that those words and that voice were mere fragments of his imagination. Yet, deep in his heart he couldn’t believe that.
"Aww, bummer. I wanted to see the Head Auror in action." Draco said sarcastically. He wanted to make that smile atleast falter a little.
"Nothing's wrong, Malfoy. Look here's the bill." Draco frowned but didn't push it. If Potter didn't want to tell him then he won't act desperate.
"I have to go to work. I'll see you around." Harry got up. It was too early to go to work yet, Ron wasn't even up but Ginny didn't say anything, just nodded with sympathetic eyes.
Now Draco couldn't argue with that and saying that Harry wouldn't have thought of it when seeing someone in such a condition would probably be too lame. He decided not to reply to Blaise at all. And so Draco just looked away, ignoring his friends' triumphant stares and took a sip of the tea Pansy's house elf just served.
I close my eyes dutifully and wait for Merlin knows what Pansy's about to do to me. I flinch as something suddenly touches my eyelid.
Thank you to everyone who left kudos! Here's chapter 4 for y'all.. Do tell me what you think. ~Goldhearts♡♡
"I wish to talk to you about a certain book I borrowed." Draco spoke respectfully, just as his mother had taught her.
Draco conjured a small glass vial with his wand and filled it with a generous amount of the green paste.
After Fred's death, it was very hard on the Weasleys. Molly wouldn't stop crying, Ron was quiet, Ginny wasn't lively as before but most of all George acted like he had lost a part of himself. He was just a shell of who he once used to be. It was very hard for Harry to stay around the Weasleys when they so clearly were mourning Fred. He felt like an intruder and didn't want to spend much time with the family. He knew it was wrong, he should've supported them, helped them but at the time, he was so tired of his own nightmares and everything else going on in his life. It was Hermione who had finally talked some sense into him and told him how the Weasleys accepted him as family. That he wasn't intruding on anything. So he started to grow close to the Weasleys, closer than before.
Harry nodded in reply and Accioed a file with "CONFIDENTIAL" written on it with block letters. He opened the page with the case description and was about to tell Malfoy about it but he was rudely interrupted.
"You tell me to be careful, Farley tells me to be careful, all of that bastard's lackeys tell me to be careful. And yet I do what I wish." Harry said.
Instead he looked around the room he was sitting in. The girl was sitting behind a black wooden desk, her mouth still moving continuously. Draco gave her a disgusted look which she didn't even notice, and looked around. There were a few plants around the room. All for decoration and not one of them useful. Draco shook his head in disappointment. On the far wall, opposite to where he was sitting, were a bunch of framed articles. Draco peered closely but then moved forward to read whatever was written there.
He hesitantly put his other hand on Malfoy's waist, feeling the slender curve of it, and when instead of pulling away Malfoy just blushed harder, Harry grinned and grew more confident.
"Mum? Dad?" He asked, staring at a carbon-copy of his own face and another beautiful one of a woman with red hair. They didn't seem to hear him though.
. But then again, you were always a little child. Following other's orders like the good boy you are." A deep, cold voice spoke from nowhere.
Harry smirked back, "I'm pretty sure that you have agreed to work with the Aurors, that is, me?" He asked.
During Auror training Harry had learnt many spells that could be used to detect if a person was lying but at the moment, he didn't need one to confirm that this man was.
Draco's day had been going perfectly fine until a particularly natty barn owl tapped on his office window. With a frown he let it in and untied the letter from it's leg.
Kingsley nodded once and Harry knew he was being dismissed. He grabbed the file and got up, "Thank you, Kingsley. I won’t disappoint you."
"I thought you were supposed to be a brave Gryffindor, yet you needed her help to make a move?" I said cleverly.
? It didn't sit well with Draco, it looked like a trap but why in Salazar's name would they want to trap him at all? He hadn't done anything wrong.
"Thank you, Harry." She says and her voice carries so much gratitude, so much emotion, Harry can't help but mean it when he says, "It's a pleasure."
The feather is floating only 2 inches above the ground but it is floating nonetheless. Draco laughs happily and looks up at Potter, expecting to see a similar expression of mingled pride and happiness as before but all he sees is disbelief and is- is that disgust?. Draco's smile vanishes as he sees Potter's expression. Without looking at Draco, Potter turns around and rushes out of the room with no words other than,"Come at the same time next Saturday."
Harry knew Malfoy was having a panic attack. He had experienced many of those to recognize one. Malfoy's breathing was ragged, his body trembling with tears leaking from his eyes over his overly pale cheeks. He was whispering nonsense but Harry could make out a few words such as "sorry" and "please". Harry now felt very very guilty. First he had lashed out on Malfoy due to his own feelings, then he hadn't paid much attention to teaching him and now Harry had made him have a bloody panic attack. Harry desperately attempted to comfort Malfoy. Seeing Malfoy like this and knowing he was the cause of it made Harry's heart clench and his stomach sink.
Harry sat up slowly, his throat dry. "Everything wasn't alright. The man was there. He had apparated. I'm pretty sure he was the wizard but before I could catch him, he disapparated. I don't know why I passed out. Probably just tiredness. I haven't slept since last night."
Even though Draco wouldn't admit it, he had developed a strange liking towards Potter. Noticing things like how rich Potter's laugh was when he was surprised or found something too funny, how sexy his crooked smile was, how lusciously soft his black curls were.
Then as though a cord snapping, Potter's expression becomes less angry and he backs away from Draco.
So that was Chapter 5..I do hope you liked it..Once again constructive criticism and suggestions are welcome. I'll try to post the new Chapter as soon as I can..♡♡
"Apply this on your arm. If the pain or itch increases, go to St. Mungos immediately." He says and hands me the bottle, considering Draco still hasn't looked up from staring at his now markless skin. I nod to Potter in thanks and he nods back, to both me and Blaise.
Draco knew he shouldn't, knew it wouldn't do him any good but he couldn't help glancing at the picture of the murder scene again. It was the same, as gruesome as it had been before. Draco's hand shot out as he picked up the photograph with a shaking, pale hand. He brought it close to his face and inspected the bodies. Cuts lined the torso of the two males. Little but deep ones, stark red against the pale skin. The wounds looked as if they were made by a knife. Draco's gaze moved to the wounds on the neck. They were circular, ringed with dry blood. In the middle was something greenish, like rotten flesh. Similar wounds in varying sizes were present on the wrist of the bodies. Draco gagged at the picture but didn't put it down. He had seen many injuries during his job as a healer but this was something else entirely.
Harry's blood ran cold at the words. His hands dropped from his throat to clutch his head that was throbbing painfully. It felt like someone was choking him, hissing threats in his ears and hammering his head all at once.
"C-can you cast the calming charm again?" Draco asks, mortified at having not been able to feel his magic once he had done it before.
What the hell was happening? Harry couldn't relate the words together no matter how hard he tried, and it was getting harder to focus as a dull pain started to spread from his legs to his torso.
The morgue smelled of rotting flesh and Draco had to cover his head with a Bubble-head charm as Kingsley had done to avoid passing out from the smell.
"You just passed out. I didn't have enough time to call for help so I apparated you here, at my place. What happened, Harry? Why did you send the signal if everything was alright?" Smith spoke again.
"Hello! You must be Mr. Malfoy." She smiled brightly at him which made Draco's scowl harden even more but it didn't seem to affect the girl at all. Draco gave her a bare shake of the head in the affirmative.
"As you've seen, Mr. Malfoy, two more dead bodies have been found in the same house as before." Kingsley spoke, drawing Draco's attention away from the unsettling image.
"I love you so much, Dray. Seeing you cry, it breaks my heart. I'm so so sorry." Harry kisses Draco's forehead and lays down beside him. Hoping to make it up to Draco in the morning.
As soon as I realized what I had done, I pulled back immediately but before I could go far away Potter's hands tightened on my waist, pulling me back. I stared at his eyes as they looked back in mine, then he lifted his hand from my waist and cupped my face.
I am so sorry for going MIA. I was actually reallyyy busy but here's chapter 5. Do tell me what you think! Thank you for leaving kudos and for your comments. This chapter had alot of POV change so I mentioned whose POV it was. I will try to post again as soon as I can! ~Goldhearts♡♡
We argue back and forth until my glasses slip off from my nose. I can only blink as Pansy catches them in her outstretched hands.
And now he had to write a report about how he had found Mr. Gavyss's cat which was reported lost, in the attic of the man's own house. Mr. Gavyss was probably the most jolly grandpa Harry had ever met but he couldn't remember anything for the life of him. This time he had lost his cat and of course Robards had to assign this case to Harry. Shab was having a "leg injury" after their latest mission. Harry called bullshit. He had fallen down from the tree and had gotten nothing more than what an Episkey couldn't fix.
A roar of frustration echoed in the dark night; a bone-chilling and inhuman sound. The people of Purely cowered in their houses. They missed the time when their town was a peaceful place but that had changed now. Now it was haunted by something dark, or rather
"Not your business." Draco had muttered and busied himself with casting detective charms over the paste to determine the ingredients. So far that hadn't worked.
Draco walked to where he was standing. "Here is the potion we recovered from the house in Purely." Kingsley was holding a tiny vial in his hand, about the size of Draco's ring finger. Inside was a deep red liquid, Draco would've assumed it was blood had it not been for the glittery bubbles inside it.
"You did it." Potter is smiling softly at him and there is so much pride and admiration in his eyes that they are shining and Draco feels his heart flutter as it normally does around Potter but he cherishes the feeling and it makes his heart clench thinking how he was the one who put the expression on Potter's face and- with a deep breath Draco cuts off the thoughts of his stupid lovesick side.
Days passed and Draco continued his lessons with Potter- no Harry. After the night of Draco's panic attack, Potter kept calling him Draco so in return Draco called him Harry. However, none of them mentioned that night again anymore. Harry had woken Draco up and in a perfect gentlemanly manner, without mocking Draco at all, he had apparated Draco and himself to Malfoy Manor. Mother had freaked out, of course, adding to Draco's embarrassment but Harry was fine about it. He had replied politely to Mother and Draco's thanks then disapparated.
"Don't grin so wide Potter, you'll split your face in half." Draco had smirked but he had forgotten who he was talking to. Of course Harry freaking Potter had a better reply.
Harry blew an annoyed breath through puffed cheeks and muttered, "It was a few months back. I was on a case. Me and my team were following a murderer. I had almost caught him, in a dark alley but before I could do anything, my vision blurred. It was the worst that time, the most agonizing."
At first, there were a few disappearances. And after that, a few deaths were reported. When the Aurors were sent to investigate, they discovered an abandoned house, with wards around it – And it reeked of dark magic.
Mother nodded, "I have already ordered Pippy to set up the table." She stood up and followed Draco to the dining room.
Currently Draco was sitting in Potter's office, seated in front of the Golden Boy. Draco looked at him as the guy chewed the end of his quill and wrote something on his parchment. His head was bent and his eyes were far away. Draco knew he was thinking about the case.
"Ron you're not helping!" Hermione exclaimed, though she looked like she was suppressing a laugh herself.
As he neared the place, Harry saw what he had been looking for. It was a small dagger, it's hilt was gold with a sparkling, emerald green stone set in the middle. Around the huge stone, there were small empty spaces, as if some of the jewels that had sat there had been removed. The blade wasn't covered in blood as Harry had expected but it was sharp as though someone had just whetted it.
Soon he went up to his own room too but he didn't sleep, for fear of the dreams that he would see. Fear of hearing his Father's disappointed and hateful voice again.
The words lit up a new kind of hope in Harry. He smiled and nodded, hoping his saviour status can help him get a guy.
Blaise rolls his eyes at that and Pansy snorts.  "Like that'd stop you." Draco glares at them and they finally shut up.
He looked up and chuckled at Malfoy's stunned expression. "What? You thought that man really had something in him to become Minister?" Harry asked.
"Was it 1000 galleons?" Draco asked as they exited the restaurant. The sun was shining brightly; it was almost noon.
"I heard words then. I couldn't see anything but I could hear hissing. I soon realized that it was Parseltongue. The words didn't make any sense at first. Mud. Green. Something like that." Harry shrugged, saw Malfoy's eyes fill with confusion but the calming reassurance was still there.
A loud knock echoed in Harry's office. "Come in." He shouted, it was probably his secretary, Amanda, with his morning coffee.
with Malfoy but Harry shut that part up for good. It was only for a little fun, of course, nothing more.
Ron approaced him slowly, as one approaches a wild animal. Harry eyed him warily. "You've...made a truce...with Draco fucking
, wasn't it, when instead of investigating the brutal death of a little girl, we went to a ceremony?" Potter spit every word with so much venom Draco was taken aback. His surprise even more was evident on his face when he saw Kingsley flinch.
As soon as he grabbed his wand, he heard Potter gasp. Draco looked up at the Auror who was clutching his head in his hands.
Farley was writhing in pain beneath him, screaming for help. His hands were clutching his head. The cane he used for support clattered to the ground, his only stable leg was unable to hold his weight for long, resulting in him falling loudly to the dusty floor.
"With all due respect, Auror Potter, I think your gut feeling is probably wrong." Farley's fingers tightened on his cane; a gesture not gone unnoticed by the Senior Auror.
"Don't lie to me, Potter. I can spot lies from a mile away. Besides, I saw you in the living room." I say, making my voice as intimidating as I can.
"Harry.. I-I...wh-what are you doing?" Draco whispered, ignoring Harry's compliments because his mind had stopped working and his heart was racing, his breath was coming in short bursts and his hands on Harry's chest were clammy with sweat.
"This is Senior Auror Potter. He recently went on a case and captured a very dangerous criminal all alone and then..." The girl started to babble again in a way that clearly told how much she admired (and probably
Harry's eyes traced the movement of a short, stout man as he walked through the streets, his head looking in every direction for any kind of threat. He was sure the man couldn't detect him, Harry had years of auror training, he was every bit stealthy and strong as they come.
"You do have magic but it is very less. You will need to be patient if you want to get your magic back." Harry finally replies.
Draco entered the quiet library, the smell of parchment and dust hitting his nostrils. He walked towards the old aged librarian hunched over a table, his wand twirling as books sorted themselves into neat piles in front of him.
He had investigated the potion evacuated by the Ministry but it was in such a small amount that he had made hardly any progress. So he decided to solve the mystery of the green paste first instead but he wasn't getting anywhere with it either.
. His senses were so full of Potter; Potter's masculine scent of sandalwood, sweat and something that was uniquely him, Potter's green eyes with specks of freaking gold in them, and Potter's soft hair.
Draco sat in the cushioned, white armchair and slid the piece of parchment towards his boss. "I want a vacation." He said.
"I don't care about others. My friends will support me no matter what. So, will you be with me Draco? Will you be mine?" Harry asked again.
Ron's eyes widened, his mouth dropping open as he stood up so quickly that the chair he had been sitting on clattered loudly to the floor. "Tell me you're lying, Harry. Tell me it's just a joke." He said dramatically.
Unfortunately, his focus was disturbed by an inhumane rumbling sound. Draco jerked in surprise, looking around for the possible cause of it. Had the Dark wizard somehow entered the Ministry?
Blaise sighs. "You and your gut feelings." He rolls his eyes but moves towards the kitchen nonetheless.
"No I cannot. Be ready by 11:30, we have to reach there by 12." Narcissa orders in her "I won't take anymore shit from you" voice and leaves the room.
"So I have heard that the famous Harry Potter, Saviour of the Wizarding World, The Chosen One, The Boy Who Lived has taken it upon himself to teach magic to none other than Draco Malfoy, his arch nemesis. What compelled you to make this choice Mr. Potter?" George says, holding his fist infront of Harry as a mic.
Draco's blush deepened and he only swatted at Harry's chest when he laughed at Draco's flaming face.
Harry's little speech made Draco realize that what he was looking for wasn't something he had already experienced at all, it was something he had always desired.
"Oh! I am so sorry Mrs. Malfoy. Do come in and it isn't Mr. Potter, just call me Harry" Harry steps aside to let her in.
"Sources even powerful than the saviour?" Malfoy raised an eyebrow. Harry's mouth quirked at the end involuntarily; he nodded his head in affirmation.
Draco stared in surprise at Potter's outburst. His eyes were blazing with rebellion, disgust and anger as he shouted explicitly at his boss, Draco would surely be fired if he did that. But he did agree with Potter. This ceremony was a waste of time when they'd rather be investigating the murder of innocent people.
"I wish to ask a few questions that I hope you'll answer truthfully." Harry smiled lightly at Dolohov and sat down in a chair facing the sweeper.
They all knew that it was Draco's last lesson tomorrow because he had learnt every bit of magic he knew before. Harry knew tomorrow's lesson wasn't necessary but he wanted to elongate the time he spent with Draco a little more. Who knows if Draco would want to see Harry's face again after they were done with lessons and Draco had his magic back.
"Harry, I'll just say it. Either you ask him out today, or tell him that you would like to keep hanging out with him." Hermione finally suggests.
Draco let out a breath and stood up. He had been sitting with Potter in suffocating silence. Not that Potter seemed to mind. He paid Draco no heed, as they usually did when working together, but it unnerved Draco today. Perhaps because of the earlier encounter with Potter's fellow auror,
"What is this place?" Harry turned to look at Malfoy who was striding beside him. His hair looked almost gold in the sunlight. And how the hell was it so straight? Harry was sure no one had that straight hair naturally.
Turning over another page, Harry looked at the list of the candidates eligible for the case. There were many names of people along with little descriptions about the abilities of the wizards and witches. Most of them were incredible potioneers, Harry even recognized some of them from his Ministry meetings or newspapers.
"You fainted while Potter was removing your Mark." I reply and move to sit beside him, offer him reassurance.
I recognized soon enough what it was...a spell to transform a book into one you wished. It was complicated, requires a strong magical core. I couldn't believe that he...he was powerful enough to perform it. And then he just...left."
"Hmmm.. Do you want me to be your first kiss, Draco? Would you like that?" Harry asked but Draco didn't know how to respond. Even if he did, Draco wasn't sure he could speak.
"It...it was before you came that day but...he was here again. I tried to stop him, thinking he was mad but...he...I don't know what he did but I didn't call the healers or aurors. Even when my heart was shouting at me to. He grabbed a book...I..I tried to see which and it was an ordinary one. He then started to say something, a spell of some sort.
With a deep breath Draco signed the parchment with a quill Kingsley provided. As soon as he completed writing his name, a pulse of magic went through his arm and wrapped around his heart like a warm cocoon encasing an insect.
Harry knew he could capture the man but it wasn't only about the wizard. It was about what he was planning too. The potions they had discovered were hard to understand and Harry knew Malfoy was doing his best. He had observed the Healer when they were together, observed the way his hands worked in symphony as he inspected the green emerald paste.
"What do you mean you didn't had a choice?" Ron asks. Harry sighs. He misses Hermione's sensible remarks whenever he is alone with Ron. He should probably have told them both together at their home and not only to Ron at The Three Broomsticks.
"Here, Potter. You can try it." Draco pushed the platter towards Potter who looked up at him in surprise.
Harry whipped his wand out, ignoring the nervous gasp Farley gave. He didn't point it at the shopkeeper though. All he did was twirl it lightly in his fingers.
With a huge sigh Draco apparated back to the Manor, the weight of everything that had taken place at the Ministry falling heavily on his shoulders all at once.
I go in my room and stare at my reflection. I look like myself but...there's something different about me. My eyes seem more bright, probably because of whatever Pansy applied but I look good. I
I grabbed it with a shaky hand and read it. All it said was that this removal was Ministry approved and any problems will be completely the Ministry's responsibility. I got worried at the word "problems".  What was Potter about to do to me?
"Dray, I'm so-" But before Harry could finish apologising, Draco threw his cup of tea on the floor and marched out of the room.
Draco entered the white room, it's sharp smell of antiseptic hitting his nostrils. The Head Healer, Healer Brandon as everyone called him, was a 70-year old man with a wrinkled but kind face, soft hazel eyes and greying hair who was, at the moment, giving him one of the softest smile Draco had ever witnessed. "Ah, Healer Malfoy! Do take a seat. What brings you here?"
"Oh? Since when do you care about my face, Malfoy?" Potter had raised an eyebrow and smirked. That smirk alone was Draco's undoing; He turned red and averted his eyes.
Malfoy edged closer slowly, as if approaching a wild animal who might attack any moment. Usually, if Ron or Hermione did that, Harry would've lashed out but at the moment he didn't have the energy to.
He grew specially close to Charlie. Charlie had come back from Romania, wanting to live with his family from now on. He soon came out to his family, told them how he liked boys and the Weasleys happily accepted him. At first Harry was surprised to know that two boys could be together but soon he learnt it wasn't anything different. He realized how he loved being with boys as well as girls and then, with a little help from Charlie, he embraced his bisexuality and came out to his family, friends and the whole wizarding world.
He whispered in a cold and dangerous voice, "We are Aurors, Malfoy, we are soldiers, not sheep." All thoughts of remaining professional left his mind as he stared with blazing eyes at Malfoy. If Kingsley wanted Harry to respect Malfoy, he wouldn't be obeying until Malfoy actually earned that respect.
"Hey, it's okay. I know many skilled wizards who can't produce one. It's nothing to be ashamed of. I'll teach you."
"I don't own this book. I didn't bring it here. I remember every piece of parchment in this library but this book...this isn't...it's so dangerous. I can't believe it was
Probably seeing Harry's anxiousness on his face Kingsley gave him a reassuring smile, "I wasn't finished as of yet, actually. As I said you will be the only
"Even if he did, he won't call us in his office for it. It must be something important." A sense of dread filled Harry as his smile vanished. Had there been another murder? Apparently, Malfoy was thinking along similar lines if his paler face and wide eyes were any indication.
He saw Draco stop and close his mouth, his cheeks colouring. "Sorry." He whispered sheepishly. Harry took a deep breath to calm his anger.
"That was Smith." Kingsley said, he was frowning at the place where the silver leopard had vanished. "It isn't like Harry to go back home without reporting to me, specially with a case this significant."
"Stand infront of me." Potter commands. Draco doesn't like being ordered around but he knows he can decline anytime he likes, and he doesn't want to give up on a chance to get his magic back.
"This is Sir Robards, the Junior Head Auror" She continued pointing to the picture of a man with a stern face and grey hair.
"Master Potter! Kreacher is very sorry for being late but he made Master's favourite hot chocolate that Master wants when he spends the night with-" Potter cuts Kreacher off with a blush coloring his cheeks.
Harry frowned at that, not knowing what exactly Kingsley meant but nodded nonetheless and disappirated to his office.
Malfoy chuckled lowly, "I don't blame you; I was surprised too at the fact that I admitted that to you, of all people."
Potter shrugged in reply, "Any particular suggestion?" He raised an eyebrow at Draco who thought for a while.
"Ancient things are always the most informative." Draco spoke in a low voice, hoping to cast some influence over Potter too.
Draco had been very tired the night he had learnt that quality of Potter's. They were both in the hidden room where the potion and paste were kept, Draco investigating the green paste and Potter thinking about the possible suspects for the creator of the potion Draco was examining.
Narcissa and Draco had sent him thank you letters and apologized for their wrongdoings too. Harry had forgiven them and then had hardly thought about either of them. Mainly because he was very busy in the trials and then his job as a DADA proffesor at Hogwarts.
He grinned brightly and disappirated directly to Potter's office, the book still clutched in his hands, his face beaming with childish excitement.
"Here's your food, gentlemen." The waiter placed their food on the table and stepped back. "Anything else you'd like?" He asked.
Thank you for your support! I made this story 6 chapters long and this is the last chapter. I apologise for taking so long to post but I was a little busy. Tell me what you want me to write next. Constructive criticism is welcome.
Draco's mouth went dry at the thought of examining those bodies but he took a deep breath and got up.
He crouched low just behind a wall nearby, like a predator waiting to attack its prey at the right time, watching the criminal as he searched for something in his coat. Harry waited, adrenaline rushing in his veins like blood, he waited for the man to reveal the precious heirloom he had stolen after murdering a Ministry official. Harry was ready to spring up on the man the minute he took out the evidence of his guilt but just as the man did that, Harry's vision blurred.
Harry was taken aback when Farley gave a humourless laugh. "You are better off protecting yourselves first. He is dangerous, he can defeat your army with a flick of his wand."
"Of course. Enjoy your vacation, Mr. Malfoy." Healer Brandon smiled kindly at him, his eyes and mouth wrinkling at the corners.
"Fine, only because you're insisting so much." Malfoy sighed but it didn't bother Harry because it was the fakest sigh he had ever heard.
"I have made my choice; Draco and he has made his." Mother's tone was clipped and icy, Draco resisted the urge to flinch at it. She always used that voice when he was misbehaving or did something disappointing when he was a child but Draco wasn't a child anymore. He was a man, a man with a free will and complete independence over his life.
"Look mate, we all know you are too good for this world but sometimes we got to follow orders." Ron said.
I tried to tame my hair but it won't cooperate. It had been growing out and I was thinking to cut it but right now I didn't have enough time so I tried to tie it in a bun, like I had seen some guys do in the Quiditch magazine. It worked and I looked better, sexier. I thought about shaving but my stubble wasn't that grown out, it was okay, so I left it that way.
Just as he was about to cross out Malfoy's name, Kingsley's words came rushing back to him. "Choose the wizard who is most suited for the case and not your company."
"Use some sense, Potter. Order something less expensive and you'll have to pay less." Harry rolled his eyes at Malfoy's remark. He knew that much.
Harry opened his eyes slowly and was instantly blinded with a bright light. "Harry! Are you alright?" Smith's concerned voice reached Harry's ears and he sighed slowly.
A sudden thought occurred to Draco, why was such a dangerous book kept freely in a public library? He'd have to talk to the librarian there about this matter but at the moment he needed to solve this case.
He couldn't take it anymore. Couldn't bare the way Potter was ignoring him. He shot up from his seat causing Potter's focus to drift away from his precious reports.
"How mislead you are, Potter. Tell me who was it that called you attractive again? Weasley?" Draco drawled, getting a little bit if his dignified self back.
Potter picked up the picture of the murder scene and examined it with a crease between his brows. Draco stared at him, though he didn't know why. Perhaps because he had never seen Potter look so tired and weary.
Draco's mouth seemed to move at it's own accord, "You look like shit, Potter." His eyes widened in realization at what he had just said and he scrambled to take it back somehow. "I-I meant that..you d-don't look well, Auror Potter."
"Pansy!" With a blush Draco cuts her off. "I understand that I was... ummm... a little obsessed-" "A little!?" "-fine very obsessed with Potter but I can't act on my feelings. He is my teacher, for Merlin's sake!"
He looked at his menu; Ricotta steak, Meat casserole, coq au vin, lamb chops, risotto, sushi, all kinds of food were available.
"Mr. Malfoy. You have now made the deal and cannot back out, I am pretty sure you knew that already." Kingsley asked. Draco nodded in reply as Kingsley slid his hand in front of him. Draco shook it, feeling the hard and callous skin underneath, the hands of an auror.
Harry slowly turned around to see a dark, cloaked figure, nothing like Smith, entering the room he was in.
They were large, one at the pulse point of the neck and both wrists. The circular gashes were so deep Draco could see the damaged veins lining the skin. Dried blood ringed the circumference of the wound. Around it was the greenish tinge Draco had seen in the picture. He had assumed it was rotten flesh but now that he looked closely, he realized it was something else entirely.
"He saw a person having a panic attack, Blaise. Which was caused by him not to mention. Of course he would try to comfort the person to satisfy his guilt."
With a sigh he told Malfoy everything; the visit to Mr. Farley, his words and everything that had happened to him. Harry watched as Malfoy's eyes widened comically with every word he spoke and he thought about entirely omitting the connection he'd made from the discussion they were currently having. But he decided against it; Malfoy was a responsible man, not a child who'd be terrified of a threat that wasn't even directed at him in the first place.
"I didn't to be honest. Funny how Potter was muggle raised but still knows more than us." Pansy says. Blaise and Draco nod in agreement. They talk about Pansy's latest relationship with Loony Lovegood("Don't call her that!" From a very red Pansy), the latest quiditch scores, and a little more teasing on Draco's crush on his teacher. At moment like these Draco is glad for his friends.
"Potter? What's wrong?" Draco absolutely did not like the expression on Potter's face at the moment. He looked vulnerable, sad, like a child. Draco had never witnessed Potter look anything besides confident or sure of himself but at the moment, he looked the complete opposite. Back in the days, Draco would've made fun of Potter for behaving like a little kid but now all it did was unnerve him.
Draco had never really noticed before but Potter's atrocious hair was actually made of black curls that looked unbelievably soft. They reminded Draco of his favourite peacock quill. He always loved to write with it because of the soft feathers it had. Draco's gaze dropped to Potter's forehead where a single curl lay innocently. It was so long that it tickled till his eyes. Potter's unbelievably long eyelashes blinked rapidly, trying to keep away the single lock of hair. Draco's fingers itched to push the curl away.
"What? But you said it was very important. Robards would never give you a case to solve all alone. No one has ever solved a case alone." Ron exclaimed, still a little shocked.
Harry was halfway through the door when Kingsley spoke again, "I know you won’t. And do remember my advice. Choose the wizard who is most suited for the
A loud crack interrupted his musings. "Master Malfoy! Mippey is here to take your cloak!" His house-elf exclaimed. Draco nodded and handed his cloak to her, waiting for her to disapparate like she usually did but she only stared at him with huge eyes.
The monster was more human than one would think but only physically. His rage had driven him to the apex of insanity and had made him inhumane. Nothing or no one could help him, not that he would let himself be helped.
Harry gasped and his body continued to tremble in pain, he could feel his conciousness slipping slowly away but the hissed words were crystal clear in his head once again:
The receptionist nodded and opened a battered-looking register. "He's on his break at the moment. You may find him in the room that is just on the right, the basement."
When he opened them again, he wasn't alone in the desert. Ron, Hermione, all the Weasleys, his parents, Sirius, Remus, all of his friends and even Dumbledore were surrounding him in a huge circle.
"He won't, the Aurors will protect you." Harry spoke calmly. He wasn't touching the man or pointing his wand at him but with the way the shopkeeper was trembling, he might as well be.
A man limped from behind a wall, he was short and slim, hardly any muscle, only bones. His face was gaunt, an unattractive stubble on his cheeks and chin. He might've been intimidating to others with his walking stick and the annoyed aura surrounding him but not to Harry Potter, Saviour of the Wizarding World.
There was one more question I wanted to ask. Perhaps Potter saw it in my eyes, or he saw the trembling of my arm as I held it infront of him, but he said gently, "Anymore questions?"
It was true, when, during the trial Lucius was given a choice to either live in house arrest with his family or spend ten years in Azkaban, his choice had surprised everyone in the room. Draco still remembers his exact words; still remembers how they had sliced his vulnerable heart into two.
However, after Harry had discovered the wards around the place, he had realized that the latter was true. The wizard
"You still think I can do this?" Draco asks but he stands up anyway. Add Harry to the list of things Draco can never say no to as well.
"Mistake, really? Oh don't deny it, Malfoy. This isn't the first time I've been called attractive." Oh great. Add 'arrogant' to the list of 'Qualities of Potter Draco has noticed.'
of all people? He knew very well that I had a thing for Potter. I believe I was very... expressive.. about it, back in school. Before I could confront Blaise, Pansy grabbed my arm.
An involuntarily smile curled on Draco's lips. He had enjoyed the time spent with Potter; the only people of his age he hung out with were Pansy and Blaise but even that had been a long time ago. They both were busy with their own lives and Draco with his.
"Can't you do anything? Everyone listens to you." Harry stared at Malfoy to see if the git was joking but if his serious and sincere expression was any indication, he wasn't.
Harry stood up too, eager for a distraction, "Yeah well, no one forced you to accept this offer, Malfoy. No one asked you to quit your job. They were your choices and it comes as no surprise to me that you regret them. After all, none of your decisions have ever been noble."
, Kingsley, and you want me to go to a fucking reception? We have hardly any lead in this case and-"
Draco wasn't angry. He was upset, very very upset. Harry felt his heart break at Draco's cries. He ran as fast as he could into their room and engulfed Draco in his arms.
"Goddamit!" Harry's shout cuts Draco off. Ink was now covering the whole parchment Harry's report was written on.
This fuelled his anger even more. He picked up the bronze object and wrapped his fingers around it tightly. Red sparks danced around his palm, wrapping around the goblet like a snake wraps around its prey.
"Oh Draco! I'm so sorry, sweety. You know how hard it is to convince Blaise." Pansy says, finally noticimg Draco. Blaise rolls his eyes but he doesn't look offended.
Do tell me your thoughts and feel free to give any suggestions you like. Also if there is anything you want me to include in the story, feel free to mention it. The next Chapter will be up next week!♡♡
Almost half an hour later, Harry walked up the stairs, deciding it was enough time for Draco to take out his anger on the walls of their room. But as Harry neared their bedroom and the broken sobs that were undoubtedly made by Draco, reached his ears, Harry realized how wrong he was.
We all wait for the official to come in and when he does, our mouths hang open. The unruly mop of black hair, the emerald green eyes and the infamous lightning scar, I could recognize Potter anywhere.
Potter has just turned the street towards the apparition point when I shriek as loud as I can, "Potter!" He stops and turns around with a frown on his face. I stop infront of him, breathing hard.
"You may go now, Mr. Malfoy. Please be here by morning, if you can make it." Kingsley said. With a nod Draco finally apparated back home.
"He's so stubborn, there's no point in arguing with him. But that's what makes him such an exceptional auror." Kingsley sighed. "Come on, Mr. Malfoy, let's investigate the bodies first then you can examine the potion."
Harry apparates at the Burrow by 7 p.m. for dinner. As soon as he enters, he cinds himself wrapped up in someone's arms, soft hair tickling his cheeks. He realizes it's Hermione once she pulls back. "Oh Harry! I've been meaning to talk to you for so long! What you are doing for Malfoy, it's so mature of you to forget your past history and-"
Draco closes his eyes and thinks. What is his happiest memory? Probably when he saw the body of Dark Lord fall to the ground and saw his Dark Mark vanishing. He opens his eyes and tells Harry he knows what it is.
"I tried to apparate first, actually but when I couldn't, I thought it was because of my time in seclusion so I side-alonged with mother."
I want to squeal with delight, scream in ecstasy, jump up and down and shout to the whole world that finally, finally Dray, my best friend who I love with all my heart, is going to get something he wants. Get something that'll finally make him happy, after all the dark and tragic moments he experienced.
"I think you do, Dolohov." Harry said. "I suggest you speak up before I make you." As if in response, a few sparks burst from his wand.
The small cuts that littered the arms and torso of the body were deep as if made by a small but sharp knife. Draco cast a spell but he couldn't find any kind of poison in the cuts. He had been avoiding the huge wounds at the neck and wrists but he inspected them now.
"Okay, great. I want you to focus on the feeling and say the incantation; Expecto Patronum." Harry says.
Potter casts an Aguamenti and sprinkles some water on Dray's face. His eyes twitch and soon open. He blinks and sits up.
The man grabbed a goblet and threw it at the far wall. It fell to the ground loudly but stayed whole.
However, as he stared at the lopsided grin Potter was giving him, the undying light of excitement and happiness in Potter's eyes, Draco realized that he had been living a boring life. Potter looked as if he enjoyed his life to the fullest, even with his demanding job. Draco knew he did, just recently he had gone on a trip to Italy with his friends; it was all over the Prophet. So Draco decided that he'd ease a little bit too. Even if it was just a lunch, it was a start.
Draco was taken aback by the intensity the man's face held but he replied swiftly, "I didn't damage it, Sir. However, I hope we could talk in private."
Healer Brandon nodded encouragingly, his hazel eyes sparkling, "Good for you, Healer Malfoy. Certainly a good decesion. This says you want to start your month long-vacation from today?" He gestured to Draco's application.
Darkness surrounded Harry, the only sound that reached his ears was his own laboured breathing. Suddenly, the lights came back on and Harry stared at his surroundings.
His fingers left my wrist but his wand was still on the Mark's skull. He reached in his robes and took out a glass jar that he kept on the ground. Then he grabbed my wrist again, this time so tightly I yelped in pain but Potter didn't loosen his hold. Why? I understood in the moments that came next.
Harry tugged at their joint hands and moved towards the dance floor, finding the most uncrowded space and standing there. He watched as Malfoy stood infront of him, still not meeting Harry's eyes. Harry placed Malfoy's hand on his shoulder, his eyes never leaving Malfoy's face which now had a rather adorable cherry red blush on the cheeks.
"Nothing. Let's go." I whisper back. I could tell him, he knows about Draco's feelings too but he just won't understand and doesn't care enough.
Draco has no idea how to do that. He has tried before but to no avail. He tries, though, because he can't imagine living without magic forever. He relaxes, clearing his mind of all thoughts. Suddenly, he feels something cold trickling at the back of his neck, like someone casting a disillusionment charm.
"But it's still my home." Draco says weakly. That's when Harry noticed how badly Draco's hands were shaking and how red his face had turned. Harry realized how very wrong he was and now he had made Draco angry.
Draco covered his hands with the Protective Charm and cast a Filtering Charm on the vial to make sure that any poisonous fumes didn't reach him or Potter.
He felt Harry move more closer. Draco could feel Harry's warm breath on his lips. He couldn't wait for what was to come. His toes curled in his shoes and he fisted Harry's shirt in his hands. Draco had no idea how long it had passed when Harry finally, after torturing Draco sweetly, finally pressed his lips to Draco's.
Harry sits in silence for a while. Contemplating the situation, the pros and cons of accepting this job.
"We need to investigate this as fast as we can. As you saw this wizard is no ordinary one. The fact that we have no idea what he is planning makes it all the more harder. Mr. Malfoy, you should investigate the potion and the bodies we evacuated from the wizard's place as soon as possible. Harry, you should be there too. We don't know what it might cause." Kingsley said.
Harry nodded, he knew how much his friends cared for him and he was grateful for it but he just couldn't bare to see them get worked up because of
"Harry?" Draco looked up from his reading to look at Potter as a male voice echoed through the Senior Auror's office along with a knock on the door.
Draco knew that he could go back to the Manor and research there in peace but somewhere deep inside him, he didn't want to. Draco had gotten used to Potter's constant questions and even though he found it annoying and disturbing, there was some part of him that didn't want to be in the suffocating silence of his home. He wasn't homesick, he just felt uneasy there sometimes, specially when he thought about Dark magic or his father.
With a frustrated sigh Harry roughly cut the names of the other two potioneers; the name Draco Lucius Malfoy glistening brightly on the page, facing him mockingly.
Draco was once again speechless. He had no idea what Harry saw in him. Draco was pale, pointy and bony. Harry could have anyone he wanted and he chose Draco? The thought made Draco's heart flutter but he wasn't sure it was true.
Harry nodded and he felt a knot in his chest loosen. If Malfoy stayed true to his word then maybe this case won't be as miserable as Harry had thought.
"Glad you finally asked Mr. Potter though it would be extremely generous of you to invite me inside rather than having this conversation at your doorstep, don't you think?" Narcissa smiles.
"Fine. I'll ask someone." Harry turned around and grabbed his auror robes from the sofa he had kept them on.
"You mean friends?" They both spoke at the same time. For a while all they did was stare at the other.
With a trembling finger, the man traced the painting of an antique looking gold dagger, its hilt decorated with gleaming emeralds.
What in Merlin's pants happened to you?" Ron's loud voice exclaimed. Strange, Harry hadn't heard him enter his house.
"Sir Shacklebolt, Harry asked me to send this message to you. We are both fine but extremely exhausted. Harry will be reporting to you tomorrow." The patronus stopped speaking and then vanished into thin air.
"Oh, not at all. Sir Shacklebolt should be free in a few minutes, I'm sure." The girl was such a damn Hufflepuff her smile still didn't falter. It started to seem a little creepy to Draco.
The door swings open and Potter invites him in with a little smile though it doesn't reach his eyes. He still looked kinda off. "I hope you recieved my letter?" Potter asks him. Draco nods his head in affirmation and proceeds to sit on the couch. Potter doesn't ask him for tea today, neither does he look as interested in teaching as he had done the previous times.
Harry cautiously walked towards the place where he had seen the object in the photograph, casting spells to detect any jinxes.
Suddenly a loud shriek interrupts the music. I look behind me and see Pansy grinning like a cheshire cat, Blaise right behind her.
"You look ridiculous, Potter." Is all he says then turns on his back and plops himself on Potter's sofa.
"I just…they were terrible things, Potter. Even if I use my father's actions as an excuse, I can't really convince others or myself even. They were wrong actions; I know that now and I knew that back then too but I still chose to do them. I regret them, I really do but not only because they resulted in giving me a hard time in adulthood but because I truly regret them. I wish I could change everything I had done."
Harry was getting irritated with Draco's rambling. Couldn't he just address the point? It wasn't like Draco to blab about irrelevant things. And Harry still had 7 more reports to finish.
Kingsley sighed, "Take Auror Smith with you. He has investigated the house before. Don't tell him the details of the case, though. Tell him he's there for backup on my orders." With a replying nod Potter left the room.
Mother's demeanor instantly changed. Her shoulders stiffened and her mouth closed tightly. Nonetheless, Draco knew that she understood who he was talking about.
"I am afraid I can't tell you that until you make a Sacred Oath not to disclose this information to anyone." Kingsley replied. Draco scowled. Did Kingsley really think he would go telling people about what the Aurors were up to? He had more important matters at hand. He was about to get up and leave at such disrespect when Kingsley spoke again.
The man was an Auror too, a handsome one at that with chestnut brown hair, warm eyes of honey brown and a strong jaw.
She smiles at me and tears the wrapping paper. It is a necklace with a pug locket, which is Pansy's patronus.
And that wasn't the only thing. Robards had replaced his partner from Ron to Shab who was shabby just like his name. The mention of a new case and the guy got a serious illness of dragonpox. Harry had to endure hours and hours of chitter-chatter of Mrs. Celena about how she was the only witch with the most beautiful toenails, all alone.
Beside the dagger was a pile of what looked like powder. Harry touched it lightly but it was what he had predicted, powder. It was of a metal, bronze or copper likely.
Potter's answer was cut off by another of his stomach's grumble. "Oh for Salazar's sake! Don't you have anything to eat?" Draco glared at Potter who only rolled his eyes in reply.
"Oh. Okay then. Here, give me your hand." Draco spoke but it seemed as if Potter wasn't hearing him. His head was now bent, his breathing still short.
Harry gazed in horror at his hands, watching as they turned to sand slowly. He tried to stop it from happening. Willing whatever this was to
Draco grabbed another textbook in his hands. It looked particularly ancient, it's leather cover thawing at the edges. The Dark Arts of Potions was designed on it in peeling gold font. Draco opened the first page and gazed down the contents table. The text was divided in sections on the basis of ingredients which made it even more convenient for Draco.
He had seen Potter a few times at St. Mungos when he came with an injury from a mission but they hadn't really talked. Potter was always either wincing in pain or scowling at people when Draco saw him but in this picture Potter was smiling. The smile was so wide Draco was afraid it would split his face in two. A deep and rather adorable dimple appeared on his left cheek when he grinned. Looking at the photo made Draco's chest feel weird, probably from disgust, and he moved back.
Narcissa raises an eyebrow. "No matter what price I pay them, no professional would ever disgrace their name by helping a Malfoy."
"I believe you were recently on a mission?" He asked and Harry's heart dropped. So, Kingsley knew about the episode. "Yes." He replied trying to keep his composure. Kingsley nodded thoughtfully his gaze far away.
Ron however was a great auror. Hermione was the Minister's (Shaklebolt's) advisor. Ginny played for the Holyhead Harpies, George ran his and Fred's shop, though he wasn't as lively as before. Bill was still working at Gringotts. Charlie had come back from Romania, because he thought life was too short to not spend time with his family. He now worked as a cursebreaker at the Ministry, occasionally helping Hagrid at Hogwarts.
I posed infront of the mirror from every angle. Today was Pansy's birthday. I had been owling her, taking advice on chatting up a person, likes and dislikes of Draco, what I should wear, all kinds of suggestions, and because of that she was now Pansy from Parkinson.
"I am extremely sorry to call upon you so urgently, Mr. Malfoy but a rather serious matter has occurred in relation to the deal you made with us yesterday. You are requested to come to the Ministry as quick as possible. Please apparate to my office." Shacklebolt spoke in his deep and stern voice.
Turning promptly red and cursing his pale skin for displaying his mortification to the whole world, Draco ducked his head and spoke, "I was just..talking to..er-" He gestured at the girl, not remembering her name. Kingsley's smile widened, "I'm glad you've enjoyed the company of Sara."
He felt mortified for acting like a sensitive crybaby but Potter's comfort made him feel better than he had in days so he let go of everything he had kept bottled up; his unreturned feelings about Potter, fear of being married without his choice, fear of his Father, fear of losing his magic. Everything that had made him feel suffocated had now been released in the warm cocoon of Potter's warmth. Draco felt exhausted and his eyes fluttered, his mind still on his previous thoughts as he fell asleep, still in Potter's arms. His last thought was how he could be in them forever.
Kingsley placed a file in front of Harry. "This file contains all the details we know of currently about this investigation as well as the list of your possible partners. Go through it carefully and report to me tomorrow."
Kingsley chuckled again, "That's just how the Aurors are, Mr. Malfoy. You require a lion heart to become an Auror. To choose to die willingly for your people rather than live a life ridden with guilt is a hard choice to make but we must make it. However, such life and death situations rarely arise, Mr. Malfoy and all Aurors are aware of these conditions before they choose to join our force. Anyways, you shouldn't worry about that. Tell me, are you willing to help us in this case?" Kingsley asked.
Draco had thought long and hard about this. The reason for finally deciding to take a vacation was not because of the case he was assigned, though that was certainly part of it. Draco had never taken a vacation before. A few sick leaves certainly but never week or month long holidays. He wanted to spend some time on himself, some time with his Mother to take her mind of Lucius and remind her that her son was always there for her and cared about her a lot. The partnership with the Aurors gave him a final push towards taking the long deserved oppurtunity.
Malfoy huffed a little laugh at that, "I did more wrongs than you. If anyone has the right to live peacefully, it's you, Potter."
Draco's eyes widen at that. He doesn't want Potter to enter his mind at all but he doesn't want to delay using magic.
"Shall we get started with our meeting then?" Kingsley asked. Draco nodded in reply and followed him to what looked like his own office. "This is my office. We won't be interrupted here. Do take a seat, Mr. Malfoy." Kingsley gestured to two armchairs infront of the desk he was sitting behind.
"As you know, there is a Ministry ceremony, to thank the employees for their efforts, that is held every year." Kingsley continued, ignoring Potter's sharp exhale. "And this time, Mr. Malfoy is invited too since he's helping the Ministry."
I am so sorry for my reaction today. I was just reminded of something...surprising, you could say. I was actually very proud of you and thought you did a great job. Please do come on Saturday by 12, so we can progress more. I profoundly apologise once again. Don't take my reaction at heart.
"Don't fear him, Farley. It will only feed his power." Harry's voice was calm unlike the panic raging inside him.
"He means that he's going to make a scene at the ball. I know this is wrong but we can't really go against the Minister." Kingsley sighed.
"I read it and found the information I desired but...this book is dangerous, Asper." Draco removed the velvet from the ancient book, revealing the title.
He then grabbed his other hand and entwined their fingers together. Harry could feel his own cheeks warm but thankfully his tan skin didn't let it show much.
He stood in the middle of a bare land, almost like a desert except for the fact that the sand was brown-red. A wind blew past him and sand flew into his eyes. Harry closed them instinctively.
"Kreacher was in the attic. He likes to go there sometimes. He'll be here with the tea soon" Potter says, a little out of breath.
"Close your eyes." He finally demands. Draco does. If someone told his father that Draco obeyed Potter's orders without any hesitation, he would probably die of shame or break free and kill Draco.
He was pretty sure he had found what he was looking for; this potion was green like the curse it was named after, it contained emeralds that he was sure was the jewel used in the paste and it caused a painful death but Draco didn't get his hopes too high up, better not to than get them crushed.
"Yeah, I know that." He replies, not looking at Draco and trying to complete the freaking report as fast as he can.
"You still miss him." It was a statement, not a question and was stated so firmly that there was absolutely no room for arguments.
"Good. Now breathe in with me." Draco instructed, taking a deep breath. He saw Potter repeat his actions. "That's right. Now breathe out." Draco exhaled slowly, Potter following.
"Harry, calm down." Kingsley pinched his nose between his brows. "You don't have a choice; you have to come to the ball. And you too Mr. Malfoy. I won't hear anymore arguments." With a wave of his hand Kingsley dismissed them.
"To the library. I need to return this." Draco replied flatly, holding up the potions book they had issued before.
No one approaches me for an autograph or photo, probably because no one expects me to be here and the lighting is very dark. Thank Merlin for small favours.
"Yes but I just noticed something in the picture. Look. Those are the bodies, right? What is this shiny thing? I hadn't noticed it when I went there but it could be a clue." Potter was pointing to a place right on top of the head of one of the dead bodies. Draco was surprised to see that there was something shining there. It was such a small detail, it was astounding how Potter had found it.
"I'm about to kiss you, you imbecile Slytherin. If you want me to that is." Harry's words made a shiver run down Draco's spine. Draco didn't know how to respond to the question Harry had just presented him with so he said the only thing that came to mind.
Harry found who he was looking for sitting in a small wooden chair, eating Chinese take-away from a styrofoam container. The Senior Auror moved forward, his head held high and his face set in an intimidating scowl.
"But-" Draco spluttered, until Potter cut him off with an impatient roll of the eyes. "Oh come on, Malfoy live a little. I'm dying from hunger here; we need to do something quickly. Or the Chosen One will vanquish. Who will be there to save the world then?" Potter was grinning widely at Draco.
"Oh, no, there isn't a problem. Just…you remember the morning, right?" The guy asked, ignoring Draco's presence except for a cordial nod in the healer's direction.
He couldn't help the flutter in his heart when Potter looked him in the eyes without loathing, couldn't help the flip of his stomach when Potter smiled at him genuinely.
I don't look up as Potter puts his hand on my waist. My face flares up and I know he can see it because of how pale I am. The song in the background isn't something we can slow dance to at all but Potter doesn't seem to mind that. I don't look up at him, for fear of what I might find there. I've always been a coward.
Harry's vision had now gone completely black; he couldn't see a thing, couldn't even see the suspicious turn of the head from the suspected criminal as he heard the sound of breathing coming from nearby.
Harry gave a disbelieving laugh. "The ball? He's insane if that's true. The place will be swarming with Aurors."
"I'll be a minute." I announce to the room and run out behind Potter, leaving a confused Draco and Blaise behind.
This thought reminded Draco of the real problem he was dealing with. The wizard brewing the potion was extremely dangerous. Draco wanted to examine the potion sample as quickly as possible and then get rid of it. No need to keep anything evil lurking around.
The glare in the librarian's eyes intensified, "Did you damage it? If you did, then get ready to pay back for it, young man. These books are too precious for irresponsible men like you to ruin."
It was so much more magical, as cringy as it sounds, than Draco had imagined. Harry's lips tasted like tea, mint and something that was solely Harry. His lips were soft as a feather on Draco's and Draco felt like his heart would burst any second by how fast it was beating. He closed his eyes and tightened his fists even more, wishing Harry couldn't feel Draco's shaking hands. Soon Draco felt Harry's lips move against his own so Draco tried to move his' own in sync with Harry's. It felt like centuries had passed as Harry and Draco stayed as close to each other as humanly possible. Draco felt something soft and wet trace his lips, which he was pretty sure was Harry's tongue. The feeling was so different and so sublime than anything Draco had ever felt. Draco felt Harry's tongue enter his mouth and it tortured Draco in the sweetest way possible. Shyly  at first, Draco invaded Harry's mouth with his own tongue too but when he felt Harry moan in his mouth, Draco became more confident and his actions became more sure.
Draco felt the oxygen level decrease in the room at Potter's words. Somehow, he managed to nod and attempt a shaky smile which apparently satisfied Potter as he went back to his report.
His face was less pointy now, more angular; the high cheekbones and sharp jaw made it rather attractive. His eyes were the same grey they had been at school but they held something different now; they were gentler and kinder, less cruel. And it was true, Malfoy wasn't outright rude anymore, the occasional sarcastic remark or sneer was there of course but it didn't hold any real loathing.
With a nod Harry told him everything they knew of the case. The descriptions of the Dark wizard that the people of Purely had given, the house he was living in and the way the dark wards surrounding it felt, and of course the potion that was being brewed there.
"Yeah you. Posh, modern, expensive. By the way if the bill is more than 1000 galleons, I'm not paying. I would've been fine with pizza take-away." Harry muttered and picked up his menu too.
"How is your magic now?" Blaise asked, probably trying to stop a fight from breaking out between Draco and Pansy.
didn't go to today but shouldn't Shacklebolt consider that? Isn't there any respect, any consideration left for him?
Unfortunately, Potter had heard the remark and the minute he looked up with a furrow between his brows and a smirk on his face, Draco wished that the ground would swallow him up.
Draco skipped the potions that weren't of his use and marked the ones he thought could identify as the one he had observed.
A nervous thought entered Harry's already worried mind. He had asked Malfoy not to tell Kingsley about his relation to the case. Had Malfoy not listened?
When Draco had told everything to Blaise and Pansy, however, with an extremely red face not to mention, their reaction wasn't the same at all.
Harry takes a deep breath and casts Legillimens. Chanting repeatedly in his own mind that he won't open any doors that aren't of his use he moves deeper and deeper into Malfoy's mind. After searching all around and not finding anything, Harry is about to pull back when he feels a hum of magic. Following its direction, Harry reaches where he's wanted to all along. There is a golden light, albeit not very bright, but it is there. Its hum is light too but Harry can feel it nonetheless.
I see Potter nod and he reaches in his robe to pull out a tiny vial filled to the brim with a sky blue liquid.
"Good. So just try to make this float." Potter says, keeping a feather infront of Draco. With his wand pointing at the feather, Draco closes his eyes and tries to feel his magic but he can't.
The door opened and she entered. "Harry, Mr. Shacklebolt is requesting your presence in his office in a few minutes.”
Harry left the powder and turned his attention to the dagger. His hand reached forward to grab it and take it back to the Ministry with him, so he could investigate it later but just as his fingers wrapped around it, a pop sounded, announcing someone's apparation.
Draco knew he had wanted this, infact he had just thought about it, but now that it was actually happening, Draco's mind couldn't function. He couldn't meet Harry's eyes so he stared at his bony palms that were still on Harry's broad chest.
I gritted my teeth. Potter was acting like he was doing a huge favour coming here, which he was, my mind reminded me but this was his job, wasn't it? He was supposed to be professional.
He turned around to see his Mother staring at him worriedly. "It's okay, Mother. The aurors will protect me." Draco reassured her quickly, he didn't have time.
Malfoy's eyes burned, his nostrils flaring. He stood up suddenly, the book forgotten on the table. "I've been spending all of my time here, working on this case. I took a vacation from my actual job to focus better, to solve the problem, that might I remind you, was
I looked at Pansy with panicked eyes. She knew all about my feelings for Potter. I expected reassurance but Pansy looked just as surprised and shocked as me.
I sit there surprised. He didn't even say anything about meeting again. Wasn't he supposed to ask Draco out? Or had I misinterpreted his behaviour? I am pretty sure no one caresses someone's face the way Potter did if they weren't in love with them.
"Potter! Potter, look at me." Draco placed his palms on each of Potter's cheeks, a rough stubble tickling his fingers, and forced Potter to look at him.
It was painful. So very painful. Potter twisted his wand tip on my skin and the snake hissed in pain, writhing. I felt bursts of pain but they weren't unbearable, it was nothing compared to the Crucios I had endured but then Potter lifted his wand from the skull and brought it down on the snake's head with so much pressure that I threw my head back and screamed. I tried to pull my arm back but Potter's hold was tighter than chains.
Draco had no idea what was happening and he couldn't cure it without knowing what the problem was. He cast a charm for relieving headaches but whatever fit Potter was having was probably not a simple headache.
With a loud pop, a very tense Draco and a famished and extremely oblivious Harry Potter, disappirated.
He expects Potter to hex him but Potter surprises him by giving a rich, loud laugh that makes Draco's heart flutter and stomach churn pathetically.
Harry chuckles and follows him out the door towards the appirition point to apparate to the Burrow for their weekly getogethers.
Draco stared at Potter. The guy was serious. Draco remembered their First Year; when Potter had rejected his friendship. It had humiliated him in front of everyone but more than that he was emotionally hurt more than he'd like to admit. Draco could do that now. Take his revenge by rejecting Potter's request of friendship but he couldn't bring himself to. Draco's desire to be friends with Potter was still kindling inside him, even if it was foolish and vain. He knew that after the war, his evil acts, Potter would never want to do anything with him but here he was, asking Draco to be his friend.
Potter, probably seeing the anxiousness on my face, said, "Nothing will go wrong. We have already done this on over 10 others, and it worked perfectly." He had seated himself on one of the chairs around the table and was looking at me with what could be a mixture of reassurance and impatience.
Harry gave a soft knock on Shacklebolt's door, and received a loud "Come in!" in Shacklebolt's rich, heavy voice. He entered the brightly lit office with a deep breath.
"Ron!" Hermione slapped Ron's arm, though Harry wasn't sure if she did that because Ron had called Draco a ferret or because he was speaking with food in his mouth.
His gaze turned to Malfoy who was watching him curiously, expectantly with his chin propped up on a fist.
"You must be wondering why you would help us. You, of course, owe us nothing but we do require your help. If you demand of me what you want and I will be able to give it to you, I definitely would. That is in return for your assistance in this case." Kingsley said in that booming, deep voice of his.
"Maybe if I knew why you do the foolish things you do, it'd be more tolerable to be around you." Draco thought it was a good enough reason. He wouldn't tell Potter that he actually did want to be friends.
"Y-you don't understand, Mr. Potter. He- the man, he's dangerous." Farley stuttered; his eyes wide with fear.
Nothing can break us because I want to be wrapped in those arms, I want to kiss those lips, I want to hear that laugh, see that smile, forever.
Kingsley nodded seriously. "This is a very important and arduous case, Harry. It is to be kept confidential from everyone. And by everyone, I mean
"It was... a mistake." Draco muttered, his fingers playing with the cover of the book he had been reading.
"Say what you want, Potter, but I'm telling you, be careful. Don't...don't go to the…ball." Dolohov said.
After she had saved him from Voldemort and everything had settled, at the time of the trials, he had defended Narcissa and Draco but not Lucius because he did do wrongs unlike his family. So Narcissa had gotten away with only 1 month in Azkaban, which was no longer guarded by dementors. Draco, however had to spend 3 months in the prison due to the extreme nature of his crimes. Lucius was  sent to Azkaban for 2 years. Other than a final fine of 3000 Galleons,  in Harry's opinion, the family's punishment was not that severe.
"Oh? How many potions do you use on your hair? And these robes you're wearing? Let me guess hundred percent pure silk. And-"
Draco closes his eyes again and thinks. He has no idea what other memory there is so he just thinks of his first day at Hogwarts but once again only smoke comes out.
Draco thought of following but decided it would be better to secure the potion in the vial first. So he entered the investigating room again, his head swarming with worried thoughts.
"If Malfoy agrees, I will help you." Harry says. He knows that he owes Narcissa and if he rejects this, she might ask for something much more difficult. Besides, it can't be that hard. Harry can teach a first year, Malfoy should be an easier student.
Perhaps a mistake? Draco hoped it was because if it was some kind of manipulative act to lure the Aurors towards whatever the man wanted, Draco didn't know what that would mean. And he had no desire to.
I grin at her and turn left and right. "Do you think I look okay?" I ask nervously, waiting for her approval.
I see Potter raise an eyebrow at me. "You didn't answer." He whispered and I notice how his beautiful, luscious, pink lips moved as he said those words and now all I can think of is those lips on mine. I force myself to look up and this time what I see makes me shiver. Potter's irises are so wide, his eyes are almost black.
"The hell?" Is the only thought in his mind after he has finished reading it. Not only did Potter send him this letter at this time of the night, he apologized, actually apologized to Draco. What 'surprising' things had he realized, anyways that he had left Draco without so much as a 'Good job' or 'Goodbye'? Draco knows he should say something, say how disrespected Draco had felt when Potter had that expression on his face or when Potter exited unceremoniously but all he could feel was a warmth in his heart at the fact that Potter apologized. Damn his lovesick side, damn Draco's unreturned feelings.
"How long will it take for me to feel my magic?" He asks feeling both dread and hope waiting for  the answer.
Potter grinned in reply at him. Draco rolled his eyes at the actually happy expression on the git's face.
The sound of the door creaking open interrupted Draco's thoughts and he jumped, dropping the photo clutched in his hand to the table. His head whipped around to see who had entered.
Harry rolled his eyes, of course Malfoy would say that. "How very Slytherin." He mocked in good humour.
With a smile Harry told them, in less crude language, about how he was feeling. A long silence continued when Harry was done.
Harry frowned as he read the case file Kingsley had given him. It stated that the villagers had a strange man amidst them. It was the quaint town of Purely.
"Here, appirate to this place, it is your partner's office. He already knows you will be coming." Kingsley handed Draco the parchment who took it with a raised eyebrow.
"But it's not lunchtime yet." Draco said. He knew that the Aurors were only allowed to leave the Ministry for lunch or investigations.
Blaise closes the lid and I notice how he tries not to make more contact with the jar than necessary.
The next day Draco apparates at Potter's place all alone at exactly 11:48 a.m. He knocks on the door and waits for Potter to open it. As soon as Potter does Draco nods him in greeting and recieves a nod in return. Today Potter is dressed in muggle clothing. He is wearing a weird green shirt with two strings hanging on his chest and some fabric hanging on his back. Draco has no idea what the garment is but whatever it is called, in Draco's opinion it is a disgrace to respectful clothing. So when Potter turns around to meet Draco's eyes in the living room, Draco being his usual embarrassing self blurts out,"What the hell are you even wearing, Potter?!" Then he immediately claps his hand over his mouth and his eyes widen.
, Harry. I know you've never solved a case without your team but I would never have given this to you if I did not believe you to be capable enough for it. It is hard, of course, this case is very challenging but I believe in your abilities."
Harry grinned and chuckled, and Ron pulled his fingers out of his ears with a small glare at Harry’s mirth.
Draco continued their easy strides toward Harry, finally reaching his lap. Harry smirked, cheekily tucking a single paper banknote into Tarasque's bra.
I imagine this news is rather upsetting to you. But I have faith that you’ll recover. After all, from what I hear, you’re no stranger to grief.
He glares at me but continues. “You were going to live here with Astoria, one day. You were to be the next generation to carry on this proud Malfoy tradition. But I suppose,” his free hand grasps the curtain. “Everything has its end.”
Draco chuckled. “If you think I’m missing work just so you wind up back in here because you restarted bleeding during sex, you’ve another thing coming.”
Harry's heart stuttered. Unthinkingly, he reached out and grabbed the pale wrist. "No, Draco, you misheard me. I said I could never
“Well, I wouldn’t be surprised if there was some resentment, but I highly doubt this Little Red person is one of them. Little Red clearly wants to leave their mark. They want everyone to know that they were the killer. I would wager that if a Neo Death Eater were to go on a revenge killing spree, they’d make it a lot less conspicuous.”
“There is no problem we cannot solve, Draco,” Mother had said. “Your Father and I will make it all right.”
Harry cleared his throat. “Well, er, I’ll see you around, Malfoy,” he said, nodding one final time before turning to leave.
Harry’d insisted on keeping plenty of pictures, both magical and Muggle, around the house. There were moving pictures of all their friends and family–Ron, Hermione, the entire Weasley clan, Andromeda, Teddy, and Harry’s parents. For Draco’s part, there was Narcissa and his found family, Cori, Claire, Silver, Pansy, and Blaise.
"Almost all of both of our vaults, now that we've both signed the papers," Harry said. "We should be fine; thank Merlin for the goblins' discretion."
He squeezed his eyes shut tight before he opened them, blinking as the unfamiliar room came into focus. He could feel his pulse pounding in his head as his mind raced in a heady mix of confusion and anxiety. What happened? Why wasn't he in his flat?
The panic returned as Harry took slightly shaking hands into his own. “No, love, we think it’s just the ones wanted by the Ministry. You’re safe, I promise.”
“But we’re acting as if it has!” Luna scoffed. “We’re all pretending like the only survivors of the war were people who knew better. Do you really think everyone on the Light side was accepting? You don’t have to be a Death Eater to be bigoted. But there are Death Eaters out there, and I think they’re plotting to take advantage of that!”
But Malfoy’s confident smirk as he sank to his knees made warmth pool in his groin, his hesitation lost to excited anticipation. Harry suppressed a groan and felt his cock twitch.
It's a small story in the Prophet. The kind of thing in the back corner of a paper Harry never reads, anyway. He only saw it because someone had left the paper on the counter in the breakroom flipped open to the society section.
"What's wrong? Are you okay?" It was difficult to stifle the amusement and affection that fluttered in Draco's chest at Harry's immediate concern. "Did he hurt you?"
Because the only person able to recognize him under any disguise was currently sitting at the bar, swirling a glass of firewhiskey in his nimble hand and pinning Harry in place with familiar gray eyes.
It didn't matter, because even before the first bite, the first kiss, Harry's heart and his blood had belonged to Draco from the first time their eyes had met across the crowded Muggle bar.
Harry's eyes were bright, slightly wild and protective. "I found her in Diagon. She was so lonely; her fur was all matted and dirty, I couldn't just leave her! She didn't have any tags or a collar."
Draco felt the bed dip next to him, Harry's weight next to him solid and reassuring--even if neither of them knew what they were doing.
the potion whispers in his ear. He checks his forearm once more to make sure the glamour is still holding and, seeing Potter standing alone, adjusts the silver Colombina mask on his face and approaches him.
Sometimes, when the ache of missing you is a little too strong, I close my eyes and imagine your comforting grip, solid and real; the way you used to be. I pretend you really are on my shoulder as if you don't have anything better to do in the afterlife than hang out with me; than to keep your promise.
This time, it seems Voldemort had left Harry's subconscious to its own horny, teenaged devices--and it apparently had a twisted sense of humor.
They walked out into the moonlit air, letting the cool wind brush over their skin and refresh their wine-heavy bodies.
Harry felt pained, a lump rising in his throat. "I was...Just, give me a second." He felt around in the suitcase once more, checking the only pocket he hadn't opened. He was filled with relief once his hand clasped the box. He pocketed it quickly.
Malfoy immediately collapsed on the ground, blood seeping through his clothes. Harry watched in horror as Malfoy's chest rose and fell in shallow breaths. He ran over to Malfoy, kneeling next to him.
I don't have much time. But I'm not sure if I'll have a chance to do this when most people do. I also have no idea if I'm doing this right. My only experience with this was with Dumbledore, and to be honest I didn't pay much attention to the wording.
His own words—written on the parchment he'd sent off with his owl before he could stop himself—were burned into his memory. He still remembered the searing pain in his chest as he promised the love of his life that what they'd had could be forgotten. In breaking Harry's heart, and in shattering his own, his only consolation was knowing that Harry would be happy eventually; that Harry would move on and find someone with the freedom to love him the way he deserved, someone who could offer the intangible riches in which Draco had always been impoverished.
—consummated their relationship, which made Weasley turn as red as his hair, Granger unable to make eye contact with anyone for five minutes, and Draco want to both vomit and chug the rest of the firewhiskey.
It must've only been two minutes when he felt magic wrap around his body, drying and warming his skin at once. His eyes snapped open and he sat up in surprise, looking around until he saw Harry a few feet away.
“I’m your friend until you can handle more,” Draco’s expression was sharp, but uncertainty shone in his eyes.
he whispered into Malfoy's mouth as he rutted against him. They spilled in their trousers not long after, clinging to one another as they gasped their release.
“I was thinking...We have a list of people who were members and their known whereabouts, but...do you think you might be able to help me figure out where the missing ones might be?”
The fog was thick above them, concealing any shooting stars that might soar across the sky. It didn't matter. Draco breathed, letting his exhalation be his silent thanks to the universe.
Harry gave him one last disgusted look before leaving the bathroom, the door slamming behind him. Malfoy’s sobs echoed against the tile walls.
With a sudden surge of confidence, Draco leaned in first, letting his lips barely brush Harry's and watching as the other boy's eyes fluttered shut.
You wait until the world outside is blanketed in darkness, where the two of you can hide what you do, how you feel. When you're certain that the interrogative spotlight in the sky has sunk westward, you move toward the door without looking at him, hoping his eyes are following the lines of the suit you wore just for him. The first time you'd had it on around him, he'd been reckless enough in his want for you that he'd sent you the signal to meet him outside as the sun was setting--before the darkness had settled.
“I’ll tell you what: I won’t argue about you missing work or not having sex until I’m recovered if you let me take you to dinner once I’m healed and if we can snog as much as we like.”
Ron started toward Draco, his fists clenched, but Harry grabbed his arm, despite the rage swelling in his own chest.
And Harry’d let him slip through his fingers like sand. He thought they’d have time, that the right moment would eventually arise to tell Draco that he made him glow inside. But then Draco announced he was leaving and the light went with him.
"Yeah, what'd you think? I hope it made up for me being late. I'm sure you were about ten minutes from breaking up with me," Harry said with a chuckle.
She wondered whether her lipstick looked cracked on her chapped lips as she gave her son a soft smile, gathering every ounce of love still left in her heart with the effort.
He wove his fingers back into Potter’s hair, this time moving from the front, and pressed their lips together. Potter adjusted quickly to the kiss, wrapping his arms around Draco’s neck.
“Yes, and how’s that been going? Has prejudice against Muggleborns been decreasing, or just bubbling under the surface?”
2. He loves Quidditch, but not just because it’s competitive. He loves the feeling of flying, the wind in his hair. He loves the freedom, the chase of looking for the snitch. He loves having a single-minded mission and focus to find this little fluttering ball that’s meant to fool him.
He hoped his face didn't look as green as he felt, but if Draco's concerned expression was any indication, he was unsuccessful.
Harry ran reverent, trembling fingers over the grooves. "How did you find this? And--" realization dawned on him, and he looked up at Draco in shock. "Wait, how did we get here? You can't Apparate into Hogwarts!"
I rush home, my errand forgotten, and all but collapse onto the couch as I breathe deeply, as my Mind Healer taught me. There are times when it feels as if my chest is being squeezed in a vise; my heart is shedding its skin as it's forged in a crucible, the present reckoning with the past. In these moments, I try to center myself. I find my body's equilibrium. I grasp for the middle I know rather than sit on the edge of insanity, of oblivion.
“Two days. You were hit with a rare curse that caused an ever-bleeding wound in your side, and the healers had to put you in a magically induced coma to reverse it.”
It was a miracle that Harry'd escaped with his life, truth be told. But in the end, Voldemort had killed enough of the Order that the Light defenses dwindled. Draco'd defected early on, realizing quickly that his father was involved in a cult-like organization that no amount of prestige was worth the price of joining. Draco hadn't returned home after Sixth Year, instead being transported by a determined Harry, a wary Granger and a nearly green Weasley to Grimmauld Place.
Suddenly, Malfoy rose on shaking legs and walked over to Harry, who quickly stood to meet him in the middle. Harry regarded him with a tight-lipped smile.
His seventh and eighth-year peers were sitting in a large circle and guffawing—likely over some scandalous reveal or embarrassing moment that had occurred in the weekly bonding night.
The night Harry Potter died, a single set of footprints lead into the ocean. By the next day, the tide had washed it away.
“Harry, you of all people have to understand!” Luna’s eyes welled up with tears. “I can’t just let him go! The Nargles are right. I’m the one who has to bring justice! I’m sorry, but the Aurors don’t do shite!’
“Shut up, Potter. Fine. I started working at the Kitchen after eighth year as part of my parole and I haven’t left since. I haven’t been back to London since the War. And I’ve never met Teddy Lupin.”
Harry took a deep breath and walked into the classroom. He waited for the stares, for the astonished gasps, for the wide eyes. But the Muggle students just saw
Draco nodded. "Your parents, I'm almost certain. Minerva confirmed it as your mother's magical signature."
Harry held him every night. Let him sob. Let him shake. Let him gasp apologies, sputter out his regrets, give penance to his demons.
But here, in my bedroom, on this parchment, I can daydream about you bursting through the front door, wand blazing. You'd storm through the living room, up the stairs, throw open my bedroom door and say, "Malfoy, you're a git, but you don't belong here. Come with me."
“Thank you,” Luna sighed. “Anyway, my father’s killer mentioned being friends with Lucius, so I thought I could get more information if I came here. I wasn’t going to kill Draco’s father.”
"But really, Harry, you'll be great. You just need a bit of help. Now, take my hand again, yes good, and the other on my shoulder, right, there you are. And my hand goes on your waist. Now we move. Just follow my lead."
Being a Ministry-hired Explorer meant a life of solitude, but Harry wouldn't have it any other way. There was nothing quite like the rush of finding a completely uninhabited planet, imagining all the ways his country could improve the lives of its citizens.
“Honestly, Potter, we might as well resume our game from last night if you’re going to pester me with these questions.”
After that, the two of them had gone for a drink, and Harry'd been a champion at differentiating between Draco's pronouns as Tarasque and those as himself. They'd talked and laughed and flirted until finally, Draco realized he was spending more time at Harry's flat than his own, to the point that Tarasque had their own small closet at Harry's. Draco'd even gotten into drag at Harry's flat when running late.
A new person--someone Harry was confident he didn't know--suddenly appeared at his bedside, looking over him with a stoic expression and checking some beeping machine beside him. They came and went quickly, shutting the door behind them. Harry turned his attention to Draco, who he now realized was clutching his hand; Harry was grateful for the sensation, grounding and real.
Still, Harry grinned through it all: the pictures, the interviews, the galas, the fundraisers, the random interactions with weeping fans. He grinned even as his cheeks ached, his friends' expressions shifted to worry, and he could only move his mouth to speak and eat.
I watch Pansy go on dates with men she doesn't care for, see her eyes linger a little too long on women in tight dresses. I watch her acquiesce to her parents' attempts to see her married and settled, and I watch her clench her jaw when her suitors' hands grip her waist a little too tight or their rough mouths attach to hers without warning. She always unfolds for them, lets her body go limp. It seems submissive; I know it's calculated.
He ran toward it, fury rising in his chest at the sight of the torn fabric. Desperately, he cast every detection spell he knew at the scraps, but no traces of magic remained.
Well, considering that I have recently accepted the fact that we belong to this classification, I think this exercise is all the more prudent, even according to our old standards.
Harry grinned and dashed away toward the front door. Draco Apparated to the front of the Manor, smoothing his robes and breathing deeply to make it look as if he wasn’t nervous.
I was thinking of the best way to send you a message; to even the score between us, in a way. To let you know that as you continue your little justice mission, you’re to leave me out of it. And that I’ll do you the same courtesy.
“Just because they weren’t in the inner circle doesn’t mean they just stood around. Sometimes, it was the minor players that did the most damage because no one was looking at them.” Draco’s eyes glazed over slightly, and his expression was faraway.
Other times, she'd let herself stare unabashedly at her sleeping husband; his long, shining blonde hair loose from its ponytail and draped down his back, his shoulders. If she was feeling bold, she might lean in toward him, trying to remember his lemongrass scent. She would run her fingers through his hair the way he used to let her, humming and arching into her touch.
"You don't think being the in-laws of Harry Potter would give your parents some status," Harry spat. Draco's eyes widened.
The potion’s effect was hazier than a Pensieve, but this way he could see the memories from his own point of view; could relive it in his own skin. Still, his mind couldn't do justice to Harry's eyes, the bright sound of his laughter, the warmth of his skin.
He hoped he’d know the answers, one day. And that that particular day was far, far away. And for now, as he took Draco’s hand in his, he knew they’d fall asleep in one another’s arms. He didn’t have to hope.
Draco woke every night, gasping for breath. He fought to forget the grip of Nagini around his throat, the Fiendfyre blistering his skin, the relentless undulation of his body under Aunt Bella’s cruel Crucio.
I wish you could meet Draco, could know him. I think you'd get along; you're both written in the sky, but he's here, with me, in person. He holds my hand instead of my shoulder, and it's nice to feel him like an extension of myself.
When he thought about it, Draco couldn't believe he'd been willing to disrupt all of that after three silly dates with Harry sodding Potter. To think he'd ever considered himself important enough to the Savior to merit more than three dinner engagements and one rather fantastic shag.
But tonight, Harry’s mind was far away from the warm timbre of his boyfriend’s voice, the gentle scratches against his scalp.
. He set a timer on his wand for seven minutes, planning to use the last three to dry off and head to his last class of the day. But for now, he could drift a little longer.
“There’s nothing left for me there. Father’s in Azkaban where he belongs, and Mother’s in the south of France.”
Draco nodded again, not trusting himself to speak. He took the wand from Potter’s hand, closing his eyes and welcoming the familiar spark of magic as it traveled through his fingers and throughout his body.
The body fell to the ground, and he stood over it, lips pursed. "Is my hair really that messy?" He tilted his head, shrugging. "No matter. Time is running out."
The rest of the Wizarding World was ready to move on from the war, even Harry, who’d taken up with a reformed Draco Malfoy of all people. Luna supposed people could change, but she wasn’t willing to sit idly by and wait for it.
Draco chuckled a little at the memory, now sucking in their cheeks as they expertly applied the contour, remembering not for the first time how right their drag mother had been. They continued to contour around their jaw to give the appearance of a longer, thinner neck.
“Another murder?” Harry took the newspaper and read over the headline: LITTLE RED STRIKES AGAIN: NEO DEATH EATER FOUND DEAD, WRAPPED IN RED CLOAK
Harry blinked rapidly to make sure that the sight of tears welling in Draco's eyes was, in fact, real and not another strange dream.
He scrambled around the room, opening every drawer, checking every carry-on, and scanning the area for the tiny velvet box. It wasn't in his trousers from yesterday, it wasn't in the sock drawer, it wasn't in the bathroom, it wasn't--
Draco reached into his pocket. The note was still legible, despite the messy scrawl and its journey since being folded and carried around with him all day. He knew what it said, had read and reread since he’d woken up to find it taped to his door.
Potter pulled out the chair in front of the table and sat, awkwardly scooting forward. Draco suppressed the instinct to smirk mockingly and instead flashed Lyssa a genuine smile as she handed them the menus.
Draco’s smile was soft, small. “Of course.” His face shifted into one of worry, his eyebrows furrowing. “Harry, do you have reason to think they’ll target former members, too?”
"If you think that's true, you're more delusional than I thought. Ever think about getting those pretty eyes some better glasses?"
Draco softened. He pulled Harry into his arms, pulling them both down to relax on the bed. "I know, love, but now that we've been together for almost a year, and we live together for Merlin's sake, I hope you'll start letting me give you at least some of what you deserve. I can't buy you the world, though I would if I could, but I can give you treacle tart for breakfast, for starters.
"I came here as soon as I could! I left your flat in a rush a couple weeks ago because of an emergency call and it turned out to be a really time-sensitive mission. I was only allowed to go back home and pack a bag before I had to take a Portkey to--it doesn't matter. Basically, we were only supposed to be there a few days but it turned into two weeks and we weren't allowed any Owls or a Floo and I felt
Draco and Harry had taken pains to renovate Grimmauld Place when they’d moved in together. The two of them stripped the house of its dreary and depressing decor, and Draco had been absolutely giddy to remove the nasty old portraits in the house, weeding out the ones they no longer cared for by completing the task in full drag. Any relatives that spared Draco anything more negative than a genuinely curious expression found themselves quickly stripped of their place on the wall.
eyes on his back. He stepped out into the chill night air, sticking his hands in his leather jacket for warmth while he waited.
Harry looked up to see Ron looking grimly at him and holding out the Prophet. Harry shivered; if that old rag actually had a trustworthy story, there was little doubt as to its subject.
You walk outside, letting your eyes adjust to the lack of light around you. As you walk to your usual alleyway, you don't look back to make sure he's coming; you know he is. This is how it works, how it always has and always will.
Sure enough, Potter remained. Very much real, and very possibly naked, though the bedding covering his lower half left that fact a mystery.
Harry shook his head. “You lost that right. You said you were done! You said you weren’t taking the Mark, that you were leaving and going to Dumbledore. You’re not my friend; you’ve burned that bridge. You’re no longer Draco to me.”
They’d added a refrigerator and a few other Muggle touches to make it more accessible to Harry and surprisingly more convenient for Draco, including a television. When they’d first moved in, Harry’d had a hard time prying Draco from the television. And now, Grimmauld Place was the regular gathering spot for all Drag Race watch parties, which inevitably ended with everyone sleeping in the living room, drunk and giddy with laughter.
"Yes, yes, 'Oh Smart One.' So surely if you can manage potions you can figure out how to cook! It's basic chemistry!"
"Honestly. Of course I tell people those things! It's a protective measure, so they take us and our relationship seriously."
Standing on quaking, bloodless legs, he tried to brush some of the grime from his torn and tattered robes, but the effort was futile. It was no matter; he needn't pretend to be clean, letting the flesh reflect the madness and all that.
Of course, she shouldn’t have expected her father’s killer to be so kind as to hand his body over to the proper channels.
I want to laugh again. How do I tell him that the force guiding me to him is magnetic? That I couldn't resist his pull if I wanted to?
The old grandfather clock in the living room of Grimmauld Place struck 2am. Harry paused as he was bringing the glass of firewhiskey to his lips to acknowledge the time, allowing a voice in his head that sounded far too much like Hermione to say its piece.
And every night, once his tears were dry and his throat was raw from screaming, Harry would conjure him water and whisper calming, grounding words. Harry would tell him he understood, that he knew nightmares like an old friend. And Harry would help him lie back, help his pillow seem less daunting.
Draco shut his eyes for a moment and nodded. "I know. You've said that every day for the last month, love, and it breaks my heart every time. But if you let me, I want to be the one to give you everything you deserve, for as..." he trailed off. His voice was thick and quiet when he spoke again. "As long as you let me."
Ever since Harry turned up outside of his flat, awkward and determined with ‘I love you’ on his lips, Draco no longer needed to hope for celestial intervention beyond the thick haze above him in order to find happiness, contentment.
Potter’s face shifted, and Draco’s breath nearly caught at the familiar expression on adult features. His eyes were smoldering like slow-burning embers, the promise of erupting into flames if provoked just so. His jaw was set, this time in determination.
"I sort of have feelings for you," Draco mumbled under his breath, barely loud enough for Harry to hear.
Potter grinned, sharp and wicked. “You’re not the only one who knows the bed-warming benefits of cocks and arses.”
Potter had the decency to look ashamed. “No, I—I believe you, Malfoy, I’m just surprised. I always imagined you’d go into politics or become some business tycoon or something.”
And I'm far from it--perfect--but you still inspire me to be better every day. I know I'm not the most...forthcoming with my more vulnerable emotions; you've always worn your heart on your sleeve while I tried convincing myself and the world that I didn't have one.
They stood there a moment too long, Potter's hands lingering on Draco's hips and Draco unwilling to brush them off.
Harry bit his lip, considering, and then sat up. “Actually, there might be. Have you heard of Little Red?”
A journal, a calendar, a pen, a wallet, his wand, a duffel bag of clothes and toiletries, and his 1999 Audi A4.
Harry shook his head. “Your feelings are valid—and understandable. But I promise, I’ll do everything in my power to protect you, and I always will.”
It's real, Draco. You're alive, you have friends, you're stable, and you have him. You call him Harry, but you also call him "love" and he calls you "babe" and you're thriving, together.
The potion had seemed like a good idea. It had been advertised as a surefire way to force your brain to be happy.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go. I'm going to fold this parchment and seal it with a spell and tuck it into a drawer within this desk. And then I will walk into the living room of the flat I share with Harry and I will snog him senseless. And I'm going to do those things because I can—because we can.
Turning his face blank, he gave Potter a sharp, robotic nod, and spun on a heel. He should’ve run away when he’d had the chance.
"It's performative, Potter. Most of them don't actually care," Draco shook his head. "It's easy to point fingers at a former Death Eater who's trying his best than it is to confront their own prejudices."
The song ended, and the crowd rose to its feet in applause. Tarasque smiled and bowed a little before handing the microphone to his other friend, Miss Schegoss, the drag queen host of the evening.
A HUGE thank-you to my lovely beta, @luciennart on Tumblr and @writingsbydestiny on AO3! I hope to continue to satisfy your love of all things dark with this series.
Potter’s blush returned to his cheeks with a vengeance. “Thanks, Luna,” he mumbled into his drink as he lifted it to his lips before taking a sip.
Now, Harry could almost hear it; but to him, it sounded like tears, hot and grieving sobs that flowed of their own accord.
I hope you end up sickeningly happy, Potter. If anyone in this world deserves that, it's you. There are times I think that every possible outcome for my future is one of suffering, torture, and pain, whether at the hands of a victorious Dark Lord or the Dementors in Azkaban.
After promises to fulfill the fans' requests later, the giggling group left the table to let him eat in relative peace--it was rather hard to enjoy one's dinner while half the school was staring at you.
Harry tightened his grip. “Conversation’s over. If I catch you trying to ‘talk’ to him again, I’ll make sure you have a nice chat with the Wizengamot about sexual assault. Now, apologize.”
He let his eyes roam the crowd of students, rolling his eyes when he identified a boy with bright ginger hair. So distracted he was with applying his parents' lesson that he failed to notice the boy with messy black hair and green eyes who stood next to the Weasley.
Draco was greeted by two furry faces and wet noses when he crossed the threshold into Grimmauld Place. One of the dogs jumped up, but Draco was able to gently correct the pet before his clothes became more dog hair than fabric.
This is my favorite thing I've written, I think. So here's a sequel because I couldn't resist. It's based on a different Anna Nalick song called "Scars." Enjoy.
Treacle tart, dinners with Ron and Hermione, the Leaky Cauldron, Grimmauld Place, Sunday brunch at the Burrow, playing Quidditch, and...Malfoy.
Harry’s chest tightened. He used his grip on Draco’s hand to pull the other man into a tight hug, using his free arm to push away the papers. He closed his eyes and smiled when Draco’s muscles tightened briefly before melting into the embrace.
, look. "You, of all people, cannot possibly have forgotten the most regrettable, unremovable tattoo on my arm, have you?"
Harry matched him, glaring. "I recognize it, Malfoy. I see it all the time staring at you from across the field. But clearly not enough to catch the Snitch when I'm too distracted by you!"
"Like I said, you're not bad company. Maybe we can continue our conversation from last night--just with less alcohol," Potter smirked.
Draco couldn't cry, so he let the sky do it for him. He shivered, soaking it up like the grass crushed under the shirt clinging to him like a second skin. He closed his eyes, imagining that the drops sliding down his face were the tears he couldn't muster, the catharsis he hadn't earned.
harry hadn't realized he'd closed his eyes. he blinks and looks at Him. he sees gray, he sees lust, and nothing more.
Draco's face went soft, all of a sudden, his scowl dropping. "I thought you did. Don't you? I tell you how I feel, all the time."
Now, exploration and expansion was still an accepted practice, but taking populated land from another group was strictly outlawed.
But with someone like Draco, you'd think there'd be a softer side, one that only Harry got to see. You'd think that when they were alone together, in the quiet of their bedroom, he'd be sweet, romantic. He'd give Harry his private smile, the one where his mouth curls up the corners and his eyes go a little hazy and it makes Harry's heart skip a beat.
Draco'd felt terrified coming out to Pansy, but she'd just taken him in her arms and told him she loved him no matter what. And when she found out about his nonbinary drag persona, she'd been ecstatic.
He flew around for most of the game, dodging Bludgers and Quaffles that crossed his path. No luck yet. He leaned down to increase his speed and hardly noticed that he passed another player, his counterpart on the opposite team, the other boy's white-blonde hair shining in the sun.
Granger shrugged. “C’mon, Harry, you’ve always said you wanted someone to help. Maybe Pansy can…tame it,” a look of uncertainty flickered over her face.
Draco's head nearly snapped as he turned to look at a pale-faced Harry sitting in the chair next to his bed. Near Harry stood an unfamiliar woman scribbling on a clipboard. She reached over onto a side table and handed Draco a paper cup. The water was cool, a relief for his parched, sandpaper throat.
As part of my social reparations of the war--combined with the usual hazing endured by all Aurors fresh from training--I am given nothing but unwanted cold cases. You see, when the Boy Who Lived Twice goes missing it’s the kind of story that feeds the symbiotic relationship between law enforcement and the press. But after a while, even the Golden Boy’s whereabouts are less interesting than the newest scandal or criminal operation, fresh chum to the circling sharks.
He hoped Remus finally made peace with the moon, that a scar would never again mar his skin. He hoped Sirius had his leather jacket and his bike. He hoped his father was still messing up his hair, and that his mother rolled her eyes. He hoped Tonks fascinated them all with her magical features and sharp wit.
They still bickered, occasionally fought. The sight of them having boisterous arguments over trivialities might raise a few eyebrows, but one downward glance at their tightly clasped hands swinging casually between them would dispel those rumors.
“Took you long enough, Potter!” Malfoy stepped out of the box, sputtering through the wrapping. Harry’s eyes widened.
He sat down in the chair across from Draco, who glared at him over his cup of tea. "I thought I told you not to follow me."
Not when Harry walked with him, held his hand and laughed at his jokes while people watching in Washington Square Park.
Generations ago, in ancient Galatia, there was born a dragon. Bred from Onachus and Leviathan, the creature lurked in treacherous waters, waiting for the right moment to leap out and strike, claiming men to feed its insatiable stomach. With sword-sharp teeth, poisonous breath, and a constellation of spikes across its back, this fearsome beast was the fright of man and the envy of demons.
"How predictable," Pansy said evenly, seemingly entirely unaffected by the physical exertion of running up a set of stairs. "Going up against an evil ghost without a strategy. You do realize the rest of us are mere mortals, right Potter?"
He looked around at the friends who’d dared to come back to Hogwarts. Pansy sat next to him, lazily shifting the food around on her plate with a fork; she’d returned to school under pressure from her parents, with the spark of confidence gone from her eyes. Blaise sat across from Draco, quietly eating his broccoli and looking around the Great Hall, which was lit up and decorated lavishly to celebrate the opening feast as if the place hadn’t been close to ruin just months previously.
"So, are you really not going to go for the apprenticeship?" Harry asked, eager to bring his complexion back to normal.
He filled his lungs with air, less for function and more to remember that he could lighten his body, even if for a moment. He wondered if he could take a breath too deep for gravity's hold; would he barely hover above the ground, blades of grass tickling his skin? Or would he float up up up up until he met the rain at the source?
But it hadn't just been the intoxicating pleasure; no, Draco made Harry's blood rush and his heart quicken in moments that Harry'd nearly forgotten about the sharp canines that were hidden beneath those wryly smirking lips.
Of course, that didn’t mean he and Harry had a smooth relationship; but if Draco wanted it to be easy he’d have signed his love on a dotted line next to Astoria Greengrass’s name, sired an heir, and let himself fall into complacency. If there was anything his father had taught him about relationships, it was the luxury and convenience of apathy.
Draco looked at him flatly. "Harry, you absolute idiot, of course I like you! Why do you think I'd be here if I didn't?"
Draco rolled his eyes. "Of course. Honestly, I did you a favor. You were practically made for Gryffindor."
Malfoy barged in, smirking in a way that sent a familiar jolt down Harry's spine. "Just here to see how the Savior's holding up. Honestly, Potter, this is a bit sacrilegious, isn't it? Living in the house that should belong to a proper Pureblood?"
Cori looked at the other two queens, who grinned and nodded in agreement. Then they turned to Draco and gave him a soft smile. "Sure thing kid. Stick around after the show and we'll try it out."
The covers are pushed down to your waist, revealing the pale, scarred torso that you let me worship tonight. You let me kiss and lick a hundred apologies into the raised skin.
Draco hung up and canceled the spell. He walked quickly to the Apparition point. While grief still ached in his chest, he still felt the warmth of hope and relief spread throughout his body. He picked up the pace, not wanting to waste another second away from Harry when he pictured a night of pasta, cuddling, and slow, wine-scented kisses on the couch.
The old grandfather clock in the living room of Grimmauld Place struck 2am. Harry paused as he was bringing the glass of firewhiskey to his lips to acknowledge the time, allowing a voice in his head that sounded far too much like Hermione to say its piece.
Draco stood smoothly from the stool and regarded the other man, enjoying for the second time that afternoon his new height advantage over Lucius. He looked down his aristocratic nose and twisted his face into a perfect imitation of his arrogant sneer from boyhood. Harry would be proud.
“Now, Potter, it’s not a competition. I think we’re too old and too tired for that, don’t you?” Draco said, his tone light but still chastising. He signaled the bartender for a drink, and he downed the neat Firewhiskey in one gulp the moment the glass slid into his palm.
Harry lay trapped in the full-body bind, hearing murmured voices above him. He identified Dumbledore's low timbre, Snape's nasally drawl, and Bellatrix's cackling laugh, but there was another unfamiliar person he couldn't place.
Draco started on makeup, having already washed and prepped his face. He’d shaved his eyebrows soon after starting drag, and he’d always been hairless on his face, so it only took a quick cursory glance over his face to make sure he hadn’t any hair to take care of.
“We’re here for you. Whenever you’re ready. But this Mind Healer can help with what your friends can’t.” Draco looked at Harry steadily, his stare searching.
Potter rubbed the back of his neck. “No? I mean Ginny sort of had it all planned out. I never looked at the map.”
Draco tried to find indignation or annoyance, but there was none. Instead, he found something unnamable, yet vaguely familiar.
Draco chewed his lip in indecision. On the one hand, his pride screamed at him to let Potter suffer in the cold. Serves him right for not kissing Draco back immediately. But then...
Draco smirked. “Potter, if we’re to spend this time together, we might as well get small talk over with, and I can’t do all the work.”
The steps outside of The Lambs Club seemed a little steeper after two glasses of wine, but Draco still managed to cross the threshold with some dignity. The same could not be said for Potter, however, who nearly tripped in his haste to follow him out the door of the restaurant. Draco was congenial enough not to openly mock him.
Promising a future when they can’t predict the next hour. Promising that it’s real, that they’re alive and can’t lose what the others can’t see.
Then Harry had a thought that made him groan in frustration. “Gods, Kingsley’s going to make us patrol longer isn’t he?”
“Another murder?” Harry took the newspaper and read over the headline: LITTLE RED STRIKES AGAIN: NEO DEATH EATER FOUND DEAD, WRAPPED IN RED CLOAK
But Harry couldn't. Despite every Gryffindor urge in his body, every impulse that screamed at him to show up on Draco's doorstep in the pouring rain with flowers and 'I love you' on his lips, he knew it wasn't his place. Draco could resent him for the rest of his life if Harry pushed him to end things with Astoria just to end up brokenhearted with him.
It wasn’t like a flower sprouting through the earth, or the sun peering through the clouds; it couldn’t be compared to a bullet piercing the air and rupturing its target, or jumping from a waterfall into a crystal blue lake.
So, he shrugged. “Alright, why not?” Draco took a seat among the other students and summoned the firewhiskey bottle and a glass from the middle of the circle, pouring himself a drink. Hopefully, the firewhiskey would make him too sleepy to participate.
"No, we're not." Draco turned to look into bright, hurt green eyes. "You can't expect me to concede to your vision of what our relationship should be. You wanted to break up, and that's fine. But I don't need to give you absolution for the shitty way
Draco nodded, seemingly mollified. Harry distracted Draco with choosing the sauce and the appropriate wine, courtesy of the Grimmauld Place wine cellar. When Draco came back into the kitchen, Harry had already drained and served the pasta onto two plates, one with a marinara sauce for Draco and the other with parmesan and garlic for Harry.
“Beats paperwork at the desk,” Ron said with a shrug. “C’mon, let’s face the music. The meeting starts soon.” They walked away, the newspaper left open on the desk.
It would be easy to send Potter away. It would preserve his pride, that's for certain. And perhaps Draco of 18 hours ago would've done just that.
"Shh, shh," Harry knelt next to Draco and wrapped the shaking boy in his arms, rubbing his back in soothing circles. "You're alright. Take your time."
Harry could've turned and walked away. He could've looked away from Malfoy's knowing gaze and left the bar. He could go back to his Audi and drive to
Draco huffed harshly, causing one of the locks of his hair on his face to flutter in the air before falling back onto his forehead. "Well, Harry, not everyone is quite as forgiving as you."
“Maybe,” Harry shrugged. “Trouble is, I don’t care. Now, will you be here for a while, or are you coming home with me?”
"You're a cheater, Draco. You cheated me out of my reward, cheated the Dark Lord out of his prize, and cheated the world of ending this rubbish war sooner. You are a dirty little cheater, aren't you?" Her voice was quiet and precise, like torturous water droplets that made Draco feel like he was drowning.
Harry considered this for a moment, before nodding slowly. Malfoy's apologized to everyone at the beginning of the year, and he'd thus far followed through on his promise of having changed. The two of them had managed to partner in Potions without fighting, which was a refreshing change of pace for them; of course, not trading punches and cutting insults meant that they cleared a bar that was set at the core of the earth. Still, it was an improvement, and there were even times that Harry found himself being amicable with the git.
Harry let out a disbelieving scoff. "That's all you have to say to me? You didn't think I read the Prophet? What, you didn't think you'd get caught?"
All he knew was the steady grip of his hand around his wand while the other grasped at the newspaper, crinkling it in his palm. All he knew was raising it, closing his eyes, and breaking through layers of ancient magical wards to Apparate within the Ministry of Magic.
Harry huffed, adjusting the blindfold over his eyes. "I know, Draco, that doesn't make me less curious! I've been waiting for this all month. You've been so cagey."
Harry's breathing grew labored. "M gonna come," he breathed, expecting Malfoy to pull away. Instead, he merely moaned and took Harry in deeper.
Potter grinned when Draco took the warm hand in his own and stepped forward. Potter used that one arm to easily pull Draco onto the dragon's back.
Satisfaction twisted in Draco's chest, hot and sharp; he looked at the man who used to be Father but who would now and forever be Lucius. The man's hair was thinning and becoming more silver than blond. Draco rubbed a hand over his own clean-shaven face, relishing the jealousy the flared in Lucius's eyes. Father had always liked his face free of stubble.
Draco laughed again, too amused to ridicule Potter for his naive stupidity. “No! Geoffrey and Lyssa own the restaurant. The Lambs Club provides food for some of the residents.”
Harry turned his eyes up to the ghost, which was currently chasing Zacharias Smith around the lobby. Smith let out a blood-curdling scream as he followed the crowd down the steps. The ghost went after him but stopped when it locked eyes with Harry, making his breath catch.
A loud crack pierced the air, startling her. She sniffed the air and panicked when she detected a distinctly human scent. She took off into the forest, leaving the strips of fabric in the snow behind her.
Malfoy looked at him but said nothing. Even as Harry waited for his drink. Even as they each took long, slow sips from their respective glasses. Even as the silence stretched thin and charged between them.
She waved a hand dismissively. “He’s your problem, now. Just get him out of my flat and back home intact, will you?” She didn’t wait for him to respond, walking away into another room.
Thank you both for being the best friends I could've asked for. I hope you have the happiness and life you deserve.
He decided to give them a moment before approaching Malfoy, but if he didn't get this over with now, he'd never have the courage.
Harry faltered, grasping nothing as he searched for an excuse. Draco smirked as he noticed Harry’s conclusion.
He pulled Malfoy against himself, letting his fingers trail over his cock; Malfoy let out a sharp gasp. Harry leaned in, his breath against Malfoy's neck, his lips hovering over the sensitive skin.
Sure, it wasn’t exactly the countryside; Harry remembered long nights in the Forest of Dean, looking at the stars and losing himself in their infinite patterns. When one would occasionally shoot across the sky, he made a wish every time in the hopes that one of them might carry it to whoever was designing his fate. He would count them to keep the nightmares at bay for long enough to sleep until he was inevitably woken by his traitorous subconscious; luckily, the stars would often still be there, a twinkling, comforting reminder that the world was bigger than it seemed.
Deceptively plush lips trailed hot kisses down Harry's neck sucking little bruises and love bites in their wake. Harry moaned, tipping his head back. He could feel Draco's smirk against his skin as he let his fangs graze across the sensitive skin there, not enough to make a dent but plenty to send tingles down Harry's spine.
Before the Sorting ceremony, Draco stood with his friends--well, more accurately, the children of his parents' friends. But, as his parents had informed him, social and political alliances could last just as long as feuds, which could endure for generations; essentially, Father explained, the Malfoys had been aligned with the Parkinsons and the Goyles for as long as they'd hated the Weasleys, and that's how it would always be. Continuous, unending.
"Asking me post-coital if I'd like to attend the Weasley Family Brunch is Slytherin-level manipulation."
Harry shook his head. “It's the only way. This ghost is too powerful. But I think if we can combine the powers of our proton streams, it’ll be enough to blast it." He looked at Draco expectantly. "Are you all with me?"
When Draco sarcastically called Potter the “Chosen One” with his patented sneer, he’d always thought that it was unfair that Potter got both love and fame. Never had he considered that Potter didn’t love it in return. He never thought that someone
Draco made a Mistake. A Very Big, No Good Very Bad Mistake because Potter was unbuttoning his shirt and Draco forgot about Potter's toned abdomen and he thought he himself might require medical attention if he wasn't allowed to lick them and--
Those lips curved into a small smile. "Okay then, Potter, since today is Friday, shall we meet at the entrance and walk together to Hogsmeade for our first date?"
It wasn't a substitute by any means. It would never replace what it was made to mimic. In some ways, it was hopelessly inadequate.
Harry struggled under the binds, undulating his arm enough to cast a wandless, nonverbal slicing spell to both free himself from the rope and retrieve his hat. He didn't miss the brief widening of his attacker's eyes as Harry jumped to his feet with ease.
Harry didn't think, he just pulled Draco over and wrapped him in his arms, smiling when the blonde head rested on his chest.
Finally, he rose from the ground and brushed the dust from his robes just as the trio turned to run off into the night. He watched them leave, even as Potter turned around to glance back at Draco.
They convinced her, of course, the mischievous little creatures. They told her that it was the right thing to do. That’s how she’d been raised after all: to follow her morals to a fault.
To Neville Longbottom, I leave the Sword of Gryffindor. You're one of the bravest, most Gryffindor people I know. This should belong to you.
“Not that it’s any of your business, Potter, but I do live in the city. And as I was just saying, it’s been a long day of work and I’d like to retire to my flat.”
Harry cast several detective charms on the enormous box. The words “Handle with Care” were stamped on it in large red letters. There wasn’t a return address, making the package all the more suspicious.
"No problem. You're not bad company, Malfoy," and Potter gave him another one of his easy smiles, like Draco was someone he just...
How could he, when Draco was next to him, talking animatedly, his smile almost as bright as his eyes? How could he move an inch when Draco's hand was clasping his arm, warm and sure and
He hardly recognized himself. His gray eyes were enhanced by thick eyelashes and his face looked thinner, more feminine. A dark wig framed his face and brushed his shoulders. The red lipstick was bright and striking with his features. It felt like meeting a different part of himself he'd never known could exist.
Luna raised an eyebrow. “You wouldn’t know what it’s like, having your father be an influence on you, would you, Draco?”
Draco was still awake, listening to the slow, steady breathing of his new roommates as they slept peacefully. He studied the drapes that hung around him, taking in the view from what would be his bed for the next year. With a pang, he remembered his bedroom in the Manor, with its light blue walls and dignified antique furniture that had been passed down from both the Malfoy and Black families for generations.
There was a knock on the door and Draco waited a second before he answered it with a raised eyebrow. "Well?"
"Ready?" A woman with dark brown hair and kind eyes spoke, pulling Draco from his thoughts. She smiled at them, offering a quill to Harry, who took it and scribbled his name on the line at the bottom of the page. Draco then followed suit, his heart pounding as his hand followed the familiar motions of his signature.
“No, I’m not. But I am glad you’re okay. You are, right? He didn’t hurt you?” Harry’s chest tightened at the suggestion.
"Your fiancée found you unconscious in your flat. We completed a blood test and couldn't match the substance to anything we know—"
Yes, I referred to him as Harry. Don't worry, we still call him Potter when he being a particularly annoying prat. But our relationship now lacks the violence to which you're accustomed.
He shuffled toward Draco, still on his knees, as Draco's expression shifted from neutral to one of total confusion.
For the fearfest prompt: "they've killed before, they'll kill again!" Warning below, so ignore if you don't want spoilers:
And from my perch, my station, I got a perspective few can claim. I teetered on the edge: between Light and Dark, between Good and Evil, between Child and Adult, between Love and Hate. The line was razor-thin, sharp like my Aunt's blade yet steady like a firmly-clasped hand in mine.
For a moment, the only sounds Draco heard through the phone were loud honking horns and chatter from the street. Then, Harry spoke.
Harry let himself glance over to the figure at the back of the bar. Draco wore a muggle suit just to drive Harry mad, everything perfectly tailored to his lithe form. Draco smirked, his lip curling slightly to reveal one of his sharp fangs, a promise for more. A quirk of a blonde eyebrow was all Harry had to see to know it was time.
For example, I once thought I’d be an up-and-coming political figure; the youngest Wizengamot member in a century, heading several charitable organizations and waving off speculation of a campaign for Minister.
Harry brought the glass to his lips and tipped his head back, letting the liquid burn a trail down his throat and settle in his stomach, already calming his nerves. He blinked and looked back at the dancing pair when finally the blonde man turned his head to kiss his dance partner.
Draco opened the door to the eighth-year common room, wincing at the conspicuous creak. He surveyed the room quickly enough to see that his suspicions were confirmed.
So he knew that when Potter turned around, defeated, and walked back into the party, the door closing behind him with finality, that it was well and truly over.
Draco flushed. "I approached her to apologize and then she wouldn't bloody stop talking at me. I just sort of...sat there and nodded occasionally."
Harry nodded. Hermione narrowed her eyes at the two of them before giving them a mollified nod. Clutching her books tightly, Hermione turned on her heel and walked briskly toward the library.
Harry didn't want to admit it but his interest was piqued. On the other hand, he was surprised why the Dark Wizard wasn't attacking Dolohov to prevent disclosure of his evil plans.
"These are the terms of the removal." He said, laying the parchment on top of the table I was sitting on.
"Fine, my arse. You're clearly worried about something. Now tell me what it is." Ginny gave a final tug on his hair and stepped back to admire her handiwork. Apparently, she was satisfied because she took a seat in front of Harry.
"I'm Draco Malfoy." Draco introduced himself to the man although he had no doubt the librarian knew he was already.
With a final glance at his office, Harry slid his wand in the holster on his arm and disappirated to discover a clue to who was after him now.
He was quiet for long enough that Harry decided he should interrupt, "Er-Sir?" Kingsley's gaze turned on Harry and his distant gaze disappeared. “Harry, I have a new case for you." He folded his hands on the mahogany desk, his posture and gaze reminding Harry strangely of Dumbledore.
