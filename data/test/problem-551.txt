“You think my name is funny, there’s no question who you are, second hand robes and bright orange hair, you’re a Weasley.”
Ron snorted, holding back laughter.
“Potter, Harry.” The woman who was calling out the names, professor McGonagall, called out and everyone in the hall went silent.
However the journey was soon over and they were all ushered into the great hall for the sorting ceremony. They were given a quick explanation of how it was going to work before the names were called out. Potter was quite far down the list so Harry took the time to look around the hall, the first thing he noticed was the bright hair of the Weasley twins. They noticed him and sent him a quick wave but started to whisper in each other's ears again. He looked up at the teachers table, there was Hagrid and professor Quirrel as well as a black haired man with a long nose and a short man with a rather tall hat. Despite the other interesting things in the hall Harry stopped at the man in the middle with a very long beard, Dumbledore from the chocolate frog card, he wondered if the man knew what had gone on with the Dursleys.
“It was probably nothing but he seemed a little off. Y’know, a little broody.” Pansy explained, slightly exasperated.
Harry liked Ron, he did, but he was feeling the need to strangle him, the boy hadn’t let him leave the compartment to look for his soulmate. Harry knew Ron would let him go if he told him he was looking for his soulmate but he had a feeling his soulmate didn’t want anyone to know about them.
“Gryffindor!”
Ron turned bright red and Draco turned back to Harry and held out his hand.
Harry looked at Draco, he seemed to want Harry to shake his hand but there was a sort of pleading in his eyes, telling Harry to push him away.
However he was already equipped with the perfect slytherin response,” Pansy, I already know that if I was to measure that skirt it would not fit in the schools dumb uniform rules.”
Blaise just shrugged and said goodnight to Pansy before following Draco up the stairs. Pansy suddenly felt pretty tired and grabbed her cloak off the back of the sofa and started up the stairs however before she reached her room she realised they had left pillows everywhere and she was going to have to clean it all up.
The bathroom is beautiful, black tile and silver faucets. Some of the tiles looked like there were snakes on them. On the far side there was a deep bathtub, inset into the floor with a step leading to it. Severus placed the clothes on a shelf next to the bathtub and turn on the faucet. “Harry, would you like bubbles in your bath?” Harry smiled shyly and nodded. He'd never had a hot bath, much less one with bubbles. Severus smiled back. “Come feel the water, make sure that it's not too hot.” Harry came closer and stuck his hand in the water. It felt wonderful.
The boys had long gone to bed when Severus and Lucius got together to discuss how they were going to present Harry at the Winter Gala. They decided that they were going to introduce Harry merely as Severus's son, and hope that people didn't ask too many questions. Knowing that most of the pure blood adults paid little to no attention to the children, they thought that it would be a safe plan. They would also make sure to keep an eye on them. Instead of separating the children from the adults as usual, they would section off a small section of the ballroom and sound proof it, so that the children could play and not disturb the adults.
“You don’t like Remus, but you want me to spend time with him?” Harry asked. Severus sighed. Harry being so intuitive about people’s emotions was sometimes hard to explain.
“I... I get my own room?”
Minerva walked in the doors of the infirmary, smiling in a 'cat who ate the canary' kind of way.
“Mrs. Malfoy said that the old knights didn't use wands like wizards today. That their magic was wild and powerful. Mr. Malfoy is going to teach me how to use magic without a wand. Severus blinked several times. Harry continued to eat.
“Your... what? How do you not have a son last week, and have a son now?!? Uncle Sev, what is going on?!?” Draco stomped towards the couch and Harry, who scrambled back and away from him.
“I am going to go back to the school and talk to him, before he does… whatever it is that beasts do during the holidays.” Lucius kept his impassive face on and nodded at Severus, but inwardly snickered at Severus’s venom. Narcissa smiled gently at Severus, ignoring it.
“I am so sorry that you had to go through that, Harry. But I can tell you that as badly as they treated you, and as much as you wanted them to love you, that’s how much you are loved now. And no one will ever hurt you like that again, so long as I have strength to stop them. I love you so much, Harry.” Narcissa could tell that Harry had fallen asleep, the emotional retelling of his former family having drained him. She wrapped her arms more firmly around him and rested her cheek on his head, the tears finally free to slip down her cheeks. “Never again.”
“You are right, Lucius, in more ways than you know.” Severus told Lucius about Harry's scar and screaming nightmare, and how Severus had been unable to locate anything in his research regarding curse scars that matched what he had seen. He knew that Lucius had a wide knowledge of Dark Magic, and a far more extensive library.
“Mrrow?” Harry almost thought that it sounded like a question.
“Okay. Are you still mad at him about it?” Severus made a face, and Harry giggled.
“Why are you doing this?” Harry asked quietly. He thought maybe the man was a follower of the bad man, and was worried about all sorts of things that he couldn’t really pinpoint. He was mostly scared that this man was going to hurt him. He thought that the man hadn’t heard him because he didn’t stop moving and didn’t respond, so he was surprised a short while later when the man responded.
Severus’s eyes opened, but he remained motionless, registering the room around him and trying to figure out why he was awake. He slowly sat up and looked around the room, not finding anything that would have wake him and not hearing any noises. Concerned about Harry having a nightmare, he got up and went to check Harry’s bed. His eyes widened when he got to Harry’s room and saw that it was empty, bedding rumpled and Shadow nowhere to be seen.
What none of them noticed was the older man who maneuvered so that he could watch the small group. After about half an hour, the man noticed that Snape's new adopted son brushed his hair out of his face and noticed something on his forehead. His eyes grew big as he realized that Severus Snape had adopted the Dark Lord's greatest foe.
“Harry, what’s wrong? I noticed that you seem to not want to play with the other kids recently. Is everything okay?” Harry looked down at his feet.
“I don’t know. I need to ask my father. Is it okay if I take you with me to talk to him?” Harry could almost see the glow from inside the egg shift, as if whatever creature inside had moved.
My love to you all, and thank you for reading. Please stay safe.
Severus made his way back to the infirmary as quickly as possible, and got to the doors at the same time as Minerva. She was wearing her dressing gown but Severus didn't feel bad for interrupting her night, but in order to get her assistance he would pretend that he did.
“Are you ready to go out? Harry nodded and Severus went looking to see if there  was outdoor clothing included in Narcissa's largesse.
“The second thing that I have is new clothing for you. A friend of mine gave them to us. Would you like to get dressed?” Harry nodded enthusiastically. He didn't know the last time he had new clothing. Severus got up and held his hand out to Harry, leading him back to his room. Severus went to the wardrobe on the other side of the room from the bed and opened it to reveal that it was full of clothing. He pulled out a handful of items and turned back to Harry. “How about a bath before breakfast?” Harry nodded, and follow Severus to the bathroom.
The next few weeks fell into a pattern that was very satisfying for all involved. Harry went to the Malfoy’s house each weekday morning, on his own now, and continued his lessons and playing with Draco while Severus taught his Potion’s lessons. Part of each afternoon was dedicated to learning wandless magic with Lucius, who started Harry with meditation to help him concentrate and focus on his magic.
Lucius and Narcissa sent Draco off to make his plans for his adventures with Harry after the Snape family left. Narcissa looked at her husband.
“I apologize for the lateness of the hour, but may I come through? I wish to discuss something with you both.” Narcissa and Lucius looked at each other and shared a silent conversation, wondering what was so important that Severus would want to talk face to face. They both nodded, and a moment later Severus stepped through. He wandlessly spelled the lingering ash from his robes and took a seat on the wing backed chair next to the hearth. Narcissa and Lucius took seats side by side on the adjoining love-seat.
“Okay.” Severus smiled and ruffled Harry's hair, smiling as he realized that Harry didn't flinch this time.
“It appears that I cannot pass through the wall on my own.” Harry walked back out to where Severus stood.
“I know how you feel about me. Why are you telling me all this now? Did you think that I would fly into a temper and try to murder Dumbledore for his negligence?” Severus flushed mildly, knowing that his reasoning wasn’t too far off.
“A pet already, Severus? I am impressed.” Narcissa moved further into the room and held her hand out for Shadow to sniff. He did, and then gently licked one of her fingers before going back to purring. Narcissa smiled at the cat, then turned her attention to Harry. He was tiny for his age, even smaller than Draco who was rather petite. And so shy. Narcissa knew that if Harry and Draco became friends that Draco would be the one who took the lead.
Harry continued to be a serious and polite little boy, but he began to open up more to those he considered his family. This included Severus, Draco and his parents, and Tippy (much to Severus’s amusement and Lucius’s dismay). Tippy adored Harry and began to clean the chambers while Harry was around instead of silently and invisibly in the middle of the night. She began to carry a feather duster around while she was cleaning and straightening, which puzzled Severus since he knew that her elf magic made all dust just disappear. Until the evening when he caught her tickling Harry with it and Harry running around his room giggling, and teasing Shadow with it. Once he saw that, he merely smiled and refrained from commenting.
“Have a good day, father.” Severus smiled back.
By the time he emerged from the Potions lab, it had been several hours. Draco and Harry were playing in the playroom, and Severus went there to gather Harry. He reassured Draco that they would be back in a couple hours for dinner for Christmas Eve dinner, and Severus and Harry flooed back to Hogwarts. Knowing that it would be an easy way for Remus to spend time with Harry, Severus sat Harry down. Harry’s Occamy friend and Shadow came out and sat on the floor next to them.
“I feel that you should know that almost all of Draco's animated toys treat young Harry like he is the Pied Piper and they are the rats. It's rather stunning to watch. “ Lucius nodded, distracted.
“Welcome, child of Magic.” Harry blinked, not realizing that the statue would talk.
“Yes, well… Other than Narcissa and Lucius, you are the only other person that knows all of this. I would hope that you would keep it that way for the time being. In my experience, the more people that know something, the easier it is for it to get out unwanted.” Remus nodded his head.
“I would like to attend the party, Father.” Severus nodded and put his hand on Harry's shoulder.
“I am okay. I was worried about some things, and Aunt Cissy let me talk about them and made me feel better. And then I took a nap.” Severus sat down on one of the love seats, and Harry sat down next to him.
Severus moved around to the back of the house silently, using long honed skills as a spy. He peered in the back window and watched the family eating dinner for a moment, tilting his head back and forth as he processed what he was watching. The horse-faced woman he remembered as a teen was obviously Petunia, and she now had a pinched look to her face that did not improve her appearance. Sitting across from her was a grossly overweight man with a large mustache, obviously her husband. Sitting in between them was an equally overweight child, about 6 years old, with pale blond hair and a nasty expression on his face as he demanded that his mum put more food on his plate. Severus narrowed his eyes at the scene. Where was Harry?
“It’s okay now. You are safe, so it’s all okay. Next time you feel like you have to do something, wake me. I won’t stop you if you feel that it is important, and will make sure that you are safe on your adventures.” Harry nodded against his father’s chest. Remus felt like he was intruding on a private family moment.
Draco proceeded to place the creatures all up and down Harry's arms and shoulders and even on his head. All of the animals acted like Harry was catnip to their cats, and walked all over him and played with each other. Draco was delighted, and convinced Harry to sit down on the floor so that he could do the same with his legs while Harry giggled at the sensation of the tiny animals running around on him like he was a playground.
“Looks like someone needs a baaath.” Severus said. Harry giggled, and Severus stood up, still holding Harry in his arms. “We will be back.”
“Your father had a large inheritance from his family and didn't need to work, but he did. He was an Auror, which is kind of like a Muggle police officer. Your mother was very smart, and was going to be a teacher, but she decided when you came along to be a stay at home mom until you got a little older.” Harry blinked back tears, already loving them and wishing that he could have met them.
Severus pulled Harry to the side of the hallway one evening as they made their way down to dinner.
“My dear friends, the story I have to tell you...” and he told them everything. He told them how he had mended fences with his childhood friend, and what happened when he was asked to check on the child of that friend.  Lucius was angry at the thought of any magical child having been mistreated so terribly by Muggles, but Narcissa was irate as a mother that ANY child have to go through being abused. By the end of his tale, Severus was explaining how Draco had shown up and startled his new son with his demands and all three adults had drinks that a house elf had brought.
“I was just trying to help, to earn my way.” he heard Harry say in a small voice, just barely over a whisper.
“Harry is currently asleep on Narcissa’s lap in the lady’s study. She sent me away, and I kept the boys away, so I got the impression that whatever they were talking about was very serious.” Severus set the glass down without drinking it, and started making his way towards the study. He stepped into the doorway and saw Narcissa, face drawn as if she was exhausted, looking at him above Harry’s curled up sleeping form. Seeing him, Narcissa gently started waking Harry up.
Harry wakes up on the 5th of May and glances at his calendar. It's been a month and a week since he's visited Godric's Hollow, and Harry thinks it's time to go again.
Flower Shop Boy
All Harry can think of is two things.
2. Malfoy thinks Harry stole his bloody flowers for some girl and wants Harry to
That's a blatant lie if he's ever heard one.
Harry hurries to match Malfoy's long strides - God, his legs are endless - his mind racing, his hands clammy around the flowers.
"She's far too young to be having sex, but to each their own, I suppose." Draco shrugs and rushes to grasp Harry by the arm. "Come on, I'll make you some tea, no?"
"Right then," Malfoy cocks his head. "Take me to this special girl. She better have eyes the colour of the literal fucking ocean, or I swear to Merlin, I'll press charges. I know you've been doing this for over a year."
"The girl must be pretty enough to warrant flower theft."
and flips it to
Harry suppresses an annoyed sigh and throws a glare over his shoulder at Draco. He readjusts his grip on the Muggle hammer he insisted they use - why the fuck did he suggest that? - and tries to slam the nail harder into the plaster.
The outside of the club looks innocuous enough - Harry thinks that's why he's not as apprehensive about this whole thing.
And now that Harry's feet have gotten a taste for wandering, they can't seem to understand his protests as they drag him up the pastel blue steps. It's ridiculous, how little control Harry has of his body parts, and he tells himself that's why his whole body is on fire; and most importantly why his cheeks probably closely resemble a tomato.
It's funny, really, Harry thought that the biggest of surprises were all over and done with back in his 7th year, sometime around when he somehow managed to die and then come back to life. Fun times, to be quite honest. Fun times.
This.
But, this Malfoy is fucking beautiful. Harry would have had to be blind to not see that. This Malfoy has blonde hair pulled back into a low ponytail and soft grey eyes and wears a large cream jumper and ripped denim jeans.
Malfoy hasn't yet turned around.
It's not his fault, really. The garden sort of spills over the white picket fence around the property of the house, and sometimes the flowers are too pretty to pass up.
Harry's the Golden Boy - he has nothing to worry about. Most days, he tries not to show how much that annoys him. Anyway, back to Harry's problem.
What an interesting turn of events, Harry thinks as Draco turns back around to tend to some droopy looking flowers.
hard? Ginny had never let him to it do her - or, actually, now that Harry is thinking about it, he's pretty sure he'd never wanted to do much more with his ex than slight kisses. "I've never done this before."
The one where Harry Potter goes to Diagon Alley to help Pansy Parkinson and just happens to see Malfoy through a shop window.
How the fuck does he tell Malfoy they're less than a few hundred feet to the graveyard and that's actually where they're going? Harry wants to cry, and that's the truth of it.
) "I guess we'll have to go with mine."
But then again, he's glad he never did, otherwise, they'd all be cowering under some No-nosed bald guy's rule.
Harry's fine. He truly is. It's not like he feels as though he can suddenly sprout wings and soar the skies, not at all. It's just that Draco Malfoy is staring at him, Harry Potter, with something akin to
Lavender. She didn't like random, quirky bookish finds like Hermione did, didn't like experimenting in the kitchen with Ron like Hermione used to. Not to mention the curls in her hair are all wrong.
exactly, Ron's already flashing a badge at somebody in front of a desk, and they hand Harry a key. Ron pats him on the back, stepping back and folding his arms like a proud Father. Harry opens the door to the far room on the right - the one shrouded in shadows that almost makes it impossible for him to stuff the key in the keyhole because it's so dark. Stepping inside, he shuts the door behind him.
Malfoy isn't singing when Harry allows Lavender to practically chuck him into the shop, and he can't help but think that the girl is far too strong for her own good. In a strange sort of way, it reminds him of Hermione, reminds him of that quiet fierceness that's there - hidden underneath layers of femininity and intelligence, sure - but still there nonetheless.
But actual human interaction? Nah, doesn't suit him.
Godric's Hollow is brighter than where Harry lives. Of course, it's still England, so the sky is clouded over and Harry doesn't see the sun through the fluff.
Harry glances around him - the streets are empty, apart from this odd little girl who's watching Harry avidly, but he just ignores her. It'd be just his luck if she was a witch and started screeching about Harry Potter stealing from someone's garden - Rita Skeeter would have a field day.
"Ready to have the time of your life, mate?" Ron asks, grabbing onto Harry's elbow.
His head feels thick and heavy, so he lets it fall into the crook of Draco's neck, allows himself to lick and taste the salty skin there. The blond stretches, moaning obscenely, his hands clutching at Harry's clothed shoulder, hips thrusting erratically.
"Thanks, sir. Don't worry, you can go back to fucking your boyfriend. Alex and I are gonna do that for the first time on Christmas Day."
Anyway, Harry's gay, and he's just shit at talking to men in general, like flirting with them or anything. Sex, he can do just fine, in the dark of a hotel room, panting against another wanton body.
The world tilts on its axis as Draco mewls. It's like the shop is drifting off into space and Harry and the man in front of him are the only ones left in the universe. Harry's chest constricts as his breath hitches, and his whole fucking system is thrown out of whack.
Harry gets to the Apparition point, flicks his wand and spins on his heel. He lands in the back alleyway he usually does, and almost trips and falls flat on his face after a rat flies in front of him. Harry slides a hand over his face and huffs.
is prancing around in a
In Harry's opinion, concealer - such a mUgGLe invention - would've worked just as well.
"HARRY MOTHERFUCKING JAMES BLOODY POTTER! IF I DON'T SEE YOU OUT HERE IN THE NEXT MINUTE YOU MIGHT AS WELL WRITE YOUR WILL, BUILD YOUR OWN COFFIN AND CHOOSE YOUR GODDAMN FUNERAL SONG BECAUSE I WILL COME AND KILL YOU RIGHT WHERE YOU'RE STANDING!"
Long, slender fingers drag down the cotton of his light shirt, slow and beautifully firm until they reach the small of Harry's back. Draco's hot breath fans the back of his neck, and the Gryffindor shudders as goosebumps mark his flesh. The scent of chocolate and sweetened tea encase their bodies, so different from the almond and lavender of yesterday that Harry wonders if he's with the same Draco Malfoy.
At first, he doesn't see Harry because he's busy tousling his hair and adjusting the Muggle kimono he has on. It's a little slip-on thing made of silk in black with splashes of color in the form of birds are luminescent, glowing neon light in the dim room. When he finally catches sight of Harry, it's when he's right in front of him.
"You don't have a kink? Oh goody," the way the man just
Or where Draco Malfoy has fucking freckles and now Harry doesn't know what the fuck to do with his emotions - or his dick.
So, they bought a house a few weeks ago, and after dealing with all the packing and finalising that came with it, they're finally ready to start making it
"Relax, Potter." Malfoy throws an enigmatic smile over his shoulder at Harry. "I'll see you in Eighth Year."
Defeated, Harry
He can feel Malfoy smile against the skin of his neck. "Relax, Potter. I've never so much as set foot in this club before. I've only ever gone to a Muggle one three times before I quit."
, he concedes as his eyes rake over the other man,
That taut stomach pulses ever so slightly, before that blasted shirt falls down to cover the pale skin. "Harry, I thought we already went over this. My name is
swirling around them and fueling their desire.
Yet even when the door is closed, the girl is gone and the cold has left, Harry can't help but want to scowl at anyone who so much as breathes next to him. How dare that underaged
Well, one doesn't need to know such things lest they are scarred for life.
"So, what do you do for a living?" Harry asks Malfoy.
Because I'm a slut for Drarry smut <3
And - Harry doesn't know whether it was the flush high on Draco's cheeks, or if it was the way Draco knew the words
Ron pats Harry on the arm, shutting him up with a look that reads
Malfoy walks out from that room.
Harry suppresses a scowl as he eyes the limp waves, mouth twisting bitterly as he's reminded of Hermy's chestnut curls, bouncy and alive; practically breathing out character.
What was he supposed to say to that? Yes, Pansy, you will be the best girlfriend ever and I'm slightly jealous of Hermione because my last girlfriend was about two years ago and she's gone off to join some Quidditch team while I'm here slaving over Auror paperwork? Harry snorts quietly and sends a quick, reassuring smile down to Pansy.
It's not long Harry's known he's stupidly, absolutely, irrevocably gay. It was only when Ginny dumped him and told him he had things to work out that Harry started questioning his life.
"Do you think Hermione'll like chocolates?" Pansy's voice rings out clear and loud through Harry's thoughts and, with a jolt, he realises her gloved hand in the crook of his elbow has been dragging him towards a large shop front. There, sitting on a table decorated with different coloured fabric is a box of Charlie's Blooming Rose Chocolates™. The kind that blooms when given to someone you truly love. They seem nice enough, so Harry shrugs and nods.
What the fuck is happening.
It takes Harry a while to realise he's been absentmindedly shuffling back and forth in front of a few select shops. They're all a pasty pink, sort of, with white trims and various titles. Things like
the sign on the door reads - he'll have no more balls for Pansy to hex off.
He can see the headlines now;
"- so that's why we're dragging you to his shop. Like, right now."
"Sorry for the delay, how may I -" Malfoy turns around swiftly, so fast that Harry doesn't see it coming and when he does Harry wants to scream. Just for the heck of it. Those eyes are like moonlit pools of silver, wide and questioning. "Po-
Her incessant screeching is enough to send the shop streaking through the atmosphere and landing with a jarring bump back onto planet Earth. The world that consists of more people than just Malfoy and him sharing mewls and moans.
them and the feeling is immediate, violent and ripping screamed moans from deep within both their throats. Harry thrusts, clasps at Draco's shoulders, clasps at his long, messy hair that sometime during their exchange fell out of its ponytail. The feel of both their members sliding, slick and intense, makes that animalistic feeling swamp Harry again.
his mind supplies - and tucked into a corner so dark that Harry wonders if this is all part of Malfoy's plan to ruin Christmas for curious passers-by by scaring them like it's Hallowe'en. "Erm..." Harry coughs.
He's fucked. Well and truly doomed.
Harry almost chokes on his own saliva, his breath hitching as he quietly tries to gasp for air. Is he hallucinating? Dear God, dreams that he never knew he had ever dreamt are coming true.
This Malfoy offers tea, humps against Harry like there's no tomorrow, moans prettily and more importantly... this is the Malfoy that Harry wants to have. How the hell he knows this after two meetings, he doesn't know.
"Well, Harry..." Harry glances up from staring at his shoes - they're a nice shade of brown today - to glance at the blond. "It seems as though we've run out of boring shit to talk about. So, tell me -" The man bends, places his elbow on the pastel yellow counter, mercury eyes glittering "- what's your kink?"
“Oh, well… She… That is…” Harry was surprised that Lestrange actually seemed at a loss. Neither Malfoy nor Nott seemed to be gloating either.
“Once, I'd had a nightmare. The dementors had just been by, so I was... unsettled. I must have talked in my sleep,” Harry started with a lie because he couldn't explain the memories Albert had seen with the occlumency/legimency lessons. “I didn’t mean to tell him, but he s- heard some of it. He asked ...”
“You’re probably right that blood magic might be the key. You won’t find any useful books in the library though. Maybe in the restricted section, but not on the general shelves,” Nott said.
“Even if – even if you no longer have all of your soul, you’re still a better person than most of the people I know,” Draco added.
“...I can’t say,” Harry said awkwardly as he gave Parkinson and Zabini warry looks. He hoped his answer didn’t cause Draco to storm off in anger.
Once they were all on the boat, Hale started fusing with Harry’s outfit.
“It’s ok,” Wiblin said, which caused Harry to let out a harsh laugh. Wiblin paused briefly before trying again. He spoke softly as if he was trying to calm a wild beast. “I’m just going to see if he-” the man couldn’t finish his sentence as he looked at the body once more. Moving with obvious trepidation, Wiblin moved towards Burke while trying not to get too close to Harry. He searched for a pulse and closed his eyes when he felt it. Standing up quickly, Wiblin didn’t acknowledge Harry’s second flinch as he quickly strode back out of the cell and towards where his patronus was still guarding the hallway.
“They couldn’t interview us all at once after two aurors took you away. Gin’s interview had to wait until after ours, which meant McGonagall
“Thank you, Harry,” Albert said with sincerity. Harry nodded and slowly dimmed the light in Albert’s cell so everyone wouldn’t get another shock.
“They can only push this so far,” Hale assured him. “Madame Stokke actually suggested starting the trial without you. Not sure if that woman is on your side or not...”
“No,” Harry’s voice came out stronger but still wasn’t the yell he had intended it to be. He tried to grab his clothes, but Burke grabbed his wrist. He pinned Harry’s hand near his head so that the boy was unable to stop himself from being exposed.
“Stay out of this, Malfoy, unless you want a turn too. I can make a day of it. Nott, Potter, you,” he threatened and tightened his grip on Albert even more. “Anyone else? Crabbe? McNair?” Burke paused long enough to ensure no one else was talking back. “I thought not,” he sneered.
The aurors ushered Harry into a carriage once they got to the shore. It was a déjà vu of how Harry arrived at Azkaban, but at least this time he had Hale with him.
“Don’t worry too much,” Ron said. “You honestly didn’t miss that much.”
“When it suits their agenda, they don’t have a problem with it. But otherwise, no, they don’t normally allow it without causing trouble for the witch or wizard that supplied the memory… but we have a unique situation. The ministry has gotten so much bad press with your trial that I believe very few of them would want to risk dragging you in the mud again… of course, it’s still a risk. Runecraft will pick at your testimony regardless…” Hale mused.
“Reginald, please,” the man said.
“I created a spell,” he said.
“Perhaps we ought to go before the dementors get antsy,” suggested a third man who had been standing in the back. At the mention of dementors, the others started shifting.
“Oh my God!” Harry interrupted horrified. “Please tell me you’re not giving me
Harry wouldn’t say his stay in Azkaban was comfortable, but he grew accustomed to the easy comradery he had with his fellow prisoners. He even became desensitized to having dementors constantly stop by and observe him. By the time Harry was herded into the showers again, he wasn’t as reluctant to disrobe. It helped that Burke wasn’t leering at him.
“Yes, Mr. Shunpike’s case is a sad one. The evidence on him is circumstantial at best. Sadly, his judicial-wizard has not had much luck getting his sentence overturned,” Dumbledore said.
“You want a kiss, hmm?” Burke angrily asked. Harry was sure he was annoyed that Harry didn’t appear as rattled as he wanted. It probably didn’t help that Harry’s enemies were laughing with Harry at Burke’s expense rather than vice versa. “I could arrange to leave the door open, so you can greet the dementors properly yourself.”
“Alright then,” Mulciber issued a challenge. “You dazzle us with your witty repertoire. What’s your best insult?”
“You knew Goyle was polyjuiced as Wren?” asked Draco.
Once Harry had also gone through a review for defense against the dark arts and transfiguration, Albert pointedly cleared his throat. “Perhaps we can focus on more practical spells?” he said.
Harry had hoped to use the time Ron and Hermione were busy with prefect duties to work with Nott on the mirrors. That plan was disrupted when Ginny and Luna slid into Ron and Hermione’s vacated seats. He was somewhat mollified by their interruption when he caught Nott’s expression when Luna pulled out a quill that had one of her radish earrings attached to it.
“Know what?” Harry asked faintly. He grew apprehensive about whatever it was the two were alluding to.
Harry couldn’t help but laugh when he explained, “I was in the middle of all of them.” He detailed the cell arrangements and was amused by their horrified expressions.
“And...” Harry paused before the next example could spill out. Perhaps because he’d thought about the Dursleys, he almost mentioned Albert’s hatred for them too, but he caught himself in time. His reluctance to mention them wasn’t for Albert’s sake though. He knew he could find a way to justify any hatred the man had said about them, but it would cost Harry to do so. He thought it best to spare both of them the potential trouble. Unfortunately, some members of the wizengamot caught on that he’d almost said something of importance.
Lucius steered Harry back to the line up while Crabbe appeared and convinced Mulciber to get a shave after all.
When Mrs. Weasley insisted he bring Draco over for a family meal, Harry did not have the strength to deny her. Draco was understandably nervous but marched to the burrow with his head held high. It was painfully awkward. Mrs. Weasley did her best to welcome him, but Mr. Weasley kept glaring at ‘that Malfoy boy’. His sons were a little less hostile, but just as suspicious. Even Ron and Hermione, who had insisted they would be OK with it long before Harry knew it was even a possibility, had difficulty letting go of the past. They tried, but talking about quidditch turned tense. Hermione and Draco’s intellectual debates turned mean. Even Harry’s desperate attempt to talk about the ridiculous price of vegetables had somehow resulted in an exchange of glares. It would have been a complete disaster if not for James.
“I don’t understand… manage doing what exactly?” said Harry, his voice almost sounded as gravelly as the dementor’s.
“Just don’t practice on my wife,” said Lestrange as if Harry was going to take Nott’s advice.
Their next major focus was trying to determine if Albert had spoken against the ministry. Harry used to opportunity to remind them of their own failings by mentioning Albert hadn’t been happy to hear about Umbridge at Hogwarts. Scrimegeour, who’d been surprisingly quiet up until then, insisted that that was a failing of the previous minister. Given the direction Harry was willing to take this line of questioning, the wizengamot decided to drop it quickly.
“What an arse,” Ron said.
“Albert?” Hale questioned. “I wasn’t informed that he was hurt. What happened?” Hale asked the latter to one of the guards.
“After that, can you really blame Harry for thinking no guard would come to his aid?” Hale summed up.
“Dammit, Harry,” Draco swore, but he sounded more tired than upset. “Let me observe you for a couple of weeks. I can run a few tests, maybe find some more... evidence for you.”
I’ve mapped who is in the cells around Harry (see image at the end of this chapter). I might move them around if the story needs someone in a cell closer to Harry but for now this is what I’m picturing. If you’re wondering why some of them didn’t talk, I assume it’s because they were sleeping or something. They’ll have a presence later on.
“They’re definitely nervous,” remarked Mulciber gleefully. “Somebody is paying attention to Azkaban.”
“Harry,” Nott said slowly. He was picking his words carefully. “I’m due to see my judicial-wizard soon. It is the only way we have to get messages out into the world. I’d like your permission to tell him about the blood quill... and about the tattoo.”
“Yes,” Harry repeated.
“That’s too much,” fretted Crabbe quietly. Normally Harry would agree, but normally he couldn’t do wandless magic with nary a thought.
Harry felt he made good progress on the assignments, but he hadn’t finished them all. He knew even more were in store for him after tomorrow’s classes. He was irritated that the professors hadn’t spoken to each other about assigning a reasonable workload. If Harry had the luxury of sleeping, he didn’t know how he would have gotten through them all. He didn’t want to agree with Snape, but pre-Azkaban Harry would have been overwhelmed.
“Bold of you to assume you know what the dark lord wants,” Lucius interrupted.
The cell had enough space that Harry didn’t feel like the bed was right next to the toilet. He had been able to do a decent pacing session when he told Malfoy and Albert the story of how he got here. The bed wasn’t overly large but was made to fit a grown man. Unfortunately, sheets were about as thin as the uniform and likely wouldn’t do much against the cold. The mattress was too hard. Harry had grown used to Hogwarts’ mattresses for most of the year. However, his bed at the Dursleys was not that much different from the one in the cell. When the Dursleys had reluctantly moved Harry to Dudley’s second bedroom, they had needed to provide him a bed. Rather than buy him a new mattress, they had elected to buy Dudley a new bedroom set and gave Harry his old one, including the worn-out mattress.
“What did they do?” Malfoy asked, keeping his voice low and coaxing. To Harry’s horror, he felt tears welled up in his eyes.
“I have a suggestion for our heating problem,” offered Albert. “We can do a low-powered ward in each cell. If confined to the dimensions of the cell, the guards won’t notice when they pass by.”
“I’m trying to make sure they are both prepared,” insisted Lucius.
Even in the dim lighting of Azkaban, Harry noted the fear that flashed across Lucius’ face. It occurred to Harry that the man might not want his fellow death eaters to know about his involvement in the destruction of one of the horcruxes. Harry censored himself as he told the story of his second year. He vaguely mentioned that Ginny happened to have found the diary, and he skipped completely over how he managed to trick Lucius into freeing Dobby.
After that Harry strove to make James laugh frequently as he tried to see what Mr. Weasley saw. But he couldn’t. Harry concluded that, like with the faint freckles he thought he saw, Mr. Weasley was only seeing what he wanted to see.
“No, I can’t. You’ll hate me. Everyone will. I can’t ever tell anyone,” Harry despaired. His eyes watered and a few tears spilled out before he could stop them or turn away from Draco.
The dementors turned their attention back to Harry. “
“Excuse me?” Hale asked.
Harry trailed off. He knew if he said too much, he might start crying. He thought he had put Sirius’ death behind him, at least enough that he wouldn’t cry over it, but there was something about being in Azkaban that was tearing down his defenses.
No one spoke while the guards were still in the hallway. Burke made the “I’m watching you” hand gesture as he passed Harry’s cell. In return, Harry exaggerated his eyeroll and smirked when Burke frowned. He was glad the man was too busy watching Harry’s expression to notice that his hands were trembling.
Harry wanted to sink into the floor. As much as he liked the thought of getting to the point where he would need to know sex spells, Mulciber was right that Lucius was the last person Harry wanted to discuss this with. This was one subject he didn’t want his new mentors to teach him, even if all of them seemed to think he’d be able to convince Draco to be in a situation where they were necessary.
“How do you know about that?” asked Ron suspiciously. Harry’s eyes widened as it could only have been through Albert’s letter. Harry still hadn’t told Ron and Hermione about the letters since he would have to explain
“You’ll... help me?” Harry questioned. He didn’t doubt that James was his horcrux, but was surprised by Draco’s offer. He’d expected the other man to walk away in disgust. Instead he offered help. Unable to stop it, Harry burst into full-fledged drunken sobbing. Draco continued to run a soothing hand in his hair, or down his upper back while Harry cried himself to sleep.
“Er, I don’t think the ministry is ready for muggle thoughts on law and psychology,” Harry said honestly. “But Hale says that if you want it, you have a job with his firm when you graduate.”
“No,” Mrs. Weasley said firmly. “It’s no one’s fault... maybe the Death Eaters that cursed her while in that school, or maybe just the stress of the war... perhaps this would have happened even if she’d gotten pregnant years from now. We don’t know. But I do know it isn’t your fault. No more than it is Ginny’s.”
“Yes,” Mulciber acknowledged, “but without proof...”
“No one?” asked Hermione shrewdly.
“What are you talking about?” Parkinson asked with frustration.
“Well Burke and some other guards took him out of his cell and returned him bruised all over. Since no one can visit Azkaban, it leaves the guards as the only possible-” Harry said angrily.
“I’m sure my
Harry ran into Sprout before the end of lunch. He didn’t have her class that day, so she took the opportunity to check in with him then.
Hope y’all feel this was worth the wait. I had written half this chapter months ago, but then didn’t feel like writing for the longest time. I’m trying to get back into it as I want to finish this story.
“Harry,” Mrs. Malfoy spoke with obvious concern, but Harry had already turned away and rejoined Draco and the boys. He claimed not to be thirsty after all when Draco realized he came back without a glass of water.
The door led to a staircase going up. Harry followed Burke. They emerged from the staircase and Harry immediately noticed that the temperature was even colder in this area of the prison. At the end of a short hallway was yet another door. A man was sitting in a chair by the door. He looked up as the trio made their way over.
“Don’t worry, Potts. I’ll take care of those muggles for you,” Mulciber offered. Harry couldn’t see him, but he could picture the bloodthirsty look on his face. Despite the genuine offer of bodily harm, possibly even murder, Harry couldn’t help but smile in response. He’d missed the man. He missed all of them.
“Yes,” Harry said even before Draco could ask.
“What?” Lestrange asked. His tirade lost its steam at Harry’s angry admission.
“Never getting rid of you if you’re determined to stay,” Harry admitted. He watched his soul struggle to stay together. In some ways it was like their relationship. Harry clung to the most healthy thing in his life, determined to keep it together. It was a struggle only because he still didn’t feel worthy of it. And yet he was the luckiest asshole on the planet because Draco will wanted him despite everything. Some days Harry didn’t know what to do with that love; it always left him feeling breathless. As he’d done many times over the past few years, Harry vowed to be worthy of it.
But it wasn’t Burke at all.
“Yes, that incident has been examined already. It should have been struck from his record,” Dumbledore cut in and gave Harry a warning look. Harry knew he should remain quiet and let Dumbledore take care of this. It really was too bad Harry was never good at keeping his anger in check.
“Please tell me it’s the Appleby Arrows,” Nott stated. Harry turned his incredulous expression towards Nott feeling even more confused. He had just begun to think that Nott was alright, even if the man was a death eater. Harry couldn’t figure out why Nott was focused on quidditch instead of saying something supportive to his friend. Or even an acknowledgement that the situation sucked balls.
“Nonsense,” Draco replied, but he picked up James and gave him a hug. Draco continued to send worried looks towards Harry, but he wasn’t mad. Seeing the two of them together just made him want what he couldn’t have. It seemed he and James shared the same fantasy.
“I said I’d kill them,” Albert declared before Harry could respond. Harry looked at him in shock. Albert was watching him with concern.
“I miss him too,” Crabbe said as he stepped away from Harry.
“This really isn’t some elaborate trick,” Harry said tiredly.
“I know,” Harry said. There must have been something in his voice that revealed his own self-hatred, because both Ron and Hermione tensed. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Mr. and Mrs. Weasley pause and watch them. He let out a breath and tried to explain as levelly as he could.
“This isn’t over,” hissed Burke. He turned in the opposite direction and left abruptly.
“You’re absolutely gorgeous,” Draco said as leaned in for one last kiss. He knew they couldn’t linger much longer before they were missed, but he couldn’t resist.
“What?” asked every Slytherin except for Theo.
“Or, you’re not intelligent enough to grasp the brilliance of any verbal abuse I send your way,” came the haughty response from Lucius. Despite the words, Harry thought the two men were good naturedly teasing each other... mostly.
“Are you sure?” Lucius asked. “I don’t want to jeopardize your release if the guards find the letter,” Lucius provided Harry an easy way to decline, even though he clearly hoped Harry would be willing.
No matter what they said, it was an unintentional stab to the heart.
“Not related to eating souls,” responded Mulciber. He sounded amused.
“Then you’ve picked the wrong career, haven’t you?” pointed out Harry. Malfoy made another choking/snorting noise and Burke narrowed his eyes.
Albert started undressing as soon as the door closed behind the guard. Unlike Harry, Albert removed everything. He wasn’t concerned with his own nudity or who might see the photos. Harry, on the other hand, was keenly aware of the handful of men peaking in through the window and hated it.
“What are you doing?” Harry asked, suddenly worried for Albert. Burke snarled at Harry. It took him a moment to fully register Harry’s concern, but when he did, Burke relaxed enough to send a nasty smirk his way.
“Mum sets a pretty high precedent,” Draco joked. Harry didn’t quite relent, but he allowed himself to relax in Draco’s hold.
They didn't jump into teaching Harry spells like they had planned. Instead, Nott gave Harry an overview of what to expect during his first meeting with his judicial-wizard and what to say to the guards if they stalled and tried to deny him access to representation.
Malfoy grinds down and somehow forward at the same time, and Harry takes his head off of Malfoy's shoulder to watch the other man. He takes one hand away from his arse and presses gently on Malfoy's balls through his boxers. Malfoy makes the sweetest mewling sound, a high-pitched keen from the back of his throat, and Harry feels a rush of wetness against his stomach. Harry would be disappointed that they didn't last long, but Malfoy had said
The back of
Ron's glee is illuminated by the neon purple sign, the light shading his hair a maroon color that Harry sort of wishes he'd try. It looks good on him. Dean and Seamus have fucked off somewhere inside the club hours earlier, probably waiting for them at a procured table. Harry's excited, he really is, his hands are sort of shaking and he stuffs them into the pockets of his skinny jeans to hide the tremors. Ginny had dressed him, along with Parkinson of all people, and they'd shoved a transparent black shirt and a leather jacket at his face. Harry has to admit he looks good, especially with his curls ruffled artistically around his head and his glasses somewhere on his bedside table, leaving his vibrant eyes exposed to the world.
Is he comfortable? Yes. Does he want to kill himself at this present moment? Yes. Is he sporting a raging hard-on and is desperately trying to think of Molly Weasley naked to get rid of it promptly?
Wait, what? Harry turns sharply to face Ron, ripping his arm away from Lavender's leering touch - the girl was far too soft, all skin and fat with curves galore - she reminds Harry of a leech; of a very special redhead with crimson lips and a pretty smile. Of Ginevra Weasley.
Draco huffs, and Harry realises the man is silently crying. Harry is shocked, sort of. It's supposed to be
"Not much, a few sickles should do it." The pair traverse to a rather antique, vintage looking cash register that sits on a lonely little table just in front of those flower pots Harry remembers from last week.
Maybe getting out of bed today wasn't as much of a mistake he thought it to be.
Draco's eyelids flutter open - Harry's unsure of when they closed in the first place - and the frail pink of his cupid's bow quivers slightly. There, Harry fucking knows he's messed up whatever slight chance he had before to claim this man as his. He's probably messed up the one good thing in his life. Harry backs off, ignores the way his dick dribbles more precome in longing for his dragon and looks away from the Slytherin.
Malfoy waves a pale hand, Harry can't help but track it with his eyes, before he turns around and starts walking.
- and Harry almost chokes as the git begins to stretch out languidly in front of him. Today, Malfoy looks nothing less than beautiful, dressed in a plain white shirt, the pretty brown chinos and a lilac coloured translucent kimono. "Did you miss me?"
He feels 12 years old again, and his heart is beating erratically - which simply won't do - sending blood rushing to Harry's ears and the palms of his hands sweat inside of his gloves.
"Malfoy. Er, I was just...taking samples of your flowers, yes. To...analyse."
Draco
- and when he looks up the blond has his head thrown back against the fridge, one hand already brushing over the hard bud of his nipples. This Draco, so different from the Malfoy Harry remembered, is the Draco that the Gryffindor wants to claim, wants to moan into his ear as they both slip and slide against each other.
Harry did
There's nothing in the room apart from a plush armchair and a table filled with various cocktails and mojitos. The walls are a trendy black wood with large shapes cut into it, different colored light illuminating from the different shapes.
Harry wants to argue, but all he can think about is how fucking amazing Malfoy looks when he's exasperated. And his
Harry wonders why no one bothered to tell him the git was back from his 2 year trip to Paris, or why the
They spend a few minutes in terse silence, and on the outside, Harry looks fucking calm and collected like nobody's business. His hair is a mess, but that's a give, and he's sweating through his band t-shirt. ACDC cannot help him now.
He wonders as Draco drags him through to the back room - something Harry didn't even know existed - if the man will let him.
For a moment, Malfoy sits there, rigid and stiff, but Harry grabs a fistful of hair and pulls. Then the blonde relaxes, somewhat, enough for Harry to grab his kiss quickly before Malfoy rips his lips away and getting up in one fluid movement. Harry doesn't say anything as Malfoy fixes his hair and puts on the kimono, but he gets to his feet as Malfoy opens the door to leave.
Despite his obvious lack of eloquence, Draco seems to understand Harry as a long, pointed tongue licks and draws over the spot where Harry's neck meets his shoulder, those little teeth nibbling excellently.
Draco's observing him, he can feel it, and Harry almost lets his mouth open up to say things when the blond walks up to him and stands so close that his chest almost brushes up against Harry's arm. He smiles delicately and moves in once he notices Harry isn't ripping him into shreds just for being in his personal bubble. Dammit, why isn't Harry doing that? That would be the most logical course of action.
Harry doesn't understand why his heart soars at that. "I can't really do much." He pushes his hips up to rub his covered length over Malfoy's arse to illustrate his point.
Harry wants to cry - he really does - when he extracts himself hastily from Draco and notices the young girl standing just inside the glass door to the shop. Oh brilliant, not only did this 15-year-old looking kid catch Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy humping like wild geese horny for some action, but the whole of the Wizarding World most likely saw their desperate display.
Maybe Harry wants Malfoy to bite.
"Mrs. Potter, what a pleasure it is to finally meet you. I hope you enjoy
And with that Harry's slamming the door behind him and sprinting towards a rather angry looking Pansy Parkinson.
Merlin, it's like the gods themselves have given Harry a gift so beautiful he can't help but drop to his knees and admire the milky expanse of skin that is his ex-arch-nemesis' slender legs and cock. Harry lets his large hands roam over the pale skin, and in the low lighting of the back room, Draco looks stupidly amazing like this.
Harry sort of wishes he could do more than stare at the blonde, but it's hard focusing on anything when those pink lips are so close to his face. Before he can embarrass himself by reaching up and tracing the outline of them, Malfoy steps back. Only to drop his kimono in one graceful movement. Harry almost self-combusts.
Kreacher comes into the kitchen and tries to make him breakfast. Harry says nothing, but he doesn't eat it, he just drinks his black coffee and throws on a jacket and a pair of vans. He leaves Grimmauld Place, burnt breakfast still on the table.
And then he loses the ability to say anything at all when Malfoy turns around and shows off his arse clad in the silky green boxers he's wearing. Shooting a smile at Harry over his shoulder, Mafloy starts twisting his hips, and music starts slowly from somewhere behind Harry. It's a Muggle song - and Malfoy dances beautifully to it. Long, lean limbs twine sinuously over his body, and Harry watches with avid eyes, only half-ashamed when he blooms to full hardness in his tight jeans. Malfoy walks backward until the back of his knees hit Harry's, and then Harry can't help himself.
Harry considers obeying - it
But he wants him, wants the pretty smiles, wants the feelings and happiness, wants the sex and lust...
There's a daisy tucked in behind Draco's left ear, as well as a strand that's happened to come loose.
Shit. He's fucked. Totally and utterly doomed.
So he gets up and immediately falls back down again onto his bed. He hates these days; the days where he just knows he'll spend half of it bawling into his jacket sleeve.
Malfoy's head snaps up from the small book in his hands, and Harry lets his eyes roam over those bony fingers, long and grasping withered pages of what Harry now assumes is a sketchpad. The shorter man smiles slightly, and Harry almost subconsciously follows the movement with every rise and fall of his heart.
but - something deep inside him just snaps.
like -84750° Celsius outside. Not exactly prime flowering weather.
Harry doesn't know what possesses him, but he just gives Malfoy a strained smile and nods. Oh God, was has he done?
Malfoy shrugs. "My Father wanted it - therefore I did not."
Something's wrong with this, Harry is sure of it, but he just can't figure out what. He's sure, at this point, that Godric Gryffindor has most definitely come to earth, and the Armeggedon has most certainly begun because this whole
His thoughts ring hollow in his ears, and Harry turns his attention to Malfoy. It takes him a bit to realise that Malfoy isn't doing much of anything a few moments after Harry has allowed Lavender to practically chuck him in in such an undignified manner, instead the blond is perched delicately on a wooden bench in the corner of the shop.
"I'm sure you'll be considered amazing, Parkinson." And apparently, that's all the encouragement that the shorter woman needs, as she kisses him on the cheek and disappears into the shop with a breezy "thanks, darling, stay here or I'll hex your balls off."
Listen.
Actually, now that Harry thinks about it, perhaps that was for the best.
I'm so sorry it's taken me this long to post the rest of the chapters, but thanks to all those that read Flower Shop Boy! Its means so much <3
Harry blinks again. "Sorry, what?"
"Yes, as much as I hate to admit it, you are quite renowned for your discoveries. One would not have thought it with your N.E.W.T grades in Potions." Malfoy says, and the smile is gone from his face when he looks back at Harry.
a hero, after all, and no matter who the civilian - or ex-Death Eater - if he, the hero of the Wizarding World, is to drip on someone's dignified floor, then he, Harry Potter, has a duty to be worried about rotting the wood.
“I have requested to have an extra day off from teaching this weekend for us to spend together, so today will be the last day this week that I have to teach. Tomorrow we will go get some toys and books, and I will take you to go meet my friends. They have been very close for a long time, and I hope that you will develop a friendship with them like I have.” Harry nodded his head over his bowl of oatmeal and side of bacon, the oatmeal sweet and creamy and with some sort of fruit in it. “I would also like to have Madam Pomfrey to check your eyesight and see if there are any lingering issues that need healing.” Harry wasn't sure what to say to this, so he nodded and continued to eat. He didn't like thinking about his relatives or what happened.
Draco pressed one chase kiss to Harry’s lips before he returned to his earlier position laying with his head against Harry’s chest. He made a point to grab Harry’s ring hand and hold it tightly.
Malfoy looked shocked. Harry didn’t know if it was because Harry was being arrested or because he hadn’t thought Harry would cast any unforgivables. With more than a little bitterness, Harry wondered how many of the slytherins in Malfoys little group had cast unforgivables. None of them were being arrested for it.
Harry’s poor mood grew worse as Snape peppered his lecture with snide comments aimed at or about Harry.
When Harry hesitated at telling anyone other than Crabbe, Theo turned his impatient stare on Harry. “I trust them, too,” he said.
This time when Draco leaned in for a kiss, Harry did not pull away. Being able to kiss Draco was even better than he imagined, even if he was wracked with nerves. He was excited, oh so excited, to be so close to him. But part of him was terrified. He hadn’t been this close to anyone in a long time. To be honest, he hadn’t had all that much opportunity to be close to even Ginny. It was new territory and he was eager to explore it. He knew how it could all go horribly wrong, but he wasn’t going to pull away again. This time when Draco’s hand teased the hem of his shirt, he pressed forward.
“Careful not to smudge that with lube later tonight,” Mulciber said to break the tension. The two men snarked at each other, but it held no real heat.
“And is Professor McGonagall aware of this appointment?” asked Snape.
Hale’s eyebrows shot up as Harry discreetly passed over the letter.
“One moment,” Dumbledore cut it. “Perhaps Harry has something to contribute to this conversation.”
“Oh! Yes please,” Crabbe said. A second later he was holding out his toilet paper roll between the bars of his cell. The other men seemed equally as eager at that suggestion. Harry dutifully softened the toilet paper to each man’s preference.
Having delivered the letters, Harry awkwardly stood by their table. Harry wanted to say something else, something meaningful, to Draco but didn’t know what. He wondered if Draco wanted to say something in return given he kept glancing from his letter to Harry and back again. Harry tracked the movement of Draco biting his lip nervously.
I survive, I’ll come back for it... but if I don’t... if I don’t, you can still...” and Harry found he couldn’t say it.
“At least this does answer our question,” Draco said softly.
He was partly right.
Harry blushed. “Just something my cousin says,” he mumbled.
“What’s that?” asked Lucius.
“Entitled little shit,” Burke hissed then backhanded Harry across the face. Harry cried out in shock. While he was dazed, Burke grabbed his other hand and similarly trapped it between their bodies.
“You’re a good person,” Draco insisted. When Harry scoffed in response, he pressed on. “I see how much you regret it and how much it hurts you still. I understand why you thought you had to do it.”
Figuring the best place to start was at the beginning, the others told Harry of the chaos in the great hall right after the aurors had taken Harry away.
Harry snorted as he imagined the organized and colour-coded assignments that were waiting for him. Normally it would be an unhappy thought, but now he was curious to see how close the Death Eaters had gotten to the sixth-year curriculum.
The rest of the evening was spent talking about inane topics. Some of the Death Eaters spoke about the jobs they had prior to their arrest. They had asked him what profession he planned to pursue, but Harry he hadn’t thought of a backup plan since realizing that being an auror was no longer feasible. Lucius observed that Harry had enough money that he probably didn’t need to work if he didn’t want to. Both Lucius and Nott were independently wealthy, so they had spent their time schmoozing people in power in order to influence them. They found it to be quite satisfactory.
“Well not
“Watch your head,” advised Perkins. He placed his hand on Harry’s head and he guided him into the closest carriage. The two aurors then joined him in the carriage. As soon as the door closed behind the second auror, the carriage started to move. Harry’s hopes of having one of the professors stop them were completely dashed.
“Most of the guards aren’t hired for their intellect,” added Mulciber. Lucius and Harry supported Albert’s weight while Mulciber bent down to help pull up his pants. Mulciber didn’t complain even though it put him awfully close to Albert’s junk. “If they come relatively cheap and are able to keep secrets, then they’re hired. There are some exceptions. Believe it or not, Burke isn’t usually this much of a moron.”
stood out clearly for him, but it would be hard for Nott to see from his cell.
need to talk,” Harry insisted. Snape turned to appeal to the headmaster.
“It’s fine,” Harry grumbled. He would do the work, but was annoyed by Snape’s hypocrisy.
“Isn’t that your judicial-wizard?” asked Hermione and gestured to where the man had stopped to talk to a younger Slytherin.
“I could-” Harry once again stalled on what he could offer. Draco let out a strained laugh and Harry cringed in response.
As they moved past the main doors, Harry noted that no other guard was stationed there. He assumed the second guard with them was supposed to be at that post, but as Burke led him down the stairs, the guard followed.
Harry thought his new favourite sounds were the ones Draco made when Harry kissed his neck, caressed his back, tugged at nipple – really any sound the man made as Harry discovered each unique detail of his body. And Harry explored it thoroughly. Mostly with his mouth. He found Draco did not have any more experience than he did, so they spent their time learning how to move together, and figuring out what felt good for the other. Draco called him a generous lover, but Harry knew he was really greedy as lived for pulling out all the appreciative sounds and compliments he could from Draco.
“And you want to use it on me and James?” Harry guessed.
“Harry,” a witch Harry didn’t recognize spoke in a gentle tone, “you don’t have to be family for someone to care. If you would have come to the ministry, we would have made sure you weren’t kept in that unsafe environment.”
Hale started the questioning by walking Harry through the events of the night Albert was arrested. Hale glossed over a few things Harry had mentioned during their private meetings, so Harry tried to follow his lead as best as he could and kept details to minimum. If McGonagall made a big deal about it later, Harry could claim he'd been worried about getting himself or his friends in trouble. What would be harder to explain were Harry’s memories of that night previously submitted into the trial.
“That’s awful,” Hermione said.
“Why would he?” countered Hale. “He’s a sixteen-year-old that was recently attacked in the worst way and you expect him to readily share this traumatic experience with whoever wants to see it? Especially with the people he’s the least likely to trust? The very same people who have
This fear meant Draco had to do very little to convince Harry to attend family dinners with the Malfoys once Lucius felt well enough for company. The first few were as awkward as Harry expected. Neither he nor Lucius contributed much to the conversation. Luckily Narcissa, Draco and James kept the chatter going.
By the time they were led back to their cells, Harry was a nervous wreck. He paced in the limited space of his cell. The other prisoners tried to offer encouragement, but Harry was too anxious to do more than listen attentively for the guards to open door again. He didn’t know how much time had passed, but eventually he heard the door open and a guard announce that Harry’s judicial-wizard was here to see him. If possible, Harry grew even more nervous, but that could be because it was Wiblin that ordered him to face the wall and put his hands behind his back. Harry could only hope it went better than the last time this happened.
“No, I...” Harry stopped at the unimpressed look on her face.
“It wasn’t
“I mailed him last night. Maybe he came to answer in person?” Harry wondered aloud. Hermione asked him what he’d mailed about, but Harry had already moved away and towards Hale.
“I’m sorry too,” Harry said. “Not for freeing Dobby exactly, because he’s happier now... but I had a certain view of you and never let myself see anything beyond that.”
“Yes... Well sort of? I wrote in the diary and it responded. Even showed me a memory. The locket influenced our emotions. Towards the end it showed Ron... well, it was something Ron feared might happen, so it was able to pick up on our thoughts. It also tried to drown me,” Harry recounted.
“As much as I enjoy your company, Professor, I’m here today for Mr. Potter,” said Hale easily.
Having a young child to care for did put a damper on their raging hormones. Most days they aimed for quickies or desperately waited for James’ nap time. Harry found himself taking advantage of any offer to babysit someone gave him. Andromeda always gave them a knowing smirk when they dropped off James at her house. Narcissa was more subtle, but Harry detected a twinkle in her eye whenever she bid them farewell with a parting “have fun”. Mrs. Weasley always gave him a genuinely happy smile, as she would never turn away from an opportunity to spend time with her grandson. Harry was always reluctant to ask her when the reason was so that he could go on a date. Ginny’s death still occupied the space between them, and it felt wrong to be so demonstrative in how he’d moved on to someone else.
“Oh, I’m sure you must have admirers outside of this place,” Albert misdirected. He said it innocently enough but could not contain his smirk.
The same rule did not apply to Voldemort. Harry didn’t blame them for being curious about his memories of Voldemort even though he hated reliving them. What did surprise him was when neither commented on Tom Riddle’s parentage. Lucius had only remarked on Voldemort’s lost charisma, while Albert revealed he’d gone to school with him. It seemed some death eaters were already privy to the knowledge that Voldemort was a halfblood, but it was kept hush-hush in favor of promoting pureblood propaganda.
“I’ve been trying to figure it out all year,” Harry admitted. He watched Malfoy’s face and was surprised by the amount of pain he was displaying. Harry recalled how he used to think of Malfoy as cold and was surprised how quickly his opinion had changed. Dumbledore had mentioned something about Malfoy likely seeing Azkaban as safe compared to Voldemort’s wrath, but Harry didn’t think the man was actually that selfish. He genuinely seemed pained at the thought of his son having been set a task. Besides, it was becoming clear to Harry that Azkaban was hardly a safe haven.
Dumbledore and Runecraft were heatedly talking. Dumbledore was trying to converse quietly but the student body was so completely focused on the whole scene that his and Runecraft’s voices still carried across the hall.
“Albert? Is Harry Potter really in front of us or have the hallucinations finally started?” asked Lucius Malfoy.
“I’m not conjuring lube for you every time you’re feeling randy,” Harry insisted. He turned to Lucius and asked, “how do I cast a semi-permanent transfiguration?”
“It’s what I do,” responded Hale.
“Well, I didn’t know you then... although, I always knew you were smart. And if pressed, I may have admitted I found you somewhat attractive,” Harry said.
the significance of stag?" asked Albert.
“It was brave of you to do what was right even when forced into a terrible situation,” Dumbledore eventually stated. Harry snorted.
“Of course,” answered John and he started ordering the other men to their stations on the boat. As far as Harry could tell, John was the captain. He used his wand to steer to the boat. The second man’s job was to casts a patronus to ensure the dementors did not attack the ship. Harry still hasn’t learnt the man’s name but his patronus was some sort of bear. The third man, whom the aurors referred to as Burke, seemed to be stationed as a third guard in case prisoners attempted to escape. Harry supposed he could also provided a second patronus if need be, but the man was watching Harry so intently that he probably wouldn’t notice if any dementors got close enough for a kiss.
“Are you releasing the boy?” asked Malfoy.
Burke took a moment to admire his work before he moved his wand back to Harry’s neck. The sharp pain returned.
“Potter, you can tell us or I can go in there and ask Draco myself,” Parkinson said firmly.
As Burke opened the door labelled ‘Block D’, Perkins spoke for the first time since entering the prison section. “Surely, Mr. Potter isn’t a high-risk prisoner!” he objected.
“I considered bringing that wretched plant to decorate your cell,” hissed Burke. Harry had to wonder why the man hadn’t followed through with that. It would have made the entire hall of convicts miserable. Of course, it likely would have negatively impacted the guards as well.
I think this is the most dialogue heavy chapter of this story so far!
“That... was both wandless and silent casting,” Lucius observed in wonder.
There were so many things wrong with that statement that Harry struggled to pick something to address first.
“Impressive,” muttered Lestrange. Harry was thinking of it as scary since it was unintentional.
“Intended? Did he not...”
Harry breathed a sigh of relief. “How long – I mean, when would I meet with him?”
“A trim won’t actually make it any more manageable,” Harry responded in a distracted manner. He slowly turned towards Draco, unaware of how close the other man was. “No matter what I do, it’s always-”
“Probably should have warned you,” Harry said with a smile.
The next several days were blissfully Burke-free. It was possible that the man had previously scheduled these days off, but the prisoners all assumed it was because of Albert’s gift. Harry smiled whenever he pictured Burke opening the package and getting dosed by an aggravated plant.
“I know you’re the one that sent me that, that, skunk plant!” Burke hissed.
“Lube!” said Mulciber.
doing anything. Except arresting innocent people like Stan Shunpike. How does that help anyone?” Harry asked annoyed. “Scrimgeour isn’t any better than Fudge,” he added bitterly.
“And you think you’re somehow failing?” Draco asked. He sounded genuinely curious, and without any of the maliciousness he would have expected from Malfoy before the war. His words also lacked any trace of facetiousness, which was the general attitude others expressed when they thought Harry was blaming himself for Ginny’s death once again.
Draco watched him with a strange look on his face. He opened his mouth to say something but quickly snapped it shut again. He watched Harry fidget.
“How do they eat then?” Harry asked as he was temporarily sidetracked.
“I keep looking for some sign of Ginny. Anything to say he’s her son, but all I see is
“I just applied what everyone taught me,” Harry said humbly.
“What I should have done the moment you arrived,” Burke hissed back. “If I had put you in your place right away, you wouldn’t have caused so much trouble for me,” as Burke spoke, he leaned more and more into Harry’s space. His hold on Harry’s hair was unforgiving and he strained Harry’s neck in an uncomfortable way.
“Anyone want anything besides lube?” Harry asked even though he cringed at the possibilities.
Harry didn’t explain that he’d initially projected the Dursleys on to his interpretation of the Malfoys. While there were similarities, Harry knew they were not the same. Suggesting they were, especially after Lucius had seen some of Harry’s memories of them, would be a huge insult. If Harry had any lingering doubts about the similarities between the two, it was squashed by Lucius’ reactions to the memories he saw.
“I have one at home, a different one. He's not as fast as this one, but he does the same thing. He plays with my cat too.” Harry was starting to relax. Draco seemed very interested in him, and he didn't seem to mind that Harry didn't talk much.
Severus set the book down on the couch next to Harry and stood up.
Once he was sure that Remus had left, Severus cast a silencing charm to make sure that they wouldn’t be overheard. Harry shivered a little and the little snake hissed, making Severus eye her warily. Shadow had not come out of Harry’s room, and Severus wondered how the cat would react to Harry’s new friend.
“I would be more than happy to. Harry, please come in.” Remus opened the door wider, and Harry stepped in, followed by the cat. Severus lingered for a moment.
“The headmaster, who you have not met, has decided that you need a connection to your parents. One of your parent’s closest friends, Remus Lupin, has come to be a teaching assistant to one of the other professors. The headmaster would like you to spend one day a week with Mr. Lupin learning more about the Wizarding World from his point of view and to learn more about your parents. Do you think that you would be okay with that?” Harry blinked at Severus a couple of times, registering the look on Severus’s face and how tense he was while he was talking about this.
“No… I mean, it does have to do with Harry, but not just that. It’s a lot.” Severus gestured towards one of the chairs next to the fireplace and Remus nodded, sitting down in the chair on the other side of the hearth.
“There were rumours that he had, but no legitimate stories or anything for definite.” Draco looked disappointed. Narcissa turned back to the board. “Moving on then. Magic, and the different forms that magic can take...” Narcissa started describing the different forms of magic, and demonstrated them with her wand.
Despite his outward reaction to Albus’ request for him to check on Harry, Severus desperately wanted to protect on the child of his best friend. Unbeknownst to Albus or James Potter, Severus and Lily had mended fences and had quietly been in communication up until she had been killed. Severus hadn’t been willing to put her in danger, and after she had been killed he felt the same way about her son which was the only reason that he had accepted Albus sending Harry to live with Pentunia. Seeing him now, sleeping out in the October cold, bruised and covered in urine, he felt an anger that he didn’t think was possible. He knew that he had to remove the child from here immediately for his own safety.
“Remus will be separated from the student body on the nights of the full moon, and you will be brewing him the Wolfsbane potion each month, of course.” Severus’s eyes narrowed and his voice grew cold and heavily laced with sarcasm.
Severus and Remus turned at the same time to see Shadow poke his head in and then trot towards Harry’s room, tail held high. The door opened a little further, and Harry walked in carrying what looked to be a large egg in a basket. Severus inhaled deeply and Remus got the impression that he was about to blast Harry with his temper, when Harry hissed something. Hissed in a way that a normal human shouldn’t have been able to. Both Severus and Remus dropped into their respective chairs, all the wind knocked out of them when they realized what they had heard.
There was a knock on his door. Surprised, Remus set his tea down and went to open the door. He was even more surprised to find Severus standing there with a serious, but not malicious look on his face.
“Did you see, Father? Did you see the bubbles?” Severus nodded.
“Nice to meet you too, sir.” Lucius turned to look at Severus, who stood in the doorway.
“Salazar, this is my son, Harry. He is going to be staying in my quarters from now on. “ The painting nodded, and then the painting swung open from the side as if it was a door. Behind the door was a living room tastefully decorated in earth tones, rich shades of dark brown and dark wood with touches of cream detail. There was a sofa with dark wood and cream fabric, and two wing backed chairs stood side by side with a table of dark wood between them.  Across from the sofa was a large fireplace, lit already to ward off the chill from the stone walls. There were four doors spread out around the room, and Severus walked to each of them to show Harry his new home.
Severus explains everything to Lucius and Narcissa, and makes the tough choice to loop in their new ally.
The next morning, Harry was up and active and didn't seem to have any memory of the previous evening. The two of them had breakfast together, and then Severus took Harry into his lab to show him an easy potion that he had once made when he first learned how to make potions. The brightly colored rainbow that flashed in the cauldron as the potion was finished delighted Harry, and Severus showed him how stirring in different ways changed the color of the potion. Severus was very proud of how exacting Harry was in counting out ingredients, and while they were making the potion Severus would give Harry little tips in potion making.
As Severus watched, Harry started to calm and stopped shrieking. The mark on his head stopped being angry and red, and closed to look like it normally did. After what seemed like an eternity, Harry started to breathe normally again, and turned over with a sigh to fall into restful sleep.  Severus retreated to his room to process what he had just seen, leaving Shadow as a silent sentinel next to Harry's pillow.
**********
“He can also sense minor magic, like healing charms.” Lucius nodded and made an acknowledging noise, even though Narcissa knew he hadn't heard a word she had said.
It was the last day of classes, and all of the children were snug in their beds and ready to leave the following day for their holiday break. Christmas was in two days, and Severus had just fallen asleep after completing his scoring of the last midterm. Harry had been asleep  for hours until he was woken by a cat paw on his face.
“Is it bad? Azkaban, I mean. I know people say it is, but is it... as bad as they say?” Draco asked.
Poor Pansy. Since I’m denying the Harry of this universe the opportunity to experience the absolute gold that is the whole Roonil scene with Snape, he got to have his snarky moment at Pansy’s expense. ‘I know who Theo is’ was kind of close, ehehehe.
Harry’s testimony was hindered by not knowing who each Death Eater was. Hale described their masks, but a good chunk of that night happened so fast that Harry couldn’t be sure which Death Eater had said or done something in particular. He was able to confirm a couple of events that Albert had described, but Hale didn’t look as pleased as he’d been when Harry confidently spoke about Lucius.
When he finished his tale, he paused, standing in the middle of his cell and panting slightly. He watched the only two people he could see clearly. Both Malfoy and the man he called Albert looked noticeably shocked.
“Of course it hurts,” despite his words, Lestrange’s tone wasn’t harsh. “Nails are bloody detaching and reattaching themselves.”
“What do you mean?” Harry asked. He brought his own empty tray to the slot in his cell. Glancing at Malfoy for confirmation, Harry then tapped the bar and watched his tray disappear.
“What’s the matter, Potter?” Wiblin asked. “You can cast a torture curse, but can’t take a little tattoo?” The guard moved behind Harry’s chair and pressed down on his shoulders. It didn’t hold Harry any more in place than the chair already managed, but Harry did feel more trapped.
“Oh. You seemed confused,” Harry responded smartly.
“Seriously?” asked Theo.
“I won’t risk it, not if it’s you. If you want more children, I’ll carry them,” Harry offered. The thought of being pregnant absolutely terrified him in so many ways, but he’d do it for Draco.
“My point is, you didn’t see it, so you don’t know what really happened,” insisted Runecraft.
“You’re young. James is your first child, and you never had younger siblings to care for. You’re doing it mostly on your own, which would be stressful for anyone even before you factor in whatever misplaced guilt you feel about Ginny’s death,” Draco listed. Harry mentally reminded himself it wasn’t misplaced guilt, but didn’t interrupt Draco. He wanted to know how his and James’ relationship looked like from an outside perspective. “All his basic needs are taken care of. He’s not starved for attention or physical comfort...”
Ron, Hermione, and Neville left with him. Harry tried to ignore everyone’s curious eyes following him, even as he sought out one particular set of grey eyes. Like most of the hall, Draco was already looking at him. Harry didn’t know what to make of the look on his face. It wasn’t the sneer he usually had directed at Harry, but it wasn’t exactly warm either. Their eyes met, and Harry was tempted to deviate from his course and go talk to him. He had initially thought he could casually drop off the letters on his way out, but he’d forgotten how gossipy the students were. Harry didn’t need everyone wondering what he gave Draco and the others, or worse discovering the letters. As tempting as it was to run straight for Draco as soon as he spotted him, Harry knew he’d have to wait until he could get the other boy alone. Not that he had any idea how he’d convince any of the Slytherins to meet him. With a sigh, Harry turned away from Draco and followed Hermione out of the hall.
“Reginald...” Harry hedged.
“Wot?” asked Ron from behind Hermione.
By the time Harry and Hale said their goodbyes and Harry returned to the school, Draco and Nott had left.
Harry snorted, “yeah, I didn’t miss that bit.”
“Ok... ok, but don’t get mad. I was doing some research, and, well Harry, mind healers can help you after what you’ve been through. It’s not a weakness to see one. Oh Harry, after everything-” Hermione pleaded earnestly.
“That happens. Everyone says I look like my father,” Draco pointed out.
“Draco,” Harry interrupted. “I’ll follow you wherever.”
“Fine,” Harry said as neutrally as he could given Snape was trying to get him in trouble.
Harry looked at Draco desperately because Draco knew it
“I don’t want to die, Gin. I really don’t,” he reassured her. He briefly caught her eye and was touched at the love and concern that was there. Not that he deserved it after what he’d done, but Harry was greedy and needy enough to accept it. “But he’s killed so many already. He won’t stop until I’m dead too. I’ve accepted the very real possibility I could die... so I... I...” Harry floundered and looked at the ring helplessly.
was a Death Eater just to spite you,” Madame Bones said as she took over the questioning. Despite Harry preference for Madame Bones, he was nervous by this turn of events. He would not be able to pretend she was twisting his words around should McGonagall ask later. Harry was willing to expressly state Albert had his full support; he just dreaded having to explain it to his professors who were already keeping too close of an eye on him.
“Quite. I was hoping that you would be up to having us for introductions and lunch.” Narcissa smiled, delighted that her introductions would not be further postponed.
“Keep a civil tongue in your head, Rowle, or you will lose it. That's my son.” Severus said quietly. He had learned long ago that if he spoke quietly, it made people listen harder and for some reason made them much more afraid of him.
“You can call me Remus, if you want.” Harry nodded, and went to gather Nala. Severus and Harry left, Shadow making cat comments as he followed them out. Remus moved his chairs back to the way they had been before, and sat down. The feeling of cheer lingered in the air, along with the smell of Harry. It had been the best Christmas Remus had in a long time.
Maybe it was good that Harry was going to be taken care of by Uncle Severus. Uncle Severus was the smartest and scariest Slytherin other than his father. He would make sure that no one was mean to Harry, and that no one scared him. Maybe...
(See the end of the chapter for
“I... Harry, wandless magic magic is very advanced, and very difficult. It takes a very powerful person to be able to do even a little, and it takes many years to learn. Are you sure that you want to try to learn?” Harry nodded, a determined look at odds with his youthful face. Lucius knew that he was going to have to talk to Severus about the conversations today. He decided that he was going to try a little test.
“I talked to Draco's dad about the bad man, and that I promised to protect you because you are protecting me and we are family.” Severus had been taking a drink of water, and inhaled sharply at Harry's offhand comment about the 'bad man'. Severus coughed to clear his throat for a moment before responding.
“See, we both have good taste in toys! I knew we would be friends!” Harry smiled at Draco. He guessed his father had been right; Draco really was nice. “I got you something, as a welcome to the family gift. I mean, you have always been part of the family, but now you are back.” Draco held his hand out, and on his palm was a little dragon. It was  a figurine like Smoke, but with a slender, pale green, snake-like body and a frill around it's neck.
“Harry, I need to go to my lab for a little while. Would you be okay spending time with Remus? I don’t think that he has anyone else to spend Christmas with, and I know he would like to see you.” Harry studied Severus’s face for a moment.
Harry pulled his blanket out from under the stairs and began wiping the floor, careful to not bump the side table and moving slowly due to the pain in his side from where his uncle kicked him. His uncle watched with narrowed eyes and after a couple of moments decided that Harry wasn’t moving fast enough for him.
**********
Severus explained to Remus that part of taking care of Harry was letting Severus research more in depth the Wolfsbane Potion that he would be making. This meant that Severus would be checking in with Remus before and after the full moon, and possibly making adjustments. Remus was skeptical, but willing to do anything for Harry. Remus found that Harry seemed to be the pivot point of their tentative peace. That, and how royally pissed at Albus they both were. Remus was aghast at how Albus was willing to manipulate and sacrifice Harry, and Remus assured Severus that any loyalty that he had for Albus Dumbledore had been quickly transferred to Harry once he had a better idea of what was going on.
“Yes it is.” They both went back to eating. After dinner, it didn't take Harry long before he was ready to sleep. He had a busy and exciting day, and was nodding off before Severus was done with the first page of their nightly book. Severus left Shadow purring against Harry's back and called Tippy to keep an ear out for Harry before calling through the Floo to the Malfoy's.
“My… feelings about Remus are complicated. We went to school together, and didn’t get along very well. One of Remus’s friends was a bully, like Dudley, and he was very mean to me.”
“What happened to the bad man, Father?” Severus tried to think quickly about how to describe the situation to the boys, and quickly made the choice to keep things as simple as possible for now.
Lucius learns a little bit more about Harry's power, and makes promises.
“Yes, yes. You realize, Harry being the Promised King, he’s going to start gathering knights?” Severus blinked at the realization. He’d forgotten that the knights would be reformed. The old myths even said that Merlin himself would wake and reappear.
“You are at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry.” Harry’s eyes grew wide and he started to shake his head back and forth in denial of what he heard.
“Last, did you speak with Madam Pomfrey?” Remus sighed and went back over to his chair. He sat, and conjured a chair similar for Severus to sit in. He gestured towards it while he picked up his tea.
“Draco, what have I told you about using the Floo without your parent's permission?” Draco stopped in the middle of the room, and stared at the boy who was sitting on his uncle's couch.
“Minerva, I have an urgent situation with Harry. Can you come through and watch my second years while I investigate. You are more than welcome to dismiss them if need be.” Minerva's head came into view.
“Thank you, Mr. Lupin, for teaching me all the things.” Remus smiled at Harry.
Once classes were completed for the day (finally, Severus thought to himself), Severus made his way through the Floo to what he was sure was going to be a new and exciting conversation. He came through to quiet, unlike every other time he had come over. No one was in the receiving room. Severus walked out into the hall, following the sounds of giggling that drifted through the house.
Harry and Draco woke the next morning, their energy and high spirits returned as it was Christmas Eve. The boys chattered over breakfast about the other children, and the adults exchanged relieved looks that neither of them showed lingering effects from the previous evening. Draco and Harry went to go play, and the adults lingered over their coffee and discussed what had happened when Rowle had taken Harry. Narcissa hadn’t been there when Harry had dispensed “judgment” on Rowle, and when Severus and Lucius described it, she got a thoughtful look on her face.
“Well. It has been a very exciting evening. We should get you to bed, my special boy. Maybe I will figure out a way to make this easier to understand.” Harry smiled at his father, and they made their way towards the door.
“She says that she is, but that she has very good control of her venom.” Severus nodded.
Harry learns the truth about what happened to his parents.
“Harry, would you be okay meeting my friends tomorrow for lunch? I know that they are very excited to meet you, and I think that you and Draco could become very good friends. Once you get to know each other better, of course.” Harry watched Severus thoughtfully.
“Your son is a menace. Especially when he’s hyper. And he’s rubbing off on Harry, because hyper Harry is becoming a lot like Draco. I blame you.” Lucius looked up, saw the smile on Severus’s face, and smirked.
Severus walked back to his desk. His day was almost over, and he couldn't stop worrying about Harry. He hadn't gotten any word from Tippy that anything was wrong, but he was still concerned about Harry being left alone all day. Unable to stand waiting, he made a snap decision to dismiss class early.
“Minerva!” He called. A moment later, Minerva's head poked into the office.  Her normally tidy hair was mussed, and there was a spot of something that he suspected was leech juice on her cheek.
“Poppy, is Harry okay to be released from here? I would like to show him his new home.” Poppy nodded, a little in awe of what she had just witnessed. Much like Minerva, she had been around children for a long time and was surprised at how powerful Harry's magic was already. Severus looked down at Harry. “Harry, are you feeling up to walking, or would you like me to carry you?” Harry blinked a couple of times, as if he hadn't even considered the possibility of being carried.
“As the boys are settling down for a nap, I am going to go begin working on the Wolfsbane Potion for… Remus.” Severus muttered before stalking out of the room. Lucius knew that he would be at the Potions lab in the manor’s basement, stomping around and muttering, for the rest of the afternoon. Lucius smirked to himself once Severus had left the room. Severus was so easy to annoy.
“I know no such thing, and you seemed more than capable of taking a life or infecting another when I came face to face…” Severus was on his feet now, and he and Remus were face to face.
“Sir, I don't know if you are going to want that cat. He's not a kitten anymore, and he's about 3/4ths Kneazle. He's been returned a number of times. Poor thing, just a little over a year old.” Severus narrowed his eyes at the young snip of a boy who dared try to tell him what he wanted.
“I… I don’t want to say the wrong things. I’m tired all the time, but I don’t want to make anyone mad at me. My brain says all these mean things, and I don't know what's real. You might send me away if I am too different or a freak.” Narcissa’s heart broke for the little boy in her arms. He had dealt with so much.
“I don’t think that he realizes that he’s not speaking English, Severus.” Remus whispered.
**********
Severus knew now that there wasn't possible danger for Harry, but real reason to be concerned. It was so much closer to home than he had ever thought. The scar on Harry's head was so much more than a memory of the day it had been made. Severus made a mental note to begin research on scars caused by curses, and laid down for a sleepless night while keeping half an ear out for noise from Harry's room.
Having the rest of the day to take care of Harry put Severus in a wonderful mood. The first thing that he did after speaking with Minerva was call the Hospital Wing through the Floo and see if Madam Pomfrey was available to check on Harry. There was a student that was being treated for and allergic reaction to the nifflers in the Care of Magical Creatures class, but the student was shortly released and the mediwitch came through the Floo.
“In Cousin Narcissa's story, she said that the knights had to learn how to use their magic without wands. Can't I learn that way?” Lucius blinked a couple of times, startled, and looked at Narcissa. She looked proud and smug through the remnants of her lingering tears.
“And how…” Narcissa began, but stopped when they heard the boys coming back down the hallway.
The four of them were finally able to finish lunch, with little comments and conversations continuing. Afterwards, Narcissa let Draco and Harry go play and visit the stables so her and Lucius could talk about what just happened. They had a lot to talk about before Severus came to get Harry at the end of the day.
“Please, don't be upset. Draco is rather spoiled by his parents, and he has to learn that not everyone is going to give him whatever he wants. It will be good for him.” Harry nodded and chewed on his lower lip. He hoped that the little boy wasn't as mean as Dudley. Severus moved closer to Harry and put his arm around the young boy. “Time for bed, Harry.”
“Are you KIDDING me, Mr. Montague!! After 6 FULL years in my class, you cannot manage to keep your cauldron from boiling over? Have your eyes fallen out of your head, that you would miss the color change happening less than a foot from your face? LEAVE! Get out of my classroom, and 20 points from Gryffindor!” The focus of his wrath blinked at him for less than a moment before quickly gathering his things and fleeing the classroom. Severus Vanished the cauldron and looked around the room. “Does anyone else want to do something foolish with their potions today?” The entirety of the class shook their heads in the negative and focused their attention on their work.
“A little, but not too bad.” Severus inhaled carefully, and made sure that he locked his temper away. Harry was so hypersensitive, and he didn’t want Harry to think that he was angry at anything that he did. He remembered when he had been a young man, and any impression that someone was angry or upset made him believe that the emotions were directed at him.
Harry followed Shadow out the door, closing it quietly behind him. He hadn’t done anything that he knew his father wouldn’t like since he had started living here, and was a little worried about what was going to happen. But he felt a pull that he was SURE was his instincts, and he turned and followed Shadow down the dark hallway.
“What the hell did I just see.”
“That, Draco, is my son Harry.” Draco's eyes got so wide, Harry thought that they might pop out of his head.
Edited: 9/17/2021
“Draco? The boy who was here before?” Harry wasn't sure that someone like that would want to be friends with him, and he didn't know if he wanted to be friends with someone like that.
Severus went into his study and sat down at his desk, looking over at the picture of Lily that was on his desk. He remembered when she gave him the picture, and smiled. The picture was of Lily with Harry on her lap, and both of them were smiling and laughing. Harry would clap his hands and wave, and then both of them would smile and laugh again. Lily had sent Severus the picture just before she died, and Severus spoke to it often.
“Don’t worry, Minerva, this will work out well for everyone in time.” Albus nodded to himself, trying to appear wise. Minerva just continued to glare down at him.
“If you are going to review history, do not portray Muggles or muggle born as inferior. Both Harry and I are half blood, and I would rather not have to deal with mistaken Pure blood supremacy notions. And I will instruct him in Potions, period. “ Narcissa nodded. She had expected nothing less. Severus bid her farewell, and returned to Hogwarts. Narcissa made her way to the schoolroom.
“So this prophecy is actually true. Harry has come back, as Arthur. The snakes, the wolf,” Severus pointed at Remus, who was still pale. “And all the powers of fae and magic. Holy hell.”
Severus finished his wine, checked on Harry, and then went to bed himself.
“Um, thank you. Do you know why Shadow brought me here?” The gargoyle nodded.
“I... I so swear.” He said, after stammering for a moment and a nod from Severus. Silver light appeared and swirled around Harry, making him gasp in awe. The gold and silver light began to swirl together.
Also, a big thank you to all of the people who have left messages and kudos. I can't tell you how much it means to me that my first story has gotten this kind of response. It's very much the reason that I have the drive to keep going.
“No, Sirius Black almost killed you, and in the process, would have gotten Remus killed as well. And now he’s languishing in Azkaban. Perhaps you should leave the blame where it belongs. Remus has admitted that there is a pack bond with Harry, which means that he would NEVER hurt him. No matter what form he’s in. And by association, as Harry’s father, he now has a pack bond with you. In case it escaped you, that means that should the same situation arise, where you are confronted with Remus on the night of the full moon without the Wolfsbane potion, he wouldn’t hurt you either.” Lucius loved pointing things out when Severus missed them. Severus got a look on his face that Lucius rarely got to see, embarrassment mixed with anger and almost as if he was smelling something rotten that had gotten stuck to his shoes. Severus muttered under his breath.
Severus appeared outside the gates of Hogwarts with his precious cargo. Not wanting to cause additional injury, he laid the boy down on the ground gently and cast Levicorpus to ensure that he wouldn't be jostled as he moved through the castle.  He began to make his way up the path, heading directly to the Hospital ward rapidly. Poppy would be able to take care of Harry while Severus dealt with the Headmaster. As Severus made his way through the castle, he recast the disillusionment charm, making sure to include Harry. It wasn’t quite curfew, and he didn’t want to have to explain why he was bringing a child much too young for Hogwarts to the Infirmary to everyone who happened to walk past. As the ward came into view and he thought he was in the clear, Minerva stepped out of her office and right into his path.
“You would be dead many times over if not for that man. I would not have been able to have Draco, and if by some miracle I had been able to carry him to term, he would have been sickly and weak if not for his skills. We WILL be standing by him, end of story.” Lucius had learned the hard way not to cross his wife. She had the famous Black temper, and he knew that he would give anything to not get on the wrong side of it or her wand. He would have stood by Severus either way, but he might have looked for an advantageous angle for himself.
“The gargoyle called this the Founders Chambers.” Severus sucked a deep breath in and followed Harry down the stairs. As with most of Hogwarts, the torches lit as they came down the stairs and went out after they had passed. When they got to the door, Harry stopped so Severus could examine it. “I don’t think you should touch the door, Father. Something tells me that the door is special.” Severus was examining the door closely, but nodded in response to Harry’s comment. He was cataloging the mythology that was present on the door. The granting of Excalibur, the founders coming together, being guided by their familiars. And at the center, Avalon and the crown denoting that one day the Promised King would return. Severus’s analytical mind went into overdrive. There was only one way that Harry would be here. Only one way that Harry would be called the “Child of Magic”. Oh, his son. His magical, amazing son. Severus turned back to Harry and knelt down next to him. He knew that Harry was so young, but in some ways ancient because of what he had been through. In some ways, Severus knew that part of him was ancient because of who he was.
“Yes, that was Draco. I realize that it was a bad first impression, but I think that you will be a good influence on him. His name means 'Dragon' in Latin, in case you were interested.” Harry's eyes flickered with interest, as Severus knew that they would. Severus wasn't going to force them together, but he was not above using whatever Slytherin means necessary to at least getting them to know each other.
“He's wicked smart, and can get anywhere he wants to go. Wards or not. Locked doors, no windows, no one knows how he does it. And he's a chatty cat. Not screeching or yowling, just a lot of...” The young man stopped as the cat let off a number of interesting sounds, ranging from a chirp like a bird to a regular cat meow to a growl that almost sounded like a dog. Harry looked intrigued, and Severus looked satisfied.
Harry's eyes filled with tears and he started crying. “I won't have to go back? Not ever?” Severus shook his head.

“I know, it feels awful. It will pass in a moment.” Severus smiled. “Do you want to see something... Magical?” Harry smiled back, his color starting to return to normal.
“She says it’s much colder out here than it was in her shell, and wants to know if she can wrap around me for warmth. She also asked if I was her Master.” Harry looked up at his father. “I didn’t know what to tell her, so I said that I needed to ask you. That was why I brought her here.” Severus nodded. Severus turned to Remus. He needed to get him out of here before Harry and he discussed anything further.
“I wonder if the prophecy that the Dark Lord was worried about was referring to is this. ‘He shall have power that the Dark Lord knows not.’ That would make a lot of sense. Lucius knew about the prophecy, but Remus started at the mention of another prophecy.
He sat for a long time, drinking in the sight of the parents that he would never get to know. He could feel tears on his face. Thanks to Severus, he knew that they loved him, and that he hadn't just been abandoned. He wanted to figure out a way to pay Severus back for everything that he had done, and for everything that he was going to do. He looked around, and saw something that might work. The room was filled with bookshelves, and his aunt had made sure that he knew how to dust in order to earn his keep.
“Harry is extra special! All the figurines love him! And he likes dragons as much as I do!” Severus and Narcissa smiled at the boys. Severus noticed that Harry looked nervous, as if he was waiting to get in trouble, so Severus made sure to crouch down next to him and pick up one of the figurines.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry wakes up, and is told about magic and that he will not have to go back to the Dursley's. Severus adopt Harry, and shows him his new home.
Severus and Harry made their way out of the bustling castle and to the front gates. Once they were outside the gates, Severus looked down at Harry.
“Oh, you are just the most darling little boy. No, sweetie, I am not an elf. Just a regular lady. But I hear you are having some issues getting ready to come to lunch at my house. Do you mind if I help?” Harry shook his head, but kept his arms wrapped around Shadow who continued to purr.
Severus appeared on the corner of Privet Drive in Little Whinging, and looked around at the utterly bland houses. He wore a black suit with a Mandarin collar and black trousers, reminiscent of his teaching robes but not out of place on a Muggle street. He moved into the shadows of a large tree and disillusioned himself before making his way to the ordinary house labeled Number 4. Moving around the house, he began checking in the windows, looking for any indication that anything was wrong.  The inside of the house was just as plain as the outside, but Severus was surprised that he didn’t see any indication that Harry even lived here. There were pictures of the family, and many of a very overweight child that couldn’t possibly be Harry, but not a single picture of the child that he had been sent to check on.
“Harry, I will see you in a couple hours. Have fun.” He said, before sweeping off. Remus smothered a smiled as he closed the door. He turned to Harry, who was running his finger gently over the Occamy’s head and studying Remus. The black cat was moving around the room, poking his nose into corners and bookshelves.
Harry has a day to himself, and meets Draco. Severus tells Harry about his family.
It was about 3 in the morning when Harry stirred. Severus, who had been reading while keeping vigil, immediately put his book down and moved from his chair to sitting on the edge of Harry’s bed.
Lucius chose a deep green dress robe with subtle embroidery. Severus decided that it was close enough to black, and didn't put up a fuss. Lucius was dressed in a deep grey dress robe that matched his eyes, and knew that it would compliment whatever Narcissa wore. Somehow, they always seemed to match each other. Narcissa shortly brought the boys down, and Severus noticed that while Draco, Narcissa and Lucius all matched in various shades of grey, Harry was dressed in green robes that matches well with Severus. Severus smiled at Harry, who was swishing his robes back and forth and not paying attention. Lucius and Narcissa smiled down at him as well, and Draco reached out and took his hand as they made their way to the grand ballroom.
“Are you sure that it’s a good idea to let such a monster around the students? Think of the school’s reputation?” Albus tut-tutted and waved his hand as if he was shooing away Severus’s objections.
“Okay, Aunt Cissy.” She helped him to his feet, and he ran over and hugged his father. Narcissa watched, the burden of what Harry had been through lightened slightly by how happy he was now. She nodded at Severus, indicating that everything was okay and that they would speak later. Severus led Harry out of the room, and Narcissa could feel the anger and magic crackling around her. She knew that she would need an outlet before she sat down for dinner, lest she put her family in danger from her out of control temper and magic. She stood and made her way through the house, passing by Lucius’s study without a word. She went to the room off the kitchens where all the flatware was stored and closed the door behind her. She made sure to ward the room with the strongest wards she knew, and then promptly began breaking dishes, using both her hands and magic, since she wasn’t able to vent her spleen on the monsters who had hurt a child so badly.
“I really liked the book with all the animals, but looking at it made my head hurt, so I laid my head down.” Severus thought for a moment. He remembered that James had worn glasses, and wondered if Harry had similar eye issues.
Harry started to eat again, looking significantly less afraid and more settled. Then he paused again.
He remembered last night that there were chairs and a couch in the middle of the living room last night, but the living room looked different now. The couch and chairs were still there, but they seemed to have been shifted to the side of the living room. On the other side of the living room there was now a table for eating meals at, and his new father was sitting at it. He was sipping from a cup and reading a paper, but he set the paper aside as he noticed Harry lingering in the doorway.
After that, Merlin disappeared. Some say that Nimue still guards his sleeping form, waiting for Arthur to wake. Others say that Morgana and Nimue conspired and trapped Merlin in order to steal his remaining magic. But no one knew what happened to the father of magic.
“Thank you, so much.” He looked at it, and realized that it had been both cleaned and mended. Severus smiled back.
“That explains… the pack bond.” Lupin said quietly. Severus rolled his eyes. Of course, he thought. That explained why Lupin was so adamant that he spend more time around Harry. He can’t help it. Severus sighed then glared at Remus.
“Will Merlin come back, like Arthur?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“How did you meet my mom?” Severus smiled at the memory.
“Well, Harry, it seems that you learned from your previous classes quite well. I am very impressed!.” Harry smiled shyly, and Narcissa was charmed at how sweet he was. Narcissa turned to the chalkboard and began to tell the boys the story of the beginning of magic. The chalk rose from the ledge and began to draw the pictures of the story, moving as the story continued.
Severus was halfway through the first stage of the potion when an epiphany hit him. There were some who would see him as a monster for having taken the Dark Mark. People who wouldn’t want him around their children. Not because of who he was, but something that he had no control over now. Something that he couldn’t change. How would he feel if someone tried to keep Harry away from him because of this? He felt a stab of pain at the thought of someone keeping him from Harry, and realized that was exactly how Remus felt. His temper came back full force along with the empathy, and Severus threw the jar of Aconite in his hand across the room, momentarily enjoying the satisfying shatter it made against the stone wall. Immediately frustrated because that was all the Aconite that he had here and he would have to return to Hogwarts to get more, he growled. Putting a stasis charm around the potion and turning off the flame, Severus dropped down in a chair. He didn’t want to feel bad for Remus, or understand him. He felt the antagonism and disgust he felt for Remus slipping away, almost against his will. Severus sighed and rolled his eyes. He supposed that he was going to have to reach out to him, since he was going to Hogwarts anyway.
As the two of them sat down and started eating, Severus asked Harry if he had any questions about the things that he had seen around the wizarding world so far. Harry asked a couple of questions regarding the moving pictures and posters, and if he would be able to see Severus making potions at some point. Severus offered to make something the following morning that Harry could watch, which made Harry smile and chew his food happily. They continued to eat, and after a few minutes Harry spoke up again.
“I am going to go prepare for class. Tippy will look in on you from time to time, and will bring your lunch.” Severus stood up and went to run his hand along Harry's head affectionately. He saw Harry flinch, and then look even more sad. He knew that it was going to take time for Harry to trust that Severus wouldn't hurt him. Until then, he was going to keep demonstrating it. Severus continued with the motion and ruffled Harry's hair. Harry gave Severus a shaky smile.
Severus and Harry walked into a store called JJ Jackstraps Famous Fun Factory. Harry had never seen so many toys, and he had certainly never been to a toy store in person. He had seen Dudley's toys, but they were mostly video games and toys related to those games. But this place... this place had to be the most magical place that he had ever seen!
**********
Albus Dumbledore was very happy with how things were turning out. His original plan of keeping Harry isolated at his Muggle relatives may have gone to the wayside, but having Harry homed with Severus would be isolation enough. Albus was well enough aware of how anti-social Severus was. So Harry knew a little bit more about magic than if he had stayed with his Muggle relatives. Albus wasn't worried about that. Albus had a brief moment of concern that Harry would learn about the Noble Families and that he had responsibilities as the Scion of the House of Potter, but Albus knew that Severus had been raised with his Muggle father and would have no knowledge of this. The voting proxy for the House of Potter would remain with Albus as the Supreme Mugwump. Everything was as it should be.
“I think that Remus would be okay with that. He might be able to tell you more about Nala.” Harry smiled back and slid off Severus’s lap. He picked up Nala and made his way to the door, turning to wait for Severus to take him to Remus’s room. Severus smiled at Harry. He was such an amazing little boy.
**********
“Tippy, would you please start putting the quarters back together?” Tippy nodded  and started repairing items and putting them back in their spaces. Severus went to the Floo and threw some powder in the fireplace.
Someone ruins Severus's mood
“I won't get in trouble for asking questions?” Harry asked, just as quietly as his first response. Lucius and Narcissa both smiled.
The first thing that Severus did once he was sure that Harry was asleep was to call Poppy and make sure that the blanket that Harry had when he was found was safe. He imparted the importance to Poppy, and she reassured him that she would make sure that it was delivered to his quarters. The second thing he did was Floo call Malfoy Manor.
“Harry, would it be okay if I called for help? I am afraid that I am at a bit of a loss with what to do.” Harry chewed on his lower lip, but nodded.
“Welcome to being a parent, Severus. They will drive you crazy, and make your hair turn grey, but it’s worth it. Well, maybe your hair.” She smirked, and ran a hand over her perfect platinum locks. Lucius smirked with her, and Severus rolled his eyes at their joined vanity.
**********
“Well, Harry, you are welcome to choose. You can call me Dad, or Father, or if you are uncomfortable with either of those things, you may call me Severus.” Harry had relaxed a little bit more, and leaned his head against Severus's shoulder. He thought about it for a moment. He didn't want to call Severus by his name, because Severus was his father now. Calling him Dad seemed... irreverent, somehow. Severus, from what he had seen, seemed to be the kind of person who liked formal things, kind of like Aunt Petunia when company was coming over.
Severus looked down at Harry.
“Was there anything else that happened today?” Severus said as they sat down.
Lunch went smoothly, with Draco chattering away at all the things that he wanted Harry to do with him, and his parents responding with 'we will see' and 'in time'. Draco didn't seem dissuaded in the least. He was just excited that Harry was going to be around more. After lunch, Severus noticed that Harry seemed to be flagging. Severus knew that Draco could be draining even on the most stalwart, so he bid the Malfoy family farewell and took Harry home.
“The stairs to my right lead up to the Headmaster’s Chambers. It is not time for you to meet him. The stairs on my left lead down to the Founder’s Chambers, which has been waiting for you. Please feel free to explore. Your young familiar will let you know when it’s time for you to return to your bed.” The gargoyle gestured to his left, and Harry moved to the side and saw a staircase covered with dust. Shadow bolted down the stairs, and Harry followed him more slowly. As soon as he stepped on the stairs, torches along the wall sprang to life. Harry wasn’t surprised, as the dungeons did the same thing. They lit as he went down the stairs, and went out as he had passed. Harry counted the stairs as he went down, wanting to remember all the details just like the Malfoys had taught him.
Severus saw what was about to happen. He didn't say anything to draw attention to what was transpiring, but turned Harry so that they could both watch the drama as it unfolded.
“I was so scared! I was scared he was going to hurt me, but I was more scared that he was going to hurt you or Lucius. I couldn’t do that, I can’t lose my family again.” Severus shushed and rubbed his back in soothing circles, letting him cry out his fear. Draco, who had been asleep at the foot of Harry’s bed, woke up with the sound of Harry’s sobs.
Harry walked over to where Shadow was sitting. On the floor next to a silver and green wing backed chair was a basket, and in the basket was an egg. The egg was black with a silver sheen across it, and it almost looked like it had scales. It also seemed to glow faintly from inside. Harry reached out to touch it when he heard something speaking from inside.
The salt shaker wobbled for a moment, and then fell over. Lucius sat up straight in his chair, eyes wide as he stared at Harry. Narcissa and Draco were both staring at Harry like he had just turned into a unicorn in the dining room. Harry grinned, and looked proudly between Narcissa and Lucius.
“What happened to the bad man.” Harry asked.
“Ladies, if you will excuse me, I have to go relay this situation to the Headmaster.” Minerva looked up at him. “Don’t think for a single second, laddie, that I am going to let you go up there alone. I am going as well. “Minerva’s accent was showing, and she began to make her way towards the door of the infirmary. Severus turned back to Madam Pomfrey.
“Hello?” Said Harry back.
Severus checked the rest of their chambers, including his lab which he knew Harry wasn’t supposed to go into, and then tried not to panic as he called the best person to help search through the Floo. He might dislike the fact that the werewolf was in Harry's life, but in this situation it would be useful to have the increased sense of smell. But most of all, Remus wouldn't let Albus know that Harry was missing.
Tippy hadn't moved from the doorway of Harry's room, and was pulling on her ears. Severus knew that was her habit when she was worried.
Merlin was old, tired, and devastated by the wounding of the man he considered a son. He passed along his most treasured magics to Morgana, then gathered all of Arthur's knights. He told them that they would be needed to protect the people of the world in Arthur's absence. Then Merlin passed on his ability to use magic to the knights, telling them that the magic would pass through their family lines to one day produce knights to once again stand by the awoken Arthur's side.
“Wow! That's... wow. I have never seen everything so clear!” Poppy smiled, and began to moved towards the fireplace.
“Ari!” Draco called. A house elf in a green tea towel appeared. “Please clean my room and fix the things that I broke.” The house elf looked around the room and sighed, shaking his head.
Oh my gosh, I can't believe the amazing support that I am getting from you guys! I mean, as you know, this is my first fan fiction... In fact, it's the first story that I have ever written that has been longer than a couple of pages. I have put so much heart into making sure that this story is perfect and amazing, and I couldn't do it without all this support.
“Harry, I need to bring something to your attention.” Harry, being the observant child that he was, noticed immediately Severus’s tone of voice and put his spoon down. His stomach was in knots all of a sudden. Was Severus going to tell him that he wasn’t able to keep him? That he was going to have to leave? He remembered some of his lessons with Narcissa about not jumping to conclusions and how sometimes things weren’t what they seemed, and focused on his father.
Severus went back to the couch where Harry was surrounded by all of his new things. He kept reaching out and touching things, as if he couldn't believe that they were there and his.
“You are welcome back once your conversation is completed. We will leave the Floo open, and your regular room is always available.” Severus nodded, and sighed again. He really didn’t want to do this. He stood and made his way to the Floo, not wanting to put off the conversation longer than he had to.
“Oh Severus, every parent has those worries. You aren't alone in that regard.” Narcissa called Rose and had tea brought. Lucius spoke up.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Harry! I’m so… are you okay?” Draco asked. Harry was still crying, but he pulled back from Severus and nodded at Draco. Severus pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and dried Harry’s tears before putting it over his nose.
Severus was just getting ready to go to bed himself when he heard a cry from the other room, and as he made his way to Harry's room it grew into a shriek. Severus started running to get to Harry. He had suspected that Harry was going to have nightmares, but what he saw...
“Is there anything you can do to prevent him from leaving the grounds?” Lucius nodded.
“It's hard. Makes my head feel funny.” Severus smiled at his talented son and let the fork sink back down.
Severus sucked in a breath and let out a long sigh. That explained a great deal. Why the Dark Mark never completely faded, why it would twinge occasionally. Severus thought about what he knew about Horcruxes, and absently began to reach for the journal. Lucius pushed his hand down and away from the journal.
**********
Knowing that the only way that Harry would be completely safe with him was an adoption ceremony, Severus went to Albus and requested that one take place immediately.  Despite the hour, Albus was still in his office . When he heard Severus's request, Albus waved Severus off saying to go ahead and that he was sure Minerva would be more than happy to assist. Without hesitation, Severus called for a house elf to ask Minerva to come back to the Infirmary.
Just like yesterday, Severus sat at the table, eating breakfast and drinking coffee while reading the paper. Harry walked quietly to the table and climbed up into his chair, not wanting to interrupt his father's reading. As Harry took his seat, Severus set his paper aside.
“Yes, Harry?” Harry hadn't laid down yet, and was fidgeting and tracing the patterns on his new blanket.
“That’s fine. I was just wanting to play a game, and we needed 4 people. We can play tomorrow.” Theo and Blaise started to describe the game that they wanted to play, which had a floating ball and sounded complicated. Harry said so, and Draco told him that it made more sense when you were playing.
“Severus. You seem to have acquired a child. This is most unusual.” The man in the painting had a weird accent that sounded almost like a lisp. Harry looked at the man in the painting and blinked sleepily.
The Malfoy family had always home schooled their children until they attended secondary school. Draco was familiar with the room, and had brought Harry here. There were now two desks instead of one, and bookshelves lined the room with the exception of the front where a chalkboard covered the entire wall. The boys were seated and waiting for Narcissa while Draco regaled Harry with his adventures in the stables and the creatures that lived there.
“And how long has she been waiting to hatch… where ever she was.” Harry hissed again, and a longer hissing came from the serpent.
**********
Thank you for reading, please keep it up!
“Harry, are you okay?” Severus asked. Harry didn’t respond, and a moment later would have fallen to the ground had Severus not caught him.
Harry hated his hair. Aunt Petunia used to yell about it all the time, and at one point she had shaved his head. It had grown back over night, and Uncle Vernon had gotten very angry. Harry was a little worried that his father was going to get mad too, but he didn't seem to be. Just confused. Harry would still watch for it. He was very good at being able to tell when people were getting angry.
“It’s too long to go into before dinner, so I will start with the easiest bit of news. I found out that Harry is a Parselmouth.” Lucius and Narcissa looked at each other with wide eyes. While being a Parselmouth had negative connotations through some circles, in theirs it was widely known as a powerful and highly respected magical gift.
“Are you an elf-lady?” Severus's eyes flickered closed then back open, and his hand came up to cover the smile that he couldn't hold back.  Narcissa burst into delighted laughter. Harry thought that her laugh sounded like bells.
“Like how I thought that Mr. Malfoy was mean to begin with, but now I know that he’s really not, he’s just really serious?” Severus nodded.
“Well, as the Headmaster neglected to follow up with him prior to the end of October, I am unsure of the more distant past. But they almost killed him just prior to my arrival. If you want the gory details, ask Madam Pomfrey.” Severus swept his robe around him and walked around Remus, making his way quickly down the hallway until he heard his voice called quietly.
“My apologies, Minerva, I didn’t have the chance to get out of your way when you stepped out.” Minerva blinked in surprise, not only at Severus’ presence but also at his politeness. Severus was well known for being especially venomous when surprised. Then her eyes narrowed in suspicion.
“We will continue this conversation once the children have gone to bed.” Lucius said, and the adults all stood and moved towards the door.
“My goodness, child, you didn't need to add THAT many daisy roots. Didn't you READ the recipe at all? Mr. Burbage, just WHAT do you think you are doing with those leeches? Put them down at ONCE! Ms. Beecham, the leeches are on the other side of the classroom from you, please do stop shrieking.” He could hear a general din of noise from the classroom that NEVER happened when he was in class.
Severus eventually found the Malfoys and Harry in the reading room. Narcissa was blowing bubbles with her wand, and Harry and Draco were chasing the bubbles around the room. Lucius sat in one of the wing back chairs and watched with an indulgent smile. As Severus walked in, Lucius nodded at him and Harry ran over, wrapping his arms around Severus’s waist.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes, sometimes people make mistakes. Sometimes the mistakes are bigger, sometimes smaller, but it’s important to learn from our mistakes. I learned that bullying is never okay.” Harry nodded again, then a different look came into his eyes. He seemed to have figured out whatever it was about Remus that he wanted to.
There were action figures, but they walked around on the tables and shelves on their own. There were knights yelling challenges to passing customers and tiny wizards that stroked their long beards and talked amongst themselves. There were animals of all sorts that roared and chittered and made real animal noises.
“Bloody fucking Malfoy and his bloody blood wards!” The man turned towards Harry, and saw that he was scooting away. “Oi, get back here, you little shit! You aren’t going anywhere!” The man quickly walked over to Harry and picked him up by his hair, dragging him back onto his feet. Harry cried out at the pain. He hadn’t hurt like this since he was back with his uncle. Something inside him was building and growing, fizzy and hot. Something he knew would protect him, but would also change him.
Severus picked Harry up and started walking towards Magical Menagerie. Moments later, they stepping into a dimly lit shop filled with the sounds and smells of assorted animals. The shop boy behind the counter smiled at the two of them.
Harry goes on an unexpected adventure, and Severus learns of yet another unique skill his son has.
Not wanting to startle the young boy, Severus knelt down and ran his hand over Harry’s head. “Harry… Harry, wake up.” The little boy whimpered, but didn’t wake. Severus got down on his knees and gently moved to pull Harry out from under the hedge. Harry whimpered again, but it was less sleepy and more pained. Severus realized that he must be more injured than he thought, and his rage at the monsters that had treated a child this way grew. His own childhood abuse made the harming of a child anathema to him. Working as quickly and as gently as he could, Severus magically cleaned the blanket that wrapped Harry and used it to slide Harry out so he could pick him up, being careful to not jostle him. As Harry was lifted up, he woke briefly. He saw a man with dark hair and dark eyes, and thought that maybe he was Death. He didn’t want to die, but anything was better than the pain in his side and his head. He wished that he could have convinced his aunt and uncle to love him, even a little.  As he was lifted, Harry passed back out from the pain.
“Father said that you might know more about Nala?” Hearing her name, the Occamy lifted her head. Remus smiled.
“How were morning lessons?” Narcissa noticed that Harry flinched a little when Lucius spoke.
Once they had finished eating, Severus had Harry come over to the couch, and he pulled a book of the bookshelf.
Remus was surprised when a knock came to his door. Thinking that Minerva or Dumbledore had come to wish him Happy Christmas, Remus took a deep breath and sat up as he smelled Severus and Harry outside his door. He stood up and straightened his clothes, then opened the door. Severus stood there, looking uncomfortable but not antagonistic as he had on previous visits. If Remus didn’t know better, he would have thought he saw frustrated understanding in Severus’s eyes. Harry stood next to him, holding his hand, the other holding his Occamy friend and his black kitten sitting next to him placidly.
“I don't know if I can, but I can try. I mean... “Harry looked at Narcissa and Lucius, as if for permission. Narcissa smiled at Harry. She felt a strong protectiveness welling up in her. This poor little boy, magical beyond belief, tormented by his own family. She would protect him if it was the last thing she did, as she did her own son.
Narcissa, being the observant mother that she was, noticed that Harry had started to pull away from the other children. She watched Harry carefully for weeks, more and more concerned when she saw that he often seemed concerned and worried. A few weeks after the New Year, she pulled Harry aside as the other three boys raced off to play outside after lessons.
Even though he was only watching, Draco watched Harry and beamed with pride as he answered all the questions correctly. By the end of Harry's short quiz, Draco was bouncing happily in his seat. He was overjoyed at how smart his new friend was.
Severus, Narcissa, and Lucius had quickly decided that whatever had happened tonight would be discussed later, once they made sure that Harry was okay. Lucius and Narcissa attempted to get Draco to go to bed, but when he continued to refuse, allowed him to stay and went to bed themselves. Severus continued to sit at Harry’s bedside and watched him sleeping, checking his temperature and vitals almost like clockwork on the hour. He understood now why Narcissa had sat up with Draco all night when he was ill, and the worry that had plagued Lucius on occasion. Severus thought about how Harry had reacted to the situation earlier. He didn’t seem to care about his own well being, only his family. And then, there was the judgment… He didn’t know if Harry remembered what happened, but he would help his son deal with whatever repercussions lingered after tonight.
Severus was taking deep breaths, doing his best to not panic at what he had just discovered about his son. A piece of the Dark Lord was attached to his innocent son. A ferociousness that he had never known, even more than when Lily died, welled up from deep inside him. He would get that slimy piece of monster away from his son if it was the last thing that he did, he swore by Merlin and Morgana. He was startled when Lucius's hand again touched his shoulder. He had all but forgotten that Lucius was there.
“I remember trying to call snakes, and asking them for help so the bad man didn’t hurt my family… but I don’t remember what happened after that.” Severus subtly sighed in relief. He didn’t want Harry to have to worry about the memories of Rowle dying.
Thank you everyone for all of the wonderful comments. Quick update this week, unexpected urge to write took me over. Should be able to get another update next week sometime. Enjoy your Thanksgiving fellow Americans!
Harry walked into the circular room that the gargoyle had called “The Founders chambers”. The room had a number of couches and chairs, and looked like a cross between the fancy furniture from the Malfoy house and the furniture around his own quarters with his father. There were four doors leading off the room, each a different color wood. One was a bright golden wood with black iron fittings, one was a pretty red wood with gold fittings. One was a black wood that had an almost blue hue with bronze fittings, and the last was a greenish silver with silver fittings. Remembering what he learned about the Founders of Hogwarts, he knew which room belonged to each founder. He wasn’t sure why he had been led here, but he thought that he should show his father this as soon as possible. He turned to leave when he heard Shadow chirp.
Once Harry and Severus got home, Severus recommended that Harry take a nap after his busy afternoon. Harry agreed, and laid down on his bed without even a comment. Severus was very happy that the afternoon had gone so well, and that Harry was not going to be by himself during the day. Severus was very happy with how the afternoon had gone.
“I think I would like to call you Father, if that is okay.” Harry murmured into Severus's shoulder. Severus nodded, and stopped in front of a large painting. Harry looked up at the painting. Standing in the middle of the painting was an austere man in a long green robe with silver trim. The man in the painting looked at Severus, and then at Harry.
“Harry, did you know that you are speaking a different language when you speak with the egg? That you hiss like a snake?” Harry blinked at his father.
“I'm sorry, I'm so sorry Father. I didn't mean to break anything, I didn't know what would happen, I'm sorry...” his voice cracked on a sob, and renewed tears streamed down his face. Severus knelt down in front of the wardrobe.
“Severus! I am sorry, I didn’t see you.” Severus didn’t need to fake a sneer this time.
“Harry, before we get started, I would like to check and see how far your previous education brought you.” She went over to one of the bookshelves and pulled out a book. She handed it to Harry. It wasn't something he had ever seen before, and there was a dragon and a unicorn on the cover. “Harry, please read the first page of this book out loud.” Harry opened the book to the first page.
A moment later, the shop boy came down the isle. Harry was on his knees in front of the cage, and the cat was alternating between rubbing himself against the front of the cage and sticking his paw out and playing with Harry's hair while Harry giggled.
Harry was fascinated by the story. He could just picture all of the knights with their new magic, and the Fae Queen Lady of the Lake. Narcissa turned back to the boys.
“Arrestro.” The book stopped in it's path and immediately dropped to the floor. Harry had probably been terrified, given that he had very limited exposure to magic. He started checking the bathroom and living room, checking for a messy head of black hair.
“I think you are just glad that Harry’s coming out of his shell.” Severus chuckled and nodded.
My sincere apologies to all of you who have been waiting for an update. Between the holidays, a big event, and then assisting with running a wedding, I totally didn't have time to get this posted. Written, yes, but not posted. I hope this newest chapter brings you as much joy to read as it gave me to write.
In Number 4 Privet Drive, a scared little boy curled up on a blanket on the floor. His aunt had taken away the bed that he had been sleeping in because Dudley was too fat to sleep in his small bed, and needed 'his own space now that he was growing up'. That meant that there was ' no space' for Harry, so his aunt had cleaned out the cabinet under the stairs and told Harry that this would be his room from now on. Harry knew better than to argue.

Having completed everything he needed to do for the Wolfsbane Potion in about 2 hours, Severus went to collect Harry. He knocked on Remus’s door, surprised that he could hear Harry giggling on the other side. The door opened, and Remus quickly stepped aside to let Severus in. Harry jumped up from the chair he was sitting and ran over with a book in his hand.
Lucius was quite distracted with how he was going to approach the other Pure blood wizards regarding the adoption of Harry and Lucius's support of him instead of the Dark Lord. He knew that there were a number of wizards like Macnair, and the Carrows, and Rowle, that he knew would target Harry as soon as they knew without some sort of motivation to leave him alone. He knew that he was going to have to keep an eye on Harry while he was there for lessons and see if there was anything that could keep Harry safe from the monsters that he once called friends.
“Do either of you have any questions?” Harry thought about the story for a minute.
“This door, Harry, leads to my private laboratory and study. If the door is closed, that means that I want privacy or that I am working on a potion that might be dangerous for you to be around. If you knock, and I don't answer, it means that I am busy with whatever project, and unless it's an emergency, you will need to wait for me to answer. If it is an urgent matter, you may enter the study and call for me.” Harry nodded in understanding, too sleepy to think of a response or question.
“Severus, I don't know how else to say this, but your son... Sev, he's so powerful! To be able to do wandless magic, at his age! He's not even reached his first magical growth spurt! He's... he's so special.” Lucius looked shaken, and in awe.
“That's much better. You might consider growing it out some. The weight helps with the curl.” She moved out of the bathroom and towards the hearth. “You gentlemen are more than welcome to come to the house early instead of waiting for lunchtime. If you would like.” Severus looked at Harry, and Harry could tell that his father was going to let him decide.
“Oh my word…” Narcissa whispered.
“Oh, of course, in my excessive free time between teaching, and grading, and brewing the potions for the infirmary, and watching the child.” Albus smiled at him, either oblivious or intentionally ignoring his sarcasm. Severus would bet his solid gold cauldron that it was the latter.
“Yes.” Harry looked at the basket. Neither the basket nor the egg were too big for him to carry, kind of like the Easter baskets that his aunt used to get for Dudley full of candies. Harry gently picked up the egg and basket and made his way out of the chamber, the torches going out as the door closed behind him.
**********
Severus went back into Harry's room to find him curled up on his bed, the giant dragon behind him and the little dragon figurine on the bed in front of him. Harry had found a ribbon somewhere, and was dangling it along so that the little dragon could chase and pounce on it.
“Well, he is quite mannerly.” Severus came into the room.
Confused at what he was looking at, Severus cast Lumos but kept the light from his wand shielded from the house by his jacket. He moved closer to the child and leaned down to look at the boy in the dim light. As light fell across the boy’s face, Severus saw a bruise spreading across from his temple to below his eye. His lip was split, and as Severus got closer he could smell urine strongly. Severus’ mind raced to piece together what he had witnessed. He dispelled the Lumos and stood up, grinding his teeth and trying to control his temper.
“We would be honored and happy to help, Severus, with anything that you and your son need. I am excited to meet him. I am sure that he and Draco will be fast friends, once they meet properly.” She thought for a moment. “With what that poor child went through, I am sure that he is small for his age?” She waited for Severus to nod. “Would you be opposed to some of Draco's clothing? A great deal of it is new and has never been worn, and it will give you and your son time to bond before having to go out in public to go clothing shopping.” Severus smiled and nodded. He knew that Narcissa would never give him anything that wasn't of the highest quality. Narcissa nodded and smiled in return. “Rose, please attend.”
“Harry, good morning. Please come out. You don't have to be afraid.” Harry swallowed and slowly made his way to the table. He stood next to Severus until Severus pulled a chair out and gestured towards it, indicating for Harry to sit. “Harry, I wanted to talk to you about a couple of things before I go to teach classes for the day.” Harry nodded, not sure if a response was expected or wanted.  He didn't want to make Severus regret taking him in.
“Innocent?” Harry hissed incredulously. “She killed Sirius!”
“Oh Harry, you couldn’t have helped that. We know... we know you would have done right by her if you’d been awake,” Mrs. Weasley said.  Harry nodded, because he would have asked Ginny to marry him, and would have been so grateful if she’d decided she wanted Harry after all.
Harry tried to ease into the topic; more for his sake than hers. But Ginny had always been able to see through his bullshit. “Harry, I love that I get to see you. I really do. But you’re not here for a snog in the woods...” she prompted.
“And the wizarding world is catching on,” Burke continued. “They know their supposed golden boy is tarnished. Why, you’re practically as dark as you-know-who.”
Harry held a photo of Draco in one hand and the photo of Ginny in the other and tried to figure out if this had always been the case. His romantic feelings for Ginny were relatively new but they had been strong. His fantasies had certainly been intense, and just as frequent as the naughty thoughts he had about Draco. Both seemed equally unlikely to happen, so he had resigned himself to a non-existent love life. Until now. Lucius’s encouragement to pursue his son reframed how Harry saw their future. Draco suddenly felt like a real possibility rather than a pipe dream. It was thrilling. With a sigh, he gathered up the photos and left Draco’s photo on top. He tucked them into his pillowcase and hoped the guards wouldn’t bother to check there.
From the hallway Wiblin kept looking into the cell. Various curses left him, and his eyes kept sliding from Harry to Burke and back again. Harry still wasn’t wearing his glasses so Wiblin’s features were blurry. Just having the man nearby was doing nothing to calm Harry’s racing heart and laboured breathing.
“Has he ever expressed negative thoughts about muggles, or said he’d like to hurt them?” asked Bones. Harry frowned because the answer was yes, but he didn’t want to say so. However, if he said no, it would probably be obvious that Harry was lying for Albert. Harry got the impression Albert hadn’t censored himself prior to arrest. Harry knew he’d have to give Bones a delicate balance of truth, lies, and misdirection so that Harry’s statements came across as honest, believable, and left a good impression of Albert.
“What’s a horcrux?” Draco asked.
“Sure mate,” Ron said. Harry was surprised that Hermione didn’t jump in to lecture them about abusing prefect privileges.
Harry stood on shaky legs and moved closer to the cell door. He still couldn’t see the man well enough to spot all of his injuries. Harry merely had to wish that Albert’s cell was better illuminated before a blindingly bright light filled the entire cell.
When Harry noticed Albert was struggling to lift his hand to the soap dispenser, he reached over and pressed it for him. Harry was too embarrassed to offer to wash the man for him. However, the more Albert struggled, the more Harry thought he should offer to help. Fortunately, Mulciber had finished his shower so he moved into Albert’s stall to help.
Mrs. Weasley grasped the chain of the necklace she was wearing and tugged the pendant out from under her shirt, where it had been resting. She undid the clasp of the necklace and removed what Harry thought was a pendant and placed it in his hand. As Harry’s eyes focused on it, he inhaled sharply, and a heavy weight settled in the pit of his stomach.
?” Ginny questioned. Harry shrugged. Ron and Hermione would likely catch her up on his feeling about the prisoners later.
“Oh... he wouldn’t have said anything. Not about... that,” Draco said.
“You could always try to create the spell,” suggested Rodolphus. Harry had never consider creating his own spells before. He wasn’t sure how to go about it, so the others started explaining how they would use the known spells as a springboard to develop additional variations. Together the men picked apart their knowledge of enhanced vision, Polyjuice, and shape shifting characteristics. By the time they were satisfied their spell would work, Harry couldn’t help but feel proud. He not only understood the logic behind the new spell, but had also contributed to the discussion that helped them arrive at the incantation for their new spell. They would have to test the spell to ensure it would work, but Harry was already jumping forward; he had a similar suggestion for a variation that would enable someone to see if a nearby animal was actually someone’s Animagus form. Harry nervously shared this with the others. They had just started to debate the feasibility of the spell working, when the guards returned to announce it was shower time.
“Yeah. Increased salary too,” Ron said. “But it was horrible in the meantime. If Fred and George’s shop hadn’t been doing well, we would have been in trouble. Except, they seemed to realize that and tried going after the shop too until Fred, well, he sort of... leaked that you’d been the one to originally finance the shop. The ministry backed off because they knew it’d look like they were targeting the shop because you were a silent partner.”
“I’m going to look into soul magic. I think there may be a few books in the family library, but I doubt they cover something as advanced as horcruxes. The only soul magic I can think of off the top of my head are rituals to communicate with dead ancestors, or old-fashioned marriage ceremonies that
“And?” prompted Runecraft.
It was a valid argument. He really had no business making decisions about what was best for the other man. He could only decide what he would be willing to live with. He thought his own conscience would not allow him to risk hurting Draco, and thus he held back. But rejecting the man now would hurt them both. And frankly, Harry was running out of strength to resist what he truly wanted if it was actually within his grasp. He resolved that he would allow himself this, and spend every day making sure Draco had no cause to regret it. “Alright... that’s fair,” he admitted.
“Yes, Albus, I do,” he again puffed out his chest importantly. Under different circumstances Harry might be amused by the man’s peacock impression. As it was, Harry’s stomach was in knots and he was desperately wishing that Professor Dumbledore will be able to get him out of this.
For a few minutes, the others were quiet as they absorbed the news. Eventually some of the men started guessing at what Draco’s task could be. Each suggestion seemed to worry Malfoy no matter how outrageous it seemed.
Hale paused a moment before he asked if Harry would be willing to answer some questions about Albert. Harry readily agreed, and told Hale about Burke’s attack on Albert. When Harry glanced at the window, he was concerned to note that Albert was not waiting with the guards.
During this time, Harry did not get any more visits from Hale or any news about the state of his trial. The guards refused to tell him any news, though they remained otherwise professional. The prisoners were given daily showers, meals were passed out efficiently, and all exchanges between guards and prisoners were brief without being excessively rude. When one of the prisoners had tripped and scraped his palm and knee, the guard that had ‘healed’ Harry’s earlier injuries had stepped up to heal that prisoner.
“Then... why are you still with me? Why would you want to marry me?” Harry couldn’t help but ask.
“No. I don’t know. It’s dark magic, so they wouldn’t admit it if they were experts. I could probably ask professor Dumbledore. He’s the one that told me about the others. If anyone is able to-” Harry suddenly stopped talking as another horrible thought occurred to him. Professor Dumbledore had been looking into Lord Voldemort’s horcruxes. If Harry was one, the man probably already knew. Equal parts anger and despair rose in him as he contemplated the likelihood that Dumbledore had already figured this out but held back that information from Harry. Was the man ever going to tell him? Was he saving it as the grand finale as he took Harry on a journey through Voldemort’s past? The hurt festered as he realized Dumbledore planned to destroy the horcruxes. What did that mean for Harry? What did Dumbledore expect to do about that one? Harry feared the answer.
“Bradley, I have him. Would you mind getting the door?” Perkins prompted, causing Bradley to reluctantly lower his wand and exit the carriage.
“But Hale did his thing, right?” asked Harry worriedly. “You know, trip them up, turn things around on them, that sort of thing?”
"Could you make another box like the one you made for me?" he asked. "There should be enough room to fit multiple letters. You can also wear it as ankle bracelet so it's on you when you're released."
“That’s quite insightful,” said Lucius once he realized Harry was done. He was giving Harry a soft look that many people would assume the man incapable of. Harry shrugged feeling embarrassed.
“Yup,” Harry said and made sure to pop the p at the end.
” was the response. The three dementors moved minimally closer to Harry’s cell.
“It is also not the boy’s first infraction,” continued the auror. “Just before his second year, there was a levitation charm used at his muggle relatives’ residence. The-“
“Anything else?” Harry asked. Despite performing spells all morning, he wasn’t the least bit tired.
muggles, but he’s a Death Eater. He must have hurt some muggles at some point,” stated Hawkworth.
“He misses you and your mum... he gets this look whenever he’d talk about you. I don’t know, he just... stopped being a prisoner for a moment. That doesn’t make sense! It’s like...” Harry struggled with how to express it, but he tried because Draco hung to every word he said. “Thinking about you brought back all the good that Azkaban sucked out.”
Harry was surprised to see Nott still at their table when he returned. He had assumed that either Ron would drive him away or Nott wouldn’t voluntarily stick around without Harry there. It made it easier to only have to recount the interview once.
“OK, but again... how?” asked Nott. They all looked at Harry, and waited for an answer. He understood their curiosity, but couldn’t answer their question, especially in a public place.
“Isn’t that a bad thing?” Harry asked.
“I don’t think I appreciated how hard it was for you. The media alone...” Neville trailed off. Harry could sympathize. Being the one who vanquished Voldemort, Neville suddenly gained a lot of attention, from both the media and admirers. For someone as shy as Neville, it was a lot of change, most of which was very much unwanted.
“Potter, you’ve just returned from Azkaban. You shouldn’t return to classes until we’ve evaluated what you can handle,” Snape insisted.
“How?” asked Nott.
Alas, that wasn’t the route Harry took.
“Nott is not a reliable witness. He’s not only a
of you know...” the guard started to trail off as Burke’s glare focused on him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You know Weasley and Granger would give me a hard time if I mysteriously showed up and wanted to talk to you alone,” Draco pointed out.
“Thank you,” Harry said. It was a huge relief. He felt like things were finally moving forward.
The two were forced to cut their bickering short when they entered the library. They occasionally exchanged heated whispers, which grew in frequency each time Hermione refused to share her notes with Ron.
“No. I lived with the worst human being to ever live. As much as you might have followed his footsteps in making a horcrux, you are nothing like him,” Draco reassured.
