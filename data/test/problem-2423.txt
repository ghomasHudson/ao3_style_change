And when the brunette stood up Draco did the same
"It will be alright," Hadrian said, "At least now I know why I always had such a strong connection to Tom; I've had part of his soul in me since I was a baby. And, since Tom isn't crazy anymore, my scar hasn't been hurting me either. What time are we leaving tomorrow?" Hadrian turned his attention to Narcissa, "I'd like to visit the twins again if I can."
“My attention?” Draco asked, and Harry nodded once more. He licked his lips and started to speak, but Draco was faster; he leaned down- the blond was a couple of inches taller than Harry- and captured Harry’s lips in a passionate kiss. One of Draco’s arms wound around Harry’s waist, pulling him closer, while the other hand tangled in his hair, making the tiny bells jingle. Harry found himself mirroring Draco, with one arm around the other man’s waist, and he cupped the back of Draco’s neck with his free hand.
“Malfoy?” Harry shouted, flicking his hand and calling his wand into it, “What are you-what is this?”
“Come on, Potter,” Draco began tugging him towards the castle, “We have a party to get to, and then we have a clue to unravel.”
"Wait, so you're saying Ginny isn't really our sister?" Fred demanded, "That's just-" He broke off, shaking his head in denial.
"We suspect that Albus Dumbledore has been making unauthorized withdrawals from the Potter and Black vaults. We wish to file lodge a formal complaint on behalf of the heirs to those two estates, and also request a full accounting of the money spent since the deaths of James and Lily Potter. In addition, we are requesting an investigation into any withdrawals from the Riddle vaults, as well as attempts to gain access to the vaults belonging to the Potter’s, Black’s, and Riddle’s. "
"Of course," Severus said silkily and Hadrian turned to look at him with hopeful eyes; "All you have to do is reject Draco once he gets his inheritance and then you won't have to worry about being his mate."
“Harry isn’t ready for that, Luna-love,” Pansy said, smiling softly at her girlfriend before turning her attention back to Harry, “Well, at least it fits. Here; I already had this made, I just needed your measurements so I could make the final adjustments.” She summoned a bundle of cloth- thankfully much more substantial than what he was currently wearing- and ushered Harry back into the dressing room.
“That-definitely doesn’t sound good,” Harry said, “Why didn’t she-”
"They had better not stare at you if they know what's good for them," Draco growled, wrapping a possessive arm around his mates' waist; "I can't promise that I will be able to control my instincts the next time I perceive someone as a threat. What is Mother telling the guests?"
"Yes," Draco grumbled, continuing to look at the wall, "You're only being nice now because you'd feel guilty if I died; I don't want you to be my mate out of pity or guilt."
The letter was strange; what could his younger self have done that was so terrible he would lock away the memories? Even now he wasn't proud of the way he allowed the Dursley's to treat Harry, but he understood that it was necessary; Harry had to be taught his place, and it was too dangerous to do it here at school where someone might notice. If Harry was allowed to grow up worshipped and adored by his relative's as he was by the Wizarding world he would never be able to do what needs to be done, never be able to sacrifice himself for the Greater Good.
"Don't use that stuff on it," Hadrian said, making a face at the gel in Draco's hand, "You look like a prat when you slick your hair back like that."
The next morning, Harry was smiling as he walked through Diagon Alley, enjoying the quiet of the morning. It was cold out, but Harry was warm in a hand-knitted sweater, and he had decided to walk in to work instead of apparating. He was even earlier than planned-it was only now seven-but Harry thought that he could offer to help Mrs. Weasley, who had
“I never meant to come off sounding stuck up,” Draco frowned, “I was just acting the way my father taught me to; as for Weasley…I’ll admit I did insult him, but he insulted me first.”
“He’s amazing,” Harry replied, laughing as Crispin nuzzled at his chest, “Sorry, buddy; I don’t have any carrots.”
Nightmares can’t reach me
Harry scowled at Malfoy’s back as the blond sauntered out of the common room-after trapping him into helping Justin and Michael with their Defense assignments. The Slytherin had done it on purpose, Harry was sure; he just didn’t know why. Was it just Malfoy’s way of being a prat and continuing their rivalry? Harry decided he would corner the blond for a talk as soon as possible, and see about putting it all behind them; he was finally rid of Voldemort, and the last thing he wanted was for Draco to continue causing problems for him at school.
“Fuck. I’m gonna have to talk to Snape,” Harry groaned, flopping back onto his bed. He didn’t want to talk to his most-hated professor, but he was the only person Harry thought would be completely objective about this. The only problem was getting Snape to answer him without telling the headmaster.
"No. Do I look like I'm capable of doing more than one step a minute?"
"And you're a Ravenclaw. Bye Ginny, I'm going to work."
"Dad?" Albus' voice said from behind the door.
Tears started streaming down his face.
The faith of the rest of my belongings should be decided on by my four (4) children, my best friends Hermoine Granger and Ron Weasley, my boyfriend, Draco Malfoy.
"I wish I did that with my kids. Ginevra wouldn't let me."
"Harry? 'You alright?" Ginny said.
"I swear this time the healer won't tell."
"Better now we're with aunt Hermoine and uncle Ron."
"Ew."
"Draco? Will you, kiss me? When he's doing it?"
It wasn't until half an hour before work was done that someone knocked on his door.
"do I really have to Hermoine?"
"he said; GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE!" Hermoine yelled.
"Really?" Harry asked, more to the ceiling than to Draco.
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna-
"That you are lying. Harry and I are friends." Senna said.
"HARRY!"
Harry James Potter.
"Is Mr. Draco coming? Is he bringing scorp?"
"I told them that Harry's in the hospital, and they were worried." She said, and Harry could HEAR her rolling her eyes.
"Yeah, let's do that so that everyone can read about 'Golden Boy Coughs Up Blood' in the Daily Prophet tomorrow."
"Draco. It's okay. I love you."
"Are you sure I look good?"
"Fair enough. See that red button above your bed? Press it if you need something."
Knock knock
"Draco. You did the best you could. And like you said yourself, it's a lost cause. I'm gonna die either way. And I want to die while actually knowing who I am."
"That's horrible."
The heartbeat that used to comfort Draco stopped.
Draco grabbed it. It was a little piece of paper wrapped around a stone.
Harry didn't eat in Ron's office that day. In fact, he didn't eat anything. So now there was a sandwich covered in blood, somewhere in one of the many bins in the Ministry.
"Dad! How are you?" Albus said.
Draco snorted. "Definitely not. I think I'll have to take a scan of your brain, or what is in their place."
There was a white wooden door that Harry assumed to be the entrance to the bathroom.
Hermoine had helped Harry with the divorce papers, and send them to Ginny to sign them.
"I don't think so Scorp."
With 2018 being such a good year, Harry was afraid 2019 would be horrible, but, as he had learned after many many years of unwanted fame, he put on a mask, showing everyone to be happy and excited for the new year.
Only a few seconds later, the door opened to reveal Ginny. Or, as Harry saw it, a blurry eclipse-kinda yellow thing with an orange blob around the top.
Draco only started laughing, something Harry had never seen him doing. Not that he could see it now, but he could imagine the way his perfect lips would form a smile, the way his grey eyes would glitter and light up the room, and the sound, oh, the sound. It was bea... Nevermind.
Harry slowly faded. And then, he was gone.
"Harry?" Ron came back in the room, to see Harry coughing up blood. "HARRY! Are you okay!? Harry, you gotta go home! You're sick!"
"So why are you here? I suppose it's not to see my face."
"How does that ma-"
Sometimes he felt like a plant. A special plant in some kind of plant Center and all people wanted to see the plant. But he didn't want them to see him. Not like this, when he was weak, and ugly.
"What in the devil is going on here?" Draco's voice said as he opened the door. "Why are there so many people in here? Harry is only supposed to see 4 people at once, and with miss Granger-Weasley and the whole Quidditch team, I see that there are 8 people here. At least for of you have to leave."
I gift Grimwould Place to Luna Lovegood's charity for children who don't have a safe home to return to, in the hope she can now save more children.
"Don't say anything. I don't want you to answer me because I'm dying, or because I'm Harry Potter. Please, answer me honestly."
X X X
"I am. The stone in your hand is the resurrection stone. I can't stay for long, I don't belong here anymore. Keep the stone and bring me back every once in a while, so I can talk to my children. I want to thank you. You saved my life. I know it sounds stupid but it's true. Here in the afterlife, one will always feel the last feeling they had before they died. Not strong, but as an undertone. Last time, I felt terrified and sad the whole time I was here. Now, I feel loved. Thanks to you. I have to go now. It hurts to stay here too long. Please find someone who loves you and takes care of you. You deserve a happy life. I love you."
Turn the stone three times and think of me.
"And why would he say that? He's my husband (" ex-husband" Draco said annoyed between Ginny in.) And he loves me, just as much as I love him."
"You all right mate?"
"Hey, Harry. How's it going?" He asked.
"It's worse."
"Yeah, the usual," Harry said, with a hoarse voice.
She looked at him, and whispered a small 'thank you'. Draco left her alone in the bedroom of her suite and went to the sitting room. It was her wedding day today, and just like James had done at his wedding with Arne, she got to talk to Harry.
It was Friday, and Draco had come to visit Harry alone. They had talked about a lot of stuff until Harry asked the question he had wanted to ask for a while already.
"Why Hermoine? You're not a healer to are you?"
"Stop it." He said when Fleur, who had helped to set the table, dropped the plate she was supposed to place in front of Harry. Everyone looked at him again.
"Enough! Ma'am. You must leave the room immediately. If not, your parental rights will be removed."
"Pacifinevita"
"She's not! We're friends!"
In that crowd, was Harry Potter. Not that anyone gave a shit. This was a muggle pub and there rarely came wizards here. That's how Harry preferred it. He had never liked the fame, and he won't ever like it. He was, unlike many others, not happy with the start of 2019. 2018 had been the best year of his life so far. He'd married Ginny again to celebrate their 10 year marriage anniversary, Lily had started her first year at Hogwarts, and Luna, who was still single, had adopted Emily Brown, who had been sent to the nearest muggle orphanage when her parents found out she was a squib. Harry had been made her godfather.
"Are you sure you want to go to work today sweetheart?" She said.
"I love you dad."
"Yes, you were." He said, earning a punch from his wife.
"I'm sorry ms. Weasley, but Mr Potter has asked us not to let you in." Draco's voice sounded from behind the door.
But the pillow wasn't hugging back.
That evening, Harry found himself sitting at the backseat of Hermoine's car, driving to st. Mungo's.
"Of course. I love you, Harry."
"Why?"
"Yes Al, now open the door please."
(Fuck I'm crying.)
Harry just nodded.
Because Love is stronger than Death.
"But, but I already died."
It was now Friday and Draco had told Harry he would have to leave early, as the Easter holidays started, and he'd have to pick up Scorpius.
They all nodded, but Molly had to use the bathroom again.
Draco knew the answer was 'yes' but he couldn't bring himself to saying that. He couldn't bring himself to lie to Harry either.
"Okay, I know, but really, you look good. And Lukas is going to think the same. For, more reasons than the fact that you're showing off more than you should at your wedding."
"Wha- I- am I going- I don't understand I-"
"Hello to you to Hermoine."
=|•[#]•|=
"Yes. Mother and I renovated the Manor."
"Mr Black, that is not how you are supposed to act around patients." Hermoine interrupted him.
Draco was about to leave, when something, very Gryffindor, came to Harry's mind.
"Draco. Wait."
"I'm not dead. So stop acting like it."
I gift my half of the parental rights on James Sirius Potter, Albus Severus Potter, and Lily Luna Potter to my boyfriend Draco Lucius Black.
Harry drank it, and really wanted to puke it out as soon as the potion had touched his lips. It tasted like polyjuice potion with Crabbe's toenails, mixed with something that he didn't know but tasted horrible, so it was probably dragon shit, mixed with the taste of death you have in your mouth when someone dies nearby.
By now, tears were streaming down Draco's face.
"I suggest you take your potion right now. Beware, it tastes like a combination of polyjuice potion and dragon shit."
L.C.R.
"I knew you didn't love me."
"Harry! She's my friend! and besides, you've been to Jane's funeral!"
Not even a month after Harry had died and Draco had gotten half of the parental rights on all 4 of Harry's children, Ginny had lost hers. They had a simple arrangement: the kids would be with Ginny during the first week, and with Draco during the second. And so they planned on continuing. Planned, because the first week, James, Albus, and Lily had arrived at the manor dirty, with a lot of hunger and with bruises everywhere. They obviously didn't want to tell why to Draco, as they didn't know him. It was eventually Scorpius who got it out of Albus, on the Sunday evening before they would leave. Scorpius immediately told Draco (after putting his clothes back on, that is) and Draco owled the ministry. Since the ministry workers worked really slow, even if it was an emergency, they had only come to check on the children that Wednesday, while the kids were with Ginny. The kids immediately got taken away there and brought back to the manor. Now Ginny and Senna had both been sentenced to Azkaban for life.
"Thank you, dad. I love you."
Draco snorted.
"Oh, Harry. I will miss you. I love you okay."
"I'm alright Al, how are you? And Lilly, James and Ted?"
"I'm fine Ron. I promise. Now leave me alone."
"Well, tell him that his wife is not going to listen to a death eater." Ginny's voice said.
=|•[#]•|=
"No shit Sherlock." Draco gave him a questioning look. "That's a muggle thing."
"And you haven't been sporting or dieting lately?"
Was written on the paper in handwriting that was way too neat to be Harry's. Draco guessed Granger, altho it was a bit messier than hers.
"I don't KNOW that. My boss told me the potion tastes like that. How do you know how polyjuice potion tastes?"
"Ma'am, only the people mentioned in his testament are invited." The person who read the paper said politely.
He'd never slept so long.
"In that case, how much did you eat since the symptoms?"
"Thank you for apologizing Draco. If you ever need someone to watch Scorpius, Teddy, Albus, James or Lily, just give us a call."
"I like you."
"See ya."
"Draco?"
"I thought Harry was my patient, not you."
"What's wrong Ginny?"
He held Harry's hand closely in his.
"Fine. I didn't want to be near someone of your sort anyways. See you Gin." She said.
=|•[#]•|=
"Who is it then?"
"Oh. How's Cissy doing?"
I love you.
"Scorpius knows too. We go to pride month every year."
"What? What's funny? MALFOY TELL ME WHAT HE SAID!" Ginevra said (calmly) upset.
"Potter." Malfoy said when he entered his office a week later. "Let's get straight (you sure 'bout that) immediately. You're sick."
"Really."
Harry's bad luck caught him again because when the week was over, he was possibly even more tired. He had also lost 2 kilo, which wasn't VERY surprising, as he hadn't left his bed all week and hadn't eaten more than a pancake Ginny made for him and a little biscuit. It had hurt a lot to swallow it, his oesophagus didn't seem to work properly.
Work was boring and exhausting. I know what you're thinking 'that's nothing new' of course. Work is like, ALWAYS boring and exhausting when you're the head-Auror who can only do paperwork and maybe go to the field like, once a month. But not THIS exhausting.
Harry's lips kept moving softly.
Hey y'all! It's me again.
"WE'RE NOT!" Harry shouted, using all his energy. He soon had another coughing fit.
"What would you like us to be?"
Monday morning. Harry woke up at 7 AM, incredibly tired as he had been the whole week. He went to the kitchen, where Ginny was waiting for him with a bowl of cereals. He kissed her, said a quick 'good morning' and took the bowl.
=|•[#]•|=
"Well, heal me then. That's your job ain't it."
"Harry, I'm sorry for when I was so stupid in our 4th year. Really. I was an idiot. You're my best mate. I love you."
I gift my invisibility cloak to Hermoine Granger.
"As good as possible."
"Of course, just like healer Hidgens wasn't going to tell them."
"Draco who?"
"Draco? In the muggle world, we have this thing called euthanasia. For people who are suffering so much with no end in sight. Do we have something similar to that in the muggle world?"
He did a quick fire-call with Ron to tell him he wouldn't come today, as he was tired. He went back to bed after a quick breakfast (where he found a little note from Ginny to let him know she'd called work to get him a day off)
"He's not a Malfoy. He and Narcissa have taken Narcissa's maiden name. They are nice people you know."
"Well, erm, I- erm I'm, going to work. Okay? Erm... Bye..."
"Ginny! You know how I feel about Senna. She's a bitch who thinks to be better than everyone because she's lesbian. And, knowing her, that whole cancer story is probably just made-up so she can cover up the fact she just divorced from Jane."
"I love you too Hermoine."
"I don't want you to die Harry, but, but I don't want you to suffer either. And y-you're right. I-it's n-not fair t-to let you s-suffer and k-keep you alive j-just b-because."
"Draco. You know that's a lie. I can feel it. I'm slowly becoming a plant Draco. I don't wanna die like a plant. I wanna be able to say goodbye to you, and to my family."
She didn't seem to believe him, but let it be.
"What are we?"
"Don't say that Harry. Please. You've got to keep hoping."
"What did you say Harry? I didn't quite understand." Senna said
It had been 3 months since the therapy started. Harry had gone backwards a lot. His vision got worse every day, and speaking out loud hurt so much, he barely did it. He has quit the Aurors and was now at the hospital fulltime. Ginny visited him every day, his kids once a week.
"Ready?" The healer said. Draco and Harry nodded.
"Harry! I'm so glad to see you dear!" She said, voice sweet as sugar, yet sharp and hurting like a knife.
=|•[#]•|=
I also want to clarify that I am not anti-Ginny, and that Ginny is only this way in this story for story purposses.
"Hey, dad." Lily said. Tears started forming in her eyes.
"Yes?"
"I'm doing good." He said, though it was almost impossible to hear it, Albus was one of the few people who could hear him. It wasn't like they couldn't hear him actually. They just didn't bother to listen good enough. The only ones that bothered enough to listen where Albus, Hermoine, Ron and Draco. It made harry sad to know that his own wife didn't even bother to hear him, while his school enemy did.
Lily made a small smile through her tears.
"Yes, Harry?"
Not even after the war, or his first time with Ginny, or after his 48 hours-long battle with McFengy, a Death Eather who believed that Voldemort would come back if he killed Harry, he'd slept so long. And he hadn't been tired.
Ron snorted.
"I- erm"
I gift the parental rights of Teddy Remus Lupin (which never belonged to Ginevra Weasley. The parental rights, that is) to my boyfriend Draco Lucius Black, in the hope Teddy will get to know his mother's side of the family better.
"Well, I'm sorry to hear that, but you're still gonna die." Draco said. "Look, Potter, I'm sorry. I can't change that. It is like it is, and not different."
"I will Moly, I promise."
"Draco."
"Are you alright dad?" Albus asked. Although Harry couldn't see enough to see his worried expression, he could hear it and it made him sad to know that such a young kid had to go through this much pain.
"Yeah, gimme just a second to finish this."
"Bye, dad."
"I am not sure if I should take that as a compliment, given how much you like Lukas."
"Aunt Luna told me she searches for someone to help her with her charity. He could help her?"
"I think you don't exactly understand what I mean. Muggles have a hard time healing it. And so do we. This is not a simple illness you can heal with a drop of potion."
"Draco?"
But, as it is with the best actors, one of the many layers in the eye doesn't want to listen to that mask. It is that layer that, deeply hidden, shows the real emotions. That layer is hard to find, and, mostly, only your loved ones can find it. And not just your good friends and the neighbour who you visit once a year to get your New-Year payment. No, those loved ones who know you better than you know yourself, who know when 'I'm fine' means 'I'm fine',  'ask one more time to show that you care' or 'I don't want to talk about it'. Who just, KNOW you. But, who love you even more than they know when you mean 'stay to show that you care', 'not the moment' or 'Go away' when you say 'go away.'
=|•[#]•|=
"Black of course! Who else? Don't act like you don't know him! The only thing you ever did in school was telling us he was 'up to something'"
"I wouldn't know, I don't drink that shit."
I gift my blank piece of parchment to Ron Weasley.
"They're planning on doing a 2-year road trip through America or Australia."
"but-"
The next time he woke up, he was a bit less tired and the clock said 7 AM. Somehow, he was still tired, so he told Ginny he'd stay home the whole week, which wasn't a problem since he was Head Auror and Ron would always be ready to take his place when he wasn't at work.
"I'll tell Lukas." Lily said. "And Draco." She added after seeing Harry's glare.
"Then I guess we're boyfriends"
"I'll tell Hermoine to bring Albus here Monday, he'll love to spend some more time with Scorpius."
"Monday it is."
"Yes, we just wanted to check on him, isn't it Gin?" Senna's 'I Am Better Than Everyone Else Cuz I'm Gay' voice said.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I love you too Ron."
"Can someone please explain what in the name of Merlin just happened?"
"Does Albus know? That you like boys?"
"Get out." Harry said. Not that she would put the effort into understanding him.
"Well, your father and I just got into a relationship, I guess." Draco explained to Albus.
"I have cancer. And I'm gonna die, Ginny." Harry said through his tears. Now Ginny had started crying too. And THAT is saying something. Ginny never cried. Not a lot, at least. The last time she cried was when- a few years after the war, when they got engaged. They went to tell George and-. They had found a note. One that said he couldn't handle it anymore, that he had to go. They had found a dead body, a knife in the neck and blood everywhere. It wasn't murder. It was suicide.
"Harry? I've got your sandwich." Ron's voice called from behind the door.
He didn't let go of Harry's hand. He couldn't. It felt like he would give up on Harry.
Draco took Harry's hand and gave it a gentle kiss.
I gift the rights to write my biography to Luna Lovegood, as she is the only one I trust to tell the tale as it should be told.
I want my fortune to be split into seven (7) parts. One (1) part for my son Teddy Remus Lupin. One (1) part for my son James Sirius Potter. One (1) part for my son Albus Severus Potter. One (1) part for my daughter Lily Luna Potter. One (1) part for my boyfriend Draco Lucius Black. One (1) part for Luna Lovegood's charity for children who don't have a safe home to return to. And one (1) part to Harry Potter's charity for LGBTQ+ wizards.
"I- It's just. I- I- I- I'm gonna die Ginny." Harry managed to get out.
He chose to not think about it too much, and go to work tomorrow.
Harry's lips moving against his own lazily.
X X X
"I understand. But I want to be alone with Draco."
"To see if there's anything in there except for water."
Draco was kissing a dead man.
"Harry? Has it something to do with your diagnose? You know you can tell me anything right?"
"Draco!"
"I will. I promise."
"Yes, Lily. You look gorgeous. Lukas is going to love your dress."
"You shouldn't eat from the choco mouse, I heard Al and Scorp tell Fred and George II to put Weasley's Wizard Wheezes products in it." Harry said.
"Shhh, don't say that you're not gonna die."
"I used some of it during the war."
Harry blushed slightly. "Boyfriends."
Harry had NEVER thought of that, and he had NEVER thought of thinking about that. He just didn't care how fucking good Draco would look while smiling.
"Scorp and Al are still there."
"What do you mean?"
"ALBUS!"  A young boy's voice said as soon as Albus had opened the door.
"I used to tell him 'Daddy finds girls and boys attractive, but he finds mommy the most attractive of all.' That's not true anymore."
"CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHY I WASN'T INVITED TO THIS? I'M HIS FUCKING WIFE YOU KNOW!" The weaselette stormed inside.
12 HOURS
Meanwhile, Harry was trying to eat, but, as it had been the whole week, it hurt to swallow, and some of the food stayed in his oesophagus for too long. He tried his best to not let Ginny notice, but she looked at him worriedly.
"I love you to Lil. Although I got to say Draco was right about the dress. You look like you're gonna wear that for your wedding night too."
"Who did you bring?" He said, knowing that Ginny wouldn't bother to hear him anyways. Luckily Hermoine did, cuz she answered.
I hope you have a wonderfull day and enjoy the story.
"Come in." Draco said. "Ah, Potter. I think you broke your record 'not needing to go to the hospital'. It's been a long time since you've been here, isn't it? You've probably got withdrawal problems."
"Harry? Are there any other complains you have?"
"That's great. Now, i'll have to go. See you Monday?"
"I love you Draco."
"She- she- she kissed that bitch." Hermoine said, in shock. "Ginny kissed SENNA! She cheated on you Harry!"
"Tell Draco I love him."
"Hello Harry!" Ginny's voice said as she entered his hospital room. Harry could just smell that she had brought other people with her, people who normally didn't visit.
Hey y'all!
Lily chuckled.
"Stop joking. Just give me the potion already so I can get to work."
"Why would the healer say so then?"
Draco started crying again. How was he supposed to find someone just as beautiful and loving and amazing as Harry?
"God, Harry, I just don't want you to go to work. I see that you're not alright. I just, I don't feel good about this. Remember when I told that Senna's wife was more exhausted than normal and loosed a lot of weight? She also said it hurt to swallow, and sweetheart, I see you have that too."
Harry Potter.
The Daily Prophet didn't know about the whole thing yet, and Harry was planning on keeping it that way.
"Am I going to die a plant?" Harry asked.
He took Harry's hand and pressed a gentle kiss against it.
Draco leaned in to kiss Harry softly.
When he visited, the boys talked a lot. Mostly Draco tho. He talked about his son, Scorpius a lot. He and Albus seemed pretty close, and Harry could only be grateful for that.
"Yeah. 5 pounds."
"That'd be great."
The hand fell open and something rolled out of it.
"Hey, Lil."
A kissing sound was heard. Followed by two gasps and multiple shoes shuffling towards the door.
The room was small, with a one-person bed in the middle of the room, against the only window. The view from the window was breathtaking. Simple, But breathtakingly beautiful. There was a nightstand with a little plant on it. There was a little closet, not too big, but big enough to be a good hiding place for Albus, Lilly and James to play hide and seek. The walls were blue and white.
"I- tell her that we're over."
Harry may not be physical with them, he would never leave their hearts.
"But they're not Harry's friends. Who says he wants them here?" Hermoine said, clearly annoyed.
"Why doesn't he give more to you guys?" Draco said, turning to G̶r̶a̶n̶g̶e̶r̶ Hermoine and W̶e̶a̶s̶l̶e̶y̶  Ron.
He was late for work.
"I like you."
He took the stone in his hand, closed his eyes, and did as the paper instructed.
"Get the fuck outta here." Harry said. Only one person in the room put enough effort in listening to hear him.
"I love you Lil. Bye."
Harry woke up, feeling tired again immediately. He looked at the clock. When he was expecting to see something like, I don't know, 4 AM, but, that's not what he saw. He saw 10 AM. It was 10 AM.
"Harry are you sure? I mean, I get that she cheated on you, but isn't that a bit impulsive?"
Which was ridiculous by the way. New Year's ever was a week ago and he'd gone to bed really early. Now he thought about it, he'd slept 12 hours.
At the other side of the door, lily was turning the stone 3 times, thinking of her dad.
I gift my photo album with photos of my parents to myself, to be buried with me.
"Thanks Ron. I'm sorry for shouting at you earlier."
HAPPY NEW YEAR!"  The crowd shouted as one man.
"Oh,” Hadrian frowned in thought, “Since Dumbles thinks I requested Sanctuary already, should I actually do it?"
Sunday, 12/21
“Now, for the fun part,” Harry grinned, pulling out packages of tinsel in red, green, silver, gold, blue, and a final pack that started out white but Harry charmed black so that all the Hogwarts houses were represented.
"This is the Chamber of Secrets," he whispered and Draco nodded.
“You’ll do whatever I say for twelve hours?” he asked, and Draco nodded, “Okay, then I claim my twelve hours first; as part of it, you have to come to the Burrow with me tomorrow.” Harry grinned when Draco scowled at him.
“It will,” Draco interrupted, “All we have to do is focus, and The Ritual will do exactly what we want it to. I have all the materials we need-” Draco pulled a box out of his robes “-so all we have to do is decide who is going to take which position once we set up.”
"Shh!" Draco shushed him as the next memory started, showing Tom sitting in a dark room with the same students from before, all of them looking very solemn.
Hadrian awoke early the next morning wrapped in Draco's arms as usual, and snuggled in closer to the blond, smiling when he felt a soft kiss on the top of his head. Hadrian lifted his head to kiss Draco on the cheek, and then slipped out of the blond's embrace and headed to the bathroom for a shower.
“You are keeping the children out of this?” Narcissa nodded, and Augusta shook her head in disappointment, “Well, I can’t tell you what to do with Draco, however it would be better to keep them informed; the boys are nearly adults, and they won’t appreciate being excluded. However, I will abide by your wishes and keep your plans secret from Neville as well; at least for the time being.”
“Wonderful,” Narcissa smiled, “Shall we do presents then? I had Frost collect your gifts for you, Harry.” Narcissa didn’t wait for a reply, but rang a small silver bell sitting on the table next to her chair. A few seconds later, three imps arrived with the presents; each deposited their armload of gifts in front of the correct person.
"Draco can help as well, now that you mention it," Severus mused, "He can at least help with Arithmancy. That reminds me-during this summer we will be seeing to your education to get you up to the level you should be at, and you will learn-at the very least-the basics of Arithmancy and Runes; if you were planning to take Care of Magical Creatures or Divination again you can forget it."
"Well, you had better hurry then," Draco smirked and shot directly towards Hadrian, forcing the smaller boy to roll over in midair; when he righted himself again Hadrian saw that Draco was chasing after the snitch and he hurried to catch up.
"That's not why I'm embarrassed!" Hadrian protested, "It's just that normal people do not strut around others without clothing on, prat."
“Oh,” Harry said quietly, then gave Draco a grin, “If that was a proposal, you suck. I mean, the words were nice and all, but you kinda forgot the ring, and you never actually asked.”
"It is considered a joke," Draco scowled, then brightened as a thought occurred to him, "Why? Did you want me to be flirting with you? Because I have better pick-up lines. For example: Baby, you've got me wrapped around your finger tighter than Devil's Snare. Or: I don't need to look into the Mirror of Erised to know that you're the only thing I desire. How about: Is that a wand in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me? And then there's the classic: Want a ride on my broomstick?"
“Can Dobby be doing anything else for Harry Potter?”
Hadrian looked over at the bed and saw that Draco was beginning to stir, his arms reaching out for something that wasn’t there. After a moment, the Veela sat up, looking around in confusion.
"If she's as smart as you say she won't stop being your friend just because she's in a different house," Lucius placated the younger boy, "In fact, she will probably need you more than ever. Oh, by the way Severus, this is my friend Tom Riddle; Tom, this is Severus Snape-we've been friends since we were little."
“You should take a nap,” he says, “Because I have every intention of wearing you out again later-multiple times.”
“You wanted to see me, Mrs. Malfoy?” Harry stood hesitantly at the door to Narcissa’s study, nervously playing with the hem of his shirt-one of the many new articles of clothing the Malfoy’s had given him.
“I know,” Ginny agreed, popping the other half of her chocolate in her mouth, “This is the best chocolate I’ve ever had!”
“My aunt and uncle always signed Santa’s name to presents for my cousin,” Harry said.
“I have a potion for that,” Draco withdrew a silver vial from his pocket, “I will make sure you are well-prepared when the time comes.” He looked up at the sky, and saw that the edge of the moon was just visible in the clearing. “Speaking of time, are you ready to begin? We need to have the ritual completed before the moon reaches its zenith.”
"Can we talk about why I ran away later?" Harry asked, "And I don't think you poisoned it I just...I don't feel very hungry." He took another bit of the apple and felt a wave of nausea break over him as the welts on his back began to burn; Harry closed his eyes and grasped the edge of the table, forcing himself to breathe evenly as the pain increased.
“That’s all I can ask,” Draco said, gesturing to the fireplace, “Shall we?”
“Yes, Master!” Wispy vanished with a pop, only to reappear moments later, disoriented.
“What’s the matter, Big D?” Harry spat, “Can’t take me without your lackeys to hold me down?”
“There,” Draco says breathlessly, taking a step back, “Now there won’t be any accidents, and the plug is pure magic, so there is no chance of injury from it.”
“We won’t be able to fix everything,” Narcissa agreed, “The lives he took…those we will never be able to get back. As for the rest…Severus has a list.” She shared a mischievous smile with Lily before the red-head started giggling.
“We have no plans to confront Dumbledore yet,” Narcissa replied calmly, as she snapped her fingers; Wispy appeared with a bow and then vanished with the pensieve; “We know that it would be reckless to do so. First, we are focusing on healing the damage done to Tom, as well as researching a way to heal the mind-damage Dumbledore caused to others.”
“On the bed love,” Draco commanded, “Knickers off. You can take the heels off or keep them on, your choice.” Draco watched as Harry pulled the lace panties off and threw them on the floor, then crawled on the bed, facing the headboard on his hands and knees. Draco smacked his upturned ass, and Harry moaned. “Not like that,” Draco corrected, “On your back. I want to see your face tonight.”
“Thank you, Harry,” Daphne giggled, “And you look very handsome. Oh, and Harry? Don’t worry; I won’t tell anyone you spent most of the night watching Draco.” Harry flushed, but they had reached the dance floor now and he couldn’t respond. “I mean it,” Daphne whispered as they joined the dance, “I won’t tell anyone; you deserve the chance to work things out for yourself.”
December 15
"It was Ronald Weasley," Narcissa replied as she and Draco directed Hadrian to sit in a chair, "It seems that he, along with Hermione Granger and Ginerva Weasley, came upon Hadrian and Draco while they were waiting for me and Mr. Weasley decided to attack Hadrian."
"Wh-what happened?" the brunette asked, "Where am I?"
“There is a specialized surveillance team that monitors Muggle children. We use toys-for example, some of last years toys have surveillance spells on them. Before you say anything, we only monitor behavior; the charm doesn’t show video or anything like that, it just sends updates about whether the child that owns the toy has been naughty or nice. Recently, the Elf on the Shelf toy has been used to monitor the children’s behavior.”
"This behavior is highly inappropriate," Tom protested, "You can't tell me you approve of this!"
"Why do you care so much?" Harry asked curiously, turning his head a bit, this time dislodging the fingers that had still been combing through his dark locks, "We just found out we were evidently friends as children, but we spent the last six years hating each other."
"It's not my fault you get embarrassed so easily," Draco replied, "Although, you do look cute when your face is all flushed."
Once Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy left, Madame Pomfrey demanded that the two boys rest, and then left them alone in the darkened infirmary.
“What do you mean, Santa Clause doesn’t exist?” Draco asked, brow furrowed in confusion, “Did you really think that all the gifts from Santa were actually given by your relatives? I can understand if you believed that before Hogwarts, as there is a type of Confundus cast on presents left in households with Muggle parents, but you should have been told the truth once you started Hogwarts.”
"If you do well during the week then you will have your weekends free," Lucius replied, "and you will have more time to yourselves once you complete your schoolwork."
“That’s right,” Hadrian said softly, “You didn’t have a choice in this, did you? If you did, I know you wouldn’t have picked me.” He gasped when Draco pushed him down on the bed and leaned over him, catching his gaze with his mesmerizing silver-blue eyes.
“They will pay,” Draco growled softly, pulling the drawing off the wall and folding it before carefully placing it in his pocket, “Once I have Hadrian safe with me again, I will return to make them pay for everything they have ever done.” Narcissa said nothing as she stepped back and allowed her son to close the cupboard door; she merely waited until he was ready, and then followed him upstairs. They checked the first three bedrooms they came across, and then they came to a door with locks on the outside, and a strange hole cut in the bottom of the door. Upon entering the room, it became apparent that this was where Hadrian spent his summers. There were owl feathers on the floor, a pair of broken glasses lay next to the tiny bed, and a quill lay forgotten on the desk. Still, Hadrian was nowhere to be found.
"Eventually," Draco replied nonchalantly, "As I explained earlier the collar helps to keep you safe; when we find something else that works similarly then I will consider removing the collar.” The blond quickly changed the subject before Hadrian could argue, “You know, maybe we should see if we can track down your mother's family; Dumbledore changed people's memories, but there should be a record of her family in the wizarding library off Diagon Alley."
Perhaps his friends were more observant than they let on
While Harry and Draco had been getting to know each other better, Ginny had come to Harry saying that she wanted to have one more child, and that, since she wasn't involved with anyone else, she wanted Harry to father the baby. Harry had nearly refused, not wanting to ruin his fledgling relationship with Draco, but the blond himself had offered a solution-the magical version of artificial insemination, which involved Harry getting his seed inside a potion that was then spelled into Ginny at the appropriate time. Nine months later, Lily was born and Ginny decided to be a sports reporter instead of continuing to fly.
"I'm sure they know why he's really here," Blaise said, "They probably just think that they can corrupt him; so, is it working Chosen One? Has Draco corrupted you yet?"
Draco stood and allowed his mother to lead him out of the library. When she led him upstairs to the family wing, he became curious; was the gift in his room? But Mother had made it seem like he was only allowed to see the gift tonight, and that he would not be able to actually have it until the morning. His mother stopped in front of his room-no, she stopped in front of the door to the empty suite across from his room, and Draco’s curiosity increased.
"We can talk to the twins’ tomorrow," Hadrian said, "They opened their new shop in Diagon Alley and I'm sure they will be there; we just need to avoid the rest of the Weasley's. By the way, when are you going to remove this stupid collar?"
"How can you accuse us of using you?" Ginny demanded, looking hurt, "He's a Death Eater Harry! He's only pretending to help you so that he can turn you over to Voldemort! Even if Dumbledore was doing as you said, you still should have come to us for help; why don't you trust us Harry?" Hadrian focused on Ginny, ignoring the other two for a moment, and saw hurt in her brown eyes.
“Well now, that wasn’t very polite,” Draco chastised, pinching his nipple, “You should know rude boys don’t get what they want. You didn’t even say please.” Harry groaned again, glaring at Draco. The blond just arched an eyebrow, lifting his pelvis up so that Harry wasn’t getting any contact.
"I’m going to just head up to my room," Hadrian replied, "I want to at least look at our summer assignments, so I can see how hard they’ll be to complete. I’ll wait for you to get back before I open the box I took from the Muggles; I’m a little afraid of what I’ll find in there.”
"See something you like?" he teased as he walked towards the other boy, "I must say Hadrian, you look good in my clothes, even if they are a little big on you; let me fix that." With a wave of his wand the black trousers and green shirt were re-sized to fit Hadrian, and Draco took his hand, pulling him towards the bed, "Okay; nap time."
“He’s ruining them,” Draco grumbled, sliding in beside Harry, “He’s lucky I have to get new ones this year anyway.”
Draco chuckled, then slowly slid out, before slamming back in; he kept to this pace, loving the way the slow withdrawal made Harry whimper, while the hard slam drew a cry from the brunet’s lips. He tried different angles, enjoying the way the cries changed slightly each time, until he managed to find that spot that had Harry closing his eyes and throwing his head back with a scream. Having found the right angle, Draco increased the speed of his thrusts, making Harry writhe and scream beneath him. Draco felt his balls tightening, and reached down to wrap a hand around Harry’s erection, only to note with surprise that his lover had already beat him to it.
“Color?” Draco asks, and Harry scowls, earning a smirk in return; he really wants to complain, and convince Draco to take him home, but he can’t like to him-he won’t lie to him.
"You, are a pointy-faced ferret," Harry informed his husband, even as he accepted Draco's help in standing.
“I’ve thought about it,” Draco looked up to see Harry sitting on the couch, nervously clutching a book, “After you went to bed, I couldn’t stop thinking about what you said. I wish-but I guess it doesn’t matter what I wish. Did you really mean everything you said?”
"I agree with you," Augusta said after some time, and her son and daughter-in-law nodded, "We will join your cause to improve the lives of wizarding children and support you in the ministry. Now, the real problem is dealing with Dumbledore."
"Well, for now we just need to keep this quiet," Hadrian replied, casually returning the embrace; it would feel weird with anyone else, but with Luna Hadrian was surprisingly comfortable, "We can't let Dumbledore find out that we know the truth until…well, I'm not sure exactly, but I would guess that we need to keep it a secret until Tom gets his soul back. Nev-we're looking into ways to restore Bellatrix to sanity, and I promise we will also do what we can to help your parents. Severus has a set of books written by some descendants of Godric Gryffindor and Rowena Ravenclaw which have information on Horcruxes, and there may be other useful information in them, but a lot of it is in Parsletongue so only Tom and I can read it."
Harry felt magic swirling around them, and he leaned forward, resting his upper body on the ground. He felt exposed, and took several deep breaths to calm himself. He felt Draco’s warmth as the blond settled behind him, but he still startled when Draco skimmed his hands up his, Harry’s sides, before settling on his ass. Draco took a few minutes to massage the mounds of flesh until Harry relaxed slightly, and then he pried Harry’s cheeks apart to press his thumb against the furled hole. Harry closed his eyes, focusing on his breathing; he had done this himself when wanking, but only a finger or two, and he was nervous.
“You too, Miss Greengrass,” Harry replied, then turned his attention to the next customer, forcing himself to pay attention to what he was doing, instead of wondering at Greengrass’s visit.
“Wow, they really put a lot of work into this,” Hadrian said, clearly impressed, “I’ll have to spend some time trying to figure out what my Animagus name should be, but everything else is amazing. This could definitely be helpful, since I now have Dumbledore after me.” Hadrian paused and tilted his head as a thought occurred to him, “Funny, how I was in danger from “Voldemort” for my whole life and no one ever thought to give me protection like this, isn’t it? Thank you, Dray.” He gave Draco another brief kiss before turning and taking a few steps away; “So…now what? I was working on my homework earlier, but I really don’t feel like messing with it anymore today; I’ll have enough of that next week.”
Lucius looked over at his son and saw that Draco was shaking, hands clenched into fists and blood dripping from where his talons had punctured his skin. Lucius quickly considered their options, and decided the best route would be to get Draco focused on finding Hadrian.
Draco lay there for about an hour, unable to sleep, worry for Hadrian keeping him awake. He groaned and started to sit up, but Arden climbed on top of his chest, keeping Draco from moving. After a moment, Draco became aware of a soft sound coming from Arden; it sounded like someone singing in a foreign language. The sound had Draco relaxing almost against his will, and he had just a moment to notice a pale glow surrounding the dragon, before sleep rose up to claim him.
"I believe you can go through the board of governors," Draco replied, "Just tell them that you don't feel comfortable in Gryffindor any longer; there is a book somewhere that tells the requirements which need to be met in order for you to be granted a re-sorting; I'm sure our parents will take care of it though." Draco maneuvered himself so that he was lying closer to Hadrian, their arms just a hairsbreadth away from touching.
The sled was elegant, with just enough room for one person to recline comfortably; two people could possibly fit in it, if they didn’t mind sitting close together. The sleigh was, as Harry had already noticed, a shining silver encrusted with pale blue gems. It was pulled by six pure white reindeer wearing pale blue harnesses with silver bells. The sleigh was driven by a small creature-it was about an inch or so shorter than a House Elf-with snow-white skin and silver hair, wearing clothes in different shades of blue.
Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Dean joined the group in the Great Hall for supper, and no one even looked twice at the lone Ravenclaw sitting beside Harry at the middle of the Gryffindor table. Supper itself was rather uneventful, until just before the deserts appeared.
"I, Draco Malfoy, Heir of the Most Ancient and Noble House of Malfoy, grant Hadrian Riddle Sanctuary," Draco replied formally, and Hadrian clasped the outstretched hand, "For so long as you require, House Malfoy will protect you from enemies to the best of our abilities, both inside and outside these walls. In return, we ask that you do not cause harm to the members and guests of House Malfoy, unless in self- defense, and that you offer your wand if trouble arises during your stay.” There was a pause as Draco gave him a sly look before adding, “Now we seal it with a kiss." He leaned forward to kiss Hadrian but the brunet pulled away glaring.
“This is so weird,” Harry shook his head, barely even noticing when Draco wrapped long fingers around his wrist and led him to his bedroom. Harry went to the bathroom and changed into a pair of black pajamas, then climbed into bed and pulled up the comforter. He watched Draco warily, but the blond simply sat on the edge of the bed and then leaned over to press a quick kiss to his forehead. They both waited a few seconds, but nothing happened.
“What do you mean broken bones?” Harry demanded, “All he did was-”
"I have two months' worth," Severus replied, "I would recommend leaving half of the bottles here so that you will always have access to the potion; I also made a copy of the instructions which I would like to leave in your potions lab Luca."
“One thing you should know however,” Hadrian cut in, “If I have my way, Dumbledore will suffer for what he has done, and then he will die."
“We should have spelled him to sleep until at least eight,” Draco grumbled, even as he climbed into bed with Harry. They lay down with Harry’s head on Draco’s shoulder, and the warm comforter pulled up to their chins. “I can’t believe I’ve been off work for a whole five days and we haven’t had sex once,” Draco pouted, “You’ve kept us so busy getting ready for Christmas that we haven’t had any time to relax.”
"Maybe…if I talk to Tom alone he'll let me see them," Hadrian mused, "It's worth a shot, right?"
"Not yours," Hadrian said breathlessly, emerald eyes wide as Draco leaned closer, "Draco-"
“I have another half hour left on this potion,” Severus announced, “Once it is done I will check back in with Dumbledore; I have a potion that will mimic the after-effects of the Cruciatus which should be enough to convince him that you are still evil, and I am still on his side.”
“I’m not short!” Harry glared at the blond, “And if you’re not careful, you may find yourself trying a Wronski Feint without a broom!” The two boys bickered for a few more minutes, until Sirius told them they had to get going. Their trunks were shrunken down and put in their pockets-their owls had flown home the previous night-and then Draco climbed into the side car, and Harry sat in between his legs.
“Of course he does, Harry,” Ginny gave him a worried look, “The children get presents from him every year. Remember last year? The training wand for James and the flying dragon toy for Albus?” She looked fondly down at the two-year-old girl sleeping in her arms and added, “Lily got that unicorn plushie.”
After a few moments Dudley came back to stand in front of Harry, and the evil glint in those watery blue eyes filled him with dread. He was determined not to show it however, so Harry merely glared at the boy in front of him, before turning his head to the side in an obvious dismissal. He wanted to grin when he heard Dudley growl in annoyance, but then the first blow landed on his side, followed by another on his back and three to his face. After that, Harry soon lost count of the number of times he was struck, and instead found himself praying for blessed darkness.
Draco hummed and cast a few spells to verify the safety of the package, and when they came back clean he shrugged and ripped the paper off. Once opened, the box inside expanded, and he opened the lid to find a large selection of pranks and spells from the twins’ shop, along with a smaller, shiny black box. There was a note attached to the black box, so Draco read that first.
After the intense vibrations from before Harry would have thought this lighter setting would be too gentle for him to even notice, but the way he was sitting pushed the plug right up against his prostate, providing constant stimulation. Harry rocked a little, and was surprised when he was actually able to move; the sticking charm had run out! Instead of standing up, Harry used his new found freedom to position himself more firmly on the stool as he rocked against the plug. After a few minutes the vibrations stopped and Harry stood up, happy to be able to stretch out his back and relax his arms a little, even though his feet began to hurt almost immediately.
“I nearly lost you,” Draco whispered when they finally separated, “And I never even got to tell you I love you.”
Harry lets Draco maneuver him onto the bed. He leans against the pillows, watching as Draco undresses, revealing skin nearly as pale as the snow outside; in the moonlight, Draco seems to glow.
"No need," Severus said as he entered the room, "The meeting with Dumbledore didn't take as long as I expected; were you planning to relocate this meeting?"
"I'll go," George offered, "You want a disguise? We have some polyjuice potion so you can be Fred."
“You can fit through the window, though,” Hadrian said, “You can climb down and-what? Why not?” Dobby was shaking his head frantically.
Only then could they leave the wards set by their friends
"Why in the world would you be tired?" Draco asked sarcastically, “It isn’t as if you spent the morning as a tiger, before being returned to your human form, fainted from blood loss and had to be healed, viewed memories that changed everything you thought you knew about yourself, met your father and reversed a blood adoption…oh wait; you did do all of that.”
When he saw that Harry was comfortable in his animal form, Dobby placed a hand on his collar and apparated them to a forest.
"I have no idea," Tom said, "but we need to keep an eye on him; I still can't believe Dumbledore talked the headmaster out of expelling-or at least suspending-Peter. If Sirius and James hadn't gone after Sev he would probably be dead by now. I'm working on something to pay Pettigrew back though, don't worry." They were silent for a moment, and Tom cleared his throat nervously before speaking up again. "Elena? I was wondering if you would come with me next Hogsmeade weekend; on a date?" Elena's smile was dazzling when she replied;
“Hmm, I’ll hold you to that promise,” Draco said, tucking Harry’s head under his chin. Harry, who had woken up at dawn to make sure everything was ready for their guests, fell asleep after a few minutes of silence. Draco found himself thinking back over the past few days, and he had to admit that there was a certain charm to doing some things the Muggle way. He didn’t think he would want to do a fully Muggle Christmas again, but it might be nice to keep some of things they had done. He’d like for Teddy and Harry to make more Christmas decorations, and they could decorate a gingerbread village every year. Even decorating the tree without magic had been kind of fun, but Draco thought it would be easier to decorate a slightly smaller tree-maybe eight or nine feet instead of fifteen. Maybe next year they could even have two trees; they could decorate one with magic, and one without. Harry and Draco would be married by next Christmas, so maybe they could start their own traditions with Teddy…
"Well, maybe I'll just bite you back," Draco purred, rubbing his nose in the soft hair behind Hadrian's ear and smirking when the other boy shivered, "Then again, maybe you'd like that, hmmm?"
“Liar,” Draco accused as he entered Hadrian’s room and shut the door behind him, “I could sense you were awake as well.” Draco climbed into the bed and lay down facing Hadrian, then immediately pulled the brunet into his arms. The blond gave a soft, happy sigh and nuzzled the back of Hadrian’s neck. “This is much better,” Draco murmured. Hadrian hummed his agreement, suddenly feeling tired again. Within moments, both boys were fast asleep.
“I found several books that could be relevant,” Draco nodded his agreement, “Do you want to eat first?” Harry shook his head.
"Well, you know how our parents had the Order of the Black Rose?" Draco continued after the twins nodded, "They intend to start it up again, however they refuse to allow us to be part of it, so we decided to start our own group to fight against Dumbledore."
"Gee, love you too Sev," Hadrian said drily, "I can't believe Hermione and Ginny just stood there and watched Ron beat the shit out of me!"
“What? No!” Hadrian protested, fighting off a blush, “I just-I don't want Luna getting hurt. And Draco shouldn't be flirting with her if he’s gay. Why would you think I’m gay? I had that crush on Cho, remember? We even went on a date!”
The image around them swirled briefly, before settling on the great hall during the Sorting Ceremony once more; a slightly older Tom-perhaps in second year-was welcoming a new Slytherin to the table.
Jingle.
“It seems I have no other choice,” Draco agreed, “I’ll see you soon, Love.” Draco briefly touched Harry’s cheek, then turned and left the alcove. As the blond walked away, Harry heard him ask:
"Does this mean I get to pick out my own clothes after I shower?" Hadrian asked, trying to dispel the tension in the Veela's stance.
"He's buying all twenty; I think that deserves a discount-twelve galleons," George countered.
"Tillie!" Hadrian called, taking hold of Draco's arm as the house elf appeared; "Bedroom; now!" Tillie apparently understood, for she quickly Apparated the boys to Draco's room. "Ward it so that no one can enter or leave until I call for you, and tell Narcissa and Lucius that I will let them know what's going on as soon as I can." Hadrian fought to stay calm even as he heard Draco's growl and felt clawed hands wrap around his upper arms; "Go! Now!" Tillie gave a frightened squeak, and Hadrian felt strong magic wash over the room as she disappeared. He didn't have time to think on it however, for Draco used his grip to spin the brunet around and push him forcefully up against the wall. Draco leaned in close and sniffed Hadrian for a moment before growling lowly and meeting wide green eyes with cold grey.
“Mr. Weasley?” Hadrian pushed to his feet and took a few steps back, keeping his wand pointed at Ron’s father, “What-why did you kidnap me?” Hadrian looked around as much as he could, while still making sure to keep Arthur in his line of sight; it appeared he was in the shed where Arthur kept all of his Muggle things. The door was straight ahead, behind where Arthur was standing.
"Having a mate," Draco all but whispered, looking down for a moment before meeting Fred's gaze, "I-we believe that Hadrian is my mate; ever since I found him so badly beaten in our gardens I have felt like I need to protect him, and I have felt irrational surges of jealousy. I suppose I have liked Hadrian for some time now, although I only noticed it recently, but he seems to be dead-set against giving me a chance; he won't even kiss me." Draco pouted and then glared at Fred; "I almost got a kiss from him, but then you and your obnoxious brother had to ruin it."
"I believe we will work on Bella first," Tom said thoughtfully, "Correcting the damage inflicted by Dumbledore will be difficult, especially not knowing exactly what was done to them.”
After several minutes, Potter stepped out of his heels, and Draco watched, riveted, as the other boy sank down onto the dildo, only to gasp and suddenly stand back up; the small pained gasp Potter emitted went straight to Draco’s cock, and the blond groaned as he increased the speed of his strokes.  After a few seconds, Potter began to slowly lower himself on the dildo again, and his next gasp tipped Draco over the edge, drowning him in a sea of white.
"Because Hadrian ran away from his relatives and somehow found his way here," Lucius smirked, "It seems a lot happened while our son was here by himself, but I will tell you what I know. Evidently the Muggles did give Hadrian the potion to bind his powers and beat him severely, but Hadrian managed to get a hold of the pain relief and healing potions. He called for Dobby-you will remember the elf always liked Potter-who helped him escape. Dobby gave Hadrian a collar to turn him into his animagus form, shrank Hadrian's belongings, and brought him to the woods just beyond our wards, where Hadrian spent the night in a tree.
A few minutes later, Hadrian and Draco arrived at the top of the staircase, where they found Severus waiting for them. The Potions Master cast a privacy ward before speaking.
“What are you talking about, Potter?” He demanded, “It’s obvious I won; I made thirty Galleons more than you.”
"Not likely," Draco replied, "Coming into my Veela inheritance is supposed to be physically draining, so I expect mother to let us sleep in for a bit; she will likely wake us a couple of hours before the party starts so that we can get ready. And yes-you will be allowed to sleep in as well; it would not be a good idea for me to wake up the day after getting my inheritance to find you not in the room." Draco changed his position so that he was leaning against the wall with one leg on the window seat and the other one on the Floor; he looked at Hadrian expectantly and the brunet shook his head and rolled his eyes before sliding back so that he was leaning against Draco, his back to the blonde's chest and both of his legs pulled up on the window seat.
“Yes, Mistress,” Dobby bowed, “Dobby is waiting.”
“Yes, Aunt Petunia,” Harry replied. He found an outfit that had belonged to Dudley-a pair of worn jeans and an old t-shirt-in the cupboard, and he quickly changed, wincing as he pulled the scraps of fabric away from the wounds on his back.
It wasn’t until later that night, after they ate supper, that Harry came across information on the bond that he thought could be useful. The information was in an old book that seemed to be held together with nothing but magic, and the text was written in Latin. According to the book, the ritual could only be successful if the individuals participating in it were able to put aside all of their past animosity. If there were too many negative feelings, the ritual would fail.
place. I’ll get back to you on that. Oh! I almost forgot!” Ginny turned to Harry, “Luna said to go home; she’ll make sure everything’s locked up.”
“Potter,” Harry looked up from the coffee had been brewing with a smile, only to stare in shock at the blonde in front of him.
"There are very complex reasons as to why we are unable to alter the taste of potions," Severus began, "but I would hardly expect you to understand, so I will not waste my time explaining it to you. Now, lie still so I can run a scan and make sure you are healed. You'll need to move Draco." Draco stood up and Severus waved his wand over Harry's body; Harry was encased in a pale blue light and Severus nodded in satisfaction once it faded. "Well, you are perfectly healthy-physically at least; I can in no way vouch for your mental health."
Harry crossed over to the dressing room and found some skimpy clothes. He looked at the outfit doubtfully but decided he could at least try it on. As he closed slipped his tunic off, Harry heard the office door open followed by the soft murmurs of conversation.
“Wha-?” Draco leant in and pressed their lips together in a passionate kiss, nibbling and licking as he sought entrance to Hadrian’s mouth. When Hadrian parted his lips Draco eagerly lapped at the warm cavern, teasing Hadrian’s tongue with his own. He kept one hand tangled in the other boys dark locks, and trailed the other one down so that he could caress Hadrian’s chest beneath his shirt. Hadrian moaned into the kiss, involuntarily thrusting upwards when Draco flicked his nipple. When Hadrian felt Draco’s erection through their combined layers of clothing he thought about stopping, but instead found his hands clutching tightly to Draco’s waist as he rutted against the Veela.
"No," Draco spoke calmly, but then he let out a low growl as he leaned in until his face was just centimeters from Hadrian's; "You let her touch you, after I specifically warned you against letting anyone get too close. I think I need to show everyone just who you belong to."
"Yes," Severus nodded, "however I feel that you will need your privacy, therefore I will go to my rooms and return in about an hour." He gave a brief nod to his friends and then left the sitting room; his rooms were just a few doors away as they had been given to him when his godson was still young.
“You mean like Purebloods and Half-bloods and Muggleborns?” Harry questioned.
"Very well," he agreed, "I will spare your lives, if you agree to leave and have your memories altered."
It took three and a half hours to view all of the memories, and when he reemerged for the last time he was pale and shaking with disbelief, the only thought going through his mind was Albus lied. Dumbledore-' for he lost every shred of respect he’d ever had for the man- ‘Dumbledore lied.’ The venerable headmaster had been lying to everyone for years, manipulating them and even changing their memories; Albus Dumbledore had betrayed them all in every way imaginable, and he, Severus, was the only one who knew about it.
It was strange, Hadrian mused, to find himself sitting in Draco Malfoy's bedroom and feeling completely safe and content; just twenty-four hours ago the boys had been rivals, and now they were fast on the way to becoming good friends. More, if Neville was right.
"Whose real name is Tom," Blaise supplied helpfully.
Of course, the warming charm wasn’t the only thing Harry’s lover placed on him before they left their shared flat, hence the blush. The sound of bells is soft enough, though, that his friends probably can’t even hear them. Even if they did, bells are ringing in multiple places throughout the festival site. Harry shifts again, dodging a pair of kids chasing each other through the snow, and has to bite back a gasp as another soft jingle sounds. Harry wants desperately to go home and have the bells removed, but he’s only been at the festival for five minutes; his lover hasn’t even arrived yet, having needed to stop by his parents’ house before joining Harry.
His response to Pansy was first, just a short note assuring her of his safety and apologizing for not being there when she needed him. Aside from Fourth Year, when Draco was still unsure about his sexuality, he had always viewed Pansy as a sister, and he would have never forgive himself if something happened to her. He also advised Pansy that she needed to make a decision on her future-if she was going to follow the Dark Lord she would have no choice but to follow through with his plans for her over the holidays. If, however, she didn’t want any part of it, he advised her to have her House Elf take her to Hogwarts, where she could ask the headmaster for sanctuary. That done, he began the letter to his mother.
“He might do that for a few weeks,” Draco concedes “I’m sure he knows better than to separate us like that for too long-after all, he wouldn’t want us to scare the little runts. Besides, it’s the last day before the winter holidays; he should have known better than to insist on a full day of classes.”
"That was graceful," Draco teased, helping Hadrian brush his clothes off, "You really must learn how to exit the Floo without making such a mess." Hadrian stuck his tongue out at Draco and stepped out of the way just as Narcissa came through.
"I didn't like the way they were looking at you," Draco said sullenly.

“No!” Harry interrupted, “I can’t-you can’t tell Dumbledore. I’ll explain later why later, but first I need to get away from here Dobby; someone gave my relatives a potion to block my magic, and I need to go somewhere safe until the potion wears off, but I don’t want anyone to recognize me. I don’t know who I can trust, other than you, so you can’t tell anyone else yet, okay Dobby?”
