“Ponce,” he called sleepily, letting a small grin tug the corner of his mouth upwards as she flipped him off. His eyes fluttered shut, and the last thing he recognized before drifting back to sleep was the steady breath from the boy next to him.
McGonagall raised her hand, and apparently tried very hard not to do the same with her eyebrow. She was not particularly successful.
Draco wasn’t sure what happened next. One moment his eyes were vacantly trained on Harry’s face as Weasley whispered to his girlfriend, and the next he was curled around Harry’s prone form in the hospital wing.
The thread was glowing brighter, thicker somehow. It was stretching towards Harry, making his skin appear to take a gold cast.
“Darling, do you mind if I look?” Pansy asked, touching the back of his hand to steady the shaking he didn’t realize he had started.
Harry’s mouth was slack, but Draco could easily see how his lips would quirk to the side, or set in determination. He had thought of how soft they were against his; despite Harry’s atrocious lack of grooming skills, they hadn’t been chapped. It made Draco mad knowing how it felt to be kissed by Harry, while also knowing it wouldn’t happen again. Never mind that it was a self imposed limitation.
Sure, he and Potter had forged something of a correspondence over the summer, but that was largely at the insistence of his mother. At least, as far as he had told Pansy. The initial letter had been her doing at any rate, penned under Narcissa’s careful watch Draco expressed his family’s deep gratitude at Potter’s testimonies, and his mother’s wish for him to come to tea.
It was night, he realized. Hours must have passed, but he had no recollection of what happened during them.
Draco continued, as if unaware of their collective stare. “Right before he fainted I looked into the cauldron, somehow he had corrected the potion inside it. When healing droughts get too hot they become unstable as some of the ingredients denaturalize, we would-
, ferret,” Harry continued, ignoring Draco’s scoff, “you’re the best part of this school year. Thank you for being here.”
“Right, yes. So as Ron said, the closest modern version is muggle wedding vows- I believe part of the reason why is that the original Tether seems to be muggle, and someone put it in one of their religious texts. Honestly it’s quite fascinating how much of an effect the wizarding world had on muggle religions- there’s quite a bit of evidence to suggest-“
It’s unfair that for all that Potter is distracted that his potion appears to be perfect, at least from what Draco can see. Granger’s shoulders are relaxed and she’s spending more time coaching Weasley and Longbottom than correcting Potter. Draco suddenly realizes that Potter has yet to make one mistake in their potions course yet this year.
“If you’re doing some whole self-pitying thing, thinking he’d be better off without you, he’ll be furious. Fuck’s sake, he’s had enough decisions made for him. At least let him make this one.”
They stayed like that for several long moments. Draco, from his spot wrapped in Pansy’s protective embrace, let himself drift as his breathing calmed. He wondered what it might be like not to owe his life to Harry. If he has just never responded to that first owl, or if he hadn’t sent it in the first place. What if’s filtered through, floating around one thing that he
“Mr. Potter, I believe it’s safe to remove your charm now,” came the surprisingly firm voice of their professor.
“Till death…” Weasley muttered before rising and exiting much in the same manner his better half had taken.
He slowly sat up, careful to not prop himself up on any part of the boy next to him. Harry’s color had somewhat returned, and Draco could see small movement to indicate he was breathing. It felt like all of the fuzz that had been keeping his brain quiet dissolved at the sight, and Draco was helpless against the rush of emotion that filled in its place.
“Mister Malfoy, if you do decide to go forward with this, I will do everything I can to ensure your safety. Hogwarts has lost too many of her students.” With that, she swept into her office, leaving Draco with Pansy.
“I just… you know how I got my glasses fixed today?” He began haltingly. Ron’s nod and Hermione’s brief guilty expression urged him on. “Well I just, I didn’t know he was so-“ he broke off and gestured vaguely.
Relief, anger, grief- all welled up in him until his frame shook with the force of his weeping. He tried to stay quiet, if he was going to have to bear the indignity of crying he would well do it alone, but a soft hand on his back alerted him that he hadn’t been entirely successful.
A small cough brought Draco’s awareness back to the room at large. He snatched his hand back to his side and fought furiously against the blush that was rising before turning to face Madam Pomfrey. He realized his battle against turning pink was futile as he took in her raised brow.
Harry had taken to occasionally studying with him, sometimes with Granger and Weasley in tow, but often it would be just the two of them. The times that they spent in companionable silence would convince Draco, in the moment, that this whole plan was working. The distance between them was enough, it was comfortable without being too personal, and he didn’t even want more.
For Harry’s part, he decided that the damage had already been done and if this resulted in him being decked that Madam Pomfrey would at least be pleased to know it wasn’t a professor who sent him to the hospital wing this time. Draco, on the other hand, froze as a fierce blush took over his face.
Harry who had moved as if possessed, no hint of green left in his eyes as they welled with gold-black tears. Harry who seemed not to hear Draco begging for him to ease on his magic. Harry who had fallen like a puppet with its strings cut.
“I meant the voice other than yours, I do believe I can recognize when a student of mine is speaking.”
How could it have only been yesterday that he had run into Harry outside this very room? Some small number of hours separated this moment from then, but it felt like it had been weeks. The hope that had flourished in his chest at Potter’s words rivaled the suffocating sense of foreboding that gripped him as he looked down at the slack expression on Harry’s face.
However, when the third class in a row had Draco needing to be nudged when called on, Harry decided it was worth the risk.
The dark haired boy hadn’t moved at all in the night. His chest still rose and fell in even measure, but Draco no longer felt the deep reassurance he had in the night from the sight.
“Draco is Tethering him.” Hermione interrupted, moving to where Draco was sitting, staring transfixed at the streak of Harry’s magic within his own. “See? Pansy, you were right, can I see the memory? You said it called Harry-“
“He’s stable, Mister Weasley. Mister Malfoy is still unable to be much separated from him, and it appears-“
He was so busy convincing himself it wouldn’t bother him for Potter to leave with Finnegan, he almost missed the way Harry’s expression flattened.
McGonagall watched with increasing exasperation as Hermione and Ron exchanged glances. She knew that look, the silent evaluation of how much to tell- she had seen it shared between themselves and Harry more times than she could stand.
The grin that spread across Pansy’s face made Draco wish he could go back to being a toddler, and stop himself from ever having become her friend.
“Pansy, please just get out what’s on your mind, you’ll never finish your essay if you don't,” Draco said quietly, keeping his eyes trained out the window.
What was he thinking? There was no point in trying to become someone Harry deserved, not when he knew that he couldn’t let it go anywhere. He wouldn’t.
Draco glanced around the library, content that no one was nearby to see him rest his head on the table and let out a small groan.
“What, exactly, are you hoping to discover in observing me?” He said, trying to replace exasperation with venom in his tone, but not quite succeeding.
While a magical net would be less likely to hurt, an abrupt stop could still do damage. The thought was so painful that Harry sent out another wave of magic through the first, checking over Draco for signs of injury. It came back clear, but Harry didn’t feel any better. They were still thirty feet above the pitch, and one slip of concentration would result in the whole thing dissolving.
“What do you mean Weasley and Granger wouldn’t have let me into the hospital wing? I saw them before I came here, dead asleep on the floor of the common room.”
“Maybe that was a poor choice of words, but I’m still… I refuse to let this be worse than it already is.”
Before Harry could begin to wonder what had just happened, he became all at once aware of every air molecule between Draco and the ground. His magic reached into the spaces between them, the sheer desperation for Draco to be
Hermione sighed when it seemed that Harry wouldn’t break from his reverie of Malfoy watching without outside intervention, and hooked her arm through his. Ron’s hand found its way to her free one, and she marched her boys out of the charms classroom, glad that her boyfriend immediately launched them into a conversation about what lunch might be that day.
The cold sensation was easing, though the tugging on his hands seemed to be getting stronger. Draco put a hand to Harry’s chest, where the glowing was the brightest.
In his panic, Harry didn’t realize that he had begun to call his magic to the surface. If Draco had been in any position to notice, he might’ve commented on how Harry’s skin seemed to glow, or how his eyes began to darken, bypassing gold and going straight to black.
He looked up at her, increasingly confused as she pressed a green apple into his hands before summoning a chair to sit and face him.
“Poppy, I believe if anything Mister Potter’s tenure here at Hogwarts has shown us what we might dismiss as myths should be treated more delicately. If there is enough to suggest that this is indeed the case, we should treat it as such.”
She began casting her spells, ordering Draco to get up from the bed and try walking away from Harry. When his heartbeat didn’t stutter, she allowed a small but satisfied smile rest on her face. Harry had been doing a poor job of holding back his questions, but Draco still felt he couldn’t speak and his friends were trying their best to get back on Madam Pomfrey’s good side, and stayed quiet.
Sure, it’s only been a few weeks, but usually between Potter, Longbottom, and Finnegan there were already two exploded cauldrons, and several class-long lectures from Granger over potions that were seconds from disaster.
Draco knew that Harry loved him. It wasn’t something he ever doubted- not when the golden trio regaled himself and Pansy of their exploits, not when the accusations of love potions were thrown in his face, and certainly not when he was standing with Harry’s arms wrapped around his middle, faces inches apart. It’s just that sometimes he thought Harry
“Mister Potter, I would prefer you to stay for the rest of the night for observation, and you too Mister Malfoy.” Poppy said, giving a pointed look towards Hermione and Ron. They took the hint and bade their goodbyes, though Poppy doubted she could stop them if they had tried to say.
It didn’t really, but Draco could tell the more he learned, the more he felt he couldn’t breathe, so he nodded.
Poppy took in a deep breath, letting it out slowly, trying to decide how best to address the situation.
“Oh, they had to come by before dinner, after a year on the run Pomfrey thought we could use some nutrient potions and stuff, so when they came for their dose was when they put it up today.”
He nodded, and started to rise out of the bed before remembering the limitation on his movement. Madam Pomfrey seemed to understand and levitated the basin over to him. He glanced between the two women nervously before plummeting into his own memory.
“Yes, well despite your romantic inclinations, it needs some work. Is there anything more in those decrepit volumes of yours that might help?”
, a voice called, soft but unkind. Harry had enough experience with invasions of his mind to know this was another.
“You think it will be okay, but I know how this goes- they’ll say horrible things about you, I know because those things would’ve come from
Harry must’ve woken at some point in the day, as there was a tray of nibbled on food next to him with a half drunk glass of water. He currently seemed dead to the world, just as unconscious as he had been when Draco had brought him in. Draco stilled, all at once unsure of his plan.
Draco stiffened slightly. He still wasn’t confident about what their future would hold, and his ability to weather the storm that was sure to follow their graduation. It was easy to relax again, though, when Harry just held him tighter in response to his unsaid worry.
“Don’t be crass, Pans. You know as well as I do that he’s been quite busy in the past few years.” Draco sniffed, lifting a delicate bite of lunch to his mouth.
“No, of course he’s not done something- why do you keep thinking he’s done something?” Harry snapped, leaving Ron to hold his hands up in defense.
“Harry is well loved, as you know. But we, the staff, and his friends, knew that this might have been borrowed time. If I-“ she broke off again, and Draco couldn’t hold back.
“Mr. Malfoy, please drink this.” Madam Pomfrey was watching him with worry written into every line of her face. She was pressing a cool glass vial into his hand, and he took it without a second thought.
Days flew by in a blur, convictions and contradictions chasing out all other thoughts until Draco felt he could see the mental rut they had caused. He tried to continue on as usual, but it was clear to anyone who looked that he was slipping.
Draco stared at her. What in Merlin’s name was she talking about? Draco didn’t recall anyone else, and he knew Harry hadn’t spoken the whole time.
Draco hesitated before prodding Harry’s hand lightly, hoping he took it as an invitation to continue.
“Ah, well.” Harry’s amusement slid off his face. Draco realized the light of laughter in his eyes had hidden how exhausted the boy looked. Harry tilted his head back, taking a deep breath before closing his eyes. “You have to promise that this stays between us. Alright?”
“We brought you dinner, you slept through lunch- Madam Pomfrey said.” Hermione’s voice had an edge of humor to it.
Harry’s arms around him were starting to loosen their hold, and Draco didn’t know how to explain that that made everything so much worse. He gripped onto Harry’s elbow, stopping the movement. In some wonderful, terrible, display of how much Harry understood him, he pulled Draco closer again.
Draco turned numbly to Potter, a question on his lips, but before he could get it out, Potter seemed to crumple, and then plummet towards the floor.
“It… it really doesn’t sound dangerous?” Draco didn’t intend for it to be a question, but apparently his nerves were determined to betray him.
In fact, he knew Narcissa at least approved of him. They had exchanged a handful of owls over the summer after his initial refusal of tea, and had plans to spend a day with Andromeda and Teddy during Christmas hols. Molly and Arthur not only knew of his friendship with Draco, but had been the ones pushing for Harry to label it as such, rather than as a truce.
Once they entered the hospital wing Draco realized with some trepidation that this was the first time he had been in here since Harry had sliced him open. The lump that formed in his throat as he recalled the way Harry had apologized for that incident threatened to choke him. It wasn’t that Draco was oblivious to his feelings, truly. He had known prior to this moment that the way he heated around Potter had nothing to do with anger, and that it hadn’t for some time. It wasn’t until this incident, however, that realized that the feelings were more than small admiration culminating in an embarrassing crush- something he shared with half the wizarding world. No, the stinging in his eyes as he laid Harry down on the crisp white bed suggested the feelings were something rather deep.
The gesture seemed to break the dam, and Hermione rushed forwards as well, practically plastering herself over Harry.
“What if… can we still be friends?” Harry’s voice was just above a whisper, much calmer than the frantic pleading of Draco’s.
“He would do it for anyone.” He said quietly, hoping the woman who Harry looked up to so much understood what he was leaving unsaid.
“Harry Potter you wake up this instant!” He heard her yell, unable to make sense of the way she leaned a hand to Harry’s throat. “You do not get to die on us now, oh Merlin what have you done,” she continued frantically.
“Well, I can’t speak for Blaise, but I know Ron and Hermione are fine with it. Obviously, otherwise they would’ve never let you in the hospital wing. As for papers, you know I’ve never taken much stock in anything they print, plus if you don’t want them to know, we can hide.” Draco shook his head in the circle of Harry’s arms. “What, you think I can’t hide things from the prophet? Kingsley has been keeping them on a short leash for months-“
It was too much. Draco lasted a scant few minutes longer, eyes unseeing as they trained on the quill hanging limply in his hand. The sound of Potter’s laughter as Pansy explained how they were caught by Snape washed over him. He stood from their table and mumbled some excuse about finding a book before tearing out of the common room.
She pulled away and patted him once on the cheek, ignoring the incredulous look he gave her. She turned to the subdued students.
not asking, Ronald, you are asking,” Hermione reproached, pushing her knee into Ron’s so he would know she wasn’t actually upset. “Besides, I just want to know because you seem like something's on your mind and you do keep looking at him. I thought you might be worried.”
He knew what they were seeing. The flash of the snitch, the way his fingers had grazed the metal wing before he could realize he was no longer secure on his broom, then nothing but air. Or ground, more accurately. Ground that he seemed to be rapidly approaching, until all of a sudden it wasn’t.
“Right. You said when you went into the forest, that day, that you had the cloak and the stone with you, and you used them. Well, because you had mastery of the elder wand, you became the Master of Death. But then you…”
“Don’t act like I don’t know when something’s up with my best mate, and I know your apology to Mione didn’t come out of the blue. So,” he leaned forward, “figure it out. Whatever it is. Harry is… Harry deserves…”
Her expression was flat, occasionally wavering towards fury before morphing towards pained acceptance until she could school it again. He wished he hadn’t looked.
Small touches, a hand on his shoulder or clasping at his wrist as he was tugged to the quidditch pitch, an elbow to his side as they teased each other. It was driving Draco spare. That was why he was hiding alone in the library to begin with.
Weasley and Granger seemed to be having a silent conversation, raising their eyebrows and flickering glances between Harry and the door Pomfrey had just left from. Granger appeared to win whatever it was, and turned resolutely to maintain vigil over Harry.
The sound was clear and bright, and Harry abruptly realized that if this was as close as he could ever be to Draco, it would be enough. It would be enough to see him laugh, carefree and exuberant. The knowledge filled his chest, and despite already being in the air, Harry felt he truly understood what it meant to be flying.
“Better?” Madam Pomfrey asked, swishing her wand in a quick diagnostic charm. “Your heart rate seems to indicate so.”
Draco deeply, whole-heartedly, wished she was. It was relatively simple when laid out like this- he could see how the year would go. He would continue his friendship with Potter, and this sodding golden boy with his golden fucking heart would worm his way deeper and deeper into Draco, smoothing all his sharp edges with disgusting things like hope. And then, at the end, when Draco had let himself believe that things might be good, the world outside of Hogwarts would tear them apart. Potter would probably try for it not to, of course. He was good like that. He would send owls and have tea with Narcissa, but every day he went into Auror training he would be asked, nagged, and battered about his connection to Draco.
his eyes didn’t get the gilt edge they did in potions, they were dark- black, honestly- and he started welling up. I thought it might’ve been blood, but it was all wrong- thick and…” he trailed off.
“We shall not part until we have both experienced life, he will join me on this side of the tie, he will
“I had actually gotten hit with the AK. I was already back by then, but being carried by him I realized something was a little… much? I thought it was- I don’t really know what I thought, I was kinda busy,” he breaks off with a wet laugh, and there’s no level of trepidation that could have stopped Draco from grabbing Harry’s hand in his.
Harry’s eyes were open; soft green gaze resting on the gilded cord connecting them. Draco could hear a relieved laugh, but it wasn’t until Harry reached out to touch his shaking shoulders that he realized it wasn’t himself making the noise. Instead, Draco was silent as tears made their way freely down his cheeks.
“Shut up! I didn’t realize what had happened until Pomfrey came out and found the lot of them frozen in place, after that Hermione helped her set up a ward that prevented anyone who wasn’t keyed in through to me. Ron has to be the one to key new people in, so if you got here without a problem they must’ve… you know…”
Poppy Pomfrey was ready to retire. She had thought if she could survive students being petrified, she could handle anything. Then the Carrows had come and she had to start treating students for after effects of the cruciatus curse, and she thought if she survived that, that nothing could make her leave Hogwarts.
“At least you’ll have McGonagall’s supervision- Snape would never have conceded so easily. Do you remember-“
“No- it turns out that Draco is your Tether to life. He was, is, your connection to this side of the veil, and basically pulled you across. Any time you got slightly separated the connection would fade and your heart would- well. It’s been the two of you here since you collapsed on the quidditch pitch.”
The moment they had risen Draco seemed more himself. Within minutes he was calling taunts, demanding Harry show him how to do tricks, and generally being more alive than Harry had seen him in what felt like ages.
“I believe so. You should have seen when Miss Granger and Mister Weasley were here, and look at how solid it is there-“ Pomfrey gestured to the light above Draco’s hands. “It’s only like this when he’s not been awake to control it, I’m sure it takes quite a bit out of him.”
At what, Draco doesn’t immediately understand, but once he’d been righted to standing he turns to look at their potion and stops short.
“I believe you just saw that it was myself,” he said, tone icy. “I understand it might be difficult to imagine I care about anything, but to question if I was worried about my-“
He groaned and fought his way out of the circle of Harry’s arms. Sure enough there was a tray of food next to him, though the darkness of the room suggested it was well after dinner time. He took a few bites before turning to the silent, slightly smirking couple next to him.
“Draco dearest, you’re about to ruin our potion.” Pansy’s voice is kind but the way she digs her fingers into his elbow conveys just how irritated she is with him.
Draco sighed and nodded at Hermione. With a quick flash of her wand, the red light appeared around him, with its thread of gold shining brightly in contrast. He shuddered slightly as he tried to push the crippling awareness of what a stupid decision this was from his mind.
Hermione stopped short on seeing the display, eyes narrowed in on where the two tones met. Pansy and Ron seemed more distracted by their respective best friends.
“I mean that you two showed up to school all soft barbs and inside jokes when the last anyone had seen of you two was Potter pinning your wrists back with a bloody nose. Plus, Auntie Cissa asked if I too had become pen pals with Potter.” She said this last statement with the same tone as someone might declare check-mate.
His glares were no longer effective in cowing the general public, however. It was an adjustment he had not quite made peace with.
Draco, Granger, and Weasley all hovered as Madam Pomfrey went about casting diagnostic spell after spell, occasionally prompting Draco for more information on the incident.
As like the previous times, this seemed to take the last bit of wind from Draco’s sails, and he slumped to the side, neatly tucking his head into the crook of Harry’s shoulder. They stood quiet for a moment, watching as the giant squid created lazy ripples across the surface of the great lake.
Just as he was about to swallow, Pansy muttered “not too busy to owl you, though,” and Draco promptly choked.
“Unfortunately it kinda is, Professor. Sorry, it’s just…” Ron shrugged helplessly, gesturing to Harry’s prone form. “Gotta keep safe what we can, ya’know?”
Pansy immediately picked her story up again, and neither of them gave Finnegan a cursory glance as he walked away.
“Well that’s what I think being a tether means,” Hermione started. “Someone who fills you up with so much life, so much willingness to live. I think it probably changes- I bet Ron or I would have been it if…” she broke off, as if not saying “if you hadn’t fallen in love with him” aloud would hide the fact that that’s what happened.
for your whereabouts on more than one occasion! You know just as well as I do that I tried to pull away, but he- every time, he- Pansy he…” Draco deflated, mortified at the tears that sprang to his eyes.
Before dinner but after potions.  After Weasley’s incredibly awkward attempt at what Draco now understood to be wrapping his head around the possibility of Draco being… something. To Harry.
“Harry, is something the matter with Malfoy?” She asked, hoping her tone sounded appropriately worried.
“Wassit about Malfoy? Has the ferret gone and done something?” Ron asked, possibly a little too hopefully. He had not reached quite the same level of truce with the Slytherin as Harry had.
It didn’t stop some of the younger years from trailing behind them when they went to Hogsmeade, or peering through the stacks while they studied. It did, however, make moments like this, where they could just be two eighteen year olds, feel charged. Harry was sure that was why Draco was once again bringing up his shock at how Harry had categorized his most recent forrary with death.
Time dripped like honey after that- one scene moving slowly but seamlessly to the next. After potions was a trip around the grounds, something his court-ordered mind healer suggested, followed by a methodical dinner passed in relative silence. Soon enough Draco was ensconced in the eighth year dorm, sitting in the armchair farthest from the fire, staring out the window.
Harry laughed as the doors closed behind him, thankful that at least one person in this school wasn’t treating him like glass. Ever since the staff had been informed that Harry had indeed died in the forest they had taken to slightly hysterical levels of protection. Professor Sprout couldn’t look at him without starting to tear up, and Headmistress McGonagall routinely pressed fruit into his hands whenever they passed in the hallways. And that was to say nothing of the students.
, as it were, when it comes to you.” Draco peeked between his fingers, endlessly frustrated that Harry appeared to have no idea what he meant. “Potter, when you collapsed, I thought my heart was the one in danger of stopping.”
, come on, look at me, can you hear me? Please, please look at me,” Draco begged, reaching out to grab his hand. It was colder than he expected it to be, and Draco couldn’t stop himself from recoiling.
Pansy snorted as Hermione muttered “Oh honestly,” still flushing. Draco could tell this had been the subject of some debate, and spared a moment to feel miserable that he had unwittingly picked Weasley’s side in the matter.
Draco’s mind was racing. In his previous imaginings of how this would go, he hadn’t considered the possibility of Potter liking him back. He wasn’t even sure that was a possibility now, but it seemed much more likely than it had before Harry had spoken.
The bond the eighth year girls had with each other was a continual surprise to Draco. After a warm welcome offered to Daphne and Millie on the Hogwarts Express, Pansy had hissed that something needed to be done otherwise she would end up the scapegoat amongst their year. Draco privately thought she had nothing to worry about, considering his own attendance, but was hardly going to bar her from whatever theatrics she deigned important. One public, and frankly hilarious, apology to Potter later and Pansy was part of their pack.
“Once you‘ve eaten I’ll call the headmistress in. I sent Miss Parkinson to her dorm seeing as Mister Weasley and Miss Granger saw fit to do so, but I’m sure they will all be here again before long.”
Hermione hesitated. “There’s only further descriptions of what the wix was dying of, really. It sounds like what we could call magical core degeneration, which is essentially the opposite of what’s happening to Harry. There might be other books…”
Draco did as he was told, and held still while Madam Pomfrey extracted the memory from the previous day. Draco made sure the scene started from when he had seen the snitch and not a minute earlier, lest they notice the way his eyes continued to stray from Harry’s face to his other assets.
Hiding in the library seemed like the natural response. The three of them had been tucked in the corner of the common room, Draco really being the only one trying to work. Pansy was knee deep in a story about her experience trying to sneak in firewhisky during the Yule Ball when Finnegan came over.
Draco huffed out a small laugh and settled back down in the bed. He watched through increasingly bleary eyes as Pansy pushed together the recently vacated chairs and transfigured them into an elegant fainting couch.
“Hermione has been researching what’s been up with him since summer,” Weasley said, as if completely oblivious to Draco’s embarrassment. “Harry didn’t want to talk about it, so it’s not been going well, what with not enough information n’stuff, but something about the proximity factor made her remember reading something a while back. She thought it was in one of the books at Grimmauld, so it wasn’t super helpful, but enough to get her into research mode ‘nstead of panic.”
“Yeah, right, thanks Madam Pomfrey! I’ll be back for that nutrient potion with Ron and Hermione before dinner,” Harry replied, pulling his bag over his shoulder.
was a solid mass in Draco’s throat. He opened his mouth but no sound came out. A shaky breath escaped, followed by another. Before he could make sense of the movement, Harry tugged him down, tucking his head under his chin.
Draco was struck with the sudden desire to tell her that Harry sometimes referred to her as Minnie, that it was okay for her to care so much about the boy laying next to him because some adult had to, that he didn’t buy her attempt at professional distance for a second because he had already tried being distant from Harry and it was futile.
Pansy seems to realize it at the same time, and they share as close to a wide-eyed look as they get outside of their private rooms.
“Resistance?” Draco supplied, easily imagining how hard he would have fought against anyone touching his memories. The suggestion earned him a weak smile and nod from Weasley.
Pomfrey and McGonagall both looked as if they wanted to press, but before they could, Pansy stepped forward.
“Draco,” McGonagall started once they were alone, “I want you to know that while this may feel like you are being asked, or that you are expected to do this- I assure you that is not the case. Particularly, if you do decide not to go through with this, no one will be upset. Harry…” she took a shuddering breath, losing the composure that had been holding her upright.
Draco didn’t have to raise his head to know who had spoken. The damage was already done, as far as he was concerned. There would be no dignity regained if he righted himself now, and as long as he didn’t see the ginger’s face he could pretend Weasley hadn’t heard him whispering curses to himself.
Harry swallowed, turning over excuse after excuse in his head. As much as he didn’t want to understand where Draco was coming from, the memory of one of Narcissa’s owls kept running through his mind.
“So? What happened!” Harry cried as soon as the doors shut. “C’mon Hermione, I know you’re dying to say how you figured it out.”
The liquid was an instant balm to his frayed nerves. Its biting chill took the edge off his feverish alarm, allowing him to feel as oxygen returned to his extremities. Each breath made the calm spread until finally his mind was blissfully quiet.
“Wha’dya mean pretty? He’s a pointy git! He’s all pale and,” Ron scrunched up his face, trying to find the right word. “Delicate.” He decided.
“I’m just trying to figure out what Harry sees, I guess.” Weasley’s voice suggested some level of amusement. It made Draco’s blood boil.
He watched as she ran though several diagnostic spells before uttering the one he had watched the day of the potions incident.
“You said you were in ‘such a state’ or something, maybe there?” Harry offered, ever trying to be helpful.
“That’s just it!” Harry exclaimed, emboldened now that he had started. “I didn’t know he was so delicate! He’s just been a blond and kinda blurry shape for the last few years unless he got up in my face, and usually by then I wasn’t thinking about whether or not he had freckles! But he does! And he, he blushes! How would I have known, I haven’t been able to fucking see the prat’s face!”
“We were coming out to join when we saw you start to fall, Hermione kept trying to cast a cushioning charm but something kept stopping the spell from reaching you. What happened?”
Hermione smiled at him, clearly interpreting his outburst as bravery or something equally distasteful. Pansy had no such illusions and shot him a look that clearly said
All at once the tugging stopped. The golden thread flared bright, turning into an elegant chain that wrapped around Draco’s hands and ended at Harry’s heart. The light was warm, chasing away any lingering sense of cold that had crept into Draco’s skin.
Pansy seemed as if she was going to ask further questions, but at that moment Professor McGonagall strode through the infirmary doors.
She stood and waited for everyone except Draco to leave the infirmary. Hermione left her books on the table next to the bed, and gave him an awkward hug before leaving. Ron shrugged as Draco stared wide-eyed at her retreating figure, and followed her out. Pansy pressed a quick kiss to the side of his head and murmured “don’t die,” before leaving as well.
Pomfrey gave a small laugh as she lifted one edge of her robes and stepped to the side. Every place she had been left small prints on the floor, fading within seconds only for new dark blue footmarks to appear when she moved again.
“Woah, okay, then why d’ya keep staring at him? Last time you were mad we didn’t think he was up to something and now you’re mad we’re asking?”
Draco was yelling something at him now, but the roar of blood and magic in Harry’s ears kept it from being comprehensible. There were only a few feet left, he could make it.
, Draco thought before he let Ron’s words sink in. He took quick stock of his body and realized with no small amount of humiliation that he had wrapped himself even further around Harry, tangling their legs together and clasping him tight around his middle.
She had just begun detailing the argument around the versus they had written when the pair came running back in, unassuming leather bound book in tow.
Just as he made it to the door of the infirmary he heard, “-And don’t come back sooner! If I hear one more professor realizing you need a health concern addressed, I’ll keep you here for good!”
He couldn’t hear anything. No voices but his own, no people other than the two of them and who he now knew to be the faint figures of Hermione and Ron on the ground.
Harry tried not to notice. In fact, if it had been anyone other than Malfoy he wouldn’t have, but years of observing the git meant he was already watching him when it happened. Habit, of course. That was the reason he couldn’t stop staring. It didn’t have anything to do with the way Malfoy’s blond lashes swept against his cheek when he blinked, or the rosy flush that exaggerated his sharp features. Nothing to do with that at all.
“Mr. Malfoy, if I cast a featherweight charm on him would you mind bringing him to the infirmary? I’d rather not risk transferring him to someone else if possible.” Madam Pomfrey’s tone was soft, but clearly indicated that any answer other than agreement would be met with great distaste.
It was… incomplete, somehow, but out of the ones written it came the closest. Draco told Hermione as much and was surprised when she blushed.
Harry laughed and lightly butted his head against Draco’s shoulder. The comment niggled something in his memory.
Gold ribbons flowed over Harry, tangling through his hair and fingers, wrapping snugly around his chest while making intricate loops over his legs. There was one that was different from the others, a chain that seemed more solid than the rest. Draco reached out.
“I know darling, it’s horrific that people know you’re in love, but that’s the price of you refusing to be separated from him. What’s that thing muggles say? Till death do us part?”
The field is gone, but when Draco approaches he realized the potion had also been corrected, any trace of it’s volatile reaction was erased.
“If anything you could say you won it after embarrassingly confessing your feelings, which I graciously and calmly turned down,” Draco sniffed, not bothering to hide the smile playing at the corner of his mouth.
Harry pulled Draco back to his side, and they shifted until they were in the position Draco had awoken from what now seemed ages ago. Draco smiled into Harry’s collarbone.
Hermione cleared her throat, and Draco did his best not to roll his eyes at the way hers and Ron’s eyes shone suspiciously. He redirected the impulse by looking at Pansy instead.
Granger had Harry’s face cradled in her hands. Her fingertips were streaked with the remnants of dark tears, and he could hear that her scolding had turned to pleading whispers.
This was the scene that Madam Pomfrey came into, clucking as she made her way to where their group was huddled.
“Well… this is where it’s a little fuzzy, in the historical record.” Hermione began, opening another tome. “See, the story of the other Tether became something of a legend, and there’s reference to how they brought their nearly-departed back from the clutches of death. It’s a ritual, and I believe I’ve managed to narrow down the consistencies into something close to what might’ve actually happened across a few different retellings, but without a proper account-“
“That’s why you were blushing? A sweet nothing from the Boy Who Lived! Oh this is fabulous, please tell me you happened to be the first thing he saw once he could see,” her gleeful crow was drawing the attention of nearby students, and Draco wanted nothing more than to glare at them.
Draco peeked from between his fingers, taking in the breathless hope in Harry’s eyes. He nodded. Harry let out a laugh. It was bright and filled with exuberance. Draco simultaneously wished he could bottle the sound, and wished he had never heard it for the sap it made of him.
“Yes, much,” he said quietly. The peace that had settled over him gave him room to take in his surroundings. The hospital wing seemed somehow more bleak in the morning light, though he was pleasantly surprised to find a breakfast tray at the end of the bed he shared with Harry.
Draco, for his part, was trying very hard not to be frustrated with all of the dancing around. The fact no one had mentioned what the voice had said, or what the light was, got under his skin. It felt like a reminder that he wasn’t trustworthy.
Weasley’s voice was nice. It was calm and deep, and didn’t cut through the cotton that had filled Draco’s mind the second he realized Harry was cold.
“Impossible?” Harry’s smile didn’t meet his eyes, and it made Draco wish he could tug the boy into his lap. Or perhaps vice versa, if his arms looked as comforting as he imagined they would be.
Pansy and Weasley shared a glance, and Draco had the distinct feeling of being in the wrong universe. Since when did Pansy share looks with
“I am the Tether to your Master- tie him to life, as he ties me. Until Death comes for us both, we shall not part.” Draco repeats, ignoring the growing cold. “We shall not part!” The tugging is somewhat worse, and Draco has a moment of clarity of realizing just
“Harry if you don’t come back to me Death will take us both, you absolute tosspot! I am your Tether and I refuse to die, and
that happened while the rest of us were attending school like normal kids.” Pansy’s voice sounded far away, as if she too had just realized how often the trio had found their lives recklessly endangered.
He knew if Harry made it through this that he wouldn’t be able to go back to last names and stilted friendship.
Maybe that was what stung the most, really. Even when he was unable to be separated from the epitome of everything good in their world, it wasn’t enough to combat the stain on him. He clamped a hand over his left arm.
She switched tracks when she realized he truly had no clue, instead roping him in to brainstorm ways to snap Draco out of it.
Draco bowed his head, unwilling to see if her eyes were as tear-bright as he feared they might be. She sniffed.
“Harry, what have you gotten me into,” Draco whispered. “I know you don’t realize just how much you affect the people around you, but if you could just... have tried, at least. Have tried to reign it in, maybe I wouldn’t be in such a state.”
“Who do you take me for, Weasel? No one would listen to a damn thing I have to say about Potter, anyway.”
“What do you mean?” Draco asked when he had recovered, hoping the strain in his voice sounded as if it came from choking and nothing else.
“Alright, fine. You’re going to be angry though.” Pansy put down her quill and faced him head on. Her voice was low, and Draco knew with terrible clarity what was going to come next.
“Seamus, I am actually busy right now. I’ll join next time.” His voice was firm, and then he turned to face Pansy once again, giving her a small smile. “So you had just realized the bottle was too big?” He prompted.
“You were quite beside yourself, it was ghastly. Between you and Hermione, Ronald and I had a lot of time being the only coherent people in the room.”
“So, I think something from that should be your missing piece. I don’t believe that was the actual chant, but it’s more than we had before. You should just have to say it a few times, if possible we should have that spell up so you can focus on the bit of Harry’s magic that’s tied to you. Straightforward, really.”
“Harry, mate, wanna come join us for a four on four?” His tone was casual but the way he studiously avoided looking at either Pansy or Draco immediately had the blond on edge.
“And when you become an auror? How will you deal with all your co-workers thinking your boyfriend is a death eater who got off with too light a sentence?”
McGonagall pursed her lips. If her students were going to go through with this plan regardless of her concern, it would likely be beneficial for them to have researched everything they could. She also wouldn’t chagrin the opportunity for Draco to have more time to think through the implications of this action.
“If he ever even looks at anyone else after this, I’ll gut him myself- don’t worry.” Draco said, brushing the pads of his fingers over Harry’s forehead before lightly carding them through his unruly curls.
“Something about ‘to love and to cherish, till death do us part’ or an iteration like it. It’s part of a longer set, but honestly I couldn’t be bothered with the whole thing; muggle weddings are disgustingly soppy.”
“Excellent. I’m going to cast the core monitoring spell, then you’re going to make your appeal to Death. In theory you should feel your tie to Harry at that point, so if you do let me know, and we’ll keep going. You might have to repeat the chant a few times- wouldn’t be a chant without it, really- and we’ll go from there.”
“And unpredictable. And kinda destroying him.” Ron added, putting a hand to his girlfriend's arm. “So, we’ve been looking into it some, and realized that dying while in control of the elder wand might have had some- ah, consequences?”
“Well, first, I don’t want to be an auror anymore, so no worries about Robards or whoever trying to convince me that you’re evil. Second, if someone did try to say something like that about my boyfriend, I’d clearly have to correct them.”
“Right, so we found you two on the ground after watching Harry do,” he waved his hand, “what he does, and ah… Hermione was kind of losing it. I called for Pomfrey, obviously she knows that stuff’s been up with him, and she came down just as you stopped Hermione from trying to lift him. You said something about not moving people with possible head injuries- sounded right out of a textbook, mate- and then Pomfrey did some scan on him to see if he could be moved safely, she had you carry him cause… well, I had my hands full with Mione.” He took a breath, casting a heavy look towards the doors the aforementioned girl had disappeared behind.
“Yeah mate, pretty bril honestly. He had to shout a bit at Death about loving you, and-“ Draco let out a mortified whimper, hiding his face at Ron’s words.
So really, if Harry could chalk up the surprising ease he had for NEWT level courses as anything other than an uncomfortable amount of power, he would do it. And if that uncomfortable amount of power was something all the staff was aware of, then he could pretend it was safely in their hands by going to Madam Pomfrey for every little sign that maybe this new level of power was affecting his body.
For the first time since returning to school, Draco thanked his luck that in addition to having their own dorm, the eighth years had a lightened curfew. He strode out behind the suit of armor that guarded the entrance, turned sharply left, and all but ran to the hospital wing.
At that moment, Granger's hand shot out in front of him. He blinked at the sight, startling backwards.
He was somewhat surprised that the door was not only unlocked, but unguarded. With the fervor that some of the younger students followed Potter, he had assumed that there would be some sort of barrier preventing anyone from getting too close. However he hit no such disruption in his approach to the curtain that hid Potter from view.
Harry knew with how high up off the pitch they were that he would have no chance to save Draco from the fall. They had left their wands on the ground after Draco tried to charm Harry’s broom slower, and he couldn’t believe how stupid they had been.
Granger, for her part, exuded extreme anxiety and deep calm in equal measures. She was directing Slughorn to summon Madame Pomfrey, while gathering Pansy’s account of what happened.
“You are hurt aren’t you- oh god I knew the bastard was lying when it said it would help, you’d think I’d stop listening to voices- love, say something if you can, should I call for Pomfrey?”
“Look, Potter, I know you know your way around the castle, I thought it was a mild enough barb to count as… well, never mind, clearly even obvious jests are too harsh for your Gryffindor sense of what tests a
“Astute observation, Ronald. I’ll be sure to tell Death that it’s not as scary as a bigoted madman holding my mother hostage.” Draco’s voice was like ice.
“Anyway, you brought him here and then just, wouldn’t let him go. You kept saying he was warming up any time you were asked anything, just ‘He’s getting warmer’ and ‘He can’t get cold again’ over an’over. That’s when we called in Par, er, Pansy, in.”
“Well done, Weasel. You have successfully found me alive, now go and report back to The Nosey One.” Draco didn’t have the heart to put any acid into the words, and it made him all the more miserable.
Draco hardly realized that he had shot out to catch Potter until the full brunt of warm weight was on him. Draco shifted his arms, trying to maneuver Harry into an easier hold. By the time he had his head supported, Granger and Weasley had rushed over, the latter looking at his best friend in Malfoy’s arms with an unusual expression on his face.
There wasn’t anything Draco could say to that. If it had come from someone else, he would’ve felt it as a bid at manipulation, but from Harry it just sounded honest. Painfully, heart-wrenchingly honest.
As Harry gawked at the boy in front of him, a small voice that sounded suspiciously like Hermione’s reminded him that he had just had his glasses updated for the first time since he was a fourth year, and of course Malfoy wasn’t still going to look like a fourteen year old. That small voice was not quite loud enough to stop the louder, larger, more-sounding-like-Harry’s-own voice that was stuck on one word.
This stopped Poppy’s flurry of action. A quick glance at Miss Granger and Mister Weasley told her this was news to them as well.
Hauling Draco onto his lap, Harry wrapped himself around the trembling boy. Draco was considerably taller than himself, but he seemed so small as little noises of distress escaped his tightly clamped lips. It was easy to hold him, to tuck Draco’s head under his chin, to fold his arms around all of Draco’s sharp edges.
emotions. Harry knew his lungs weren’t holding enough air, and that was at odds with how happy he felt, but there was no room, no time, for anything else.
After one particularly harsh turn they lost sight of the snitch, trying to prevent themselves from colliding. Harry was transfixed as Draco evened out, laughing with his head tossed back.
It was all the blond could do not to hiss at the memory. When he had seen how limp Harry had looked he thought he was going to be sick. He remembered the wrongness of it: Potter always had been animated- body wound tight, ready to fight, ready to
Draco, for his part, was a little unnerved. Harry watching him was too reminiscent of sixth year, though this sort of attention had a decidedly different feel to it. Determined to give as good as he gets, Draco returns stare for stare. It isn’t a particularly difficult endeavor seeing as it means looking at Harry most of the day.  Something he is quite practiced at.
“I’ve found exactly one mention of how someone else had gotten away from death- they didn’t have the h- elder wand conundrum, but they did have a very powerful Tether to life. Someone who they couldn’t be separated from.”
“So you’re telling me the Chosen One didn’t know simple vision charms? So much for all our bets that Granger all but wipes his ass, she’d never let him forget-“
When they first came back to school, Harry trod lightly around the subject of flying with Malfoy. He knew that their experience in the Room of Requirement was one of the more tender spots between them, and resolved to give it, and anything related to it, a wide berth.
Preoccupied as he was, it escaped Harry’s notice that Hermione was watching him watch Malfoy. A small smile broke over her face. When Harry had insisted on speaking at Draco’s trial, she was worried that he would regret it. After all, it had only taken a few moments for their conversation to come to blows when Harry had tried to return Malfoy’s wand after fixing his own. But from that initial attempt at communication, the boys had reached a tentative and, frankly, very sweet truce. She would be even inclined to call it a friendship if she hadn’t noticed how often Harry dithered while responding to Draco’s owls since the trial.
“Erm, well, I think I said it,” he said, laughing. “Just that, well cause I didn’t know before then, I couldn’t see super great, everything was blurry and, you’re so…” he coughed, “last time I remember seeing what you looked like clearly was a while ago. You don’t. Look like that. Anymore.”
Harry hummed in agreement, paying more attention to the way Draco’s long, elegant fingers seemed to conduct their conversation.
“I thought maybe my magic needed to settle back after I had died, or maybe the curse scar had something to do with it. I’ve always had a hard time controlling my magic when emotions are high: I once accidentally aparated to the top of a building as a kid, and I just kinda thought it was more of that? But, turns out, I have way more power than I should, my magical core is kinda hemorrhaging, and my body isn’t strong enough to handle it all. Probably because the Durs- my relatives didn’t feed me enough.”
“Eat, Mister Malfoy.” She gave a sharp nod towards the fruit he had clasped in his lap. She waited until he had taken several bites before speaking again. “I realize this has been a stressful event for you, but if you wouldn’t mind allowing us to review your memory of the incident yesterday, we might have a better chance of... recovering Mister Potter.”
“Alright alright everyone, please continue on your potions! I believe you all must be getting close to being finished!” Slughorn called, seeming to only just realize how the rest of the class had paused at Harry’s collapse.
Too many of her students had a haunted look about them this year, but that was to be expected. A tragedy of course- but grief was a natural response, and one she encouraged. Harry’s smile as he continued to take in the new crisp-ness of his surroundings was painful to Poppy because she couldn’t remember ever having seen it before. A small contentment. It was the expression of a child who had his needs met in a way Harry clearly was unaccustomed to.
“Fishing for compliments, Malfoy?” Harry threw back, elbowing the blond lightly as soft heat fell over them both. “Am I not telling you enough?”
The problem with being a child in a war is that things fall out of priority quite quickly. Experiences that would be par for the course in any other setting, often fall to the wayside in the name of a greater good, or an old man's plans. However the perk of being these particular children, after this particular war, is they had the rest of their lives to make up for it.
However, Draco was not in position to notice, and even if he had, he would have been hard pressed to guess what was happening as Harry watched him fall through the air.
Apparently that had been the right question to ask, because Harry let out a short laugh, and Draco felt the tension seeping out of his arms.
She nodded sharply and rose. “I expect you to have finished that by the time I get back,” was all she said before leaving as quickly as she had arrived.
“We haven’t even gotten to Umbridge yet! Hermione said we had to wait until she thought I wouldn’t blame myself,” Draco scoffed, as if it were unwarranted. Harry considered bringing up how Draco had worked himself into a severe panic attack when they had told him how Ginny had come to possess Riddle’s cursed diary, but decided against it.
Harry nodded once, quickly looking at the ground before forcing his eyes back to Malfoy’s flushed face, and nodded again.
quickly replaced with cold dread. Harry’s eyes were black- he could tell even from such a distance. His curls whipped away from his face, giving an unobstructed view of the stiff way his face was set, so unlike the lighthearted joy that had been on it moments prior.
At that moment, Hermione and Ronald, followed by a slightly harried looking Pansy, came into the infirmary.
Granger and Weasley exchanged a look. It made Draco want to shake them, to ask what they were hiding. He was saved from acting on this temptation by Madam Pomfrey casting another diagnostic spell, one that lit up the entire room.
“I’ll do it.” Draco needed to say it before McGonagall’s rant could scare him out of it. He hadn’t lied when he had told Harry he was a coward- he’d do anything to avoid pain. Including going into something unaware of what it might entail.
Harry frowned down at his plate. He wasn’t worried about Malfoy. Not really. It hadn’t escaped his notice that few of the other returning Slytherins seemed to talk to him, and there was that time during the first week that Harry had come across him cornered by a few sixth year Ravenclaws, but he wasn’t
“What I don’t understand is everything else, why come here now? Surely you didn’t think I’d be awake, so what’s the point?”
“Potter, you don’t actually have to tell me-“ Draco stopped short as he realized that Harry seemed to
“I am not quite sure where to begin,” Draco said, more to buy himself time than actually seeking direction.
There were the books Hermione had left on one side of him, and still unconscious Harry on his other. With a quick glance around, Draco decided it would be alright for him to lay down for a little. Might as well, really. He slipped down in the bed, burrowing under the mussed sheets as much as he could.
Dark red tendrils floated around Young Malfoy, some thinner than others, but the strongest were clearly around his hands. However, that wasn’t what made McGonagall start. No, it was the thin band of gold that seemed to be tied within them. It was clearly not Draco’s own magic, and with the display that had occurred earlier she had a feeling that this small tie was part of the mystery.
It was easier to babble than it was to let the moment stand. The electricity that ran between them was almost unbearable at times- a devotion and love so grand, already proven so early in their relationship- well. It was difficult to find a balance between defeating Death in the name of love, and being two teens who could hardly hold hands in front of their friends.
“Harry Potter you did not hex a bunch of kids for checking on you!” Draco crowed, laughing harder as Harry tried to push him off his lap.
“You sop,” she teased, not even having to look behind her to know what Draco was watching. “You escort Potter into charms looking like a blushing maiden and here you are again looking every part besotted. If you’re not careful he might actually notice.”
“The charm of my company isn’t enough?” Draco teased, righting himself so Harry could reach his wand.
“Can we please not do this?” Draco asked wearily. To his chagrin Ron burst out laughing, and Hermione only barely managed to stifle her giggle.
presence might curb the brashness of these two! My mistake, one I shall not make again.” She drew in a breath.
“He deserves more,” Draco says, quietly. All the righteous fury that flooded him seconds earlier leaked out, shame and longing taking its place. “I know, that’s why-“
Granger seemed to have a similar reaction with the light, as it turned mauve around her hair and shoulders. Weasley, still staring at Harry, was unaware of the light blue tendrils that ensconced his waist.
Harry’s upticked eyebrow was the only indication Draco might need to rethink his question. The rising embarrassment as he realized what assumption he had just made wasn’t enough to get him to break eye contact with Harry’s gaze, but it was a close thing.
Draco scrambled to his knees, trying to force himself closer to where the dark haired boy laid in a heap on the grass.
When they finally released the snitch, it was like none of the events since their last match against each other had occurred. The two of them were neck and neck. Every time one of them caught a glimpse of gold they shot off, only seconds ahead of the other.
“Alright, as most of you are not in fact tied to Mister Potter, I believe you all have classes to be attending instead. If you feel ready, we will reconvene tomorrow to conduct this ritual with both myself and Poppy here to supervise. Miss Granger, you and Mister Weasley can inform me of what you’ve learned from your excursion after dinner.”
Scrawled in her neat handwriting was a set of three similar looking phrases. He read each carefully, but felt his breath catch on the last.
“In the morning they’ll probably try to pull your memory for the pensive, they already did for Weas- Ron, and Hermione. It… no one blames you, darling. It wasn’t your fault that Potter couldn’t-“
“The two of you may floo from my office.” She said, inclining her head towards the couple. She turned to face Pansy. “Miss Parkinson, can I trust you will stay here until they return?”
Instead, Pansy and Potter got on like a house on fire. Somehow in all their correspondence Draco hadn’t quite realized how
He watched as the ginger cast a patronus, telling it to fetch Madam Pomfrey. Draco realized this was almost the opposite of what happened in potions. Granger was clearly panicking while Weasley was the one quietly taking charge, trying to prompt Draco for what happened.
“Also, of course, you can’t say a bloody word about anything in the hospital wing, right? Harry’d be pissed if something got out.”
“You’re alright too, speccy git.” Draco said into Harry’s collarbone. He could feel the tendons in his neck flex as Harry grinned.
to tell him. It filtered through that he had said Granger and Weasley had each other- not that he had them to talk to, too.
“I’m led to believe in muggle weddings that’s part of their vows, we went over it in muggle studies not too long ago,” was Pansy’s confused reply.
Harry bit his lip as if it could stop the grin that broke over it, a combination of utter delight and a hint of smugness. Draco realized he’d been played, and tried to tug his hand out of the firm grip Harry had on it.
“Ah. Well. Long story short- when you fled from that thing in the forest, that was Quirrel who had Voldemort stuck on the back of his head. He was the one killing the unicorns, trying to keep ‘im alive an all.” There was a beat of silence where Weasley squirmed in his seat. “I forgot not everyone knows.”
“You might as well, if you’re going to be sticking around with this one,” came Weasley’s easy response.
Harry could be. Barbed responses flowed from his tongue as easily as laughter did, jests and jabs that met Pansy’s toe to toe.
“Potter I swear to Merlin if the next word out of your mouth is pretty, I will knock you back out myself,” Draco said, trying not to panic.
It hurt more than he was expecting it to. One summer and a handful of weeks was all it had taken for it to get this far. For his eyes to burn at the thought of Potter pulling away from him, for him to lose composure in relative public just at the notion that they couldn’t stay connected in the future. It was embarrassing, the hold Potter had over him.
“Alright Malfoy, let's go back to potions,” he said, hoping Harry would appreciate the effort it had taken not to refer to him as a ferret.
“She needs to see this, I think it means she’s on the right track. Though…” Pansy chewed her lip, something Draco hadn’t seen her do since she was fourteen and decided it was inelegant. He was struck once again with the shock of how close she and Harry had gotten, for her to be worried about him like this.
Harry could hear Draco now, trying to talk to him. They were only a meter or so apart, but the sound was muffled. Harry distantly realized that that might not be a good sign: he could feel his heart beating too fast, trying to keep up with the strain of creating and maintaining the net. He heard the voice remind him he would do
“Well done, Darling,” she began. “Not only did you manage to end up just as in love with Potter as ever, but you’ve also gone and found a worse scenario than our original fears.”
Could he make Potter understand without bearing too much of himself? He knew if he pulled away with no explanation that it would result in a confrontation- he’d seen enough of them from the Gryffindors over the years. If he had this secret goodbye, followed by some excuse to Potter later, would it be enough?
“I mean,” Draco continued,”I’m starting to get the picture with the muggle situation, which, sorry again, for being a prick about it, but you can’t honestly tell me that coming to school after nearly dying
He hadn’t really been expecting her to take a swing, but when the silence had stretched on well past what he could deem appropriate he cracked an eye open and was shocked to see Granger with tears streaming down her face.
She knew from her not-infrequent conversations with Harry that Draco had changed substantially from the abrasive boy he had been for most of his schooling. She had patiently listened to the way Harry ranted about the other eighth years tip-toeing around the blonde boy.
Which is why he was hiding in the library, forehead pressed to the cool wood of a table hidden near the runes books.
The thought struck him like lightning. He could do it now, while Potter was still asleep, get it out of his system and then begin to extricate himself. It would be a goodbye.
“Everyone. The papers, your bosses, your friends- fuck probably my friends, if they’re that upset with me. Blaise might even be first in line, and I can’t even blame him.” Draco’s defeated tone claws at Harry’s heart.
The next few weeks passed in a series of stops and starts. Draco got Pansy to be the one to tell Ha- Potter, about his resolve for them to use their last names, and in return got a reproachful glare from Granger every time he saw her.
All the little things he had tried not to notice, tried not to be in love with, jumped out at him. Harry’s hands, peppered with calluses from his wand and broom, seemed so strong. They were the hands of someone who clearly didn’t understand the importance of moisturizer, someone who might’ve had more important things to do. His eyelashes were long and dark, and Draco ached at the memory of how they made his green irises seem brighter by contrast.
Before either of them could say anything, Draco’s face split into a jaw cracking yawn. Pansy’s expression immediately softened.
letting him forget this,” said a faraway voice. It sounded entirely too gleeful, putting Draco on edge.
He closed his eyes. It was bad enough, still enveloped in Harry’s warm embrace, but if he had to meet the searching, the yearning that was so apparent on his face, he knew his resolve would break.
Draco screamed when the force holding him up gave way, dropping him unceremoniously when he was a meter from the ground. He hit the grass with enough force that the wind knocked out of him, but his mind was stuck on Harry.
“I don’t want you to do the ritual.” She said, not hiding the sharp edge to her voice. Let him wonder if it was worry or anger. She wasn’t entirely sure herself.
“I want you to hear me, okay? I’m not worried about people finding out about anything related to us. I’ve been undesirable number one, supposed heir of slytherin, and all other ridiculous things. If you’re worried about how these rumors or reactions might affect me- don’t. I want to make sure I’m understanding that that’s what your worry is.”
“No! You can’t leave, every time you get more than a half meter from him he stops breathing again,” Weasley said in a rush. “Don’t you remember?”
They stayed like that for several long moments, silently soaking up each other’s warmth. Harry sighed before speaking again.
Draco sighed, suddenly wishing he had saved his panic for tomorrow. If he had, he might’ve been able to convince Harry to let him sleep in the comfort of his lap. Slowly he disentangled himself, aware that this might be the last time he could be so close to the dark haired boy. He let himself give Harry’s curls one last brush before bidding the boy goodnight, and making his way out of the infirmary.
There’s a containment bubble around their cauldron: strong enough to be visible to the naked eye, and yet a quick survey of the class shows no one has their wand out. In fact, aside from Slughorn and Potter, hardly anyone is looking at their cauldron, too busy tending to their own even as they titter about.
“I fell the last two feet onto the pitch and then went to check on Harry. When I touched him he was…” he didn’t want to say. Even though he could feel Harry next to him, radiating warmth, could see the slow rise and fall of his chest, it felt like uttering the word
“Pomfrey was casting spell after spell trying to figure out what happened. McGonagall came in and got Hermione and I to put our memories of it into a pensive, but any time we tried to ask you for one there was, well…”
If Draco was being honest, he hadn’t expected a reply. He had been ungracious in the immediate aftermath of the battle when Potter returned his wand to him. Tension was high, and it had only taken “I guess I don’t need this anymore,” to fall from Potter’s lips before Draco swung at him. The Wizengamont calling his name as someone testifying on his behalf was already too much, a reply to an obviously coerced olive branch was unthinkable.
“In essence,” she started, as if every word pained her to say. “We have to try different chants until Harry wakes, or one ruins Mister Malfoy? Ritual chants are not magic to be taken lightly, old magic is hardly safe-“
They stayed like that for a moment, Draco breathing in the reassurance, the strength of his best friend, while she tried very hard not to be angry with him.
“The last thing you remember is touching him, just before Gr- Hermione,” Pansy corrected when Weasley shot her a look, “got there?”
Class revision sucked Harry’s attention away from Malfoy’s profile, and any time it seemed to draw him in again Hermione's sharp elbow to his side quickly brought him back to the task at hand. It turned out that returning for NEWTS was rather interesting.
“I know you’re going to do it anyway,” Pansy said. “And I know that the list of people you care about enough to be so stupid for is small, so I won’t bother lecturing you on infectious self-sacrificing tendencies. But if this happens again?” The warning was clear. More of a threat, really, but Draco felt loved all the same.
be alone, when it happens. Sometimes I’d wake up with Ron hauling me out of bed because I’d’ve started a fire in the drapes, or, um, there was one time that Kreacher woke me up because I had accidentally forced him to apparate near me, but he was supposed to be at Hogwarts, and Hermione always says-“
Harry waited to see if Draco had worn himself out before saying, “I had you this time, plus I got to be asleep for a lot of the scary bits. Essentially a luxury for me.”
Hermione nodded, looking as if she wanted to share more. Draco was just about to ask her to continue when Madam Pomfrey spoke up.
“I cannot say anything conclusive. I know Mr. Potter has expressed a desire for open communication, but until he regains consciousness I do not feel comfortable conjecturing any further. Now, if one of you could stay here with him while I find Minerva…” Madam Pomfrey took one last sweeping look at Harry before turning out of the infirmary.
“I- we, won’t last. Our friendship, our… our anything. They won’t let us. You’ll become an auror and every day they’ll badger you about me, I’m a threat to you, to the life you should live, and Harry- I couldn’t make it. If you were any deeper in my skin, and you pulled away, it would break me. I’m already too close- I came to see if I could make myself say goodbye, but you-“ Draco let out a shaky breath, and that was the last straw for Harry.
“Well it doesn’t really matter, I know McGonagal wants to wait but we don’t know how long your tie to him is going to last, plus if this round doesn’t work we need to know sooner so we can find some other avenue,” Hermione said, as if it were entirely reasonable to perform a potentially dangerous ritual without the extra support of other very accomplished wix. “And really, we would’ve tried it earlier if she hadn’t been so worried, so it’s not like we weren’t patient.”
“Oh,” Harry said, as if it all made sense. It did, in some ways, but not enough that he was satisfied. He was, however, able to be more patient with his questions afterwards.
If Draco had not just caught a fainting savior he might’ve had the wherewithal to decipher this expression as a cross between resigned acceptance and worry, but as it happened he had just caught the chosen one after an incredible display of…
Draco pulling away when they had discussed it was one thing, but the two-dimensional shadow that had come back into the common room that day was another. More than once Pansy had tried to interrogate him, demanding answers, assuming he had done something to cause it, but Harry didn’t know what it could be.
Madam Pomfrey seemed to know what he was asking, and shook her head solemnly, her lips pursed into a tight frown.
“Alright, I’m going to do the core test as well, are you ready?” Poppy’s voice brought Minerva out of her reverie just in time to see her wand swish.
Harry smiled at his partner, happy to let him re-trod this argument for what must’ve been the third time since they’d been released from Madam Pomfrey’s care.
While defense still came most naturally to him, certain charm and transfiguration work seemed to flow more easily than they ever had before. Runes, potions, and herbology seemed to flourish under his hands. Hermione said it had to do with the practical application he had done during their year on the run, but Ron believed defeating Voldemort had “done him a bit of good” in terms of letting him focus. Harry privately thought they were both correct, however whenever the subject came up he just shrugged and said it was probably all the fruit McGonnall plied him with.
