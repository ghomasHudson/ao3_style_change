Draco matched his smile. “Not from one apple, you wouldn’t.”
“A colleague of mine, Luc Reynard, had gone to Annecy for a holiday and wound up queuing behind him at a patisserie in Mentheon-Saint-Bernard. He’d done a bit of research on the war for his work on curse-related scarring and recognised the face. Waited until Rookwood left the shop, cast an Incarcerous, end of. Consider Potter’s fame relative to Rookwood’s. How long do you think it would take for someone to notice him? For word to get out?”
“And you were right.” Draco attempts a smile. In the corner of his eye, he sees Harry looking back and forth between them, shocked, but smiling.
That seemed to throw him, the thought that I might be nervous, too. It wasn’t a question of physical capacity, or any worry that he might have injured me, as he later confessed to having suspected. Just a bit of anxiety at the thought of it. The possibility that, after all of this, he might somehow find this part of things to be lacking.
“If you want it back, please do let me know.” He took it and tucked it into his robes.
“Um,” he mutters, and he tightens it without realising. Merlin help me, it’s got dimples when he does that. “I...yeah?”
Draco nodded. “It must be. It must be amplifying his magic. Not the way the implants do, but…somehow. There’s evidence in the work under review to suggest that the presence of an implant may have some amplifying effect on magical ability. I can only imagine, with the Elder Wand….” He trailed off, trying to wrap his head around the implications.
“A portion
“Good morning, Potter.” He plasters a smile over his shock. “To what do we owe the honour?”
“Yeah.”
“Not usually, but there’s a new litter of kittens, half-cat, half-Kneazle.” He thought he saw Potter’s brow soften, then firm up again. “I’m checking on them.”
“Yeah, because I give a damn about someone other than myself! Lots of someones! No wonder it’s such a mystery to you.”
“That’s a vast oversimplif—” Malfoy stopped.
“Thanks.” He brushes his fingers over mine as he accepts the glass. “Didn’t know you were moonlighting.”
There it is again. Potter’s staring. Not quite staring, though. It’s got sort of a tender edge to it and the corners of his mouth are turning up. Draco turns away. “There are some similar artefacts, however, that do technically belong to your estate, some of which may have been in the attic.”
“An area of expertise. Have to be quite careful with some of the things we get.”
“I suspect the chances of that will decrease once you start meeting with the Mind Healer. If not, I know the risks, and I’m good with a wand, if it comes to that.”
Potter laughed amiably. “Whatever the reason, please accept my gratitude.”
It was undeniable, though. He had felt it. It had shades of the tension that had always been there between them. That wasn’t really a surprise, not truly. It made a certain sort of sense that their enmity would engender a certain sort of understanding.
“Merlin,” Potter breathed.
“Oh?”
Which is why, with Potter’s arrival imminent, he’s wearing his robes while he addresses a few routine Thursday morning arrivals. Unfortunately, the careless bint who’s Vanished a bad container of yoghurt has other designs for his wardrobes. Foodstuffs are supposed to be Banished, of course, but it’s hardly news to Draco that those sorts of details elude most anyone who didn’t grow up with them and some who did. He’s required to Scourgify, so Scourgify he does. But he’s got to lift the lid and peel back the foil to do it properly, and as soon as he releases the pressure that’s been building inside the container a lump of yoghurt spurts over the edge of the cup and lands, gloppy and dripping, on the front of his robes.
“Perhaps we could do it in here,” Potter offered.
“Come now, Greg is waiting.” Pansy turned on her heel and strode off without looking back.
I may’ve laughed. At least, I think I did. He smiled and it was…fairly blinding. Distracting. Engaging.
“Muggles call them spoonbills,” said Dean. “You could try that. Magical spoonbills.”
He begins to pull items down, listing them as he levitates them into a row at Potter’s feet. “One troll-arm coat rack. One Hand of Glory.”
Harry took the hint, and pressed a kiss to the spot just under his jaw, and another below that, and then another.
“I’m sorry—really, very genuinely sorry—to agree.”
He thinks the two just about balance out. And as the Howlers begin to taper off, he’s more and more convinced that he’s getting the better end of the deal.
I’ve therefore had to find ways to initiate encounters in his fan club’s presence. This, of course, has put Granger especially a bit on alert, and I’ve had to contrive unfortunate pretenses for initiating contact.
Draco turned back. “Already?”
“These ought not be shrunk for transportation.”
“Fuck me. I want you to fuck me.”
“Do you feel any tingling or numbness?”
Penelope moved along quickly. “Please describe the evidence you recovered from the accused’s residence.”
“Such a shame. Hard to run a household when you know so little about the tools at your disposal.”
. His eyes were open. Sleep was a distant memory. Potter was on his shoulder.
“Well, yeah. It’s almost lunch time.”
“Yeah.”
“A bar or a club?”
The front office door is still ugly, but it’s not as ugly as the troll leg umbrella stand.
“Are you going to hex me if I turn around to give them to you?”
Harry pulls self-consciously at his own robes, which hang open and are, he knows, just a bit rumpled. “Hi.”
Malfoy’s voice grew cool and his eyes narrowed. “You really aren’t listening, are you? You asked a question, I’ve done you the courtesy of answering, and you can’t even be bothered to pay attention. What is it, Potter? Too busy disregarding those wizards whom you think are beneath you? Where have I heard that logic before?”
“No.” Draco tenses his fingers around Harry’s wrist and shifts his hips under Harry’s. “No, that’s not what I meant.”
“The first of three papers has been accepted for this spring’s volume of the
“But, what’s here?”
His cock twitched against the air, and Draco wanted it in his mouth, wanted to taste it, suck it. Draco moved, his breath ghosting over it. It jerked again, straining for touch, and Draco’s own erection reacted in kind. He bent closer, urged on by Harry’s nails digging into him, and pressed a kiss to the bottom of it.
“Maybe he bothered going because he hoped you’d be there,” Pansy offered.
“You know.” Harry flushed. “I was… It felt good. I was wanting, I guess. Didn’t think it was especially subtle.”
“Somehow,” Hermione piped up from behind him, “I suspect that Harry means Malfoy’s involvement in the procurement and display of Muggle art, particularly as intended for a mixed Muggle and wizarding audience and requiring quite a lot of unusual security.”
“I’m not doing anything,” Draco insists, “beyond improving the reputation of this paper.”
“Can you think of another pattern?”
There was no reason for Draco to help with them. Just a bunch of old family photos, most likely, and Potter would want privacy for those. As is quite reasonable. It’s rude for Draco to be curious about what Potter would have looked like as a small child or what he did with his friends, or who else might appear prominently in the photos next to him, their arms around one another.
Draco’s hips bucked forward, and then Potter pulled away. Draco whined at the loss before he could think better of it.
He rests a hand on the door, not quite up for pushing just yet. It’s 9:57 and part of him wonders if, if he just waits until ten, if they can pretend it’s a normal morning and ignore the rest.
“Sure. That was the point, right?”
"Right," Draco managed. His throat was tight. "Sounds great."
“No?”
By two, Draco had managed half a sandwich and not much else. He thought about calling Granger and trying to convince her, which might well be the best way to convince Potter, but her position on the whole thing remained a bit mysterious. He thought about taking a walk of the grounds in advance of his meeting with Potter, which did at least set him to thinking about what he wanted it to accomplish. If Potter was worried about his destructive power, Draco had an inkling about what might change his mind. At least plant a seed of doubt.
He’s pretty sure he can feel Draco watching him all the way down the aisle, though maybe he’s just imagining it because when he peeks out of the corner of his eye, Draco’s intent on the books in front of him.
Draco rolls back; he wants Harry to know it, too.
They repeated the ritual twice more, and Harry was beginning to wonder whether Malfoy was going to talk to him at all, or what Malfoy might do if he asked.
Underneath the spotlight, Draco was as inscrutably stone-faced as Harry had ever seen him. He sat tall and proud, every inch a Malfoy, even against the weight of the shackles that bound his forearms and ankles to his chair.
“Because?” Blaise asks. “That’s not much of a reason.”
Draco still watches him. Seated astride the fence, the cloak spilling over to either side, Harry watches back.
He snorted and shook his head. “It’s a job, not a romance novel.”
“Oh.” Draco is almost light-headed with relief. This doesn’t seem like a prelude to a bigger confession. Though, his lingering queasiness reminds him, Harry could be trying to break Marcel to him gently. He clears his throat. “It’s fine. Slow day. Do you want to fill out the forms or come back and look yourself?”
So, plank staining is in my future. And awkward attempts at détente with his friends. Another apology to Longbottom. Finding out whether my fellow Slytherins will come round on a permanent basis, beyond Goyle’s suspicious, tentative lurking and Blaise’s total laissez-faire that counts more as not giving a fuck than any sort of actual support. I suppose I have to give Harry that one, that his friends have stuck by him. Makes them seen worth apologising to, nowadays.
“Yeah. I know, I know. ‘How do you Vanish things by accident, Potter, you idiot?’ I know. I was–there’s no class today, and I still need to work on the attic, and I was going through my school trunk and meant to Banish a few things, you know. Sweet wrappers, old parchment. But I sneezed and accidentally sort of…switched spells and re-aimed halfway through, and I’m sorry I even have to ask, really, I am.”
Harry didn’t even try to sleep. He threw on a coat and walked outside as soon as he got home. The streets were close to empty around Grimmauld Place, which might have been the only thing keeping him from walking into someone as he found himself, every few minutes, scanning the sky in increasingly unsubtle hopes of seeing an owl perched in the bare branches, or maybe Edgar himself, or hell, some other lost spoonbill. He wondered if there were magical egrets or terns that might find some fateful way to get lost in London.
Blaise’s smile is broad and genuine. “Who else could compare? You just know.”
Harry willed himself to lean back and drop his hands casually to the armrests. "Did you like fucking my arse, Malfoy?"
“Talking to people makes him blow things up?” Blaise asked
“Am I?” Potter raises an eyebrow rather rakishly.
“Certainly not.”
“No, that’s fine. Draco.” He said it slowly, testing it out. “Draco.” He hummed. “It’s a bit strange. Not your name,” he rushed to add, ”but saying it. Was it weird for you?”
Then Malfoy was behind him, the heat of his body covering Harry and the bulge in his trousers pressing into his arse and a gravelly whisper in his ear. “Save the world, Potter. I want to see you do it with my cock up your arse.”
“Believe what you want, but do it elsewhere.”
Potter cries out and shudders when Draco runs his tongue up his shaft and then takes Potter in his mouth.
“It wasn’t just to interrogate me on my soulmate?”
The guard pushed him onto a bench outside, and then spelled his cuffs to stick to it. He sat there, running over the plans for his defense in his head. He stared at his feet, trying not to think of the cramp forming from the way his arms were held across his body.
Malfoy’s eyebrows shot up, his hand stopped rubbing/scratching at the mark. “Oh.”
“I don’t think you did anything wrong. He’s the one who forced you into the fight,” she noted, “I think you should try talking to him again. Try and figure out what you have in common.”
“I can, actually,” Narcissa spoke up first. Draco whipped his head to look at her, and her face was colder than he’d ever seen it. “I can’t believe you have the audacity to come here and act as if you have any right to be treated better than any other criminal. You made the choices that led us here. You gave up your family for a cause that lost. You gave up our
Walking through the atrium, a great feeling of shame filled him. People were staring at him, glancing at his exposed left arm. His mark was on display. He wanted to throw up. He wished he could cross his arms or something, anything to cover it. The stares followed them all the way to the entrance to the Wizengamot.
Draco nodded. “You’re welcome.”
Draco swallows. “Or a dance?”
Just a house, Draco repeated to himself. “Just a house.”
Malfoy scowled. “Problem, Potter? We have a vested interest in keeping the texts safe. The Ministry isn’t secure enough and Gringotts is too inaccessible. With the exception of this outing, that’s where they stay.”
And there, to his right, were the green, gold-lettered signs of the Meurice. He balled the parchment in his fist. An executive suite, Mill had said, on the fourth floor. He checked again in the lift. 426.
“Is it more or less strange that I’m enjoying yours as well?”
Harry snorted. “Do I? It didn’t feel that way.”
Harry frowned. “He fell out of the sky, clearly in need of help, and then just disappears? It’s not unreasonable to want to know how he is.”
“I do.”
“They’re all important.”
Harry looked up, startled.
“Oh. Right.”
“You could go for a run later, or we could do this again sometime.”
ask before you try anything of the sort,” Draco retorted, mock-indignant.
I lowered the volume and suggested it had been a friendly bit of assistance, in deference to his injury.
”I was balls deep in your arse a minute ago."
Draco doesn’t know how to answer that. He doesn’t. He doesn’t really want Potter to go. But telling him to stay is out of the question.
Draco doesn’t turn around. “Do you mean to suggest that you buy books?”
“Okay.” Harry ruffled his hair and dropped his hand. “Thank you. Really.”
—how to do this. Harry will hit a wall at the end of the aisle he’s chosen, he’ll have to circle round, and Draco will get there first.
“Okay.”
“Right. Well. As I said, Millicent and Granger came to see me. They had discovered a point of miscommunication in need of straightening out, and…” Draco sighed. “I’m afraid this is going to be an uncomfortable conversation for both of us. If you’ll forgive the informality, colloquialisms might prove useful here.”
He leaves the flip for last. Tests the cloak every way he can think of first. It’ll let him sit easily enough. He can move from one place to another. Spinning’s a bit of a trick; the cloak gets tangled in his feet and it’s so much energy to free them that criminals would have too much of a chance to get away.
Potter snorted. “So bloody obsessed with magic. More pureblood mania, is it? Nothing’s worth anything unless it’s got magic.”
was dangerous, to George, to everyone who came near the shop, it got so crowded.

“Er, no, I – sorry.”
“Alright, okay. Shag of my life, and all that.”
Ron turned to the room, a bit sheepishly and with dripping hands. “‘Mione told me about it. They make tiny, tiny bits of string and you run them between your teeth. Instead of a cleaning spell. Muggle children learn it, right?” He glanced back at Hermione.
He looks up at Draco who is…a lot more expectant looking than he would’ve expected.
“What if this foundation became that place?”
“That’s settled then. One year of probation,” Shacklebolt banged his gavel twice, “Court dismissed.”
It was the closest Malfoy had come to admitting he did want to come back, and wasn’t just doing it because he felt he had to. Although, maybe his definition of good news was different from Harry’s.
“That’s a good idea.”
He put his glasses on, and sat up on the edge of his bed, his feet flat on the floor. Hermione would be proud of him for getting out of bed so quickly. He did a quick breathing exercise she had recommended to him - in through the nose, out through the mouth, ten times. It was meant to ‘center him’ and prepare him for the day ahead. It was the first day he had no trials to attend. It was meant to be his relaxing day in, a day fully to himself, but now he had some other things to deal with.
“What do you say? Are you definitely coming back?”
Malfoy chuckled, “Yea, I suppose Pansy and Blaise would’ve left as soon as possible. But if they’re invited, I bet they’d come back.”
“I assume that’s a yes? She’s sending out the official invitations today. Ron and I were already planning to go.”
Potter entered the pit in front of the overwhelming presence of the entire Wizengamot. He approached the podium, an automatic
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Always the fucking martyr. You had every right to assume that was true. I didn’t give any indication it wasn’t, until I said so. Anyway. What's the situation going to be with other Slytherins returning?” He sat back down on the bed, this time gesturing for Harry to join him.
Draco felt like he was on a roller coaster. He had woken up that morning in Azkaban, and now was being offered a space to live with his soulmate, who just happened to be fucking
“Mr. Boy Who Lived!” Harry exclaimed, laughing again. Malfoy’s face was alight with laughter, a way Harry hadn’t seen it in years.
Harry stood up, brushing the tops of his thighs for invisible dirt, stalling. He turned back when he reached the door, smiling at Malfoy, who was still sitting cross legged on the bed. “See you later.”
Draco woke up with a jolt, someone banging on his cell door.
, lighting Harry’s face. He looked down then, and for the first time seemed to notice the position they were in. His eyes widened, and he climbed down quickly. Harry thought he could see a flush rising up his neck, but he cast
Hermione nodded at him, “You were both quite preoccupied with each other in school.”
“Mr. Saviour of the World.”
over going through with the orders he had. “I considered death almost every day. But I knew once I was dead, my family would suffer even more for my betrayal.” His voice cracked, throat closing around a sob. He blinked back tears forming in his eyes.
“Well. That’s not very promising.”
“I’ll see you around.” Malfoy said, moving to leave.
“Seriously, Malfoy! You have to disarm me.” Harry went and grabbed his wand, holding it out for him to take.
“Yes, yes, Hermione, we know. You can change it all when you’re Minister for Magic,” Potter teased, nudging her. Granger rolled her eyes at him, smirking.
sosei somnium -
Malfoy looked at him blankly, his mouth set in a solid line. “Thank you for that distinction.”
“Thank you. You didn’t have to.”
“What if I don’t want to?”
The dream continued in kind, members of the court asking Potter questions upon questions about what he witnessed Draco do. There were things that were just impossible for him to know, like his cowardice in front of Voldemort, the way his
“I brought it up.”
“No, Potter. Fight me for it.”
He placed the bottle on his bedside and stared at it. He placed his glasses next to it. He grabbed his wand, cast a quick
Narcissa hugged back tightly, stroking the back of his head as he sobbed. Her body shook slightly as she cried too, and she took deep breaths directly in his ear. He squeezed her tighter and tighter, scared to let go. He wasn’t completely convinced that he wouldn’t wake up in Azkaban if he looked up again.
But the morning of June 6th, 1998, the day after he turned 18, the dementor’s slid by and none of these horrible images came to mind. Instead, it was a feeling of horrible, aching dread.
“First order of business. The court has agreed that due to the fact that your entire family was involved in this war, reparations must be paid. Malfoy Manor will be seized. In addition, you will have to pay out your vaults until you are left with a maximum of 5,000 galleons or every single victim from the war has received their fair due. Every family involved is paying as such,” Shacklebolt announced. Draco swallowed tightly. He knew in his heart that the manor would most likely be seized, but 5,000 galleons? That was so little. His entire way of life, everything he had known, would shift. If he stayed out of Azkaban, that is.
“Good. And I’ll see you on Friday.” She winked and said, “The burrow!” before being whisked away.
They stared at each other for a moment, green and grey eyes locked. Draco blinked a few times, looking at the ground. Potter didn’t seem disturbed by the idea. In fact he seemed almost....okay with it. Draco ventured to ask the question, “And what does that mean? For you?”
There was no way the court would agree, Shacklebolt was simply being optimistic, giving him false hope-
The dementors could see all the way into the deepest and darkest parts of his brain, the fears he had never even acknowledged with the war going on. They taunted him with his guilt, day after day reminding him of the horrific things he’d bore witness to, the things he’d done.
“Count of three?” Harry offered, slipping his finger under the lip of his envelope so he was ready to open it. Malfoy did the same and nodded.
As he got closer to the kitchen, he could hear Malfoy and Narcissa talking, which was unusual. He stepped into the kitchen to hear Narcissa say-
I'm so glad I'm able to post this chapter today! Enjoy!
The dream continued as Potter made himself dinner, eating alone in the large house. He opened a bottle of Ogden’s whiskey and poured a steep glass, knocking it back quickly, and then refilled it.
“I hate to break up this heartfelt family moment,” the guard began. Draco cast his eyes to the floor. A united front was the way Malfoy’s had always been- the picture-perfect pureblood family. So much had changed in such a short period of time. “-but it’s time to begin. If you would all follow me.”
“How are you?” Harry responded as he sat down, Kreacher immediately placing a plate in front of him. Harry began levitating the food to his plate.
. Draco nodded quickly, turning back to his father. Lucius was as shocked as he was, maybe more so. His mouth hung open like a fish, and he floundered for something to say. Draco schooled his jaw, “She’s right. You were wrong, father. You have to admit that, or you will die in Azkaban. You might die there anyway.”
She smirked as Harry’s heart stuttered in his chest. He could return to Hogwarts in two weeks, if he choose to. He wouldn’t have to go right into the Aurors. He could have a somewhat normal school year. “Oh my god.” He was aghast. Hermione took his hand again.
He didn’t expect the early days of his trial to go well. He wouldn’t be present, and that meant he wouldn’t even know exactly what to refute. So he planned to talk mostly about his remorse. No excuses, just regrets. He would tell the stories of the moments he regretted most, and why, and hope that was enough to save him from a lifetime in Azkaban.
“No, no. You’re perfectly safe up there. No poisonous furniture.”
This chapter contains themes of self harm and anxiety attacks.
Draco Malfoy would die alone, and it would be wholly justified.
“I mean, sure, but just because you have this weird obsession with him doesn’t mean he doesn’t deserve Azkaban.”
His mother pulled back first, gripping his shoulders. She looked in his eyes and wiped the tears from under them. He sniffed in a breath, before releasing it shakily. “I can’t believe it,” he whispered.
She grabbed his arm and pulled him out of the cell roughly. He stumbled along with her, looking up and down the line of cells near him. His mind kept returning to his dream the previous night, the impossibility of Potter defending him. He wondered how his trial had actually gone. Who had attended, who had railed against him and his family.
“No! No, not at all. I wanted to see if you wanted to come back, too.”
Harry chuckled in spite of himself, then told her the events that transpired when he gave Malfoy his wand back. She considered it for a moment.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I will never be Minister for Magic. The only thing more corrupt than Wizarding Prison is Wizarding Government.”
“Harry, I’ve made breakfast. Come down and join us,” Narcissa said from outside, and then her footsteps left. He didn’t seem to have a choice. He quickly pulled on some sweatpants and a tank top, and tried to make his hair somewhat presentable.
“Believe it.” Narcissa smiled, slightly sadly. He nodded, trying to regain control of his breathing and his emotions. His mother looked over his shoulder, “There is someone we have to thank for this.”
When it seemed like every moment of his life had been rehashed, including his younger interactions with Potter, which Potter seemed just as annoyed about as he was. Of course, he was a pompous asshole when he was twelve, he was
“Who’s your soulmate? I assume that’s why you disappeared directly after your 18th birthday?” She gave him a pointed look, and he realized how stupid he’d been to underestimate her. Of course she already knew his reasoning, she’s Hermione. He shook his head and let out a breath, running his hand through his hair. The barista delivered their drinks, giving him a few extra seconds to gather himself.
Not to mention all those weird thoughts about his hair and eyes gleaming in the sun, or noticing how thin he got sixth year, or noticing his height (Yesterday was the first time Harry was taller than him. It was a little strange. A little nice.), or the times he had to stop his eyes from lingering on his arse.
“Anyway. She told me that McGonagall is inviting anyone who didn’t get a chance to finish their time at Hogwarts back this year. I want to go back, but I wanted to talk to you about it before the invitations came today.”
It was a small box, and upon opening it he saw a small bottle with a cork stopper in it. It was much wider at the bottom, and fit comfortably in his palm. In script, in gold ink, written on the bottle were the words “My Soulmate.” Further investigation into the box saw a small piece of paper.
, and was somehow still in denial about the consequences.
Harry pursed his lips. He had selfishly hoped that Malfoy would want to attend Hogwarts again. “I’m still going to go, but you’ll be welcome to stay here.”
Harry definitely looked like an idiot, jaw slack, trying to gather his thoughts. There was a reason for him being here, but it escaped him now. All he could think about was his surprising desire to kiss every scar on Malfoy’s chest, right up to his lips.
“It’s a surprise? Just come upstairs with me.” Harry wanted to see Malfoy’s reaction to getting his wand back, for some reason it felt private. Malfoy nodded, but still seemed hesitant as he followed Harry to his room.
Narcissa went next, placing her hands in front of her on the podium, folded together. She spoke about her regrets, about letting Voldemort into their home, but feeling as if she had no other choice. She defended Draco more than herself, crying through the stories of watching her son do unimaginable things for her sake. Despite the shaking of her voice, her body stayed very still.
The guard waved his wand, detaching their cuffs from the bench, and then relinking them to an invisible rope extending from his belt. Arms awkwardly in front of them, the Malfoy’s walked into the courtroom.
He ate breakfast. Small, hot oatmeal, but food. He could taste it more than any other dream before. The pumpkin juice seemed to actually soothe his dry throat.
“Malfoy.” Potter nodded at him. “Mrs. Malfoy.”
He was going to die alone, here, shivering on the concrete floor barely staying alive. Nourishment spells only did so much. His mouth was dry for lack of water, and his ribs were visible through his shirt. He counted them each day in an effort to keep sane. If he looked at his ribs he wouldn’t think so much about tearing off his left forearm.
“Same.” Harry took a bite of his dinner, smirking back at Malfoy. “I’m hoping there’s good news.”
“France is ‘nothing special,’ are you serious? I mean- wait. Are you planning to come then? If they will?”
“Draco, Narcissa, can you believe the audacity they have to shove me around? As if I don’t know the proceedings of this court. I served on it for decades,” Lucius huffed, turning to his family for sympathy.
please read the end notes there's some important info!
“What if he isn’t even invited though?”
. Next to it laid Harry’s wand and the Hawthorne one he had been holding onto since the end of the war. Suddenly he remembered the events of the day prior.
go back. He would rather die than end up there, wallowing away for the rest of his life. Just those two months would require so much healing.
When he gave it a good amount of thought, it made some sense, Potter being his soulmate. Everything in his life had always revolved around Potter. Even before he had
Harry was standing there, just glancing around the room, when Malfoy took a seat on the bed with his legs crossed under him. “Out with it, then.”
“It was nice to sleep on a bed again, for sure. Thank you,” Malfoy finally said, before turning his head back to his plate.
The door swung open. Malfoy was standing there, pajama bottoms slung low on his waist, no shirt on, arms crossed over his chest. Harry’s breath was gone too quickly for his own liking. His eyes drifted down Malfoy’s chest, ghosting over the faint scars there, down to the line of his joggers.
– Know better. Not close enough to Potter.
The stairwell always felt chilly; it was too much metal and concrete to feel truly warm, even when the temperature was perfectly reasonable. But it rarely felt as freezing as it did to Draco after Potter disappeared down the stairs. He was sticky and cold and he couldn’t figure out what to do with himself—how to stand, where to go, whether it mattered that he appear nonchalant if no one was there to see it.
Harry pulled forward and then pushed back, jarring Malfoy into a rhythm. Harry raised his head and muttered, “More.”
“Oh.” Harry’s shoulders sagged, and the rest of his body fought the urge to go with them. “Right. Did.”
There’s a second’s pause. Draco sees Harry’s knuckles whiten as he begins to pull up.
“I’ll cast a shield first thing if anything happens.”
“I suppose.” Pansy pursed her lips. “But promise you won’t let him walk all over you, or misinterpret? Cook things up for the Ministry?”
“Over there, love.” She waved him towards a fruit bowl. “Eat. I want to hear everything.”
Almost a minute passed before Potter broke. “What are you doing?”
Draco hummed. “Worth a try. What do you remember?”
When we finished, he traced the scar that lingers on my chest. Kissed it. He joked that X marks the spot. The spot being my heart. His sense of humour is completely awful. Totally plebeian and hackneyed. But he seems so pleased with himself that it’s really best left alone.
“But you won’t consider having him leave.”
Harry huffed another shaky laugh and nodded. She asked a question. He gestured to the untouched tea tray. She shook her head and said something and they both snickered.
The sentiment sat heavy in the room.
Harry smiled at that. “Right. I can’t honestly say I’m sorry, can I? Not when it was so important. Or, um. When I’m not sorry.”
“Was, past tense.”
He nods.
“Oh—” Harry began.
“Yes.” Draco reached into his robes and pulled out Potter’s wand.
” Harry trailed off into a long hiss as Malfoy suddenly thrust forward, burying himself in Harry entirely and sending sparks shooting up Harry’s spine. “
“Yes?” The muscles in Draco’s shoulders tighten even more. He steps further away from the bed, reaching out to finger the cloak where it was thrown over a chair in last night’s mad dash to disrobe.
Draco leaned forward, kissed his bottom lip. “Anything.”
Harry shook his head and bent towards her, on the verge of offering reassurances.
“Want you. I want you.”
“Oh, do shut up. Do you want grocery, or shall we move on to liquor?”
Draco stares at him for a long moment. Then he goes back to rearranging his pile of parchment.
and an
“It seems you’re tolerably well behaved and reasonably clever.”
Malfoy gasped and tried to thrust into his mouth, only to have Harry pull away, swirling his tongue around Malfoy’s tip and wrapping a hand around his shaft.
“Mmm.”
Reaching into some reserves of strength, Draco forced himself to stand. “Walk with me.” He moved towards the door, fully aware of his stiltedness and unable to spare concern for anything other than putting one foot in front of the other.
-- -- --
The blade scrapes against the shelf. He doesn’t want to let go of it, not in the middle of a job. He has work to do and it makes a hell of a lot more sense than Potter’s strange confessions. “Forged by—”
“Against you?”
“One, I can spell perfectly well, thank you. Two, I’ve been yelling for you from outside for ages. Three, it’s not a pile of rubbish.”
“Nothing,” Draco lies. “Just ensuring the correct identification.”
“Tired.” Another faint smile.
“As it is, however,” he pushes Potter into the shelving. “As it is, we need only be concerned with yours.”
With my flies undone, I moved up the bed, pulling him with me and shucking my trousers in the process. He ran a hand up the inside of my thigh with a look I can best describe as wonder. He stopped short of my pants, withdrawing his hand and looking to me for some sign of what to do next.
Blackmailing the Deputy Head Auror once was—well, much riskier than he’d realised at the time, and probably best kept to a one-off.
Draco began to cast. He checked Potter’s magical energy levels, looking for spikes or discontinuities as Potter cooled down. There were magical traces coming from the implant itself, but nothing unexpected.
Currently occupying Potter’s favorite window seat again. He keeps looking my way. How
“Would you believe me if I did?”
He gives a guttural moan. “Yeah, fuck. Big as your cock, perfect.”
“What do you mean?”
Draco blinked, then, laughed softly. “I tend to anyway.”
His Apparition became quite a bit stronger, at least.
Harry stared.
“His life, his job. This possible accidental magic. Everything.”
"Ready when you are," Draco answered.
“It’s going well? If you don’t mind my asking. It’s fine, of course, if you’d rather not talk about it.”
“Um.” The flush on Harry’s cheeks deepened. “Not in the end, no.”
They’re only a few yards into the aisle before it begins. “This,” Draco points about three shelves over, “To that.”
“Peace,” Draco said again. That, too, felt true, though he’d never said it before. Redemption, setting things right…those had always seemed like the sorts of things a person could fight for, could talk about fighting for. But this was true too, and it settled, easy and light, into his bones.
Two of the owls have started sharing a nest. Looked like a new addition to the Owlery at first, huddled so closely their feathers are indistinguishable.
Harry pulled at his hair, groaning, and leaned against the wall next to Malfoy’s door. Okay. He could do this. He could have an adult conversation with his soulmate about their future. He just has to knock.
~~~~~~
“The Chosen Boy,” Malfoy added through giggles, then rolled his eyes. He seemed to be enjoying the moment but also slightly bewildered.
Shacklebolt nodded once. “I’ll pass the questions off to McLaggen.”
“Oh yeah, the things we have in common. Being forced into a war too young. Trauma from that war. Feeling responsible for the tragedy of war-”
“Well that’s good to hear.” Malfoy smirked at him. It was so nice to see him even a little happy, instead of the gloomy face he usually wears to meals.
“I’m. Bad at this. I’m sorry, I don’t know how to be nice to you,” Harry tried to explain. Malfoy just sighed, rolling his eyes. He crossed his arms over his chest and stared at Harry. “I know that sounds crazy. But it’s just a big adjustment. I’ve hated you because I was told to hate you, and now I’m realizing how much I didn’t actually hate you. But my brain still behaves that way.”
that would be?”
What he wasn’t taught about the effect of dementors was the thoughts they put in his head of hurting himself. It was no wonder most people died in Azkaban, they probably killed themselves, egged on by the swarming dementors the amplification of any negative thoughts. Draco had considered trying to remove the mark before being locked up, but since then there were days where it was all he would think about.
“We assume they’ll be invited back if you are, but we don’t know if they’ll come back. Most of them are in France or something.”
Malfoy glared at him. He went to grab the wand again.
Hermione chuckled a little. “Even if he isn’t, do you really think McGonagall wouldn’t listen to you?”
Theodore Nott had been sentenced to Azkaban, Harry knew, so he wouldn’t be there. He apparently had been even more directly involved in the Death Eater operations than Malfoy, doing most of the torture at Hogwarts. Goyle, Zabini, and Parkinson, however, were all free or on probation.
Shacklebolt banged his gavel on his podium, ordering the court to be quiet. At the silence, Draco and his mother and father looked up at the filled court.
He made his way down the long staircase to the kitchen, to see a spread of breakfast being set out by Kreacher, and Narcissa and Draco sitting next to each other on one end of the table.
“No, that was just an added bonus.” She winked at him. “I have news from McGonagall. She’s inviting anybody who didn’t have a chance to finish their schooling to return to Hogwarts on the first.”
He was wrong, this was no dream. Not just witness testimonies,
Malfoy’s face turned serious, his back straightened. His body language closed off immediately. “And what would that be?”
“No, no, it’s the Chosen
Harry ventured down and sat across from both of them, serving himself some eggs and pumpkin juice. Narcissa and Draco were already eating, and the table was quiet.
Draco stared at his mother, jaw slack in shock. She had never so much as disagreed with Lucius in front of him, let alone do...
“It’s been underwhelming, if anything. We don’t talk much.” Harry thought back to that morning - it was the first time they had spoken since Harry returned the wand. Hermione’s lips pursed.
“Happy Birthday, Harry. I know we aren’t celebrating until next week but we got you something for today anyway, open it at home.” Weasley said, handing Potter a small wrapped gift. Potter smiled slightly.
“Harry,” Hermione cut in, “Are you sure Malfoy is going to want to come back to Hogwarts?”
“I don’t need you doing me any favors.”
The guard walked them outside, and Draco took a deep breath of fresh air, the first in forever. It filled his lungs in a new way. He looked at the blue of the sky, feeling relief as they moved into the charmed area where the dementors' effects weren’t felt. His mind cleared, and for the first time in two months, his chest felt weightless.
They waved a last goodbye, and Granger and Weasley went to one floo while Potter went to a separate one.
He ran over his plans, day after day, his fingers running over his chest, and days turned into weeks, until suddenly he had spent two months on the floor of his cell, and his verdict would be given tomorrow.
Harry ate his eggs slowly, trying to catch Malfoy’s eye again, but he didn’t look up throughout the entire meal. Narcissa continuously glared at both of them, and Harry eventually resorted to also staring at his food, scared of her watchful eye. He wasn’t sure why she was mad at him too, but he didn’t want to be on the receiving end of that glare again.
Startled, Harry jumped a little, before he faced Malfoy again. Standing over him felt wrong, somehow, for this conversation, but he certainly didn’t want to sit down next to a half naked Malfoy on his bed. That was a very, very, bad idea. Harry sat down on the floor.
Malfoy rolled his eyes again, but fought down a sly smirk. Harry ate his breakfast with a small smile. Maybe he was being too obvious again, but Malfoy seemed placated by it this time. Progress.
Harry’s mouth dropped open, “Clear? If anything you’ve purposefully kept your answer incredibly cryptic just because you like to fuck with me!” He took in Malfoy’s new gait, his arms crossed and smirking. “Like you’re doing now.” Harry chuckled a little and Malfoy’s grin spread. “Fuck me.”
Shacklebolt took in the number of hands and clarified, “We will do this in order of ranking, those highest will speak first. Speaking out of turn will have you ejected from this proceeding, as I do not want this court to get out of hand. First, my own question. I only have one. What do you mean he surrendered a moment too late?”
He was up again quickly, reaching for the wand across Harry’s body. Harry pushed his arm away, grabbing it and turning him around. Malfoy grabbed his wrist and twisted, before ducking under his arm to reach for the wand again. The wand was inches from his fingers, but Harry tossed it into the air and caught it in his other hand. In his shock, Malfoy dropped his wrist. Harry made a dash to get across the bed, to the other side of the room.
Potter took a deep breath and sighed out. He folded his arms over his chest. “I’m not sure, exactly. I’m not as mad as I thought I would be. I thought I would start by offering you and your mother a place to live, now that the Manor isn’t an option.”
“No, the other Draco Malfoy,” Potter said, rolling his eyes with a smile. Draco had to bite down a smile. Potter’s sarcastic nature hadn’t been broken by the war, apparently. He seemed to think Draco was mad though, as he added, “Sorry, sorry. That was rude. Yes, you. I assume you also know what this is about?”
He finally settled on a green sweater Luna had bought him - the color apparently “brought out his eyes" - tucked into a pair of black jeans. It was certainly more fancy than he usually wore to dinner. He would be shocked if Malfoy didn’t notice, but he hoped it was casual enough that he might not tease him too much.
(See the end of the chapter for
The court was silent as he sat down. His father was glaring at him, but Draco met his eyes and set his jaw. His mother was crying again, and grabbed his hand in hers when he sat back down. He entwined their fingers as best he could, squeezing tightly.
Hermione smiled at him. “I know.”
“It’s Malfoy.” He finally blurted, causing Hermione to cough into her coffee, dripping it on the table. He winced. “Sorry, could’ve warned you.”
“What?”
When Hermione asked him for lunch for the third day in a row, Harry knew he had no choice but to say yes. At breakfast, he informed Kreacher that he wouldn’t be joining them for lunch. Malfoy overheard, and scoffed.
“Why wouldn’t he?”
“That depends fully on how the rest of our trial went. So, unfortunately, your guess is as good as mine. My greatest hope is that your age will give you a reduced sentence,” She nodded to herself, and Draco gulped. If even his mother thought he would be doing time in Azkaban, then hope truly was meek.
“One.”
“I’m glad you both had a good night.”
“I understand that, and I agree, it’s not the best time. But I will tell you that - at the least - you need to come out with us more. He misses you something terrible, but he’s not too keen to admit it.”
“Master Harry has brought the rightful family back to Kreacher’s home, he has made Mistress happy, very happy, yes...” Kreacher whispered as he set down the final plate of eggs. Harry felt unreasonably underdressed in his own home, as both of the Malfoy’s were in semi-formal clothing.
There was far too much to consider. Maybe Malfoy wouldn’t want to go, and then what? If Harry chose not to go, would he resent him forever? What if he did want to go, but everyone hates him? What if he did want to go, but he wanted to act as if they weren’t even friends?
“Me too.”
“I guess. I guess it makes some sort of sense, doesn’t it?” Draco offered, shrugging. Potter smiled.
and didn’t know any world outside his own!
Harry sighed, biting his lip before approaching a more serious topic. “Can you- I know I can’t really ask you
and placed my invisibility cloak over me, so I had no way to intervene. Malfoy had him cornered, but hesitated to cast the killing curse.” Potter took a deep breath, and Draco felt the desperation too. He had agonized for weeks over that moment, leading up to it and in the aftermath. He never wanted to kill anyone. Potter continued, “Dumbledore asked him why he was doing this. Malfoy explained Voldemort had threatened to kill his family, and he had no other choice. Dumbledore offered him another choice, to join the Order and gain protection for his family. Malfoy’s wand fell, as the other Death Eaters joined us on the tower. If he had surrendered moments earlier, Dumbledore wouldn’t have died, and Malfoy would have abandoned the cause. He was quite literally seconds from doing the right thing.”
“That doesn’t sound so great.”
“Quite frankly, no one deserves Azkaban. That prison is horrible, and the fact that people go there even while they are awaiting trial is so cruel. Nowhere in the muggle world is it that cruel, I swear.” Granger ranted quickly, Weasley and Potter nodding along as if she had said this all before.
Potter let out a soft chuckle, “Yeah, I would assume so.”
“Ron, you know he’s not evil. He’s wrong about a lot of things, sure. But he was as forced into the war as I was.” Potter defended him again, Weasley shook his head.
“No need to thank me. You both saved my life,” Potter responded, returning his hand to his pocket. “I actually - er. I was hoping to have a word with Malfoy, uhm- Draco.” He looked past Narcissa, and made eye contact with Draco. He smiled slightly.
The rest of the day went the same way the next two weeks did: very, very, slowly. Malfoy did not so much as look at Harry whenever they saw each other, let alone speak to him. Every meal went by silently, with Narcissa staring a hole in his head about it. Granted, Malfoy probably had an equally sized hole in his head as well. But Harry could barely stand it. He wanted to say something, but he didn’t want to muck things up any further. He had apparently done enough damage already.
Thanks so much for reading! Leave kudos/comments if you feel so inclined.
“They didn’t have anywhere else to go.” Harry felt the need to defend himself, for some reason. He had made some bad decisions before, but he knew this wasn’t one of them. Malfoy was his soulmate, he had shown remorse, he was someone Harry knew could be trusted. “I have so much room in Grimmauld, it was nothing, really.”
There will most likely be a chapter next week as well, but after that I have some catching up to do. I'm not sure if I'm going to post the chapters as they're finished, or if I'm going to put the story on a hiatus while I write some more (or maybe even until it's finished). I'll let you know next week what I'm deciding on. Thanks so much for reading and for your continued support!
“Well, anything is better than where we came from today. So. Sure,” Draco said.
“I still can’t believe you spoke in his favor. If you just weren’t going to testify at all I might understand but-”
“Oh, er. Actually, he’s living with me. Narcissa too.”
“No, just Hermione.” Harry explained. He wasn’t sure he wanted everyone to know yet, considering how new it all was. But once they were something, he knew he wouldn’t want to hide. He just didn’t want the endless questions while they worked it out. “If you do come back, we don’t have to tell anyone until you’re comfortable.”
She smiled at him sadly, “You? Overwhelming? Never.”
“It hasn’t been overwhelming?”
Harry grabbed the wand, wanting the awkwardness to disappear as fast as it had come. Fuck Malfoy for bringing up sex so soon. Fuck himself for making it more serious than it needed to be. “I just wanted to return this.” He held out the wand.
Malfoy grabbed his wrist before he could get to the door. “It’s not. I won’t say I haven’t thought about it, but I just. I thought you would assume the worst.”
Harry spluttered as he approached his nightstand, choking on air. “What? No- I? W-What?”
“France is nothing special, and they both hate their families enough to want to leave.”
Too many times he’d caught himself staring at Malfoy, and he had always just attributed it to his suspicious nature. All of sixth year made more sense too - he knew something was up with Malfoy, and technically he was right. But it was only because of how much he already knew about Malfoy’s habits that he noticed in the first place. He lost interest in
“Fuck. I don’t know what I’ll do if he doesn’t want to come back. I want things to work out with him, even if it’s difficult, but I don’t know how it would work with him at Grimmauld and me in Scotland.”
“You’ll never know if you don’t talk to him about it.” She grinned at him, and he sighed with a smile. “I have to head back now, Ron is expecting me.” Harry nodded and began to get up, gathering his robes.
After eating, Potter moved back to his couch, grabbing a book off of a side table and reading, his glass of whiskey present again, refilling four or five more times. The hours passed quickly, the moon rising in the sky. Potter stood up and stretched, and looked at the small bottle on the table.
the war. It may be too early to discuss shared traumas.”
Malfoy scowled at him, “You just grabbed it from me. Why would it work any different?”
“Grimmauld is all ready now, if you want to come with me.”
“It’s not ideal, but I don’t want to overwhelm him. I think I might’ve already done that.” Harry confessed. “I like him much more than I expected, Hermione.”
They would slink past his cell, and images of a frozen Charity Burbage would find their way to the forefront of his mind. He would scream as if he was back at that table. And then with almost no break, a flashback to his punishment following that meeting.
The dream was strange. He woke up in the morning, in a house vaguely familiar to him but he couldn’t place it. He went through the daily motions, but never once looked in a mirror. His eyes avoided them like the plague, head bent over the sink to brush his teeth, and turned away completely as he got dressed.
“I never thought I’d see another one of these.” Malfoy said, mostly to himself. Harry’s eyebrows raised at the vulnerable statement, but when he went to comment he was met with an icy Malfoy glare. So he let him have his moment.
Harry decided it wasn’t something to fight about, at least not right now, so he dropped it, still smiling at Malfoy. Malfoy was looking back down at the letter in his hand, trying to hide a smile.
“So I do not ask you for absolution. I do not ask for forgiveness, I don’t believe I deserve it, if I’m honest with you. I have remorse for every single action I took in the last two years. Quite frankly, in my entire life. I have been raised to think one thing about muggles, and muggleborns, and anyone not considered ‘pureblood.’ I had my doubts when I first got to school about these philosophies, but nothing affirmed how wrong my father was like the war. There is no amount of rhetoric that will convince me that a group of people are less than human, and deserve life less than me or anyone else. Thank you for hearing me today,” Draco raised his hands to his face, wiping the tears from his cheeks, and turned back to his seat.
Narcissa’s kind face turned hard again at the mention of the post. Malfoy obviously told her about the invitations. He was still smirking at him though, and that made Harry feel better about Narcissa’s apprehension.
Harry nodded. He turned away a little, smirking right back at him. “Well, I’m sure the letters will come at dinnertime. So we’ll see then.”
to tell Ron, but I’d appreciate it if-”
Harry jumped up and went to the window, letting the bird in, where it dumped two letters.
Potter. He was dreaming from Potter’s eyes, just going about his day. Why? What purpose could this dream serve, the day before his fate was revealed? Why would his subconscious want to show him a mundane day in the life of the Saviour?
“I have chosen today to speak in favor of Draco Malfoy as I was there the day Dumbledore was killed and saw him choose to surrender a moment too late. I also witnessed, through Voldemort, his reluctance to participate in Death Eater activity, and failure to do so at his own expense. He also saved my life in Malfoy Manor, by declining to identify me to Death Eaters there. And, while I know this doesn’t contribute specifically to his personal merit, his wand is the wand that killed Voldemort.” Potter finished, looking directly at the crowd. He made eye contact with Shacklebolt, it felt almost defiant. Draco wanted him to look away.
“Draco Malfoy, you can now approach the bench for your defense,” Shacklebolt stated, slamming the gavel down again to bring order to the whispering court. Draco stood up, trying to appear as strong as his mother did. He took a deep breath, trying to regain his composure.
“I thought we established you aren’t entitled to that.” Now Harry rolled his eyes, not letting the goading get to him. He did feel his cheeks heat slightly, though.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco liked to think of that as breakfast.
many things about sixth year. He looked up for the first time since starting his testimony, and his eyes immediately landed on Potter. Their eyes met, as Draco took in a ragged breath. Potter seemed to understand. Draco shook his head clear of the thought - the dream from the night before had put weird ideas in his head. He couldn’t afford to entertain them.
Maybe Harry had just looked at him too openly. He was never good at hiding his feelings, truly Gryffindor in the way he wore his heart on his sleeve. He probably had been far too fond, looking up at Malfoy. It was the only thing he could think of that would make Malfoy leave like that, like he was mad.
He didn’t have a dream through someone else’s eyes, and therefore, he didn’t have a soulmate.
and the other to,
Harry frowned to himself, unsure of what he had done wrong. He had thought they were getting along quite well, considering the circumstances, but suddenly Malfoy just shut down. Had he said something? Or done something? Malfoy was the one who suggested fighting for the wand, he was the one that had jumped on
Malfoy scoffed and looked back at Harry. “You have an unending faith in other people’s goodness that I do not possess.”
“He hurt a lot of people there. Despite what you said, he isn’t going to be welcomed back with open arms by most people. If he does come back, it’ll probably be really rough for him.”
Lucius approached the podium. His defense was very thin, claiming he was under the imperius curse again. Draco watched as the court shook their heads, not buying the story.
. His mind couldn’t catch up. His mother was looking back and forth between them.
“We don’t have much else in common.”
His face fell. Would his probation allow it? Would Mcgonagall invite him back? “Is Malfoy going to be invited back?”
The gay thing was less of a surprise than Malfoy was. Harry had always known about those feelings he had, the side glances at Seamus in the Gryffindor showers, the way he reacted to Cedric Diggory, and even the way his mind had wandered when he first met Bill Weasley. He had always known he was attracted to men. He didn’t necessarily like to acknowledge it, though. His aunt and uncle had made very clear how the world felt about gay men.
Malfoy shut the door behind him, and Harry stood there awkwardly. The guest room he had given to Malfoy didn’t quite look lived in, the comforter on the bed was rumpled but that was the only sign of life. Every other part of the room - the desk, the wardrobe, even the nightstand - appeared to be untouched. It was exactly as Harry had set it up the morning before inviting Malfoy to live with him. It felt impersonal, like Malfoy had no plans to stay there long term.
Lucius seemed to have finally understood the fight was lost. He hung his head, scowling at the floor. A guard came behind him and dragged him out.
Malfoy’s eyes softened at this, and he bit his lip in consideration. “Well, I hated you because you’re incredibly easy to hate.” He smirked slightly, the upturn of his lip the only thing that clued Harry into the fact that he was joking.
Lucius glared at him, his shock turning quickly to anger. “How dare you, boy! Speaking out of turn to your father, disrespecting your family, letting bad circumstances get in the way of your loyalty. You are a disgrace-”
“You did a good job, Harry,” Granger said, grasping his shoulder. Potter took a deep breath, nodding.
“Well, when can we move in?”
Despite only being out of the prison for a few hours, Draco was already dreading going back for any period of time. The way his head had cleared, able to think about things rationally without turning towards trauma immediately, was a beloved respite. He felt like a weight was off of his shoulders, and even with his anxiety towards the trial, he felt more relaxed than he had in two months. Maybe longer. Going back couldn’t be an option. He
Malfoy’s eyes lit up and he cast a quick
Okay so, we have officially caught up to where I am in writing this fic. I have two more chapters written but not edited, so there will likely be a chapter next week but I make no promises as of right now. My beta has been going through some shit so that's why they haven't been edited yet, so it kind of depends on whether or not they get around to reading over what I have written in the next week. I will try to post a new chapter on the Friday after it's done, to keep up at least a little with the posting schedule I have made. So sorry for the wait but I want this fic to be as good as possible! I hope you all understand!
“No, I didn’t assume that actually. But if that’s all you’re expecting from this-”
Potter went straight for the Wizengamot, sitting beside Granger and the Weasel, behind the head of the court, Kingsley Shacklebolt.
“Well? What do you say?” Harry braved to ask outright, trying hard to get a read on Malfoy’s frantic page flipping.
Harry processed Malfoy’s flippant reference to a place he’d never even dreamed of visiting faster than he processed the fact that it sounded like Malfoy was leaning towards coming back with him.
“Well, won’t there be other Slytherins there too? He won’t be completely alone.”
When lunch rolled around, Harry was fidgeting with his shirt for a while in the mirror, trying to figure out how to broach the topic with Hermione. He would have to come right out and say it, or else she would be jumping in with advice that doesn’t apply. He’d have to be quick.
“It’s no problem.” He still hadn’t moved, propping himself up on his palms on the bed. Malfoy looked at him quickly, and licked his lips before biting down on one, eyes at the floor.
Harry woke up in his own bed, in his own house, to the smell of bacon wafting up from the kitchen. Kreacher must have started on breakfast without his permission. He sighed, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes. He reached for his glasses on his nightstand and saw the bottle, now filled with shimmering gold glitter, that read
“You both like Quidditch, don’t you? What about that?”
about it.
“That’s good. I’m sure your father will be joining us shortly,” Narcissa commented, her face blank at the mention of Lucius. Draco winced, not wanting to see his father again. He was still unsure about what he felt about his father. He knew that when it came down to it, it was Lucius’ fault that his family was wrapped up in Voldemort’s world, but he still had some love for the man who raised him. His mother sat in silence for a few moments, probably thinking over the same things.
“We will.”
He smiled slightly at the guard. She glared back at him. He dropped his eyes to his feet. She wrapped her arm through his, and side alonged them to the guest entrance of the ministry.
Harry gripped her hand back, nodding. He finished the last of his coffee, pinching his eyes together against a headache beginning to form. “Thank you, ‘Mione. Really. I plan to tell him soon, but I’m still worried. Things with Fred are so fresh.”
“Can I help you?” His eyes snapped back up, meeting Malfoy’s harsh gaze. “You’ve been pacing out here for ages as if I couldn’t hear you.”
“And finally, in the case of Draco Malfoy. Based on his own testimony, his age, and favorable testimony from Harry Potter-” Draco’s eyes snapped up to Potter, whose face was surprisingly neutral. Draco’s mind ran through a thousand possibilities. What on Earth could Potter have said that was good about
“Great!” She smiled brightly at him, patting his hand. “Oh- I almost forgot the entire reason I wanted to have lunch.”
“Huh?” He looked up at Harry. Malfoy was so absorbed in the letter he seemed to have forgotten he existed.
“It appears that way.”
Despite this, and despite the feelings of dread that the dementors amplified, he knew he couldn’t give up. He spent the little time he had a clear mind during the day thinking of what he would say during his defense. He ran his fingers up and down his ribcage, counting the bones, trying to keep the dangerous thoughts at bay, and thought of how to sum up his experiences in a sympathetic manner.
“I would hope so, as we live together now,” Harry chuckled slightly, but Malfoy was very distracted in his leaving. He walked out without so much as a glance back.
Arriving back at home, Potter sighed and dropped onto his couch, pressing the heels of his hands into his eyes. He took the gift out of his pocket and opened it.
The thought crossed Draco’s mind, suddenly, that this could be a soulmate dream. The fact that it was Potter’s birthday, and the strange perspective of the dream. It would make sense, except that it was impossible. If he even has a soulmate, there was no way it would be Potter. Fate couldn’t be so cruel. Draco Malfoy, bonded for life to a man who would hate him forever.
When Harry thought about it more and more, it all made some sort of twisted sense. He wasn’t in love with Malfoy, he wasn’t even sure he
“Why can’t you see how
(See the end of the chapter for
Potter’s birthday. What a strange detail to add to a dream, As if Harry Potter would have to spend his birthday in court, testifying for Draco Malfoy.
Harry chuckled, messing with his hair. “I am, aren’t I?”
He took a deep breath, standing in front of the door, lifted his hand-
“I know that. I would do it even if you weren’t my soulmate. You deserve the same chance as us to finish schooling, if you want to.”
“Well the ones who aren’t in prison are mostly on the continent. Doesn’t mean they won’t come back if invited but...”
“The court will now vote on the verdict of Lucius Malfoy. All in favor of life in Azkaban without parole?” Shacklebolt said, and every hand in the court shot up. Draco’s heart sank. He never wanted to see his father again, but he couldn’t help the pang of sympathy and pain from knowing his father would stay in that horrid place forever.  He wanted to
Harry himself ran his fingers over the edge of the letter, realizing it would be the last one he ever saw until he had his own children. It was surreal, staring at the red wax seal. After all of the trials of the last year, the absolute hell he had gone to, after
Then, he left for the ministry.
The look in Potter’s eyes as he refused to identify him.
“With me?” Draco asked, shock filling him. The possibility of the dream from the previous night being a soulmate dream came up again.
He sat down next to Malfoy, his feet still planted on the ground, so Malfoy was a little behind him on the bed. “We aren’t sure.”
“Good morning. How did you both sleep?” He asked.
“Now, today we will hear the final witnesses in the cases of Lucius, Narcissa, and Draco Malfoy. These testimonies will be given by the accused themselves. Following their testimony, the court will decide their punishments.” Shacklebolt explained. “We will begin with Lucius Malfoy. You may approach the podium.”
“The way you got it from me. That worked, didn’t it? No magic involved. So try to keep it away from me. I’ll fight you for it.” Malfoy explained. He kept eyeing his wand, not even glancing at Harry’s face or other hand. He slipped his hand containing the Hawthorne wand behind his back. Malfoy was forced to make eye contact with him.
Back at Grimmauld Place, Harry paced in front of Malfoy’s door. He kept pulling his lip between his teeth, unsure of where to start the conversation about returning to Hogwarts. It was a more complicated issue than he wanted it to be, he wished he could just return without having to consider anybody else.
“Wake up, let’s go!” The guard was yelling, rattling the door frame. “It’s your trial. Get up now.” She gestured for Draco to approach the bars at the front of the cell. He stood up on shaky legs. “Give me your hands.” He put his hands through the bars, and she spelled his wrists together. Then she pushed them back through the bars and unlocked the door.
Namely, Draco Malfoy, his soulmate.
He wasn’t expecting a positive outcome.
Suddenly another guard approached, wrestling with his father. “Unhand me! I am perfectly able to walk by myself, I will not be pushed around-excuse me!” He exclaimed as the guard pushed him onto the bench, next to Draco. His hands were attached to the bench, and then Draco noticed his ankles were shackled as well.
Draco realized that he was watching his own court proceedings. That for some reason, in this horrible dream world, Potter was observing his own trial, and he would have to watch the witness testimonies against him.
She smiled sadly at him, “Hello, my dear. Are you ready for today?” Her voice was meek, almost unrecognizable.
Surprise! I'm back! Now, the chapter after this one still isn't done, so we aren't going back to our original posting schedule, but I thought it'd been long enough and I wanted to give y'all a bit of a gift. Hope you enjoy!
Draco was overtaken with a sense of overwhelming deja vu. He had been in the Wizengamot before, but the set up was exactly like his dream from the night before. Kingsley Shacklebolt stared down at the three of them from the center of the benches, and was surrounded by the same faces from the dream. The exact same faces, in the exact same seats.
“You aren’t going to show me your dick are you?” Malfoy was standing in the doorway, arms crossed.
Draco felt his eyes water as she spoke, honored that his mother would indict herself in his defense. When she sat back down, she stopped for a moment to lean down and kiss his forehead. A tear slid down his cheek, and he sniffed a breath in, swallowing around the lump that had formed in his throat.
The pain of receiving the dark mark.
“Finally have somewhere better to be?” Malfoy rolled his eyes.
He looked at Malfoy then, making eye contact with him for the first time since entering the room. Malfoy looked surprisingly serious but nodded at him. “That’s good, I guess.”
Draco whispered, “What do you think is going to happen?” He looked at Narcissa, who met his eyes and frowned. She was scared too, he could tell.
“Until I’m comfortable? Don’t you assume I’d want to scream it from the rooftops? My reputation could use the boost.” Malfoy asked him, scoffing. Harry was taken aback. He hadn’t considered that as a reason Malfoy would want to tell everyone about them. Quite angry that he would consider using him like that, Harry stood to leave.
“I don’t know for sure that you’ll be invited, but considering the outcome of your trial I can’t imagine you wouldn’t be, and even if you aren’t I can send an owl to McGonagall-”
After a few moments of silence, the court broke out in murmurs. The members were clearly discussing their fates, what punishments would be fitting. Soon, Shacklebolt had received multiple pieces of paper. He read through them all, then banged his gavel to regain everyone’s attention.
Harry coughed a little before entering, and both of them fell silent. “Er, Hello.”
“So how has he been since the trial? Have you seen him much?”
Hermione’s face fell slightly, and she pulled the side of her lip between her teeth. “I’m not sure. If the Wizengamot allows it, I can’t imagine he wouldn’t be.”
“Ah, Harry! Good evening.” Narcissa said, smiling more pleasantly at him than she had since the night they moved in. Malfoy himself was pointedly silent, staring at Harry. Harry adjusted his collar self-consciously, hoping he wasn’t as obvious as he felt.
close to surrendering to Dumbledore. He regretted taking the mark every day when he saw it again. He even considered offering his forearm as reparations, but he thought that might come across as far too drastic.
“Let’s see if I receive an invitation.”
“I-I guess I do,” Draco nodded. “We, uhm. We’re soulmates.”
Draco’s eyes widened, his eyebrows nearing his hairline.
Potter stripped down to his pants, preparing for bed. (Which Draco did not try and take note of. He just...saw it by accident. His chiseled chest, the scar over his heart. His large- no. He didn’t notice that at all.) He finished what was left in his glass, stumbling slightly as he got to his bed.
“Quite well, thank you for your hospitality,” Narcissa answered. Malfoy was unusually quiet, pushing his eggs around his plate. He had a piece of toast he appeared to have picked at. Narcissa nudged him, and he looked up, his eyes somewhat blank.
“It’s weird, isn’t it?” Harry ventured. Malfoy’s eyes snapped to his.
(See the end of the chapter for
The mirror seemed to be mocking him. He couldn’t find an outfit that was casual enough for dinner in his own home, but nice enough that Malfoy might notice it. He hated himself a little for caring so much about Malfoy’s opinion, but he did, and especially with the possibility that tonight could have the news that they were returning to Hogwarts. It felt monumental, Malfoy agreeing to come with him.
Malfoy’s eyebrows raised at him in shock, his mouth falling open a little. “Why are you sitting on the floor? You look like an idiot.” He bit his lip, poorly trying to hide a smile. His chest shook with a laugh.
The slicing of his skin, bleeding out on the bathroom floor.
The pain of the cruciatus curse relived over and over.
Somebody sat next to him. He looked up to see his mother, in the same position as him, in the same grey Azkaban uniform. Their eyes met, and Draco immediately felt a longing he didn’t know was there, to be held by his mother, to have her tell him everything was going to be okay.
When Kreacher came around and began cleaning the table, Narcissa stood up, smoothing out her clothing. “I’ll be in my quarters, reading.” Malfoy’s eyes shot up, looking scared. She left before he could get a word in, and then they were alone at the table.
“Oh come off it. It’s been nice to have a break, honestly.”
“The first thing I would like to say is that there are no excuses for the actions I took during the war. I do not plan to stand here and excuse what I did - simply explain. The circumstances under which I took the dark mark were extreme. My entire family was being threatened, my home under siege. The constant presence of Voldemort felt inescapable. I had no choice but to follow in my father’s footsteps, or die instead. I considered death,” Draco let out a dark wet laugh, thinking of how many times the thought crossed his mind. How many times during the war he considered taking an
“I was on the astronomy tower the night Severus Snape killed Dumbledore. Dumbledore put me under a
Malfoy raised his eyebrows with a small smile and looked back down at the letter. His smile softened, “I’m very humbled to be invited back.”
“Quite good. Waiting on the post.” Malfoy finally spoke up, as he took a bite of the shepherd's pie. He looked directly at Harry, his mouth turning up so slightly Harry almost didn’t catch it.
before he could see clearly. “Well, it appears to have worked. Thank you, Potter.”
Malfoy’s eyes rolled and he huffed, exasperated. “I thought I’d made it abundantly clear that if I was invited I would be attending.”
“Er-uh. Yeah. Sorry. It’s just, Hermione told me something at lunch and I wanted to talk to you about it.” Harry stood there awkwardly, trying to avoid looking anywhere in particular, thinking maybe that would help the situation. Malfoy may think he’s mad, but at least that’s better than getting caught checking him out.
“In this instant, I suppose.”
Potter braced himself on the podium. He took a deep, ragged breath in. He seemed tired, but pushed through for the sake of the trial. He looked at his hands again, and Draco took in the tense way his forearms bulged, the sleeves of his robes rolled back. He could feel the tension sitting in his lower back, unsure of how he had missed it before.
“In favor?” Shacklebolt repeated Draco’s own thoughts, and murmurs traveled through the gathering of witches and wizards.
who was cooking breakfast, and he would avoid having another discussion with his house-elf about how he prefers to cook for himself or not at all in the mornings.
Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed! If you did and could leave kudos or a comment I would greatly appreciate it!
“It’s unlikely.”
Hey guys! Just a heads up, we're starting to catch up to what I have finished already. If we do catch up, there may start to be a delay in chapters because I want this story to be the best it can possibly be, which means taking my time on it. Hopefully I'll be able to keep up and there won't be a delay, but I wanted to put this disclaimer here now rather than it be a shock a few chapters from now. Thanks for all your support!
There was silence again. Draco looked at the floor, trying to gather his thoughts.
He realized if he had just turned 18, that meant it had been a month since the Battle of Hogwarts. A month since he was arrested. A month since he had arrived here. As he stared down at his wrist, thinking of plan after plan to remove the damned thing, he jolted as he realized he was already losing touch with reality. He needed a happy thought. He started counting his ribs. He thought of his mother, tried to conjure any positive memory. He came up with a small one, from when he was a boy, of his mother kissing his forehead goodnight.
Harry considered this. He hadn’t really thought much about what to talk to Malfoy about, just that he wanted to talk to him. He wanted to laugh with him again. The way that Malfoy looked with a genuine smile on his face, Harry wanted that back. Maybe Quidditch was the right answer.
Draco turned around to see Potter standing there, hands in his pockets. He looked distinctly more disheveled than Draco had ever seen him. His hair was it’s normal mess, but there were dark circles under his eyes and his gaze seemed hollow. He wasn’t wearing robes, just a ratty T-shirt and baggy jeans. He bit his lip and looked at the floor.
Harry sighed, taking a sip of coffee. “Yes. I am. This isn’t going to be easy, I don’t have any delusions about that, but the more I think about it the more it makes sense.”
“Let them wonder,” Draco replies. “Tell them it’s a mandate from on high and I want it in the early edition.”
“Can you tell me, Galder, when the ice formed?”
“Like a professional,” Draco interrupts.
“But?” Blaise prompted, looking much more interested than he had been at first.
Nothing helped Harry suppress a blush like Draco’s rolled eyes. “Yeah, ‘Mione. It’s fine.”
“If you’re so averse to the taste of my mouth, you could always find somewhere else to put yours.”
Potter did as he was told, and let Draco slip the cuff around his arm.
He likes this. Likes me in his arse. He wants more of it.
a job for me.”
Shaking his head clear, Harry tries another spin. It’s smoother, but his left foot still tangles, and he almost falls when he jerks right to compensate.
Potter moaned. “Like it.”
Draco crossed his legs and adjusted the cuff of his sleeve. “Yes. Well done.”
“More than you knew from school? From rumours?”
Draco had never had cause to wonder what it would look like if someone tried to roll their eyes whilst upside-down. It wasn’t any less amusing for the lack of anticipation.
to suggest that they’d actually been Nundus just to ensure that everyone remained aware of his perpetual heroism. But Potter did sleep, and he slept well. Which was, Draco figured, the wages of goodness. Guiltless, guileless, peaceful sleep. The kind of sleep that meant sinking into the pillows, exhaling deeply, and ceding to rest.
“There’s nothing Draco doesn’t know about the project, and his insights into how Voldemort would’ve protected the Chamber during the battle have been instrumental. Besides which, we’re almost certain that the ritual will take two people, and he and I are the only Reconstruction Committee members who are willing. He has to know everything.”
Instead, Malfoy was tucking his shirt into his pants and getting on with his waistcoat.
Draco whispered “Snape” out of the corner of his mouth and Harry smiled tightly. “Yes, well. Your son was very dedicated as well. I mean – I just mean that when he and Hermione Granger brought it to my attention, its importance was obvious. It would have been irresponsible of me not to, really.”
He turns to Potter, more apologetic than he means to be. “I’m afraid most of the grocery will have spoiled by now.”
“It’s a naming thing,” Ron offered. “Magicum. The magical versions of Muggle animals.
“Had a very difficult time professing feelings of affection when we first met. Boys in these old aristocratic families were trained to rule, not to be partners. Certainly not to be open with their emotions.”
“I hope you will say yes, then.”
But as his eyes adjusted he could see that there weren’t any aisles, nor were there any prophecies. These were lights, glimmering in gold and blue. He reached out a hand to touch one. It was glass, warm to the touch.
“Also viable.”
“Okay. That’s fine. Do you feel any achiness or pain?”
“That’s the idea.”
The herald clears his throat and cast a
“No!” Harry interrupted. “Fuck. No, that’s—I can see why you thought that, but it’s not what I meant at all.”
He knocked, but didn’t enter. Half a minute later, he knocked again. “Potter? All right in there?”
“For goodness sake.” Malfoy turns his back with a heavily exaggerated sigh.
If I can’t get a fingertip between his knees, getting my cock into his arse seems Herculean.
“I’ll give it to you, Potter,” Draco ranted, pacing the room. “You’ve either got the temperament of a doormat or the patience of a saint.”
“Charity work. I can get you a list.”
"Yup, you too, Lee," Harry answered, and then disconnected.
“You’ve agreed to identify the desk.”
“Basically, yes.” Draco pinched the bridge of his nose. “Are you that surprised?”
He just wanted to understand. It didn’t make sense that Malfoy hadn’t been willing to answer. If he hadn’t had anything at all to lose, if he wasn’t invested at all, he would’ve said so, and quickly. It was probably constitutionally beyond Malfoy to avoid gloating about that sort of thing, especially after he’d got what he wanted.
“Who is-what do you mean?” Harry said, choking, slightly beside himself.
The cuffs binding his wrists together disappeared. He stood up and reached for Narcissa. They embraced, his arms around her waist. He buried his face in her shoulder, tears streaming down his cheeks. The feeling of relief filled him from his toes to the tip of his head, his chest heaving in sobs. He would never have to return to Azkaban.
