Normally, Harry held back from the burning urge to admire, but right now, it was simply impossible to resist. He shone even brighter amongst the beasts and the bastards; pure and good, a true golden boy. She took a moment to admire the firm movements of his back through his white t-shirt, tucked safely into well-fitted black slacks. Then she took another for the soft hairs curling by the nape of his neck and the quiet glow of his ebony rosary beads, shined to perfection with a thousand silent prayers on missions just about to go wrong. He was nothing like the slimy, parasitical men that surrounded him; he positively glowed with power, an energy only given to those who God knows would never even think to misuse it.
The last thing Harry remembered before she blacked out was Draco laying flat on the ground, lifting her palm, and whispering “
it. But she couldn’t admit it, she couldn’t she couldn’t she couldn’t and so for now, this was enough.
“I’m obsessive, but I’m not
with a twirl of her finger (she’d
Draco mouthed along to the words as they floated into the room, and now Harry was dead sure that she was way too drunk to recognize her, because if she did, she definitely would not be looking at her like that. Like Harry was the answer to every question she’d ever asked, the key to every locked door in her mind.
Lucius Malfoy died like the animal he was: loudly, with blood oozing out of every hole. One last twitch, a guttural moan, then finally, silence. Harry was filled with a warm satisfaction; whoever said revenge was for the weak had never felt what Harry had, couldn’t possibly begin to understand the raw power coursing through her veins. Then she looked down, and realized that the warmth wasn’t just her own morbid sense of fulfilment— it was blood, dripping scarlet down her shirt, trickling over her bare stomach.
involved. And then Luna snapped out of her daydreams for a minute or so (Harry had never been so sure someone did shrooms in her life) to tell them that she remembered her father mentioning a Daily Prophet warehouse the Malfoys used to store their more illicit wire transfer records, and so here Harry was, in a 30,000 square feet warehouse with a shining stone hanging around her neck and no idea where the fuck to start looking.
In the center of the room lay the undeniable source of that power: Theodora Nott, flanked on both sides by men and women so achingly beautiful Harry couldn’t help but recall The Last Supper. She recognized some of the disciples from another case’s files: Pansy Parkinson, heiress to the Parkinson Real Estate fortune, Marcus Flint, son of legendary footballer and notorious lothario James Flint, and Blaise Zabini, star record producer Michael Zabini’s bastard child. She wondered which one of these rich, pretty faces would be their Judas.
She reached up to her willstone, trying to feel any magical connection to the place; she’d been able to do that, lately, at historical sites. She remembered Hermione telling her it had something to do with heritage magic, how historical sites she was ethnically connected to could somehow enhance her power, how spells spoken in her mother tongue could be up to ten times as powerful. She didn’t really understand how it worked, but then again, she hadn’t been understanding much of anything lately.
The first thing Harry could think of as she began to come to was whether or not it was normal for snakes to fly, blood red and swirling right before her eyes. She thought she saw some fish too, pretty blues and yellows and purples, dancing across the dim, unfamiliar ceiling. And then someone slapped her real hard, and Harry went “Ungh,”
But for all that Pius Thicknesse was an absolute fucking wanker, he was right about one thing; for as much as Lucius Malfoy loved his daughter, he could not deny that she was a weak link— emotional, impulsive, too much Black and not enough Malfoy. And after all, what kind of man would he be if he placed the entirety of Malfoy Enterprises into the impotent palms of one little girl?
“Again, it differs from culture to culture, but most kids here get them at age eleven, when we start magical schooling. Your parents died when you were only seven, so it’s likely they just never had the chance to bond you to one. It’s a pretty big deal, for English wizarding families, the bonding ritual. You might even have a stone, tucked away somewhere safe.”
In the ebony doorframe stood a man wearing a black suit over a black button-up. His long, dark hair was pulled back in a seemingly effortless bun, threaded with white baby’s breath. Dark tattoos peaked out from beneath his collar, and Harry could see a million and two demons swirling in the grey of his eyes. How had they forgotten to lock the door? Harry
When Draco spoke, every word that slipped through her lips was precisely calculated, meticulously chosen from the reservoir of thoughts stacked neatly inside her brain and presented to the rest of the world on a shiny silver platter of eloquence and charm. She didn’t always say what she meant— she was brilliant at compartmentalization, and knew which words were soft and pliable and which were sharp, indispensable weapons— but she always, always meant what she said. So maybe that was what hurt Harry the most: the fact that whenever Draco was being cruel, she more than meant it; this was a girl who made no miscalculations. Or maybe what was worse was the fact that Harry let herself reach a point where she could be hurt by the words of a girl who, in the end, she scarcely knew at all.
Draco didn’t seem to notice Harry at all, too caught up in her own torment to acknowledge her presence.

around others, and it almost put her on edge, as if it was all just a hyper-detailed fever dream and she was bound to wake up at any moment, disoriented and alone.
“I like your hair better curly, you know,” Draco said, voice low and matter-of-fact. She reached out, slowly, and tugged softly at a lone curl, watched it stretch beneath her fingertips and spring back up upon release, eyes lit up in utter delight at just how much her nonchalance was pissing Harry off. Harry clenched her teeth but did nothing, even more pissed off because she liked it better curly, too. Suddenly, she was wondering if maybe she should relax it, or shave it all off again. “For next time.”
“Esh ile jabek hon? Ma kfeyt bil banat el european?”
let them get away with this.
“I’d treat you right,” she continued, her fingers curled softly around Harry’s willstone, “Keep my hand on your waist so everyone would know you’re mine, only mine. I’d show you off, introduce you to every single one of my homophobic aunts and racist uncles as
The thing about pain, Harry thought as she bled out onto the shining ivory floors, was that it does everything it can to make sure you feel it. It crawls beneath your skin like filthy parasites, twists into your veins like the flames of hell, squeezes your organs into whiskey wet rags until all you can do is feel God’s wrath crash into you, the waves of an Abrahamic typhoon you
“No, you’re not,” Draco replied, wiping the back of her hand across her face, a streak of red painting her cheek, “But you’re brilliant at pretending you are.”
“We did,” Draco replied, the corners of her lips pulling upwards, teasing. Harry focused on the energy in the room and twisted, pulling from the pain pooled in her belly and pushing it all out. The others grunted in discomfort, but Draco only smiled wider. She was a serpent, and serpents thrived in agony. “Then we framed Sirius, because he’s a filthy scumsucker and always has been. Well, it’s not exactly
“In another universe, this is our first date,” Someone said, tone sweet as honeyed wine. She didn’t have to guess— she’d know that voice anywhere. Harry looked up, and Draco was seated right across from her, just as effortlessly stunning as when she’d seen her last. It should’ve pissed her off, the way Draco held her beauty like a knife in her hand, but she couldn’t help but respect it instead. Too many pretty girls thought they were ugly, and Harry had had enough of stupid, powerless girls. Draco dropped a second straw into the melting strawberry milkshake, and took a long sip, raising an eyebrow at Harry.
The thing she loved most about Edinburgh, Harry thought as she swirled her nearly-empty cocktail glass, wasn’t the centuries of history infused within its gorgeous cobblestone streets, the endless array of mouth-watering restaurants lining said streets, or even the fact that 90% of scotch was made within its very borders— and trust me, you did
her gut told her, and she decided to listen.
Behind the shining portrait of Jesus Christ was a mafia backroom that put all of Hollywood's depictions to shame. Plush velvet sofas were strewn around the soft carpeted room, and on each of the walls hung endless displays of forbidden luxury: they were surrounded by priceless antiques and surely-stolen artwork, blades still stained with blood and guns so meticulously ornate that if they were pressed to your skull you'd think of Michelangelo before you thought of God. The physical was only the tip of the iceberg, though; the entire room thrummed with power, so much so that Harry could swear that the ground was shaking beneath her boots.
“Apologies, sir,” Pius Thicknesse said, his words jittery and his nose sniffling, “You must know that you host one hell of a party.” He smiled, and an insidious mixture of grime and filth dripped from between his teeth.
“Three,” she continued, “I ask the questions,” she scanned the room with her eyes, irises lit up with flaming power, made sure everyone knew
“Oh yes sir, we should expect them to stick around for quite some time now, you know how they are, stubborn lot… but it’s all low profile sir, nothing to worry about… they haven’t found anything substantial for quite some time now, oh yes, we haven’t given the dirty bastards any chances…” Thicknesse rambled, his face twitching oh so slightly as he spoke, “Made sure the case ran cold, you know, sir, I have been working quite hard for some time now, and I’ve been thinking— ”
She pointed to the blonde haired girl next, who was busy admiring the dust mites shining in the moonlight, “That’s Luna Lovegood. Hermione hates her—”
Harry reached down to feel her gut, which was slashed open and trickling blood; what a shame— she really did like this dress. She nodded at Hermione, and let her guide her to the bathroom. She may be extremely stubborn and just the slightest bit stupid, but she also knew that Hermione was right; if she delayed her wounds any longer, she’d end up in the ICU, and that was never a fun time.
On the night of July 31st, 1997, beneath streetlights mistaken for stars and midst rotting garbage washed up by the edge of the river, Harry Potter decided that she knew three things and three things only: first, that her parents were killed by the Blacks; second, that Cedric Diggory was killed by the Malfoys; third, that one day, she would kill Draco Malfoy with her bare hands.
The thing about Harry and being afriad was that she just didn’t give a fuck— she wasn’t scared of death or heights or spiders or God —after what happened, her body had evolved so that fear was a chemical formula that just couldn’t be registered by the enzymes of her brain. 65% water, bones wrapped in nerves and muscles and blood and skin, ugly thoughts that kept them up at night and a heart that was never taught to work just right, those were the things that made a man. So how could Harry be scared of Sirius Black, when all of those things lived inside of her, too?
And then there was Sirius Black, splayed out in the midst of it all with his perfect suit and his perfect hair and his dead, empty eyes, and Harry could feel ghosts swirling inside her bones. For a second, she thought she saw the shadow of a smile, saw in this shell a shadow of the Uncle Paddy who carried her on his shoulders and chased her across the yard and tucked her in at night and loved her more than all the stars in the sky.
Cedric said, the lilt of his words soft and smokey, “Ena fi asfura jet wi zaretny lalet ams.”
“Actually, I’m here to do you a favor,” She said, her elbow on the table and her cheek cupped casually by the palm of her hand, “That one,” She glanced inconspicuously to the left, “Won’t give you what you want. He’s not very, well, female-oriented. Also, he’s useless— all he did was fuck Blaise in his father’s office, which didn’t go over very well, as I’m sure you could imagine.”
“Yes, yes, will do sir… you take care of yourself, now, sir, we need another heir out of you!” Thicknesse laughed awkwardly, slowly snaking out of his boss’ presence in the hope of snorting a couple more lines before sunrise.
Millie laughed, and gestured for the two of them to follow her behind the bar, and towards a large, hanging portrait that was nearly taller than Harry herself.
Harry thought, as she sat in the empty bathtub, watching the patterns swirl on the tiles overhead. Hermione was on her tip-toes, scouring through the medicine cabinet and looking stressed, which really did not make Harry feel any better. “What’s a willstone?”
It was safe to say that Harry was beyond frustrated, and arguably edging on delirious. So when she looked up from the ginormous tome of a book nestled in her lap and saw Draco Malfoy, dressed in a pair of sky blue jeans and a loose white t-shirt, wire-frame glasses balanced on the edge of her nose and head tilted back against the adjacent bookshelf, she didn’t even have it in her to be surprised. It felt odd to see her dressed so casually; the lack of skin-tight designer clothing made her seem softer, less imposing than usual. She seemed
When Harry looked at the Daily Prophet warehouse, all she saw was a broken mirror of herself. The towering aluminum walls were riddled with rust and faded with sun, half-heartedly locked away for decades, and not a single soul had ever bothered to transgress. She felt a strange kinship with this run-down, forgotten old building tucked away in the edges of London, felt the faint echo of all the stories it held as she ran her fingers across the ragged walls and pushed the door open, slowly, gently, wary to its needs and responsive to its reactions. And when the Daily Prophet warehouse looked at Harry, all it saw was a broken mirror of itself; a faux-fierce little girl in a white button down, sleeves rolled up and heart tucked in, locked away in her rattling ribcage for decades, and not a single soul had ever bothered to transgress.
While her memories of the time were more likely to be whimsical fantasy than fact, there wasn’t much Harry could do to forget the five summers she spent running barefoot through the alleyways of Baghdad, chasing kids who called her Haya instead of Harry and knew nothing better of England than to ask if she’d had tea with the queen yet, or if it was really true that in the west, every man got a Mercedes and every boy got to be David Beckham. While she tried to figure out the best way to tell her friends that she lived in West Country, not heaven, James and Lily sat a safe distance away in her grandmother’s cafe, sharing milkshakes and rolled cigarettes and talking politics with everyone and anyone who would care to listen. So no, this sleazy little wannabe speakeasy did not intimidate her, nor did the beady-eyed men in it; she had her fair share of experiences with Bad, Bad Men, the type who would make these bastards look like little boys in school blazers.

“Not animals,” he says and sips at his tea.
“Perhaps you should figure out what happened to you before you charge in asking questions about me.” With that, the ghost of Draco Malfoy turned his head and faded out of sight.
“It’s a bad time for war,” Draco says. “The famine means people are already stretched thin. We don’t have enough to feed an army.”
Potter shook his head, once, nothing wasted. “No. Gods, no. Just, I think I might have made everything more painful, you know? With my timing.”
“It isn’t really you,” Draco said. “Either of you.”
Draco can hear the fake nonchalance dripping off every syllable. “Yes. Quite,” he says, playing along.
“Yes, I’d like to thank you for that myself. I was getting really tired of all that jazz.”
The cloth slid gently off in his hands, a small cloud of dust turning, for a moment, the late afternoon air golden and gritty between himself and the mirror. And then there he was, reflected back to himself, older than the last time, worn and ripened.
There’s a younger man in denim overalls standing in front of the metal doors to the building. Granger pulls out her badge and he nods at her, glancing quickly over Draco’s distinctive crimson robes and away again. The doors are barred on the outside, and he taps his wand on a mechanism to the side. Tiny springs pop open along the seam and the man forces the thick bar up with a grunt, letting he and Granger slip through a slim margin of open door. It shuts quickly behind them.
“You apologized to me,” Dean points out. “And now we’re friends.”
“Don’t you know, Potter?” Draco asks. “Martyrdom looks so very good, especially during an election cycle.”
“I don’t think I will. I think I’ll keep popping up whenever I feel like it. Ruining your evening might be the only satisfaction left for me.” With that, the ghost of Draco Malfoy trailed out of Harry’s kitchen.
After, time catches up. The people around him react, sound goes back to normal. He’s left with the corpse he made and the blinding, obvious realization of something he’d half-known all along. The Muggle cops come first, before he can contain the scene himself, and then the Italian Aurors take over, and all the while Draco is thinking about that key and how it had felt pressed into his palm.
She smiled, turning her hat around and around in her hands. She’d knit one in the same deep red for him last year. She didn’t need to say a word to Harry; her hand squeezing his forearm told him she understood him perfectly. Maybe better than he did himself, presently. She was the only other person who knew how the flapping of canvas sounded in a forest, when the wind was whipping around on the darkest, coldest Christmas either of them could ever remember.
“Blaise didn’t tell you?” A crack appears; Malfoy looks uncomfortable.
Draco shrugs. “That’s all subjective.”
There is a long pause. “I’m sure that’s not true,” says Harry.
Potter catches him around the waist as he heads for the kettle, and slides sleepy lips against his. Draco smiles into the kiss.
Lucius sits back in his own chair. “To what purpose?” Draco hesitates, and Lucius pounces. “To take your rightful place, or to betray our friends? Is this for—“ He curls his upper lip in disdain, drawing the next word out. “Work?”
“You might as well come all the way in, Weasley,” he says. “I haven’t put any hexes on the rug.”
Harry smiled back, but it hurt. Merlin, did he miss them. He missed their actual physical bodies near his own, and the taps and shoulder bumps, the hands touching his when he was being handed a cup of tea, or pressed against his arm when they were making a point. He’d never realised how many small ways of touching each other they all had between them, or how much he relied on them to feel connected to his own body.
He’s surprised to find Pansy on the other side of his door when he answers the knock. She’s dressed rather plainly—a light blue gown, her hair plaited down her back. He motions her in and dismisses Marcus. She sits lightly on the edge of his bed and he takes the chair in front of his table.
“I forget nothing,” Lucius says, voice brittle and sharp. “But losing a battle doesn’t mean the principles themselves were wrong.”
Draco clears his throat. “I’m going to break into his study. He’s probably not stupid enough to leave anything lying around where I can find it, but it’s worth a shot.”
Potter has an expression on his face that Draco can’t read, and Draco thought he had learned all of Potter’s expressions in the two weeks they’d lived together. Potter walks over and looks out his window. This close, Draco can smell the mint shampoo he prefers and feel the warmth coming off his body. It makes him think about the mornings he woke to Potter pressed against him in the bed, makes him
Charms for tidying up.
Draco shakes his head. “What completely unnecessary subterfuge. Why?”
Blaise turns his glass around and around in front of him. “I don’t divulge things about my friends,” he says. “But I would encourage you not to assume anything. I find it’s always best to get answers straight from the source.”
“Right.” Potter sounds winded, too, and his shirt is rumpled. They look at each other for a long moment, and then Potter says, “I’m going to try to make a Floo call to Hermione. If I use her home address it shouldn’t set off any alarms here.”
“Nasty habit,” Potter says, exhaling a curl of smoke. “But I picked it up during Auror training. Helps me relax.”
They hear him before they see him— a low rumble like a cat’s purr, but louder and much, much deeper. Then the young Welsh Red bounds out from the large barn and down the little run leading to field.
Draco turns, planning to go through the paperwork on his desk first. “Malfoy!” says Robards, and Draco turns back to see his boss weaves across the room toward him.
“No. Things that bees like would be good. My hives are just back there, behind the apple tree.”
to be better than that. He believed in second chances. He believed— if not in clean slates, at least slates turned over to a fresh, blank side. But Malfoy needled and pushed and—
Carys shakes her head, but says, “I don’t know. I never told either of them. Iwan or Tom. I had only just realized I was carrying her when Iwan came back.” She’s looking at Draco, and not at Draco— her eyes focused on something only she can see, something happening in a different time than they sit in now. “It was like someone coming back from the dead. I didn’t believe my eyes at first. And to my everlasting shame, as soon as I felt the joy I knew I would never tell him. I told myself Iwan couldn’t bear it, but I— I think it was me who couldn’t.”
. Not a prince. Not—not a man with anything to offer besides himself.”
“It’s just, if these are— well, priceless pureblood heirlooms or something, you might not want—“
“Oh? What kind?” When Draco doesn’t answer, Potter says, “You know— man, woman? Old, young?”
“How likely is war?” Draco asks.
, though, and he’d been half-heartedly running away ever since.
“You’re in Azkaban,” Harry repeated. “You’re alive. You didn’t die at all.”
The clock ticked away, relentless and excruciating, and Malfoy stayed silent the rest of the night.
“Good,” says Granger briskly. “Then let’s get down to it. The building that was bombed was the Society for Magical Historical Preservation, as you all know. The Traditional Wizarding Order, a political wing of The Sacred Twenty-Eight and the party putting McLaggen up for a seat in the Wizengamot, applied for a permit to host a rally there. The rally was supposed to happen yesterday.” She pauses, and shuffles some papers in front of her. “And yet, we received an anonymous tip late last night that they didn’t plan to hold any event at all yesterday. I had some people do some digging, and the information seems to check out. They did no liaising with the staff to set anything up. No orders were placed with the usual crews for banners or refreshments. The only invitations sent were to the press who usually cover these things— there was no advance notice to the public.”
Dean smiles and shakes his head. “You haven’t even seen them. How do you know you’ll like them?”
“No,” Harry agrees. “No, that’s true. Well, come in. Can I get you some tea?”
Better than alright.
He can hear things happening behind the door when he rings the bell— thumping getting louder and closer, and some sort of muted wailing of words he can’t make out. Then the door is wrenched open and Potter appears, looking harried.
All the Saturday Hogwarts games.
"So however Dolohov caught wind that we're on to him, he's going to be more on guard now," Neville is saying behind him.
. I want them to look a lot like this.
Granger shrugs. “I’ve found it best never to assume the worst is over, unfortunately. Constant vigilance, and all that.” She smiles to herself, like she’s thinking of a private joke.
Draco raises his eyebrows. “Isn’t he rather short?”
“More,” says Potter, his voice all rough and dark. The voice he uses when Draco’s cock is inside him. When Draco gets on his knees in front of him. When he wants it, when he wants
“Yes, Master Draco.”
“No one, I guess.” Potter looks tired, and kind of sad. “But I’ve watched you. I
“If I say ’Weasley,’” Blaise replies, turning for the back door with a big brass key he’s just produced from seemingly nowhere, “You might think I’m talking about Ronald.”
“Cassius?” Pansy opens a drawer in the side table, and pulls out a little silver holder and a pack of cigarettes. The silver glows, briefly, when she puts one in and suddenly the smell of fine tobacco and a touch a clove begins to permeate the room. “He’s a bit of a shit, of course, but—“
“I didn’t—”
“A consignment. At Zabini Imports.” Potter continues to look confused. “You’re selling something there, aren’t you?”
“How’d you know? You’re in Azkaban.”
This is the thing: he and Draco never needed to schedule time to be romantic before. When they’d first gotten together, they hadn’t even called it romance. It was a one-off, and then something they did in secret because anything else was too complicated. When they started dating officially, and then moved in together, even the everyday stuff felt new and weirdly exciting, because they were doing it together.
Potter turned his head slightly on the throw pillow, but said nothing.
“Distinctive is certainly one word you could use to describe this. I can think of several others. Shall I list them?”
He swallows, and nods.
"I think I'll just take the Portkey and stay with Neville tonight," she says. "I can brief him and be back in the morning."
He sees the little girl jump off the last step and into the kitchen, then sidle up to her mother. “Run up to the sanctuary,” Carys says, cupping the girl’s cheek with her palm. “Tell your da to come.”
“Something about this genuinely minuscule flat makes you look good, Potter,” Malfoy whispered against the back of his neck, and he shivered helplessly. “…Bigger,” Malfoy added, and Harry shifted, turning around to look at him.
Draco considers. “Use Sayre. There are several branches of that family, and most of them are in Ireland and terribly difficult to keep straight. No one will find it odd if you say you went to school in the Americas, either. Lots of them do.”
“Ghosts don’t even eat,” he found himself saying, as if that was the crucial matter at hand.
“I’ll make your excuses at dinner,” Warrington is saying, and the sound of footsteps can be heard moving around in front of the cabinet. They both stop, still pressed together. Goyle says something Draco can’t quite make out, and something bumps lightly into the door behind his head. Potter’s fingers tighten on his waist.
Harry just smiles at her, and she stops. She grins back at him.
“He did a tremendous job,” says Blaise, looking out over the garden.
“I can’t explain it through logic alone. He’s great in a fight—intuitive and efficient. He notices things. He’s quick in just about every way you can think of. But most of all, I just trust him. He’s a good man, and he won’t be bought with coin or swayed by whispers. He’s loyal.”
“Yeah,” said Harry. “I’m alright.”
“Don’t you, Potter?” Malfoy was studying him again. “You’re a newly promoted Auror. Hero of the wizarding world.”
Potter had just smiled at him, like he knew something about the joke that Draco didn’t. It was annoying, really, the way Potter seemed to think he knew more about Draco than he had any right or reason to. The way he took things Draco said without the venom intended, sometimes.
“Well, no. He’s not answering owls or calls. He clearly doesn’t want me to come over.”
, comes back before lunchtime, and the rest of the day, hour after hour, Harry feels lighter and lighter.
stupid.” He sat up straight, and the sound of his belt coming unbuckled filled the room. His weight left, and then came back to Harry’s own body. Harry caught his breath as Malfoy leaned heavy over him, one hand trailing along the sensitive part of his side, the other rubbing his cock along Harry’s arse. Tonight, maybe, he’d go that one step farther, the one leap they hadn’t made.
“No. This is my home. I wish I could stay here. I hate the capital.”
“Good for you.” She glares at him.
But Granger is already climbing. “I wouldn’t dream of burdening you with too much knowledge,” she calls back, and he sighs deeply before he starts climbing, too.
“Her family offered my father a portion of their lands in exchange for money. Pansy was the pretext. She’s the only child, but her father is giving the estate to a nephew instead. As you can imagine, the betrothal was not a happy one for her.”
“I’d have thought that was obvious,” Potter says. He still hasn’t put his shirt back on and his hair is a mess. He smiles at Draco, like it’s the easiest thing in the world.
“It’s not always a positive experience,” he said. “When you look so much like your father.”
Malfoy was quiet. The sound of the clock chiming midnight in the hall came and went again. “Why are you telling me this?” he finally asked.
Potter raises his eyebrows, but his lips twitch at the corners, just a little. “What an incredible coincidence,” he says dryly. “What kind of trip?”
Malfoy didn’t look up, just continued tracing invisible lines across his skin. “I’m giving Astoria the Malfoy family ring this week,” he said. “The wedding is mostly formality and politics. The ring is the real binding.”

Sirius nodded and led her into the living room. "Take a seat. I'll bring a mug in.."
Harry smiled and rolled onto his side, "he's just more active, I think he likes being close to you."
Lucius eyes seem to flare in a mix of anger and horror. While Narcissa's eyes settled on Harrys stomach. "Draco! How could you be so reckless?" Lucius snapped. Draco paled, "It is our family name you are wilfully destroying!" Lucius said sternly. "With this bastard half-blood..."
“Bye Mum” Draco said, before hanging up the phone, he stepped out of the telephone box, shivering in the cold air.
“So helpful” Hermione muttered.
Draco collapsed onto the bed, out of breath, his cock wet and arms aching. Pregnancy sex was quite a workout. He looked over at Harry who was laying contently, rubbing his belly comfortingly. "Morning..." Draco smirked amused.
“Papa, how many boxes are there?" Scorpius groaned as he lifted a cardboard box and carried it down from the attic.
Harry chuckled and kissed Draco's cheek. "Well I'm okay with whatever you do," he said honestly.
He suddenly started to feel very out of his depth. His instinct was to flee or on the other end of the spectrum non call out for Draco at the top of his lungs.
"I know. But I can't leave with my new job. We'll figure it out...but you know it's not the wisest idea to be out in public" Draco pointed out rubbing Harrys belly slowly. "They'll be headlines tomorrow."
“And you’re a really good fuck Potter” Draco admitted.
Hermione visibly slid away from him. “Brave of you.”
"Mum! I resemble at that remark" Ron said horrified.
Draco nodded, "I.." He looked down at his son. "Molly. Would you like to hold him? Hold James?"
“You didn’t miss much,” Scorpius admitted, frowning.
“Just. This guy.... he...it’s nothing...” Draco said looking over his shoulder.
“No, it’s a baby.”
"Merlin. Shit. Right..." Draco swore a little flustered. He fumbled and turned on the light, Harry and Draco both wincing as they blinked.
Draco blinked, his face panicking. "You're not in labour, are you?"
“You know not! Whether it was his wisdom or his fear” Millie answered sounding as uninterested as he was.
Draco smiled a little. “I don’t mind that one. Let’s save that. We have four children to potentially name.”
“Well. My children will go to their grandmothers. And I was perhaps thinking” Harry paused, he hadn’t really planned it. Molly would have welcomed him of course, but under the circumstances giving her space would be more important.
“Yes. I said I would prank you, but I didn’t and instead you spent all day stewing and driving yourself crazy” Harry said grinning, very pleased with himself.
“I’m Harry Potter”
“James has Quidditch,” Draco dismissed.
“You must have patience ma’am” Millie Benson answered. A brunette with blonde streaks piled up into a loose bun on her head that sagged a little.
“No, you don't," Harry chuckled, wrapping his arms around Draco's middle, which looked a little like a large pumpkin stuffed under his jumper.
“Errr. Yes?” Draco replied
To become so overbearing, protective, and sweeter than Honeydukes on a Hogsmeade trip.
They were all bunched up against a fence waiting for the changing of the guard. Hermione was enthusiastically lecturing him on the history of the castle. Draco was tuning her out. “Draco. Draco?” Hermione said nudging him.
"Only God can judge your sins," Reverend said grimacing. “Bring the torches!”
"I'm pregnant" Harry said putting his hands on his stomach. "It's Draco's..." he explained.
“Alright, relax Draco, your quite safe,” Lucinda reassured calmly.

Draco brushed him off, “If I didn’t love him, I’d have pushed him off a cliff years ago” Draco remarked, as he walked Ron to the Floo.
Hermione remained silent. Harry paused, “Only as a last resort.”
"It's just a contraction. I've been getting them all day" Harry said grunting.
“Harry. Are you okay? He didn’t force himself on you?” Hermione asked worriedly.
Ron’s scream echoed around the room, Draco letting his teeth sink into Ron’s shoulder. Draco let him scream as he pulled his mouth away, watching intently as the Lycanthropy fought for dominance. It wasn’t long before Ron arched suddenly howling in pain, that the transformation began. Ron seized as his limbs began to elongate and hair began to sprout and thicken. While his face began to transform into a wolf’s howling maw.
"She suggested Lucius," Draco said simply.
"Yes. It can happen and not just with Male Pregnancies. Females too" Mrs Malone explained. "The important thing is to relax, not to overly stress yourself and something does feel wrong contact me."
Harry shifted and leant back. “I didn’t leave the Aurors because I got bored. It... well was the opposite.” Draco leaned over and refilled Harrys glass, tapping the glass with his wand to cool the water. “It was a whole thing with some neo death eaters, idiots who were trying to pay tribute to Voldemort. They were attacking muggles, and a few of us Aurors went after them” Harry took a long sip of his glass. “They were using unforgivable curses, Clayton Hummel he hit with Crucio. And....I started having flashbacks to the war.”
“I’m going to take a leek before I head home” Ron said rising from his seat at the bar. “Say Hello to the missus for me”
“Lunch is almost over. Did you get any sleep last night?” Otto Clarence II nudged.
"Fine. Don't make me regret it" Draco said sharing a kiss with Draco.
“Yes Headmaster?” Harry asked turning towards him.
“Call me. Yeah?” Harry grinned.
"He's Fine" Hermione reassured.
“Hermione” Harry groaned, as he looked across to see the congregation swarm in, snarling fangs out and their fingernails long and yellowed.
“Harry. This is my area of expertise, and you are my husband. Please listen to me” Draco said slipping back into his Healer voice. “Sit and relax, if you're that worried, I’ll man the bar and you rest upstairs...”
, Draco as a child
Harry shook his head and as he walked downstairs. He groaned and climbed into the Floo, emerging into the sitting room of Malfoy Manor. High walls of dark polished wood lit up by the flickering fireplace. A leather couch facing towards him and a high-backed sitting chair placed near a side table complete with a crystal decanter siting full of a presumably alcohol. As Harry turned attempting to find his bearings he glimpsed a large portrait hanging above the fireplace. Lucius, Narcissa and Draco, all looking down at him with distaste, other than Draco who looked as young as he had in first year, complete with spoilt attitude but was smiling at Harry.
“Afraid you’ll fall in?” Draco commented sarcastically.
"Ta, Thank Ron" Harry smiled and took some big gulps, and grimaced. "Strange aftertaste."
"Let's Apparate. I'd rather not face them..." Draco sighed honestly.
Ron nodded and took a beer out of the six pack and offered it to Draco. "Beer?"
“What?” Harry said clearly shocked, and what sounded like him dropping the phone. “Is it mine?”
“Twins?” Harry said, with perhaps slightly too much enthusiasm.
"I know. I know. It's the only thing keeping me going at the moment" Draco admitted honestly.
"In bed. He's on bedrest for now until he gives birth. He's overdue" Draco said firmly. "If you'll excuse me, I'll prepare his breakfast and I'll return." Narcissa nodded, and Draco left the room.
"Oh, no, he was really angry,” asked Scorpius. “Did you have an affair? Do we have a secret sibling?" He was Albus’s fraternal twin. He had platinum white hair and a pair of curious grey eyes peering over the top of his glasses, which were more rectangular than Harry’s. Scorpius resembled Harry's father, James - at least according to the few photos Harry had, anyway.
“I’m still scared.”
"Very much so."
His father was walking by her side, dark hair and balding, tall with a belly that stretched against every suit. It was a worrying sign of his future, fat and balding.
"Well, at least you've planned it out," Hermione commented wryly. “But you’ve got a birth plan?”
“No, not at all,” Harry reassured. “So four is a big unexpected surprise.”
“Albus, can you teach Callum to shave?” Harry asked.
“No, he’s with his Mum this Christmas” Harry said awkwardly. Scorpius say down on a stool.
“Oh fuck” Ron hissed grabbing his wand.
Harry bent down and pulled a plate of Alfredo pasta from the oven. “Here you go.”
Sirius stood in the doorway watching his godson and his boyfriend lay shirtless on the couch. He didn't want to necessarily say they were lazy. They weren't, although Harry was certainly looking the thickest he had in his life. But that was if anything down to Harry not particularly curving back his cravings.
“I hope we get asthma,” Albus muttered under his breath to Scorpius as they passed each other.
Then to Draco’s shock Hermione ran up, her Curly hair bristling, as she wore some odd uniform that had a long black robe over the top. “Hermione?” Draco asked confused, next to her was a lanky red head in similar robes.
"It hurts!" Harry sobbed. Draco hesitantly leaned forward to see what was going on, he started to pale.
“Malfoy!” Draco jumped in his seat and glared back to the board. “Are the lyrical words of Shakespeare boring you?” Mr Hubbard said his old lined face creasing into a firm distasteful frown.
Draco turned and cupped his face exasperated, he took a deep breath and turned back to Harry. “We’re closing, and I’ll put some silencing charms on the bedroom so you can sleep properly.”
“Or if you do clean up” His father said quietly.
“Oh” Harry said realising. “Give me an hour” Harry insisted.
Harry smirked. "I will not" Draco said perturbed.
Draco grinned. “Thank you,” he said, taking it.
“Perfectly. Half an hour and he’ll wake up; he’ll need to take strong pain relief for a few days yet. Congratulations Harry.”
Draco stuffed the bit of paper with Harrys number into his pocket.
Standing in the centre of the living room was Draco Potter. His expression was firm and judging; it was a look that Harry feared. Draco's body had changed considerably since Hogwarts - he was much thicker, but after four pregnancies it was hardly something Harry could fault him for. “I knew I should have listened to Hermione and got your dick chopped off,” Draco muttered, eyes narrowing at Harry.
“Forbidden?!? Papa, you can’t be serious?” Scorpius asked, practically laughed from the absurdity.
“Oh, come on. You tasted the batter, you said it was fine” Harry replied leaning against the kitchen cabinet. He smiled, taking the bottle from Draco.
“Yeah, well after this git took you. We got locked up without our wands in a church cellar. Three months until they finally decided to burn us at the stake. When Draco intervened” Ron muttered. “Would have liked to be rescued sooner.”
“Figured out what?” Draco questioned looking up.
Once they were all off the bus, they’d walked through the station arcades, full of shops and cafes that Draco could only dream of shopping in. They joined a long que behind some Private school kids to enter the Impressive Castle. He asked the head teacher if he could go to the toilet, as Draco was one of the few sensible kids, she let him go. Draco walked around the corner and leant against the fence as he lit up a cigarette. Peace and Quiet.
“Oh, absolutely not. Could you imagine? No, I’m unconscious through the whole thing,” Draco said wryly. “Come sit down and keep me company, while your Father runs around like a footless chicken.”
Draco's hand gripped Harrys tighter, "He meant the baby" Draco said bitterly.
"Where then" Draco said gesturing with his hands for Harry to spill the location.
“Honestly, I can’t leave you alone at all. Three months, I thought you'd left, and instead, I find out you've been captured by villagers" Draco muttered.
“Call me missus and I’ll skewer you with my wand” Draco commented from the doorway.
Having his friends and boyfriend to keep him company was helpful. Hermione was busy reading every book in the library, while Draco began to enjoy Ron’s company as they made the mansion considerably more liveable.
"Come on" Draco sighed shaking his head as he led Harry away. "Also? Pyjamas? Was getting dressed not a priority?"
“Ohhh” Harry moaned groaning with an intense desire. “Alpha” He whined.
"Harry. Draco" Kingsley Shacklebolt said with a warm smile. Draco visibly tensed as he turned and offered a hesitant smile. Noticing his boss, editor of the daily prophet Barnabas Cuff was standing behind.
"Will they" Harry snarled, before he winced in pain, watching as Draco silently crept up the stairs and leaned into Hermione's dying body. Licking at her neck and leaning in to give her the bite. “You're not having them.”
“Do you prefer concussion” Draco replied smirking.
Harry pouted.
And then Draco was asleep. Oddly it felt like the smoothest of any of the births, which Draco had proceeded with naturally. Draco was laid out; his belly exposed and was covered with an oily blue substance. Lucinda was calm and looking not even remotely flustered as she waved her wand over Draco's belly and a hole appeared, exposing Draco's innards.
Draco approached as Harry held the baby against his chest. He nuzzled up to Harry, concern, and fear and worry as he moved close. Harry leaned in and felt Draco sniff and rub against their baby. "
“Scorpius! I got my present from my.... Dad!” Albus trailed off staring.
"Well, okay, you could name one Hermione?”
Soon they were at each other’s throat’s wands exploding with light as Harry felt his body contort as light hit him. Like magic.
"Careful, with the way Hugo and Scorpius go at it there could be grandchildren," Lily joked.
The goblet hit the stone floor with a clang. “I feel funny” Harry groaned pained, as he clutched his stomach. They all turned and watched with horror as Harry’s stomach began to expand, as he went from only looking a few months pregnant to full term. Harry pulled himself up, and a sound of water rushing as his water broke. "I think the Baby is coming!" Harry groaned pained.
"Look. I've applied at the Prophet and a few other places; I'll see what happens." Draco admitted truthfully.
“Not quite. Although moving to the manor might be something we have to consider,” Draco admitted, honestly.
“Potter and I have been at it for years. I can handle some harmless pranks” Draco insisted.
Draco had been on Harry’s back about quitting his job or at least taking extended leave. Harry kept avoiding the topic, or at least dismissing it. What was most frustrating was that Draco was right.
“Watch it” Draco drawled eyes narrowing. As he headed behind the bar.
"I'll leave you to it" Draco groaned getting up.
“I hate you,” Draco muttered tediously.
“Oh” Ron said gently. “Was it bad?”
“Draco!” Harry protested. “Please sit. You know I like your body. Otherwise, you wouldn’t be pregnant!”
“Harrykins!” His mother said sounding enthusiastic if her face didn’t show it. She hugged him affectionately. “How’s your boyfriend Algy?” She asked refusing to let him break the hug.
"Fine. I'll be down in a minute." Draco groaned.
Harry pulled the horses to a stop and climbed down. "Everyone could just be in bed."
He heard the shower running upstairs, Draco probably. He was always an early riser; Harry would sleep into two a clock if he Draco let him. Which would backfire spectacularly as Harry would be considerably grumpy all afternoon.
“Ronald Weasley” A voice soothing voice called, he turned towards the gates. A figure in black stood calmly. “I have a task for you. Perfect for a sinner like yourself.”
“We can try,” Harry smiled. “And I’ll absolutely get my tubes tied.”
“Mhmm,” sighed Draco, relaxing into Harry’s arms.
“Clearly Hermione they do!” Ron said.
Harry took Draco’s hand and cupped his face, “before we go back to hating each other” Harry said as he kissed him firmly with tongue. It felt good.
Harry nodded and hugged his godfather. "Thankyou. But I can't see it coming to that."
Harry shook his head, “I have work to do.”
"Good luck with his parents" Sirius added genuinely, "And if it goes badly, Draco is welcome here." Sirius commented with genuine hesitation but knew it was for the best.
“Well Pay attention? How about you pick up the reading then. Act Four, Scene Two” Mr Hubbard said firmly.
Ron got up and stretched. “Good idea. Don’t mind if I use your Floo do you?”
"Now I intend to be in the room when the baby is being born as frankly, you'll be as useless as your father" Narcissa commented.
"I... uhh.." Draco said a little thrown. "Sort of..."
“I wasn’t going to mention that Ron!” Hermione said staring at Ron.
Draco scowled bitterly. "Shut up Father" Draco warned protectively. "Don't talk to my boyfriend like that!"
“Yes, four children. Four of your wretched spawn. Four! I am almost forty-five. I’m far too old to be doing this, you git!” Draco exclaimed, slapping Harry’s chest.
Sirius yawned as he walked out of the kitchen with a mug of coffee. His mother would hate that, Sirius loved it particularly the collection of Novelty mugs he used with guests. His mother would have found that distasteful, so it made one of Sirius favourite things. His current mug was one that said '#1 Grandpa!' In novelty letters.
Draco launched himself at the Reverend Trask digging his claws into his shoulders. With great pain, Harry reached up and took the baby as the Reverend toppled backward. The Reverend waved his knife attempting to shake off Draco.
“Draco. Before you curse me, why are you doing this?” Harry asked casually, “I’m aware of our history. But I’ve been trying to be nice, make an effort even.”
Harry’s face lit up and he stroked Draco’s stomach. “Hi babies, it’s your Dad; I can’t wait till your all here. It’s going to be wonderful.”
Draco didn't seem to hear her. Harry looked at Draco, steadily breathing. His other hand rubbing his stomach expectantly. "My hands going numb."
“I didn’t let him do that with Caelum and I’m not letting him do it this time,” Draco reassured her. “Do you have any suggestions?”
Harry folded his arms and glared at Draco; he wanted a real answer.
“It’s for Harry!” Ron barked out suddenly, pushing Draco away.
Harry did neither just stood rooted to the spot, nerves welling inside him. Doing his best to ignore the huffs and disdainful sniffs the painting was making behind him.
Harry chortled. “It’s so very tempting love. But I know how you think,” Harry grinned embracing him warmly. “Big pregnant belly and all.”
Harry shook his head and gritted his teeth as the pain washed over him. "Merlin! Fuck!" Harry swore in pain struggling to remember his breathing.
"Bit of both. I'm good at being a disappointment" Draco said with a sigh as he leant his head back and drained his beer.
“Sixteen weeks. Not particularly what I want to discover in what was supposed to be a normal healer’s appointment,” Draco said, lifting up his shirt. “Look, I’m already showing.”
Harry nodded considering, then leaned in and kissed Draco firmly. “I love you too” he agreed.
The beast roared at the sight of the blade throwing the table at the others. Harry was thrown backwards and slipped on the rug, his head slamming against the stone hearth as everything went dark.
Harry under any other circumstance may have found it incredibly attractive, but the fact that he was steadily growing an infant inside his body was complicated.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Once I actually let Draco work with me. He made me go to therapy and he helped me manage it. Unload everything”
"No, you’re fine. Your honesty fine, I promise..." Draco said earnestly, determined his Parents didn't drive Harry into a hormonal crying fit. "Mother is dinner ready yet?"
"Papa?" Scorpius's eyes narrowed.
“No. I’m not Potters butler” he snapped firmly. He pulled out a black wooden rod. The hair on the back of Draco’s neck stood on its end. The dream.
“And that’s fine. But you know you both have a strong support network,” Hermione reassured. “How’s Draco coping?”
“The instructions are pictographs. Even Weasley would have managed.”
“Hermione will understand” Ron said.
“Well, I think if left to my own devices. I wouldn’t have had children. But I also don’t regret any of you either,” Draco reflected patting Scorpius's knee.
"Support his neck" Hermione insisted, Draco shot her a look and looked down at the baby. It was small and wrinkled, a pink little face with a bald head, his eyes barely open.
“Practical” Draco replied taking the cash, before levitating the beers over.
“That was the Beast.”
“Papa?” Lily asked poking her head around the door. “Dad said they’re going to Apparate the babies out? That can’t be true?”
It took Draco a moment to understand his father's sentence. His face fell, and his hand was shaking. "I better go pack" he said stuttering. Shaken by the turn of events, Harry realised even Draco hadn't quiet expected things to go this south. Harry's hand clenched tightly around his wand. "Please don't Harry" Draco said quietly.
“I like it,” Harry commented, “So does Scorpius.”
“You know they like any excuse,” Ginny chuckled, shaking the cocktail shaker. “And, Draco, you are you still on the moody end of hormonal.”
“Silence daemons. Your vile lies will not tempt us” He practically spat.
“I am inclined to agree,” Draco muttered reaching for his wand.
"Hello, Harry," Hermione smiled. Hugging Harry warmly.
“Tomorrow should be fun” Otto said laying back on his bed.
“Yes, yes, you can complain later about Puddlemere’s inability to choose a good team later,” Draco dismissed as he entered the living room. Caelum was by his side, adhesive bandages plastered over his chin and a couple on his cheeks.
“The Beasts sit inside your head, The Beasts lives among the dead, The Beasts sees you in your bed, and eats you when you're sleeping” Elaine murmured quietly.
“Right and what about you?” Harry asked.
“Well. You’re welcome to come stay at the Manor for Christmas. Scorpius will be coming home this year, as he’ll be busy preparing for exams next year. I thought you might like to join us?” Draco offered.
“Well. I’m pregnant” Draco said simply.
"But!" Draco said his shoulders slumping. "It's my fault. I got him pregnant. I should be there."
"The Baby is starting to crown." Mrs Malone explained. Harry groaned and screamed in pain as the pressure started to build.
“Yeah. The healer we see is certain I'll need to be on bed rest toward the end. Due to my age, it makes it a risky pregnancy,” Draco muttered making air quotes with his fingers.
James snorted. "What happened to you, Cal?"
Scorpius smirked and turned a page on his book. “So you're keeper again for another year?”
But truthfully Sirius could see beneath Draco's doting, he was lost. His identity had been the sole Malfoy heir. Now the only thing in his life was Harry. Not that was necessarily bad, but the clingy streak Draco was developing was interesting to say the least.

Draco’s eyes darted away and then back again. “In person,” he agreed, and looked down at his feet. A bit of pink crept across his cheeks.

Granger glances at him and then away again. “Oh, no reason.”

When Malfoy has returned indoors, Harry follows the raked gravel through the garden until he comes to the large rows of lavender Mrs. Malfoy is tending. She stands up straight when she sees him.

“Hmm,” says Potter. “Well, it’s your flat. Goodnight, then.”
There is only one bed.
“It’s perfect.” Potter looks strangely put out, so Draco looks again. It’s definitely listing to one side.
, I’m not sure anything changes. And friendships can’t be about a ledger.”
Now, he knocks his knuckles on the boxes. He hums to them, and the bees hum back, loud, tumultuous, like a happy dog when its owner walks in the door in the evening.
“We have to tell the bees,” Molly had said, looking out toward the white wooden boxes in the field beyond.
“Explain yourself,” snaps Pansy. Harry’s guards rustle at the disrespect, but Harry holds a hand up to them and they settle down. Draco struggles to remember whether he’d given away any strategic information about their forces and defense to Harry, information that would hurt them now if things come to a head. His mind flows in circles, unable to settle long enough to be sure. Is that why Harry had come in disguise?
Draco shrugs. “I hope you know some decorating charms, too, Potter.”
“Why don’t you come to the Manor tomorrow?” Malfoy says. “You can hear Mother’s plan, and we can go from there.”
that. Potter and I, we’re not—“
“Ten extra minutes,” Granger says, a little smugly.
Draco blinks, and looks back at Potter. “Never mind. It’s just the ghost.”
Hermione hums, emptying the spent tea bags from some mugs on the counter into the trash can. Draco has been drinking enough tea to wash himself out to the Thames since he came to stay with Dean. “The Goyles took in most of Warrington’s stable. She goes over and sees them almost every day. That reminds me, Charlie wanted me to tell you he’s got something you’ll want to see, when you can make it over to the sanctuary.”

. He hears it again every night when he turns off his lamp and closes his eyes. His mouth remembers, in spite of himself, how it felt pressed to the patch of skin revealed: the suprasternal notch, that small hollow pulsing wildly with Harry Potter’s breath. The sound he drew from Potter’s vocal chords with his tongue like a bruise, a smear of left-behind want.
“No one has suggested otherwise, Draco. This isn’t a punishment, for God’s sake. It’s an honor. You think you’ll serve your people better by measuring out the grain and mediating their petty squabbles than by being prince of the kingdom?”
"A change in routine is a change in circumstances." Malfoy turns to face them again and takes a sip of his drink.
He turns to face her fully, grinning, although he can barely make out her features in the dark. He knows them anyway, the way familiar things are known— irrevocably, and by heart. “What?”
Harry watches it until it slides down past Malfoy's collar and disappears.
Snape looks back at him with the same ill-tempered face Harry had known in life, the same slow blink of complete indifference he's been doing since Harry found the small painting while cleaning out Spinner's End.
“Is it clear?” Blaise asks. “I’m not so sure. Anyway, you’re Harry fucking Potter. Since when do you do anything the easy way?”
“Good. It’s strange, hearing about everyone. They all seem to know what they’re doing.”
Malfoy puts in rows of lavender along the sides of the garden, and round bursts of bright perennials in beds down the middle, all running toward the hives in the very back. Asters and yellow fennel and lion’s tail, and bee balm and red salvia and flowering oregano. The roses he feeds a mixture of corrective nutrients, and grafts carefully-cut stems with creamy blooms onto their branches to make them stronger.
The sun’s not up yet, but the darkness is beginning to shift from deep ink to a purpled blue. The edges of the beat-up dresser in the corner are slowly turning distinct and in another half an hour he’ll be able to make out Potter’s parents twirling each other around that fountain in the photo framed on its surface. He’s spent the night again, in spite of himself.
Pansy softens, too. “Cassius,” she confirms. “My parents arranged it.” She picks at her creme brûlée with a spoon. “It’s funny how we still do that, isn’t it?”
“Oh,” Draco breathes, and then he hauls Harry up by the shoulder, presses him back against his chest. His mouth is by Harry’s ear as he wraps a hand around Harry’s cock, and every thrust moves them both.
Harry felt very strange. There was a pressure building in his head, something hard and aching behind his eyes and clutching at his throat. He opened his mouth, but nothing came out.
“A grindylow gimlet.”
Potter starts eating— slice in hand, no silverware in sight, no mention of a plate. He nudges the box a little closer, so Draco reaches in for a slice, too. It’s too hot, but delicious. There are little pieces of pepperoni dotted across the top, their edges curled up all crispy, with puddles of delicious grease inside.
Harry didn’t sit in the parlour that night like he usually did. He told himself he just needed a change of scenery. He was waiting for the kettle to boil and studying a crack in one of the plaster walls when a voice said, “The state of this kitchen is enough to put a wizard off his meal.”
Malfoy is very much awake, and very red-faced, staring at him across the pillows. Luna is sitting cross-ways between them, her head resting on Harry's stomach and her legs draped over Draco. She is eating croissants and dripping honey down onto the bed.
It was nothing so elegant as fucking, the first time they came together. It was teeth just a little too sharp— against a collarbone, on the right-side curve of a jaw, drawing blood from the plushest part of a bottom lip. It was the doorframe digging into the curve his spine was making of its own volition: closer, harder,
Harry kisses him again, this time along his jaw. “Do you want to touch or be touched, Draco?”
It’s ugly, of course. Almost breathtakingly ugly, extraordinary in its clashing ostentation. If it were a person, it would be a brash East Ender, a woman wearing too many prints in colours just the other side of too bright, high heels smacking the concrete on Brick Lane, yelling at cyclists to get out of the way. A walking wince. Someone you’d fall in love with, too, in spite of yourself.
“I can’t believe I didn’t think of this,” Potter says, his arms folded across his chest as he surveys the situation. “I knew she thought we were— well, you know. But it never crossed my mind.”
Draco picks at the end of his own slice. “Why does anyone collect anything, Potter?”
“It’s a Christmas miracle,” Harry said. “You’re buying the first round.”
Luna winds her arm through Neville's. "Oh, yes. Let's go somewhere new."
are we doing?” Potter asks, scratching his head and looking out at the large pasture in front of them. The long grass is bending with the breeze, rippling away from them.
Malfoy made a noise in his throat, and then pulled Harry back with a hand around the back of his neck. It was different from kissing Ginny; harder, sloppier, more teeth. Malfoy’s chest was firm against his own, and when he pulled him closer, their bodies pushing against each other, there was no give.
Maybe you can never be entirely sure of yourself.
after this. Most dragons with injuries like this that survive the healing have to be put down later, anyway. The skin heals over but something inside doesn’t. They get sad, and then mean. Go out of their way to hurt things. People, animals, doesn’t matter. They get too dangerous to keep alive.”
Hermione narrowed her eyes at him, but—reluctantly—dropped it. “I spoke to Jebediah Lockwood, the warden at Azkaban. Malfoy is alive. He went and checked himself, on my insistence.”
." And Draco provides. Harry has known the forest, and now he knows Draco; Draco's hands on his body where Harry's blood rushes to meet him, Draco's mouth around his cock and Draco pressing into him hard, the slap of his skin against every flushed inch of Harry's. He looks at Draco and he touches Draco and he wants and wants and wants, and it feels so good to want him. This desire, ever-renewing, never quite fulfilled. Draco makes him miraculous over and over again.
“Millie,” he says carefully. “Has Greg mentioned the Traditional Wizarding Order?”

“Something else bothering you?” Dean asks as he hovers over the canvas.
“It’s an old charm. Very effective.” She looks back at Potter. “Perfectly legal, too.”
Contemplating his next chess move.
She puts down her fork and turns her full attention on him. Millicent can be quite intimidating when she wants to be. “He hasn’t. What’s it about? I don’t like the sound of it.”
Greg starts scratching something down on some parchment and then stops, the tip of the quill quivering slightly. “Ah,” he says, and looks up at Draco in something like apology.
Draco’s not a First Team Responder, but it hardly matters right now. Alarms are only rung for very serious emergencies: large-scale hostile takeovers, city fires, terror attacks.
“Could I get you a nice cup of earl grey?” she rallied. “It really is good. Just the ticket, really.”
“It’s a poison, but also an aid for the heart, depending on the dosage.”
“It’s over, Potter,” Draco cuts in. He chances a look back at him; Potter is very still and very silent. Draco had been wishing he could see past the Sayre disguise all week, but now it would be easier to look at. It would be easier not to see Harry. “All that is over now.”
“I’m not moping,” Draco says before he can think better of it, and then wishes he’d held his tongue.
enjoying our time away from the farm.”
He rubs the head of his cock into the cleft of Potter’s arse, against the place his fingers have stroked and stretched, and he sucks in a breath and holds it. Pushing into Potter’s body is a feeling he never gets used to; every time he does it he is surprised all over again by the clench and the heat of Potter around his cock. How it knocks the air out of him. How good it feels to thrust into Potter’s body underneath him while Potter grabs for the headboard and gasps.
“Well.” The door pops open with a little force, and Blaise turns back to look at him. “Perhaps not.” His smile, when he gives a full one, is bright and white and dazzling. “Force of habit, Potter. You know how it is.”
it. A tiny noise— just a rush of air, really— comes from Potter behind him. Draco’s breath is coming quick and shallow now, foaming hot little clouds between his face and the wooden panels. Maybe it’s the complete blackness inside this space, maybe it’s the thrill of being hidden but discoverable, but Draco feels wild with it— with how badly he wants this.
Harry liked the way the moonlight filtered through his bedroom curtains and lay gently across the blankets. He liked it even more with Draco beside him.
“Holy fucking Merlin,” Draco mutters. “Would you please stop speaking, forever?" He hesitates, digging his fist into an eye socket. “I think— I might need help.”
When Potter is standing over his sofa, his wand drawn, he pauses, and says, “It’s permanent, this charm. I mean, you can alter it again, but you can’t reverse it back so that it’s in its original state.”
it?’”
— force my way into your life, Draco. I can’t fix things for you. It just doesn’t work like that.”
He takes his place in the bed while Potter is still in the bathroom this time, just to avoid the awkwardness of last night. When Potter comes out, he closes his eyes and listens— there’s a whispering sound like fabric sliding over skin, and a tinny rattle that he thinks are Potter’s glasses being laid on the nightstand.
“So,” Draco says after awhile, rather lamely, “Busy weekend?”
“That’s nothing new,” he muttered, looking in the cabinet for clean-looking glasses. A very warm, very male body suddenly pressed against him from behind.
“I—I didn’t do all I could to keep you out of Azkaban. I didn’t try very hard. I could have—”
“The only remotely surprising news I’m hearing from you right now is that Potter hadn’t
Draco is the only one who watches for the bad man inside himself, too.
Potter shrugs. “He was off today. Slipping.” Potter’s eyes are so green. Green like Slytherin silk ties and the curse he’d just sent sizzling through the afternoon air. Green like deep fields of grass and the color staining the edge of a sky right before a lightning storm. “Besides, I had a Hit Wizard with me, right?”
“Then—“ Draco stops.
Harry thinks about Malfoy, city after city in country after country, tracking down Death Eaters with him. Running out ahead of all his ghosts, turning to greet them all over again as his due. Harry thinks about Malfoy's eyes under a cloud of fairy lights that night in Warsaw.
,” he bit out. “Where the
Shacklebolt offers him a polite smile from his place at the back of the room, and Malfoy nods at him. Granger is there, seated on the Minister’s right hand side, a large roll of parchment in front of her and a quill moving quickly and independently over it as she speaks. And in seats pulled up directly in front of the desk are Potter and Weasley. For a brief moment, Draco wonders if this is some kind of latent childhood punishment, some trap about to spring years later than expected. Shacklebolt waves his wand and a chair appears on the left side of their group. Weasley turns to look over his shoulder, then nudges Potter when he catches sight of Draco. Potter glances behind him, too, but his face betrays nothing.
She leans over to take a mouthful of her soup, and as her hand hovers midair the entire structure trembles atop her head. Any moment it will escape its confines and fall into her bowl. Draco glances at the back wall, where Regulus and Harry’s eyes are both glued to Pansy’s hair as well. A faint smile creeps onto her face. Finally, she takes a careful sip from her spoon and sits back again. Hair still in place.
It makes him think about Draco. About how Draco’s hands on Harry, so long ago, had pinned him down to the world when he was floating. When he needed it most.
Draco’s heart sinks. He’d hoped Goyle wouldn’t be involved in any of this. “What kind of jobs?”
Hermione smiles. “Then I’m happy, too.”
Draco tries to blink the remaining sleep from his eyes. “Alright.”
Harry’s bedroom is bigger these days, and he has an actual bed instead of a mattress on the floor. That’s not the only way this feels new, though. Because Harry has no illusions about his feelings now, about the ways he wants Draco Malfoy, and what that means.
It’s a small group milling around outside on the Hall’s patios and gardens, but Draco can’t remember the last time he felt so surrounded by people he thinks of —firmly or still hopefully— as friends. He stands just apart from them all, drinking it in.
“It’s so strange to me,” Harry says. “All that power, but you can’t even live where you want to.”
“Even Harry Potter,” he agreed with a small smile, which Malfoy returned. He looked softer when he smiled.
“—who to even begin with—” muttered Hermione as she stood up and walked away.
“I hate to bring it up right now, while we’re being so well-mannered,” Potter says after a moment, “But I am wondering about the sofa situation. Or the, er, lack thereof. I don’t suppose you have a guest bedroom?”
“We’re not there, though,” Draco says. “Not everyone is ready.”
Granger sighs, and rubs at her temples. “Maybe. I mean, it would make sense. I don’t know— I can’t pin down where this feeling is coming from.”
Dawlish was coming up for the donated toys.
Friday nights in the Chudley Cannons’ stadium, Butterbeer on tap and salted chips served in paper cones.
is the ghost in his garden. He is both silvered figment and his own solid and flesh face pressing against the window, watching. Spinning and spun, haunting and haunted. Turning and turning, an open mouth with no sound.
When their footsteps have faded down the hall, Malfoy ends the charm and climbs the stairs himself, up toward the bedroom he and Potter share.
“Ah,” says Weasley. “Good. Anyone can get to the bottom of this mess, it’s Hermione. I sort of hope you get to the bastard first, though, to be honest. He deserves something a lot rougher than just a simple arrest.” He shakes his head. “That poor beast. A dragon’s heart is all about the flyin’, you know? Worst thing you can do to ‘em, to take that way.”
Petunia opens her mouth, and it looks like she’s going to argue. “A gift for Harry,” he says before she can, and she shuts her mouth again. “I bet there are a lot of things you could tell him about Lily that he doesn’t know, and that he would very much like to hear. You should invite him for tea and tell him about her.”
Draco has never been so aware of his breath. Drawing air into his lungs. Releasing it in a noisy rush. Something in Harry’s stance changes; his grip gentles and, rather than grappling, their bodies are just leaning against each other. Draco is frozen, his body a mystery to himself in this moment.
“Harry. There’s no one speaking only the howling” Ron said slowly.
Draco ignored the comment. ‘Faggot! Pussy! Homo!’ All words that followed him as he walked down the corridors of Park Vale Comprehensive school. Draco picked up the worn copy of Macbeth, a second hand copy he’d gotten from the second-hand book sale the school ran over the summer. “What had he done, to make him fly the land?” Draco said reading Lady MacDuff’s line, doing his best to make it sound as dull and detached as possible so he wouldn’t be asked to do it again.
"Yes, that's the case" Draco confirmed. "Traditional birth if possible."
“Oh Merlin, here we go,” Ginny sighed rolling her eyes.
Harry grumbled. "He should be here. I need him..."
“Yes, I have four children of undetermined gender. I’m open to options and I trust your taste.”
"His Aunt and Uncle, two of the most horrible muggles I have had the acquaintance of loathing" Sirius said coldly. "The fact Harry turned up at Hogwarts in one piece and not an emotional wreck is something that confounds me to this day."
"They were good people?" She asked honestly, they were in first year when she was graduating and not even the same house.
There was no answer, just silence.
“Right, how do we start this?” Harry asked, looking at Draco.
“Oh, trust me. I am pregnant,” Draco answered.
Harry nodded, “easier to cope with. Plus, Draco works nights. So, it works out” Harry said with a gentle smile.
“Do you two need a room?” Ron grimaced, turning away and shuddering.
“I told you to call me Draco”
"He is" Harry agreed overwhelmed and grateful.
"Really" Draco nodded smiling, trying not to cry as Molly cradled the new-born against her chest. He went upstairs into Harry's bedroom, promising himself he wouldn't faint again. He pressed open the door and saw Harry laying in the bed. "Hello"
Hermione frowned. “Oh. Har...That boy wants to speak to you” Hermione said quickly nudging Draco. “I’m Hermione Granger by the way.”
“Oh, so it’s bad then. Great...” Scorpius commented, opening his book.
Ron growled and swiped at him jabbing the Candelabra at him who seemed unmoved. The Reverend smiled darkly and grabbed Ron lifting him up by his front and throwing him across the room. Before continuing up the stairs.
“I co-own a bar. But yes, the perks of having a best friend who is a bartender” Harry corrected.
Draco began to massage Harry’s swollen feet and ankles and he wasn’t complaining. Harry rubbed his belly slowly, it was becoming more dominant by the week the heavy curve that protruded low from his crotch. “We need to consider names?”
“I’m Otto and this is Harry” Otto introduced shaking his hand.
“Okay, well, if you're sure,” said Harry, warmly. He glanced down at Draco’s belly. “If you feel any twinges...”
“Getting some water,” Scorpius commented. “So, being pregnant? This is going to sound dumb but... is it hard?”
“Subtle” Hermione commented looking down at her feet and concerned that while harmless still worried her skirt would catch fire.
“Not this again” Draco rolled his eyes. “Hermione asked me about magic...are you lot some insane mental institution escapees?” Draco accused, his hand tightening around Harry.
"No!" Harry insisted. "We want a surprise."
“You took your time? There was no way there was that much of a queue for the boy’s toilets” Hermione said suspiciously.
“That’s right” Draco grinned as he kissed Harry, pushing him onto the bed. “And you are mine” Draco growled bit his lip and began kissing Harry deeply.
“It’s exactly what they’re saying,” Draco harrumphed. As he heaved himself up. “Get used to the couch.”
“You’re definitely dead. I’ll remember you fondly, Dad,” said Caelum, grinning.
Draco shook his head, “Potter. Don’t speak in riddles.”
“You caved,” Lily grinned.
"Harry!" Hermione gasped.
“And you are?” Reverend Trask snarled, clearly not appreciative that someone more pompous than him took the wind out of his sails.
“Yes, our family originally emigrated from France, but this family line has long died out. The Chateau has always been in our family.”
"Blimey. Mate you’re having a kid. Just the one yeah?" Ron confirmed.
“Weasley a vampire. I know he’s pale but honestly” Draco said almost doubling over with laughter,
Draco snarled at him, planting his feet firmly.
"You can have mothers’ room" Sirius said pulling his wand from his jacket and waving it at her luggage. "Can I get you a coffee or tea?"
There was a loud thump, and Harry looked over and saw Draco, Passed out on the floor. Narcissa sighed and stood up, "I'll take him downstairs. He'll be fine"
“It’s just the usual. Bullies and assholes” Draco muttered. “It’s only another year and then I’m done. I never have to see any of those tossers again.”
“You haven’t wet the bed because you're too heavy to lever yourself out in time,” Draco commented flatly.
Harry groaned self pityingly. As he pushed hard.
“He left me for Cleo. He can stare all he wants” Harry muttered as they joined all the other students who were heading out of the canteen at Comstock Grammar School. “What do we have this afternoon?”
"Not this again" Harry sighed.
"Yes. Just the one" Draco insisted as he handed Ron a plate, who looked down at it incredulously. "It's not poisoned. Harry wouldn't be pleased if I murdered his best friend."
Ron smirked and offered Draco another beer. "Nah you're not a total disappointment" Ron grinned. Draco smiled cordially.
"I'm a good fuck. And Potter couldn't do any better" Draco replied without missing a beat. Harry shot him a look, and Draco grinned back in amusement. "We've been keeping it quiet..."
Harry winced; he knew Draco's ‘work’ voice instantly. He put on this gentle calm lilt, reassuring and free of judgement. “I’m fine” Harry lied instinctively.
“You can’t use that as an excuse for everything,” Scorpius complained, out of breath as he grabbed another box.
"Is that?" Draco asked eyes wide in surprise.
"Don't worry. My opinion hasn't changed about you either" Draco reassured with a cocky smile.
“Harry?” Draco said gently.
“Four. You know what that means?”
“Are you really pregnant?” asked Albus, confused.
Harry nodded and pressed into Draco’s fur, comforted by the steady beat of his heart.
Harry nodded and hugged him tightly. "Come on..." Harry said hugging him tightly as they walked to the door.
“You have ruined me!” Draco muttered glaring at his belly. He sat in Pyjamas the duvet sitting at his waist. "You've made me fat! And Swollen! And Huge! Frankly, I don't know what I'm getting out of this."
“Harry you two hate each other” Hermione said honestly.
“I have a gift of salvation, that will bring your friend to God” The Reverend grinned holding out a small vial of purple liquid through the iron fence. Ron pocketed it.
The nursery was already finished. Draco had it knocked up in an afternoon. He was already stocking up on nappies and baby clothes. Frankly Harry felt like he wasn't doing enough, so he'd started seeking out a midwife. It was harder than he'd admitted to Draco, most were completely uninterested or calling Harry a freak.
Hermione chuckled. “They are pretty easy, Harry.”
“No, put it in my room. I’ll put them up in the wardrobe. Your Dad might still fit in them,” Draco commented. “His taste hasn’t improved since.”
“Yes, I did. When you two boys start having children you will understand. There are so many things I didn’t get to see.” Draco smiled and cupped their cheeks. “Alright, let’s get this finished before your Dad gets home.”
Sirius stares stunned. "Really?" He said genuinely touched.
"I'll take you home. But you'll have to stay there. I have to write the conference up..." Draco insisted.
Harry admittedly felt very sick at that point and had to look away. However, one by one, four infants were removed from Draco’s womb. Harry hadn’t looked how it had been done, as he was rather aware he might have fainted.
"Oh, Merlin. It's freezing" Ron said as he poked his head out of the flaps from the covered wagon. "Who in their right mind exiles themselves somewhere this bloody cold!" Ron said shivering.
Lily groaned from embarrassment as she sat down next to him. “So, have you picked out names?”
Sirius chose two of the most outlandish mugs, one a multi-coloured pattern with the letter S on it and a second with the letter H. He placed them down and handed it to Narcissa, the handle of the tea strainer sticking out. "Here you go" Sirius offered politely.
“I would know” Draco frowned.
“No thanks. I’m good” Draco dismissed.
“Really?” Harry raised an eyebrow. “I wanted to name the Baby after my parents. Depending on their gender.”
Narcissa stared in surprise. "Draco, Be serious."
“I have been trying to ask you on a date” Harry said with gritted teeth.
There was a knock on the telephone glass and Draco looked and a tall man with oily black hair was stood there.
"Harry" Draco said firmly. "You know the crying thing doesn't work on me." Looking around and seeing that there was crowd staring and clearly enjoying seeing this domestic play out.
“Pft,” Draco rolled his eyes. “His taste is dubious.”
Harry ignored him as Ron finished off his beer. “He’s understanding. Give me a yell if anyone wants a beer” Harry commented, as he waddled out from behind the bar. He walked out the front the suburban pub built over a hundred and fifty years ago. Renamed the Stag, Wolf and Dog, just Across the road was a Potion maker, and a grocer. Nestled in a quiet backstreet in the middle of Middleborough a few miles outside of bath. Tonight, there was noise and revelry the beer garden had a good crowd and the bar had been packed before wandered off to see the fireworks and the Bonfire in the centre of town. Harry shivered, Harry pickup up the empty glasses from the tables, weaving through the groups who were drinking and smoking out front. He ended up with a tall stack of glasses as he headed back inside. Putting them over on the sink, knowing the cleaning charm would get to them.
“Ron? Wasn’t it?” Harry said confused.
"Dinners ready Weasel and Weasel's know it all wife" Draco called out loudly and unhelpfully from the kitchen.
