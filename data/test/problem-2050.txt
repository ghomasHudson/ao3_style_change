Malfoy’s eyes meet Harry’s. He looks genuinely bereft. Far more stricken than he had when news of his father’s death had reached him the previous morning.
“Are you on holiday already?” he asks, as the boy tears off back down the hall calling for his grandmother.
Harry thinks about pointing out that wizards had a similar concept until Gringotts installed Polyjuice-detection wards after their visit during the War, but decides against it.
Harry tears into the envelope. It might not be addressed to him, but whoever the hell is playing this stupid game can get stuffed if they’re expecting privacy as far as he’s concerned.
Casper, at least, is glad to have him back home at Grimmauld Place. Her purring is almost an adequate substitute for falling asleep listening to someone in the next bed.
Harry tugs the envelope open before he can think further about it. He knows Malfoy’s father served a decade in Azkaban before being released. He’s got no idea what Malfoy’s been doing for a job. He sees him, occasionally. Leaving Gringotts with an armload of folders and a worried expression on his face. Buying tedious looking books at Flourish & Blotts. But Harry’s hardly going to make conversation in the street. They had nothing in common before Malfoy threw his lot in with the genocidal maniacs when they were children, it’s not like they have anything in common a decade later. Well, not anything they make conversation about, in any event.
Harry follows him back to his office, and does a double-take when he reaches the threshold. Thick dark curtains hang at the sides of the window, now looking out on a dark, snowy vista. Two additional lamps have joined the one on the desk, casting warm and inviting light. A painting of Hogwarts is hung on one wall, showing the castle bathed in summer sun, the Giant Squid lazily breaking water in the foreground.
Potter starts to look worried, picking at the label on his beer bottle.  “I read your monograph on the characteristics of nightmare subjects and post-traumatic stress, I thought …”
“No, no, no Master Potter, Holber takes up the tray,” he says, rapping Harry rather sharply on the hand as he tries to pour out a second coffee. “You may bring your own cup, if you wish.” Holber’s tone implies that this is a singular honour and Harry tries to arrange his features into a look of suitable solemnity and gratitude as he follows the elf up the stairs.
mean that. I’ve wanted that since you came to teach at Hogwarts,” Potter insists, right there at his ear, his breath warm against Draco’s neck. He shudders.
“You can’t be serious.” Harry slumps in his seat, the uncomfortable wooden back of the chair digging into his spine.
Ordinarily, Harry would be annoyed to find Hermione so predictably stuck on the point she’s been trying to make all weekend, but given the circumstances, he can’t really fault her.
Harry can’t really answer that. Being in this house is so surreal that it seems to have tipped over into not really that upsetting. It’s macabre, certainly, but he’s not haunted by flashbacks or anything. He’s surprised by the strength of Neville’s reaction though he supposes everyone carries their memories of the war in different ways.
His eyes are rimmed red and he’s staring at Harry like he wants to believe what he’s saying but just can’t. Harry very much wants to push his hair back off his forehead and kiss it, just to prove to himself that Draco’s really here: vibrant and upset and definitely not dying on a bathroom floor.
That hurts for two reasons. First, because Harry knows that it’s true. This thing with Draco began, for him, on pure and unexamined impulse. Draco was just — there. Someone to share a bed with after an irritating day on the job. A convenient and mildly amusing choice. A
The big double doors to the library stand open, and the space inside is quiet. The noise of their boots on the stone floors is suddenly silenced by the thick carpeting underfoot. Harry takes a deep breath, inhaling the familiar smell of old parchment and leather, transporting him back to hours spent here studying. Trying to find answers. Trying to understand.
It feels so much lighter, like a dark storm has passed over and left a bright summer afternoon in its wake. All around him, his friends and family are gasping and hugging one another and looking horrified and confused. Harry feels like steel bands have been loosened from around his chest.
At the end of the evening, the staff wait with lanterns to walk everyone back to the path to the edge of the property. Draco has always told them there are cars stationed at a nearby road for his guests, and that he likes the mystery and the
“Brilliant, Hermione, what was that?” he asks, bent double, panting and exhausted but flooded with relief.
“I’ll say. Muggles go absolutely insane about his food. His restaurants are booked out a full year in advance. He barely even bloody cooks any more. Has a telly show.”
Harry has a renewed sense of purpose the following day. Sitting at the pub with Ron and Hermione the night before had felt a lot like their school days, with Hermione’s to-do list for Harry taking on truly frightening proportions that he and Ron were all too familiar with from the O.W.L. preparation schedules she used to make. They used to largely ignore those, but this time around, Harry’s grateful for the guidance.
“Well, this magic is prohibited. Highly illegal. For obvious reasons. Mass memory modification is bad enough, but the suggestibility component makes this a capital offence. And it’s very old. I’ve been studying and practicing wizarding law for a decade now. Nothing like this has been attempted in hundreds of years.”
Harry finds himself distracted by the pale arch of Malfoy’s foot and shakes his head to clear it. He looks up to find Malfoy’s pulled off his jeans, but seems to be wavering before going any further. Harry thinks back to the lake. He assumed then that Malfoy kept his top on against the cold, but —
When he comes down off the stage he catches sight of Malfoy leaning against the bar. His pale blue Arrows’ sweater looks impossibly soft and clashes outrageously with the inches of dark ink on display over his muscled forearms where he’s pushed up the sleeves. Harry’s tempted to say to the reporters,
Harry’s waiting for there to be some nasty follow up comment, dismissive of Muggles and their whole Christmas tradition, but Malfoy just looks thoughtful.
It’s an ugly thought — prioritising where their Healer should be. Harry thinks again about the teaspoon in Hermione’s pocket and feels a fresh wave of irritation. He shoves his chair back with a scrape and goes to recheck his pack.
But he’d started to feel like all these different pieces of a puzzle were gradually coming together, and there was a giant space where Draco should be. He wanted to ask Draco about house magic for the new school and have him explain, using far too much Latin and words Harry only understood about a third of, so that he could watch Draco gesture with his hands the way he did when he was animated about something. He wanted to talk to Draco about his work with McGonagall. He wanted to ask him whether buying Teddy Quidditch season tickets was too generous for a ten-year-old. He wanted to make him this chicken pot pie that he’d been practising that he knew Draco would describe as
Harry doesn’t talk much about the renovations at Grimmauld Place, but Draco knows he’s spending far less time wandering around annoying Jack with questions about beading, and far more time annoying Draco by just being underfoot, so it must be nearly complete.
I can complete my anchoring part of the ritual and also the Gryffindor part,” she pleads with Harry. “But without Hannah standing for Hufflepuff, we can’t do it at all. We need you both.”
Harry left it to the adults to sort out while he led another round of skirmishes in Yorkshire, helping a small group of Squibs to safety, and returned to the middle of a blazing row about whether or not the only effective way to be sure that a Malfoy was truly a turncoat would involve a lot of
“Not identical,” Malfoy warns. “And certainly Belle’s case is much more severe. But, here, look.”  He opens the file in front of him and extracts a sheet of parchment. It’s covered in diagnostic results. Coloured lines and graphs. It looks like ancient runes to Harry and half as clear.
She doesn’t wait for either of them, spinning on her heel and striding off down the corridor. Harry looks at Malfoy, who just seems tired all of a sudden. Deflated. Like he’s disappointed a parent or favourite teacher, and not just the incredibly vicious former schoolmate who pays their wages.
Maybe he’ll even volunteer to get her her Harrods turkeys. Harry thinks about the claustrophobic press of Muggle crowds on an ordinary shopping day and tries to imagine what it would be like at the end of December.
“We want to show you all around the buildings and the grounds now. Our teachers are here to answer any questions you might have. And then we’d love for you to join us in the staff room for tea and cakes.”
“Caspian’s mother negotiated a minor victory, however. Once the entail is fulfilled and the heir married, he becomes the rightful owner of the estate immediately. Caspian married the daughter of a pure-blood scion, and his father could only live on at the Manor at his pleasure, rather than the other way around.”
“Dinner’s through here, apparently,” Neville points, and Harry joins him. The doors in front of them open onto yet another dining room, but this one is much smaller than the others they’ve been in over the weekend, with a family-sized table set for only five.
“I’m just tired of people suggesting I’d be better off somehow if I was cured,” he grumps, though to be fair only Draco has even hinted at that. What Harry actually means is that he doesn’t want to think about showing Draco Malfoy just how constrained he is. The idea of being that vulnerable in front of him is impossible to contemplate. “There’s nothing wrong with me.”
Draco steels himself for a confrontation, but Potter just slings an arm around Draco’s shoulder and smiles for the photo. It bursts something wide open in his chest, the idea that Harry Potter would be happy to be captured this way. Here.
“Or simply because this is his Great Aunt’s house, and he’s probably been here before as a child,” Harry counters, because he much prefers that explanation.
him here,” Carl murmurs, disagreeing as if Robert’s said it out loud. He takes a deep breath and stumbles slightly as he shoves the foliage out of the way and follows Pete into the tunnel.
“I won’t tell if you won’t,” Ron grins, touching the correct door with his finger and casting a barely audible wandless Alohomora.
Draco just shrugs. “So we even the score.” He draws his wand and proceeds to cast a bunch of incomprehensible spells at his broom, and then attempts a pattern. His movements are excruciatingly clumsy and slow, and he pulls a face. “That ought to do it, no?”
“You mean you’re sorry for detaining me and then forgetting about it completely, demonstrating once and for all how little regard you have for me?” His voice is chillier than the icy breeze whipping around the stone edges of the building.
. He lets out a humourless laugh and slides them into his satchel. He makes a quick detour to Diagon to pick up the book he’s had Flourish & Blotts order in for him; an academic thesis on Voldemort’s return, with several chapters on the deaths of Lily and James Potter and the competing magical theories about what might have occurred that fateful night.
Harry sighs again. He’s right. Luna would have said yes because she loves an adventure. But Neville and Hannah have plans for their future that they wouldn’t have risked. It makes him ache with worry all over again.
He picks up Balham’s message again, and scratches out a curt response agreeing to meet after training on Friday. He fetches his playbook and decides to go study it in Luna’s rooms. She might be able to give him something for his hip before it starts to lock up completely. Besides, she has an armchair upholstered in a bright yellow velvet that matches nothing else in the entire building, but remains the most comfortable piece of furniture he’s ever sat on. He likes to have the coffee ready before she and Neville arrive. Luna will always take a cup gratefully and begin talking to Harry as if she’s halfway through a conversation, chattering on about something they’ve literally never discussed before: the benefits of starflower in potions for muscle cramps, whether the Cannon’s Seeker is actually having an affair with that singer whose name Harry can never remember, how she’s considering repainting the changing rooms a sage green to improve player concentration.
Granger and Lovegood have their patient propped up on a raft of pillows and are buttoning him into a clean pyjama jacket. Potter looks terrible — twitching and sallow.
“Can I Side-Along you?” Harry asks. Draco’s not sure what to do with this tentative, polite version of Harry Potter. He’s far more used to the one who pushes him against the wall of a pub and spins them straight back to his bedroom without asking.
when he left Britain. Eighteen years old and the worst kind of gathering storm of messed-up kid and traumatised war vet. He held it together through the funerals. Through that long ugly summer at the Burrow as Molly wept, Ginny drifted away from him, and Ron and Hermione wrapped themselves up in each other. He stomached the cloying adulation every time he went out in public and the invasive stories about his life all over the press. He thought that if he just kept putting one foot in front of the other, it would be fine. He would start Auror training, move out of the house that had once felt like a sanctuary and now felt like a mausoleum, and get on with his life. He kept repeating it to himself like a mantra.
Harry glances at Ron, who is trying to school his face into a neutral expression, and Harry knows for certain without even asking that not one of them is showing a rune. It’s a crushing feeling that leaves him short of breath. To have spent so much time over the last few weeks with these people, day in and day out, thinking he was doing the right thing and have it turn out to have all been manipulated. Nothing but lies.
Malfoy mutters something to himself, and writes yet more notes. Then he starts to cast again. First, a standard set of diagnostics that Harry recognises from the field, and then an increasingly complicated array of spells that send threads of magic out to encircle the calendar and reach every corner of the room.
Potter takes another slug of his drink. “I thought you were just doing all this to be the centre of attention again. Surround yourself with the rich and famous, have everyone talking about you in the paper.”
Malfoy is sitting on a bed, stacking text books neatly into a pile. If he notices Harry, he doesn’t acknowledge it.
a quill and parchment and pens an RSVP, tying it to Lancelot’s leg before he can think about it too carefully.
Harry bristles and starts to respond, but Hermione catches his arm and nods at Malfoy. “Luna said she could detect the smell of poppies and cravenleaf, which gives us something to work with. But the hallucinogen might have lasting or recurring effects. It’s hard to know how much we inhaled.”
“Run it again,” Harry insists. And so Neville does, pointing out the results and explaining what each of the symbols mean.
Harry jerks awake. His neck sends shooting pains of protest where he’s managed to sort of fold himself in half in a hard plastic waiting room chair.
“Do you know where that is?” Belle asks, and he’s grateful for the change of subject. Harry follows her gesture to stare at the window. The snow has melted away a little, and a cold wintery sun is showing through tall evergreens.
“Auror Harry Potter, accompanying Miss Rose Granger-Weasley to see her mother, Auror Hermione Granger.”
,” Draco retorts reflexively, trying not to get distracted by Harry’s stag tattoo having pranced across his back as he heads into the bathroom. With any luck, by the time he gets out, Harry will be dressed and gone.
The lopsided half-dead Christmas tree by the Healer’s station looks like it’s most in need of Neville’s help. Perhaps if they wrap it in some of the fresh greenery he’s brought with him it won’t look quite so sad. The Wheezes decorations hung across its spindly branches are currently singing an up-tempo version of
Gradually Draco gets used to the idea that his sanctuary seems to have been permanently invaded by this bizarre alternate universe Handyman Potter, who crunches around the gravel paths peppering Jack with questions. He wears worn-looking clothes, but a new pair of workboots, and has started keeping his too-long hair out of his face with a baseball cap.
He figures it’s probably good to draw some boundaries, though. He can’t be available literally every time Harry suggests a shag. Even if all he wants, after the week he’s had, is the palm of Harry’s hand against his back, pressing him down. Draco’s feeling pretty pleased with himself and his own personal restraint when someone drags the chair out next to him and sits down.
Ginny arrives, ignoring the breakfast spread altogether, and slumps into the chair between Neville and Harry. She has dark shadows under her eyes, and shivers a little even though she’s wearing a thick roll-neck sweater. Harry isn’t surprised. The whole room seems cold, even with bright sunshine spilling in through the French doors.
Something about hearing about ice-skating causes a little click of recognition in the back of Harry’s mind. He thanks her profusely and gathers his cast-off Christmas clothes into a bag as proof. Of what, exactly, he’s not sure.
“We did it,” Harry says, leaning a little closer to press his arm against Draco’s, feeling the warmth of him through their shirtsleeves.
Theo’s the first to scarper, disappearing through the Floo almost as soon as Hermione wraps things up. Harry quirks an eyebrow at her and receives a very clear
Harry feels the circle of their spells start to bend, as if the ritual is starting to tip over. As if all of the energy in the magic is being drawn from …
Hermione looks even more tired than the rest of them, but she seems unsurprised by his question. She pulls her hair back from her face and refastens the elastic. “We can’t eliminate the risk completely,” she says honestly. “Our magic is underpowered in here as it is.”
“Oh captain, my captain,” he murmurs against Draco’s lips as he casts rapidly to regain his balance before they both fall out of the air, snatching the Snitch from Draco’s pleased grasp and setting it free.
“Anything else you want to tell me then, so that I don’t have to find it out from our venomous former schoolmates?”
Harry stands up slowly, raising his palms. “Only making sure medical attention wouldn’t help”. He doesn’t say,
“As Blaise correctly notes, it’s an old favourite in pure-blood families when you’re trying to catch someone ‘red handed’,” Draco explains, pocketing his wand and shifting his attention to the assembled company. Sure enough, the Slytherins who have recognised the spell are turning their palms over and examining them closely. “When you cast it on a physical object, or on a room, the caster gets an alert when the object is touched or the room is entered. And the person responsible finds a red mark on their hands.”
Harry finally gets free of the crowd and catches up to Draco just as he’s about to leave the party altogether.
,” she replies, and Harry hears the echo of his own thoughts moments ago. “As if this ghastly house itself isn’t enough. Every extra minute we have to be here is too much.”
“Well, I’m done,” he says, closing his computer. “Come on, slug. We’ll meet Beely at my flat and give her the guestlist and then I’ll shout you dinner at that Iranian place you like. I was supposed to go with Pansy but she’s been sick with the flu all week.”
“Why dinner parties?” he asks. His voice, after so long, is a surprise. Pitched lower than Draco was expecting. More grown up.
It’s a straightforward enough explanation, but Harry still can’t help thinking it’s an extremely convenient outcome for Malfoy. His dreadful father off the scene, his mother no longer at risk of homelessness and destitution. His own future, protected. And now he doesn’t even have to go through with a sham wedding.
“Sort this out,” she snaps. “At once. Or I’m calling time and locking the doors. I don’t need this shit.”
Neville gives Harry a strange look, but agrees quickly, and the pair of them spend a long hour opening all of the players lockers and checking all of the equipment. Neville teaches Harry the diagnostic spells, and they cast them over and over until even Harry’s wand hand is tired.
"You're more alike than maybe you realise." Luna smiles sadly at him. “In any event, let’s have dessert, shall we?”
“It was my godfather’s,” Harry says, his temples throbbing in confusion. “But I … didn’t want it. I got rid of it after the War. I …”
him or anything so Draco suggests that he shouts him dinner at the Leaky on his way home. They argue about Quidditch and the candidates for the Wizengamot election and it’s just
Ron shrugs, and reaches forward with a knife. “S’okay, mate. Just don’t do it on Christmas Day. Now for the important part, the taste test!”
Harry’s already shaking his head, staggered by the strength of his own reaction. “No, that’s not good enough.”
“What are you going to do when she realises you prefer shagging blokes, then?” he spits out. “Or are you deluding yourself into thinking you’ll be able to pretend that’s not true for the rest of your life?”
Breakfast is the one meal Harry still lets Kreacher make him. They’ve argued repeatedly over the years, but Harry can tell the elf doesn’t have full service in him anymore, and Harry’s erratic work hours mean he’s far more likely to be dropping bits of kebab all over Hermione on a stakeout—and hearing about it—than he is to be sitting down to a beef Wellington at his dining table. Besides, as time goes by, even breakfast can be a little … unpredictable.
He Floos straight to the shop, startling George who is wanding huge cardboard boxes into a towering stack in the back room.
“Your chances are one in five that it contains a chilli so hot you’ll want to hex your own tongue out.”
“Thank you for joining us this weekend, Luna and I are very glad you could all make it. We’ve invited you all here to celebrate some wonderful news with us.”
They have to push through a much bigger crowd than normal to reach the right staircase. Jim Cranswick tips his flat cap at Harry from his usual spot by the bar.
“Miss Weasley?” Cassie asks, when Ginny still hasn’t moved her hands. “Could you show us your palms, please?”
“Who?” Harry answers absently as he lays the table. But when he looks up again, Ron is shaking his head and shrugging as if he’s forgotten the rest of his question.
Ron gets up, his full height suddenly looming large under the low-beamed kitchen ceiling. “You know what, I think that’s enough,” he says, his voice low and serious. “We didn’t come here to get shouted at.”
His wrist feels like it’s on fire. Nausea passes over in a wave and he rolls to the side of the bed to throw up, gasping and retching. It’s impossible to get a lung full of air, and it’s very noisy. He needs quiet. He needs ….
Malfoy seems to gather himself, and gets up and leaves without further explanation. Harry tries to fight down an urge to go after him. To what— comfort him?! Malfoy would punch him clean in the face if he so much as suggested it. And yet Harry needs to make sure he’s okay. He pushes back from the table and walks quickly from the room, before anyone can ask him what the hell he thinks he’s doing. A question he certainly can’t answer.
They make short work of the roofing tiles and Hermione readily agrees to hot toddies afterwards. They cup the warm mugs in front of the fireplace.
He finds Harry in the kitchen having just finished lunch. Teddy’s at school, and Andromeda is at St Mungo’s volunteering in the Janus Thickey Ward.
Harry glances around desperately for the source of the threat. The noise is deafening. He throws up a security shield and moves forward carefully, watching as the ammunition bounces violently off his magic, ricocheting in all directions.
“I mean, if you ever go to work,” he laughs, nudging Draco with an elbow. “You’re just dragging your heels, I reckon. Trying to get me to stick around a little longer.”
“You could have gone home any time,” he says carefully, over the sound of blood rushing in his ears. He doesn’t say:
Neville seems to catch himself and looks at Harry with concern. “Wait, you don’t think that has anything to do with Malfoy’s dad, do you? Was he poisoned?”
“What do we do?” Granger asks, and it’s the first time she’s addressed him with anything other than thinly concealed disdain. She’s afraid, he realises.
Flooing to the Broomsticks is deemed far too conspicuous for a group supposed to be doing something covertly. Even ten years on, anytime Harry, Ron, and Hermione are together in public there’s always someone paying too much attention, and then inevitably a nonsense follow-up story in the
Draco coughs until he retches bile into a bowl Lovegood conjures from somewhere and holds under his chin. His head is pounding and his neck aches. It isn’t a good sign.
“D’you think she knows the right words to any of them?” Harry’s not really asking anyone in particular, but Malfoy’s the only one there.
“I’ve done everything I can to keep you at arms’ length. And you just crash about the place, barrelling into my office, bringing me my favourite pastries and telling me I’m
Draco shrugs, “Not everyone learns the same way.” He proceeds to ignore Harry then, moving away across the pitch to uncharm the grass and stow the training obstacles beside the boundary.
Sure enough, Ron is limping in to the room a little cautiously, but looking well-rested and not at all like he’s suffered from any particular lack of things to eat over the last few days. Hermione immediately bursts into tears, dashing across and launching herself at him, and he scoops her up into a kiss.
Harry launches himself at Draco, pressing him back against the wall and kissing his startled face. Draco laughs, wrapping his arms tightly around Harry and pulling him close.
“It’s a limit on inheritance,” she says with a resigned sigh, clutching a little old book to her chest as they walk together back to the Blue Room. “Things like, a house only being able to be passed to a member of the family line, or the eldest son, or so on.”
Harry does as she suggests, and takes a moment to send a Patronus to Padma letting her know that the Auror security team can return. Then he heads out into the lobby. The heels of his boots click loudly on the marble floor. Harry glances around until he sees Malfoy, sitting on a padded bench near the reception desk.
“I wanted one more guest to join us,” he says, looking over his shoulder, as Draco comes out of the house. The guests gasp, and Harry sort of wants to as well, but for a completely different reason. Draco’s midnight blue shirt shows off his pale skin to best advantage, and it’s open at the neck giving Harry too many reasons to concentrate on his collarbones. Draco keeps his eyes on Harry, giving him a small smile of encouragement, and Harry feels steeled by the bravery it's taken for him to step out here in front of a group of people who think they hate him and want him imprisoned, or worse. He turns back to the crowd.
“If you’re going back full-time,” Nigel warns, “you’re going to have to sort out this mess with Draco.”
Harry is struck by the strength of her reaction. “We’re not really stuck,” he points out. “Ron’s just ticking some boxes and then we’ll be able to go home.”
Harry shudders at the thought. He just wants an update. She’s off tracking Marsden, and Harry’s stuck with his annual Solstice visit to the War Orphanage. He likes visiting the kids there, ordinarily. But today he just wants to be out in the field where he belongs.
There’s a silence. Draco wishes he could see their facial expressions, but if he goes down now they’ll obviously stop talking about him.
Harry grimaces. He’d truly just forgotten to let Malfoy know. Malfoy peers in at the little doors of the calendar.
“I’d offer to come and look at your house, but he’d….” she trails off, leaving Harry to imagine just how badly Malfoy would take that.
“Well, even a ten year old managed to work that out,” Harry says with a shrug. “I didn’t need a Curse Breaker to tell me I needed to do the tasks.” He did, of course, need a ten year old, but he doesn’t need to tell Malfoy that.
“Well, you have to agree it’s suspicious,” he insists, mopping at it with a paper napkin. “Malfoy’s suddenly back and creeping around and at the same time someone is sneaking into my house and…”
“That’s right. Once the castle was built, the four founders gathered in a room to imbue Hogwarts with its magic, so that it would live on longer than they would, protecting generations of students to come. We want to complete our ritual in that same room.”
“Look,” Hermione tries to reason with them again, “it’s terrible what’s happened to Neville, and he should get the care he needs right away. But there’s no reason for the rest of us to stop now when we’re
“It’s a dangerous job,” Granger tugs at her sleeve. She sounds defensive. “And Harry always puts himself between danger and anyone else.”
“I really am sorry, Harry,” Hermione says. “I’m going to share all my memory charm research with Luna and the team. Maybe there’s a way.”
Sato levitates the artefact they were working on—a small statue of a wolf—and says quietly, “I’ll take this to the Ministry.”
“He’s a good person, Harry,” Luna insists. “You should spend a little more time getting to know him, and a little less time…” she trails off. Harry feels his face heat. "I know you didn't get along when you were younger, but, honestly, did you ever know Draco to be capable of killing someone?"
“But it’s not really that, is it?” Potter’s eyebrows are drawn together over his bright green eyes. Studying him carefully. Seeing far too much. Draco desperately wants to take those crooked, childish glasses off his nose so he can’t. “You’re just doing what you’re good at. Hosting, socialising, whatever. You’re trying to do something significant with the skills you have.”
“They were … before we … before he ….” Potter’s struggling with the words, his eyebrows drawn together in concentration. There’s a tic in his jaw, and his hand is flexing and clenching into a fist in his lap. He’s still not looking at Draco.
A brief war of expressions breaks out across Potter’s face. Draco can’t decide if he’s about to be petty or grateful, and he suspects Potter can’t decide either. In the end, he says nothing. Draco smiles again, and Potter looks away, still clearly uncomfortable.
The path they follow is crowded with trees and bushes, completely overgrown. Ron leads, taking out his continued frustration at the whole Malfoy situation on errant branches with snappish wand movements.
“I hate this house, you know,” says Draco, his head still resting on Harry’s shoulder so that he mumbles the words into his neck. “I’ve only been staying here for my mother. I’ve told her so many times that she’d be happier somewhere else, somewhere closer to London. It was never really the Manor itself that she needed, it was the security of the estate. Perhaps now…”
Hermione turns to Malfoy and explains why she’s there. That they’d like permission to look around the Manor, but that he doesn’t have to grant it. That if he doesn’t, she may be forced to get a warrant and come back. She’s brisk and professional, and completely ignores Harry throughout. Gibbens has managed to close his mouth but keeps stealing wide-eyed glances at Harry who has to suppress a childish urge to stick his tongue out at the young man.
It’s maybe-Tom’s turn to look confused. “But you always get both?” And now Harry’s sure he has him mistaken for some other regular, because Harry doesn’t like egg sandwiches and Ron certainly doesn’t and Harry’s never had a regular order for two sandwiches in his life.
Harry’s relieved to hear her say it. The idea that she’d become a completely unrecognisable person was too hard for him to comprehend.
Some people change, Harry thinks. But not the sort of people who were happy to follow Voldemort twice. Not people like the Malfoys.
It’s exactly the sort of insult Draco would have flung at him when they were young, aimed to rile Harry up. And he would have succeeded back then. But right now the way he’s grinning at Harry — eyes twinkling, clearly teasing —  just makes Harry blush.
“Would you come back here, this evening? I mean, for a nightcap or...whatever. We can eat leftovers and watch some dreadful Christmas movie on the telly.”
Lucius Malfoy is undeterred. “You coddled children deserve to hear the truth.” He half-shouts this, staring wildly around the room. “It’s not like my
“Time,” Luna shrugs. “It’s not good to stay in that sort of stasis for so long, and without knowing exactly what she’s been exposed to, poor Draco is working against the clock.”
The well-worn furniture and familiar surroundings should be comforting, but the empty portraits are creeping him out.
“You told us you only wake because he casts you out,” Granger interjects, annoyingly, from her perch by the window.
It’s definitely his jacket, but he has no idea what the card is or who might have put it there. Hermione looks at him curiously, but there doesn’t seem any point in discussing it with her further. She’s made her views clear. He’ll go to the address himself and see what he can find.
“That you’ve found yourself the least suitable boyfriend in the wizarding world?” Hermione asks with a smile that clearly signals she’s teasing.
Draco’s mouth falls open. He’s so confused. He can’t understand why Potter’s even speaking to him, let alone confessing plans to abandon his home. “New York,” he manages, his voice sounding strained. “We went to New York the summer of fourth year.”
He must have missed the decisions they made about this as a team. It’s true he’s been working extremely hard, balancing his caseload and his campaigning, and probably Parvati or one of the younger interns has just gotten a little overzealous with the tone.
Both Harry and Draco are almost at a loss for words in the changing room, clapping the players on their backs proudly.
In theory, seven professional Quidditch players ought to be able to absolutely destroy three unsigned, unsanctioned rogues, but Draco’s friends leave the Arrows in their wake on the very first play.
“Our paths cross,” Parkinson drawls, one of her dark eyebrows arched, as if she finds everything about the three of them terribly amusing. Harry can’t believe he’s subjecting himself to this. He takes a big swig of his drink and hopes Parkinson hasn’t laced it with anything.
Harry thinks about joining them aloft again, but as he sees the team begin to practice unholstering their wands in flight the idea sours in his mouth.
Harry shakes his head. “No, that’s her Brownies troop. They’re all Muggle-born kids who are getting ready for Hogwarts.”
He unwards the door to Grimmauld Place and takes the steps two at a time, feeling invigorated. He may not have a husband, kids, or a warm and welcoming family home. But he has money, a decrepit house-elf on the verge of retirement who is an
At the very end of a row of houses, Harry stops. Draco can feel the slippery magic that disguises the Potter house from Muggles ease over him like a veil as he steps closer. Harry opens his mouth as if he’s about to say something but then just closes it and swallows hard. Draco looks at the ruined cottage and the overrun front garden. He tries to imagine what it must have looked like when it was whole. Harry’s not even concentrating on the house, though, he realises. He’s transfixed instead by the sign that has risen out of the ground in front of them. Draco can see it was once a small memorial notice, but over time it’s been magically expanded. People have nailed on extra planks of wood, attached banners, pinned impervious parchment. The whole thing is now a few yards across and it’s absolutely crammed, every available inch covered in Everlasting Ink, carvings, drawings, spelled flowers. Messages of support, and grief, and thanks. A heartbreaking expression of love for this family and what their son was able to achieve.
“You’re off the hook for Fridays until after you win.” Ron reaches around Draco for the marmalade. “But you both better be there the week after, or Rose will be unimpressed. She’s been learning more ferret facts.”
Draco feels so very vulnerable. Like he wants to cover his face with his hands. Potter downs his drink again. Draco wants to make some sort of snide remark about the quality of the single malt that he’s throwing back like it’s crappy shots of Ogden’s but he manages to refrain.
It’s nice, really. To just sit and read. Harry hardly ever sits still for anything. Some of the old-fashioned words are a little confusing, but he asks Belle’s forgiveness and says that when she wakes up they can look up what they mean together. Before he knows it, the soft chime sounds announcing four p.m. Harry closes the book, and shuts Belle’s door quietly on the way out.
“Let me go!” She wriggles away from him, but she’s smiling all the same. “Right. You have a roof, and I need to turn in. Tomorrow I head into the breach. Armed with nothing but a three-page shopping list and a Muggle credit card, I will conquer Knightsbridge and save Christmas.”
He counts the list again. Twenty four. Two tables of twelve set side by side in the medieval stone barn, decorated with tasteful lighting and a new sprung-wooden floor. The perfect size to make dinner feel opulent, and yet exclusive.
“If only. This is just a staging area between the shop and the warehouse. I swear, with the new range, we’re going to have to hire extra staff on top of our extra staff to keep up with demand. Here, take a set.” He reaches into one of the crates beside him and pulls out a gaudy green and red box and tosses it to Harry.
Harry sinks into an overstuffed armchair, looking out at the leaves starting to fall from one of the giant oaks on the lawn outside.
. He lets Draco hurry him out of the Room before he bends double in the corridor, retching and coughing.
Harry picks at his sandwich crust, unable to work out what to say. He’d been sure Ron would be his ally. Ron’s unbridled enthusiasm for Quidditch is one of Harry’s happiest memories from their early friendship.
“You know the job is yours, if you want it,” Neville says, not for the first time. “I know you’ve got a whole life in America and you probably don’t want to up sticks for this, but you’d be brilliant at it. You’re great with the children and you’ve got more patience with the administrative bollocks than anyone I’ve ever seen.”
naked torso wrapped in nothing but Christmas lights, one hand cradling a bunch of bulbs suggestively to preserve his own modesty. Like a very tacky Roman sculpture.
“I’m going to find Ron,” Harry says, giving a little cough and extracting himself from the awkward tableau.
Now that Draco’s been clear with Harry about how he feels, he figures that will be that. They’ll obviously still have to see each other occasionally. Their paths are bound to cross at family gatherings and so on. But he’s put his cards on the table, and that’s the main thing.
Draco pushes back his empty plate and stares at her.  “Give me something to work with here, Granger. I need a reason for him to come back. The life you’re describing sounds bloody miserable.”
“Harry!” she calls, tossing a Sugar Hex in his direction. He catches it and eats it. “Come to sing for us?”
Harry scratches at the back of his neck. He doesn’t want to think about it as “helping” Draco. He’s doing a job. Solving a mystery. That’s all. That’s what he does.
“Eventually, I found someone who wasn’t scared to talk to me,” Luna goes on. “And I found the village where you were living with your Mum, and I realised why no one wanted to tell me who The Spellmaker was.”
There’s a long pause, like maybe Malfoy hasn’t heard him—or is pretending he hasn’t. Or maybe he’s drifted off to sleep.
Draco’s eyes dart back and forth, studying Harry’s face, a small frown creasing his forehead that Harry desperately wants to smooth away.
“Nymphadora needed some time, too,” she said quietly, her finger tracing her daughter’s waving hand in a photo where Nigel was giving her a fond look as they sat side by side in Central Park. “When she finished Hogwarts. She wasn’t sure what she wanted to do for a job and she was always such a… free spirit.”
“God that was awful,” he says morosely, poking at his empty crisp packet and thinking he should probably order some real food. “I’ve never been through anything that bad.”
a birthday party. He’s never made much of a fuss around his birthday, and this year he just...well, he...he’s pretty sure it was just another day. “I didn’t—”
Ron shrugs reluctantly. “I mean, we all were. But yes, Neville was upset by what was said. Maybe enough to act on it later, but I doubt it.”
?” he asks. “If a former Death Eater doesn’t want you to be Minister for Magic, why on earth would they involve me?”
payroll, but unofficially he’s more than happy to trail Harry’s campaign, always catching him in just the right light. Harry sits with old Mrs Handisides, who is waiting for some Skelegro to take effect after a fall, as Dennis fiddles with the blinds and twitches at the sheets.
“How big were the boxes? The same size as these ones? Bigger, smaller?” Draco waves frantically at the cupboard behind him.
you know?” Malfoy asks, folding back the paper fastidiously. Harry can’t stop looking at Malfoy’s hands, but he manages to focus enough to tell them all the story of trying to buy a sandwich for himself and finding that the shopkeeper apparently thought he always bought two.
, Harry mouths, waving his hand urgently at Ron behind Malfoy’s back, but fortunately Malfoy seems too distracted taking in his surroundings to notice. They settle in at a back corner table near the fire and Harry asks Ron for two roast lunches with Christmas pudding.
“I’m sorry,” she says, finally. “I should have told you all the truth and trusted that you’d have wanted to come anyway.”
“He’s not the person you think he is,” Luna says earnestly, looking around the table at all of them, but her glance lands on Harry. “I know you think he tricked me or manipulated me into marrying him in some way, but it’s not true. I love him very much.”
Malfoy rolls his eyes at him. “What do you take me for, Potter? Just because I found Herbology tedious at school, doesn’t mean I’m an idiot. I know every plant growing on every inch of these grounds.”
Harry scowls, toeing at the gravel of the driveway and trying not to give Zabini the satisfaction of reacting.
He didn’t really realise how much he’d missed it until this moment. Missed the crummy office, and the weak Ministry tea, and the rush of hurrying into battle alongside Hermione.
Draco’s brow furrows as he considers it. “I suppose I can’t rule it out. But it seems pretty unlikely. Milli would act defensively, certainly. But I can’t picture her deciding to take something like this into her own hands.”
“We won’t keep you here long,” he says. “The Aurors are going to take the wand signatures of these suspects and we’ll shortly cast the countercurse.”
He considers trying to find one of Gasnard’s superiors to demand more prompt attention, but when he looks at the queue of witches and wizards waiting for the tellers, he feels a fresh wave of discomfort about drawing attention to himself. He decides that waiting one more day can’t hurt that much. He’s probably tempted fate long enough, being out here in the open like this. He’ll get some lunch sent up to his room at the Leaky and finish the lesson plan he promised Elsa.
Draco thinks about Potter, seemingly following Draco’s work all along. He thinks about the delighted look he gave Draco as he walked into the club. Thinks about the wounded, broken version of Potter lying beside him at death’s door.
“He’s a lunatic!” Hermione cries. “What, you’re going to come and live here after the wedding? Put up with that sort of bile at your dinner table every evening. Be real. Draco didn’t even
Draco hums noncommittally in that way Harry’s learning he always does when complimented. For someone so frightfully vain it’s very difficult to get him to accept something nice said to his face.
“Thank you all for coming,” he says, a gentle Sonorus making sure everyone can hear him. “I’m sorry to make you all attend two birthday parties for me, it is a little greedy.”
“None of this is ideal, Harry,” she says with a sigh, patting his arm and turning them back toward the little camp. “But it’s what we have. This is too important not to try.”
And when he does see Malfoy, Malfoy…more or less ignores him. He beats Harry to the stadium most mornings, which disrupts Harry’s entire routine. Instead of being able to calmly get a headstart on the day, Harry often arrives to find Malfoy already pounding out miles on the charmed treadmill, or sweating through his workout clothes lifting weights, a brutally hot sight that Harry could definitely do without having etched into his brain. And it’s not that Harry wants to use the gym at that time, or that Malfoy’s stopping him from putting on the coffee and greeting Luna the way he likes to and so on. It’s just that when Harry
“Hannah!” Neville cries, rushing forward. Harry’s about to grab for his arm to stop him but the air clears and he can see the piles of blackened vines. Luna rubs at her ankle, and Hannah bends at the waist, gasping for breath as Neville rubs anxiously at her back.
Harry steps around the little knot of elves and pushes on the door, which swings quietly open. Lucius’ study is exactly as Harry would have imagined, if he’d ever bothered to turn his mind to it. Towering floor-to-ceiling bookcases full of leather-bound, gilt-stamped, perfectly matched books; overly ornate ebony desk with his family crest carved in the front. Thick curtains cover the tall windows so that there is no natural light in the room, only an antique oil lamp on the desk, flickering with some low and magical flame. The entire space feels smoke-filled, cloying, even though the air is clear. Harry hates it.
“Sorry, work,” Harry hastens to explain, shooing the Patronus away and dashing up the stairs to join her.
He’s about to step forward and ask her for her help when a third Healer joins them, waving his wand at the board and shuffling the assignments for half a dozen rooms around. “Who are we talking about?”
Neville laughs. “Are you serious? You know what he gets like.” Then he pauses for a long moment, considering Harry closely. “Or, maybe you don’t. Harry, this research is his life’s work. He absolutely disappears into it. He once burnt a hole in his hand when a ring imploded on him. He had to spend a week in Mungo’s when something went wrong and he exhausted his magical core trying to fix my parents’ ones.”
Draco tries to encourage them to sit down, pulling up extra chairs from the opposite end of the room, but neither wants to. Cambie shifts her weight anxiously from foot to foot.
“My clothes!” Harry exclaims, tugging at the scratchy reindeer jumper. “Well, I’m wearing it, what more do you want.”
“You’re good with him.” He doesn’t sound surprised, exactly. But commenting on it at all suggests that Draco’s relationship with Teddy was unexpected. It makes him feel unaccountably defensive.
Harry’s heart sinks. Ron and Cassie have rounded the corner at the other end of the hall and are heading toward them.
He’d probably have lost touch with her, too, if she hadn’t been the one to send him to America in the first place.
Harry almost wants to protest. There’s something so objectionable about seeing Draco—usually so nimble and delicate in flight—suddenly as ungainly as Harry himself, even if it’s only temporary. But also, the idea of playing against him again, even in this artificially matched state…
“Even if you have these numbers correct, and I doubt that you do,” Allsop spits out, his face colouring with anger. “What
“Who did he marry?” Harry asks, thinking about Parkinson. The way Draco’s hands, brushing himself off yesterday, were unadorned by rings.
Draco ignores her, reaching for his notebook and writing quickly, recording everything he saw and experienced. It’s very hard to know what will be relevant, so he’s learned to take down everything, from the season to the time of day to the quality of the light.
Harry glances back at Draco’s wrist, covered again by the sweater, but only just. Now that he knows it’s there, he can even make out the glow of the vicious red band through the fabric.
Ron sighs, rubbing at his forehead. “Look, I don’t like it any more than you do,” he says, his tone softer, as if he’s embarrassed by his outburst. “But there’s absolutely nothing to suggest anything illegal is going on here. We may not want Luna to go through with this, but that’s not our choice.”
Malfoy doesn’t take the bait. He just stares at Harry as if he’s trying to solve a particularly complicated arithmancy problem.
Draco finishes an email to Melissa confirming her plans for the Halloween feast. She’s the one who decorates the barns for each dinner and he wants her to steer clear of fake pumpkins and plastic ghosts, scared off by the incredibly tacky decorations that have been going up in the village stores. The computer seems so easy now. He’s come a long way since his first ‘Internet for Beginners’ class surrounded by blue-rinsed pensioners at the local library.
Draco wakes feeling worse. He looks ghastly, skin colourless even by his own standards, and there’s an ache in his lower back that twinges as he gets out of the shower. He must be coming down with something. He thinks it will be best to refer Granger to Bernard, a French oneironaught who’s almost as good as he is. That way he can leave this whole mess behind him and go home. He sends a message to that effect, wards his room, and goes back to sleep.
“They’d have had to be strong,” Harry muses. “Even drunk, Malfoy was a big man. He’d have struggled.”
full of poisons. Catherine was using it to grow compounds for perfumes and medicines. The French just thought she was a witch.” He places a hand against the brick wall, as if contemplating its long history. “And obviously, they were right.”
“Chapter fourteen,” Malfoy says. “Your calendar is a binding magical contract, similar to…” he waves his hand around as if searching for an analogy. “When you put your name in the Goblet of Fire at school.”
“Start at the beginning,” Harry says, sinking into a leather armchair opposite and trying to focus his thoughts.
“I can’t believe you did this,” Harry murmurs in wonder, pushing his fingers into Draco’s soft hair, and then tugging him in for another kiss. “You have to tell me everything.”
“Did you attend on my mother on Saturday night?” Draco asks. Even though his tone is gentle, Harry notices that he falls readily back into a position of authority, the faintest of echoes of his father — an inescapable part of his past.
, he’d like to host them all to Christmas lunch at a nice restaurant. Or that what he actually meant was that he’d like to
He spends the morning seething and frustrated, getting very little actual work done. He meets Pansy for lunch, relishing the sunshine warming Diagon, and they choose an outdoor table at Caper.
Harry doesn’t answer. He’s being paid to find out what happened, not to protect anyone’s interests. Even if he fully understood where his own loyalties lie at this moment, he doesn’t owe the Aurors any kind of explanation.
“Possibly,” Malfoy answers, without turning around from the window, his arms wrapped around himself as if he’s cold, though the room is warm enough to be stuffy. “We made a list.”
“As you can see, attendance, merchandise sales, listening and viewing figures have all been trending down for the last decade and show no signs of recovery.”
Draco looks more exasperated than Harry’s ever seen him. More exasperated even than when Harry suggested using
“When? Are you injured? What happened? Why didn’t you call us to your location? You know it’s easier for us to work when we—”
them. I didn’t even know they existed until just now. If it’s a choice between them and being able to take the other things away?”
“Do you want a drink?” Harry asks distractedly, hanging a set of robes up to get them out of the way.
When he gets back to his office there’s an owl from Parkinson. The owners have signed off on her changes to the League rules.
Malfoy has his back to him, long legs extended out under the table. He’s wearing slim dark denim jeans, and it’s not a look Harry would ever have imagined on him, but it definitely works.
Harry’s shoulders slump. Maybe it’s time to call Molly and concede defeat after all. He could owl her. Then he wouldn’t need to see her sympathetic face.
“It’s an enormous project,” Luna continues. “I hadn’t realised what a difficult mix it is to maintain the trees and planting consistent with the Muggle ecosystem, while also making sure that wizarding plants are nurtured and protected.”
“He understood, in the last dream. He knew who I was and he knew the world he’d constructed wasn’t the one I belonged in. I promise, Luna. I wouldn’t do this again if I didn’t think it would work. Let me try one more time.”
“You’re trying to make me think I’m crazy, is that it? Why were you in my house? Why would you think it would be funny to leave that stupid shirt in my drawer?”
“You want to spend your Christmas Eve experimenting with whether our friends get along?” Draco laughed, looping his scarf around his neck. Harry hated how the layers of clothes were going on, and not coming off.
He groans, rubbing his eyes. It doesn’t feel bright enough to be dawn yet, but when he opens the canvas flap, he sees that the pale sun has crept above the horizon, watery and only giving off a dim light. Ron is prodding the fire back to life, snatching the coffee pot away from Luna before she can embark on any more experiments and gently suggesting she turn the sausages instead.
“What would be in it for him?” Hermione asks, her tone carefully diplomatic, the way she sounds when she’s asking Rose a question like
,” he spits out, drawing his wand and casting it at the beautiful illusion, causing the fire to go out and leaving the Yule log a blackened, ashy lump in a cold grate.
at this moment. Solving the case would mean sending her straight to Azkaban. But he puts his napkin down on the table obediently and follows Cassie out of the room.
“I see you didn’t bother,” Ron says with a snort. He’s wearing his dress uniform, which Harry thinks is a bit over the top for drinks with the Malfoys. He shoves his hands in his pockets and refuses to apologise for not making an effort. His days of having to do what other people expect of him are behind him. Malfoy comes to mind — unbidden. And it doesn’t make sense because Malfoy is the first person whose opinion he doesn’t give a fuck about. Or shouldn’t.
It’s not entirely the team’s fault. They’re young, is all. Last season, the Arrows had several key retirements, and the fresh faces need time to learn how to play together properly. The sad reality is, it wouldn’t really matter if the team
But even with his mugshot no longer blinking at Harry from the crowded wall at Auror Headquarters, Malfoy hadn’t returned to Britain.
Harry picks himself up, apologising repeatedly. “Christ, sorry. I’m so sorry. I wasn’t paying any attention at all. Entirely my fault.”
The weather is cooperating, for once, and the memorial ceremony takes place outside on the grounds. Hundreds of white folding chairs sit in bright contrast to the green of the lawn. Draco heads towards a row at the back, as is his habit. He feels Harry hesitate for a second beside him, unsure whether to accompany his friends to the front row or not. Draco doesn’t wait for his decision but feels a warm sort of comfort when Harry takes a seat beside him a moment later. He looks almost nondescript in his plain black robes. Hunched. Very unlike the war heroes at the front with their medals and coloured sashes. Now and again, Draco catches someone recognise Harry with a start, surprised to see him there at all, let alone in the back row. But this isn’t a day for pointing and gossip, so they tend to just murmur and keep walking.
Harry thinks the whole idea is distasteful, but he’s never had much luck saying no to Luna. He finds himself in the back garden as she clears a patch of earth with a series of quick spells, and they bury the heads side by side in the frozen ground. Luna murmurs some words from a poem that Harry doesn’t really understand and casts a decomposing spell on the stuffed creatures before wanding the earth back into place. There’s something soothing about the ritual of it, even if it seems like nonsense.
“You look very smart, lad,” Fleamont Potter says approvingly from above the mantle, as Teddy laces up his shiny new black shoes. “You’re a credit to the family.”
“We probably should have talked about that, before…” Draco sighs, pulling his forearm away and tucking it under the covers. Harry makes a grumpy noise of protest, chasing the disappearing limb under the sheet and lacing their fingers together.
“There’s a list of spells inside. You can change the colours as much as you like. Have them match the music you’re playing even. Bloody brilliant.”
Harry’s grateful for the distraction. At least while Hermione’s reacting to this taunt, there’s less risk of her examining his own reaction too closely. Her shoulders tense, but she continues to ignore Parkinson, pleading with Luna for a better explanation.
Malfoy seems stuck, staring with wide-eyed horror up at the ghosts above him and the iron frame as it swings back and forth violently.
of all people,” she says. “He was dreadful as a schoolboy bully, even worse as a baby Death Eater, and probably worse still now that he spends all his time here with his terrible family.”
Draco pauses to draw breath. Harry finds he can’t say anything at all. His throat is tight and the anger and frustration and betrayal is raging in his veins. He clenches and unclenches his fists.
“He confessed!” Harry objects. He feels awkward being the only one still standing and drags over a wrought-iron chair to sit on. It scrapes loudly on the slate tile. Pansy scowls at him.
Draco looks at him, a sort of wondering expression on his face. “You really do want this. It isn’t just a Christmas fancy.”
Harry thinks about second chances. About the cool press of Draco’s magic against his own. About the tight band of fear that wrapped around his chest when the chandelier was about to fall.
“This is really paranoid stuff, Harry. You need to be reasonable. We need to take Malfoy into custody and go by the book. I can’t believe you haven’t already.”
“You look such a lot like my son James. No question you’re from the family line! How many generations? I lost track of time a little over the years.”
Ron puffs up as if he’s about to object, but Cassie places a stilling hand over his and interjects with more diplomatic reassurance. “We’re considering absolutely every avenue of inquiry,” she says.
forget I’m wizard,” Harry laughs, waving his wand at Malfoy’s jumper until it looks the same as his own.
Harry’s face feels hot. He decides he’s done more than enough skating to keep the bloody calendar happy,
Malfoy turns to go, but Harry finds himself lurching forward, grabbing at his arm and pulling him round until they are face to face. Harry inhales the scent of him, sandalwood soap and something else, something clean and light, that Harry recognises from their nights together, from last night and even this morning still lingering on the sheets and in the air. Even here, among the fetid verdure of the poison garden, it envelops Harry, pulls him forward. Then they are kissing again. Not with last night's abandon but carefully, almost… politely: finding each other’s hands and winding their fingers together. Leaning into one another like nervous teenagers on a first date.
“I think this is it,” Pete murmurs, his confident gait slowing. The three of them fall silent. Ahead, the thin path they’ve been following opens out into a small clearing. Any trace of the summer evening has disappeared. A damp fog unfurls around them, crawling forward over a brick and iron-railed wall, over eight feet tall and disappearing out of view to both their left and right.
Hannah busies herself pulling out food pouches, while Hermione wipes off a nearby desk and spreads out her map, scratching notes to herself in the outline of the passageway and marking off the blocked exit and crumbled stairs.
“I’m not laughing at you, Hermione.” He takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly.  “I’m not an Auror any more, and the idea that hunting Dark wizards might be my
“Is there something called an “entail” or is the elf I just spoke to confusing it with another word?”
“There’s always a choice,” Harry responds. He braces himself for backlash, but when Malfoy turns his face to Harry, his expression is wild rather than angry. He steps forward and suddenly his mouth is on Harry’s, pressing him with a hasty, desperate kiss. And then just as suddenly he breaks away. Harry reaches for him but he just shakes his head and, without another word, Apparates away.
Hermione hums, considering the notice again. “I wonder if someone has used your name. Muggles have a concept they call identity theft, where a person pretends to be someone else to defraud them, gets access to their bank accounts and so on.”
Elsa gives him a curious look but doesn’t question him any further. “Well, I’m glad you’re back. Those dusty old English wizards don’t deserve you.” She gestures at the waitress for a coffee refill.
, Harry Potter,” he snaps. “You’re a permanent fixture in this hospital because you’re reckless. There aren’t any other Aurors on a first name basis with half the staff. You get injured all the time because you’re not
Hermione disappears up to the dorms but is back a few minutes later with her pack. She pulls out and resizes a leather pouch from which she produces all of their planning materials. Every map and parchment, every draft of every spell.
“Aurors do vital work,” Potter insists, tugging at his necktie as if it’s too tight. His expression clouds, as if he’s struggling to reconcile two inconsistent ideas. “I’m just trying to get my class ready for O.W.L.s, Malfoy.”
“Then we’ll go back to yours. Just for a bit of fun,” Harry says, plastering himself against Draco’s back and running a freezing fingertip underneath the hem of Draco’s sweater, just above his belt buckle. He should be wearing gloves, Draco thinks. It’s far too cold out.
Again, he’s expecting him to resist the truth. To disagree, or worse to pull his wand. He’s not expecting Harry to just smile at him, as if he’s his favourite person in the world.
“Harry, what is the meaning of this?” cries Molly, echoing the shocked expressions of all of his guests. Fortunately Kingsley takes that moment to step to Harry’s side.
in Paris, watching the minutes tick around on a giant clock. He has Draco’s hand clasped in his, tracing back and forth over the black fabric tape bound around his wrist. Draco assures him the magic will burn through it, but not before they get home. Harry’s still worried, though. If it gets reported in the magical press, Draco will never live it down. Whatever tentative credit they’ve started to give him over the Arrows’ victories will evaporate and his reputation will be destroyed, back to being nothing but his Mark.
Draco scoffs at him, flicking his wand at the broom. The charm ends and the weights crash to the floor with a noisy clatter.
The blood floats on the water. Draco’s chest rises and falls but he doesn’t make a sound. He looks so pale, and he’s wet and he must be so cold. And there’s just
Harry looks at the desk calendar with a sinking sensation. Sure enough, circled in red, today’s the day he’s supposed to be at Hogwarts dedicating a new wing.
The first time Draco ever walked a dream it was more or less by accident. Despite his years of study, he’d never considered himself a likely candidate. He’d only gone into Mind Healing as a way of working on the damaged places inside himself, and never for a second thought he’d be strong enough to hold his own in someone else’s mind.
“Just a bit of fun,” Ron calls over his shoulder. “Not much else is fun around here, you have to admit.” Ron’s been annoyed since Malfoy turned up, and whatever he saw in his dreams seems to have left him even more out of sorts. Harry’s used to him getting a bit obstinate when he’s tired or irritable, but it’s still frustrating.
Draco mumbles something that might be words. He feels Harry push his hair back from his forehead and leave a glancing kiss against his skin. He’s asleep before he hears the door close.
Harry’s chest feels tight. He doesn’t even know where the words came from and now all he can think about is the busy little sandwich shop packed with the lunchtime rush and maybe-Tom looking at him like Harry was the one pulling the prank.
It’s a noise he’s not sure he’s ever heard before — a dreadful, other-worldly shriek — and definitely a noise he never wants to hear again. He sits up quickly, flinging a hand out into the dishevelled sheets. Malfoy’s gone, though Harry has no idea how long ago. He had fallen so deeply asleep, exhausted and sated, that he hadn’t even stirred.
What’s needed is a proper plan, Harry thinks, downing his whisky in one. His whole approach so far has been haphazard. He needs to attack Christmas the way he plans for a work operation. The way he’s planning for the security detail at the gala. He resolves that tomorrow he’ll visit Ron and Hermione and make a list of all the things he needs to do. Hermione loves lists, and then at least he’ll know where to start.
certainly enjoys his work,” Zabini says snidely, when the door has closed behind Ron. “Alright, which one of you offed him? Own up, so we can go home.”
“Seriously, Malfoy — I don’t mind our... arrangement, but this is really fucked up. I have no idea why you’ve brought any of us here or put any of us in this situation and if you think sex will make any of it better…”
Luna greets him at the door to Hermione’s cottage with a box of Sugarplum’s chocolate hearts. “Harry,” she says, kissing him on the cheek as if she had only seen him yesterday. “Ginny gave me these and they’re meant to make you feel warmly towards your true love all day long. But then she left to play Quidditch, so I think you should eat them.”
“Wait, yes. I remember. We were watching a movie that had those Muggle flying machines in them.” He makes a spinning gesture with his finger.
“Want to get dinner tonight?” Harry asks, as he rolls out of Draco’s bed the next morning. “I can get Teddy from school and take him home. Meet you when you finish work.”
“Do you think it will give us the same tasks to do next Christmas, or new ones?” he asks, getting up and crowding Draco against the door, hands on his waist.
“And I mean, I knew you were so much cleverer than me, even when we were kids. So it wasn’t really a surprise that you’d turned into this bloody genius capable of rewriting magical history,” Harry huffs with a smile. “But then
Harry returns to Grimmauld through Luna’s Floo and gives the flowers to a reluctantly-impressed Kreacher, and then goes straight back to George’s store. Sure enough, Ginny is sitting behind the counter, snacking on Sugar Hexes and kicking her heels against a cabinet. The queue of frazzled shoppers waiting at the till suggests she’s not exactly lifting her weight in helping out.
She’s still crying, but he sees her lean forward and pat the ground around her, looking for her wand.
“Wow,” Teddy whistles as they land. It’s a sentiment Draco echoes. The buff colour of the sandstone buildings is beautiful against the green of the school fields, and they sit low and cosy in the landscape. Nothing like the grandeur of the Hogwarts Castle, but far more welcoming.
“Exactly!” Harry feels triumphant now, finally able to see light at the end of the tunnel. “What does that mean, and why do we keep saying it? Why would
them is incredibly confronting. Harry picks up one of the pictures and studies it, searching himself for any spark of recognition, but there’s nothing. He feels like he would
Harry sees Draco’s bright shock of hair coming up the escalator before he can even pick him out of the crowd.
Draco realises that Harry must have taken a place in Hogsmeade now he’s decided to accept the job. It makes sense, he supposes, but it leaves Draco feeling unaccountably cold inside.
“He hasn’t even talked to Teddy on that stupid mirror since he left. I don’t know why I expected better, really. But I’m furious that that rootless layabout’s lack of attachment is affecting Teddy.”
Harry snapped the magazine shut and swore loudly enough that the clinic receptionist gave him a disapproving frown.
They’re in a passage at the dungeon level. Ahead, where wide stairs once lead generations of first years up to their inaugural banquet, there is nothing but a pile of rubble. Everything smells damp: a dank odor of disuse that smells almost organic. Like the greenhouses used to smell after they’d been shut up during a winter storm.
, Harry realises. It makes him feel better about the very unusual butterfly situation going on in his own stomach.
“You don’t understand, Draco. You left Britain and didn’t look back. You carved a new path for yourself. Put yourself back together.”
The two of them find Ron looming over Malfoy, who is seated in one of the uncomfortable-looking antique chairs, clearly irritable.
Harry turns the card over several times, but absolutely nothing about it makes sense. He crouches down by the hearth and tries to Floo Luna, but there’s no reply. He’s just sitting back on his heels when the green flames flare again and Hermione’s concerned face appears.
“There’s a pond near the Burrow, and I have skates I borrowed from the Weasleys. It’s an hour out of your day, maximum. And you get to prove your theory right about the calendar. Surely you can turn that into some dusty journal article afterwards. It’s a win-win.”
“I know Teddy has his whole life, and his routine, and his days with you and with Andromeda. I’m not trying to change any of that.” Harry urges, biting at his lip as if he’s worried his words are coming out all wrong. “It’s just that, I was hoping you both might want to spend a bit more time here. You and Teddy, I mean. With me.”
When Hermione returns, Harry begins to tell them about the mess he’s in as far as Christmas is concerned, but it feels too much like conceding defeat. So instead, he focuses on the few positives. “I’ve bought an excellent tree. And I have an advent calendar.” So what if it’s a little spooky. It counts.
“What is it, Mum?” Rose asks, wriggling onto her mother’s lap and reaching for the little troll pin. “It’s so ugly.”
Neville spends time with the children in the garden at Grimmauld Place, showing them how to plant herbs and vegetables, and with one disastrous exception involving Honking Daffodils, manages to keep their Herbology experiments safely non-magical.
She gives him a comforting pat on his hand. “It will come back to you, Harry. You’re very good at your job.”
Hermione seems a little brighter today, though Harry suspects she hasn’t slept much, her fingers stained with ink.
He turns to find Luna and Malfoy cleaning and remaking the other beds. “We might as well stay here,” Luna explains, passing a pile of pillowcases to him. “Ron’s not going to be up to moving.”
Hugo mouths happily at some dried apple treats Harry found in the concession stand downstairs, and Rose bores of the game quickly and starts working on a colouring-in book on the ground behind them. Ron, on the other hand—Ron is transfixed.
“Interesting idea, Potter, but no, I don’t think I will. You signed a new, binding contract with me for the whole season.”
“What if she’s in danger?” Hermione says worriedly. “What if Lucius is holding her against her will, making her send these out or something? What if he’s trying to get us all together there for some unspeakable reason? It could be some kind of trap.”
“I got up, thinking if I just walked around a bit, maybe I could clear my head. Maybe I’d stop seeing him, spitting and shouting every time I closed my eyes. I
The Orphanage is warm and homey. Fires burn brightly in the hearths and Christmas music filters through the rooms. Harry carries the boxed tarts to the kitchen and thanks each of the staff for their work during the year, giving them cards with generous little bonuses inside. He’s so glad that this place feels happy every time he visits. He can’t return these children’s parents to them, but he can make sure that none of them ever feel unloved.
When he opens the book at Belle’s bedside that afternoon, he thinks about the giant canes, and about Alice growing and shrinking. About not feeling quite like you fit in one place or another.
He buries himself in the volumes he’s familiar with and a pile of new ones on consanguinal magic, and the hours slide by, broken only by Tilly occasionally popping in to the room and bringing him sandwiches and fruit and tea. By the end of the day, he’s got a long list of things he wants to explore and the cursory beginnings of a theory, but not much more.
“That game you saw on the screen today, Potter? He was the captain of the winning side. He’s won and lost more money in underground league games in the last five years than your vaults could possibly hold. He’s widely considered to be one of the most dangerous and successful unsanctioned Quidditch players in all of Europe.”
“Owl us tonight,” Draco says, fiddling with Teddy’s robes to try and get them to lie straight, which only makes him wriggle away from him. “And let us know what house you’re in.”
Before Harry even gets a chance to object, Malfoy has whipped out his wand and cast at the pile. The paper flies off the gifts, irons itself flat, and re-wraps itself around the boxes in crisp creases and orderly folds.  It’s very impressive: both the casting
He gets up and walks over to hand his wand to Cassie, taking the chair Parkinson had vacated opposite Ron.
Molly seems extremely confused at their unscheduled arrival, but Ginny takes it in her stride. “Harry’s working on something for one of his cases, and Coach says I need to cross-train my quads. We’ll be back before lunch.”
Draco leans in and kisses him briefly on the forehead, squeezing his arms gently before breaking away and leaving the room.
Before Millicent can say anything, the doors to the room swing open and Narcissa Malfoy enters. She’s dressed head-to-toe in black, which makes her seem even more unwell than she had looked that morning, but her head is held high and her eyes are dry. She comes over to Ron with a purposeful stride.
“Ron can rest here tomorrow while we make sure the path through the third floor is clear. We might as well make this our base of operations. It seems as safe as anywhere.”
The assembled group filters out into the halls, sticking their heads in the empty classrooms and admiring the work that’s been done. Rows of brand new tables and chairs line up in front of clean whiteboards and coloured walls as-yet undecorated with art.
It’s far too cold to just keep standing there, shifting his weight from one foot to another. There’s a warm-looking pub across the street, and Harry very much wants to suggest a drink, but Draco’s headed on duty and how would Harry even ask, anyway? Draco’s only going to say no, and it’s going to be cutting and dismissive, and probably in French.
taste. Christmas miracle,” Harry hears from among the sacks of potatoes that seem to have appeared. He refuses to concentrate on what Kreacher means, and instead gathers the cookie cutters and gingerbread house kit before he Apparates to Hermione and Ron’s.
The tunnel starts out narrow, so he has to get down on his hands and knees and wiggle into it, a sudden wave of claustrophobia making his breathing shallow. But the walls quickly widen out enough that he can get up and walk crouched over, listening to Carl and Pete up ahead, their voices muffled, light from a
The vault is small, about the size of his bathroom. Bill has neatly stacked the contents, a handful of goblin boxes and a portrait, over to the left. In the centre of the room, sitting by themselves where Bill had presumably managed to finally get them out of their pouch, are the rings.
Hermione places her hand back on the wall and closes her eyes, murmuring to herself for a minute. They watch as a new set of doors appears in the wall. Whatever Harry was expecting, it wasn’t shiny black wood inlaid with —
Lucius is lying beside his desk. Harry doesn’t need to go further or touch him to see what so terrified Mazzie. He’s obviously dead, one eye closed and the other bloody and staring, blankly, into emptiness; hands stiffened into claws; his whole head tilted at a strange, unnatural angle.
They spend another hour or so brainstorming ways to make the second attempt more productive before the weak light all but disappears. The castle broods over them and there are dark clouds gathering on the other side of the lake. Even having dried and warmed his clothes and heated his blankets, Harry still feels awful as he gets into bed.
“Lucius Malfoy was asphyxiated — smothered,” Ron explains. “Because no magic was used, our typical diagnostic spells just don’t work. But Muggles have a whole range of techniques for determining who’s responsible in these sorts of cases.”
“Look, I know that you’re worried I’m not serious. Or even if I am that it’s not worth it, because it’ll ruin everything you’ve done here. Everything you’ve achieved. And I want you to know I
Harry had put the marshmallows away and then spent a long few minutes watching the fire burn down, the calendar twinkling happily on the wall.
The second half is even closer, with the Tornadoes beginning to adjust to the Arrows’ style, but having no answer for the rapid-fire hexes that keep catching them in their blindspots. When the final whistle blows, the Arrows have it, by a mere ten points.
“One dinner and you know all that then, do you?” Harry’s angry now, getting up to pace back and forth across the grimy stone floor of the kitchen. “He throws some fancy fucking fish ice cream at you, and he’s redeemed in your eyes?”
“Don’t tell me how to do my job, Harry,” Ron says, turning on him abruptly. “You gave up the right to do that when you left.”
The Deputy Minister goes a little purple in the face, glaring in particular at Draco, who has drifted off to the cloisters and is looking out over the grounds, and stalks away in disgust. It won’t be the last they hear from him, Harry’s sure of it.
. He opens his mouth to protest that that’s nonsense—that he’s always been a passionate and vigorous defender of…
Draco’s chest clenches. They’ve both suffered unimaginable loss, he realises. Harry’s just never seemed interested in facing up to that before now.
After days of fiddling, Draco felt a strange jolt of pleasure when he found the frayed edges of the spells and realised what was wrong. He needed help, though, to work out what to do next and he knew the exact book he needed. For a moment, he thought about what it would be like: to apparate back to the Manor, warded to the teeth against intruders but otherwise abandoned. To let himself in to the library, the furniture covered in dust-sheets; slide the ladder to the right and climb up to the mezzanine where he’d spent so many happy hours as a child.
“Loo,” says Ron with a scowl. “Which he apparently knows how to get to without directions. And which would make sense if he’s been breaking in here and sneaking around.”
Two days before the dinner the owl is back, bearing instructions. Apparation coordinates for the edge of the property. An explanation of the secure wand storage cabinet guests will find there. A reminder that the waiting staff are Muggle, and that conversation topics should be considered with this in mind. And at the bottom,
And Draco doesn’t care about any of it. All he can think about is that Christopher’s too tall and his hair is too neat. And that his stubble looks scratchy. Harry would have opted to go home and have
Before she can work up the courage, he slips past her and strides straight to the till, giving Bethany a wee wave, and holding up the book. She gives him a thumbs up to indicate she’ll add it to his account. He ducks into the back room and straight into the Floo to St Mungo’s.
He’s aware of all the places his body aches — the way he feels a kind of bone-deep exhaustion, like after a day of duelling training or a particularly tough raid. But he feels cocooned and warm. A pillow is soft under his face and he’s wrapped in luxurious sheets. He blinks slowly, feeling his eyes swim a little as they try to adjust.
Draco seems brought up short by this, as if he wasn’t expecting Harry to confess so plainly. He eyes Harry cautiously, and then lowers himself to an uncomfortable looking chair, gesturing at Harry that he should do the same. But Harry’s full of pent-up frustration and it’s boiling over in all directions. He continues to pace back and forth in front of the fireplace as he goes on.
“We need to find a way through the third floor classrooms so we can get up to the library,” Hermione points.
Harry’s alarm clock is an oversized charmed Snitch that takes off at the appointed hour and won’t stop making a truly harrowing whistle until he’s got out of bed and caught it. It was a “present” from Hermione in their second year as partners when she finally lost patience with Harry getting into work a tad late. It’s an evil little piece of spellwork, too. He’s tried hiding it in other rooms, putting it outside in the bin, and once in a slightly tipsy rage slamming it into a wall until it cracked into three pieces. Every weekday morning at six a.m. it’s back at his bedside, wings beating noisily as it takes to the air.
“Goodness. A brave champion then.”  She claps enthusiastically for the over-tanned young man with his slicked-back hair and giant gold chain.
“Fire and plants don’t really mix,” Neville explains. “Well, other than Fire Seed, obviously, and there’s a reason we keep them in a cave.”
Lucius Malfoy only deigns to join them when they head into the formal dining room for the meal. Harry is shocked at his appearance. Somehow Harry had imagined he would look more or less the same as he had the last time he’d seen him, perhaps more gaunt from spending a decade in prison. But Malfoy Senior looks like a completely different person. He’s gained weight, and lost his hair, his pale features seeming pudgy and unhealthy. His fancy robes pull tight across his abdomen, and his eyes seem beady. He doesn’t bother to greet anyone, even his son, as he takes his seat at the head of the table.
“In fact, I think I suggested that Bill should blow them up.” He gives Draco a beautiful, rueful smile. “I didn’t have any idea that these rings would bring me back to my grandfather, build me a home that I love, give me the gift of a godson I couldn’t be more proud of, and help me meet the love of my life.”
Draco hands his wand back with a small smile, crouching to pull his duffle out from under the bed and rummage around in it. When he stands and turns back to Harry he has a small, dented red cardboard box in his hand.
“These must have been expensive,” Neville whistles, as they sit down, enjoying the heated charms and plush cushioning.
Hermione looks around the gathered group again, hugging her book to her chest protectively. Harry doesn’t think he’s ever seen her look so cornered.
“They’re just stories,” Draco whispers back. “The past doesn’t have any hold on me any more, Harry. You have to let it go in order to claim your future.”
“We just need to go back to the club. I need to demonstrate I’m back performing my obligations, and the penalty will abate.”
“It absolutely can,” Hannah complains. “You’ve all had a turn at whatever nightmare fuel the Room has conjured up. What if I don’t want to?”
Narcissa follows Harry's gaze. “That, and an enchantment to prevent me Apparating,” she says, holding out her arm to show a magical band around one pale wrist. “Civilised, really, considering the alternatives.”
“I did some day-labouring on a vineyard. The owner was struggling with a Phylloxera infestation, and the traditional eradication spells weren’t effective. He was going to lose the harvest. I just thought, maybe I could graft two of the spells together, the way they graft the vines. It worked.”
Ron sits up a little straighter. “He’s right. George took great delight in only telling me about it after the War.”
She gives him a small smile that reveals exactly how little she believes him, but pairs it with a warm hug before he heads back out into the cold.
He tosses this one into the insipid fire he has burning in the sitting room, which manages to neither warm the room nor bring light to its dingy corners. Harry’s more or less given up on ever feeling warm in this house.
Behind Draco, the voice of a soloist lifts up in song as the proceedings end and people begin to file out quietly. Beside him, he feels Harry’s hand trembling a little on his knee. He places his palm over it and gives a soft squeeze.
“So, gentlemen, Auror Wong. There you have it. Yes, I lied to you about being in Blaise’s room all evening. Yes, I asked Blaise to lie about it to cover for me. Which he did, unquestioningly, because he is a good and
“Run!” he screams at them, struggling to make himself heard over the noise of the howling ghosts, pointing and waving above their heads. Hermione glances up, a terrified look on her face, grabbing at the others.
“It was awful,” Hannah says with a shudder, pulling a blanket around her shoulders as the group gathers back on the rug.
,” Parkinson curses, slapping a palm on the desk loudly. Her rage is the most emotion Harry’s ever seen her express, and it’s pretty intimidating. “Listen to the pair of you. If this restructuring fails, I will be fine. I will return to my very nice apartment in a brownstone on the Upper West Side. I will enjoy excellent Mexican food delivered to me any hour of any day. I will walk in Central Park on the weekends and attend the opening of Broadway shows and sleep with the extremely attractive pitcher for the Yankees who has been texting me for months. You on the other hand,” she points at Malfoy, “will be forced back to Europe and a life in grey areas, gambling with your winnings and your continued ability to play. And you,” she turns her beady eyes on Harry. “What exactly is it you think you will do? A man with no qualifications whose only career has literally left him behind?”
“Yes. Everything’s exactly as we expected. The founders made sure the castle’s magic was established with strong protections woven throughout it. Over centuries that magic grew and evolved. It’s a big part of why Hogwarts was always considered such a safe space.”
Harry backs away from the now largely-naked spruce, eyeing it with suspicion, but he only gets a few feet before there’s another unbelievably loud crash behind him. The decorations falling from this second tree seem to be made of some sort of delicate porcelain and shatter in absolutely all directions.
about Ron while he’s away either.” Harry opens his mouth to crack a dirty joke in response but stops himself. There’s something delicate about this relaxed afternoon with his old friends that he doesn’t want to spoil.
“Here you go, Harry,” Molly says, passing him a carton with “Stockings” stencilled neatly on the side. “And here’s a shepherds pie right out of the oven. And if you can wait a while, I have mince ones coming too.”
“Yes, yes, haven’t you made a name for yourself? Ribbons pinned to your chest. You’re nothing but a Ministry lackey. Just like your useless father before you. And
When Harry stumbles to the kitchen the following Monday, he’s puzzled to discover Fleamont’s frame is empty. Not that he cares, really, but he’s gotten used to his grandfather’s cheery greeting in the mornings, and it’s strange to be confronted with nothing but his painted wingback chair.
His tracking instincts kick in and he stops moving, listening instead to the sounds around him. His companions are not all being quiet, and he heads due west in the direction of branches breaking, grateful for whomever is being clumsy enough to give away their location.
Hannah is the strongest swimmer even without any magical enhancements and so she takes the lead. Harry feels a gentle tug on the rope in his hand and kicks off to follow.
The advent calendar, now the only bright spot in the room, flickers happily.  Harry opens door two. He expects it to be empty and unpainted like the others, but the back of it shows a drawing of Christmas cards sitting along a mantlepiece. It makes Harry smile. At least one piece of this ludicrous Christmas commitment seems to be working. Now he just needs to get cracking on the rest.
“You’re a sight for sore eyes,” she says as she hugs him. Her buzzed hair and piercings make her seem much tougher than she is. Elsa is a giant softie. “Was it as awful as you thought?”
“Library books?” he asks, sounding more surprised by that than by the fact of running into Draco at all. “Are you…going back?”
He wants to object. To tell Ron that he’s got the wrong idea or to defend himself in some way. He hasn’t even
— I spent all those years not living for myself; I think that’s true for a lot of us — I think I’m still doing it now: trying to get ahead of this long shadow of the way things should have been.”
,” Hermione keeps arguing, her voice pleading. “There’s no way the Ministry will take any punitive action against us with the castle restored. It would be terrible publicity. Harry, surely you agree.”
“What is, saving the League?” Parkinson pours herself a cup of coffee, but her face twists in disgust when she tastes it. Harry hopes it’s cold. And still there from yesterday. It would serve her right.
Harry agrees, washing his hands in the sink while Andromeda waves her wand at the kettle. Teddy is standing on a low stool to put him at the height of the kitchen bench, and already seems to have more flour on his hands and face than can conceivably be involved in biscuit dough.
Harry’s heart sinks. He’d felt so relieved to have the political pressure come off his mind, and so glad to have Draco at his side and no longer under threat, that he hadn’t noticed the memories hadn’t returned as well.
Malfoy ignores his outburst completely and looks around Harry’s little office, which just annoys Harry even further. This is his private space, and he doesn’t want Malfoy staring at the Weasleys waving from their framed family photo, or Rose’s slightly wrinkled finger painting Spellotaped to the wall, or the vibrant fern sitting on top of his rusting filing cabinet that only thrives because Neville takes care of it. It feels so invasive.
“Oh I keep all sorts of things in here,” Luna says, flicking back through the pages. “Grocery lists. Books I want to read. A reminder about Harry’s birthday party. Why didn’t that happen, Harry? I can’t remember, were you ill?”
Luna hums in agreement. “But he came back. Three years ago? Four? Gosh you think I’d be able to remember this more clearly.”
The staircase to the seventh floor isn’t badly blocked, and it takes them only a little time to pick their way over the fallen stone.
“Really?” Pansy arches a perfectly manicured eyebrow at him, lifting the olive out of her martini and spending far too long drawing it off the pick into her mouth.
Harry’s about to follow to see if he’s okay, but Sato catches his arm gently. “Give him a moment, Auror Potter. He needs to … catch his breath.”
he know that? The Post-War Prohibitions cover all kinds of things, but if he’s honest he’s never turned his mind to medical care. It feels wrong. Anyone should be able to go to a hospital, shouldn’t they?
“I went in first. Marsden was standing behind a brewing bench. He wasn’t brewing at the time, but there were cauldrons. Ingredients. Belle was sitting opposite him. Laughing at something. Behind her was a stack of boxes. And some of them had fucking
,” Harry mumbles, thinking about the tendency Draco’s fair hair has to fall across his face when he’s concentrating in a way that subsequently makes Harry’s own concentration impossible. Nev raves on and on about the spells Draco’s taught him, oblivious to Harry’s discomfort.
Hermione, on the contrary, seems oddly satisfied. “I think my theory is right, then. Any spells we learned here at school won’t work. Anything we learned outside of school will.”
Too young, in any event, to be lying in a bed unable to wake, muscles trembling as his mind fights whatever demons it’s conjured to torture him.
Her meteoric rise as a “wellness witch” and quasi-celebrity wasn’t something any of them had predicted, least of all Luna. “My best-selling range this year is riverstones,” she confided to Harry a couple of Christmases ago. “I mean, they’re very nice stones, Harry. But it does seem that people are prepared to pay a little too much when they could go and get them out of the river themselves.”
Molly opens her mouth and closes it again. Ron looks like he’s about to say something but Hermione elbows him fiercely in the ribs and so he just reaches for the roast potatoes instead.
pushing his weaker leg firmly up towards his chest, leaning in to apply pressure, and suddenly Harry can’t quite breathe.
Draco’s on his feet and closing the distance before he can even think about it, rage roaring in his ears at the panic-stricken look on Potter’s face and the terrified way Teddy’s hair has become the same colour as Draco’s—the first thing he does to protect himself when they’re away from home.
“From the Appleby club. I’ve been working on it for most of the season. The Puddlemere offer was a terrible shock because it accelerated the whole timeline, but at least it also put a number on the table.”
He shakes his head to clear it, carries their glasses to the kitchen leaving them in the sink, and heads home.
It’s one thing to take a strong stance on denying any relaxation of the punishments imposed on Death Eaters but this speech is about creature rights, and while it’s true that the likes of Greyback and others got everything they deserved, imposing stricter controls on creatures more generally feels different. Not all creatures are the same.
Neville unspools a length of rope looped on the side of his pack. “I reckon if we all keep a hold of this we’d be okay?”
“The calendar wants me to give to charity, so I thought I’d take some toys to the orphanage in Hogsmeade.”
Harry loses his patience, stepping into the room and causing them both to startle. “Specialist Malfoy’s experiences during the war are a matter of public record,” he says, giving them both his best Auror don’t-mess-with-me glare. “If you bothered to study a little more during History of Magic, you’d know he saved my life.”
“Ignore her,” Harry sighs, jabbing Elsa in the ribs with a sharp elbow, causing her to yelp and smile.
“I need to speak to your friend the squib chef,” Draco said to Blaise over drinks a few weeks later.
“Christmas is about tradition,” he explains, sliding under the covers and pulling Draco close. “Kreacher likes the Black family traditions.”
“Henry Maxwell has been trying to get that manoeuvre right for weeks. Draco’s been working with him on it after hours and on weekends, but Maxwell lacked confidence. Draco was sure he was capable of it. He was fit enough and had the technical skill, but he couldn’t get the kid to trust himself enough to pull it off.”
The Victory Day memorial in May will mark the tenth anniversary since the Battle of Hogwarts. A bigger commemoration than usual is being organised, held at the school for the first time. Neville is on the Trust Board. He’s pleaded with Draco several times to join as well, but Draco’s realistic. It’s one thing for a Malfoy to attend the ceremonies and appear appropriately contrite; it’s quite another to be involved in organising them. So he just gives Neville ad hoc advice and helps behind the scenes. He has no idea why Neville keeps reaching out to Potter to try to get him involved. He’s seen some of his less eloquent responses over the years.
He grabs for his cloak and scarf, tearing back through the greenhouse, leaving the startled Professor in his wake. “Merry Christmas to you too, Harry!” Neville calls.
“No, I don’t think I will. We have a limited runway here, Potter. Of course, it’s entirely up to you whether you want to cooperate or not. I am authorised to pay you a month’s severance if you’d like to leave today.”
Harry’s really feeling like it’s time to say something but Draco’s grip tightens and then Allsop turns his attention to Harry.
“Salazar,” the answering voice is uncomfortably familiar. “Might be the first time I’ve ever heard those words cross your lips.” A twist in the smile makes it seem like it might be a joke.
Malfoy just shrugs. “This is bigger than all of us. Bigger than petty schoolboy rivalries. Too important to jeopardise when all Weasley needs is a nap.”
“Well that’s a fucking horrible sensation,” Ron complains, spitting out a piece of lake weed he’d almost managed to swallow. “Let’s not do that again.”
He looks at her, hair escaping its band like a wild halo around her head. Her expression is fierce and determined. He knows with absolute certainty that she will not let him down.
“And I find myself saying things that I don’t actually believe. I keep telling people that I think it’s best I move back to Europe. I’m half-way through a sodding university degree, for Salazar’s sake! Why would I want to go back to France?”
sympathy for me because they think I’m about to go on holiday to Majorca, and not on this stupid secret mission.”
“What’s your range of motion?” he asks. His tone seems serious rather than prurient. Any hint of antagonism has vanished.
“And really,” Pansy interjects, “who wouldn’t have? He was delectable…” She gets a faraway, slightly predatory look in her eye, as if she’s wondering whether it might be possible to track Dean down and straighten him out.
Still, he’s surprised that any of this has touched the processes of the Wizengamot, which isn’t known for its progressive approach to... well, anything really. He wonders how much of this has to do with Hermione herself.
This time, the front garden is positively orderly. The hedgerows are neat and square, and there are flowers under the windows. He pushes gently on the door and feels the rings respond as it opens.
A jagged rockbed rises from the lake, the dark water lapping at it like an oil spill. It’s not even dinner time, and yet it feels like the sun hasn’t shone here in months. The forest to their left is a tangle of gnarled, blackened branches, and the leaves have fallen early, leaving damp piles of rotting vegetation on the ground. The air doesn’t feel fresh anymore, even in comparison to the stale atmosphere of the tunnel. It feels thick, like it’s settling in Robert’s lungs. But none of that matters because he can’t take his eyes off what’s right in front of him.
