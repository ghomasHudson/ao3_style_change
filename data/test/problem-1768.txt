“When isn’t it?” Seamus shook his head.
They took a break to let him have lunch, thankfully. Bingley insisted on him recounting the events leading up to some of the most unusual damages they were testing for. Harry did not let the occasion pass, maybe embellishing the stories here and there for the benefit of his audience. Malfoy didn’t seem too taken with his tales though, too occupied going over the notes the trainees had taken during the morning, and for some reason that bothered him. He was his patient, why wasn’t Malfoy paying attention to him? Was the stupid list so much more interesting than his success stories?
Malfoy had the presence of mind to catch the boy in his arms as he crashed into him, his robes enveloping Teddy almost completely as he took a step back to absorb the force of Teddy’s impact. What happened next sent Harry spinning. Malfoy smiled, like an actual human being, upturned lips and crinkling eyes as his face filled with warmth, his hands rubbing Teddy’s back “hello, Edward.” He even nuzzled his hair a little with a familiar intimacy that left Harry filled with confusion and strange unnameable feelings all twisted up inside him.
She nodded. "Good luck, then."
Despite the warm, sweet vindictive pleasure of seeing Potter cut down irritating British Healers, Draco's mood was ruined for the day. That little episode made it clear to him that for this operation to work he needed to not be the one in charge, which left only one viable option really. He needed Griffith to take the lead of the medical team. As green and under-trained as the guy was, he was the only one Draco could trust to come to him should he get in over his head, which Draco told him to do in no uncertain terms at lunch when he informed him of his decision. Griffith turned a pleasant shade of sage green as panic settled in when he realised Draco was dead serious about him leading operations.
Thank you to
"Well, that was interesting," he commented, chasing it with a bit of tea. The mint and spice reminded him of long days in the Maghreb, of couscous eaten around campfires. "How much do you know about the job ahead?" he asked, buttering a piece of toast.
“I’m sorry, mate, I don’t have any details. I got to deal with the press and since you’re out of commission I’m on desk duty and support.” Seamus told him, flopping down on the chair, smiling apologetically at Harry as he groaned in frustration “Besides, you should be resting, if I’m benched so are you.” He added, setting up the chessboard for a new game.
“It’s not a done deal yet, but I want to explore the option seriously,” Draco replied honestly. “Don’t look at me like that, France is not that far. I could fly there on a broom and back in a day trip and we have direct Floo lines,” Draco defended when he saw the helpless look on Harry’s face.
Harry blinked coming back to his own mind, trying to separate Draco’s feelings from his own.
moment.
Except this time, they had a leg to stand on. He did use unsanctioned magic to treat Potter and he knew it. Hadn’t even tried to hide it.
if you want to chat or scream at me.
He smiled fondly at the spot Soup had disappeared from before shrinking the board and slipping it into his pocket before heading out to check on the trainees. He should probably get Aadhya as well. Chances were he’d be suspended soon so he needed to catch someone up to Potter’s status in case he had to take his hands off at a moment’s notice.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco heard it ringing clear. "This is what
Thanks to the new connection, the library filled day by day, as the men and women gathered outside it to listen and practice their magic with fewer and fewer accidents with every passing week. Harry often sat on the balustrade under an arched window and watched people of all ages help each other out to figure out how to bring out the energy they had inside instead of letting it burn them up. Every flare of the torch planted in front of the library was a small victory, every seedling of gooseberry growing brought more hope and a sense of accomplishment that filled Harry's chest with pride and comfort he'd never felt before. He was invited to a tattooing ceremony for one of the boys reaching adulthood and earning the first permanent magic channelling tattoo.
“Since when do you care about appropriate?” There was something off about the way Malfoy was talking, paying only half attention to the conversation. It wasn’t right, but his mind was locked down tight and Harry couldn’t get anything from him.
He woke up from a nap one day to find Malfoy perched on the chair with two tomes balanced on his lap and a parchment floating in front of him, a quill lazily taking notes as he dictated in a low voice, he had another quill behind his ear and kept flipping his hair back whenever it fell over his shoulder. Harry kept quiet, watching him work, completely absorbed in the material. He was transfixed with the precise movement of his long fingers, trailing slowly down the page, gently tapping when he found something interesting and he cross-referenced with the other tome, the small furrow of his eyebrows as he concentrated, the thin line of his lips when he stopped dictating to the quill.
“I was just ensuring the patient’s comfortable.” The trainee -Bingley- replied, straightening up and hovering next to the bed. How was he unaffected by the clear displeasure written all over Malfoy’s body? Did the man have a death wish? Or maybe he was just completely tone deaf.
He wasn't left wanting for quality time with Potter. Much as the man had liked pretending Draco didn't exist for the first month of their stay, now he seemed to monopolise Draco's free time. They walked the length of Calcutta several times over, visiting pieces of painful history and celebrations of freedom, from the Victoria Memorial to the Dakshineswar Kali Temple. Several times Draco felt like he should have taken his shoes off and walked lightly in order not to disturb the ground he placed his feet on. He saw the same reverence written on Potter's face, but the fire of suppressed anger that lit up his eyes whenever they stood in front of undeniable traces of England's passage didn't disappear in the smoke of incense that clouded the temples they visited. Draco could feel Potter's longing closing his own throat when they rested near the riverbank, watching the sun dip down and turn the sky into fire.
“I want everything, Harry. I want you and all you come with for as long as you live. I want you to never stop looking at me like you are right now, and I want to grow alongside you for the next hundred years.”
“It could be just your body trying to cope with the depletion of your core, relieving situations where you had to accumulate power. But just in case I want to go over your most recent cases to check that you haven’t been exposed to any volatile rituals that could have accidentally bonded you to something or someone.” Draco put the chart down with an annoyed huff, damn Murphy and his shoddy note taking. There was almost nothing of use, he’d have to go through the ministry to get the information he needed.
“Oh, I almost forgot. Healer Dana asked me to give this to you,” Hermione mentioned, handing an envelope over to Draco. “Came for you from France,” she added with a meaningful look, before walking out.
“And yet here I am.” Malfoy echoed him, holding his gaze, waiting for Harry to point out some more obviousness.
After a while he had to resign himself to the fact that Ron was a great player and the pieces could tell, unlike himself who was adequate at best. But he was too distracted by Malfoy’s face to feel bad about it. He was entirely focused on the board, his lips pursed as he considered Ron’s move, a finger tapping on the table as his eyes flitted from piece to piece until he called out his own. Harry looked at Ron, slouched in his chair, frowning at the board with the kind of concentration he’d seen only when he was studying the instructions to build a crib for his firstborn.
“Unremarkable” Harry replied with a small shrug, glad that the tension seemed to dissipate as Malfoy snapped into action “More boring vivid dreams.” He reported giving Malfoy a small smile when he saw him looking down at him.
“Come on in, then,” he replied, opening his arms in clear invitation.
Draco thought about it for a moment and glanced at the Monitoring Spells set up around the girl.
“It’s ok, we can make up for it today.” Teddy reassured him with a determined look on his face that only made Harry smile brighter as Andromeda set up for tea on the rolling tray.
"How bad is it, Malfoy?" he asked, his eyes struggling to lift higher than the open collar of Malfoy's shirt and the glimpse of collarbone peeking out, afraid to look him in the face and find something he didn't want to see in his eyes.
Malfoy sighed and the fire died down behind his eyes. "I know you can barely stand to look at me, Potter. There isn't much I can do about it, but I'm here to work and I'd appreciate it if you didn't actively make it harder on me. Right now, these women are serving your country better than you can and I have another long day tomorrow, so could you kindly fuck off?"
"Potter," he called him softly.
“I can’t imagine he was, no.” he admitted, rubbing the back of his head.
“Tell me what you want, Draco,” Harry murmured, sending a spark of magic to clean their hands up.
"Besides, it’s not like you had a perfect family either," Harry pointed out.
Harry was stuffed. Every time he went to the Patils' for dinner he put a strain on the waistband of his trousers. But when Aunty Priya brought out the burfi, Harry couldn't very well say no to the fragrant coconut and the scent of citrus, his trousers be damned.
Malfoy stared at him with a blank expression.
“Good morning, miss Hanson.” He replied, a little groggy, reaching up to rub his eyes. It only took him a moment to locate his glasses and he managed to slide them on with minimal struggle. He had a crick in his neck as if he’d actually spent the whole night brewing.
I emerge from the swamp of thesis research to post the new chapter.
“Oh, not your first rodeo, I take it?” Draco asked with a teasing smile as he reached for the bottle of lube in the nightstand.
know that?” Weasleyhe asked, his eyebrows furrowing.
Harry traced an arc over the frame of the oval mirror with two of his fingers and the surface shimmered for a moment, moving like disturbed water. As soon as the waves settled Draco stood from the bed.
And he was his healer.
"Good."
"But, Tedah, you just updated three days ago!"
More details at the bottom.
“I’m sure we’ll get on great, mr Potter. We’ll leave you to your lunch.” She nodded at Molly. “Mrs Weasley,” She added before turning to leave with Malfoy. They walked shoulder to shoulder, his head tilting a little to listen to her speak, with an intimacy that twisted Harry’s guts in a way he didn’t want to look at too closely.
Malfoy glanced at the imposing column for a long moment. Harry gave him time to work out his thoughts.
"I'm going to miss your conversation," he told her, looking down at the half glass of champagne he was holding. This was it, closing another successful mission, leaving the new friends behind to move on to the next disaster zone.
“She was here earlier, said everything looked fine and then went on to do her rounds.” He replied. Malfoy nodded in thanks.
Vikram invited them to stay at his home and a few other people brought them food.
"That's not the point, Hermione." Harry gave up on his idea of storming out and taking a walk around the city until he was a bit calmer. He walked deeper inside Hermione's suite and sat down on the rattan couch, sinking in the soft cushion. "You took a Malfoy on a decolonisation diplomatic mission. How is this not absurd to you?"
What could they possibly have on him now? He was about to quit for good, he just needed two weeks.
Malfoy chuckled. “Isn’t it customary for the winner to get the prize?” he countered.
“You’re left handed, it’s on the wrong side.” He pointed out.
learning something after all."
“A tiny stasis field” Draco replied “This way we don’t need to knock you out and it preserves your brain from adverse reactions to total stasis. That said we can still sedate you if you’d rather sleep through the procedure.” Draco offered, people didn’t necessarily like to see healers work on their bodies, and the disconnect from one’s own body wasn’t always a pleasant experience.
Draco huffed. “I do not sound like that, and Blaise is ready to sue them all for harassment and disruption of public service.”
“What’s the emergency?” She asked, looking around the room to try and determine what got Malfoy to call her in such a hurry. Draco walked up to her and turned her away from Potter’s bed with a gentle touch on her elbow, they were far enough and spoke quietly so that he couldn’t quite listen in on the exchange.
"It's yours, Harry. If you want it." He took out the papers and Summoned a quill. "I got it for you, you can sign the papers now and have it."
“No,” he said simply, sitting down in the armchair, crossing his legs and smiling up at Harry. It was so easy to push him off balance. Just a word and the line of his shoulders wasn’t quite set so straight, hesitance opening cracks in his stance. This was a much more fun game, and it was played entirely on Draco’s turf and by Draco’s rules.
homicidal maniac.
“I believe otherwise. Weasley and I think there’s an actual person on the other side that could expose you to dangers we did not account for,” Malfoy replied.
"You would like Harmandir Sahib. It's all gold and marble, a work of art in the middle of the lake." Harry smiled.
"He's at the hotel waiting for us." She was still getting her feet under her after the jump.
Hermione had the decency to at least look like she was torn about the situation, but that didn't do much to ease Harry's fuming anger.
Draco’s hands were strong and inquisitive when they ran down his sides and caught on the elastic of his briefs, tugging them down with a decisive move, leaving him completely bare under Draco’s burning gaze.
“Once they’re distracted, you extract them from your mind. That’s what the door is for, it’s useful at the beginning to visualize a physical exit point, once you practice enough, you won’t need to. Once they are out, you need to keep them out so we’ll need to build strong outer defenses too or all of this will be pointless because once they are out they can just waltz right back in.”
There was some kind of commotion going on outside and he wondered if there was another major emergency being dealt with right outside his door. It was unsettling being so acutely aware of the world going on around him while he waited. It was weird in the worst way because it felt
“We’re going to discuss that last part later.” Draco cleared his voice, trying to not sound like he was fighting a very inconvenient boner. “At length and in-depth,” he added with a definite nod. “But about your job, there are other ways to be involved in law enforcement without being on active duty,” he pointed out.
Blaise hummed softly, running his fingers through Draco’s hair, trying not to smile at how he was dramatically sprawled over his couch. It was unfair, that’s what it was; Blaise was the one entitled to dramatics and theatricals, specifically of the “missing my wife” variety, when the girls were on the continent on tour, and yet, he had a lapful of Malfoy.
Draco tore his eyes off the girl to look the man in the face. What the hell did they teach in St Mungo's these days?
Was he taking a few days off? No, it didn’t seem like he was excited about the prospect.
The next thing Harry knew was that he was still at the Manor
"What is this?" Harry asked, when Draco invited him inside. Everything was polished and new, but the architecture was old, the geometric decoration of the floors, the shape of the windows, it was a perfectly restored house, and it was massive, bigger than Grimmauld Place. The figures in the mosaics waved at them and there were statues in every nook along the wall, delicate and detailed enough that Harry expected them to breathe and start moving at any moment.
Harry's eyes snapped up at that.
job,” Draco amended. “If I want to take it.” He glanced at Harry.
Hermione glanced at her watch. "It is still rather early, isn't it?"
How relatable is Harry, a bisexual man, forgetting bisexuality exists? Heteronormativity is one hell of a drug.
/Scandal! former Death Eater gets his filthy hands on our beautiful pristine perfect Saviour Potter/ would make a fetching headline, it would do wonders for his shaky social standing.
“I know, it’s expected.” He replied with a wave of his hand, dismissing her concern. He flicked his wand crossing off point number ten from the list. “It was never meant to last long, that’s why we need to get through the battery of tests today. I need a clear diagnosis so I can employ a more permanent solution before the patch loses all its charge, so if you would kindly pick up the pace, mr. Bingley.” He looked at the other trainee with a raised eyebrow. The man fumbled with the tools on the tray for a moment before pointing his wand at the list and crossing off another line.
“I know, I know it looks very bad and it was all my doing, so I need to fix what’s fixable before I get kicked out of the order.” He needed to do one thing right that could prop him up in front of the committee the next day.
“For Rowena’s pointy shoes, Draco.” She gasped, finally getting the whole picture.
“Fine, I will take better care of my sleep schedule if my face offends you, Soup.” Draco relented with a small smile when Soup finally turned around, releasing him from the scrutiny.
Draco found a secluded corner of the garden where he could see a small stretch of the horizon between the trees, the clear sky above him turning grey before the colours of dawn flooded it. He rolled out the mat, took off his shoes and stepped on it, flexing his feet for a moment to get a feel for the ground under him. He took a slow breath and then another before he started, slowly flowing from one asana to the next. One by one, unhurriedly, he activated each muscle, stretching and pushing past the stiffness of sleep and old injuries until a thin sheen of sweat covered him and the sky was ablaze with reds and pinks above him. He allowed himself a bit longer than usual in savasana, staring up at the sky and preparing to face the day, then he pushed himself up, rolled up the mat and resized it to slip it in his pocket.
"Famished," Malfoy replied, quick to follow him when he took the path back to the street.
"Is that a very roundabout way to say you're on the team?" Potter asked eventually.
A sweeping murmur of 'no Auror Potter' rose from the group right as the local leadership approached them and the translator stepped up to make introductions.
“He’s sleeping” Ron said, nodding towards Harry. Malfoy weighed his options for a moment before walking in anyway.
(See the end of the chapter for
"What the hell are you doing in my room?"
"It’s my family." It seemed like a fairly straightforward answer.
Draco hummed and nodded “I did.” He replied, sitting and picking up the mug.
At some point, Harry decided to let the beard grow. It was around the third time Malfoy bullied him into shaving because he was, once again, starting to look like a mountain man in the least complimentary way possible. The words “sad Hagrid” were used.
“Please?” he tried. That seemed to do the trick.
"Silk and Thesral hair" Draco's eyes widened in surprise "It took a long time to collect it and figure out how to work it, I had to weave it myself the muggle way, it was a pain, but look at the results!" Pansy ran a hand down the sleeve, glowing with pride.
"Who are you?" a man draped in light linen clothes asked as soon as they approached the outermost structures.
They stared at each other in silence for long moments, only Harry's panting breath between them and the shock coursing through them at the raw truth spilt between them.
"I was forced to testify under Veritaserum, Hermione, and they twisted my every word," he argued, throwing his arms up at how uncompromisingly stubborn she was being about the issue.
The boys turn twenty-eight and deal with it in distinctly different ways. A fairly harmless chapter this one.
“So, they took the antidote. Which is good, since it kept you from dying, but it means you’re transferring a lot more than we thought,” Malfoy sighed. “No wonder we couldn’t balance your treatment, we didn’t have half the stuff you were interacting with.” He twirled the pencil twice in his left hand, “We don’t even know what was an adverse reaction to our treatment and what was transference. Merlin, Potter, you couldn’t be easy for once, could you?” He shook his head, “we need to find a way to cut you off from the bond.”
He heard Potter slow down and eventually step off the treadmill, presumably to do some stretching.
"Are you going to tell me where we're going or should I treat this as a kidnapping?" he asked as soon as he spotted Harry coming towards him.
“What in Morgana’s name is a Petri dish?” He asked, running a hand through his hair and taking a slow breath to tamp down the annoyance. Potter pointed to the tray where he’d set up to test his blood for three different reactants.
In those quiet moments, Draco looked at him, the dying sun turning his profile into cut bronze, and saw the fire that never left his green eyes. He'd imagined Potter would retire to a life of leisure after the war. He'd seemed the type to need to settle down, process his trauma and get a family, go back to a peaceful home. But he'd miscalculated. The fight wasn't done for Potter, and there was no home for him in England, just like there was no home for Draco there, not anymore.
"We're going into the caves?"
“Kneel, Potter,” Draco ordered, his face hard and assessing as he took in Harry, standing in front of him, solid and grounded like chiselled stone.
"Only because they wouldn't let you land right in the hotel foyer."
Harry's eyes kept wandering towards Malfoy's exposed forearm, the dark lines of the tattoo shifting under the light of street lamps. The staff cutting through the middle of the dark mark kept interrogating Harry on his judgement. Malfoy wasn't trying to hide who he'd been, but he was making a vow to be something different, and for a moment Harry wondered if he could be the serpent in the hand of Asclepius.
“It’s a bit of a pattern,” Harry agreed, returning the smile.
"What are you staring at?" He asked. Harry didn't have a good answer to that question and his brain was lagging on coming up with any answer at all.
With every step and every breath his simmering anger subsided, mellowed by something sweeter, like the knowledge he was in a place where his family had prospered and in some small way, he was there to protect it and give back what he'd received. When he found himself in front of a gurdwara he stopped, suddenly wondering how far he'd got from the hotel. More than that, the sounds and smells coming from the temple kitchen made him question exactly how long he'd been out. His body was still set on the London timezone, so it could have been fifteen minutes just as easily as an hour. As much as he wanted to walk inside, cover his head and sit down for langar in the middle of a crowd of faces, brown as his own, where he could disappear for a moment, he was technically working, so he turned around and retraced his steps until he found the hotel.
"You'll have to get a lot better at charms, Griffith, and not get lazy with the fancy equipment you have in London," Draco teased him gently.
"If we could go up you would be able to see the entire city from there. It used to be the eye of Britain on its subjects and now it's the men who freed her standing tall in its centre." Harry looked up at the top quietly, there was something pulling at his heart as he stood under it. He was the exact same as this monument. England had claimed him as its own, making his face a symbol for something Harry wasn't sure he could represent. He never wanted to stand for anything bigger than himself and his family. But without a real family or a definite sense of self, it had been all too easy for other people to build him up into a figurehead. Could he be rededicated too? Find his true meaning now that Voldemort and the war had been gone for a decade?
“I wouldn’t dream of it,” he promised.
The moment you've all been waiting for: Draco and Harry collide.
“Far be it from me to doubt your medical expertise on the matter but it could be a million of other things, Potter, that’s what we’re here to find out today.” Malfoy pointed out.
Draco hummed with a small nod “Thank you again for taking time for us, professor.” He said, pulling out his wand to cut the connection.
“Hey, I was the one to do the almost dying part, I get the vacation,” Harry argued.
Draco looked up at that and glanced at the small window on the side of the structure to see the light of day fading as the sun started to set. How many hours had he been working?
“You’re a horrible partner.” Harry gave him the side eye.
If you've gotten this far I don't think you need warnings for the content of this chapter.
The days started to blend together for Draco after a while. Potter still pretended like he didn't exist save for those times he looked at him full of contempt. He knew he didn't have a leg to stand on when it came to Potter; any kind of animosity he still held was entirely justified, Draco had done more than enough to warrant a lifelong grudge, and he'd fooled himself into thinking that if Granger was willing to overlook their past, Potter would do the same.
The last rays of sun tinged the sky blood red, orange and purple when he stepped out on the perfectly trimmed grass. The light of the dying day lined in gold the few clouds dotting the sky above him, and the lights of the city started painting the view as the sky grew darker.
“These are perfect.” She nodded, handing them over. “Quickly, Draco. Blaise and Daphne were out for dinner they’ll already be waiting for us there.” Draco smiled at her.
Draco couldn't help the smile that came to his lips at the cheerful accusatory tone she took. "I wouldn't dare, Miss Rana," he replied.
"It's been eleven years." She murmured. Draco could only nod, staring out at the green perfectly trimmed lawn "He would be starting Hogwarts." Draco squeezed her hand and just nodded again, unable to meet her eyes. It was only too easy to forget that his own grief was also hers, such was the nature of a parent, the pain of their children was returned tenfold onto them, and there is no pain unfathomable quite like the loss of a child. There were no words to encompass it, no medicine to soothe it, not even time could cure it, barely dulled the sharp edges of it.
He meant to ask what it was but “Can I see?” spilled out of his mouth before he could stop himself.
Draco stared at him for a long moment stunned and then shook his head. “I can’t accept that apology,” he murmured.
Draco walked inside the hospital easily sidestepping the small group of reporters still waiting to get news about their fallen saint Potter. He only had one day before the preliminary hearing and he had to make the most of it. He had a long list of possible causes for Potter’s conditions and he had to test for each one.
"You were supposed to be the best at Potions."
He steepled his fingers in front of his face, his indexes resting on his lips as he mentally went over every test and its results again, Potter’s eyes on him kept him grounded somehow “I tested you for every possible trauma that could reasonably still be affecting you.” He started slowly, speaking his reasoning out lout usually helped and Potter just nodded along as he did.
Was there a more severe or urgent case? Doubtful.
Draco looked up at him, trying to parse out if he was just having him on “You were engaged, Potter, how do you not know?” He asked, unable to hide his bewilderment at the whole situation.
“How are we doing, Potter?” He asked after a while “Ready to start again?” He added, pushing away the rolling tray and clearing the space around the bed.
Taking stock of what was missing wasn’t hard and each empty drawer made another piece click into place until a chilling realization filled him.
A gentle push of Draco’s hand sent Harry flat on the bed, bouncing a little on the mattress. He stared, hypnotised by how Draco could manage to somehow still look graceful crawling out of his trousers and Banishing his thick socks somewhere on the floor.
Malfoy surprised him again by actually getting up and heading towards the discreet door connecting their suites. "I look forward to our breakfasts, Potter," he called before disappearing back into his room.
“Fine, but I get to pick where you take her,” Malfoy replied with a smile. He didn’t seem too upset about losing, Harry would almost say he looked satisfied, which was not at all the reaction he expected from Malfoy being bested by Ron at anything.
something deeply personal that he had no right to be privy to, but that raised the question of how Ron got involved in it in the first place.
He got up and strengthened the spell until a muffled voice came from the other side of the collapsed wall.
He didn’t have a weird thing for Malfoy.
"Why does he never travel with us?"
They all stumbled back to the boat that night, aware that there was still a lot of work to be done and they had too few hands to do it… especially if someone blasted their own off into next week. He had a plan for the evening, though, and it involved showering first. But they had a little time off since Hermione and Professor Chambers were going to dinner with the Bengali Minister of Education to plan for the arrival of Thai gurus to restore the gurukul, and Harry managed to convince her he'd done enough standing around and looking pretty in the name of international relations.
“You know why,” Draco replied, not bothering to hide the desolation he felt about the question. He didn’t even put up a token effort to keep his glass, all the fight drained out of him.
This is my early Christmas gift for you, I know you've been waiting for this for a loooong time.
Malfoy turned his arm so Harry could see. Above and below the mark sat two rolls of parchment reading “
“As good as Draco is, sometimes you need a fellow sub to talk things out, so don’t hesitate to swing around the Greengrass household when you do,” he told him before stepping into the Floo.
“That’s a lie,” Blaise tutted “you would forgive him literal murder. In fact, you have. And when has Potter ever been known for doing what he should?” he asked with a small chuckle.
"The children are less at risk from themselves, as their magic is small and still developing. Some of the elders received training before the last guru died, but the adults are unstable and unable to ground themselves."
After clueing Dana in on the state of the proceeding Draco decided that he couldn't spend the day alone, waiting for Blaise and Daphne to come knocking on his door to drag him out. With it being the middle of the week and August his options for company were kind of limited, but there was someone who was always available.
Draco ran a hand over Harry’s chest, resting on his tattoo, while the other gently cradled his jaw. Harry could get high on the feeling of his eyes on his lips, the gentlest press of a finger under his chin and Draco not kissing him yet.
No, but seriously, shower her with love and treat yourself to some good angst, smut and fluff. It's the full package. You can come back and thank me later. Or you can always come over to
(See the end of the chapter for
The weekend was spent in various states of undress, in various rooms of the house. It took three days for them to make their way down Draco’s extensive list of kinks, negotiating boundaries between them, sharing any previous experience they had and any desire to explore unknown territory together. The progress was hindered by the frequent breaks they took, whenever the clear-headed discussion got fogged over by irresistible arousal. Funnily enough, their discussion of orgasm control and maybe denial was interrupted by Harry sucking Draco off to a very satisfying end against the kitchen island.
"I'll be the judge of that. If you drop dead your containment is going to fail in short order and I don't look forward to either being found in a cave with your cursed corpse or being dead myself, so I might reevaluate the priorities between the ceiling and you. Show me some skin, Potter."
Harry wanted to make a scene, but the thought of Hermione telling him she wasn't going to stand with him if he pushed her held him back.
Draco let him work through what were clearly difficult memories to drag up. It was hard to miss the clench of his jaw and the tension in his hands as he got everything out.
Tracking him down hadn't been easy, from South America to the Middle East, and then up and down the African continent. From war zone to climate catastrophe, he never stayed somewhere for too long before moving on to the next emergency. She'd been lucky to pin him down in the Sahara Desert, in the middle of a small medical crisis. She'd packed a bag and got the first Portkey to Cairo as soon as she got news from the English consulate about Nundus being spotted hunting too far from their Unplottable territories. The news about it travelled north to England far slower than the creatures did, getting close enough to Abu Simbel to kill a few wizards. By the time the pack made it to the Toshka Lakes, international support had been asked for and Hermione was making her way south along the Nile with a very small security detail, hoping to intercept the medical team.
Harry’s heart sunk a painful weight settling in his chest at the knowledge that he’d ruined things irreparably. “It’s ok. You don’t have to. I know it’s a lot to ask.”
“So you play favourites, uh?” Harry asked when they were finally alone “Should have known that.” He commented, finishing his steamed vegetables.
"You're my best friend, Harry, and a great Auror, but he's an incredible Healer and this is so much bigger than any of us. As much as it pains me to say this, yes."
There were no more words exchanged between them until they finished eating and left the temple. There was nothing Malfoy could offer and Harry was satisfied he was starting to understand. When they gave back the scarves and slipped their shoes back on, Harry knew that something had passed between them, that the effort of making himself seen by Malfoy was paying off. In the end, Hermione might have been right again, it looked like there was something salvageable in the man, after all.
dead. Draw from that the conclusion you will!” He twirled, making sure his robes billowed menacingly and stalked towards the door before fading into giggles, followed by Harry’s full belly laughter.
“France was a success then?”
"Yeah, for three months!" he argued in a choked whisper.
“On the other hand, we have a perfectly good trained potionist who not only caught on to, but was directly involved in stopping said criminal activity, and whose research recently put the hospital on the radar of the international scientific community after a long stretch of silence,” she continued, a smile opening on her face, mirrored by Draco.
Draco had to admit he was slightly impressed. “What now?” he asked.
"I want you to understand."
Draco gave a short snort of laughter. “He thinks I work too much.”
I caved, there is going to be some plot. Not in this chapter, but it will come I swear, probably in the next one. Thanks to everyone who commented in the last chapter giving me the motivation to keep going and actually write down the outline.
Granger chuckled, "You're such an arse…"
“That I do,” he agreed.
Draco huffed a laugh. “Several, you want to see the master suite?”
“Have you gone shopping for school supplies already?” He asked Teddy.
“Never thought he’d actually come around to doing that, but he has real crap timing, as usual,” she commented.
He spared a moment to watch Potter sleeping peacefully. It was only to congratulate himself on a job well done, there was nothing else. He slipped his glasses off and set them down on top of the chessboard.
"How about skipping the restaurant and taking a walk around the city?" he asked Malfoy as soon as Hermione disappeared with the nice professor.
“What’s the second?” he asked.
When they tested the wards, Draco couldn’t tell apart the old foundation, from Orion’s structure or Harry’s new additions, they’d fused together in a harmonic architecture that resonated with Harry’s magic.
Harry didn't mince his words and Malfoy didn't reply, simply sat watch next to him, waiting for a man who might as well be wandering lost somewhere between the falls and the caves.
Teddy nodded “That’s right, you never skipped tea, so we brought tea to you, and some other things from Molly, and there’s books from Hermione because she said you might like them, and George snuck in some new products because he said you need to have fun, he said fun is the best medicine.” Harry chuckled, wrapping an arm around Teddy’s shoulders. The kid was always a breath of fresh air, Harry couldn’t love him more, he had the whole family charmed, falling all over each other to win the title of favourite. Harry knew the honour was safely his, not even Ginny could compete.
"I suppose I should take you not running for the hills as a win." Granger sat down at the table and fixed the skirt around her legs.
“More than,” Harry assured breathlessly with a confident nod.
After some deliberation he decided to take out most of his childhood, the worst parts, and his sex life with Ginny, it seemed like something best kept to himself. He considered taking out some of the war, the torture, the death. But he realized it would be pointless. All of that was already in Malfoy’s head too.
Malfoy chuckled. “I didn’t, Potter, you did,” he replied with an amused smile. “You didn’t go look for anything in particular and I simply let you be where you landed. You were talking about last night when I got in, so that’s what you went looking for and from Daphne to Astoria the jump was short.”
"It served me well on my second go-around. We went for a brief stint in Afghanistan and I did nothing but cast Protection Charms against stray Muggle explosives. I think I might prefer curses to be honest." At that point, even the British delegates were enraptured by his tales.
Ron visits again, he and Draco settle a bet and a bit more. Harry's treatment proceeds and he starts facing the more inconvenient parts of his recovery, luckily Draco is there to make things better.
Harry closed his fingers around Malfoy's wrist. "I'm sorry," he whispered.
Half of the bottle in they were both on the couch, the coffee table covered in parchment, Blaise’s shirt unbuttoned more than was appropriate in any kind of professional setting while Draco almost dozed with his head on his shoulder, he’d never been very good at handling alcohol.
“He’s not bad at his job.” Harry found himself defending him for some reason.
“We do?” Harry asked, wondering where this might be going.
“Cleanup can wait, come here,” he told him, tugging gently until Draco relented and laid down, wrapping an arm around Harry’s shoulders as soon as he cuddled up against Draco’s side.
“Suck it Malfoy!” Ron grinned after calling out his move. “You’re going to pay for my next date with my wife,” he declared as the pieces on the board cheered for their glorious victory.
"So it can be truly seen only by someone familiar with death." Draco commented, looking at it with a new understanding.
He immediately offered up his good arm. Draco closed his fingers around his wrist and gently pressed the tip of his wand to the crook of his elbow murmuring the incantation and letting blood pool there for a moment before pulling the wand away floating the blood after it and splitting it in three parts. He dropped each in a capsule and sealed them before turning back to Potter who was looking at his arm with a frown, gnawing on his bottom lip and trying to rub it against his side.
"Morning, Malfoy," he greeted him. He didn't seem much different than the last time Harry saw him. But something must have changed for Ron to be so ready to defend his character.
Six months apart hadn't prepared him to see Potter again in the least. His hair was longer, and he wasn't clean-shaven anymore, undoubtedly pushing department regulation with the beard he was growing, but it suited him, enhancing his strong jaw instead of making it disappear. He looked refined in the red gala uniform, the gold buttons and the collar patches glinting in the light of the candles. He stood… well, not exactly tall between Weasley and Granger, but straight. He filled his frame instead of trying to disappear by hunching his shoulders and curving his spine, and Draco couldn't help but think he looked like he'd found his place.
“Well, gentlemen, I believe that settles everything.” The same woman spoke up before Andrews could come up with something else “Thank you for your collaboration, Healer Malfoy, Mr Zabini, we will see you in three days. Esteemed members of the committee this hearing has already taken up enough of my time.” She announced before standing up and leaving the room. Draco had to restrain himself from grinning. She effectively prevented them from continuing by collapsing the plenum. Without her they didn’t have the legal number to take any decision and that was it for the day. He had no idea who that woman was but he owed her.
“How are your cleaning charms so gentle?” Harry asked, propping himself up on his elbows.
Also, big announcement: Q has recently published the last chapter to
Harry whined when he took his hand away, finally breaking eye contact to look at it forlornly for a long moment. It didn’t last long, Harry’s eyes were back boring a hole in his soul mere seconds later. They kept each other frozen for long minutes, breathing in unison and feeling universes expanding in the small space between them, as they grappled with the enormity of Harry kneeling at his feet after everything Draco put him through. Draco watched as the tension bled from his arms with every breath. Harry slowly slumped down, an arm wrapping around Draco’s calf as he rested his cheek on his thigh, finally closing his eyes, looking at peace.
"Two weeks," she replied with a pleased grin.
"It's only Deeper Vision, Griffith, you better get used to this," he told him with a gentle note of teasing, the poor man was so out of his depth it was almost cute. "We don't have the fancy lenses you people use in England and I'm not going to waste energy to cast Phantom Image Projection for your entertainment, this isn't a classroom."
Do you love pain? Let me know in the comments.
While under England's control, the magically inclined children of "good" families had been sent to Hogwarts to be trained in the British style of wizardry and witchcraft, with English schools eventually being created in Calcutta, Mumbai and Bangalore. The less desirable families were left to their own devices and gurukuls took care of the education of those children, at least until the fear of revolt pushed the colonial government to become hostile towards the practice, undermining it at every turn, in line with the divide et impera philosophy of the time. Communities were pitted against each other, the traditional "un-British" ways of practising were discredited, books were made to mysteriously disappear when not openly destroyed in order to dispose of everything that could pose a threat to the goal of perfect assimilation.
“My dreams?” Harry asked with a frown. “They’re nothing interesting,” he replied.
Draco's first impression had been mistaken; as they walked along the narrow path through the grass Draco spotted simple pointed gravestones, crosses, and elaborate statues marking graves, some lovingly tended to, some in ruins due to time or disuse. He glanced at the dates, the one thing he could read, and found them going back in time the further they ventured in the field. The nineteenth century gave place to eighteenth, and seventeenth before Potter stopped in front of a small mausoleum. It was ancient, but well kept, easily one of the bigger structures around, with columns and windows on every side. The wrought iron gate wasn't locked and Draco could see the edge of a mosaic that was too clean to have been entirely abandoned.
"I have no idea," Draco replied honestly. "As far as I know you can't change the magical charge of an environment from one day to the next, I'm thinking of the struggle to cleanse remnants of Dark Magic from the earth or buildings, this… This is beyond anything I've ever done, it's centuries of nurture and devotion…"
"Malfoy, it's good to see you," she greeted him.
“You’re saying I won’t have a cool scar to show for my trouble?” Harry asked with a small smile.
more warnings in the end notes
"Why do you have an egg tattooed on your back?" Potter asked eventually.
"Look, if things go wrong Griffith isn't going to hesitate to reach out to me, but his underlings don't know that, and they don't want to remember that whatever Griffith is doing he learnt from me. You're getting the best of both worlds, really."
Draco nodded along, that's why the Potters weren't among the Sacred Twenty-Eight despite being undeniably of a pure-blood line; they weren't English enough. No, that wasn't it. The Black family was notoriously French in ancestry; the Potters weren't white enough to be considered peers by the rest of high society.
He poked his head through the door to see if Malfoy was done packing and found him carefully folding a set of semi-formal robes, which made him wonder what kind of business he had in Amritsar.
“Breathing alright?” Malfoy asked again.
Harry stared at him stunned at the thought of owning his ancestral home, and after a long moment Draco seemed to hesitate in front of his silence.
“Alright, mr Potter, we’re fixing your chest today.” She announced with a bright smile. “I’ll go get a blood replenisher and the stasis delimitators and leave you in Healer Malfoy’s very capable hands for a moment.” She added, gently squeezing Draco’s shoulder.
Harry kept staring Ron down in silence, he knew his stare wasn’t as good as Hermione’s, but Ron was weak to it.
Of course, everyone knew not to let the Death Eater near the poisons, Merlin knew what he might do that he couldn’t do with scalpels or a wand, what terrible damage he could wreak if he got his hands on pain relievers or blood replenishers.
"Why is he in charge?" one had the gall to question.
Malfoy shook his head. "There is no point—"
Griffith nodded and pushed his curls back from his forehead.
“The one and only” Potter confirmed, Salazar have mercy.
“One could reasonably argue it’s still better than being dead.” Blaise pointed out.
“You’re horrible,” Draco chuckled, tugging Harry’s shirt up and off of him.
“I would know if you did, I would have had to release the statement.” Seamus countered “come on, stop being dramatic and play with me, I’ll have to speak with your healer about your ridiculous history on the field in a while.” He mentioned
"I see you're in a great hurry to go correct their misconception." Harry crossed his arms and looked at him with a raised eyebrow.
"But it wouldn't be through mirrors, it would be through the water."
"Anything you want, how shall I style it tonight?" Harry asked, levitating the coffee table out of the way so she could sit on the floor in front of him.
"No, at least, I don't think so. She's launching this ambitious project to start amending colonial damage. She’s going to West Bengal and she wants me on the security detail."
The island had been hit with a tidal bore of 16 feet that badly damaged the docks and some of the buildings, among which was the field hospital, not sturdy enough to withstand the combined attack of the sea and the storm.
Malfoy was a father without a child.
“I’m not afraid of him not forgiving me, Blaise, I know he won’t. He shouldn’t. I wouldn’t.” The cold measured way the words fell from Draco’s lips were a very well-crafted shield for the storm tearing him apart behind clear eyes. Blaise knew when Draco became so detached, it was usually two steps away from breaking, one way or another.
“And?” He gently prodded, his fingers sliding easily through Draco’s blond hair, fanning the locks out over his dark trousers.
Harry trailed his fingers down the v of Draco’s hip and hooked them under the band, tugging it down carefully to reveal his cock, hard and wet at the tip, bobbing slightly when Harry freed it from the confining fabric.
The hours ticked by slowly as Draco shaped each bronchiole, one by one, filling the girl's chest cavity and lessening the strain on Griffith's spell. At one point, Healer Gupta came in with her trainees so they could see the procedure.
I don't know when I'll be able to post the next chapter, I'm writing when I have time and I don't have a set schedule. Maybe the first week of november? Who knows!
“One you chose for your own.” Draco reminded him. Soup had explicitly asked for permission to follow Draco once he moved out of the Manor and wouldn’t listen to reason when Draco told him there was no need. Narcissa had sided with the elf in that argument and that had been it.
Harry goes on a cruise around the world and straight up does not have a good time.
He needed to talk with Weasley sooner than immediately.
"There's a new assignment Hermione asked me to take on," he mentioned, slowly stirring his tea and eyeing the towering stack of perfectly square burfi. How Priya always got the edges perfect was beyond him, and she refused to divulge her secret. Harry's always came out sad and wonky.
“You know her name?” she asked. Harry shrugged and shook his head.
“No more lies,” Draco said.
It didn't take more than a few seconds and a well-executed Diagnostic Spell to find out the entirety of the girl's left lung had been Vanished and with it, a good chunk of the right. Draco weaved a strong Stasis and overlaid a Containment Spell before filling it with oxygen to help whatever was left of her lungs support her while Draco worked.
"Very little. They're very close to the city and at high risk due to the expanding tourism in the area. They occupy a cave system along with some of the territories around it," Harry replied. "Hermione got someone to make contact a few months back and they were doing relatively well as far as accidental magic, but they interrupted communication suddenly so we're going to check."
“No” Ron interjected.
"It's not about England, you won't have to put a foot in the UK if you don't want to, but I know of your training and I need your kind of expertise." She took a sip, letting the cool water refresh her and the zing of lemon chase away the sluggish feeling that accompanied a long journey.
“One last thing to decide. Since Healer Malfoy’s relieved of his duty I believe Auror Potter should go back to Healer Murphy.” Andrews started. That would not do. Draco stepped up immediately. That oaf would find a way to kill Potter before Draco had even left the hospital, or, more accurately, he would let Potter kill himself with unchecked reckless idiocy.
After a while he seemed to grow annoyed with his hair, constantly getting in his way. He produced a long pin carved in dark wood and pinned it up. For a split second, Harry thought it was his wand but that would have been a step too far into the absurd. It was something Harry would have done, Mr I-carry-my-wand-in-my-back-pocket, not prim and proper Malfoy, who apparently carried hairpins in his uniform pocket and could do his hair up perfectly without even looking into a mirror.
Hermione insisted on accompanying them to the embassy and as they prepared to step through the fire, she recommended one more time to be careful and to keep in touch.
"Oh, right." He fumbled with the light cotton until Harry finished tying his own head covering and took pity on him. Harry knew he shouldn't be finding Malfoy cute, but he was helpless and utterly lost and Harry was honestly having a good time watching him flail but try nonetheless.
Harry felt the shadow of King George and Queen Mary as he waited for every last delegate to pile into a ratty car that had no business holding that many people. Luckily the Muggles filling the streets had no interest in hanging around to count how many British tourists were climbing in. He bent his head and slid onto the magically enlarged space, sparing one last glance towards the gate. From this side, he could almost imagine it being built to celebrate the bustling economy and flourishing Indian culture instead of the visit of a faraway and disinterested sovereign.
First of all let me indulge and acknowledge myself. I wrote a fucking novel in less than a year, starting with no plan and ending with a highly emotional story that broke 100k words. I’m a fucking badass. You're welcome.
Also, there is talk about Scorpius moving out of Draco's house and into Parkinson House. It's a particularly painful conversation.
“Did you pay more attention this time?” Malfoy asked before Harry could say anything else, effectively putting an end to that conversation, covering his soft underside.
You can always come over to
for a chat.
He walked in the break room and grabbed two trainees “Bingley, Brown, by being the first in this morning you won the privilege of working with me today. It’s going to be an incredible teaching opportunity. Now chop chop, we have no time to lose.” He told them before walking back out, trusting they would follow swiftly.
Harry hummed softly, letting her get everything out. Ron and he had learnt a long time ago that sometimes it was best to let Hermione talk until she figured out the solution to her problems on her own. She just needed someone to nod and hum at appropriate intervals so she could detangle her mind.
"Just Draco is fine, Miss Rana," he mentioned. "Have you met the rest of the medical team?" He rested his chin on his left hand, hoping she would have gleaned some better insight than the sterile curricula Granger had passed onto him before departure.
A grin bloomed on his face at the simple thought. Maybe Malfoy was right, maybe there was some pleasure to be taken from pain. He fought through the stiffness and reached over to prod at the new limb. It felt real. Well, it was real, even if it didn’t look the part quite yet, it wasn’t the right colour for him, it wasn’t the right colour for any human being to be entirely fair; it was a greying shade of light tan that didn’t look like it belonged on any living creature. Malfoy had promised it would go back to its original hue sooner or later, and the mark on his chest had faded considerably, so he wasn’t too worried about that.
“Wait, Draco,” Harry reached out for him. “I slept almost 24 straight hours, I’d like to talk for a while. Will you stay?” he asked, his fingers brushing against the back of Draco’s hand where he stood next to the bed.
“Patience, Potter,” Draco tutted, wrapping a hand around Harry’s ankle.
for picking through my questionable punctuation, you're a champ. Also
for listening to me ramble about it endlessly and just being a general champ about this whole thing.
"I had Pansy investigate the branches you couldn't track down," Draco started to explain, opening the papers and spreading them on the table between them. "See here?" He pointed at an empty space on the tree he'd drawn with Harry almost a year prior. "She managed to get access to the magical school records and fill in the gaps with a bit of bribery and her superior heraldic knowledge, enough to track down Mr Singh here."
“Yeah, well we do what we can for the most interesting man in the world,” She replied, shaking her head a little. “But I’m afraid my break is over,” she added heading out.
How did Draco miss that? Oh yeah, he was banned from the potions cabinet like a toddler. “How did
“He was having trouble with the ministry and I sorted it out for him”, Ron shrugged.
After spending the morning needling and negotiating for this man to take his wand and lift the world, Hermione asked for financing to get a guru and three Healers from Thailand to support the Calcutta insular magical community, and the same for any other isolated enclave residing in West Bengal. The man was all too happy to acquiesce to such a simple request so he could be free of them and their outrageous appeals to his conscience. He even offered to find them himself, which seemed to greatly please Hermione.
"What are we listening today?" He asked. It was a well-practiced ritual by now. Pansy would come over, have breakfast or lunch with him, present him with her latest creation, everything to a choice musical background, apparently this time it was opera.
"Asked the sorting hat to put me anywhere but Slytherin." Harry shrugged.
He showered quickly and got dressed to work. His belt was buckled over sturdy trousers and a light linen shirt. He slid his wand in its holster on the belt and checked his stock of basic potions before heading out to have breakfast and get the day's briefing from Granger.
He pushed himself up on an elbow and reached out hesitantly. The last curl of the phoenix’s tail curled over Draco’s hip, brushing right above the elastic band of his underwear.
Harry hummed softly, letting the silence stretch between them, warm and comfortable as they winded down a little.
“You’re lucky you’re pretty, you stubborn arse,” he murmured, brushing Draco's hair back from hisface.
“You’re not surprised,” Draco noticed.
Harry fell asleep quickly once the pain abated and floated into disjointed dreams.
SO...
is also a good place to scream at me about it.
“Yes, Bingley, having Potter here is quite delightful, if we could focus on doing our job now…” Malfoy chastised him in a cold sarcastic tone. It was odd watching it being directed at someone else. Almost disconcerting watching that raised eyebrow and expectant look from a different angle. He usually was front and centre when Malfoy was using that sharp assertive tone.
“Daddy planted them special for me when I was born and now, they’re so big.” She smiled, motioning with her hands approximately how big those plants had gotten.
“It’s temporary, you git.” Draco kicked Harry’s foot lightly. “And I wouldn’t even be there.”
Despite bringing their best resources and the sharing of half a celebratory drink for good luck, the mission in the Falkland Islands ended up being more complicated than they predicted. Even under Weasley's guidance it took months to clear the ground and the coast from poisoning influences, and to contain the curses they couldn't lift altogether.
"Just a moment!"
“Yeah, but you have to take into account I hate paperwork,” Harry sighed.
“He hasn’t.” Harry grumbled his mind going back to how stern and unyielding Malfoy was “But he can’t very well kill me, I’m his patient.” He pointed out.
"It's fine."
"Well, this is less than ideal…" Malfoy commented once the shaking stopped. He glanced up above himself where all the points converged to the centre and then to his wand. Then he looked down to Harry, still cradling his arm. "Definitely not ideal."
Out of an unspoken mutual agreement they didn't speak of what happened during Holi again. Things went back to normal, with teaching, restoring old parchments, and surreptitiously advising Griffith on how to spot curse damage without equipment. After a particularly gruelling week isolating and cleansing the ground and animals affected by an accidental curse, Draco approached Hermione to ask for a few days off to travel north.
"Not if I have a say in the matter," Draco conceded. It seemed to be enough of an answer for her to be satisfied.
Harry followed, wondering, not for the first time, why people insisted on bringing him along while they dealt with business he had nothing to do with.
and a chuckle when Draco stalked towards him like a big cat that spotted an unsuspecting prey. Harry was more than ready to let Draco satisfy the hunger burning behind his eyes.
"In the end, I had to wait until my third mission to start doing any real medical work, but that's the nature of emergency healing, isn't it?" He smiled at Healer Gupta's amused nod.
“I died and this is hell.” Harry whined.
"Oh?"
"To travel?"
Harry dropped the papers on the floor and pulled Draco in to kiss him, trapping him against the banister and messing up the perfectly styled hair he maintained despite the humidity. He nipped at his lips until Draco parted them, melting into the kiss with a soft sigh. He made Harry feel greedy, offering everything up for Harry to take and have without fear of losing.
Ron eventually left to go back to the Ministry to deal with the aftermath, and it left Harry and Draco alone in the room, with silence stretching between them. There was so much running through Harry’s head he didn’t know where to start. There had been something growing between them for months, something undeniable, but then they had the fight of their lives and Harry had crossed several lines. They had done horrible things to each other, and it felt like there was a chasm between them, so big and empty that building another bridge on the rubbles of the last one seemed impossible. But Draco had come to him, despite everything, begging not for forgiveness but for a chance to save Ron and the team, asking nothing in return.
"Debatable, you’re just all about power." Malfoy replied, barely sparing a glance at him as he ran his fingers through Teddy's hair, smoothing down the mess Harry’s hands had made of it. "You've been spending a lot of time at the Burrow, haven't you?" He asked, smiling at the bright orange colour he was sporting today. Teddy grinned and nodded.
"I'm flattered, but…"
And wasn’t it absurd? Draco’s long pale fingers buried into raven messy locks, Harry craving his approval, of all people. Harry’s eyes never left his own as he gently caressed the shell of his ear, his hand moving lower to cup his jaw, tilting his head back imperceptibly.
"Are you going to explain?" Harry asked.
“The universe doesn’t make sense, Draco. But we’ll fight this, Potter is alive and as far as I know he’s not pressing charges, this is frivolous, I won’t let it mark your career. You’ve got London’s finest attorney at your back, you’ll keep being a boring nerd for a long time.” He raised his glass a little in a toast.
Many thanks to
He decided not to linger too long on that or the fact that Ron was indisputably right in his assessment of the situation and asked Rose about her last few weeks of summer holidays.
“Are you going to take it?” He asked with barely contained excitement. Draco had told him how much he’d wanted that job.
(See the end of the chapter for
Hermione receives unexpected assistance from another competent woman.
She shook her head and left with a sigh. “You can’t take them back soon enough,” she said, closing the door behind herself.
He still felt like death.
“Thank you, Hanson” He replied before walking in.
Share your thoughts in the comment, they keep me very happy and a happy author is an active author.
He used his free hand to quickly unbutton his shirt, stopping when he realised he couldn't undo his cuffs one-handed.
“What do your elf eyes see?” Potter asked, breaking him out of his shock.
It wasn’t weird.
"It's easy to forget," Harry admitted.
"Potter," he nodded as he sidestepped him.
“Something wrong?” Potter asked, catching the frown that passed on his face.
Harry spent a week being poked and prodded and watching Malfoy get more and more aggravated by the unusual power of his magical core and the inconsistent response of his body to treatment, which was highly entertaining when it wasn’t deeply worrying. Having Malfoy’s attention on him all day long was nice though, brought him back to his school days when his only worry was surviving
“What do you say, Healer Malfoy, will you be my head of Potions and Poisons?” she asked.
“So, you’ve got
"I still haven't been allowed a mirror, so we'll have to take her word for it," Harry added, trying to infuse it with all the confidence he had in his favourite goddaughter.
The days got longer and the heat more stifling after that, and Draco couldn't help but feel the weight of Potter's words oppressing his chest and cutting his breath short more than the unbearable humidity could. The monsoons were going to start soon and Granger's prophecy was slowly coming true. Draco was burning himself out, and he knew deep down he was doing it only to make Potter eat his words, or even just speak to him again, and stop pretending he was invisible when they occasionally crossed paths. He hated feeling like that, like Potter might have been right about him doing all of it for attention.
There was a niggling sensation in the back of his head telling him something was wrong, and he couldn’t put his finger on it, which only made it more annoying. He read through the list while he rode the elevator down. It was standard stock, almost nothing tailor-made, he should have asked what the procedure was exactly. Either way, there was no conceivable way the hospital could have run out of stock for all the brews marked missing. Sure, they had a few more poisonings than usual but nothing catastrophic enough to warrant this level of stock depletion.
He kissed Harry’s pulse point, relishing in the feeling of a strong full beat under his lips, before making his way down to his collarbones and the faint shadow in the middle of his chest, the last remnant of the gaping wound that brought him to Draco.
Draco gave her a weak smile, wishing he had her same Gryffindor borderline foolish optimism.
Malfoy cracked his eyes open. "I never had to doubt whether my parents loved me. I was never made to feel like a burden, Potter. A disappointment, a liability, sure, but never a burden. Neither should you have." Malfoy’s voice faded into a murmur and Harry let it wash over him, settling in his bones. He knew it to be true, but hearing it from the lips of the man who was supposed to despise him was a different thing entirely.
“And you love me,” Harry replied, fumbling with Draco’s belt before deciding things would move along much more quickly if they just undressed themselves, instead of each other, so he quickly shrugged off his trousers and pants, hopping up on the bed with an excited grin.
"What business do you have in Amritsar?" Harry asked eventually. He'd checked and there was no one from WON working there.
But it was too late, Malfoy was already crouched over the water, and a tendril of it was slithering around him like a viper poised to strike.
“If I didn’t they would aim it at my head.” He replied, finally looking at Blaise, seeing the concern in his face, in his eyes, burning on his tongue, Blaise didn’t need to speak it for Draco to know.
Potter shook his head, "I found most of them in a cemetery in Amritsar. They died fighting for England. As far as I know the last remaining relatives died in '46 during the unrest between Muslims and Sikhs. My great-grandfather had already moved to England for a while by then, lost a brother in World War I and then stayed, bringing his wife over."
And he was married… probably. He wore a ring so he was… something.
I feel like once again it's appropriate to ask: do you love the pain?
Q the last part is for you in particular, and for my shameless self indulgence.
Malfoy looked at him half-confused and half-amused by his admission, his eyebrows were furrowed but a smile crinkled the corners of his eyes. “That’s very considerate of you, Potter,” he commented, packing up the chessboard.
“I’m ready,” Harry told him with a determined nod. Malfoy nodded back at him and relaxed against the back of the chair he was sitting in, right next to the bed.
“So, what’s got me working for free again?” Blaise asked, swirling the liquor in the glass, looking at Draco with a fond smile.
“I’m not on duty.” He replied like it was obvious.
There was a stand next to the library where people were taking turns frying gujiyas and giving them out, always still warm, crispy and sticky and perfectly sweet.
“Let’s try again, and be careful when I shut you out, I’ll do it slower this time,” Malfoy recommended, his face relaxed and patient, not an ounce of the frustration harry was expecting showed in the gentle curl of his lips.
“No, no, no, Weasley, you don’t get it. There was a person there that cursed Potter.” Malfoy’s grin, made him look just a little bit mental.
The case seemed to have come to a standstill recently, every lead he managed to unearth through dreams or very careful, very discreet digging through the bond seemed to fall through after a while, which would normally frustrate Harry to the point of breaking something, but, but, but!
The one between him stepping out of the Floo at St Mungo’s and him opening the door to his office to find Healer Moreschi waiting there for him, with a bright green envelope in hand. The shade of green that only spelt trouble for him.
Thirty minutes made a world of difference. The hotel was already buzzing with activity as he slipped in through a side entrance and headed straight to the elevator. Businessmen in suits hurried through the lobby, a conference on the effects of monsoons on potion brewing was setting up the welcome desk in a corner, and the delicious smell of food wafted out of the restaurants. He nabbed a lift and got up to their floor with just enough time to shower and change before breakfast. As soon as the lift doors opened Potter's face greeted him from the corridor.
"I still fail to see what prompted you to get all the way here just to recruit me."
"All done, Uncle Harry!" Rose announced, twisting the nail polish bottle shut. "Dad can you dry them, please?"
Harry choked on the enormity of that loss, a loss that wasn’t even his own.
Harry was only too happy to oblige the desperate plea with a messy wet kiss. It didn’t take more than a couple more strokes for Draco to spill over both of their hands, with a grunt that Harry greedily swallowed, pulling back only when he felt Draco’s cock start softening.
“The available evidence points to yes.” Draco conceded “We still don’t know how it came to be since every single test we ran turned up negative. Nothing in your recent missions could have caused something like this, residue doesn’t just migrate on its own.” He started before realization hit him.
From the moment he stepped into the room, Miss Rana didn't leave his side for a moment, as dignitary after dignitary came to congratulate him on the job, forcing him to deflect any merit towards Healer Gupta, the one who actually did the work that would have long-lasting impact on the health and wellbeing of the local magical community by grounding their magic and balancing the energies in their bodies.
“Alright, alright, I’m going to bed.” Draco relented with a sigh, waving his wand and sending all his notes neatly inside a folder before heading to bed for a few hours of sleep.
"But we're not here to talk about Griffith, are we? We're here because I don't deserve luxury." Every word was dripping with a patronising sweetness. "Do you know what happens when you spend sixteen hours a day casting? You were combat trained; you should have an inkling. Your muscles get stiff. I know thinking has never been your forte but make a bit of effort with me, Potter. Do you know what happens if my hand cramps at the wrong moment?"
"I have protection against Dark Magic, Potter!" Malfoy got up and dusted himself off, and as Harry looked at him noticed a shimmer around him that couldn't be attributed to the light glinting off his hair; it was distinctly magical in nature. "And a Protection Charm would have sufficed, no need to blast off half the room."
There is a funeral and discussion of death with children in this one, so be warned.
“Yes! We went on Saturday and I have so many new books. I can’t wait to start classes again, and Ginny helped me train a little more when we went to the burrow. You’ll see, I’ll make the team, Kenny, our seeker, graduated last year and Ginny said I got much better this summer. She thinks I’d be a good seeker.” Teddy beamed as he reported his progress to Harry. He barely took a breath before delving into detailed recounts of his latest training session with Ginny and asking about Harry’s time as a seeker for Gryffindor. Harry was more than happy to indulge him, retelling the most exciting games and sharing strategy and techniques he’d learned during his years on the team.
"Are you asking for gossip, Draco ji?"
"Any chance you can contact Granger from down here? I'm fairly confident this constitutes 'something bad happening' and warrants a coin message."
Malfoy averted his eyes with an awkward smile. "Yeah… thank you for that. That's twice you got my back."
"I've seen the embassy," Malfoy argued.
I promised a happy ending, didn't I?
“Uhm...” McReary gave him a hesitant look and for a moment Draco thought he was going to say no, it was a strange request, after all, and he was pushing his luck. “It’s on the table but Murphy’s out talking with our suppliers to see if we can get some extra to cover the emergencies.”
“My shift ended an hour ago and unlike other trainees, I don’t have exams to prepare for,” Malfoy replied curtly, tapping the bottom of his pencil on the pad. “If you please, Potter,” he prompted, getting comfortable in his chair, poised to take notes.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Do you need a break, Potter?” Malfoy asked once Healer Dana left the room. Harry shook his head.
"I promised you, didn't I? Whatever you need from me. Somehow I doubt this one is going to be that much of a chore."
And it was Malfoy anyway, it wouldn’t be right.
“Malfoy’s going to have a field day with that” Harry groaned, he’d done some stupid shit and of all people he wanted to get their hands on that kind of information Malfoy was probably the last.
"Are you really that surprised that a suburban English family was eager to pretend their mixed-raced ward didn’t exist?" Harry asked, with a touch of disbelieving amusement in his voice.
had become a parody of itself. Potter was barely out of danger and his image was already being used for some screwed up fetishistic hero fantasy to titillate the morbid curiosity of the masses. While the mediwixen doing actual outstanding work were discounted as extras in the production that was Harry Potter’s life.
“It wasn’t your lucky night, go look for a scoop somewhere else before I call security,” he told him in an even and deadly tone.
“Do you want to finish the tour?” Draco gently squeezed his hand, nudging him back inside.
"I'm sure you'll survive just fine, Sādā Sāpa," she replied with that mild teasing tone that made Draco miss Pansy dearly.
I've been working on my owlpost entries and sirius black fest as well, so stay tuned for those when they drop.
who got my ass into gear for this chapter.
"I believed in Ambassador Granger's programme," Griffith replied quickly.
“Hey mate, did you take a nice nap?” Ron asked when he noticed he was awake.
Harry kept his wand in front of himself, paying attention to where he stepped on the slippery rock. There were cracks in the walls and signs of collapsed corridors, but what caught his attention were the etchings in the walls and how the rock formations were delicately shaped.
Harry shook his head. "Nothing. We're good, I just didn't think we would celebrate quite this traditionally."
Draco sighed, tracing the flourished curls of the P taking over the bottom side of the parchment. He loved Pansy dearly, and he certainly appreciated her craftmanship, her art, but he’d wished he could spare her the trouble this one time. There was going to be no triumphant exit from the hospital the following afternoon, radiant in Pansy’s elaborate garments. Not even Blaise could save him this time. He’d slipped. No, it hadn’t been a slip, he’d known what he was getting into, it was no mistake. He’d taken a calculated risk to save Potter’s life and ended up setting his career on fire.
Malfoy frowned in concentration, probably trying to recall the name."Bhang Thandai?" It sounded almost like a question as his lips tentatively tried to shape the syllables.
“About as well as we could expect. I’m suspended from duty pending investigation, but Blaise got them to expedite the proceedings so it’s not going to be long at all. Basically a long weekend.” He told her, taking off his family rings and handing them off to Soup.
"Potter, am I happy to see you again. Ready to wrangle this bunch of excitable bureaucrats?" she asked with a smile that stank of dread.
“Better safe than sorry… Oh, hey mate, when did you wake up?” Ron asked when he finally noticed Harry wasn’t sleeping anymore.
Draco hummed. “If I didn’t know any better I’d say you were hungover,” he commented with a shake of his head.
“I’m not sure, Potter’s description of potion ingredients leaves something to be desired, it could be a stimulant of some kind but...” he tightened his lips and looked up at Harry, “the last dream you had, you mentioned a greenhouse and plants looking like snakes?” he asked.
"Yeah, in school, ten years ago! Then I went in a line of work where I had to learn to rely on my wand alone. Even if I knew how to brew them, we wouldn't have ingredients or time to make them. These people are actively dying."
“I can always refuse treatment after that.” He added. He was going to see it to the end.
“You already know.” Harry was about to argue that no, he didn’t, but then it clicked, Ron’s voice resonating in his head.
"You're a staunch believer in anticolonialism, to the point of sacrificing three months during your last year of training to work unpaid in a field that's clearly not your choice of specialisation?" Draco's face was collected and his tone deadpan. It didn't take more than ten seconds for Griffith to break.
They'd been going down for some time; Harry wasn't sure how long, but the way had been steep and it had gotten cold and dark enough that Vikram's spell didn't quite reach all the nooks and crannies of the rocks around them. But this corridor was different; the darkness there had a different quality, it was thick and almost palpable, it rejected light and at the same time it beckoned one closer, in a way that reminded Harry of the shade under a Dementor's tattered cloak. It was a danger that didn't try to hide, and at the same time had an irresistible allure.
"You're running away, and trying to make yourself feel better. This? This is performance, it has
Malfoy walked in bright and early with the results of his latest exams. He didn't look too pleased with what he was reading.
The tea was entirely forgotten at that point, and they left without even touching it. Taranjit guided them behind the tea room and into an alley, with a simple touch of his hand he opened a passage into a cobbled street that hadn’t been there a moment ago and led the way inside.
“Since he didn’t agree to play this game with me. Since I asked him to be honest, and he is, and he thinks I’m doing the same but I’m not. I’m serious Blaise, please, I feel like I’m fucking up and I’m bringing Weasley down with me.”
"Yes, but Griffith is good enough for what he needs to do." Draco shrugged, amused by Potter's frustration. It was surreal to see him this torn up about it.
He settled against the pillows and looked into Malfoy’s eyes as he levelled his wand with purpose.
“She was right,” Harry pointed out.
The last bit of angst happens here but is resolved quickly. We're fully directed towards the happy ending, full steam ahead.
"How are you holding up, Sādā Sāpa?"
"Fine, if you're that desperate. I'm on board. Send me a letter when you have your ducks in a row and ready to Portkey out. You know where I live." He stood and picked up his empty glass to return it to the sink to wash.
“I’m not leaving him here, Malfoy, in the hands of the people that almost killed him and will happily try again.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Emmanuel was talking about bringing professors in from England and I don’t like it. That's more of what screwed the magical culture in the first place. But I can't leave those people to fend for themselves."
When he opened his eyes again Healer Gupta was standing over him with an inquisitive smile on her face.
“This is my home, I don’t care if it doesn’t want me anymore,” he murmured, the words sticking together as they tumbled from his mouth, the pain numbed by Ogden’s excellent brew. “It’s where my mother is, and she can’t leave however much she may want to.” He closed his eyes and taking a slow breath. “It’s where Edward and Andromeda are, it’s where you and Pansy are.” He opened his eyes, looking at the silver ring, sitting unassuming on his finger. “It’s where I buried Astoria and all she brought to my life,” he whispered.
“Potter, this is going to be very hard for you if you don’t stop presuming you already know,” Malfoy replied placidly, slowly loosening the straps of his holster and letting it slide off to reveal the faded mark underneath it.
"Mr Potter! It's a relief to finally see you!"
“How do you-”
Draco laughed. "I will try asking."
"Same to you, Granger. Say hi to Blaise for me when you get back to England."
"But…"
if you want to chat.
“Good,” Draco hummed, letting the glass float next to him so he could try the cake.
know?” he asked. The actual question Draco wanted to ask was why in the name of all that is good and sacred didn’t he tell him he was working in the lion’s den, but he bit his tongue and held back.
“I guess I’m not.” Draco couldn’t pretend he hadn’t seen what he had inside Potter’s mind, or how he looked at him. “Can I offer you some tea?”
"I wasn't allowed to train as a Healer, that's why I left." Why he stayed away was another question entirely. "You're not what I expected either, Timothy Griffith," Draco mentioned to steer the conversation towards safer ground.
“Working,” Malfoy replied as if it were obvious.
"You have to see it in person. It's not far. I'll explain when we're there," Draco replied.
"Is this a joke to you? A paid vacation where you could go enjoy the stay and live like a gentleman of leisure at England's expense?"
Where was Pansy when he needed her? Living fancy and seducing French models, leaving him and Soup to keep this vaguely Draco-shaped mess together while he did his best to self-destruct.
“What is it? They didn’t get your best side for the headshot?” Harry teased.
The sand crunched under her boots as she took a few steps toward the tent but before she could reach it, a hand pushed the flap aside from inside and he stepped out, the disinfection charms still glimmering around him as he stretched, turning his face up to the sun. Despite everything, she still felt relief wash over her as she saw him physically there.
He went back to the hotel after sharing a simple meal with a sea of strangers, feeling more connected than he'd ever remembered feeling since his first dinner in the Great Hall at Hogwarts.
Malfoy glanced back at him with an expression of vague confusion.
Why weren’t hospital rooms outfitted with a clock? At least he’d have something to stare at while he waited, instead of the dull pastoral scene in the painting hung on the wall opposite the bed. There weren’t even people there he could chat with. What was the point of putting a magical painting in a hospital room if it didn’t have people in it he could talk to?
It took three weeks for Miss Rana’s teasing nickname 'Sādā sāpa' to catch on, and soon after that the elders started calling him 'Sāhab-ji'  bowing their heads and smiling whenever they saw the tattoo on his forearm. He was used to it, the way communities prostrated by tragedy flocked around a Healer or a teacher. He only tried once to dissuade them from using honorifics for him. His feelings about it mattered very little, what was important was bringing comfort to them when he couldn't bring health. He tried to deflect the attention towards Healer Gupta during meals. She was doing the actual life-changing work. He was only putting plasters on cuts after all, and she was working to exhaustion with her trainees, balancing the magical cores of kids and adults, moulding misshapen magic grown wild and without control in elders, twisting the environment around them. Her work was what would make a difference once they left.
Harry sighed and started talking from the end, working his way back to the beginning, through endless boring nights walking through greenhouses, stocking cabinets, brewing and bottling potions, studying schedules, like some kind of administrative employee. Malfoy let him talk freely, interrupting him very rarely, only to ask for more details.
He’d retired as a healer not too long ago to focus on teaching and research, Beauxbatons had been more than happy to have him on staff and open a post-NEWT course in preparation for healer training. Draco had to hope he’d be willing to spare a few moments for him. French flowed easily as he explained the situation and asked for his invaluable input. He signed at the bottom and sealed the letter with the hospital’s seal before sending it off into international floo postage delivery.
"Quite a bit, how about you?" His tone was calm but Harry could read the provocation behind the words, the snake behind the flower.
After that night he managed to go a full two weeks without doing anything stupid. He kept up with his Occlumency training with Malfoy, he very carefully explored the extent of his bond with the man on the other side, he relayed his dreams to Ron twice a week, slipping in whatever extra information he dug up through the bond, and obeyed Paul’s every order when it came to his physical therapy.
to chat.
It happened especially after sex. Harry wasn’t sure it had been an actual conscious decision on either of their parts, but he never found Draco’s walls up when he nudged his mental boundaries, basking in their combined afterglow. He never really thought about it until one day right before he left for the training retreat. They were at Draco’s, and Harry was floating on a cloud of warm bliss after getting the fuck of his life. He’d insisted Draco not heal the rope burns and, right then, he was cuddled up against Draco’s side, their legs tangled with the sheets. Draco’s arm was wrapped around his shoulders, his fingers drawing light patterns on his arm, probably following the imprint of the rope, luxuriating in the mark he left on Harry’s body. Harry reached out, slowly tracing the flower on Draco’s sternum, right in front of his face where he was resting his head on Draco’s chest. He felt the hitch in Draco’s breath at the first contact of his fingers and then slowly even out. He could feel the contentment and satisfaction radiating out of Draco, the undercurrent of pride soothing Harry’s mind, settling over his body like a blanket, pushing every doubt and shred of self-consciousness out and away.
“So?”
Draco took his hand away with an apologetic hum around Harry’s cock.
"I want it." Harry interrupted him, his heart beating fast against his ribs, trying to jump out and fill every room of the house, breathe in every scent and taste the magic in the air.
"You're going to be fine. You do want this operation to succeed, don't you?"
In the following few days, Draco felt the mayhem the sting unleashed on the delicate balance of hospital politics. Andrews had to step back and actually manage his ward, instead of networking to get the Chief Medical Officer nomination, leaving the rest of the sharks scrambling for it. Then he heard he’d been taken off the leadership of the potions and poisons department entirely, and Moreschi had been nominated interim CMO. He tried to stay as far from it as possible, focusing on his trainees and praying that the labs wouldn’t crap out on him again due to inconsistent leadership. Soon Hogwarts students would come home, and he couldn’t have an understocked hospital when that happened.
and I have no doubt he’s going to take good care of you, I don’t need to tell you that, but there are two things I feel like I need to make very clear before you jump into it head first like the Gryffindor you are. First is that the relationship goes both ways, he takes care of you and you do the same for him,” Blaise gave him a very meaningful look and Harry nodded dutifully. It was odd to see him suddenly so serious and protective of Draco, given the context of their discussion and the light teasing tone he’d kept all afternoon, taking exactly zero topics seriously.
"They say you're a Death Eater."
See you the first week of september for the next chapter.
He followed the line of Potter's flank with his eyes, taking in every detail, every scar, every dark hair on his arms and his chest. He was in no hurry, as if dawn would last forever and he could finally drink in Potter until he was satisfied, but when he followed the bridge of his straight nose up, he found Potter's eyes open and staring right back at him, without the protection of the round spectacles hiding them. There was no accusation, no fear, no disdain, nothing of what Draco was used to finding behind Potter's green eyes when they rested on him.
Given the restricted time limit and his language challenges, he had very little options, which brought him to knocking on Potter's door.
Bonhomme didn’t take much longer to reply, letting Draco know he’d be happy to help out a young healer, asking what time would be most convenient for him and if he’d mind talking through mirrors instead of fireplaces, mentioning how the knees of an old man don’t suffer very well extended floo calls.
“Thanks for coming, Andy.” He told Andromeda as she transfigured the plastic chair into something a little more comfortable to settle in.
“I wonder why,” Malfoy shot back. “They seem to like her much more these days,” he commented.
“I’m your Healer,” he said it as if it was the most obvious thing in the world as he kept working.
Harry raised his hands in a placating manner and smiled. "Seriously, though, I want to show you a place and you've barely been anywhere that isn't the hotel and the village."
“I have
Malfoy took a few gulps and then closed his eyes, resting his head against the rock wall, trying to catch his breath.
"I know, it's just… I'm not sure if I'm up for it," he admitted. "It's obvious they want me just because I'm desi, but I'm really not, you know? I grew up in a white household, completely removed from everything, and I'm only starting to figure things out now at twenty-seven. I only went once with you last winter. What if they expect me to have everything together?"
"I'm trying to actually make things better here, Potter, I'm sure you haven't forgotten I have a debt with the world that I can't hope to pay in a lifetime."
"Our magic," Vikram confirmed when Harry asked about them. "Home and magic, same shape."
"We can't go up," Harry mentioned. "It's been restricted since a guy jumped off." It was an extremely crass way of putting it but it was satisfying to see Malfoy's cheeks tinge with shame at the indelicate remark. "Do you know what this is?" he asked.
Draco stepped out of the shower to find Harry still fidgeting with his clothes. He'd changed at least three times, judging by the array of clothes strewn over the bed.
Draco was fascinated by the sculptures dotting the border of the magical wards, as if they were guarding and protecting the community from outside influence.
"I do," Malfoy whispered, "I owe you, and whatever you need from me I will do, Potter, but I don't believe you know what that is."
Harry chuckled, “She’s right, I shouldn’t have said that, I’m sorry.” he told her.
“Like rubbish,” he replied.
“Oh, no, I definitely want to watch.” Potter replied, sounding almost excited at the prospect.
By the time Draco finally drizzled a bit of lube on his fingers they had been warmed up enough by harry’s skin to warm the gel up in turn before he gently traced the furled rim, making it glisten. Harry was
“Safe ways to sever a bond,” Malfoy replied, unperturbed by the annoyed glare Harry sent his way at the answer.
He did check his vitals once more before leaving as quietly as he’d come in.
"And how did it end up occupied by you instead?"
"I've been suspended until the end of the investigation into my misconduct." He replied. "It's fine, Blaise has everything in hand and I get to spend some time with my mother." he pre-empted her comment.
“So, have you figured out where you’re going to be staying until Grimmauld gets sorted out?” Draco asked, propping his feet up on Harry’s bed as they shared lunch.
Harry was left with a small smile, wondering whether she liked him or not. She did spend her break with him, keeping him company, but she’d been full of fire about the inconvenience he was causing by being there and attracting attention. He managed to catch a nap until lunch, blessedly void of nightmares and keeping him from dying of boredom. Malfoy had promised a chessboard but had never come back… He did have other patients to attend to. He just wished he’d come back.
Harry couldn’t help but chuckle, he was getting predictable, or maybe Harry had been spending a little too much time inside Malfoy’s head and vice-versa.
“They have a leg to stand on,” he admitted, running a hand through his hair, exhaustion starting to catch up to him now that he didn’t have to put on a façade for the world.
"I was hoping that a drastic drain of his reserves would induce a heart attack, and defibrillation would amount as close enough to death to dissolve the bond," Draco continued, glancing at Harry who was struggling to stay awake as they discussed details. Harry smiled sleepily at him, basking in the tentative warmth reigniting behind Draco’s eyes. How could eyes that looked so much like ice warm a man like that Harry didn’t know, but he wasn’t going to question it when Draco smiled back.
“Ready when you are.” Dana gave him the go ahead and he rescinded the adhesion charm keeping the patch on Potter’s chest. He levitated it away and blood started trickling out of the wound at a sedated pace.
Soup was merciful enough to allow him two fully caffeinated cups of coffee before sending him on his way.
Would he ever get to make something so good?
“You better. I swear to Merlin if I have to deal with protesters outside my hospital again, Weasley...” Draco shook his head.
"We all are at the beginning." Draco shrugged. "You're used to a fully stocked hospital, with state-of-the-art machinery and infrastructure. It's going to be an adjustment to have only your wand to rely on."
were used, making Draco’s eyes roll so high he almost hurt himself. What cemented the whole article as garbage was the sprawling picture of the scene with field medics working on stabilizing the victims enough to send them to st Mungo and a nice closeup of Potter captioned
Lord only knows when the next chapter will come out. Somewhere in the second half of June from how things look right now. Your comments keep me motivated and boost my energy so keep them coming, they are lovely.
“Get the dragonhide ones.” He called after her. She emerged victorious a few minutes after Soup went in to assist her, holding a pair of skin tight dragonhide trousers she and Blaise had gotten him on some kind of occasion he couldn’t quite remember.
"I'm sorry," Harry apologised.
As you can see we have a final chapter count, that's because the whole draft is written, it just needs the tender hand of a beta to help me edit it into something you guys can enjoy. On that note I have to thank Lim for stepping up for this chapter.
EDIT (08/01/2020): As I prepare to post the last few chapters of this work I'm coming back to do minor edits.
As they enjoyed something sweet to close the meal Draco was convinced to tell the tale of his own start as an emergency Healer.
“We both know you want this, Potter,” Draco’s voice steady and smooth. “I’m not giving you an easy out. You’ll have to look inside yourself and show me just how much you crave being at my feet. You will have to subject yourself to the abject horror of asking for what you want and reaching for it,” he explained, his eyes never leaving Harry’s, watching the struggle building inside of him, tension mounting and releasing in his body. Draco waited quietly for minutes, while Harry stared longingly at the spot on the floor right in front of the chair. Until the tension broke.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah,” Ron replied, smoothing down the downy tufts of red hair on top of Hugo’s big round head.
“You know how it goes: they’ll pick through the records, interview your patient a little bit, make you sit through a hearing and then let you get back to work. You should be used to it by now, we’ve been doing this dance for almost ten years,” Blaise listed off how the procedure went. There was never anything of substance to it, just the desire to make Draco’s life difficult, and show the public how conscientious they were overseeing the deplorable element in their ranks.
They brought him to Sadistique for the first time when all of his choices had been stripped from him. Draco quickly learned that, whatever happened outside, once he crossed those doors he would find people willing to put the power back into his hands with an open trust he wouldn’t find anywhere else, that he could dole out pain and pleasure and care without having his motives questioned, that he could slip on a mask and be his most honest self for a while.
"I did other things, worse things."
Draco nodded and drew the delicate shapes with practised ease, muscle memory kicking in as he flicked his wand. As Griffith carefully took over sustaining the spell, Draco had a movement of gratitude for Miss Rana taking care of comforting the man—father?—staring at them anxiously from the corner while she spoke with him in hushed tones. At least someone didn't need hand-holding.
“Malfoy, listen to me, he’s actively in danger, you’re giving him potions brewed by the people we’re trying to put away. How long do you think he’s going to last once they find out how much he knows?”
“Have you ever tried saying no to Harry?” Finnigan asked, equal parts amusement and disbelief in his voice.
She was still smiling when they exited the building, and Harry was honestly impressed with how she manoeuvred the department head, how she manoeuvred him and Harry’s anger to pressure the man into granting all the resources they needed.
In case you were interested here is the rest of the music mentioned in this chapter
.” He explained, slowly hovering the plant over Potter’s feet and moving it up gradually, taking note of the changes in its foliage as it picked up on all that he already knew Potter to have been through, when it started giving up the ghost the closer it got to the point of impact of one of the killing curses Draco pulled it away. No point in burning it pointlessly, black walnut saplings like this were rare and valuable.
Harry’s arm wrapped around his thin waist, grabbing at the soft linen of his shirt. He was never going to let him go, he was drunk with the feeling of Draco bending himself to fit perfectly around Harry, the gentle tug of Draco’s fingers in his hair, the planes of his torso under Harry’s hand, the roundness of his shoulders… And his lips… They were as sweet as lassi, and Harry could drink greedily to his heart’s content.
“You do know how to read someone’s mind, don’t you?” Malfoy confirmed.
Remember when back in chapter nine I told you the worst of the angst was over? Apparently I lied.
“Flip over, you’ll be more comfortable.”
“Are you sure?” Dana asked, a little frown on her face. Potter just nodded, looking up at them with a small smile.
"There is no reason to worry, Draco ji, it's my job to make you and the medical team as comfortable as possible. I'm happy to work on Ambassador Granger's mission," she reassured him, and the glint in her dark eyes showed genuine enthusiasm.
"Not much further, Malfoy, don't worry I'm not going to kill you. You were doing a remarkable job of that yourself today," Harry replied, checking the map to make sure they were going in the right direction.
“Why the civvies?” Malfoy finally looked up at him.
Harry grimaced, he’d hoped it would be good news, not another hole in the water.
"You would seriously keep him and send me back?" Harry's voice was dripping with outrage.
I absolutely give up on trying to predict a schedule. Chapters will come as the Lord sends them, trust that the fic is not abandoned and it will get finished, probably not in a timely manner but the goal is to finish this before graduation.
Malfoy and know he was a better man than Harry gave him credit for.
"Here, try it with the mango chutney." Potter dipped a bit of pancake into one of the chutneys and held it out for Draco, looking at him expectantly.
Draco leaned over and carefully wrapped his lips around the bit of dough. It was light and fluffy, the chutney fresh and fruity, with a touch of mint that came through as he chewed thoughtfully. Potter brought his thumb to his mouth to lick a stray drop of chutney, watching him with a hint of anticipation that Draco didn't like. It took a moment for the chilis and cumin to hit and warm up his mouth, cutting through the freshness of the mango. Draco's eyes widened and so did Potter's smile.
"He's been judged by the Wizengamot and he fulfilled every part of his sentencing."
“Yeah, but it’s more fun when there’s another person in front of you,” Harry replied, his amusement clear on his face. For all his complaining, Malfoy was still agreeing to play with him.
"Poddar," Draco repeated, the softer syllables falling easily from his lips. He glanced at the small table between them and the papers where the family tree was growing, each name etched in Draco's tidy calligraphy with blank spaces where Potter's heraldic research had failed him.
"He's already so big," Astoria sighed as she joined Draco under the shade of the big magnolia, away from the gossiping parents and the temptation of crystal bowls filled with lemon drops. She wordlessly handed Draco a flute of Francis Farole colour-changing lemonade and Draco had to appreciate the odd combination of elegant refinement and the taste of kindergarteners. The ancient pretentious champagne fountain filled with soda was the masterful touch that sold it all.
"I know," Harry murmured, and Draco almost believed he could become to deserve that tenderness. "Let's go back to the hotel, see if Hermione wrote back about the mirrors," he proposed after a minute of letting Draco cry into his shirt.
“I did this to you.”
Malfoy glanced up when he heard the girl behind him address Harry and waved his free hand in a placating manner.
“I want to do this” Harry stated, finality in his voice. He finally had a chance to be useful, he wasn’t going to pass on it, whatever the cost.
“We’ll go down the list until we find the hat that fits the head if you know what I mean.” sent the parchment floating over the head of the bed and arranged the tray in a corner.
It was exhilarating to tilt his head back and see he could reach out and take everything he wanted, to see it written on Draco’s face that he only needed to ask, that the reverence Harry saw in his eyes wasn’t misplaced hero worship, it was something more stable, made of sturdier stuff. It was something Harry could lean on and trust it wouldn’t dissolve.
"Why?"
“Those are Mac Gabhann’s capsules, they insulate from ambient magic, we use them to favour some delicate magical interactions.” He explained.
“I suppose Healer Moreschi made the decision for us. You’re dismissed.” He told them.
“Yessir” Harry replied, too excited about finally getting ahead on recovering his arm to pay too much attention to Malfoy’s mothering.
Harry was still high on the best orgasm he had in recent memory, but the erection tenting Draco’s underwear was impossible to miss, and Harry wasn’t going to leave it be. He needed to get his hands on it, he needed to see Draco come undone under him.
“But I still did it!”
“What happened?” Harry asked.
Harry choked on his spit for a moment at the casual offhanded way the man talked about it. “I… ah… what? Maybe?” He managed, pointedly avoiding looking Zabini in the face. He wasn’t sure how he felt about Draco talking about that with his friends.
"Ambassador Granger." Healer Gupta greeted Hermione with a bright smile that Hermione mirrored, bringing her hands to her chest.
Draco was glad to step into the perfectly weather-controlled environment of the hotel. With no disrespect to the embassy's effort to make its rooms liveable, there were too many open windows and stone arches for any Weather-Control Charm to have any significant effect. Draco wasn't made for the humidity; he could already feel his shirt sticking to his back with sweat. Not even months in the rainforest made him get used to it, he much preferred the desert.
"You never failed me, Mother, never. You did everything you could to protect me, went to unimaginable distances to ensure my safety and happiness. I will never forget it and you shouldn't either." He held his mother's eyes, watching her face twist as she tried to fight tears back, even alone she’d still try to keep her front in place.
He walked slowly along the same street he'd taken that first afternoon, carrying around the weight of the day and so much more. The air slowly cooled around him, bringing some relief from the sweat beading his forehead. The Gurdwara was exactly where he remembered it, and the same aching nostalgia squeezed his heart. How he could miss something he never had he couldn't quite explain, but behind those doors there were years of his family's traditions that he was robbed of. He took off his shoes and covered his head before taking a further step inside. He followed the sound of cooking and the steps of other temple goers until he found the kitchen and he could sit down among strangers he could barely share a couple words with and do his part to prepare langar. It didn't take long for people around him to understand he didn't speak Bengali further than
Draco sighed, dropping the pretence “No, I’m not ok. He asked me out,” he told her.
Draco came up behind him and wrapped his arms around his waist, meeting his eyes in the mirror.
“Your allegations aren’t substantial enough to warrant a suspension without pay, and given Healer Malfoy’s transparency and cooperation it would be unreasonable to suspend him at all.” Blaise argued, stepping closer to the table. Draco could feel the axe coming down on him in a very tangible twist in his gut.
