Harry slumps his head and closes his eyes, but soon his shoulders are shaking with quiet laughter. Ron hits him with a pillow in protest.
He managed to compose himself enough to head to the door without falling and glanced back over his shoulder. “You’re not fooling me, Potter. You just want to ogle my arse as I walk out the door.”
"Fine," she sniffed, "but remember, next week is the celebration at Molly and Arthur's. I think they'd be put out if you killed him before then."
Suddenly, there's a sneer painted across Draco's lips and ice in his words. "I suppose you think I'm weak, don't you? A man who can't stand up to his father, even after he's dead. A man who would willingly get on his knees for someone else's pleasure. A man who can't take what is rightfully his because he knows deep down he's not worthy of it."
Malfoy's eyes are wild and frantic and his body is strung taut, even as his limbs flail about in protest. His shouting is reaching a pinnacle, and Harry hears incandescent rage and indignant affront in the bellows. But he also hears something else, something buried deep among the shrillness. Beneath the high-pitched bluster, Harry hears the undercurrent of an emotion that he knows intimately.
Wide gray eyes meet his and Draco's mouth falls open to reply with something snarky, Harry's sure of it, when Narcissa replies from behind the rim of her tea cup. "So is Draco."
This time, Silvestri cut his eyes to Harry as he leaned into Draco's neck, open mouth hovering the marks. "Yes, but you wouldn't listen to me!" he hissed. Draco shivered beneath him, and he chuckled. "Now do I have your attention?"
Potter stepped closer into Draco’s personal space, and his demeanor went from tense to relaxed. “What would I need that for?” he said smoothly. “It’s your job to keep me warm.”
It wasn’t even the promise of the orgasm that was building that had him reeling. This was it. This was
Draco smiled winningly. “Well, then, let’s have it.” He turned the grin on Potter. “You’ve got strong arms, don’t you, Potter?”
Draco's eyelids slam shut and his head jerks to the side. "Why did you have to show up here? Why is this my life?" He opens his eyes and turns a haunted gaze on Harry. "How is this my life now?"
"Correct." Snape's long-fingered hand waved at the pile of cauldrons tucked into one corner. "I suggest you get started."
Harry sighs again. It's probably just as well. A lasting relationship seems to be permanently out of his reach.
Draco stepped back and his hand fell from Potter's startled face, even paler now under the harsh truth of Draco's words. He raised it again, this time to wipe the mess on his shirt, leaving a stain on the rumpled white fabric. His snort of disgust echoed through the living room as he turned on his heel and went upstairs.
He can feel sweat blossoming on Draco's skin, and he can feel Draco's arse cheek warming with the rush of blood at the striking point. He turns his face and scrapes his teeth along the afflicted spot, biting down on the pink right cheek as his left delivers a punishing blow to the other side.
When his breathing evened, he whispered in Draco's ear, "What you do to me, Draco. My God, what you to do me."
Harry turns his head and lets his breath ghost over Draco's ear. The resulting shudder makes Harry smile. "Oh, that's much better." He turns and heads for the door, calling over his shoulder, "Enjoy the rest of your afternoon."
Harry swallowed, unwilling to go down that road. "So what will you do now? Since you're done with NEWTs?"
“Then keep it,” Potter said. “It should be yours.” He turned and went to the box over the mantle, opening it to retrieve something. “Along with this.” Potter faced him and Draco thought his knees might buckle. “Ten inches. Hawthorn. Unicorn hair core. Right?”
"Done?" Snape asked from the portrait, closing his book. He set it on the table and picked up his tea cup, taking a measured sip as his eyes perused Draco's work over the rim.
Draco turned to face the wall, bracing his hands and his forehead on the tiled dragon. He sighed deeply, finally reaching for the relaxation he was due. He straightened, running his hands over his wet face, and slicking the now clean locks of platinum out of his face. Draco turned to reach for the tap, and came almost face to face with Potter.
"What?" Harry leaps from his stool and stalks over to rip Ron's arm off his face. "What the hell were you thinking?"
The thought is simultaneously terrifying and arousing, and the blood rushes to his cock in a painful surge, making sweat break out across his hairline and blurring his vision like he's been knocked in the head by a Thestral. He snorts against Potter's absurdly arrogant declaration, but there's a thrum within him that shaking its head and forcing him to look closer. No, it's not arrogance that Potter's throwing around, it's a deep-rooted confidence. One that bleeds capability. One that's got Draco's cock pulsing to beat the band, eight to the bar, a four on the floor jive of
Granger’s eyes narrowed. “If you will actually give this some thought, you’ll understand how this can be beneficial to you.” He had to applaud her attempt to appeal to his Slytherin side.
After a second, the wards dissolve, and the door to Draco's room flies open with a bang. Draco bolts upright with a hand to his chest.
Maybe Hermione was right, and he should have known, but it doesn't seem to make any sort of difference now. He wants some space to think. He wants to be left alone. He wants peace and quiet. He wants a haven to be himself. He wants—
"No, I'm not saying that, but listen; I grew up hating my aunt and uncle. Until I came to Hogwarts, I didn't really care about anyone. In those few years, I came to love so many people, and lost a lot of them, yes. I didn't have time to develop the kind of relationship that you had with your father. It would have been so much worse for me if I had. I don't love lightly, and I suspect neither do you. I can only imagine your heartbreak at losing him."
Molly’s lips twitched. “That’s exactly what she said.” Her hand dipped beneath the table and reappeared with a small, cream colored envelope. She laid it on the table as she fixed Draco with her gaze. “We both lost sons, your mother and I. And she lost a husband as well. No matter what I think about Lucius Malfoy, she loved him. Deeply, as much as I love my Arthur. His loss was great. She wanted me to give you this upon your release. I have a feeling she had this planned for quite some time.” Molly’s eyes softened as she smiled. “I gained a new respect for your mother in those teatime hours. And for you as well, Draco.” She slid the envelope across the table. “I don’t know what’s in there, but I’m pretty sure I can guess. There’s a large tree in the back left corner of the yard,” Molly gestured with a finger over her shoulder. “Ginny charmed fairy lights on it ages ago, and the damned things don’t ever shut off. I think it would be a good place for you to read that.”
“He’s vampire, Hermione,” Draco cut in. “He’ll always be dangerous. But, I don’t think he quite knows what to do with himself yet. Not with the bond. He’s used to doing whatever the bloody hell he wanted and now he’s got to think of someone else.”
"Look, the pool of friends I have to share this with is painfully shallow. If anybody would understand, it would be you."
Draco’s left arm pressed close into his side, as if the appendage had a mind of its own. “I wish I could say I felt the same.” He turned his wrist upward, presenting it to Potter’s gaze.
Unfinished business lies on the other side of the ornately carved mahogany. Business she's resigned herself to ignore. But stubborn Black blood flows through her veins, proud and defiant, and if she's learned anything from her wayward cousin, it's that unfinished business eats at the soul. Narcissa spares a glance over her shoulder for Neville, sleeping so peacefully between her sheets, and she knows that if they are to have any sort of future together, then some doors must open before they can close.
"His skin is lovely, Harry. Pale and milky," Silvestri sucked in a breath. "Just beautiful. Imagine how gorgeous he would be between us."
"She is," Harry says fondly. "It's a little bittersweet for me. After I lost Hedwig, I never bought another. Couldn't stand to. Hedwig meant too much to me."
Draco rests his hands on the tablecloth as his eyes latch onto the arrangement of flowers in the middle of the table. "You did this for me, didn't you?" he asks, hands clenching into fists. "You asked Cook to make all my favorite things." He swallows hard as his eyes dart to the side. "This is some sort of reward for doing as I'm told, isn't it?"
"I do, you know," he said softly. "Love you, that is." Potter reached into his back pocket and produced a small velvet-covered box. "Which is why I would like for you to come home with me. Permanently."
Draco continued, cutting off the vampire's protest. "Guilt at burying your friends and loved ones. Guilt at watching the survivors try to rebuild their lives. Guilt at having the unmitigated gall to not die. Again." Potter turned his face, and his shoulders slumped on a low breath. "Because you wanted to die."
He tightened his hold on Draco's hair, yanking back harder to lengthen the line of his neck, making it available for the point of his tongue as he slid it across Draco's blood-stained skin. He suckled away the remnants as his ankles pressed against Draco's arse to bring him closer. Harry's hardness met Draco's, and he growled in approval as Draco moaned into the air.
Hermione Granger-Weasley’s gasp caught in her throat as her husband shot up from his chair. “No! There’s got to be another way. We can’t force Harry into this,” Ron growled.
He smirks and chuckles. "I asked if you were alright. You went somewhere for a moment. I admit, seeing Longbottom was a shock for me, I mean, when did he get so fit? But you, you've seen him recently. Or were your thoughts elsewhere?" He says it like he knows what Harry was thinking, and maybe he does.
"What is it, baby?" Harry asks, easing back to drink in the sight of him. "Tell me what you want, Draco."
"No touching yet, baby. Not until I say." The endearment feels fond and sweet on his lips, not the saccharine, infantile appellation it used to be with others.
“Yes, she did. And we had a very cathartic chat. It was a bit awkward at first, what with the lingering feud—”
The bit of praise is like a touch because Draco shifts to sit taller in his chair, and the deep, satisfactory breath he takes mirrors the sudden gleam in his eyes. He's proud of himself.
that had him on the razor’s edge. It was the guillotine and the gallows all rolled into one, and Draco was ready to bare his neck and swing from the rafters to chase it into oblivion.
Draco turned his head toward the door of his cell, the sound of hushed arguing drawing his attention.
Harry takes three good strides until the tip of Ron's wand is embedded in his chest. Ron's eyes go wide and sharp with surprise. "Harry?"
Pansy smiles, warm and gracious, slipping from Draco's grasp to twine her arm with Hermione's. "Of course, Granger. I'm only too happy to discuss my work." She nods at them. "'Night, all. Owl me, Draco."
Harry leans in and savors the moist heat of Draco's breath on his cheek as he says, "I don't want to break you, Draco. I want to set you free."
“I couldn’t sleep. I keep hearing you,” Potter said, shaking his head. “It’s getting louder and louder. It’s all I can hear.” The vampire’s voice was strained beyond measure and his hand crept from Draco’s cheek to cradle his jaw. “You’re everywhere in this house now. I’ll be able to go anywhere and hear you.” The hand tightened. “I don’t want to hear you.”
Neville turns and nods to Draco. "Draco, good to see you." He snags Harry in a one-armed hug as Blinky pops in to show him out. "See you around, Harry."
He should go. Should run for the safety of his own bed, his own nightmares. But instead, he allowed himself to be pulled back. Draco laid his head on the pillow, facing out into the darkness of the room. Potter’s arm snaked over his waist and dragged him back until their bodies aligned. He tensed, and Potter tensed behind him in response. Seconds ticked by and neither moved, until he felt the creep of Potter’s palm sliding up his chest to splay wide open, letting the whole of his hand cover Draco’s heart. It pressed down hard, not moving, as if any minute Potter was going to curl those fingers and rip out the very heart of him. White noise filtered into his brain, and he realized he couldn’t hear his own heartbeat over the sound.
Harry edges him closer to the new door. "What did you think we were going to do? Hold hands and snog on the sofa?"
"That's an interesting way of putting it," she said, rising to her feet. Draco's lips pursed when he realized she was referring to the initial reason he was here at Grimmauld in the first place, rather than her efforts on behalf of himself and Severus and their new potions business.
Neville's eyes are stormy and bright, and he's staring down at her like she's the only thing in the world worth his attention. She opens her mouth to speak, but his hands clamp down on her upper arms, and he slams her against his body as his mouth claims hers in a kiss that whites out her vision.
“Merlin, help me, yes.” Ron’s brow scrunched. “I didn’t even know Mum knew that word. The fact that she does is strangely disturbing to me.” He sighed and waved a hand at Harry. “Anyway, don’t worry about her. She’ll come back in a few days with her tail between her legs and apologize when she needs Mum to do her laundry or something. And I don’t see why she’s making such a fuss. She dating Oliver Wood now, isn’t she? Shouldn’t make a difference to her who you decide to take up with.”
The moment Draco realizes he’s naked, Potter grabs his hips again, leading him to the bed. When he hits the edge, Potter puts a firm hand on his shoulder, pushing him to sit. From there, Draco is treated to the sight of Potter stripping himself with ruthless precision. Potter is gorgeous, but naked Potter is breathtaking. If he thought Potter’s cock was thick when they pressed together before, he is totally thrown by the actual size that is straining toward him. Potter slides his hands underneath to grope Draco’s arse and position him further up the bed.
Draco moves with controlled precision, his eyes on the frame. He doesn't look at Harry until Harry's hand closes around his wrist and pulls him forward into the center of the frame. A ripple dances down Draco's spine on a sharp exhale.
“Well, seeing as how he didn’t kill you, I think you’d be willing to give this a go,” she shot back. “You get to leave here, go back to Grimmauld, or wherever you choose, and neither the Ministry nor the Council can say two whits about it. All other charges against you will be dropped, there will be no parole, no Aurors checking up on you. You will be free to live with your Consort as you choose, provided you stay within the confines of magical and vampire law like every other citizen.”
“Yes,” Draco said, twirling his fork in the air, “but is there anything you miss? Merlin’s beard, I think I would go spare if chocolate no longer appealed to me.”
Eighteen months later, Draco is bopping around Grimmauld’s kitchen in one of Harry’s (he’s only Potter now when Draco’s cross) t-shirts and a pair of well-worn jeans. He’s barefoot, got a kitchen towel slung over one shoulder, and is currently elbows deep in making Harry’s favorite dinner. Harry loves a good spag bol. It’s an ordinary evening, like so many they’ve shared since Draco moved in. No plans for this Friday night except for a nice dinner, a nice bottle of wine, and maybe some classic Who on the telly. In other words, perfect.
He came to a stop, eyeing the stone door with trepidation. Potter was a shadow behind him. "Go on, what are you waiting for?" he asked.
Harry ignores him and starts a mental countdown in his head as he strolls lazily around the room, because it's only a matter of time before Malfoy's temper gets the best of him. Despite Malfoy's earlier urgings of his quelled fire, Harry knows it's bound to make an appearance sooner or later. They will never fail to push each other's buttons.
“She had asked Harry if it was alright if she stopped by,” Molly continued. “When Harry told me, I owled her right away and invited her to tea at the Burrow.” She paused to smile fondly. “Imagine my surprise when she accepted.”
Draco steps forward, chin thrust into the air. "Maybe I know what I need more than you. Maybe I don't really care what it is you want. You don't want to be compared to him, fine. But you're still like every other Dom I've known. Give a man a little control, and he'll take it all. I won't be powerless anymore. If that means I'm alone for the rest of my life, I'll deal with it."
"Do not finish that sentence. You're not here because you want to be. You're here because you've been thinking about him, about me, about yourself, and you don't want to try to figure out what you want. It's messy and confusing, and you wish it would all go away. So you're here. Because you think a rough fuck will clear your head. You think a hard ride will either get Blaise out of your system, or you out of mine. But it won't make things easier. It will only complicate them more. I've never taken a lover against their will, and I'm not going to start tonight. Because I won't have you in my bed and then watch you walk out of here ashamed of what we've done." Harry exhales, long and slow, running a hand over his face. "Letting me fuck you isn't going to fix your issues with Blaise. If that's what you need, then you need to see a Mind Healer. And if you do, I will support you, but we cannot have a physical relationship with his shadow lurking over us. I would rather have you whole as a friend than broken as a lover."
Malfoy's eyes go wide at the sudden proximity, but he recovers and shifts away to pronounce, "These days it's more because I'm all temper and hot air. I think post-war has dampened all my heat, I'm afraid."
The low timbre of Potter’s voice skated over him and suddenly he was assaulted with visions of all the things Potter could do to him in that bedroom. Oddly enough, getting dressed didn’t even make the list. He tried for light, hoping to diffuse his brain’s musings.
Potter's cock filled him, easing the want that had been boiling away underneath his skin. "Harry," he chanted. "Harry, Harry—fuck—Harry!"
As he murmured soft words over his mother's crypt, she stood back, far enough to be respectful, but close enough for Draco to draw strength. In that moment, which part of him still bitterly felt should have been Potter's, Draco felt himself fall under her spell. She was an amazing witch, her intelligence tempered by the generosity of her heart. It was no wonder Weasley and Potter were so enamored of her.
They landed at Grimmauld and Harry instantly pushed Draco back a step, dragging his hands all over Draco's body, interrogating him with rapid-fire questions.
“Merlin, no. I’ll admit, of all people, I wouldn’t have picked the Ferret for you, but Mum’s absolutely nutty over him.” He shrugged. “Doesn’t seem to matter so much anymore, you know,” he raised his fingers to make air quotes, “’Weasley’, ‘Potter’, ‘Malfoy’. We’re sort of all the same now, aren’t we?”
Harry steps back and gives him a thorough perusal. When he finds his voice, he puts every last inch of steel into it.
A wizened, grumpy-looking house elf popped in. “Master Harry is home?” Kreacher let out a gasp as he spied Draco, and then bent in a formal bow. “Greetings to Master Draco Malfoy. Kreacher is being pleased to serve the line of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black in their ancestral home.”
Potter was alive above him, marking patches of skin, dragging his tongue through blood and sweat, licking and teasing as his hands moved to grab at Draco with vise-like pressure. He was caught in the undertow of Potter's desire, his own hands scrabbling for purchase on Potter's body. Draco yelped at a particularly enthusiastic bite, his body shaking and trembling.
And it was Draco’s turn to splutter as Potter’s smile slid across his face when he replied with a cheery, “Yes.”
He looks at Harry as if he's asked the stupidest question on earth. "I've just had the best sex of my life, I'm naked on the sofa with two of the most gorgeous women on the planet, and it all feels right somehow. What do you think I did? I rubbed her damn feet and loved every second of it."
Draco’s eyelashes fluttered and images from the past flickered in his brain. Through the fog, he lamented that this would be how it all ended, with so much left undone between them, and the sad realization that there could have been more. This was Potter’s madness, Potter’s insanity, and if was Potter wanted to damn Draco along with him, he would go, but fuck if he would do it without at least letting Potter know what he was throwing away.
"Excellent. Lessons will begin tomorrow at noon sharp." Snape rose from the chair and craned his head to peer at the curtained-covered windows, paying no attention to his ruffled apprentice. "See that you're properly attired this time."
Suddenly, Bill was shoved unceremoniously to the side and Draco found himself staring face-to-face with the last Weasley he wanted to see. George Weasley glowered down at him. “I suppose you think you can walk in here like nothing’s happened?”
He was right. Potter had taken the risk, knowing that he could have come here and had the door slammed in his face. He took it knowing that his survival for the rest of his life could be in owl-delivered vials. He took it knowing that Draco might say no. Because Draco saying yes was worth the risk. Because Draco was worth the risk.
"But I can be," Potter finished. "And I have to trust you with my life. You should be able to trust me with yours."
"Your owl—she's gorgeous, you know—and Ajax. I think they're—" Potter made a crude gesture with his hand.
"Screw the fucking risk, Harry. There is no risk in refusing to love him because you're afraid to lose him. And that's exactly what you are doing. You'll open your eyes to discover he's gone, and you'll have to live with the knowledge that you could have changed it.
Narcissa sips her tea and dabs at her mouth with her napkin before addressing him. "I trust your quarters are acceptable?"
A pointy finger came stabbing with accusation through the fire. “Did you see his neck? How could you do that and not heal him, for Merlin’s sake?” Indignant fire blazed in her eyes, and Harry swore underneath his breath as that look on her face confirmed the truth. Draco was her new cause.
"I've never seen jeans and flip-flops look so sophisticated," he says. "The t-shirt is a nice touch. Green. How Slytherin."
Potter rolled his eyes. “Yes. It means-” he paused, then sighed. “I’ll get you a phrasebook or something.”
"Alright, alright," Potter said, raising his hand. He shook his head with one last smile before his features grew serious. "After you left, I was a wreck. A total mess. I'm sure Hermione filled you in. Merlin knows she ripped me a new one." Another soft laugh. "And thank you for the owls, by the way. Perfectly timed, and always the perfect temperature. I appreciate you not letting me starve to death because of my own stupidity."
Potter’s hand waved again with a frown and her mouth sealed shut, cutting off the rest of her rant. Walburga fixed Potter with a deadly glare, which he returned. “Hateful cunt,” he snapped, before yanking the curtains closed. “Can’t even be civil when asked.”
Potter threw back his head and laughed. "I think the only reason he came was to make sure Lucius was well and truly dead."
Harry's glance peeks over the book in his hands. Draco's braced his hands on the table and is staring up at the painting on the wall. It's an image of the Manor in winter, coldly regal in all its glory, with the swirl of magical snow dancing about the landscape. Draco's mouth opens and then shuts on a snap. He does it twice more before the words finally come, as icy and frigid as the painting's subject.
Slowly, Draco's fingers unfurl from the table's edge and drift up to undo the buttons of his shirt. It takes what seems like ages before he pulls back the fabric to reveal the thin, whip-like slashes on his chest. Harry's heart slams against his ribcage like a Bludger. His mouth goes dry as he sees Draco, bleeding out on a bathroom floor, and remembered fear clogs in his throat. But there's a chance to change all of that, to reinvent the dynamic of Harry and Draco. One that will be as passionate and powerful, but infinitely more satisfying.
“Terms?” he said, his voice peaking with amused interest. “There was nothing mentioned of terms when the Ministry shoved me into Azkaban to starve to death.”
He grabs his coat. "I appreciate your concern, but honestly, it isn't necessary. I'll figure out something. I just need some space to do that."
Harry closes the distance between them until the scent of citrus and sweat bleeds into his nostrils. He leans over, putting his mouth precariously close to Draco's ear. "All you ever have to do is ask. Remember that,
He waits for Draco to turn and return his smile before loftily shifting his attention to Draco's conversant. Harry doesn't bother to incline his head in greeting.
Snape drew back into the chair and let the professor take over. "When is the last time you saw Potter?"
Ron sits up as Harry plonks down beside him, not shrinking from Harry's disapproving frown. "It's not like that," he starts. "I mean, it's okay, I guess, but—"
When Harry looks back, Narcissa is gliding out of the room, a shy smile fixed upon her upturned lips.
He knew Potter wanted to tell her no, to be left out the conversation entirely, but Draco squeezed lightly on his thigh again, and his breath caught as Potter squeezed back and turned his face to Molly.
The harsh crack of Apparition filled the still air as Harry appeared in the forest. The moon loomed overhead, round and full, casting beams of silvery light through the breaks in the treetops. The silence was oppressive; it seemed the nocturnal creatures knew there were better places to be at the moment. Harry closed his eyes. From off in the distance, he felt it creep closer, slipping under his skin like a sharp knife.
"I'm not perfect either." Draco's hand ghosts over the front of his shirt. "Blaise used to lament the fact that you left your mark on me. It irritated him. He talked about actually branding me before the end."
Harry stares at him as he goes on. Malfoy's worked himself into a proper strop, and he can't string together coherent sentences any longer. The words 'fucking Longbottom', 'Golden Trio', and 'infestation' spout from his lips with all the force of expletives.
Draco is naked in seconds, his clothes neatly folded in a pile on the small table, and Harry has to stop a smile from spreading across his face at Draco's eagerness.
Clothing cast aside, he found he was unable to move as quickly as he wanted, instead captured by the consuming want in Potter's face. The vampire looked him over with scrutiny, stopping when he caught sight of Draco's cock.
Malfoy takes in a deep breath and lets it out with an amused sigh. "Ah, yes, Cook. The house-elf formerly known as 'Tinky'. She insists we call her Cook."
When Draco raised his head, he was surprised to find a twinkle in the Auror’s eye. “That she is, Weasley. You’re a very lucky man.”
“It’s a terrible thing,” Shacklebolt supplied, “this business. And as fond as I am of Harry, and as much I appreciate the sacrifices he made for the Wizarding world, I have to think about the greater good here.”
Harry set down his book and turned to face her. "He did say he was going back to Knockturn before coming over. Something about a supplier getting his order wrong." He smiled, even if he didn't feel like it. "I'm sure he'll be there soon."
Draco stumbles forward once the door shuts behind Potter, bracing himself with one hand on the table. The gasp that escapes him is entirely involuntary. He's panting like he's run from here to Hogwarts and back, double time, with a hippogriff strapped to his back the entire way. He blinks twice, unable to see or think of anything beyond two crystal clear factors. One, Draco can still feel Potter's body heat, hovering over his skin like that first tingle of magic you get when you hold a wand for the first time. Nervous, exciting, and an altogether visceral rush that strangles out all other feeling. And two, Potter said 'when', not 'if'.
Ron shoves him back. "Oi! I've had the good graciousness to apologize for my idiocy where your love life is concerned, and even gone so far as to, as much as it galls me,
The second the soles of Draco’s shoes hit Grimmauld’s hardwoods, Potter is on him like a crup just let off the lead. The kiss isn’t frantic, but it is frenetic in its focused intensity. Potter is a man on a mission, intent on claiming his mouth, and Draco is helpless to stop him. Neither does he want to. Strong hands grab Draco’s hips, fingers splayed wide to control his movement. Potter surges forward with purpose, licking hotly into Draco’s mouth, all the while steering him backward. Draco goes without hesitation.
The blankness is back on Malfoy's face, but Harry thinks that there's possibly a hint of disbelief lurking underneath the mask, like he's not sure if Harry's mental or not.
“We don’t stand on ceremony at the Burrow, Draco. It’s Arthur to you.” He fought back the urge to gape at the overt friendliness. Was it possible that the age-old feud had withered and died along with Lucius Malfoy and his prejudices?
The tongue and finger vanished, only for touch to reappear a second later, and Potter was sliding two lubed fingers in their place. The burn was inconsequential, falling into line with the rest of the bittersweet twinges Potter had showered him with thus far. Potter stroked inside of him with a slow reverence, taking his time, dragging his fingers back and forth the awakened tissue.
"Comfortable?" Ron snorts. "The woman was laid out between us on the sofa like a damned buffet table. Like the spot was hers all along." He closes his eyes and blows out a soft breath. "Maybe it is."
He heard Potter's footsteps retreat and slid down the side of the sarcophagus to the floor. Tears welled from a spring he thought long dry and he whispered into the air.
Relief bled from the line of Potter's shoulders to his scuffed trainers. "Draco," he said, breathless.
Her exclamation cuts off as Harry hears from the hallway, "Harry! Harry! Where the hell are you, mate?" Seconds after Ron's booming shout, he tumbles into the room. Before Harry can utter a word, Ron's got his wand out, trained on Draco, whose eyebrows shoot into his hairline. "Stand back, Malfoy!" Ron shouts. "Just get away from him!"
The door isn't shut for two seconds and Draco's scrambling to get into the bathroom, tripping over his own feet in haste to chuck off his pajama pants. It doesn't even register; his body is moving of its own volition, propelled forward at Harry's words as if disobedience isn't even an option. It's unthinkable.
Harry scrutinizes every patch of revealed skin, his eyes raking over the taut planes of Draco's chest and torso, marveling in the pale alabaster of his skin. The Dark Mark stands out, but Harry's eyes glance right over it, choosing instead to focus on the long column of Draco's graceful neck. Trousers are unbuckled without ceremony, and they come off in a swish of fabric. He's not wearing anything underneath, and Harry is presented with Draco in all his glory. He watches as the trousers are shaken out and folded. Draco's movements are precise and methodical, and Harry thinks he could watch Draco like this for hours.
Potter was on him with the flash of fangs and a curdled smile, digging into the juncture of where neck met shoulder. Draco hissed with pain as the vampire bit down with crushing force. His knees locked to keep from collapsing and his eyes slammed shut as he fought to stay upright. He railed against the suffocating sensation, and the scent of his own blood hit his nostrils. Potter’s hands clamped down on his hips to brace him against the shower wall and hold him in place. It was sharp and caustic, and Draco didn’t think he would ever catch his breath again when the bite shifted to a suck.
"Don't let it close you off. Don't let one bad apple put you off fruit entirely." Renault smiles with cheek. "The world is your orchard, Draco Malfoy. And I know how much you love apples."
"But you want to," Ron says, scrutinizing him with a squint. "I knew he was always a poncy git, but I didn't think he was, you know,
Potter shifted restlessly on top of him, and Draco felt Potter’s cock stir against his own. He pushed aside his growing desire in favor of Potter’s comfort, Potter’s need. His hand slid down Potter’s back and beneath the waistband of his sleep pants to run his hand over the curve of Potter’s muscled, bare arse. The gesture was welcomed with the teasing lick of Potter’s tongue on his neck and Draco bit his lip to keep from crying out. He played there for a few moments, relishing the texture of Potter’s bare skin, and the hard muscle beneath it, squeezing as if his palm could commit the feel to memory.
Her twinkly eyes widen with apprehension, but she nods furiously and pops back out again. There's a second or two lapse when Cook appears in the dining room with a loud, grating pop. All eyes turn to her, but hers are firmly fixed on Harry, glaring daggers. Harry simply smiles at her, rises from his seat, and begins to applaud. The rest of the guests at the table soon join in, and a smattering of happy applause rings out through the room.
He should protest, he thinks, but he doesn't, because even on his back, Draco is giving him the control. Draco's hands wind around his and shove them in his hair, urging him to grasp and pull at the short, sweaty strands. Draco's mouth is a hot, wet vise, and he's sucking at Harry's cock like it's the only vocation he's ever known. It's fast and frantic, nothing but tight, slick heat and perfect pressure. Draco's swallowing his cock, choking himself on it, curling his fingers into Harry's thighs in contented bliss. His tongue curls along the shaft on the upstroke, and his throat ripples on the down, making Harry shout Draco's name in rapture.
He turns, and her hand falls away. She can feel the heat in her cheeks, and she knows she must be flushed. They're so close, almost touching, and if he takes a deep breath, they will collide. Her head tilts back automatically in order to look properly at his face.
There's something rattling around the cavern of his belly, and when it seeps out into his bones to take root, recognition dawns. It's the hollow echo of the house-elf's words.
"You can't be serious, Mother!" Draco seethes next to her. His eyes are narrowed in contempt, his knuckles white from the clenched fists he has resting on the table. "The head of house always—"
If there is one thing in this world that Draco Malfoy is absolutely perfect at, it's this: the waiting position. Platinum head hung low, showing off the slope of an elegant neck. Bared in submission. Upturned palms resting on pale thighs that quiver under Harry's gaze. Back curving so beautifully in the sweeping arc of quiet supplication.
He rankled at Potter’s statement, and wanted to snark back that he was much more than a possession, but the twinkle in Potter’s eye made it impossible to tell if he was teasing or being serious.
He braces against the sudden feeling of being swallowed, of being dragged out to sea without an anchor. Of the reality of being alive, and why.
His eyes focused on her neck again. “You should be.” He swallowed hard, and for a second, something like regret flickered in his eyes. But a warning hunger took its place and he rasped, “You need to leave.”
Potter bit at his lips, nipping the swollen flesh, as he pulled harder, pressing them ever closer until every point of contact was a harsh drag of sweat-dampened skin. It was all rub and fire and possession and Draco cried out with a whimper as Potter's fingers tightened painfully on his hips. They ground together, the coarse hairs on Potter's legs and groin skating across his skin with a sandpapery rasp. Potter kissed down the side of his neck, never loosening his grip, until lips and teeth rested over his heart.
He's still enough when Harry buckles his ankles into the restraints, but the faint clink of the chain makes Draco's breath catch. Harry lets his fingers linger on the divot behind the joint, stroking softly to ground him. He wants to bend down and kiss him right there, run his tongue along that indented patch of skin, and find out if that will make Draco shiver.
She shuffled over to the small table he was allowed in the cell and sat down, plunking the satchel on the floor. Her brown hair tumbled over a face that had grown into the picture of womanly beauty as she bent over and retrieved a rolled parchment and quill. She placed them on the table and made a silent motion with her hand for him to come and sit. When he didn’t move, she let out a soft sigh and gestured again.
What's even more noticeable is the fine sheen of sweat glistening on Neville's brow and arms as he works diligently in the flowerbeds. His jeans are covered in light layer of soil, especially the backs of his thighs where he's absently been wiping his gloves every so often. She's trying not stare at the tight stretch of denim across his lower half, but between the heat and his position on the ground, his clothes are stuck to him like a second skin. It's a shocking revelation, but the man has a truly spectacular arse.
Harry shakes his head. "So, you're saying that you had fabulous, and I'm assuming it was fabulous, sex with two women, everybody left happy, and there was no weirdness at all? Is that what you're saying?"
They reach the greenhouse and shut themselves inside, and Neville kicks the dusting of snow from his boots. He takes off the heavy overcoat and drapes over the high-backed bench, digging his gloves and a small leather pack from one of its pockets.
Gone over the too-large charcoal grey t-shirt that matches the depth of color in Draco's eyes. Gone over the way said shirt gapes enticingly over the hollow of his collarbones. Gone over the way those jeans sling low on his hips and drag the floor at his heels. Gone over the sparkle in his eyes and the patch of color on his cheeks, and the way that even clean and damp around the edges, Draco looks bright and fresh, and Merlin's balls…shagged. Gone like he's been pulled into another dimension, another universe where Draco is the center, shining radiant and beautiful like the sun and Harry has no choice but to orbit his presence. To do nothing but draw life from his light.
"Very good," he says, raking his eyes over Draco's pale form. His cock is hard, jutting out from his body, and his eyes sparkle in the light. He's trembling slightly, but he's making a concerted effort to keep himself under control.
Harry raced up the stairs, threw on some jeans and his trainers, mind reeling with all the possibilities as to what could have happened and where Draco might be now. He straightened, ready to Apparate, when the wards tingled in a familiar, sinister way. Rage exploded in Harry's body and a growl left his lips. No, now he knew exactly what had happened to Draco.
Harry shrugs. "I just don't understand why you've not taken things over from your father. It's your birthright, isn't it? This is your proper place in the grand scheme, right?"
"And Draco?" He leaned on the chair for support, trying to curtail the desire to reach through the portrait and throttle Potter.
He thought it should be a testament to Molly’s character that she phrased her words so carefully. Merlin knew there were many others, including most of the Azkaban guard, who took great pleasure in reminding him that Narcissa Malfoy had killed herself.
Three weeks later, his stomach was still in the same queasy condition, with his days filled with the sharp tongue of Snape's instruction, and his nights strangely bereft of Potter's company. He came to feed, but no more was said about the passionate encounter they had shared. It was like it never even happened. Potter never came closer than he had to, never lingered, and never spoke except to murmur soft thanks. With the workload of studying Snape had piled on him, he hadn't really stopped to think about the persistent emotion in his gut. As he poured the liquid into the potions vial, it hit him. He
In the meantime, he's busied himself with rearranging the studio. He's sent Blinky to Grimmauld more than once to retrieve some of his favored supplies and a few personal belongings, and also to reassure Kreacher that he's fine.
Draco was stiff in his arms, not melting into the bite like he normally did. It was a drastic change, one he knew was a harbinger for things to come. If he were a different man, he might have cared. But all Harry's body knew was
Draco smiled. "I think he knew this was on the horizon. Basically told me to get lost. I assume he's here for a reason?"
Draco lifted his chin. "So fucking what? You've had the ability to make a choice all along. You're an insult to those of us who didn't. You want to die? Fine. Do it. You want to live?" Draco bared his neck and jerked Potter to him. "Then do it. I've made my decision. You need to make yours."
"What?" Draco stares up at him, mouth agape. Harry's brows knit together on his forehead, and Draco awkwardly scrambles to his feet. "Wh—why?"
"He's right, Ron," Hermione says, although her tone implies an unspoken 'you should have known' somewhere beneath the words. Her eyes are crinkled at the corners, always indicative of displeasure. She's crinkly at him more often than not these days, and frankly, Harry's stopped trying to figure out what he's done wrong. He thinks wrestling a greased Kneazle into a post box would give him less trouble.
He was so caught up in the feeling around him, so different than magic, so much darker and ever more promising. Draco's almost didn't recognize Potter's features as they shifted, the skin smoothing out over the planes of his face, blossoming with an inner light that made him seem to glow from within. He lost all sense of space and time as Potter moaned softly into the air between them. It was hypnotic and unavoidable, and he found himself pressed into Potter's body. The vampire's erection was hard between them, cradled in the juncture of Draco's hips as his body welcomed Potter's. The soft gasp that escaped him must have sounded like consent, because the moment it left his lips, Potter invaded.
"Are you familiar with aftercare?" he asks, somehow already knowing the answer. Merlin help him if he ever gets his hands on Zabini.
George’s fists clenched by his side, and Draco swore he heard Potter growl from his right. But he spared no glance, keeping his attention on George.
There are at least a hundred different reasons he should say no. First and foremost is Malfoy. Their history is nothing short of volatile, and he knows it would probably please Malfoy to end if they ended up hexing each other at every turn. But second—is Malfoy. Barefoot and ruffled, with a sneer that seems to wax and wane like the tide, and it's so intriguing that Harry wants to know more. He wants to know about Switzerland, wants to know why he's wearing worn trousers and gets huffy over an enthusiastic house-elf. Wants to know if it's his magic's own doing or this old edifice of stalwart pureblood supremacy that's brought him here. Beyond that, there are so many other reasons to say no, but so many questions that he can have answered.
Draco stood at the bottom of the stairs, getting his first glimpse of Potter in three long months. He was unsure of what to expect, but one thing was certain: Potter looked
"You can't!" Potter spluttered, suddenly finding the energy to move. He reached out with grasping hands. "No, Draco, you can't—"
It’s a sensory onslaught of the first order, every single one of them suffocated underneath the sheer sexual energy Potter exudes. Something stops their backwards trajectory, and Potter’s hands slide up to Draco’s back to cushion him from the abrupt stop. Potter now has more leverage to press his muscled frame against Draco’s body, getting as close their clothes will allow. He doesn’t know what he’s been backed into—a wall, a door, a fuck-all piece of antique furniture—but it’s flat and vertical and gives Draco enough support to buck his hips into Potter’s. There’s a hard ridge of an erection that matches his own.
"And now you've put me off my breakfast, you git." Draco pushes his plate back and sighs again. "Are you determined to disturb me today?"
Potter glowered and waved him off as Hermione drew him into the small living area. She closed the door behind her and motioned for Draco to sit beside her on the sofa.
"Very good, Draco." Harry's lips press along the shell of Draco's ear, not a proper kiss, just a brushing of flesh of flesh. Draco's still not ready for kissing. Harry hums softly against the appendage in approval, peeking down to see what effect he's having.
Dead ahead, he sees a pair of lovely bare feet sticking out from beneath black trousers with a fraying hem. He's never used 'lovely' to describe feet before, but these warrant it. Long, slim, with perfectly formed toes, graceful, high arches, and the hint of shapely ankles. His eyes travel further upward to take in the point of a wand, pointed directly at his face. From the wand his gaze settles firmly on the flushed and startled face of Draco Malfoy.
"What?" Draco head swivels and Harry watches as Narcissa's hand glides over Neville's shoulder in a particularly familiar gesture. Draco groans. "Does everybody see it on the first go round?"
"What aren't you telling me?" He stepped closer to the Floo, the acrid scent of her fear drawing him closer. "What don't I know?"
In this light, in this space, Draco is everything Harry has ever hoped for. Everything Harry has dreamed of. It's almost too good to be true, and despite the vehemence of his desire, there is a tiny, niggling part of him that thinks it is.
Potter’s eyes glittered in the darkness, his lips ruby red and slick. His chest rose and fell in a stuttered rhythm. “I think I can.”
Draco looks him in the eye and though he trembles, his gaze never wavers. "I want this. I want—you. I'm just afraid I don't know how to do it. I know in my heart that Blaise treated me terribly, but there's a tiny part of me that doesn't still wonder if the fault lies with me. If I was better, or more suited to—" his mouth works around the word like it's a marble in his mouth, "submission."
Harry sighs and shakes his head. "Back a fortnight, and that's the best you can come up with? I must say I'm a little disappointed. I always thought you Slytherins were masters of the insult. Draco does better cursing out the garden gnomes."
Draco recoiled as if slapped, jerking his hand from Potter. The admission stung, far more than he wanted to admit to himself, but he took a deep breath and forced down the unwanted emotion. He laid cool eyes on Potter and said smoothly, “It’s the bond, that’s all. You’ll just have to get used to it. We both will. Now,” he went on, raising his right arm again, “first bite validates the contract. Do it and we can go.”
"In all fairness, Ron did a great deal of the strategizing, as it were. I was really just the hired muscle."
Harry is seething on the inside, but takes great care to measure his words. They come out slowly, with a gravity that seems to press Draco into the floor. "Let's get one thing straight right now. I am not Blaise. I will never strike you out of anger.
Potter's smile emerged. "I did all the heavy lifting, and Hermione and Minerva consulted. And there was one other person that I couldn't have done without." Potter's eyes moved past Draco to the portrait. "You can come out now," he called.
God, the small talk was going to kill him. Again. So perhaps the best option was to leave it behind altogether.
Draco says nothing, merely lets his gaze linger on the comforts of Harry's room, taking in the low lights and fire crackling in the hearth. His eyes skim over the bed and then return to it, falling there for a second or two before his head swivels around to look at Harry and subject him to the same gentle scrutiny.
Draco shared in Potter's laughter. "I think you're probably right." He relaxed and searched Potter's eyes with his own. "Thank you. For going with her. And for being there for her as well."
She plucks at the soft cotton. "It's comfortable," she insists. "Perfect for a morning getting dirty."
She jerked back as Harry’s fist hit the table. “What life is this?” he hissed. “You can’t imagine what this hell has been like for me!”
“Potter said you wanted to talk to me?” he asked lightly, perching on the edge of the sofa to face her, making a show of arranging himself with his back to Potter. If Potter wanted to sulk, he would happily oblige, but he didn’t have to see it.
"Well," Draco huffs out slowly as Blinky appears with his breakfast, "a dinner party. She must be feeling good. There haven't been people here in ages." He takes a delicate bite of bacon and Harry is mesmerized by the action. Draco chews carefully and furrows his brows in thought. Swallowing, he says, "At least not since I left for Switzerland."
Harry reels back at the vehemence that rolls off Draco. His hands are clenched around the edge of the table so hard, they've gone white, and Draco's shoulders are trembling under the force. He's holding back so much, trying so hard to keep his cool, and losing it slowly by precious seconds. He lashes out to ease the growing pressure within, keeping himself at a set simmer in order to prevent the whole pot from boiling over.
She shifts in her seat, raising her chin slightly, and Harry knows he's probably offended her six ways from Sunday, but what she's implying seems so out of touch with reality that he can't even wrap his head around it.
"Don't be so closed-minded. Wondrous things could be in store for us all. And I'm not just talking about the sex." Silvestri glanced at Draco again, who was panting softly against him. "Bloody hell," he rasped, "how do you not have your cock in him all the fucking time?" The vampire pulled Draco closer for emphasis. "I could spend centuries buried in his arse, I bet."
He looked down to see Potter's half-hard cock hanging out of his jeans, dribbling into a pearlescent pool on the floor. Potter had come untouched with Draco's cock in his mouth, and not a drop of blood between them.
Silvestri's eyes were wide and terror-stricken, and high-pitched keening noises erupted from his throat.
Draco's hands fidgeted against the old wallpaper, before coming up to tangle in the glorious nest of Potter's hair. At the clench of his fingers in the silky strands, Potter moaned again, a low-pitched rumble that shook them both.
Harry leans in, letting his body weight come down on the hand around Draco's throat, forcing gray eyes to meet him own. Draco will give in. Draco needs to trust.
Harry pulls back, panting, and presses his forehead to Draco's in an effort to get his breathing evened out. His chest feels like a bellows, and the rapid rise and fall won't do at all. Draco's set him on fire—it's never been this way with anyone, ever—and Harry needs to get himself under control. Especially if they're going to play like Draco wants.
Granger’s face was warm and pleased as she took Draco’s hands and pressed a small kiss to his cheek. “Draco, you’re here.”
Harry captures Draco's lips and kisses him with fierce abandon. He pulls back with a smack of wet lips and grins. "That's because it doesn't."
"Muggle one," Potter affirmed. "Well, she's a squib, actually, but takes on the odd wizard or so. I needed someone who would look past two major things—Boy-Who-Lived, and these," he said, pointing at his fangs. "Dr. Marbury has been wonderful. She has a working knowledge of wizarding society, and couples her therapy with Muggle technique."
"Didn't he? Considering we had discussed every single aspect of this venture, I should think chucking you along for the ride would have come up at some point." Draco's irritation burned through him in waves, dredging up all his resentment and anger in one fell swoop.
Draco blinks furiously in an attempt to gather his words. "Wait, you're telling me that the Manor just gave you another room? What's wrong with this one?" He's trying hard not to look affronted, and the bit of fluster on him has Harry's eyes darkening with arousal. Draco is gorgeous when he's expressive.
Harry wants to smile at the infantile indignation, but decides instead to play it straight. After all, that's what he wants. For Draco to understand that this isn't a game, it's simply who he is.
"Tough, because I'm going to tell you anyway." If Potter looked the tiniest bit put out at that, all the better. "Idiots, the both of you." Potter snorted in response. "I've had my fair share stumble through my classroom over the years, but you and Draco have taken blatant idiocy and raised it to an art form."
A sly smile worked across her face as Hermione tilted her head. "Well…it's not just your new business endeavor we're celebrating."
at her with the most indignant of hisses. He pushes back from the table with a jerk and throws his napkin into his plate with a huff. "If you'll excuse me, I'm expecting a firecall from Switzerland this morning. A business associate is sending over some contracts that need to be signed. I'll be busy well into the evening, so don't bother calling me for dinner." He glares at his mother once more before turning to Harry and inclining his head. "Harry."
“I know,” Ron said quietly. “And I would have let you. And with my last breath, I would have forgiven you.”
The pleading is almost enough to break Harry's control, and his hands itch at his sides because he wants to reach for Draco.
He tasted of iron and darkness and of all things dangerous in this world. The kiss was little more than a mutual tasting of one another, and Potter licked through his mouth as if it would be last time. Draco’s cock surged against them, heavy and swollen with want. Potter pulled back and dropped to his knees, still keeping his fingers at their punishing rhythm.
His lips curled higher into a grin and he replied with mock seriousness, “Mother would never forgive me if I neglected to bring a hostess gift, and since Potter refused to wear the bow, I’m afraid the Ogden’s will have to do.”
Harry inhales deeply, trying hard not to look like a puffed-up peacock, but honestly, there's so much pride and confidence rushing through him he thinks he might burst. He knows what he looks like, black trousers and bare feet, a tailored blue shirt with the cuffs rolled up to the elbow. Elegant, but at ease, as if there's nothing in the world that can trouble him at this moment. And frankly, unless another Dark Lord suddenly rises to power in the next twenty minutes, there isn't. Even then, Harry thinks as Draco's tongue darts out to moisten his lips, it's iffy.
Potter’s throat closed and rippled around him, and his tongue circled the length of his cock, while those agile fingers pressed up and up and up, going after that one spot that hurled him over the precipice. Draco groaned as he came, his body pulsing in waves down that silken vise, shivering while stars danced behind his eyes.
The fairy lights winked in the moonlight, illuminating the trunk of the large tree with just enough light to read by. Draco raised the envelope, taking a good look at the wax seal again before letting his fingers brush lightly across the surface. Inside were his mother’s last words. Her last thoughts. He wasn’t certain of what he would find, and part of him almost stuffed it into his trousers to be forgotten. But there was no way he could deny her, not now, not after having lost her. He pressed back against the tree trunk and flicked his fingernail under the wax to break the seal. As he lifted the letter from the envelope, the faint, mingled scents of rose and night-blooming jasmine nearly brought him to his knees.
Gilles is a free-spirited artist, which should have been Draco’s first clue at the outset that this wouldn’t last, but the man sucks cock so well Draco was two months in before he realized it. After that, the haze of fabulous sex tended to gloss over the rough edges. And now Draco’s bored with all of it, because although the pretty Frenchman’s oral skills are off the charts, he is, at his core, a total pillow princess.
Snape's eyes widened at Draco's house-elf affect. "Is that what you think? You're little more that Potter's house-elf?"
Ron huffs into his Firewhiskey. "And what about Owen, eh? It's his bloody fault you're in this mess to begin with."
He has to press, not because he's cruel, but because he has to be clear. Harry taps the handle over Draco's hole. "Is this a soft limit, or hard?"
Draco wanted to retort, but the words were stuck in his throat. Potter was infuriating. He wanted, but he didn't want. He was kind, but he was cruel. It was a maddening see saw from one extreme to the other, and it made Draco dizzy just to look at him.
"Where is Draco?" he demands. "Where is my son?" His tone is imperious. Even in death, he never fails to make her remember where she stands in his esteem.
Then there's the Manor, pushing Harry into a place he, quite honestly, is more entitled to than Draco. And he thinks that maybe the Manor didn't bring Harry here for Harry's sake. Maybe the Manor brought Harry here for his own.
“Blimey, mate,” Ron said after a moment. He sat back and blew out a breath. “Are you sure? I mean, just…okay, then.”
It was hard to imagine his mother ever consenting to visit the Burrow, much less sit down with Molly Weasley for tea. But he remembered the drawn look on her face at the trials, and the defeat in her eyes when he and his father had been sentenced. Their lives had changed so drastically by the end of the war, and things once found abhorrent didn’t seem so terrible anymore. It was easy to forget that once upon a time he would have rather died than be under Potter’s thumb. If he could swallow his pride and bare his neck for Potter, surely his mother made time for tea.
He bucked, and Potter stilled to open even wider. The vampire's hands traveled from Draco's hips, sliding across his skin to grab at his arse and jerk him forward. Draco snorted roughly through his nose and stared down at Potter. He was deliciously debauched, lips swollen, mouth wet and red, stretched around the length of his erection. Eyes high and bright, blown wide with arousal. Hard, leaking cock straining out into the air, thighs trembling, looking every inch like someone who could take Draco apart.
Harry nods. "Yes, I think so." He thinks back on it, and shakes his head more rapidly. "Yes, that's it, I'm sure. 'Sanctuary'."
Harry drew a finger alongside Draco's neck, unsurprised when Draco's head tilted to allow him access. His skin brushed over Draco's, stopping to press lightly at the marks on his neck. Draco hissed through clenched teeth, his restraint obvious by his hesitant swallow. Harry felt the blood underneath the surface, swirling under his fingertip, calling in a way he could not resist.
He glares in response. "That's not fair. There were several years of my life where Harry Potter didn't play a starring role, thank you very much."
Tense seconds hung in the air like weighted raindrops, waiting to fall, ready to either nourish life or snuff it out in a deluge. He snatched the quill and parchment, signing his name with a flourish. The resulting magic swirled around them before settling across Harry.
"This is being much more cozy for the family," she says, putting down a full English in front of him. Blinky fusses with his napkin, and pats at him with a cheery grin. "Will Master Harry be taking tea or coffee?"
He lets go of the frame and crawls around on all fours to Draco's front. His eyes flick upward to find Draco staring down at him. His pupils are blown wide with desire, face flushed from his cheeks down to his chest. Sweat drips down between the defined cut of his torso to pool and drip from the hollow of his navel. His cock is dark and red, rock hard and leaking. He seems a little surprised to see Harry on his hands and knees in front of him, as if it is the one place he can't ever imagine Harry deigning to be.
Harry shifted on his feet, suddenly interested in the curve of Draco's jaw as it set into a hard line. He wanted to run his tongue along the length, to taste the traces of his aftershave, linger on the salt of his skin. He wanted—Harry gave a mental shake and ran an unsteady hand through his hair. "This is awkward."
Harry's mind flashed back to a naked, flushed Draco, fluid limbs and arched back. Heavy-lidded grey eyes and kisses that could bring Harry to his knees. Wanton and writhing beneath him, with Harry's name gasped from his lips like a prayer. He swallowed hard, but the image stuck in his throat.
"This look suits you," he says. "With your hair unbound, relaxed in comfortable clothing. You look like you belong here, among living things, things that will blossom and grow. Not inside that huge old house, persisting like a museum piece."
"You know I've never been a fan of your father's, but I can't imagine he was right about everything. He made his fair share of poor decisions. I don't think he could really fault you for that."
Potter's face curdled, still heavy with remorse. Draco knew there were a multitude of pleas waiting inside that fanged mouth, but he was in no mood to let them be heard. His ire was far too great. Perhaps in days to come, it might cool, might abate enough to where his heart would entertain the possibility of accepting Potter's mea culpa, but certainly not now. Not while his heart beat with so much anger.
Draco stopped at the foot the stairs and looked back at her. “It was lovely to see you again, Hermione. I look forward to tomorrow. Please thank Mrs. Weasley for her gracious invitation.”
Bolted to the table in the middle at a slight slant are two rounded, metal handles. Innocent enough, but Harry can already imagine what Draco will look like draped over the top, hands wrapped around those handles, begging for his Master.
"I know, and it ended up sending you to Switzerland. And I think we can both agree that was a mistake."
"Enough." He doesn't need to shout over Malfoy, because the moment his mouth opened, Malfoy's eyes latched onto his face.
The vampire's face bore little expression but at the question, the flicker of light in his eyes snuffed out, and something shuttered closed in the emerald depths. "Doesn't matter. I can't have what I want."
He turned his face, not wanting her to see his internal conflict made external by the shame he could feel coloring his cheeks. “I’ll see you tomorrow, then. Goodnight, ‘Mione.”
Potter’s face tensed and a myriad of conflicting emotions danced in his eyes. An unmistakable yearning coupled with anger and regret. In that moment, Draco felt for Potter. And he knew that no matter how much of a bastard Lucius Malfoy had been, he would have given anything for an embrace and declaration of affection like that. Potter pulled back.
It's not his personal concoction; this is a brand used in all the guest rooms, specially imported from Wizarding France. Draco prefers citrusy scents, sometimes lavender, but this one is fresh and green, with a hint of juniper and an undercurrent of peppercorn. It smells like Harry.
Harry can feel the muscles in his face tense, and the unconscious clench of his teeth tell him he's close to saying something he'll regret. He takes a deep breath and slides out of the booth to stare them both down.
The ease melted from Ron’s body as he sat forward to look Harry in the eye. “We’ve talked about this. I don’t hold it against you. I won’t. Not ever.”
Draco stiffens, not in fear, but because Harry thinks if he didn't, he'd collapse to the floor in a puddle. He makes another mental tick in head beside 'bondage'. Yes, praise definitely won't be a problem.
The vampire moaned, throwing his head back in rapture. "Fuck, you're so tight. So perfect. So perfect for me."
“Touch your collar again and I will rip those fangs out of your face and owl them to Granger as a parting gift.” Potter’s hand dropped to his side.
"So you're saying this is my fault?" Her voice sounds defensive and petulant, and she mentally chastises herself for letting it show.
“Stop fidgeting! And for Merlin’s sake, fix your tie!” Draco hissed. “It’s bad enough I have to face these people, who have every right to AK me where I stand, but I will be damned if I have to do it with you looking like you’ve been trampled by a herd of wild hippogriffs!”
It should have still been creepy, but the answering flush at knowing that Potter noticed he was naked and stuck around anyway was sort of hot. And that was confusing and strange in a way he didn’t want to think about, certainly not after the vigorous shower escapade from last night. Parts of him were still happily sore. Draco frowned and stabbed at the door. “Out, Potter. Your friend is waiting.”
A/N: I know this is a really short chapter. But a lot's about to happen, and I needed some logical breaking points, or this collection of scenes would go on forever. Thanks for your patience!
Pansy Parkinson is a devastatingly beautiful woman. She's grown from the pinched, pug-faced girl of Harry's past and morphed into a bold, confidant woman. Her hair is still severe, but the few years that have passed have made the black bob chic instead of over-styled. She's all dark eyes, red lips, and steely resolve, yet there's a warmth underneath that graces her edges. Her nails are polished, lacquered to a blood-red shine, and her hands curl around a tall flute of sparkling pumpkin juice. There's a tremor just at her fingertips that is reflected in the minute quiver of a perfectly-shaped upper lip.
Draco collapses to the floor as the sob pierces the air. The seal is broken, and his anguish comes pouring out, even as the pleasure keeps spiraling in his blood. He cries and screams, tears pouring from his eyes, choking on his own spit. Snot drips from his nose, and he's hot and shamed and terrified and aroused all at once.
The intimation is not lost on Draco, and his voice drops to almost a whisper. "Intimate? Like a playroom?"
“Where is Percy?” Potter added. Bill shook his head. “Percy doesn’t come to Sunday supper. Charlie’s still in Romania. He doesn’t get home much, but when he does, you can count on him at the table.”
Ron goes quiet, watching Harry with focused intent. His Auror face. He's calculating, deducing. Coming to a conclusion.
Harry's voice is firm. "We will have no boundaries. We will go where you have never been before. And then we will go farther. We will be
Draco stopped short and turned to face him. "When? I mean, I know you've been inside the Manor, but the rest of the grounds?"
That admission hit him like a Bludger to the chest and Draco rolled, setting his feet on the floor and placing his head in his hands. It was a dream he knew well, after all, he’d had it often enough over the years. Somehow he didn’t think it meant the same thing to Potter. “You should sleep. I’ll let you rest in peace,” he murmured from between his fingers.
Draco rolls his eyes with exaggerated zeal and huffs, "Spoken like a true Dom. And I'm assuming you are, if the
The stony expression anchored on Cook's face crumbles bit by bit, until her ears droop and her eyes are wide and liquid. Her bottom lip quivers and she bursts into tears. Her little hands ball into fists at her side and she shouts, "Blinky is being serving coffee now!" Her foot stamps once and she disappears with another loud pop.
The small, tinkling noise gains his attention, and he glances up to see Draco's hands wrapped around the frame in a white-knuckled grip. He's trembling, trying so hard to keep still that the chain is rattling against the metal. Harry soothes with a shush and a lick to the top of his spine. He starts there and begins to work lower, licking his way down, branching out to bite at the sides of his torso every now and then. The random stings make Draco jerk in response, but Harry slides his tongue over the marks, sucking sharply for no other purpose than to hear Draco's cries. His back is littered with bright red splotches, some more purple than red, and Harry's cock hardens at the thought of seeing those marks on Draco tomorrow.
Harry stands up with a sigh and a smile. It seems so simple, brunch with Narcissa and Draco. Like it's an everyday occurrence. What if it was? He pauses for a moment, positive the thought will elicit a reaction from the Manor.
Harry went cold, and he couldn’t help the low growl to his voice at the insinuation in Ron’s words. “What do you mean?”
"I always have time for you, Draco." It comes out far lower than he intended, and Draco's eyes dilate at the silky undertone.
"But I can guarantee that Draco will," Harry replies. "He'll have no compunction about telling Hermione about your little visit, and will probably elaborate on the degree of your stupidity. It will amuse him greatly."
It's there in the shadows from one blink to the next, and Harry can read the subtext. Malfoy's suffering from nightmares. Harry lets the sympathetic smile grace his lips.
Three weeks passed where Draco spent little time with Potter, save the every other night feed where Potter knocked on his door and stared at his feet and scratched at the back of his neck until Draco let him in. And that only lasted a few perfunctory minutes with a handful of gestures and nods between them. Potter ate, got hard, and went on his way. It dawned on Draco that this awkward dance between them was a bed of his own making, but he refused to be the first to budge. As Potter made no move to articulate an apology, Draco made no move to elicit one from him. Silence was easier than arguing.
Draco laughs, really laughs, and Harry marvels at the true ring of sound. He's glimpsed it before, and it trills sweetly in his ears. Draco needs to laugh more often.
The door opens and Draco strides into the room on purposeful feet, shoes tapping lightly on the wooden floor. "I'm not disturbing you, am I?"
Harry chuckles and shakes his head, "Not so decent as you might think. I've done my fair share of terrible things."
Potter stretches out along his back, rubbing against him like an overly affectionate kneazle, except this kneazle moves a hand down to let two fingers lightly stroke across his puffy rim. Draco sucks in a breath as those two fingers slide through the mess of Potter’s come only to push it back inside. Potter growls and bites down on Draco’s earlobe as he shallowly finger fucks him, thumb rubbing in playful circles for added stimulation.
Harry can tell Ron is on the verge of a heavy confession, and knowing the man like he does, he knows that heartfelt expressions don't come easy for his friend. Harry relaxes and waits him out to see if Ron finally opens up.
"Yes," he replies with same amount of softness. "It did. But it would be better if next time you meant it. I can appreciate the effort you made. I know you did it for her, and not for me."
He can feel her stiffen beside him at the use of Blaise's name. His mother hates Blaise. Has always hated Blaise. Even in school.
Draco makes a face at him. "Take all the fun out of it, why don't you?" He wrinkles his nose and sighs. "Alright, I'm leaving." Draco shoots Ron a withering glare in passing. "Welcome to my home, Weasley. Don't fucking touch anything."
Harry takes a breath and puts his napkin in his lap as Blinky pops in with plates for Draco and himself. He finds Narcissa's gaze over the table. "I suppose this means you and Neville are headed back to the greenhouse today?"
Mrs. Malfoy stands, ever so graceful, and Harry rises along with her. She spares him a long glance, and Harry can't quite fathom what's going on in her eyes. She is warm and enigmatic, and Harry feels a distinct pull toward her. Her smile is light and a little wistful. Her hands tremble a touch before she clasps them together in front of her.
"You feel that?" Harry asks. "That's what you do to me. Kissing you, watching you, feeling you respond—that's what happens, Draco. You have me coming in my trousers like a schoolboy. You did that. As much as you think I have power over you—" he thrust his cock forward for emphasis, "—that's the power you have over me."
The resulting shudder of magic comes off huffy and annoyed, and Harry thinks if a house had eyes to roll—
about on the furniture. It's so obvious, it's pathetic." The tirade is delivered with the same high-handed affront Harry remembers from his youth. 'My father will hear about this' could be tacked on at the end, and he'd be right back at Hogwarts.
“Right,” he snapped back. “And you only asked Draco because you knew if you asked me I would say no, and that he would say yes just to spite me.”
He spoke with the indication that the simple phrase should be clear enough, and offered no gesture or other explanation to the contrary.
"Yes?" She stops and looks back, and he could stare into the acceptance he sees in her eyes forever.
He guides Draco into the shower and directs him to brace his hands on the tile. Harry steps in behind him, clothes and all, and grabs a couple of flannels and proceeds to wash Draco with careful, gentle movements. The cloth prevents skin to skin contact as Harry soaps him up all over. Harry lets his cloth-covered hand roam freely over Draco's body and he feels a level of contentment he's never felt before. Taking care of Draco is nothing like taking care of any of the other subs he's been with. He's never felt such a personal duty of care to someone before.
Potter's face gave nothing away as he moved closer, coming to stand uncomfortably close. His green eyes flicked down to Draco's neck and he replied in a low, sultry tone, "Maybe I just like looking at it."
Clothes. He needs clothes. Harry considers reaching for his old ones from yesterday, but given Narcissa's thoroughness with the products in the bathroom, he goes to the closet and isn't disappointed. It's filled with clothes, both Wizarding and muggle. He grabs a pair of boxers and socks before snagging a pair of neatly folded jeans and a soft cotton t-shirt from a hanger. He laughs out loud as he slips the on the purposely-faded shirt, emblazoned with a Muggle band logo. He wonders if Narcissa has any idea who 'Van Halen' is, but he has no doubt this is her doing. Her hand is all over this, not to mention he can smell traces of the jasmine scent she wears on the cotton. She handpicked these things specifically for him, he knows it. It wouldn't surprise him in the least if she still tries to pick out Draco's clothes as well.
The slow drag of skin on skin has to be rough, but it seems to be good enough for Draco. Harry doesn't feel the same way. A quick snap of his fingers has Draco's hand coated in conjured lube, and now his hand slips over his cock with a wet, slick slide. Draco cries out sharply at the increased sensation and his head jerks up to stare at Harry with wide, aroused eyes. Harry merely smirks in response as Draco snorts a harsh breath through his nose. The reduced friction has his hand moving faster now, and bless Merlin, he slows, obviously wanting to keep to the original pace Harry set for him.
Potter's green eyes flashed at the use of his given name, and he didn't waste a second before opening up and swallowing him down, pushing Draco's hips flat against the wall for leverage. Potter's mouth wasn't as hot, not without Draco's blood recently coursing through him. The sensation was still killer, warm and wet, the whole situation made hotter by the sight of Potter on his knees. That was enough for Draco.
Draco felt Harry’s lips graze against the sensitive spot just below his ear, his ragged speech ghosting over Draco’s flesh. The action sent tiny aftershocks spreading through him and Draco groaned, closing his eyes to let his head fall back against the wall with a thud. His lips curled into a sated smile.
it—" His words cut off, and he turned back around, realization written on the planes of his face. Potter clamored back, shaken. "If—if you weren't under, then why did you—?" Potter's voice broke. "It looked like you were," he stuttered. "It looked like you wanted—" Potter stopped there, brows knit over confused eyes.
"I know you seem to think that I was embroiled in some sort of domestic violence, and in hindsight, yes, it was. But not to the degree you're thinking. I wanted what he offered. I thought it was what I needed. I thought I needed to be punished, and Blaise wanted someone to punish." His gaze flicks to Harry and he smiles. "It should have been the perfect arrangement. But you see, Blaise only unleashed himself in the bedroom. Outside of that, we were the typical pure-blood couple. Poised, driven, socially desirable in certain circles. My name still carried more weight than his in society, much like it had in school. His inferiority complex is truly breathtaking." Draco sighs and puts his hands in his pockets, craning his neck back to look at the ceiling. "The bedroom was the only place he could take out his jealousy and berate me for my standing. And I let him."
Harry sighs and nudges at him with a foot. "Do you want it to happen again? Both of you? And what about Pansy? How did you leave things?"
She knows the words are bold, and she says them with confidence. After all, she wears boldness and confidence like a mantle, but she feels them now not because she has to be, but because she wants to.
The sad sentiment was breathed out with heart-breaking empathy, and in that moment, Molly Weasley resembled Narcissa Malfoy in spades. And because she looked so much like his own mother, Draco did exactly the same thing he would have done if Narcissa had indeed been standing there.
It only takes a moment for her to realize what she's seeing. She doesn't hear the gasp leave her mouth, but Neville does, shooting a glance over his shoulder. "What is it?" When she doesn't reply, he pulls himself upright. "Narcissa?"
“Enough!” Potter roared. “Don’t take another fucking step. You don’t touch him. You don’t look at him. You don’t come near him. He is mine.”
This is what he wants Draco to realize. That power is not defined by position. That control is not always domineering.
Draco’s free hand came up to push at Potter’s face and neck, trying desperately to find purchase. Potter snapped at his fingers, slicing the tips of Draco’s fingers. He hissed at the sting, and even the taste of Draco’s blood on his lips didn’t seem to spark any recognition. Potter was gone. This was the vampire, the thing he kept buried, the creature that only came out when Potter was too weak to hold it back.
"I mean," Draco explains, "that I bought her for you. That first night you arrived. Mother attended to your chambers and wardrobe, and I procured Pennywort on the off chance you wanted an owl of your own for private correspondence. She's rather special."
The air was thick with the scent of sweat and sex, and Draco swore he could detect the faint undertones of his own capitulation in the air. Potter snuffled beside him, but he couldn’t bring himself to look back. “What were you dreaming about?” Potter said nothing, and Draco was almost resigned to the fact that Potter wasn’t going to say anything, when he did.
Potter pulled him close and buried his nose in Draco's hair, inhaling deeply. "I'll take that under advisement," he said as his arms began to wind around Draco's waist. Draco patted him away with a huff.
He wants to reconcile everything that's happened, but there's too much emotion thrumming through his blood at the moment. Draco is something to behold. Something Harry knows he's been missing. He's unable to take his eyes off Draco, and he lies there like that, just watching, for several hours before sleep claims him as well.
It's so simple, and yet so complicated. He wants to show Draco what it's like to give in to pleasure, rather than having it taken from him. He knows it's also the hardest for Draco to reconcile. Submission under force comes easy for the Slytherin, especially when he feels that's all he's worth. This kind of pleasure, slow and syrupy-sweet, burgeoning with honeyed emotion is something Harry knows Draco will have to learn to take.
She smiles, nodding. "Blinky has our coats waiting." They turn and head for the hallway, and Narcissa calls over her shoulder, "Have a lovely day, boys."
"Do you have any idea how sexy you are right now?" he murmurs against Draco's throat. "How unbelievably gorgeous you look? Tied up here, just waiting for me to kiss you properly?" Harry's hands reach up over Draco's and grab the frame. "So patient, taking my kisses when I know you want more." He moves on to Draco's cheeks, licking over his face with the point of his tongue, dragging it over the arch of his brow, planting tiny, butterfly kisses down the bridge of his nose. Harry lets his lips ghost over Draco's eyelids, grazes his teeth over Draco's temples. He lets his mouth wander and worship over the high forehead, before coming back down to suck an earlobe into his mouth. He bites down and tugs, and Draco's whole body seizes. For a second, Harry thinks Draco might have lost his control.
Draco’s eyes slid shut as the echo pounded softly in his ears, moving through his body to vibrate at a steady rhythm. Potter’s chest grew warmer and warmer beneath his hand, and he could feel the reverberations spread out from underneath his fingers and into Potter, as if he were willing Potter’s dead heart to beat by touch alone. Magic tingled along the edges of his skin, sparking tiny fires that rippled out, and he gasped at the unexpected, yet arousing sensation. Potter tensed, and Draco’s eyes flew open.
He stepped under the spray and groaned. This was nothing like the cursory hose down he’d been given before he went to Potter’s cell. This was pure, unadulterated bliss. And now it was his. Well, his and Potter’s. He stood there for several minutes, allowing the water to cascade over him with the perfect amount of pressure of relieve some of the tension he’d been carrying. Feeling better, he got on with the business of washing the last traces of Azkaban from his body, satisfied that the remaining dregs of the awful place were headed down the drain where they belonged.
A niggling part of his brain urges him to turn and look at Malfoy, really look at him. He's still pointy, but he's grown into his features, and now the sharpness is a point of admiration. His eyes are guarded and Harry wonders what has put that caution there. Malfoy's always been open and honest with his hostility; this man is subdued. Whether he's letting it simmer, or the real fight's been taken out of him is anybody's guess. He's shown he's capable of short bursts of outrageous emotion, but it's easily quelled, and Harry finds that incredibly appealing. So when the answer scoots from the back of his throat to the tip of his tongue, he's looking directly at Malfoy to gauge his reaction.
Ron bursts out laughing. "You suck at this. That is all." He claps Harry on the back and grasps his shoulder. "I know this is different from the kind of relationship you have with Malfoy, but I can see where you're coming from. And Malfoy's not so bad, I know. If he was, you wouldn't still be here. I talked to him the other night at dinner. We've made our peace. I'm happy for you. And him, the pointy git."
Heat and fire and Harry zip through him, setting him ablaze. He's sweating, his back is aching, his balls are heavy and swollen, and his cock is harder in his hand than it's ever been. He knows he must look, whimpering and whining like a slut, needing to be fucked, needing to be filled with a want that is blind to everything in this world but what he thinks Harry's cock will feel like. Debauched, mouth open in an inelegant gape as he gasps for breath, body hunched and contorted so he can fuck his hand and his arse at the same time, the very picture of sin itself. But Harry's eyes look back at him with wonder. With approval. With want. It settles over him that this is how Harry sees him.
This time it is she who laughs. "I find it amusing that you still posture." Her hands relax and she breathes out to continue, "There is no one here to properly cower before you. No one to shiver at your great arrogance and delusions of power. There are no whores here to impress into our bed." She clucks at him, "How the mighty have fallen."
Draco sighs, a long, forlorn exhalation of breath. "I know, Renault. Nothing about him was what I expected, and I suppose it's the same for him. I can't look back and I can't go forward, either. It seems what I want isn't to be found. Not there and certainly not here." Draco's fingers clench at his side. "It's alright, though. I guess you can't really miss what you never had."
Draco shoved his right hand down the front of Potter's jeans and grabbed hold of his cock with a forceful squeeze. Potter moaned, arching into Draco's hand with a jolt of his hips. Draco closed his eyes and tilted his head further, giving the vampire better access. He let his hand slide from Potter's shoulder to cup the back of head and press, pushing Potter's face down while his other hand worked at his cock. Draco had him, arms full of writhing vampire, and it was only moments before Potter's body shuddered in climax.
"I think that would be a good thing," Neville says on a sigh. "Harry needs someone to balance him and challenge him at the same time. No one's ever seemed to push his buttons like Draco."
"It's the Ministry he doesn't trust," Potter said. "He thought that they would back out at the last minute and ruin this for you. So he suggested I attach my name. Even though they're all afraid of me, apparently my name still carries some weight. I came in at ten percent, just enough to look legit, and it all sailed through." Potter's hands clenched at his side. "Jesus, Draco, if you're that set against it, wait until it's all filed and legal and then fucking buy me out. I have no interest in having a say in your potions business. I was just trying to help."
"Heinrich was ages ago. This one's called Raoul." Renault sucks in a lascivious breath. "Exquisitely exotic."
Potter spoke the last sentence with a sense of conflicted wonder, and his fingers trailed across the back of Draco’s hand, finally covering it with his palm. He was cool to the touch, not the glacial temperature Draco had been expecting, and oddly, Potter was growing warmer by the second. Sure enough, when he pressed down, there was nothing. He felt faintly sick at the thought of Potter’s empty chest and what lay beneath it now. But Potter’s fingers started drumming again, and Draco closed his eyes to concentrate on his own heartbeat.
Potter stared at him, wide-eyed, no doubt imagining the scene in his mind. He burst out laughing again. "Oh, Draco. This is why I love you."
A red haze filters over Harry's vision, and he tamps down the anger, careful to keep himself composed. He's got control over his emotions, but somehow the fiery storm in his blood freezes, and his words spill out into the room, cold as ice.
Harry admires the muscled curve of Draco's arse as he bends to place his trousers on the sofa. Draco's lashes bat shyly, as if he's unused to such compliments. Perhaps he isn't, not like this. That's about to change.
Harry grunted and mouthed against the newly-exposed patch of skin, alternating the rub of his lips with the scrape of his fangs. “I swear, Malfoy, you’ll be the death of me.”
Potter was on him, all lips and tongue, and his hands wasted no time, seeking skin through the layers of his clothing. The cloth of his shirt rent under Potter's greedy fingers as he ripped the fabric away to lay hands on Draco's torso. Draco groaned, lost and drowning, into Potter's mouth as rough hands moved lower, reaching for the flies of his trousers. Draco grunted as he was propelled back by the force of Potter's kiss, and the moment his lower back touched stone, the horror of their location reared up and screamed in his brain.
Torches flared to life as Draco walked inside, the magic recognizing and accommodating the bloodline. Inside, the crypt spread out endlessly, a marvel of Wizarding space, and Draco walked quietly down the open row toward the back.
Ron's face turns sheepish. "Really, it's okay." He pauses and Harry lets him have the moment. "Because 'Mione slept with her, too."
His fingers curl around Malfoy's forearm, and Malfoy hisses at the contact, his eyes jerking downward. Harry's fingers are securely wrapped around the Dark Mark, and Malfoy snatches his arm away, rolling down the cuff of his sleeve. He supposes his own gasp is involuntary, and knows that Malfoy sees it as disgust. The horrified embarrassment on his face says as much. Malfoy opens his mouth on something that Harry instinctively knows is going to be an apology, because he figures Malfoy's been apologizing for the damn tattoo for ages.
His cock throbbed between them, right on the edge of orgasm, and he reached down. Again, Potter's hand batted him away with a snarl. "No," he grunted, leaning over to brace one hand over Draco's shoulder. "You'll come on my cock or not at all."
She laughs, a full-throated chuckle that booms out into the room. Her arm snakes into Harry's and she tugs at him. "We'll owl you an invitation to the bonding. Come, Potter. It's time you properly introduced me to your Weasleys. Ronald looks like he's got the bristle end of a broom up his arse, and Granger's shoes are exquisite. I feel like mingling."
Hermione waved a hand. "No, no, I won't be here long. I wanted you to take a look at these as soon as they were ready. I know you've been waiting for this, especially since the Ministry decided to grandfather in your apprenticeship."
Draco's face scrunched up in horror. "I thought it was her bringing the dead mice back here. I tried to dispose of one, and the brat nearly took off my finger. I guess I know where the violent streak is coming from—your bloody owl."
"Easy," Harry says, kissing down the backs of Draco's legs. "You're doing so well. You're so beautiful, Draco. So beautiful," Harry murmurs against his skin. His voice has a calming effect, and the rattling dwindles.
It was difficult to keep the incredulous snort to himself. "You don't expect me to believe you've never—"
"Are you still seeing this Dr. Marbury? Will you continue to see her?" Draco didn't think Potter's confession was lip service; the man had been far more insightful and less histrionic than he supposed. Honestly, when he thought about Potter coming to his senses and demanding Draco come back, he thought there would be some dramatic showing, complete with hysterical crying and possibly a good bout of begging. But this, Draco had to admit he hadn't expected. Potter was
Narcissa Malfoy is just as shocked as her son, eyes wide and surprised, body pressed close to Malfoy's.
Harry full well knows they like their handcuffs fuzzy and pink with a quick release; Harry likes his with a bite and a beg. As for Owen—Harry should have spotted his game a mile off. The kind of sub that likes the game only when it suits them. And the only things about their game that suited Owen were Harry's fame and the contents of his vaults. But he hit every almost every one of Harry's weak points. Tall, aristocratic, with a gorgeous body that pinked up beautifully under the sting of a riding crop, and an eager willingness to submit.
He feels Draco pull in a long breath and waits for the fond, yet slightly scathing critique of his ability he knows is bound to come forth. Draco's never been above taking the piss when it comes to Harry.
Draco flipped open the file and gathered up his quill, perusing the legalese on the parchment. Everything was going along swimmingly, and he signed and initialed where indicated, until his eyes came to rest on a name that no business being there.
Snape regarded Draco's drawn face as he entered the lab, envelope clutched in his hand. "I see your results have arrived."
But the want in Harry is too great, and the hope that he and Draco can have something extraordinary burns too hot in his blood. The words flow out smoothly. "For this to work, you have to trust me. I will not have a lover who is afraid of me, or ashamed of who he is, or what we do. If you think you can come to terms with that and openly accept it, then come back to me. Because if you can do that, I can promise you that I will give you everything you need. I will take control, and I will make you feel more powerful that you could ever imagine."
." He grinds out the last three words just to see Ron shrink. It always takes beating him over the head with the obvious to make a point. It's Ron's way, and Harry knows it, but he doesn't have to be happy about it. "You could have owled, or firecalled, or I don't know," Harry's voice drips with sarcasm, "knocked on the fucking door like a normal person."
When Harry opens the door to his room the oxygen is sucked from his lungs, and he almost braces himself on the door jamb for support.
Draco left Potter dazed in the moonlight, the blissful hum of self-satisfaction bubbling inside. He made it five steps before Potter’s hushed whisper caught up to his ears.
Potter’s head swiveled to glare at him while the others stifled bright chirps of laughter. Molly took the bottle and Draco’s coat, holding out a hand for Potter’s as well. The frown on his face dissipated somewhat as he handed it over.
It sounded too good to be true, but he knew that if there was a catch, Granger was too good at heart to cover it up. Even for Harry’s sake.
When Draco's mouth fell open and his head lolled back in offering, Harry lost whatever shred of control he had, snapping, "Enough of this. Let's just skip to the part where I kill you for daring to put your hands on what's mine."
"Well, then he's got it bad. He sits by the front door and waits for her. Preens for hours. Puffs up before she arrives, that sort of thing. Brings her dead mice. There's an awful lot of cooing for it to be strictly platonic." Potter grinned. "It's kind of cute."
“Harry! Draco! You’re here! George, let them breathe!” Molly Weasley’s voice preceded her entrance, presumably from the kitchen, if the aroma that followed her was any indication.
"Fine, fine," Harry chuckles. He clears his throat and says soberly, "You're the luckiest man I know."
"I do. Dying in the course of duty is noble. The one thing your friends feared, but secretly expected." Draco's voice dropped. "But it went wrong, didn't it? Smugglers weren't prepared for the Great Harry Potter, and out of fear, they let you go. You didn't escape," Draco accused, eyes flashing. "They left the fucking door open, and you ran."
The teasing banter is bursting bubbles of stuffy propriety and scattering her inhibitions into the wind like the snowflakes that swirl around them.
Hermione’s smile dropped from her face and the familiar mask of resigned disappointment settled across her features.
"You mentioned that you do not like humiliation. Neither do I, so be assured that is something that I will not pursue. How are you with pain?"
At the first press of his tongue, she opens, because she has no choice but to let him in. He plunders, takes, demands. But at the same time, he's giving, sharing, and offering. His hands come up to tangle in her hair, and she clutches at him for support. She could kiss him like this for days, for years, forever.
But Harry recognizes that his presence in the Manor alone is enough make him the pusher, not the pushee. Frankly, Harry doesn't have buttons anymore, not since he's swapped out the boy he used to be for the man he's rewired himself to become.
That shoves Draco into action. "No—no, sir." Long elegant fingers frantically start working and in seconds, he's naked before Harry's hungry gaze. Draco clasps his hands behind his back and waits, and Harry can already see the flush of arousal creeping across his pale skin.
Silvestri chuckled before turning to Draco and offering a formal bow. He said nothing, and disappeared out the front door with a whisper of his black cloak.
Draco's gaze swivels from the rack to Harry, back and forth like a metronome, keeping the same beat as the blood pumping through Harry's veins. He takes a deep breath, centers himself to focus his mind, and then exhales slowly.
“No.” Ron’s hand came up to rest on his shoulder. “You’re still Harry, underneath it all. And yes, you could have killed me. But can you honestly say that if the tables were turned, that you wouldn’t feel the same way, if it were me?”
Draco flung his arms around Hermione without thought, hugging her to his chest. "Merlin, that's wonderful!"
Harry's mouth watered with taste of Draco on his tongue, the feel of his body against his. He wanted. By Merlin, he wanted. Wanted all the things that he knew he could not have. Draco's harsh, choppy breathing, the flush of sweat on his skin, the clench and pull of long, narrow fingers. Wanted his basest desires to come to life, to be the one to watch Draco fall apart, to be the one who unmade him. He wanted that victory. But he knew he was unwilling to pay the price. Draco had always been expensive.
"And if you don't, that's fine, too." The words rushed from Potter's mouth and he held his hands out in supplication. "Really, it's okay." There was a flash of earnest protest in Potter's eyes as he continued, "If it's not, just tell me what you want and I'll do everything in my power to give it to you, I promise."
It was as if someone opened a window in Potter’s soul as Draco drummed out the beat of his heart on Potter’s skin. His gaze focused and sharpened, green eyes glittering like dark stars, bright with recognition and surprise. Potter’s brow rose and loosened the grip on Draco’s neck. He gulped in sweet lungfuls of precious air, coughing to clear his chest. He stared at Potter, afraid to speak, lest he break the fragile reprieve he’d been granted. Potter’s dumbstruck expression quickly moved to one of horror and he collapsed on top of Draco, burying his face in the crook of Draco’s neck.
Harry’s shoulders slumped, the thought of rage was just so tiring. “I don’t see how you can feel that way. What kind of friend, what kind of brother am I, that would do that?” He turned his head away. “It’s this thing,” he spat. “It’s made me into a monster.”
Harry throws a sheet over the easel and swivels in the chair to face him. "Of course not. I was just finishing up for the night."
Hermione laughed alongside him. "Yes, well, there were several witnesses present, and it was all preserved by Pensieve. The vial will go into the archive along with the signed paperwork once it's filed." She patted his hand. "It was his suggestion that I be his proxy." Her eyes twinkled. "I think swotty Miss Granger has moved up in his estimation."
"No," Draco protests as his head swings around to Harry. "I mean—just, no. That won't be necessary. I want this."
She shot one more glare at Potter, took a deep breath and shouted, “Get out! Run while you can! Flee the monster and his den of iniquity! He defiles—”
That blond head dips again, seductive and sly, and his eyes sparkle like starlight. Draco's tongue makes a slow swipe across his bottom lip, making it glisten a rosy pink in the low light of the room. He whispers, but it sounds like a siren in Harry's brain.
Draco awoke to tangle of sheets and the flood of lamplight in the room. Potter was nowhere to be found, but the sound of raised voices carried up from downstairs. He yawned, rubbed his eyes, and shuffled down the stairs to see what the hell Potter was up to now.
“All the curtains are spelled closed,” Potter offered, noting his glance around the room. “For a reason,” he added. “And if you tamper with them, you’ll get a nasty shock.” He smirked. “If you’re lucky.”
possible, Mr. Potter," she goes on. "The Manor is quite old, and the very land on which it sits is imbued with the most ancient of magics. For it to have heard your call and responded in this manner is indeed strange, but
"Look, Potter," Draco interrupted. "Your attempt at actually giving a fuck is noted, if not appreciated. However, we both know that you couldn't care less about what happens now so long as it doesn't interfere with your feeding schedule. The small talk is unnecessary." Draco stepped back a bit, and those long fingers he had admired moments ago closed around his wrist, pulling him between Draco's body and the table. "Just do what you have to do. I'm busy, and the clock is ticking."
"And I thank you for your trouble." Potter's bare chest and expanse of touchable flesh was a distraction, and Draco had to force his eyes to Potter's face to concentrate.
Harry shushes him. "No, there's no need for an apology. I admit I was upset at first, but you cannot be held accountable for something of which you weren't aware. But now you know." The last statement is final. "And
Silvestri's head shot up, and his body tensed as if to strike. All pretense dropped from his face, and the vampire's voice dripped with menace. "Fine," he said with finality. "If you're not going to be sensible, I'll just kill him now, shall I?"
Harry sucks in a breath and barks out a laugh. "Oh no, I'm afraid I knew the exact moment you set foot on British soil. You've tried three times to access your seized vaults at Gringotts, been denied entry to La Cave twice, and consulted with no less than six Ministry lawyers in an attempt to do Merlin knows what—" Harry flicks a dismissive hand in the air, "I got bored with it and moved on." He looks to Draco and smiles warmly. "There are more important things that require my attention."
Potter's hands clenched at his sides, and the glare in his eyes promised untold violence. Snape let his gaze flick over the vampire in disdain and continued, "As usual, you don't have any idea what you're doing, or you do and you don't care. I'm not certain which is worse."
"About breakfast—I don't want you to think I'm trying to usurp your authority or anything. I'm not sure why your house is doing these things, but—"
With that, Potter's fangs hit their mark, sinking into Draco's flesh with one stinging bite as his cock rammed home.
Draco froze at Potter's easy assertion, directed toward him for the first time. Potter lowered his lashes and reached out to touch Draco's knee.
Draco's been on his knees in front of a cabinet like this before, Harry's sure of it, but this time is an entirely different context. His body seems to recognize that, because the slight tremble Harry sees is one of pleasure—not fear.
Potter's eyes shuttered closed, and his mouth drew up. His throat worked like he was going to speak, but no sound emerged.
Her restraint faltered and she pulled Potter into a hug. “Harry,” she whispered. “We’ve missed you so much.”
I am so sorry it took this long, but I thank you all for sticking with me. I hope you find that this was worth the wait. Cheers!
"No," Harry says, his lips pursed into a tight line. "This is me, showing you what I have to offer. Openly, honestly. I can't help it if you're responding to that. I haven't made a move toward you. If I had, you'd already be in my bed and this conversation would be pointless. I don't need to pursue anything. You'll either come to me, or you won't. It's as simple as that."
Draco threw his arms into the air, swatting at Potter's questing hands and disengaging himself. "For fuck's sake, Potter! Get off me!" he shouted, pushing away. "I'm
Draco leaves Ron gaping after him, and Harry runs a hand over his face in consternation. Really, it could have been so much worse.
“An arrangement has been reached.” His gaze sharpened on her hands as she unrolled the parchment onto the table.
He shrugs again. "Fine, I suppose. When she left, there were goodbye kisses and hugs, but none of that, 'I'll owl you' awkwardness. She didn't seem concerned at all."
He imagines what he looks like, crumpled on the floor of the shower, a mess of monumental proportions.
Narcissa pulls in a deep breath and leans over to place her hand on his shoulder. "Well, then. How fortunate that's exactly what you have to give him."
“He doesn’t have to be here. He has a choice.” The argument was weak, and Harry knew it. But he was feeling far too agitated to make a good showing. It was always the same when he tried to talk to Hermione or the others. He started feeling things he didn’t want to, and suddenly he couldn’t make heads or tails of the situation, and letting the vampire come out was so much easier than trying to do the right thing.
"No," Harry chuckles as he shakes his head. "That was a particularly strong anti-wrinkle charm with a touch of an arousal-inhibiting hex." Harry stares straight into Draco's eyes. "The next time he gets an erection, he'll break out in hives. Very unpleasant."
"You don't have to do this. I wasn't expecting any sort of reciprocation. Especially not like this."
The jibe is delivered in Draco's signature drawl with such affront that Harry doubles over in laughter. Two hours and four games of chess later, he's still soaking in every moment in Draco's presence.
Much to his surprise, Draco's saving grace over the past few weeks had come in the form of Granger and Weasley, both of whom had infiltrated Grimmauld and at one point or another had dragged him out in daylight, forcing him to grasp at some semblance of normalcy. If he had to label it, it would have looked dubiously like friendship.
He shoves his fingers further into his arse, pistoning his hips back and forth in time with the pump of his fist. The sensation is incredible, and his mouth falls open on a guttural moan that sweeps up from his toes. His eyes slam shut because he can't bear to look at himself, instead choosing to put Harry's face at the forefront of his mind. He focuses on Harry's eyes, looking at him with such wicked intent. He hears the sound of his voice, urging him onward in raspy, throaty encouragement. Draco shuffles forward and braces his knee on the seat and crouches forward for a better angle. The change is instantaneous.
His beautiful boy is a mess underneath his crop and his tongue, mewling and writhing with sinuous grace. This time, Harry takes the flat of the crop and swats at his balls lightly before swiping up over the crack of his arse. The breath that Draco sucks in is sharp and fierce, and Harry has no choice but to respond.
Draco's head snaps up. "I know." Harry expects to see more of Draco's earlier indignation, but there's nothing behind his gray eyes but flat acceptance. "Your do-gooder Gryffindor nature wouldn't allow it. And there's nothing to usurp, as my mother so tactfully pointed out. I'm assuming the house magic is latching on to the nearest powerful presence." A pale eyebrow rises in a perfect arch. "Of course, that would be you."
He took a second to compose himself and made sure his face showed nothing other than mild annoyance as he descended.
He waves a hand in the air, and a small pulse of magic settles over them both. "There. If either of us feels the need to safeword, the scene stops. If you are bound or restrained in any manner, you will be released. Then we will talk about what happened and either choose to continue or end the scene altogether." He fixes Draco with a pointed look. "There is no shame in using it. There will be no consequences or repercussions. It is exactly what it implies: safety. For both of us. Understand?"
"Go to him. I think the fact that I'm here is sufficient proof of Potter's capability to grovel effectively, don't you think? We'll discuss the terms of this arrangement and why I'm here at a later time. Right now, you have other business to attend."
"Yes," Draco said, shutting the door. He sat down in front of the portrait. Dark shadows smudged underneath Draco's eyes, casting a pallor over his pale skin. He bore a look Snape hadn't seen cross his face in years: the anguish of an interminable situation.
Her face brightens considerably, and it warms corners of Harry's heart to see it. "I'll send those owls out, if you'll get in touch with your friends?" she asks.
Draco complies, hands slowly moving to the top button of his shirt. One by one, he unfastens them, stopping only when he reaches his waistband. He untucks the bottom half of the shirt, making deliberate work of pushing each button through the hole. His eyes are downcast the entire time, and his bottom lip is pulled between his teeth in light concentration. When he shrugs one shoulder from the fabric, his eyes come up to meet Harry's, and his lashes flutter as he releases his lip on a sigh.
Potter stopped short at Draco's shout, and he meant to close his mouth, he really did, but now emotion he once buried came into the light with all the force of a speeding train. It was careening past, full-steam, and headed for Potter's shell-shocked face. "I didn't do it for you, or the war effort, or anyone else! I did it for me, because I was weak and selfish!" Tears streamed unbidden down Draco's cheeks, and he had to double over and gasp for breath.
Draco groans, and the sound makes the hairs on the back of Harry's neck stand at attention. "We really are going to be overrun with Gryffindors, aren't we?"
"Those are Narcissus 'Rose of May' daffodils," Potter murmured over his shoulder. I know your mother was fond of roses, but these reminded me of her. I hope you don't mind."
Draco sagged against the wall to slide down to the floor as his legs gave way. The spray turned icy, but he was unable to move, except to bring trembling fingers to press against his bruised mouth.
Draco sits back and inhales a cleansing breath before downing a gulp of water. "That's not what—I didn't—oh, bugger off, Potter." He shakes off Harry's touch with a violent shudder.
Potter frowned at the obvious dismissal from the house-elf. “Make up the room across from mine for Draco. It’s his now.”
It was wrapped up tight in the perfection of his mouth, lips shiny and red like a Christmas ribbon. Wrapped securely in the warmth of his breath, the swirl of his tongue. Tucking in at the corners, perfectly creased paper, daring him to peek at the treasure inside. A gift begging to be opened.
"No. Because whatever is good between the two of you isn't wrong, as long as you're not hurting someone else in the process." He eyes Ron good to drive the meaning home.
. He's never had a sub receive like this, never had one who has so much to let go, and been so willing to let it happen. It's a tipping point on the scales, and Harry's brain can't comprehend the magnitude of what is happening. Because Draco is so good for him, so blessedly
"—you can't live with me, I know," Potter finished. "But I'm hoping you might change your mind. Are you open to a discussion, at least?"
would it have brought him here?" It's the sheer offense in Malfoy's words that makes Harry's head turn his way. "What in the hell would the Manor want with Potter, of all people?"
The second the third finger pushes in and rubs against his sweet spot with force, his hands come up to wrap around Harry's wrist. Harry kisses him and increases the pace. He's fucking into Draco's tight heat with as much force as he can muster, and Draco's grip on his wrist is bone-crushingly firm, but not panicked. He keeps his eyes on Harry, and Harry can see the maelstrom of emotion that swirls across his face.
The thought is sobering and her hands give a tiny push against his biceps. His hold relaxes and he gently sets them apart. His dark eyes are glittering with arousal. His lips are full, slick, and red. He is so young, so handsome, and she
"Miss Cissa is telling Master Dragon not to be being worried about Master Harry missing meals, but he is keeping looking at the empty chair where Master Harry sits."
"Ah," he says, inclining his head to assess her, "there's your shrewish tongue. How easily you return to the uncouth nature of your blood without me to gentle you. Lady Malfoy shows her true colors at last."
Snape glared from the confines of the portrait. "Charming." He let out a put-upon sigh. "I'm already dead, Draco. I can drag this on forever if necessary."
“Left unchecked, your friend will only grow bolder. He has shunned every attempt we have made to bring him into our fold and teach him ways to accept what he has become,” Silvestri said. “How long before he does kill someone, or Turn another without approval? We have laws and treaties for a reason. To ensure that we can coexist peacefully. If he tramples that trust, and my people decide to rally against him, even I won’t be able to stop the war that will ensue.”
Draco's lashes fluttered and his tongue swiped out to moisten his dry lips. "Perhaps," he replied softly. "If it was tasteful. But knowing you, you'd give me something horrific and I'd have to take it just to be nice."
"They're pregnant, you idiot! It's not just about me! They're going to announce it, and they want you there!" Draco yelled.
"I want to fuck you, there's no doubt. I want to put my hands and mouth on you and make you beg for it. I want to tie down and spread you open with my tongue. I want to slide my cock into your body and fuck you so hard you forget your own name." Draco pales at the blatant declaration, but then Harry watches as the blood slowly creeps back, flushing high on his cheeks. His pupils dilate until only a ring of gray is visible, and there's a growing bulge at the front of his trousers. "I want all of that and more. I want to talk to you, laugh with you, spend time with you. In bed and out. It's true I don't know why I'm here, but it's pretty clear that you're a part of it. And if it didn't feel right, I'd know, because there's no way my magic or my conscience would allow me to stay if it wasn't." Harry shoulders out of the dressing gown, dropping it to the floor with a swish. "I'm not perfect," he says, running his hands over the circular-shaped scar on his chest, "but I'm a good man. And this is what I have to give you. A scarred body and a reshaped soul that is as demanding as you think it is. I know what I want, what I need. But if you aren't the least bit interested, tell me, and that's the end of it."
Zabini is pale and speechless—two things he's probably never been before. That's satisfactory enough.
"Behold, Potter," Malfoy says, the dry spite echoing out into the vastness of the cavernous room. "The studio."
Draco's eyes are bright and shining and he steps forward, bringing his body perilously close to Harry's. "I knew that. And that's what makes Pennywort so special. I acquired her from Hedwig's breeder."
"I—I don't, I mean, I didn't think much—well, yes," Draco stutters. His eyes widen on an incredulous gasp. "What's in there?"
When he hasn't seen Draco for meals or been accosting him in corridors, he's been holed up in his office with his head stuck in the Floo. Harry thinks Draco's come to decisions regarding the Malfoy trust, but hasn't pressed for details. He'll let Draco come to him in his own time. And Harry has all the time in the world.
," Draco shot back with smile, holding up the letter. "Apparently, you taught me everything you know."
Potter’s eyes are trained on Draco like he’s the only thing worth looking at in the room, and fuck if it hasn’t been a long time since that’s happened. Potter wants, and it doesn’t take a second for Draco to realize he’s going to give it to him.
Her words are so painstakingly polite, so devoid of scorn, yet somehow her calm smile makes him feel like a Crup who's shit on her favorite rug. His spine snaps straight, lest she chide him for slouching in her presence.
“First you put a wand in my hand, and now you’re taking me to the bedroom? Goodness, Potter. All this romance will make me swoon.” Potter rolled his eyes, and Draco leaned with a conspiratorial whisper. “I would’ve let you have me on the settee. And let Walburga watch.”
“Is this your arse-backwards way of telling me I’m showering too loudly? Because you’re the one who offered me a shower in the first place. If you wanted me to wait, then you should have said something before I came in here and got naked and started lathering up my bits-” Draco’s rant cut off when Potter stepped into to the shower, pajamas and all, and pressed two fingers to his cheek, tapping softly.
"Praise Merlin," Harry breathes out. "I don't want you to ever lose who you are." He sniffs and stands back. "Now let's get something to eat. I'm starving."
Draco’s head snapped up at Weasley’s shout, and he swiped the back of his hand across his face, wiping away the wetness that remained. He scrabbled to his feet and shoved the letter into his trouser pocket, walking out to meet Ron across the yard. Potter followed behind Weasley, and Draco was shocked to see the narrow, angry set of his eyes.
It was excruciatingly tender, fraught with emotion, and utterly, completely, devastatingly wrong. With everything breaking between them, Potter had no right to force affection on him. No right to make it feel so good, like it might mean something real. Something he might have hoped for. Draco's eyes scrunched closed, halting the trek of the salty moisture that had gathered. He bit down on his lip to stifle the moan stalled in his throat as Potter's hands slid between them. The vampire's mouth latched onto the bite mark, covering it with his lips as his tongue danced over it, while his hands went for Draco's fly. In seconds, Potter had both their cocks out, eager and straining, trapped in the confines of his fist.
"I asked you a question, Draco. Will you let me care for you?" It's an admonishment, but it holds no heat.
Draco's breath falters and he licks his lips. This is a tipping point, a weight on the scale. Harry knows the command in his voice resonates in the sudden stillness of the room, and he waits. Waits to see if Draco is going to obey, because if he does it's one step closer to closing this gap between them.
"Oh, come on. You know we all hated Owen. Even Seamus hated him, and Seamus likes everybody." Ron sighs. "You're staying, aren't you?"
Draco stops pacing and walks closer to Harry, stopping in front of him. His eyes are sad, a little bright, and utterly beautiful. "I've had nothing but pain and humiliation with this type of relationship. I've been disappointed and hurt. And for a long time I thought I would rather be alone that have to endure that again. And you say that it's real, what I want. That I can give you control and let myself go. Let myself feel. Because that's what I need. I have been raised to maintain control of myself my entire life. To be in control of every situation, every outcome. To have the advantage, no matter what it takes. To always wear a mask of superiority and never show my true feelings." Draco averts his gaze and swallows, steeling himself. When he looks back to Harry, he says, "Emotions are sometimes uncomfortable for me. It makes me feel vulnerable and a Malfoy is
Draco leans over. "Well done, Harry. You made the barmiest of the lot cry. I'd double check everything before I put it in my mouth from now on."
Potter's face was a trampled mix of surprise, sadness, and disbelief. "I didn't—I didn't know. You really…you, I mean—"
"Mr. Potter," she says, casual as you please, her right hand slipping atop Malfoy's with a gentle nudge. Malfoy drops his arm a second later. "What an unexpected surprise." Her voice is crisp and breathless, with a hint of wariness around the edges. "I wasn't aware of a scheduled Auror visit, or have we reverted back to impromptu inspections? Although I must say, even on those visits we said our greetings at the front door."
“This is Walburga’s study. I’m going to be redoing this room, and there are some things in here I thought you might want, considering some of them are probably Black family heirlooms.”
Conviction sears like a brand into his heart as Harry realizes that no one will ever again make Draco suffer in that way. Because if they do, he'll AK the lot of them and skip happily to Azkaban for his crimes. It's probably not the healthiest train of thought, but he doesn't give two fucks about it.
"Don't," Draco says roughly. "I know you lost people, too. I know my grief isn't any more special than anyone else's."
Potter rubbed his nose along the bridge of Draco's on a breathy sigh, ending with a soft, intimate kiss to the tip. His green eyes were guarded, wary.
The sneer that crosses his face is hate personified. "Yes, I bought you. And you were never worth the price I paid."
Harry thinks he could have poked her and knocked her over. Wide eyes and a small gasp reveal her surprise.
This isn't good. It's not even in the same post code as good. Malfoy's a man who's always maintained control in the face of others, or at least tried to. The perfect pureblood prince. Stoic, masked, and always in control. But he's losing his grasp on it here, and he's doing it in a way that isn't remotely productive.
Harry snorts and sits up from his reclining position on the chaise, placing the volume of Rumi's collected works on the side table. He doesn't respond, instead taking in the way Draco's practically vibrating with restrained emotion. Harry scoots back, getting more comfortable. He adjusts his dressing gown, pulling it out from where it's bunched up beneath him. He's aware that Draco's getting an eyeful of his bare chest as he does so, but he blinks twice at Draco and says calmly, "I'm not trying to seduce you, Draco."
Narcissa tsks under her breath at her son's language, but Harry simply smiles at her. "I don't think you'd be up for it anyway," He grins at Narcissa. "I'm a cuddler."
Harry’s breath is warm on his neck and his lips just brush across Draco’s ear. “You’re going to marry me, Malfoy.”
The sound is broken, but it's not what Harry really wants. He wants to impress himself upon Draco, to fill his every sense with Harry's presence. To envelope him in pleasure. To extract every last piece of Draco's self-control. Until Draco knows nothing but Harry. Feels nothing but Harry.
He blinks twice, steadying himself before continuing. "There are a few things I want to get straight, so there's little doubt as to what you can expect." Harry flicks his gaze over Draco. "Tonight is about obedience and trust. I trust that you will obey, and you will trust that I will not push you beyond your capabilities. There is much we have to learn about each other, and that's not going to happen if we rush things. Understand?"
The tantrum is clearly a coping mechanism; one Harry indulges for a few seconds more, until Malfoy tips over the edge from childish to desperate.
"Well," he adds, "I did sort of have a destination. The meeting with my friends didn't go well, and I was in a rotten state of mind. Then the reporters started shouting from the end of the street, and I knew they would follow if I ran. I was thinking that I just needed some space, some time to deal with…certain difficulties in my life right now. I wanted some peace. I think I called 'sanctuary', and the next thing I know, I'm here."
Draco raises his head and gasps, skin flushing a perfect shade of pink. His erection bobs out in front of him, clearly pleased at what is on display before him. His hands slide behind his back to clasp together, and Harry has to bite his lip to keep from moaning at the sight of him.
The tapping at the window breaks the mood as Blinky pops in to let open it for the fluffy gray owl. It immediately settles on Blinky's arm and she trots it over to Narcissa. Her eyes widen in surprise as she examines the outstretched leg. "It's from your Mr. Longbottom. I didn't expect to hear anything so quickly."
Harry sunk into the couch cushions, rubbing his hands over his face. “Family. I guess Malfoy, too, then?”
Harry leans over and whispers between them, "Arch your back. Yes," he sighs, rubbing small circles on Draco's hip. "That's it. Stick that pretty arse of yours in the air. I want to see it."
Draco turned, feeling the release of emotions long tethered to his heart break free. It was all he could say, because with those words, he had nothing left for his father. Drops of crimson trailed after him as he approached his mother's tomb, and if he heard Potter's swift intake of breath, it didn't register as his eyes rested on the carving of his mother's name. This time, his right hand held nothing back, and he caressed the stone lovingly, as her own hand would have stroked through his hair when he was a child.
Potter laughed softly and shook his head. “I’ve seen more Dark Marks than I care to admit on men who had no compunction about flaunting them. Yours is still the only thing it ever was.” Green eyes danced with interest. “A wicked tattoo.”
Draco is grace personified as he lowers himself to kneel. He assumes the waiting position, and if he is surprised by the charm, his face doesn't show it. He maintains eye contact with Harry, but his breathing has picked up a touch, making his chest rise and fall in a sharper rhythm.
"You're afraid you'll hurt me like you hurt the others, I know," Draco offered. "You don't need to worry about that." He yanked Potter flush and breathed against his lips, mouthing at him, licking across his bottom lip. He tasted dark and rich, with the sweetness of danger. "You can only break me in ways that I want to be broken."
The muscles in Potter's arms bunched and flexed as Draco fucked into his throat, and at that moment, Potter was the most gorgeous thing he'd ever seen. He took each stroke beautifully, and Draco panted, feeling that throat close around and him and suck. The orgasm started at the base of his spine, sizzling through his nerves and setting every part of him on fire. The sensation burst in short, sharp spikes, pulsing out through his cock and into Potter's waiting mouth.
There's no magical tweak; this time the fantasy is all Harry. He smiles as he palms his half-hard cock. Harry puts some serious consideration into having one off right now. Merlin knows he's good for it. Draco, wet and wanton, makes for excellent wanking material. Harry's no slave to his desires. He knows if he waits, all the better. He finishes his shower and steps out, wrapping a fluffy towel around his waist. He wraps up his ablutions with the toothbrush and paste in the cabinet and a drying charm on his hair.
“Going to look in my mouth next? Check my teeth?” Draco spat, giving voice to his irritation. “I can assure you Azkaban has kept me at least healthy enough to sustain you.”
Draco whipped around in time to see a large swath of black robes swish into the frame, and Draco's heart caught in his chest. A familiar profile appeared, a hook-like nose he'd known since childhood, and suddenly he was looking square into the dark eyes of Severus Snape.
His eyes held Draco’s, and Draco felt a tiny tickle at the back of his mind that made him want to lean forward and see what other wonders he could find at the bottom of Potter’s emerald gaze. The tapping hand kept its rhythm as it slid up Potter’s muscled thigh, up over his stomach, dragging the edge of his dirty t-shirt high enough to reveal tanned skin over taut planes. The shirt dropped as the hand went higher, finally coming to rest over Potter’s heart, two fingers still tapping out a steady thump-thump, even as his eyes held Draco fast. There was no emotion on Potter’s face that he could discern, just a blankness that pulled him and refused to let go.
"Relax, Potter, we're here," Malfoy says, stopping at the end of the hall, and Harry can hear the eye roll in the haughty drawl. "This is your room." He flips a hand at the door. "I'm across from you. You'll find everything you need inside. Call for a house-elf if not." Malfoy sighs heavily and turns. "I'll see you at dinner."
Draco gasped as his body burned, sucking air in huge, great gulps. Potter's head was thrown back in rapturous grace, the tendons in his neck pulled tight against his skin. He gave as much as he took, his face revealing that he was just as lost as Draco, murmuring a hushed litany of
Emotion swells in his heart because it feels like someone has blown away the smoke and the shadow, leaving him to stand there in Harry's gaze, shining with light. The pressure clamps down and he fucks and fucks and fucks under Harry's watchful eye, until the sensation coalesces to burst out in a tide of orgasm.
Draco's fingers curled around the letter as he sighed, and it hit Snape that Draco had only entered the room looking for Potter.
Pansy blows Draco a kiss as Harry steers her across the floor. "But I'm your loathsome bint, darling. Never forget," she clucks. "Chop, chop, Potter. I have a finite amount of time before these heels give out. Let's make it count."
Millie's eyes narrow and her mouth opens, no doubt to revisit the long-winded, profanity-laden lecture about creating heirloom pieces, artist recognition, and her and Luna's future financial stability, but he cuts her off with a hand.
Deep in slumber, the expanse of his chest rises and falls with soft, slow breaths, and his plush, pink lips are slightly parted. He is peaceful, quiet in languorous sleep, and so beautiful that Harry's breath evaporates. Unfettered by the slick gels from their Hogwarts days, his platinum hair looks soft as corn silk as it spreads out across the pillow. Harry's fingers curl by his side with the urge to
She huffs and straightens the line of her dress. "I don't want an apology," she pouts. "I want an introduction—oh, never mind, then. I see how it is."
Suddenly, Potter's face was in his neck, breathing out over the bite mark and making it tingle, before the flat of his tongue licked a long, slow stripe over it, trailing up Draco's neck to just under his ear.
The bite mark on his neck tingled and tightened in anticipation at the proximity of Potter's mouth, and Draco steeled himself for the sting to come. It never came. Instead, Potter rubbed the bridge of his nose over the two small marks, teasing and slow, alternating the touch with the drag of his lips and slow licks from his tongue.
Harry's index finger stretches to draw a lazy circle on the tablecloth, still so close but not touching. Draco tenses, as if he is anticipating the contact.
“Three barely squares has helped me maintain my girlish figure, Potter. Now, if you would be so good as to bite me, we can get on with this farce and get the hell out here.” Draco raised his left arm, but dropped it as the Dark Mark came into Potter’s view. He had made such a habit of ignoring it on his own skin that his brain simply didn’t see it anymore, but Potter’s eyes darkened at its appearance. “Apologies,” he sniffed, raising his right arm. “Is this less uncomfortable?”
"What? As gorgeous as Heinrich was, he was as thick as a post. There's something to be said for actual conversation, you know. One can only hear, "Fuck me harder" so many times before it gets tedious. In German, no less."
"Darling, your mother has always been one of my favorite people, but I must say I've never been so proud." She ticks off her fingers. "Gorgeous. Intelligent. War hero. She's bagged herself a right catch." Pansy turns to Harry. "You know muggles, Potter. What's the phrase I'm looking for?"
"It could be because I talk to the woman. We have lunch every other Monday. She handles my Ministry Oversight Portfolio."
"Oh, that's wonderful, Harry. But there's no need to rush yourself into anything. Take some time to rest, as well. In fact, I think the two of you should have a good, old-fashioned lie-in today."
"But Harry," Hermione cuts in, "you don't really need the money." He hears the unspoken 'so why would you waste your time?'.
Potter paled and his lip curled into a snarl. "Draco is fine." The vampire's words were forced out with vehemence.
“Besides, I’m afraid there won’t be much sunlight in my future.” Draco’s gaze sharpened on her. How much did she really know about Potter that she hadn’t given up? He picked at the knee of his trousers, banishing a piece of invisible lint. “Were you aware that he doesn’t go out in sunlight? When I mention potions for that, he became downright intractable.” Draco paused. “Frighteningly so.”
"This isn't about Owen," Hermione snaps before Harry has a chance to. She glares at him, and Harry knows full well she doesn't believe it. This is
His heart feels light and frothy with the warm happiness of companionship he thought he'd only ever find with Ron and Hermione. Now it appears his circle is growing, and his fondness for them all expanding with it at a rapidly increasing rate. He glances back to Draco, standing there looking elegant and perfect in his tailored suit. Draco winks at him and raises his glass in acknowledgment.
Draco walked in and ran his hand across the large desk against the wall, taking a look at the bookshelves that lined the room. A plush velvet settee sat toward the middle of the room on top of a large, well-worn rug. In the corner, a curtained portrait sat on an easel, surrounded by glass-fronted curio cabinets. A fireplace banked the far wall, with a great oak mantle over the top, flanked by picture frames and an intricately carved wooden box.
"Which are?" Harry leans forward. Narcissa Malfoy is one smart witch, and any insight she might have might as well be coming from Hermione Granger-Weasley, he's fairly certain.
"I won't stop there," Harry continues, and the deep timbre of his voice makes his next words sound like a commandment more than a promise. "No, before I'm done with you, I'm going to know what every inch of your skin tastes like. Inside and out. I bet if I flipped you over right now and stuck my tongue in your arse you'd come like a faucet."
Draco held up a hand, having anticipated this reaction from the moment he accepted the invitation. “It’s all right.”
Draco's cock twitches at his words, and his right hand moves to grip his erection. As the first touch, Draco hisses and his chin drops to his chest. But he complies, and his hand begins to stroke with hesitance, fingers curling lightly around the shaft.
Neville scoops her up bridal style and carries her back into her quarters. Behind him, the door ripples and slams shut on its own. Instead of a bang, it sounds like an exultation.
"Isn't it?" Harry says flippantly. He smiles into Zabini's face, like they're mates, like Harry's giving him the latest Quidditch scores over chips at the pub. The friendliness makes his tone all the more terrifying. "I defeated a Dark Lord. I came back from the dead. I am probably the greatest wizard of any recorded age. Do you really want to call my bluff?"
"I like you like this," Harry purrs. "Warm, mussed from sleep, looking satisfied, but still wanting. It had been a while, hadn't it? Coming like that?"
"I'm here, Mother. I read your letter, and I know now why you chose this for yourself. I won't pretend to not be hurt, because your loss means as much to me as mine did to you. But I understand." His left hand ached, both from the free-flowing cut that poured blood onto the stone floor and from the tight clench of his fingers, but he couldn't be bothered now to heal it. The wound to his heart was more important. "I understand, and I will never hold your choice against you, nor will I ever hear you disgraced because of it. You were the strongest woman I knew, yet also the most gentle, the most loving. That is what I will remember about you. That in dark times, you bent for no one, not Father, not even the Dark Lord, when you defied them all in saving Potter." He leaned forward and pressed his lips to the cold granite and whispered, "I forgive you."
"What? Oh, yes," Potter said, shaking an errant hand in the air. "Total mess. Me." He relaxed against the cushions and took a deep breath, composing himself. "For two weeks, I could barely get out of bed. And when I did, I exploded. I cursed you, I cursed myself, life in general. I think I destroyed the sitting room at least three times. I spent two days holed up in your lab, screaming at the top of my lungs. It didn't make me feel any better, but it annoyed Snape to no end, so that was something."
"No," he replies with a smile. "I'm saying that if you want these flowers to thrive, then you need to find what makes you happy. Or else you'll be resorting to digging in the dirt with the rest of us."
Neville's head tilts to the side, appraising her with a single glance. "These are magical plants. When you use magic on them, a bit of your magical signature rubs off them, like a residue. It clings to the very core of the plant and mingles with its inherent magic. And Trilling Roses are very susceptible to the emotions of their caretaker. They feed, in part, off your energy. So when you use your magic on them, it seeps in, and those emotions are fed to the plant." His voice drops. "Narcissa, if you're not happy, the plants will feel it. They'll know. And they will respond, or not, in kind."
"I have never seen my mother hug anyone but my father and myself," he says quietly, with a touch of awe. "I think I can safely say that I have seen everything in this life that there is to see." He sighs again. "Well done, Potter. I think Cook's about to get an earful to make sure everything is perfect for you."
Potter let out a non-committal hum as his hand fell away from Draco’s neck. He looked as if he had more to say, but the vampire’s features closed, returning back to the emotionless mask. Potter sat back, out of Draco’s personal space. “You should get dressed. There’s some things in the wardrobe that should fit. We’ll head to Gringotts for your key and then we should have enough time to get you to Diagon Alley for some new clothes before the shops close.”
"Blaise wanted more than I could provide, and he wanted something completely different. He is a sadist, through and through. While I—
Harry came downstairs to find Draco at the kitchen table, his profile backlit by the washed out overhead lights. He traced a long, aristocratic finger over the letter while the other hand lifted a half-full glass of red wine to his lips. He didn't look up as Harry approached the table.
"I am, because even dead, that man has his hooks in Draco's soul as surely as you do. If you keep this up, you will lose him, I guarantee it."
If he looked at it from the outside, it would look like nothing had changed between them, and they were back in the tent, planning and strategizing. If only that were the case.
She's in his arms in an instant, enfolding him in sweet jasmine and crinkly silk. Her hand is pressed to the top of his back, right between his shoulder blades. It's so comforting, so warm, this different fire that she incites to burn inside him.
Ron shoved back from the table and stared out the open door after his wife. The vampire’s voice made him turn.
Millie sounds remarkably like Pansy, only less-polished and with a bit more spite. Harry sips his pumpkin juice and smiles warmly at her.
Somewhere in the back of his mind, the sight should have sickened him and turned him cold, but his body didn’t seem to respond to that message. Instead, his hips met Potter’s, and the stiff arousal he found there kick-started his body into overdrive. Potter dropped Draco’s arm and his forehead fell onto Draco’s chest, his hands moving to clutch his hips while Potter panted against him. Arousal, unyielding and single-minded, erupted as Potter’s lower half rutted.
“As manly as this is, Ronald, I think Potter would prefer it if you let go of me,” Draco said loud enough for Potter to hear, keeping his gaze all the while.
Draco continues on his trek around the studio, glancing at Harry out of the corner of his eye every now and then. Harry keeps circling on the chair, tracking his every movement.
"I'm sorry, Father," he whispered. "I'm sorry I could never be the perfect son you expected. I'm sorry that I could never live up to what you wanted from me. I suppose if you knew the reason why I could never be that man, then you would understand why I failed so miserably at every turn. I guess if you had that probably would have killed you long before Azkaban ever could." He exhaled, breathing out the weight of his admission into the stale air of the crypt. "I had long given up on trying to make you proud of me. All I ever wanted was to be loved for what I was, not for what you thought I should be. I hope now you have found peace. Because at the end, that's all I really wanted for you."
The warmth and the pleasure were still there, traveling through his body, and Draco relaxed, letting Potter drink his fill. He moved his hand from Potter’s hair, threaded it underneath Potter’s arm to wrap around his back, and let his legs fall open. Potter scooted between them, and Draco drew his legs up a fraction to trap Potter between his thighs, offering the only security he had to give. Potter melted into his body on a revelatory sigh, and the bite deepened.
Draco is pliant beneath him, relaxed in only half the amount of time Harry thought it would take. Before he can relax any more, Harry eases off and smacks the crop hard against the luscious swell of Draco's arse. The crack of the blow echoes through the room, and Draco tenses and hisses at the strike.
He grunted as Potter slumped against him, still pressing hard against his body. He contemplated shoving the vampire off, but frankly, the post-orgasm buzz wouldn’t allow him to do much of anything except stand there and pant. Harry’s face turned from his lips and wedged at his neck, his breath still hot against his skin. The little voice in the back of mind told him he’d be a fool to move Potter now. Instead, his left arm came up and touched lightly at the back of Harry’s neck. Harry tensed, but relaxed after a second, and his hand clenched around Draco’s hip. He winced at the press of fingers. No doubt Potter had left his mark.
The cry rips out of him before he can stop it, and between one breath and the next, the pull of Apparition whisks him away.
Need pooled in his gut, spiraling out over his limbs and his cock, and he reached down to take himself in hand. He was batted away and received a sharp slap to the arse for his trouble.
Draco nodded, not in agreement, but distractedly as she spoke. If Potter’s behavior was atrocious as he was led to believe, then there was little chance that any Potions Master worth his salt wanted to be responsible for providing The-Boy-Who-Lived-To-Be-A-Fanged-Menace with a license to wreak havoc in daylight hours as well as dark. There had to be a solution. Giving Potter back the ability to go out in sunlight might alter his perceptions of his situation. Possibly a way for him to feel more normal. It was something Draco needed to look into. And soon.
Draco folds the now damp handkerchief and slides it across the bar to Potter. He knows he’s reading this right, but he still takes a steadying breath before he gives Potter a roguish grin. “You’re going to fuck me tonight, aren’t you?”
Heat, searing and affirming, shot through him, radiating through his undead body. A gift of affection, possibly something deeper, made Harry want to come alive. Because Draco was life. His eyes were bright stars. His pale blond hair shone like the rays of the sun. His laugh caused the heavens to awaken and spill its light across the horizon. But daybreak was forbidden to creatures of the night.
He stood, feeling emotion swirling in pit of his stomach. "No," he said firmly. "You're not worried. You're afraid."
Draco huffs and shakes his head. Out of the corner of his eye, Harry sees the bob of Draco's throat and the hang of his head. With a jerk, Draco flips around to face Harry, bracing his hands behind him on the table. His body leans forward, almost accusingly.
“I seem to remember you had a ravenous sweet tooth. Your mother sent you sweets to Hogwarts all the time.”
Water was pelting them both, and Potter didn’t seem to care that he was drenched from head to toe, nor did he seem to care that he had Draco pressed against the wall, with nothing between them but Potter’s wet pajamas.
He'd like to say that he's not outwardly affected at how hearing his given name rolls off Draco's tongue, but he is. It doesn't go unnoticed by Narcissa, either.
A discreet cough sounded from the doorway, and Potter shifted, turning his back to the door, as if to shield Draco from the intruding presence. The sensation was strangely protective, and yet oddly pleasing, and the thought resonated through his bones that Potter would spend the rest of his life standing sentry between Draco and the outside world. As if it was right where he belonged. Potter’s face lifted, and as their gazes crossed, the look of irritated puzzlement etched across Potter’s furrowed brow told him the same thought had occurred to the vampire.
"Mindless sex." Draco waves a dismissive hand in the air. "More of the same I experienced with Blaise. Ruthless Doms, violent ones. Some Muggle drugs. Potions, too. Those four months after my return are a bit of a blur. But I realized I needed help, so I went to a Mind Healer. Very discreet. Ravenclaw. It was very therapeutic. I learned a lot about myself. And I vowed never to get into a situation like that again." He stops and shoots Harry a sad smile. "If only for Mother's sake."
Harry tamped down his ire at her general intrusion and placed the magazine to the side. “You know why.”
Draco's head shook back and forth as Potter advanced, coming closer, and that was the one thing Draco didn't need.
The denigration in the way Zabini looks at Draco when he speaks undoes the last of Harry's resolve. He feels Draco's slight stiffening and without looking at him, Harry knows that even though the mask hasn't cracked, a gentle flush has crept into Draco's cheeks, betraying his supposed shame to Zabini's sadistic delight.
Harry slips his hand to rest at the small of Draco's back and urges him to the door. "So you were. Shall we?"
The finality of the statement has a second to linger in the air before Malfoy huffs in that old, familiar way, and rolls his eyes. "You're just going to hang out here and blunder about our lives until you," he makes sarcastic finger quotes in the air, "
But Potter must have had a few neurons firing in the right direction to recognize who was at the other end of the taut string of pleasure, because his mouth crashed down onto Draco’s, panting his name into Draco’s open mouth as he came in pulses of wet, slick heat.
“You said this was Walburga’s study?” Draco asked, determined to steer the conversation to less serious subjects.
“I seem to remember not so long ago when these halls were roamed by Dementors, meting out justice with a Kiss for crimes committed. He must be stopped,” Silverstri said with finality. “This is the only way to ensure his compliance.”
The second thing is: Potter has an absolutely filthy mouth. With his arms bracketing Draco’s head, he leans and whispers the dirtiest things Draco’s ever heard. It’s not normally something that does it for him, the dirty talk, but the base, crude pictures Potter keeps painting are striking a definite chord. The litany doesn’t stop, but then it turns softer, yet no less erotic. Draco’s never been sweet, and he’s certainly no boy, but when those words drip from Potter’s mouth onto his skin, something deep inside Draco
"Good." Harry lets the praise rumble out of his mouth like a purr. "Thank you." He breathes deeply and rocks back on his heels. "That wasn't so difficult, was it, Malfoy?"
"Harry! Oh, Merlin, fuck, Harry!" Draco's cock erupted between them as the coil of fire snapped, wringing his orgasm from him in white-hot pulses of flame. Potter was still latched on when his release found him, and his deep, dark groan of pleasure vibrated through Draco's body.
“I didn’t say there wasn’t risk involved,” she replied. “But I thought being able to walk out of here free would be enough to encourage you.” She spread her hands. “And that’s the truth. If you bind yourself to Harry and become his Consort, all charges against you will be dropped, your sentence overturned, and what’s left of your vaults will be returned to you. Now, the Manor was seized quite some time ago, and along with the rest of the Malfoy holdings, still remains property of the Ministry, but Harry has Grimmauld and his own vaults. Between the two of you, you’ve got enough to do whatever you want for the rest of your lives.”
“Yes,” he said rising. “Thank you. I’m on my way.” He turned to Hermione. “Always a pleasure, Hermione.”
Harry hates Apparition as much as he hates Floo travel. A fact made plain as he crumples to the floor on what appears to be a very expensive rug. A rug he's never seen before. Certainly not one at Grimmauld.
Harry feels his body shift to master control of his want, to project it outward, clearly, and with decisive intent. His voice drops low into a tone that he knows will brook no argument; it hasn't ever, not even with the most difficult of subs.
“I lost my brother,” George spat. “And I should hate you for it.” Draco saw the rage swimming in George’s eyes temper and soften as he cast a glance at Potter. “But I can’t,” he said, softer this time. “Because I may have lost a brother, but you’ve returned another. And there isn’t anything I can do but thank you for it.” With that, George swept Draco into a forceful hug. It lasted only a second or two before he reached out and grabbed for Potter, pulling him into the embrace.
It's such a precious thing, Draco's willingness to submit, and Harry has to grip the frame harder to keep his hands from wandering. This is about the kiss. The insistent press of lips on flesh, the flicker of tongue against sweat-cooled skin, the taste of the man beneath him. The intimacy that only kisses can bring.
Silvestri kept his eyes on Draco's, not bothering to acknowledge Harry with a glance. "And so you join us. Isn't that nice, Draco?" Draco whimpered pitifully as Silvestri's fingers slid across the marks on his neck. Instant rage blazed in Harry's eyes, but he kept a tight lid on his temper. If the other vampire sensed even a brief loss of control, he would strike. Maybe at Harry, maybe at Draco. It was a chance he wasn't willing to take. Not yet, anyway.
Ron scoffed and waved his hand as if he didn’t recognize the warning in Harry’s tone. Either that, or he was ignoring it.
In retrospect, Draco thinks a week really isn't that long. However, it's been a week to the day since Harry Potter dropped in and turned everything upside down. It's altogether maddening, and Draco's quite at sixes and sevens over the whole situation. Harry and his presence. Harry and his eyes. Harry and that damned domineering confidence. It's enough to drive anyone spare. It's enough to make Draco rethink the trajectory of his life. Or the course of his wants. He admits he's resigned himself to self-imposed celibacy. Because his experiences have not matched up to the needs of his soul. And now here's Harry, telling Draco he can have it all. It's ridiculous.
Draco kissed him again, cutting off Potter's question. The kiss was easier this time, softer, and Draco poured everything he had into it. He groaned into Potter's mouth, surprised when strong hands gently disengaged them.
“A touch queasy. I haven’t Apparated in quite some time. Wasn’t expecting that,” he confessed on a gasp, taking a deep, cleansing breath. He straightened and took a good look around. “Is this Grimmauld Place? I haven’t been here in ages.”
Draco stepped out onto the patio to find Molly sitting at a little outdoor table, pouring tea into cups from a sturdy, but well-kept teapot.
Draco's neck cranes upward to take in the structure. "Merlin's fucking balls, Harry. Just—" Draco's head snaps around to stare at him with desire. "Put me in it, yeah?"
“You need to eat. The first bite wasn’t enough.” Draco hoped the invitation in his words was clear, because somehow the thought of asking Potter to bite him wasn’t palatable at all. That would imply a measure of want on Draco’s part, and that was something he didn’t want to think about. Not ever. No, Potter was as stubborn as the day was long, and the idiotic Gryffindor would need to be prodded. Prodded like a surly old mule. Possibly with some kicking. Potter’s fangs and the deadly expression he had given Granger popped into his mind. But not tonight.
Malfoy's got that wand trained on him, but it's not Malfoy's wand, Harry knows, because Harry's still got it in a box under his bed at Grimmauld. This is one of those throwaway Ministry affairs given to parolees, a weak stick that doesn't do shit except for basic household spells. But Malfoy's face is set, holding that useless piece of wood like he would AK someone with it if he could, his body set into a defensive stance, with one hand reaching back behind him as if to shield another body. His mother's.
A year after that Draco sits at an upscale pub table across from his latest paramour, a stunningly gorgeous French transplant named Gilles, who is currently downing four galleon glasses of prosecco without batting an eyelash. This is his longest relationship by far (six months), and frankly it’s beginning to lose its luster.
Harry sips his coffee, and decides now that he's admitted to himself, there's no point in trying to hide it from Narcissa. "You're right, but I won't deny that I find him very attractive. In many ways."
Harry snorts out a breath and huffs out a short laugh as he shoots his eyes to the ceiling. It seems the house isn't through with him yet.
"War happened, Harry," Snape stressed, "and there wasn't anything else you could do. There wasn't anything else the rest of us could do, either. People died. It's sad and it's terrible, but it's the truth. The Dark Lord is to blame, not you."
Harry rises from the chaise with a whisper of satin as the dressing gown drags on the upholstery. Draco tracks every move as Harry crosses to stand in front of him. His face morphs into a shell of disdain.
"If you're trying for subtle," Harry says, addressing the room at large, "you're failing miserably."
It seemed relatively clean, although the first thing Draco noticed was the darkness. The windows were covered in heavy, black curtains that swallowed every ray of light that might even be thinking about coming through. Light came in a warm glow from the presence of lamps scattered about the room, bathing the space in shades of amber and yellow.
Harry knows if he waits, if he ignores it for now, Draco won't be able to stand it. The temptation to throw his carefully constructed mask in Harry's face will be too much for him, and Draco will instigate something. Because if nothing else, Draco is a hopeless instigator.
Draco maneuvers around the easel to stand just behind Harry's shoulder and quietly peruses the canvas. It's nothing like he's painted before—still lifes, an attempt at portraiture and the lot—but he's taken a step outside his box and created something he finds he's remarkably proud of. He's certain it isn't to popular esthetic, but that really means very little. The bright swirls of formless color speak to him in a way he's not going to bother to understand. Harry merely accepts the muse for what it is.
What gets to him the most is the slow and poignant nature of Narcissa's simple hug. It's not rushed, but savored, and carries more meaning that any hug ever given by Molly Weasley. Not that Harry doubts Molly's love, but her hugs are frantic and fierce, altogether short because she's moved on to another body to accost. There's a time limit, a rationing if you will, because Molly has so many to mother, so many to love. Narcissa just has Malfoy, but she makes Harry feel like she has him too.
“He can’t hurt you. I won’t let him.” The light in Potter’s eyes flashed. “I protect what is mine, Draco.”
"Sure thing," Ron muttered, shutting the door. He headed up the stairs, but paused when he reached Draco. The redhead leaned in and gave him an affectionate nudge to the shoulder. "Don't go easy on him, mate," Ron whispered. "He's been a miserable arse. Make him work for it, yeah?"
The fingers on his left hand curl and uncurl, and Harry knows exactly why. The Mark is a lot to make peace with, even if he professes he has. Harry still has nightmares about some of things he's done in the name of war; he can only imagine how Draco must be struggling to reconcile himself as well.
“Yes,” she hissed. “I can. I can’t make Harry’s decisions for him, but I can damn well give him the best shot at making smart ones.”
Draco relaxed and Potter shifted to get comfortable, rustling and wiggling like an animal burrowing in its nest. A knee thrust its way between Draco’s thighs, and Potter’s leg wound around his ankles, hooking them together from head to toe. Warm breath fluttered over his ear, and the sharp rise and fall of Potter’s breathing had evened out. Potter murmured, so soft he almost missed it.
Potter’s gaze is intense, powerful, and utterly unsettling. But there is no ego in his voice when he says, “Probably.”
"Ten inches," Potter said with a sinister smile. "Hawthorn. It'll do." With that, Potter plunged Draco's wand, point down, into the gaping hole of Silvestri's chest. The vampire shrieked in pain, and Potter growled, "
