She crossed her arms, “Then you would know that it said first full moon
She brightened—she knew where Dumbledore was, right this second. She knew where he was, and he was alone. She had no appointment and it was five-thirty in the morning, but was she likely to get an appointment any time today? Most likely not. Maybe it would make a good impression that she was up very early—showed determination.
Several Slytherins around her stared but she ignored them, plucking the book out of Hades’ hands. He let it go easily, as if though he wasn’t actually reading it and simply using it as a way to avoid social interactions. He stared at her and she smiled, “Hello.”
“Right,” He said. When the grass turned to sand, she pulled her small heeled shoes off, feeling a lure from the water some ways beyond them. “While we’re here, we should get some extra water—” She didn’t hear the rest as she had darted forward, at some point dropping her bag and shoes on the sand in the process. “And there she goes.” She heard faintly in an exasperated voice.
When it was time, Persephone walked down to the end-of-the-ear feast alone that night, later than she was meant to be. Madame Pomfrey held her up with fussing and a last minute checkup so when she walked into the Great Hall, it was full. Unfortunately, it was decked out in Slytherin colors to celebrate Slytherin’s winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row. Any seventh year Slytherin student had now seen their entire schooling years filled with Slytherin winning every year. A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table.
"Hope you have—er—a good holiday," said Hermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant. “Call me, will you?”
“How did you
Standing by the woman’s side was a tall, thin man, built healthy and lanky and he, too, was crying. He had hazel eyes, eyes of different colors, behind a pair of glasses. His hair was untidy and black, his skin tanned, olive complexion. But his eyes…but her own eyes…
‘Red for energy, passion and action—I think,’ She thought to herself when she saw the Gryffindor table themed red. She couldn’t quite remember what red stood for exactly. Green, for Slytherin, stood for life, nature, jealousy and money. Something of revival, always full of energy.
This is so long and so messy?? But I wanted it to be messy because Persephone is not being herself is she?
She nodded, “Same guy.”
I'll eat myself if you can find
‘Why? Who was the professor?’
She could be with Daphne, as a plus, though she was sure Daphne was still upset. Her stomach turned over at the thought of her being upset at Persephone. Daphne was not someone she was willing to lose because a boy…but that boy was Hades and he needed her, or seemed to, as he was going to a funeral with his biological family…but then there was Daphne. She didn’t want to choose between the two…not Hades, and not Daphne…pretty, astonishing Daphne, with the way she spoke and the way her hair looked in the sun…She might go mad if Daphne didn’t speak to her again…
They walked to the Great Hall together and Hades turned, “Where are you going?”
“Would you look at how sweet,” Draco smirked. “Two outcasts who match right up.”
“I will not take any points from Gryffindor,” she said, and Persephone’s heart lightened considerably. “But you will both get a detention.”
The girl blinked, “We met when I liked the name Selene. Though a name doesn’t truly change a person—not really.”
"Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?"
“We know all redheads.”
“My eyesight is slightly better, yes,” She told him. “No stinging—it’s still blurry however.”
"Take him up to the hospital wing," Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Ron, who had been working next to Neville.
Her Salem was very content with Persephone—being as she was still so small, she required a lot of her attention. She kept her in her bedroom at all times and planned on finding a way to sneak her into Hogwarts, one way or another.
“It’s the full moon,” He said. “And you’re in the middle of the forest, about to kill Draco Malfoy—look, I know he’s annoying but that doesn’t give you the right to—”
Suddenly, three boys ran in—it was Ron, George and Fred!
After she was well versed in identifying her potions ingredients and what a bezoar was, she would just sit with her owl. She’d decided to call her Hedwig, a name she had found in
, 1999, about the ‘Magic of Animals’. It was an article about owls suddenly sweeping all through London, all through England. She was starting to lose hope when something from the above windows just next to her flickered. A shadow passed over the window. When she looked up in confusion, looking for what had caused the natural light to flicker, she nearly choked in surprise.
“Neville, have you seen the candy lady—oh!” The girl’s eyes finally looked at Persephone and she stopped in her sentence. The girl had perfectly straight hair, cut just below her ears with a distinctly button nose. Her dark eyes lit up in curiosity as her flitted up to Persephone’s forehead. “Hello.”
She first noticed it in Charms. Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Persephone’s name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.
When she showed up to the second portion of the audition, she immediately noticed a new group of girls talking loudly. And, tallest of the group, was Pansy Parkinson.
Oh! Of course! The Restricted Section of the library! She checked her watch—it was barely midnight. She could read for hours…first priority was Flamel but she had a key to the kingdom, she could take her time.
Ben was the one to answer, “Four-fifty a week,” He said absently. She moved her stare to Ben . He met her stare and looked away.
Then, after dinner, Persephone sat on her bed, brushing out her wet hair. She thought a shower would help but she still felt terrible. Someone knocked and called, “Come in.”
The troll stopped, peering inside and Persephone noticed it was slowly looking at the wall—it hadn’t noticed them. Persephone pushed Hermione slowly, as not to move too fast, but then it saw them. They froze. The troll looked at them in surprise.
“No can do, Sephie,” Hagrid grunted suspiciously. "So—yeh wanted to ask me somethin'?" He changed the subject.
But if you would move onward, neither is your friend;
“No way, Dumbledore will find a way to help her.”
The shopkeeper was expecting them, and a young intern boy escorted them from the front counter to the back. From there, they took a specialized, prefixed floo fireplace. Persephone, with a bad enough experience with floo powder, decided against tagging along with Hades when offered. Daphne was going with her sister and she was sure she wouldn’t be too happy with Persephone taking the floo powder with Hades. She would rather go alone than with Pansy or Draco, and that’s exactly as she did.
Now, on Christmas Eve, with most urgent things out of the way, she could simply lay in bed, alone in the dorm, waiting for morning to come. Christmas at the Dursleys had never been a fun time. She had the hardest time remembering what exactly Christmas was at the Dursleys, probably because she was good at supressing those memories, but it usually was good food (or it would be, if she got enough to enjoy) and second-hand clothes. Maybe, if she were lucky, she’d get new shoes. Aunt Marge would be there, and she would get drunk and that’s usually when Persephone’s memory would cut off.
She kneeled down, her arms both now outstretched—it was draining her quicker than usual, now as she felt the resistance—when Uncle Vernon walked in and his eyes widened at the scene. Persephone finally reached out and caught the pudding as the air became normal once more.
The cherry on top, she felt anger surge through her. She had had enough of people telling what she was and wasn’t able to do—who and what she was and she was done with it. Had any
—oh for the love of god! Why—was this really—a
When they were let in, he shut the door quickly behind them and they were immediately hit with the heat wave of the inside. It was a nice warm day outside so it made no sense for there to be a blazing fire in the grate or to accept the tea. It was too hot.
They started stumbling up a passageway in the rock on the Hagrid's heels, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.
“The first brother traveled on for a week or more, and reaching a distant village, sought out a fellow wizard with whom he had a quarrel. Naturally, with the Elder Wand as his weapon, he could not fail to win the duel that followed. Leaving his enemy dead upon the floor, the oldest brother proceeded to an inn, where he boasted loudly of the powerful wand he had snatched from Death himself, and of how it made him invincible.
He hummed, hiding his wand back up his sleeve, “Shall we?”
While she went to war with her thoughts, "Brocklehurst, Mandy" was sorted into Ravenclaw and “Brown, Lavender" became the first new Gryffindor. The table she assumed to be the Gryffindors exploded with cheers; Persephone could see Ron's (twin) brothers catcalling.
“An accident,” She muttered, knowing he would hear her.
You might belong in Gryffindor,
“Aren’t mermaids—I don’t know, genetic? Don’t they pass those things down?”
Wood practiced with her—he hit gold clubs her way and she didn’t miss a single one, much to his pleasure.
Persephone was just about bursting in excitement—Ron was taking too long to even acknowledge her present. She finally dragged the long box up onto the bed and pointed at it. Ron, still being half-asleep, barely looked at it as he opened it but then had to blink several times in shock before he could properly see it. Then his jaw fell open and she smiled, “Lily what is this?”
She wasn’t sure if she ought to be sad that George and Fred stopped asking her to sneak out with them but now they brought her back snacks from the kitchens, dumping them in her lap in the common room as she told Ron about the dreams.
Persephone watched her, before she turned to stare into the fire.
"What on earth were you thinking of?" said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. "You're lucky you weren't killed. Why aren't you all in your dormitories?"
"Who?"
He stood by her, close enough that she could make out only the more obviously more prominent parts of his face but not close enough where she could see his face.
She took to helping Mrs. Weasley with the dishes, which Mrs. Weasley found very dear of her. While they worked, she recounted stories of her summer to her questions. Mrs. Weasley listened to her, smiling at her in encouragement every so often. She was just finishing about the Fountain of Neptune when the door opened and in walked a stranger.
“I’d say a rematch is in order,” Freddie said, laughing. Hermione was wringing out her skirt and Hades performed a quick drying spell.
“Today’s your birthday,” he sneered. “And you haven’t gotten any cards from your freak friends from that place.”
She barely made it far when Voldemort screamed, “SEIZE HER!” and the next second, Persephone felt Quirrell's hand close on her wrist. At once, a needle-sharp pain seared across Persephone’s scar; her head felt as though it was about to split in two; she yelled, struggling with all her might, and to her surprise, Quirrell let go of her. The pain in her head lessened—she looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers—they were blistering before his eyes.
Now that she could tell which table belonged to Hufflepuff and which belonged to Ravenclaw, and Gryffindor was easy enough to spot (she saw the twins’ red hair bobbing at that table with red themed uniforms), she could now see over to the Slytherin table—green. Maybe it was her imagination but she thought they did not look too pleased—no, it was probably just her imagination.
She watched them go, unable to say anything but, “What the hell?”
Persephone had to pull Susan along, as she was stunned in place, staring in awe at Lockhart. However, before she could take a step, Lockhart intercepted, “Ah, Persephone Potter! I’ve been meaning to have a word with you. You don’t mind if she’s only a few minutes late, do you Professor Sprout?”
“What was it like?” Ron asked.
Now, with both their robes and uniforms on—Ron’s pants and robes just a tad short on him at the heels—a voice echoed through the train:
She was stunned at how good he could look if he actually tried. He looked like Superman. Or perhaps a well-dressed Clark Kent, the only superhero she’d ever had a crush on. It was…hilarious.
“I´ll take the pinot noir then. Thank you.” he said. Potter ordered the same.
, he thought and straddled Blaise’s lap without hesitation. Hands reached to cup the beautiful face and instead of feigning uncertainty, Draco pressed his lips to Blaise’s, devouring the familiar mouth in a way he knew would drive Blaise mad.
Realizing that Harry was probably awaiting an answer from him, Draco hastily said, “That’s great. That it went well I mean.” He couldn’t pry his eyes away from those rosy lips, his arms hung loosely at his side.
Draco goes to the kitchens and Harry gets some screen time
They stood in silence for a while longer, soaking in the comfort of the other’s presence.
Draco turned at the admission. “What about Hannah?” He was pretty sure that she and Neville had been dating only a few weeks ago, he had thought they were dating still, with how close the two of them still were.
Draco has some emotional talks and eats food.
“To unity!” Hermione toasted, raising her shot, and the group followed her example.
“Mmmh. W’s a dare” Harry slurred, cuddling deeper into Draco’s embrace and closing his eyes.
It had been an uneventful Tuesday until he saw Potter just before he entered the shop. He was alone this time and Draco commented on his missing side kick once the Gryffindor had reached the counter.
Before he could start hyperventilating again, he reached for his wand and canceled the straightening charm, letting his hair return to the natural waves. But it wasn’t enough. He could still see his father looking back at him from the mirror. Without thinking too long about it, Draco conjured a pair of scissors.
“Love? We’re waiting for you.”
Harry slowly stood up again, his hands going back to his jeans and as he watches, Draco reaches a hand down to his cock. He was already so close he could probably come from just watching the Adonis of a man undress himself.
Draco thought about lying, thought about saying no, but Potter deserved the truth. So he reluctantly nodded and immediately wished he didn’t. The regret in those green eyes was almost unbearable.
Over the years he added some more figures to his collection and now also had a mermaid, a pixie even a thestral, though the latter went by the name pegasus once they lay in his display; he was living in a muggle neighbourhood after all. He sang along to the radio while he rolled out the dough and cut the cookies.
“Don’t ask, you know I only went out of courtesy.” Potter mumbled. A bit clearer he added, “What are you all doing?” Blaise took it upon himself to get Potter up to speed.
So for the first time since they left the castle, Harry went to bed alone. A corner of his brain was wondering where Malfoy was at this time of night. They hadn’t officially been set a curfew — since all of the eighth years were of age and after the war it would have been a farce anyway — but it still didn’t seem right for Malfoy to be out on his own all day and not having returned by nearly midnight.
He cleaned the kitchen while he waited for the dough to rise but in the end he simply put a delayed stasis charm on the whole bowl and went back upstairs. While the kneading had indeed helped him clear his head, it had also left him covered with flour and he needed a shower before bed.
“I appreciate the effort and may overlook your tardiness. Now where are you taking me?”
— so each practice fight — you have to bow to your partner as a sign of respect and sportsmanship. You will start on my commando
Draco takes the vial from him and asks, “What’s your safeword?” With only a second hesitation Harry answers, “Umbridge”. Understanding crosses the grey eyes and Draco nods. “I’d normally ask you to pick a non-verbal one too, since I am going to choke you - even if I am only going to restrict your blood flow and not your air supply. But I think tapping out will work for the both of us. Correct?”
His nerves apparently soothed, Harry ducked out of Draco’s embrace only to pull him towards the pillows and blankets. Moments after Draco had sat down on one of the dark green pillows that was big enough to cover half of his body, Harry pulled out multiple dishes from the basket, narrating as he went.
“Care to explain?” Pansy asked pointedly.
Harry kissed his cheek and Draco in turn moved to catch his lips with his own once more. Their first official kiss as boyfriends started sweet enough, but as both were reluctant to break it and sitting side by side was rather straining on their necks, it turned heated rather quickly when Draco switched from sitting next to Harry to straddling him.
“You coming?”
“You also were tortured. You were on the other end of those curses, felt them.” came Potter’s quiet reply, his hand still gently touching Draco’s elbow.
Without bothering to look at Draco once more, Morgon Morris left his office, leaving the still panting student behind.
Sweet Merlin. He had cuddled Malfoy.
At least that was what Harry told himself after waking to a sleeping Draco cuddling him for the third time in five days. A quick tempus told him that it was early enough to justify going back to sleep again, at least for a little bit. So instead of gently extracting himself from the arm placed around his middle, he stayed, snuggling back into the covers and fell back asleep.
“When?” Weasley nearly screeched. “HOW?!”
Looking up, he was met with the now questioningly raised eyebrows of his friends.
It had taken 48 for Harry to touch him again.
Harry hadn’t made any note-worthy mistakes and Draco wasn’t sure if it was due to his broadened theoretical knowledge or if Harry wasn’t as bad at potions as he had formerly believed. They had spent the past fifty minutes mostly in concentrated silence, but now the potion needed to simmer for another twenty and there was little to concentrate on.
Harry returned to the living room with two mugs precariously stacked on top of each other and an arm full of alcohol. Malfoy’s shoes stood neatly next to the couch while the owner had pulled his feet up onto it. The odd domesticity of the whole situation left Harry speechless but nonetheless he sat down in one of the armchairs, A flick of his wand lit a fire in the fireplace.
“Wand!” Morris barked under the pretense of checking the spell history for any magic Draco wasn’t allowed to cast while on parole. But Draco knew better than that by now. Morris would take the wand, check it, and find absolutely nothing illegal. Then he would keep the wand for the rest of their meeting, leaving Draco even more defenseless.
Their rutting increased until Harry broke the kiss in favour of throwing his head back and moaning, a low rumble spreading from his chest. The sound of Harry lost in pleasure sent Draco over the edge as well, and he came with stuttering hips and a low groan.
“Some bondage, some sensory play, some light impact play, although I am not the biggest fan of it.  Some dynamic stuff of course, but nothing exceeding the session. Some praise.”
I didn't actually plan on making Morris this horrid but it somehow happened so... Sorry I guess? At least it doesn't end that bad??
Harry lay his hand on top of Draco’s, “I like you, you fool” the dark haired man said softly, and Draco felt his heart skip a beat.
“Because I’m me.” Harry bemoaned. “Because it will be a big deal once the paper catches wind of it.” A short pause, as if he was unsure of whether he should tell the next part or not. “Because I like this guy and I don’t want the papers accusing him of ‘turning me gay’ or imperius-ing me.”
“Parkinson, truth or dare” the Ravenclaw asked, which Pansy answered with “Truth, I suppose.” Terry assessed her for a moment. “Tell us an embarrassing childhood memory of yours.” Pansy was silent for a few seconds and then smiled slightly.
A low chuckle escaped Draco. “How lucky that our friends keep each other busy enough to not notice us sneaking off. And if they do, we can just say that we are doing potions stuff.” Draco reached for Harry’s hand, entwining his fingers with his own.
There is only the epilogue left to go and I will hopefully get to that in the next few days. As always: Tell me your thoughts, I love to hear them.
Dropping his backpack behind the counter, Draco took his apron off the little hook, put it on and hung his button down in the vacated spot before going into the back.
Harry spent all evening and night thinking about the Amortentia and of course about Malfoy. The ever circling thoughts about him shifted and Harry began thinking about the small dimple on Draco’s left cheek when he smiled, how his hand had felt around his wrist, how his lips formed his name. A memory wiggled itself in the forefront of his thoughts, a memory of kissing a blond muggle in a club last summer — the nameless and, at this point, faceless muggle man being swapped with Draco and suddenly Harry couldn’t stop thinking about it. He imagined what it would feel like to pull Draco closer, pressing his lips against his, tasting him. The smell of the Amortentia flooded back into his mind and Harry felt himself falling asleep to the memory of it.
. Even if he hadn’t said Harry’s name, he had begged to be fucked. No wonder he had been scared, he had unwillingly handed Harry a very personal secret and he didn’t even really know it.
“Do you prefer to top or to bottom?”
They were silent for a moment, before Harry timidly spoke up again. “I told her about you,” he admitted.
it. Merlin and Morgana, this was Malfoy! He definitely shouldn’t be getting hard listening to him, but his body betrayed him.
“Uhm. No.” Draco admitted only then realizing his lack of plan. “I’m not really set on a motive yet, but I want it to cover something else.” His brain was already running through possible ideas he hadn’t known he had.
David interrupted their tender moment with a malicious grin. “Everything alright here? Can I bring you anything else?”
Once again they grapple but instead of letting Harry push him down again, Malfoy uses one of Harry’s tries to swing himself around and pull Harry on top of him, his pale hands locking themselves into Harry’s collar. Harry feels the pressure on his neck tighten a smidge but never enough to actually choke him. On his back he feels Malfoy’s heartbeat where they’re pressed together.
“Draco. Last night was nice and all, but I am no longer interested in being with you that way.”
“Well yes, but have you considered the effects of the previously added thibethian mint?
In the end, neither of them said anything and Potter excused himself, going back the way he came. Draco finally turned the last corner and let himself into the common room, he wanted to get started on the Herbology essay right away.
He debated not acknowledging her for a moment before he could practically hear Pansy say, “Promise me to try Draco”. So he said a low “Hello Granger” to his parchment and continued writing.
“There are wards that will alert me if you are hit with a spell or if you say ‘Fawkes’,” as promised wards shimmered around the room at the use of the trigger word. “While you have nothing to fear from Gemma, your reaction is understandable.”
The sudden restriction of his blood flow in combination with his already overly sensitive neck and the slight burn of Draco entering him, makes Harry see stars. His vision goes hazy around the edges and Harry feels like he is floating through a sea of pure lust. Reality slams back into him as Draco bottoms out and loosens the grip on his neck, letting the blood flow freely again.
When she reentered the room a few moments later, she found the men laying on the bed. Blaise lay on his back and Draco had curled himself into his side, his head on the other’s chest. Both were silent but Blaise had taken to running his fingers through the blond hair. Pansy silently joined them, spooning Draco.
It was only when Draco had closed the door to his room and was lying on his bed that he realised that he had just eaten a whole meal in the Great Hall, and the world hadn’t ended.
On Friday morning Harry woke with the certainty that he had gone and fallen for his former nemesis without realising it.
Thinking of his newest revelation from last week, Draco took his shot and sneaked a glance to his left, where Harry sat. He too was putting his glass back down. Draco’s heart sped up without him wanting it to.
“No!” Draco exclaimed, almost too loud. “I’d.. like that. Us, I mean.”
After the fourth button he begs, “Draco, please. Let me! Please!”
No one batted an eye when they entered and so they strode towards the eighth year table. Pansy and Hermione scooted over to let the two of them join them at the table and when Draco looked into the proud eyes of his best friend, he knew he had made the right choice.
“Fair point, I will give you that. Nonetheless I am willing to help you now and I am here of my own accord so stop being a prick and give me your hand, you’re shivering,” Harry demanded and Draco wanted to resist, but Harry unceremoniously grabbed his arm and pulled Draco’s hand into his own. The moment their skin touched, Draco felt at ease again. A low sigh escaped him.
“Don’t worry. You must have had that for over a year now and at this point I can’t really say I miss it,” Blaise said, managing to quell Draco’s unsaid worries. Looking Draco up and down one more time he continued, “Keep it. It looks good on you.”
He spread the slickness that appeared on his fingers over the other’s rim and pulled Harry back into a searing kiss with his other hand. Inserting a finger into Harry left Draco’s hand at a weird position, but he ignored the angle of his wrist and pushed his finger deeper into the man on top of him.
“You act as though you haven’t seen me in weeks, even though I am certain we saw each other just half an hour ago.” Draco grumbled into her hair but wrapped his arms around her nonetheless. Once Pansy released him, he turned his attention to Luna and Weasley, bowing slightly to the red head. “Weasley. My formal apologies for the continued problems and pain caused by me and my actions. I am deeply sorry.”
“Is that Malfoy?”
“What are your plans for right now?” Potter asked, once he reached him.
And then he had been marked, and as the pain had spread from his arm to encompass his whole body — his whole being — the only thing he could think was, ‘I don’t want this’. But by that point, it was too late.
“Fucking finally,” groaned Harry “I’ve looked into six other compartments. One would think the younger years had somewhat gotten used to me over the pa-” he broke off, having spotted Draco. Pansy sniggered at his open mouth, completely ignoring her own previous shock at the transformation.
At this ridiculous statement Draco’s head shot up to stare at Potter in confusion.
Harry’s head snapped up fast enough that he nearly lost his hat. Draco had blushed too, his hands shoved into his coat pockets, but his face showed a clear invitation. Almost shyly did Harry step forward, a gloved hand reached up to cup the porcelain face, his body leaned forward a bit.
3. While we’re on the topic of spell casting: There will be a compulsion spell cast on every player, which
“No. I meant the piercings.” he clarified, motioning towards the bar going across her upper ear. Lucius would have hated them.
“You want to willingly spend time. With ME.” the Slytherin emphasized incredulously. They stared at each other for a few seconds before Potter looked down, his hand scratching at his neck.
Potter had come surprisingly far in Potions, or so Draco thought when the group was sitting at their usual table in the corner of the common room, discussing their potions assignment. The points he was making were logical and founded and even though he was lacking some in-detail knowledge of some plants, Draco had to admit that Potter wasn’t necessarily the worst at potions anymore.
“Good morning my dear students. We will continue our journey into palm reading today. I will ask all of you to please check under your seat to find out who you will partner with for today's lesson. It is important to work with the auras of different people to sufficiently train your inner eye. Please check now. Oh and Mister Longbottom, please remember to write to your Grandmother. I can see a howler coming your way by Friday if you don’t.” Trelawney monologued, knocking into a chair on her way back to her table.
to tutor you?” The question was tentative and Draco hated the hint of hope in it. He didn’t know which answer he was hoping for.
“I don’t have one!” Draco whimpered, his voice betraying how close he was to tearing up.
“I- no. It is not your responsibility to keep track of what makes me freak out. You couldn’t have known so there is no need to apologise.” Draco began.
But between his homework and his nightmares, he was lucky if he got more than four hours of sleep at night. The circles underneath his eyes were dark and even a glamour couldn’t hide them completely.
In an effort to meet as few people as possible, Draco had apparated to London with almost half an hour to spare, but when he stepped onto the Platform it was already quarter to eleven.
“Bottom” Harry answers, way too quickly for his own liking. Playing it cool he adds, “At least if the top knows what he’s doing.”
including levers and choke holds. “And remember, if anyone chokes their partner out, they’ll have to bring cake to our next training as well as a whole page on the principles of this sport.”
“I need to apologise to you,” Draco said in a low voice, hands shoved deep into his coat pockets. “I was a complete prick to you in school and my… political views… were more than just problematic. I’ve worked hard to change since then, but it doesn’t excuse what I did and believed in during our childhood, nor what I did during the war.
“Wha-.. How?” Harry blurted out. Malfoy hadn’t even taken out the book.
“Hey, I heard Thomas and Longbottom talk about some market in town and I really wanna go.” Draco said, sounding slightly more awake.
Draco hurried through the hallways. Dinner was almost done and he had no wish to stumble across more people than strictly necessary. His parole meeting had dragged on for what seemed like forever, and he was tired. The blonde’s thoughts were racing.
During his third training session, Malcolm surprises them with a new exercise.
Harry tries to use his legs to gain enough momentum to shake Malfoy off, but the blond simply grabs the arm closest to him and pulls it into a lever. Harry taps out.
Confused, Draco asked, “Why?”
— invited him anywhere.
“Merlin, please warn me the next time you decide to simply drink my creations. I nearly had a heart attack watching you drink that.”
Please tell me your thoughts on this sstory or chapter, I'd love to hear what all of you think now that it is finally complete.
(See the end of the chapter for
He took a deep breath, clutching the strap of his bag and opened the door to the library. There were only a handful of students present, all scattered across the different tables, and none of them looked up upon his entry. As quietly as possible he headed to the astronomy section and got his book.
Immediately he felt his cheeks heat against the cold winter air and he looked at his feet. His mind raced to find a way to take it back, find something to say to make it seem like he was joking, but before he could think of anything useful it got interrupted by a slightly shaky, “Then do it.”
Hermione did know multiple diagnostic charms. Neither Pansy nor Draco tried to follow her after the first complicated wand movement accompanying the string of what was probably Latin.
Draco talks to Pansy and gathers the courage to face a group event.
Harry’s hips bucked up, searching for more friction and finding it immediately, causing both men to moan. The contact wasn’t enough and Harry desperately slid his hands into Draco’s back pockets, pulling him closer still.
Harry straps his belt around his
Within seconds of meeting her, Draco felt less anxious. The friendly smile and warm attitude he was met with were rare outside of the eighth years common room and it was refreshing to meet someone that didn’t already know him, although Healer Hay- Gemma had most likely heard about Draco before.
“No I´m serious! The asshole was so mad at me getting more recognition than him, he acutally threw a temper tantrum. With stomping and flinging himself to the floor and all!”
“Might I suggest a turquoise?” Narcissa proposed, causing Draco to whip his head to her. “It would portray you as more of a rebel against your former beliefs rather than just hiding from them. Plus it would suit the general… style you seem to favour nowadays.” Despite her best efforts she couldn’t stop from scrutinizing the fashionably ripped jeans Draco had put on that morning.
“So, I don’t know if you’ve heard of it yet, but there are talks about another get-together after the Hogsmeade trip. Mostly the same people as last time, but I still wanted to tell you in advance in case you needed the time to mentally prepare yourself for it.” Hermione said.
While Draco didn’t explain any of that, McGonagall seemed to understand it regardless. With a small nod she acknowledged his request. That left Draco with his original issue, the one plaguing him nearly the whole time since his last talk with the professor.
Taking a few deep breaths she began more calmly, “Look, I know you won’t believe me, but the other Eighth years aren't so bad okay? Apparently Granger and Potter had some talk with them about forgiveness, and they almost treat Blaise and I normally.”
Once again Draco was the first of the study group to sit down but he was quickly joined by Hannah, Neville and Blaise, the three of them sitting in their usual spot across from him, leaving the space next to him for Hermione and Pansy.
And then it clicked. Harry was looking at his grandparents. This was a part of his heritage, a part he formerly hadn’t had. With tears in his eyes he looked at the other pictures.
Harry blushed and scratched his neck before hastily clarifying “I mean, I already ate, but there is dinner for you and there’s also some hot chocolate, and we could cuddle next to the fireplace…” He trailed off, looking lost and anxious.
There were a few whispers throughout the room  when the first students began leaving but to Draco’s surprise, none of them were really hateful. Curious maybe but not hateful. Terry Boot mumbled something that might have been insulting if Draco had heard it, which he didn’t. Nonetheless Draco was well aware of Boot disliking him. The Ravenclaw wasn’t exactly quiet about it.
Harry scoffed and assured him that he hadn’t intended to do that anyway and stated, “The memory you’re currently using isn’t enough.”
In his room Draco threw himself down on his bed. Curled into a ball on top of his satin-covered duvet, the tears finally broke out of him, accompanied by the sobs that managed to find gaps in his erratic breathing.
Harry felt guilty. Even though Draco had never complained about keeping their relationship secret, Harry knew that it stressed him. Knowing that Draco was likely to wait in one of the alcoves for an answer, Harry reached into his bag once more to pull out the map and cloak. After checking that the hallway was clear and Draco was indeed waiting two corridors down, he excited the bathroom.
Thursday marked the first day since their kiss on Monday that Harry made any kind of acknowledgement to the fact that they had been kissing. The two of them were seated at the smaller separate table that Draco and Harry had grown accustomed to using during the study group sessions, and Harry had cast a muffliato almost immediately after sitting down.
“As long as you aren’t actually pulling hard enough to pull my hair out I am fine with it. I actually kinda like it, if the pull is relatively light. Your limits?”
He wouldn’t have to sit through another 15 instances of being interrogated, insulted or assaulted. He was free. Or at least he felt free. Meeting with Professor McGonagall didn’t seem impossible, it didn’t even seem bad. Hadn’t he started confiding in her weeks ago?
After his initial high, Draco was left with one question.
“About that favour...” Pansy said, while shoving two sandwiches into Draco's hands. He had known she would collect that favour, but so soon? It was only Monday evening.
“They’re archetypes. Jupiter stands for leader, Mars for warrior. The upper and lower differentiate between physical and emotional war.” Malfoy explained absentmindedly, eyes focussed on Harry’s hand. A moment later he caught himself, “Do keep up Potter. Trelawney talked about it last lesson.”
Draco reaches up with his right hand, closing his fingers around Harry’s neck while careful not to push pressure on the windpipe and guides his cock into Harry.
AHHH. It is finally DONE! I can't really believe it yet?? Somebody please pinch me?!
The butterflies in his stomach were beating up a storm and his heart was racing along to the beat of their wings. Despite rationally knowing that Harry liked him, he was nervous that the answer might be ‘no’.
Draco could only nod. The dread of his upcoming meeting was already sucking all the energy and confidence from him, and it hadn’t even started yet. With a last deep breath he grabbed the offered floo powder and stepped into the fireplace. With a quiet “Ministry of Magic” he vanished into the green flames.
Draco goes to therapy and talks with Harry.
Pinching the bridge of her nose, Pansy interrupted her, “I know, I know. It’s just not my favourite thing to do. Most of these texts have already been translated so many times, I don’t see why I need to do it again.”
A moan escapes Harry at those words and he involuntarily bucks his hips up. Draco tsks disapprovingly and uses his knees to pin Harry’s hips down, while his left forearm pushes Harry’s shoulders into the backrest, effectively rendering him immobile. Harry has to bite his lips to stop another moan from escaping.
He was just about to reach up to stroke his hands through the black curls, when the timer chimed to signify that the potion was ready. Both of them flinched at the noise and they pulled apart. Desperately pulling himself together, Draco cast a few diagnostic charms on the potion and deemed it acceptable.
Despite her remorse at knowing his past, Draco was relieved. If she knew about his trial, then he wouldn’t have to repeat those parts at least. Despite knowing his past, she chose to offer him help and despite his mistakes, she was friendly to him. Deciding to take the leap and trust her, Draco leaned back and opened himself to her.
Pansy draped her skirt over her knees as she sat cross-legged across from him. She resolutely didn’t meet his eyes. “I kind of have a… date? Or something?”
“Come on Draco.You have to admit you can’t avoid the Hall forever. It’s not good for you.” And Draco had to admit that she was right, he couldn’t avoid the Hall forever. But maybe for a little bit longer.
“No, I just… fainted.” Draco answered vaguely.
“I’m bisexual, you know?” Harry rushed out, in an effort to get the awkward part over with.
Belatedly, Harry realised that his side of the bed faced the hallway, not the bathroom.
Malcolm answers the questioning looks of his trainees the moment the official ritual part ended.
“Had sex with a man? Yes. I am a bachelor not a monk.”
The third floor in the west tower had an abandoned classroom which hadn’t been used for at least a few decades, judging by the layer of dust and grime. Draco had cleaned the room and transfigured two of the chairs into a couch. There he lay, desperately trying to calm his breathing.
“I´m not worried about the food. If the wine selection is anything to go by, the food will be adequate enough. Doesn´t answer my question though. Where are we? Why don´t I know this place?”
Finally allowing himself solace in his mothers touch, Draco leaned back into her hand, concentrating on sorting through his jumbled emotions, focussing on calming and breathing.
“Oh come on. You didn’t really think I’d let you off the hook just because I like you,” Draco teased, “No boyfriend of mine is failing Potions!”
It felt like years rather than months since their first kiss on the exact same sofa. Between Christmas and the end of winter holidays they had spent nearly all their time on this sofa, reading, talking and writing essays side by side, always touching. Draco didn’t know if it was the bond helping things along or just a side effect of spending so much time in close proximity, but a week after Christmas, late at night after a lengthy discussion they had simply sat in comfortable silence. They had sat face to face, only their socked feet touching, when suddenly Harry had leaned over, eyes questioning, asking him if he could kiss him.
Once he heard the whistling of his kettle he went back and prepared his favourite black tea in one of his thermos’. He quickly changed into his white trousers and shirt and pulled a pair of black jeans and a grey button down out of his closet, carefully putting them into his backpack. He grabbed his tea and a coat and was on his way.
As though it had been an afterthought, it was arranged that those students who had signed up to stay in the castle during the Christmas break would be going on a “trip” to a muggle town up north.
Mr.Morris was as charming as ever, which is to say: not at all. Draco disliked the man with a passion and those feelings were most definitely reciprocated. The parole officer was a chubby little fellow, his light brown hair had begun to make way for grey ones and baldness. He was easily old enough to be Draco’s father.
Draco felt his chest tighten and warm and he cuddled closer to his lover.
“MALFOY?” louder this time, something shook Draco and it took him a moment to realise that Potter must have grabbed his shoulder. Slowly, far too slowly, Draco’s pain receded and he gained his consciousness back. He mumbled a response to Potters incessant shaking and immediately regretted it when Harry withdrew his hand. He wasn’t strong enough yet, he needed more contact.
Frustrated, Harry flipped Draco over onto the bed, pinning his hands above his head.  He kissed and bit his way down Draco’s chest and when he reached the top of his jeans, he paused his hands above the button and quirked an eyebrow at Draco who quickly nodded his head. He unfastened the button, pulled the zipper down and slid them down off his legs— together with the boxers — and tossed them behind him, off the bed.
So when Draco started feeling the pull again — earlier than anticipated— he grew anxious. It stayed unproblematic but very noticeable through the afternoon. However, just as he was reaching the 12 hour mark, he started feeling cold as ice — the former 24 hours effect of the bond.
“Internal bleeding”
Draco was about to counter that “it is in the book?!” before he remembered that their Potions textbook never actually explained it. The textbook they had been working with since first year was basically a collection of recipes and nothing more. And since Snape most definitely hadn’t explained it in class, he had to admit that Potter had a point. He could have read up on it in a different Potions book, but Draco doubted that Potter had cared about the distinction enough to go to that effort.
While Pansy had swiftly slipped away, Blaise proposed one of the favourite games of Slytherin house.
“I know it isn’t any of my business, and you can absolutely tell me to fuck off, but… I need to know.”
This chapters only contains mentions of past disordered eating and past abuse.
Draco barely managed to thank the professor before she left.
“Oh darling, I have eyes. Of course I knew. So that leaves the how and when. Both are rather simple. How: You’ve been spending a lot of time with him in those potion tutoring sessions. So you got close. When: It can’t have been before Christmas, he seemed too surprised at the drinking game. If I had to guess it was sometime in the last two weeks. You have been rather cozy at meal times with him since then.”
field of expertise, Draco gathered his confidence together and changed tactics. He pulled out an empty piece of parchment and began taking notes.
“A date or something.” Draco mocked.
For a few moments he considered just relishing in the warmth of the sleeping body in his arms and maybe drifting back to sleep until the situation set in. He was in the Room of Requirements, cuddling Harry Potter after having, for the lack of a better phrasing,
“Not only that, but you helped me. You saved my life and later you helped us fight in the battle. And don’t even pretend it wasn’t you who paid and organized all those private healers for Katie. She told me.” Potter said quite sternly. Silence stretched between them.
Wizarding world, rejoice! Against all indications of Harry Potter leaving the wizarding world in favour of a calm life in the Muggle world, he was just confirmed as one of two new Professors starting at Hogwarts in the upcoming school year. The other one being his ex-nemesis and now fiancé Draco Malfoy.
“But is it safe?”
Draco had only lasted 40 hours without Harry.
And that was all it took — an unspoken challenge, issued via eyebrow and Harry found himself saying, “Never have I ever made out with a guy” as if to prove something. Nevermind that not even Ron and Hermione knew that about him. He refilled his shot and drank, his eyes never leaving Draco’s face, closely watching the blond swallow more liquor.
“I want to get a tattoo.” he stated nonetheless.
Also I invent a lot of Potions knowledge in this and if I mention Draco reading a book, please feel free to imagine said book to be “The Giver” by Lois Lowry
The painting slid to the side so Draco could enter the common room, his hopes of getting to his room without meeting anyone were destroyed upon entry. In the far right corner sat Pansy, who was obviously waiting for him.
*****
It had been 10 days since he last saw Harry and his initial worry had changed into him often sporting a rather uncomfortable erection. “Damn you Potter” he grumbled continuing to wipe the counter with more force than was strictly necessary.
Putting on an innocent facade he asks, “Scratching?”
Finally Harry looked up. “That’s fair I guess.” He studied Draco’s face for a moment. “How did you know that you were gay?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco had thought falling had been exciting but now he was flying. Soaring freely through the air, the chains keeping him down had finally snapped and he was free. He didn’t understand.
Which is what he heard himself repeat yet again to a surprised Potter. Shortly before Draco could turn and continue on his way back to his dorm, he saw Potter's facial expression change. He looked almost sheepish and a little sad.
Seamus had smuggled in a few bottles of Firewhiskey and the rest of the Gryffindors provided the Butterbeers. Upon the mention of alcohol, Pansy and Blaise had shared a knowing look and Draco cursed himself for not running away right then and there.
That meant it was Harry’s turn and Draco could see him struggling to come up with anything to say. He leaned over and muttered a suggestion into his ear.
It was inexplicable to him, but he wanted to talk to McGonagall about it. He had never actually said what kept him from the Hall, having let Pansy think that it was because of the other students, which was only half true.
Lunch after all wasn’t an unpleasant affair. Potter was a surprisingly decent lunch companion, the conversation was easy and his manners weren’t revolting, and aside from Pansy and Hermione, no one looked at Draco twice.
Harry had to admit he was impressed. It made sense but he would have never been able to deduce that much from just a few palm indents. And Malfoy hadn’t even needed the book.
His thought process got interrupted by Weasley swatting Hermione’s arm and muttering “prude” before she spoke up and faced the circle. “Never have I ever masturbated to thoughts of someone in this room.”
“Hey, we don’t have to do this. Not now, not here.”
“Pleasure to meet you.” Draco said reflexively, bowing slightly during their handshake. At Professor McGonagall’s cue they settled into the small sitting area in front of the fireplace.
“I think it is important to integrate some of the concepts of structured education into the curriculum and have the students discover interdisciplinary connections due to joined lessons or overlapping curricula.” stated Mister Potter.
He knew that she worried, but he hadn’t really realised how bad his sleeping and eating, or lack thereof, had gotten. Suddenly, an idea crossed his mind and before he could really overthink it, he had gotten up and went into the common room.
“No, I don’t know what happened before that. But Hannah cried onto Nevilles shoulder afterwards so I have some ideas.” Ideas she apparently didn’t want to share. And the more Draco thought about it he realized she didn’t really gossip about any of the three as much as she used to. Apart from all three of them seeming fairly close at the study meetings, Draco didn’t really know much about what was going on between them.
Draco shrugged, he wasn’t too keen on that particular headline either. “I’m okay with keeping it secret for a while. I don’t necessarily want to go public either, although I do want to be able to tell my friends and my mother about it at some point.”
His thoughts were interrupted by Draco casting, “Expecto Patronum” with his eyes still closed. Silver mist poured from his wand, producing a solid shield between them and then fading away. Pearls of laughter pulled Harry out of his amazement and suddenly there were arms around him.
Harry looked elated, eyes bright and a relieved smile on his lips. “But,” Draco began, before he got immediately interrupted by the other man, “But?” his eyebrows drawn together.
Draco smiled at him encouragingly. “Congratulations on figuring it out, but that doesn’t mean you have to immediately come out, you know? Take it at your own pace.”
Alone.
silky hair, pulling them closer together. Draco shifted and the slight hint of friction led Harry to involuntarily buck his hips up against him. Chuckling, Draco pushed Harry back into the armchair, tutted and got up. He went back to the sofa, sat down and stretched his arms out over the backrest, raising an expectant eyebrow.
Both Potter and Hermione winced at the suggestion, darting glances to each other and Draco. It was Hermione who carefully said, “I don’t know if it still works or if it is still burning, but if it does still work it would be perfect. Then we just have to worry about getting everyone to the seventh floor.”
They disentangle themselves and face each other once more. Malfoy pushes the loose strands — more have escaped the braid during their fight — behind his ears.
Harry didn’t know what to say, but Malfoy kept shaking. After a few moments, he put his plate away and pulled his knees to his chest. A sob broke from him. Unsure of what to do Harry scrambled to his feet and after a moment's hesitation sat down next to Malfoy.
“The offer to help me with my Patronus? Wilkins said I needed to get at least some mist in order to pass.”
Despite it being a vacation, Harry got up early the next day. He ate his breakfast at the kitchen window with his winter boots on. Halfway into Harry’s second cup of tea, Malfoy appeared in between the trees — jacket-less yet again — walking the path that led past the cottage. Patiently, Harry waited for Malfoy to come into proximity, observing every move until then. The moment he was certain that Malfoy was within bounds, Harry threw up an anti-apparition jinx and stormed out of the house.
better.’  Harry blushed furiously at that thought. In attempt to hide his fluster he shot back, “Since you woke me up with your fucking moaning.”
Draco couldn’t explain why he was talking to McGonagall of all people about this,
They transferred from sitting to lying at some point during their conversation, because now Draco lay inches away from Harry, looking up into the night sky somehow visible on the ceiling. His eyes flittering to Harrys form next to him every few seconds. Their conversation had ebbed out and they were simply laying there.
Wide eyed he stared at his supposedly best friend, barely registering the chuckle from Blaise. Potter would never want him to explain anything to him. Especially not potions. The git probably thought Draco would secretly try to poison him.
Harry’s gasp was apparently all Draco needed, and instantly there were lips on his.
“Who said anything about being drunk?” retorted Harry as he put his wand back onto table, hoping that his smugness hid the underlying nervousness. Draco’s eyes skimmed across him, assessing him. A few moments later he got off the couch, slowly walking towards Harry, “Tell me then. How far have you gone Potter?” He came closer and his voice was sultry and low, smooth like velvet, “How much of your little fantasy is just that — a fantasy?” Another step closer. “Have you touched yourself to the idea of impaling yourself on my cock?” Closer. “Played with your hole, imagining it was me stretching you wide open?”
McGonagall didn’t look surprised in the slightest when Draco stayed behind after Transfiguration yet again. She simply motioned for him to follow her through to her office, and put the kettle on. Despite the odd familiarity of the situation, Draco didn’t sit. He lingered behind one of the armchairs facing the desk.
That was if it were cast correctly, but Potter was unaffected by the bond and didn't even know it existed, so Draco was left to struggle with the pull of an unfulfilled bond, alone. It had started off slow. At first, he had been able to go multiple days before he needed to touch Potter, but slowly the time between grew shorter and shorter.
To his surprise though, Potter didn’t comment on Draco’s presence and simply let himself fall into the couch next to Hermione.
(The editorial staff asks once again that the public be respectful of Mister Potter’s privacy, especially regarding his choice of partner.)
As the cottage filled with the scent of vanilla crescents, most of the other residents came shuffling into the kitchen one by one, at which point Harry decided to put on some hot cocoa while they waited for the crescents to cool. Standing in the kitchen with Dean, Hannah, Neville and Susan was surprisingly nice. There was powdered sugar everywhere, Neville had a cocoa mustache and with the laughter filling the room, it almost felt like they were just normal teenagers. Harry startled when he saw Malfoy rush past the kitchen and  drenched himself in his cocoa, the laughter only grew stronger. With a swirl of her wand, Hannah cleaned his clothes.
Draco woke late on Sunday with a panicked look on the clock. Potter had left him in front of his dorm close to midnight yesterday and it was already 11 again. Draco’s body had finally claimed the rest it dearly needed, which left him with only an hour to find and somehow touch Potter again. He was halfway out of his bed before Draco realised that he didn’t feel cold, the sense of longing was there but fairly faint, there was no need to rush.
Draco nodded and McGonagall scrutinized him for a moment.
“It’s a muggle town Harry,” came a gentle reminder from the bed. After a long pause, during which Harry just continued staring at Draco in question, Draco added, “I’m pants with muggles. Would you come with me?”
Professor Flitwick finally ended the lesson and Draco nearly missed it. He and Harry had decided to move their practical potions session forward a few hours so that they could finish before dinner. The implication that they could use the evening for some more quality time went unsaid by both.
They looked at each other for a few seconds before Potter turned to leave. Sensing his chance for the contact of the day, Draco quickly reached out and grabbed Harry by the hand. The skin contact sent tingles up his arm and the cold that had slowly crept up on Draco again, receded.
Suddenly self conscious, Draco tugged lightly at a few strands. “Minor breakdown.” he mumbled, clearly uncomfortable talking about it in greater detail just then. Luckily, Blaise snapped out of his stupor and picked up on it, as he instead chose to focus on Draco’s clothes.
Outside he threw a sticking jinx at Malfoy’s feet, effectively rooting the man in place.
Feeling resigned and slightly nervous, Harry got into bed inches from Malfoy, placing his wand under his pillow.
Draco could only stare at him in shock for a few moments, “Potter?” he spluttered, “Wha- Why-.. What?” Realising they were still holding hands, he tried to let go but Harry only held him tighter.
Harry nods his agreement until Draco orders, “Use your words Harry.” and he hastily agrees verbally too. The blond whispers, “How obedient, how precious.” and there’s a shiver running down Harry’s spine. Before he can relish in the feeling, Draco steps up and pulls him into a hungry kiss. With a barely suppressed moan Harry slips his hands into the soft waves framing the others face and kisses back. Their lips press against each other, tongues dancing with each other, exploring.
They passed stands full of sweets, mulled wine, hot mead and stands selling handcrafted items; pottery, candles, woodwork, lanterns… everything obviously made with love. Each stand Draco stood and admired the artworks, occasionally involving Harry to help him with the muggle money when he bought something.
. Harry goes to Chris sitting on the sidelines.
“shut it OFF!” came a sleepy grumbling from behind him.  When Harry rolled over to turn off his alarm, a hand fell from his hip.
“Can-... Can I kiss you?”
“What the fuck Pansy!” Draco exclaimed once the two were close.
Draco held a quick introduction —  “Harry, David; David, Harry” —  and sat down. He ordered himself a tea, some bread and scrambled eggs, Harry following suit but exchanging the tea for a pot of coffee.
There were less people present than he had expected. Hannah, Blaise and Neville sat on one of the couches, with Hermione and Pansy sitting opposite them, Susan Bones and Terry Boot in armchairs on either side.
A shiver ran down Draco’s spine and he felt cold.
“Right, because you would have been so welcoming about me talking to you on the train, no preconceived notion, no nothing. Let’s just pretend we weren’t on opposite sides of a freaking war just weeks prior. Even if you did help me, someone would have accused me of controlling you and they would have thrown me into Azkaban!”
“Pans. It was pointless the last time too and you still tried. And back then I couldn’t even manage to walk an empty hallway at a normal pace. What is it really?” He nudged her knee with his own, and settled back against his headboard.
“In that case not being set on the idea might actually help you.” Leah laughed. “I would recommend you talk to Toby, he is our cover-up specialist. He should be here in about 15 minutes. Do you want to wait for him or do you want to schedule an appointment?”
Without much fuss Pansy followed after him.
Tears slipped from his eyes.
7 years. Draco had spent 7 glorious years without real contact with the wizarding world. Only the rare letter here and there when the ministry had sent him his wand back, when he ordered the piping bags and some letters to his mother. Why did Potter have to turn up here and ruin it for him?
He could blame it on the wet mattress for the first night, surely cuddling up to anyone was preferable to sleeping on that, even if it was Malfoy. Or so Harry argued, conveniently forgetting that he knew multiple charms to dry the mattress. It still boggled him how and why he had been on Malfoy’s side this morning AGAIN. There was just no reason for it.
A soft smile graced the witches face and for a moment she reminded Draco of Pansy. Fierce, loyal, smart.
“Besides,” Potter started hesitantly, “even if you owed me for that, we would be even.”
Harry looks wide eyed into the mirror, following the trail of love bites along his neck and chest before turning his gaze back to Draco, who is lying on his stomach next to him. “I… kinda like it.” he admits and only then does he register the angry red marks covering Draco’s back.
“Honestly Draco, why do you think I kept coming back or asked you out?”
Potter had forgiven him. Potter believed him. Potter thought that Draco deserved to not suffer anymore.
“Shut up Malfoy. As long as we can’t stay in the castle, this is my room too.” Harry replied,  too tired to argue. The day had been draining enough and he simply wanted to go to sleep, even if that meant sharing a bed with Malfoy; at least the bed was big enough for two.
“So Neville and Hannah were sitting next to each other opposite him and none of them spoke to each other. Honestly you could have cut their silence with a knife. And then all of a sudden Blaise grabs his bag and tries to leave the table, Hannah reaches out and actually stops him from leaving. Blaise growls at her, Neville jumps in, probably defending her, and next thing I know Blaise yells at him to ‘go fuck himself’ rips his arm away and storms off. McG barely managed to refrain herself from docking points from Slytherin out of reflex.”
He only needed to last 9 months now and it would be all over. Taking a few deep breaths he forced himself to concentrate on his book.
“This is Draco, he’s a friend of mine and has agreed to help with today’s lesson. He is just as qualified to help you as I am, and will help me to keep an eye on all of you today, as we will start with choke holds.”
“Sure.”
Harry’s cock was as beautiful and well proportioned as the rest of him, larger than most cocks Draco had seen, albeit no monster by any means, and Draoc’s mouth watered at the sight.
Granger was another problem. Draco had written letters to everyone while on house arrest and his letter to Granger had taken a toll on him. He knew he had treated her worse than most, bullying her because of his distorted racism as well for personal reasons. He had since grown as a person and realized how wrong his views had been, how he had been jealous about this supposedly “inferior”
“Potter, you have to grab his collar but you don’t use it for the actual choke. All contact you have with his neck is via your thumb tendon and your wrist,” he corrects and turns to Chris with a questioning look, “May I?”
Pansy’s voice interrupted his thoughts, “Darling, nobody here is really innocent. They all have their demons to fight, and they all had to go through this war. You are not responsible for everything that happened, you aren’t even responsible for half the things you blame on yourself. Please, let me help you Draco.”
"Scum"
Potter scanned his face for a moment but didn’t seem to trust what he saw. “Do you promise to not rip your hair out if I do?”
The stag erupted from the tip of his wand, lighting the room with its bright silver light, cantering across the tables around them. It came to a gentle halt next to Harry, its light dimmed as not to blind them. With his front legs next to Harry’s shoulder it gently nudged Malfoy’s shoulder with its snout. The blond hesitantly reached up to place his hand on the Patronus and after a moment the light dimmed further and the stag slowly vanished.
Ancient Runes with Hermione was rather fun and before they knew it, they had their whole text translated and simply settled into an easy chatter.
“I want you to at least try to go down with us on Saturday, yeah? I won't force you to actually eat with us, but I want you to try. I could ask Blaise to join us if you want?” To his surprise Draco found the idea of Blaise joining them calming. Force in numbers or something. Besides, Blaise was still one of his best friends even if they weren’t as close as they used to be.
“Minerva tells me you’re looking for a mind healer. Do you have any previous experience with mind healing or therapy?” Gemma asked in a friendly tone. Her expression didn’t change one bit when Draco shook his head.
“Watch it,” Draco snarled anyway, albeit a bit half-heartedly and pushed past Harry Potter and into the great hall. Only once Draco sat and had secured himself some porridge did he take a deep breath; with his daily run-in with Potter already out of the way he could spend the day actually paying attention in class.
When Pansy noticed the shocked and concerned look, she turned, and within seconds she was out of her seat and pulled Draco into his dorm.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What do you regret most?”
Barely keeping it together Draco shook his head and quickly headed towards his room. He couldn't deal with this right now, couldn’t break down here in the common room when dinner was almost over. The tears he’d held back for quite some time now, were threatening to fall.
“You feeling better?” Harry asked conversationally.
Draco took this as the dismissal it was, leapt towards the desk to grab his wand and then waited a moment to make sure Morris had actually left. He made his way towards the visitors floos as fast as he could while still nursing his throbbing stomach.
“I, on the other hand, still need to do that. Apologize I mean. I- I am deeply sorry for my role in the war. For what I did to you specifically. I know it’s not really worth anything but I never wanted you dead… I… just didn’t know how to get out.”
And lastly 6. If you drink alone you have to spill. Meaning: If you are the only one to drink at a statement and someone asks for details? You have to tell. All within reason of course. Questions?”
‘Some couples reported the bond to be almost sentient. In the case of Willibald Wodlington and his wife Emmaline there are multiple documented instances of the bond flaring up despite the continuous contact between the two. The pair discovered that the bond does differentiate between the forms of contact and their inherent intimacy.
Suddenly Draco felt self-conscious about his appearance. While the previous nervosity had stemmed from the unease of having everyone stare at him, he now needed the reassurance that Harry liked his transformation. That Harry thought he looked good.
I just came back from a rather exhausting day outside (minor sunburn included) and now I'm completely knackered, but I still wanted to update. Hope you like this chapter.
“You said that you didn’t have a choice but to join and I know you didn’t, but even if you had had one it wouldn’t mean you should have to suffer for the rest of your life. You apologized, you changed, that is all that counts. At least for me.” The gentleness was back in Potter’s voice. When he had finished speaking he squeezed Draco’s elbow once more before dropping his hand and turning back to his work.
Draco thanked her and focussed on Luna. He had already had this talk with her, although via owl. Luna had been one of the few who had actually responded to his owl and they had spent a few weeks clearing the air.
By the time he came, memory Blaise had shifted into someone else. Someone with a slight stubble, long dark curls and bright green eyes.
Draco calmed. This wouldn’t be another Morris, McGonagall had made sure that it couldn’t be. And if Draco had to trust someone, it was her.
When he left for lunch almost an hour later, he was in high spirits. The conversation with Gemma had been great and he had his first real therapy session scheduled for the following week. Talking to her had been easy enough, even when she asked emotionally charged questions. Within the short time of meeting her, Draco had managed to find enough trust to remove his hand from his wand and to come out to her. She in turn had opened up about the seven cats she was raising together with her girlfriend and had told him about her reasons for starting mind healing.
“Huh? Do I mean what?” came the confused reply. Draco was still in his pajamas as well, looking slightly rumpled.
“Me too,” admitted Draco, before leaning back. He turned in his seat again, his back once again resting against the armrest of the couch, with his knees pulled to his chest, his legs the only thing separating him from Harry. “We should probably talk about this,” he said.
“Look at me,” Draco said gently, carefully placing a finger under Harry’s chin to lift it, “I’m not mad at you. We were at war and I tried to cast an unforgivable at you, so you reacted in the way you were trained to. I don’t hold it against you and neither should you.”
The interior was kept in shades of dark blue and black with occasional details in cream white. The absolute best part was the ceiling though, thousand little stars glittered and made it seem as if they were underneath a clear night sky. Draco even recognized some constellations.
“Be glad you missed dinner. Blaise made a right arse of himself.” She started her daily update of all the rumours she heard. Draco raised an eyebrow, too busy chewing his dinner.
“Father would never approve.” Draco whispered, anxiously playing with the ring in his left earlobe, before forcing his hand back down. Those were already problematic enough.
Morris had the audacity to write Draco up as being late to the meeting, as if Draco hadn’t arrived five minutes before the set time, and as if he hadn’t made Draco wait outside his office for another ten minutes. With forced calmness, Draco didn’t comment on the obvious malice and instead opted to sit on the uncomfortable looking wooden chair.
Malfoy stays rigid for the whole demonstration, only moving occasionally to tap twice on Malcolm’s arm — the signal to stop and loosen the hold. Malcolm had taught it to them when they had started to learn lever holds.
Even though the bond hadn’t really bothered Draco in the past six months, Harry still worried. “Yeah I’m fine. Can’t I just miss my boyfriend?” he answered lightly and propped himself up to reach Harry’s face.
The train ride had been surprisingly peaceful. Draco had simply sat and chatted with Hermione, Pansy, and Harry. As suspected, Harry didn’t seem to remember the kiss at all. At least he never brought it up or acted differently around Draco, who felt his lips tingle whenever he thought about it.
“I asked whether choking turns you on. You never answered in the dojo.” Malfoy repeats himself, steadily looking Harry in the eyes.
At the study group meeting Draco found himself at a separate table with Harry again. As Harry had apparently spent enough time during the winter holidays reading potions books, they could now fill an entire afternoon going over the little curriculum Draco had set to check off topics he deemed Harry proficient enough in. They had just covered the syllabus from fifth year when Harry interrupted Draco’s note taking.
Oh did he try kink. Harry’s cock throbs with interest at the question and Harry smirks. “Yes”  The answer earns him raised eyebrows and a head tilt, obviously asking him to elaborate. Smugly, Harry stays silent.
With the sudden realisation of their position came the awareness that he was hard. It took all his willpower to break the kiss, unwilling to rush into what must be Harry’s first exploration with gay sex. Panting slightly, Draco warned, “If you… don’t want this to… escalate I’d… suggest we stop.”
“I’m so sorry for not coming in earlier, I had planned to, honestly but Andromeda fell sick and between work and taking care of Teddy, I just didn’t have a moment of time,” the darker man's breathing began to become normal again. “I would have called but I don’t have your number.”
By the end of the lesson almost everyone had been able to produce some form of silver mist, except for Malfoy, and Harry had noticed. And as Malfoy passed him on his way out, Harry unthinkingly grabbed his wrist and said, “I can help you.”
Ginny Weasley pulled a face but nodded, “I read your letter. I talked to these two. And.. I guess I accept your apology.”
If Draco was honest, he had blamed Potter for Vince’s death for a while or at least had wished for Potter to have taken Vince instead of him. But he could see the logic in his statement, at least partly.
When Harry left on the day before Christmas eve, Draco hugged him goodbye, hoping that it would be enough to keep him going, knowing that it wasn’t.
A surprising lack of noise confronted Draco when he opened the door to the Room of Requirement that evening. It wasn’t completely silent but on his way up the stairs he had imagined loud music and people screaming at each other just to be heard. Instead there was the normal noise of people chatting with each other like they did in the common rooms.
The confusion only multiplied itself and Draco couldn’t stop himself from asking, “Show them to me?”
“She was happy I had finally figured it out. I think she suspected it all along.” There was another pause just as Draco finished the last of the labels. Finally, he stood up to face Harry. Uncertain of what to do now, Draco watched Harry, who was nervously gnawing on his lower lip. The small part of his brain that had been replaying their kiss over and over again was rearing up again, supplying Draco with mental images of gently pulling the battered flesh away from the teeth with his own lips.
Harry retreated back to Ron and Hermione but kept his eyes trained on Malfoy anyway. By the end of the lesson Malfoy had, once again, not produced the slightest of silver mist. Harry watched him trudging out of the classroom with his head bowed.
Naturally, not thinking of Malfoy had worked for about 5 seconds before Harry became rapidly obsessed with him again. He watched Malfoy constantly - at meals, in class, on the map - thinking about the way he had held his wrist and read his palm. Harry couldn’t figure out if Malfoy was up to something or if he had actually changed into a tolerable person.
“It was my fault he was there.”
*~~~*
“His previous experiences teaching the subject as well as his general knowledge in the field are valuable references and I have complete faith that he will excel in his new position.” stated Headmistress McGonagall upon appointing the new professors.
They all knew Draco would talk to them once he was ready and that he just wanted to be held until then. So they held him and waited.
Malcolm asks Malfoy to kneel in front of him and demonstrates how to get into their first real hold; snaking his arms around the neck and pulling Malfoy back on top of him. He shows it multiple times, starting slow and working his way up to fighting speed before he asks them to pair up and try it for themselves.
“Malfoy”
“Okay then, have a lovely day. Draco, Harry” and David was gone again. They got up and left the café.
Nearly everyone drank to that except surprisingly Seamus Finnegan , who Draco had always pinned as a very sexually driven being. When Hermione noticed Draco wrinkling an eyebrow at the fact, she leaned over Pansy to whisper into his ear, “He and Dean have been together since third year. I don’t think he ever really noticed anyone but him.”
Draco had a few hours before he had to head to Astronomy and he still needed to finish his essay; he had put off writing it for the sole reason of needing a book from the library and never finding the energy to actually go. So of course he was stuck with going now, when loads of other students were sure to be there too.
Fun little fact for you though: in all of my stories so far I included "running fingers through another persons hair" as a way to show intimacy, trust, comfort and as a way to calm someone down. Guess what I love my s/o doing to me?
Of course Morris had noticed the way Draco had clung to his wand in their first meeting, Potter having returned it to him after the trial, and had latched onto that fact like a vulture. After the weeks spent in Malfoy Manor without a wand of his own and with many unwanted houseguests, Draco felt panic whenever he couldn’t pull his wand immediately. He even took the wand with him when he showered, laying it carefully next to his hair potions.
“Is that my old jumper?” he asked, incredulous.
A hush spreads through the trainees and all of them look excited. The excitement falls instantly when the words “warm-up” fall from Malcolms lips. 20 minutes later they kneel on the side again, this time panting for air, sweating in their thick
It's happening !! IT'S FINALLY HAPPENING! It only took 42k words to get here, but we ARRIVED! Please tell me you are as excited as I am.
“Huh?” came the bleary answer, and Draco hadn’t been prepared just how
“Harry, look at me.” he orders and Harry does. He looks into the grey eyes, almost black with lust, and sees the urgency, the pleading. “We need to talk about this. I won’t choke you - won’t touch you - if I don’t know for sure that you want this.”
So Potter had seen what happened. Parts of it. Which parts? Draco felt his heart racing and his breathing speed up. What had he seen? What did he know?
Brushing his hands down his jumper to stop them from shaking, Draco accepted his doom and walked with Pansy towards the common room. As promised, Hermione stood there, hair more of a mess than usual, stifling a yawn. Nonetheless, she greeted him with a “Good Morning” and a smile.
The sheets were still tangled from their cuddling the night before, but he didn’t care about that. Once in the room Draco clutched at the hem of Harry’s shirt and pulled it up, as Harry raised his arms over his head.
The wooden table in the corner of their common room was still empty when Draco sat down and spread out his books. A tempus told him that he was a good 5 minutes early, so he didn’t think much of it. Simply opening his book, Draco tackled his runes translation again, immersing himself into the text.  He looked up, when the stool next to him scraped against the floor and sure enough, Hermione sat down next to him. Her brown eyes sparkled with excitement when she proclaimed, “I was hoping you were still working on it too, I’m lost after the second sentence. Do you want to work on it together?”
“Bad breakup?” There is a twinkling in Chris’ eyes.
It felt oddly reassuring that Potter didn’t really acknowledge his minor breakdown. Remembering they were in the common room, his eyes darted around wildly, and saw that nobody was paying attention to them.
“But,” Draco said again, “If we’re going to do this, I think it’s time we talk about some things; unpleasant things”
Pansy cast a tempus and shrugged, “Oh in about 10 minutes?” she said innocently while fluttering her lashes. She got up and turned to leave his dorm. Draco, who had just taken another bite, promptly coughed. When he recovered, Pansy was already gone.
The constant beat of his own heart in his ears didn’t dull the whole way to the Hall, and when Draco reached the heavy wooden doors it was still beating at a steady, albeit fast pace. With a last fortifying breath Draco accepted his doom and pushed the doors open.
Professor McGonagall had written to him that she had scheduled a meeting with his potential future mind healer during lunch. The initial meeting served to ensure compatibility and to clear any questions Draco still had regarding the whole process. It was both to ease Draco’s nerves and to ensure that something like the whole debacle with Morris wouldn’t happen again.
“Thank you.” he said, before forcing his mind back to the topic at hand. “So... sixth year. Poisons and antidotes.”
Draco’s hands were shaking, his eyes still decidedly fixated onto his feet and the small space in front of them. With his heart racing and his lip bitten raw, he stepped onto the train and immediately began looking for one of his friends. In the end he found most of them in the same compartment in the back.
Linking his fingers with Harry’s, he turned his gaze away from the receding castle. Instead he laid his head on Harry’s shoulder and closed his eyes, for the first time in a long time actually excited for what the future may bring.
“Wouldn’t know.” Draco shrugged. “I never really planned any of my coming-outs so I never was that nervous beforehand. I guess though, it always felt emotional and somewhat freeing.”
“Have you ever cheated on a test?” he asked although he knew the answer.
“I blacked out. I couldn’t get to him in time.” He admitted in a low voice, there was no point in keeping secrets from her. Draco could practically see the moment Pansy’s anger melted away only to be replaced with worry.
“Apologies, if I caused any trouble with your partners, really.” Draco mumbled,  subtly gesturing towards the red marks. To his surprise, Blaise smirked.
, but at least he didn’t have to get up at the crack of dawn to get food, which is what he reminded himself of when the dreaded study meeting crept closer. He didn’t even need the study meeting. He had finished all of the assignments already, not being distracted by mundane things as meals or people tended to make for a lot of extra time, and therefore he would only sit there and watch other people study.
*uploads chapter and hides*
“Why did they even let him back?”
Laughing softly at the name, Harry gave him a peck and whispered back, “The wedding isn’t until next year you git.” Even the former insult sounded like a declaration of love from his lips.
A party is planned, tears are shed and some emotional talks are had.
No, he could do this. Pansy had said that the other 8th years weren’t so bad. He could do this.
Suddenly there was a hand on top of his own and only then did Draco notice that he had balled it into a fist. “Yes we are together.” Harry sighed in resignation.
“We could meet after dinner if you’d like?” he offered instead, thinking about Harry saying that they could ‘lead to something’ and desperately wanting to see where it would lead them.
His shaking fingers reached for the wand and he spun. It landed on Pansy. Eager to change the mood, he asked, “Truth or Dare?” even though he knew that she would pick dare. He was right.
The somber story dampened the mood a bit until Luna decided to skip Weasley’s turn. “Never have I ever used a strap-on with a partner.” she said and Draco heard multiple people gasp at the unusually crass words out of her mouth. Even more gasped when she lifted both her and Weasley’s glass from the floor. Pansy and Hermione were also drinking.
“Thank you.” Blaise said, sounding slightly relieved.
gifted me a hand-bound book of this fic?! I am still super shocked about it. Go check out the
Definitely no spoiled celebrity.
But with the morning sun also came the problems. While Draco’s head was still buzzing with excitement, he was also doubting himself severely, mulling every little action over in his head. Had he been too forceful? Had he maybe coerced Harry into kissing him?
“I don’t really know what to say.  I did nothing to deserve your kindness, but I am nonetheless grateful for it. I’ll consider coming to the party. Thank you Granger.”
It was apparently Potter’s turn to be at a loss for words as he opened his mouth and immediately closed it again. After a few tries he gave up and just nodded.
They had reached the Great Hall and McGonagall simply walked by, towards the nearest flight of stairs, leading to the ground floor.
“I-.... Thank you Pansy.” he said, still staring at the food presented to him.
Harry deflated, Mafloy thought Harry would blackmail him.
Completing Hogwarts? This could give him the small chance for a future he had stopped imagining a long time ago. A chance to one day maybe find work, enroll in a magical university or start an apprenticeship. The odds were still against him but most of that was due to prejudice rather than factual disadvantages.
has gone on an editing spree (she literally did the rough check on 6 chapters and the final edit on 4 more in the last 2 days) so I'm SUPER happy to upload another chapter!
Draco had only stared at him before finally gathering his wits. “Sure. Although if you want to be able to do it yourself you need a better understanding of the basics and the ingredients. I could tutor you if you want? Consider it payment for helping me the other day.”
being smarter,
“Do the thing you mentioned wanting to do on Thursday,” he challenged, confusing most of the others. To Pansy’s credit, she didn’t even reach for her shot glass. Instead, she turned to Hermione, sitting next to her on the couch.
The moment Harry feels Chris grabbing his collar for the choke, he knows he is screwed. Harry has always been sensitive on his neck and apparently that isn’t just limited to kisses and soft touches. Chris pulls his collar tight and Harry feels himself getting aroused. He wills his cock down with some concentration and the mental image of Dudley eating.
Draco sat in his room, willing his hands to stop shaking and his heart to stop racing. The others were still downstairs at the feast, and the dreaded party wasn’t planned to start for at least another hour; Draco was still under no obligation to go, but nonetheless his hands were jittery and clammy. He had tried to read for a while but had given up after having read the same paragraph five times without actually retaining any of its content. So he sat and waited.
A moan escaped Harry’s lips and he was acutely aware of his throbbing cock when he nodded ever so slightly in answer to Draco’s question. Even if he had wanted to answer verbally, he lost the ability when Draco straddled him. Soft hair tickled his collarbone when Draco leaned down to murmur into his ear, “Maybe even charmed a dildo to fuck into you?”
This chapter contains: anxiety attacks, mentions of disordered eating an negative thoughts.
Noticing Draco’s eyes on him, Potter tentatively asked, “Crabbe?”
Realizing the extent at which his touch affected Draco, Harry nudged his shoulder again and said, “Okay budge over, the more contact you get the faster you heal. Plus I’d like to sleep for a few more hours and this chair just isn’t it.”
Hermione shook her head. “And get caught by Filch while drunk? No thanks.”
After barely two years of studying under the renown Potions Master Twining, Draco Malfoy has managed to attain his own Potions Mastery at the tender age of 21. He was awarded the title for his work on the wolfsbane potion, making the potion both more effective as well as cheaper to brew, improving the availability of the potion for people afflicted by lycanthropy.
His heart still pounding loudly in his chest, Harry let out his own breath and carefully asked, “What about memories from before the war? Your childhood always seemed so perfect.” Harry innerly winced at the obvious envy his voice conveyed. Two parents doting on him, loving him, spoiling him. A manor, magic, friends and playmates; to Harry it had been the dream.
Draco was close to tears. He
‘Why the hell am I here’ Harry thinks while seriously considering chugging his whisky and leaving, when Malfoy clears his throat.
Granger and Pansy stepped out of the classroom, and it had been Granger who had called his name. Pansy muttered a quick goodbye to head off to Divination.
“Are you going to the kitchens or do you want to join me in the Great Hall?” he asked, clearly aiming for nonchalance and failing, the apprehensive look in his eyes giving him away. Draco decided to try for the Great Hall in favour of being able to continue talking to Harry. While the inheritance issue had set their conversation back a bit, he wasn’t ready to part ways with him just yet. He wanted to see Harry’s face light up at least one more time that night.
Within moments he felt hands on his sides, roaming his torso and pulling him closer. Draco forgot the audience and when he felt the hands wander to grab at his hips, he relented control and lost himself in the kiss, the taste of Firewhiskey on both their lips.
Instead Harry pulled away gently and it took all he had for Draco not to chase after him. And then it hit him that he didn’t have to refrain from it and he surged forward.
“Sure, give me a moment. I am nearly finished with the sentence before that anyway.” There was no sign of anger or resentment in her voice and Draco let out a breath he hadn’t even realized he had been holding.
“BULLSHIT!” Morris exploded. And Draco did flinch at that. “I know you have one. There is no way in hell you don’t. So where is it?” At the last question, Morris moved from behind his desk towards Draco.
“No need to get ahead of yourself. We might be done with discussing the limits, but you had some liquor tonight and playing under the influence isn’t safe. Especially choking.” Even though Draco’s tone starts off playful, it turns stern halfway through. He slips off of Harry’s lap, pulling the other man up with him, and leads them away from the sofa.
Time melted away as he kneaded and mixed and baked. When the dough for the buns was set aside to rise it was time for his favourite part of the day: The cookies. He turned the radio up and reached for his cutters, all of them handcrafted by his design and one of the biggest selling points for his little shop. He had a common welsh green, a peruvian vipertooth, a wyvern and many more breeds of dragons; it only seemed fitting given his and the shop’s name.
Draco was almost certain that he was stuck with a botched Magnis Nexum bond. He had found the spell (or as he considered it: curse)  in one of the darker books in the Malfoy library and, from what he gathered, it was supposed to ensure the success of arranged marriages. If cast correctly, it created a desire for physical contact in both bond-mates and the touch of the bonded would even give each person a sense of peace, connection and belonging.
Draco spotted Blaise sitting opposite Neville and Hannah a few seats down, while he was reaching for the bacon. “I gather Blaise has stopped being an arse then?” he asked Pansy.
“It is a matter of trust and personal chemistry,” Gemma added, “Which is why Minerva will be leaving us in a few minutes.”
To his surprise Harry woke to his wand ringing on his side of the bed. Alone. Or well, as alone as one gets when sharing a bed with someone. At least they weren’t touching. So he got up, grabbed his clothes for the day and went into the bathroom.
A giggle went across the group and Draco smirked, Pansy had always liked her drinking games dirty. Looking around the circle, he noticed a few of them drinking and blushing.
Headmistress,
There were also a few instances of her just commenting "GAAAAAAAY".
When Harry woke next, it was to warmth encasing him and the blaring sound of his alarm.
He runs his hand through his still damp hair and strides over to the fireplace, kneeling in front of it and calls out,
“The usual. Food was great, people were loud, some fourth year students were staring.” Harry shrugged it off and joined Draco at one of the work stations, slightly nudging him with his shoulder. “It’s not the same without your snarky comments.”
“In general?? Uhm. Nothing?” Potter admitted cautiously. He released a breath when Draco didn’t comment on it and simply went onto the next question.
“I-…. Thank you, Harry. This was - is - a wonderful date.” he couldn´t supress the sigh escaping his lips.
Draco stumbled into the Room of Requirement almost twenty minutes late. He had agreed to meet Harry there directly after dinner but he had lost track of time. His first official therapy session had taken place just before dinner and he had needed some time afterwards to collect his thoughts. When Draco had realised the time, dinner was over, but he still needed to eat. Opting to talk to Harry before going to the kitchen (so as not to keep him waiting), Draco had headed for the Room of Requirement.
He didn’t go back to their room that night.
There was a scowl on the other's face, matching his venomous tone, “Well then you can be glad I only added it on paper. Or sad that I didn’t blow myself up or whatever.”
“I.. kinda meant it when I said ‘everything’ you know?”
“Could you maybe help me up please?” he asked reluctantly and through gritted teeth, the effect being ruined by his unsteady voice and the shaking of his extended hand.
The both of them had convinced him over the course of multiple meals and a free Saturday morning to tell McGonagall about Morris, and had offered him their support, which he had gladly accepted.
“It— It’s okay. Sorry for.. crying all over you,” sniffled Malfoy in response. He pulled his sleeves over his hands and dabbed away the last traces of tears on his face. Harry waved it off and got up; he was nearly at the door when Malfoy spoke up again.
Not giving any indication he would stop his musings any time soon, Draco interrupted, “Your godfather left you a house?”
Feeling his chest untighten, Draco realised he must have missed the latest statement but since he didn’t feel compelled to drink, he didn’t bother asking Pansy what it had been. Instead he focused back on the game, it was one of the younger Ravenclaw’s turn.
They stepped into the halls. The little speech had lasted long enough that most students were in their afternoon classes or had retreated someplace else. Draco was thankful that McGonagall didn’t comment on the tears still falling from his eyes but instead walked in silence with him.
“WHAT?”
“He did what?” Draco asked incredulously, shocked to no end by the revelation.
Blaise laughed. “Relax. I know it’s not what it looks like.” He walked up to his still hugging friends and pulled both of them in his arms, gently steering them to Draco’s bed. Before the three of them could fall onto the mattress though, Hermione seemed to have reached her limit of awkwardness.
No matter the exact proceedings of their engagement, the Prophet wishes both a long and loving life together.
Chris gives him the go ahead and Harry does his best to focus on what Malfoy is showing him this time. When Harry tries it again, Chris taps out after mere seconds and Malfoy smiles at him before continuing to the next trainee pair.
“Really?”
Just after the last imprint had vanished and Pansy had pulled Draco into a tight hug, the door to his dorm opened and Blaise rushed in.
Topics covered: References to past abuse (during parole meetings), mentions of needles, McG being a BAMF.
Nodding, Draco thought about the advice. “I catch myself still thinking like them sometimes.” The admission burned his throat, but McGonagall didn’t interrupt him. “I know my father isn’t a good person. I think I knew that for quite some time. But… He is still my father.”
‘Euphemia and Fleamont Potter with James. Founders gala 1968’
When they had rounded the third corner, the tears had finally stopped falling. After the fifth corner Draco found it in himself to speak up.
A few minutes later, Draco speeds his thrusts up again and not after long, he slams into Harry hard and fast. Harry’s hands are back at grabbing Draco’s back, clutching to his shoulders, anchoring his fingernails into him.
“Draco. What questions do I need to ask that I can’t answer myself? It’s clear why, you’ve been crushing on him for years and-”
After the lesson, when all of them were on the way out, Harry had held Draco back to the blond’s surprise.
Granger interrupted him, “It makes no sense! Ashwinder eggs are highly reactive when added to a potion below a roaring simmer, yet it specifically says to add the eggs before the potion can reach room temperature!”
Understanding the meaning behind the words, Harry takes a step back. “You own the cottage? But…” He let his objection fade out, trying to sort his head.
“I don’t know,” came Harry’s reply, also muttered. “But I like it.”
“Ah yes. It’s not really explained in our book but I looked it up in
“Malfoy?” Potter asked when the study meeting dispersed half an hour later. Draco had finally regained the ability to move his body and was on his way to his dorm, but stopped when Potter called.
the people around you? The Headmistress should be checked for an Imperius and while they’re at it they should check Potter too. No way our saviour would willingly testify for scum…”
“I’m sorry.” said Draco in lieu of a greeting, causing Harry to look up.
When he adds a second finger, Draco breaks the kiss again, “Do you want me to choke you now or when I am inside of you?” he asks and Harry can barely answer as Draco presses his fingers deep into him, brushing his prostate.
“The muggles I lived with treated me like shit. I hated being there, and hated that I always had to go back. They hated me and they hated magic. I didn’t have any friends until Hogwarts and I most definitely wasn’t the spoiled celebrity you or Snape made me out to be.” He didn’t look Draco in the eyes the entire time, but his voice was strong and certain.
Harry rushed to explain, that neither of them had done it consciously and that he hadn’t said anything because he never knew how to broach the subject. “I mean it’s not that bad anyway, I… kinda like it,” he admitted and thinking back to the day before added, “Which is why I was so quiet yesterday. I … kind of woke up to it and just decided to continue sleeping because it felt… well nice. I’m super sorry about that by the way.”
he reminded himself, and stepped fully into the room, heading towards the small group surrounding Pansy and Hermione. The proud look on both their faces easing his nerves and making his attendance worth it. Even though he didn’t know how long he would be able to stay, he didn’t regret coming.
“Malfoy!” came a call when Draco was about to exit the Charms classroom. “Do you have a moment?” Potter hurried to catch up with him, joining Draco on his way to the kitchen. “I have a free period after lunch and wanted to get started on the potions essay, but to be honest I only understood two thirds of what Armado was talking about.”
“Good,” Draco growls and uses his grip on Harry’s hair to pull him into a searing kiss, attacking his lips with ferocity. Harry kisses back with eagerness and excitement and finally allows his hands to wander across the lean body above him, letting them stroke over the slim waist and down to the firm ass.
Draco picked his book back up but couldn’t concentrate. Truth was, there was no counter. The bond would dissolve itself after roughly a year and that would be it. The whole reason it existed was to help people who either didn’t know or didn’t like each other to learn to get along, so of course there was no easy way out.
Harry rubs his neck nervously, where the stiff jacket of his
“I love you too.”
It was indeed morning according to the Tempus Draco cast, and breakfast would start in a few minutes . Pansy and Hermione would probably be waiting for him and after the rather sparse dinner due to nerves the night before, he actually felt hungry.
Shaking hands lay the brush back onto the dresser. Another quick check in the mirror and Draco felt as ready as he was going to get. Pansy walked towards him when he stepped outside his dorm, clearly on her way to fetch him.
Slinging an arm around his best friend, Draco gave her an affectionate squeeze and leaned his head on her shoulder, “I know. I am trying, I promise.” The implied apology rang in each of his words.
When no explanation of what the other needed to know followed, Draco cocked his head. “Then ask.” he said softly.
Harry groaned and prepared for another round of Potions review.
Seeing the blond strands littered across the floor and sink, he could finally breathe again.
If his calculations were right, he would only have to endure 15 more meetings before he was allowed to live his life in peace. 15 more meetings and maybe, just maybe he could start healing.
Wait. Sleeping... in his arms? His eyes shot open only to see Harry Potter in his arms.
And just like that there were butterflies in Draco’s stomach. No longer surprised by their general existence, he revelled in the tingling sensation, letting his mind do a little happy dance at the compliment.
“Oh good you’re finally awake. Cut the bloody screaming and thrashing around. People are trying to sleep here.” And the blond git had the audacity to shove Harry back onto his pillow before lying back down himself.
“Granger, could you tell me when you’ve reached sentence 3 of paragraph 4? I’d like your opinion on it.” he said cautiously, his heart beating violently in his chest.
Taking the offered comfort, Draco hugged him back and answered honestly, “Exhausting, but I guess I can see where it is going. Apologies for only showing up now. I lost track of time.” He glanced at the room over Harry’s shoulder. “What’s all this?”
and he had apologized to most of the students. He sent dozens of letters while he was wasting the days in the manor away. He was
Draco continues healing and knows about Potions. McGonagall continues to be an amazing person
“Where did you pull the soulmate from? Does everyone have one?” The whole topic was new to Harry. He was intrigued enough to forget that he was supposed to be hating the man in front of him.
“And with whom do I have the honour then?” he asked the boy kindly.
Half an hour later Harry was positively drained and Draco had happily reduced the topics he still needed to cover with Harry down to one page, most of which being practical. He informed Harry that they would start the actual brewing as soon as he found a place to do so.
“You’re so good Harry. You are perfect. Merlin the sounds you make…” Draco praises and a few moments later Harry realises that his hands had flown up to Draco’s shoulder blades and were currently digging into him tightly. He sheepishly tries to loosen his grip but Draco only shakes his head, “Leave them” he orders.
,” She said instinctively only then really taking Draco in. “Uhm. Can I… help you?” she asked, clearly weary of Draco. Not that Draco could blame her, he knew he looked mental with his hair still all over the place, even with the beanie he had on, in an effort to hide some of it.
The way from his dorm to the common room was too short to come up with any answers. With his thoughts still racing and his heart beating too fast he reached the study table. Pansy was already sitting there with Granger on her left, leaving the other side of the table to him. Draco gently put his books down and let his bag slide from his shoulder.
“I’m gay.”
“Why yes. Although it is not ideal it is better than forcing Miss Parkinson to leave mealtimes early each time. I still hope for you to someday join us back in the Great Hall for meal times but in the meantime I don’t wish for you to only live off of sandwiches or whatever Miss Parkinson can safely smuggle away.”
date but we agreed to go into town together and hang out. I haven’t actually asked them out yet.”
Eventually, the tears stopped falling and he was able to breathe again.  With great hesitation, Draco looked to Potter, finding him with his nose in the potions book Draco had brought. Potter’s eyes quickly flickered from the book to him and back again.
Not that they didn’t spend time with each other on other occasions. Harry had sneaked into the dungeons and the Slytherin common room more times than he could count, always hiding under his invisibility cloak and taking care not to be noticed. A few times he had even slept next to Draco, the curtains closed tightly around the four-poster. But the ‘invisible time’, as they had dubbed it, just wasn’t the same compared to the hours spent in the Room of Requirement, the Prefect’s bathroom or even the most hidden corners of the extensive grounds. The willow next to the Black Lake bore witness to one of their dates,
A complete overview of the achievements and milestones in both Professor’s lives can be read on page 5.
Both women accepted his obvious unwillingness to talk about it and let it drop. Hastily looking for an alternative topic, Hermione offered to heal the fresh bruises at least.
He had grabbed some of the dried dittany from his workstation and had swiftly rounded his table. Keeping his voice friendly and low, Draco had reached one hand to touch Potters shoulder and said “You can still save it if you add one knife of these, stir counterclockwise thirteen times, wait for exactly seven seconds and then stir clockwise once. Then it should look the cerulean blue you were expecting and you can continue with step eight.” Draco had had his hands on Harry’s shoulder the whole time.
“What are you doing here? Why are you following me?” Harry hissed, wand still raised. The shock and confusion on Malfoy’s face vanished and a spiteful laugh escaped his lips.
Pansy revelled in seeing her best friend smiling again, and when Draco had laughed — actually laughed — the other day, her heart gave a little tug. It was good to be able to hear that sound again.
“Sure. I vaguely remember that to be one of the tedious to stir potions, right?” Harry asked, dropping his bag at their station. Draco smiled. Pepper-up was tedious to make precisely because of the exactly timed stirs it needed. Most medical potions were tedious; the timing and direction of stirs activating and deactivating different abilities of the added ingredients. He confirmed Harry’s suspicion and watched as the other set up a cauldron.
“I know this is weird before the first date, but you could join me, your bed is big enough for two and I promise not to do anything untoward.” Harry said rather sleepily. And he was right. Draco had a big bed, liking the comfort of having the space, and there was definitely room for them to share. And the couch was rather uncomfortable…
Over the ringing in his ears and the tight feeling in his chest Draco could only think about how the comparison would have been a compliment to him years ago. Now it felt like an insult. Lucius Malfoy was a bastard, a horrible father, and an even worse person and Draco had finally managed to see that. He didn’t want to be compared to the man he had once loved so blindly and each new word felt like another dagger in his chest.
Potter only nodded solemnly, and Draco dropped the topic. Both went back to silently working on their assignments. Draco was working on his astronomy notes for the next day, while Potter was still finishing the potions assignment due the next morning, occasionally interrupting Draco to ask some clarifying questions about it.
“Okay how about,” he stage-whispered to Teddy “I just put the mermaid into the bag as well and we just never tell Harry about it, deal?”
When Draco entered with Harry, both still looking a bit sleepy, David raised a knowing eyebrow and winked at Draco who in return only rolled his eyes. “Good morning David, do you still have room for 2?” he asked, knowing the answer would be yes. David would rather seat him in his own living room than send him away. David smiled and led them to a small table in the corner.
Potter nudged him with his elbow, but didn't say anything. A silent sort of understanding passed between the two as they continued to make their way through the stone walkways of the castle. Draco wasn't blind, he could see the obvious discourse between the trio lately. He knew he was not the only one who's noticed, either. Luna would not stop bringing it up, how Draco should intervene and try to help Potter with his "emotional baggage." Draco thought he was doing plenty of helping, thankyouverymuch. He was going to be saving Potter's
"I asked you if you needed another firewhiskey?"
“Good afternoon, Potter,” he said in his blue-stocking feet glory.
Hermione hit Harry with her I-Swear-to-God-Sometimes-You-Are-So-Stupid Look. "What are you talking about? Neville can do what he wants; he's a grown man." She motioned her fork at Harry, scrunching her brows together, making The Look all the more alienating. "Do I need to remind you that you are too?"
Suddenly, the dishes vanished from the dining tables and students were dismissed. Harry saw Hermione wipe at the corners of her eyes as they made their way to the carriages. He couldn’t blame her.
"You have a nice laugh," he said, brain too fuzzy and music too loud to really process it.
Harry let out a sigh. “It’ll be a new experience, that’s for sure.”
Ron was smiling back at her. So he'd known and not even bothered to tell Harry. Neither of them had. Well that was just
"Not if I plan on returning it." Draco moved to sit in his chair in front of the fireplace, back now to Potter.
Pansy shrugged, tugged on Nott's tie. "Loosen up, Theo. It is a party after all." And she walked away. Harry thought the exchange was quite odd, but who was he to judge?
"The only places I'm allowed to travel back and forth from are Hogwarts and my home-- and even then the Ministry tracks my every move." Draco pushed his shoulders back, refused to let go of his pride, even when there was so little of it left. "They see me as an ex-death eater, Potter. They aren't going to let me walk free just because wizard-kind's saviour asked politely."
"I'm sick of Runes and we aren't even half way through the year yet."
Harry rolled his eyes, then turned to face Ron. "Mate, you've gotta know what I'm talking about."
After making sure the passage was properly concealed, Harry made his way to Malfoy's side in front of the mirror that was the door to their common room. Neither of them bowed to it, staring at their own reflections. It was strange seeing how different they both looked, especially how different they looked
"Harry, you are so lucky they let you only take Potions next term with the seventh years. NEWT level Potions makes me want to throw my books into the fire."
looked away from the snitch. When he looked back in front of him, a feeling of dread filled his stomach. The snitch was nowhere to be seen.
In hindsight, Draco knew that this was an infeasible decision, but being sleep deprived and a little irritable now and then was much more manageable than the nightmares he was plagued with every night. The memories he'd tried to forget, to burn and drown and bury, they lived deep inside his inner psyche, only crawling out in the dead of night. The first time Draco woke his mother with his screams of terror, she thought he was dying. She thought someone had broken in and was in the process of carving him up like a Christmas ham. That's what happened in some of his dreams: Voldemort killing him and his family, torturing them with a blank expression while Nagini slithered across his neck. Draco could always feel the cuts and bruises even after he woke up. Other nights it was simply his father, the both of them sitting at the walnut desk in his office, telling Draco how disappointed he was in him. How Draco had brought shame to the Malfoy name. How he deserved the fate he'd received. Warmth surrounded him, on other nights, flames nipping at his fingertips, the screams of his childhood friends filling the air, a pair of green eyes his peace in the storm.
Harry grabbed some day clothes from their place in his and Ron's shared wardrobe as he said, "I think so." It was the first match of the season: Gryffindor against Slytherin. Harry and the rest of the team had been training quite hard to get up to par with what was rumoured to be the most talented Slytherin team yet. There were a few new faces, but Harry only cared about their captain-- and his rival seeker.
I've decided that, even though I have the next chapter or so written of NSWAS, I'm going to put this fic on hiatus. I've lost my passion for the HP fic community recently, and I'm sure it'll come back, but for now, I think it's best that I leave this story where it is. I hope you all can understand, and know that I do so with a heavy heart.
"I just do."
What Draco didn’t tell Harry was that Coq Au Vin was one of his childhood favourites. He also didn’t tell Harry how he was more than excited to try it.
"Well, I believe that is how one expresses distaste for another person, but please, correct me if I'm wrong."
Hermione sighs. "Of course he is, Ron. It's the obsessiveness we discussed earlier."
He visibly bristled at Draco's rudeness, but nonetheless obeyed. Draco sipped until the fatigue began to go away, but the headache persisted.
was the closest his life had ever been to "normal," wasn't it?
Hermione huffed, but said nothing, eyes still trained on the Slytherin girl who was now fixing a drink for someone on the other end of the bar. Suddenly, as Harry was trying to figure out who it was for, his vision began to swim and the scene around him was masked by green, red, and blue spots. As though the world had been tilted on its axis, Harry leaned far to the right and nearly fell of off his stool. Ron caught him by the elbow and kept him upright. "Oh. Hey, Ron." Harry said, as though he had just noticed his presence.
He expected to see passed out teenagers lying on the floor, snoring and drooling just as he'd been minutes earlier, but what he hadn't expected to see was Draco Malfoy: a person who thought himself too prim, too proper, and too damn rich to be cleaning up the half spilled cocktails of stupid eighteen year olds.
But now that Harry was thinking about it, why was Malfoy sitting next to Luna and not Astoria? He'd heard a rumour that they were together now, some sort of arranged relationship, pureblood tradition or whatever. But Harry'd only ever seen them together at the station. Never before, nor after. Something was off, and Harry didn't get it.
Harry chuckled dryly. She shot him a dirty look and hit him with a cushion.
“If you look around yourselves now, you will notice some empty seats at your tables. Many of our previous students chose not to return to Hogwarts this year, and frankly we cannot blame them. After the trials and tribulations we’ve all been through, those who wished for a break deserved to have that opportunity, and we hope to see them back at Hogwarts next year.”
Ginny smiled widely and gave Hagrid a wide hug. “Mum’ll surely send you Christmas cards as well. With bundles of popovers and treacle toffee!”
"Are you going?" Harry asked Hermione once they were out of earshot.
Suddenly, Harry's watch chimed, alerting him that it was 4:30.
"Indeed. And hopefully we won't be as distracted with all that 'saving the world' stuff this year."
Draco groaned. His head was pounding, and he was so, so tired. He pulled his flask out of his pocket. "Shut up, Potter."
The elf looked pleased with himself as he gathered the tea set. "Actually," Potter interrupted him, "You can leave that with me. I don't want to keep waking you up in the night for a cup of tea."
Ron looked between his best friend and his girlfriend. Hermione's dark cheeks reddened ever so slightly when he nodded his head at her. "Sorry, I kinda agree with 'Mione on this one."
And with that, he was on his way to the Great Hall, jogging to catch up with Dean who looked like he hadn't drunk his Pick Me Up yet. Harry finished tying his tie and spelling his hair tidy, too tired to dig through his trunk to find his hairbrush. Shoving on his sneakers, he began the walk through the commons, nodding in greeting to Parvati and Lavender, whose scarred face and eye patch were still hard for Harry to look at. He remembered seeing the aftermath of her encounter with Fenrir Greyback in the chaos of the Great Hall after the battle was fought; the healers who were there told him that they thought she wasn't going to make it through the night, but Madame Pomfrey wasn't having it. McGonagall later told Harry of how she used so much of her magic on Lavender that it had magically bonded them-- something Harry didn't even know was possible. He doesn't know the details of the situation, but he does know that the young lady spends a lot of time in the hospital wing and has ambitions of becoming a healer.
"Who's to say. Anyway, we should get going, or the "fox" is going to go feral." Ron nodded to Dean and Seamus, and they began to follow in his stride. "See you there tonight," he said with a bright smile. He patted Harry's shoulder over the back of the couch as he headed towards the girls' dorms, most likely to give Pansy her decorations.

So as first years gawked in astonishment and sixth years traded stories of the times they interacted with The Chosen One, Harry trudged on. The students parted for him like a river around a rock, and for some reason, it hurt. It made Harry feel helpless in a sense. Before the battle, people knew he was different, that he was special, yet they still treated him like any other student. But now, it felt like Harry was forced onto some sort of pedestal. Like he was an animal at the zoo, and all of these people who he thought were his friends were actually just onlookers, oohing and ahhing at him, begging him to do tricks. It felt like someone had hit a reset button, and he was just an anxious, little first year again, surrounded by curious spectators.
Potter walked over to him, didn't say anything. Just stood there like he didn't know what else to do.
"Goodnight!" Potter whisper-shouted as he opened the door to his room.
And suddenly that familiar melancholy feeling washed over Harry again. Hermione went on, smiling at her boyfriend, unaware of Harry's sudden change in demeanour. "My mum and dad have wanted to spend time with Ron for so long, and I've been practically living at the burrow all summer... They thought it'd be a wonderful opportunity."
"Potter." Standard greeting. Standard setting. The conversation didn't earn the strange looks from the two love birds that it received.
"Draco and I were having a discussion, Harry."
The fire warmed his stocking covered toes; although he was one to be sensitive to the cold, he'd grown accustomed to the incessantly chilly Slytherin dungeons, and has even grown to prefer the temperature to that of the rest of the castle. There was just something so comforting about sitting in front of a fire, holding his hands towards the flickering flames and feeling the heat lick at his fingertips.
"Is the team ready for the game today?" Neville asked, tugging off his pajama shirt.
McGonagall trained her sights on Harry once more. Her eyes caught his through her glasses, their chains glinting in the midafternoon sun. Harry was thankful for the buffer between her line of sight and his. "Ten points from Gryffindor. Now, spell your items back to their original state of being."
Anyways, I hope you like that kind of emotional, angsty kind of development, because I know I sure do!
Draco called after him, word sharp as a blade on his lips, "Goodnight!"
for Crowley's sake; he wasn’t the man's keeper. It was not his job to intrude on personal affairs. Now, if Potter invited him to do so, that'd be a different story. But regardless, Draco knew he shouldn't take on more than he'd already agreed to. He had his own demons to battle. Taking on Harry's problems as well as his own would do more harm than good, and he had grown enough as a person to recognise that.
“Maybe at the beginning?”
Potter tutted and began scratching out his answer. Draco smiled a little, despite himself.
"Hey, Chosen One," Pansy drawled, cleaning out a glass at the makeshift bar he was sitting at. Two dressers from one of the girls' dorms must have been Locomotor-ed into the common room and filled with most-definitely illegally conjured alcohol. Though Harry was too buzzed to care, if he was being honest.
Anywho, answering the important question: this fic probably won't be out for a few days. I'm going to get at least halfway through before starting posting, so the first chapter (the prologue) should be out soon. Hope to see some of you guys over there :]
be. Most of the conversations featured words like "brave" and "hero" and "courageous," but Harry didn't feel that he deserved to be called those things. Shit happened, people died, and Harry just waltzed into the woods and was about to leave it all behind. He knew that he did it because it was the only way to defeat Voldemort, but he also did it because... he was just done. He was tired, so, so tired and for a moment, he didn't just accept the inevitability of death, he
"I am aware," the portrait said, nodding slightly. Draco huffed as he misspelled Rembrandt; he always forgot the D. "But I think that part of you wants to talk about it. Or rather, part of you needs to talk about it."
Sweet Aristophanes, Draco really liked to make life more difficult for himself sometimes. "I'll do it."
She shrugged and smirked slyly.  “I have my sources. But you still better be coming over for Christmas day, even with the Ferret. Everyone’s gonna be home: Bill and Fleur, Percy and Audrey, George, Ron— even Charlie’s coming home for the week. Said he’s bringing someone special.”
"Oh, sod off, Malfoy." He stood, brushing cake and biscuit crumbs from his lap."I'll leave you alone since that's what you oh so desire."
Draco not only owed Harry his help, but he
Kreacher poured Draco his cup and handed it to him. "Thank you, Kreacher."
His eyes were shining with pure, unadulterated
Draco Malfoy," Harry hissed at her. "He was up to something--"
(new user and nickname bc my friends keep trying to find my account LOL anyways emma and ari if u see this hi, i love u, but also get out /lh)
"Kreacher will have to discuss it further with the house and the mistress," the house elf rubbed his neck anxiously, eyes darting from his feet to Potter and back again, "but he is quite sure."
Draco nodded to him, bowing his own head slightly. "Of course, Kreacher."
"What're you reading?"
Sweet Aristophanes Draco Malfoy was going to explode if this git doesn't--
Since Hermione is taking one more class than Harry and Ron, they sit alone together in front of the fireplace at four o'clock, Harry writing his DADA essay and Ron doing some Potions homework.
Harry's face flushed, and the way he bashfully scratched his neck only made Draco want to slap him even more. "I've read a lot about them, and Kreacher will be there to help so..."
She cackled then. A full-on loud, brassy cackle. But it was so fitting, so charming, and Harry felt like she was showing him a part of herself that she didn't normally show, too. Her cheeks were flushed, not as much as Harry's were bound to be, but enough that he could tell she was at least buzzed. Which meant she probably wasn't showing him the softer-side of herself on purpose. Regardless, she grabbed a second shot glass and filled it up after Harry's, raising it to a toast. "To getting fucking wasted."
So he dragged himself to the master bedroom and unpacked his trunk, lost in thought. The grey wallpaper was not the most comforting sight, and his allergies were acting up from the slight dust that had gathered on the furniture since Kreacher’s last cleaning.
Draco nodded, following Harry down into the kitchen. “I should never trust you to make an edible meal, Potter, if your potion’s skills have any indication of such talents in the kitchen.”
Dean leaned on Seamus' shoulder. "Parkinson decided to throw a little eighth year get-together tonight after curfew. Gonna be some drinks, apparently."
It was sleeting in London. Harry loved the cold, but sleet was the worst. Hail, snow, and rain all in one? No thank you. He and Draco were lucky enough to be able to apparate to Grimmauld place, so they thankfully didn’t get too covered in the slush. Stomping off their boots, the two boys lugged their trunks into the foyer. They shrugged off their travelling cloaks with shivering hands, and as Malfoy took off his boots, Harry called for Kreacher to get a fire going in the lounge.
But that didn't stop him from asking questions when they finally sat down at a more secluded spot in the library. Not without a nasty look from Madam Pince, of course. "Trouble in paradise?"
“Students and staff,” she began, “I thank you for another wonderful fall term at Hogwarts. I know how strange and difficult this year must have been for you, and I would personally like to congratulate you for all of the hardwork and effort you’ve put in.
Harry shrugged, feigning defeat. "I dunno. Guess it was just out of reach."
Harry's eyes scanned over faces and robes and brooms, searching for that familiar glint. It always felt a little tedious, at the beginning, but that's what Harry loved about Quidditch: the way it riled him up, the thrill of the chase. He'd always been good at sports, but not enough to make the team-- nor was he liked enough to be chosen for one. Always last to be picked, but always ended up on the winning team. It made him resent playing sports for a long time. But then, he was thrown into Quidditch, and he fell in love with it. Because, for once, he felt like he truly belonged on a team, like he could lead it freely and without reserve, without fear. Maybe that's why he yearned to be chief in command once more.
Over the past few days, my Great Grandmother's health has been declining rapidly. This is unexpected, and we've been told that she has probably about a week left at the most. I was not really that close to her, but at this point, death has sort of become an annual thing for me in my life-- always coming around December/January-- so I was already kind of down to begin with, but now I have to be strong for my family. Especially my mother, who was very close to my great grandmother and is struggling right now. Which means, I have been very stressed these last few days, not only because of all That but also because of exams and online school. It's just been a tough few weeks for me...
That was all Harry said, mumbled as he kept his eyes cast down on his paper and continued working. If Draco hadn’t been looking at him over his books, he wouldn’t have even noticed.
"G'morning, Harry!" Neville greeted, rubbing the sleep from his eyes, as Harry drew back the curtains of his bed.
Alright, I think I've rambled enough about this! Again, I'm so sorry about NSWAS-- but who knows, maybe I'll pick it back up later. And until then, look forward to all of the new content I have coming! Sending love and well wishes.
The silence after those words was deafening. Harry didn’t move a muscle, but he could feel the old anger burning beneath his skin. He took a deep breath and forced a smile. “Well, there’s nothing much up here anyhow,” he made his way towards the stairs as he spoke, refusing to wait for Draco and Kreacher to begin their descent. “I suppose I’ll let you unpack and get settled. Kreacher put your luggage in the last bedroom on the third floor; if you don’t like the room, feel free to move to any of the others on that floor. Dinner will be ready at six.”
"Mum's still expecting you over break, Harry," Ron somehow got out around a mouthful of sausage and toast. "I'll be back Christmas day, too. That was our deal."
And thus by the time they sat down at the table, Draco was absolutely famished. The smell had been driving him crazy for nearly half an hour, and he snuck pieces of potato and mushroom when Harry wasn’t looking. But now sitting across from each other once more, Draco raised his glass of mead high in the air, a smile gracing his features. “To healing the wards,” he said.
Potter's face remained in a state of perplexity, though he remained silent.
it. It was selfish and cowardice in Harry's eyes, and he hated being forced to give speeches and go to galas and shake hands and sign autographs to people who think he was just doing what was right.
“I’ll make sure to stop by next week to visit,” Harry said, going in for his own hug. “Even if I have to drag Malfoy along with me,” he added on quietly, so that only Hagrid could hear.
"No," Draco furrowed his brow. "You are the last person I want to--"
“Just to spend time with father. I’ll also be going to visit Mr. Ollivander; chatting with him always clears away some of his wrackspurts. I think I remind him of his daughter.”
_____________
"So..." Potter interrupted Draco's thoughts about, well, Potter. "What exactly do you need help with?"
Draco began collecting his things, putting the cork on his ink bottle and returning his quill to its case.
"Alright." Potter's face revealed that he was a bit unsure of what Kreacher meant by "discuss it... with the house" but Draco kept his mouth shut.
“‘Mione has sort of claimed this room as her own, now,” Harry said with a small smile. “She would sneak off to read when Ron and I got into a match of chess or started talking about Quidditch.”
Throughout their time spent together, Draco had learned a lot about Harry Potter. He knew how Potter took his tea, how much he hated Runes class, and how he could never seem to shut up when Draco needed silence. Even though working with Potter-- if you could call it that-- was strange, he made a better study partner than Draco would ever have thought. He took diligent notes (when he actually was paying attention in class) and seemed eager to do well. The way he always seemed like he was trying to prove himself to everyone, it was familiar to Draco. Familiar in a way that still hurt too much to describe. And although Draco would like to think he knew Potter pretty well by now, studying and small talk was about as personal as it got between them. The things they discussed were all quite surface level. Any conversations about more personal topics were strictly off limits, and both tended to stay away from subjects of the like. And if something like that did happen to come up, it almost always turned into an argument, or an awkward silence at the very least. Draco was good at pretending he didn't notice them, but Potter was a nightmare; he'd fidget, clear his throat, tap his quill, bounce his leg-- almost like he was trying to get under Draco's skin. But despite all of Potter's constant whining and complaining and not so subtle glaring at Draco... it was nice to have company. It was nice to bicker with someone other than Dumbledore's portrait at three a.m., and it was nice for it to be Potter. Draco-- although he'd never say it outloud-- was thankful for the opportunity to finally get to know and spend time with him; he'd be lying if he tried to deny the sort of attraction he'd always had toward the boy. It was the kind of chemistry that one couldn't describe. It tended to remind him of Mercutio and Tybalt, always dancing around each other, always picking a fight without good reason. Draco supposed that if he and Potter were the two duelists, then Neville or Luna would be their Benvolio. Typical.
Lavender smiled back at Harry now, the shiny pink claw marks on her face stretching and contorting. Harry felt a wave of uneasiness run through him as he made his way through the portrait hole.
Draco ignored him, or attempted to. It was only a matter of seconds before Potter repeated his question.
A small snicker is heard from the corner where the writing desk sat. Leaning against the side of it was a smug looking Kreacher. Draco shot him a look, but said nothing. The elf immediately stood to attention and bowed, mumbling quiet apologies.
"Oh. Malfoy," Potter's eyes widened with his greeting. It was only a little bit pathetic. "Hey."
Draco shot a look at the portrait. "Go to sleep, you old coot."
"I'm planning on Christmas break; can it wait that long?" Potter took an obnoxious sip of his drink. Draco rolled his eyes.
Potter adjusted his glasses. "What makes you think you're qualified to save this house?"
The table was stacked with a wide spread of eggs, pancakes, biscuits and gravy, and fruit. Pitchers were near overflowing with pumpkin juice and mulled wine (non-alcoholic, of course), and mugs with piping hot tea and coffee were being sipped from gingerly on that cold morning. The house elves truly had outdone themselves with the special breakfast, and Harry’s stomach growled just looking at it.
Draco hated parties. Having to sit through dozens of cocktail parties and business dinners in starchy suits every weekend during his childhood left an everlasting hatred for them within Draco. He didn't like people, he didn't like dancing, and he surely didn't like "inter-house cooperation," or whatever the fuck Pansy called it. And now here he was, cleaning up other people's shit at three in the goddamn morning. Draco huffed, spelling away the cups that were on the mantel above the fireplace. Within the hour he'd cleaned up most of the trash (and one vomit-covered plant... Draco was on the fringe of silencio-ing Pansy permanently so that she could never voice these abhorrent ideas), but Draco still hadn't a clue as to how he was going to move the bureaus that Pansy had used as bars back into the girls' dorm rooms without waking anyone. He was thinking about what to do while spelling away a tray of browning fruit when he heard someone approach him from behind. He whipped around, pointing his wand at them. (Which was pointless, and everyone in the damn wizarding community knew it too. As a part of his sentencing from the Ministry of Magic, he was to use a Ministry-issued wand until the end of his studies, when he would have a retrial to evaluate if he was prepared to be a "decent, contributing member of Wizarding society.")
He shrugged again. Before Draco could snap at him, however, he mumbled out, "She's not. She's got plans."
“Kreacher knows Master Draco has been in the house before, and nothing much has changed since he was last here, but Kreacher must show you the drawing room at the very least—”
Draco chuckled and continued on. “Things are probably not so cheery and perfect with the new couple as they seem. I’d just give them the time and space they need to figure out how this new dynamic is going to work.” He paused, picking up his quill to resume Harry’s runes work. “But if it’s really bothering you, Harry, I suggest you—” (Potter looks at him with wide eyes. It was rare that Draco called him by his first name. The blond pretended he didn’t notice the heat rising in his cheeks as he continued.) “—bring it up to them. Probably the Weasel first; He seems like he’d be more comfortable talking with you about his love life.”
“Quite. I’ve spent most of the time in the library though. My late Uncle seems to lack in books about ward healing…”
Hello! I just wanted to say that this chapter was about 1k-2k words longer than most of the other chapters will be! The point of that being I needed to fit as much in as I could in this chapter before the actual story was introduced. This was sort of like a prologue, but the next chapter will pick up right where this one left off. Anyway, thanks for reading my work :)
After the meal, when the entire student body was in a near comatose state, Minerva McGonagall, headmistress of Hogwarts, stood. The room went silent with her commanding presence, and every person in the room was captivated by her words.
The second was that he told himself that he'd never sleep again.
When he awoke, drool dripping onto his pillow, tie knot digging into his clavicle, the room was pitch black. Harry was panting hard and his heart was thumping as though he had just run a mile, and he wasn't sure why. Another nightmare, he presumed. Probably the same one he'd been having for a few months now, but could never seem to remember.
Draco righted his posture. "Watch me."
Draco had walked over to a framed painting on the wall and was viewing it with a strange look in his eye. “That would be lovely.”
"I trust you." Draco's eyebrows shot up; that's the only thing that told Harry that he was surprised to be hearing this. "Maybe not with my life, but... I trust you not to take it, either," he said, and he didn't really know what else to say, but he just kept talking, trying to prove some point that he wasn't even sure he wanted to make. "I trust you to not be evil. I can tell that you've changed, or that maybe I misjudged you before, I don't know, but I'm hoping that--" he looked away from Draco's reflection, eyeing his own in the mirror. It was easier to say this to his own face rather than Malfoy's. "--Maybe I can try to figure that out. You've actually been a decent human being recently, contrary to popular belief, but you're still a know it all. And just a real prick, but--"
Harry's been doing that a lot too, lately: getting so caught up in his thoughts, in his head, that he couldn't remember doing things. His body kept going while his mind stayed rooted in place, stuck in the quicksand of whatever dark thoughts that had momentarily consumed his being. But he tried not to think about it too much, because the more he thought, the more stuck he felt and the more panicky he became, and it was a metaphysical roundabout that Harry couldn't seem to get out of. So, despite not really remembering the walk there, Harry ignored his stupid brain and made his way to his usual spot. He plopped down across from Hermione and poured himself a cup of tea. They bid each other good morning and exchanged other pleasantries-- far too formal for people who were supposed to be best friends. But that's how things were between them now. Harry missed his friend, yet she was sitting right in front of him.
Kreacher’s energy was as palpable as ever but he sneered when they approached the first door on the right. “Kreacher will not waste the Masters’ time with that room, as it is the… blood traitor’s old dwelling.”
Potter sat on the hideous purple velvet couch, yawning. He had a book in his hand, Draco now noticed. As he opened it, spine cracking in the process, he called out for Kreacher, just as he did the night before.
"Hey there, Granger. Would you like something to drink?" Pansy Parkinson purred at her. She leaned forward onto the opposite side of the bar, an arm draped around Nott's waist as she did so.
She smirked. "Comin' right up."
Kreacher straightened like a rod, eyes glazing over with intention. "Master Harry has asked Kreacher for a cup of tea. Is no trouble for Kreacher to make him his tea, Master Draco. Kreacher lives to serve his masters," lowering his voice as so Potter wouldn't hear, "Regardless of their blood status."
"Oh, no reason." He decided not to bring up his troubles with Grimmauld Place. He'd just have to spend some extra time in the library to figure out how in God's name he was going to save that house.
EDIT: In case you are a reader who has been with me since the beginning of this fic (hi! I love you!!), you may notice that there is half of the chapters than originally published. This is no accident! I ended up combining chapters to make them a bit longer and to overall have a more cohesive reading experience. Nothing has changed plot-wise-- the only difference is that chapters one/two are now one chapter, three/four are now one chapter, so on and so forth. Thanks for bearing with me while I work out the oddities of writing lol
Harry yawned in response, slipping on his slippers.
"Wait," he reached out towards her, not close enough to touch her, but far enough that it caught her eye. " 'Nother shot?"
"M-Master Draco!" He'd shouted, voice just as low and scratchy as Draco remembered it being all those years ago. "It is an honor to see the Master here."
She sighed and snuggled deeper into the blanket. "I know. But with this whole eighth year dorms arrangement, I just feel a little... out of place, I suppose."
Harry debated. His consumption of alcohol up to this point had been somewhat temperate; did he really want to get smashed tonight? He didn't have classes in the morning, so it's not like he had anything to worry about... and it might actually help him get a decent night's sleep for once.
I've been struggling with writing lately (ironic for a future writing major lol) and have been starting so many things and never finishing them. But I had an idea two nights ago, one that I am really invested in. So I'm going to advertise it here, see if anyone is interested in the premise too! It's going to be a Dream SMP fic, so if you're not into that, feel free to click off. Thanks for reading, and I hope you're doing well <3
anyone? So Harry shot him a dirty look and scribbled down something about changing an object's state of matter.
Potter stood there, awkward. He broke eye contact with Draco and walked to the other side of the room. Draco wanted to say that he had put all of his childish hatred and envy for the Chosen One aside, but he was tired and his head hurt and he hated the fact that Potter seemed like a completely different, in fact almost tolerable, person and Draco just couldn't help but be short with him. He remembered how he'd looked at the train station earlier that day, scraggly teenage-esque stubble, obnoxious glasses slightly askew on his nose... Hera, just thinking about it caused something to stir in Draco. What exactly, he didn't even want to know.
Potter inhaled deeply. “Myself. It was a lot of trial and error.”
Luna nodded. “He did. She’s dead now, though. Prepared a potion with cowbane plant incorrectly, died the next morning. She was our age, too.”
Draco nodded ever so slightly. "Yes, coming. Good day to you, Potter."
Harry was sitting through his third hour of classes-- Transfiguration with the Slytherins. He was having a hard time paying attention to McGonagall as she lectured about the proper eloquence of a solid-to-liquid transformation spell. His head was just full of too many thoughts. He'd stopped by the library during lunch and checked out a book (yes, he checked it out rather than stole it, thankyouverymuch) about wards--
It was surprisingly warm out on the pitch; the sun shone bright in the middle of a stunning blue sky, no clouds in sight, and the temperature had creeped up to a brisk 7 degrees celsius. Although the air itself wasn't all that warm, the sunlight draped across Harry's shoulders like a blanket. The cheering of hundreds of students and staff members alike followed Harry and his team as they made their way to the centre of the field, brooms in hand. Madam Hooch greeted the Gryffindors and their opposing team. "Alright, first game of the season. Most of ya have done this before, but for our first timers: welcome to your respective team. Now, captains, please step forward."
When he paused, Draco looked up, his quill poised above the paper. “Weird how?” He prompted.
Draco was cast out of his stupor by Potter's monosyllabic agreement. He nodded, a little surprised at how quickly Potter came to his decision. "Well, good. I'll make arrangements with my probation auror to stay at Grimmauld Place over the holiday." Draco began to grab the items necessary to draft the letters required of him. "The Ministry is bound to go overboard with paperwork, so I'll bring you your share of it as soon as possible."
Malfoy was there. The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Persephone scanned the room, “Morning, Malfoy.”
He shook his head. "Nah, not really. I'm just drunk," he leaned his elbows on the table, resting his head on his hands. "No charm. "
In the midst of Draco's work, when he was most focused, finally able to lose himself in the words, the scratch of quill on parchment-- Dumbledore decided to ask one of the Forbidden Questions.
Hermione made a sour face. "She's not really like that... a fox, you know. That's all just gossip, right?"
Before Draco could snap at Potter for his incessant talking, Kreacher returned with a tray of small cakes and tea in his hands, steam billowing from the spout of the pot. "Kreacher apologises to his Masters for the inconvenience," he began preparing Harry's cup, pouring the black liquid in the traditional Black family way: he held the pot high above the cup (the Blacks preferred sharp, more pronounced flavours in their tea) and swirling the cup three times counterclockwise before giving it to the drinker. Potter said his thanks and shoved a madeline in his mouth. Blowing on the drink, he held it in his hands like he was in a Madam Puddifoot's advert. Draco was too busy watching Potter's mannerisms to hear what Kreacher had said, but Potter was nodding in response.
"You smell," he breathed in again, relishing the scent, "Rully good, Ronny."
--shut up.
. They were so... grown up. They were completely different people than when they first met, and it made Harry's skin crawl thinking of their first meeting back in Madam Malkin's. Harry's eyes met Malfoy's-- the same piercing gray they've always been.
"Good evening, Master Har--" the house elf noticed Draco sooner than last night. Kreacher's eyes lit up and he bowed deeply to him. "Master Draco, a pleasure it is to see you!"
Draco’s voice was quiet and contemplative. “Because it is dying, Potter. And magic is life.”
"Look at Longbottom. What's he
Harry scoffs. "Neville could get a lion to purr. But that's not the point--" he turns to look at Neville, telling some story to the two Slytherins, talking with his hands and face more than his mouth. "What I'm saying is that we spend all these years hating them, fighting and squabbling with them, just so we can become all chummy in the end? Doesn't it seem a little suspect to you?"
Suddenly, Ginny appeared at Harry’s side. “Hey, Luna. You look lovely today.”
Luna, who was wearing an oversized sweater and a floor length skirt with bulky brown combat boots, smiled bashfully at Ginny. “Thank you. Your eyes are very bright today. Excited for Christmas?”
Draco rolled his eyes, the urge to break Potter's jaw growing by the second. He was the last person Draco wanted to see at three a.m. "Really? I wasn't aware."
“Yes, Master Draco.”
He found his wand pointing at Harry Bloody Potter. Draco sneered, lowering his defences. Potter stood there, shirtless, mouth hanging open like he never learned how to shut it. Sweet Sarah Kane, he wanted to punch his stupid face.

"What are you drinking?"
The people around the boys were dancing, pushing into them. It was nice, the contact with other people, though unintentional. Harry didn't touch other people— or get touched by other people— often, besides Hermione, and Ginny when they were a couple. Touching Ron was nice too, almost in the same way. But it felt nicer for some reason, more secure. Ron was strong, not like, body-builder level, but as fit as Harry was. And he smelled so damn good. Like pine, peppermint, and something distinctly... masculine. Harry leaned close to Ron's neck and breathed in deeply.
So he did. Harry followed Malfoy's suit and continued his hunt for the golden snitch. The game went on, the points totalling out 70:60 to Gryffindor by the time either seeker saw the snitch again. This time, it was Malfoy who spotted it first. He'd been only about five meters away from Harry when he'd suddenly dashed to his right, dodging a bludger before zig zagging his way towards the Slytherin goals. Harry noticed the snitch just after reaching Malfoy: it was zipping back and forth from the left goal post to the right. Harry steered his broom right next to Malfoy, literally neck-and-neck. The snitch suddenly took off, causing Harry and Malfoy to speed after it, past the other players, above the crowd, and then down closer to the ground. Harry was soaring through the air, trying to gain some vantage over Malfoy, when the snitch darted upward. The boys followed, speeding up, up, up into the sky. As they did, Harry looked over to Malfoy and saw something he never expected.
to help Harry. He truly wanted to, and perhaps that was the worst part of this whole debacle.
Harry smiled are her. "Will do." Then he downed the shot and, forgetting to bite his tongue afterword, burst out laughing. Pansy snorted, holding a hand over her mouth to hide her smile. Harry had never seen her do either, genuinely at least.
The boys kept making their way through the crowd, until someone bumped into Ron and decided to strike up a conversation. Harry's vision was swimming, the scene in front of him constantly dipping and swaying at this point, and his legs felt like they were about to walk off without him. The hall to the boys' dormitory was in sight, so he tugged on Ron's sleeve like a little kid at Tesco's, silently pleading with his mum to stop talking to Cathy from the PTA because it'd been fifteen minutes and he wanted to go home. Ron looked to the door of the dormitory and then, apparently thinking Harry was sober enough to get himself there, said, "Go ahead, I'll just be a minute."
. . .
When Ron joined them, things became a little easier. Hermione was always more talkative with him around, and words seemed to come more naturally to Harry when Ron was a part of the conversation. But it still made his stomach turn to think that his friendship with Hermione relied on Ron's presence so heavily now. It made his tea taste bitter and his toast taste stale.
"Wizarding families tend to pick a place and stay in it, as I'm sure you're aware," Draco began explaining. "The homes that wizards build have magic within them-- in their walls, in their foundations, in the land itself-- and over time, if lived in by a bloodline long enough, can grow sentient. They develop feelings and habits and such just as any other wizard would. And if a member of that family leaves or passes on, the house loses some of its magic."
The professor took a long pause. Harry felt the energy in the room shift, and suddenly his mulled wine tasted a little sour. “But some of the other empty seats will never be filled,” McGonagall continued, “and I think that many of you children have come to terms with that on your own. Regardless, this holiday season will be hard on everyone. Please, I beg of you, hold your loved ones close this holiday. Be patient. Be kind. And remember: There is always a place for you here at Hogwarts.
The rest of the Gryffindor team patted him on the back, telling him to shake it off. "We'll get 'em next time, won't we, Harry?"
Because, honestly, a blushing Malfoy was the last thing he'd expected to see today.
"Sorry, just thinking. What're you reading?"
Hermione tsked. "You all know that we do have classes tomorrow morning, right?"
He smiled, turning back to Malfoy, who was talking animatedly to his teammates, still holding the snitch. His voice came out softer than he intended, filled with emotion. "Oh, definitely."
He and Malfoy had been teasing each other for weeks about the first match of the season. They talked big, sure, but it was all in good fun. This was the first time Harry would face off against Malfoy and not have the mad desire of rubbing his outstanding victory in the blond's face. (Okay, he definitely would still rub it in his face, but out of camaraderie rather than loathing.) It was strange for Harry to be enjoying this weird sort of friendship with Malfoy, but he just... he needed a friend. Hermione and Ron were drifting further away each day, and things were still a little awkward between Dean and Seamus ever since the whole kissing thing at the beginning of the year. (Which was ridiculous; it was obvious they liked each other, but they just wouldn't admit it.) And the only other person who didn't treat Harry like some-- some
"You, dear Ronald, get nothing."
"Then I don't see why he just doesn't join the two of you," Draco said snarkily. "The Big Three, The Golden Trio-- saving the world and collapsing homes since '91."
"Oh, for Heaven's sake, Ronald, he's had more to drink than you."
Harry nodded. “She volunteered to clean and reorganise the room. We all helped her intermittently, of course, but the majority of the work was done by herself.”
"Molly, they aren't children anymore–"
God, Harry hated himself.
He tried to focus on his surroundings to ground himself. Ron was snoring deeply and he could hear the breathing of who he assumed was Dean and Seamus as well. He propped himself up with his elbow, hissing at the pounding at the back of his head. He didn't feel very nauseous though, so he closed his curtains, tugged off his trousers and undid his tie and button up, and attempted to go back to sleep. But as soon as his head hit the pillow, he knew that wasn't going to happen. He allowed himself to lay there for a few minutes, praying for sleep to take him before he sighed and got up, deciding to get some tea from the kitchens. That's what he always did when he couldn't sleep, drank a cup or two of tea. It never got him to go back to sleep, but it did settle his nerves. So he tugged on some pajama bottoms and made his way out of the room. Since he wasn't used to the new layout, he tripped over a trunk and a pile of books next to Seamus' bed (or at least he assumed it was Seamus' bed... he couldn't tell in the dark.) on his way. Muttering a string of curse words under his breath he made it out into the hall. Holding his foot with one hand, he leaned against the cold, stone wall and cast a quick tempus.
