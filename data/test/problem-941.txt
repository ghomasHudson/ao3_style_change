Hermione blushed. "I am so incredibly embarrassed by my behaviour. I am so sorry and thank you Severus for helping me." She smiled shyly.
James grunted. “This can’t be happening! You want to be friends with a Death Eater? Are you out of your mind?” He sighed. “It’s bad enough our son is marrying into a Death Eater family!” Everyone was shocked by what he said.
Harry squeezed her hand back and smiled warmly. "We actually kissed and it felt like fireworks were going off in my head. I never had felt that before. It was an incredible feeling! I can't wait for us to kiss again but I'll try to be patient. I don't want to mess this up. I really care about him and I want a future with him."
Harry looked away and blushed. “Uh, Dray is doing well at Grimmauld Place. He’s settling in quite nicely.” He bit his lip nervously.
"I told him I would owl him. I have never been this excited except when I am flying or playing quidditch." Draco said happily.
Draco looked stunned. “Harry, really? She gave her blessing? Though I am not surprised in the least. She is quite fond of you. I would be honoured to take your last name. Oh Merlin! The Prophet would go mad with the news of their Saviour taking the Malfoy name. And my mother has spoken quite a lot about you over the years. Though, in the more recent years, she has nothing but lovely things to say and she can be quite tender. I am happy she thinks of you as a son. I know how rough your childhood was. You can not have too many mothers especially if they are like Molly and my mother.” He smiled sweetly at Harry.
Sirius gave Narcissa a smile. “I do not think anyone can top this wedding gift. You outdid yourself, Malfoy.” He smirked.
Severus followed her into the kitchen. She started to prepare the tea. “Hello, Hermione. It was good of you to invite me. I have missed you.” Hermione blushed when he called her “love” and smiled at him. “Um, Hermione, there is something of great import that I would like to discuss with you.” He looked nervously at her.
Hermione smirked. "Good morning you two. As much as I wished that I was not privy to this display of affection, I am happy for you both. Draco, why are you at Harry's? Not that it is not nice to see you again. And Harry, I am sorry to interrupt your morning but I wanted to see how you were doing."
Severus stroked Hermione’s hair. “I love you with my whole being.” He blushed. “Bloody hell Granger! You have turned me into a soppy git.” He chuckled lightly.
Draco cuddled closer to Harry after he performed wandless magic to clean them. “Bloody hell, Potter. That was brilliant.” He smirked at Harry.
Severus lifted his hand and placed it under her chin. He gently moved her head until he was looking her straight in the eye. “Hermione, neither have I. This feeling is new to me as well.” He smiled softly at her.
Hermione just stared at him dumbfounded. “Of course I will help you but I do not understand what has gotten you into this frenzy. Please explain.”
Hermione sat on her bed and gestured Severus to do the same. She bit her lip nervously. “Sev, I have never felt this strongly for anyone in my life like I do you.” She looked away embarrassed.
Severus looked a bit surprised by her what she said. “I want nothing more than to have you with me always.” He kissed her forehead. “Not to sound presumptuous but when we live together you will have more than enough room to house all your books in bookcases rather than using the floor as a shelf.” He chuckled lightly.
After they took the Polyjuice, they waited for the changes to occur. Once they had, the Golden Trio vanished into the Floo. After a moment, they arrived in Diagon Alley.
Hermione started giggling. "That is definitely a sight to be seen for sure. Let me know how that goes when you do go with Draco. I could use a good laugh."
Harry nodded. "Whatever you need, Draco. I'll be there whenever you decide to go. I would never abandon you. I promise." He smiled.
Draco could hear Harry unlock the door. Harry looked a bit shocked to see who was on the other side of his front door but quickly recovered and ushered Draco inside.
Harry tiptoed his way down the stairs once again. He checked the time once more. Surprisingly he was a bit early but he knew Narcissa would not mind. He apparated out of Grimmauld Place hoping Draco would not be cross with him for leaving without saying goodbye. If he was, he would make it up to Draco somehow. When he apparated into the Manor, he stumbled like he always did.
Once settled in the bed, they slowly kissed. Draco pulled away a bit. “Harry love, let us sleep.” He snuggled into Harry’s side with his head on his shoulder.
Ron gave Hermione a strange look. "Bloody hell! If either of you think this is going to end well, you're both daft!" He shook his head.
Harry pulled back. “Let’s get this over with. I’ll get the chocolate.” He gave Draco a peck on the lips and left to go upstairs.
Harry smiled. "You're very welcome then. I didn't know he was that strict but I'm also not surprised. I'm happy your mother is much more accepting. Wait if you weren't into Krum or Diggory, the only other guy was me. You couldn't possibly have had a thing for me! We were rivals and you absolutely despised me! Or am I completely wrong? I'm extremely confused."
Hermione gazed at Severus for a moment. "Sev, it is reassuring to know that you were not entirely repulsed by a muggleborn's hug. But as much as I would like to continue our little banter, I really need to get back to my parents. We should have tea at some point in the future. I would very much like to get know you more." She gave him a sickeningly sweet smirk.
"That is wonderful to hear my darling. I am truly happy for you. Slow can be good. It will give you a chance to get to know one another. Have you made plans to see each other again?" Narcissa smiled at her son.
Remus chuckled lightly. “Siri love.” He kissed Sirius on the cheek and looked at Narcissa. “I think what Sirius meant to say is thank you. We all appreciate what you did.” He smiled at her.
Molly interrupted the greetings. “I called you four here for a purpose. Ronald, get your arse over here.” She gave her son a tight smile. Ron walked into the room with his head down. “Now do the right thing.” She nodded to him.
Draco was so happy to hear that Harry felt the same way. "All of us hanging out is a lovely idea actually. Anyways umm, it's getting late and I don't want your friends to worry I have kidnapped you or something."
"Yes we do have quidditch in common. We should have a seekers game sometime if you ever return to the Manor. As for interests, I could start with what I do in my spare time. I have been playing piano since I was a child. I always found peace playing. Especially during the darker time living in the Manor. I needed the distraction sadly." Draco said softly.
Severus actually gave Harry a genuine smile. "Potter, there is no need to call me Professor any longer. Please call me Snape or Severus. Whatever you are more comfortable with. Honestly it was not my idea to bring you here but I am thankful you are. Narcissa insisted that I contact you. As for your feelings towards my godson, he deserves to be happy and he is when he is around you. That is all that matters. His happiness." He smiled softly.
Draco scoffed at him. As he was about to respond, the floo chimed and Hermione poked her head out. "Sorry for the intrusion but you might want to look out your front door, Harry. Though that was not the real reason for my visit. It appears that Ron still has not changed his tune about you and Draco sadly. And this is after Molly scolding him for his behaviour. He is being so unbelievably stubborn and unreasonable about this. I just thought I would warn you about the nonexistent progress regarding Ron. Ohh sorry for my rudeness, hello Draco! It is nice to see you again." She smiled warmly at Draco.
Severus look very perturbed. "Very well, Narcissa. I will let this go. Thank you for taking care of my godson, Potter. I appreciate it." He nodded curtly at Harry.
Draco got up and left the room. Harry followed. Both sat on the sofa again and stared at one another.
Blaise sighed. “Pansy quit your bitching! The bloody war is over so get over yourself already! Harry extended an olive branch to both of us because he is concerned for Draco. He did not invite us here just for you to attack him. Please behave yourself!” He snarled at her.
Ginny smiled at her girlfriend. “Luna, you are my angel.” She kissed her on the cheek. “Draco, my mum is right. The past should stay in the past. Welcome to the family.”
Severus gave her hand a gentle squeeze. "I am delighted that everything worked with your parents and they were not too cross with you. You were quite fortunate to find a way to slip away from being a relationship with Weasley so easily. Most are not that lucky."
Severus chuckled. “I am very sorry how beastly Ron was acting. You did not deserve it. If it had not been you, I am sure another would have punched him. I am sure of it. As for Draco, he can be quite an arse when he wants to be. I would have loved to witness you punching my godson.”
Harry sheepishly glanced at Draco. “Dray, I despise seeing you so down. I thought you could use some cheering up. I owled them. I know we were planning to have them over at some point in the future but I thought it couldn’t wait.” He blushed a bit.
Narcissa smirked. “Well, it looks to me that your little date with your witch went smashingly well considering that smile plastered on your face right now. Please do share the details.” She looked at him curiously.
As Draco entered the sitting room, he saw his mother conversing with Potter quite amiably. He smiled at the sight. He had not seen his mother this animated in awhile.
Remus shook his head at Sirius’ antics. “Siri love, I think it might be a bit soon for that kind of gesture. Besides, I do not see Severus hugging us. Maybe hexing us, rightfully so.” He smirked at Severus. “Maybe someday you will get your wish, love.”
Hermione was speechless which was a rare occurrence for her. She watched Severus carefully. "I forgive you, Severus. After Harry saw your memories, everything made sense. Though I do not condone your behaviour towards me, I do understand it a bit more. As for being a monster in society, um, Harry actually declared you a hero in public and told the Wizengamot you were pivotal to the defeat of Voldemort. To say the least, everyone was shocked but Harry never waivered even when people questioned him about it. He always stuck up for you. To our world, you are a true hero because Harry told your story and eventually people started to believe him. Now no one questions it thankfully. What I am trying to say is that you do not have to hide from the world. You are not a prisoner, you are a hero to all of us." She squeezed his hand and smiled at him.
Draco looked up at her with tears in his eyes. “Never in my wildest dreams, I thought my life would have such a brilliant life and boyfriend or become an honorary member of the Weasley family by way of Harry.” He chuckled softly at the last bit of his statement. Harry pulled him closer to him and wiped away his tears.
Hermione suddenly pulled Severus into a passionate kiss. They kissed for what felt like hours but it was only minutes. Hermione slowly pulled away. “I would love to live with you and no I do not think it is too fast. I mean, at least, not for us.” She smiled at him. “Plus, my books will be happy to be on shelves rather than on the floor. One can not disregard their feelings.” She laughed.
Draco laid his head once again on Harry’s chest. “Let us rest some more. We deserve it.” He smirked into his chest pillow. Harry nodded in agreement and kissed the top of Draco’s head. They fell asleep together wrapped in each other’s arms with soft smiles upon their faces.
Hermione gave him a watery smile. "Ohh Harry! I do not know what you would do without me as well. And I am just as lucky to have you in my life." She chuckled.
Severus cleared his throat. “Potter and I were discussing who could bridge the gap between blood status and house sorting. He seems to think he could. Though, he may be right but he will not able to do it alone like he seems to think. It will be a team effort, much like defeating Voldemort if I remember correctly.”
Hermione was still kind of staring at Severus. And he looked at her curiously which caused her to blush ferociously once again. She looked away from him and tried to concentrate on Harry and Draco. If anyone had noticed the exchange, no one said anything about it.
Draco was staring at Harry. "I was just teasing you about your potential house placement. I did not realise how intense your connection to Voldemort was. Sounds quite beastly, if I am being honest. It is unfortunate you had to endure that. Living with Voldemort was unpleasant enough. I can not imagine seeing inside of his ghastly mind in my dreams. At least you were able to keep the snake language after defeating Voldemort. That is amusing visualising you terrifying your cousin and anyone else who realised what you were talking to. Have you thought about getting a snake as a pet? Then your Parseltongue would never get rusty. It is just a thought."
Narcissa looked at Potter. "Harry, I was wondering how the restoration of Hogwarts was going. Will it be ready for the coming school year?"
Again, Hermione smacked him but this time in the head. "Ron, you do not have to agree but just trust Harry's judgement. I know it is hard. I mean Draco was just as awful to me as he was to you and Ginny. But I am choosing to give Harry a chance to figure out if Draco is being genuine. Do not jump down his throat! And definitely do not make Harry feel guilty for wanting a friendship with a Malfoy family member. You forget that Narcissa saved us all even if it was for selfish reasons. She still saved us. And Draco never outed us at Malfoy Manor when we were captured. He risked his safety by lying for us. In my mind, both instances were pretty bloody important in the war. I do not know what would have happened if neither happened. We could all be dead or enslaved by Voldemort."
Hermione was determined to let Severus was needed. "Draco needs more than us and Narcissa. Especially after visiting his father at Azkaban. I can not imagine that will be a pleasant encounter. Thankfully Harry is going with him. Can you imagine how Lucius is going to react to Draco being gay? And in a relationship with his leader's enemy? It will be a devastating blow to Draco. He will need your reassurance. He has such great respect for you, Sev. He knows you will always support him in whatever decisions he makes. And after witnessing his father's reaction to what he will be revealing, I think he is going to need his godfather by his side. Dumbledore always had an inkling that Draco and Harry had deep feelings for one another because of how he reacted when we entered Minnie's office. He seemed very proud of them getting over the rivalry. And he also knew that Draco would have to tell his father the truth about his relationship with Harry before someone else divulged the information. Even if Draco does not have much love left for Lucius, he still thinks that he deserves the truth and not from another source. I agree with him but I really wish they did not have to go to Azkaban. That place is just absolutely soul sucking even without the dementors. I hope they will be careful. I always worry about Harry." She bit her lip nervously.
Harry hugged him. “Thank you! I’m glad we’re not at odd anymore. I’ve missed you. And as for Hermione, she’s on board with my idea. She just wasn’t sure you’d come.”
Draco jumped a bit not realising Snape was listening. "Mother is doing well especially without Father around. I have missed you, Severus." He smiled fondly at his godfather.
Harry smiled at him. "Dray, we will. I just wanted to finish what was started before we were rudely interrupted." He captured Draco's lips in an another intense kiss.
Severus stepped back a bit and nodded. “You truly are a cheeky one.” He teased back. “Unfortunately it appears that you are right. I do have to leave soon. We do not want Narcissa to send out a search party.”
Draco walked over and wrapped his arms around Harry and kissed his shoulder. "Dray is a sweet nickname and I like it. Harry, I would do anything for you too."
Potter chuckled and shook his head. "Draco, it's nothing bad. Please trust me when I say I don't want to hurt you. I just want to return something to you." He opened the box and pushed it in front of Draco.
Potter was about to say something when Winky returned with tea and sandwiches. "Here are your sandwiches and tea. I hope you enjoy what I've made Mr. Harry Potter." Winky bowed.
Harry sighed sadly. “Dray, we better get ready to go to the Burrow. But when we return, I suggest that we continue what we started.” He smirked at a stunned Draco.
Severus sighed. “Well, you and I have gotten rather close. I mean we are together like as in a couple.” Hermione smirked at him. “And so naturally deep feelings have emerged on both sides.”
Harry closed the gap by kissing Draco softly. After a few seconds, their kiss got more intense. Without breaking the kiss, he backed up until the back of his knees hit the loveseat. As he sat down, he pulled Draco down with him until he had Draco sitting on his lap. They continued to kiss for quite some time until air became an issue.
Remus softly chuckled to himself. “I guess odder than things have happened like a werewolf attending Hogwarts and becoming a professor there for a short time.” He smirked. “I think Hermione is right. There has been enough conflict to last quite a few lifetimes. I have enough conflict once a month that I do not need it the rest of the time.” He frowned.
Draco was so nervous that he could not say anything but he nodded his head. Harry started to take his shirt off first slowly. Draco stared in awe as he stripped off his shirt. Once Harry was shirtless, he looked at his boyfriend. “It’s your turn, love.” He coaxed Draco to lean forward and he slowly lifted the shirt over his head. Harry admired Draco which caused him blush under Harry’s gaze.
In the short while Severus had been back amongst the living, he had slowly fallen in love with the know-it-all muggleborn witch who had once incessantly annoyed him while he taught Potions. Severus felt like he was always destined to end up with a Gryffindor ever since Lily. He was thankful that he had another chance at love and to him Hermione was everything and more. He admired her mind and the way she treated others. He knew that he had found his perfect match intellectually and emotionally. She brought out parts of him that he thought were long dead and challenged him in ways he never thought possible. And today he was planning to tell her that he had fallen in love with her and wanted to know if she felt the same.
Severus and Narcissa had just finished their lunch with Draco and Harry. They had just said their goodbyes. As they walked into the room with the ornate fireplace, Severus and Narcissa were startled by the presence of one Hermione Granger looking like she had seen a ghost.
Draco stepped forward and wrapped his arms around Harry. He looked straight into Harry’s eyes. “This time you are forgiven, future husband of mine. But remember next time wake me up when you leave, okay?” Harry nodded in agreement.
He trailed off when Harry kissed him gently. He leaned into the kiss and moaned very softly. He was pulled closer to Harry so he could deepen the kiss. They pulled away to catch their breath. Harry kissed Draco's nose and they both chuckled.
Everyone was smirking at Pansy, even Severus. Finally, Pansy recovered. “You are telling me that we could have had the Saviour of the Wizarding World in our snake pit? This is unbelievable! If he had been in our house, maybe we would not have been so hated. Argh! How could you, Draco? You just could not behave yourself. You just had to go and antagonise the one person who could have redeemed the reputation of our house!” She sneered at her best friend.
Narcissa rolled her eyes. “Only a Slytherin can think of a way to go over the top in gift giving. And for your information, it is Black. I divorced Lucius.” She smirked.
They made their way up the staircases to the Headmistress' office and Minnie reached the door and recited the password. "Sherbet lemons." A spiral staircase was revealed. Minnie started up the stairs. "Come, boys." Harry and Draco followed her up the spiral staircase. At the top, they saw the previous Headmasters portraits lining the walls.
Severus was astonished by his godson's reaction. "I believe this is the very first time you have shown any sort of true conviction about anything in your life, Draco. Colour me impressed." He softly smiled.
Hermione moved closer to Severus and leaned forward to wrap her arms around him. It startled him at first because he was not accustom to such kindness from someone he was not very familiar with. After a moment, he returned the gesture and wrapped his arms around Hermione's smaller frame. A few moments later, they pulled back from the hug. Hermione was blushing ferociously and she could not look Severus in the eye.
Harry chuckled. "I want a proper goodbye and I feel we will not be able to do that here. I do not want any unwanted guests interrupting us." He blushed a bit.
Harry blushed a bit. "Hermione, after getting back here we had tea and talked. Dray and I decided not wait to be together. He told me that Severus said that he shouldn't have to hide us from the world and what we mean to each other just to make others happy. I agreed with him and I asked him to be my boyfriend. And obviously he said yes. We decided to stay in the same bed because we both thought it would keep the nightmares away and thankfully it worked and we slept very peacefully." He reached for Draco's hand and squeezed it.
Hermione smiled. “That is quite true. I remember when she sent a howler to Ron after he stole the family’s flying car in second year. His reaction was beyond priceless. He looked pretty mortified but also completely terrified. That day I learned to never get on Molly’s bad side. She is not a force to be reckoned with.” She chuckled softly.
Pansy huffed out a sigh. “Bloody hell, fine! Have it your way, Saviour. I will try to do my best to leave the past in the past but I am not making any promises. And if you ever break my Draco’s heart, you will wish you never came back to life in the battle.” She looked smug because Harry looked a bit terrified.
Harry and Draco heard someone clearing their throat. Immediately, they stopped kissing and looked embarrassed. They turned to see who was there. Hermione and Kreacher were there staring at them intently.
Sirius Black and Remus Lupin both suddenly appeared. Both looked befuddled and stared at Draco and Harry with wide eyes.
Harry hugged her. “Bloody hell Hermione! I need to buy an engagement ring. Narcissa and I chatted and she thinks of me as another son. Then I talked to Draco and we talked about our future and becoming husbands.” He rambled.
As they happily fell asleep in each other’s arms, Draco and Harry were smiling softly musing over their romantic heart-to-heart.
Harry looked into Draco's eyes. "Good morning, Dray. How did you sleep? Any nightmares?" He pulled him closer until they were practically nose to nose.
Ron started to turn almost as red as his hair. “Is this some sort of sick joke? Because it’s not funny, Harry. It was bad enough you wanted to be friends with the ferret! Now, you’re fucking each other! You’ve lost your bloody mind! Is he using a love potion? This can’t be real! Harry, I thought you were my friend! How could you betray me like this?” Everyone in the room looked at Ron in horror.
An exhausted Narcissa walked into the room slowly. “I am the one who summoned you actually.” Everyone looked at her curiously. “There is a blood magic spell that the Malfoy family created long ago. Earlier today when Harry came by, I saw how sad he was. He missed you all so much. I took it upon myself to cast the spell. I have never used it before so I did not know if it would work or not but I had to try for Harry. He has done so much for my family and I wanted to give his back. Unfortunately, I passed out before I could explain. I am pleased to see no one has ripped my son apart. I appreciate that.” She smirked.
Narcissa approached her cautiously. "Hermione, dear, are you okay? What brings you to the manor?" She tried to reach for Hermione but was met with a swat.
Severus took her encouraging smile as a good sign. "As you know back in my Hogwarts days and even before then, I fell in love with Lily Evans. Unfortunately, it was a one sided love. I am still haunted by her death and how our friendship crumbled overnight it seemed. She is the reason why I protected Harry. My love for her called to me like a beacon in the night and I just knew had to do right by her. All I could think of was that he was the piece of her. When I went to the Potter house the night they died, I was shattered for the boy who now had no parents all because of his destiny and slimy Wormtail. Nothing felt right in the world any longer knowing Lily was gone. Losing her friendship made me go off the deep end and I joined the Death Eaters but knowing she was not part of the world any longer made me realise that I had to do everything in my power to help Dumbledore even if I was begging or it seemed like he was forcing me to do something. At the time I was so conflicted that he had to push me to do a task for him. I was quite a mess."
Severus nodded in agreement. "Draco your mother is right. I will send for Mister Potter." He produced his doe patronus. "Retrieve Potter from Grimmauld Place immediately. Tell him to apparate here." His doe scampered out of the manor.
Once Harry returned with the chocolate, they held on to each other as Harry apparated them to Azkaban’s gates. There was someone waiting for them as they stepped forward.
Winky finally ceased the jumping and said "Master Draco, it's quite late and you should be getting ready. You slept in. I'll make you your favourite breakfast."
Draco was shattering. “Harryyy, please don’t stop. Faster!” He panted as he held onto Harry to keep steady.
Harry stepped forward. "Headmistress, it's lovely to see you again. Thank you for letting us come today. We both appreciate it." He smiled at her.
Severus studied her carefully. “I am pleased to hear that. Honestly, I would love for you to be my wife one day. Nothing would make me happier. And I quite like the sound of Hermione Jean Snape.”
Pansy still looked like she was in a state of shock. “I, um, feel I need to apologise to you, Potter. I am genuinely sorry. I did not realise the extent of your relationship. I thought it was just a phase or some flight of fancy. Please accept my apology. All that truly matters is Draco’s happiness like Blaise stated.” She gave Harry a small smile and extended her hand. “Friends?”
Draco looked into Harry’s eyes and said “Love, I am ready. Please make love to me. I need to feel you.” His eyes had a pleading look. Harry looked a bit shocked but nodded vigorously. “I love you, Harry.” They kissed softly.
Narcissa smirked. "Darling, I hate to break it to you but you are being foolish and daft right now. You might as well just go to his place."
Severus' eyes widened. "Narcissa, I have not a clue as to what you are prattling on about. Please do not meddle in my affairs." He gave her a stern look.
Hermione looked like she was going to cry and gave him watery smile. "Ohhh Harry! I am so proud of you! I completely support you in this. No matter what others think. What you said about bridging the gap between the houses was bloody brilliant! And forming friendships with all houses would be amazing."
Harry stood up. “I’ll be right back.” He kissed Draco and left the room. He went upstairs to hide the wedding bands but kept the engagement rings in his pocket.
Harry smiled. “Okay. Let me know if I hurt you or want me to stop.” Draco nodded once again. “Oh and just so you know this may hurt a bit. I need to prep you first.” Draco looked at Harry eagerly. “Roll onto your stomach and get on your hands and knees while I prep you.” Draco obeyed. Once he was on his hands and knees, Harry slathered his middle finger with lube. Draco watched him intently.
Hermione smiled at him. "Oh Harry! No matter what you can count on us. I am pleased that we got to share this with you as well." Ron nodded in agreement.
Severus caressed her cheek and kissed her gently. “Hermione, I do love when I leave you speechless or stumbling over your words.”
Harry finally spoke. "I think we should go to sleep. Turn around and you can be the little spoon." Draco gave him a nod and turned around. Harry wrapped his arm around him and pulled him closer. "Good night, Dray." He kissed his shoulder affectionately.
Hermione sighed. “It is not stupid at all. I completely understand why you want him here. I will owl him.”
Harry blushed a bit while Ron and Hermione stayed by his side. “Uhh, I’m looking to buy an engagement ring.”
Harry’s eyes went wide. “I didn’t know you were going to visit Lucius. If I had I would’ve come with you so you wouldn’t have to deal with the dementors alone.”
Harry looked at Draco with so much love. “I don’t want to pressure you but I’ve been wanting to feel your skin on mine. Would you be okay if we remove our shirts? I just really want to be closer to you, Dray.” He gave his boyfriend a pleading look.
“NO!! God no. I’m sorry, I just can’t keep having this conversation naked. I’m not that a good person that I won’t jump you and cage you if I get the chance.” Draco explained, throwing his clothes at Harry so he could dress as well.
“OF COURSE I DON’T WANT TO BE LEFT HERE!”  Malfoy screamed, standing up swiftly, finally looking at those green eyes he hated so much.
And so, they went for a walk around the castle, Then on the school grounds. Finally noticing the knowing looks in everyone’s eyes. Noticing the total absence of surprise at their holding hands. Basically, everybody knew they were together. They had just been way too caught in their own heads to see it.
Harry was hard in his pants, not having a clue when or more importantly why it had happened. The green-eyed boy instincts proved once more way more intelligent than he was, after catching up on the other’s boy arousal and reacted appropriately. Their pricks apparently understood each other a lot better than their brains did.
But the prick was is no shape to confront the Daily Prophet right now. He needed his brain rewired and his old self brought back. A new and nicer version of him would not do the trick. He had to come in front of the whole world and be a gigantic arsehole, and Harry needed to be standing by his side, accepting it. That was a way stronger message. ‘We accept each other. Exactly as we are. No matter what. No more carnage, no more death, no more division.’
“I…” Harry sighed. They were both lying on the huge four poster bed the room of requirement had given them, looking up at the ceiling.
The Slytherin still had not replied to the threat. He could think of a million snarky things to say but all of them seemed to have the potential to make things escalate to a level neither of them wanted to go to.
Harry couldn’t believe all the thing that would get out of Malfoy’s mouth. It was like the war never happened. Like the almost killing each other never happened. The battle, the fire, the trials, nothing. Suddenly they were 12 again.
“I could have gone into the forest sooner. So many people would be alive right now if I had.” Draco went to protest but Harry put a gentle finger on his mouth and continued: “I know what you’re about to say. That it’s not my fault. That thinking like that is illogical, nay stupid. That a lot of people, including you, have done way worse things during the war and I can’t seem to hold a grudge against any of them. And I tend to agree. But when I close my eyes at night, I see them Malfoy. All of them. Fred, Lupin, Tonks, even Snape sometimes. I dream I’m killing them with my bare hands. Or I dream they are all alive and well and I’m dead and the world is such a better place. I wake up less and less happy every morning and pretty much the only times I feel okay is when I’m with you. When you’re especially rough with me, I feel the guilt go away and it feels sooooo good.”
They were suddenly interrupted by Potter loudly coming back into the DADA classroom. “Are you coming Hermione? We’re starving, Ron and I”, he explained, looking back and forth between his friend and Draco.
"Yes, but I should not have, I actually was about to head out to bed", the Slytherin muttered. But he didn't get up. Something told him this conversation was important.
“Are you asking me out, Malfoy? I mean you just said you wanna stop fucking but NOT end this.” Harry said in a sultry voice, walking dangerously close to Malfoy.
So Harry did the only think he knew out to do: he acted. Turned around swiftly, grabbed Malfoy by the collar once again, and kissed him passionately.
“Honestly, I don’t know. Never knew anyone who was. Never felt like a possibility for me. Like being gay it was something that happened to people in books or to muggles or whatever. Not to me. And I did hit on you and I liked that you liked it. It made me feel more alive that I have felt in months. And I do think you’re fit. I always have”, he tried to explain.
His first response would have been to say something mean and obnoxious (old habits die hard), so he just glared at Ron with sheer horror. When the Gryffindor boy grumbled a very loud "What??", Draco took a quick glance at Granger and was relieved to see the same disgust in her eyes. But since she is a nice person, she just calmly said: "You know Ronald, I’m pretty sure that meal was made to be shared with, you know, everyone here." Ron shrugged and took an even bigger bite. Granger was shaking her head, but her eyes held nothing but tenderness for her boyfriend.
He then finally channeled enough courage to take a couple steps back towards the dorm rooms. Still facing him, he breathed: “I can’t Harry. Us kissing is a terrible idea. I hope you understand.”
“You really think if I was, I would tell you? Let me remind you I’m an excellent secret keeper, smarter and more cunning than both of you combined. Simply telling you my intentions are pure should not be enough.” Draco argued with more spite than he initially intended.
The green-eyed boy knew he should say yes. But the milking always left him feeling empty, tired, and frustrated. And he was already feeling all three of these things to a full extent. He needed a nap. He needed out of that room.
Draco was not okay. Ever since that night in the tower, Potter had been in every single one of his thoughts. Draco was just realising now that his obsessing on the word NO was over. All it took was a five minutes conversation with the savior and everything had changed. It was clear to the blond now; he had just replaced an obsession with another. His guilt and anger and mostly shame was still very much in place in his head. The only difference was the coping mechanism he used to go through everyday life. Harry couldn’t become his crutch. All that boy wanted was to suck a few cocks because an evil maniac prevented him to do so for years.
, wouldn’t work against a stunning spell and the point was to prove to Malfoy that he was casting it wrong. He had to cast something mild, only quickly enough.
“You git! You cast Protego !! ('Non verbally at that, impressing', he thought) It’s like admitting I was right in the first place!” Harry managed to utter with difficulty, quickly loosing his breath because of the rapid dancing.
“I honestly thought this was just… you know… the next step.” Harry offered, sounding unsure of himself but still it was more or less the truth.
“Find a third option, obviously.” Harry answered like it was the easiest question he was ever asked. He moved closer to the blond on the couch and muttered seductively: “Why do you ask?”
Malfoy finally opened his eyes. He looked malicious and cunning and ready for battle. He was mesmerizing. He took Harry's breath away.
“You don’t have to do that, wait!”, Harry panicked, sitting up and moving up the bed, as to escape him.
It made him think back. It was now November. He had been back in Hogwarts for more than 2 months now and not a single one of the teenagers in this room had tried to have a go at him. Not an insult, not a jinx, nothing. And now that he was really looking at all of them for the first time, he could easily understand why.
Harry again pulled Draco closer to him. "Yes that was a bit embarrassing. I'm sorry we were interrupted."
Draco took the letter from her and sat down next to Harry. He analysed every part of the letter before he started to open it.
Harry blushed lightly. “Believe it or not, I do. I’m going to have Kreacher make Draco’s favourite meal and dessert tonight. I’ll propose after dessert. Does that sound okay?”
"Really?! You want me to stay longer? I really didn't want to overstay my welcome. I'm pleasant to have around?" Harry said astounded. He kept on staring at staring at Draco wondering what he was thinking about.
Narcissa stepped forward. "I saw how you were looking at him. Does he feel the same? I just want to protect you my darling boy." She kissed the top of his head.
Harry nodded as he stuttered. "Yes-s, Professor, I have." He looked a bit pale, worrying about how Snape was going to react to his changing relationship with Draco.
Draco was rudely awoken by an overexcited house elf jumping on his bed. He growled "What is your bloody issue, Winky?!"
Harry squeezed Draco's hand gently. "My friends trust my judgment. They know I spoke on your behalf during the trials for a reason. And that surprises me to hear about Blaise but he was never nasty to me. And the only people I've lost track of time with were just the Weasleys. Well until today with you. I really enjoyed this afternoon with you and your Mother. I'm glad I sent you an owl last night. It's one of my best decision and as you know there aren't a lot of those. I agree we should get together again soon." He smiled at Draco.
Narcissa smiled softly at her son. "Perhaps you should go to Grimmauld Place and tell him in person? Maybe that would ease some of the stress."
Harry could not take the tension any longer as he surged forward and kissed Draco passionately. Within seconds Draco responded with just as much passion. Both needed each other more than air itself. They explored each other’s bodies and moaned in pleasure. After stripping each other, Harry pushed Draco down and straddled him. He started to rut against Draco until they were moaning each other’s names.
Draco eyed him suspiciously. "Hello Potter. All things considered I have been doing pretty well. Thank you for your concern. How about yourself?"
When Harry and Draco approached the table where Lucius was, again Draco held onto Harry quite tightly and whispered. “Dray, no need to worry. No matter what happens you will always have me.” They separated and sat beside each other as Lucius watched their interactions with one another curiously.
Hermione looked surprised. "You make a good point, Sev. Draco is a much more gifted wizard than Ron will ever be. After the war, I felt I needed time to heal from what had happened. I also needed to find my parents and restore their memories of me. As for Ron, he needed to be there for his family after losing Fred. I did not want to get in the way of his family time. And honestly, I fell out of love with him. I just did not feel the same anymore and I started to notice some alarming behaviour. He started to get jealous of how close I was with Harry which started while we were on the run and searching for horcruxes. He abandoned us for a time. We forgave him but neither of us could ever forget what he did and said to us before he left. Eventually that jealousy started to warp into possessiveness. He would always have be right there with me especially if Viktor Krum was mentioned or was in my presence and he never gave me any space to be me. An example of jealousy, Viktor asked to dance at Fleur and Bill's wedding and I said yes. You could tell Ron was secretly seething the whole time. I felt more like property to him than his girlfriend. It all made me feel incredibly uncomfortable and I found a perfect out in the aftermath of the war. He never questioned my reasons and we still remain close friends. It all worked out just fine which is a relief." She sighed.
Draco laid his head on Harry’s chest. He listened to Harry’s heartbeat. Slowly, he fell asleep wrapped in his lover’s arms.
Draco blushed and huffed out a sigh. "Fine I suppose you are right as always, Mother. But what about the press? I do not want to be the reason why Harry gets assaulted by them. Can you imagine the article titles? I am sure they would use "Death Eater Corrupts the Wizarding World's Saviour" as a title or something very similar to it."
Narcissa sipped her tea. “It concerns Draco actually and that is why I summoned you for tea. Lucius told me of your visit with him and his views have not changed one bit. I do not want my Draco to be subjected to that man’s toxic filth any longer. I forbid Draco to see him ever again. I know my son will not be pleased but I think it is for the best. I have actually petitioned for divorce and my request was approved considering who my husband, or rather my former husband, is. I have also gone back to my maiden name, Black. As it happens all of Lucius’ money will go to Draco regardless of what he said about cutting his son off. He no longer has that authority since he is in Azkaban. Draco has the option of relieving himself of the last name Malfoy or keeping it. It is entirely up to him. I thought he could give some or all the money from his father to charities benefiting muggleborns. That would really grind Lucius’ gears.”
Severus was flustered and was not thinking clearly. “May I kiss you, Hermione?” He blurted out. After realising what he asked, he looked away.
Severus and Hermione gracefully stepped out of the floo and looked around. Hermione observed the scene. “Harry, what is going on? Is everything alright?”
Once they were steady on their feet, Harry let go of Draco's hand and turned to him. "Are you okay, Dray? Would you like to have some tea before trying to sleep again?"
Draco stared up at Harry and grabbed him and kissed him so ferociously. They continued to kiss until they were panting for air.
Ron stopped when he got close enough and cleared his throat nervously. “I, uh, wanted to apologise to you all for my behaviour. I shouldn’t’ve judged you for who fell in love with. Harry, after everything you’ve been through you deserve brilliant things. Draco, I let my prejudices against your family cloud my better judgment. Hermione, I always thought we would be together for life and seeing you with Snape was a shock but I still never should’ve said those horrid things to you. Snape, after all you have done for our world I should’ve been more respectful. I’m so sorry for everything I said and done. I hope you all can forgive me someday.” He looked at them sheepishly.
Narcissa looked like she was going to cry at any moment but quickly recovered. “You are family to us as well. Anyway, best be going before we both start weeping uncontrollably.” She gave a watery chuckle. “As always it was a pleasure to see you again, Harry. Please tell Draco I miss him. And keep me informed about his decision to change or keep his last name.”
Hermione stopped and turned. “Sev! You came. I was not sure since I did not hear from you.” She walked up to him and kissed his cheek. She blushed a bit.
Harry looked at both Narcissa and Severus. “I am truly sorry we didn’t tell you about our visit to Azkaban. We weren’t thinking. Narcissa, I’ll let you know what happened. I’m not sure when but I will. And we’ll come over to visit soon, too.” He smiled at them.
Draco started to pull Harry’s shirt off and then he took his own off. He explored Harry’s chest and teased his nipples which earned him a loud moan. Draco reveled in all the sounds Harry was making because of him.
Harry, Draco and Hermione were watching the exchange between Dumbledore, Snape and Minnie in amusement. All three were highly entertained. Harry watched Snape with curiosity, Hermione watched Snape in awe and Draco watched Snape with pride.
"Believe it or not he does feel the same but we are going to just be friends for now. At least until our friends accept our friendship. We are taking it slow. We both think that is best." Draco said thoughtfully.
That's when Severus decided to get closer to Hermione. "Miss Granger? May I help you to another room?" There was no response as he continued to get closer to her. "Miss Granger? I mean, Hermione? May I help you?" He smiled softly.
Draco finally spoke. "The Latin incantation "semper fidelis. Te mihi revelare" roughly translates to "always loyal or faithful. Reveal yourself to me" in English. Dumbledore said to say those words carefully which makes me think you only get one try." He looked a little worried.
Draco smirked. "Actually there is something we would like to share with you both before lunch. Severus, I discussed what advice you had for me yesterday to Harry last night. And we both agreed with what you had said. So, Harry asked me to be his boyfriend and we are officially together now. I just thought you two should know. Also, Hermione knows because she barged into Harry's bedroom and interrupted us. She had breakfast with us and was supremely supportive." He smiled so widely.
All throughout lunch, Draco and Harry were holding hands. Both were unbelievably happy they were officially together. They kept sneaking smiles at one another. Neither thought Narcissa and Severus were noticing this but they did. Nothing brought more happiness to them than seeing how delighted both Harry and Draco were after they finally made everything official.
Narcissa finally decided to put a stop to the pacing. "Draco, darling, you really need to stop. I am sure whatever is on your mind you will figure it out."
Draco nodded and leaned into the hug. “I do not think I will ever be ready for this particular conversation but it needs to happen. I do not want my father to find out from some prison guard, who is just out for revenge, that his only son is gay. I just can not happen like that. No matter what kind of person he is, he deserves the truth from the source and not from some random person.”
Ron was scowling. "You two are unbelievable! This can't be happening! I can't support this bloody alliance between the ferret and Harry! I just can't! I'm sorry, Harry." He stood up and left the table. Both Harry and Hermione flinched when they heard him slam the door.
Harry was about to reply when Narcissa walked in. “Ah welcome Harry! I do hope Severus has been hospitable.” She smirked at Severus. “What were you two discussing before I rudely interrupted?”
Harry was comforting Draco. “Love, please try to calm down and breathe. I know what your father said was god awful but he isn’t worth your tears.” Draco’s sobs finally began to slow.
Harry smiled at Draco. “I’m doing okay. I’m happy they’re back but it’s a bit overwhelming. I never thought this was possible and then Narcissa went and did the impossible. I can’t thank her enough. I just hope everyone can figure out a way to get along. I would like to have peace like Hermione said.”
Once both boys were seated again, they tried to avoid eye contact with one another. Though quite unsuccessfully. Both finished their tea and sandwiches in silence.
Hermione finally came to the door and ushered Severus in. “Hello, Sev. It is so good to see you again.” She stepped forward and gave him a soft kiss. “Come in and we can have some tea. Sit.” She smiled at him and they both sat at the table.
Narcissa noticed them come into the room and stood up to greet them. “Hello darlings. What a pleasant surprise! What is the special occasion? Did I forget that you were coming by?” She smiled sweetly.
Draco looked beyond frightened but recovered quickly. “You say what in the bloody hell is going on but I say what in the bloody hell are you doing here? You both died! And Black how dare you say those things to me! I love Harry with everything I have so bugger off!” He fumed.
Once Harry and Draco were outside of the gates of Azkaban and the guard had apologised to Draco for being rude earlier, Draco launched himself at Harry and started to cry.
Severus smirked at her reaction to how she hugged him. "Hermione, there is no need to apologise for hugging me. It was quite unexpected but certainly not unwelcome. It is not every day that you are graced with a hug by the brightest witch of her age." He teased.
Harry had tears welling up in his eyes and he brushed them away. “I don’t know what to say. I could never regret helping you and Draco out. Even if there was a way to pay me back, I wouldn’t accept it. Just having Dray with me is enough for the rest of my life. I’ve grown to love you both, obviously in different ways. You’re family.”
Hermione smiled and chuckled. “Thank you. I never thought I would feel at home with a bunch of unruly snakes.” She leaned in closer to Severus.
Harry got a bit teary eyed. “I never thought I’d ever be lucky enough to find someone as brilliant and unique as Draco. I also never thought I’d fall for him but it happened and I couldn’t be more happy. I do plan to marry him some day. I was hoping he’d take my last name. Imagine Harry James Malfoy? The Prophet would have an absolute field day with that. I can imagine all the hate mail I’d get for changing my name to a former Death Eater’s. I suppose if he took the last name Black, I could change mine to that but I do like the sound of Draco Lucius Potter. You really think of me as a son already? Never in my wildest dreams, I thought I’d have one motherly figure in my life but having two is unfathomable and incredible. And it means a lot that I have your support wholeheartedly.”
Narcissa watched him carefully. "Well, Severus, it appears to me that another Slytherin and Gryffindor pair have reconciled their differences. How lovely." She was smiling like the Cheshire Cat.
Lucius was speechless for a moment. “Impossible! I do not believe what you are saying! You both are just deceitful poofters! Everything you buggers say are wretched lies! Sod off!” He screamed. Draco flinched and looked like he was about to cry again.
After returning to Grimmauld Place from having lunch with Narcissa and Severus, Harry contacted Kingsley by owl to ask if they could visit Lucius Malfoy who now permanently resided in Azkaban. A moment after sending the letter, the reply arrived almost immediately saying they were welcome to apparate outside of the Azkaban’s gates any time they were ready. Kingsley warned that the dementors were still present at the prison but he had restricted their behaviour. He also informed them to bring lots of chocolate to counteract the effects of the dementors.
Draco looked at Harry. "What are we? I know it needs to be kind of secret but we keep having these encounters even though we are supposed to be just friends and I would like to know what I am to you, Harry." He blushed a bit.
Still sitting in silence, both observed one another. "So Harry, what would you like to talk about? Interests? Relationships?" Draco inquired.
When Harry was done getting dressed, he headed down to the kitchen. Hermione and Draco were waiting for him. They all sat at the table started to eat breakfast.
Sirius just stared where Kreacher had been. “Bloody hell! He is still alive and kicking. And he is nice? What did you do to him, Harry?”
Hermione reached out and squeezed Draco's shoulder. "It is going to be okay. I promise we will not let anything to you. You are safe with us." She smiled softly at him.
"I am also pleased to know my mother has no problem with me being gay. I am just happy I am no longer under my father's thrall. I enjoy being free of him actually. And have you not heard of the boy pulling a girl's pigtails because he likes her? Plus I did not want to like you that way and it is embarrassing to admit you like your supposed enemy. I could never tell anyone. It is almost a relief to tell someone even if it is the object of my affection." Draco looked down at the ground embarrassed.
Draco clutched the cookie Ginny hand given them as a consolation prize and gave Claire another, more careful look. "Claire, what's going on? Why is Harry saying that he's married to Ginny, and where are the kids?"
That night, the boys got ready for bed in an exceptionally awkward silence. Draco took his clothes to the bathroom to change. He knew it was odd. Or juvenile. Or something. But the scars—he didn’t want people staring at the scars on his chest. Especially Potter.
Angry now, Draco splashed water on his face and prepared to return to the dorm. Those imaginary games had felt low-stakes before, but now, with both of them living in the same room, Potter might actually see, might actually have something to say.
As Draco showered and dressed for the nightmarish day ahead, he never stopped thinking about Potter. He kept trying to distract himself to no avail. He was thinking about how lost he could get in Potter's eyes. They were so beautiful.
Narcissa looked at him curiously. “Speaking of my darling son how is he fairing living with you? I hope he is content.”
The salesperson nodded. “Yes. I’ll be right back with the wedding bands.” When she returned, she handed them over. “The wedding bands bond with engagement rings when they are both on your finger.”
When Severus gracefully landed back at the Manor, he was greeted by Narcissa who sported a knowing smile.
Draco, of course, blushed. "Honestly, I was not sure about a visit because of the press and I am still not sure if I did the right thing coming here."
Harry watched both his friends bickering. He was glad they figured out they were not compatible before they got serious. He could not imagine them married.
Draco smiled back. "Funny you should mention sending an owl. I had planned to do that but everything I wrote sounded wrong. Mother was getting annoyed with my pacing so she suggested that I should just show up in person rather than stress over a letter. And yes I would love some tea, thank you."
Severus smiled. “Of course I came. It would be rude of me not to. I presume Potter and Draco are out. Otherwise, I would not be here.” Hermione nodded.
Hermione laughed softly. “Oh I almost forgot to mention that I did owl Molly about how Ron behaved. I am waiting for her response.”
Blaise looked pleased. “Finally! Thank Merlin that you found sense, Parkinson! I was ready to pummel you for being incredibly saucy to our host.” He smiled affectionately at her.
Remus stared in surprise and slowly stepped closer to Sirius. “Please everyone calm down! Siri, let us listen to Harry and the Malfoy heir.”
Narcissa and Harry finished their tea in relative silence for the most part. The Malfoy house elf retrieved the tea tray and left with it. As Narcissa stood and started to walk into the foyer of the Manor, Harry followed.
Hermione smacked Ron's arm and gave him a nasty look. "Ron! Do not be so rude! Like you would know if this will work out! You have an emotional range of a bloody teaspoon! We should both be supportive. The war is over and it is time to put everything in the past. If we do not another war will happen in the future which none of us want. If Draco and Harry can move past everything that happened, we owe it to them to give them a chance."
Narcissa chuckled at what Severus said. “I do believe that Severus is right but I also know that no one will listen unless you are a part of the change, Harry. You and Hermione will do wonders for our world. I truly believe that.” She smiled at Harry. “Oh Severus speaking of Hermione I believe you are going to be late for your little date with your witch if you do not leave now.” At that Severus blushed a bit and quickly left in a huff.
Harry looked at his parents, Sirius and Remus. “I would never bet against Hermione ever. That would be suicide.” He chuckled. “I wanted to give you all an explanation of how everything came together.” He sighed heavily. “It wasn’t until I was eleven years old that I knew I was a wizard. I was a freak in the Dursley’s eyes and they hated me. I met Ron and Hermione on the Hogwarts Express. We were all sorted into Gryffindor, though the Sorting Hat had difficulty placing me into a house because of having some Slytherin traits I suppose. I finally had a home in Hogwarts and it was awful to leave every year.” He took a moment. “As for Draco, all throughout Hogwarts he was an arse to me and my friends, in large part due to Lucius’ influence. The war happened and we lost a lot of good people. Death Eater trials commenced. Due to saving our arses, I spoke in defence of Draco and Narcissa at their trials. I even spoke at Lucius’ but only to ensure he would end up in Azkaban for the rest of his life. I went to Malfoy Manor to return Draco’s wand that I stole. We figured out that we had feelings for each other but we didn’t want to upset our loved ones so at first we agreed to be friends. That didn’t last long. Our relationship progressed into something more serious. The Weasleys were supportive, aside from Ron at first, and Narcissa was always super supportive. She thought of me as her son-in-law long before the proposal. I couldn’t believe how lucky I had gotten with Molly and Narcissa who treated me like family. It made not having my mum around hurt a little less.” He looked at Lily. “Draco is everything to me and I can’t wait to call him my husband. First year me would be appalled at who I ended up with.” He chuckled. “And now my family is truly complete because of Narcissa. I can have you all to our wedding and that means the world to me.” He had tears in his eyes. “It’s a dream come true.” He gave everyone a watery smile.
Ron was the first to speak. "Mate, so how did go with the little white ferret? I see you are still among the living."
Draco nodded and hopped into the bed and adjusted to get comfortable. "Harry, you can come into the bed now." He gave a reassuring smile.
They all start walking up to the castle and chatted along the way. Minnie was pleased to see her former students getting along.
Narcissa smiled at them. "Ohh Severus calm yourself! I am sure there is a reasonable explanation as to why they shared a bed. Let them explain, please."
Slowly, they both pulled back from the hug and stared at each other for a moment before moving forward. As their lips touched, both wrapped their arms around each other to deepen the kiss. This kiss was much longer than the first and had a bit more passion to it. Both moaned softly into the kiss. Neither wanted to end it, so they carried on until they both needed to breath. As they parted, Harry and Draco had wide happy smiles plastered on their faces.
When Potter called him by his first name, Draco felt his face heat up a bit. He tried and failed to keep his mother and Potter seeing his reaction. "Malfoy, did I say something wrong?"
Narcissa smiled. “Well someone other than Hermione has to put him in his place sometimes. Otherwise his ego would be too inflated to deal with.” She smirked. “Let us have tea. I believe it is ready now.” Narcissa walked out of the room and Harry followed.
Harry blushed. "Yes, is that okay? Like I said anything for you, Draco. I'll put the kettle on." He walked over to the stove to prepare the tea.
Draco kissed Harry's cheek. "I like that plan. I really love laying next to you and cuddling. It is so peaceful." Eventually, they fall asleep on the love seat due to each other's warmth.
Narcissa watched both boys bantering back and forth. "I am sure Harry thought of that little fact, Draco darling."
Both finished their tea and Hermione put everything on the counter. “Sev, let us go to the sitting room.” She held out her hand for him to take and without hesitation he did as she led them out of the kitchen.
Draco stuttered to think of something to say. "I do not want to seem too eager because I will look like a daft fool. And you know I can not deal with that."
After Harry spelled the love seat to grow in length and width, he settled down and gestured Draco to join him. Draco laid down and rested his head on his shoulder.
Harry and Draco take ahold of each other's hands, they said their goodbyes to Narcissa and Severus. They apparated out of the manor and immediately landed in Grimmauld Place's kitchen.
Lucius ate some more chocolate. “That traitor is dead! You can not get approval from a bloody portrait, you plonker!” He yelled.
Draco looked away embarrassed at what he asked Harry. "I am sorry. I did not mean to pry. You do not have to tell me anything too personal if you would prefer."
Draco had a single tear leave a trail down his cheek and Harry wiped it away. "Yes, Harry I would love to be your boyfriend. Every moment with you is a dream come true. I could not think of a better person to share my time with."
Both were greeted by Hermione hugging them. “Merlin Harry! I thought you were not coming back. It has been nearly twenty minutes.”
Severus slowly moved off the love seat and offered his hand to Hermione. She took his hand and he helped her up off the love seat. Once they were standing in front of each other, Severus stepped forward and wrapped his arm around her waist pulling her closer to him. Just mere inches apart, he gently placed his hand on her cheek. Hermione slowly moved her face closer to his and he closed the distance between them by kissing her softly. The kiss was chaste but still intense and it only lasted seconds. As they pulled apart, both were breathless and stared into each other’s eyes. Neither said a word. Hermione licked her lips and Severus watched her intently. Without any warning, she pulled him into another kiss but this one was full of want and desire. Hermione caressed Severus’ bottom lip with her tongue which elicited a moan from him and she deepened the kiss by slipping her tongue into his mouth. As a result of her actions, he tightened his grip on her until there was no longer any space between them. They kissed for what seemed like an eternity. Finally they parted out of necessity to breathe. Neither spoke as they stared at each other a bit dazed by what just happened.
Narcissa hugged Harry once more. “Harry, I know it is a difficult time for you but you have many people who care for you and want the best for you. Myself included. I know Arthur, Molly and I can not replace your parents. And Severus certainly never replace Sirus or Remus.” She chuckled lightly. “We are always here for you no matter what.” For a moment Narcissa was lost in thought. Suddenly she released Harry. “Excuse me for a bit. I need to attend to something.” She quickly left the room.
The blond boy instantly understood his lover’s predicament when he noticed his Cock completely dry, not even a drop of lube on it. The spell must have worn out at some point. Blaise had mentioned this could happen if you cast it in a hurry, which had been the case today.
“Those choices were about me? Sorry but I don’t follow”, Harry grilled him, still way too loudly to Draco’s liking.
“Honestly, I like the nerd, I need the Dom.” Harry admitted, slowly lifting Draco’s head, looking at him with eyes full of hope.
“Plus, we hate each other. It’s going to look so suspicious if you defend me out of the blue like that."
Turning his head swiftly, Draco noticed Granger hadn’t left the classroom and had waited for everyone to head out to speak to him.
"I do know." Harry said, quickly touching Draco's arm with a giant grin before going back to his umpire spot.
Potter was crying. Although it wasn’t that easy to properly tell the difference, something in his eyes made Draco believe that Harry wasn’t crying only because of the physical pain. There was so much in his eyes. So much more than a stupid sex spell accident. But he had to make sure.
Harry took the arm off his lover’s eyes and started stroking his mark again. “Like you weren’t using me?”, he pointed out.
“You saved my life Malfoy. Then your mother saved my life. Throughout all that a mad man lived in your house for months and convinced you that if you weren’t at his beck and call you would get tortured or killed or your parents would or whatever other mad things he’s threatened you with… You’re not a bad person Malfoy… you’re… a
Harry had fought and killed and lost so much. The kiss had been more awkward than pleasant and despite all that, had been the most intense moment of his young life.
‘Find a third option’ Potter had said. Move to France? Jump off the window? Scream ‘PLEASE MARRY ME’? Nothing but crazy ideas came to mind.
“When you and your over sized ego are done insulting me, maybe we can get back to practicing… oh and acknowledging I’m right as well.. Because, well, I am.”
After a while, Harry let go of his collar, and sat back on the couch. Close. So close their thighs were touching. Harry turned his head to look outside once more. Still no movement. It felt like the whole outside world was a painting on those windows. As cliché as it may sounds, it felt like they were the only two people in the world.
Doing things was easy. Answering questions that usually came after… was not. So he nodded gently at Malfoy, and entered his bedroom without speaking a word.
“Leave that to me Potter. I have a plan. Then we can go and convince the wizarding world that the nice Gryffindors and bad Slytherins can be friends. It will work. But you better not be messing with me and flirt with me just to make
Draco got the message so instead of replying something even more obnoxious, took a deep breath and hunched himself on the table, not unlike how you act when you need to explain something trivial to a 6 year old kid:
Malfoy was sitting on the couch closest to the fireplace, poised as ever, is in emerald green silk pajamas. The moon light made his hair a shiny silver in a very cold manner. His face and hands were however warmed by the fire light. His whole body was glowing.  The stillness of the trees outside and the otherwise empty room made his presence ever more impossible to ignore. Harry was mesmerized.
“Well congratulations, you’re an arsehole prick and a control freak, but not a sadist, that makes you only two thirds of the perfect little dark lord heir.”
are the expert on what is right, are you not Potter? The rest of us mere mortals should worship the very earth you walk on, shouldn’t we?” Malfoy spoke a little louder, still staring at the floor.
The Slytherin replied immediately, but barely moved at all, mostly by the shock of it. The kiss was mostly tongue and teeth; the sitting side by side position was uncomfortable, and the whole thing was over in a few seconds.
Draco made a subtle yet clear head movement suggesting Hermione that she should go. She nodded and followed Harry to lunch.
The Professor had somehow managed to explain that the pairings were posted on a sheet near the main door. He did have a scoring system that would pair them according to many variables that would optimize the number of more or less equal partners.
“Then why are you being so difficult and mean?  I just wanna help.” Harry tried to sound as nice as he could, since he could not understand what was going on in the other boy’s mind.
“I came today in case they question us separately. To make sure we tell the exact same thing,” he explained, finally sitting down on the uncomfortable metal chair facing Malfoy.
Draco was without words. There had been no steps, no build-up or plan of any kind in his mind. He just did to Potter whatever he felt like doing.
“I’m fine.” Potter answered immediately. The Gryffindor was positioned on all fours, so Draco couldn’t look into his eyes to see if he was telling the truth. He decided he had no reason not to trust him.
The same thing that had happened twice happened again: Hermione looked at him intensely while clearly considering the better answer to give him, but couldn’t, because Ron instantly said: “Are you? Planning on killing him I mean?”
It took about 2 minutes and Harry finally had to calm down to breathe and that was all it took. He closed his eyes once second, and the cage was gone the next. The immense dread that came to him was instantaneously replaced by the wonderful feeling of a hang on his cock. It was the most marvelous feeling ever, but it was soon over as he came harder than he ever did, after having spent so many weeks locked up.
“Simple. You get out of here at once. At the trial, we both tell our versions of what happened honestly. That way it’s not going to sound rehearsed.  I mean we were on opposite sides. Of course, our versions of what happened should sound and be a little different. Then I don’t know, come what may I guess.”
Harry was very close now. Too close. If Draco moved at all, Harry would think he was making a move to kiss him and that just could not happen, so he stood up swiftly. “I’m tired Potter, I’m going to bed” Draco informed him coldly.
“Yeah. Turns out Lupin managed to stop it just before it got into Snape’s potions storeroom. He might have saved a few lives that night.” Harry replied, still looking at him flirtatiously.
"So why are you here? You never come to those parties." Weasley asked with a cleared voice, not having food in his mouth anymore. Had he eaten that whole sandwich/meat pie during the hardly 10 seconds he spent looking at Hermione? And what the hell had that thing been anyway? Just when he went to ask, Granger used this time to answer Weasley's question in his place: "Because Harry asked.”
"Come what may? Are you bloody serious? You're the most annoying detail-oriented brat in all of Britain. And all you have to say for yourself is "Come what may?"" Harry yelled, sitting back in his chair and moving his arms everywhere with big unfathomable eyes.
Hermione smiled as well at the same moment. The Slytherin couldn’t believe was he was hearing from his two Gryffindor counterparts. It really sounded like they would both be okay with him actually
“You saved my life as well. We’re even Potter. Don’t play the savior hero card with me, the last thing I need right now is your pity.” Malfoy hissed; his grey eyes fixed on the grey floor. He was dressed in white shirt and trousers that were about 3 sizes too big. He was indeed pitiful, but Harry was not about to tell him that. He took a large breath and said:
He started paying more attention during Longbottom and Weasley’s duel. It was actually quite interesting to watch. They couldn’t be more opposite. Longbottom was fierce and kept casting powerful attack spells but was getting tired from never defending himself. Weasley was a lot more calculating, took his time before casting and was clearly thinking ahead. Weasley finally won after casting back to back Impedimenta and Petrificus Totalus. The first one having slowed down Longbottom too much to dodge or block the full-body bind. Draco was actually impressed by the clever way Weasley had played this.
Harry hadn’t cum in two weeks now, so it made sense that Malfoy assumed he wanted out because he was getting frustrated, and he even though he was, that had nothing to do with his current emotion.
His eyes still fixed on them, Draco whispered: "I don't know Granger, like you said, it's complicated." Hermione nodded and you could see in her eyes she was pondering what best to say to comfort and guide the Slytherin. But yet again, Ron was quicker. "Do you think about him when you wank?"
Deep in thought, he didn't notice Weasley had sat on the couch opposite him. When he came to, the first thing he noticed was the redhead biting into what could terminologically be called a sandwich, but looked more like 3 meat pies, one over the other.
Draco was sitting in the middle of the eight-year common room. Not far from him, Finnigan was telling an apparently very funny story to... heck he couldn't recall half of their names. Hufflepuff boy number three, big nose Ravenclaw girl... and what were the twins’ names again? He remembered thinking every single one of them was
It was now his turn. If the Weasel was that good, Granger would make him eat his own balls. The only way out of this was cheating.
“I never meant to hurt your feelings Malfoy, you’re right I wanted you out of your funk… I thought your reaction would be to try and break my nose again to be honest. The prom king usually doesn’t like to be chatted up by other blokes. I don’t know why I hurt you exactly, but I’m sorry. And I know it was a ruse, but I actually meant it” he blabbed, getting red in the face.
Then, Malfoy’s eyes stopped moving. He smirked, then closed his eyes and shook his head. “You did that on purpose. You wanted to say something so insane I would be forced out of my funk.” He got up and walked to the nearest wall and leaned his forehead on it. “That might just be the meanest thing you’ve ever done to me. And may I remind you, you once sliced me open.” He turned around, leaned his body on the wall. “You’ll be glad to know I’m back Potter. Your plan worked flawlessly.” He was looking right at Harry, his eyes full of betrayal and hate.
whatever your father taught you to be. But don’t think I don’t see how you act when you think no one else is looking: drinking tea, wearing a thousand scarves and reading weird and overly complicated arithmancy books. You’re like a shy hipster Ravenclaw nerd.” Harry demonstrated, leaving Draco speechless.
Still, he felt the need to sit with him. The Gryffindor couldn’t see nor understand the signals the universe sent him, but he could always
He was afraid she would be able to make those rebound on him like Potter had done instead of ricochet away and that he would end up being the one dancing this time. He thought about doing it on purpose so she would be distracted long enough by her own laughter so he could disarm her, but it was a huge risk and he was already getting tired. He was moving around a lot to block her stronger and stronger jinks and she herself was barely moving. If he was to do something big and unpredictable, he had to do it soon.
"Makes sense", Weasley nodded. Draco looked at him with a scared and questionable look. So Ron continued: "Well you've both been obsessed with each other since forever, and now have no reason whatsoever to hate each other, so those feelings had to change into something else, and it turned into flirting or whatever you two have now. I'm just saying it's logical. "
“So where do we go from here? I’m not sure I can keep this up now that I know of all your inner... I will say, struggle.” Harry was still holding his chin in place, but the grey eyes were quickly moving around to not look at the green ones.
"Hum… well actually, regarding that…" Draco blurted while Hermione was nudging Ron quite hard for asking such a private question. But Draco couldn’t take this awkwardness anymore, he had to ask: "I'm very sorry but… you two are not angry at me? Or even suspicious or I don't know. I don't understand how you're not convinced I'm planning on maliciously seducing him in order to eventually kill him in his sleep or something?”
Fortunately, the cage was magical so all he had to do was manage to touch it long enough to cast the spell so it would come off. He consequently got off the bed, picked up his wand on the nightstand and waited patiently for Potter's squirming to diminish.
"Why did you come then?", she asked again with a look that appeared to be... just interested in his well being. This couldn't be happening.
He then realised the ropes were gone. He finally opened his eyes to discover Malfoy looking absolutely mortified by what just happened.
He remembered fifth year, when Pansy has kissed him on a dare. He spent the next week having vivid dreams about new versions of that kiss. In most of them, Potter had been the one kissing him.
“Of course, the great Savior of the world would accept to help a Death Eater get better at defending himself. Don’t kid yourself Granger. This year in Hogwarts is only a delayed sentence for me. The minute I’m out of here, I’m dead. Unless I learn to properly defend myself. And who else is better to teach me how than the DADA king?”
Harry felt like he should be adamant on the fact he was fine. But Malfoy wanted to talk, maybe he could convince him to keep him after the end of the year. After he convinced him to cage his Cock again.
They were all to duel one pairing after the other, so they could all watch and learn. It was way more official than what they usually did in that class and it was putting Draco on edge. Granger, having been in close encounter of Potter’s magic for years, would annihilate him.
“I wouldn’t mind being back in the cage. Got me crazy horny all the time.” Harry practically begged, directly sending all the blood in Draco’s body to his cock.
“Don’t be daft Potter. Cast a jinx at me. Cast 10 for all I care. If any reach me, I will gladly admit defeat and proclaim you high and clear: Potter, the great knower of all.
They both took their position and bowed appropriately. Granger casted a Cautio almost immediately so Draco couldn’t cast small jinxes anymore and thus forcing him to cast stronger hexes.
“I don’t think it’s a good idea.” The blond boy managed to enunciate after taking a long breath. He had to get away from him. He slowly got up and started dressing.
All Harry could see in those grey eyes were his own loss projected into the only enemy he had left. With Voldemort gone, Malfoy was it. The perfect personification of all his troubles. It was so easy to blame Malfoy. For the war and everyone’s deaths. He was the perfect punching bag.
“Everything, of course. It started because of your guilt; it went on because of mine.” Harry decided to go with it, feeling the discussion had reached the point of no return for them. These things just could not wait anymore to be said.
Fortunately for the both of them, all that control that Potter had given him over the last months gave him the courage to not do it. Not yet. He had to make this right first.
The grey-eyed boy closed his eyes again. He looked so young and vulnerable in that room, in those clothes, in that light. He gulped and without opened his eyes, said: “So if I get out of here, would you want to give this a shot? Dating a man? Dating me?”
“I don’t pity you Malfoy. To be honest, I don’t give much of a shit about you, I’m just trying to do the right thing. You, rotting in here isn’t right.”
A few weeks later, having provoked Potter a couple more times into explaining more and more complicated defense spells, Draco felt a lot more confident in his capacities. Fortunately, it was this day Lukewarm decided to make his class a lot less boring.
Harry actually had a casual meeting with the Minister that night, like Malfoy had guessed. He could bring Malfoy along, that would grandly help him and his future career. He could play seekers games with him at night. He could make out with him on the Ravenclaw table for that matter. The Wizarding world would forgive him anything, just like the staff and kids here let him wonder at night and let him do whatever he wanted.
!” Harry cast, noticing too late Malfoy executing the totally wrong hand movement for the Cautio charm, but the right one for a perfect and very powerful shielding charm. The dancing feet spell rebounded on the shield and soon enough Harry was dancing like crazy in the middle of class.
“What guilt could you possibly have? I don’t recall hearing of you torturing muggles to satisfy some evil bastard’s kinks.”, the Slytherin probed, glaring at Harry like he was insane.
“No we are not. You are clearly trying to seduce me back in bed and that is therefore not a good idea. You will say anything to get me to cage you again. We will have this talk properly when you are not a sex addicted, life trauma escaping survivor guilted idiot anymore. I will admit thought that we should have had this talk months ago. I honestly can’t believe I never noticed what was going on earlier.” Draco declared, looking as determined as ever.
A shiver ran over her body. She spasmed, and all her edges faded. “Wh-what’s happening?” she sobbed.
Throughout the rest of the morning and afternoon, Draco heard snatches of the children's songs through the open shop door. Keeping the kids busy with singing practice was one of the ways Harry stayed sane, and they'd sung at ministry events or fundraiser dinners before. This wasn't new for them. All the same, Draco wished he could have spent more time out there, making sure that Holly was alright and that Jamie wasn't trying to scale the building, and less time trying to return lost five-year-olds to their frazzled parents.
She broke off, and looked, panicked, at Draco and Pansy, and Draco couldn’t stop himself--both of the Gryffindors were wearing shocked, horrified expressions, as if he was going to throw a young-Malfoy tantrum at just the mention of Buckbeak’s name.
Oh Merlin, this is what Hermione meant about not saying terrible things. He muttered an apology that seemed to pass, because Ron led them to the telephone booth, demonstrated the phone number, and whisked himself into the ministry. Draco did not say anything about how he’d been to the Ministry dozens of times with his father and knew how to get in just fine, thank you. No Malfoy had been in the building outside of their own trials since the end of the war. He couldn’t know what kind of security precautions they’d put in place against people like him.
Draco frowned at the newspaper. It wasn't turned to the front page. Even at his worst, Draco wasn't front page news. In fact, he was hardly what had made the paper. But this was still bad. He snatched up the paper and staggered a few steps back from the display.
"You get away from us, And don't show your face around here again," Andromeda shouted, slamming the door.
Draco looked around in both directions. There were muggles passing by on the bridge, and none of them seemed to realize there was someone drowning in the water right below them. Well, if there was no one here to play hero, he would have to do. He shrugged out of his coat, toed off his boots, and clumsily swung both legs over the rail.
Draco found a box to adjust on the shelf. Potter was giving him that blinding smile now, and Draco had no defenses for that. "You'd get on just fine without me. I'm only over there an evening or two each week."
“Why aren’t they going to do that with the first years? Or second years? It they want unity, start with the ones who weren’t actively trying to kill each other last year,” he muttered. His head was dancing with visions of Potter and Weasley cornering him.
He didn’t feel like eating the eggs, but it would make him seem unaffected. He took a bite and focused on the sensation of chewing. Pansy sat down at his left hand, putting her face far too close to his. “What did he say, Draco?”
"Dudley--that's the cousin--he was my year at school. He made sure that everyone at school saw me just the way he did. The way his parents taught him to see me. Like a little freak."
His hands twitched. He pinched one of his fingers to keep from reaching for his wand. "You don't understand. I didn't deserve a choice. Colin Creevey. Cedric Diggory. Remus. They deserved a choice. All of them were just taken, and I'm still here."
"Thought that anyone who could figure out the charms ought to have their own crack at making things," Fred muttered. "Didn't exactly foresee that they'd want to settle two shops down and put us out of business."
From inside the shop, though, he did have a good view of Harry, shaking hands and striking poses, lifting up little kids to reach the shining baubles on the Christmas tree. Draco tried not to look over too often. He had other things to think about. It was undoubtedly their busiest day of the year. He still got a few looks of disgust or hard elbows from customers, but that didn't stop their money from changing hands. It was impossible to stop for long enough to get a sense of their daily total, but Draco had a feeling that the goblins just might be satisfied with what they had to offer.
He stepped forward, only to freeze again. Something was wrong--there was a sound, interrupting the peace of the night, and a flash of something red-and-gold, and then the swirling of the snow was the only thing he could see.
Sam was practically dancing on the spot, and two of the Ravenclaws were asking a question a minute about how they’d worked it out.
It was too late, because Harry had just thrown his arms around Draco and pulled him close. "Are you being serious? Can I kiss you?"
“No,” Harry said. And then he reached up fingers curled in hesitancy and pressed them to the scar that ran from Draco’s collarbone to his sternum. There were other scars, a small roadmap of them, but Harry’s fingers lingered on this one.
He didn't have time for wandering anymore, or worrying about taking Claire to the hospital. He had to know that Andromeda and Teddy were alive and safe. He ran through the streets, his footsteps skidding and slipping every time he changed directions. There--even from the end of the block, he could see a candle in the window. The rest of the world could be upside down, but Teddy would be alright. He collided with the door, knocking urgently.
Potter knocked his glasses up on his forehead and scrubbed at his eyes. “I don’t want them to know. They’ve spent the past seven years looking after me. Hermione wiped her parents’ memory so she could go searching for the horcruxes with me without getting them involved. They’re happy. And they deserve it.”
When Potter had figured out where he was and who was speaking to him, he blinked up. His eyes looked different without his glasses, and not just because he was squinting. “What’s getting worse?”
“But I wasn’t trying to hurt myself,” she argued. “I wasn’t trying to do anything.” They had reached the first floor landing and turned toward the Hospital Wing.
Draco slipped into his pajama shirt and did up the buttons. Slowly, because his foolish fingers were trembling. He starved one thought, and then another. There was no reason for his fingers to tremble. He didn’t even know what emotion was causing this. Anger? Fear? There was no reason to feel disappointed that Ron had gone  to talk with Potter when he ran out of the room and not stayed to help Malfoy figure out what the hell had just happened. He didn’t want to talk to Weasley about it, anyway.
Speaking of your father, he reports that he would like to hear more of you and less of Potter in your next letter. He seems concerned that your interest in him has become...unhealthy. I’m sure you just need an opportunity to vent, but we are both much more interested in your progress and achievements than whatever the Potter boy has gotten up to.
Draco blinked. His head felt fuzzy. He'd been walking over here--walking over here to make a deposit. A deposit for the joke shop. There was gold--somewhere. He squeezed his eyes closed, then opened them again.
"What were you--" Draco broke off, trying and failing to keep from laughing. "Give me that quill, Potter, that's my new favorite thing."
Fred leaned over the counter to drop a sack of gold on Draco, and George heaved another at him. Draco staggered under the weight before he cast a weightlessness charm on both bags. "Just how much money did you owe the bank?"
"Hel--!" The voice was cut off when the head in the water caught a wave to the face. Nothing for it. Draco squeezed his eyes shut and pushed away from the bridge.
Draco felt his words like a blow to the gut. He'd known that. He'd known that when he first started at the Weasley's shop, that it was better if he stayed out of things. He'd known that when he started living with Teddy and Andromeda. And he'd for certain known it when he started visiting the home. How had he been so stupid as to forget?
Draco tried to make another escape, but Pansy and Finnegan literally dragged him over to the couch and handed him a glass of something alcoholic that he neither asked for nor intended to drink. And as Ron did another retelling of the whole day from the moment the trial started to the instant Lacey cast her Patronus, this time with even more drama and intrigue, Draco watched for Harry to come through the door.
The boys filed out, and Draco was finally able to take a breath that filled his lungs and let it all the way back out again.
“Did anybody else go get help? We need Potter. And Madame Pomfrey. And the Headmistress, if anyone can find her.” Malfoy wasn’t even a professor. He didn’t know how to help a little kid who was about to transform into an obscurial. He’d only heard about it in whispered conversations.
Devon Hariot rolled his eyes, but the exchange had captured the attention of most of the class, and Harry jumped on it. "I want you all to think hard. With all the tools that magic folk have, what are some of the ways that someone could disguise themselves? What can we be looking for?"
He slumped into one of the student’s chairs, and Draco turned around to finish with the tea. When he turned around, Potter’s forehead was planted on the desk. A fat tear plunked down on the wood.
He was interrupted by the stomach-turning sound of another student, retching twice and making a run for the wastebasket while spewing down his front. Harry pinched the bridge of his nose. Penny's best friend, getting sick moments after her bloody nose. Why couldn't they at least be subtle about using Skiving Snacks? "I guess you'll have someone to make sure you get there. Both of you--"
Draco looked up through his eyelashes to see that Potter was shifting in his seat and dull flush was creeping up from his collar. “Maloy knows what I said and how he responded. I don’t see what good repeating that conversation is going to do anyone.”
The next thing Draco knew, he was standing just inside the door of Gringotts, holding a deposit slip.
is how they let a criminal like you get so involved with things. Not just the joke shop, either. I don't expect people have ever given much thought to how Potter is always letting a convicted criminal come around his group home."
"Thanks," she said. "Much better. We tracked down Lockhart since witnesses placed him out on the street when Draco disappeared. A quick
"Will you believe, the goblins said they'd keep a skeleton crew there late tonight just for our deposit. I think they've gotten fond of us!"
"I talked to Ginny," Draco said in a low voice. "I went and found Ginny and asked her what I was doing wrong, and do you know what she said?"
Draco did not want Potter in his head just at the moment. It was too agitated, everything was pulsing and edging out of place. But that was the test of an Occlumens. To seem like there was nothing to hide when there was.
Pansy tilted her chin, studying Draco. “You don’t think it makes it rather clear that you’re obsessed with him?
Harry laughed, and finally Draco started unwrapping the gift, untying the brown twine and peeling away the tape at the corners, unfolding the paper gingerly, and then turning over the framed canvas to see the picture that Harry had commissioned from Luna.
"And you think it would make any of it better if you died tonight?" she said. Her voice was softer now, less over-bright and aggressive, and it hit all the harder.
Draco traced one tine of his fork through his mashed potatoes. This was the exact conclusion he’d come to. After all the classes they’d taught together and laughing next to each other on broomsticks and touching knees on the damn train, Potter had decided that he didn’t want to hurt Draco. He didn’t want to laugh or goad. He just wanted to explain away Draco’s feelings so he didn’t have to face them.
Potter sobbed and pounded his knuckles on the desk. “It was supposed to be better, now. Than it was for me. Or Riddle.”
Draco checked the clock. The shop would open at seven, and they’d be on their feet all day. All three of them worked long hours in the weeks leading up to Christmas, and the shop was left a mess after all the little snot-flicking small people left their mark. The parents weren't much better. If he had to listen to another grown witch or wizard demand that he find them a pygmy puff in "a proper boy color" he could not be held responsible for his actions.
“I knew they shouldn’t have let him play professor. All that power is going to his head. He’s obviously got favorites.”
“Third year,” Granger replied automatically. When we were researching the legal case for Buckbeak--”
It was just typical of Draco to walk in on Harry when he was in the midst of losing a fight with a cursed quill. "Arresto momentum," he tried. "Reducto. Get
Draco eyed the house. It wasn't what he'd come to think of as Potter's style. For one thing, it was the biggest house on the block, and it looked like he had a team of people for the upkeep. At least this place had light coming from the windows and a wreath on the door. Potter couldn’t be here, but he didn’t have another idea. He knocked.
Of course. So he knew everything. Draco tried to force full lungfuls of air in and out instead of sharp short sips.
“We’re not giving anybody the idea that we’ve let bygones be bygones if we only talk in the 8th year common room. It’s the younger ones we really need to convince.” Pansy sounded like she was talking to convince Granger. He wasn’t going to be able to complain about the lesson if Granger was here, spying on everything.
Draco administered himself three drops of their (admittedly gloopy) potion, and Potter did the same. Around the room, the other partners were in the middle of the same process.
Harry closed his eyes. "I just can't think right now. Every time I try to get to an answer about that question, I get just as sidetracked as I did when we talked. I know that Hermione would be able to tell me an answer. Ron probably would, too. Anyone probably could tell me a good answer, but I can't tell myself anything."
Seamus looked at the lot of them, shocked. “Viktor Krum? Both of you? He’s all scowly and duck-footed.”
Draco knew he had been dismissed. Just like Sam, he wanted to argue that he should get to stay at Lacey’s side and make sure she was really alright. But he’d known from the beginning that he wasn’t the right person for the job.
He fished the keys out of his pocket and wiggled the correct one into the door. It took a lot of shifting and jiggling to get the shop door open. Fred said that was part of the charm of the joke shop--it was always pulling little jokes back on them. When Draco said that it wasn't funny and they should just use a spell, George pointed out that they didn't keep Draco on for his sense of humor.
Harry managed to get Draco outside the doors of the Great Hall before he spun to look at him. "Well. It's your birthday. What do you want to do?" Harry meant to leave the door open for anything, but he was pretty sure his voice made it clear just what he wanted to do with Draco at this point.
Potter was shifting from foot to foot, backing up slowly. “Now that I think about it, maybe you do want to find another roommate. I think I’m just going to go—anywhere that’s not here.”
And Draco could have bristled at that. When he’d first started at the joke shop, he would have. Back then he still thought this was a temporary stop on his journey to something greater. Draco Malfoy wasn’t the kind of person to end up trapped as a shopkeeper for the rest of his life.
“No,” she answered, her lips pressed into a pout, “Not anymore, so that’s not much good to you, I’m afraid. This is where Harry lives. Are we going to talk to him?"
“You must have learned Occlumency young, too. You’re a genius at it! Can you imagine, if you were the first person to teach an entire year of Hogwarts students to be Occlumens?”
"Harry," she sighed. "You are great, and I am so glad we are friends, but I really, really do not want to be counseling my ex-boyfriend's new boyfriend about how to get along with him. And I really, really do not want to be rehashing those conversations with my ex-boyfriend. Cheers."
But he wasn't. Harry opened his mouth. Draco was telling him everything, there was no guessing wrong and mucking it up. He could just tell Draco that he did feel the same, but all the gears inside of him felt locked into place. Say words, Harry. Tell him something.
As soon as he’d walked to the front of the room, a Gryffindor with giant brown eyes had raised their hand and asked, “Are you actually a Death Eater?” and Draco hadn’t known what to say. He spluttered. He adjusted his robes. He looked desperately to Potter for help.
More points were exchanged, but Ginny was keeping them in the lead. He hummed a few lines of Weasley is Our King to himself. He should make a verse for Ginny. When she went professional it would sweep the nation. They’d sing it at the World Cup one day.
Harry picked up the ring Hermione pointed to. The ring had two intertwined bands. One was all white gold and the other was reminiscent of a snake with some areas tinged green. It also had an emerald in the centre of the band. Harry smiled widely at Hermione.
Hermione pulled away. "I need to get going. I just wanted an update. Good night, Harry. I love you." She kissed the top of his head.
Both Severus and Hermione sat on her bed thinking of their happy future together, holding each other close.
Slowly, Harry slid his middle finger into Draco. Harry moaned at the sensation and Draco hissed at the burn. “Relax, Dray. I’ll take care of you.” His finger bottomed out.
Harry looked away embarrassed. “It just kinda hit me that my parents, Sirius and Remus won’t be here for my wedding. I always wished they could all be there. I know I have the Weasleys, you and Draco but it still feels like something is missing.” A tear ran down his cheek.
Blaise tried to comfort his girlfriend but she slapped his hand away. “Pans, he is not worth your rage. I get that he is more despicable than Voldemort ever was and that is saying something but please calm down.” He reasoned and she nodded.
Harry smiled widely back at Draco. “Does this mean you forgive me, future husband?” He blushed at the word husband.
Narcissa observed their interaction. She finished her tea and sandwich. "Boys, I am going to take my leave. I believe you have a lot of issues to suss out. Enjoy and do try to be kind to each other." She nodded to Harry and left the room.
Draco looked at the food on the table. “My favourite meal?” He looked at Harry as they settled in their seats. “What is going on?”
Harry watched the exchange not knowing what to think of it all. Draco got off the sofa and walked to him and hugged him close. He kissed Harry on the cheek. Harry grabbed Draco’s hand and squeezed it and gave him a small smile.
"I mean you do not have to stay if you rather not. I just thought we could get to know each other more. I mean we are trying to be friends. I thought it would make sense if you stayed awhile longer. I am sorry it was a silly idea. Forgive my forwardness." Draco rambled nervously.
Once he was ready, he started down the stairs but he nearly missed a step as his thoughts kept going back to Potter and his eyes.
As if Snape could hear his thoughts, he sneered at Harry. "I see congratulations are in order. Draco snagged himself the precious Saviour of the Wizarding World. I am sure Lucius will be thrilled to know his son is bent and canoodling with the Boy Who Lived Twice." He said in a sarcastic manner.
After Harry put the kettle on the stove he turned around in Draco's arms so he was facing him. They stared at each other for what seemed like an eternity. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco's neck and pulled him closer. Their lips were just inches apart. Both leaned forward until their lips were finally touching. At first it was a soft, tentative kiss. As the kiss continued it got more passionate as if they craved each other's touch. They were in their own little world until the kettle whistling broke the trance and they pulled apart embarrassed a bit. Harry made up the tea and put on the kitchen table. Both sat in silence at the table. They sipped at their tea.
Harry was about to respond but Draco and Narcissa distracted him as they descended the stairs. Draco looked so exhausted. Harry smiled at him warmly. When they reached the bottom of the stairway, Draco walked over to Harry and wrapped his arms around him. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco as well.
Both were silent as the grave until Hermione piped in. "Again, thank you for keeping me company and being there for me. I appreciate it, Sev."
Hermione smiled widely. “It is a date, Sev.” She moved closer to him and pulled him into a hug. As she pulled back, he gave her a searing kiss like she had a few moments ago.
Draco never sat up so fast realising that it was the day Potter was coming to the Manor for tea. He remembered how nervous he was yesterday and now his anxiety was sky high. He gulped "Oh right I thought I dreamed that." He muttered.
Draco had watery eyes. “Love, you are the best thing that has ever happened to me. I love you beyond life itself. And I look forward to becoming your husband someday. No one else compares to you and our future life together.” He kissed Harry softly.
Draco got Hermione's attention. "Severus summoned Harry because I had nightmares last night and was screaming so loudly that I broke through my wards. Severus and Mother woke up and ran to my room. They woke me up and asked if I was okay. They suggested that I take a break from the Manor and contacted Harry to see if he would be willing to let me stay with him. Obviously he was and here we are having breakfast with you." He smiled softly at her.
Harry smiled at him. "I believe so. But what do friends usually talk about?" He eyed Draco curiously.
Severus just stood there stunned and place his fingers where she had kissed him. Once he was out of the trance, he walked back to the Manor. He was greeted by Narcissa who gave him a knowing smile.
Once they arrived, both Narcissa and Severus greeted them warmly. Narcissa hugged them both and Severus just nodded at them.
Draco bit his lip and blushed. "Let us go then." They held onto each other's hands and apparated outside the gate of Malfoy Manor.
"Harry Potter lives here, and Luna lives here almost all the time, and fifteen kids right now. Jamie and Holly and Alana and Zoe and Maya--"
When the first years had left the classroom, Draco gathered up his scarf and robe, and before he could stop himself, he offered, “It’s impressive you’ve got two of them casting Patronuses already.”
“Right. And if you can’t even trust me, how will any of the others?” Draco hated that the hurt seeped out into his voice. He waited, but Potter couldn’t even formulate the beginning of a sentence this time. “That’s what I thought. Goodnight, Potter.”
"She's not the Weasley girl anymore," Claire reminded helpfully. Draco’s gut twisted again. “The children’s home doesn’t exist because you weren’t there to help him make it through the first year. He got married to Ginny instead. The Holyhead Harpies haven’t had a winning season since.”
"And that's why you want to become a professor at Hogwarts." Harry tugged on the handle of a cupboard, but it didn't give, and he slid out his wand to sort it out. "Because it will make you look so impressive?"
"I want people to remember the Malfoy name," Draco said, and before Harry could even think it, he rushed, "And not the way they do now. Is there something wrong with that? Is it so bad that I want to leave my own mark?"
To all the readers who stuck with me though this story: Thank you so much. This year has been--so much for so many people. I abruptly lost my job working with students in March due to Coronavirus shut downs, and not a day goes by that I don't think about the kids in unsafe or unstable situations. That ended up playing a big part in writing this.
That had been back when Draco still wanted to hit the smug grin off of Harry's face. Back when Harry's frequent visits to the joke shop caused Draco to find work in the back room to minimize the awkwardness of the two of them being in the same place for any length of time. They weren't enemies. Not exactly. Draco had done enough in the final Battle of Hogwarts that Potter had officially spoken in Draco's defense at his trial. It was probably the only thing that kept Draco and his parents from living out their days in Azkaban. But they'd been a far cry from friends.
“Okay, back to the list,” Hermione frowned. Even starry-eyed with drinks and veritaserum, Hermione was focused on whatever she’d just chosen as her goal.
"Of course I did. You can't possibly know how it feels that I've already mucked up my prospects forever. I'm touchy about it. I hate talking about it. That doesn't mean I want you to leave me on my own to figure it out."
The thrill he got in the center of his chest when Potter scowled at him? The nights he stayed awake in bed planning how he’d come out ahead in his next argument with Potter? The fact that Potter was the first person he thought of whenever he learned a new hex?
Hermione jumped a little, clapping her hands. The gesture reminded Harry of a younger Hermione, one who hadn't gotten quite so fed up with the Ministry.
He stomped through the fresh snow. "Claire. I know you think you're helping, but you're not. You have no idea what a mess I've gotten everyone in. All my friends. My family. I've destroyed everything they've worked for."
Draco handed his cookie to Claire and started shuffling through the snow. "Maybe the Weasley girl is right, and we should take you to the hospital. Maybe I should check myself in, too. Might get a reprieve from Azkaban."
"Look, Harry. I just told him he's doing the best he can. It's what I did. Take you to the sunny places that you never think to go, kiss you so that you're happy and distracted for a few minutes. Try to balance out all the times when you're too lost in the thoughts that you won't share. Draco's doing the best he can, it's not his fault that you’re the way you are."
That advert hadn't been the only one, and the back-to-school rush that usually gave the shop such a boost never came. The crowds were all at Lockhart's Laughs, forking over galleons by the bucketload. And one morning, Draco arrived at the Joke Shop to find magically shifting graffiti that proclaimed, “Deatheaters aren’t funny. Sack the Snake.”
No no. Not this. Draco had thought this moment couldn't get worse, but his heart sank even lower. His breath puffed visibly in the air in small, tight gasps. “Mr. Lockhart.”
Or he could open his mouth and remove all doubt. “There’s a difference between colliding with me in a match and trailing your hand down my sternum.” He wasn’t sure why he’d said it, except that some part of him revelled in making a bad situation irredeemable. He was too embarrassed to see how the Weasley clan had taken it, but Potter was positively spluttering.
There was no mistaking the disappointment in the Headmistresses eyes, even as she forced a smile. "The Ministry will be thrilled to hear it."
"Speaking of the life ahead of you, do you want to return to any of our previous conversations? A few weeks ago, you were thinking a lot about what would come when you were finished with school."
Draco felt his cheeks glow red. They managed to bring up that dumb incident every time. Every time! At least he could answer truthfully. “No.” Although if it had, he might have been almost as reluctant to show them its form.
Harry resisted the urge to push Draco on this point. He knew the exact moment that he had started liking Draco Malfoy: it had been the beginning of eighth year, and Draco and Neville had walked into the room when everyone else was winding down from their party. Draco had been more rumpled and sleepy than usual, and when someone handed him a glass, he didn't drink any of it. Harry had looked over at him and realized that after all the disgust and anger he'd held for Draco, after all the fear and pity he'd felt when Draco turned out out be a little bit useful and not-entirely-evil during the war, this was what was left. Ever-so-slightly rumpled Draco sitting with Pansy and Hermione on the couch, glowing in the firelight and looking like he was in the midst of a game and hadn't figured out the rules. And Harry had thought: Things could be different now. I want them to be different with him.
Granger glanced from Pansy to Draco, and Draco felt a surprising surge of gratitude at Granger that this morning felt so normal. Like she was mildly annoyed that he existed, but not because he had a crush on her best friend.
With that, Potter was standing in the wide open room of Draco’s mind, this time with far more purpose. He strode over to the bookshelf. “When I look into Mr. Malfoy’s mind, I don’t get a rush of different memories or emotions. It looks like a study, or a library, and all his thoughts are neatly put away.”
Draco should have expected to be forced into a chair in an empty classroom after they were finished with classes for the day. He should have expected that Hermione would seat Harry in a chair opposite him and hold her wand at the ready in case one of them did something stupid.
Potter scrambled to his feet and held out a hand to help Draco up. Everyone was watching. He couldn’t just bat Potter’s hand out of the way. But he couldn’t hold onto it for too long, either. He let Potter’s grip close around his hand, sturdy and reliable, and lift him to his feet.
Harry stood up, joints cracking like an old person’s. “Merlin it’s late. We should get some sleep. Thanks for waiting up, Draco.”
Potter didn’t have nightmares like that. As with everything else, he had to be the center of attention.
He moved his fist up an inch, then down on the table. He gave a tight shake of his head. He didn’t have to see her expression to know she was annoyed as she walked away. The plan was to do all this together, and he was already flaking out on her.
Potter looked ready to ignite, but he kept his voice low and level. “I think we should take Lacey to see Madame Pomfrey. And then I would like to discuss,” he cut himself off and continued in an even lower voice. “I’d like to discuss what caused this to happen.”
Had the Pepper-up potion worn off? It was impossible to know--Draco’s pulse was pounding and his brain spinning.
Ginny walked them to the door and gave them both a cookie. "He hates being reminded about the home," she sighed. "But good luck. You might want to take her to St. Mungo's?"
“Up late marking the eighth years’ essays.” Draco finished. “You’d have less grading to do if you didn’t assign us so much work.” Harry looked at him. “The longer you let it sit, the more likely we’re going to fail the potion, Potter.”
With a shove, Draco expelled Potter from his mind and focused back on the students before them. “Simple Occlumency is like a shield, or a brick wall. You hold the other person out of your mind. But if you’ve done that, it’s already too late. They know that you’re hiding something.”
"No. I'm whinging now," Harry had answered. And for the next hour straight, he had vented every anger, frustration, and irritation catalogued at the kids in his care, and Draco was in stitches.
Harry scrambled to grab a few of the actually useful things that he'd found around the room and deposit them in the aquarium in the back. He was quiet, listening to Draco's voice in the dark castle, saying a spell that he probably didn't even need to speak aloud now, but the voice was comforting. "Evanesco. And you too. Evanesco."
That sounded impossible. Harry opened his mouth, forced his mouth to move. "That sounds impossible."
By half past ten, all of the kids were in a line just outside the door of the shop, and Draco handed each of them a bouquet. "I'm nervous," Holly whispered.
"Maybe this year," Draco scoffed. "But next year I'm going to be on staff here, and I'm going to be sure that the Slytherin team knows how to play properly."
Draco watched, frozen, as McGonagall and Sprout managed to pry him off the stool and walk him over to the table. There was no applause. No cheers. The silence broke as people began to whisper about what had happened.
Ron took the paperwork away from Hermione, lifted her to her feet, and wrapped her in a jubilant hug. “You did it, Hermione. Now relax.”
The door rattled open again, and Draco spun around, heart already thumping in his ears. There was Harry, a red-and-gold scarf sloppily looped around his neck and mountains of snow resting on his black curls.
When Draco had first come to work for them, he'd thought their childish antics would spell disaster for the store. But that wasn't it. They both worked hard. Yes, he had to come open the store in the morning, which was what came of being the only non-owner employee--but the two of them were often in the workroom until midnight brewing the next big thing.
Hermione looked irritated. “The ministry is removing the stipulations on your wands. But each of you is still supposed to have a sponsor to “oversee” your magic uses and “handle complaints.” If you use illegal magic, you should go through the same channels as everyone else. And if you don’t, why should people be complaining about it?”
“Right,” Draco recited. “Teaching all the first years how to cast Patronuses. Teaching the eighth years Auror level defensive and anti-jinx spells. Teaching first years Occlumency.”
“I am sorry if Draco thought I meant he wasn’t doing a good enough job. He's much more fun to have around than I anticipated. Now, if you don't mind, I've got a story to finish, and you probably have some--I don't know, personal reflection to avoid?"
Harry shook his head. "It's at least as exciting as Quidditch. And they're going to start soon, so--"
"Of course I am." Most of the time Draco would be glad not to be recognized everywhere he went as a former Death Eater, but at this point he just wanted to get to Harry and end this terrible day. "Draco Malfoy. Don't you recognize me?" He felt his pocket for his wand, but couldn't find it at the moment. No matter, he had identification that always worked. He raised the sleeve on his left arm, fully prepared for everyone who was crowding around in the Leaky to gasp and recoil.
Draco gave the girl a second look. Her dress looked clean and new, and her shoes were expensive. If she was lost, or a runaway, it had happened recently. Some poor non-magic family was probably searching frantically for the girl. He cleared his throat. "Is there--what's your name? We should get you back to your family."
What a classic Hogwarts staffing choice. No one else was available, so why not use someone who hadn’t finished his own education, much less had any formal training in the curriculum? Leave it to Potter to think he could finish his classes while also teaching three. It was only the weakest of consolations that it seemed to be wrecking him.
Happy September 1st/Return to Hogwarts! I really wanted to post today to celebrate, but I'm hoping to post again tomorrow, thereby making this a bonus/beginning of the school year celebration.
“It doesn’t matter,” Harry rushed. “I just thought. Well, we ended all the effects of the spell. I just wondered if there was an explanation for why I kind of--miss him.”
"Sorry, Professor," Hariot interrupted, putting his hand in the air at the same time that he started talking. "No offense, but that's you, isn't it? I mean, none of us have got Death Eaters trying to kill us, so--"
betrayed me. And I can't go on only trusting Ron and Hermione the whole rest of my life, but I don't know how to start trusting someone, even someone that I enjoy and I'm proud of and I always want to come to rest against.
Malfoy startled. He looked around for the mistaken voice and spotted a Slytherin first year looking up at him.
Maybe they already knew about the missing money. Maybe the Aurors had already been here, looking for him.
He was contemplating asking her this when Weasley sat down next to her, and those thoughts stuttered to a halt and died.
"You didn't have patents on anything?" Draco had raged, looking from one rather dispirited twin to the other.
So. He’d change in Ron’s room. It would be fine. Harry was still--somewhere. Somewhere else. He lowered his pajamas onto the bed to free his hands, then tensed and hesitated at the sounds of footsteps in the hall. The footsteps passed by, and he grimaced at his own jumpiness. This should not be a big deal. He stepped out of his trousers and into the comforting excellence of his green and silver pajama pants, then moved to pull his jumper over his head.
It was clear that no one wanted him or Pansy to be in the alley. The rest of the wizarding world didn’t want to see anybody who’d been connected with the Death Eaters. And when it came to Draco and Pansy, the wizards were out for blood. People weren’t happy that the two of them had dodged Azkaban and merely received a strict probation. He knew this because both of them had received quite a few pieces of emphatic mail before the Ministry started filtering everything addressed to their house through the Auror department to check for hexes.
Draco staggered to his feet and started running. He passed his own home--it was mysteriously dark, no candles in the window, and the joke shop, once again boasting the rabbit and the hat on top of the building.
“McGonagall says it’s Lacey’s choice. But she’s twelve. She’s twelve years old and she almost ripped herself into pieces today. I know I can’t save everyone.” Harry’s voice sounded like a bruise. “But isn’t there anything we can do to protect anyone?"
Draco cleared his throat nervously and traced his finger on his own desk. “Not you, Potter. You don’t want to be that wizard.”
"Professor Potter? My nose is bleeding. Can I go to Madame Pomfrey?" One of the Gryffindor girls had her hand pressed to her nose, trying to stem the spurts of blood.
Hermione stood, brushing her hands on her robes. “I think the two of you can handle it from here. But honestly, if you’re not talking this evening, we’re going to Pansy’s plan, which was to lock you both in a closet and see if the hormones take over. See you both at dinner.”
“Ron?” Hermione’s eyebrows drew together. “I know you and Harry like seeing Snuffles, but don’t you think it’s for the best--”
Draco felt his mouth drop open in shock. He couldn’t be here. It was one thing sitting through classes full of students who hated him. It was another having Potter as a professor. Maybe he could drop the course? He would go talk to Slughorn later, and say that his career plans had changed.
“You think you can live with us, in our quarters, and it’s just going to be normal? Like any of us are going to feel safe?”
"They said you stole nearly a thousand galleons from the Weasleys, but we knew that couldn't be right. They're right over there."
“If you insist. Anything for you, Draco.” He laughed at the stricken expression that crossed Draco’s face. “Anything for the joke shop, then.”
Draco’s stomach started to churn. Why was he the only one who could see how terrible of an idea this was? The only one who could picture himself sneering at the table while the Weasleys exchanged god-awful knit objects.
Harry shrugged. “I don’t know if I’d be able to do it, either. You’ve seen more than anyone what a mess I’ve been making of things this year.”
“Since when did Potter have Draco’s wand?” Pansy had missed that side of things, and when Pansy asked where his wand was, Draco had let her think that he lost it during the war. Which, in a way, he had.
Just as he was about to answer, Hermione Granger slid into the seat next to Pansy, and Draco’s mouth clamped shut while his eyes wandered over to inspect Granger for any signs that she was about to hex or otherwise attack him.
There was scattered laughter, but Draco couldn’t join in. He wanted recognition, but for things that he’d actually done. This had been a fluke, and they were all lucky to have survived.
"And with that," McGonagall said, looking out the window, "I believe that all three of us have a Quidditch match to attend. Gryffindor looks poised to take the cup again."
He still couldn’t see Potter’s face. He hadn’t looked at it once since Potter had started mocking him for being Patronus-forming-level-obsessed with him. But he could imagine what it looked like now. Hurt, betrayal, confusion. He knew what those expressions looked like on Potter’s face.
There was a small, rushing panic in Harry's chest when she said that, the protests he wanted to make about how many people had lost their lives because of him, and how the world would have been better with them in it. But that didn't negate what Healer Goodnight was saying. He forced himself to nod.
"Draco Malfoy, is that you? There are people out of their warm houses searching all over London for you."
"He's still out looking for you," Kingsley intoned from behind him. "I sent a Patronus to track him down, so--"
"Running in the corridors?" Her mouth twisted, and Harry wasn't sure if she was trying to contain laughter or displeasure. "I should take points from your houses. But I have something to discuss with the two of you."
Of all the--Draco’s eyes bulged. “Potter. My bleeding Patronus is a doe. I made it after you took me with you on the holidays. I stood in front of first-years that hated me because you asked me to.” He could stop there. That would be fine. “I made buttons about how you stink when we were in fourth year! I got Snape to teach me Occlumency so no one could figure out how I felt. I’m still angry that you didn’t want to be friends with me first year! How was I supposed to come to the conclusion that you had any interest in me?”
Ugh. Undo the damage. “And I’ll have a better time not spending my holiday with the Weasel-y clan.” He’d tried to call them the Weasel clan, but he’d choked over the word. What kind of soft--
"Yep," Harry grinned, rolling his sleeves up. Why did Draco have such long arms? "The good news is that neither of us intended you any harm. But you can see just how easy it is to miss, even with people you see every day."
So Draco gave Teddy a piggy-back ride to bed and read one (and then one more, and then just one more) picture book to Teddy.
Draco wished that he was still good at lying to Hermione. He wished he was still good at lying at all, and that he hadn’t done the exact opposite of what he’d trained to do and opened wide every emotion and thought that he usually kept so quiet.
"Of course they are. What did you think had happened to them? Are you going to keep running all over town or are you going to get in there?”
Harry was quiet. Draco could not bear to look at him. He should offer some sort of explanation. Or leave. He shouldn’t leave the burden of response on Potter.
Harry started pacing the rows, striving to keep his voice even. It was no good shouting at them again. "My fourth Defense professor was actually a Death Eater. It took the whole school most of the year to notice that he wasn't the person he was pretending to be, and in that time, he did a lot of harm. I want you all to be able to recognize when--
“Fancies you,” Hermione finished, slowly and deliberately. “Which he finally decided he could tell Ron and me during the holidays.”
As Harry prepared to go, he looked around the room. He'd gotten used to this place, to the non-magic surface of things and the magic hidden just below. It seemed right. It still wasn't a place that he was comfortable. He felt nervous about coming here and facing Healer Goodnight every single week. But he'd done it enough times now that he was getting used to this. Maybe that was part of not being a ghost: getting used to new things, finding new ways to tie himself to life.
This was bad. This made it even more important to not get out of bed and face Potter at the moment. Only--he brushed the curtains out of his way and squinted through the darkness. Neville was holding weak wandlight in front of himself and feeling his way across the room.
"Hmm?" the girl said. "That was one of your schoolmates, right? The girl who works with Harry at the children's home?"
"And it's not even Alana's fault. But she. pukes. everywhere. I have taken her to healers four times to see if there's something wrong, and they said this is normal. How is this normal?"
You said you're always double-checking that things are real, and I thought about how real you feel. How real you make me feel. Being with you doesn't feel like an escape to some fairy-tale world where everything is perfect. I don't want it to be. I like being with you because you're sharp and smart and you ground me.
There was silence for a long moment. Harry turned off the lights and climbed back into his bed. “Malfoy. Why won’t you teach the eighth years Occlumency? They need it just as much as the first years. Maybe more.”
“Sam doesn’t even like me,” Draco muttered. “They made that very clear from the beginning.” He turned a page in his book to make it seem like he was still studying.
Another Gryffindor piped up. “You did it to get Mr. Potter out of the room, I bet. So you could use your dark magic on us!” She held her wand grimly, pointed towards Draco.
Draco didn’t say anything. He couldn’t even think of the words to say what was playing through his mind right now. Slytherin prank wars and snowball fights. Slytherin cram sessions before finals. There had been ugliness beyond the telling, but the green and silver warm haven in the stone dungeons had been
The water was such a shock of cold that he almost forgot what he'd jumped in to do. His arms and legs felt locked down to his side, but his hand brushed against something soft and stringy. Hair. He forced his eyes open and caught sight of the girl who'd fallen into the river. Her face was pale and looked nearly green in the strange underwater light, and her hair was waving out from her head along with the current. A thin stream of bubbles escaped her nose.
Harry writhed in his chair, and Draco found he couldn’t look away. Harry wasn’t just uncomfortable, he was approaching miserable. “I thought I finally had a reason to believe that Malfoy liked me...back.”
"And I'm going to say one more thing, for good measure: The world is a better place because you're alive in it. I'm glad you're here."
Draco had poked his head out of the back room and said, "Fred and George will be in at eight if you want to come back and whinge then."
Draco thought of his old wand, tucked into the chest at the end of his bed. What was his first non-class spell going to be? He’d clean his teeth with magic tonight. He’d be able to cast an Impervious around his head if it was snowing on their walk home. He would never be able to cast another patronus in front of other living creatures for as long as he lived, but he shouldn’t need to, now.
In fact, he did stay quiet as one by one, the others lost interest and started heading off toward their rooms. Pansy rolled off to bed, and once they’d made it to 100 things, Hermione ended the spell that had been recording their list, and she left. Finnegan and Thomas’s conversation escalated into something that involved their bodies more and their mouths less, and they left. Draco’s mind had been wandering, but he jerked back to the present when Potter said, “Just you and me left.”
Sam raised a hand. "Most potions wear off after a while. That's what Madame Pomfrey told me. If you don't have daily or even hourly access to the potion you're taking, it won't last."
Potter frowned, then drew a wand. He didn’t speak the spell, but a second later, Draco could see him in the sitting room of his mind.
George snatched the paper out of Draco's hands. "Lockhart's Laughs is right. If he thinks he can use Harry against us, he's a fool."
“McGonagall thought that since so many of us have already been teaching each other defense, fifth year and last year, that this could be an independent study. Sort of. We all have a lot of experiences with the dark arts. More than most people who could be our instructor. So they left it up to me to create a curriculum and they said we could have guests come in if needed but...”
Harry grinned and tugged on Draco's arm, since he was getting slow. It wasn't just about beating Draco, it was about being a part of the team. It was about the people in the stands, craning their necks and screaming when he did something dangerous on his broom. It was about his favorite thing at Hogwarts, something he was good at that was untouched by all the Dark Arts. But for today it would be enough to be part of the screaming stands, cheering for Gryffindor to take the cup.
Sam’s eyes narrowed into slits as Draco stumbled through an explanation of why Occlumency was important. Potter swaggered up to the front of the room. “Do you want me to describe what it’s like in your head again?”
"Potter?’ Draco swallowed. “You know me. Draco Malfoy? We met in Madame Malkin's when we were eleven and always got into rows at school--”
Ron cleared his throat. “Listen, I better follow him and see if he’s alright. That was a bit weird. I’m sure Pansy will want to hear about
Harry strode around the room, lifting his chin so that he was looking down at everything. "What a mess," he observed in the poshest voice he could manage. "These Gryffindors are always leaving their robes everywhere." He flicked at his own robe, hitching a sneer on this face.
It was Sam, who had stopped openly accusing Draco of trying to spy on their minds for the Dark Lord but never stopped watching Draco during lessons. Sam had certainly never run up and touched him.
Hermione frowned. “Oh, Ron. Don’t sulk about it. I never meant that you were supposed to be those things.”
Their probation dictated that the two were required to attend their final year of Hogwarts. Draco could only imagine how many parents were keeping their children home to shield them from Death Eaters Pansy Parkinson and Draco Malfoy.
“Researching what?” Pansy, ever the nosy one, grabbed the book from him and scanned the title. “Collected Legal Briefs on the Restriction of Magic? Boring.”
Draco looked at Potter to see if any of this was sinking in, and all he could see was that he’d taken the wrong tack. Harry now had the look of someone watching a puppy drown.
Potter’s blush deepened. “I thought it was sort of...obvious. I had all those dreams earlier this year where I woke up calling for you, and then engineered that whole, “help me teach the first years” thing, and then invited you to my mate’s for the holidays. I figured, if you weren’t acknowledging it, it was because you didn’t want anything to do with me.”
"Is to wait," Draco-as-Harry added, grinning as his hair paled and flattened. Harry looked away. The transformation was uncomfortable to watch, and it was much more entertaining to watch the expressions on the students' faces as they looked on in horror.
"Professor Potter?" Harry startled and looked back at the class. "You didn't finish giving the instructions."
Harry’s eyes sought Draco’s even as the wall suddenly became the focus of all Draco’s attention. “This is so stupid,” Harry growled. “I think it’s this room, too. It feels heavy. It feels like you’re not safe here.”
“Can’t tell if you’re worried for me,” she said, taking a buttered roll hesitantly. “Which is unnecessary. Or jealous, which is typical.”
Draco had been offended. When it came to his hatred for Potter, there was no burden too great. “Hardly! Can you imagine the look on his face when he sees these? He’ll be spitting slugs!”
"You've got to help me, Mr. Lockhart. I don't care what happens to me. I'll quit working there, if that's what you want. You'll never see me on Diagon Alley again. But the kids worked so hard for this." The kids, and the Weasleys, and Potter. None of them deserved to be punished because Draco couldn’t walk down a street properly.
“Yes. It’s fading.” Harry's eyes opened, sharp and on guard. It was another expression that Draco knew well. “Why?”
"Very well, Potter. I think it's a very wise decision you're making. And Mister Malfoy, welcome to the Hogwarts staff. I'll have Professor Slughorn speak with you about visiting some of his classes with the younger students and discussing the curriculum and texts used."
But of course it couldn’t be that simple. The snitch dropped, falling past Ginny’s ear and over Percy’s hair. Draco urged his broom into a dive. The few inches he’d still had on Harry were melting away, but the glittering orb had pulled up short a few yards from the ground. If he could get the angle right--he stretched forward, feeling the slight wobble of his broom beneath him. Harry wasn’t even reaching yet. This was it, this was finally going to be his victory. One final stretch--
“Maybe I do. Maybe that’s what makes it worth it. That I can make everyone listen when it’s something like this.”
Ron laughed, pushing the door all the way open and leading Hermione and Potter in after him. “Nice try, Draco. You’re going to have to do better than that if you want to get rid of us.”
“What if they never get another teacher who teaches them what they need? What if their next teacher is the one they need to defend themselves from?”
“Certainly stokes one’s ego to know all the first years can do a spell I still can’t manage.” Draco hadn’t meant to say the words aloud. Or perhaps he had, because he was watching for a reaction from Potter. It was satisfying to see Potter fumbling for words. Draco turned and made for the door, but before he could get away, Potter found his voice.
Draco poured himself a glass of water and gathered up the shreds of his composure. “The first year was just thanking me for the lessons I’ve been doing in Potter’s defense class.” He was pleased at how offhand his voice came off, and that he had yet to make eye contact with either of the Gryffindors.
“Disgusting,” Malfoy spat. “As if I would ever--I can’t believe you lot have dragged me into such a--you all better stay away from me. Especially you, Potter.”
"Wow, there's a cake," Harry observed. And so there was--a perfectly iced cake sat in the middle of the table between the five of them.
This was really good. Harry looked at the expression on Draco's face, which was clearly trying to be calm and collected, but was actually sparking with energy. "But, Headmistress," Draco said before she could shepherd him out the door. "You never mentioned Lacey. If I've got the position, is she going to be staying here?"
“Seriously?” Pansy frowned. “You two hardly left the library all weekend! It’s our last term at Hogwarts. Don’t we deserve to have some fun?”
He always felt a bit flustered working with any of the fantasy line of products. He knew every person saw something different when they looked at the packaging. George made no secret of the fact that all his fantasies still revolved around Angelina Johnson, for instance. But Draco couldn't help worrying that Fred and George especially, as the creators of the products, would be able to see what he saw whenever he picked up the Daydream products.
Potter reached into his robe and pulled out a wand. No, not just a wand--his wand. “I didn’t know how to give you this.”
Harry found himself staring out the window in class again. Merlin, it looked so peaceful out on the grounds. The sun was shining, the long slope of the hill down to the Forbidden Forest was alive with green, and a thestral was swooping over the treetops on the horizon. If only he could be out there--
He didn’t even look to see who had spoken, just kept rearranging his parchments. “It seems that way.”

In the dark, with Potter’s voice soft for once, instead of demanding, Draco wanted to be honest  with him. “Alright Potter. You’ve seen everything I’ve done with the first years. You’ve had a chance to practice it. Should I come into your mind and take a look around?”
