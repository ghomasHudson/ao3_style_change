Draco’s stomach churned with jealousy, which overwhelmed him immediately after with shock—he knew there was another Veela, so why was he suddenly so annoyed? And in the turbulent mess of emotion, he almost missed the obvious question. Fortunately, his brain was still working.
Draco sighed, and then forced himself to ask what he really didn’t want to ask. “You do know that the Veela Curse doesn’t usually bind the wizard to the territorial Veela, don’t you, Potter? It chooses another.”
Potter’s eyes fell to Draco’s waist, where Draco could feel droplets of water sliding down his rapidly cooling torso, and he visibly swallowed. Draco allowed himself one small moment to imagine striding across the room, gripping Potter by the back of the neck and kissing him stupid. He could imagine the sounds Potter would make—the shocked gasp, the moan when Draco’s towel fell to the ground, the eager slide of their tongues together as they panted into each other’s mouths.
But it didn’t make sense. It wasn’t only showing their darkest memories but their happiest as well. Scene after scene flittered past: Draco as a child, laughing with his parents; Morgan and Kalen running through the forest; Potter opening presents at Christmas. It began to feel as though Draco couldn’t possibly exist with all these sides to him. How could he be strong when he had been so weak? How could he be at peace when his life was paved with such tragedy? And yet, there he was—there they all were—memory after memory, broken one moment and happy the next. It didn’t make sense, and it felt like it was tearing him apart.
Pansy rolled her eyes. “As if these two could ever have an honest to Merlin relationship. Even if they try to fake it, they wouldn’t last. And in the bizarre likelihood they do pull it off, I won’t make it an even split, Weasley. I’m not that awful.”
magic. It’s why we use hair and feathers as wand cores rather than blood. We don’t need it. When Veela blood takes hold…” He swallowed. “It feels raw. Not even like you’re on fire—like you
As the dream swirled around him, soothing him, healing him with the joyous possibility of a life he could have lived, Draco slowly woke up.
Draco drew back sharply. “You make it sound like Potter’s a burden. He has no idea what affect his moods have on me and the people around him, and he is entirely unaware that I’m trying to help—”
It was smoother, this time, waking up in a seated position instead of slumped over on the cold floor. His limbs were still stiff, but they lacked the dull ache of injury. With a start, he realised he had slipped into a relaxed lean against Potter, and he pulled himself upright before it became obvious.
The way Potter said it, it sounded so matter-of-fact, almost peaceful. Like lancing a wound. But Draco knew better.
, to do, to be, in a way that he hadn’t ever before. He felt that, and he felt something else too. He had an awareness of the need to slow down, to listen, to feel.
He felt something for Potter, felt something for a man who was deeply, undeniably, troubled. A man who was pretending to love him, and who desperately needed love himself—whether he knew it or not.
Draco slammed shields down around the four of them while Potter sent a flurry of unknown charms settling around George. For a moment, the room shimmered with an iridescent white light. It was beautiful, filling Draco with a sense of peace and longing. Without knowing why, he began to walk towards the box. He could feel Potter beside him, moving as if in a trance, while a distant part of him noticed that Morgan had frozen very still.
Potter reclined in his chair, watching him, and since he clearly wasn’t going to give up and leave it alone, Draco sighed and dropped into the chair opposite, pouring them both a glass of wine from the bottle he’d already set out. “Blaise has acquired two new peacocks for the Sanctuary.”
“You think I’m falling for him.” The words sounded oddly distant, like they were said by someone else.
Harry wakes, slowly, to the sound of movement in the kitchen downstairs. By the time the last remnants of sleep have fallen away, he already has a smile on his face. For someone who spent most of his formative years waking up in a cold sweat, or curled so tightly into a defensive ball that he didn’t even know the sun had risen, it’s a feat that leaves him just a little shocked, even though it happens all the time now.
“I have… wronged people, Potter. And since I am at least partially a creature of fate, Fate demands the debt be paid.” The room had descended into a strange sort of trance, with Potter listening intently, blue flames flickering in his eyes behind a very human—and wholly impossible—expression. “I tried paying it in person, but it seems it is not enough to offer reparations. They must also be accepted.” He shrugged. “And no one would accept mine. So, when the misfortune hitting me in life is too neat to be coincidence, I recognise it for what it is: Fate demanding payment.”
Potter shook his head, careful and oh so certain. “Ten years, Draco. The curse waited ten years until we were ready to be soulmates. It doesn’t want to kill us; it wants to save us.”
“Do you really think that little of me?” Potter asked suddenly, and Draco’s breath caught in his throat.
Everything was fine; he would make sure of it. He’d get the help he needed, come to Blaise when he had to, and make sure Potter got through this.
Potter threw back his head and laughed—a rich, open sound that made several heads turn their way. Draco tried to bite down on the smile that came in response, but it was like trying to hold back the tide.
Potter’s fingers slid against him, firm between the cleft of his thighs. Every time they passed over him, they would press a little deeper until Potter was knuckle deep inside him and Draco was writhing against the cold wall. Any thoughts of trying to salvage their relationship into something verging on healthy disappeared; if it was healthy, he wouldn’t have
Potter moaned, pressing forward into Draco’s mouth, into the lips that caressed him, licking him over and over until he was begging for something more.
Weasley’s voice scoffed in response. “When do you not fall head first into the middle of things? You’re Harry Potter; it’s what you do.”
“—assumed that’s why you added the second core to yours and your father’s wands. So you could bring some of the Veela Divination mastery into your spellwork and help Voldemort with his prophecy obsession.” Potter shrugged.
“While you’ve already proven you don’t need it, yes, you have my permission. Just watch out for Igrelda. She bites.”
Draco remembered the night at the Leaky, where he had finally known what it felt like to be a part of that strange Gryffindor camaraderie, and wondered if he would ever get that back.
“Ah,” Malfoy nodded. “So this is a performance piece then? Day in the life of a toddler, perhaps? Very good. Where’s your collection tin? I’ll give you a knut.” He emphasised the last word.
“Yeah. I caught her whispering to the other attendant when we were leaving, pointing our way. Might even get something in the
“I’m just saying, you’re treating it like a transaction.” Potter stared at him, jaw tight, guilt and anger spreading across his face. “Are you even sorry? Or do you just want Fate off your back?”
“Why do you want to win this bet?” he asked suddenly, when they were reclined back in their armchairs and half asleep. “I know you want to get one up over the other three, but it’s getting a bit complicated, don’t you think? Don’t get me wrong—I’d love to get Pansy back with a prank as much as the next person, but I think it’s going to take a lot more effort than we initially thought.”
Then she winked at him and Apparated away. He stared at the empty space she left behind for long moments, and then fired off another spell. The golden lights lit up the sky as far as the eye could see, full of blues and reds and a startling green that coursed through it all like a snake. He let his head fall back against the cool concrete of the roof and laughed.
. Then, in a deft maneuver with which he was well-practiced, he pushed the thought aside and opened the door.
Still, the idea lingered with Draco long after Pansy had gone home and he was left in the quiet of the Manor. He remembered lonely nights of walking these halls, unable to sleep even in the years before the Dark Lord had taken over everything. He remembered wicked dreams and forbidden fantasies.
Pansy bit her lip. “I know,” she admitted. “I let you win because I could see that, whatever else it was, it was real.” She ran her hands through her hair in frustration. “I wish I’d never made that stupid bet, at least not with that wording. Who are any of us to judge your relationship, Draco? We don’t know what you’re going through. I guess I hoped that by bringing it out into the light, it might… I don’t know… encourage you to make it into something healthy? I’ll admit that doesn’t make much sense. I just didn’t want you to keep going for the sake of the bet. You were trying to fake a relationship for the sake of people who weren’t even involved in it; that should have been a red flag right from the start. Relationships are deeply personal, but this one was all about trying to fit some arbitrary mold made by everyone else. I’m willing to bet you hadn’t even thought about what a relationship might look like to each of you, which means that even if it became real—even
Draco closed his eyes. “It didn’t say anything about the final stage. But my book… it said stage three witnesses the final judgment. But there is no judgment. I don’t understand.”
“We—that was—I mean—” he spluttered as Harry picked his jaw up off the ground for the second time that afternoon and Neville half-laughed and nervous-gasped at the same time, nearly choking on his tongue.
Harry stopped dressing and stood up, his shirt still hanging loose and every other inch of him on display. He put his hands around Draco’s waist and pulled him closer so he could rest his forehead against Draco’s shoulder.
Potter didn’t seem fussed at all that he no longer had an audience. Perhaps this wasn’t for show. He grinned at Draco.
He wasn’t sure how to properly convince them that he was going to go after Potter and fix this. How on earth could you come back from an argument like that?
“So you want to pretend we’re pretending to fall in love, and then pretend to fall in love along the way,” Potter summarised, smirking a little into his glass.
“You’re worrying over nothing, Pansy,” he said as seriously as he could manage. “I’m not obsessing over Potter, and I’m not about to start just because the idiot has proven he gets a little cranky from time to time. We’ve always known that; it’s nothing new.”
He leaned back into the softness of the chaise and studied the party. It seemed to be going well, but Pansy’s parties always did. He would see her for perhaps a collective five minutes at one of these things—otherwise she was too busy mingling with people she didn’t get a chance to see for months at a time. He thought he’d spotted her by the salad table at one point, but by the time he’d looked back she was already gone.
“What kind of scene?” Potter leered at him, the anger melting away to leave heat in its place. “I mean, if you’re offering. If I’m going to cause a scene, there might as well be something in it for me.”
He intended for the act to look as respectful and courteous as possible—it was the whole purpose of the exercise—but he was too distracted by the conversation. He ended up holding the door open but glaring at Potter as he went through.
He was hard again before long, and he could feel from the way Malfoy carefully tried to avoid brushing against him that he was, too. His hands fell to Malfoy’s chest, to his stomach, to his hips, and he hovered there, nervous but eager for more.
He heard his name, but he didn’t recognise the voice that said it. It sounded like Potter, but all the roughness and grit were gone from his tone, and besides, Potter didn’t call him Draco.
“There’s no point wasting time,” he said, his eyes flicking to the closed door of his work room where complicated symbols etched in red chalk flickered faintly on the wood.
Everything shifted—strange and unreal—and then Draco was in Potter’s arms, the water cascading over them as they kissed each other with an urgency that left Draco breathless and weak. They fought for control, wrestling each other against the slippery walls. Potter won, pinning Draco beneath the shower head by his wrists. Draco might have let him win.
When they remained unfrozen after a few minutes, Harry concluded they were safe. For now. It could still lie dormant.
And now that he’s here, in Alice Springs, he finds himself meandering towards the coast, Apparition point by Apparition point, drawn to the call of the sea. Giant jellyfish be damned. He wants to catch a wave, to chill out in a beer garden by the beach, to sunbake on white sands—not this red outback dust that seems to seep into every orifice with a determination bordering on sentience. He wants to see what passes for a bustling city in Australia, and he’s fairly certain he won’t found that out here.
When Draco turned to him, all the glib, dismissive banter that had marked their previous interactions had gone; even the familiar competitiveness was absent. He had no idea how he hadn’t noticed the rage before. Had Potter hidden it that well, or was Draco truly that much of an idiot?
Malfoy waved a hand at the artefacts on the other side of the balcony. “This. All of it. I give…” he laughed humorlessly, a breathless chuckle Harry almost couldn't hear, “so much of a shit, Potter, you don’t even know.”
He’d just come from an incredibly dry and vicious seminar about the theory of Transfiguration that had lasted five long, ghastly hours, when he stumbled across yet another couple. This time, with the rules of intent when intending to perform a Transfiguration still ringing in his ears, Harry didn’t have the energy to be mortified.
The amulet twirled in Potter’s fingers, catching the light. It was such a gentle illumination here, in this room, and Draco realise with a sudden startled clarity that he had remembered bits of it last night; namely, the way that Potter’s eyes looked when they watched him.
He blew the dust into the wall and watched as a complex line of gears lit up with a gently pulsating blue light. With a wave of his wand, the echo of the mechanisms they’d already discovered began to glow softly, so that the light reflected back on them was a curious mix of blue, purple, green, and pink, shimmering softly like sunlight bouncing off water.
“We have to stop meeting like this,” he muttered, before he woke up a little more and remembered that he hated Potter.
Potter shrugged. “I just—” He stopped, Quaffle poised above his shoulder. “Don’t you ever feel lost out here, all on your own? You’ve only got yourself for company.”
Blaise was right; he needed to be smart about this. He needed to talk to someone—a therapist or something—and start getting things in motion for the time that Potter was ready to take action. He needed to do this for Potter… and for himself.
“And it would have,” Draco agreed. “Except that Unicorn hair cores are the only Supreme Core that know how to ask for help. Why don’t you take a leaf from their book, Potter, and get to the point?”
“It isn’t enough for you to rely on the law to influence people’s behavior. You want them to understand what their prejudice does. You want them to see that there is a face to the half-blood child they so despise—a tear-stricken, terrified face that deserves
Slowly, he edged out of his seat and made his way out the front door, down the path towards the gate. When he’d bought the Sanctuary, he’d made sure to purchase a property as far from the Manor in style and feel as possible. As such, his land was bordered with a white picket fence, the gate neatly latched with iron hardware. He kept it oiled because he couldn’t stand the squeak.
Harry’s fingers dug into the wood of the table and he pushed back into Draco, whimpering as his cock began to pulse, and then he was coming. Draco pushed up his shirt and trailed kisses down his back, thrusting slowly as Harry came down from his orgasm, and then he couldn’t hold back any more. He gripped Harry’s hips and pushed in faster, harder, until he was spilling over too.
“Well, why don’t I feel any different, then?” Potter asked, sounding so genuinely lost Draco nearly opened his eyes.
“It sounds like we’re close to the end, then?” Potter asked before Draco could offer to get them hot chocolate or tea.
Even as he continues to thrust, unable to look away from the eager desire in Malfoy’s eyes, he promises himself he will never do this again. Malfoy’s lips are slick with his own saliva now, the quick slide of his head as he bobs on Harry’s cock becoming sloppy, impatient. He pulls his hand away, both hands now resting on Harry’s hips, and closes his eyes. It is so clear that he is giving himself over to it, to the taste and feel of Harry’s cock, that Harry quickly feels his balls begin to tighten, his orgasm rushing upon him.
“Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck,” he growled and came, spurting white stripes up his chest and clenching tightly down on Harry’s fingers.
This much was true. He kept getting problems with local teenage wizards breaking into his backyard and egging his house. He didn’t particularly care; he usually just egged them back.
Draco felt a little like he had to suspend disbelief just to understand how this conversation was managing to stay so civil.
“Malfoys have always derived our true power from peacock feathers,” Draco admitted softly, the confession filling the space between them like a sigh.
At that, Potter frowned. He seemed to be warring with something internally, but he only said, “What’s the curse reparation for?”
Something is wrong with Draco. Harry knows it that morning when the sounds coming from the kitchen aren’t the quiet, content sounds of their normal routine; they’re the harried sounds of someone under stress. He tip-toes down the stairs and hovers in the doorway, watching as Draco throws together their breakfasts while hardly looking at what he’s doing. He pauses in front of Harry’s tea for several minutes, before throwing the teabag in the mug and walking away.
A sound like a sigh came from the other bed, and then he heard Malfoy rolling over—presumably to face him.
They blinked at each other in the wake of his statement. When it became clear that he wasn’t going to say anything more, Ron made a face.
have taught us? I had his annotated textbook, for Merlin’s sake. He deliberately taught us badly just so he could make sure he still held the power.”
“I haven’t a clue what you mean,” he said and was relieved to hear it came out just as insulted and angry as he intended it to.
The gentle kisses they had been trading gave way to something rougher as Potter began to take him apart. He pulled Draco’s shirt over his head without even bothering with the buttons and vanished his trousers with a wave of his wand. Then, he dropped his head to Draco’s neck, kissing and biting while Draco tried futilely to drag Potter’s leather jacket off.
“We can’t keep on like this,” Draco said slowly. “Not out there, but certainly not in here—we’re going to get ourselves killed.”
The only problem was that by opening the box, they would alter the state of the curse. The carefully maintained and isolated environment that the identification spell relied on would be ruined, and it would be too dangerous for them to re-enter the Ether and conclude their study. They would no longer be able to complete the identification spell and unravel the curse, which meant that the wards around the Pensieve wouldn’t deactivate.
“When I looked at you, though,” Potter continued suddenly, standing straighter, “that’s when I knew. I feel whole when I’m with you.”
So, months later, when Draco arrived home one night and found a letter waiting for him in a familiar hand, his heart skipped a beat.
So when the niggling thought arose that he should leave the country for a while, he’d decided to take a short stay in Australia on the priviso that it be on the lowest of downs. The absolutely pinnacle of secrecy. He even debated not telling Ron, but at the last minute had decided that if he got eaten by a giant jellyfish—he was certain Australia had those—he should make sure at least one person knew where to hunt for the body.
Potter looked up at him, one eyebrow raised, from his perfectly innocent position on the floor, sitting on his leather jacket for comfort. “Something wrong, Malfoy?”
instead of to St Mungo’s, Draco’s best bet was to get the man stabilised before deciding anything further.
“Lots of reasons. I don’t really want to have to sneak around to meet you. It would also stop Ron and Neville from just barging in whenever they want. They might actually learn to knock. If we’re doing this, I don’t want to have to hide it. I’m not ashamed of what I am or this. If we’re going to keep seeing each other after this is over—”
“It doesn’t seem happy to share,” Draco said incredulously. “Are all their cleaning products like this? I’ve never seen it before in my life.”
When he put it like that, it sounded perfectly stupid. Harry had never known Malfoy to take his feelings into account when he said anything. At least, not in a positive way. There’d been the whole thing with the dementors in third year just
“What?” he squeaked when he’d managed to recover. How the hell had they known? He hadn’t looked any different in the mirror since his encounter with Malfoy the other day. It wasn’t like there was a flashing sign over his head that read “NOT STRICTLY A VIRGIN ANYMORE”. It didn’t work that way, did it? He hadn’t known for months when Ron and Hermione had given theirs up. “How—when—I—”
“I have been the pillar of polite conversation, considering our circumstances.” Draco was affronted.
Draco nodded, raising one eyebrow in a little dare that Harry found stupidly sexy. “Well, then,” he said lamely.
, and he wasn’t going to change that just because certain Gryffindors had unreasonable expectations about the way that people should act in public.
“Why bother? The judgement has been passed.” Draco moved into the room, eying the pile of books on the desk. “Is that why I’m here? I presume they contain information on the inhibitor.”
No. That wasn’t what Potter had said. He’d said that Weasley had a biased view—that Weasley would view him in a way that was different to how the rest of the world saw him. Kinder. Rose-tinted.
The guest chambers were also the kind of environment that McGonagall had begrudgingly, after much whinging and many tears, agreed to allow his bubotubers to have. Consequently, Harry had been displaced from the nice, cushy single room he’d been assigned and re-placed in a cramped six-bed dorm room with Malfoy standing on the other side of the door.
He wondered whether to tell Potter what his friends had said about him but decided against it. There was a tiny part of him that urged caution right now. Something wasn’t right, and it was never smart to reveal one’s hand too early.
So he didn’t expect anything when Potter asked him to meet at the little coffee shop on the corner; after all, they went there several times a week. He didn’t think anything of it when Potter was already there, waiting, a bag of pastries in his hand and two steaming ceramic mugs of coffee balanced on the edge of the counter. Potter knew his order; they’d been coming here for months.
“Draco.” Eleanor’s voice was warm, filled with genuine pleasure at the sight of him on the doorstep of her office. “It’s been years.”
“Fuck,” Harry breathed, clutching the sheets in two fists and fighting not to thrust into Malfoy’s mouth.
“I heard you worked on a large security breach case recently?” He was surprised he remembered that detail. Potter had only mentioned it in passing.
Personally, Harry couldn’t believe Malfoy was talking about Hermione in a non-depreciatory way. The same Hermione he’d had no trouble calling
He looked up to see a faint flush of pink rising on Potter’s cheeks. A slow sense of warmth began to spread through him, starting from his chest and blooming outward all the way to the tips of his fingers. He shook his head.
They talked well into the night. Before long, they weren’t even discussing the bet anymore—they were just talking. Part of Draco was singing in delight, reveling in finally having the attention of the famous Harry Potter. The other part of him—the part that was older and less eager for validation—was just enjoying himself.
“Oh!” Hermione said, her eyes widening. “When he wouldn’t stop winking and asking if we were using protection, you mean?”
“I didn’t know that’s how you felt,” Malfoy said, and he stood up. “All that Gryffindor rot is just a cover, isn’t it? There’s nothing noble about you, after all. You can’t even respect someone’s choices without making it all about you and how terribly difficult it is to wait, can you?”
It had taken him all year to work out what the cabinet was missing. A broken Vanishing Cabinet that Vanishes items into a state of perpetual limbo—he’d spent months looking at it from the wrong angle. He’d tried to repair the connection between the two, so that it stopped Vanishing things to the wrong place, but even once the connection was repaired it kept failing him.
Harry has tested the product before. He knows they’re safe, knows that the daydreams are perfectly within your control—they only ever manifest a scenario you completely consent to—and, even better, he kept a few of the testers aside for private use before the new line is approved and released.
Potter frowned. “It’s down to a sev four now, but it’s not pretty.” He lowered his voice. “I think they’re taking bribes.”
He smiled at Malfoy, warmth rushing through him at the relieved smile Malfoy returned. “Me too,” he admitted, feeling like he had somehow confessed something far more intimate.
to change course that it had finally started working again. Of course, that had meant enhancing the link between the pair so it was exciting and new, which didn’t exactly relate to Horcruxes.
It wasn’t that Potter was in love with him; Draco wasn’t so deluded as to believe that. There’d be signs. Draco wasn’t blind. The change had come over Potter when Draco had said they would go back to their old lives… like that was something to fear.
“I’m sorry,” Potter said quietly, so that only he could hear. “I think I’ve been a bit… difficult to get along with the last couple of days.”
Then the horror of the situation truly hit him, and he watched, numb, as George fell to his knees, hugged his dead twin, and sobbed.
drifts through the walls from some distant hotel room, or possibly the lobby. It’s a strange counterpoint to the seriousness of the conversation, but Harry supposes in many ways this entire trip has been a strange counterpoint. An island of escape from a life that was slowly strangling him. He was deluded to think it could ever last.
He took a few deep breaths, because the last thing he needed was the curse to infect him—not that it really mattered, he supposed, since it wasn’t a curse after all and Harry was summarily useless. Nonetheless. In… and out…
“All right.” He propped his chin on his fist and studied Potter carefully. “If we’re going to pull this off, we’re going to need some guidelines.”
“If you’re going back, I’ll leave as well,” Harry admits. “I think it’s time I accepted this is just my life. It’s only taken me twenty years.”
The silence overwhelmed them, sick with disbelief and inevitability. Harry let it. Sometimes, you just had to let it.
“He’ll be fine in a day or two,” Granger went on, reaching across the table and patting Draco’s hand. “You’ve just never seen it before. He’ll hardly even remember what he said.”
Harry wasn’t sure what it said about certain social constructs that after all their experimenting, all their research and careful dismantling of their virginity, the most open and vulnerable he’d felt so far was when he fell asleep that night in Malfoy’s arms.
Draco rolled his eyes. “You’d know, Potter. Anything that happens to your body out there happens in here, and vice versa.”
He was just about to get up from the table and retreat when Ron spoke, almost reluctant, but relentingly, “I reckon you’d know best, living with him.”
“An excellent point, though I’m a little worried it was even an option. Yes, you’re right—the first rule is not to fly straight at anyone. The charms are strong and the ground is soft, but it’s not a good habit to get into. What you want to do is fly
“Merlin,” Draco breathed, standing and Accioing his own coat as well. “Can I help? Do you need me to get anyone?”
As he thought the word, the dream folded around him like the warm haze of a cozy fire, and someone began to speak.
Potter’s eyes slid away for a second, nervous. “I had to research quite a lot when I was isolating the Horcrux. I didn’t understand what I was reading until I was halfway through, and then I couldn’t stop. I hadn’t known they’d seized it from you—I would never have guessed they’d taken it and refused to give it back.”
“Weird,” was what Malfoy said. He’d begun to wank himself. Harry realised he’d started going soft, which was strange for him because he couldn’t have been harder.
Draco realised, abruptly, that the anger he kept seeing in Potter was completely gone as well. He actually looked happy.
As soon as Potter said the words, it was obvious. Of course this was the curse—it had to monitor them somehow, and since this was a blood curse, it made sense that it would appear as his Veela ancestor. It watched them with golden eyes half-hidden in shadow, as alive as the two wizards on the couch, and clicked its beak.
As the days went by, Draco established a sort of routine. Twice a week, he met with Eleanor. They took things slowly, working within the boundaries that Draco set. It was different to the therapy sessions he’d been to before. At that time in his life, he’d been working just to cope, just to get through each day without falling apart. He recalled times where he’d fallen to the ground, clutching in on himself, because a session had been cancelled and he didn’t know what he was going to do, how he was going to get by.
“And ability,” Malfoy spat acidly, all sharp edges. “And determination. And sheer bloody tenacity. We’ve got a damn sight more than trust up our sleeves. You didn’t defeat Voldemort with thoughts and prayers.”
Somehow, together, they had found a kind of peace out there in the Muggle world, pretending that everything was far behind them, when truthfully the war was as much a part of them as their skin, their lungs, their heart. It always would be. But when the music played, they could throw themselves into it and laugh and drink, and most of the time the rest would fade away.
“We’ve done all we can,” Malfoy said, finally easing enough to agree with him. “It’s up to her now.”
There was just something about Potter that managed to rile Draco up like nothing else, and it didn’t help that he’d only gotten hotter since leaving Hogwarts. There was something uniquely infuriating about a man who had the audacity to walk around looking like sex on legs, whilst possessing the most intolerable personality Draco had ever had the misfortune to come across. Still, he supposed it was better than if Potter had both good looks and an attractive personality. At least this way, Draco remained mostly unbothered.
For a horrible minute, Harry was certain he’d just said the wrong thing and he would be accused of sympathising with the enemy or being insensitive and devaluing the traumas they’d all gone through in the war.
I told you that my home always felt like a cage. I didn’t tell you that when the war was over, the cage grew bigger. I don’t mean that it became easier to move around in or easier to ignore; I mean that the cage is everywhere. I can’t walk outside without feeling the walls closing in. I can’t talk to someone without worrying that they’re planning something against me, or that they’re not who they say they are. I can’t do anything without thinking, in the back of my mind, that somehow,
“What in Merlin’s name are you talking about?” Draco spat, shoving Potter backwards and trying to remember how to breathe.
“You coming up, then?” Harry asked, feeling awkward as he saw Neville and Ron turn toward them. “I think Seamus brought a couple of bottles with him.”
“It was last conducted successfully by the wizards Stanwart and Thaise, who braided together their magical signatures into an unrecognisable aura that slipped beneath the curse’s protective layer and dismantled it from within,” Potter interrupted, meeting Draco’s eyes while Draco gaped at him.
His eyes snapped open and he found Malfoy watching him, still lying so close that his breath was ghosting across Harry’s side.
Malfoy sat on the edge of his bed, propped back on his hands in a clear attempt to be casual. It wasn’t fooling anyone. Although… Harry looked around. No one else was really watching Malfoy, and Neville had even sat on the ground at the foot of his bed.
Draco scanned the crowd, feeling at an odd remove from the world around him. His small circle of friends weren’t here yet, and his only two choices were to mingle or to remain lost in his own thoughts. It was hardly a competition. This crowd looked about as entertaining as an evening with Binns. The only person he wanted to speak to—Blaise—was trapped in conversation with three adoring witches and had only managed a brief wave to Draco over the tops of their heads.
Of course, it was as bad as he had anticipated. Harry Potter stood within the Manor walls, and Draco could not believe that no one could identify him. How could they miss it? That scar, mangled by some kind of hex but clearly there. Those eyes.
Although not strange enough to distract him from the fact that Potter swallowed thickly when he heard the word
Harry’s heart stuttered, a rush of feeling overwhelming him with its unfamiliarity. In that eternal moment, he was volatile again, wild, everything he hadn’t felt in forever. He moaned, one hand reaching out to tangle in Malfoy’s hair as he did what he was told and thrust upward in slow, careful movements.
“Oh, just a bubble charm,” she muttered, running a hand through her hair and spinning around to examine all four corners of the shop. There was a faint note of hysteria in her eyes, but she was remaining calm on the outside. Draco was impressed. “I think I’ve removed everyone from the path of danger. Can you help me bring George out of the explosion?”
His hands stilled and he felt the blood drain from his face. He turned to Potter and watched as understanding crossed his features.
It was the first time they had approached anything close to a civil conversation since yesterday, and he felt the strangest sensation that he didn’t want to mess it up. He recalled George’s words from last night, and the painful certainty that he’d ruined it all—whatever
He looked up at the incredulity in Potter’s tone. “Sick. You’re sick. What came over you was a dissociative state so strong that you became fucking catatonic.”
The voice was childish and unfamiliar, and in that moment Harry understood far more than he wanted to. With a heavy heart, he rose, shoes like lead, and walked out to the balcony where the tracking instrument had never been packed away. Wind tugged at his hair as he stared down at it.
Potter shrugged, dark circles rimming his eyes, and the anger was back but it was as tired as Draco felt. He stepped into line beside him.
It was too real. Everything Potter said and did sank beneath Draco’s skin like an anchor, and the worst part of it all was that every word was fake. Draco swallowed, forced himself to drag his eyes away from Potter, and nodded.
“Do you think of me when you go home?” Malfoy’s gaze was intense, so there was no possibility of Harry mistaking his meaning.
For an uncharacteristically long moment, she didn’t say anything, and then she smiled a tentative smile.
He kept catching Potter’s eyes flicking towards it as well, but neither of them said anything out loud. There was so much between them, Draco didn’t even know where to begin. He knew that things had been tense between them over the last few days, and not only out of anger, but the very idea that they had somehow acted on that filled him with confusion. It felt like it belonged to another person, another Draco—one who wasn’t so fantastically skilled at building walls and terribly inept at tearing them down.
“Let me guess: you’ll line your love nest and be on your way.” Draco would confess to being the Veela soon. When Potter brought in the feathers.
“I wouldn’t have thought you were the kind of man to choose bespoke furniture.” His eyes flitted up to the artwork above the chaise. “Or art—any kind of art.”
“Because,” Draco said drily, looking up at him like he was explaining something very simple to a young child. “My wand’s core is a unicorn hair. Do you know why unicorn hair is so sought after in potions and transfiguration?”
One by one, a series of wheels lit up with a gentle, purple light until they were surrounded by an undulating strip of purple on all four walls.
He shuts the gate behind him, still chewing on the sweet, and races up the steps to Grimmauld Place. When he reaches for the handle, he swallows and takes a moment to compose himself: eyes closed, a slight tremor to his hand that he wishes he was imagining. Then, he opens the door and steps inside.
Draco made a little grunting sound as he bottomed out, and flexed his hips, sending spasms of sensation through Harry that made him shudder and breathe heavily.
“Nah, it’s all right, mate,” Ron insisted, talking over Potter a little. “Mum’s bringing me something, and you know how she is. It’ll be so much I’ll probably have to share it with the whole ward or something.”
His voice came out softer than usual, tinged with empathy rather than the cutting edge of pity. Something warm kindled in Draco’s chest, and he changed the subject before he could be foolish enough to enjoy it.
Pansy waved a hand. “You’re off the hook. And besides, look at them!” She nodded in their direction. “They’ve made some half-arsed attempt at trickery and expected it to work. Even if they put all their effort into convincing us, they’re still going to fall through because you can’t fake that sort of thing.” She broke up into hysterical laughter. “And can you imagine that?”
After a painful few seconds of overly-genial goodbyes, Miles left them to it. When Draco turned back to Potter, the expression that met him was dark and brooding.
“I can’t change the past, but I’m offering you my hand now,” Potter said, growing very still as something caught his attention.
“For me, either,” he said placidly and flipped the page to a diagram of a toy that looked like a fancy letter T, but upside down. One end was fashioned like a fancy teacup handle.
Potter gave him a small smile, something hidden in it that Draco didn’t know how to read, and before he could think it through, he asked, “Has the curse made you remember me as well?”
He heard a choking sound from beside him, and when he looked over, Potter’s eyes were wide. Draco even felt a little stunned, himself.
Draco read and reread the message so many times, he was certain that Potter was asleep by the time he finally got a new piece of parchment ready.
“I don’t think you do, Draco,” Pansy insisted. “You think that you did something stupid, or wrong, and that you should have known better. But that’s not the case. Things
Harry shrugged. “Personally, I’ve always found relief in accepting things as they are.” He smiled wrily, and Draco realised then that Harry thought himself weak, for being relieved that Fate might make his hardest choices for him.
“I think it’s a fantastic idea.” He was closer now, his breath ghosting across Draco’s skin. “I think we could find a nice, quiet little corner, and I could show you exactly why I don’t want to waste time using my mouth for
Then, there was a fluttering in the corner of his eye, like fabric, and the scene changed. He closed his eyes and heard water dripping onto tiles. Darkness faded away as light filled the room, and he didn’t have to open his eyes to know where he was.
The Potter in his mind writhed against the ropes, arching away from the bed and begging Draco for more even as his eyes flashed in defiance.
“The wards are designed to keep unwanted people out, though,” he said quietly. “Their spells get reflected back before they ever reach your internal wards, and since they’re essentially impervious to magic, it makes the wards doubly hard to disentangle if you don’t know where the entry point is. You won’t have to worry about the pranks getting worse or becoming something more than just what kids do on a Friday night.”
“You said it, not me,” Draco complained, sitting up and staring at his front door from the wrong side of it. “Didn’t you say you wouldn’t remember this?”
Yes, the two dozen letters you sent to me over the last three days made it very clear that you’re in this for the long haul. Frankly, I must say I’m delighted to be given the opportunity to relive my childhood by being stalked by the Boy Wonder. I dare say my prolonged absence in writing was only indicative of the time I needed to quietly process such a prestigious honour.
“Of course not,” Draco snapped back. “But some parents are monsters who should be tarred and feathered at the very least; I don’t see why it’s made you withdraw into yourself like this. And I don’t understand why the Gryffindor hero didn’t go up to them and verbally rip their heads off.”
She was the only person specialising in medicinal herbs, and Harry could feel her panicking that she would somehow miss out on the value of cross-departmental knowledge.
“I’ve no idea what you mean,” he said airily. “We were after some potion ingredients; would you be able to help us?”
Groaning, Malfoy turned onto his side and sat up at the waist so that he was looking down on Harry. He didn’t look as smug as Harry might have expected him to. It made him feel hopeful that Malfoy wasn’t just in it for the one time, and that he wasn’t going to pretend none of it had happened. Instead, some of the vulnerability from earlier was back as he scrutinised Harry from his vantage point.
“There’s darkness in you,” she had said, crossing her legs to sit beside him and watch the stars. “That’s where the light comes from.”
Draco felt his knees give a little at the knowledge that they had done it, they had achieved something that was not only unusual in current theory, but that had quite possibly saved a life. Potter made a small noise beside him, but Draco politely ignored it.
“Everybody knows you support the Nundus since they signed Hedley. Come on: we’re already late for breakfast. Trust you to sleep through the start of our seminars,” Malfoy muttered at last. He gave Harry one last look and finally stepped away from the bed. Harry sank back down onto his pillows and blew out a long breath.
“Because magic comes from the earth,” Potter said softly. “With your Veela blood, you’d know that. You’d know how that feels.”
Malfoy snorted, and Harry couldn’t help but open his eyes and stare, shocked that Malfoy could make a noise so carefree and ridiculous. Malfoy didn’t notice, too busy pulling on his pajamas and climbing into bed.
“I like you, too,” was all Draco said in response, and the small spark that had been growing since they’d really, properly started this thing with emotions and all blossomed into a warm ball in his chest.
“Yes. Fine. I’ll meet them, if it’s important to you.” He laid back down, putting his head back on Harry’s shoulder. Harry squirmed until he had an arm around him.
Potter rolled his eyes and continued. “Remember how Ron and Hermione kicked our arse at pool three weeks in a row?”
“Lots,” Draco said after a moment, wrinkling his nose and fidgeting. Harry twitched and tried to breathe normally. “You can move.”
Draco tilted his head to the side, curious. “Why are you so caught up on feathers, Potter? I know they’re linked to Veela and you think the creature magic has addled you, but this is starting to sound like a fetish.”
But even as the warmth spread lower, his cock hardening, he didn’t feel a need to rush anything. Malfoy had made it clear what he wanted and what he didn’t, and there was something about these moments together that made Harry hesitant to change anything too soon. These two nights they had spent together, long past midnight on a roof in the middle of London, felt somehow removed from time, from history. It felt like something was changing, something bigger than the two of them.
Then, something caught his eye. A faint, red mark on his neck that he was certain hadn’t been there before. He stood up and went to investigate, his eyes widening in shock as he realised what it was.
The scene changed, showing Draco as he had been just the other month, laughing over dinner with Pansy and Blaise. He felt a flood of peace course through him, and the rising agitation of the curse began to fade as he accepted the ways he didn’t make sense and saw through clearly to what was there underneath. There was a power in that, in knowing that he was more than the sum of his parts.
Ron turned to see what had caught his attention. “Oh, come off it. I know you feel guilty and you’re trying to become mates or some bloody rot, but you don’t have to be with him all the time.”
volatile. Don’t think you’re off the hook, but… no. It was for me. I haven’t been keeping it together too well, and if I was going to be in a high risk scenario, I needed a way to ensure I kept my cool.” He took a deep breath, swallowed, and then said, “The hex got Pansy.”
His entire demeanor had changed. His voice was gentle, filled with laughter even when he wasn’t joking. The children gazed up at him, and despite a few giggles and whispered conversations, they listened. Pretty impressive considering the ages ranged from around six to ten.
Draco wasn’t sure what made him do it, but he let go of the glamour on his charms, just to see what would happen.
Then he tunes back into the conversation and realises how upset and guilty Draco looks, and he can’t say anything at all.
more than once in my life, and it’s leaving me with the unpleasant realisation that all we have in this world is—conceptually—each other.” He finished with a blank stare, pushing his fork around aimlessly.
Potter leaned back against the bench and looked thoughtful. “What do we want people to think when they look at us?”
. But emotions are like a bottomless pool; once you’ve given over to one, the others will follow. There was a rage simmering below the thickness of desire in Potter’s voice, an anger that Draco couldn’t predict.
He trudged inside, folded himself into his favourite armchair, and opened the letter from his mother.
Harry gaped at Malfoy in disbelief while Ron made gurgling noises beside him and quickly flushed an unattractive red.
Their conversation faded into the background, and Draco pulled Potter aside before they reached the rest of the clan.
The fishtank-like neutralisation device had been his latest and final attempt to locate the hex. Typically used on venomous curses, it neutralised the effects by mimicking the environment of the ocean one hundred fathoms deep. Harry had hoped the tracking blockage was due to something venomous in Stanthrope’s hex, which he could neutralise via the instrument. But the hope died when the Gruddlepunk in his fish tank just spat water in his face and blew a raspberry.
Harry grinned involuntarily and propped himself up on his right elbow. He had a better angle that way, and he could see every expression that passed across Malfoy’s face. It was exhilarating. Malfoy’s face was completely open, wonder and disbelief crossing it in equal parts as he bit his lip and tried to hold back his whimpering. Every now and then, his hold on Harry would grow slack, like he forgot what he was doing, and Harry would grind against him gently until he remembered and began stroking again with fervor.
With a slow, practised slide, Malfoy pulled back and flicked his hair out of his eyes. It was already sticking to his forehead with a thin sheen of sweat. A slow smile curled into the corner of his mouth as the mist drifted between them, dreamlike and somehow more real than anything Harry had seen or felt in years.
The question was: did he want it enough to turn this down? Were his principles too high? Was his self-respect so strong that he would refuse a night of comfort in Potter’s arms—willing, enthusiastic,
“Get a room!” Pansy groaned, giving them a little shove as she walked passed, toward the door. “Come on, I’m hungry.”
Potter sighed, closing his book and turning to Draco as if glad for the distraction. “It’s erratic… Mostly people wouldn’t notice, but after the Elder Wand my magic has been more susceptible to fluctuations. I notice them more, I mean. It’s hard to explain.” He pulled a face, looking for a moment like the schoolboy Draco remembered. He realised suddenly that, despite how they had slipped into their childhood rivalry like there were seconds rather than years between them, that schoolboy had been absent until now. “I’ve felt more connected to my magic since… the Elder Wand. It’s like I
Draco felt the blood drain from his face. “Well, we’re not in quite the same rush now,” he said faintly. “I’m sure we can think of something.”
And whether he ended up with Potter’s love or not, Draco was learning to love himself. Whatever else happened, that was enough.
Finally, he couldn’t delay the inevitable any longer. Hopefully Pansy didn’t need them for too long, and he and Potter could escape with relative ease. He Apparated away.
He knew instantly he’d gone too far. Malfoy’s expression closed off, and he leaned back. All too quickly, the cold, haughty Malfoy he’d known through school returned—it was the first time he’d seen him since the war. A shiver ran down his spine.
His reactions made Harry feel powerful. He didn’t have much patience for foreplay; however, the idea of going all the way,
“You know, what look are we going for? Are we secretly pining for each other? Is it a slow transformation from friends to lovers?” Potter winked. “Angry sex?”
At least, that was the plan, but he only got as far as the shower before everything just seemed to hit him at once. He stared at himself in the bathroom mirror, his hair a ragged, wet mess that flopped forward and nearly reached his eyes. Rivulets of water ran down his cheeks, his chest, and the towel sagged on his hips because he lacked the energy to bother fixing it.
Harry stared at Professor Staltwort in horror. He had thought they were done with all of the ridiculous introductions and inane ice breakers. Apparently not. Apparently, moving onto the fieldwork part of the course and partnering up with someone meant a whole new kind of hell.
Where they stood on the balcony was shrouded in shadow, and Blaise’s party was huge and full of Slytherins. No one in their right mind would think it was the two of them up here.
He grinned; if he had to share with Malfoy, at least their room seemed to be next to some kind of furnace. The heat bled straight through the walls.
Draco’s broomstick clattered to the floor. He only took three seconds of panicked second-guessing before he stripped off his leathers in record time and walked under the showerhead next to Potter’s.
When Malfoy announced he’d found the cure, that everyone would live, his eyes shone with tears and his face was blotchy red from exertion. Harry picked him up and spun him in circles around the balcony.
Fine. Meet me tomorrow at the café with the blue door just north of the Musée du Parfum. Look for the black kitten sunning itself; each morning at precisely ten, it takes over the entire front window. It’s quite a sight.
Of course, Potter frowned at him and lifted the coffee pot with a questioning shake. “I didn’t know if you preferred tea or coffee,” he said slowly, sounding as confused as he no doubt felt, guided by the curse to play house with a Malfoy but internally resisting it as only a Potter could.
They were leaning so close together, Draco could feel Potter’s breath rasping across his skin with each ragged exhalation. Potter’s face twisted into something pained, something furious.
I’m going to France. Does the wizard district use Galleons there or do I need to change over currency?
“No, it’s not new,” Potter agreed. “But it’s—” He broke off and scrubbed a hand across his face. Then he said abruptly, “I’m angry at myself. It’s nothing to do with you. Sorry I was a dick last night.”
“You’ve no idea how long I’ve wanted to do that,” he gasps, dropping lower to mouth at Draco’s neck.
“It’s just, if everything’s not alright,” Ron soldiered on, and Harry started to feel real panic about the existence of that sign. “We can talk about it.” He lowered his voice. “We don’t even have to tell Hermione—I know how she can get. I won’t give you advice. You can just… you can tell me whatever it is, and then I’ll keep my mouth shut and pretend I didn’t hear anything. You know. If you want.”
. He’d catch sight of something out of the corner of his eye and his whole demeanor would change, or someone would say something and he’d just freeze up.
The simple statement sent a tingle running through Draco’s body, leaving him a little breathless. He forced his face to act normally and smiled.
Her expression and her words left Draco feeling raw, stripped bare. What was he supposed to tell her? That something was wrong with Potter and he couldn’t stop thinking about it? That he felt an overwhelming urge to help Potter because he didn’t think anyone else was going to?
The noise of the party still surrounded him, the music thudding through the walls and from the garden below. He’d never felt more removed from his surroundings.
Malfoy, who he had noticed previously had no problem with his nudity, relaxed back onto the bed. He was heavily lidded, watching Harry through slits, and as Harry looked on, he flexed and reached down to lazily caress himself.
“Is there ever a good time to admit you’re failing at life?” Draco retorted. “I thought I had demons, Potter, but at least they live in a dust-free environment.”
It had been years since he last took any sort of structured classes, but he didn’t remember them being so difficult. How was it that as a teenager he was capable of spending eight hours in lessons back to back, but as an adult, he could barely handle three hours without wanting to rip his hair out or sleep indefinitely?
The way he rolled the word tremor over his tongue made Harry weak, but he only smiled and said, “Bite me.”
Eventually, he gave a snarl of irritation and smacked Potter on the shoulder. Potter pulled back with a smirk and slowly dropped the jacket off his shoulders, throwing it onto the floor and pulling his tight, white shirt over his head in one smooth move.
He eventually decided on the charcoal three-piece. He couldn’t bring himself to choose anything brighter. He dressed slowly and carefully, poking and prodding at his face until it seemed to fall into some semblance of “alive”. He chose a pale concealer for under his eyes, smoothing out the lines that he swore had popped up in the last few weeks alone. When he’d finished, there wasn’t a hair out of place; he was dressed to kill, and he’d never felt less equipped to face the world.
“It’s a lot,” he echoed Draco’s earlier words, suddenly coming to the realisation of what it was like to be on the opposite end. It didn’t feel bad or hurt, it was just… unusual. Different than having fingers inside himself.
“We have time,” Harry insisted, dropping lower and gently laving a nipple. “I’m just going to suck you off. Won’t take long.”
“Stanthrope wasn’t Patient Zero,” Malfoy murmured, face even paler than usual as he read the name off the instrument. “She’s casting it.”
The liquor was beginning to warm Draco, and he felt relaxed enough to prop his elbows back on the bench and study Potter—something he didn’t often do. While they might be friends now, it still didn’t take much for them to get into some argument or other, and he’d found the easiest way to avoid it was to keep their interactions light and easy. The gentle lamp light made strange shadows flicker across Potter’s face; it made him look skittish again, just as he had when he’d first stepped through the Floo.
The sun had lifted above the horizon by the time Draco refamiliarised himself with the curse. Along with reverting him to fledgling state, it appeared the first stage, whereby the curse bonded them together, might last days. During which Draco would experience bouts of uncontrollable rage towards Potter.
Unfortunately, that only served to make Pansy squeal even louder and lean on Granger’s shoulder for support.
“It’s all right,” Granger said kindly, giving her head a little shake and turning to face him. “It’s not your fault. He gets like this sometimes.”
Blaise shook his head carefully. “You can’t plan for that. You can’t read the future. All you can do is try, and if you think that this is the best thing for him right now, then what’s the harm in keeping it going?”
He went to bed that night making a mental list of all the different things he’d like to try with Malfoy, and for perhaps the first time in his life, he felt the desire to visit the library in the morning without Hermione having to nag him about it.
“Oh sure,” Malfoy spat. “No worries—Harry Potter tells me not to get worked up, so that solves it, then.”
Draco smirked. “Are you sure about that, Potter? You always were obsessed with knowing every little thing I was—
Potter slowly nodded. Behind him, Draco could see a strange silver arch and a messy-haired man standing in front. The man’s eyes widened, but even as he cried out, Potter stayed looking at him, green eyes fixed to his.
Draco staggered, certain that no one—not even Blaise—had ever done that to him before. He cleared his throat.
With a growing sense of horror, Draco began to recognise the complicated swirl of emotion inside him. The need he kept feeling to reach out to Potter, to comfort him, began to make an awful sort of sense. He had to get out of here before Potter noticed.
When you first began work as a curse breaker, they taught you that curses were like a series of babushka dolls with teeth: find the opening without getting bitten, and you’d slowly get closer to the curse’s core until you were able to destroy it. It wasn’t until Draco was in his sixth year of training that he realised that was utter bullshit. Curses weren’t like babushka dolls at all; they were like balls of yarn that were made out of barbed wire. The only consolation was that centuries of study and practice had given their profession a collection of maps to work by. Once you knew what you were looking for, you could locate all the little pressure points, poke them one by one, and the wire would unravel in a neat and orderly fashion, like the layers of a doll.
putting in every effort to work together. He was a professional, and, personal feelings towards Potter aside, he intended to act as such. But it was unreasonable to expect his entire personality to change.
As he browsed the shelves, he heard some children burst into the shop, bringing icy wind whirling in with them for a split second before it hit the shop’s warming charm and fell away.
, and I wasn’t one of them.” He wanted to stop talking, but he couldn’t. “I fucked up, Potter. And that was when I knew it. If I’d only chosen your side instead, I’d have been saved then, too.”
“Ron.” Potter’s voice sounded utterly betrayed. Even Draco felt a little wrong-footed listening to this, but he didn’t leave.
Draco’s stomach did that funny thing again, and he covered it by swallowing half his drink in one go. “Right. I guess we’d better start planning, then.”
He watched Malfoy for the rest of dinner, not even bothering to hide it anymore. He had no idea what it could be that was bothering him, or why he had acted like he did, suddenly so cold. All he knew was that he felt like something had been taken away from him. He didn’t even care about the sex, it had nothing to do with that, but that left the question: if it wasn't the sex he was missing, what was it?
Running a hand through his hair, he emerged with a leaf, his fingers finding grazed skin in the place where the branch had hit him. His first thought was
Malfoy stopped dead, and his eyes flew up to meet Harry’s. It felt scarily like they were frozen together in that moment, like if Harry so much as dared to breathe or think or move, the moment would shatter and they’d combust or something equally horrible.
“I didn’t know specifically! Look, he’s just a kid.” She waved her arm in exasperation at Kalen. “He was trying to impress George, and now he’s scared. He’s an impulsive little brat, but he’s not a danger. Just let him go, please.”
Potter’s mouth twisted into a wry grin. “Figures. What does that mean, then? We’re just stumbling in the dark until we land on a miracle and he wakes up?”
“Or maybe she’ll go better just picking it up. Who knows. It’s always different when they’re borrowed brooms. She told me she’d seen her mum hiding one away upstairs so she thinks it’s going to be her birthday present.” He started laughing. “She’s a sneaky kid. I think she’ll sort Slytherin if she goes to Hogwarts. Even if she doesn’t, I reckon we’ll find her sneaking across the grounds after hours if she goes to any of the holiday programs. Did I tell you McGonagall approved them? She wants to run a Potions program too.”
Potter smirked. “So I thought you could help me put together a funding proposal. The Ministry will never approve it if it doesn’t fit their budget.”
He tuned out of the rest of Pansy’s anecdote about how busy Diagon Alley had been and how dreadful the general public were by way of sound and smell, and began his plans for the following morning. If he’d bothered to notice the way that Pansy was smirking at him, he might have realised he had quite probably walked right into a suspicious trap, but by that point, even he would have acknowledged that the damage was done.
Harry removed the pillow from his face and sat up at that, peering shrewdly at Malfoy, who was playing with his hands in his lap at the desk and resolutely refusing to meet Harry’s eyes.
Potter shrugged. “Well, yeah. I thought if I could trick the Veela into thinking I’d made a nest for us, I could make the curse think it had… worked.”
George had considered removing the flaw while enhancing the tactility of the experience, but strangely enough, it was harder to give yourself over to the daydream when it was limited to the mind’s eye and invisible touches. It was too obviously fake. When the vision was right there in the room with you, it was easier to lie to yourself, to pretend that what was happening was real. All the product testers had unanimously agreed that it was worth the risk of exposing yourself, and in a way, the increased need for privacy made the experience seem even more real.
Potter’s eyes ran over him, and Draco swallowed. There was something heated in them now, even more so than in the brief glance last night.
“What is it now?” Draco sneered, but he walked away without waiting for an answer; unwanted guest or no, his parents had raised him with manners, and it was nearly eleven by now, so he led the way to the kitchen where they could discuss Potter’s numerous issues like grown men. Potter shuffled awkwardly behind him, picking objects up and putting them down again like he hadn’t just been here and also didn’t know how to be a functioning adult.
Summer was fading, the green of the leaves changing to a striking orange. Draco let his hands trail along the wood of the park bench, stretching his arms out along the back of it as he sat and waited for Potter to show. There was a family of ducks waddling across the grass in front of him, intent on their foraging. Every now and then one of the ducklings would escape and go tearing toward the water, wings outstretched for balance as it stumbled and tripped its way along the lawn.
For a second, he looked so wretched that Draco’s anger faded away. “I suppose I can understand that.” He sighed. “How did you change it?”
Potter finished writing Kalen O'Fearadhaigh’s name on Draco’s arm, and then he stood back and retrieved the amulet from his shirt.
sharing a room,” she stated, though it sounded more like a question with the way her voice went high at the end.
Draco leaned back in his chair, drumming his fingers on the table in front of him. “So, after snooping here for Merlin knows how many hours—days?—you now request my permission to collect feathers from my peafowl, conduct some spell no doubt also on my property, and engage with the Veela who hates you so much they have submitted you for execution. Is that the summary?”
Several things happened very suddenly, and Draco found himself abruptly thrown across the room. He swore violently, throwing aside the toy which had reacted to his sudden alarmed grip by covering him in bright pink dust, and stumbled to his feet, trying to process what had happened. Potter was casting shield charms over everything; a tall, willowy woman had appeared from the back room and was speaking rapidly into a tiny rectangle; and—
“The question,” Malfoy said slowly, pulling the piece of parchment out of his pocket and shoving it at Harry. “Ask. Me. Again.”
The practice came to an end, and the sea of kids came rushing back to their parents, all talking over each other at once. Draco waited at the side while Harry collected the piles of brooms and shrunk the Quidditch hoops back into the ground, lest any Muggle break through the privacy shield around the oval.
He walked off to the other end of the store and began to pick up objects at random, searching for something that Millicent’s two demons might enjoy for several minutes before they broke it. As he searched, he listened. The faint sounds of laughter from the back of the shop reached his ears, and he
“Oi!” Potter interrupted. “Firstly, rude. Secondly, do you really think that if we were trying to trick you, we’d
Harry managed to make it all the way to the shower this time, though the memory of that wink had spilling over onto the tiles, moaning and thrusting into his hand, within seconds.
The roof was empty tonight, the occupants of the apartments fast asleep. Draco Apparated to the uppermost apartment, the one he had stayed in, and found it empty. He wasn’t surprised—he’d left a strong illusion on it to deter any onlookers, and the entire space was taken over by enlargement spells and charms. It felt like home, if a little dusty and forgotten.
Draco pulls back and stares up at him, eyes wide and brow furrowed. “No, wait,” he mutters. “That’s all wrong.”
“We bought them new dishcloths and tea towels,” Granger explained, wiping her sudsy hands on her jeans and walking over to Draco. “But Ron couldn’t remember where he’d left them.”
Harry’s heart was beating quickly. He fancied Malfoy might be able to hear it with how loud it felt in his ears.
He barely made it through the glass doors before Potter had grabbed him and shoved him up against the side of the building. His hands roamed across Draco’s body like it was new, like it was perfect. Draco closed his eyes and let his head fall back against the brick. The cold of the night surrounded him, making Potter’s warm hands feel feverishly hot against his skin.
Malfoy’s hands gripped his legs nervously for a second, before he made them relax. He stood up, and Harry realised that Malfoy was still a good deal taller than him. Harry lifted a hand, chickened out on the way to cupping Malfoy’s jaw, and rested his palm on Malfoy’s chest instead. It was warm, and he could feel Malfoy’s heart beating furiously beneath his fingers.
He heard Potter give a soft laugh and withdraw his fingers, and then he could feel Potter’s cock pushing in. Strong hands gripped his ankles, massaging gently and pulling them up so they were braced firmly on the bed. He gasped as Potter lifted his hips, propping him up so that his arse rested on Potter’s thighs. It was a more intense angle, and when Potter started to move in a slow, controlled slide, his hands fell away from the headboard to cling to the sheets beneath him and he bit down on his lip to keep from crying out.
With a sweep of his hand, he knocked everything off the coffee table and lay back on it. Harry choked back a laugh that quickly turned into something like a sob as Draco began unbuttoning his shirt, letting it fall away from his pale shoulders and leaving acres of skin in its wake. With another flick of his hand, this time with magic, he Vanished his trousers and boxers.
None of that made sense in Draco’s mind, the grain basket falling to the delighted Igrelda’s ministrations, because as quickly as he registered the present, it escaped him again, sending him into a coughing fit. Bright red droplets spattered onto his hand, followed by even brighter fear, sharp, consuming him.
The upturned crate that served as a coffee table was going to go—Draco was going to burn it. He was going to burn it and dance around it and laugh. Then he was going to eviscerate the moth-eaten curtains into tiny shreds. And after that, he was going to throw every piece of transfigured furniture into a huge pile in the middle of the road and hail the Knight Bus to run over it.
The room was already dark. Harry undressed as quickly as he could, uncomfortably aware that Malfoy hadn’t closed his curtains, and hopped into bed. Minutes passed. The silence felt uncomfortably thick, in that way it did when two people were pretending to be asleep, but not trying particularly hard.
“Dragons for the dragon?” Malfoy had drawled, leaning on the bar so that the line of his collar hung low enough that Harry could see his nipples. “How original.”
“When we started out, I was uncomfortable with the idea of complete sexual intimacy, but I think I might be ready for it now.”
The four of them fell silent. Draco didn’t quite know what to say to that, and from the look on Granger’s face she felt equally uncomfortable. After a moment, Potter just laughed.
“Harry,” Draco says cautiously, lifting himself up onto his elbows and meeting Harry’s eyes. “I don’t know.”
He turned into Flourish and Blotts and began to peruse the shelves for a gift for his mother. She was becoming increasingly difficult to buy for, as her hobbies turned more and more eclectic. Ever since Lucius had passed away, every year had been a step further down the path of mindless distraction. Last year had been her obsession with pottery. He lost track of the number of sculpture books and materials she had acquired, although he had to admit she had produced some lovely clay peacocks.
Malfoy met his gaze, and what looked like irritation flashed through his eyes before he visibly, and audibly, inhaled. The muscles in his cheek rippled again, and when he next spoke, he sounded considerably less calm.
There didn’t appear to be anything out of order in his surroundings. The polished wood of the table was unsinged and the passing waiters seemed entirely unruffled as they greeted new customers. Both Weasley and Granger were giving each other secret smiles over the top of their glasses, blissfully unaware of the rest of the pub.
“It wins,” Draco agreed reluctantly, sweeping his hula-hooping Santa Claus off the table and onto the floor, where losers belonged.
Draco nodded, watching as Potter strode down the lane to his front step and wriggled the latch. He looked smaller from this distance, even though Draco knew it was only his mind playing tricks on him and twisting length and shadow into an inaccurate rendition of fact. The facts had already been determined; no amount of perception could alter them.
Neville and Ron retreated not too long after to get settled into their own dorm. They were staying on the other end of the castle in the Ravenclaw dorms, and Neville was anxious to get back in case it took them hours to solve whatever riddle they needed to get in, and Ron, Harry suspected, wanted a quick escape.
He was an idiot. He’d jumped blindly into this, and now Malfoy was going to laugh at him, thinking he was some scared little virgin. It wasn’t that he wanted to stop completely, he just wanted to… not jump straight into anal sex. But of course, Malfoy would find that weak, and he probably wouldn’t want to fool around with someone who wanted to take things so slowly.
An owl swooped through an open window and dropped a letter from his mother. The penmanship was hastily written, far hastier than Narcissa Malfoy would ever write a death notice, far too full of excitement and disbelief. Draco smiled, knowing the contents without needing to open them.
“To that end, we need to consider the pushback once pure-blood families read between the lines and see that they’re unlikely to gain assistance from the program if they’re magically capable of providing the security the program provides.”
They fell apart, breathing ragged as they sank into the mattress, hands and legs brushing. The mist trailed above them, a comforting bubble of separation from the world. One that Harry thought, now that he'd had it for even just a moment, he might not need anymore.
“Bloody hell, it’s easy to see who the favourite is, isn’t it?” Seamus said, dropping down onto one of the unused beds. “You got a six person dorm.”
He came to a halt at the foot of Ron’s bed and resisted the urge to shuffle his feet like an awkward schoolboy.
He straightened up, staring at the sky full of stars and wondering what the old feeling uncurling in his stomach was this time. It was too upset to be hope, but too fiery to be hopelessness. Perhaps there was something in the middle. Perhaps that’s what he needed to find these days—his way back to the middle.
“I think you’re vulnerable.” The words were quiet, barely above a whisper. “I think you’ve seen something you can’t look away from. And when you latch onto an idea, you’re like a dog with a bone, Draco. Honestly, sometimes I think you should have sorted Gryffindor; you think entirely too much with your heart sometimes, not your head.” She paused, and then shot a shrewd glance at his thighs. “Your heart and other things.”
Suddenly, everything clicked into place. He sat back down on his bed, clearing his throat and looking awkwardly down at the parchment still in his hand. He didn’t know how to fix it, so he said the only thing he could think of.
Draco shifted in the chair, allowing himself to acknowledge the emotions he kept so tightly reined in. He felt safe here, and he liked sitting with his back to the window.
It was all at once strange and familiar. He tried to find the angle that he liked on himself, but his hand wouldn’t go that way, and he couldn’t get his position quite right. Malfoy groaned, coming up onto his elbow and leaning over Harry slightly, which was easier, but meant that Harry was overcome with the sudden desire to kiss Malfoy again. He reached up with his left hand and grabbed Malfoy by the back of the neck, pulling him down into a kiss just as he began moving faster with his right, responding to the urgency of Malfoy’s mouth.
Harry took the moment to observe Malfoy—really observe him—now that he wasn’t distracted by the feeling of a hand that wasn’t his own on his cock and then the euphoric rush of orgasming. He was facing away from Harry, head nestled into the edge of the pillow, but his eyes were closed and he was breathing deeply. His cheeks were flushed with perhaps the most colour Harry had ever seen on them.
“Whose fate do you think we’re choosing?” he asked lightly, watching the sand fall and thinking of the final line in Potter’s prophecy. He answered without waiting for Potter. “I think it’s our own. And each other’s. And a million other entwined fates, always… Our fates are always wrapped up in someone else’s, even if we wish we could deal with them alone.” He sighed. “Do you think I’m weak, Harry, if I accept your apology just like that?”
Harry looked over to see his eyes were heavy lidded as he watched Harry’s movements. His hand was resting casually against his hip, a hairsbreadth from his hard cock, but he wasn’t touching himself—instead, he seemed to be enjoying the light tease of his fingers against his own thigh as his eyes rested on where Harry was hard and dripping.
“Yes, I’ve added you permanently to the wards,” Draco answered. “You can Apparate from anywhere here, if you want. But, just wait a second, I have information.”
“Never better,” Potter murmured with a wicked grin, doing up his trousers and leaning back against the railing.
Draco watched him, taking in the tired lines of his face, the strange spark of something unidentifiable in his eyes. He was missing something here, but he couldn’t put a finger on it. There was something in the way Potter was sitting, something brittle in the way his mouth formed the words. Was he always like this, and it was just that Draco was looking at him properly for the first time?
“We’re not far from the end,” he said. “I’d say there are only one or two more mechanisms left. No need to open the box after all, thank Merlin, because I was having second thoughts.”
A stab of want hits him straight in the gut, and he has to force himself to remember that anyone who walks into the room can see what he sees; he needs to ward the house before he goes too far and someone unwittingly gets a front row seat to his deepest desires.
I think he’s messing with me. He sent me to this Muggle café with a cat in the window. He said he’d meet me there, but I waited for hours and he never showed. What do I do?
“Do you know what you did wrong?” Draco asked airily, part of him cringing because he knew so, so deeply that no matter what Potter had done to him, Draco had done far worse.
“I’m nineteen, Malfoy,” Harry said, swinging his legs idly so that his heels thunked back against the brickwork. “I don’t sulk.”
“Now, you’re just arguing like an old, married couple actually,” she finished with a snort, the perplexed expression disappearing from her face as she said the words. “Yeah, that’s it.”
Potter and Blaise both frowned at him. “No,” Potter said slowly. “I saw the Veela flying well before the curse started up. Before I changed the prophecy, too.”
He realised it wasn’t his own breath he was hearing. Slowly, with care, he rose to his feet and crossed the room to the doorway to ease the door open. The sobs were louder out here. He listened to Malfoy cry for several minutes, wondering what he should be doing about it since Malfoy would absolutely not want Harry to know.
He felt Potter relax beside him, like he’d been waiting for a different sort of acknowledgement altogether.
Pansy narrowed her eyes in suspicion, but Granger only laughed. “Yeah, well, we did warn you. Did he throw things at you? Or did he just kick you straight out?”
“Bottom’s up,” Potter said, mouth twitching. “But maybe sit down first. Two dreamscapes in one night, you’re going to pass out quick.”
It was difficult at first, a little stilted and uneven, until Draco realised that talking with Potter was very similar to arguing with him, once you found the right topic, and everything fell into place from there.
“What?” his voice was quiet and faintly drawling in a way that made Harry imagine Malfoy was sneering.
“What the fuck,” he breathed quietly before reaching down and double checking that he hadn’t done something incredibly embarrassing.
Slowly, he let his hand drift down beneath the sheets, gripping himself through his pajamas. It felt amazing, but was he really going to do this? Was he really going to wank over Potter?
Draco groaned against Potter’s skin and then dropped back down again. This time, he held nothing back, licking and pressing his tongue as deep as he could while Potter thrust up into his waiting fist. He felt Potter grip his hair in warning, and then his cock jumped, warm ropes of come sliding over Draco’s fingers as Potter howled into the pillow.
His eyes met Potter’s in the mirror as he said that last word, and he immediately saw both understanding and surprise reflected there.
“Why are you so angry?” Draco asked, handing him one of the two grain baskets he used in the morning. “I feel like I’m locked in with a—” He’d been about to say Death Eater, because that’s what Potter reminded him off, but he caught himself at the last second, noting the comparison unwise. “A rabid lion,” he finished lamely.
His heart was racing so fast in his chest that he felt like he was going to throw up. He never wanted Potter to look at him like that again. It made him think of bathrooms and more blood than one person should be able to spill and still live.
“And if you run out of ideas, I’ve got a whole notebook full of rumors I was planning to spread about you in fourth year.”
You can imagine how Ron and Hermione would react to that. It’s wonderful to have friends, but there are some things you just can’t tell them.
“They are.” Then Draco grinned. “Do you mean we’ve really stumbled on something the Unspeakables aren’t aware of? Be still my beating heart.”
“No!” Granger insisted, while Weasley glared at him. “Aren’t you listening? We gave him space. He knew we were there for him if he needed us, but whatever he was going through, he needed time to work it out on his own. He’s better now.”
I was—” he hesitated. “Moved, I suppose. A little betrayed, sure, but mostly touched and horrified that you had to go through that and—” he broke off and turned sharply to Potter. “You are
The specifics of the letter wormed their way into Draco’s mind, and he stiffened. The Stevenses, his mother had said… but surely they were tied to Draco. Why else would a Veela Curse of all things have turned up
A thought that made no sense occurred to him: that the curse may not have shown him a future he could not have after all, and that maybe all he needed to do was trust and choose.
Harry decides he’s being ridiculous; if Draco didn’t like something, he would tell him. So, he goes about his life as if nothing has changed. And soon, it begins to feel as though nothing has. Draco doesn’t bring up another argument, and although he still seems distracted, mostly they are fine.
Potter’s head whipped around, his eyes flashing. “You think that’s okay to say to a kid, do you? Think that’s appropriate?”
“We said we need to trust each other, remember?” Draco snapped. “We can’t be fighting, or the curse can take advantage of our weaknesses.”
“You know, I genuinely thought—” he broke off again and turned back. “It doesn’t matter what I thought. Can we do this, Malfoy? Can we finish this without resorting to stupid little fights and insults?”
Potter twisted, running a finger gently along Draco’s arse, down the cleft of his cheeks, and it was too much.
Later that day, when they were out in the forest checking once more for the unicorn hairs that they needed for their final assignment, it dawned on Harry that everything had shifted. It had started with small little touches when no one was looking—a hand on the shoulder, fingers running through hair—but soon enough he found himself not caring who saw. And the change that came over Draco as a result was breathtaking.
All the time, Draco realised silently, noting it with the same quiet sadness he noted all of the consequences his choices had led him to.
The memory of those lips over his cock flooded his mind, and he stopped caring. He slid inside his pajamas, palmed himself, and began to stroke.
Potter’s chest heaved and his eyes had turned slightly glazed. After a moment, Draco realised he wasn’t looking at Draco; his eyes were fixed at some distant point Draco couldn’t see.
Even with the cloud that had settled over him, Potter’s eyes were suddenly filled with heat. Draco shifted back a little more, unsettled at the way Potter seemed to be straddling a knife’s edge tonight. On one side was the familiar darkness; on the other, there appeared to be heat—intoxicating sensation. Draco wasn’t sure he wanted to follow Potter down either path.
Draco bristled, but he forced himself to let it go. “There are always flaws if you know where to look,” he admitted. “Did you want to readdress it? I can clear time in my schedule.”
The curtains were pulled shut, and even with the faint light Draco could now see coming from what must be Potter’s study, the place felt gloomy and uninhabited. It felt haunted, but not in the wizarding sense, where you could talk and laugh with the ghosts—it felt Muggle haunted, where your every step was shadowed by an unknown creature, sapping your strength and sanity when you least expected it. Draco had a brief, delirious thought that it was haunted by Potter.
“Bit late in the game for that isn’t it?” Malfoy shot, acid in his tone. “The way I hear it, you’ve fucked your way through half the wizards in London. If you’re still confused after that, I’m afraid I can’t help you.”
“Behold,” he said, dropping the roll on the table with the air of one producing an ace, “the most hideous wrapping paper you’ve ever laid eyes on.”
he demanded with all the grace that implied that if Harry’s answer was anything other than a swift “no”, there was going to be trouble.
With nothing much else to do, he watered the rest of the succulents and watched the bees fly from flower to flower. The bees with the white stripes were slower than the others, he noted. They made far fewer trips back to the flowers, instead drifting happily on the air currents while the others dived through the air with a fierce determination.
“How do you like it?” Draco asked, unable to keep from reaching out and running a hand through Potter’s hair, caressing the thick strands. “A little rough? Slow? Kinky? Or are you a vanilla sort of man?”
It did look like glitter. His hair was longer too, just below his ears, and it was slicked back in a way wholly unlike how it had been at school. When he was younger, there hadn’t been a hair out of place. Now, it just looked… wet… not soaking, but like he’d recently stepped out of the shower, run his fingers through his hair, tousled it a bit, and then… lightly dusted it with glitter. Harry couldn’t take his eyes off it.
“Welcome!” George Weasley appeared from behind a stack of spinning wheels, the smile falling off his face when he made eye contact with Draco. “Oh, it’s you. What do you want, Malfoy?”
Potter gave a weak laugh. “How likely is it, do you think, that we might be as willing to actually listen to each other out there as we were in here?”
The doors of the Great Hall opened, and a tall, slender figure in a tailored travelling cloak and heeled boots appeared in the entrance. Harry squinted. No way, no way in—
Once or twice, Malfoy’s forehead drew together, and he would grab Harry with his free hand and guide him slower, softer, while the hand that gripped Harry’s cock mirrored those same movements. It was almost too much, when he did that, like they were sharing something more than just a convenient release. Harry wanted more of it. He wanted Malfoy to feel comfortable enough to show Harry everything that brought him pleasure, and then he wanted to do just that.
For the first time since they’d begun their bet, there was no hint of suspicion beneath Pansy’s words. Their performance was both subtle and believable enough that Pansy no longer questioned it. For some reason, the thought made Draco’s stomach sink.
” She muttered, the word sounding like a sob. She closed her eyes for half a second, and then snapped them open again. “Get St Mungo’s,” she said to a hovering waiter, her tone sure and authoritative.
“You’ve bothered one. Shocking, I know.” Draco poured himself a cup of tea and sat opposite Potter, who was in the middle of taking long, grateful sips from his own brown mug. Also brought from home. “Have you heard of the Veela Curse?”
Draco rose to his feet and crossed the room to retrieve a bottle of scotch from the liquor cabinet. He poured two glasses and sent one floating across the room where Potter took it with a nod of thanks.
To his surprise, Malfoy smirked and reached for him, wrapping an arm around Harry’s waist and turning them on the spot. When they reappeared on the roof, Harry staggered against Malfoy, fighting for balance as the sudden wind threatened to bowl him over.
Draco opened his mouth to end the charade, the truth on the tip of his tongue, but then Potter bent down and swept him into a kiss. His lips were warm and insistent, coaxing Draco forward. It was so familiar, so comforting, that Draco couldn’t help but fall into it, his hand sliding around the back of Potter’s neck and holding him there. All his willpower evaporated, and in that moment, he wouldn’t have let go for the world.
He hears whimpering, and he forces himself to open his eyes and look down. Malfoy’s eyes are fixed on him, glazed and dark, and his cheeks are ruddy with exertion. His hand is slightly obscured by the folds of his shirt, so he almost looks decent—a model-like vision of decorum but for the way his hair knots where Harry has tangled it and his red, swollen lips.
He collapsed on the bed, plumes of dust startling into the air around him, and stared at the ceiling. After a moment, he lifted his wand and sent a tiny ball of golden sparks into the air. It hovered for a second, and then disappeared through the wall and into the night.
“Dobby has no master! Dobby is a free elf, and Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends!”
He knew a little about that. The word had been thrown in his face by a few Mind Healers over the years with varying degrees of tact. Somewhere, between specialists who cost more than a new wing for the Manor and potions that were illegal in some countries, he’d found a way to get by. It wasn’t the best way, and the journey was long, but he had his coping techniques and the Floo address for several professionals when it became too much to bear.
The voice pierced through the fog of his increasing panic—something about its tone dragging him out of his thoughts. He looked up and saw Potter’s concerned face mere inches from his own.
In the future, Potter would take Draco’s hand and lead him through the front gate, out into the world beyond. But it wasn’t the future yet; for now, it was the present, and Draco lived.
When he sees the sex toys laid out on the bed, his mouth goes dry. It’s not as if he doesn’t want to… He’s open to it, and anything that Draco does will be sexy as hell, he knows that. He’d even be lying if he said the thought of it didn’t arouse him, but… He knows how this goes. This is the last step when people are trying to salvage something beyond repair.
Draco stirred his ice cream around in his bowl with the spoon. It was already almost entirely liquid; warm swirls of what had once been chocolate icecream oozed sluggishly against his silverware. If he stopped stirring, he’d have to look up. If he looked up, he’d have to see Blaise’s face. If he saw Blaise’s face, he’d see just how soft and gentle Blaise was being with him, and
The boy—Kalen, Draco presumed—gaped in horror, and then closed his eyes and froze. Draco glanced at Morgan, who was looking between them all in shock.
He took his hand from Draco’s and carefully settled the unconscious goblin he was carrying onto the ground. Then he knelt over the body of Draco’s old house-elf and wept.
? Completely misunderstanding what’s going on and trying to make it out like I’m some kind of basket case?”
“Snap out of it,” Draco muttered, his eyes searching Potter’s for any sign that the man was fit to be in public. He didn’t find it. “You’re going to cause a scene.”
His face twisted into apprehension, but then Harry leaned in and pressed a kiss to his forehead, and the tension faded away.
Malfoy was trying to—bizarrely—be a better person, but he was still as much of a prick as he’d ever been.
Harry knew they were all thinking back to their adventures with parenting flobberworms in third year.
Ron knows about the cupboard. He knows all the many ways that Harry struggles, even to this day, to grow beyond it.
The sound of Malfoy pausing in his note-taking shouldn’t have been audible, but it was, along with the judgement in his breathing.
“I think I’m sober now,” Malfoy said after a while, stretching his arms above his head before he stood up. “Will I see you next week?”
“I said, can I kiss you?” Potter’s eyes were warm, the little crow’s feet in the corner crinkling with genuine affection.
“Potter,” he said with a frown, suddenly realising why the strange ink looked familiar. “Is that chocolate?”
“Bit potent,” Potter mumbled from beside him, sitting back on his hands and rolling his head around to stretch out his shoulders. “I thought it was meant to take a couple of minutes, so we could at least sit down first.”
He left the room quickly, eyes already blurring as he took corners at random, hoping he’d stumble on the exit before he stumbled on anyone he knew.
“Who would have thought it,” Potter said softly, his face soft with amusement that only Draco understood. A private joke, just for them. “Shall we?”
Draco’s head spun. Something was at work here, some piece of fate that he couldn’t trace, and if it went one way Potter would die, and if it went another…
Potter drained his glass and lifted his gaze to glare into the mirror behind the bar. For a moment, his eyes darted to the family where they’d moved into the corner, but he quickly looked away again. Draco tried to catch Potter’s gaze in the mirror, but he was intent upon himself, eyes fierce as he stared down his own reflection. As Draco watched, a strange sort of shift came over Potter’s features—a fierce disgust that burned so strong below Potter’s skin it couldn’t help but leak through to the surface.
Potter stood abruptly, hands clenching by his side as he ignored the soft coos of the sleepy birds and crossed the room to the armchair beside Draco’s. “I dreamwalked, because we’re running out of time, and I thought, since this curse is your own unconscious casting, your subconscious might hold answers your mind doesn’t. Don’t worry, I didn’t learn any of your deep dark secrets.”
He turned to watch, and found they were correct—a brunette who looked a couple of years older than them, maybe twenty-one, was currently grinding up against Malfoy and undoing his buttons in what he probably thought was a very seductive manner. Malfoy was leaning back against the wall, arms crossed, one eyebrow raised and an amused smirk on his face. Harry noted distantly that he didn’t seem impressed, but neither was he flustered or upset.
“Potter has changed,” Draco finally said, eyes a little glazed as switched his focus to his hands, twisting his fingers together in a manner that brought him straight back to first year Hogwarts and Professor Quirrell. “He’s not who he once was, and I don’t yet know why, but I do know that it’s killing him.”
Then, he pulled away, leaving Ron to dissect that cryptic remark on his own and making his way over to Malfoy.
“Don’t beat yourself up about it,” Draco mumbled, folding his arms and leaning back in the doorway. “You’re the first person to put it together in two centuries.”
“Whatever are you talking about?” Draco turned to her with an affected air of innocence. “Sponsorship schemes? Your overactive imagination is truly rearing its head tonight, darling.”
. God, how they hate you. And sure, you find out that magic exists, and that’s wonderful. It’s amazing. But that doesn’t make it go away because—”
A slight frown marred Potter’s features, and Draco found himself agreeing. There was something just out of reach, something that made him wish he could trade all the gold in Gringotts for just one memory from the spell. But, it was impossible—the original curse was gone before they could take it apart, and any chance of regaining their memories had gone with it.
“No. Draco,” Malfoy said, teasing himself languidly. He repeated his name, drawing out the vowels, and Harry couldn’t tell if the exaggeration was because stroking himself felt too good, or because he felt Harry was just that stupid. “Draaaaaacooo.”
He ran back to his desk so fast, he almost stumbled. Malfoy startled, watching him go, but didn’t say anything as Harry rummaged through his instruments for the only one he hadn’t thought to try.
Draco huffed a laugh against his chest and then pulled them back onto the bed. “You should probably undress me then,” he said, looking far more imperious than someone lying down should have the right to look.
You told me once that Mrs Figg smelled like boiled cabbages. Curiously enough, that’s exactly what your head smells like right now. You giant cabbagehead.
Draco studied him, taking in the concern on his face—the sudden softness to his eyes. He took in the lines on Potter’s face, some of them from laughter but many of them from weariness. He noted the darkness beneath his eyes and recalled the way that had evaporated in the blissful afterglow of their single night together.
“I can feel it now,” he said. “I couldn’t before because I had nothing to compare it to. These last few weeks have been intense. I met someone—well, I’ve known them a long time but never really
She appeared to be the soberest of the lot as she affected an incredulous and vaguely superior expression. It was only somewhat spoiled by the green silken tie knotted around her head. Draco looked down at his shirt; so that’s where that had gone.
“I’m going to try for two,” he warned, pulling his finger out entirely and making sure the two together were slick enough. The press back inside was more of a struggle than the first had been, and he had to keep pausing every time Malfoy twitched. It was entrancing to see and feel his fingers pumping slowly in and out of Malfoy.
Before Harry can protest that he doesn’t see anything wrong with it at all, Draco is hovering above him once more, arms braced on either side of the deck chair, while his mouth descends gently on Harry’s. Any last arguments flee from Harry’s mind. Draco’s lips are as soft as he ever imagined, and he tastes like mimosas and—
Something in Harry’s voice must have done what his words couldn't, because Malfoy stilled, looking from him to the Sneakoscope and back again. The Sneakoscope glowed faintly, and Malfoy carefully lowered his hands from the door.
Vanishing spells worked on the same principles as Apparition: destination, determination, deliberation. The destination for a paired cabinet was easy: the other half of the pair. But when one half of the cabinet had been operating with a new destination for so long, any determination to get back to the old way of doing things was gone. And recalcitrant cabinets who had gotten quite used to Vanishing things to undeterminable locations certainly weren’t willing to make deliberate decisions to return to such a rigid structure. It wasn’t until he’d given it a
They stopped talking after that. Potter created a path of green cogs that twisted up most of the wall, and Draco discovered a pink pathway that circled the room several times. It was silent as they worked, Draco noting down the readings from the spell, and Potter monitoring the anchor to make sure they weren’t in danger. Draco felt like he was attuned to Potter’s every move, like every breath and every brush of their arms against each other was a conversation he’d never bothered to listen to before.
The more Draco thought about it, the more he had the strongest sensation that it wasn’t a curse at all; what if it was a fan gift gone wrong? What if it was someone who admired Weasley's Wizard Wheezes and wanted to gain the approval and interest of its proprietors? If one looked at it as a show of skill, rather than a malicious attack, it began to make a whole lot more sense. Which meant that the inside of the box would likely hold the sender’s calling card. They probably hadn’t even known that the spell had gone off so poorly; Ron’s hospitalisation had been kept as quiet as possible. The sender had probably re-sent the package simply because they’d never heard back.
After a while, Harry gave up and they fell into silence before it was time to return, unfortunately empty-handed.
He wrapped his magic around each part, carefully separating them from each other, and with the precision of many years of training, dismantled them piece by piece. The final part—the entrapment spell—proved the most difficult of them all. In the end, all he could do was make it go dormant, but so long as no one reactivated it—and there would be few people alive who knew how—it wouldn’t be a danger to anyone.
This time, Draco jolted at the sight. Up until now, he had been astutely avoiding Potter’s gaze, lest the spell ignite the second stage. After the feather confession and smug pulling of rank, he was so pissed off he didn’t care. As Potter grinned, Draco met his gaze evenly, and this time he saw what was underneath.
The unnamed feeling grew, bursting within his chest. He’d always secretly admired Potter, respected him for what he’d done for the world, but, Merlin…
The Veela Curse worked on the chosen Veela as well, it seemed. That was something the legends hadn’t prepared him for.
“I wish—” Malfoy started. He sounded hesitant, almost nervous, if Harry were to guess. He’d gotten a little better at reading Malfoy these last few days. It was easiest when Harry wasn’t looking at him; he still had trouble with his face. “I wish I knew what it was like. Sex.”
He took a sip of his whiskey, opting for casual even though he was practically vibrating with a sense of anticipation, of urgency.
“Pull yourself together, Potter,” Malfoy said crossly. He was leading Harry down the corridor to the library where he’d asked Ron and Hermione to meet them.
I never had a cat, growing up. But my neighbour, Mrs Figg, had several. I used to hate going to her house, though I found out later that she was a Squib and the only person I had growing up who actually cared for me. Funny how life is, sometimes.
“If you ever want to talk about those reasons, I’m uniquely qualified to listen.” She handed him a card.
“I’ll get in touch with some colleagues first thing in the morning. I’m sure I won’t have trouble finding someone who—”
It was old, years old, and frayed at the edges. Both ends were damaged, as though each side had tried to pull the knot free over the years without ever succeeding.
“They still don’t know what the inhibitor is,” Potter admitted, his voice oddly subdued. “What it did to Ron is the most information we have on it.”
“I’ve read about these before,” he said quietly. “There’s a diagram in one of our records; I’m fairly sure it matches this exactly. I can check it out later tonight.”
Everything in him willed him to stand up and walk away, to throw something cutting and cruel at Malfoy and leave. Old habits die hard, and Harry was more shocked than he would have thought to see that look on Malfoy’s face once more, when he’d thought it was gone for good.
The look on Potter’s face froze him solid. In the span of an instant, the cheerful, jovial expression melted away to leave something unrecognisable in its place.
“Harry’s working on getting a program going with Hogwarts,” he said casually. “She’d be able to join the Herbology classes as well if she was interested.”
Potter’s eyes widened just a fraction, and then he set the quill down on the countertop. Draco’s cock already pressed against the front of his jeans, though his mind still hadn’t quite caught up to his body. His thoughts were racing, screaming at him that this was a bad idea, that he would regret it later. Not in the morning—god, no—not even weeks down the track, but months later when everything fell to absolute shit and he realised that the sex had just complicated an already messy, messy situation.
“Shall I summon them? So we can make absolutely sure we’re doing it right this time? You could say a
Harry pulled back and checked his watch. The others had long since gone home, wishing him a happy birthday and hugging him close—even Parkinson, who he’d noted with a grin had gone home with Ron and Hermione.
Draco’s mind was thrown back to sixth year and the Vanishing Cabinet. He knew the kind of pair Potter meant. He hadn’t needed to create an echo from scratch, but he had used one to enhance the attraction of the second cabinet so that they both reverted to using the connection between them instead of Vanishing things to unknown places. He’d made it brighter, stronger, faster.
Potter, it seemed, had not been lying. Days swirled around them like dreams, and they broke into the unbreakable, stole the unstealable, and destroyed what should have been impossible to destroy. Draco’s hope grew, even as the aura of despair and disaster thickened. There was a difference, he found out, between the despair of leading a life you did not want, and of leading a doomed life that you did.
He finished styling his hair, deliberately ignored the worn expression that stared back at him from the bathroom mirror, and left for Pansy’s party.
They crept around the sleeping cage of peacocks and down the passage to the conservatory. As Draco tended to his orchids, losing himself in the familiar ritual of checking every leaf, Potter leaned in the doorway and watched him.
If anything could make me stay here, in England, it would be you. Merlin knows how or when that happened, but I know it to be true, just as much as I know our friendship would never happen. It’s been years since I last saw you in person, but the papers tell me enough. Is it strange that I feel happy for you? To see how much you’ve accomplished?
They spent two weeks working on Potter’s proposal to Robards. It wasn’t enough to simply protect at-risk families, not if they wanted to achieve Potter’s ultimate aim. By protecting them, they would be singling them out for special treatment. Draco didn’t have to think particularly hard to know how well that knowledge would be received by pure-blood families who believed they were entitled to something more.
“After your argument,” she continued, ignoring the less-than-subtle looks she was being given by Granger and Weasley, telling her to cease and desist. “Did you smooth the waters?”
Is that the excuse you’re using for this terrible handwriting? I’ve known you since you were eleven; you needn’t bother.
He sent an owl back with a letter he’d written and rewritten a thousand times. Finally, playing it cool, he’d said only:
He cleared his throat and took out his toolkit. “Since I’m inside its defences now, I should be able to get a little further today. I’m hoping to locate two pressure points, maybe even three.”
“Nine. And remember how the three of them got together and rigged the karaoke machine so that it played nothing but 80s love ballads, just before they blackmailed us into going up on stage?”
The quiet sounds of the night faded away, overtaken by the memory of Potter’s voice moaning his name. It was over in minutes, his legs tangling in over-heated bedsheets as his soft whimpers filled the room.
An owl hooted, startling Harry out of his languor. Night air washed over him from the open window as he reached out and took the letter it offered from the bedside table.
It was the only human contact Harry’d had in weeks. Longer. Call it a reckless indulgence, since they could still catch it from each other; he lingered anyway.
Draco slid his lips up Potter’s thigh and bit down, grinning against his skin. “Like it rough, do you? You should have said.”
He felt Malfoy’s hand making small circles across his hip bone, and without meaning to, he moaned. He’d never before wanted anything as badly as he wanted Malfoy’s hand on his cock right now.
Potter tilted his head to the side, studying him. Then he shrugged and turned back to the feathers. “You wanted to know why I’ve been on your property after midnight?”
Something warm and soft curled in Draco’s chest at the way Potter was looking at him—gentle, almost affectionate.
As a teenager, he supposed, he wasn’t forced to sit through the wizarding equivalent of an HR “work appropriateness” lecture, including the awful “get to know each other” questions nobody but the Ministry lecturer thought were fun.
When he entered the room, he found Potter already sitting cross legged, staring mutely at the circle and presumably waiting for the potion.
The words were innocent, but something about the way Potter’s lips looked as he said them, the way his eyes were bright with ambition, with justice, made Draco’s knees weak. If only they meant something different.
“Mate.” Ron reaches across the table and grasps Harry’s wrist, forcing him to look up. “We’ve been through this.”
“If that’s what you want.” He reached into his pocket and drew out the folded sheet of parchment with the list of names he’d compiled for Potter. “If you decide you change your mind, if you want to see someone and start on the road to healing, here’s a few places you can begin.” He refused to look at Potter as he set the parchment down on the bedside table, tucking it beneath Potter’s wand. “The one at the top is the lady I first saw. Talks a bit too much, but she helped me open up.”
He studied his own face in the mirror for several minutes before turning out the lights, searching as he often did for signs that death had come for him as it was knocking for his father. There were no visible markings, but Draco could feel it lurking in the shadows all the same. He had two more debts to pay. This curse was one, and Blaise was researching the final, the hundredth, the one that would free Draco and let him finally rest.
“I know! This is awful!” Draco wiped happy tears away from his face, unable to look away from the sight of the egg-covered kids.
Nothing had changed, but there was an undercurrent to every word, every action, that made Draco aware of the layers he’d never known existed. A sharp smile when Ron mentioned his childhood suddenly had new meaning. When Granger asked what everyone’s plans were for the upcoming War Memorial Service and Potter fell silent, letting the wave of chatter from Weasley and Pansy take over, Draco thought he might be beginning to understand why.
“Can’t reach it though,” Harry pointed out, wrapping his arms around his stomach against the change in temperature.
Draco’s shoulders itched. Just the thought of that Veela landing on his property made him want to rake his claws across its face. Nothing was allowed here, near him.
“About yesterday,” Draco said, trying to work out how exactly an apology to Potter should sound. By all accounts, it was unfamiliar territory.
They stopped trying to be quiet. Potter’s moans had an edge of violence to them, though his hands on Draco’s skin were gentle. Distantly, Draco could hear how his own voice sounded—weak, lost. The conversation below them stuttered into silence for a fraction of a second before the sound of incredulous laughter floated up around them; they’d been heard. Draco didn’t care.
The look Malfoy gave him spoke volumes, but when he responded, it was timidly, like he was admitting something private: “I think it would be easy to convince myself it hadn’t really happened if it was just for the summer.”
“So, are we opening it or not?” George asked, looking back and forth between them with no small amount of apprehension.
It was remarkable, how easy it was to use the veil of professionalism to mask even the most long-standing of disagreements. He just had squash the tiny part of him that said the day was only worthwhile if he’d managed to insult Potter in three different ways, and remind himself that there were more important things than winning. Apparently.
Harry gaped at him, but he’d already turned away, was just about to Apparate and then Harry would have lost everything. He latched hold of the only thing he could: the truth.
“I’ve been thinking,” he said, taking a seat on the arm of the couch and drumming his fingers on his leg.
It didn’t matter that it had only proven his innocence, his complete lack of control in every part of that years-long nightmare. It was his, his soul stripped bare, and Potter had read it all.
“Sorry. She just gives me the creeps. I met her at the bar, and it wasn’t until she kept dropping strange hints about potions in the mail that I realised it was all her—the letters, the lockets of hair, all of it. I didn’t know Pansy knew her.”
“I'm sorry, Harry. Fuck, I'm so sorry. I love you. I love us, everything about us. I love our routines and predictability.”
“Because I don’t know what’s Fate, and what’s me.” Potter understood him anyway. “I need to know it’s my choice. Everyone keeps making choices for me, and I need this one to be mine.”
“I’ll leave you alone,” the nurse said, patting Draco on the shoulder with a kind smile and leaving the room.
“That’ll be George and Morgan,” Potter said, leaving the workroom to go open the front door, as if he owned the place. “I asked them here so that if something went wrong when we opened the box, they could get help.”
Draco snorted. “My how things change,” he muttered, part of him wishing dearly for Hogwarts and lazy Sundays spent witnessing Potter and Weasley’s absolute inability to do any of their own homework.
“What was all that about?” Harry asked. “I’m trying to understand what happened, but I can’t make any sense of it. Do you want space?”
Potter gripped his shoulder, fingernails digging into Draco’s skin and his face pale with fright, but before he could explain what the fuck had just happened, an odd sense of calm descended over Draco. They weren’t alone.
Potter looked up at him, and for a moment his eyes appeared dead. “I trust you,” he said, his voice filled with a sincerity that was at odds with his expression. Then, he added, “It doesn’t mean I have to like you.”
A gentle hand squeezed his shoulder. The hand began to pull away but paused, hesitant, and then trailed down Harry’s arm and slipped around his waist. Harry leaned into the touch. He had no idea what he was doing, no idea at all, but Malfoy’s head came to rest against his neck and he found not having any idea could actually work out after all. Sometimes it was about trust.
When he felt Potter grow hesitant, pulling back with a question in his eyes, Draco gave himself over to the sensation. He reached for Potter’s shoulders, gripping them almost like he was about to shake reason into him, and pulled him into a kiss so violently they nearly head-butted. Potter laughed against his mouth, surprise and pleasure and desire all wrapped up in one small, breathy sound.
Wind hit him abruptly, throwing him off course, and then everything shifted. He perched atop a chandelier and stared down at a familiar scene—one he had lived before from ground level.
Potter’s answering smile warmed him far more than the Firewhisky that already thrummed in his veins.
The house-elves had brought in several tea trays overflowing with sweet cakes and pastries, and the pot of tea seated between the two of them was already half empty. He tried to contain his smile as he wandered over to join them.
“All right, let’s try again. But not my dreams, this time,” Draco insisted, shuddering as he remembered the moment Potter took his wand. Seeing it again had awoken something deep and wretched inside him, and even knowing that this moment had somehow caused Potter’s magic to irrefutably reject him, he couldn’t bear the thought of seeing it for a third time.
Potter didn’t sound like he was even aware it was trauma. He sounded like he thought it was fact. Like he still believed the vicious words that had been said to him all those years ago. That explained why Granger wasn’t much help to him; this was just the Potter she’d known all along. A little rough around the edges, a little over-emotional, but competent and strong in spite of it all. He’d been like this since they were children; Draco didn’t blame Granger for being unable to see it with fresh eyes.
“Not a whit,” Draco agreed, moving to the centre of the room and taking his toolkit from his pocket. “I don’t suppose you know anything about watches, Potter?”
?” which Harry thinks is grossly unfair because he can’t remember how to string two words together any more.
“Sorry,” she said, sounding anything but. “It was just a little unexpected.” She held out her wand in a questioning gesture. “May I?”
of curse, but it’s still a different curse, just like you and I are both human but different. Unless we can complete the original identification spell, our memories are gone. I’ll have to set entirely new wards and change over the Pensieve.” He shrugged. “But the curses should look the same at their core, so we’ll still see what it looks like, and once we disarm this one, it will be exactly as if we had regained our memories. I doubt anything particularly important happened during the last few days that we didn’t record.”
He met Harry at the door to the change rooms, not that the kids were using them today. Those who had Quidditch jerseys had come dressed in them, and Draco had the feeling the parents would be putting up a fight to get them to change back out.
“Good. Which is why I want to tell our friends. My friends, at least. It’ll just make it much easier and I don’t want to have to sneak around and hide you.”
“Sore,” he finally said with a wicked grin and a subtle wink, just as the bartender was walking away.
“Long day?” he asked, looking for all the world like he didn’t actually care about the answer, and Harry bared his teeth in annoyance.
The thought of taking Potter in his mouth made him weak, but at least he would feel as though he had some measure of control over the situation again. At least when it was Potter writhing like this, Draco could feel like he wasn’t losing it.
“Thank you for helping us out, Draco,” Granger said, essentially walking up and kicking the elephant right in the leg.
The dark magic spilling out of Hogwarts had already spread as far as London, and they were still no closer to finding its source. The school had been closed for a week, and the air of doom and unhappiness stank out the walls.
“It’s a shame we won’t ever get our memories back,” Potter said, taking another large gulp. “I don’t suppose there’s any chance that the identification spell will just think it’s the same box and pick up where it left off? Since it’s the same type of curse?”
“What type of arrangement are you considering?” Draco asked, leaning back against the bench. “The beginning of the relationship is going to be the hardest part to pull off, since they’re going to suspect something like this after they all laughed themselves stupid at the prospect the other night. Ideally, we’d have to begin the process of infatuation in front of them, but I don’t know how good an actor you are.”
“Oh, nothing much.” Pansy waved her hand in the air. “Just an explosion or two and the near destruction of the Granger-Weasley partnership.”
Draco recalled the conversation, and Weasley’s insistence that Potter could prove he was better than the Unseen Hand—presumably of Fate—and wondered whether that meant Potter wanted to fight the prophecy or change it back to what it was. What would it mean for Draco if he did either?
to make us angry . You said it isn’t a curse , well, I believe you… this is more than sentience. This is personality. This is need, drive,
“Thank you. I… yes. I will.” He frowns suddenly, eyes dropping again to the sweet wrapper on the floor. “Why didn’t it do anything?”
“I’m buying tea,” Draco said, figuring that if he kept his sentences as short as possible, he couldn’t fit any accidental insults into them. “Would you like some?”
Draco felt the weight of Potter’s admission settle against him. He wondered if anyone else knew; he had the strangest sensation that he might be the only one. Potter’s eyes were too heavy, too bitter, for this to be something he was comfortable admitting.
Draco leaned back against the lockers and just let Harry’s words wash over him. He couldn’t keep the dopey smile from his face, so he didn’t even try. When Harry finally turned to face him, surprise registered on his face for a moment before it was replaced with heat.
The atmosphere was relaxed, teasing, and that alone would be enough to unsettle him because this was
Until the room descended into chaos and Draco would have given anything to have the silence again. They were shoved out of the way so that tests could be run for spells and curses. Draco didn’t bother to tell them it was useless; he didn’t want to give anything away publicly, and he didn’t think he was capable of speech anyway.
He had to get off the bed briefly to root through his trousers for his wand, and when he turned around again, Draco had slid down so he was at the edge of the bed. He was watching Harry with obvious desire.
“Doesn’t look like it,” Harry mused, running a hand idly along Draco’s lower back. “That, or these kids are new.”
when the rest of the world had always been so quick to tell him what he was without ever wanting to know… That hadn’t changed, not even a bit. Not even at all.
Despite their strange, new comraderie, Draco won’t tell Harry why he’s here or how long he intends to stay. Every time Harry asks, Draco’s eyes slide away and he changes the subject with a deftness that is directly proportionate to how many mimosas they’ve had.
Draco laughed, forcing it to come out louder and more certain than he felt. “I guess Unspeakables don’t know everything then, do they?”
“And if this all turns out to be some elaborate plan to win that drunken bet,” she said sweetly, “then I’m going to castrate you.”
Potter turned to him in horror, but then his eyes fell on Morgan and Draco knew he’d seen it too. He staggered to his feet but seemed to lose all momentum as he stood there, just staring at her.
with his awful questions about what they did in bed. Like it was any of his business.” She turned back to Harry. “Of course we’re not going to ask anything like that. Unless you want to talk about it, of course.”
“Did you know that toddlers learn to mediate their strength at around the age of three?” he asked lightly as he opened the door to a Potter that smelled just as strongly of a liquor cabinet as he had last night. “I knew you were developmentally delayed, but I had no idea it was quite so bad.”
Potter looked as though he might be about to say something profound, but then he licked his lips and said slowly, “I made a mistake.”
“I’m not a bloody idiot, Ron,” Potter hissed into a device on his wrist. Draco hadn’t noticed it before, assuming Potter was simply wearing a watch. “I know there’s something bigger at work here. I’m not going to fall into it just because it’s knocking on my door.”
Then the figure disappeared. When Draco woke in the morning, he would have forgotten it had ever been there.
Slowly, he began to remember everything he’d felt standing with Potter in this space yesterday. He remembered Potter’s confession—why he had become an Unspeakable—and the strange truce they had formed. It was like waking from a dream and realising everything you thought you felt was wrong, different. Except this was the dream, and out there was real.
After a moment, Potter pointed silently at the top most page of the open book, where a diagram of the metal inhibitor took up one corner of the page. Draco read it quickly, sucking in a breath as he did so.
At the sound of another enthusiastic moan from the other rooms, he gave Harry a wry grin. It made his face seem different, like a Malfoy that Harry might have imagined in a dream once.
“I hardly think, given the urgency of current events, that we would have wasted our precious time within the trance on… this… unless there is something grossly important that we have overlooked,” Draco said, refusing to look at Potter.
He holds back a sigh, since he doesn’t want to bring down Draco’s mood with his, and he’s only being picky. So what if the wizarding world doesn’t bother to actually understand him, to care about him at all?
He said his goodbyes, ignoring the way Granger studied him, the shrewdness to her gaze. He didn’t have time to dissect it, didn’t even have the energy to begin. He had a meeting to get to, and then, tonight, he had a party.
The door opened and the bustling sounds of Diagon Alley filtered in, accompanied by a young child talking excitedly and a harassed-looking witch trying to juggle multiple parcels. With a jolt of shock, Draco realised it was Hermione Granger. Well, Weasley now, he supposed, but she would always be Granger to him.
He stared at the letter for a long time before he opened it. His hands shook a little and it took him several attempts just to break the seal.
Draco snickered into his wine, and just like that the soreness of Ron’s coma had passed. They settled into safer topics—the shop, Draco’s work overseas. Draco found himself enjoying both the wine and the company far more than he had expected, and by the time he was ready to go he was surprised to find the last patrons were leaving as well.
Draco pressed into the wall and bit down a whimper. When Potter slid his trousers and boxers slowly over his arse and he felt the cool kiss of wind against his skin, he couldn’t help but let out a gasp. Potter smiled against his shoulder, warm lips pressed into the hollow between his neck and collar.
When the family had dispersed, Draco asked the nurse if he could speak to the Healer in charge. He felt Potter join him as they were led down the corridor to a small office, its door decorated in festive tinsel and marked with a wreath in the centre.
When he’d suggested they do this, he certainly hadn’t been prepared for the actuality of it—of any of it, really. At that moment, however, he couldn’t help but think that it was one of his more brilliant ideas, and for once, he was glad of his habit of speaking before his brain could catch up.
“We don’t hate each other anymore!” Potter said, pulling a face. “We’re sitting here together right now, aren’t we?”
He doused the flames with a poorly aimed Aguamenti, soaking the walls and half the window, and held his glass out for Pansy to pour him a new drink.
Potter turned gratifyingly pink from the top of his hair to the dip of his collar bone. “I’m going to use the feathers to track down whatever Veela I’ve pissed off,” he mumbled, unable to even return the barb.
“He’s awake and doing well,” a pleasant voice interrupted them, and all the conversation fell quiet as the family turned, as one, to the nurse.
He penned a quick note to Potter to let him know they’d start at midday tomorrow, set it on the table so that he’d remember to owl it the second he woke up—Potter would be asleep by now—and went to bed.
Draco blinked at him. He hadn’t even thought about afterwards. Hell, he’d barely even caught up to the present. But if he’d had to think about it, it wouldn’t have even occurred to him that Potter might kick him out.
“Oh, Merlin, they’re delirious!” Weasley snorted. “Quick, let’s get them home before they try to snog and end up stabbing each other with dessert forks.”
The wind ruffled the curtains, slipping through the cracked window as Potter mixed together various herbs from Draco’s collection. When he handed the glass to Draco, it was almost domestic this time, two companions sharing a drink.
The dishes, now that he was paying attention, floated in an orderly line, one by one, in front of the sink. This allowed the mops enough space to go wild—and that was the only word Draco could think to explain what they were doing. Each mop had about one third of its original strands to offer, and they made up for it by approaching the task with five times the necessary vigor.
Blaise laughed. “I’m telling you to take the smartest option. Make him listen to you. Be persuasive.” He lifted his eyebrows suggestively before turning solemn once more. “Seriously, Draco—this has to stop.”
If he fails this, he might lose Draco all together. And no matter what he thought before, that there was no solution within his power to save them, he can’t bring himself to let go.
As he sat there, goosebumps tingling along his forearms from the adrenaline that still coursed through him, he felt the unfamiliar swell of a new emotion. His thoughts went back to how Potter had been before the family walked past. Potter probably hadn’t noticed, but half the guests in the bar had their eyes on him, and it wasn’t because he was the Boy Who Lived.
Potter reeled. “Okay,” he said slowly, holding up his hands. “It’s okay, I didn’t realise…” He stared at Draco, edging backwards.
“What do you think is going on?” he asked. “McGonagall’s put me in here with Malfoy. We’re just about to go and make a switch.”
He stepped closer at Malfoy’s beckoning, until he was between those slim thighs, looking down on Malfoy as if he was a prize, watching as he brought himself to full erection.
Malfoy’s eyes flashed with desire, and they moved together, not as one, but mirrored. He leaned forward to whisper in Harry’s ear.
He did, however, have a painful mixture of conflicting memories. Everything from the dream-state came flooding back, slotting into space his brain hadn’t known was there.
He realises that if he had looked closer at Draco instead of getting caught up in his own head, maybe he could have seen it coming. Maybe he wouldn’t have missed the insecurity that he should have known was there. But his own fears prevented him from that—fears that Draco had no way of predicting. He draws Draco closer and decides that it’s time he let Draco in on them, before they find themselves in another mess like this.
“I haven’t thought of anything like that since Fred was around,” George continued, stepping away from Morgan and gesticulating widely. “Do you think if we did away with the fairy boxes and based it on Undetectable Extension charms instead, it might hold better?”
“Erm, yes. I don’t really know how to say it, so it’s probably best if I just come out with it all at once.” He took a deep breath then, steeling himself for their reactions. Discreetly, he felt Malfoy’s hand press against his back, a sign of encouragement. “We’re together.”
Potter’s face twisted into something close to fear at the same moment Draco recalled the way the two of them had left off in the real world.
Draco didn’t know what to say to that. “But what about Weasley and Granger?” he found himself asking.
Occasionally, the music buzzed through him in a particular rhythm that made his mouth go dry and his eyes search for the exits, but he wasn’t the only one. He would be alone, drifting, for only a second, and then Ron would see, rest a hand on his shoulder, and together they’d come back from that hidden place inside them that was more terrifying than dying had ever been. Or Hermione’s hand would suddenly be in his, leading him onto the dance floor and holding him close until the sound of the music drowned out everything else. Or Neville would suddenly be at his side, trying to teach him how to do the jitterbug to deep house music that thudded somewhere inside his chest and laughing, laughing, until they fell in a heap on the dance floor. And he did the same for them.
“That Lucius is dying.” Potter waved a hand vaguely to encompass Draco’s person. Draco glanced at the mirror, and saw both the Veela in him and his own father, alone in his chair by the Manor fire, and he understood at once that they were still in the dreamscape. They were still dreamwalking. “Same way as you will, if you don’t pay off that debt to Fate. You’ve got one more debt to pay, one more reparation owed, and it’s apparently this curse, and we can’t figure out who you owe it to or what it demands of you.”
He shook his head, clearing away the maudlin thoughts before they overwhelmed him. It would do no good to stew on it tonight, or any night. But maybe… maybe he’d reached a point where he needed to talk to someone. He was in too deep already, and he badly wanted a second opinion.
Blaise raised an eyebrow at that, but nodded along. “You were definitely doing it in seventh year. I remember the first night it happened, it was strange as anything. You were in your bed, but a silver cord connected you to this creature swooping outside the window. Like you were dreaming it, but the dreaming made it real.”
“Is that all right?” Malfoy asked softly, his wand still hovering in case Harry wanted him to undo it.
And when it did, when people started freezing up with no guarantee they’d ever heal, when everyone he knew and loved was in danger once again, it was like… a sigh. His brain had sighed, almost with relief. Not because he wanted this, but because this was what he’d been waiting for—the threat that loomed and loomed and never arrived. It had arrived. And now he could at least deal with it.
Potter pushed away from the bench and grabbed a hold of Draco’s white scarf, leading him into the bedroom. It was bizarre—he shouldn’t have the space to think of anything else—but even as he followed, hands running inside Potter’s shirt, mouth leaving a trail all across his neck and shoulder, he found himself noticing small details about the flat and thinking about how he was going to change them the second Potter gave him free reign.
“Oh!” he says out loud, his brain latching desperately onto the only silver lining it can find in the form of one piece of the puzzle slotting into place. “
They fell into silence, only broken by the cricket that still chirped in the background, though now he was joined by another, and the two sang in tandem.
liked it. It was better than I ever imagined having someone else’s hands on me might be. I liked it when we got into a rhythm together.” His face felt hot at what else he had liked, but he wanted to be honest,
All they knew now was that he was safe and they would be able to see him shortly. It seemed Healers had a different sense of time, though, since they’d already been waiting over two hours.
that your complete inability to trust I’m a capable human has given the game up before we could even begin.” Potter shoved his glass away and glared at Draco with disgust.
I often find that humans are contradictory, nonsensical creatures, and both parts of Draco’s mood are likely true. If you stay, you will be pushing on a boundary that might affect his happiness and well-being. If you leave, you might deprive him of what he truly wants and needs.
Draco took a moment to be annoyed that he couldn’t even properly savour the fact that Potter was, for once, asking his advice instead of jumping to infuriatingly correct answers.
“What was that spell?” he asked her, trying to catch his breath as he practically fell into the room. “I’ve never seen such a time delay!”
“He makes me happy,” Malfoy said simply, as if Ron hadn’t just insulted him and Harry hadn’t just defended his honour and also used his first name in perhaps the first time in his life.
He was surprised that Malfoy was so bold when he was so hesitant to sleep with Harry, but he liked it.
They were going to talk about it now, it seemed. Thoughts raced through Harry’s head. What did Malfoy want him to say? What
The nurse smiled at him. “In that case, please come through. The rest of you will be able to visit shortly.”
was likely the main event. Draco had no way of knowing how much longer they would have to spend in the dream-state, identifying all the constituents of the curse. With any luck, they were close, but he didn’t
“Yeah, I think our best option is to talk to the Veela. When I cast this spell, the feathers will create a vortex to heighten your Veela strength, and you can reach out for a parley. Much simpler than my initial plan, which was to hope I found some feathers once used in its nest and put a tracing spell on them.”
that for sure, and whoever was sending these items wasn’t showing any signs of stopping. They could keep going at a snail’s pace and hope that no one else got hurt, or they could ward the chest and open the box.
Potter’s eyes caught his. “I don’t know,” he admitted. “Maybe because I don’t want to repay you. I needed that wand, and I wouldn’t take back what I did.”
There was a truth in it all; this was how things were. Harry was sorry, and Draco was sorry, and they had been for years. They simply hadn’t yet accepted it.
“Let’s just see how it goes this time,” Potter said, sounding as hesitant as Draco felt. “And we’ll make a decision when we come back.”
He waved them off as they Apparated away, and then began trudging through the drifting snow back to his apartment. It wasn’t until he was halfway home that the rest of George’s words filtered through, and he staggered to a halt, propped up against a freezing lamp post for support. What had Potter said about him? George hadn’t been talking about his work just now; he’d been talking about
“I know that it’s because you’re trying really hard to show me now, but I never noticed how funny you are when you want to be, and how kind you are no matter how much you try to hide it. Kind to me, anyway, which was a surprise. And,” he took a deep breath, forcing himself to look Malfoy in the eye, “and I’ve been falling in love with you all summer.”
“Well,” Ron had the grace to look abashed. “Yeah, I don’t know what she was thinking when she pulled this, but surely you can talk her out of it?”
The flames died, and Draco stumbled backwards in sudden exhaustion. “What in Merlin’s name?” he muttered weakly, clutching his head.
“We all lost something in the war,” Blaise said thoughtfully, dark fingers tapping on the edge of the table as his eyes slid away from Draco to stare into the distance. “It stands to reason that Harry Potter would lose the most. But there’s more to the story, isn’t there?”
“Not well,” Potter admitted. “They keep blocking it at every turn. I’m starting to wonder if it was a bit naïve.”
The walls seemed to fade around him as Potter kept speaking. He’d heard about the Horcruxes. The whispers had spread after the battle, no matter how much the Ministry tried to keep them contained. He’d never fully believed them.
She smiled sadly. “Sorry, Harry, Draco. I have to go. I know where they’ve taken him, and only I can get him back.”
“It will feel better if you slow down,” Draco said, fingers tracing idle patterns across the arm of his chair.
He trailed off and finally looked up, his stomach sinking at the depth of compassion he saw in Blaise’s eyes.
When had it become acceptable to make jokes with Potter? But that wasn’t the half of it, because inside Draco was seething with a turmoil of emotions he couldn’t name. He remembered the anger and bitterness that he felt outside of the dream-state, but as the minutes passed it was being overridden by the increasing sense of warmth and tentative curiosity that seemed to define their relationship in this space. He wondered if Potter felt it too.
Draco paused for a moment, and then took a seat on the floor in front of Potter. It would seem he wasn’t the only one suddenly all too aware now that the danger was real.
Granger rested her hand on his shoulder, squeezing gently. “We know that, Draco. Both things are true, do you get what I’m saying? I’m not consumed by guilt—I accept the factors that led us here and forgive myself for what I couldn’t do—but I also regret how things played out. I wish I’d done more.”
His eyes widen as he remembers Malfoy’s parting words, just before he left the Ministry that afternoon.
He wasn’t sure Potter was even hearing him—was even capable of hearing him. He kept speaking, saying useless words that meant nothing, everything. He wasn’t even sure what he was saying, knew that he wouldn’t be able to recall it once it was over.
“The inhibitor was found just under Mr Weasley’s armpit,” the Healer informed them. “Quite easy to miss in the initial testing. We’re lucky we found it when we did, as I’m certain it was responsible for the febrile convulsion. Typically, we see them in children rather than adults, but as we know, this is not a normal case. As soon as it was removed, Mr Weasley began to respond to treatment—rather quickly, I might add.”
“I suppose not, but you’re all twisted up in knots. This anger isn’t new.” Draco surprised himself by realising he was right.
Potter still smelled like alcohol, but it wasn’t anywhere near as bad as yesterday morning, and Draco ignored it.
Draco’s fingers, wrapped around the pot of pink powder, felt strangely numb, like he was floating a few inches above himself. “We’re not quite there yet,” he managed, his voice rasping strangely.
“Come on, Potter,” Draco breathed, his voice a little shaky. “You’re all over the place tonight. Are you sure this is a good idea?”
He cracks an eyelid. What in Merlin’s name is a shooey? A crowd of lads in their twenties are circling around something by the water, and Harry climbs back onto his feet to investigate. When he gets close enough to see—one of the lads immediately draws him in with an arm over Harry’s shoulder like he’s one of them—he realises they’re surrounding another bloke who appears to be drinking something out of a shoe.
“Do you want to look at the curse one more time before we go to the shop?” he asked, keeping his voice careful and polite like Potter was some wild animal that would attack at the sound of sarcasm.
They sat on the other end of the couch, Malfoy by the armrest so Harry was closer to Ron and Hermione.
It was like a bucket of ice water had been poured over Draco’s head, shattering the moment. He forced himself to pay attention again.
“I didn’t say I wasn’t interested.” He ran the tip of his quill idly across his chin as he studied Harry. “I’m just surprised you suggested it. Just to be clear—this is a convenient arrangement, nothing more?”
He broke off and pulled away, the moonlight striking his face in just such a way that he looked struck with awe. And then Harry realised he was, and the thought made Harry’s stomach flip with something he’d never felt before.
discount the importance of your own feelings. If you do, that’s when it’s going to go downhill. You can’t save someone if you have to destroy yourself to do it.”
He brought a bottle of vodka over to the couch and used it to wake Potter by way of knocking it into his ribs.
“Yeah.” Potter laughed again, more relaxed this time. “Fucking barmy, right? You’re the last person I’d ever expect to get infatuated with me. You scared the crap out of me for a second there.”
His face flushed with warmth as he waited for Potter to say something about his choice of location, but Potter only looked over at him and smirked. Draco’s cock stirred at the sight.
His face transformed, the shadows fading away and leaving laughter in their wake. Draco’s knees felt weak, and he steadied himself by leaning casually against the wall to avoid making it obvious.
“Yeah,” Weasley said, still looking at the space where Potter had disappeared. He looked like he was about to say more, but he fell silent.
George stuck his head around the door, grinning when he saw the two of them. Draco felt strangely off balance when he realised the smile was equally intended for him as for Potter.
Draco spluttered. “How can I trust someone who looks like they want to stab me the second they’re offered a sharp object?”
“Right then,” she said, twisting her expression into something fierce and slightly terrifying. “Time to go deal with the stalker.”
He pushed the thought away and focused on shovelling as much food into his mouth as he could before the plates disappeared. By the time he’d gotten through two full helpings of pancakes smothered in syrup and cream, along with a hefty side of bacon, he’d managed to forget the whole thing.
I’m not entirely sure what to say. I don’t recall writing you a letter, though the amount of torn up parchment I woke up to that morning is beginning to make an awful amount of sense. What did I say?
Potter began to mumble a number of charms under his breath, firing off tests across every inch of space he could reach, and Draco followed suit. Before long, a picture began to emerge. It wasn’t a map, like Draco had hoped, but he hadn’t really expected one.
,” he groaned. “Why do you always have to be such an arse? I meant about us. I want to tell them about us.”
“He’s right.” Granger grabbed hold of the table and pulled herself back onto the bench, nodding across the table at the two of them. “Even excluding how viciously you both hate each other, neither of you possess the maturity to carry out a relationship together.”
Malfoy nodded and they left the low, smoky lighting of the club for the clear starlight of the back alley. No one came out here—there was a better alley around the corner that people used for smoking and getting off, full of dark corners. This one was too long, filled with rubbish bins and the sound of night creatures scurrying across the roof.
Potter looked at him funny. “Well, not till after dessert, yeah? Have to let them pick up the cheque first.”
He didn’t know if Eleanor still practiced here. She might not even be in the country anymore. But she would get his message and know where to find him. Hopefully, she would be able to see him despite the short notice.
“I want to come out to my friends. Our friends,” Harry said apropos nothing as they were cuddling in bed one evening.
“Yeah, it was much simpler than that: you’re Veela.” Potter huffed a laugh, a tinge of pink blooming in his cheeks. “Who knew?”
?” he breathed. “What in Merlin’s name does that overblown, sorry excuse for a mystery have to do with anything? It was just some drunk wizards out for a joke on the Muggles, I guarantee it.”
“This is going to be brilliant,” Pansy enthused. “Please do try. I can’t wait to watch you attempt to make it look real.”
They eye each other, wary and reluctant, but the uncharacteristic openness is still there between them. It gives Harry hope.
I followed Draco Malfoy to France—long story—and he’s acting really weird. He sent me to this café he used to go to as a child, but he wouldn’t meet me there. And then he told me some story about growing up. It was a sad story.
“Well, to be fair, the feathers are more about the wands and my magic’s… weirdness. They probably have nothing to do with the curse.”
“It was a convincing act,” Draco said carefully. “Quite convincing, actually. Are you sure there wasn’t some truth to it?”
Harry was struck by the notion that he’d never before heard Malfoy express anything bordering on restraint.
“I didn’t realise your Veela heritage was just dormant. I thought the line had faded completely in you.”
“I know,” he says after a moment. “But, he’s Draco Malfoy, Ron. He’s used to glamorous parties and expensive holidays. I mean, the Prophet was open to the society and gossip pages; what if he’s bored of me? What if he misses the world I dragged him away from?”
“No, well.” He took a sip from his cold tea for something to do. “It was just a thought. But I’m not your type, I take it?”
“I figure if we’re going to do this whole friends with benefits thing, we should probably talk about it. Things we do and don’t like so we don’t end up doing something one or either of us doesn’t enjoy.”
“Do you—” Harry started, trying to think of a way to phrase all the questions that were running through his head.
Granger laughed. “This family has a tendency to breathe life into things.” Draco didn’t miss the gentle reverence to her tone.
“George!” Potter yelled, running to the centre of the red circle and falling to his knees, scrabbling around across the floorboards as if he would find George hidden in the wood.
“’Cept Malfoy’s,” Ron said with a grin once everyone had tossed back the shots, the liquor burning warm in Harry’s stomach. “I reckon you could do with a bit of dragonpox.”
“A miniature one!” She clarified. “And modified to sing a terribly rowdy version of God Save the Queen as it went.” She gave an affected sigh. “My brother likes to tinker.”
“I’m joking, for Merlin’s sake. I’m not going to—” He ran a hand through his hair, his eyes a little wider than usual. “This is strange, Potter, we both know that. But… I’m here, I’m willing, and…” The careful, guarded look that Harry was so used to dropped completely away, and he was left with just Malfoy. For a moment, it was breathtaking. “And I don’t know what to do.”
Evie’s eyes widened, an almost painful level of hope taking over her face. “Really?” she breathed. “That would be amazing. I just hope she wouldn’t feel too out of place, you know? It’s hard being different.”
“Not quite.” Draco took the wand and slowly started to transfer each hair into the vial, a thin golden thread looping from the tip of the wand to each hair, pulling them forward one by one. “Unicorn hair isn’t pure by nature: it desires purity. It consumes it and absorbs it into its very core. The second the hair is taken from the unicorn—or found separate, like this—it begins to lose that quality and becomes vulnerable to external influence, for lack of a better explanation.”
“I didn’t—” he began, and then tried to think how to phrase ‘I didn’t mean to leave you out’ without sounding like a twat.
Harry frowned. He knew Malfoy was only being dismissive because it was a stupid exercise, and he was confident from Malfoy’s responses that he was more than happy to have Harry in his bed, but something about the flippant way that Malfoy had used that knowledge, their experiences, to dismiss the question bothered him.
Harry held the parchment up to Malfoy and watched as he scanned it slowly, eyes darting across the page, back and forth. He reached the bottom, looked at Harry, and then read it again. Finally, he said, “You mean words? All put together like this? One after the other? I know it’s a notch above your reading level, Potter, but do give it a try.”
“I’d have to get your shirt off first to scratch you,” Harry points out before giving up and just Vanishing the whole thing with a flick of his wrist.
Something shattered. Draco whipped his head around to see the glass all along the balcony doors was lined with cracks. When he turned back to Potter, Potter’s fists were clenched with rage and his breathing unsteady.
Just before it hits, his eyes fall on an empty sweet wrapper on the floor. It is innocuous enough—a brightly coloured square of plastic like any other—but Harry recognises it instantly. It matches the one in his shirt pocket, the one he can feel crinkling beneath his fingertips.
As he mulled over what he’d seen, he realised that something about Potter seemed different, and just as quickly he realised what it was. Although, then he wondered if it wasn’t different at all, but rather that Draco simply had never noticed it. Either way, it was obvious now—how Potter leant into the conversation, his entire body revealing what he tried to conceal with humour and casualness. The curse revealed it: Potter was lonely.
The instinct to take the words back immediately was almost overwhelmingly impossible to beat back, but he didn’t. He’d said the words now, and even as he cursed himself internally and felt petrified by fear, they were out there and he wasn’t going to take them back.
Draco realised he was nodding along uselessly, and he made himself stop. “We have to find out what the curse is. If we can identify it, we can understand what it’s done to him.”
“Well go on then.” Draco gestured, lifting his eyebrows. “Fisticuffs, wasn’t it? That was your plan?”
Harry edged awkwardly into the room, noting how it appeared Malfoy had been sobbing face down into his pillow, judging by the wet patch on the white pillowcase. Long streaks of pale skin stuck out beneath the blotchy redness of someone who had been crying for a very long time, and Harry no longer questioned himself when he felt the urge to take Malfoy in his arms and hold him. He just did it.
He ignored Potter’s snort of derision and began to pack up his tools. “I’ll begin the map tonight, but I’d prefer not to try dismantling any part of the curse until we see what all the layers can do.”
Draco gulped and nodded. “I want to keep up this charade, since it’s the only thing that makes him happy.”
Then, thankfully, the weekend came, and after breakfast, when they were sure most of the castle had vacated on a trip to Hogsmeade (notably Ron, Neville and Hermione, who were most likely to interrupt them), they holed themselves up in their room with the strongest silencing and locking spells in their combined arsenal.
He closed his eyes and thought, but all he could see were strange flashes of clockwork and one very clear, very intense image of Potter staring at him like he had that night, but in a different space entirely. The light was gentle, softening Potter’s features and making his lips look full and dark, but Draco had no memory of this and it was giving him a headache just trying to hold onto the picture.
one in an embarrassingly long time. The only possible way that I could have this is if something happened in the last twelve hours and I
She took a seat opposite him, set her blank sheets of paper and pen down on the table between them, and smiled. “You look well,” she said, regarding his choice of clothing. “Tired but well.”
Kalen’s eyes snapped open. “I’m stuck!” he yelped. “I can’t get away! They’ve caught me, Morgan! Help!”
“Excellent,” Ron said, grabbing Harry’s wrist and dragging him a little closer to him and Hermione. “You can join us. Otherwise Hermione’s going to spend the whole time going on about whether or not we can submit a dual essay for extra credit.”
The first time Harry took his hand while they were walking out of the Great Hall, where anyone could see them, Draco’s whole body stiffened in shock. But then, slowly, he forced himself to relax, and when he turned to smile at Harry, it felt like the room had suddenly grown both lighter and warmer. After that, every time Harry looked at him, there was a secret smile on his face. Harry was fairly sure it looked exactly like his own.
They all said goodnight, and, quicker than Harry felt was fair, he and Malfoy were alone in the room again. Now that it was silent, the noises coming from the other room were louder. Harry was furiously glad that he couldn’t identify the voices.
Potter’s chest was slowly turning flushed, and there was a small furrow between his brows as he tried to maintain a steady, controlled rhythm, but before long he propped himself back on his left hand, slid his right palm across Draco’s aching cock, and began to thrust properly.
get something in return. It’s a partnership program, just like the supplies. Pure-blood families volunteer to work with the at-risk families to apply the potion-based wards and tailor a plan to suit their needs. All the Ministry needs to do is come by and approve it at the end, which will ensure no corners were cut in the application of the security spells.”
A handful of tears fell, but that was all that Draco allowed. Then he wiped his eyes with the sleeve of his suit jacket and straightened up, giving Blaise’s hand one final squeeze before he let go.
“Of course.” Potter’s easy acquiescence was disturbing. “Any ideas so far what kind of curse it is?”
Nonetheless, he grabbed either side of Draco’s shirt and pulled him up into another kiss so he could finish unbuttoning and pushing it roughly off over his shoulders. He felt Draco gasp against his mouth, and he couldn’t contain a smug smile as he pushed him back down and made short work of his trousers.
Draco didn’t mean to hunt down Granger; he was only heading to an appointment in the Ministry. Though, if he was forced to be honest with himself, he could admit he’d taken a small detour on his way there. Several small detours. Early.
Potter wanted something, and with the cold certainty of a dream, Draco knew it was something that would end this whole wretched business once and for all. But Potter wouldn’t take it. He just stood there, consumed by the thought. Wanting, wanting, wanting.
Potter laughed and took the bottle, pouring himself a new glass and raising it in the air. “To true love.”
He spotted Draco immediately and hurried over, resting his hand on the shoulder that Weasley wasn’t currently holding.
“It will change in a second,” George said, and before Draco could ask what he meant the curtains fluttered and the room turned to stone.
Potter’s face did something complicated, like he needed to smile but he didn’t want to, and the whole thing annoyed him. He settled for frowning instead. “I’ve been meaning to ask, what’s with the peacocks?”
It was such a strange moment of calm between the two of them. Unlike any they’d had before, and yet so normal it seemed like this must be how they always were together. Why had he never taken the time to get to know Potter?
“What if it doesn’t work?” Potter asked, his finger tracing an idle line around the lip of his glass of scotch. “What then?”
Inside, it was wholly different than he had thought it would be. It didn’t feel silken or velvety like he’d read in his strictly less than scientific research. It was warm and wet and squishy. It almost reminded him of the time he’d stuck his finger into the middle of Dudley’s water wiggly out of curiosity.
Potter groaned and pushed up into him, and Draco gave up the tease. He hollowed his cheeks and swirled his tongue, and all the while Potter’s hands ran over Draco’s hair, threading through and falling away like he was too scared to grip tightly. With a groan, Draco reached up and grabbed Potter’s wrist, shoving it roughly into his hair, and Potter grabbed hold so hard it hurt and came with a shout.
Harry woke up with a scream lodged in his throat. That hadn’t happened since Voldemort, and it was with a resigned sense of familiarity that he stared up at the ceiling and waited for his breathing to slow.
Draco bristled, swirling his wine in his glass and staring down into the whirlpool of red. “I bare my heart to you, and you call me idiotic. Merlin, Potter, what a wonderful soulmate you are.”
“Against all odds,” Pansy went on, her lips quirking into a reluctant smile. “You two are good for each other. I never would have believed it, but you seem to be in the depths of a healthy, mature relationship. Congratulations, boys. Shall we head to
The thought echoed in his mind, seeming poignant in a way that he couldn’t place. For a moment, he had a fleeting glimpse of a wall filled with gears. He shook his head, clearing the confusing image away.
Harry shakes his head. “He didn’t have to. He didn’t say anything. He couldn’t give me one reason why he keeps trying to
Draco led the way to the artfully arranged seating in the corner and settled back to survey the room. Something about Hannah’s reaction was bothering Draco, but he couldn’t put his finger on what the issue was. In lieu of an answer, he propped his chin on his hand and studied Potter, taking in the harsh lines of his face—how they seemed so much starker than they had in his youth—and the way his eyes skittered between the door and windows and back again.
