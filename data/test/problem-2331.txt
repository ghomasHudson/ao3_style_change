“Even if it
Malfoy hums lightly, a hand tipped to his mouth in thought. He pages through the file again, pausing on the medical report included by St. Mungo’s.
“Or not,” Ron adds decisively.
He stands, sidestepping the astonished girl, and throws a friendly wave at Madame Rosmerta as he leaves out the front door. He’s tipsy, maybe more than, and doesn’t even notice Ginny’s followed him out until he feels a friendly hand on his bicep to slow him down.
so. I think I’ve had a heart attack.”
“’Famous, not-so-tall but definitely dark and handsome Harry Potter? The only way he’s not tied down is if he’s a bachelor by choice…’ That’s the word in the break room anyway.”
Harry takes it and waits a moment to let go. “Draco said you were looking for me yesterday.”
“It’s just overnight,” Draco entreats. How has he gone from trying his best to get Harry out of the house to begging him to stay?
“But you’re not—“
“Don’t open yourself up too early, keep your position closed while you start to figure him out.”
“Can’t fault him.”
Potter gifts him a short smile, perhaps the first he’s earned, and Draco ignores the ways his eyes also widen for just a moment in fleeting surprise.
One of his eyes is purple, stark against his pale skin, and there’s a thick cut across his temple. When he looks up and meets Harry’s eye, there’s only a tired resignation in them. “They’re not ‘supposed’ to arrest you with false evidence either,” he says dully. “But clearly anything goes once it’s on paper, so perhaps the arrest rules were too specific to hexes and not fists and boots.”
round?”
“Just about your dad, and Harry’s. And their mates.”
“I thought I was a Muggle, so it felt normal to me.”
When Harry leaves for the Ministry, Draco moves his operation downstairs. He pushes the coffee table out and sits on the rug with his back against the couch and his papers now at eye level, his legs stretched out under the table.
(See the end of the chapter for
He gets to his feet slowly, carefully, turning back to the desk. He considers the very real fact that this is Potter’s fault. He’s never usually this distractedly sappy and retrospective. Only upon seeing—
The more he considers it, the more it seems like a great idea. He hasn’t gotten to see Teddy since his birthday dinner. Draco can come. Andromeda is, after all, his aunt.
“That’s a yes, then,” Harry breathes.
Eventually, though, about a year after the NEWT’s, he traded one hermitic residence for another, spending most of the first year of a mastery at Hogwarts either in his private rooms or in Flitwick’s classroom. It was this return to the warmest home he’d ever had, though, that began to coax him out and take down his defences, and he soon found that he worked best happy—he was far more successful than he’d ever been cooped up in the Manor.
On the edge of the grass, though, he can see Harry trying to levitate just Teddy’s shoes and take him with them, and it’s too endearing to interrupt so he stands for a moment with his fists in his pockets, trying to pick Ron or Hermione or Dromeda out from the crowd outside.
That telltale jingle sounds and Powell hurries through with his arms full. “Here,” he says. He drops all the goods at Harry’s feet and steps back. As if Harry could even begin to solve this.
Draco’s eyes are on his, words whispered in deep interest. “What?”
trying to figure out what connection you’d have with any of the Aurors… Deciding how unlikely it would be for us to have an Auror on staff in 2007 who’s still a Death Eater sympathiser. Willing to go after anyone who seems to have wronged your family. No offence.”
“That’s big to you? Me lending books?”
nice.”
He’s never accepted an event invitation as fast as this one, especially when it came directly on McGonagall’s stationery. In retrospect, he wished he’d seen a Mind Healer after the war instead of relying on Dreamless Sleep to a dangerous degree. Now the nightmares are just few and far enough between that it to go to one feels like overkill. But if it helps other alumni changed by the war, he’d certainly give the speech a hundred times over.
“Yeah,” he murmurs.
“You need more than me, you need your friends.”
The furniture is a dark wood, as antiqued as the rest of the rooms, with another desk by the window. Harry wonders if there’s a single room in this flat that Draco hadn’t transformed into a workspace. If he had his wits about him, he might realise that the bed’s not made, but rather hastily tidied; Draco had been sleeping.
The temper Draco thought Potter might’ve abandoned in adulthood is flaring up. His body had tensed significantly as Draco chewed him out, and by now his chin was high, jaw firmly set, eyes dark. Eking out such a reaction sends his heart fluttering with a thrill.
Harry helps her to her feet, slowly, transferring her arm to Ron for support.
There’s red spotted on the carpet, trailing all the way to the bathroom, where it looks disturbingly like a crime scene.
, I—“ Draco’s arm is still shaking when Harry gently but urgently takes it. “Y-Yes, okay, yes. Erm. Okay.”
Something crosses his face maddeningly slowly, until it’s transformed through shock and acceptance and into complete enjoyment. He breaks out into the smugness Draco had missed earlier. “I
Asia chapter is dedicated entirely to the Potters—not just mentioning them offhand in reference to another topic. It still awes him to see just how many books at least mention his family. How many times had he been to the Burrow and never known his family history was sitting on the shelves right by where he ate? It’s more jarring still to see his name in text:
“Lucrezia is in,” Yolanda suggests, pointing back to the other office behind her desk. He sees Murray’s number two look up at her name. Harry considers it seriously; she’d gotten all the case paperwork and had hand-delivered the last evidence to him, so she must be up to speed. More than that, she’s actually agreeable.
Harry groans. “Merlin, he’s gonna be unbearable.”
Harry nods, face screwed up. Draco watches him remember his earlier advice and relax the tension in his body. He feels a surge of fondness for Harry’s skill at taking direction. He’s a fast learner. A good student.
“Aren’t you on the assignment?”
discover?”
The first afternoon that he’d braved knocking on Draco’s door, he thought he would surely turn him away. But he invited him in, sceptically, and at least found Harry untroublesome enough not to oust.
“A good opportunity to leave us the second the Boy Who Lived finally wants you,” she teases.
Leonard blinks once in allowance and Malfoy thanks him, stepping even closer. When he begins fumbling in his pockets, looking satisfied when his hand reemerges with change, Harry’s forehead creases in confusion, but relaxes when he efficiently transforms a sickle into a small spoon.
“My work,” Draco offers helpfully, to Harry’s surprise.
“As much as I would love nothing more than to shirk my obligations and finish some unfinished business, I have work and I still need to go home and change.”
“Anti-nausea,” he says. “George taught me… in our early twenties. A life-saver.”
“I’ll need to get permission from the object’s owner, but if they allow this, I think it will be perfect for the opening chapter on light charms.”
“France?!”
“Oh, I… read,” he replies daftly.
“Those girls look like they’d

Harry has stood and walks over to glance through them too, before picking up the Plato on top of the pile. He jokes, “What, no Shakespeare?”
, you know, I’ve been meaning to ask—does he ever read poetry?”
“You’ve been here for an hour and a half and you don’t try to say a word to me?” he starts in right away.
” Blaise balks.
“Are you hungry?” he asks, deciding the best way to shake his gloom is routine.
This is, possibly, the most idiotic and embarrassing part of the story, and he says it in a fast mumble under his breath, grimacing. “All those talks about accepting each other, he thought I was talking about his sexuality and I thought he was talking about my sexuality.”
The last questions that had swirled around his brain just before he finally fell into a fitful sleep had been the most innocent:
“Did you… need me for something?” Harry asks. He sets his bag on the floor beside him, leaning his left shoulder against the locker to face Jack.
, why did neither of you ever mention her
“Oh, Merlin,” Draco whispers.
“CAN’T YOU DO
people will know you’re a Gryffindor. You’re Ron Weasley.”
Harry dog-ears the page and closes the book solemnly. His hand runs through his hair, and he tilts his head up tiredly with his eyes closed. “Look, do you want me to go?” he asks into another sigh, eyes still shut.

smart, the way he thinks and his work ethic… He’d learn anything you threw at him. Just… thoughtful and kind and smart and everything I never thought he was.”
“Is the sausage still warm?”
“I think you’re the person I’ve needed for a long time,” he murmurs.
I may have been inspired for another tale halfway through writing this one, so if you're interested in more feel free to subscribe. I'll tease a bit—Harry and Draco as a long-married couple, two love stories running parallel in time, Draco, Ron, and Hermione as close friends, and no doubt a mystery... Now to write it!
“That was PURPOSEFUL contact with the chaser!” Weasley yells, turning to her like she’s the referee. Draco sees the words “I know” on her lips, then something longer, entreating him less tensely, now rubbing her hand up and down his arm with affection. He shakes his head and points to the radio once more. Granger shrugs, looking over her other shoulder now for backup.
“Er, so… how’s the case looking?”
Watching him interact with children fills Draco with a dangerous fluttering feeling, so he preoccupies himself with lightly kicking the rusticated stones of the apothecary’s façade. When he turns back, they’re running off towards their mother, who Harry waves at with a smile.
“Alright?”
Ron holds his hand out and shakes Draco’s firmly, and then they’re alone again.
She frowns at him, looking like she wants to ask if he’s alright again, and takes the book from his lap, pointing to a picture. “Henry Potter. His friends called him Harry. He’s your great-grandfather.”
while we start some leads. You can admit it looked bad.” He speaks lower, and Harry leans back in disgust as he moves in to whisper closer. “He’s not exactly been a fervent supporter of yours...”
“It was two days.”
Harry’s aware that he can be… romantically clueless. Especially when he’s distracted as he’s been all week. It certainly hadn’t registered until this moment that casually confirming that he was gay last week could change things with such an old friend.
“Feeling a bit better?”
“Less than ten hours?”
He’s sure that his face is fully red as he gestures to the living room couch. They’re friendly, but they don’t talk appearances anymore. They’ve both changed, since they were together. No one looks the same at twenty as they do at twenty-seven.
“I don’t usually let it get this long,” he’d replied.
“Hm,” Harry hums. “Well… I don’t—I swear, if he comes back and is angry that I’m not here, when I was here—“
“This is tough,” Pansy says. “I think often relationships that develop from friendships require more conversation during that transition than those who begin from acquaintances or strangers. That’s a dynamic attempting a
Harry, who’d crawled back onto his stomach during Draco’s rumination, turns and sits up again to face him, hands clasped together around his folded legs. His brows knit in confusion.
Something strange happens to Harry after work. He stops outside the Ministry and feels a strong desire against his better instinct to go not towards home, but to Diagon Alley. There’s something he must do that he’s been putting off long enough.
Draco sits stiffly, waiting with bated breath. The office always smells enticingly like nicotine, always cold. It’s Monday. He was early, and she’d been just as unenthused as if he’d been late.
Draco smirks into the potion, back turned. The concoction is thick like a smoothie but smells nothing like, and Harry’s face twists in revulsion when he finally takes the offered glass. He gives it a sniff.

“I… hated him as much as two teenagers can.”
of different shapes and colours…” comes a voice diagonal to him, sarcastically slow and soft as if speaking to a child.
“Oh dear,” Draco says. “This makes it all look rather dramatic.”
. You took me to bloody India, that’s not—“ He closes his eyes and takes a deep, settling breath through his nose. When he speaks again, it’s slower. “It’s just funny how I’ve spent these last months defending you and
The frog had been forgotten immediately in the enticement of shopping. Harry had held out his arm and whipped Draco into the bend of space, landing them behind a Muggle street in North London, across from a small storefront called Manticore Fight Store. The outside was painted a dark, intimidating black, but inside the light from the large store window filled it with brightness. Its graffitied walls were covered with boxing gear, clothing, hand wraps, and shoes and in the back stood a display of several pieces of equipment, including hanging and standing bags.
“Thank you. I… I like ‘mint gum’, too, still,” Draco finally whispers. “I think you could call me anything and I’d be honoured just to be addressed.” He falls back into silence, then after a beat murmurs, “Harry?... Harry?”
decided to start with a light charm,” Marta says, crossing her arms.
Once or twice, Harry gave him extremely apologetic eye contact, and he did his best to convey that he doesn’t care. That someone who checks every box in Narcissa Malfoy’s list of qualities for a perfect son-in-law would be someone he doesn’t wish to be with.
He doesn’t smell like himself, Harry discovers with a frown when he joins him. He smells like St. Mungo’s, like soap and someone else’s laundry. When Draco’s arms close around him tightly, he’s not sure who’s comforting who.
Harry’s face is pinched up, frowning, eyes shiny, but he doesn’t look angry so much as hurt. And it’s because of that pained look that Draco instantly throws out all the nasty things he’d thought to say back. He has no words that won’t hurt Harry more than he already has. It’s not self-preservation but deep care for the other man that leads him to pick his coat up and turn to the door.
“Yeah.”

“Who said I needed
like something someone would—the kind of thing you’d know. While you’re at school. Younger. I would guess.”
“I see you, Pans, take it easy!” He shouts back right as the crowd roars, startling him into checking the score curiously. The England v. Scotland game is playing with commentary over the speakers, but besides some patrons crowding around the large speaker behind the bar, everyone’s eyes are glued to their tables.
Harry frowns. “Erm, I think? He tried to lend me a poetry book once. Why?”
“Working on it, Marta.”
A sharp clatter shakes them out of their conversation. Draco’s spoon has hit the ground loudly and suddenly, and he scrambles for it hurriedly, leaning under the table and then setting it beside his bowl with strangely wide eyes.
“Ah,” he says faintly, taking another sip of wine.
Harry sighs and focuses his attention down where his hand rests on Draco’s leg instead of making eye contact. “You’re going to ask for details past this and I’m not going to have them,” he begins. It makes him tense up.
Harry hums. “It’s nice to get away.”
“Mm, not likely. Past early evening they almost always throw in the towel. I think they’re scared of the dark…”
These days, remembering moments of hands thrown up and doors shut in his face in moments when he’s pushed too far, he’ll break into a sweat trying not to let his temper go in front of them. He goes out of his way to laugh things off, for fear that their resentment for the unhappy post-war Draco will return, irreversibly.

“I’m going to shower, if that’s alright,” Draco sighs.
Perhaps feeling the heat burning into the side of his head, Potter suddenly meets his eyes, smile instantly fading as if looks
“Mm, there’s a lot of great stuff up there,” she says, tilting her head thoughtfully, eyes scanning the frames.
Ron steps all the way through. “Mm. Anxious?”
“Here, love,” the barista says. She’s set a plate and cup in front of him, and her voice brings his eyes back to hers, smiling as he hands over a couple Sickles.
, so I reckoned…”
The book Draco had given him a while ago was something called
“Alright, well… if it eases your fears, Molly’s made you a jumper. But you didn’t hear it from me.”
“Don’t worry about the papers, I’ll fix the papers. We need to get to St. Mungo’s.” Harry says the last bit to Ron, who’s moved closer and is levitating the lilies away from the rest.
“I’m not naked, for Circe’s sake!”
It lingers in the air where Malfoy left it. Harry devotes more attention than necessary to the evidence box in his hands. Then, he shoots out a grunted farewell and disapparates with a loud crack before he can’t bite his tongue any longer.
A cabinet in the kitchen slams shut as they stare at each other.
He shakes his head nervously.
He rolls his eyes.
“You don’t remember that name?”
Once in a blue moon, when Pansy is this close and this gentle, he misses it. It’s easy to forget that they’d once been an item—he loves her, but she’s often so loud and boisterous that he feels nothing but relief to have that in the past. They’re incredibly comfortable together, but a craving for the familiar isn’t a good enough reason to return to something they know they hadn’t been right for. Better as friends had been the motto for almost thirteen years.
“Well, no, but you have money,” he’d offered, half-joking.
“Like you were saying at the gardens. Morbidity.”

There is no malice in the shushing, just the familiar quieting he’s received more than a few times when he got too chatty as they worked. He’d learned not to fight it when the other man was in a rush of inspiration.
“That’s it.”
He digs around for more of those Muggle pills, then makes quick work of setting the wards up. When he leaves, it’s with a sense of peace for the safety of Harry’s home and a note scrawled with his and Ron’s moves to play through again someday less busy.
“I’ve been thinking about Grimmauld Place, too,” he adds. “The more I think about family… Going back with you made it seem less daunting to reconsider moving in. It’s a bit sad, thinking of it sitting there and gathering dust.”
“You try for her, then. I told you, I’m not looking to meet anyone tonight.”
“Sit,” she says, and when he does they both sit shoulder to shoulder on the coffee table facing him. Hermione’s dressed for the day, dungarees and a jumper, and Rose, too, is in a little dress and tights. She bounces Rose on her knee distractedly, mostly biting her lip and glancing over at her husband. “Go ahead,” she whispers.
“Amazing,” she sighs, closing her eyes and dropping her head back against the plush chair. It seems, to Harry, that her work never slows. He stopped questioning it a while ago. She gets defensive. He imagines it must be hard to draw the line and decline any cases when it’s all for the greater good.
A beat, while he considers ignoring him completely. Then he says, “Suppose.”
Instead, he shuffles to his bed and undresses lethargically before nudging Dante off his pillow and crawling in, thinking, as his eyes fight to close, how silly it was to keep a nemesis.
There was a feeling of guilt that laid over their interactions, on Draco’s end at least. It was like a mist that he had to squint through to engage in friendly banter, and it stayed until a week into their new routine. Harry had withdrawn from the reading chair in gallant surrender just to lay on his stomach on the rug and complain that Draco hasn’t gotten a second chair yet. From his newly-won perch in the plush seat, he reminds Harry yet again that there’s a chair at his desk, but he insists that even the floor is more comfortable than that arse-killing antique monstrosity. Draco laughs, genuine and untroubled. Harry sticks out his tongue. Draco throws his quill and hits him expertly, dotting his face with ink and sending them both into a fit of laughter.
“We were just in the area because Ron needed to get some books for Hermione,” he blurts, hit with the sudden urge to explain his presence in the neighbourhood. He stops short of insisting that Spoonfuls was Ron’s idea.
, and they’re at St. Mungo’s now.”
He hesitates for a time, careful not to think for so long that the moment passes, then meets Teddy’s eyes across the table. “Er, you know… you know it’s possible to want to meet girls and boys? Like how I loved Ginny? But perhaps now I want to meet some nice blokes.”
It’s been a long night, but this is one of his favourite Dracos; mischievous and sparkling and confident. He lifts his elbows out of the way of Draco’s working hands, and lets the other man do all the work.

*****
In the momentary quiet that follows, he ducks into the closest doorframe—the kitchen—and presses his back to the wall. His breath is forcefully slow to remain calm, his ears listening closely, and when he hears another footfall he spins out and aims a second spell, just missing by a hair. He ducks a fiery red shot, then returns another stunning spell and a disarming spell in a flurry that both miss the retreating figure. He shifts back into his doorway.
“It’s just been loads quieter at home since he left for school. I’d hate to live with him again.”
Draco shakes his head and returns to staring at the wall.
Harry cards his hands into his hair, staring down at the notes with tufts sticking up in wild rows between his fingers. He shakes his head. “I’ll need wand information on all Aurors,” he mutters, talking to himself. “Were the other objects cursed just for the individual, too? Should we get you the other items back?” He looks to Draco.
He accidentally bumps shoulders with Draco on the pavement and pretends not to notice the entire arm’s length the man keeps between them afterwards, instead pointing out the bushes he’d gotten sick in on Ron’s stag night a lifetime ago. He
, Harry, let me stand. I’m serious.”
“Quick writing lesson for you,” Harry says breathlessly at the foot of the bed, his hands fussing with Draco’s belt. “
Perhaps this was them, he thinks. Perhaps Hogwarts had simply been their rising sun, and now he needed patience and understanding, just in time for the afternoon light to pass the mountain’s bulk and shimmer on the valley.
Ron tacks on, “He’s not being a prat about the gay thing?”
When they’re both finished, he’s reluctant to go. It’s nice under the warming charm, still hit by the occasional breeze under the shade of the porch, and he stands slowly.
“What is it!” he calls back.
Draco shrugs. His ankles sway back and forth, heels digging into the earth. They’re sitting close. If they both look at each other at the same time, it’ll be too close. Harry dares to linger, still, fixating on the length of Draco’s eyelashes in profile, the sweep of his hair, the cut of his jaw.
Harry looks up behind him and smiles instantly in greeting. He summons the other chair from the window, which Hermione falls into with perfect timing just as it settles next to him, like a trust fall. He reaches his hand out again and closes the door, shutting off any remaining noise from the party. She side-eyes his wandless magic, but just crosses her legs and leans back in the chair, smiling at Ron.
“I go every September,” Harry is saying, and when Draco opens his mouth to ask questions before he’s finished, he holds a commanding finger up in front of his face. “I didn’t see any reporters downstairs today, so if you don’t call ahead and tell the press you’re coming, you’re just fine. And it’ll be fairly empty—too early for holiday shopping, but all the kids and parents just went shopping for back to school. Plus, it keeps me honest; no relying on holiday-themed gifts as a catchall.
Draco doesn’t answer, but he steps aside for Harry to enter. He looks well-rested, though it may just be the brightness in his grey eyes or the clean cut of his clothes; slacks and a perfectly fit navy blue button-up. He looks effortless, and when Harry walks through he shuts the door and returns to the study without a word.
“I did, yes.”
*****
Ron looks excitedly at Hermione, who seems a tad more hesitant to abandon her friend. She glances between them.
“Just on tap, seemed safe,” Potter says, nodding to the pint and sitting across from him. “Sorry to interrupt your thoughts.”
“You always balance it out. Every tracking session is followed by fight training.”
“Not for the
long. What happened?”
“How is it?” he asks.
On the fourth floor, he thinks Draco notices his hesitation. There’s only two bedrooms on this floor: Regulus’ and Sirius’.
Draco gestures with his almost empty tea and a half-smile, but when he sees the look on Harry’s face he lowers it with sincerity. He reaches a dripping wet hand out of the tub.
Draco pulls on him instead of answering, drawing him back in and fitting their mouths together. Their bodies press tightly, no space left between them.
*****
“Hm,” Ron hums. He thinks for a moment. “I appreciated the apology, honestly. We could tell it was genuine, that he’s different. But you can be remorseful without changing your attitude. You can be rehabilitated and still be a prat. So what… I guess help me see. Hermione says she sees.”
The table is busy—Draco hasn’t eaten during the supper rush in weeks—and Pansy gapes when he asks Blaise about their Transfiguration homework. Blaise, good man that he’s always been, blinks in surprise but launches happily into not just an explanation of the assigned spell, but a longwinded complaint at Professor McGonagall’s expense.
“Does Murray have access to your floo network?” he asks the top of Harry’s head. He can flirt
Draco lifts an eyebrow. “Mm-hm.”
“Is fiendfyre hot?”
him.”
as McGonagall said.
“Ah… well…” He looks over at his friend, remembers his face thinner and younger and bathed in the blue of the Great Lake and how he’d lied to it. He crosses his arms and settles back in the chair. If he’s finally going to give him honesty, it’ll be a while.
“It’s Sirius’,” he says. “We traced all of Grimmauld Place and found it, and he went through the trouble of analysing it for me.”
Harry had traced the path of the pencil lines around the quote, imagining Draco circling them. He could see him from here, across the way from his seat on the reading chair. He’d gotten some work back for the draft of his new book and was covering the dining table across the hall completely with pages, biting his lip with concentration and muttering to himself as he rearranged the stacks of papers. His hair had fallen messily into his face and, more noticeable with the thoughts on Harry’s mind, his sleeves were rolled past his elbow.
*****
“I’ll try to stay out of your hair,” Harry says. It’s not bitter, or even that sad—a marker, perhaps, of their willingness for this time to be different.
“What’s in it?”
Harry nods.
“Harriet Potter, I will wipe your memory—I’m trained! I will—“
Draco’s expression of concern only amplifies, but he says nothing else, just keeps walking right behind him. They’ve made it to the front lawn when Murray walks up the path. He’s missed a button on his dress robes and looks incredibly flustered, but he pastes a smile on when he sees them coming.
The necklace has stopped beating.
“Was he your first… boyfriend?”
Harry forces the toast down in a handful of bites. He reckons the best way not to let something bother him is to keep up a routine, so he dresses for a run despite a deep desire to pull the curtains and get back in bed. There’s a nervous energy about him—adrenaline that’s been settling since Friday night, and he sprints all the way to the gym. It’s not until his face is red and his lungs are heaving before he’s even begun his workout that he realises this might have been overkill.
“I think it’s brilliant,” he admits a while later—Potter had gone on like the rush of a river, only halting when they got a bit peckish and ordered some food. Even then, he’d thought of something else to explain while at the bar and returned already barreling along (“And another thing,
Immediately, with suspicious hindsight, he wonders, had Harry wanted to do that just as badly or been swept along for the ride? Had his enthusiasm been embarrassingly prominent or just flatteringly so? Should he get up? Are Harry’s legs asleep?
Truthfully, he doesn’t remember much more. They all missed their Portkeys, but there were enough guest rooms at the chateau for them to each have two, and so he woke up tangled in Harry in France the next morning. Something had drawn him from his slumber sickeningly early, a knock at the door, and he pulled a blanket around his shoulders as he opened it.
*****
A list of questions, most relating to the practicality and possible circumstances of the curses, grow in his head. Questions for which Draco has the answers.
Eight years since they’ve spoken. He might be sick.
Her house is certainly lived in, and by a young boy. There are small shoes around, coats thrown haphazardly over the sitting room furniture. The untidiness of a happy mid-week home. He thinks Andromeda is off to collect Teddy, but she murmurs something about the kitchen instead and disappears in the other direction.
It takes him a moment to answer, but when he does, it’s directed at Pansy.
Thanks for reading!
, but it’s not something to pinpoint. You have a gay… je ne sais quoi.”
“Mm, hush. I sleep like an angel.”
Hermione crashes in, startling Harry, with two books and a first aid kit, and she pushes by Ron to stick a bezoar in Draco’s mouth. They all watch the black veins for a moment with bated breath.
“He cares about me. I don’t… I couldn’t tell you how equal it was. He doesn’t say anything like that, but I think-I think he shows me.” He thinks of dancing in the cabin, of the photograph on the bridge. Of his face in that basement, his face in the fire of the study, his face in sleep. He thinks of the necklace and the man who figured it out for him. He reaches under his shirt and pulls it out, lifting it over his head and handing the chain to Ron.
.” He opens his eyes and tilts his head back petulantly, looking past his nose at Draco. “It’s giving me the creeps.”
“I know what you angry looks like,” he supplies knowledgeably. “That’s how you looked at him.”
“I—there’s two,” he mumbles to himself.
Right now, for instance, Harry is bubbly, raving to Pansy, “Honestly, Molly Weasley loves your show! She’s always wondering whether you screen for the best questions or if you just get lucky.”
The toaster dings, catching Draco by surprise, but Harry doesn’t move a muscle. He’s starting to wonder if he’s not about to be framed for Harry Potter’s death, the way he’s folded unmoving at the table. Maybe he’d get time off his sentence if he’d at least been trying to make the man breakfast.
*****
His eyes are squeezed shut in concentration but they relax again as he self-corrects. After a minute, he opens the ornate glass doors and levitates a small vial out, presenting it like a proud student before Draco. He leans forward in his seat, closes his own eyes and hovers his fingers in front of the bottle. Suddenly, he opens them and smiles animatedly.
“We’ll just prove that someone else cursed the—“
“Back up, Potter,” he instructs mildly. Harry does, confused but compliant. He can’t imagine what he’d done wrong by standing quiet.
His eyes, though, are staring into Harry’s so considerately, waiting for his word, and his hand is warm and it’s nice, to feel connected, so he smiles. “It’s fine.”
“This feeling like—that we’re
Harry caught his gaze, shaking his head minutely even as his lips curled up. Ron put a hand on his back, thrusting him in front of the Weasleys and fully into Draco’s view. He looked impeccable. Tragically handsome. It should’ve ruined him, that beauty, made him incapable of continuing but somehow it bolstered him instead. He held those green eyes firmly as he pressed on.
“That’s it for me, guys. I’m sorry. I’m not mad,” he promises. He’s standing before he even registers it. “But I might be if you don’t stand up and let me out, Pansy.
He’d made it to Harry’s street, but couldn’t stop. He felt himself pulled past the door and down the street on a walk he’d made once before, to The Four Johns. If he didn’t have the guts to see Harry, he might as well try to connect with him just as Harry had described in the Mughal Gardens. Look through his eyes.
“Okay.”
“God almighty,” Harry sets his palms flat on the table and looks at Draco, eyes full and mouth creeping up with an idea. How had it not occurred to him? “I have objects. I have cursed objects and they’re yours, just say the word. Although, no, you’re right, what am I saying? I’m first in line to tell you to take a break, so actually—“
“You didn’t know till
He never has plans. Even dinner with Ron and Hermione, a weekly practice he’d slipped up on, has been put on hold by the hosts until Ron’s fully situated in his new job and hours. It’s not ill will—their friendship was so solid that a mince pie and a few words of apology this morning smoothed everything over. Just adulthood.
It was a chaste kiss, fast and gentle and barely touching, everything he hadn’t imagined—as he admittedly often did—it would feel like to be kissed by Draco. Even in an unfathomable moment, he’d managed to act more unpredictably than Harry had imagined.
“Ron, Ron, that is… usually I would be very interested, of course, you know I love Ginny.” Ron gives him an unfairly meaningful look. “But I’m not in the, er, headspace for dinner.”
His hands fumble undexterously at Harry’s running shorts, then feel a second pair of warm hands join him, doing the work smoothly, straightforwardly, and he has only a moment to regard Harry with the revelation that he’s about to be equally vulnerable before the hands move to his own hips. He raises them helpfully, then waits, breath held.
“Er, thanks for today,” he says, not sure what to say.
Hope you're enjoying! I've so enjoyed the comments, I'm reading them all!
Oddly, the work on the pages is pleasantly familiar to Harry, reminiscent of the kind of symbols and formulas he would look over and see when they worked in quiet companionship in Draco’s study. Occasionally, there’s a full two-page spread of Draco’s original handwritten notes and arithmancy for a spell. He feels an almost-affection for the recognisably loopy penmanship, shorter and more cramped in scrawling notes than it appears in Draco’s letters.
, hey, don’t touch me, I’m sweaty.”
a favour here. You should do the tracking.”
Beneath the surface, he’s astonished at the speed with which Harry’s picked up on the skill. The fact that he’s describing anything this solidly at all is impressive. It’s likely down to that raw power he’d like to eschew, plus a cleverness he doesn’t get to employ often enough.
The rush of joy he’d felt from his meeting with Marta and his presentation of the necklace to Harry is snuffed out. He knows the sacking isn’t representative of his professional capabilities, but that doesn’t stop his mind from whirring through the effects this will have on the case.
Draco charmed the page larger and used it for defence practice.
Thick politeness covered his fatigue. “Er, yeah, hi… can I help you?”
“No, I mean, I—We probably should’ve known when I called my first kiss with Cho Chang ‘wet’. But no, why?”
“Ah, nice,” Ron says, and Harry sees him glance quickly in his direction.
Ron shrugs. “Dunno. It was on Murray’s orders though.”
, but—“
She cocks her head, still staring vaguely at their hands, and chews on her lip. “You know you can tell us anything? Tell me anything? Life is complicated, it helps to talk about it.”
The breath is knocked out of him instantly as a tumble of long blonde hair attached to an old friend wraps him in a hug.
“It’s not,” Harry says gravely from where he still stands. In his periphery, he can see the interest on Pansy’s face.
She studies him thoughtfully, with a half-smile and a gentle pity that he’s letting slide because it’s been a horrible day and somehow still only noon. She takes his hand. “We’ll go together. C’mon.”
“You’re worried something will happen again?”
“D’you know all those nice words from your books?”
flat, soon to be
“The miracle of apology,” he murmurs to Dante, nudging him aside on the desk to set up a cauldron.
“You really should, it’s simple first aid,” Draco says, shutting his eyes once more.
“I don’t. But I should,” he braves aloud. “Would you want to come?”
Draco lets what feels like an appropriately long moment pass before whispering, “Your climax face and your magic tracing face look rather similar. Do what you will with that.”
Harry’s watching him flex and grunt into the impromptu workout of crossing the wide river. They bob high in the wake of motorboats, and sweat breaks quickly across his brow. Occasionally, he raises a sleeve to his forehead to dab it.
“I know my wife’s ethnicity,” Ron says sternly. “What I’m saying is, there’s—she has photos of her grandparents in Jamaica though, right? Immediate family. It’s… different.”
“You might convince me to be a guest lec—“
“You… don’t want to give me some kind of speech?”
“Tell me what you have so far, then. Case studies?”
“He studied here. His charms mastery? For a couple years?” She shoots him a kindly smile, then gives Neville her attention again.
“Harry—“
“No. Yes. I don’t know,” Harry grumbles.
“Fine.” Harry sighs. “Er, I was wondering, while I’m here. The tracking? Could we start that?”
“Love, no name leaves Harry’s mouth more often than your father’s when you two are together. Don’t you think it’s his turn?”
This elicits yet another eye roll, but Draco sits up, legs crossed, and faces Harry, gesturing for him to do the same. He feels a little ridiculous in a jumper and boxers now that they’ve climbed over the covers, but the silk pyjamas he’d borrowed felt equally embarrassing to pull back on. Draco holds his hands out palm up and Harry takes them.
Draco traipses back up the stairs slowly and sleepily, and after a few deep breaths, Harry returns the preface to the table, extinguishes the fire, and follows. The bedroom is dark still, and quiet except for Draco’s rustling as he tries to get comfortable again, and Harry almost misses the strange sound coming from the dresser he’d set his things on.
Harry laughs good-naturedly, because it’s performative irritation, and he’s learned to let it happen—it’s who Draco is, and it’s a part of him he’d miss if it were gone.
? Of course not. He loves his studies, but they consume all his time. He spent part of the weekend in a jail cell. He was hit with a Cruciatus curse just this morning. He doesn’t see his friends as often as he’d like. His love life is pitifully empty, per his mother’s observation. He has an opportunity to put his research into practice, but he has to work with Harry bloody Potter to do so.
It’s nice to be home, or in Harry’s home, even if he has no clue what they do now, as a ‘them’. He’s spent a week hoping he didn’t ruin things.
“Why the bloody hell didn’t you tell me when I was
“Thank you, Professor,” Draco says. He drops his knee and sits forward when the paper settles back before him. His eyes are already scanning his work, gears whirring.
They sit a while longer and watch the water quietly. The squid has disappeared, but there’s a school of fish that Draco’s eyes follow across the glass. Blaise rises first to make for the Great Hall and with his own stomach growling, Draco steels himself and follows.
It’s potentially the most articulate he’s ever been.
with you this morning!”
Harry has the briefest moment to recognise the surrealism of Draco Malfoy calling the start of a round in his Muggle gym before Lars begins testing the waters. He switches stance swiftly as Harry does, stuck in the early dance of a fight where both parties are yet to swing.
Harry jumps, half-dressed with his robes hanging off one arm. Ron’s head is grinning up from his fireplace, hair as fiery as the embers surrounding it.
In the bottom drawer of his desk are a bottle of firewhiskey and a couple of glasses, a single malt, from a distillery with only three employees in the States. Ron had surprised him with it the night they’d been promoted to full Aurors and they’d been rebuying the brand ever since. They’d cracked into it much more on late nights before Rose was born. He pours himself a couple inches—no, a few—and drinks slowly as he pages through his notes.
The locator tests had been an early success—both indicating Great Britain, and then again closer in on London. He couldn’t get much more specific than that. As for when the items were cursed, his attempts at a reliable dating charm had been abysmal, succeeding at nothing but filling the study with a strong scent of burnt magic. After the curse has been initiated, it seems, the spell is no good. He’s been trying to research an equivalent potion since, but so far no luck.
“You’re insufferable,” he says, letting them in. “You don’t think I know what you’re doing?”
“C’mon, Ron, your head’s not that big. Nothing wrong with shedding the Auror exterior for a little lunch break.”
“I love when you call it the ‘Gay Thing’,” he says, eyes narrowed playfully. “Makes me feel quite special.”
“I’m just not in the mood to talk circles with you. Tell me why you’re here and do it quickly.”
“You know, I could be your Mind Healer, too, Mr Perfect.
“Rasmus Neo’s pecs are a guilty pleasure, you mean,” Harry teases, a twinkle in his eye.
so he doesn’t correct him.
not going to shout. I think you've got the message.”
They struck up a new routine that week: Draco worked on the Ministry evidence quietly in the mornings, then some time after lunch Harry would spit through the fire hungry to practice tracing. Draco didn’t mind putting his work down. He enjoyed teaching. It made him think of Flitwick’s words on his last visit—how he’d retire if Draco took over—but this was only ever a fleeting thought.
it’s just around the corner,” he replies. “We’ve just started baby-proofing and she’s so frustrated. I keep telling ‘Mione, if we get her angry then she’ll do something magical.”
One thing might manage to distract him: his trip to Paris had been worth it, even if his mum had forced him into hosting his old potioneer friend back in Chalais long after he’d wished to excuse himself to the study and put the new diagnostic information on Black’s necklace to use. He hasn’t mentioned it to Harry—he’d looked so excited by the very prospect of answers that Draco doesn’t want to tell him about any progress until he’s figured it out completely. He’s optimistic that it’ll be soon.
The game is growing close—it’s only been in play for twenty minutes or so—and they make light conversation while mostly keeping their eye on the diorama. At one point, England’s chaser dives quickly down towards a dropping Quaffle and throws it towards the goal with a forceful upward toss behind her back. It puts them momentarily in the lead and the pub explodes.
“Well, of course. She’s not an Auror, is she? She didn’t sign up for something like that.”
“There was an emergency.”
He rolls onto his stomach, arms out by his head under the pillow, and turns his head towards Draco even though his eyes are closed. “Knackered. Full.”
“I told you to tell me if you could handle me, and you said nothing!” Draco argues, taking his turn to look shocked beyond comprehension. “I walked out! That’s splitting up!”
“I don’t think he needed a reason,” he responds calmly.
On the far end of the wall by the stairs is a motionless one—muggle photography—of a group of men and women in exercise clothes at the finish line of a marathon. He spots Potter there, a bit left of centre. They’re all frozen with their biceps flexed, but Potter looks much younger. He’s less muscular, less confident in the way he sheepishly holds the pose.
“It’s still
“Malfoy,” Harry confirms. The word feels foreign on his tongue when not spoken directly to Draco. “He lent me books—hey, now, what was that?”
When the door shuts behind them, he wants to ask what she told him about Sirius, about Grimmauld Place or his upbringing or Hogwarts or James, but Harry grips his arm vicelike and folds them immediately into space without looking in his direction.
It’s easy, here, in the bed with Harry. Laying on the bathroom floor in front of Ron and Hermione had been too vulnerable too soon—likely more vulnerable than he’d ever choose to be with them—but for him and Harry, it felt like the coup de grace of his guardedness.
Harry smiles softly. It’s enthralling as ever, these two Dracos. Increasingly, he feels like he’s not imagining that the second Draco, his favourite Draco, has been more flustered lately. He wants to speak to it but senses, as they both have before, that it’s a moment for silent companionship, so he pulls his book out and open, flattening the dog ear.
“No one ever tells you what to do when your curse-breaker’s been cursed,” Harry mumbles into his shoulder.
The house is lofty and shadowy and gloomy, still as aged as he remembers and filled with wilting wallpaper and antiques he doesn’t dare touch. There’s a layer of dust on everything to prove that Kreacher still spends more time at Hogwarts than he does on the property.
“How long have you two known each other?” he asks, intrigued by the notion that they might have a mutual acquaintance outside of school.
I'm not completely evil—how're we supposed to get to the love story if we don't spend time in the like story?
Harry crowds into the doorway with him, watches him whisper the spells, then laughs cheerfully when the door opens to a room twice as wide with padded floors and the punching bag fully hung. The desk is nowhere to be seen.
He feels Harry’s hands creeping impatiently onto him as they climb the stairs, and as he unlocks the door to his flat, they become incessant.
“Very,” Harry manages.
Hermione swoops in, a sparkle in her eye as she throws Rose onto her hip expertly. She’s in a beautiful maroon dress that’s wrapped effortlessly around her sandy-brown frame. Her tightly-curled dark hair is half tied back in a matching ribbon. In short, she was a vision.
“Go!”
“There are other options, none too preferable, which is why most dismissed associates just resign to the Obliviation. He’ll have to appear in front of a neutral Ministry jury to settle and prove that he won’t misuse the information. They…
,” he sighs, stretching his neck. The cavities of the couch weren’t kind to his body, but he’s slept, nonetheless. Sleepily, he traipses to the bathroom, uses the toilet and swishes some mouthwash and splashes his face with water. In the mirror, his hair is wild, and he runs his already-wet hands through it. The rest of his appearance isn’t such an easy fix, so he returns to the couch and begins to fold the blanket.
*****
“I’m just questioning…”
now, too, of course. Send us an owl if you need anything…
“I did not think I’d catch you like that,” Draco responds in apology. “I was—I’m so sorry. Are you alright? I just had to get away.”
Harry makes a thoughtful noise, then, in a quick breath, “Thank you.”
Harry stands in the doorway of the study, backlit by the orange glow of early morning shining in from the dining room. He can just make out his details; hair so unbelievably mussed up that for once Draco would agree that his daytime look is tame, eyes so squinted they’re practically still closed. He’s wearing his white undershirt—the jumper he’d arrived in must be discarded somewhere—his hands in the back pockets of his jeans, which hang carelessly low enough to show a thin ring of the waistband of his pants. Draco looks away politely.
“Missed you,” he says and disappears upstairs.
Draco sighs, “How did you survive the war?” still holding his arm. It’s centimetres from the skull, close enough to send a memorable shiver down his spine. He wants to put distance between himself and the cursed object—is starting to think he needs distance between himself and Draco’s entire study for his own safety. Another part of him wants to challenge Draco’s touch aversion more. It’s nice to know it doesn’t extend past saving him from undue harm.
The other man scribbles away from his spot on the rug, mumbling occasionally, sticking a pencil in his mouth, and when Draco calls him out on eating his writing utensil he just gives him a toothy grin, the pencil still between his teeth. It’s a lovely smile. When he looks away, Draco can’t remember the second half of the sentence he was writing.
What had happened to Harry between seeing him in Diagon yesterday and now?
Draco didn’t find it fair that his past had to be drug up when Potter made the news. They never printed about his charms mastery, his work on protection spells, his writing as it began to be published and well-received. Just the same old shit about housing Voldemort, and with no mention of the power he’d lorded over all the old wizarding families.
“It’s not demonstrative of your skill,” Harry is assuring him, face still filled with cautious concern like Draco’s a live grenade.
“So he just lets you be here alone?”
“C’mon, Harry, I’ll introduce you and—“
“Mughal Gardens,” says Draco enthusiastically, head swiveling to take it all in.
“It was a very important meeting, concerning the case’s progress, during which I asked for the other evidence back—remember? To see if you can find out whether it was triggered to curse specific individuals?”
“Oh, okay.” Oddly, at this confirmation, he moves his hand back to the scar, runs his fingers over it with gentle care, saying quietly, “That’s good.” Then, seeming to recognise the intimacy of his actions, he pulls back and raises his bare hand vertically between them. “Now punch me.”
“A wise man once said… I believe it was, ‘Fuck
Hermione grimaces. “You’ve had a really hard day. Sorry. Table that speech, okay? Think about it later, after—“
“You look heavenly.”
Harry breathes a careful breath through his nose. “I disagree. But different flyers will coach differently.”
“There is no reason,” Harry grunts as he lowers himself to the ground to look under Mrs Black’s former bed, “for one family to own this much cursed stuff.”
He’d also popped back through the floo to his and sent a note to Hermione, realising with a sense of remorse that if Pansy was calling Draco too busy lately and she’d at least seen him a time or two, his own friendships were long overdue.
the whole time… We should’ve discussed what it would mean and how to leave time for our work—See, there you go again,” Draco stops and tilts his head. “Every time we mention the case you go somewhere.”
. And she and Erin go at it in the green room. She’s yelling that it’s not professional to talk about employees like that, and Erin’s saying it’s not professional to yell at your boss, and then Georgia says ‘You wouldn’t know if I was a Dementor in a wig, because you haven’t had a soul in the five years I’ve known you!’ and then quits on the spot.”
He forces Teddy to stand while he applies some extra cushioning charms on the grass, then allows him to remount. They fly high and start diving down only two or three metres repeatedly, to practice the movement. It’s a while before they talk again.
“You’ve still got that cloak?”
“I guess I hit my stride. And Marta lit a fire under my arse. And it was more diagnostic than the cursed object chapters. No Arithmancy proofs.”
criticise my low self-esteem a few days ago, didn’t you?”
,” she says a minute later, interrupting Harry’s list of potential evidence in Draco’s favour. “Lucrezia Bode.”
He moves towards the edge of the bed, stands and stretches, making eye contact with a sour-looking Draco.
Ron leans over Draco and feels his pulse, something else Harry should’ve done already, then says his name a few times. He slaps his cheek, too, and Draco’s pupils shift, not focused on Ron but in another direction past him.
He stills at the kitchen counter, turns and fixes Draco with an interested expression. Then, almost prissily, he crosses his arms and tilts his head, inquiring him to continue.
“Er, no, it was definitely odd. Perhaps not if I hadn’t seen you prattle on like an old married couple just this week at Kanpai.”
“Yeah.”
His mother and father smile and blink up at him, as do Sirius and Peter, while Remus wiggles a finger at his infant form in Lily’s lap. They look young but tired. He might be imagining that his mum is holding him especially tight. It’s 1980. The war will be over next year, bookended horribly with death.
“Lovegood?”
sure you’re past your Dark magic days… But… it’s distrustful. To the public. A Death Eater who specialises in curses? Like having a Dementor as your Mind Healer.” He laughs heartily at his joke, ignorant of the two grim faces staring back at him.
Harry shoves his shoulder mischievously as he passes him for the stairs. Pancakes, he thinks. And coffee and maybe scrambled eggs. Afterwards, say goodbye to Draco and drag his feet to the Ministry. They’ll see each other tomorrow, hopefully. He’s halfway down when he hears the strangled cry, cut off so suddenly that it instantly raises his heartrate.
“Forgiven. I’ll never keep things from you.”

Pansy’s eyes are saucers, her attention wholly back on Draco. “A
“This would be just between us,” he says quietly. “And I’d appreciate it if you didn’t mention it in the office.”
He looks like he has more to say, so Draco stands patient, holding the plates. Harry’s biting his lip with the expression he has when he’s shopping through words, choosing carefully.

“I’ll go get something. What do you want?”
Harry frowns. “Well next time ask me explicitly what I think instead of just trying to read my actions.”
“You’re right,” she says. “Francesca, we’re off!”
“Spinach?”
He hitches a breath and jerks back, shrinking towards the wall out of sight even though he’s clearly been made. He’d watched the millisecond where Draco’s face swivelled to follow Lucrezia’s line of sight, eyes wide.
Draco steps further in, gazing up at the open beams, then over to the wood-burning stove and the large table facing the lake view.
“Ron!” he hisses, voice low in the light chatter of a nice restaurant. “I’ve been in
He stops his pacing. “Honestly, I don’t feel like I’ve got a handle on things right now. I’m not quite sure how I’ll react, you know? Once I’m in there. And it’s Draco’s place to tell them,” he adds softly, in case she hasn’t considered the need for discretion.
the cover says, and it’s strange to find him calmly fingering the page of a book rather than furiously reading through notes with a quill balanced behind his ear. Harry makes sure to sigh loud enough to make it known that he disapproves of not getting chair privileges before setting his dishware beside one of the chair legs and settling in. He uses the front rail of the armchair as a backrest, flicking
“Here,” he murmurs, looking towards one wall, and in his periphery, he watches Draco do the same and nod in agreement.
“You’re completely right. And we’ll do something just the two of us, yeah?” he suggests. “Ron can sod off and you and I will do whatever you want.” She bites her lip in contemplation while Ron looks deeply offended. “I can tell you about my research,” he adds. “On my family. Maybe over coffee.”
Pansy is laughing so hard it's silent, and her voice, when she finds it, is squeaky. “That beautiful woman—and he says no—“
Harry slowly sets his cup down on the saucer next to him, moving infinitesimally like someone careful not to wake a sleeping beast.
“THIS IS A MATTER OF MORAL CODE. TO CALL MY CLIENT IMPULSIVE AND CAPRICIOUS IS TO BE BLIND TO REALITY. HE HAS BEEN
Jack lunges first, instantly, thrusting his right leg out in an attempt at sweeping Draco’s, or at least to kick at his calf trying. Draco evades it easily with a chuckle that Harry matches from the bench. He’s sure they’re thinking the same thing—Jack’s fighting rashly, like Draco’s not going to be worth strategy.
And thank Merlin he got to it when he did, in the pin-sharp focus he was using to cope that morning, because a letter from Hermione Granger arrived with an owl he didn’t recognise in the afternoon and he took it so the bird would leave but left it sitting on the kitchen counter unopened.
means manageable.
“Morning,” he eventually remembers to return, kissing the top of Draco’s head. He’s not sure they spent a single night apart before their fight, but now the intermittent separations, through the day or overnight, make him appreciate these few minutes after waking together even more.
“At least the Muggle hospitals have a telly hung up, right?” he muses. “We could pretend to care about that instead of these blank walls.”
“Mmhm.”
The table is empty when he reenters—Draco’s moved out back to the porch, and when Harry joins him with their lunch he thinks the studious man is senseless for the roughly three paces he walks before the warming charm kicks in. The way Draco’s face swings into happy recognition to see him coming does something to his heart, but he shakes it away and holds up the plates instead.
“Oh, so this whole ‘open-minded, better man’ thing is really a ‘better man when I feel like it’ thing,” she calls as she follows him through to the dining room. Draco needs to keep an eye on the door for Blaise’s already-belated arrival.
A while later,
Though maybe it is better to offer the olive branch and appear friendly.
“Hold on, Draco—“
“…this is
At least the walk to Jab is nice. The autumn days are thinning out, so there’s already a grey-tinted falling light in the sky. It rained earlier, dropping the temperature significantly, and he sinks his hands into the front pocket of his hoodie. The whole getup feels ridiculously casual next to Draco’s well-upholstered silhouette.
There were only two people who could summon a heartbroken Harry from his curtained bedroom and they had invited him to dinner, presumably hoping a meal could coax him out. With the blinding flash of reporters’ cameras still scored into his vision, he was moody before he’d even arrived.
“Someday you and your future

sit right by the door. Seems recklessly unnecessary for a man who prefers not to be spotted. Draco had looked their way only because Neville and Ron were making so much noise, and when he recognised the table and saw Harry, he looked away quickly and kept his head down until they reached their usual booth in the back.
Harry shakes his head. “No bones.”
Harry clenches his jaw, directing his attention to Lucrezia but focusing internally. He needs a plan. Mari can’t be his entire plan.
Draco blinks and takes a deep breath. “That’s nice.”
“Pardon?”
“You’re not the first Harry Potter to cause some trouble.”
There’s a serene quiet to the walk, to being alone with himself in a way that he doesn’t often feel—unfindable, uncontactable. Maybe if he’s lucky it’ll have the same effect on him that it seems to have on Draco, and he’ll finally have the inspiration to see a connection in the casework that’s hidden from him thus far. Unlike Draco, who seems to work best staring straight at the problem—like a cursed skull for hours at a time—Harry tends to only get frustrated as he rereads the same notes for the thousandth time.
“Oh, bugger off,” he grumbles. “You know it’s not like that.”
He resumes his pacing, much to Harry’s chagrin. He has his sympathy—it’s when Harry also wishes to hex a tree that he chooses his usual outlet.

“Thank god, you smell.”

“Harry?!”
“Obviously,” Draco mutters. “Though in your defence, I’d also want a couple of decades of constancy if I’d had your youth.”
“Hiya, ‘Mione, I was just, er, well, apologising for interrupting.”
“I’m too excited to sleep.”
Lars experiments with contact first, throwing a leg towards Harry that he quickly dodges. Lars always strikes first. It leaves him open early—he shouldn’t be so quick to pounce—and Harry sends a hook towards his jaw haphazardly while he catches his own balance, which Lars narrowly escapes. They circle like this, sending light kicks and missed swings, until Harry finds his opening and quickly switches his stance. His right leg pivots in a roundhouse kick, landing his shin powerfully against Lars’ torso.
“Sod off, Malfoy.”
He smiles coldly in spite of himself, shaking his head at her blatant ‘end of conversation’ tone. “it’s fine, Mum.”
“Sure,” he says. “All the friendships from your Mastery.”
“I know my place,” he responds, picking the nature out of his curls. “Third to none, second to Teddy.”
“A what?!”
“She just wrote me with her new French address and said you’d done the warding?”

. Don’t tell Gran.”
When Harry opens his door the following Sunday, he swings it with such speed that a small breeze of air flutters the front curls of his hair, and his face lights transparently for a moment into happiness before his mouth turns down and he’s fully frowning at the sheepishly nervous man on his stoop.
Harry Potter?”
He stops and lowers his quill, meeting Blaise’s eyes, and makes a show of facing him directly and setting his hands flat on the table. “You have it,” he bites.
“Draco!” Something stings his face and his eyes fly open. Harry’s back. “Is this a normal burn or a magical burn?”
“I always know, ‘Mione. Sit back down, please.” He takes the empty plate from her and stacks it with Ron’s and his, waving his hand to dismiss her polite protest. “Just relax,” he admonishes, walking to the kitchen.
“Splendid. Anything else?”
“I just don’t feel like cooking,” he says. “You could have asked over owl, or… at dinner tomorrow.”
“I’m the gift, you’re the curse,” Harry knocks his shoulder.
Harry answers with his eyes raking down the papers. “Hm? Oh, we just met.”
“You know, I told Ron you don’t do that anymore.” Potter’s watching him with amusement.
“Queen to
“It’s fine, he won’t hurt us.”
“Might I remind you, ‘Oh god, I didn’t mean that. I really didn’t mean that. That was a huge mistake,’” Harry recites emotionlessly, matter-of-factly.
“But we’re exclusive.”
“That’s not all,” Draco says darkly, sliding over a second paper, this time fully scribbled in his handwriting. It’s his personal notes, taken down quickly as he worked, but at the bottom he’s circled and underlined the results. “I haven’t added everything to the form yet, and I… don’t need to. If you follow.”
“I’m just getting a little concerned that you think I’m your doll.”
Yes. He will owl tomorrow.
“The soft animal.”
From Paharganj, Draco apparates them to Meena Bazaar. It’s an older market, corridors carved tall with barrel-vaulted archways, storeys high. Domed bays off the arcade serve as shops, piled with finery; glittering jewellery, embellished saris, ornate dishes. Harry’s almost too distracted by the shine of it all to recognise Draco’s travelling for what it is, but he stops just in the entrance.
He does, as far from Draco as possible. “You’re… er, feeling well, then?” he says as an afterthought of politeness.
, which he’d do. He’ll wonder where his case evidence is sitting, who delivered it there, and why he’s been removed. It should all fill him with anger. But he’ll smile as though he’s not wondering. It’ll be easy, doable. A new lease on life, unless Draco walks into the same pub behind Pansy and Blaise, and—god forbid—looks Harry’s way.
“Twist on the ball of your
Often, in the last handful of weeks, Harry’s been reminded of an old science-fiction story he’d seen, where an astronaut orbits Earth for years, and the different forces and speeds mean he ages slower, so that when he comes back down his family is old and grey, but he is not. Time has moved differently for him; when he steps off the ship onto human soil, despite how long he’s lived in orbit, he has barely aged at all.
Harry clicks his tongue in disappointment and shakes his head, not bothering to disguise a rueful grin. “Piss off.”
She chews the inside of her lip but looks between the two of them, and like a switch has gone off, Harry’s in her graces again. “Then I’m officially glad he has someone like you, too.”
“Of course.”
Draco, meanwhile, doesn’t say a word, but Harry hasn’t given him much of a chance. He’s too excited to be walking his neighbourhood with him. Can’t stop pointing out all his local spots. The Indian restaurant he’d found before he even moved in, run by a lovely couple, Sumeet and his wife Vijaya, sometimes with help from their teenaged daughter. The coffee shop where every barista knows his order, and where he’s too polite and touched to correct them when he walks in and hears “Saw you coming, Harry. The usual: Black coffee, two sugars, takeaway!” when he wants to try something new.
“Er, well, I’m not sure. Sirius isn’t… the recipient is not here to receive the alert… I know there was one, but not what it was. Regardless, this is bloody brilliant spellwork. Incredibly advanced. The caster was extremely skilled, I’d love to know what Flitwick would make of him—hell, I’d kill to learn from him.”
The judgement in his voice obviously wasn’t well-disguised. “Er, really good?”
She picks up her wand beside her on the table, reaching into the bag proving futile (it’s an expanding bag Draco got her years ago for Christmas. He’s gotten used to watching her dig elbow deep into the clutch), and summons a set of blueprints. They look like the French chateau she’d bought on the outskirts of Chalais earlier that year.
“Six words! I’m aiming for double digits.”
They stay low, on the outskirts of the pitch, slowly practising the careful art of lowering yourself into a fractional dive while spinning upside down. It’s hard, like rubbing your stomach and patting your head.
Perhaps Harry senses the same concerned stillness he’d portrayed the first time he’d seen the Dark Mark in the home gym—a worried prediction of how he’ll be considered—and this is why he offers a purposeful coolness. “You’re lovely as ever,” he breathes.
The first passage in
Draco’s arms reach out and curl around him, pulling tight, so Harry squeezes back, hard as he can.
Harry frowns and puts a hand to his forehead. Ron and Hermione had said nothing, but he had just walked at least thirty minutes home in the cold. “I don’t think—“
“Or… Ravenclaw! Say Ra-ven-claw!” Hermione lifts her, staring cross-eyed with their noses touching. “Any house you want, love. It doesn’t define you!”
“Fucking hell, Draco?!”
“So you and Draco are close friends now, right?” she asks abruptly, voice soft and lilting. She’s won him—he snaps his head up to meet her eyes.
“You could’ve gone around the outside, darling,” she sighs, but she crouches amiably to lift one of them when the metalwork catches on the threshold.
“I just mean, I can barely see you, the light’s coming in so brightly behind you.”
His breath catches when Harry moves incomprehensibly closer—close enough that the tips of their noses almost touch. He could lean in like before and close the distance, but he can’t seem to move. Maybe he needs to know that Harry wants this just as badly as he does. He needs Harry to be the one to do the leaning.
“Be well,” she says, dripping warmth again. “You are always welcome at the Manor.”

not?”
He gives in and looks hopelessly to Draco, startled again to already be receiving penetratingly strong eye contact. It stops a breath in his lungs. Beautiful, always. Intense, always. Harry holds his gaze solemnly, memorises the way his hair falls. Then, Draco winks.
Draco shifts again, reaching a hand into the pocket of his trousers. “That reminds me, you left this at mine.” He holds Sirius’ necklace in Harry’s line of sight, and he takes it, lacing it between his fingers.
“I… suppose,” Draco responds slowly. “If there was precedent? That sounds even more complicated than this.”
Spoonfuls is a cheery little café in the back end of Diagon Alley, a minute away from the bustle of the high street. The façade is painted a sunny yellow, with large glass windows almost the length of the ground floor itself, showering the interior with afternoon sunlight. It sits in a string of small shops, antiques to its left and a hat shop to its right, and above it is a row of flats, one of which, he realises, must be Malfoy’s.
“Equally important.”
Draco grimaces. “I hate people.”
Harry shrugs. “Sometimes… you disagree with people.”
Perhaps he could be Draco’s experiment, for as long as he’d let him. Could he possibly know whether he’s interested in men from a single kiss? Friends with benefits exist, albeit usually not while one of them has strong feelings for the other. He’d figure a way to put that aside, just as he’s been doing. Just for the chance.
It had been too long since they had seen each other, and Draco thought his arrival might be due to Pansy’s influence, so he quickly accepted. He tuned him out as promised and barely registered each time he threw his hands up and demanded justice for his client.
“That would be great,” Draco interposes, speaking firm and smooth. He’s still staring at Jack, who’s redoing his bun with an easy dimpled smile that fades slightly into something else only when he looks toward Harry. “If you’re up for it,
“One less if you come with me.”
“Wha… g-good, she’s well,” Draco stammers. “Come back from there.”

Harry is speechless for a moment. The room is silent enough to hear a pin drop. Finally, he says, “I’m doing my best, sir,” his fist clenched firmly under the table in exchange for the even calmness of his voice.
“It means…” Draco trails off as he casts a cleaning spell on the evidence and makes a note in his records. “All items were cursed by a hawthorn wand, which would be helpful if there weren’t thousands of hawthorn wands in Britain.” He’s too tired to filter out the hint of moodiness in his voice.
“He and you?” he clarifies instead, voice carefully steady.
“He was upside down,” Draco offers again, as if he’s suggested something more considerable like ‘he was blind’. Maybe it’s as simple as the idea that he’s forgettable, or Leonard was a tad distracted.
“No.”
Draco smiles, eyes glittery. “May I have the honour of this dance?”
Subconsciously, Harry’s hand rises to his chest, flat against the necklace. It’s beating fast, too. Hermione eyes him where he’s stilled in the doorway. His hands are curled tightly around the spare clothes Ron’s picked up for him.
“What?” he splutters, pushing past them.
One of Harry’s hands twitches on the table. “Do I, er…” He performs some strange overacted version of what he must interpret Draco’s tracing to look like—eyes closed, hand extended.
doesn’t sound too good. Draco watches him thoughtfully anyway, still too pallid for Harry’s liking, and takes a long time to respond. It’s an unspeakable relief when he steps closer into Harry’s space and drops his forehead onto his shoulder.
“There are
“You bloody showoff,” Harry grins, clapping him on the shoulder.
He watches Draco roll his eyes with a winning groan. “You’re impossible. One nice comment and you turn it all around.”
, he announces in a rather uncharacteristic flash of reason after his shower.
Draco doesn’t remember what he said, just that Ron Weasley of all people had been his saviour in the moment that he nudged Harry along and broke whatever odd, painful connection was passing between them unsaid.
“Whatever it says, it’s only going to cause me trouble.”
“Hear,
“At a conference. Did you live together?”
“You-you as well, clean up nice,” Harry stumbles back, smooth as ever.
clever, Ron. Like Hermione," he grins. "He’s
“The Chosen One, apparently,” he responds with mock arrogance, jutting out his chin and adding a low bow towards the fire. When he returns to the task of tying his tie, he tuts in judgement. “Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley sitting in the audience, but I’m the one restoring peace.”
“Well this will hold your interest; Ginny’s in town.”
He does, propped up on his elbows, and Harry waits a moment, as if the love needs to kick in. Then he reaches out a hand and feels it against Ron’s chest. He looks bewildered staring down at Harry’s hand, understandable because the charm is completely still.
“The Cassie connection, that was new information, no?”
“I look fucking
Fellow authors, Marta’s publishing friends, curse specialists, Hogwarts alumni, Flitwick, even new Head Auror Marinella all keenly approached him with an uncanny timeliness for any free moment in which he tried to move to the bar or the lavatory or back to his table. For a while, Harry was on his arm to deflect some of the attention and answer his own set of questions, but Draco caught him glancing repeatedly towards the Weasley table and sent him off, leaving himself alone to make nice. He didn’t find any of his friends again until he heard Pansy’s voice a while later, projected over the crowd, beckoning him up in front of the party.
There are two interruptions; Ron, first, swings through the door without knocking late in the morning.
“Complex is our speciality,” says Harry. It’s past midnight. “Like you were saying about feeling the need to be perfect—it’s impossible, so stop trying. This is too intricate for perfection to be an option.”
He shrugs. “She said it combined our meddlesome energies. Ready?”
“Yes, well,
“The fighting, the hurtful words… if you really think they’re the effect of beginning this relationship without communicating enough, and you said yes to my three conditions, try again and
“Right, she would never miss that.”
Draco snorts, shaking his head. “Never.”
Harry’s eyes light up. Ron catches his mischievous grin.
“Since?”
He looks up over the kitchen island. “Erm, you’re working.”
Pansy turns her mouth up into a smile, eyes creasing, and she looks at him contemplatively for a long breath. Her expression tells him he’s already won, before she speaks.
Harry’s morning is spent proactively, professionally, and when Draco owls him with a list of specialists, none of which are local to London, he begins to reluctantly consider them. He feels like he’s narrowing in on suspicions and hopes more than anything that no new curses give these specialists a need to be consulted, but starting the hiring process will certainly maintain appearances that Draco’s been removed entirely.
embossed in gold on the cover, which he doesn’t remember owning.
“Aren’t you dying to hear? Your necklace?” He rounds the table and takes Harry’s hand, flipping it palm up and pressing the chain and charm into it. He leaves his hand on top and frowns at the worry on his face. “What’s happened?”
can prioritise my favourite pants and you can just sit and look pretty.”
Harry lays on the couch after dinner because Draco refuses to let him wash the dishes. Instead, he watches from afar over his new book of Lake Poets. Draco’s humming and nodding his head to the radio, sleeves of his jumper pushed past his elbows. The fire he stoked is crackling to Harry’s left, keeping the room warm, and when he looks up and catches Harry’s eye with a grin, calling, “This is a
