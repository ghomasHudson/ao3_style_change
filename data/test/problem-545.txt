“Because he’s already so sad. I don’t want him to feel worse.” A quiver in the boy’s voice went straight to Harry’s heart.
“Charles Selwyn” Draco finishes for her “You set us up six years ago, Daph, and it didn’t work out terribly well.”
“The singer, Freddie Mercury, he died when I was still in Azkaban from...a muggle illness called AIDS.” Sirius looks at Harry carefully, as though for a flicker of understanding or recognition. Finding none, he relaxes. “Remus saved all my albums, and any of your mum’s he could recover. Lily would have wanted you to hear them, she was always singing Bohemian Rhapsody, dancing you around the flat.”
Draco straightens his back and meets Potter’s eyes. “I apologise, Potter, for being an insufferable blood purist as well as the part I played in the Battle of Hogwarts. As I said in the letter, I’ve made a promise to myself to set my life on a path that not only passively causes no harm but actively contributes to helping others.”
Anthony squeezed his hand. “This is about more than that, Harry. You adore children, I’ve seen you with Rosie and Hugo, with Teddy - hell, with babies we run into doing the weekly shopping. You want to be a parent. But I don’t, I never have. I love you enough to know that it’s an unkindness to ask that you give up your dream. Just as, I hope, you love me enough to feel the same.”
“I’m going to be late.” Draco bent down so he was eye level with his son. “You’re the one who wanted me to start dating, right?”
“Are you sure you want to leave in the part about the brownies?” Rosie asked when she had finished carefully transcribing.
“Don’t worry, it gets easier every time you drop them off.” Hermione said reassuringly as she saw the expression on Draco’s face. “Rosie has been coming to school here since she was five, and I thought I’d pass out the first time I watched her walk away from me.”
A chorus of cheers rang out and then nearly everyone was kissing - some chaste and some decidedly not. Blaise kissed Daphne, Hermione and Weasley were wrapped in a disturbingly passionate embrace, and Draco’s gaze fell yet again on Harry. He watched in amazement as the man bent down to place a friendly kiss on Pansy’s cheek before glancing up to meet Draco’s eyes. With a smile, he raised his champagne glass in a silent toast before downing its contents.
“Well, Ron and Hermione already know you and they think you’re fantastic. Mrs. Weasley will love you because I do. Luna doesn’t hate anyone. Don’t let the blokes get to you, and all you’ll have left is Ginny - you must remember her from our school days?” Harry paused, then decided to be truthful. “She’s the worst of the lot, really.”
“Harry?” Hermione’s voice rang through Grimmauld Place like a bell, reaching Harry where he sat in the library, slumped against the unyielding back of his least favourite chair because he didn’t feel he deserved the comfortable one. He didn’t move to let her know his location - Hermione was far too skilled a witch to need directions.
“They passed away when I was a baby.” Harry said quietly, aware that the topic of conversation was veering close to very personal territory for Scorpius.
Harry threw down the quill and re-read his letter. Then he got up and strode toward the fire, throwing a pinch of floo into the flames.
“I don’t you going on a date with some lady.” Scorpius said, producing the letter from his pocket. “I want you to go meet this one.”
“I got your favourite eggrolls, Pads, but you have to share this time.” Remus stops short when he sees Harry, flicks his glance over to Sirius and then back again. “Having a late night get together, are we?”
“Scorpius!” Draco sighed, marshalled his temper, and then continued “I told you, this isn’t how things are done. You don’t meet someone because they heard your voice on the radio. You meet through friends, through work. You have a mutual spark and things progress from there!” Scorpius couldn’t have known, but Draco was thinking specifically of a certain very engaged hero of the wizarding world. He had found himself wishing more than once that it was Harry waiting for him at Le Phénix rather than Esme, though he supposed the upscale restaurant was probably not to Harry’s taste.
“Actually, Draco made me upgrade, so I’m now fully capable of sending messages with all their words intact.”
“It started to feel like we were roommates” Draco continues, ignoring this undignified behaviour while taking secret delight in having been its cause. “Then next door neighbours. Finally, I realised it had been months since we’d even eaten a meal together. That’s when I knew that we weren’t partners anymore, not really. So I sat down with him and laid out what I was willing to sacrifice - extra rotations at the clinic, every second week of lunches with Pansy and Daphne, things like that. And he...wasn’t. He didn’t want to. So we ended things.”
Astoria died shortly after their sixth wedding anniversary, on a cool day in late June, with Draco and Daphne at her side and Scorpius curled around her feet like a sleeping cat. Though she was his wife's sister and his close friend's wife, there was no love lost between Draco and Daphne. Despite the fact that their past was filled with a range of disagreements, the pair had long ago set aside their differences for Astoria’s sake and now tolerated each other with what looked a bit like affection if one were to squint. Daphne had even moved into the manor during Astoria’s last weeks so she and Draco could spell each other off, ensuring that the pale, dark haired witch they both loved would never be alone.
“Alright” Rosie shrugged, carefully tearing the scratched out beginning of their letter from the top of the parchment “let’s use mummy’s owl button, it will be more anonymous because they change every week.”
Thanks for reading this silly fluff and commenting, I don't often reply because I'm a bit of a shy weirdo when it comes to my own work, but I do love every one of them!
“Sometime after my twentieth birthday.” Draco tries to gauge if Potter is about to make fun of him, but can’t find any malice in the question.
“No.” Anthony said quietly. “I would have thought you might ask me if I wanted a child around for a month during the summer, given that we practically live together.”
Draco shook his head and drained his glass. “Yeah, I’ll start dating, it will be fantastic. I’ll just grow a new heart.”
Draco glanced over to see them cuddled on the floor and felt his heart warm. People could - and did- say what they wanted about Pansy Parkinson, but she was a fiercely loyal friend and excellent godmother.
The three of them turned to look at the bar where Anthony and his companion were leaning close, clearly having an intimate conversation. Harry watched for a moment, feeling regret and sadness but surprisingly very little jealousy. What had Anthony said? They both deserved to be happy?
Draco wasn’t the only one who couldn’t stop thinking about Harry - Scorpius was preoccupied with their brief encounter well into the evening of the next day, talking incessantly about the man.
“What’s the matter with you?” Draco asked, reaching up to run a hand through his own hair in frustration before he thought better of it.
“Nonsense” Arthur said, waving his wand to repair the rip. “Do you remember Ron falling over his own feet trying to waltz with Hermione at their wedding? These robes have seen more than you and I put together.”
“Last Friday.” Draco downs his entire glass of wine unceremoniously, then makes a practised study of the menu, though the food aspect of their lunches has never really been a priority.
“One of her many talents” Harry glanced over at Draco and their eyes met. For a second, Harry wondered if he was going to abandon his faculties and throw himself at Draco Malfoy unbidden. It certainly felt like a distinct possibility - the grey eyes across from him were familiar in a way that had nothing to do with their shared past. Harry could see hesitation and something close to hope in that stare.
“So you’re married to Weasley are you?” Draco asked after a moment, when the tears that sprang to his eyes at her kind touch had dissipated.
“You have to admit that Pax Garden is the best of it, though.” Harry said, fiddling with the parchment. This was also true - Pax Garden sat at the end of a languid maze that had little paths leading into alcoves with statues of different magical and non-magical creatures arranged in tableaus among the flowers. The Garden itself was bracketed on three sides by the hedgerow, ivy dripping down the thick green walls. Arching over its entrance were trellised roses, their blooms hanging full and petulant no matter the season - in fact, all of the flowers within the garden were in perpetual bloom. A winding path shaped by all manner of flowers and leafy green plants lead to a little hollow where a metal gazebo that seemed to be made entirely of more large, white roses stood guard over a modest stone plinth bearing two pairs of hands cast in dark marble. The inside pair was cupped to hold a steady stream of water that gurgled from their depths; the second pair rested gently on the first, fingers touching its wrist, cupping the inner hands as though helping them bare the weight of their burden. The stone beneath them had a repeating phrase etched into its surface: “pax optima rerum” or “Peace is the greatest good.”
Professor Mentis chuckled. “Smart man. You sound a lot younger than our usual flooers. Why are you calling us tonight?”
“It sounds like you're losing some sleep over it. Do you think - well, I don’t know your name. Where did you say you were calling from?”
“Oh sure, great idea, pull his dad into the conversation.” Harry muttered, though he did not change the station.
It took three months for Draco to enter the master bedroom again, and even still, he couldn’t bring himself to sleep in their bed. When Astoria moved into the manor she had made it home not just for herself, but for Draco as well.
Unfortunately for Draco, Esme had no such reservations. She made it quite clear that she expected some sort of display of affection and celebration on the 14th. Because he still wasn’t sure what his feelings for her actually entailed - they hadn’t even slept together yet - Draco went very traditional. He bought flowers, planned to cook her a meal, and purchased a box of specialty chocolates from a stuffy little shop in Diagon Alley. He cleaned the house, set the table for two, and made sure they would not be disturbed.
“Don’t be ridiculous.” Hermione crossed one leg over the other and leaned forward to give him an appraising look. “I think you should go meet this man, and not just because Ron will owe me three galleons if I’m right about him. You need to let go of the fantasy that you’ve built up if you’re ever going to find someone; if you don’t go, you’ll always wonder what could have been. If you’re going to ask Draco out he deserves your full attention...and while we’re on the subject,you need to actually ask what he’s looking for instead of being a prat and assuming.”
“Maybe he had to have a drink or two, get up the nerve?” Harry read the letter again. “It’s very to the point. Why did I pick such a far off date? Honestly, it’s only just February now. I couldn’t have chosen Valentine’s day?”
“Aunt Pansy is never getting married.” Pansy interjected. “She’s going to become a fabulous spinster and leave all her money to her very favourite Malfoy and her kneazle, Bitsy.”
“Draco, there you are! I was beginning to think you’d taken my advice and actually found someone to shag tonight.”
“How’re you holding up, Tony?” Hermione asked kindly from his other side. She and Anthony worked together at the ministry and had been friends for years. “Don’t let them scare you off, they mean well. For the most part.”
Hermione smiled kindly at him. “Sure, Ron and I have worked through disagreements, but in  the end we both wanted the same things fundamental things. Even if I needed a bit of planning and discussion before we had children, I wasn’t closed to the idea. Though I did tell Ron that if he wants a third he will have to carry it himself. I don’t know how Molly did it six times.”
Scorpius loved Rosie with the devout solemnity of a disciple combined with a very real need to prove himself worthy. Rosie had practically rescued him from social isolation at school and was the first friend he had ever made on his own (cousins didn’t count). If anyone knew what to do, it would be her.
“You’ve packed your papers?” Ernest asks, putting a hand on Draco’s waist and bending to kiss him before he can reply. Draco is not typically one for public displays of affection, however there’s something about Ernest that makes him want to show everyone that they are together. He deepens the kiss, leaning in, relishing the touch. He knows they look good together, with their differing shades of blonde (Ernest’s dark to Draco’s pale) and smart muggle suits, a fashion that has bled into the Wizarding World thanks in large part to the sudden post-war popularity of many of their peers.
Draco and Blaise always threw a New Years party, a tradition spawned during their fifth year at Hogwarts, though it had come a long way from covert bottles of firewhiskey in their dorm room. This year was shaping up to be one of the best, with Draco hosting at his new home and the guest list slightly more intimate than other years.
He missed Astoria suddenly, fiercely, and felt overcome with anger that she had left him alone. He knew the thought wasn’t fair even as it sprang up but he let himself feel it for a moment, the rage at having lost her, at finding himself a single father and even worse, alone once again. Then the anger turned to guilt and bitter sadness, and Draco decided it was time to get well and truly pissed.
The Granger-Weasley family was just sitting down to a late supper when Draco burst from their fireplace.
On the pitch, the seekers both spot the snitch at the same time and dive toward it - Colin Ashcomb, of the Bats, throws himself forward slightly, arm outstretched. Harry and Dean lean forward as well, along with the rest of the stadium, waiting breathlessly to see who will end the game. Ashcomb is lithe but strong, and Harry watches in fascination as his muscled thighs clench around the broom nestled firmly between them. Harry has been a big fan since Ashcomb began playing for the team, following the man’s career in newspaper articles where it often appears next to Ginny’s and, occasionally, his own. It’s no secret that part of his popularity hinges on the fact that he’s handsome, so Harry doesn’t feel it’s odd that he is appreciative of Ashcomb’s good looks.
Draco shook his head. “I don’t think that’s going to happen, Scorpius. Harry has a partner already.”
The man took a deep breath, and Harry realized that he was holding his own in anticipation. “After the war, I didn’t think I would ever fall in love, everything seemed too fragile and easily destroyed. I didn't feel like I deserved anything but hatred. Then I met her. It was a gathering of old friends and I saw her across the room. It sounds so cliche, but I just knew. It was like-”
Draco doesn’t want to admit that this is exactly how he feels as well, though he does rather wish there were a trolly of magical sweets to roll past and distract Potter.
“That’s right. That’s right.” Draco cupped the back of Scorpius’ head and hugged him tighter, unwilling or unable to look up at Harry. This was his moment with his son, a reunion that he would not sully with his own feelings of rejection.
Scorpius only took a bit of convincing; though he was a well behaved child, apt to follow rules and respect adults, he was also quite fixed on both the brownie baking wizard and not seeming like too much of a wet blanket in front of Rosie. Given these two factors, it wasn’t long before the pair were standing before the perch in Hermione’s office, tying their letter to the leg of an official looking eagle owl (favoured by upper ministers for their impressive size and dignified bearing)(Hermione prefered barn owls herself).
“We used to joke that we were the perfect pair, and I suppose we were in the beginning, the two of us and our kneazle Tyberius. But I became busier with school and then the clinic, and Ernest’s practice took off. It got to a point where I would barely see him in passing. And Tiberius…”
“I do, though we were in different houses.” Draco said, already anticipating her reaction when she found his out.
“I thought I banned that enchanted glass from my house?” Draco attempted to take it from her but Pansy only giggled, backing away from him and into Harry who grabbed her shoulders to steady her.
“Who’s it from?” Scorpius asked from where he sat at the kitchen island, playing with a large selection of quidditch figurines (if Pansy had looked carefully, she would have seen the Chaser for the Holyhead Harpies, long red plastic braid whipping out behind her as she hovered just above the cutting board, “Wingtips Weasley” emblazoned across her back in gold. But Pansy didn’t look.)
“I promise she was.” Potter grins and takes a large sip of his drink, froth catching in the hair above his lip.
“Yeah, but not as much.” Harry felt a flutter of fear in his chest and he began to grasp at anything he could find to stop their conversation from going in this direction. “And we’ll sign him up for Quidditch camp in the summer. He’ll be gone most of the year. You knew this might be a thing, I’m his godfather afterall.”
Harry slumped down in his seat, balancing a plate of fruitcake on his stomach. It was Christmas eve, and the sun had just set. Anthony was working late and things were weird between them at the moment anyway. After a second rousing Sunday dinner at the burrow with all the Weasley grandchildren, plus Teddy, home from Hogwarts, Anthony had remarked casually that he was happy they didn’t have any sprogs of their own. It wasn’t something they had discussed before, and Harry found himself stuttering out questions - did Anthony ever want them? (“Never”). Not even somewhere down the road? (“No.”) What about Teddy? (“Teddy isn’t in our lives full-time”). It hadn’t occurred to Harry till just then how much he did want to be a father, but when Anthony had asked if it was a problem, Harry had lied and said no. Anthony was good. He wasn’t going to sabotage that.
Draco raised his glass in a toast of acknowledgement. “Fair enough. If I'm being honest, Astoria always told me I was the most dramatic man she had ever met.”
“Exactly. Our division looks after the wellbeing of all children in magical Britain as a whole, with a specific focus on those without parents, including children who are muggle born. All of us, even the purebloods, are educated at muggle universities as Social Workers for four years before we do any field work, and at the same time we’re also doing magical classes that compliment those skills. We number about twenty-five all told, with five of us being active, seven about to complete their degrees, and the rest in varying stages of their education. We take on cases and field them to the appropriate departments or see them through ourselves.”
It was probably the two glasses of wine combined with a significant amount of cocktail that made Draco brave. He leaned conspiratorially toward Harry. “Do I ever.”
Draco feels heat rise in his cheeks; it’s not true, of course, just that he can barely enter a magical establishment without hearing about Potter. If he reads the occasional headline he’s hardly to blame, they’re everywhere, especially since the announcement of Potter’s engagement to Weasley a few weeks ago. Even his cohort - all younger than Draco because he had purposely waited two years to start so as not to enter with anyone who would remember him very well from Hogwarts - is obsessed with Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley’s upcoming wedding. When they found out he was in Potter’s year, that he knew the man, they were beside themselves. “I can’t read the Prophet without seeing something about your love life.”
“I should think the plus side of breaking up with Ernest is never having to see that little monster again.” Pansy says.
“Were you really at Hogwarts? What house were you in? Gryffindor like Harry? Did you play Quidditch?”
“But if you met the right one, fell in love with her and couldn’t imagine living the rest of your life apart?”
Harry took several steps into the gazebo and looked around - there, on a bench nearly hidden in shadow, sat a small figure. A very familiar figure.
“I don’t have time to discuss this letter writer, Scorpius. It’s impolite to be late.” Draco returned, his nervousness over the date and his irritation at the continuation of these blasted letters rendering his tone sharper than he meant. Scorpius’ lip quivered but he held firm.
Fall passed slowly into winter, and before Draco knew it, Yule was upon them. All the shops in the Phoenix District had colourful lights strung from their eaves and Scorpius’ primary school was festooned with non-denominational decorations (snowflakes, snow people - it seemed as though weather was the general, inoffensive theme). Every day, Scorpius came home with a different December tradition from around the world, among them popsicle stick reindeer, little plastic dreidels, a lantern he had decorated to celebrate Ligligan Parul Sampernandu, a drawing of the Gävle Goat, a hand-drawn guide on the different Jólasveinarnir one could expect to encounter, and a Krampus mask which he insisted on sleeping with under his pillow as an appeasement to the creature till Draco confiscated it.
Harry’s laugh drowned out the second clip, but he sobered quickly when a voice he recognised came on.
Scorpius thought for a moment, then nodded and held his hand out. Harry took it and they walked over to the fireplace together. “We’ll go through first.” Harry told Ron and Hermione.
Esme shrugged, looking uncomfortable, though she retained a modicum of haughty restraint that irked him.
The room descends into chaos as tree-roots launches himself at the challenger, knocking into several people on his way over.
Draco was not prepared for the joy that blossomed on his son’s face. “You’re the man who makes brownies?” Scorpius wiggled free from Draco’s arms and put his hands on his hips to assess Harry properly.
“Father. Latte drinker.” Hermione nudged his arm affectionately. “Surprisingly fun and witty companion. If you told a seventeen year old Hermione that she would be sitting in a posh coffee shop decorated to the teeth for Christmas, with her friend Draco Malfoy, she would have laughed herself sick.”
Perhaps it is this question that prompts Potter to ask him to tea, though it could be simple loneliness; as Potter reveals how he found out his marriage was over on a quiet Sunday afternoon three weeks previous, it becomes apparent that he has spent the intervening weeks in solitude. When he finally finishes detailing the events (including a fantastic impression of Gwenog Jones trying to console him as the Harpies shrunk and carried his wife’s boxes out of their home) Draco realises that Potter is feeling completely at sea. Even the Golden Trio is no longer functioning properly, Weasley having been distant since his sister broke things off with Potter, and Granger quite busy with a big project at work.
Draco sighed and crossed the distance between him and his son, scooping the child up. “Remember our discussion? You can stay up till midnight when you are ten.”
“I’m not ready to date anyone new yet.” Draco says firmly, catching the server’s eye and gesturing for another drink. “There has to be a period of adjustment, mourning, and figuring out a custody arrangement for Tiberius.”
Harry nodded. “I felt the same way about Grimmauld after Sirius died, it took me a long time to be able to live there again.”
It was only by sheer luck (or perhaps fate) that Harry’s crumpled up letter did not get thrown out or indeed, vanished - wizard homes rarely had rubbish bins because any refuse was swiftly magicked out of sight. Its survival came down to two factors: 1. As both Hermione and Harry had been raised by Muggles, the act of throwing out rubbish was ingrained in them from a young age, so Hermione kept a wastebasket and Harry’s first instinct was to deposit his crumpled letter there, rather than use magic to dismiss it. 2. the fact that Harry had been a Seeker, not a Chaser, and thus his throw toward said bin did not deposit the parchment inside. Instead, it hit the rim which redirected it and, by extension, the course of Harry’s life from that moment on.
“What’s wrong?” Hermione asked as she rejoined them carrying a second mug which she handed to Harry before sitting on the arm of the couch behind Ron.
Draco felt himself soften at this - Scorpius was a shy child, doubly so around anyone older than twelve. “He doesn’t warm up to many adults.”
“It can’t be almost midnight!” Draco cried, gesturing for Harry and Pansy to follow as he made his way back to the party.
Harry always met Ron and Hermione at their home so they could travel as a group to the Burrow for Sunday brunch. On this particular day he emerged from their fireplace somewhat worse for wear despite a very strong hangover potion - he had stayed at the bar till well after midnight nursing a keen sense of loss that he couldn't quite explain. Scorpius and Rose were sitting on the couch, heads bent together as they whispered fervently. They broke apart when he appeared and flashed him identical innocent smiles - Harry knew they were hiding something but decided that they weren’t his children and therefore it was not his job to uncover their scheme.
Somehow they end up buying muggle street food, though Draco isn’t sure how Harry manages to transfigure his desire for a proper meal into takeout.  They wander through a busy market, Harry eating a kebab as he weaves expertly through the crowd, occasionally stopping to look at something that catches his eye, and Draco trying to consume a hotdog without dropping ketchup on his shirt. It’s silly and a little overwhelming, but he enjoys himself nonetheless.
“Budge off.” She said, pushing a particularly persistent casserole away from where it had been nudging her shoulder. “Who else would have cooked you this feast? Honestly, it was all I could do to convince her not to come over here. She means well but-”
Harry doesn't fully realise just what Sirius and Remus were to each other until the war is over and both men are dead.
They landed just outside the perimeter of the Burrow and stepped through the wards, which easily admitted them. The front door flew open to reveal Molly Weasley’s smiling face.
“Please don’t speak when you have food in your mouth.” Draco said fondly. “And anyway, this isn’t how it’s done.”
Sure enough, she appeared in the doorway seconds later, an assortment of dishes following behind her like ducklings.
Hermione put a gentle hand on Draco’s arm to steady him and looked over at Ron “Send a patronus to Isobel.” And to Draco “She was Ron’s partner on the force and she’s still an auror. She’ll be able to help us.”
Malfoy shook his head. “Not since the war, in fact, though I must say Hermione’s insistence that they be paid has made me reconsider from time to time. There’s a Wizarding cleaners who come in during parties.”
“She would be appalled by the state of things.” Harry finished. Ever since Kreature’s death the upkeep of Grimmauld Place had been Harry’s responsibility. He wasn’t a terrible housekeeper or cook, but the recent breakup had not left him feeling particularly capable of doing either and it was apparent in the mound of take out containers, lager bottles, and discarded clothing that covered the room.
February melted into March and then became April, but Draco did not attempt to date anyone else. Esme had left a bad taste in his mouth and besides, it was clear he would need Scorpius to mature a little before he considered dating again. Or date someone Scorpius already knew and liked, which left almost no prospects.
“I took the morning off to check in on you.” She finally sat down in the chair opposite him, though her wand movements had not ceased and the room was tidying itself around them. From the kitchen Harry could hear the clink of dishes being washed.
“Potter.” Draco searches for something to say and lands awkwardly on “how’s married life treating you?”
The three of them filled plates and collected goblets of wine, then chose an unoccupied table from which they had a suitable view of the room. If Ron or Hermione noticed that Harry’s eyes followed the movements of a certain blonde head, neither commented on it. They chatted and ate till Hermione spotted a colleague from the ministry and practically dragged Ron over to meet him. Realizing he was now alone and thus approachable (it didn’t happen as often now, but he didn’t want to take any chances) Harry decided it was time he went looking for the loo.
Remus raises his eyebrows at the mostly untouched snifter of mead in front of Harry, but his voice is gentle as he takes a seat. “You’re right, she would have.”
Fran studies them closely, her eyes flitting from one to the other. “We should set something up in the next couple of weeks. Do you still have that ancient mobile of yours, or has it finally given up the ghost?”
“I don’t mind.” Draco said, and it was true - somewhere during Harry’s explanation he had sat down on the seat beside him and apparently started in on Pansy’s cocktail.
“He’s a fool anyway. Clearly not meant to be your husband.” Ron nudged Harry. “I think something better will come along.”
“Yeah. Grimmauld is huge and we have all those extra rooms. Andy can’t manage her house anymore, or keep up with Teddy most days.”
“Nocere Revelare.” Draco waved his wand in a figure eight over the letters. The entire collection glowed a soft yellow. “Detecto dolo.” The glow intensified. “What does it look like when something is cursed, Scorpius?”
“I bet it’s not.” Potter’s voice is sincere and low, his expression kind. It might be this fact alone (when will Potter ever look at him in such a friendly manner again?) that prompts Draco to continue.
Pansy whirled to face Harry. “You’re gay? I thought you and Weasley the youngest were disgustingly in love last time I saw you?”
Draco half-listens as his friends chat over their respective days - usually he is engaged and curious about their lives, but a recent and all-consuming change in his own is distracting, and he dreads having to share it. Still, they are bound to notice eventually and there will be hell to pay if they don’t find out from him.
“I try not to assume anything about anyone’s sexuality. Or gender, for that matter.” Hermione said. “You know Charlie is nonbinary? They told us last year. I never would have imagined and it made me wonder - why? Why was I going around assuming everyone fit into these neat little boxes? If I restricted myself to one box I’d be what, a wife or a mother? I enjoy those roles, but they don’t define me. Logically no one role or binary state defines all people. You’re a prime example of that.”
An hour later, Draco finishes his final paper and exits the classroom. Potter did not take the Arithmancy N.E.W.T and thus finished his test an hour previous, which is why Draco is surprised to find him sitting on a bench outside. He stands when he sees Draco.
“Listen, Draco-” Harry began just as the rest of the Weasley-Granger family tumbled out of the fireplace: Rose, Ron and Hugo, then finally Hermione in quick succession.
Draco sighed. “No Scorpius, I never hated them, but things were complicated by a lot more than inter-house rivalries when I went to Hogwarts.”
“He doesn’t sleep at night.” The child’s voice said quietly. “I hear you walking around the flat, papa.”
After several moments, Draco becomes aware that his boyfriend’s attention has been diverted away from him and they break apart.
They both worked contentedly for awhile, Draco cooking at the stove and Scorpius sorting through the pile of missives till the floo flared and Pansy stepped through. She took in Scorpius half-buried by letters on the floor, and then her eyes found Draco in the kitchen. “Oh good, I was worried I’d miss breakfast.”
“From everything I’ve seen he’s a wonderful kid.” Harry chewed thoughtfully on his lip for a moment, weighing his next words. “But you’re not the worst sort yourself, Malfoy. At least, not from what Hermione has told me.”
“It was long overdue, to be honest.” Draco says and then, surprising himself “how are you managing?”
Harry almost didn’t make the meeting. That evening, following two days of indecisiveness, he had gone to Hermione and Ron’s house where he ended up recounting the entire tale of his run-in with Draco. Technically it had begun with just Ron, but Hermione had gotten home about halfway through the second re-telling (Ron wanted to make sure he understood every nuance of conversation) and Harry felt foolish about hiding it from her, especially because there were no secrets between the three of them. Also, he suspected Ron was getting far too much entertainment from it all.
Harry winced - he had quite vivid memories of a very inebriated Ron swinging Hermione around the room at breakneck speed. It would have been hilarious had Harry not spent the subsequent half hour cleaning Ron’s vomit and feeding him sobering potions so he could consensually engage in his wedding night.
“The one who heard me and papa on the wireless and makes brownies. He said he wanted to meet papa and me but papa said it didn’t work that way and then he dated that awful lady instead. And now he’s going to be so cross with me. He probably hates me.” A fresh flood of tears soaked the hem of Ron’s cloak.
The man croons, the guitar fades out, and Sirius throws back the rest of his mead, then pours himself another glass.
“Come help me put dinner together, Scorpo, and when he returns we’ll ambush him together.” Pansy said, holding out a hand. Reluctantly, Scorpius returned to the kitchen and helped her unpack the paper bag. Much like their home, it was more spacious inside than out and they managed to pull bottles of butterbeer and a full meal from Creevy’s (the prophet called it “worth the wait in line” and “wizard comfort food”) from its depths.
“Scorpius?” Harry exclaimed, lifting his wand to cast light on the child as he rushed over to him. “What on earth are you doing here?”
“Blaise and I work together, he runs a potions business and I do most of the brewing. We're relatively successful.” This was an understatement on Draco's part, but he had grown up too much to brag.
Potter’s smile dims somewhat. “Yeah, I know.” There’s a moment of awkward silence and then “Do you think you’ll marry Ernie?”
Harry sighed and grabbed Ron's beer, taking a heavy gulp. “Anthony is a good man. I’m going to marry him, I just need to get this out of my system. Maybe I’m losing my mind.”
“You seem to be very at peace with it.” Harry says, scrutinising Draco closely. “I didn’t feel nearly this calm when Gin ended things.”
“We’ll start with the school and then work our way through places he’s familiar with. He has to know the address to get anywhere so there are a limited number of possibilities.”
“Listen, I’m sorry about Scorpius. You’re the first person I’ve dated since his mother passed away and I’m afraid he’s become rather fixated on me dating a wizard he's made up out of speculation.”
“I almost didn’t recognise you back there.” Potter says, which sounds like a lie, though Draco has made attempts at forging his own sartorial path. He’s quite proud of his travel outfit, a navy Burberry trench over a casual charcoal suit made by one of the designers popping up around the newly reformed, and slightly gentrified, Knockturn Alley. Draco’s tie matches his trench, and his white dress shirt is crisp; Ernest places a huge emphasis on style as well, which validates Draco’s obsession. He is tempted to reach up and run his hand through his hair; he has been wearing it in a short pompadour for the past few years (something his muggle-born barber calls “timeless style”) but he knows such attention would only be detrimental to its overall look.
“I’m busy!” Which has been his only excuse since the event a fortnight ago. “I can’t always make it home till very late - you know what it’s like, we work for the same madman.”
Trying to shake off this unfortunate encounter, he strides toward the train without a backward glance. Draco settles himself at one of the first class tables on the train, spreading parchment out over the surface so he can read over his address for the thousandth time. He had been utterly shocked to be nominated by his peers in the program as a presenter at the Healers of the Magical UK conference. His mentor, Ahmet, had praised Draco’s in-depth study reverse-engineering the protean charm to alter the effects of magical curse marks. When Draco had insisted his research was purely selfish (he wanted the Dark Mark gone from his body) Ahmet had told him that most people who became master healers ended up helping themselves in some way as well.
“Even adults?” Scorpius asked, and giggled quietly at Harry’s solemn nod. “What’s your name? Rosie said she has lots of uncles and aunties.”
Sirius flicks his wand and the record stops, lifts off the player and slides back into its sleeve. He selects another album, this one with a group of four young men not unlike the Marauders themselves on its cover. He sends it floating gently onto the player, there is a moment of silence, and then voices crackle into perfect acapella harmony.
She chuckled, setting the box of potions on the nightstand next to him and grabbed the clipboard that sat next to it. “Oh, heavens no. I’m afraid that you’ve had a panic attack.”
“So you are going to go around shoving me into walls again? I thought we moved past that back in October.”
He leaned over his knees, putting his head in his hands. He didn’t know what to do. He wanted to go to Dumbledore. He didn’t feel safe at a place where teachers tortured their students. She had gone
Their mouths moved quickly in sync, Draco letting out a soft moan as Harry slipped his hand through Draco’s hair and tugged at the hair above the nape of his neck.
He shrugged. “Read up on it over the summer. I cannot remember the name of the book to save my life, but it discussed the properties and potency of powdered potion ingredients. I am sure you can find it in the library somewhere, just ask Pince and she should know what I am talking about.”
Draco sneered as he cut him off. “Isn’t that some pansy-ass spell? You’re really going to waste our time with-”
“Mr. Potter,” Snape sneered as he dragged out the last ‘r’. He had managed to sneak up behind them, somewhere in Draco’s bantering. “Is it your intent to distract your partner, who is only trying to help you?”
It was weird for Draco. He would always walk through the halls alone, hugging the walls, paying great attention to everyone around him. He had to make sure someone wasn’t about to run into him on purpose or jump out at him with a jinx. But he found that when he walked with Hermione, it was just the two of them, and the other students seemed to disappear. They would talk about what they had just learned, or what they were expecting in their next class. Today, as they walked to the Great Hall, they complained about how much writing Snape had assigned over the weekend.
She waited until his breathing had returned to normal before continuing. “I believe that you and Granger were talking about something that upset you, which is why you got overwhelmed. Sometimes, people can get so overwhelmed that their body can have a physical reaction to their stress, and that’s what happened to you.”
So he sat by himself, reading his Ancient Runes book for the third time as he pushed mashed potatoes around his plate. But just because he wasn’t sitting with Hermione, didn’t mean he wasn’t listening to what they were saying.
“I think this is yours,” he turned around to see Harry smirking at him, Draco’s wand in his outstretched hand.
They started walking in stride to the Great Hall, which was on the complete other side of the castle. While he was very hungry, Draco didn’t mind too much, as it allowed them to talk without other people watching them.
Harry looked up at him for a brief moment before burying his face in his knees. “If you’re here to be a dick, please just fuck off.”
“Draco! I didn’t think you would show up!” Neville seemed surprised, yet happy, to see him, which put a smile on his face.
“‘Mione will be mad at us no matter what,” Harry slurred as he took the flask from Ron. “You two are similar in that way.”
The locker room banter had subsided, and with a quick glance around, Draco had realized he was the only one left in the room. He decided to take his time packing up the remainder of his things, trying to bask in the peaceful silence while he still could. Fridays were always too loud in the common room, and he would probably spend the rest of his night in the room of requirement, or perhaps the library if it wasn’t too busy.
Harry had moved quickly, as if he had been waiting for Draco. Before Draco could realize what was going on, he was pinned up against the locker staring into Harry’s wild and angry eyes.
“Oh, please. Did you see the rest of his team? They were just God-awful. I’m surprised Malfoy didn’t break his back carrying them.”
Happy Sunday! Sorry if this is a bit shorter than usual, I haven't been feeling well at all lately. I tried to write a little more but it just wouldn't come out, there might also be a few mistakes, I noticed a bunch and fixed them but I'm not sure if I caught them all.
Umbridge had already disbanded all student organizations. What would the repercussions be for going behind Umbridge like this, for going behind the ministry? Would it be detention? Expulsion? Draco couldn’t afford to be expelled. Hogwarts had his home, he had nowhere else to go. What would he do, live on the streets?
They spent the next two hours pouring over every book that she had brought. He ended up with two feet of parchment worth of notes, diagrams, and frustrated scribbles. By the time they had to leave for curfew, he felt as if he could take his O.W.L. right now and not fail miserably.
Something was wrong. He was falling back into his chair. Why was he falling? He felt as if his veins were freezing over, he was shivering, yet he was sweating through his shirt.
“Oh, shove it, Malfoy!” Now Potter was the one sticking a finger in his face. “But that’s fine, that’s expected of you. But then
Draco found his other hand running through Harry’s hair, his fingers playing with the individual strands, trying to smooth it out before messing it back up again. It made him think back to the last time this had happened, to how the two of them had sat like this for hours before finally falling asleep on the couch together. Draco remembered how
of all, you just had to go and hurt my friend! What was the point in that, huh? You slimy, arrogant, cocky bastard-”
Hermione reached out and slammed the book closed again, almost catching his fingers in between the pages.
The whispers and murmuring had stopped. There was a collective gasp when Draco was pushed up against the wall, but the common room was now in a shocked silence. He couldn’t see anything apart from Potter’s piercing eyes, but he was sure everyone was frozen in place.
The first years were frozen in terror, but finally slowly nodded their heads. Even the other students around the common room were shocked, Potter’s jaw had dropped.
He forced his eyes up, which had been previously glued to his feet. He was fully prepared to berate whomever he had bumped into, even though it was his fault. But when he locked eyes with the person, his voice turned soft. “Oh, sorry, Harry.”
“Let’s play a drinking game,” someone had suggested, Draco couldn’t tell who. The idea was met with a wave of enthusiasm, with some “oohs” and “aahs.”
care if he had a panic attack? “If he really felt bad then he would be here right now. Look around.”
“What the hell has gotten into you?” Hermione called after him when he left the Great Hall later. Draco was on his way to spend a nice Sunday in the library, and was planning on having approximately zero human contact. He pretended to not hear Hermione as he weaved through the crowd leaving breakfast, but there was no avoiding her when they got to the library. “What are you playing at?” She continued to badger him in a hushed voice as they entered.
He smiled. “I just always have. When I was a kid I had a potions set, and it was my favorite thing in the world, next to my broomstick. I just loved mixing everything together to see what would happen. I spent my childhood experimenting, on seeing what would happen if you stirred the potion or if you let it sit still. When I came to Hogwarts, it was the only subject that really came naturally to me. It just makes
Scorpius made sure to keep his eye on the family as they made their way through the village, though he almost got left behind a couple of times when his attention was drawn to something else. The hardest thing to ignore was Weasley's Wizard Wheezes, which had opened a shop in the village with displays designed to captivate children. Presently, their windows were filled with fireworks that exploded over and over above a display of their most popular products. Scorpius stopped for a moment to stare as a bright pinwheel whizzed behind the glass then exploded into the shape of a phoenix, before he remembered his mission and ran to catch up.
“Do you mind?” Ron asked, handing the child over to Harry so he could check his hair in the small oval mirror that hung on one of the walls - Harry had spent many years wondering why they had chosen it as a decoration before finally realizing that its sole purpose appeared to be affirming the Granger-Weasley’s grooming habits before they left the house. It made him love them even more.
Across from him Ron snores softly, his face tucked into the crook of one freckled arm. The silence in the rest of the room is oppressive and absolute, pressing in on Harry as he tries to will himself to sleep. When he can stand it no longer, he levels his body carefully from beneath the sheets, stepping quietly across the scratched wood floor. He tells himself that he’s going to get a glass of water and then go straight back to bed, but when he arrives on the landing of the first floor the kitchen is already occupied.
“I think she probably did too, but it can be weird to hear someone talking about your family like that.” Harry agreed, silently wishing that Daphne had had enough sense to put up a silencing charm or at least check for little ears before sharing her opinions.
“Sorry I’m late.” He huffs, sitting down hard and turning to the server. “Could I taste the Benoit Courault cab franc from 2018?”
Draco's irritation flares at this admission, but he has learned self-control in the years since school. He wordlessly begins to gather his papers, opening his briefcase with a decisive click to deposit them inside, closing it with perhaps a little too much force. He collects his jacket from where he has neatly folded it on the seat beside him, then slides out from behind the table.
The door creaks under Harry’s hand and Sirius opens his eyes, irritation flashing across his face at the interruption till he realises who it is. Harry expects a dismissal from this private moment, but his godfather surprises him. “Come on in then, and close that behind you.” His voice is slightly hoarse in a way that cannot be attributed entirely to drink.
There was a pause, then Esme let loose a loud, over-exaggerated peal of laughter. “Oh, you’re funny!” She said, giggling as she reached for her glass of wine. “I like a man who’s funny.”
“Ba!” Hugo giggled, clutching a handful of Harry’s shirt and smacking him soundly in the nose with the other hand.
“Are you okay, Aunt Pansy?” Scorpius asked - Pansy looked over to see him watching her intently. She forced her face into a neutral expression.
Draco looked over at her untouched latte curiously, then exchanged his mug of tea for it and took a sip.
He accomplishes the first task - Dominique has a head of strawberry blonde hair and still bears the slightly squashed look of a newborn, but Harry delights in how her entire hand curls around one of his fingers when he holds her. Being very familiar with new parents (the Weasley family has been productive since the war ended) he doesn’t overstay his welcome, and is on his way to the exit when he spots a familiar flash of white-blonde hair.
Malfoy smiled slightly. “More likely Hufflepuff, if I’m being honest. I blame Astoria, her father was one.”
“I recall, you’ve mentioned that several times.” The problem was that Draco didn’t mind hearing it; he kept replaying his own brief conversation with Harry. They hadn’t had a chance to speak again at the party - Harry had spent a surprisingly long amount of time talking to Pansy before Weasley and a very tipsy Hermione appeared at his elbow. The three of them had departed with a quick thank you to Draco, and though their parting handshake had left Draco feeling quite a lot more inebriated than he had any right to be considering his low alcohol intake, it had not been meaningful enough to be suggestive. Add that to undeniable factor of Anthony Goldstein and Draco felt altogether far more foolish than he would have liked, and about as helpless to stifle his crush as he had been in school.
It was during one of these coffee dates that he learned that Harry was engaged to Anthony Goldstein - an announcement which caught him entirely by surprise.
“Draco!” Hermione said warmly, though her smile dropped slightly as she sensed the tension in the room. “Where’s Scorpius?”
Hermione scrutinised the parchment, unaware that its writer had focused a near replica of her expression it only a day before.“It’s a reply to the one you wrote that man from the wireless, isn’t it?”
Stupid. Foolish, pathetic, laughable. He was all those things, and more, though his brain was not quite sober enough to come up with additional synonyms. Draco sank onto the couch in his living room, trying to reckon with the past hour. First he had chatted Potter up, then practically thrown himself at the man, only to be rebuffed. Of course he had been. Potter likely had not forgotten who Draco was, what he had been. And Draco had been foolish enough to think, for a moment, that there was a connection between them - not only in the bar, but at his New Year’s party as well. He had been sure there was something lingering there, waiting to be encouraged. But Potter’s not-so-subtle rejection stung more than he could have anticipated and his subsequent reaction had been nothing short of mortifying.
Scorpius nodded solemnly, turning his attention back to Rose who had tugged on his sleeve to whisper something in his ear.
It had taken a while for them to become close. Andromeda had, at first, mistrusted the boy she knew only from his brief appearance at her house during his final escape from Privet Drive. Given that upon their first meeting Harry had pulled his wand on her, he figured it was only fair she had reservations.
“Freddie is her cousin - George and Angelina’s son.” Hermione explained, before turning to Scorpius. “I don’t think we’ve been introduced.”
For a moment, their eyes hold and Draco feels something, a small flutter of excitement. He dismisses it almost instantly, having learned early on in his gay career that falling for straight men is never a good idea. He can’t do anything about the fact that he has found Harry attractive since school, or that when Harry looks at him he occasionally feels as though he’s eaten a fizzing whizzbee.
“Listen Harry, I wanted to offer you my robes for the wedding.” He said, his ears going slightly pink the way Ron’s did when he was embarrassed. “It’s traditional for a wizard to wear his father’s robes, and seeing as you don’t have those I thought I would offer. All of my boys have been married in them, it only seems fitting that you would be as well.”
“Because I’m Rosie’s uncle. She’s with her grandma and let me tell you, Grandma Weasley does not allow anyone to stay up past bedtime.”
When the rock interlude begins, Sirius starts nodding his head rapidly to the music, tangled locks bouncing around his ecstatic face. Harry laughs and imitates him and they head bang in their chairs until they’re both dizzy and out of breath, euphoric in their shared enjoyment.
“I think they’re busy trying to convince Rose and Scorpius to go to bed at the moment” Harry grinned. “I just came from there, actually, stopped by for dinner and got suckered into playing dragons with the two little sods afterward. Scorpius told me I do the best roar he’s ever heard, by the way.”
Harry’s surprised expression was a secret delight to Draco. “It’s Anthony - I’ve always known I wanted them.”
“Ron!” She said sharply, though her tone was undercut with mirth. “You can’t meddle in Harry’s life like that!”
Draco gently moved Scorpius backward until they could look into each others’ eyes. “You’ve never been this upset about staying at Pansy’s before. You’ve practically begged to in the past, if I recall.”
Harry follows. He doesn’t mean to, only his feet make the decision ahead of his brain and by the time he realises what is happening he’s already crossed the atrium and gone down the corridor after them. Fortunately, he is never far from his invisibility cloak, which he pulls from his side bag where it is nestled between a large book on trauma guided practice and his overstuffed school notebook. Seconds later, and completely invisible, he rounds the corner and comes almost face to face with Malfoy. Harry’s heart thuds uncomfortably in his chest, but Malfoy’s gaze goes straight through him to the board on the wall behind, which lists attending healers, then back to a pale-faced witch who appears to be bleeding from one eye.
“Whomever you choose. For your sake and the sake of any future partner, I think it would be beneficial to see this meeting through.”
“Yes. I’m just not used to so many voices.” Scorpius said, cutting his pancake into quarters with the side of his fork.
Harry nods, sips slowly on the mead. Every word is precious to him, each one a small dab of colour added to the image of his parents. Still, there is something that Sirius has come close to saying and it hangs between them, an important detail just out of reach. This song was
“I should head out” Daphne says, appearing beside him with Parvati Patil's newest romance novel tucked into the crook of her arm. “I have a hair appointment at ten and...Draco...is that Harry Potter starting at you from the magical maladies section?”
“We’re in the same class?” She said disbelievingly - Draco was beginning to think that curious skepticism was her default setting.
Harry’s heart sped up and he sat up so fast he nearly overturned his beer. He flicked his wand to turn the dial up and sat forward listening to the man’s voice as it filtered out of his wireless.
“Don’t you ever miss having house elves?” Pansy asked as they sat down at the table and Draco began to fill Scorpius’ plate.
“I know it’s serious!” Rose yelled, stomping her foot. “I’ve been trying to tell you, I know where Scorpius is!”
“Damn, my meeting with the minister has been moved up and I’m about to be late!” She said, shooting out of her seat so fast she nearly upended her drink. “Sorry to run out on you, Draco, but it took me forever to get this meeting with Kingsley in the first place.”
Scorpius’ eyes flicked over to look at Esme, then back to Draco. “I missed you.” He said, reaching forward to hug Draco tightly.
“Yes, thanks Ron, hadn’t worked that out for myself.” Harry muttered, though there was no malice - Ron’s infamous ability to say the wrong thing had long ago stopped being a source of contention between them.
“Thank you for once again corrupting my innocent child.” Draco sighed. “Scorpius, a smut show is a show for adults. A...romantic show.” He cringed as Pansy laughed.
“Alright, everyone!” Angelina yelled, stepping into the center of the pitch. “Welcome to the 1995 Gryffindor Quidditch tryouts! We are really excited to see all of you here, and we are even more excited to see what you all have to offer! We’ll start off with some drills for the positions you’re trying out for, and later we’ll have some scrimmages going! We’ll start with everyone’s first choice, so beaters, go along and follow Fred and George, keepers will be with Katie, seekers will be with Alicia, and chasers will be with me! Good luck, and have fun!”
Of course she didn’t want to be friends with him. Why would she? She only approached him that second night in the castle for help with her potions homework, anyway.
He didn’t care about what they had to say about him. It was probably the same as always, about how he’s just so depressing, how he’s a disappointment, a traitor, et cetera, et cetera. But that didn’t mean that the whispers didn’t bother him.
He looked at her in astonishment. He hurried in the room, closing the door with her foot. A stack of books at least seven tall sat in her arms, just covering her face. Her hair was frizzier than usual, sticking out in every which way. Her cheeks were flushed, a bright rosy red, and her forehead was the slightest bit shiny with sweat.
His smirk grew into a smile. “Yeah, yeah I guess I have.” He felt a weird warm feeling in his chest as he said it. It didn’t bother him as much as it thought.
Draco was quick on his feet. When he reached the common room, sure enough, Harry there. He was sitting there alone on the couch in front of the empty fireplaces, his legs curled up to his chest as he hugged his knees.
He packed up his things and made his way to the Great Hall. He was one of the last to arrive for dinner, but his normal spot at the end of the Gryffindor table was still open, as usual. He pulled out a textbook to read from while he ate, to make things a little less awkward and a little less sad. As usual.
Harry’s breathing had calmed down, he was no longer sobbing, but Draco could still feel a few stray, silent tears falling down his face.
“Brilliant!” He yelled, tossing Ginny her wand. “Now focus on putting a little more power behind it. Try leaning into it a little, pulling the strength from your legs.”
no!" She seemed shocked that he would suggest that. Draco was relieved, but also slightly hurt. “Besides, our relationship is purely academic.”
He sighed, scribbled “chaser” as his first choice and “beater” as his second, and grabbed a red shirt from Angelina and walked away. He stood awkwardly by the wall, looking around. A few younger students were flying through the air, warming up, but obviously just trying to show off. The older students, like Draco, were meandering around on the ground or standing off to the side. They also looked like they didn’t really want to be there, as they probably had tried out before and didn’t make it, or their friend had pressured them to tryout. He saw Weasley standing by himself nervously.
“You would not have to explain yourself if you never said that to begin with! Just because you said it behind my back, does not change the fact that you were badmouthing me to your friends.” She remained silent, and he raised his voice, feeling the betrayal bubbling and rising inside of him, bubbling and rising after he had pushed it down inside of him for a week and a half. “Why did you say it, to begin with?” He felt the anger bubbling, rising inside of him.
He struggled to concentrate. He remembered sitting by the fire with her, arguing over who had been in the wrong during their friendship. It was stupid, really. “I remember talking with her, then all of a sudden I just, I think I got really overwhelmed. I- I started shivering, and I felt like I was drowning, and I couldn’t hear anything and I felt like I-”
Seriously, the boy who lived, the only one to defeat Lord Voldemort, and he was scared to run at a brick wall?
Harry continued. “But that’s not an excuse. It’s really no excuse for me treating you so harshly and being so hostile. I’m sorry I punched your nose. And then all of a sudden you were so caring and
But he didn’t. Maybe it was because Ron was right, he needed to calm down. He was too tense, too stressed from studying and from being in a hot crowded room. Maybe it was because he wanted to try it, just to know what it felt like. He had never really been reckless before in his life. Maybe he should give it a shot? Maybe it was because he didn’t want people to keep thinking he was some pathetic loser. Or maybe it was because Harry still hadn’t taken his eyes off Draco since he had come down the stairs, and he didn’t want
And it is one of the few ways that can be used for good or evil. You could be the most brilliant potion master and have the option to help start a war or save one. It holds so much power, and just, I don’t know I’m just rambling now. Sorry.”
“Well, thanks fo’ that, mate!” Ron called out excitedly and played a Queen, causing Harry to groan in frustration once again and take a sip from his cup.
“Merlin, Harry’s the one with the savior complex, okay? We don’t need you piling onto that too.” When Draco didn’t say anything in response, she continued in a defeated voice. “Look, Harry’s my friend too. I don’t want to see either of you getting hurt, and I think you’re being absolutely ridiculous right now. Why would you do this? You remember what a mess everything was when you tried to withdraw yourself from me. You’re leaving him completely in the dark and honestly, you’re just being a dick. Just
“What rumors?” Harry interrupted Ron as he abruptly lifted his head up. “What have people been saying?”
PLEASE let me know what you think of this story! It is my first Harry Potter work, so it won't be perfect. I'm open to all forms of criticism, if you loved it, if you hate it, if you really don't care, anything!
Thanks so much to everyone who has read this! I did NOT expect so many people to read this so quickly! I love all of you so much <3
progress at all. And this is the situation I’m supposed to be using it for, and it’s like I haven’t had a single lesson!”
“So you admit it?” Draco smirked. He loved this. He loved teasing Harry, the playful banter. One day it was going to drive him insane.
"Well," Draco began, "there are four houses. My parents described them as families within Hogwarts. You take classes with them, eat with them, sleep with them, everything. There is Slytherin, who are cunning and ambitious. Ravenclaw, which has all the smart people. Gryffindor, where the brave go. They are all pretty cocky and annoying, though, if you ask me. And then there's Hufflepuff. They're just kind of the leftovers. They are potatoes, really."
“Stop that,” Harry opened his mouth like he was going to continue, but couldn’t seem to find the words to say as he shut his mouth with an annoyed expression.
As he began to read, he noticed she was still awkwardly standing next to the chair. “Take a seat, Granger. I cannot focus with you breathing down my neck.”
Draco really enjoyed his routine. He did not like it when things changed, he did not like it when someone disrupted his routine.
He closed his book and sat it beside him. Placing his hands on either side of his legs that were swinging off the side of the table of which he was sitting upon. “And what exactly did he say?”
She was curled in his lap, purring, as he read his Ancient Runes textbook with one hand, the other stroking her silky black fur. Of course, he did have his owl, too. But it wasn’t like he had anyone to write to. And besides, he couldn’t necessarily go and snuggle up with an owl in the owlery.
He continued to watch as the people around him got drunker and drunker. He found it amusing, watching them do all the things they wanted to do and say all the things they wanted to say when they were sober but didn’t have the guts to do.
He let out a sigh of relief at this, grabbing his towel and drying himself off before he slipped into his school robes. He picked up his neatly folded practice uniform and started to walk over to his locker so that he could pack up his stuff, fix his hair, and go.
He tried to shake the thoughts out of his head, focusing on his grip. But all he could think about was Harry’s fingers intertwining with his, and-
But he didn’t have to worry about that for most of the day, as he spent a good portion of it with Hermione. In fact, the two of them had almost exactly the same class schedule, so they usually partnered together and walked through the halls together.
deflect serious conversations?” Harry narrowed his eyes despite the smile crawling onto his face. “And besides, you’re the one who keeps circling the conversation back to your good looks-”
McLaggen was at the far left of the hoops, closest to him. He stared him directly in the eyes, positioning his body right at him, and threw the ball to the right-most hoop.
“Are we, though?” He asked. “This is the first night we’ve socialized without fighting. Can you really call that
It was the afternoon that the remainder of Hogwarts students would arrive at the castle, but Draco had been here all summer. He had been here every summer, actually. Apart from traveling to Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley, Draco had not stepped a foot out of Hogwarts since arriving in his first year. The morning after the sorting ceremony, he had received a howler from his mother. He can’t quite remember the exact wording, but it was something along the lines of “you have disgraced our bloodline” and “we hope to never see you again.” That meant that once summer rolled around, he was no longer welcome to return to The Manor.
Dean looks at Harry with bleary confusion. “She was all packed and you didn’t have a clue? You live together.”
“Eventually you get tired of waiting.” Draco says, putting to words the painful lesson of his own recently failed relationship.
“Yes, because of the war. Slytherin house was seen as evil for a very long time because some bad wizards came from the house. And a lot of students, including Slytherins themselves, believed that being in the house automatically made people bad. A lot of Slytherins also had parents who didn’t think that muggle born witches and wizards were equal to those from magical families.”
“Apology accepted.” Potter says quickly, sensing correctly that Draco will go on if he is allowed. “Though I think if we’re going to be friends you’d better call me by my given name.”
Harry couldn’t sleep - he looked over at Anthony who was snoring lightly, hair rumpled and face serene as though they hadn’t been fucking only a few minutes before. Anthony liked to call it making love, and phrase of which Harry was not particularly fond but tolerated for the sake of his fiance. Making haste was a more apt definition lately, the whole process careful and far too brief as Anthony often had to wake up in the early hours of the morning.
Harry had waited almost a month to see Teddy, so involved in the post-war clean up that he barely ate or slept. When he had finally arrived on Andromeda’s doorstep, their conversation had been clumsy and he was sure she hated him. Still, Harry persevered, showing up once a week to see Teddy no matter what was happening in his life. Slowly Andromeda’s hesitation changed to respect and then friendliness - she was in need of companionship as much as her grandson- the sudden empty space where the rest of her family had been was overwhelming at the best of times. She and Harry began to talk more, he would stay for tea after Teddy had been put down to nap or bring her a parcel of the fancy chocolate biscuits she favoured, a new book Hermione had recommended. Andromeda was smart and quick witted, and it didn’t take long for Harry to stop seeing Bellatrix in her features and start seeing Andy, who made a strong cuppa and told the most wicked stories about her days at Hogwarts: first girl on the Slytherin quidditch team in over a century, never quite making prefect due to her inability to keep her mouth shut when faced with something she did not like, quick with a hex if the situation called for one. The Weasleys began to go with Harry on some of his visits, a slow trickle of guests bringing food and baby clothes, toys and entertainment. Together they had created a patchwork family - they looked slightly odd from the outside but that didn’t matter to any of them.
Till now. Because as Harry watches the other man strain toward the snitch, sweat beading on his face, he feels his mouth go dry. As Ashcomb’s fingers close over the tiny golden ball, a latent realization finally pops through Harry's hazy mind like a cork.
“Yes papa” Scorpius said, crossing the room to tuck himself into Draco’s arms. “I ate pumpkin pancakes and Mrs Weasley gave me this Holyhead Harpies robe!”
“Co-head - Dean and I were the first people to complete the program so it was essentially by default. Before this, the DMLE took on any reports of orphans or child abuse, but they’re not very well trained in the matter and quite frankly did more harm than good. What is essentially lacking from the magical world is any sort of understanding of intersectionality. There’s next to no social support, just utter death on one end and the Janus Thickney ward on the other.” Potter stops, grins awkwardly. “Sorry, I’m pretty passionate about this but I don’t mean to talk your ear off.”
“That’s right. And here’s Rule Number Two - you and I are a great family all on our own. Although sometimes Aunt Pansy is there too.” He leaned forward to envelope Scorpius in a hug, tightening his arms around the small boy.
Harry had his doubts, but he folded them up and shoved them into the back of his mind where he kept the tiny, nagging worry that he and Anthony were making a mistake getting engaged so early. Hermione had told him a thousand times that he self-sabotaged due to childhood trauma and not believing he deserved anything good. Anthony was something good.
.” Daphne says appreciatively. “I wish I could stick around to see why he’s been staring at you for the past twenty minutes, but I’ve got to dash.” She kisses Draco on the cheek and is gone before he can protest.
“Right.” Harry tried to strain his memory for the name of the Greengrass sister who had been in his year at Hogwarts. “That would be Daphne and - who is your other Aunt?”
Rose turned serious brown eyes on Draco. “You know my mummy from school?” She asked skeptically, as though she didn’t quite believe Hermione had acquaintances with whom Rose was not familiar.
“I-I-” Scorpius tried and failed to explain, so overcome at seeing someone he recognised that it was all he could do to cling to Harry and sob. Harry scooped him up into a hug.
“Oh…” Potter trails off, raises a hand to run it through his hair, then seems to remember it is full of product and thinks better of it. “To be honest, I saw you get on and was curious.”
“I just have to get my bag from Rosie’s room!” Scorpius was off in a flash, leaving the two men alone.
“Scorpius called into the Mind Healer Hour and told them his Christmas wish was for me to find a new love.” Draco blushed furiously. “Truth be told, I was feeling morose and went on a slightly wine filled ramble about what I think love is. Now apparently everyone and their mother has opinions on it.”
Draco knew this to be a lie, but decided not to comment - Pansy had plenty of things she could reveal about him in retaliation and he was not about to risk it in her current state.
“That’s too far away!” Scorpius whined through a large yawn. “How old were you when you got to stay up till midnight, Harry?”
They exit via Whitehall Gardens, walking along the Thames in near silence. Around them, Muggles crowd the streets - tourists, Draco realises, chuffed that he has been able to put his Muggle Studies N.E.W.T to use already. Potter surprises him by leading them to a café set just off the road on the edge of a large garden, nicer than anything Draco had anticipated. They choose a table on a terrace in the back, shaded by trees and sparsely populated, but not a word is exchanged between them till they’ve ordered.
“No, wait.” Rosie said decidedly, striking out their first line. “We should make it look like it’s from your papa."
After dinner, Arthur brought Harry out to his toolshed for a chat - Anthony had been cornered by Rose who demanded he explain Hanukkah to her in detail after Harry had let slip he would be meeting the Goldstein family at that year’s celebration.
“It’s quite alright.” Draco can’t help but be charmed by Sayeda’s enthusiasm. “I was in Slytherin. Yes, I played Quidditch against Harry and -” he leans in conspiratorially “- I beat him at it a couple of times.”
“You haven’t been together that long, have you?” Potter produces a thermos from his bag and pours tea into the attached mug. He looks around, then pulls a muggle rubber out as well and discreetly transfigures it into another cup, filling it before he slides it across to Draco.
Invasive questions aside, Draco does, in fact, have a very good idea of how he would like the future to unfold. He has imagined them living in Ernest’s flat, a bright second story on the newly popular Gryphen’s row in Mayfair’s hidden magical subsection. They will make love in Ernest’s enormous king-size bed, eat meals together in the cheery dining room; Draco will study for school while Ernest works on his latest case. After some time, they will get a kneazle, have dinner parties where their Slytherin and Hufflepuff friends commingle with ease.
“Yes.” Draco said after a moment. “Your grandfather raised me to believe that muggle borns were not as good as those from long magical lines. He taught me that being pureblood - a term that is considered very rude these days - meant we were superior wizards.”
“Ah, your true intention is revealed.” Draco considered - it was tempting, the man was handsome and it had been more than a decade since he had had a one night stand. Almost as long since he’d had sex with anyone except his wife, come to think of it, though there had been a couple of occasions with Theo and Astoria that they had all promised never to disclose to anyone (Pansy knew, of course. But Pansy knew everything.)
No matter how many times he looked over the documentation - the trials, reviews, and backers they had accumulated over the past few months - he could not concentrate. After giving it an honest fifteen minutes of effort, Harry found himself sitting on the couch with a packet of crisps and a beer, idly flicking on the wireless.
When Scorpius shook his head, she gently grabbed his arm, tugging him out of the office and back down to the kitchen for another round of planning.
Brunch was pleasant and the party smaller than anticipated - Bill and Fleur and their youngest, Luis, were visiting Fleur’s parents in France. Percy and Audrey had arrived with baby Molly in tow, George and Angelina were there with Fred and Roxanne, and Luna had brought her friend Rolph along in what Harry soon learned was a misguided attempt between her and Ginny (conspicuously absent due to a work event) to set him up. Luckily Charlie was back on a rare visit home and had captivated Rolf with tales of Siberian snow dragons so thoroughly that he barely said two words to Harry. That was fine with him - Harry was in no mood for a blind date and still felt upset over the previous night. He half-considered telling Ron and Hermione about it, but was worried about the latter’s reaction as Hermione had become strangely protective of Draco over the past few months.
“You didn’t tell me Teddy would be staying with us.” He began as they passed an ice rink packed full of children.
Draco took a steadying sip of his eggnog latte - he had become quite fond of them since their first initial meeting, though he still preferred strong black tea - then shook his head. “Just surprised, is all. I didn’t know Potter was-”
“Who would have thought, a Weasley-Granger and a Malfoy being such good friends?” Harry joked once he had caught up to the conversation. “Rosie definitely isn’t a Slytherin, I wonder if Scorpius will be in Gryffindor?”
“So you’re saying you heard this bloke on the radio. Talking about his dead wife. And now you’re...in love with him?”
Molly’s army of food was still waiting for instruction. “Honestly - to the fridge with all of you.” She said, waving her wand in irritation. Most of the dishes obeyed, but a plate stacked high with breakfast food remained, inching slowly toward Harry, who reached out to take it when it got close enough.
There was a brief shuffling in the background, and a child’s voice was barely audible as he called out “Papa? There’s someone in the floo for you!”
They were the first to go through, stepping out into Hermione and Ron’s living room. As they entered Harry made a thoroughly juvenile joke about floo rhyming with poo that sent Scorpius into peals of laughter, and they were both so caught up in their merriment that they did not notice Draco sitting on the couch.
His quest brought him to the second floor. In his defense, the toilet on the first had been occupied by a very amorous couple, and so he had slipped upstairs to see if there was another on offer. Not technically proper guest behaviour, but his bladder dictated action. Low and behold, there was one on the upper landing across from two closed doors.
Potter looks as though he’s about to respond, but their server reappears, setting fish and chips before Draco (he couldn’t resist ordering the muggle delicacy) and a sandwich in front of Potter. The server lingers, smiling brightly at Draco. She asks if he wants more tea, how he’s enjoying his day, and it occurs to him that she might in fact be flirting. A shame, given that his proclivities swing solidly in the opposite direction, but it buoys him a little nonetheless.
“Wait!” Draco commanded in a voice so tinged with panic that he saw tears spring up in his son’s eyes.
“By age one most children have learned what the word no means.” Hermione, satisfied with Rose’s hair, turned to Harry. “He’s right on target for his developmental milestones too, aren’t you Hugo?” She chucked him under the chin and glanced up at Harry. “Do you want me to take him when we go through the floo?”
“I can’t wait!” He exchanges a warm hug with Fran and then Amani before the family walks on down the street. Harry and Draco pause a moment, watching them together, Sayeda between her parents with Fran’s arm still across her shoulders.
“Don’t let him scare you.” Harry’s hand is suddenly on Draco’s shoulder, a comforting and confusing weight. “Their buñuelo kisra is the best thing I’ve ever eaten.”
“Scorpius.” Draco warned. “Now is not the time and furthermore, it’s exceptionally rude.” He steered his awful son toward the fireplace and glanced back at Esme. “I’m just going to take him to his Aunt’s and then I’ll be right back.”
Malfoy is wearing the pale orange robes of a first year healer, which strikes Harry as odd given he was talking about it as a career more than three years ago. His hair is less stiffly coiffed now, and he looks relaxed, confident.
Harry reached up to straighten his glasses and there was a small ripping sound as the robes caught beneath his shoe and tore.
Harry choked a little on his drink and cast a searching look at Draco. “You came over here to hit on a bloke?”
Draco's coffees with Hermione had turned into a weekly date at the funny little cafe, the two of them meeting up after drop-off to chat over whatever strange coffee drink she could convince Draco to try. The novelty of sitting across from a person he had spent most of his childhood loathing and insulting had not yet faded for Draco. She had let him go through a heartfelt apology and self-flagellation once, then told him that would be quite enough. Despite this, Draco couldn't quite believe that Granger was now Hermione, and the girl he had called a mudblood was now a woman he called his friend.
Potter goggles for a moment, seeming to find difficulty in believing that it is Draco who Ernest has been snogging. For his part, Draco nods a quick hello and turns to give Ernest a final, cursory peck on the lips.
Draco had invited Hermione and assumed that by giving her a +1 on the invitation he was effectively inviting Wealsey and Potter as well, though he doubted very much that the latter would attend. His assumption and subsequent lack of preparation made it all the more surprising when the man in question walked through Draco’s front door amidst a small crowd of guests.
“Did you papa?” Scorpius had danced around the issue before, but this was the first time had had asked the question directly.
They’re at Paddington station, Draco about to board a train that will begin his journey to Cardiff for a healer’s conference. Ernest has tried to dissuade him from taking muggle transportation, but Draco has always loved trains and the journey is short enough to be pleasant but not tedious.
“They only have one more than regular dogs. And they get the second tail removed anyway.” Pansy pointed out, poking Scorpius in the side to make him giggle.
“Professor Mentis, from the Mind Healing Hour. We’ve been talking to your son, he’s very concerned about you.”
Even though he hadn’t seen Potter in twelve years, Draco’s chest tightened slightly, surprising him with the reaction a mere mention had conjured.
Draco waits till the server has come and gone before forcing the words out into the silence as his friends sip their respective drinks.
Draco nods, trying not to show his surprise. “You have time to figure out what you want and, I'd wager, plenty of options as well.” He tries not to let the bitterness creep into his tone but he must not have succeeded as Potter immediately changes the subject and asks how he enjoyed the Potions N.E.W.T.
“Oh Draco.” She said, mistaking the shock on his face for dislike. “Do you still hate him after all this time?”
“Sorry, I’ve been rude.” Harry pulls him forward by the elbow. “This is my friend, Draco Malfoy. We went to school together. Draco, this is Francisca and Amani.” The other two adults visibly relax, but Sayeda leaps forward and seizes the hand Draco has extended to her parents.
Draco withdrew, his body moving out of the intimate, charged space they had created. “Well” he said, throwing back the rest of his wine. His voice had gone all formal and polite. “I do hope you succeed. If you’ll excuse me it’s quite late and I think I should head home.”
“Oooh.” Pansy eagerly grabbed a letter, breaking the seal and unfurling the parchment to read. “Dear Sleepless in Shoreditch - really, Draco? - You are the most attractive wizard I’ve ever laid ears on.”
A woman’s pleading voice faded in. “I don’t know what to do Professor, every time we make love and I’m close to orgasm he gets up to have a pumpkin pasty.”
“I understand, I guess.” Potter finishes. “I wasn’t the best husband, too busy all the time with my job, especially in the early years while we worked to set up the department.”
Potter shakes his head. “Nah, I thought I would, once, but last year gave me a taste of it and I don’t think I’m really cut out for the job. To be honest, the idea makes me feel a little ill.”
“What is the number one rule for objects of unknown origin?” He asked, going over to rub a gentle hand across Scorpius’ back.
“That you like to drink lattes. That you purposefully put Scorpius in a multicultural school where he would meet muggle-born children. And that she considers you a friend, which is probably the highest recommendation you could get from anyone.”
He has just finished his opening paragraph when the train begins to move and, in the same instant, someone sits down across from him. He knows without looking up that it is Potter.
Draco and Esme had been dating casually for about a month when Valentine’s day came around. Draco had never been a fan of the holiday, he found it altogether too fussy and had really only gone along for Astoria’s sake till she had told him she didn’t much care of it either.
As he pulls A Day at the Races out of the sleeve, a note flutters to the floor. It is worn, having been folded and re-folded, the paper thin with age.
“No - no, wait!” Draco calls out, embarrassingly loud in the quiet hallway. Potter, who has turned and is about to walk away, pivots to look at him. Draco feels his face heat. “Lunch sounds good.”
Potter shakes his head. “That’s a shame, ‘cause I like your mum. She sends me a card on my birthday, did you know?”
Maybe it was that he had already polished off a bottle and a half of beer, but Harry felt his eyes well up with tears. He used the sleeve of his jumper to wipe them away.
Harry weighed his response. “I didn’t really have a family” he said at last “well, I had my aunt and uncle, but they didn’t like me very much.”
“She came home, right-” the crowd cheers and Harry’s attention is momentarily diverted from his monologue. He squints unnecessarily at the pitch (they are in the private box with unobstructed views) but can’t quite make out what has happened. “- and she tells me she’s moving out. I’m there, cooking dinner
Draco contemplated how to answer - truthfully or sarcastically. The low lighting and lack of audience made him choose the former. “Yes, but I was afraid I would become my father- he loved me, you understand, but he loved power more. I wasn’t sure I could be better. Astoria knew she wanted to be a mum, and I realized that together we had a better chance of doing things properly. Once I felt safe in that knowledge I could let myself want children again.” He studied Harry for a moment. “Who is it that doesn’t want to be a father - you, or your fiance?”
“Maybe to you.” Malfoy shrugged “I’ve always been open about it. You Gryffindors, so caught up in your own drama.”
“Hello?” The voice was pleasant and slightly aristocratic. Harry’s heart sped up a little, though he wasn’t sure why.
walk around Diagon Alley - it might not have been possible ten years ago, but he has worked hard to redeem himself, donated and volunteered and been as up front as possible about his mistakes. He’s pleased to say that these days he’s relatively anonymous, a hard-earned distinction his younger self would have loathed.
“I care.” She said, unable to meet his eyes. “Like I said, Draco, I wanted to date a normal wizard.”
It was nice to see Harry slightly wrong-footed without any of the less pleasant side-affects, so Draco nodded but didn’t say anything, taking another sip of Pansy’s drink.
“Don’t you like the one he has now?” Professor Mentis sounded like the kind of adult who shared secret, mocking looks with other adults over children's’ heads.
Pansy sniffed disdainfully and sipped her drink. “I went to Italy after the war - my mum’s family, the Arcuris, all live in the south of the country. I’ve only been back here a few years and I hardly have time for gossip.”
Short chapter, but I'm quite confident it won't take me a month to update the next one now that the tumult of January is over.
“Sorry Scorpius. Of course we can go inside.” He let the small boy lead him toward a row of cubbies; they found the one inscribed with Scorpius’ name in neat, precise handwriting, stowing his satchel and jacket before exchanging his wellies for soft-soled trainers. When Scorpius ran ahead of Draco into the classroom he felt a brief panic of loss, stumbling slightly as he hastened to follow.
“From Papa! He’s a wizard who-” Before Scorpius could continue his train of thought on the matter, the man in question appeared. He stopped short before them, his gaze travelling between Harry and Scorpius.
Harry nodded. “I told him I wanted to move Teddy and Andromeda into Grimmauld and Anthony said he didn’t want to be a parent. And that he didn’t want to stop me from doing it either.”
“He likes jam, Papa. Strawberry jam just like mummy.” Scoripus announced for what had to be the fourth time that hour as Draco spooned peas onto his plate.
Draco pauses for a moment as the silver apparition gallops around the room, coming so close that his robes flutter in its wake. It is impressive and somehow too personal at the same time, almost rude to request such a thing, and yet everyone does. Potter's adjudicators applaud, he manages an uncomfortable smile, and the stag fades away.
“Oh Harry.” Anthony took his hand and lead him off the bridge, over to a snow covered bench which he cleared with a flick of his wand. A second flick cast a warming charm as he pulled Harry down beside him. “Listen. I love you, I truly do. And I care deeply for Teddy and Andromeda. But I meant what I said about not being a parent. You agreed with me, at the time. Teddy might not be a baby, but he’ll still required care. He’ll still need parenting.”
Harry leaned forward and kissed him. “They’re going to love you. Ready?” Anthony nodded, took hold of his arm, and together they disapperated.
Something stirs in Harry, a peculiar feeling he doesn’t recognise and thus attributes to jealousy. Only Malfoy could look this good as someone drips blood on the floor at his feet, with his slightly rumpled hair and the robes that seem to actually compliment his features when they should, by any rights, wash him out entirely. Harry wants...something. Maybe he wants to be Malfoy? He’s still reeling from that thought when he steps out of the way of a lime-robed healer and knocks into a rather large table of pamphlets, sending it skidding across the floor and into a burly wizard with tree roots growing out of his nostrils.
And what had Draco done? Feeling that humiliation echo across years all the way back to the very first time Potter had rejected him, he’d stormed out of the bar like a child, destroying any chance of even friendship with the other man.
“It’s addressed to Sleepless in Shoreditch - probably another admirer of your father’s” Pansy said, working one long, deep purple nail under the wax seal so she could open it.
“Honestly Harry?” Hermione said, taking a sip from her own bottle. “This might be the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.”
“Harry! Harry!” It belongs to a little girl who is charging toward them, her glossy black curls bouncing. She has her face painted like a cat’s, white whiskers and a pink nose standing out against the dark brown of her skin. Harry turns around and Draco can see his face fill with happiness.
“Well then, I’d be honoured to continue the tradition.” He said, putting a hand on Arthur’s shoulder.
“Dear Sleepless in Shoreditch” Scorpius read aloud. “I am a 25 year old witch from N- Aunt Pansy, what does that say?”
Tbh I had an epilogue but it might be too saccharine for even me (and that's saying something because I love my happy endings) so for now we're going to stick with 9 chapters and call it a day.
“Is this your son?” She asked, then laughed “Sorry, of course he is, the hair is as much a giveaway as Rosie’s. Can’t escape those Weasley genes.”
Their conversation after this follows more neutral territory: the waves Granger is currently making at the ministry, their respective summer plans, Draco’s fish and chips. It’s awkward, as neither really knows how to be friendly with the other. Draco is glad when they both finish, and even more so when Potter does not order any pudding (he seems the type). They pay their bills and stand, hovering beside their table.
“That kneazle hates you with its entire heart.” Pansy counters, poking one of her long nails vengefully into his side.
“Or wizard.” Pansy quipped, then clapped a hand over her mouth as she realized she had just inadvertently outed Draco to his son.
Perhaps it is due to alphabetization, or the fact that very few students have chosen to sit their N.E.W.T.s at such a late date, but on a hot day in early July Draco finds himself sitting his exams in the same Ministry classroom as Harry Potter.
Draco sighed heavily and surveyed the mountain of letters in his living room, wishing he had never gone on the air in the first place.
Surprised at being drawn back into the conversation, Harry scrambled for an answer. “I never stayed up till midnight on New Years as a child.” He didn’t think explaining that he had frequently stayed up till midnight doing homework (or indeed, spying on Scorpius’ own father) would have the desired effect.
Draco’s cheeks pinked slightly at this and Harry could see him bite back a smile of genuine happiness.”I never would have imagined Hermione and I being friends and yet somehow she has become one of my best.”
“Hands off Potter.” Pansy said, thought Draco noticed she wasn’t trying very hard to get away. “Draco would be most upset if you put the moves on me.”
“What exactly is it that you do there?” Hermione had mentioned Harry worked with the Weasleys but hadn’t gone into detail and Draco, wanting to seem as though Harry didn’t interest him at all, had not pursued the conversation.
Potter nods at Draco when their eyes meet, formal but not hostile. It would still be enough to put Draco off if he hadn’t worked so hard preparing for this particular day. Despite his efforts at rehabilitating the Malfoy name through true philanthropic work (and court mandated community service in the Janus Thickney Ward) Draco is well aware that the Malfoy name is enough for most employers to reject him outright. It is no longer sufficient to simply do well, his achievements must stand above those of his peers so that he comes across as a desirable addition, someone who is worth the risk his reputation brings.
Harry felt a funny twinge of insecurity in his chest at this, but he pushed it down. “And now you’ve been married for  -”
“What?” Daphne looks quickly at Pansy to make sure she isn’t about to die before turning back to Draco. “When did you break up?”
Pansy laughed, though it died on her lips as she continued to read: “I know what it is like to lose people. I too lived through the war and came out of it wondering where love fit into a world like ours. Hearing you describe it so succinctly on the radio has made me lose my mind, a bit, and here we are.”
“Pleased to meet your Mrs. Weasley.” He said, offering her his hand which she bypassed in favour of wrapping her arms around his shoulders.
Harry can’t sleep, there’s a certain itch that gets under his skin sometimes, a refusal to quiet that has been with him since he can remember. Sometimes he can calm it by counting in his head, or trying to recall a particularly boring tidbit from History of Magic, but he often ends up lying in bed watching shadows move across the ceiling till morning.
Antony’s best friend, Mandy Brocklehurst, invited Harry and Anthony for tea in the first week of the New Year. Privately, Harry found Mandy rather dull - she and Anthony had both graduated Hogwarts to attend the same school of law, graduated top of that class, and taken up positions at the ministry. While Anthony took on cases for those who could not afford regular lawyer fees and worked tirelessly to rewrite blood purity hate crime legislation, Mandy had quit public defense after a year to start her own firm. Now she made a hefty paycheque helping rich widows and petulant second sons sue the estates of the deceased, among other endeavors. Mandy kept a flat in the Phoenix District that was chic but sterile, and Harry often found himself wishing for a misplaced slipper or dog-eared book, anything to indicate actual life
“I know it hurts, Harry, but it doesn’t mean you’re flawed. The two of you were incompatible, which happens sometimes, even when two people love each other. Do you really see yourself giving up on having a family? Not resenting Tony for holding you back from it?”
Scorpius nodded solemnly, an expression on his face that seemed far too old for such a small child. Harry wondered where he had gotten the idea that he needed to defend Malfoy’s parenting skills, and whether the Greengrasses had anything to do with it. It didn’t seem worth pressing the issue, though, because Scorpius had rapidly moved on to another topic. Harry listened as he recounted his recent trip to a Quidditch match, and discovered that they shared a favourite team. Eventually George and then Ron joined in on the conversation, which culminated in Molly digging out one of Ginny’s old team robes and shrinking it down to fit Scorpius. Harry wondered briefly what Malfoy would say when his son returned home in a green robe with Wingtips Weasley emblazoned over the shoulders and the Harpies’ logo beneath.
“Friends with children who will take their fun where they can find it.” Hermione said, then her face softened. “We want you to be happy, Harry. If it’s with this mystery man, or Draco, or Ernie-”
“Are you coming with us, Scorpius?” He asked, attempting to brush soot off his jumper - even after using the floo thousands of times he still felt as thought he hadn’t quite worked it out.
“Sort of.” He took a long drink from his pint. “There’s something I need to take a chance on, I think. Someone.”
Inwardly, Draco winced - over the many years of their acquaintance Daphne had had plenty to say about his hair. In their school days, following the unfortunate incident in fourth year, she had taken to calling him the “platinum ferret”. She really only let off when Draco started seeing Astoria, and of course she couldn’t say anything about it now that her beloved nephew bore the same pale blond locks. At least, not to his face.
“As much as I enjoy the thought of you clumsily trying to dance around the question, Potter, I’m afraid I haven’t the patience today. Yes, I’m gay. Yes, I’m dating Ernest.”
Draco blinked down at his son - he had the Malfoy hair, though it had picked up a slight wave by way of the Greengrass’ genetics so that it curled around the ears and temples of his pale little face. Eyes that were the same shade of blue as Astoria’s peered up at Draco with concern, and he felt a lurch of guilt at his own selfishness.
The library had a nice big fireplace, so when the time came it was quite easy for Scorpius to put down the comic he had been reading and sprinkle some stolen floo powder into the grate. He arrived in the Three Broomsticks at six pm, tumbling out of the fireplace on the heels of a family of four; just as Rosie had predicted, no one in the crowded pub paid any attention when he followed them out the door.
“Come on, we’ll be friends. I didn’t know anyone either, when I started, and you’re too small to be left alone.” She said, pulling him with her into the circle of children that had begun to form on the rug in front of their teacher.
Rosie had gone over the day with Scorpius so many times that it had become a mantra to him “Floo to the Three Broomsticks, find a family, follow them to the garden.” Rosie said that the festival was huge and Hogsmeade would be busy so it shouldn’t be too difficult a task. Scorpius wasn’t sure how she knew so much, but he was not about to question it. He believed in Rosie the way some muggles believed in their religious leaders, a similar devotion and reverence for whatever guidance she could offer. Scorpius would grow out of it, eventually, and they would find a more equal footing in their friendship. For now, he did as she said.
“I’m fine.” He says, to looks of disbelief. “I am. We’ve been growing apart for some time and I realized suddenly that we wanted different things.”
A bell chimes and almost as one, the group looks toward a spot just out of sight behind the reception desk. Whatever they see launches them excitedly down the hall, chattering and jostling each other as they go.
“We have our first floo call - what’s your name?” The smooth tones of Professor Mentis’ voice practically oozed out of the wireless.
Draco did a poor job of concealing his grin behind his mug, but if Hermione noticed she didn’t say anything.
Le Phénix was about what Draco had expected - upscale French cuisine, most of the tables occupied by couples on dates. His own companion for the evening, Esme, was already seated at a cosy corner table, a glass of white wine in front of her. She smiled when she saw him cross the room and Draco smiled back - she was very pretty, a round face and large blue eyes, brown curls pinned up in a loose knot on her head, a conservative but stylish purple dress. Exactly the kind of woman his parents would have loved till they found out one of her parents was muggle-born. As Draco had long ago decided such prejudices were ugly and beneath him, he had no qualms about that aspect of Esme’s identity.
“I was surprised - I mean, I get a lot of cards because” Harry waves vaguely at himself “but I have this sorting spell that puts the ones from people I know in their own pile, and every year there’s one from your mum.”
“You don’t have to convince me he’s a good father, Scorpius.” Harry told him gently. “I can tell he loves you a lot and anyone who sees how happy you are knows he’s good at it.”
There are a few moments of silence while they sit, lost in their own private thoughts. It’s not as awkward as Draco might have imagined, perhaps even companionable.
“Okay, just for you Professor, I’ll answer. Love means finding someone who fits. Someone who can see past my faults without turning a blind eye.”
“A couple of weeks ago, I was listening to the wireless.” He began, launching into the whole sordid tale for the only two people he could trust with the information. By the time he had finished, Hermione was on the dregs at the bottom of her cup and Ron was looking perplexed.
Harry’s eyes welled over again, and he shoved the bottle of beer away in disgust as he frantically wiped at his face.
“Do you really want to see Ernest over and over when you meet to exchange Tiberius?” Daphne asks reasonably. Draco doesn’t - he never wants to see Ernest again, in fact - but he’s a little too proud to admit that he’s hurt by the whole ordeal.
“Scorpius is very fond of Rose.” He agreed, trying to keep his voice level even as the realization broke over him that his equilibrium was rapidly diminishing under Potter’s gaze.
“I think we’re old enough to decide for ourselves.” Draco leaned forward, surprised to find himself flirting. “I promise I won’t tell anyone.”
“Thanks ever so.” Draco said to Pansy, wiping his hands on a tea towel before coming around to crouch down at Scorpius’ eye level. He had been waiting till Scorpius was a little older to have the “daddy is queer” talk with his son.
It’s the wrong choice- Potter’s face falls - but after a moment he answers quietly. “I’m getting divorced, actually.”
“Papa?” Scorpius asked, tentatively tugging to see if he could pry his fingers out of Draco’s grip. He couldn’t. “Papa, can we go inside now?”
Harry goggled at Ron while Hermione looked smug, as she often did when Ron blasted through someone’s self-involvement with unexpected insight. He was particularly good at doing this to his closest friends, though he reserved it only for the most dire of scenarios.
“You are terrible at this.” Draco can’t keep the glee from his voice - he hadn’t expected to trounce Harry so thoroughly on their first go. “Weren’t you raised by muggles? Shouldn’t it be easier for you?”
Pansy laughed and reached over to ruffle his hair. “I know you do, Scorpo, but your dad can’t marry someone just because they can bake. Besides, he’s going on a date tonight isn’t he?”
“It’s not him, it’s - listen, Draco, I just wanted to date a nice, normal wizard. Go out and have dinner, get drinks, maybe have sex if the mood was right. I don’t want to date a - a wizard who is using me to pretend he’s straight.”
“Keeping an eye on me, are you?” Draco has a can of vimto in his briefcase, and a packet of crisps (all part of his muggle train ritual) but he won’t allow Potter the satisfaction of seeing him consume them, so he gives in and sips from the mug. It’s not entirely Draco’s taste, and there is a slightly unpleasant flavour from the transfigured rubber, but it is hot and he is pleasantly surprised to discover that Potter is not the type to add sugar.
That did it - Molly was weeping openly now as she wrapped her arms around the pair of them. “Oh boys.” She sobbed against Harry’s shoulder.
Harry is about to ask for more details when Remus pushes the door open with one hip, seemingly unaware of Harry’s presence. He’s carrying a brown takeaway bag and whistling softly; there’s a joviality to him that Harry has never seen before and the look he gives Sirius is so fond it makes Harry’s chest tighten. It’s obvious, suddenly, that this is an old ritual - the second snifter, the music too low for anyone to hear.
“I’m sure he won’t be once he realizes how worried you are.” The Professor could talk paint off a wall with that cajoling voice.
Draco felt blindsided. In the years since he had seen Harry Potter the man had changed in ways that only accentuated Draco's attraction to him. He still had his trademark green eyes and messy hair (though it appeared to have been somewhat tamed for the occasion) but these days he was sporting a close-cropped beard and seemed to have learned how to dress himself, kitted out in deep green robes over a black button-up and slacks, a sprig of holly pinned to his lapel. The scar stood out on his forehead, a white fork of lightning that disrupted his light brown skin and part of one eyebrow. His smile was easy and bright, his stride confident as he walked into the room at the back of the group, catching Hermione when she tripped over the edge of the rug so that her stumble was barely noticeable.
“Mummy got sick and it happened, just like that, and there was nothing anybody could do. If we start asking why we'll go mad.  So, rule number one: we don't ask why.”
