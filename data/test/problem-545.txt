Draco just realised how much he actually liked Potter. The stupid git was messing with his head. Draco slurped back to the empty common room. His dorm room was also empty. And it was going to stay empty.
"We haven't even had dinner.", Ron protested.
Draco rolled his eyes and nodded again. "Yes, Theo. I'm sure."
"Mr Malfoy. Your son is the most beautiful person I have ever met. Not only on the outside, but also on the inside. Draco is interesting, he can be so kind if he wants to. He makes me incredibly happy. I love to talk to him and only listening to him is satisfying enough. I love his face, and if I'm allowed to say that, his face comes a strangely lot after yours. He is handsome and his hair- I can't even say what I love about his hair. Draco is simply amazing. He gives me the feeling to be loved and sometimes when I'm with him, nothing else matters. He is interesting and talking to him frees me. I can share everything with him, from my past, to the present. He understands me, because he had been through a lot, just like me. He's interested in everything about me and I'm interested in everything about him. I love him, Mr Malfoy. I love your son.", Harry answered.
"Lucius Malfoy, known to be a Deatheater since the beginning of Voldemort's reign, is going to have his trial next week. His wife and only son are going to attend the trial and are going to watch their husband and father being sentenced to something worse than death."
"Hermione, do you want to study with me right now?" He asked at the sight of books and quills and rolls of parchment.
Harry smiled. He loved her. Ron grabbed a piece of parchment and they both dipped their quills in ink and started to write an answer. Harry told Hermione that Malfoy was doing fine, he was currently playing the piano with Teddy. Ron told her about his work and that he missed her as well. As usual, they filled the envelope with pictures - this time some of their Halloween celebration. Bond squeaked happily as Harry have him the envelope and he jumped out the window.
"Mister Harry Potter!", one house elf said excitedly. Harry smiled at her and looked around.
"All I can say is he is unconscious but out of immediate danger."
As Hermione said this, Harry opened his eyes. He emptied his coffee mug, put it back on the table and looked at Hermione and Ron.
"He's coming?", Hermione asked after Harry had told him, what Draco said said.
"Wait," Potter said and Draco stopped moving. He let go of Potter's hands and took a step back.
"So let's go." Hermione said with a grin on her face.
"See you at mom's next week," Ron said before they left the house.
Malfoy rolled his eyes and crossed his arms in front of his chest. "Don't fool yourself, Potter. I just don't feel like playing anymore."
"Draco wanted to meet you.", Potter answered.
"You were?", she asked even more surprised,
"Draco?", Potter asked after a while. Draco turned around and kissed him.
. In the battle of Hogwarts, where most of our dearest family members and closest friends died, I saw him as well. Mr Malfoy" Potter raised his voice "was afraid!"
"Wha- No! You did everything perfect! Too perfect.", Harry added under his breath.
"What happened?", Longbottom wanted to know.
.", Hermione said.
Draco separated from Pansy and looked to the stairs. Theodore Nott stood there and grinned.
"Yes.", he said, "As always."
"Why? What's going on?" Harry asked.
"I am, idiot." Draco said, "But it's not a big deal."
"It's weird thinking about it, isn't it?" Harry said scratching his head.
"And?", Harry asked and walked over to Draco.
"What do you want?" Draco asked.
Before Harry knew what happened, Malfoy leant forward and pressed his lips on Harry's. Harry's heart skipped a beat and he opened his lips a little. Malfoy's tongue darted inside his mouth and explored every corner. Their hands separated from each other and Malfoy lay his on Harry's cheek and Harry lay his on Malfoy's waist. The kiss got more intense and fierce.
"We prepared a song for you." Hermione said.
And Hermione was right. Pansy stood in front of them not ten seconds later. She hugged Draco and shook Harry's hand.
"That I put down in words," Draco sang with a voice so soft, "How wonderful life is while you're in the world."
"A surprise?", Ginny asked and looked at Harry. He shrugged.
Dean gave Ron his Chocolate Frog card with his face on it and he looked so proud his face almost exploded.
"Harry." Seamus looked Harry in the eyes, "Do you currently have a crush on someone?"
"Who am I to judge?" He said chuckling. Harry laughed through his tears. This was as beautiful as he had hoped for it to be.
to lie in bed but Harry told him to.  And against his belief he needed to be taken care of. Harry helped him go to the bathroom because Draco wasn't supposed to walk on his own. Nott was a very big help as well. He and Harry cooked for Draco, who apparently enjoyed being served - old habits die hard, Harry guessed.
?", she asked and narrowed her eyes.
"Are you okay?" Weasley asked.
"And now," McGonagall said loudly, "dig in!"
Draco's hands were gentler than usual, one in Potter's hair and one moving, deft and delicious, drawing long sighs of pleasure and need from Potter.
"You are a bad person, Flynn," Neville said, "I think you act too brave for your own good." Harry nodded. "I can only agree," he said, "But don't worry we'll teach you a little lesson."
"You take your own hostage.", the merpeople said, shaking their heads.
"Finally a normal birthday." Harry joked.
Harry opened his eyes again and laughed. "Yeah, you're very cute."
While Potter was busy in the bathroom, Draco put on a black slim shirt and his leather shoes, a silver watch and a ring. Potter came out of the bathroom just as Draco was leaving the dorm. Weasel and Granger were waiting in the common room and when Draco passed them, they looked at him in disgust - as usual. Draco didn't bother talking to them so he walked past the two idiots and down to the Great Hall.
? Was it one? His eyes wandered to Malfoy. He still hasn't said anything, he just let them insult him and did nothing. Harry was surprised.
Draco looked up. Potter was standing in front of him, he was fully dressed and seemed to have showered already.
"Draco!" Harry half-moaned.
Harry walked slower and then, he came to a halt. Malfoy sat on the edge of the lake, levitating small pebbles into the nearly frozen water. He had his back turned at Harry, but Harry knew Malfoy wasn't smiling. Malfoy's hair was shining slightly in the dim moonlight. He hadn't noticed Harry yet, so Harry silently walked closer. Just behind Malfoy, he took the cloak off and sat down next to the Slytherin. Malfoy looked at Harry.
He walked out smirking. On his way to his room, he passed many students in the corridors standing in groups and talking and laughing. Every time Draco passed them, Draco earned cold looks.
"He really wanted me to say sorry!" Draco forced a laugh, "Can you believe it?"
"It was not as funny as it sounds now.", Harry laughed.
"Uh... yeah..." Neville answered nervously, "Just one second!"
Potter lay in his bed, a small smile carving his lips and his red pyjama peeking out from under the blankets. Draco sat down on the edge of the bed smiling and thrust his fingers over Potter's cheek.
"Well, I expected to see you in the hospital this morning.", he answered shrugging. Hermione froze and looked at him with an apologising look.
"Mr Malfoy?", Pansy asked worried. Lucius blinked slowly.
He stared at the unfamiliar ceiling and missed the ceiling in his room. He missed Potter.
"So she did. I thought she has something like a duty of secrecy.", Draco rolled his eyes,
"Yeah... well...", he stumbled. Draco smiled and kissed Harry's chest.
"You don't want to celebrate your birthday
"You have brought shame and disgrace on our honorable family name. Explain yourself! Helping Potter out of the hospital wing?! Have you learned nothing? I thought I have raised you well, I thought you were the one I could hold on to. Your mother has gone crazy as well when she dared to ask Potter for help and bring him to my hearing. But you? I would have never imagined my son, my own flesh and blood, to be less Slytherin than I have taught him to be. All the values I taught you, all the rules you were supposed to follow. Yet there was only one thing I ever really asked you to do: stay away from Harry Potter. He is our enemy!"
"Come on. I've got faith in you.", Potter said. Draco looked at him and smiled.
Potter smiled, gave his friends a look and then decided not to give Draco a kiss. Draco was absolutely fine with that, he honestly wasn't going to as well. "I'm fine. Really fine," Potter said smiling.
Everyone stared at Malfoy. What was this all about?
"Now, Ron and I are going to search our rooms.", she said and left Harry and Malfoy alone.
"That's a stupid question, even for you, Potter.", Malfoy answered.
"I swear, if you hurt my best mate-", Weasley said threatening.
Draco nodded. He was relieved Potter's friends were giving him a chance. But why exactly? Before Draco could ask, Granger talked. "After breakfast we'll pack our stuff and leave with everyone else, we can't disapparate here."
They clinked glasses - Malfoy rather hesitantly - and drank.
"Talk to me." Harry repeated.
"What? No!", Harry answered.
Potter came into Draco's mouth and shuddered. Draco lay over him into the table and he felt Potter's breath. And then Potter pulled back, just an inch, and waited.
"Shut up!", Draco said loudly.
"I really have no idea.", he answered, not completely truthful.
"So, first, because you're the only person I'm going to spend my holidays with and not to forget that I only stay here because you do-",
"Sod off, Pansy.", he said annoyed and she backed away, disappointed.
"I don't," Malfoy said and came closer.
"Well, he was killed in the war. Sometimes mum confuses him and George." Ginny said.
"I was the only one that could stop him, I wasn't going to give up. I had to keep going."
"And you were talking about some stupid stuff."
"Harry.", Draco breathed softly and Harry shuddered.
Harry groaned.
"Draco, now tell me!", Potter laughed and kissed him.
Several people backed away from the scene, watching from a safe distance. Harry's face reddened with anger. He wouldn't let anyone talk to him or Draco like that.
? What's wrong with you people?", Draco asked angrily.
"Good. See you.", Potter said and Draco looked up.
"You can take him with you if you want, of course." Malfoy said when he finally sat in a comfortable position, "I'd love to see him."
Before Harry could answer, Malfoy ordered another round. The tired bartender filled their glasses with firewhiskey again and slurped back over to talk to her colleague.
Draco just hoped Potter didn't expect them to have a conversation now.
"So, where are you two going?", she asked.
Draco squirmed beneath him, which was brilliant and, Harry suspected, addictive, so he redoubled his attack, easily finding sensitive spots.
"Potter.", Harry could hear Malfoy's voice in his head.
"I don't care. Get out!"
"Oh shut up." Malfoy snapped, crossing his arms in front of his chest.
They all went inside Harry's clean living room, where Kreacher was lighting candles.
"Malfoy." Harry said softly, "You can't fool me."
going back there. Look at us. We're going to out room."
"You should probably know that being with me means you would have to deal with stuff like that a lot more often. I mean I'm in a damn lot of articles in the /Daily Prophet/ and they are going to talk to you too. Or watch you. Or take pictures. You'll never be safe of them when you're with me." Harry said.
Now, Harry could control if he wanted to tell Hermione or not, he felt more confident because Ron was by his side and he knew that Draco had not
"Guess you'll have to tell Granger we'll be only three." Theo said, sitting down in his worn-out armchair.
"I understand. He's really the cutest thing I have ever seen." Hermione said smiling.
!", Mr Malfoy said loudly.
Harry woke up at night and looked around. Though the room was dark, Ron's snores showed him he was still there. Harry's bed, however, was empty. He put on his glasses and grabbed his wand. Whispering, "Lumos" Harry got up and walked downstairs. He stopped when he saw the light in the living room was still on. Harry didn't want to eavesdrop once again, he expected Mr and Mrs Weasley talking.
Malfoy looked at Harry. "I don't know."
With beautiful and neat handwriting there was written:
"Again?" Ron asked with a full mouth.
"I'm sorry I didn't bring you a present. Didn't know I was coming." Malfoy said and felt visibly uncomfortable.
Malfoy shifted uncomfortably and Harry was afraid he would wake up, but-
"Why are you not eating in the Great Hall?"
Weasley came back into the kitchen and walked closer to the table between them. "Well, I
"No, it's not. I just wanted to ask what memory you choose for your Patronus.", Harry said. Draco didn't answer.
"Jus-" Malfoy started and gulped, "Jus' two bottles." He held up three fingers.
"Yes. Now get back to sleep.", Malfoy said.
"I'm sorry I'm such an idiot," he said quietly.
Potter's hand loosened and Draco turned  away again. Potter stood there, staring at Draco. He didn't say anything. Draco felt more uncomfortable with every second, but-
Straight after Harry came back from the bathroom, he wanted to talk to Ron and Hermione and tell them about what he had found out.
. Harry smiled and walked towards him.
"Yeah. Something about plant poisoning, but they aren't sure yet." Harry said, "The clothes?"
"Potter.", he whispered.
After the game show, Harry put Teddy to sleep in his crib. Harry sat on his bed next to the crib and told the brown-haired baby a story about an amazing man named Remus Lupin. Harry had started this ritual not long ago and he wanted to keep it up until Teddy would be old enough to understand. Harry wanted him to know about his parents. After the child had fallen asleep, Harry sat and watched him for a while to make sure he was really asleep.
"You don't think...", Draco stammered. Potter nodded.
"Everyone, let's sing a happy birthday to our Harry!"
"Excuse us, that we're late. Ron forgot his book in the other room and we had to go back.", Harry explained sorry.
"You know, Malfoy, when you want to be nice to me then you could just ask me if I want to sit down and not talk to me like I'm a dog," Harry said.
"No, he's not.", Harry answered shortly.
"Wait, I am the man of your dreams?", Potter asked smirking.
Kyle threw himself at Draco without another word and grabbed his collar. Harry didn't know what to do - he couldn't help Draco, they were too intertwined to cast a spell. He felt so stupid and helpless, standing there watching this guy that put Draco in the hospital fight him again. Several people grabbed each Draco and Kyle and pulled them apart. Draco fought himself free from the grips.
"Common room, probably. You know the password.", Harry answered and Draco nodded.
Harry grinned at Draco and they got into the car. At first, Draco was hesitating to get into a Muggle thing, but he did it anyways.
Harry nodded. "No problem."
They sat and drank and talked for hours. At around eleven, something coming from Potter was ringing really annoyingly.
"We could go to the Leaky Cauldron for dinner if you want."
She stepped out from behind a curtain and as she saw an unconscious Potter, she didn't even ask.
"Anyways." Malfoy then said, "I should get going."
Hours passed and Draco's eyes burned a hole into the dark wall in front of him. He wanted to sleep. He wanted it so desperately, but he could feel someone caressing their fingers though Draco's hair. Potter had a thing for Draco's hair.
Potter cut himself off and blushed hardly. Draco grinned. He already did the damage.
Harry took the phone again and opened the chat. He scrolled back to the first message. Hermione had answered that she would be happy to join and that she would meet Harry in half an hour.
Of course he was going to go, after all he was the one who asked, but Draco would never let Theo know that, not after Theo said they were going to be boyfriends. What a ridiculous thought. It was obvious that Draco would never get a
Draco took out his wand and conjured stones to fly into the water. Suddenly, it came to his mind that he had to tell Weasley and Granger about Potter.
Malfoy nodded again. "I guess."
"But we have to go shopping for clothes first, I don't want you to show up in that hideous sweater of yours." Malfoy added before he left.
"Yeah, I guess it comes in handy when you don't have to fear for your life," Harry joked.
"I just want to state-" the Slytherin looked at the portraits on the walls, then at Harry, "that I'm not here because I'm a wuss. I can take care of myself perfectly fine."
"Wow, I'd love to go!" Ron said with a wide smile.
"Glorious.", Harry smiled, but Malfoy didn't react as he had thought he would. He barely smiled, but looked rather serious.
Harry had to smile. All the pressure was gone now. And Harry was satisfied with himself to make Hermione wordless like this.
"Harry, I'm not comfortable with breaking into Malfoy's drawer. Besides, shouldn't you trust him now?"
Malfoy chuckled quietly, but not too quietly for Harry to hear. He cut into his steak, shoved the piece into his mouth and washed it down with some lemonade.
"Dunno." Malfoy mumbled with the cigarette stuck between his lips.
Harry always found these robes ugly, but Draco somehow managed it to look strangely good in them. Or only Harry thought he was looking good in them, he wasn't sure about that.
Kissing Harry again, Malfoy moved backwards, guiding Harry - unexpectedly - towards his bed. Before they reached it, Harry stopped.
"Because."
Harry smiled softly. "I know. Me too."
"How?" Draco said out loud and cried even harder.
He actually went to class with these people. To class! It was unbelievable that Draco was willing to be seen with them. He noticed a lot of passing students looking at him with confused looks, but all Draco could think about was Potter's proud smile when he saw Draco being nice to people from other houses. Draco thought about this smile the whole day in class.
Harry didn't react. He sat down on the chair next to Ron.
"Where's Malfoy?" He asked while he put his purchases into the kitchen.
"Well that has never happened before," Potter said and laughed. Draco couldn't help himself and he joined in.
Harry stopped in mid-track. What if he really was in love with the git he had to share a room with? He walked faster and eventually run the last corridor to their room.
Harry noticed exactly when Malfoy fell asleep. Harry smiled and watched him, but also dozed off eventually.
"Wow.", Harry breathed.
"Yeah, I mean I don't know what you did but you look so... not as scrawny as you were in the first years of Hogwarts. You're actually-" he looked for a word, "muscular."
On top of everything, Potter did something brilliant- he pushed forward, rolling Draco onto his back, his hands sliding beneath Draco's shoulders and his weight settling between Draco's thighs.
"Maybe.", Harry said and shrugged again. Ron laughed.
"Do you- what do you-"
"Goodnight."
"Draco, do you want cotton candy?", Harry asked Draco and kissed him.
"Fine. But Pomfrey went me out and said Potter needs rest. So no visitors till three p.m.", Draco told them and Weasley's shoulders sunk.
Harry thought maybe Draco waited for Harry to kiss him, but Harry wasn't sure and he didn't want to do anything wrong, so they stood there for a minute and looked at each other, both of them unsure of what to do.
"I really needed this now.", Draco said, "But, you know, I need something else as well..." He wiggled his eyebrows and Harry laughed.
At the peak of the party - when everyone was just the right amount of drunk - they played songs so loud the neighbors must have heard it through the silencing charms all around the building. Harry talked to a lot of the people at the party - drunk people seemed to be getting along better than sober people. Harry and Draco danced to the music and somewhat around that time, they stood in the corner making out. Malfoy tasted like firewhisky, but Harry loved it. The first time they had kissed in front of the people at the party, a lot of them cheered and clapped and Malfoy smiled into the kiss, what made Harry feel tingly.
"Potter...", Draco called after him, but Harry already had closed the door behind him.
"It was?" Malfoy's tone sounded surprised.
"Ah, my worthy successor." Wood said and Angelina laughed.
Malfoy opened his eyes and looked at their hands, then at Harry, and even though Harry expected a freaked out look, the corner of Malfoy's mouth only twitched a little and he closed his eyes again. Harry did the same thing and let his clothes soak in the rain. It was nice - hearing the rain pelting, birds singing somewhere in a dry spot, the chilly air around them, the sun slowly setting and not to forget holding Malfoy's hand.
"No, Draco. I don't want to see them."
They finished eating and then spread into their dorms. To Draco's surprise he found that a lot of Potter's stuff was already gone. His trunk was gone, his bed was neatly made and his closet was half empty. His toothbrush and other products in the bathroom were gone. Draco sighed, then started to pack his own stuff. He opened his trunk and pulled out a lot of clothes from his closet. Draco grabbed his toothbrush and other stuff and put them in a kit, which he put in the trunk.
"A warm one. Thanks.", Draco answered and smiled.
Ron and Harry looked at her.
"Don't laugh!", Draco's voice was shaking and Harry was under the impression that Draco might start to cry soon.
"Cool!", Ron applauded, "Dean and Seamus are planning to throw a party in two days. Of course we all want you to come."
"Hagrid gave it to me after first year.", Potter said and opened the book.
Even though Draco supposed Potter only wanted to cheer Draco up, he got so angry. What did Potter know?
"I dare you to ruin another year for me! Hogwarts is the only thing I have left and I bloody dare you!" Harry said angrily.
Harry smiled. Now he was neat too, just like Malfoy.
"Well then. Sit." Weasley pointed at the couch.
Harry opened the package and grabbed his frog before it could jump out and leave. Harry bit off the head of the frog and let the chocolate melt in his mouth. He felt less awkward than he had expected. Malfoy ate his licorice wand and the two of them just looked at the field in front of them. The weather was cold, but Harry felt warm.
"We'll see." Draco said and sharply turned around. He and Blaise left the compartment, banging the door behind them. The two of them passed more doors until they had reached the last wagon of the whole train. This is where all of the Slytherins used to sit, now there were all of the ones that had returned and three little first years. Draco knew all of the Slytherins that sat in here because most of them were from his year. Some of them were one or two years under him and only very little were from the former first or second year.
Harry laughed, nodding.
"Bring him to the bed over here.", she said, pointing on one bed with grey blankets, that looked just like every other bed in the room.
Neville noticed him staggering and Malfoy stumbled. "I'm so sorry!" Malfoy cried out and Neville could hear how hard it was for him to lift and control his tongue.
"He was here every day. On the first day he slept in front of the door and he brought you something to eat in case you wake up.", the healer interfered in their conversation. Harry smiled again.
"I'll do it."
The elf grinned and tapsed back to the others. Harry looked at Malfoy and he looked back at Harry.
"But you know you can take Teddy with you, right?" Draco said and shifted lightly under the covers, then pulled a face like that movement had been very painful.
"So." Malfoy started and drank a little as well just so he didn't have to finish that sentence, but Harry didn't say anything either. "This is awkward." Malfoy stated then.
sitting there!" Draco protested. He looked around and saw Blaise sitting with his new friends.
"What are you doing here all alone?" Luna asked with a questioning look.
Reaching Grimmauld Place 12, Harry was out of breath and not feeling very good. He stormed upstairs and into the bathroom, kneeling down in front of the toilet and coughing. When he saw that he coughed blood, he grabbed a towel from the sink and wiped his mouth.
He came back with a box of chocolate truffles.
Harry shrugged wordlessly and took another step towards Draco. Draco looked at Harry with his intense grey eyes and Harry smirked. He had never felt this brave before and especially not when it came to kissing someone he liked.
The air was cold and Harry immediately started to freeze, but his face and ears were heated from excitement. Some students were outside, playing in the little snow that had already fallen. They watched Harry running after Malfoy, who was gaining speed with every step he took.
"We know. But you don't have to either," Longbottom said.
"This was Lucius' 40th birthday, so Draco was two years old.", answered Draco's mother.
"Yes. Your parents must have told you so much about the evil Slytherins that tried to kill every muggleborn and helped to destroy the school we are heading to in a battle where they had killed hundreds of people." Draco said and was pleased with himself because he portrayed it really good.
"That was the third time you've smiled." Draco rolled his eyed again.
"You- uh- you look nice." Harry finally said.
There was a huge conflict between them where Harry didn't know if it could be solved. Draco would never admit his father had done anything wrong and Harry would never forgive Lucius or Bellatrix.
Harry stood at the bar with a drink in his hand and watched Draco dance with Seamus and Ginny while Hermione danced with Pansy. Harry smiled and emptied his glass. He grabbed a pair of headphones from beneath the bar and plucked them into his mp3 player. He selected a song and put them on Draco's head.
Harry nodded and repeated.
Draco felt more uncomfortable than ever before. Normally he had Potter by his side or he was getting breakfast when everyone else did. But now everyone has already finished eating and was standing everywhere.
"Like Pansy?" Potter asked.
"He tried to protect me.", Draco answered and Granger rolled her eyes.
"Draco, come on out. The food is getting cold."
"See, that's what you call good manners." She said sternly to Ron and George, who pulled a cracker they have sneaked to the table.
Harry smiled. "I don't care."
Draco woke up with dried tears on his cheeks. He looked around.
Harry shook his head solemnly. "I'm not, I promise."
"Do you think he likes you too?" Hermione asked at breakfast.
What? Harry didn't know. He didn't ever think of it.
All his friends were there, gathered around a table filled with Harry's favourite breakfast. And it smelled delicious. Harry's stomach rumbled, so Neville decided they should eat. Luckily, Harry was in Malfoy's bed, so his friends found space to sit in his own bed. They were all together, Harry and his friends AND Malfoy. That was something special. And the snowflakes outside made everything even more magical.
"You know Sirius, my godfather right?", he asked. Draco nodded and listened.
Malfoy looked at him in shock, unsure what to say and finally shook his head.
"What? Who says I do?"
Malfoy agreed nodding.
He turned to look at Lucius.
"Like what?"
"You don't have to walk with me," he said and felt a bit uncomfortable.
Harry chuckled and pulled him away. They looked at the expensive clothes and Harry took several things that Sam hung into a dressing room for him. Harry tried on different outfits, all of them very classy and very expensive.
"That's how you look after a good night.", he said laughing.
Harry smiled a bit more when he saw the corners of Malfoy's mouth twitching up.
"Sorry," the boy said and after he looked up at Harry's face, he quickly took a step back. "I am so sorry, Harry Potter. I was just so focused on my timetable," he said hastily. Harry didn't answer, what made the boy a bit uncomfortable, he didn't know if he insulted Harry in some way. "I- um..." the boy started his next sentence, but Harry cut him off.
"I love him," Hermione sobbed.
Malfoy looked annoyed. He rolled his eyes, but finally gave in and put his arms into the sleeves of the jacket. Harry was stunned. Malfoy looked- he looked- good? His pale hand holding the cigarette stuck between his pale pink lips, a strand of his silver hair was loose and falling over his eye, and the leather jacket...
Malfoy took another breath and Harry realized that Malfoy's eyes were glistening because they were getting wet. Harry didn't know what to do, he had never seen Malfoy cry - to be honest he'd never even thought Malfoy was able to.
"Talk to me."
Despite the cold, the day was amazing. Harry and Ron have bought a bag of sweets from
Harry took the Floo Network back home, stumbled out of the fireplace in the living room and grinned at Ron. Luna came out of the kitchen with Teddy in her arm. Teddy immediately laughed and his hair turned black when he saw Harry and Luna passed him over.
"I won't hurt him. I love him too much.", he said. Weasley's shoulders relaxed.
"Hermione, we're both alright. Malfoy's mother has plant poisoning and I didn't want to let him visit her on his own."
Neville was just glad he hadn't seen Malfoy during breakfast or lunch or dinner or anytime else. If he would see Malfoy, he would just punch the living hell out of him. Neville knew since the war he sometimes couldn't hold himself back - especially not when someone attacked Harry. No one, really
"Well...", Potter said.
"Yeah, me too.", Ron stood up too.
"Morning." He said in a deep, hoarse voice.
Malfoy furrowed his brow. "Why are you smiling?"
Draco lit a cigarette and nodded. He was really going to do it. He held the cigarette with one hand and bit from his bread with the other hand.
"Or maybe they will like you because of me," Potter said.
"Come on, will you at least tell
Harry leaned back in his chair and tilted his head to look at Dumbledore strolling around in his frame.
"Okay. Does she know?", Ron asked, his hand in the doorknob. Harry furrowed his brow.
"No, but I want to do this. I want to clear the air."
"I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do. His gift is this song, and this one's for you." Angelina and George sang and walked out hand in hand.
Now all of the emotions Harry was feeling inside of him came out as tears, whether he wanted or not. He couldn't stop it.
"Maybe I just want to greet my classmates." Malfoy said sarcastically and Blaise behind him snickered.
"Right."
Then, she pulled out a box from beneath her school supplies. Harry furrowed his brow, but when Hermione opened it, he smiled.
"It's my room too, Malfoy. If you can't get dressed in the bathroom you have to count on me laying here and watching you," Potter answered.
~ Draco"
"What a stupid shop.", he said. Harry nodded.
After a while, they separated from each other and Harry looked at Draco.
"What?", Ron asked outraged, "You talked about him the same!"
"Shit," Harry cursed under his breath and vomited.
"And, how was Slughorn this year?", Pansy asked after a while.
Harry took a shower when he got home and so did Ron. Harry didn't know if he could leave Malfoy alone with Hermione, but he encouraged him to go. Harry stood under the hot water stream and closed his eyes. He loved Christmas. Malfoy and Hermione stopped talking when Harry came into the living room. He furrowed his brow. Why was everyone acting so weird lately? He went back to his room without saying a word and stumbled across Ron, who rubbed his wet hair with a towel.
"Draco?", Harry whispered.
"Alright, alright.", Draco sighed defeated.
What was going on? The two friends stepped aside and behind them was Draco Malfoy.
"Dinner is almost ready." She said and hurried around the kitchen hastily, "He said he would be home by now."
"But you didn't?" He asked. Draco shook his head and Potter smiled. "What did you get?"
Draco also had to admit it was very clever of Potter to go and talk to the minister himself, because the minister owed him a lot more than any other person - he owed Potter his life. Yes, Harry Potter was a little hero. Draco rolled his eyes.
Harry thought of Draco, his shining eyes as Harry told him he loved him and the smile that formed on Draco's lips as he said it back. Harry got goosebumps.
"Mostly he watches me study. It's a bit annoying actually.", Hermione said.
Harry smiled.
"It was asked for you.", the headmistress told him, laying her glasses down on her desk. Draco looked at her.
Hermione's voice was quiet. Harry turned around to look at his two friends who had worried looks on their faces. Of course, they knew Harry too well and they have been through too much together that he could hide something as big as this from them. So he sighed defeated and sat down at the table with them.
"Professor R.J. Lupin." And the same voice from the beginning said:
After they finished eating, Draco knew exactly what was coming. He had to introduce his boyfriend properly. He took a deep breath as they walked into the living room. Potter was standing by Draco's side and smiled uncomfortable at the people Draco knew he had hated for so long.
"Yeah but I mean you said not a date. This doesn't have to be either. Just because we meet it doesn't mean we're on a date." Harry argued even though he didn't really understand why.
Harry was a little taken aback. Mrs Malfoy looked a lot like he remembered her - her blonde hair and her pale skin resembling her son's. But her whole attitude was unrecognizable - she didn't call Harry scum or looked down upon him, she seemed less cold towards him and less haughty, as if being mean was too exhausting. He threw Draco a quick look, but he only shrugged and turned back to his mother.
"That was me.", he said ruefully. Draco didn't answer.
In his lunch break, Draco went back to the common room, where he found a stack of freshly printed Daily Prophets. The headline:
He could feel something. Something he felt before, but never that strong. He opened his eyes and smiled. There was a Patronus. It was...
It must have been something about Teddy, but Malfoy didn't know that. His face changed immediately and he put on the familiar scowl.
Harry watched Ron with a smile. "Sorry, I'm just really nervous."
"Molly, you remember Draco. Malfoy," Harry said and Molly nodded.
"I just want to explain," Harry said and tried to keep his voice steady and quiet.
"Told me she had to look at mother again. Would contact me if anything changed. I told her I'd stay the night."
"Yeah, I don't know," Malfoy said shrugging.
"What is he doing?" Ron asked.
Theo opened his mouth to say something, but closed it again when Draco shot him an annoyed look.
Licking his lips, Draco brushed away a dark strand from the tender spot near Potter's ear and then pressed a small kiss to the skin. He licked it, grazed it with his teeth, and when Potter shivered and moaned quietly, Draco trapped the skin between his lips and sucked on it lightly.
Harry smiled at the scene and Hermione shook Draco's hand as well. As soon as they said goodbye to everyone, Harry and Draco left Kings Cross. The car of uncle Vernon parked on the street and Harry's family stepped outside.
Harry laughed, what made Ron and Hermione look at him in surprise. Then they started to laugh as well.
Harry walked over there. The blankets smelled like honey and cinnamon. Harry wondered where the smell was coming from... from Malfoy obviously not, given the fact that the git smelled like mint and citrus.
"Is this-"
Harry shrugged and took a deep, sharp breath. "Don't know. I just- I don't have very good memories when it comes to being tied up."
"You know, his mother likes me and as much as I know, Parkinson tries to like me as well. So if Lucius should attack me or something, there will be at least three people who will hold him back.", he answered. Ron nodded slowly.
"Good. Now leave me alone," Draco answered and grabbed his pyjama before vanishing back in the bathroom.
"Where are you going?", he asked.
Draco fixed his hair. When he opened the door Potter said, "Remember when I told you you should learn to get dressed in the bathroom or I will see your dick hanging around? Well now you-"
"I just need to borrow a book.", Hermione said, "You can wait here."
"He's here. The guy." Malfoy said and stared somewhere straight ahead.
Harry opened the door and pulled Draco inside. He heard the others jumping up from the sofa and they stormed into the hallway.
"What?", Hermione asked.
Blaise nodded laughing.
"Potter, stop it.", Draco said.
"What? No! I didn't- No!", answered Harry in disbelief.
"Why won't you tell me?" He asked, "Are you afraid?"
Ron looked disappointed, but a third pudding lighted up his face.
"DON'T CALL HIM THAT!", Mr Malfoy shouted and stabbed his fork into the table.
"Harry won twice." Ron answered.
Draco watched Harry with a smile on his lips. Harry stopped and looked at the blond boy and again, his face turned red.
"We invited Malfoy."
Draco read the letter one more time and then rolled it together. He walked out and climbed the stairs to the owlery, where he chose a brown owl and bound the letter to her leg. She flew away. Draco looked after her.
They ordered something to drink and looked at the menu. Harry was glad to see his favourite meal on the card and ordered it right away. Malfoy ordered the same and Narcissa something Harry had never heard of. After Harry had had a long conversation with Mrs Malfoy, he excused himself, stood up and vanished to the toilet.
"Sure. You don't think I'm leaving you alone now.", Harry said and Draco smiled.
"It's just-" Theo said, "Why would you do that?"
"He want's to stay the night, so I don't think you have to wait up." Harry said.
"Dinner is ready. Sit down.", Miss Malfoy said to break the uncomfortable situation.
"Vernon, can I talk to you for a second?", she asked and vanished with the fat man into the kitchen.
"Harsh? I think that's completely-"
"Come on, Malfoy, don't be such a prick for once," Weasley said, "We're trying to be nice here."
Potter started moaning and Draco moved faster. He slapped Potter again, what made him groan even louder. Draco stopped.
"Draco!", Harry whispered, shaking Draco softly.
Draco shut the bathroom door and drowned Pansy's voice. He took off his clothes and stepped into the shower. The water took its time to get warm and Draco used that time to think about earlier.
"We know, Harry. We know, but-", Hermione said.
"Quite good. My mom started freaking out because I wanted to come back here because Pansy talked to her." Blaise told Draco.
"Nice watch." Harry said.
"What are you guys doing here?" George asked with a big smile as he spotted them through the crowd.
Harry nodded and looked around again shortly.
"Right.", he said and nodded slowly, seeming to be thinking of that all.
Malfoy laughed too.
"Malfoy." Harry said, glad Malfoy wasn't running from him. Maybe they could actually work this out.
It had been a one-time event. Everything else was as usual - Harry and Malfoy still didn't talk much outside of their dorm room, Hermione and Ron still didn't know about them, but Neville was still very supportive and kept the secret, although Harry was tired of hiding. He wanted Hermione to stop worrying and stop following Harry. And he wanted Ron and Dean to stop insulting Malfoy. He just wanted his friends to know.
"Come seek us where our voices sound. We can not sing above the ground.", Harry said monotone.
"Do you want to talk about it?" Ron said carefully.
Draco sighed and looked away. This was weird, but this time it wasn't a good kind of weird, it wasn't a happy kind of weird. Potter seemed like he, too, didn't know what to do. He just lay there next to Draco and stared at the ceiling. This wasn't working. Draco didn't know if he should say something - if he should say what he was thinking or if he should just try to make conversation. He didn't have to, because Potter already broke the silence.
"My hands are cold. I'm trying to warm them up.", Potter said, his face the picture of innocence, complete with a blush. He shrugged.
"Wow.", Goyle said.
"How are you these days?", the headmistress asked. Draco tried to smile but McGonnagal was not that easy to be fooled.
"Hedwig.", Harry answered and turned around to look at Malfoy, who stood there, still with a questioning look, one eyebrow raised.
"Ron, if you have a problem with it, tell me.", Harry said annoyed.
Harry could hear the sadness in Hermione's voice when she said that. He nodded and Ron did the same.
But Malfoy didn't come any further, because Harry exploded.
"Looking cheerful today.", he stated as he saw Harry's wide smile.
"What now?" Dean asked shocked and his head snapped towards Ron.
.", he said. Potter laughed.
"Thanks. Can I leave now?", Draco asked. Weasel nodded and Draco hurried off.
"Pansy is coming right out." Hermione said when Malfoy looked through the crowd nervously. "She was right behind me."
"The what?", he asked and Potter laughed slightly.
"What does he write?", Draco asked curiously.
Harry closed his eyes for a second again, then looked back into Draco's eyes.
in watching him- by the way what was that all about, he's not a child- but Harry had thought that maybe he was important enough to Malfoy that he would at least
Potter nodded understating and smiled softly. "Have you ever had sex? Like
Harry sat up, so did Malfoy. He lit up his wand and looked at Harry.
. Stunning." Potter said and put on a charming smile that made Draco's heart flutter and his knees weak.
? Did he just say
Draco turned around to find Potter sitting on the edge of his bed and watching Draco curiously.
Back at home, Harry carried Teddy to the fluffy carpet and his toys and emptied his bag on the living room table. Harry was expecting Ron to come downstairs when he heard footsteps.
"Let's go inside, come on." She said and pulled Harry to his feet.
Now everyone turned their heads to look at Draco and Narcissa.
"I'm sorry, what?" Harry asked.
He normally only talked about this with Hermione, Ron or Sirius, but not with Malfoy. It was kind of strange.
"Well, can I help you with something here, Matt?" Harry asked and looked at the timetable Matt was holding in his hands. His nails weren't bitten like Harry's, but they were smoothly cut.
"You don't want to know." Malfoy said.
Draco laughed, but he was quite shocked that she called herself Potter's "friend".
"Are we eating on the kitchen then?", Harry suggested.
Parkinson narrowed her eyes and grunted. She walked outside again, slamming the door behind herself.
He saw Malfoy's lips stretch into a smile as well and Harry hugged Draco really tight. Harry closed his eyes now as well, but when he felt Draco shifting next to him, he opened them again. Draco whispered "
Ron smiled. "So raise your glasses for Mr and Mr Potter."
"Let's go back to Draco's room and I'll see if they're still arguing.", she said and closed the album.
Harry and Ron brought outside the food they made for Ron and Hermione and Harry fed Teddy while the other two were eating. Harry told then about the hearing and about dinner. He left out the thing that had happened in the bathroom, he was sure they didn't want to know and besides, Malfoy had said no one should every know about this so Harry kept it a secret.
It seemed ridiculous to him to be this devastated by Malfoy's behavior, considering what else he'd been through in his life. Harry was sure that growing up with the Dursleys without parents, or seeing his godfather die before his eyes, or all of the other people he loved being dead, or facing Voldemort, knowing he wanted to kill him had been worse than Malfoy shouting at him. Also, Harry should be used to Malfoy being a total prick but the worst thing was, Harry really thought he had changed. The mixture of emotions inside of him made him feel sick and his head heavy.
Ginny sang with a surprisingly good voice, "I don't have much money, but boy if I did..."
Neville had been worried all day since Ron and Hermione had told him and the others what had happened yesterday with Harry. Neville still couldn't understand what the bloody hell Malfoy had been thinking. And Neville really thought he had been serious about Harry. How could anyone be so gross and mean to someone that loved them this much? Neville knew Harry really loved Malfoy and he couldn't imagine what pain Harry must go through right now. But Ron and Hermione were right to let him go, he had to get away from Malfoy.
"We're here to see Narcissa Malfoy, his mother."
Harry breathed heavily and looked around. The unmistakable smell of the hospital wing filled his nose and this time it was not a dream.
,she sounded immediately worried,
Platform nine and three quarters was already filled with students from Hogwarts. Draco could clearly see the new first years, who were all standing next to their proud parents. There also were the cool middle school kids - the ones from fourth grade who wore sunglasses and bewitched chains around their neck. Draco rolled his eyes. Sunglasses. Ridiculous. There were also many faces Draco recognised from his time at Hogwarts. Beneath them the annoying little Creevey boy, who looked rather grey and didn't talk at all, what was very odd and unusual for him. Draco and Blaise got eye contact and Draco told his mother he was going to go on the train while Blaise made his way through the crowd over to Draco.
"Draco.", Harry said quietly and kissed Draco to shut him up.
"Dudley Dursley! I say it to you a last time!", Potter said and laughed.
"Ron's owl.", Potter answered and opened the letter.
"What?" Blaise asked loudly, "What do you mean you're not going?"
Harry stood up as well and grabbed Draco's shoulders. Draco avoided Harry's eyes and looked at the floor. Ron cleared his throat.
"Of course! The pub!" Malfoy said "Pansy wanted me to go there so badly, no idea why, but well, she said it would be fun."
"Yeah well how could I if I have to figure out what you're thinking all the time because you never show any emotion?" Harry snapped.
you want this?" Potter asked.
"None of your business." Draco answered once again.
"We ate going to he so wasted tomorrow." Draco laughed.
But before anything else could be said from any of them, the first girl pulled out her wand and pointed it at Draco's chest.
"Who is the worst-dressed Hogwarts teacher?"
He felt somehow strong after he'd said that, because it was the first time he stood up against his father and didn't do what he wanted.
"You like me too," Draco said.
"Damn, Potter. Can't you even tie this?" Malfoy said annoyed and pointed at Harry's tie.
Harry stood there for one minute and twenty-three seconds and stared at the door. He knew it was that long, because he heard the ticking of his watch. He felt his eyes filling with water.
"Hey.", he said.
"What do you think you are doing?", Snape asked, his black hair falling in his face.
Harry shrugged. "If it's okay with you I'd apparate back to my house and bring you some dry clothes."
Harry smiled thankfully and made his way to the bar as well.
"Stood up too late, sorry.", Harry answered.
"I am. You remember Draco Malfoy, don't you?" Harry grinned at her disbelieving expression, "And I'm sure if
." Hermione said "
Harry smiled. He started singing amd Draco held his arm towards Harry. He had goosebumps. Harry laughed. They went into dancing position and started dancing slowly while Harry was singing "Love me tender".
Harry couldn't hold back a laugh as he put on his trousers, that lay three feet away from him. Malfoy looked like he wanted to vanish into thin air right at that moment. They both didn't feel like eating breakfast right now, so after checking with Ron, they went to bed. Harry opened the window in his room to let in some cold, fresh air. They cuddled up next to each other and pulled the blanket up to their chins. Harry breathed in the crisp air and smiled. He was sort of glad he could experience
"Well good morning." Ron said cheerfully as he spotted Harry.
Harry was woken by someone shaking his shoulder and whispering his name. He slowly opened his eyes and the healer from before came into focus. Harry immediately sat up and straightened his glasses.
"The bar keeper? How the fuck do you want to get his number?" Malfoy asked.
"Quiet. I'm taking off your trousers." Harry said and opened Malfoy's belt.
Draco sighed and let himself fall in his bed. He groaned loudly into his pillow and pulled it against his face. He hated this year!
Harry had completely forgotten about the Tournament, even though he hadn't already figured that damn egg out. Wordless, Harry nodded.
Ron didn't answer. Hermione came inside and when she saw Ron, she froze for a second.
"I mean, I never even thought about this." Draco said.
Harry nodded.
Malfoy nodded slowly and Harry was wondering if he had decided to overhear Harry's embarrassing failure or if he hadn't even heard.
"He wasn't a murderer. You need to know, my parents were good friends with him, so they made him my godfather. And then there was Peter Pettigrew. I think you know him."
Draco grinned. Harry was one slimy git. But it worked. Draco saw his mother blushing slightly and the corner of her lips twitched.
Ron didn't wait for anyone to say something, he just stormed out of the library. Hermione jumped from her chair and followed him. Harry and Neville glanced at the left-behind boy. He seemed appropriately scared as Harry and his friend stepped closer to the table he sat at.
"How can you love that? It's disgusting!" Malfoy pulled a face and Harry had to laugh.
?", she asked.
Harry grinned. "Yes you may, Mr Potter."
Draco nodded and led Harry inside. Harry looked around and found that nothing had changed since the last time he had been here. The hallway was as dimly lit as it had been, and there were the same pale-faced portraits that eyed him suspiciously. Harry followed Draco to a door and as it was opened, Harry froze. Malfoy turned around to look at him and immediately realized what was wrong: It was the room that Hermione had been tortured in by Bellatrix Lestrange. Harry could see the stairs to the dungeon where they had been held.
Harry slid down under the covers and tried not to do anything too stupid. Draco's knee bumped into Harry's, cold and a bit bony, and Harry made a hiccuping kind of noise of surprise, and then they both laughed, together this time, and when they stopped, there was a kind of expectant silence.
Harry watched him take out black underwear, black trousers and a black muscle shirt.
"I'm sorry I ruined your birthday.", Draco said and Harry could hear the regret in his voice.
"Dear child, the original book is in the office of the headmistress." The woman told Hermione and her eyes immediately lit up.
Malfoy's eyes widened and Harry hoped he wasn't going to get the wrong idea. Suddenly Harry's heart started pounding hardly and he felt himself sweating even though the night was cold.
Harry laughed,
"We can't fly." Harry said.
"I didn't think you would come.", Malfoy said quietly.
He made no remark about Dobby's clothing or anything, the two of them just sat down and had a peaceful breakfast.
Harry threw the map to his bed frustrated amd groaned. Where the hell was this idiot?
Miss Williams chuckled and wished Harry a good day. He smiled and continued shopping, checking everything from Hermione's list first and then started his own. He crossed paths with a few more people he knew fleetingly, exchanged nods and smiled and held small-talk with some of them.
"And I don't know how to feel about it. I mean you're..."
Draco raised an eyebrow. "Bullshit."
Before the feast began, Headmistress McGonagall got up to say a few words, as unusual to Ron's disappointment because he was starving.
The next few days left far too slow for Draco's liking. Every second took way longer than normally and especially every second he was around stupid Potter. At the end of the week, Draco finally got to talk to Blaise again. They sat in the Great Hall and had lunch.
Malfoy only shook his head again. He kept his gaze on his shaking hands in his lap and Harry could see that he bit his lip. Harry would've bet that Malfoy had looked like this all sixth year but he had just hidden it very well.
Draco looked at him. Of course he couldn't break off a sentence and then expect Potter not wanting to find out what he was going to say. Draco sighed.
, I'm not your
Hermione rolled her eyes.
Draco was incredible, and when he started to thrust into Harry's hand, saying,
"Can you understand now why I didn't want to move in with Theo?"
"It would be against my father's education." Malfoy told Harry.
"Hi Neville," Harry answered and tried to smile as well.
"What are you doing, Draco?"
Ron rolled his eyes. "Shut up Malfoy."
Malfoy slowly turned his head around.
"I have an appointment with Madame Pomfrey."
The two found the book they were searching for and Luna also took one.
Now he was still pale, but almost back to his normal pale. And his hair was much shinier, almost like Harry remembered it from third year. And he didn't look as thin as he did a few months ago. Harry didn't know for sure, but he thought he even might have seen a few muscles on Malfoy's arms. Generally speaking Malfoy wasn't ugly and he
"If you are happy with it, I won't ask questions.", she said.
Hermione came around a shelf and looked at Ron furiously. "What are you doing?"
"I want to get to know the real Draco Malfoy. Something you don't tell anyone else."
"So, how are your roommates?" Harry asked when they walked up the stairs in the new tower.
good at playing this game. Harry lost the first round, but he said it was only because he had to get used to Malfoy's tactics. Malfoy shook his head.
Ginny sat behind Hermione and listened carefully, not looking up from her book.
"Oh, he is!" Malfoy chuckled.
He knew Kreacher was just going to snap his fingers and everything was magically going to clean itself, but Harry just liked the old-fashioned Muggle ways. But sometimes a little magic in the household didn't hurt. For example making Harry's bed. Harry hated making his bed, it was so unnecessary. So Harry grabbed his wand, flicked it and watched the blanket lift and fold itself and fall down again neatly, the pillow squishing itself. Harry nodded satisfied and went back into the bathroom, where he cleaned toilet and sink, also with the help of magic.
"Shut up, it's comfortable," Malfoy said and tucked at his dark green sweater.
"I'm not!" Potter said annoyed.
"Not very good at small talk," Potter finished his sentence and smiled. Draco nodded.
He turned around sharply, what made her flinch. Draco looked at her with a death glare.
"Malfoy!" Someone shouted from the hall to the boy's dormitories. "Malfoy!" Draco recognized the voice to be Longbottom's.
Malfoy didn't respond.
"Lupin.", Harry answered shortly and looked back at the table.
"Good morning Draco." Mrs Malfoy nodded towards Harry, "Potter."
Granger stuck her head inside the room. "Can I come in?" She asked and Draco nodded while rolling his eyes. She closed the door behind herself and smiled sadly when she saw Draco sitting all alone on his bed, wand in his hand and crumbs of potato in his lap.
"Classes."
"Yes. Yessss!" it felt almost as good as when Draco had touched Harry. Harry breathed heavily and Draco's cock jerked powerfully in Harry's hand, spunk spattering on his fist and even up onto Harry's stomach where the pyjama top was pulled askew.
Cradling Teddy in his arms, Harry made his way back downstairs into the living room, where his friends sat. They asked Harry about what had happened in hushed whispers and Harry told them.
He had no intention of leaving. He had a right to be here just as the two others had. Granger stood up and let go of Potter's hand.
"I have her number, we can call her." Harry said and closed the chat with Hermione again.
"She'll check me on jinxes and poisoning and stuff like that.", Potter explained. Draco nodded.
"Harry?", he asked with big eyes. A smile hushed over the professor's lips.
"Why are you smiling, idiot?" Malfoy asked, quietly so Hermione and Ron wouldn't hear but loud enough to be almost loud.
"Do you have classes to teach now?" Harry asked because he didn't want to disturb her during something.
Harry refocused and looked down. Suddenly Harry started laughing. He was standing in a puddle of lemonade and even though Malfoy had stepped back, his socks were wet.
Draco stared at the floor. "No," he said quietly.
"No."
"You can listen to music with it.", Harry explained and turned tge radio on.
He looked at Neville, Luna and Ginny who were all pretending that didn't hear anything of their conversation.
"Oh, yes. Good idea to use the war and you being the glorious hero as an excuse for what you had just said. Brilliant, Harry. Truly brilliant.", she said, her eyes still narrowed.
"Why I-? Are you kidding me?" He took a step closer to Draco and leaned down to him.
In the kitchens, he sunk down on the chair and lay his head in his hands. He sniffed, but tried to prevent his already wet eyes from crying.
"Draco." Harry said quietly.
"Can I talk to you?" He said.
Draco moaned loudly and came into Potter's mouth. Potter sucked and licked until Draco whimpered from the stimulation on his over-sensitive cock.
"No, Hermione. How bad can it be?", Harry asked, shaking his head. Hermione nodded.
At night, he couldn't get the question out of his head. Why wasn't Draco Malfoy in Azkaban? He had been a Death Eater, Harry had seen his mark. Maybe because he had still been underage? Who knew.
"And I will kill everyone who thinks otherwise and who tried to steal you from me."
"Now, I want to see him again, so, if you may excuse me.", Harry said.
"Why aren't you exhausted?", Harry asked, thrusting the pillow back at Draco.
Draco dropped his bag and spun around.
"What are you talking about?", Ron asked and jumped next to Harry.
"Are you okay?", he asked unsure, "Did I do something wrong?"
"Mom!" He said, "Go."
"I sure am. They follow my orders, I know that. They have no enforceability.", he said and took a deep breath.
"True."
"Yes, you are, Draco.", Harry laughed and kissed the blond boy on his lips.
Then, Draco looked at Granger and Weasel, who looked at them with shocked looks.
"Maybe I just need more sex." Ron joked and smiled sadly.
?" What about "
"I don't know, you must have told McGonnagal something, I don't know! Everything is your fault!" Draco said loudly.
"Not weird." Harry shook his head, "Not easy."
"What do you want here?", a boy from second year asked.
Draco sighed and stuffed the letter into his bedside table to all the other letters he got drom his mom and his friends.
"I really expected more." Harry said with a disappointed face.
"Shh, Teddy. It's all right." Harry whispered as he took the baby out of the crib and walked back to his bed, "It's only thunder."
"Why do you have to be such a prick all the time?" Harry asked.
"Maybe I do want to come over there." There was a pause, then Malfoy said, a little breathlessly:
Draco sat down on his bed and began to read. After a while, he heard laughing outside the door and not one second later the door opened and Potter came in, followed by his stupid friends Weasel, Granger, Loony Lovegood, the fool Longbottom, Dean Thomas and Finnegan. Draco rolled his eyes annoyed and looked back dosn at his book.
When Ron knocked and asked if they were ready, Harry and Draco sat up quickly.
They were leaving the bookstore again and were ready to go back home and have a nice cold shower. The weather was cooling down a little, but it was still hotter than Harry would have liked it to be.
"Please, Malfoy. Let me explain," Harry said and hoped Malfoy would just turn around to look at him.
Harry's eyes shot through the whole Hall to Malfoy, who looked very angry and confused. Harry looked at Ron and Hermione.
fault?" Potter asked angrily and the two of them stormed at each other.
were really stupid. I missed our little fights or seeing you in the hall or watching you eat."
?", he repeated, "Really? When was the last time you held your breath under water for an hour?"
"I'll go get a caramel apple." Malfoy said as he spotted a hut selling diverse forms of apples.
Now, Harry could see, his uncle was scared himself.
Professor McGonnagal stood up from the chair Dumbledore used to sit on, and walked up the the podium Dumbledore used to speak on. Harry missed him. She held her speech, the Sorting began and ended and the second Sorting began.
Harry stayed by Malfoy's side until Zabini and Nott came back with a bag full of clothes and a toothbrush. Harry rolled his eyes when he came across several products for Draco's hair and the two other boys shrugged grinning.
"He's my son! He's my son!", he repeated ruefully and hammered against the wall. Harry cleared his throat and the man stopped moving.
"Potty, I think I'll go to our room and take a shower, alright?", he asked. Potter nodded smiling.
Potter's question disappointed Draco's expectations. Out of all the things they could talk about, his well-being might have been Draco's least favourite. He shrugged, hoping Potter wouldn't ask again.
Harry kissed Draco a third time.
"Nope.", Draco answered.
Just when Draco and Potter put on their pants, Granger knocked once again.
"I need an owl." Harry said.
Draco flinched as he first saw the long table in the giant dining room. When he had visited his mother before, they had always decided to sit in the living room, avoiding the dining room, but today Narcissa wanted it to be formal because they had guests.
"I'm sorry, Madame, but was does
"Malfoy!" Harry shouted, but it didn't make Malfoy stop, it only attracted people's attention to Harry. But Harry didn't care. He needed to talk to Malfoy, there was nothing more important right now. "Malfoy, wait!" Harry shouted once again when he stormed after Malfoy, out of the castle and over the grounds to the eighth year tower.
"Yeah. You'd call it like that.", he said. Ron laughed too.
Harry nodded and cleared his throat. "I am."
"Potter.", Draco said, "I don't care what you sound like, at least you tell me. Or are you afraid of the answer."
Harry breathed out.
Neville nodded. "Well that makes sense," he said, "But what's with this person?"
In two days, he and Potter would go to Malfoy Manor and after one year, Draco could finally see his friends and family again. But first, they had to stop at Potter's home and pack some clothes.
"The war is over, won by Harry Potter, lost by Voldemort." was the first sentence of this article. Draco thought it was such a development that now the Dark Lord's name is even standing in the newspaper. Voldemort. Draco kept reading.
Harry moaned himself and let go of Draco's skin. A dark spot made itself visible and Harry smiled satisfied.
Dumbledore chuckled amused. "You have a point."
"I can't believe this is what Muggles do for entertainment." Draco said.
"Well then maybe you should fucking open your eyes! What do you have glasses for?"
Longbottom checked the clock in the common room and nodded. "At this time it would be very unusual for them to not be having breakfast."
Harry didn't know who they were talking about, but he couldn't focus on that. What did these two take that made them this friendly to each other? Harry would have thought they would have killed each other by now.
With the blonde git on his mind, Harry fell asleep around 2 am.
"You are the man of my dreams!", Harry whispered and kissed Draco. Draco smiled and rubbed his nose against Harry's.
Ron grinned at him with big eyes, but Hermione wore a dismissive look and shook her head.
"What?", Draco asked surprised and looked at Harry.
Harry sat at his desk in the evening, chewing on his quill while being deeply in thoughts. He looked at Malfoy's owl and tried to figure out what he should write - if he should say yes or no. Harry had already written Malfoy's name, but that was barely anything he could send.
"Potter?", he asked carefully. Potter didn't answer, even though Draco knew he was awake too.
The girls groaned annoyed and left. Harry looked at Ginny gratefully and she smiled. This was the moment Harry decided that he would definitely invite her to his birthday.
"If you want to, that is.", Draco added carelessly.
"No. Get away from the door now. And Ron, you should know better than that."
"Where are the other two sleeping?" Malfoy asked as Harry levitated the dirty dishes into the dishwasher.
"What?", Draco asked.
What was Theo's problem? A truce wasn't a big deal, it's not like they were friends now. But maybe this was the first step to a friendship? Not if Draco could prevent it.
"Uh... thanks Potter," the Professor said a bit startled.
Teddy turned around to look at Harry and Harry smiled. This innocent little child sat in his lap and was as playful as ever, a big grin on his face that he was finally with his godfather again. Harry knew what that felt like and he would do anything to keep that feeling alive for Teddy. The healer came back out side and Hary got up quickly, Teddy in his arm.
wanted to know how he felt. That was something Harry had to get used to.
"Oh my
Draco opened his eyes and looked up at Harry.
He held his chest because laughing still hurt, but he didn't stop.
"Do you- do you have a pullover or something too?"
Harry grinned. Seamus and Sam turned around to look at him as well. Seamus whistled loudly and Harry laughed. He found it. Malfoy would be so blown away.
"Since last Tuesday," she answered and bit her lip.
Potter whipped the drool of his cheek and Draco's chest and opened his eyes slowly.
"What?", Malfoy snapped and stopped. Harry stopped as well and his brain went completely blank.
"Thanks.", he said.
Of course, he could understand that Malfoy wasn't comfortable with being around Harry's friends, especially when they
"What do you want here?", he asked confused. Draco smiled even wider. Potter hadn't thought he would come this late.
After their third small fight, Harry stood up and went to the library. Luna followed him.
"If it's alright then I would stay for a while." Malfoy finally said.
Harry pinched the bridge of his nose. They couldn't ask something like that!
"I have never seen a picture of your father.", Draco said quietly.
After Harry had drunken his hot chocolate and had thanked the house elves, he went to the library.
"It was." Harry agreed, "But don't you ever drag me into something like that again."
"Then look me in the eyes and tell me that you don't want this. And I'll leave you alone and everything will be as it was."
"Potter!", he said, his voice shaking. Potter grinned evil.
"Have you seen him?"
"That's good.", he said and looked at Harry.
"Potter." Malfoy started and Harry would have fished for him to not say anything at all or he would start to cry. "When I was at the hospital, the only ones I wanted there were you and Teddy. I realized I don't want to have that feeling ever again."
"How was your day, Malfoy?", he asked and hoped that Malfoy would use legilimens again to talk to him, but he didn't.
Draco turned around to see Potter sitting on bis bed and rubbing his eyes sleepily.
Harry's whole body relaxed and he melted into the kiss. Malfoy tasted more like mint than smoke, what was odd but at the same time really good. Harry smiled with his lips still against Malfoy's. This kiss wasn't like the first one. This kiss was slow and calm. And short. Malfoy pulled away and Harry immediately was shocked. Malfoy had tears in his eyes!
"You are allowed to smile at me, you know that, don't you?" Harry said.
"Mother, could we just go and eat?", he asked and she nodded wordlessly.
With that, he turned around and left the kitchen. Sneaking back into the dorm was even harder than out. Draco supposed everyone was either at lunch or in the library or playing in the snow. Outside, he heard some people laugh and shout in the distance, but he wasn't concerned about them. Safely back in his room, Draco opened one of the two bottles and started drinking right out of it. The burning feeling in his throat made Draco forget about Dobby.
Draco saw Theo swallowing thickly and he nodded. Draco nodded back and went back inside. As soon as he closed the door of his room behind himself, he breathed out heavily.
Harry laughed.
"What are you thinking about?"
The ministry was nothing like Draco had remembered it. There once was a statue of the Muggles, let's say... where they belong, now, at the same place, was a statue with people holding hands and standing in a circle. Every second person was wearing wizards robes, the others were wearing casual Muggle clothing. Draco got goosebumps when he saw this, and not because he thought it was good. He looked at his mother, who was also glancing at the new statue.
They gathered around the table, Harry sitting next to Teddy's high chair. Harry fed Teddy mashed carrots and simultaneously ate something himself. The atmosphere was less tense than Harry had expected but he knew that not everything was fine. Draco must have felt this as well, because he opened his mouth to say something.
After a while, Harry started to get cold.
"You're not allowed to get up for breakfast, so we thought we'd bring breakfast to you," Ron said.
"After the school year.", Draco continued,
Malfoy looked from Harry to his friends, then back to Harry with a meaningful look.
Now Malfoy got up too. "No I don't!"
your cousin?", Draco asked laughing.
"Half an hour before you did."
"Better than my cousin.", he said and stepped closer to Draco.
After Luna had left, Neville sat down on his bed. Harry refused to sit there and sat on the chair. Neville asked what Harry wanted to talk about, so Harry started telling him about Ron and Hermione in the Three Broomsticks and when Malfoy had stormed in.
Every newspaper contained at least one article about Harry Potter and Draco read them all for maybe the thousandth time. He started to collect these newspapers with his mother when he was a little boy and a big fan of Potter's, but even though he had learned to hate Potter over the years, Draco kept every newspaper that contained an article about him. "
"It's time?" He asked, looking through the pictures.
Harry kept his eyes on Malfoy, whose body only moved to his breathing. And then Malfoy turned his head to look Harry in the eyes.
Potter mumbled something sleepy and grabbed Draco's hand.
Harry furrowed his brow and smiled slightly.
Draco rolled his eyes. This boy was impossible. He just fell asleep in his uniform, but Potter looked so cute, what made Draco's heart jump a little. Draco stood up from his own bed and stripped down to his boxers, hoping Potter was really asleep. Draco couldn't bear letting Potter sleep in his school uniform and wrinkling it. And because Draco didn't want Potter to wake up, he took out his wand, flicked it and started stripping Potter down, too. When he reached boxers and undershirt, Draco stopped. With another flick of his wand, he folded the clothes and put them on Potter's chair.
"Nothing.", Draco said. He changed his mind the second he thought about talking to
." Harry could hear Pansy grinning even through the phone "
Harry sighed again and shuffled towards the sofa, where he squeezed in next to Luna, Neville and Ron. The others continued their talk, and since Harry didn't know what it was about, he just sat there and stared into the fire.
"You can't do anything against it." Draco said and sounded more calming than he actually wanted.
And... positive! Potter's cheeks reddened and he couldn't possibly hide his wide smile. Goodness, he was cute.
The year was over, the Tournament was over, Cedric was... And Voldemort was back. When the Hogwarts express arrived at platform 9 3/4, Harry and Draco took their trunks, Harry took Hedwig's cage and they left the train.
"I'm sorry.", Harry said and Draco glared at him.
It was awesome. Draco was right here and he smelled so good and Harry breathed fast. Draco shifted his legs against Harry’s again, and Harry felt sweat break out on his top lip. Draco laughed shakingly.
"What's-"
Harry got up nervously. Ron and Hermione left him alone in the room - alone with his thoughts and nervousness. They were going to join the others in the Great Hall while Harry would wait for his signal. As he sat on the sofa and played with his tie, he imagined Ron and Hermione jogging into the Great Hall, smiling at Malfoy and giving a signal to the band. Suddenly, music played and Harry opened the door. Hagrid stood on the other side of it and was just about to knock. Harry grinned.
"Remember the Yule Ball?" Malfoy asked and sipped at his drink.
After that, the hours strolled past them like nothing. Malfoy didn't say a single word when his mother didn't talk to him directly. And he just pretended he hadn't heard Harry talking to him even though Harry could see in his eyes he had heard Harry very clearly. After they had finished dessert and after Narcissa had paid, they stood up and left the restaurant. It was already dark outside.
"He's my son!", he said loudly to himself.
"I'm not an asshole, you're just an obsessive freak I can't stand!" Malfoy shouted back.
"What was that?" He asked.
Harry looked back at the crowd. Mrs Malfoy sat on the opposite side of the aisle in the first row, occasionally glancing at the Weasleys. She wore a beautiful, long and glittering black robe, her lips were painted blood-red and her blonde hair fell in waves over her shoulders. She resembled her son very much with her sharp cheekbones and the pale tone of her skin. Harry was surprised to see Pansy smiling at him and smiled back nervously. He almost missed the next thing Professor McGonagall said.
After a long time, Draco breathed out exhausted and looked at Potter to find him quickly looking back down at his book and blushing. Draco smiled.
"Not really. I thought I'd just do something in the garden." Hermione said and Harry nodded understanding.
"We were just about to leave the Entrance Hall, when Professor Moody stopped us and said that McGonnagal wanted to see Draco. We haven't seen him since then.", Blaise told Harry.
Theo froze and looked up at Draco. "What?" He asked, "When?"
So Blaise was leaning over the bar snogging the bartender with the big breasts. Theo switched back and forth between three tipsy girls. And Pansy was off somewhere maybe with Granger or maybe with someone else - Draco didn't know.
"Potter.", Lucius nodded curly and have Potter his hand.
"Harry, he's tricking you, don't you see it? He's evil.", she said.
The touch of Potter's lips was firm and warm, their pressure light but undeniably there. A tentative brush of tongue was followed by Draco's lips moving against Potter's and Draco lost his ability to breathe.
On the first picture was a woman with red hair, a man with black hair, that looked surprisingly much like Draco's boyfriend's and he wore round glasses. The man held a little boy in her arms. The boy had black hair and smiled brightly into the camera. The woman kissed his hand and smiled, just as the man did. They looked like the perfect family.
He felt, he couldn't deny to tell her the truth anymore.
Harry shook his head and took it. He and Draco read the article together.
"I know, Ron, but I have not the slightest idea where Hermione is.", Harry answered, a bit annoyed by Ron's constant bickering.
"I'm sorry. I'm such a loser.", Malfoy said and sniffed.
Pansy offered Draco a plate which he gratefully took and filled with food and he started eating, just now realizing how hungry he'd been. He knew Pansy and Theo were watching him, but Draco decided to ignore them. He wasn't in the mood talking. Of course Pansy didn't know that - how could she?
"But if he's with Moody, he must be good.", Ron said and smiled encouragingly.
Malfoy was almost acceptable when he wasn't talking.
"How do you break a kitchen table?", he asked confused.
Later that day, he went back to the hospital wing. He stopped dead as he walked around the curtains and saw Granger sitting on Potter's bed, holding his hand, which Draco knew was cold, and Weasel sitting
"Right. Sorry... I mean-"
He cried out of anger with himself that he brought himself into this position.
It was not completely true, because Harry's body felt like it was falling apart and he missed Draco and he had no idea what day they had.
"It's my birthday in two days actually." Harry said and was suddenly surprised it never came up.
. From the minute they had entered the pub to the minute Potter let Draco take off with his leather jacket. Draco sighed. He couldn't quite wrap his head around what had happened in the diner and why. Why had Potter been so nice? Why hadn't Draco stormed off? He guessed it was the slight intoxication of both of them. And to be honest, Draco was too tired to figure it out.
"Move, sweetie!", Draco shouted from outside.
"Bye. We'll see us.", Potter said and hugged them both again smiling.
Harry and Hermione put their snacks into the kitchen where Mrs Weasley's stew was already cooking on the stove. When they came back, the room silenced immediately. Harry excused himself and went to the toilet. Before he could stop it, hot tears streamed down his face. Not because he was sad, but because he was frustrated. It made him so mad that he didn't have a clue what was going on with everyone. Harry slapped himself on the cheek, quickly washed his face and went back out.
Draco's eyes widened.
"You like it?"
Malfoy nodded enthusiastically and filled his mouth again. Harry felt pride and happiness filling himself up. He suspected it wasn't easy to please Malfoy because of all the high expectations he had and all the great things he as a part of the Malfoy-family was used to.
Draco absolutely had no idea why he liked being with the git now, but it was still better than being alone.
"Ew, Malfoy!", Ron said and imitated vomiting.
"How come you are so nice to me? I'm sure you know who I am," Draco asked.
Ron nodded slowly and Harry knew he was considering this as a possible option.
"Isn't he all of ours?" Ron laughed as well and ate his cereal.
dick and squeezed it a bit. Hearing Potter moan turned Draco on so much he just had to lick the tip. He couldn't help himself. All of a sudden an invisible force pulled his mouth down and he almost choked on Potter's equipment. Potter chuckled a bit.
"Sorry because of your friends.", Harry said.
Harry turned around and found Luna standing behind him. "Oh, hi Luna," he smiled.
Malfoy scoffed. "Get out of my way."
Potter had been with his stupid friends today and Draco had been alone... again. But in the evening, he was with Potter again, what made him feel somehow comfortable.
"Oh don't be like this Draco." Blaise said and rolled his eyes.
Harry nodded understanding. He never thought of it like that, but he finally realized how hard it really must be for Malfoy to accept all the things he had done wrong.
..." Dean started laughing, "Have you seen his arms?"
"We have to collect little pieces so we can add them all together and have a clear picture of the night before because this-", Harry pointed at the dark bruise on his neck, "-and this-", he held up Malfoy's pale wrist, "-don't come from nothing."
"Good. Nor do I. Now shut up.", Draco answered. Harry slapped himself. Harry lay there, stunned.
"Can I show you something?"
"You two are impossible.", he said.
"Good morning, Mr Weasley." Harry said smiling.
"Turn the page.", Potter replied.
"Do you have everything?" He asked Draco, who nodded, again, wordlessly.
, I'm telling you!" said Ron outraged, "He can't talk to you like that! As if he hasn't done enough already, gaining your trust and then treating you like that..."
Draco grabbed his mother's hand and even though he felt ridiculous, like a four year old, he held her very tight. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Potter looking at him and tried to ignore him, but Potter's eyes sucked at Draco's and like magnets the found their way to each other. Draco only heard half of the things the minister said, until he spoke the sentence:
?", Vernon asked.
Harry sighed and nodded. Was this necessary right now? They were here to see Malfoy's sick mother and not to be asked for autographs or pictures. The hospital was supposed to be a professional place.
"I am so sorry," Harry said, "I didn't think. This bloke, Matt, I came across him when I left McGonnagal's office and he was lost. So, being the friendly person I am, I asked him if I could help him. And he was really freaked out about appearing too late to his first lesson. So I offered to talk to Slughorn, given the history I share with him. And because Matt was really nervous, I just held out my hand and wanted to lead the way. But Malfoy, you have to believe me, I didn't mean
"That's not the point now! What do you think you were doing? That's why I haven't seen your dreams lately! What's wrong?"
"What the hell, Malfoy?" Potter said outraged.
Harry shrugged. "Didn't know how much I'd need."
"Harry, please don't say you want to look for Malfoy." Hermione said with a worried look.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. "No, I don't and i don't think I want any."
"What are you talking about, father?", he asked.
"Oh, yes, of course.", Hermione said and put Ron's hand away from her shoulder.
As soon as Draco got out of the shower, he noticed he forgot to take clothes with him. He looked around and desperately searched for a towel.
"It was.", Harry agreed nodding.
His throat became dry and he didn't get a word out. Harry kept smiling, what made it even harder for Draco to concentrate. Harry took to cups and a pen. He wrote something on it, just as they always did in this coffee shop. Normally, Draco and Scorpius got cups with "Biggest HP fan" or just Harry's signature and a smiley written on it. Harry smiled again and filled both cups with hot chocolate.
To Draco's - or Pansy's - luck Theo cleared his throat and slightly shook his head at Pansy. She understood and dropped it. Draco would never tell anyone about this. Never. Anyone.
Suddenly Draco heard a familiar voice and turned his head to the entrance. Granger walked in, 3 books in her arm and a boy at her side. But it wasn't Weasley. Draco furrowed his brow. Of course, this was none of his business but still, he was very interested in telling Weasley about this and creating a little drama. So Draco held his book up to his nose and glanced over the rim, watching the two sit down at a table close to his.
"Your hair is a project for another day," Malfoy said and Harry laughed. They grabbed their bags and walked outside.
"Ready?" Dean asked. Everyone was ready, so they went downstairs to the Great Hall. Breakfast was already in full swing when they walked in.
"What's wrong?", Harry asked and was afraid that he actually got pranked. But not even Malfoy was that mean.
"Hey Luna. Neville.", he looked at Neville, who sat next to Luna with a wide grin on his face.
"Either my clothes or wet ones."
On the morning the last day before Hogwarts, Draco was visited by Pansy, who, like every other friend of Draco's, didn't attend Hogwarts for her eighth year. Her reason was, she had had enough trouble there and had spent too much time there and she had enough of the mudbloods.
"Don't just stand there!" Draco shouted, "Get someone!"
"You must have something else to do. But thanks.", she said.
Draco took the opportunity and answered in a deep voice, "Don't let him ruin your school year."
Draco took the last step then, and tipped his head so their lips met softly, lightly. Harry then suddenly pushed Draco against the mattress and closed the distance between them quickly, hungrily now, as they both felt that need swell in their chests, a void begging to be filled.
"Well, you know, there's this one person who I kind of like," Harry started and Neville listened interested.
"And in this case the pesticide is our love.", Potter smiled and kissed Draco again.
Draco felt ridiculous - standing shoeless on the street with his broom in his hand, running from the person he'd just kissed.
"Try it out.", Harry answered.
Harry sat down on the chair he had pulled next to the bed and turned Teddy around so he can look at Draco. Teddy grinned and Draco grinned back, what made Harry feel involuntarily happy. There was something even more special about Malfoy getting along with baby Teddy than Malfoy getting along with Harry himself.
"Potter. I'm Draco. Draco Malfoy. You
"What happened?" Hermione asked, laying her hand on Harry's back.
. Oh Merlin.
"Left the party around midnight I guess." Theo said.
Draco remembered the Dark Lord sitting where Lucius had used to sit - at the far end of the table - his snake always so close by his side. Now the chair was empty. Narcissa sat down next to it where she usually sat, by Lucius's side. Pansy sat down next to her and Theo grabbed the chair opposite of Pansy. Draco stood there, thinking for a second, and then sat down next to Theo on his usual chair next to where his father would have sat.
"You're smiling." She said, "Tell me."
Harry raised his eyebrows. Nott had left with three girls at once and Malfoy didn't even want to make out with one that threw herself at him? Curious. He looked at Malfoy and saw that he wanted to say something, but held himself back. So Harry smiled and tried to encourage him.
Fully dressed, they walked downstairs, where Petunia, Vernon and Dudley were sitting at the kitchen table.
"Uhm..." Draco said, "What about your friends?"
"Well then..." he said, "I better get back."
"Harry this is not what I meant," Hermione said when they had entered the common room.
Oh it was so
"Well, that is cotton candy.", Harry smiled.
"Well, get going then.", he said. Draco nodded and ran back upstairs to dress.
Harry shook his head laughing. The crowd in the stands made a great deal of noise. Draco didn't let go of Harry, even though Harry was quite sure, Draco could swim, but he didn't want Draco to let go. Harry liked to have Draco that close to him. They swam back towards the bank where the judges stood watching.
Draco took a deep breath and thought about what he was going to say.
"Harry, your speech was beautiful." Neville said smiling, "I'm very happy you're able to be here."
Much later, Hermione was shocked when she checked her watch and realised they have go to class before their professors got angry. So Harry's friends said goodbye to the two boys. Harry looked at Malfoy.
Malfoy nodded again wordlessly. Harry gave up on the conversation and looked around. His friends were all having fun and Harry had to smile. Until his eyes fell on Katie Bell, who stood frozen in the middle of the crowd and stared at Harry and Malfoy. Harry nudged Malfoy in the side.
"I don't know!" Harry was now almost shouting, "I like him!"
"Mister Draco?", Dobby asked and Draco waved his hand shyly.
"I will.", Hermione assured Harry and smiled.
"What did you say?" Theo asked, obviously amused by the story.
"Nothing.", he said quickly.
"What?", he asked.
Harry nodded and followed Malfoy to the bar. On their way they were stopped by a lot of people that wanted to tell Harry how great the dance was, but Harry didn't care. These were his friends, they were supposed to come up to him as often as they wished. Harry and Malfoy sat down on the bar-stools as the bartender shoved their drinks towards them. Malfoy had ordered another whiskey, but Harry stuck with beer.
"Harry." Ginny pushed herself through the crowd, a man behind her.
"Bloody hilarious." Ron laughed and everyone laughed with him.
"Harry?" Granger asked thought he door.
"I won't.", Draco assured him and kissed him once more.
"Keep it. When you're flying it gets even colder."
"Last year. He got stabbed by Bellatrix Lestrange," the grey elve said.
He hated these people. Vernon laughed.
He picked up a paper, not in an envelope, and gave it to Neville. He and Ron slid closer together and read the letter.
"I know, Harry, and I really wanted to come, but the work on my desk is piling and I really don't want to fail my exams.", she answered.
"It is!", Harry cut her off excitedly and Hermione rolled her eyes.
Harry looked around. He knew most of the people in this room for they have been at Hogwarts with him. "Who? Where?"
Secretly, he had already been planning on going to buy clothes and he knew exactly who to take with him: Seamus Finnegan - a fellow gay person and a stylish one at that. Harry knew the perfect Muggle places to go to when you needed to buy something classy.
Draco opened them and looked at Harry with wide grey eyes. "I don't know, he's a really nice bloke and I think I- I let my prejudices stop me from seeing this."
Ron nodded slowly and Harry guessed he too saw how stupid and pathetic this fight was. Harry noticed that they'd never just once used Malfoy's name. Hermione smiled gladly.
"I just had no time."
"No, Potter, I am not." Malfoy said. His tone made Harry realize he
"We could go somewhere and drink something," Malfoy suggested. Harry was surprised Malfoy wanted to keep doing something with Harry.
They walked upstairs and Potter stopped in front of a dark wooden door with a small label.
"Harry.", it felt so strange to hear this word from Draco's mouth, "I like you. I adore you. Bloody hell, I love you!"
Neville nodded.
"It's alright, you don't have to. I just thought it might help you get it out of your system," Malfoy said.
"Happy Birthday." He said to Nott instead, "Very nice party."
But Harry didn't want to say his thoughts out loud, so he only furrowed his brow. "I don't know, Hermione. Why do you ask?"
"Don't." Harry said as Malfoy opened his mouth again. Malfoy frowned at Harry and closed his mouth again.
To Harry's relief Malfoy nodded. He still seemed uncertain, but Harry took what he could get. Harry thought he might have even seen a tiny lift of Malfoy's corner of his mouth.
"God, do it like that– uhhh!
They danced for a long time. Ron, Neville, Seamus and Dean were already upstairs and probably already asleep, as Harry and Draco stopped dancing. But still a lot of students were in the Great Hall. Some were dancing, some were sitting and chatting and only a few were eating something. Hermione was still dancing with Krum.
Draco only smiled. He thought that this was answer enough. Potter yawned.
"What?" Harry asked.
"Sure." Malfoy rolled his eyes, "I'll go change."
"As I said, that's not the point.", Potter repeated, more calmly.
"Enjoy your juice, Malfoy.", he said.
"Because they're twins, you know?" Ron added uselessly.
ask him to follow him, so maybe Harry should say something.
Draco thought it was very important that he was there, he was Potter's partner now and he was the only one Potter was going to see constantly over the next few days while he would be on bedrest. Maybe Potter's friends thought so too, or maybe they just didn't want to upset Draco because they knew how he could be when he was upset.
"I caught them kissing when I got back to get my book.", Ron told Hermione, who clapped her hands on her cheeks.
"I just wanted to say thank you." He said, smiling wide.
The bartender's colleague tapped Harry on his shoulder. He had a rueful look on his face.
"It's just-" Draco swallowed thickly, "I've been raised differently. I learned things differently. But I don't want to put all the blame on my upbringing, I know I myself am responsible for most of it."
There was a rustling and a creaking, presumably as Draco moved over on the bed.
"Thanks, idiot." Malfoy said and before Harry could answer, Malfoy pressed his lips against Harry's.
Now even Draco stared at him. Potter had never said this before to a
Harry had to fight the urge to clap his hand against his forehead. Draco stood up, what made Nott slightly back away.
"Well yes. You were on the dance floor and two girls were around you and I got so angry somehow and I ordered another drink." Malfoy said shyly.
"Do you want to kill me?" He said loudly, but Potter only smiled and pulled out his wand. The tree stopped moving and beating, so Potter showed Draco the way into the Shrieking Shack.
"You do?", Draco asked. He only wanted to hear Potter saying it again.
"Draco, please." Blaise said sassy.
"Do you know anything else?" asked Harry.
"How much I'm starting to like you." Malfoy said as if he'd heard Harry's thoughts, "It's embarrassing."
"She and Harry's lover didn't show up.", Ginny told them.
Harry saw Hermione and Ron exchanging looks. He sipped his hot coffee and looked into the sun.
"Harry.", Granger smiled brightly and hugged Potter.
, you mean Draco?", Harry asked and Ron laughed.
"Hey.", Harry said.
Now Harry opened his eyes to find grey ones staring back at him.
Andromeda shook her head. "No, we didn't. I just thought you would like to spend new year's eve with your godson."
"Come on, Potter. Never seen one before?", Draco asked jokingly.
"I love it," Malfoy said and stared at the picture, "He's so cute."
"Can we come in?", Potter asked. Vernon nodded again and they followed him and Petunia inside the house.
Dean clapped into his hands and Seamus groaned and passed him a galleon. And now, Harry knew why they were asking questions.
Draco didn't know how he should feel right now. He had just watched another man ejaculate in front of him. Oh god he had just made another man ejaculate! He had just sucked another man off. Fuck, he had just sucked
"I would like to take you for dinner." Narcissa said to Harry, who got a bit shocked after she had spoke these words.
