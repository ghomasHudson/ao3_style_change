There had been something, that afternoon. A subtle shift in the air when he put his hand on top of the hives and knocked gently with the old iron key Molly had given him. It was a sense that something had fallen into place.
Draco shrugs, but Regulus doesn’t see it. He’s still gazing out the window. Draco has maps of the capital, and the forest and all his lands. He has the most recent scout reports. He has a lot of things, but he can’t manage to feel the same urgency he once did. Regulus is looking out over the castle and its people but Draco can only see time stretching out endless and lonely in front of him.
“Time to eat,” calls Hermione, and Blaise nods at him, then walks over to the table and holds Hermione’s chair out for her.
“A no-fly net,” says Weasley. “We’ve lowered it so he doesn’t try to come up off the ground at all and make his wing injuries worse. Ah, here he comes,” he says, pointing at the building.
“I’ve been scarred one too many times by walking into a room too quickly.” Potter shrugs. “It’s your fault, not mine.”
“Anyway,” Harry continued, “since you don’t have plans, you can come to the Leaky and get a drink with me when this shift is over.”
He looked over where Malfoy was sitting once again. His reasons were more of a mystery; it definitely wasn’t his turn again, and no one had luck
Blaise mixes some negronis, and Draco presses his tongue against the roof of his mouth, chasing that bitter note and the brightness of the orange peel. The ice clinks in the cut-glass tumblers as Blaise moves toward the far end of the library, turning on a stained glass lamp as he goes. Draco joins him in front of the only wall not lined with books. Draco can’t remember what used to hang on it, before. Now it’s home to Blaise’s own new obsession: his collection of Muggle photographs.
“You were going to buy all new furniture because yours was a little too large?” says Potter beside him.
Hermione sniffs, and dabs at her eyes. She winds her arm through his. “So what’s this Prophet story, and why are you so worried about it?”
Harry touches his fingers to Draco’s wrist. Draco can feel the warmth of him, all up his body where they are nearly pressed together, sitting side by side on the low stone wall of the patio.
Weasley’s voice is quiet. “Yes.” He sits in silence and Draco lays there, breathing. “It never works,” he says finally, and Draco moves his arm off his eyes. “You can only change the things you do, not who you are. You could drink yourself to death, I suppose, but you’ll still die Draco Malfoy, the vain prick who lashes out at anyone who gets close enough to his claws.”
Carys shakes her head. “He hated them same as the rest of us. Why would he— why would he help them?”
He sighed and rubbed at his tired, aching eyes. “I just thought everything was going to be better. After. I thought—Voldemort’s gone, things are going to get better. And they did for a bit, but now this. Barely two years without another full-scale crisis. What good was any of it? All the stuff we went through, and it seems like the wizarding world is ending, anyway.”
“I’m not moping,” Draco says before he can think better of it, and then wishes he’d held his tongue.
“That you’re selling for her, you mean,” says Dudley, who holds out an enormous hand to Draco. He shakes it, Potter’s eyes on him the entire time. This must be some kind of test— whether he’ll be rude to Potter’s Muggle cousin.
When they land a few seconds later, Draco takes a quick, involuntary step back. Everything is smoke and ash, screams and blaring confusion. The building in front of them is
Granger snorts, and they all sit down. Potter squints up at him, from the seat he’s taken beside Draco, and raises his eyebrows.
“This is horrifying,” Granger says, picking up another empty carton of takeout. “Do you two eat nothing nutritious?”
Malfoy shrugged a shoulder. “It’s not really about what I want. But she’s perfectly agreeable. She can hold an interesting conversation and I have no complaints.”
When she had poured him a cup from a steaming tea pot, she set a plate of biscuits beside him, too, and then disappeared in the back again. The owl appeared to be multitasking a nap and keeping an eye on them; it took turns opening one eye, and then the other.
He slid his hands forward, together, tugged apart the buttons holding Malfoy’s trousers closed. He was so hard already, so very hot in Harry’s hand and so ready to be touched.
How would Hogwarts run, without magic? Would King’s Cross still contain Platform 9 3/4, or would there only be platforms 9 and 10? Would the Forbidden Forest, someday soon, be empty of its creatures?
is the ghost in his garden. He is both silvered figment and his own solid and flesh face pressing against the window, watching. Spinning and spun, haunting and haunted. Turning and turning, an open mouth with no sound.
“Call your boss,” Potter cuts in. “Now, please. You’ve no idea how much paperwork I have waiting for me, and I really haven’t got time to go through all this with you. Let’s just make this easier for everyone, yeah?”
“Don’t you know, Potter?” Draco asks. “Martyrdom looks so very good, especially during an election cycle.”
“Come on Monday, in time for dinner. I’ll owl you the Floo address.” She looks at Potter now, and winks. “Bring your… partner.”
Harry’s green, green eyes are locked on his. His entire face is lit up with hope and with something that looks a lot like love. Draco knows it, because he can feel it leaking out of his own face, from every pore.
“No, thank you.” Malfoy follows him down the hall and through the kitchen. It’s Harry’s favorite room in the cottage, with it’s big, old AGA cooker and rough-hewn open shelving around the walls. It came with a scarred old farm table and polished butcher block and in the mornings he stands looking out the window toward the garden with his morning tea, feeling settled deep inside his bones.
“Good,” says Draco. “I told her to get him out of here. We can question him anytime, but I doubt he’ll know enough to be much help.”
“Photographs are rather black and white. I’m not sure what you think might be left to doubt in this news story.”
“It’s skin colour,” Blaise told him as he walked Draco out that night, trailing the adults and looking at the portraits. Blaise had always sounded idle and unaffected, even when they were boys. “In many parts of the Muggle world, my family would have been sold in chains until rather recently.”
Malfoy shook his head. He looked unsettled. “If anyone were seeking revenge, it should be you. I suppose the one thing incarceration provides is ample time to think things over. I can’t—” Malfoy stopped. He seemed to struggle for words. “I can’t believe I was so stupid, for so long. That I did so much harm.”
He holds out his hand, and waits. Draco lets his own hand fall onto Potter’s, and then they swirl away.
“Thank you.” He follows where she’d pointed, and finds a wooden door, painted sky blue and the top half open, and inside a big, old farm kitchen with a hearth burning and pots bubbling on a old iron stove against another wall.
It's a standard-sized, heavy-quilted tea cosy, trimmed top and bottom in royal blue, but the fabric is a loud, lurid orange checked with a red so bright and vivid it borders on neon pink. There are stripes of fake embroidery—crowns and tiny, repeating British flags. And in the middle, a large circular likeness of a young Queen Elizabeth, the image stretched strangely so that she appears to possess enormous jowls, like a peculiarly upsetting cross between the monarch and Cornelius Fudge.
actually belong here,” said the ghost of Draco Malfoy. “Or at least, this is one of the places in which I belong, as it is a Black family house and I am a member of the Black family by blood. You are no Black.”
Harry was breathing harder, slow and deep. It felt like Malfoy was casting a spell, some kind of magic born simply of his mouth moving on Harry’s skin. The hush of the flat, the buzz of the whiskey. Harry felt like he could be anything inside of this dream.
“I have my own garden,” he’d told his mother when she came by yesterday, and smothered a smile as she blinked and tried not to cringe at the sight. The Malfoy gardens were sprawling, manicured blankets of flowers and combed lawns.
“Just so,” agreed the ghost of Malfoy. “I feel I understand the Muggle concept of hell now. What else could explain your conspicuous presence in my afterlife?”
Its wings, once a lovely, shimmering ruby-color, are stained in darker red gore now, shredded messily and brutally from the shoulder cartilage to the tips.
Sometimes Harry read through the file notes of cases Malfoy had worked on. He was curious about how Malfoy worked, how he fit into this new world: the Aurors, yes, but also just this world that was
Draco lets his head fall and smiles against Potter’s lower back, then bites down, just slightly, before he pulls his fingers out. He rubs a hand, slick with lube, over his cock. He’s been hard for so long, the touch is almost painful in how good it feels.
“You should be alright for awhile, Hermione,” said Neville. “I don’t think she’s paying any attention to what we’re saying.”
Draco can feel his heartbeat pushing against Harry’s hand, the pulse in his wrist rising to find him. He squeezes, just slightly, to feel the give of Harry’s fingers laced with his.
Blaise stares at him. “You’re mental. You do know that, don’t you, Potter? As your estate agent and, more importantly, as your friend, I feel like I need to make sure you know that.”
Malfoy looked so startled. He wasn’t sure if it was what he’d just said, or the fact that he’d said it to Malfoy. After all, they’d never been friends. But the thing was, Harry couldn’t say that to any of his friends. They cared too much; they’d only argue and get worried. And it felt so good, just getting that out into the air.
Draco thinks it’s a very bad idea, but there’s not enough time to complain about it. They squeeze into the cramped space and close the door, Potter muttering a spell to lock it. Hopefully Warrington doesn’t want to relive his glory days at Hogwarts right now.
Blaise opens a drawer by his knee and rummages around, then sets a thin box just slightly bigger than his open hand on the desk. There’s a cord attached to it leading to one of the weird head pieces Draco has seen Muggles wear on the Tube. Blaise presses a button and the top pops up, revealing a shiny disc.
“Evers,” he says, and the man jumps up, reaching for his wand. “Expelliarmus.” Draco catches the wand and tucks it into the front pocket of his robes, his own still trained on Evers.
It looks like a knitted hat, but there’s a big hole on one side. It’s where the spout of a teapot would go, he realises as he takes it from her.
In this way they discovered that there was no place, really, that they could not touch and be touched by each other.
Silver blooming on the patch of raggedy grass behind his kitchen. An unfolding, a sharpening of the suggestion of a human form. The ghost is a woman, her hair spilling in thick ropes down her back and over her shoulders. She turns and turns in his garden, in circles and disjointed loops, looking and looking, her pale mouth open and
“Not nothing. We aren’t ill.” Hermione looked away for a moment, at something Harry couldn’t see. He watched as her mouth, pursed with what he recognised as disapproval, relaxed. “Isolation is hard on everyone, especially after...” She trailed off and looked at Harry again. “Well, after everything. How are you
“Of course. I’ll have an elf show you up. What about you, Dudley? Shall I have a mount saddled for you?”
They stood and looked at each other. Malfoy’s arms and legs looked longer than he remembered, all angles and graceful lines.
Straight lines and fresh pleats, and his daily monastic litany in his head: he is blank again, he is
Scouts are spotted on the border, in the forest. Draco orders extra guards to patrol and sends a letter to the capital.
Potter catches him around the waist as he heads for the kettle, and slides sleepy lips against his. Draco smiles into the kiss.
“It’s over, Potter,” Draco cuts in. He chances a look back at him; Potter is very still and very silent. Draco had been wishing he could see past the Sayre disguise all week, but now it would be easier to look at. It would be easier not to see Harry. “All that is over now.”
, Harry thought as he watched a few flakes of snow sputter and swirl down from the overcast sky outside the Ministry’s windows. He wondered if it would be a trend; Christmases stuck at his desk in this empty bullpen, everyone enjoying themselves but him.
Harry turned his head to look back at him. He was looking at Harry’s back, which was still tingling pleasantly from the light nips he’d placed along his spine. Malfoy brushed his fingers along Harry’s shoulder blade, still looking at something Harry couldn’t see.
“You’re not even an Auror anymore, Weasley,” Draco drawls. “In fact, you hold no Ministry position at all, as far as I’m aware.”
He can hear things happening behind the door when he rings the bell— thumping getting louder and closer, and some sort of muted wailing of words he can’t make out. Then the door is wrenched open and Potter appears, looking harried.
“But you showed me what it looks like to lead people well, Draco,” he continues. “You showed me why it matters.”
“Malfoy,” he said suddenly. The blonde head across the room turned. “You haven’t eaten yet, have you?”
Draco is still thinking about those words when Pansy finds him still in the telephone box. “People should be arriving soon,” she says, coming to sit beside him. She smells like the jasmine perfume he buys her for Christmas every year, and her lips are painted a deep ruby red. “Who are you talking to this time?” She nods at the telephone in his hand.
Draco notices things about Harry as well. He notices the double whorls of dark hair on the crown of Harry’s hair, and the curl of his shoulders from behind. He notices the pale, zigzagging scar on Harry’s forehead and how it trails off into nothing just above his right temple. Harry cracks his knuckles when he’s bored and bounces very slightly on the balls of his feet when it’s time for dinner. Harry saves buns from the kitchens and slips them to the children of farmers they visit.
“There you are,” says Potter. “I think Ron and Hermione secretly didn’t believe me when I told them you were coming for dinner.” The look on his face must communicate at least some portion of his sudden misapprehension and dread, because Potter lets out a little laugh, his smile big and real. Draco realises he’s never seen one of Potter’s real smiles directed at him, and the thought brings a flush of warmth to his face.
He decides it began right there, late July in a city bombed to hell during the Muggle's second world war, then viciously rocked again by followers of Voldemort in the more recent Wizarding War, a city still sore to the touch. Something about the lights and the echo of voices, heard and yet indistinct, are making ghosts of memory pulse in his head. Harry had walked by the Warsaw Nike that afternoon, had stood there for a good three quarters of an hour thinking about wars and the shape of the world after them. The British Ministry had sent money to the Polish one for a statue to their dead. It wasn't built yet—Harry wondered what form it would take.
Fergus Finnagle takes off his spectacles and wipes them on his robes, looking at Harry with a benevolent expression. "Of course you did, Mr. Potter, of course you did! No one doubts your work! But when there are so few left to find anyway—"
Harry meets Hermione at coffee shops and cafés near the Ministry on her lunch breaks. Usually they drink tea because Hermione is always busy with some new piece of legislation or some kind of study, but sometimes Harry convinces her to go the pub with him. After a few pints, he says:
Draco shakes the memory off as Guido says, “Master Blaise has not come downstairs yet today. Shall I announce you?”
Draco pushes harder, into him and down on the back of his neck, pinning him in place. Letting him do nothing but take. And then he’s moving, pushing forward and back again, and the world goes white behind Harry’s eyelids, all heat and pleasure and relief.
“It’s slightly ridiculous, isn’t it?” Draco asks when they stop for breath. “Falling in love at our age.”
“Hermione. I’ve been through worse things than this. You’ve been through them with me, for fuck's sake.”
“Complicated sounds like code for a love affair,” Hermione says, and then, looking at his face, “Oh Harry. Really? Who is it?”
“You know how you hear about people getting into ruts,” Draco is saying over their third mug of mulled wine a piece. “And one of them has an affair, and then it’s all just a spiral of misery from there?”
“Later, Potter,” he says when Potter pulls back. “Put the kettle on. I’ve been down to the shops. Your tea is shit, by the way.”
Harry takes a moment, after they’re all sitting down with full plates, to be fiercely, deeply grateful for his friends. For the people sitting around his table. Then he says, “There’s something I wanted to tell you.”
Malfoy seemed to only grow angrier, if it were possible. He’d completely abandoned looking through the cubbies. “What do you think I mean?” He stabbed a hand toward Harry’s left arm, folded at a ninety degree angle across his body and held there by the sling. “You should never have dropped your shield while that wizard was still holding a wand. Of all the—“
Malfoy glances at him. “No. Astoria prefers an apartment in Paris.” They pass through what looks like a formal dining room and then a conservatory.
Draco opens his mouth, then closes it. On a bench beside his bed is a marble chess set. He reaches over and grabs a handful of the pieces.
Draco smiles, and then he laughs around the light, full feeling in his chest. “No, he’s right. But don’t worry— this would never, not in a million years, have been allowed to grace the table at Malfoy Manor growing up.”
He can feel the heat rising through his body; not in embarrassment, but in pleasure. At the memory, at the precise timbre of Malfoy’s voice as he said ‘Potter’ just now. At the fact that they were standing here at all, in his own garden, after all these years, with no one and no reasons to feel guilty about anything they might want to do to each other.
Potter is still rolling his hips into Draco as they kiss. The whole cabinet is warm and humid now; it feels foggy and encompassing, but Draco doesn’t feel claustrophobic. Not at all. He could stay in this heated unreality forever. He pulls Potter’s bottom lip into his mouth and sucks on it, careful to be quiet. Potter’s hip thrust forward, hard, and he grabs at the waistband of Draco’s trousers.
“I’m so sorry,” he begins. “That you had to find out this way. It just— happened suddenly, and didn’t feel ready for telling
“My mother always said a person’s face might freeze like that. You’re only one sly charm away from a perpetual grimace,” Malfoy said. He looked up from where he was picking at his fingernails. “Course, I don’t know that there’d be much difference, in your case.”
Draco falls to his knees. The button on Potter’s pants gives way easily, and he pulls them apart and down until Potter’s cock bobs out in front of him. He’s breathing so hard now, looking at the swollen length in front of him, and so is Potter. He looks down at Draco. His eyelids are heavy over his green eyes, his lips parted and his cheeks are flushed and his dark hair is messier than usual. Draco leans in the remaining few inches and takes the tip of Potter’s cock into his mouth. He tastes it, slowly, his tongue swirling and lapping, and Potter groans low and deep.
“Cheer up, Malfoy.” Robards says, sending a pile of memos flying across the room with his wand. They shuffle themselves in midair, and fall singularly, like giant snowflakes, on desks all around the bullpen. Draco can hear a chorus of groans start up. “You’ve got more time to ingratiate yourself to our future Minister of Magic.”
Draco is filled with the sense of time running out. His time, here in his home. Regulus will stay here, in charge of the Malfoy soldiers and the defense of the castle. He’s been Draco’s only real companion for so long, taught Draco everything he knows about leading people, about taking care of them.
He blinked, and took a step back. All the shards fell to the floor. Malfoy was looking pale and deflated across from him.
“Easier,” Malfoy finished. He took the paper out of Harry’s hands and placed it in the file, then closed the whole thing.
Malfoy’s mouth went all tight, and he dropped his eyes to the desk in front of him. Harry waited, but the usual sharp comeback never came.
Charlie sighs. “The wings are actually looking pretty good. They’re healing. If we can keep him from using them until the potions do their job, we can save them and he’ll fly again.”
He hears voices coming from somewhere else in the house when he steps out at Grimmauld Place, and he has just enough time to get really nervous before Potter comes into the room.
Weasley shrugs his massive shoulders. “Doesn’t usually work. Have to keep them completely still for weeks, and they usually throw off the tranquilizers after one week, tops, and rip all the wounds open again. A few cycles of that, and infection starts to set in, and the wings have to amputated.”
The ghost of Draco Malfoy raised one semi-translucent eyebrow. The clock on the mantle ticked its way beyond midnight and Harry struggled to catch his breath.
Draco holds tight to the little slip of paper in his hand, scanning the row of houses in front of him. He looks down at the address there again, in Granger’s neat, precise handwriting, and he mouths it aloud to himself, like a mantra.
“Maybe that bed doesn’t need to be any bigger,” Draco breathes into his ear, hot and damp. Harry’s hand is still sliding up and down his heated skin, and Draco’s hips are twitching and rocking on his lap. He nips at Harry’s lip again.
Potter puts his hand on Draco’s collar, slowly pulling at the fabric like he’s straightening it. “Might as well turn in for the night,” he says. “Don’t you think?”
“Draco.” His mother is standing in front of him. “How much have you had to drink?” Her voice is cool and calm and he focuses on it.
Potter’s mouth is all over Draco’s throat, and then he lifts up to nip at Draco’s jawline, and all the while he keeps rocking Draco into this huge hunger, this enormous need that will only always want more.
“Yeah, that’s what I thought, too. But then I remembered that we’re in the middle of a mysterious pandemic that’s draining the wizarding world of its magic, and Malfoy is in Azkaban, and…”
“I need to know,” Draco said. He’d listed them— everything they’d found lingering in Lucius’s system— a recitation of trace herbs and equivocation, even to himself.
“There was a protest in the Ministry today. Supposedly a group of Muggleborns complaining about the Wizengamot. A small fire was started in the Atrium.”
Potter laughs like he’s making up for lost time. Like there’s an expiration date on some kind of joy he couldn’t reach for a long, long time, and if he doesn’t use it now it will disappear forever.
“I thought you and the girl Weasley were a thing,” Malfoy pressed. “Weren’t you going to get married and repopulate Hogwarts with your horrifying spawn?”
“I am not hallucinating or dreaming or imagining Draco Malfoy’s ghost in my house. I need you to believe me. I need you to take me seriously.”
Draco shudders, and Harry’s eyes move over his face, down his neck to his chest, and then Harry is looking at the point where Draco’s thighs bracket his hips. Draco can’t resist reaching out to feel the skin at the base of Harry’s neck, in the little dip of his throat, the place where Harry’s pulse and his breath race wildly with each other.
There were two ways to think about ghosts. There was a haunting that was internal, guilt or shame or grief hovering and dogging a person’s every step; and then there were actual, physical hauntings—a blood-spattered Baron from the eleventh century wandering the halls of your boarding school, say, or the little flower-selling girl in the shabby Victorian dress who sat on the back steps of your garden at night. If you thought about it, the second, non-metaphorical variety of ghost was actually the least dangerous. That was what Harry would have said, anyway—until the dark, really-quite-chilly night when he looked up and saw the ghost of Draco Malfoy standing across from him in the parlour of Grimmauld Place.
Dean shrugs, and then carefully dabs a bit of green paint onto the canvas with his brush. “Maybe. Maybe not. I don’t blame you. All I’m saying is maybe it’s harder to apologize to them because you feel more responsible for the things you’re sorry about.”
He had loved it: the warm weight of Potter’s cock pressing slickly in and out, the flex of muscle at Potter’s hips as he fought to keep himself from thrusting hard into Draco’s waiting mouth. The sounds falling out of Potter’s mouth— gods, the heavy breaths and the little curls of involuntary moaning notes dripping out of Potter as he ran his fingers into Draco’s hair, back and forth and over and over. His own mouth become pure hunger: to take Potter inside, to take him soft and then deeper, harder. The tips of Potter’s fingers just rubbing, so lightly, against his jawline, and the way Potter watched, so intently, as his cock slid in and out of Draco’s mouth.
As soon as he passes through the wards on the front gate, the air turns from the cool, crisp Cotswolds afternoon to the warm, sun-washed sigh of the Mediterranean. Guido, the only Zabini house elf left, answers Draco’s knock in his usual black tie. His only concession to the way things have changed is the lack of a jacket and shirtsleeves rolled midway up his arms— an unheard of informality in the old days.
“We don’t do anonymous transactions. Blaise says it keeps everything above-board. Not like the old days, with the—“ Greg stops.
Potter makes a very particular sound when Draco puts one— then two— slick fingers inside his arse. A high, breathy kind of sound, like he’s swallowed a word before it left his tongue. Draco has memorized all the sounds Potter makes when they do this together.
And then Potter is gone, across the Atrium and into the lifts, and when Draco looks down at Potter’s scrawl, he sees that it’s an address.
By the time Potter went utterly still, some indecipherable words on his lips and his head thrown back as if he was talking to Draco and the gods both, his own breath was coming so hard and hot that he hardly recognized himself. He hadn’t touched his own cock yet, but somehow Potter’s pleasure and being its sole source had pleasured
Potter turns away, toward the window that looks out over the street in front of the house. He fiddles with the blind, opening and closing the slats. “So you can let yourself in. Any time.”
"Then how do you stand it?" Malfoy's voice is scratchy, like it's catching on something sharp and jagged on the way up his throat. "How can you do this over and over, assignment after assignment, night after night, and stay so calm?"
— to find someone who understands that as I do. My father has some trouble seeing the bigger picture.”
Whenever they have some leave and they are back in London, they scatter into different directions. Luna visits her father in St Mungo's new residential extension of the Janus Thickey Ward; she has painted every wall of his tiny cottage and has started on the ceiling. She works on compiling the best articles from the now-defunct
“No.” Harry waited, but that’s all Malfoy said. He wasn’t looking at Harry; he began to organize the file between them, clipping together photographs and notes. Harry let the silence stretch. He scrawled his signature across the bottom of the paper and let his eyes drift over the words he’d written.
“What’s that smell?” he says. There’s something— something lying on top of the smell of century-old brick turned to dust, something beside the tang of melted steel twisting in on itself— “It smells like old fruit.”
is not a word that ever seems to apply to Pansy. He’s given her full freedom since she left her parents’ estate upon their betrothal, but it hasn’t made her any more content.
Malfoy pulled out his wand. He waved it in circles, smaller and tighter as he went, and all the tiny, broken pieces began to swirl gently along the floor, before rising slowly and knitting back together into all the useful objects they’d been before. Tea pots and mugs and plates. Harry pointed his own wand at the cracked glass tabletops. “Reparo maxima,” he said, and the surfaces turned smooth again.
Malfoy smiles, though. He really does look softer when he smiles. Harry has a burst of sense memory, of wanting to feel Malfoy’s jaw under his fingers again. He thinks about that vision in the Mirror and how, just weeks later, he was standing here with Malfoy again, after almost twenty years of silence.
“Cottage is that way,” Weasley points back toward the beach, but further south. “Only other building on that side’s the lighthouse.” Weasley puts his cigarette out against his boot.
. When Draco’s fingers brushed against his at the kitchen sink, or when he’d wiped at a bit of soil on Draco’s sleeve, and Draco had turned his head just so, his eyes on Harry’s lips and his pupils blowing wide.
Harry looked back at her. In the Floo, her hair curled up and around her face and seemed to merge with the sparks and flames of the magical fire. “It’s just better, you know? To be stuck here with someone else.”
Draco sighs. “Yes. The one you’re selling is very rare. I am of course willing to pay the appropriate price for such a valuable piece.”
You’d think, after defeating Voldemort, that Harry’s luck would change. He’d certainly thought so himself— that it was all an upward trajectory from certain death. And yet, here he was, pulling the night shift on Christmas Eve with Draco fucking Malfoy, with his ridiculous hair slicked back away from his pointy ferret face and his stupidly expensive black boots propped up on his desk. Harry been stunned, when he heard that Malfoy had applied to the Auror training program a couple years after the war. And yet somehow Malfoy made it, and here he was, the newest Auror in the department.
Potter had slumped down onto the floor with him and, still panting and trembling, tugged at the buttons on Draco’s trousers until they gave way and he’d wrapped a hot hand around Draco’s painfully hard cock and he’d
Draco looks quickly away. They are careful, he and Potter— very careful— to move in polite circles around each other.
“If I say ’Weasley,’” Blaise replies, turning for the back door with a big brass key he’s just produced from seemingly nowhere, “You might think I’m talking about Ronald.”
Harry tried to imagine what Malfoy’s life would have been like, in Azkaban after the war. There were no Dementors there, not anymore, but he still would have been alone—and confined—for a long time. Harry thought about the past few months stuck in Grimmauld Place and he shivered. Maybe he deserved to be haunted by Malfoy.
“Right,” said Harry. “Get out. Go haunt someone else. I can’t handle your pointy ghost face around the place with everything else going on. Go on, get the fuck out of my house.”
“I’m sorry, Harry,” says Draco, and he walks over to the stove to turn off the burner. He pulls the kettle off and to the side, and when he turns back again Potter is right there. Right behind, right in reach. He leans into him. Harry smells like lemon soap and milky tea. He smells like home.
Potter looks at him, something sharp in his gaze, as if he’s weighing and measuring the truth of Draco’s words.
Harry rolls over onto his stomach and rests on his elbows to look down at Draco’s face. “What’s wrong with the capital?”
Potter had just smiled at him, like he knew something about the joke that Draco didn’t. It was annoying, really, the way Potter seemed to think he knew more about Draco than he had any right or reason to. The way he took things Draco said without the venom intended, sometimes.
Potter runs his hand through his hair, pale brown now, above a face that isn’t his and that Draco grows more uncomfortable seeing every day, for some reason. “This is good,” he says, and finishes removing his sweater. His long-sleeved shirt underneath sticks in damp patches to his abdomen, and Draco looks away. “But we need something more concrete if we’re going to bring him in.”
"There are too many people here." Malfoy is suddenly beside him. He speaks very quietly. "He's armed, and he won't go easily. Someone will get hurt."
When Draco steps out of the lift, the waiting room outside the Minister’s office is stuffed with people hoping for a moment with him. Draco hesitates on the edge of the crowd. This feels wrong, somehow. He doesn’t know what he’s doing here.
“I’m so glad you two are here today,” Pansy had confided, ignoring the fact that she’d ordered Draco to arrive this afternoon. “Cassius won’t be back until late tonight, so otherwise I wouldn’t have anyone to keep me company besides his stuffy relatives.”
He sat, and breathed for another moment. “This was always going to hurt somehow, Potter. You and me.” Potter turned his head to look at him, so he turned, too, and their eyes met.  “Wasn’t it already?”
Harry wondered, suddenly, what it might be like for Malfoy. To come to work every day knowing everyone there sort of hated you, and worse: didn’t trust you. Not that Malfoy deserved anyone’s trust. Not yet. That was something he had to earn, but Harry did feel an unaccustomed stab of empathy for what must look like a long, steep climb. He wondered if Malfoy would stick it out. He wondered if Malfoy had really changed, deep down where it counted.
Tom Evers is sitting on an overturned crate when he gets to the top, looking away from him, out toward the darkness. Draco wonders if he wishes he could go back and make a different choice. If he feels locked into his current path, no matter how many doubts he has. He wonders if the pain and the rage have grown bigger than the love that started it all.
Draco takes a deep breath, and Harry watches the swell of his chest. “Are you very hungry?” he asks, looks back up to see Draco watching his mouth.
There are storm clouds forming out on the ocean when he lands on the beach at Ynys Llanddwyn. Sand flies out from under his boots, and he turns his face into the wind whipping up off the water for a moment. He looks at the lighthouse. The top is still dark. He turns toward the cottage of the Kitchen Witch and makes his way over the dune, to the little path of crushed shells among the tall grasses.
“Yes. I told you she was good. Mother’s just down that first path, Potter. I’ll come back in a bit to see how you’re getting on.”
Harry was really quite drunk, and tired as well. He couldn’t think of any argument against this Malfoy staying. There was something fitting about it. There was something familiar and even mildly comforting about the thought of being haunted. Like being lost and then found.
“Yes.” The voice was just right, the way the vowel seemed to stretch out inside the word, the deep, slightly nasal tone. Draco knew it wasn’t quite, but it
He felt the same way now, as Draco’s not-solid finger traced up his wrist and rested against Harry’s racing pulse. It wasn’t like being touched in any way Harry had experienced before, but there was a force—feral and buzzing—that pressed against his skin, that sparked hot and cold all over his body. It shifted, ebbing and flowing, as Draco’s fingers skimmed up Harry’s arm and rested against the side of Harry’s neck. Harry tipped his head forward, his own hands reaching out, breath uneven, and hungry, absolutely ravenous to touch and taste Malfoy as well. But there was nothing to connect with: his hands passed through Draco’s form as if passing through a cold draft.
He can see why this is one of the best guest rooms; there’s a huge picture window looking down over the sea, crashing onto the narrow strip of sand below. There’s a large en suite bath with a copper soaking tub attached, and the normal finery he’d expect to see in a high society house. The bed is large, a tall four-poster taking up most of the center of the room.
“The wife says she hasn’t seen or heard a thing. She seemed rather disinterested in her husband’s project, actually.”
There was a bad man, and the knowledge of that empty bed in St. Mungo’s reserved with his name on it, and there was a sudden, sinking regret that he might never see Harry Potter again. Never have the chance to fill that last, fumbling silence.
“I know I amuse you,” she says. “But I’m not what you want. I can live with that, Draco. What I need to know is if you can live with it, too.”
“It’s weird, isn’t?” Potter says as they watch people get on and off the train, crowding in to where they’re sitting. “That a tea cosy is why we’re doing this. Why we’re hanging out, all these years after— well, you know.”
“Speaking of, I told Daphne I would take her by my stylist tomorrow evening. You can amuse yourself for dinner, can’t you?”
“And then George said, ‘What do you mean the Elephant Trunk Charm hasn’t worn off? I can see your nose right now and it looks like the same nose you’ve always had, Macmillan. Blame your mum and dad for that.’ And then Ernie’s face turned so red I was worried he was having some sort of fit, and all of a sudden he just dropped his trousers. Right in the middle of the store! And bugger me if his knob wasn’t—“
Ginny smiles back, a little slow, a little sad, her chin in her hand. “Kids grow up, Harry. Like flowers and weeds and trees. It’s just what they do.”
“Time to go, boys,” cries Charlie, and he gives the dragon’s rump a sharp slap. Phoenix slides forward, then jumps into the air, his healed wings snapping out around him with a loud beating noise. They flap, and the dragon rises, little by little. He seems surprised, like maybe he’d doubted that he would ever feel the air bending to his will again.
Harry shivered—he could hear the longing in Draco’s voice, and it mirrored his own, echoes feeding off each other. He couldn’t remember deciding to move, and yet there he was, standing right in front of the incorporeal body of Draco Malfoy, which seemed even now to flicker with a tamped-down desire that Harry could almost taste.
"There are other people who could do this now, you know," Snape continues. "It doesn't always have to be you."
The place where Draco’s hair curled against the back of his neck. The dip just above his mouth. His shoulder. The hard plane of his chest. Lower, where his belly would be soft and ticklish. His wrists and his long fingers. The backs of his knees. Draco’s lips with his lips. His arse. His sides, to pull him closer. Eyelids, the bridge of his nose, the sharp line of his jaw.
Potter leaves first, after making sure the way is clear, and Draco follows a few minutes after, still feeling like he’s moving underwater.
. He knows that feeling—that sharp curl of instinct sitting low in the belly— so well he can still taste it now. Now, when his life has become the other reaction.
The ghost is a man; a boy, really, probably a teenager when he died. He’s wearing clothing from a much older time period— breeches and a rough homespun coat. He doesn’t look like anyone. Not Lucius, or the woman who died in the fire. Not Draco himself, or any of the ghosts he carries along with him, the ones of his own making.
He hears her scoff from all the way down the hallway, and smiles to himself. Pansy’s place is small— by any standards they’d grown up with, anyway— but the living room is big and open, with windows looking out over Regents Park. He looks down at it for a few minutes, as the street lamps blink on and people start to hurry to their dinners and evening plans. It’s hinting at rain outside, and he can’t stop thinking about that time Potter met him outside the Covent Garden tube station, even though he’d had no reason to.
“That’s going to be difficult.” Potter leaned forward, his hands clasped on his knee. “How are we going to do that?”
They hear him before they see him— a low rumble like a cat’s purr, but louder and much, much deeper. Then the young Welsh Red bounds out from the large barn and down the little run leading to field.
He didn’t see Malfoy after that final night, except in the occasional photo in the Daily Prophet. He didn’t see him again until that morning they were both putting their children on the Hogwarts Express. He’d sometimes wondered, over the years, why they hadn’t kept in touch. Why they couldn’t have been friends, of a sort.
"No,” she says, “and I still maintain that intention doesn’t absolve anything, but— well, it’s not just about right and wrong. If all we’re doing is
"Dunno if I'm supposed to tell you this, but you guys are the best Special Team the Aurors have got," Neville told them at one meet-up. "Wish I'd been better in the field."
Granger pops out of sight, and Potter looks back at him. “Wanna recreate our own crime scene later? You can play investigator. I’ll play the body.”
There was a dust-filled hallway, and a door framed in old, rough-hewn wood. And when he’d put his hand up, his palm had barely touched the surface when the lock clicked and it popped open to him as if it had been waiting for this all along.
Draco watches the man, but Warrington’s either terribly good at acting or truly amused by Pansy. He merely raises his coffee cup and says, “Cheers, darling,” with a small smile on his face.
“No,” Draco says. “No, this is a perfect metaphor for every trouble we have right now. I tell you we need to spend some time alone to reconnect, and you bring me to a hovel.”
Draco still doesn’t know quite what he’s doing when Sunday afternoon arrives. He stands there on one side of a seemingly normal street, the scrap of paper in his hand, and watches the brick townhouse slide into view among the row of its Muggle neighbors when he whispers the address out loud. He straightens his spine, pulls back his shoulders, and crosses the street.
Pansy staggers back, her face gone pale and frozen. She holds herself up on the corner of the table. Draco hasn’t seen her composure shatter like this since the War.
“You might have something there,” she interrupts, leaning forward again. She pulls out a copy of the Prophet and pushes it across the table toward him. It’s from this morning; he’d vaguely noted the front page photo of a smiling Cormac McLaggen as he walked past a newsstand on the way to work. He looks at the headline now—
Malfoy’s boots dropped down to the floor as he sat up straight, his back rigid and his face hard and cold, like glass. “You don’t know anything at all about my mother, Potter. I’d advise you not to open your stupid mouth and speak about her as if you do.”
Draco stands on the other side of the table and scoops up a bit of dough on his finger. “I think you mean you love my dick.”
“Thank you for your hard work yesterday,” Robards says to the assembled Aurors. “Whatever you had on deck, whatever you were doing when the alarm went off, try and clear that today. Be cognizant of our priorities, though— our highest is catching whoever did this and preventing any new attacks.”
Harry scowled at the clock again; only twelve minutes had passed since the last time he glanced at it, which felt impossible. Time seemed to be stalling, stretching out improbably like taffy being pulled on those machines they put in the storefronts of beach towns. And yet each hour that passed was another he was
"I'll work on being silent and deadly," Malfoy says drily, then looks at Harry, his eyebrows raised. Harry is thinking again about Malfoy's fingers against his wrist. About the pressure that edged into something like pain and how it held him down in his body as if his body was something important, something necessary. He is thinking about Malfoy's hands and his jawline, about the gap Malfoy's shirt collar makes when he undoes the top button as they compare notes after an evening of surveillance. He is thinking about the skin there, right at the base of Malfoy's throat—what it would smell like and taste like and feel like under the careful application of his teeth.
Malfoy's head tilts a little to the left, and he swirls the liquid around his glass. "You're the leader," he says, and then he meets Harry's eyes. "We could wait and see if Longbottom has anything new."
“There’s more,” says Granger, before he can reply. “The Ministry did receive a request for a security detail, and the roster had Harry down to do it.”
. Two hundred pain receptors per square inch in the human body and it was nothing but background noise in the explosion, the revelation, that was Harry Potter’s body against his.
“Relax, Malfoy. I do know how to do my job, you know. Whatever else you think of me, I’m a good Auror.”
He could feel Potter looking at him, and then an arm slipped around his waist. “I don’t think of your father when I look at you.”
He knows, because no matter how often he tells himself it’s the last time, it never is. It’s a wicked little curl low in his belly, a sharp stab of heat that swirls up, and down, and everywhere his blood travels through his body, this thing Potter does to him. One of these days, he promises himself every time— every morning he wakes up in the wrong flat, the wrong blanket all rumpled and wadded down around his knees, the wrong walls around him filled up with Quidditch posters and framed photos of the wrong people— he’ll run the right way. Away from Potter, and Potter’s hands and mouth and cluttered flat, from the ridiculous heat of his body and the way he smiles just as his eyes are closing in sleep, every time.
“Oh, turn around,” Draco says impatiently, and he points his wand at Potter’s hair. Potter freezes, just for a second, and then deliberately relaxes his body. Draco pretends not to have noticed, and murmurs a spell. Potter’s hair goes limp and shiny, and then arranges itself into a parted style swept back from his forehead.
Draco opens its door, running his fingers over where the red paint is chipping away along the handle. Pansy used an extending charm on the inside, once she got it home, and there were cushioned benches running around the walls now. Draco sits down near the telephone and pulls the receiver off its hook. There’s no dial tone because there’s no hook-up for it, but he likes the weight of the plastic when he rests it on his chest.
“Yeah,” Harry said. He tried to imagine who he might be if Hermione Granger hadn’t fixed herself into his life like a North Star, but no version of himself in that scenario appealed.
“The good kind,” Draco assures him. “The kind that begins with me telling you to bring your broomstick.”
There are rose bushes growing all over a stone wall running along the far side of the property, in desperate need of pruning and some careful attention. There are two big oak trees in the back, and a clump of smaller apple trees, too. Way back, almost invisible in the wildness, he can hear the trickle and burble of a small creek.
As he watches the shadows lengthen and stretch out, a wisp of silver catches his eye. It bobs and flutters against the stone wall, skirting broken pieces of an ancient lawn chair and lingering around the roots of the scrawny vines, before growing and settling into shape in front of the roses. A human shape. The evening is still hanging onto the last grey light of the dying day, so he can only make out an impression of its form, but it seems small. Young, he thinks, and alone. Its head turns toward the window, toward Draco, and he stands as though struck in place— one breath, two— and then the silver child turns away and blinks out of sight. His garden is empty again.
The young dragon’s head becomes visible as he comes up to the door of the building, He  stops, turning his head left and right and back and forth again, peering out at the outside world. He seems wary, unsure. Finally he stretches his neck and his head comes out into the sunlight. The dragon closes its eyes. It looks like he’s relishing the bit of warmth, like a cat.  After another long moment, he stalks out into the pen. His wings are covered with thick, splinted bandages and there’s a strong herbal smell from the salves.
“It’s just that it’s a little more… basic than the brochure said it’d be,” Harry tries. The man just looks at him. “It’s rather rundown, is all I’m saying, and—“
“Ron loves you,” Hermione says. “If it’s something you really want, I reckon he’ll come round, and quickly. Because if you feel that way about it, Harry, it can’t really be bad.”
Dudley’s eyebrows draw together. “Huh,” he says. “Well, I’ll tell her. I didn’t think it’d sell. Hope she gives it up— no idea why she’s so fond of it.” Dudley looks at him, apologetic. “No offense.”
He steps back again, quietly. He doesn’t want to wake the Lucius in the portrait. Doesn’t want to shatter the memory. Back in the entrance, he eases the door shut again, and then leans against it for awhile, remembering. Trying to give the good more weight, that it might begin to equal all that had come after.
Harry is looking at him in a way Draco doesn’t understand—he is both here with Draco, warm and rumpled, and far away, somewhere Draco cannot follow.
“Sure, Rowle,” says Potter, and he sounds almost bored. He’s got his wand in hand, but his grip is loose, and he’s flicking the end lazily against the side of his leg. Which is a classic, overconfident
It’s front page Monday morning. There are lots of stares, and whispers, but Harry finds he doesn’t care. On Tuesday, there’s a full story on he and Ginny’s divorce, and speculation about where he’s living. On Wednesday, someone has leaked the news of his resignation from the Aurors. He receives letters back from all three children, telling him they’re fine with whatever makes him happy, and that’s the last weight off his shoulders.
Harry fumbled with his own trousers, unable to not touch himself anymore. Everything about Malfoy in that moment, from his pale hair falling over his forehead and into his eyes, to his thighs clenching and quivering as Harry sucked him off, made him feel desperate.
He wasn’t sure what he was doing. He didn’t know what this was. What he knew was that it felt like wading into the Black Lake, the water climbing higher, caressing and pulling, shifting his body weight in some decadent deception of gravity. He knew he wanted to keep walking —farther, deeper— to let the water close over his head and be lost to it.
Malfoy was still thrusting his cock along the cleft of Harry’s arse, a trail of sparks back and forth, up to the base of Harry’s balls, and every slide of their bodies bought Malfoy’s slim, soft lower belly rubbing against his own cock, flushed and hard and deliciously caught between them. Harry was going to come soon. It was too heated, too wet and hard, too perfect to last much longer.
A few strokes and Malfoy’s hips were jerking into his with every movement. Malfoy was making little noises, groans and exhalations, every bit of reticence gone. Harry felt crazy, undone. He wanted to swallow Malfoy whole.
“Yes, I know what you mean.” Draco clears his throat. “My father died recently, too. Just over two years ago. It’s been very hard on my mother.”
Carys shrugs. “That’s Iwan’s dream, and good on him. I’ve got my own work, and I do it here at the cottage.”
“So,” Weasley says, after a moment, and when most of his first helping is gone, “what is it you’re after again, Malfoy?”
Sometimes he looks at himself in the mirror, naked, after a shower or when he’s just taken off his black wool uniform. He looks at the faded pink lines across his chest and torso, so faint and thin and almost invisible, like spider webs. Potter will trace them with the pads of his fingers, some nights. His lips following gently, his face hidden in Draco’s skin like he can’t stand the guilt of having put them there.
The light is tricky in his room at night; the candles make shadows bend and shift across Regulus’s face. But Draco thinks he sees a sheen of moisture around the older man’s eyes.
Granger pulls in a sharp breath. Her eyes are sort of watery; Draco very much hopes she’s not about to cry. “No,” she says. “No, that’s not a bad thing.” She smiles back at him. Draco doesn’t know what to do with himself.
“Stop mothering me. You are so bossy.” His tone lacks all bite, and Granger smiles at him. She's been extra annoying since he sat her down and apologized for the things he'd done at Hogwarts. For the things he hadn't done that day at the Manor. “I’ll be fine,” he assures her.
Luna rips off the bottom of her shirt to wipe the blood away from her upper arm and then aims her wand at the wound. The skin knits itself back together slowly.
“We’ll begin with my parents’ annual Yule dinner party,” is all he tells Potter when he returns to the flat. “You’ll need dress robes.”
The impossible separation of a moment from its swiftly moving current. A bubble outside of time, and Draco inside it with him.
Harry thinks about Malfoy, city after city in country after country, tracking down Death Eaters with him. Running out ahead of all his ghosts, turning to greet them all over again as his due. Harry thinks about Malfoy's eyes under a cloud of fairy lights that night in Warsaw.
And then their lips are sliding together and Harry’s mouth is hot and slick. Harry’s hands move down to Draco’s sides and hold on. His hips press up into Draco, and
Draco shakes his head. “I do as the king commands, and the king doesn’t care what I want. Not really.”
“She’s in Italy. Moved there as soon as Voldemort returned, and never came back. She’s never coming back, I don’t think. No, it was someone else, someone very important to him.” Draco looks up at Potter now, and meets his eyes. “But it isn’t my story to tell. You understand?”
He shut his eyes. He leaned in. And when he opened them again, they were so close to each other. So close, and Malfoy’s breath brushed like a damp fog against his face. The way Malfoy was leaning, legs bent and back flat against the bricks, made them nearly the same height. Made it easy, so easy, to lean in just a little bit further, and slide his lips across Malfoy’s.
Draco turns from the tower window where he’s been observing a sword lesson below. Harry stands in the doorway.
“You’re selling more than one?” He’s not sure why this surprises him so much. Potter just raises his eyebrows, and Draco hurries on. “The tea cosy.”
It was raining that afternoon. He’d ducked into the tea shop because it looked so inviting, lit up with soft lamps on the tables and a chalkboard advertising the house-blended earl grey, and because he’d forgotten his umbrella and didn’t want to risk doing magic in Muggle London. He began to suspect it wasn’t strictly a Muggle tea shop, though, as soon as he spotted the tawny brown owl perched on a lovely wooden stand in the corner, and his suspicion was rather strongly confirmed when the young man waiting at the counter turned, and it was Malfoy looking back at him.
Potter smiles, and the Italians begin to relax and smile back, because he is charming and because he is Harry Potter, and Draco can’t think of anyone he’d rather see. Here, now. Anywhere, anytime. Forever.
Guido inclines his head slightly, and ushers Draco into the large foyer. Lucius hated the way the Zabini elves never bowed and scraped. Their full sets of clothing and their apartments in one wing of the ground floor, and most of all the ease between them and the family.
“It is,” Draco agrees. He looks at the streaks of paint and washes of color in front of him while Dean finishes his doughnut and picks his paintbrush up again.
, comes back before lunchtime, and the rest of the day, hour after hour, Harry feels lighter and lighter.
“Yes, ma’am. Carys Rhees?” When she nods, he reaches into his breast pocket for his badge, and holds it out. “Malfoy. I’m here to support the investigation into yesterday's dragon maiming.”
Harry stood up. “Because insulting me is the most fun you get up to anymore. Kind of like the old days.”
. “Keep your ears open. That’s the best thing you can do for me tonight. I’m going to have to talk their damn ears off as punishment for not mingling among them in so long. I need your ear.”
“I saw him walk in, but Millicent grabbed him and took him back toward the kitchens.” Potter looks confused. “They haven’t been back since.”
“Draco,” Harry whispers, and Draco turns his face just a fraction, so Harry’s breath can spill into his ear, so Harry’s voice can shiver up his spine and lodge in his chest. His lips drag along Harry’s cheek, up into the wisps of hair at his temple.
“I think he feels that my abilities don’t live up to my hype.” Potter says it drily. He taps the butt of his cigarette against the chipped concrete of the step by his boot until the smolder is completely out. “I didn’t want the hype to begin with, you know. You probably don’t believe that.”
“We’ll fix it,” Malfoy interrupted. Harry stared at him. When he looked back again, Dulcinea had retreated to the storeroom.
Pansy turns around as Greg takes another enormous mouthful and searches for a quill. “Draco, you can’t be serious. That might be the most ghastly thing I’ve ever laid my eyes on.” She comes over to stand beside him, her shoulder bumping his, and they stare at the picture in front of them.
Sometimes Harry dreams of the forest. Of moss soft and slick under his fingertips and the smell of pine, the chilled air lying crisp and sharp across his tongue. He is never afraid in the forest. In the forest, he can feel the movement of his own blood through his body, to every extremity and all the bits of him in between. He is aware of his lungs expanding and contracting inside his chest, that magical exchange of air pulled in and out of himself, the bellows of his voice and the taste of the world all around him.
The ghost of Draco Malfoy floated lightly around the room, peering into picture frames and wiping at some crumbs of toast with his pale, silvery hand. None of the crumbs moved from their place on the wooden table. “Why are any of us anywhere?”
The ghost of Malfoy blinked, and looked around as though he’d been deep in thought, or reading a book for a long while, and was just coming back to himself.
“It took me awhile, but I came across some very interesting case studies of witches and wizards in isolation for a considerable period of time—for various reasons, from political prisoners, to abuse, to regular incarceration…and even a religiously-motivated, self-imposed isolation. Anyway, under certain conditions, and to varying degrees, isolated magical subjects actually projected their consciousness elsewhere, beyond the physical space of their confinement.”
No one trusted Malfoy here, and no one wanted to work with him, but he showed up every day, and Harry
“And— it was made to look Muggle,” Granger appears rattled for the first time. “This was a Muggle bomb, and Muggle methods, made to look as if it were targeting a Society whose entire purpose is to preserve traditional wizarding history.”
“That I’m more than the Harry Potter that gets talked about in the papers, or whispered about in the Ministry. I— I hope I help you remember, too.”
ingredient in all kinds of things: beauty products, industrial solvents, transferring images on paper. We even produce it naturally, in our bodies. Wizards have other potions for the same uses, though.”
“Remember when you walked over to the kitchen window with that great, long beard of bees and the kids went crazy?” Ginny asks.
Harry watched as Rose sat herself down into her mother’s lap, still studying the paper dragon. Hermione looked surprised, but pleased.
Malfoy disappeared into the bathroom, and called out, “I can touch every wall in here just by putting my arm out. Potter, you live in a literal cupboard.”
“No,” Draco says. “And I hope it’s not too terribly crass of me, but rest assured I’ve got the money to spare. Think of it as a gift.”
“She’ll never leave him for you,” Draco continues. “Especially now that she knows what you are. And Iwan still has the girl, doesn’t he?”
“I’ve blocked you out for tomorrow, too,” Robards says with a little smile, and leaves before Draco can lodge any more complaints.
“Is it clear?” Blaise asks. “I’m not so sure. Anyway, you’re Harry fucking Potter. Since when do you do anything the easy way?”
Charlie is waiting for them when they get to the sanctuary. “Been waiting to do this until you two arrived,” he says, beaming. “Wait here.”
“That’s fine,” he calls back. “Don’t let me interrupt the work of the masterpiece. I can entertain myself.”
Malfoy is very much awake, and very red-faced, staring at him across the pillows. Luna is sitting cross-ways between them, her head resting on Harry's stomach and her legs draped over Draco. She is eating croissants and dripping honey down onto the bed.
Harry leaned in and cut off whatever words Draco had been about to say. It was so quiet suddenly, with his mouth pressed to Draco’s suddenly still lips, and after a moment, Draco let out the breath he'd been holding, a hot rush of their breaths mingling together. Draco tasted like spearmint and spice, and his lips were softer than they looked when they were underneath Harry’s.
Except that Draco isn’t returning his owls, or floo-calls. An entire week goes by. Blaise comes over at the weekend and pours them both two full glasses of firewhiskey, unasked.
“And living with him in the meantime,” adds Granger. She’s firm again, all plan and logic. “You’ll be partners, and no one outside this room will know exactly what you’re doing, or where you are, Harry.”
Pansy and Blaise are already sitting in their usual booth when he arrives. They’ve met every other Thursday evening at The Dragon’s Flagon since they left Hogwarts; his friends are some of the few links he’s kept to who he used to be, and so they know him in a way other people never will.
It's been a long time since he's mistaken Draco Malfoy for evil; this Malfoy, his Covert Special Operations partner, is precise and controlled and politely, correctly cold to almost everyone. His mask rarely slips. Sometimes Harry thinks Malfoy would prefer to be a machine, but if you know him well enough—if you watch him very closely, for a very long time—you can see his seams. That night, that moment, something about his eyes, wide and drinking in the shadow and the glow inside it—it starts something growing in Harry, something at the base of his throat that keeps expanding. A sense of something worth wanting.
“I’ll have to remember them,” Potter’s voice is much closer and Draco startles, just a little. “We haven’t had much practice at that.”
“I wouldn’t place any bets on that,” Malfoy said, and it took Harry a second to realize he was talking to Neville, because his eyes were still on Rose. He picked up a little folded-paper dragon from near his inkwell. It had been sitting there for ages; Harry had pulled it out of the Christmas cracker he’d picked this time last year, at the Leaky after their shift had ended. He’d solemnly, and a little drunkenly, given it to Malfoy, saying it was clearly meant for him.
“It’s new. A man called Iwan Rhees got it approved a little over a year ago, and they’ve been slowly adding dragons since. They’ve reported some minor damage the past few months— a portion of the perimeter wall blasted in, some graffiti, a little petty theft.”
Harry noticed. He had learned them, like a map unscrolling under his skin. Learned the angle Draco’s jaw made when he was holding himself tightly reined in; knew from the clipping of his consonants when he was truly angry or just annoyed; could read by the speed of his movements when he was uncomfortable or in pain. All this knowledge hoarded and unspooling within him— Draco had slipped under
“He’ll never be a tourney knight, I grant you. But he’s scrappy and persistent, and damn good with a blade. Harry will make a fine, useful knight.”
“Fuck. Potter.” His eyes were open again, and his mouth too, his bottom lip falling open in a soft O. Harry pulled back, sucking gently, then took him into his mouth again, Further, more. Every slide in and out again felt easier and better and Malfoy’s gasps made him want to find a better angle, the perfect pressure to undo him completely.
Harry visits Ron at the joke shop and they try out George's newest inventions together. Harry always leaves covered in questionable substances, his stomach aching from laughing too hard.
“Exactly.” Granger turns away from the poor beast in front of them slowly, like it pains her. “And that’s why we’re here.”
He waits on the dune until the top of the lighthouse flares into life, the long reach of the mirrored fire blinking and circling its way across the bay, out to where the ocean hides its face.
"There's a nest of Nargles in the bathtub," Luna says in an offhand voice, and Malfoy throws back the rest of his drink. Harry watches the curve of his throat as he swallows and the twist of his wrist as he sets the glass back down on the sink. There is a faint mark left behind where Malfoy's mouth had pressed.
“Well,” Pansy says from behind him. “Let’s think of this as a narrow escape from decor disaster, and you can take me to lunch now. There’s a little French place around the corner.”
There’s a stoop, made of stone and looking out on a little patch of overgrown garden between the row of houses Potter’s home is part of, and another directly behind them. He sits down beside Potter, who lights up a cigarette. The tobacco is from one of the wizard places in Diagon— he recognises the scent of vanilla and clove of that particular blend.
The ghost of Draco Malfoy shifted in the armchair, and his long, pale fingers began to fidget against the green velvet upholstery. “I went to Azkaban, and then…I don’t know.”
It's summer in Poland and Malfoy is beside him. They'd been working opposite sides of the crowd and somehow drifted together again toward the back. Their mark isn't here, anyway. Harry could call this tail off now—or at least send Malfoy back, as there's clearly no need for both of them to waste the night here—but he doesn't. Malfoy has taken off the hat he'd been wearing in a concession to the heat coming off the crowd, and the glow of the fairy lights catches against the gold of his hair, his jaw a dark, angular outline like another piece of rubble.
“Uh-huh,” Harry murmured again. “That sounds really frustrating, Hermione. Hey, have you heard anything about Malfoy from the Ministry?”
Harry turns on the lamp against the growing darkness and sets the portrait on the nightstand. The cuts on his face are thin pink lines now; they'll be gone by morning. Snape stares back at him.
Draco shrugs. “Pansy came up with it. She fell in love with Muggle records, and got herself a player, but she’s got a magical apartment and there are no outlets. Pansy’s always been really excellent at Charms. It was her only ‘O,’” he finishes with a smile.
Draco is startled when Harry leans across his desk and traces a thumb along his cheekbone and down along his jaw. Everything about Harry is so warm—his eyes, his words, his touch.
They continue to stand and look at the bed. Draco wonders if they will perhaps stand here all night, neither willing to make the first move. But as usual, Potter proves to be the braver of them, and pulls back the blankets.
Narcissa looks away from Potter and meets his eyes. “Draco, my darling— did you really think I would ever allow anyone into our home again if I was not absolutely sure who they were?”
“Come in,” a woman calls, and he pushes open the bottom half of the door. As he’s latching it behind him, the woman comes in briskly from another room off the kitchen, wiping her hands on a large homespun apron. “What can I make for—oh.” She stops, her hands still tangled in the apron. “Are you an Auror?”
Greg comes close, squinting, and writes down the listing number. He smells like Doritos and sticky lemon-lime fizz.
Blaise is resting his chin in one hand, looking back and forth between them. “Listen to your mates, Draco,” he adds, and drains the rest of his drink.
Harry leans forward and rests his elbows on his knees. He looks at the portrait of Snape, at the tiny hairline cracks around the canvas's edges and the parts where the brushstrokes show. The real Snape is dead. Portrait Snape is just an echo, a miraculous facsimile, a dead man's voice left behind to sound an alarum. Harry has become a good listener.
In the end, there’s only one thing Draco knows for sure: this new world had no place for Lucius Malfoy in it, and Lucius had neither the experience nor the will to adapt within it. Anything after that, whether it was his heart or his own hand that killed him in the end, was simply a question of dosage.
Just as Draco is about to move away, Harry lifts his own hands and pulls Draco down toward him by the upper arms and shoulders. He cradles Draco’s jaw and brings their faces close together.
“Maybe I fucked up,” Harry says. He traces the grooves in the wood of his table, long-ago slips of a knife and burns from hot pans.
It’s a haze, a trance almost. Draco feels lost in it himself, in what he’s making Potter feel and sound like.
“That’s— I do see what you’re saying, Malfoy, and I do believe you, actually.” She pauses, glancing over at Weasley, who is watching the exchange closely. “But the intention doesn’t matter, if the effect is still the same. And I am not at all convinced that this Muggle Mania benefits any Muggle themselves. If this acquiring of Muggle goods and art only benefits pure-blood wizards, isn’t it just the same old one-way relationship, where wizards take and don’t even consider the needs or wants of the culture they’re taking from?”
“I’m engaged, actually.” His smile faded. “One of those contracted arrangements. Astoria Greengrass.”
“I know the gossip rags aren’t the best way for it to get out, and I’d rather have told my family myself first, but—“ The words die in Harry’s throat. Draco has put a hand over his mouth, and his silence feels very ominous all of a sudden. Harry still can’t see his face.
of this. Draco,” Granger insists, and he stops and turns to look at her. She’s never used his first name, not in the whole time they’ve worked together.
Draco recognises it because it looks like the expression of that woman in the photograph, and maybe Draco isn’t alone in feeling like there are only the two of them in this moment.
“Watch yourself,” one warns them, voice low and slow. Granger leans forward first, and her knuckles tighten around the frame of the little window at what she sees.
“No.” Blaise drops the slight sense of constant deflection he usually has about him. It was only after knowing Blaise for a long time that he had come to understand how seldom anyone sees him completely serious. “Not then, and not now. I don’t begrudge any bit of happiness between my friends.”
“Why are you selling it?” Potter just looks at him; Draco wonders if this is an interrogation technique they teach their Aurors. He notes, with no small amount of dismay, that it’s working on him. “Look, I collect them, alright? I told you, it’s one of a kind.”
Harry didn’t sit in the parlour that night like he usually did. He told himself he just needed a change of scenery. He was waiting for the kettle to boil and studying a crack in one of the plaster walls when a voice said, “The state of this kitchen is enough to put a wizard off his meal.”
Draco swallowed. His chest rose and fell too quickly, his breath too fast to be entirely calm. He started to raise his hand, reached out toward the Snape painted into the heavy canvas and running on magic now rather than blood and pumping chambers of the heart. He let it drop back down to his side, though, with a new heaviness. There was no going back, not really. The flesh and the blood were gone— for Snape, and his father, too.
If anything, Potter looks more amazed than ever. “You tracked me down here at the Ministry to ask about buying my aunt’s tea cosy? Why didn’t you owl me?”
“It’s always been you, you know.” Draco’s voice is unsteady, a little damp sounding. “The question isn’t always the same, but the answer is. It’s always you.”
“I don’t know,” the ghost of Draco Malfoy said. He held his hands up in front of his face and looked at Harry through them. “But it turns out your hair is still a complete disaster, even when blurred out by ghost appendages.”
“Fuck,” Malfoy ground out. “Want your mouth. Want to see you, Potter.” He pulled at his shoulder, and Harry turned over underneath him. Malfoy let his head fall toward him, and their mouths took up the rhythm. They moved together, Harry’s legs coming up around Malfoy’s hips.
"Possibly." Harry watches him and the grip of his long fingers against the glass. "Do you want to pull out now?"
He arches his back— Potter likes that, his fingers tighten over Draco’s— and shifts his upper body. Warrington is talking about the seating arrangement for dinner now, nothing important. He moves slowly and carefully until he can turn his body around flush against Potter’s.
that Malfoy could be, when he forgot that anyone was watching him. He seemed to actually like the older Aurors he was partnered with, in a quiet, reserved way. In fact, almost everything about Malfoy was reserved these days. Gone was the pointy, dramatic boy who basked and courted attention, replaced with a pointy, prickly man who seemed actively wary of it.
The yard is dirt and sweat and men striving against each other with their blades. Up in the tower, it is quiet and calm. Draco watches, and he’s alone.
Draco's long fingers stop moving on the tabletop. “You didn’t… leave the Aurors because of the papers? Because of me?”
After, Draco starts to feel cold. Doubt starts creeping in and he doesn’t know what to do with his body. But Harry wraps an arm around his shoulders and a hand around the back of his neck.
It’s almost completely dark when the ghost comes. It starts with a pulse of pale light in the corner, by the bare, craggy rose bush. As he watches, it seems to shake itself into existence, a pulse and a sputter and now a human shape. It floats around the broken pieces of lawn furniture and discarded garden tools, seemingly without purpose or direction. Finally, it seems to notice Draco, and it comes a little closer, facing him.
“I didn’t know, either, until maybe twenty minutes ago.” He hands Dean one of the coffees and a doughnut.
Draco waits, eyebrows raised, but Blaise looks away, watches the wall of Muggle photographs in all their stillness.
“All I know is that I was in my cell, and then I wasn’t anymore.” There is a strangely weighted silence, as if more words waited on the tip of Malfoy’s tongue, but were swallowed down instead.
Draco considers. “Use Sayre. There are several branches of that family, and most of them are in Ireland and terribly difficult to keep straight. No one will find it odd if you say you went to school in the Americas, either. Lots of them do.”
Potter comes in about an hour later, already shucking off his boots. He looks surprised to see Malfoy there waiting.
Harry is putting on his tie in front of the trifold mirror in the hotel suite's sitting room. He slips the wide end up and then through, reflected back to himself in the larger center piece of glass, doubles of his image flanking on each smaller panel.
“Oh, yes,” Molly said. “Muggles have the same tradition, or they used to, anyway, but bees really do understand us. And we can understand them. Some have more of the touch than others.” Molly had looked at him. “You should try, Harry. You can talk to snakes, after all.”
“I’m trying to assess the likelihood of you harming the Rheeses,” says Draco, falling into step just behind him.
The spoon refused to move, no matter how Malfoy prodded at it. “I’m alive,” he said finally. “The boredom is the worst part. You get so tired of yourself. And I just don’t see the point of it. I’m not saying I did nothing wrong,” Malfoy went on hastily. “It’s just—what good is me sitting in that cell doing? How am I rectifying anything there?”
"Go," she says. "I'm fine. A soon as I've got this healed I'll swing around the back and cover the other exit. Malfoy should be coming in through the side."
“A torturous inevitability?” For a moment Harry was sure he saw Malfoy’s pale mouth curve up on both ends, but perhaps it was a trick of the light.
“You know better,” Warrington is saying in clipped tones, “or you ought to, at least. I don’t want you seen here.”
Harry smiled back, but it hurt. Merlin, did he miss them. He missed their actual physical bodies near his own, and the taps and shoulder bumps, the hands touching his when he was being handed a cup of tea, or pressed against his arm when they were making a point. He’d never realised how many small ways of touching each other they all had between them, or how much he relied on them to feel connected to his own body.
“I didn’t ask, specifically. I probably could have put the pieces together. I’ve heard you’re good with flowers and magical remedies for gardens.”
Potter looks incredulous. “Alter it?” When Draco doesn’t respond, he continues, “There are spells to make something just a little shorter or longer, or more narrow or what have you, without shrinking the whole thing down.”
Most the guests are out doing various planned activities, and the rooms are empty and quiet. He’s just thinking about heading upstairs to see if he can spot Potter and the other riders from an upper window when he hears a scuffle and whispers from the back stairwell behind the kitchens.
had come from. He let his feet fall down to the floor with a resounding thud, and Malfoy rolled his eyes.
“Good,” says Granger briskly. “Then let’s get down to it. The building that was bombed was the Society for Magical Historical Preservation, as you all know. The Traditional Wizarding Order, a political wing of The Sacred Twenty-Eight and the party putting McLaggen up for a seat in the Wizengamot, applied for a permit to host a rally there. The rally was supposed to happen yesterday.” She pauses, and shuffles some papers in front of her. “And yet, we received an anonymous tip late last night that they didn’t plan to hold any event at all yesterday. I had some people do some digging, and the information seems to check out. They did no liaising with the staff to set anything up. No orders were placed with the usual crews for banners or refreshments. The only invitations sent were to the press who usually cover these things— there was no advance notice to the public.”
“She would have been welcome to stay here,” Malfoy says after a moment. “It was a very amicable divorce, and we always got on quite well. We just didn’t— have anything left between us, really, once Scorpius went to Hogwarts.”
Harry spun around, his spoon clattering to the floor, and there was the ghost of Draco Malfoy floating through the doorframe and into the kitchen of Grimmauld Place.
It occurs to him in stages that Harry Potter is curled up against his back, with an arm lying across his waist and one of his legs between Draco’s, and that he doesn’t need to run away from it this morning. He lies still for a long time, as the room turns from still-black to shades of blue and gray like the sea outside their window. After awhile Potter’s breathing changes subtly, and he presses his hand flat against the skin below Draco’s belly. His fingers skim and skate over Draco’s skin, and Draco breathes and grows hot with want all over again.
“Sorry to disappoint, Auror Potter. I’m sure I can make it up to you, if you’re lacking for excitement.”
They look down at the corpse lying between them. One of the dead man’s legs is bent at an odd angle and an arm is half-falling into a gutter. The sleeve has pulled down enough to reveal the dark mark.
“It’s ok,” Potter says. “It’s no secret.” He turns his head toward Draco. “I’m having trouble at work, that’s all. Just been a long couple of months. No time for balanced meals.”
“Mam’s in the kitchen,” she says. There’s a thick gap between her front teeth and a spray of freckles across the bridge of her nose. Her thick, dark hair is plaited down both sides of her head. “Through there.”
“Go see our man in Wales after you talk to McLaggen,” Warrington continues. “Tell him I have a job for him in a few days.”
She sets it on the table. “I laundered it, and sealed it up,” she says. “It works, too, if that’s a factor. I’ve had it longer than the boys have been alive, you know.”
Every other thought leaves Harry’s head as Draco pushes his cock inside him. There’s no room for anything else inside this hunger. He hears himself, whimpering and pleading, and it’s like hearing someone else. Someone who needs something very badly.
The older Aurors had accepted Malfoy now. They respected his work. Some of them, Harry thought while reading the files and watching them around the office, even liked Malfoy.
Harry helps him get both their shirts off, and then Harry’s pants, and Draco runs his hands over Harry’s body—arms first, then down Harry’s sides, and then Draco sits back and touches Harry’s shins and the smooth skin behind his knees. Draco rubs Harry’s thighs and then finally he takes Harry’s cock into his hand and Harry gasps. Draco stops feeling awkward when he watches Harry’s face. The way his jaw drops and then tightens. The way his fingers curl and his hands grasp out at nothing beside him. Harry makes sounds Draco has never heard before, and Draco strokes and pulls and loses pieces of himself along the way, small prides and fears that kept him from ever showing anyone the face Harry can’t seem to get enough of.
"No,” Potter says, looking around them and running a hand through his hair. “No, I’m selling it for her. Why do you want it?”
After supper— a slightly dry roast that they all smother in gravy— Dudley and Potter go off to look at a crack in the upstairs plaster, and Petunia brings a pot of tea over when she’s cleared the dinner dishes. Potter had told him on the way over that the death of his uncle had lifted some kind of dark cloud over Petunia. That instead of being devastated, she’d seemed strangely relieved, and had reached out to him.
He cleared his throat in the silence. “Don’t get too used to this, Potter,” he’d said. His voice sounded strange to his ears. “I might not always be around to get your back.”
“He’d been recruited by the Order by then. He was a crack flier, Iwan was. Coulda played professional Quidditch, if he cared about anything but the flying part. He did a lot of surveillance for us. Completely secret, of course. I think his cover was that he’d moved to America for school. He was away from here, from his family, for a good while. And then they all died, except his wife, and he couldn’t even come home until after it was all done with.”
The bar is a dive, dirty and overcrowded, but it was only two blocks from his flat and it stocks Firewhisky. He sits at the bar, and the glasses pile up beside him.
“Did you enjoy that, Potter? Seeing me there?” Potter just looks at him. Potter used to look at Draco a lot when they were at Hogwarts, but he hasn’t looked at Draco much at all since then. “Did you like having all your worst suspicions confirmed?”
Regulus turns away towards the window. Draco watches him absently. He rubs at his chest, catches himself, and takes his hand away. He aches, everywhere. He feels hollow, like a bell. When he opens his mouth, he expects to hear its mournful pealing. Instead, it’s just his voice—just Draco as usual, watchful and alone.
Pansy beams. “About four o’clock. See you then.” She strides off toward what Draco assumes are the kitchens, blithely unaware she’s just invited Harry Potter on a hippogriff ride. Draco shakes his head; sometimes the world truly astounds him.
the fondness in her expression. “He’s a good one.” She turns and holds something out to him. “I’ve got something for you,”
what he wanted. He’d thought it was to acquire everything he now had: a job with the Aurors, his friends, Ginny, Voldemort dead, and hardly anyone trying to kill him. Now he had all those things, and he still didn’t feel any different. He still felt like he was waiting: for the other shoe to drop, for something to click into place and make him feel like he belonged there, for everyone to realize he had no idea what he was doing.
after this. Most dragons with injuries like this that survive the healing have to be put down later, anyway. The skin heals over but something inside doesn’t. They get sad, and then mean. Go out of their way to hurt things. People, animals, doesn’t matter. They get too dangerous to keep alive.”
It’s a bright, crisp day, winter just beginning to fall hard on London, and Draco always enjoys watching the crowds that gather on train platforms. Today, he gets to watch Potter, too; from the corner of his eye, when Potter turns his head— any chance he gets, really. Potter looks more relaxed out among Muggles, and Draco supposes it has something to do with being so recognisable in Wizarding Britain. It’s something he can understand, albeit on the opposite side of the coin. Potter will always be The Boy Who Lived and The Boy Who Killed Voldemort, no matter what he does with the rest of his life. And Draco will always be the son of Lucius Malfoy and the boy who let the Death Eaters into Hogwarts, no matter how he tries to redeem himself. Their names don’t even belong to them, in a way; they're just symbols, just strangely similar conjurings for good and for evil.
Somewhere around the year mark of sleeping together, Potter caught a rare hex during a fight with a wizard he was trying to arrest. It was an ingenious little bit of dark magic, as slippery as it was strong. By the time the Healers at St. Mungo’s figured out what they were dealing with, and how to stop it, the curse had run in increasingly complex lines of damage under Potter’s skin, rupturing blood vessels and tearing through muscle and skin in intersecting lines all over his torso. A blood-red web of wreckage. The Healers repaired all the internal damage, across a tense three days, but the scarring along the outer layer of skin, particularly right across Potter’s chest, remained.
The tips of Malfoy’s fingers dug into his scalp. “Here you are, Potter,” Malfoy whispered down to him. “You’re right here.”
The ends of Potter’s mouth twitch up into a small smile. “Understatement,” he says. “Anyway, have a seat. I just got here myself, actually, so I picked up a pizza. Sorry, best I could do.” He slides a big, flat box onto the table, and nods at a seat.
Harry decides that was when it started, even though he knows that beginnings don't actually happen that way—not all at once, not in self-contained moments rising up like monuments to mark
“We’re not engaged,” Harry said automatically. “I don’t even know for sure that we’re getting back together.”
“Did you make this, Harry?” Weasley has a big aluminium casserole in his hands, and he leans over to smell it as he brings it over to the table.
Friday nights in the Chudley Cannons’ stadium, Butterbeer on tap and salted chips served in paper cones.
“That’s got nothing to do—“ Weasley is getting red in the face. “This is about trust, Malfoy, not that you—“
it. A tiny noise— just a rush of air, really— comes from Potter behind him. Draco’s breath is coming quick and shallow now, foaming hot little clouds between his face and the wooden panels. Maybe it’s the complete blackness inside this space, maybe it’s the thrill of being hidden but discoverable, but Draco feels wild with it— with how badly he wants this.
And then the ghost of Malfoy trailed away, out the door and down the hall. When—several long, stunned moments later—Harry went to have a look, the hall was empty.
“You’re a target now,” Regulus insists. “You’re in more danger than you’ve ever been, and it will only grow as word spreads throughout the kingdom.”
Snape inclined his head. “An echo,” he offered. “I think what you’re seeking is just beyond the question of Lucius’s intent. What can this echo give you, Draco?”
“Yeah. I had to go in for work stuff.” Potter looks kind of dismal for a moment, then switches gears. “So, about this tea cosy. You really want to buy it?”
“I’m back,” says Draco. He sets the bags down on the table and takes off his coat. He lays the key beside it. “I let myself in.”
The point is, Harry has never had trouble with variety during his solo sexual excursions. But ever since that day at Hogwarts, when he’d looked into the Mirror again, all he’s been able to think about, no matter what images and fantasies he tries to conjure late at night in his bed, or in his morning shower, is Malfoy. Malfoy’s long fingers around his cock. Malfoy’s pale hair falling into his eyes and the high spots of color in his cheeks. Malfoy behind him, pounding into him. Malfoy pushing him further, holding him down by the scruff of the neck. Harry out of control, and the buzzing, burning relief of that.
Tears begin to slide soundlessly down her cheeks. “He’s going to know,” she whispers. “He’ll know I gave him away.”
their last night together, until Malfoy had gone still on top of him. Harry was face down on his bed, and Malfoy was sitting across his thighs.
“That’s it,” Draco tells Harry. “The meat we saved and three months of grain if we ration it hard. That’s all we have. I’m not sure it’s enough.”
The Gryffindor knights clatter in their ceremonial armor as they cross the cobblestones, and then the prince removes his helmet. Pansy goes very still and Regulus makes a sound of surprise just behind him.
“God,” said Harry. “Yes.” Malfoy moved against him, rubbing, hitting spots Harry hadn’t even thought about before this thing started. His own cock was being ground into the soft flannel of his sheets. He wished Malfoy would wrap his fingers around him. He wished Malfoy would never stop. “Good,” he murmured. “So good.” This was a fever dream, all heat and heaviness and unreality.
“I’m sorry it didn’t seem like I was listening to you,” Harry says, and Draco pauses in the middle of removing his coat. “This place looked a lot nicer on the brochure, but it’s my fault for not checking it out. I was just so busy at work. That’s no excuse, I know, but—“
That particularly curvy secretary over in Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, and what might have happened if the lift had stopped one day, and they’d been trapped inside, alone together, for hours.
Potter’s sheets are a strange rust color, as if an orange had been set on fire and the fire had been put out with dirt. They’re rough, too, cheap and fraying like Potter can’t afford to replace them, which is stupid. Potter could buy a closet full of silk sheets and not be skint. It’s just one of his weird quirks, more annoying than it logically should be.
“Home,” Harry said, and Malfoy’s face did a strange thing; it went kind of soft, around his eyes and along the line of his jaw. It was just for a moment, and then Malfoy pulled together the glossy shell that defined him to the rest of world since the War.
“Oh,” says the man, looking up. He seems familiar, but Draco can’t quite place him. “Malfoy. I’ve got orders you’re to go straight through.” He waves over his shoulder at the little hall behind him, and turns again to the witch beside Draco. “I’ve told you already, Midgen, no one’s getting in to the Minister without an appointment. Not today, not tomorrow, not the day after that, so don’t start with—“
Draco nods. He doesn’t ask why, or mention the tea cosy. It feels like some sort of gift, and Draco takes it.
“Invigorating,” Man-Bun says. “A shock to your senses, waking you up to the potential of a new day.”
“Relationships do not alarm me.” He pushes his tumbler back and forth, one hand to the other. “This is just— you are completely off base, Pansy.”
Draco looks at the canvas Dean is working on. It’s a large one today, washed in deep browns and soft golds. “Painting going well?”
Then Malfoy is beside him, and Malfoy's hand comes up to rest lightly against the back of Harry's. Malfoy presses two gentle fingers to the space between the delicate bones of Harry's wrist. Malfoy waits. Harry's blood pulses rhythmically against Malfoy's fingertips and he becomes aware of it circling through his entire body. He becomes aware of his body again, and he loosens his grip on Dolohov's throat. Dolohov sinks to his knees on the floor, wheezing, and Malfoy stuns and binds him, all with his fingers never leaving Harry's pulse point.
“Should go back to sleep,” Potter mumbles into his shoulder. His breath is very warm, even through the cotton of the t-shirt he borrowed. “S’not time to be up yet.”
“I know what you mean,” says Harry. “It was kind of like that for me and Ginny. Hermione says it’s a fifty-fifty when your kids are all off and it’s only the two of you left. Finding each other just between the two of you, and whether there’s enough left to keep it going the next half of your life.”
Potter was a boy he knew a long time ago, a boy he envied and hated and could never ignore. Potter was a teenager he resented and admired, grudging in equal measure. Now Potter is a man Draco doesn’t know at all— an Auror and a hero and something else behind that. And what connects this Potter and the ones he’d known at school is Draco’s continued, unwilling fascination; not with the hero or the boy who lived, but with the something behind them.
, and then Malfoy’s fingers tightened on him again, and pulled, and he came so hard he made no sound at all.
was that?” He turns to see Potter striding into the room, looking livid. His eyes scan the cuts, the blood soaked into Draco’s shirt. “Look at yourself. Why would you do that?”
“Oh,” Potter says. He tries to brush down the front hem of his uniform, but it stays a little crooked. “Right. Which item?”
He knows exactly when Potter arrives; there’s just something about him still, something that draws the eye and holds it. He’s still pulling his red Auror uniform on over his left shoulder when he turns from the Floo, looking down to fasten the buttons across his chest as he strides closer to where Draco is waiting. Draco’s often seen his picture in the papers over the years. But as Potter draws closer, he finds himself almost overwhelmed by a strange feeling of vertigo, memory mixing with the present in a way Draco is usually careful not to allow.
“I’d have thought that was obvious,” Potter says. He still hasn’t put his shirt back on and his hair is a mess. He smiles at Draco, like it’s the easiest thing in the world.
“I don’t know.” Draco leans forward, the sofa creaking ominously underneath them, and brushes his thumb over Harry’s bottom lip. “I just worry, I guess.”
Harry draws back slowly and he’s looking at Draco strangely. Draco isn’t sure why until Harry takes one of Draco’s hands—hovering, fingers outstretched, down by his left hip—and then the other—clenched ineffectually around Harry’s belt—and moves them up between their bodies. Harry puts one of Draco’s hands against his throat. “I’m vulnerable here”—he moves Draco’s other hand until his palm rests just against Harry’s nose—“and here.”
He knows exactly where they’ll end up when night drops its heavy curtain down on London. After Kingsley tells them all to go home and get some sleep.
After fussing with his glasses, and where his wand was going to lie on the nightstand, and after Draco has used the bathroom himself and returned, there is nothing else to distract them; they stand on opposite sides of the double bed, looking at each other. A strange, excruciating detente.
“Commander Black asked me to escort you back before it gets dark,” Harry says. The afternoon has slipped away, and the families from beyond the gates are heading home with their share of meat.
The next morning, Harry knocks on the front door of Malfoy Manor. An older house elf, wearing a cravat and bowtie, shows him into a small parlor, where Narcissa is waiting.
“It is,” he said, and pulled her into a quick hug. And it really was, he realized. The happiest he could remember.
Draco searches for it, but he can’t find a barb in Potter’s tone. So he just says, “I suppose that’s true,” and follows Potter to the kitchen.
Harry watched as Rose finally got her legs up under her on the chair she’d been trying to climb. It was directly in front of Malfoy’s desk, and she leaned over until her top half was lying across its surface. She stretched an arm out toward him, and he carefully put out his own, palm up. Rose dropped the piece of shiny paper into his hand.
“What do you mean?” Draco’s face feels hot and tingly, his tongue loose. Perhaps he should have gone a little easier on the bourbon. “That’s preposterous. The thing with Potter is just sex. It’s just a casual sex arrangement.“
“I always hear yours,” he finishes, and Potter’s smile warms him from the inside out. “I’m sorry. Harry—“
“So good,” Potter keeps whispering, and he’s making breathy moans in time with the rhythm Draco sets up. His hands tighten in Draco’s hair and his forearms are tense, tightly controlled like he’s holding himself back. Like he might lose himself entirely in Draco’s mouth. In Draco.
Weasley shakes his head, a smile breaking out on his face. “Not officially yet— he’s new, and there’s been so much going on we haven’t gotten round to it yet. But I’ve been calling him Phoenix.”
“But.” A pause of a heartbeat. “Foxglove treats atrial fibrillation by slowing the heart, which is why it is also one of the first choices a witch or wizard turns to when they wish to stop one altogether. So unless they found the potion he was using, it’s impossible to determine if it was intended to help him or kill him.”
Draco carefully slides out from under the arm and walks silently to the bathroom. The stone is cold beneath his feet and when he opens the small, circular window above the bathtub the wind off the sea is cold, too. Draco stands in the coldness for several minutes.
At the gate he flashes his badge and the fake one they’d made up for Dudley Sayre. It was good to be Harry Potter, apparently, even when you actively were being Not-Harry Potter. Draco spots Weasley as they near the pens.
Harry is never afraid in the forest because there is nothing left there to fear. In the forest, all senses to the contrary, he is already and always done with his dying. The miracle of his body realized only in that moment. In the forest Harry doesn't know fear, but he dreads the waking up. When he awakens after a dream of the forest he is only himself and the slinking suspicion that death has already won; that it won a long time ago surrounded by pine trees and echoes, and he's spent all the years since just refusing to admit it.
It was just one wrong turn, somewhere. A moment when his mind had wandered, when these old halls of stone and murmuring memories had lulled him into an absentminded sort of reverie, and he’d somehow ended up in a part of Hogwarts he’s never seen before.
Potter blinks and leans forward, resting his elbows on his knees. “I’d forgotten about that,” he says. “With everything that happened.”
He knew the moment she recognized him; it was an expression and surprise he was uneasily getting used to. She looked swiftly between him, still frozen just inside the door, and Malfoy, who lowered his cup and set it down on the table behind him. It rattled in its saucer.
is that damn thing?” He left the break room and started down the hall, Harry trailing behind as he went into the cloakroom.
And it is; it’s so good. Nothing this good could ever be wrong, and neither of them could be wrong together.
“But Hermione, you can’t expect me to—“ Weasley rubs his hand over his face, agitated. “And anyway, who do we know that can cozy up with some Death Eater wannabes?”
It was shaping up to be a weirdly tense Christmas. Malfoy was all sharp corners; brittle and snappish and
Draco has never been so aware of his breath. Drawing air into his lungs. Releasing it in a noisy rush. Something in Harry’s stance changes; his grip gentles and, rather than grappling, their bodies are just leaning against each other. Draco is frozen, his body a mystery to himself in this moment.
looks at her. Her hair is bobbed; the ends rest just at chin level, precise and boxy, with thick bangs covering her forehead right down to her eyebrows. It suits her in its severity; Pansy had tried vainly to be delicate and wispy for years; she looks herself these days. There are signs of strain, though, that he hadn’t noticed earlier. Her makeup is as impeccable as ever, but in the glow from the candelabra above he can see the bluish shadows ringing her eyes and the lines around her mouth where she held her lips tensed and mask-like.
He eases forward, keeping to the shadows along the wall. A quick disillusion charm and he fits himself up against the balustrade. Warrington is standing on the landing just above, talking to someone Draco can’t quite see.
“I was very surprised to read of your resignation from the Aurors, Mr. Potter,” Narcissa interrupts.
Hermione frowned and looked disapproving, but removed her hands from her daughter's ears. Rosie tottered off, reaching up carefully on her tiptoes to pull at a piece of silver wrapping paper on top of Harry’s desk. He nudged it toward her until she wrapped her small, dimpled fist around it. She started off again, and Ron continued, “Anyway, let’s just say Ernie thought his girlfriend might like something trunk-sized on a part of his body that wasn’t his stupid face. And since it wasn’t meant for…
“I’ll find out myself, anyway,” he tells her. “I’m going home tomorrow, and when I see Pansy I’ll give her the full grilling.”
The dragon crouched into the far corner is smaller than he imagined: a juvenile. Deep garnet, sparkling scales down its back, fading into a rich russet color along its sides and into a fiery shade of bright red on the bit of belly visible. Its triangular head is tucked down against its chest, the ear flaps pressed tight to its skull and its eyes wide and darting around the holding cell.
Malfoy met his gaze for the first time since Harry had started the conversation. “Now I remember that conversations go very differently when there’s more than one person having them.”
“Let me get this straight,” says Potter. “You want me to infiltrate pureblood society, disguised as someone else, and I’ll be doing it with Malfoy?”
The company rides into view at midday. Draco climbs to the top of the battlements to watch them emerge from the forest. There are a surprisingly small number of soldiers considering their two kingdoms are about to go to war. As they ride closer Draco can make out a figure near the front wearing the red crest of Gryffindor and the traditional golden lion’s mane on his helmet. When the group slows to a stop near the river moat, Draco goes down to meet them.
Warrington’s smile grows. “Yes, I was hoping to hear about your work in the Ministry. So many of our people look askance at the Aurors, and the prospect of a career with them, but I think it’s very smart, personally.”
“Drop it?” he echoes. “How can I drop this? Tell me. How can I drop it? How can I still love someone after I’ve come to hate the very things they stand for? Still crave their approval— even as I actively shun it? To feel such
Potter finishes chewing and wipes his mouth with the back of his hand. “I put several things up for sale through Zabini’s. It’s my aunt’s stuff. She wanted to get rid of some things, and I figured with the boom in the Muggle
Now, he knocks his knuckles on the boxes. He hums to them, and the bees hum back, loud, tumultuous, like a happy dog when its owner walks in the door in the evening.
Draco sighs, and throws the folder back toward his bag. The pages spill out onto the dusty floor. “We said a lot of things. I recall promises of long baths and lying around in bed. Have you looked back in the bedroom yet? I’m not sure both of us can even fit on that mattress at the same time.”
Draco learned formal swordsmanship—a thin, neat little blade and precise, choreographed movements. He learned the kind of fighting that’s for show. Harry doesn’t fight for show. He swings a thick, heavy blade at Draco’s automatic parries and the shock of it reverberates all through Draco’s arm and shoulder and chest. With a sword in his hands, Harry is quick and brutal; he is relentless.
“Damn it, Pansy, I said I was sorry about that. You know I haven’t been getting all of my correspondence since I told my parents I was moving out.”
“He’s at the lighthouse,” Carys says after a long silence. She doesn’t look up. “He never leaves the lighthouse after sunset.”
“Yeah.” Potter sweeps the trash into a bin, then carries the teacups to the big sink on the far wall. He looks tired. “Walburga Black’s house, forever. She put a permanent sticking charm on that portrait.”
Millicent’s earrings tremble, but it’s the only sign she gives that he’s spooked her. “I understand,” she says, her lips barely moving. She straightens again. “Thank you, Draco,” she says in a normal voice.
Saturday morning, and Potter is still sleeping. He pulls on his boots and grabs his wallet off the table.
“It’s good to finally meet you, Draco,” Warrington says at breakfast. “Pansy rarely has anything nice to say about anyone, so I’m anxious to know one of the few exceptions.”
Potter snorts. “Is that all Zabini is doing these days? I haven’t seen him in years and years, and Hermione and Ron say they haven’t, either.”
“Are you going to tell me what you were saying to me in your head, before you projected your consciousness over here?”
It was true enough. James Potter had the same messy black hair, the same square jaw and pointy chin. The same way of moving his arms, a hand rubbing sheepishly against the back of his head when he looked at the camera. He supposed Potter must like that, the apparent connection, however ephemeral. Potter, who never knew his parents at all.
He’d actually volunteered to take the Christmas day shift this year. Since he and Ginny had just broken up, there was no reason not to work the holiday. He couldn’t go to the Burrow, no matter what Mrs. Weasley said in her owls. Everyone was probably tucking in to one of her amazing Christmas breakfasts right now. He tore off a corner of the scone he’d taken from the party tray still in the break room, leftover from the department holiday party. It was dried out, and the currants inside reminded him distressingly of mouse droppings. He pushed it away with a sigh.
Potter has an expression on his face that Draco can’t read, and Draco thought he had learned all of Potter’s expressions in the two weeks they’d lived together. Potter walks over and looks out his window. This close, Draco can smell the mint shampoo he prefers and feel the warmth coming off his body. It makes him think about the mornings he woke to Potter pressed against him in the bed, makes him
Draco breathes and watches Harry’s jaw flex. He rubs the back of his head and his hair stands up in small, dark spikes.
“Thank you,” she says, out of breath. He turns to look behind them. The sea is crashing in foam-crested waves onto the beach below, and down the curving coastline, about a mile away, on top of a rocky outcropping, is a white stone lighthouse.
Tom Evers bursts into motion, throwing himself across the room and flying into Draco before he can get his spell off. They crash into the paned glass behind him, and it makes a loud cracking sound. Evers is strong, full of helpless knowledge that there’s nowhere to go from here. The pane they’re leaning against shatters, and with a gust, the outside air rushes in, overwhelming and blowing out the light.
“I thought you were a smart man, Lucius,” Madam Zabini said one evening out on the terrace after dinner. “I am surprised you think it wise to parade your preference for slavery in front of me. In front of my family, and our long hall of ancestors.”
“Dead?” Hermione asked incredulously. “Of course not. As if I’d neglect to mention something like that. Anyway, that would be front page in the papers, not Ministry gossip.”
Draco sucks in an involuntary, unsteady breath. It’s hard to imagine, that Potter could see himself like that— in such a small sliver, so achingly distorted— but then maybe that’s the problem with being too close. It's hard to make out the whole of yourself.
“Are you alright?” Malfoy looked up from the spoon he’d been trying to pick up from the table. Harry had been watching him for awhile now. “I mean, in Azkaban. Are you really ok?”
Harry takes a step closer to Draco. “I went back and asked Godric to allow me the chance to work out a treaty between us. I didn’t
Snape looks back at him with the same ill-tempered face Harry had known in life, the same slow blink of complete indifference he's been doing since Harry found the small painting while cleaning out Spinner's End.
Harry runs his hand up Draco’s back and into his hair. He pulls lightly, gently, until Draco raises his head. “So touch me. Anywhere, Draco. Everywhere.”
He looks up, and Granger is looking at him. He holds her gaze. “But there are also some people, including me— and Pansy, and Blaise— who truly saw something special in Muggle things. In art and inventions and clothes. Whose intention is not to— well, fetishise or use for political points.”
He stands there, stricken. Her blue eyes looking into his, so clearly, like the sky through a window when the curtain has just been drawn aside.
At dinner, he and Potter are seated across from each other, which is normally how couples are arranged at these dinner parties. It means they can’t speak privately, but it does give him an unobstructed view of Gregory Goyle talking enthusiastically to Harry Potter about broom models, which is not a sight he ever expected to experience, let alone enjoy.
The witch touches her wand to the red dot, and the address and vectors pull off like a ribbon or bit of web now stuck to its end. She hurries over to a large basin in a corner, waving open the little locked gate that usually protects it, and drops the destination inside. A yank at the lever on the wall sends a cascade of emergency Portkeys, small rings with holes in their middles, in a line down into the basin as well.
“We have to tell the bees,” Molly had said, looking out toward the white wooden boxes in the field beyond.
“You’re so good, Potter,” he whispers unsteadily, when he trusts his voice. “You look so good like this.”
need to take the stress of all this seriously, especially after what you went through in the war, and before that, too. It might seem like staying at home is a small thing in comparison, but it’s hard to be alone. It’s hard not to know what’s going to happen. We aren’t meant to live like this. We need each other.”
The next morning, he goes back to his flat. It smells musty, unused. He spends some time practicing the cleaning charms he’d looked up while he was drying out at Dean’s, and then he goes through the paperwork he needs to take back to work with him in a few days.
“All of the subjects’ projections were tied to another person. So it turns out, although this is not actually the ghost of Draco Malfoy, he is haunting
Potter looks excited as soon as their boots hit the sand. “I’ve been wanting to come see Draig Sanctuary since it opened,” he says, following Draco up the sand dune toward the little path leading to the compound. “Never found the time. Charlie has all good things to say.”
“Goyle?” Harry asked. He’d just given a rundown of Hermione and Ron and Neville’s doings post-Hogwarts.
The sight of Harry Potter completely naked is something Draco is glad he didn’t pass up this time. His own clothes join Potter’s on the floor, and then Potter presses him down onto the blankets, crawling up over him, letting his mouth drift on Draco’s skin as he goes.
“Yeah, well, I wasn’t too good to him, when we were kids,” says Dudley, opening the pizza box to get himself a slice. “None of us were.”
They shouldn't work, but they do. After all, none of them are the same people they'd been before. There is another person behind each of them, and they—Harry, Malfoy, Luna, even Neville—have found those other people to be dangerous, and useful, and strangely complimentary.
“Quite,” says Lucius dryly. “Lady Greengrass is filling the parlour with her inimitable stream of prattle.”
was— had reached its end. In his own way, integrity was important to Malfoy, and continuing on past this point would be against his code of ethics.
“You are monumentally close to screwing this up, Draco.” Pansy is tapping her pale pink-lacquered nails against the tabletop— tap-tap-tap. “And as you are one of the few people I do not actually hate, I don’t want to see you throw away the best thing that’s happened to you since you
It’s everything Harry had hoped for, everything he’d seen as possible when he’d stood there looking at the mess of weeds and brambles and potential.
“No one has suggested otherwise, Draco. This isn’t a punishment, for God’s sake. It’s an honor. You think you’ll serve your people better by measuring out the grain and mediating their petty squabbles than by being prince of the kingdom?”
“He works our farm,” Millicent says. “I raise hippogriffs now, didn’t you hear? Granger was certainly all up my arse with inspections and such when she was still with the Magical Creatures Department. Everyone’s wanting them nowadays for riding and hunting. I like it.” She pauses to take another bite. “Greg helps me and does jobs for Cassius.”
It feels weird, unlocking the door to his flat with Potter standing behind him. He’d just carved out this space for himself, this place where only he belonged. And now he has to bring Potter here, the boy who was his childhood nemesis, the man who is his— what?
For weeks, Harry attacks the many weak spots in Draco’s sword work. He stops to move Draco’s arms into different positions and he taps the pommel of his sword against Draco’s belly to correct his posture. Draco leaves their sessions sweaty and bruised. He goes to bed sore and wakes up stiff and pained in the morning. When Harry decides his swordsmanship is better, he pivots to hand to hand combat.
Granger sighs, and rubs at her temples. “Maybe. I mean, it would make sense. I don’t know— I can’t pin down where this feeling is coming from.”
“Mine.” Harry stretches his legs out, feet knocking into the bed post. He winces. “It’s always all my fault.”
“The king is here.” He lays the king down on his chest. “And then the people”—two pawns nestle together on his belly—“are down here. The king owns the resources, so the power flows down.” Draco makes a sweeping motion down his torso. “But the king can’t make or tend all of it on his own, so the power flows upward, too. But then here”—Draco places a rook between the king piece and the pawns—“is me. I don’t
Draco watches the men train from his tower window. Marcus fidgets behind him. An order has come from the capital. Salazar commands the Malfoy forces to gather near the forest and prepare for invasion. He calls Draco to his side at court.
Draco rolled toward him, and rested his silvered head on his hand. “You sound dangerously close to some sort of declaration, Potter.”
Harry had just poured hot water in the teapot when he heard the knock at the door. He put the lid on and went to answer it.
Malfoy tensed but didn’t turn around. He started opening cupboards, and slamming them shut again when he didn’t find the donation basket. “You
Draco leans forward and takes Pansy’s hands. “We’ll both live with it, together,” he says. “And probably be happier than most.”
Lucius glances up from a book laid out on his desk. There is silver at his temples now, mingling in with the pale blonde. “Draco. To what do we owe this unexpected honor?”
This year, he’d come prepared. Roast turkey and potatoes, fat buttery carrots, Yorkshire puddings, and an enormous slice of Mrs. Weasley’s Spiced Rum cake. He pulled out a flask of butterbeer he’d brought to wash it down and looked at the new picture framed on his desk: Hermione, Ron, and an hours-old Rose. It was sort of funny, how much difference context could make. He’d been happy to take Christmas duty this year when Ron had pulled it, telling him to spend the day with his new daughter, and he was happy still.
“Potter.” Malfoy’s voice was low and breathy and he wanted to hear more of it, just like this. So he kept pushing, kept rocking back into Malfoy’s thrusts. If one of them pulled, the other pushed. It was fundamental; it was habit; it was them.
Millicent leans over toward him. “My husband seems to like your boyfriend,” she says. “Normally can’t get much out of him at these things.”
“It’s perfect.” Potter looks strangely put out, so Draco looks again. It’s definitely listing to one side.
“Right.” Potter sounds winded, too, and his shirt is rumpled. They look at each other for a long moment, and then Potter says, “I’m going to try to make a Floo call to Hermione. If I use her home address it shouldn’t set off any alarms here.”
“Thank god,” Potter whispers into his ear, and he kisses him, his tongue curling up to lick at Draco’s teeth. He pulls one of his hands away and reaches down between their bodies. When Potter’s hand wraps around his cock, Draco arches up off the bed and Potter thrusts into him, hard. Draco shouts, he thinks, but he’s beyond caring. He’s coming and Potter is coming, too, and his pleasure is loose and liquid and wordless in Draco’s ear.
“No,” says Pansy, and then more loudly, “Cassius had a business dinner, I’m afraid. But that reminds me of how you can make things up to me. We’re having a house party right after Christmas, at Cassius’s place up in Scotland. You must come, Draco.” She looks across the table and catches Potter’s eye. “And you, too, Dudley.”
Draco throws the Prophet down on his table. It’s getting dark, and he hasn’t left his flat all day. When the bell rings, he assumes it’s the Chinese he ordered.
The convenient thing about living above a bar is that he doesn’t have to go far for the next bottle of Firewhisky. In fact, since he opened a tab with the owner, all he has to do is tap his wand on the nightstand and a fresh one appears. That’s good, because after the first week Draco realized he was a little unsteady on his feet every time he tried to walk away from his permanent sprawl across the bed. Sometimes he twirls a heavy-bottomed shot glass across the scratched floorboards to see if he can get it to the opposite wall. He doesn’t bother with the glasses that get sent up with the whisky otherwise. He drinks it straight from the bottle, like any merciful god intended.
When the sun slipped away behind the skyline and Islington was dark again, Harry went into the parlour and waited.
“Yes,” Draco says. He watches the way the sun stains the sky orange even as it sinks. “Tell the gatemen they can raise the bridge.”
Harry pressed his teeth together so hard he could hear his molars grinding together. He took a deep breath, then glanced over toward where the thorn in his side was sitting— lounging, actually, the bastard— and waited for the punchline.
It’s raining, the night he stands waiting to see if Potter will show up to the meeting he requested by Owl.
Potter smirked, and Draco said, smiling a little, “Dexterous, Potter? That’s a ten-sickle word. Didn’t know you had it in you.”
He turns to face her fully, grinning, although he can barely make out her features in the dark. He knows them anyway, the way familiar things are known— irrevocably, and by heart. “What?”
“Potter?” He must already have had a few, because his face was more animated than Harry had seen it since Hogwarts, since that last terrible day, and before Malfoy had become so careful, so contained.
“A consignment. At Zabini Imports.” Potter continues to look confused. “You’re selling something there, aren’t you?”
“You know where to find him,” Greg says. Pansy looks momentarily deflated when he turns to look at her. A little far away; a little sad.
Malfoy smiles faintly. “Leave it to Granger, to still be the smartest thing around.” They step outside now, through some intricately-paned glass doors and into a riotous paradise of blooms. Pinks and reds bleeding together along one path, pale oranges and pink-tipped creamy tea roses forming a hedge on the other side.
