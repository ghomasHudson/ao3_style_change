“That’s where we’ll take a thousand pictures trying to get the perfect Christmas card to send to everyone. It’ll be family-friendly enough for my parents and strange enough for your aunt and uncle to be extremely concerned.” Draco wanted them in jail for what they’d done to Harry, but Draco wanted a lot of things.
Harry took one step, two steps, inching along the back of the room. Could he seriously make it all the way through the dining room? He’d done more dangerous stunts in this cloak, avoiding everyone from Argus Filch to Severus Snape to Draco Malfoy, all of whom knew Harry had the cloak.
Nobody could see over the ferny plants that Draco had planted and grown around the Manor, but the wide white windows still made Harry feel exposed, sun shining on his back.
“Cheers, love,” Draco said, touching their spirals together like clinking wine glasses.
“Lay down.” Draco’s voice cut through Harry’s jumbled thoughts.
“Oh, is that so?” Harry asked with a crack in his voice he hoped Draco hadn’t heard.
“Have a lovely evening, Sirs,” the gentleman wished them and Draco slipped him a hundred on the counter. Before he could thank them Draco waved Harry on, taking the receipt without looking at the total and tossing it in the bin by the door on the way out.
Should Olivia have said ‘we’ instead of ‘they’? Also, was it supposed to feel that odd that Remus and Sirius were considered her parents now?
“That was a rhetorical question,” she sighed. “Now if you’d kindly exit the lobby—“
“I’m sure they were shocked enough when you grew up and didn’t turn out awful.”
“I can get it out,” Draco assured her before pressing on to satisfy his own curiosity. “Robert, why did you think it was a good idea to swallow something that wasn’t food?”
“Fake, shmake,” Pansy waved off as if that made any sense. “It has to be convincing, doesn’t it? Come on, let’s go downstairs. I know exactly how I want the rooms set up now that I know it’s here.”
“I also lied on other bits,” Grace bragged, flipping the magazine page. “I said I was five-ten when I’m only five-six, and I greatly underestimated my weight.”
Draco watched at the foot of the bed, mystified. Every time Harry seemed to cringe away from one body part in pain, another would be affected by the ropes wrapping tighter around him. Oh, Harry was a genius for this one.
“It’s your papa that’s the rotten apple,” Draco added.
Now that went right to Draco’s head. He smiled down at Harry and pushed his hands up under his shirt so he could rid him of it. “Yeah, I am,” he replied cockily. “But you, you’re brave. You looked like you were going to take on all those Aurors at once, no wand or incantations needed to sling your spells. Fuck, that was hot.”
Lucius let out a belabored sigh, putting his hand over his face. “Is it photos?” he drawled in his deep, posh voice. “Please tell me I raised a son with enough sense not to let his dirty photos get out.”
Draco rolled his eyes as if it were obvious. “
“And does he know your favorite dessert is chocolate cake?” Lucius questioned.
“Draco,” Harry said because fuck, was that ever a beautiful name. He lightly moved his nails down Draco’s back and up to grab his hair. Draco’s hair was always neatly groomed, and Harry took the utmost pleasure in mussing it up.
“Yes,” he replied quickly, tearing off half of the pretzel for himself and scarfing it down.
“You know,” Draco pondered out loud to Ron. “I never thought of teaming up with you to make Harry constantly uncomfortable, but I’m really liking the idea now.”
“What a surprise,” Draco said flatly.
“This weekend, then, we’ll pick out a centerpiece fountain,” Draco circled back around to the start of this line of thought. “I’m eager to see what catches your eye. Is Harry Potter more of a sculpture man or an abstract sort of artist?”
Harry snorted, twirling his fork. “No, no pennants. Maybe some art, or a poster of… something. I dunno. Whatever excites me, I guess. I know I’ve said this about a thousand ways since we started this whole thing but I didn’t really get excited about much before you. I was in a haze, and not even my favorite things could pull me out of it.”
“Good to see you,” said Greg, putting his beer bottle down to wave. “Your man let you come up for air?”
Realization crept up Draco’s neck like a spider. His mouth was dry for a moment. “Kingsley.”
The waitress had been watching to see when they finished and was eager to get the two foul-mouthed boys who seemed to be playing footsie under the table out of the sight of the rest of the customers.
She didn’t need to open her eyes to see who it was. In fact, Grace was dead set on keeping them screwed shut.
Harry looked at Draco and he saw love. He felt love; he could hardly get enough of it. He loved this man, and there was nothing in the world that could change that.
“And you’ve never heard of a gay man abusing a woman? It happens.”
Draco sampled the spaghetti, humming with pleasure. “This food is. You used the recipe in the book there?”
“Would you like specific examples?”
Instead, they’d been attacking one another while straight people attacked them separately. Draco felt like he’d betrayed The Homosexual Cause for letting it happen.
They’d probably have to do it again sometime soon; the bottle was half-empty already.
“Prat,” Harry snickered against Draco’s warm, wet skin before moving his free hand up against Draco’s pink hole.
“I saved up. I skipped out on stuff. I wanted her to stay in her home.” Which was honestly creepy because her home was so close to Randy. “It was no big deal for me. I wanted to do it for her.”
Ron and Hermione knew about them, Draco’s friends knew about them, and that meant it was only a matter of time until those two worlds collided entirely. The only safe space that could happen in private was the Manor, and it was, in kinder terms than Draco would put it, unfinished.
Close behind was Draco with his camera as Harry knocked on the door.
Sirius frowned before taking the receipt off of the lavender bed. “I thought I’d gotten rid of this. Sorry.”
“Have you ever seen the dungeons that arch off of the Slytherin commonroom?” Draco asked lightly, his lips brushing up against the shell of Harry’s ear. “They’ve got the windows that let the light from the lake in, and candles down the halls…”

Maggie’s flat was in the meat-packing district, which was absolutely a ridiculous place to live. There were thousands of muggle trucks zipping by during the day, and women walking the street at night. To be fair, Pansy had seen one man in a pair of gold shorts. Equal opportunity.
“Why?” Hermione inquired.
“I don’t think that’s going to happen,” she replied coldly.
The gaggle of men gawked in silent awe. They looked like they were in their forties (maybe with children of their own) and were clearly horrified.
“I think that one looks like a parrot,” he said, nudging her arm and pointing up at a milky cloud.
Harry put the phone back on the bed with his shoulders feeling significantly lighter. “There we go.”
Mrs. Bowen used her ebony wand to lock all of the windows and doors in the house simultaneously just to be sure. She would deal with her corralled kin when she came back from a little chat with an old friend.
As completely ridiculous as it was, Harry felt rather proud of himself. He’d brought the gorgeous man on top of him to orgasm.
“No, not like that! Agh, everything I’m saying is coming out wrong. She can be a witch, I’m not my mother, but I would prefer not having to wake up to flying pillows and dancing plates,” he explained quickly.
Draco got that smile on his face again. “That would be nice, wouldn’t it? We could go room to room watching the scenes until we found our favorite. Or…” Draco turned to whisper in Harry’s ear. “Maybe we could go up and show them how it’s done.”
Draco pried his grey eyes from Harry’s faux-innocence in his green ones, as intoxicating as it was to see. He next focused on Harry’s groin, palming all around it but never quite staying long enough to satisfy. “You are such a treat. Harry Potter, trembling for me in his pretty knickers.” Draco pushed them to the side and set Harry’s cock free. “Why, I could just eat you up.”
With a smile, Harry kissed his hipbone. “Good.”
It was three against one and Lucius was really starting to feel the pressure. “At the end of the day I cannot stop you from pursuing this relationship,” Lucius had to admit.
Draco’s father’s pride returned slowly after the War Trials when their sentencing had been carried out. Potter had been their saving grace again by demanding the abolishment of Azkaban and extreme leniency in the Malfoy’s favor. Harry hadn’t gotten the former, and that seemed like a big blow to his ego or whatever, that righteous, sexy bastard—wait, what? Ugh, Draco was tired. No time to think about schoolyard rivalries, especially ones that might inappropriately excite him at work.
Harry moaned into his blankets. Pre-come dribbled down the sides of his cock, willing him to push up faster and faster into his own hand.
“I don’t see what that has to do with anything.”
“This is it,” Lily told her brother with a predatory grin. The lights from the floating candles shone down on the sorting ceremony.
Draco reached down to touch himself over his trousers, mewls and moans easing out of him as he spread his kneeling stance wider.
“Er.”
Was Draco seriously offering that? Harry leapt at a reply before Draco could change his mind. “Those are your Healer’s orders, then?”
“Fuck, I will never get tired of hearing you say that,” Draco sighed fondly. “Never.” He’d found the perfect submissive who’d been right in front of his face for his entire childhood.
“So she still hates me, huh?”
*** *** ***
“You really had some balls to do that,” Draco recalled fondly.
“Never too much,” Harry replied shakily. The feeling of Draco softening inside of him was so intimate he hoped Draco never pulled him off of his lap. Harry never wanted this moment to end, all bleary and hazy in their post-coital bliss. “Just right.”
“And you don’t?” Harry questioned, raising a brow.
“Yes,” Harry replied breathlessly. “Yes, I want whatever you can give me. I’ll take a toy for you as long as you want.”
“Touché.”
“Excellent. Then onto our second matter of business, and that will be winning this year’s House Cup.”
“One’s right to privacy over their sexual orientation and goings-on therein is something we pride ourselves on at Saint Mungo’s,” they had said, ensuring their steady stream of magical sexual mishap cases didn’t stop flowing in. “This Head Healer and intern were an anomaly.”
“It would be a lot simpler if they just revealed our relationship, that we can explain, but the nature of which this relationship came about… It’s violating, having it revealed,” Harry admitted with frustration. It was all to sell papers for that Rita Skeeter, too, a bug that Harry wished had been squashed a long time ago.
“Yes,” Harry said with an eyeroll. “I’ve never, ever had sex before. How do two blokes even have sex? I’ll need charts and diagrams. Possibly demonstrations.” He’d just been a little surprised, was all.
All of the things Dragonis had said about his father, his family life, his problems—those all belonged to Draco.
“Daddy…”
Harry was having to face the fact that he didn’t know much about London, especially his current area of the city. His muggle phone was a lifesaver, guiding him in the right direction.
“This does?” Draco teased and pressed his tongue flat to go back up the same route, taking his sweet time with it.
“Maybe,” Draco said as he tried to salvage the one promising interview of the day. “You could visit and pretend to be a family friend, or an aunt or uncle.”
“It’s for you,” Theo sighed when he saw the handwriting.
“In here, dear,” came Narcissa’s voice from down the hall, though she didn’t stay there long. The second she heard her boy’s voice she was click-clacking in her heels down the hall to get to him and embrace him in a motherly hug. She smelled of jasmine, as she always did. “Oh, look at you, so handsome.”
Harry sat back down, a little unsure of why he’d stood in the first place. “It has to do with the fact that Draco and I are put through enough in our daily lives. He gets harassed at the hospital, and I get called a ‘fairy’ by people I am
Harry clung to Draco for dear life with each pump of their hands. His robes were coated in sweat and his hair was most likely an absolute nest, but he could not have cared less. This was his orgasm, goddammit.
The case upon arriving in Arizona, however, was anything but enjoyable.
“Which is?”
Almost frantically, Harry moved his tongue to meet Draco’s and wherever they brushed together sparks flew.
“No but I mean like, really really cares. Maybe even… loves?” accused a tipsy Pansy. “Now tell us his name before I start guessing.”
Marcus made a tsk, tsk noise with his teeth. “No. You answer me first, considering you never answered my letters.”
Draco and Harry had both been so explosive in their anger back then. Harry’s had been buried away with time, and he was still looking to see where Draco’s went.
Harry wasn’t sure what he was getting at but kept taking stabs in the dark anyway. “You’re also gorgeous.”
“And with that the first Teacher’s Meeting of the year is dismissed,” declared Headmistress McGonagall. She stood and everyone around the wooden table did as well.
It was loud, rhythmically shaking the walls with each reverberation. When Harry stayed still the knocking grew more insistent, as if it knew he was there.
Harry stuck his hand right in Draco’s hair and ruffled it up. “I love it when it’s wild. I know you try and tame it, but nothing’s better than your sex hair,” he began with a kiss to the crown of Draco’s head.
A gasp left Draco, body trembling around Harry with a twinge of pain he couldn’t and didn’t want to ignore—the pain was a part of this, too.
Harry’s laugh bubbled out of him. “You’re insane, Draco. You’re completely insane. Go to bed!”
Hermione smiled as she rocked Rose back and forth. “Of course,” she assured him before giving Ron a peck on the lips. “It’s truly a beautiful time when our children have no idea we’re talking about sex in front of them.”
“Draco,” said Harry with a deep, shuddery breath. “Draco, I… I love you. And,” Harry quickly added. “You don’t have to say it back, you really don’t, I—I just wanted to tell you. There’s no, um, expectation—“
“Draco!” Narcissa called from the porch of the Manor to her descendants. “Dinner’s ready!”
“Hey, Nathan, she’s kinda hot.”
“You think I’d look good in anything,” Draco spoke on the matter with confidence.
about it all.
“Charming,” Draco nodded hoarsely. He hoped they knew he meant it. He’d made fun of that little hovel plenty of times in their childhood but as an adult he could see it for what it was—a house of people who loved each other deeply just like his parents loved him. He felt ashamed for ever having taunted Ron about it.
Draco snorted out a laugh in spite of himself.
Any idiot could see Draco was a catch in terms of looks, and Harry was beginning to see how someone could even grow fond of his personality after some serious time together.
“You’ll see.” Draco released his lapels and turned around to call for the gentleman shopkeep. “We’ll take all of this to go,” he informed him and motioned to the card at the register so they could be rung up. When the man wasn’t looking Draco opened a charmed bag so Harry could put his old clothes in with Draco’s, the bag sealing so it was only the size of Draco’s palm. He would hold onto this for now, fully intending to return it though he hoped Harry would take his advice for the future and stop wearing guesses off the rack when he had the answer in front of him.
Ron shuddered. “How many times can I say this is fucked up before it gets redundant?”
“Of course I think I am. I am.” Draco shook it off. “I just didn’t know your taste had improved.”
“You’re awful,” Harry decided, covering his smile. “And I would think the goblins would have noticed the smell.”
What would be made next, of course, was stew.
“Good.” Draco nodded, putting his hands back at his side through bleary eyes. “Good.” Before he knew it he was hugging Harry again, the two holding one another tight. “I am so, so glad you are alive.”
“Ah, yes. I most certainly did.”
“I’m feeling bloody fantastic, Harry. I’m fine, and so glad to be here with you. Will you stay the night with me?” Draco requested.
“It’s nothing,” Draco sighed.
Harry wondered seriously if more people read The Quibbler than The Prophet these days. Draco was a little more doubtful.
“Harry!” Hermione said, rising from her place on a comfortable-looking knit couch she’d been sharing with Fleur. “And Draco. Good to see you.” And it was, to both of their surprise.
Draco didn’t even turn around. He just kept getting textbooks and binders out, swapping them with the ones he used in the morning. Draco color-coordinated, of course. History was yellow, math was blue, health was orange, French was purple, red was science…
“Are you here to see Kennedy?” she asked. Her hands were covered in pink chalk residue. “My name is Mary May Rogers and this is my uncle’s house. Kennedy’s my cousin.”
, Harry thought.
“Harry,” Draco murmured out against his pillow. He was right in that haze between sleeping and waking up, and knowing there was a gorgeous man snogging his arse only made Draco want to stay in the moment and slow down his actual waking up.
This seemed to make Potter’s nerves worse. “I mean, I thought—You know. You were, too.”
“Whose?” Draco asked with a sick laugh.
“Thank you for holding me after,” Harry clarified with some red in his cheeks.
With his breath out Harry let forth a tiny moan, his hole coated in Draco’s saliva and fluttering expectantly against each stripe he licked up across him. “Feels good, sir…” Harry murmured, trying to relax under the touches as he’d been instructed to.
She was going on about how she’d cycled through ‘at least eight’ outfits that morning before picking one that was appropriate enough to be a meet-the-parents outfit and fabulous enough to be perfectly Pansy.
“I can’t tell which will be more mortifying, their jokes or Ron and Hermione’s inquiries,” Harry replied darkly.
“Oh, I don’t know,” Harry mused, kicking off his shoes. “Should I retell all of the jokes you made about my parents? Or would it be better if I slipped a note in your locker with a picture of you in a dress on it? Wait, wait, I know! I’ll refresh your memory with one of
Draco kissed him again, this time brief but with greater yearning.
Hermione had not been expecting this. She still found it strange to hear about Draco and Harry living together so soon in a relationship, but even stranger was the thought of Draco Malfoy willingly reading and enjoying muggle books. “Oh?” was all she could say.
Draco stopped walking. He stared Harry right in those beautiful green eyes of his and spoke as seriously as he ever had. “I am a Healer, Harry, in a hospital with an entire wing dedicated to apparation injuries. Most of the stories I hear, once we put the patients back together again, involve alcohol directly before apparition.” It was a rare enough risk that most competent wizards did apparate whilst under the influence, but Draco had seen the one percent and heard their moans of pain firsthand.
“No.”
“Fuck, fuck, it hurts—but don’t you dare stop. I want to feel it, I want your punishment.”
“What?”
Harry’s eyebrows shot up. “’Hmmm’ what?”
“Maybe it’s monogamy. I mean, people like Draco and Harry can do it. They can be stupid and crazy about each other forever so sickly and so completely, but I don’t think everyone can do that. It doesn’t mean that I love you less, it just means that I’m not them.”
Draco unbuttoned his shirt looking down at Harry hungrily, almost overwhelmed. Where to start on this lovely buffet of skin and lace? “Stand up,” he ordered, and Harry stood less wobbly on his tall heels than he used to. “Do a turn.”
“You don’t know?” Hermione pressed.
“Would you like a receipt?” asked the man behind the counter. “Our returns policy is good for two weeks so long as the pieces haven’t been damaged.”
“They’re protective,” Draco understated massively.
“Yes,” he whispered, pumping in and out, stretching his walls by flexing his fingers open.
The sting was light but perfectly present, sending chills all up Harry’s spine with his surprised yelp.
Aside from the orange stains on the couch, Theo didn’t really mind. He liked living with him for many more reasons than the sex. Colin was easier to live with than Draco had been in Hogwarts since Draco had actually managed to annoy him from another bed away.
"If it weren't for you I would have screwed that guy in the clothing store–"
“’Skeptical’ is a kind way to put it,” Lucius grumbled.
“You know what? You can take this and shove it up your—“
“I hate that I have fans,” Harry countered seriously.
“I’m more motivated these days,” Harry had to admit. “I feel… good?”
“Then what is it?” She wasn’t going to drop her girlfriend off and leave her to drink herself into a stupor over a meeting with Maggie’s mum. She wasn’t even half as fiery as Maggie was. That came from her father.
“I can try it again,” Harry insisted. Draco waved his arm inviting him to.
“You always do,” Harry replied, so lovesick he couldn’t even be embarrassed about it.
Harry was experimenting with talking to a plant when he heard the fireplace burst with the Floo. “Draco!” he sprang up, hoping he didn’t hear him telling a weeping fig how he’d ‘never felt this way about a man before’.
“How wild would it be if it were actually Macklemore?” Harry stoked Draco’s fire. The mere suggestion was laughable, but what would be even more gut-bustingly hilarious was if it truly, truly was the rapper Macklemore carrying out an online relationship with a fan. “It’s not out of the realm of possibility.”
“We have one,” Draco told him quickly. If he didn’t cement that in Lucius’ brain quickly then the man would surely pull out the star charts to browse for baby names.
Ron finally snapped his head around to look at his partner. “What? Then how are we supposed to—?”
“Heterosexuality,” Dean sighed with a tinge of disgust. “It burns.”
They’d add rules as they journeyed on their adventure through the world of sexual relations while being in Capital-L Love with one another.
Draco laughed. “Hardly.”
Draco shook his head slowly. When his future husband proposed to him, he would smack the poor bastard if he ever gave away when he was going to do it over a Facebook chat.
“Yes, that feels so good. Your tongue…” Harry sighed.
All properly tucked in for the second night in a row, it seemed like all that was left to do was sleep. Harry closed his eyes, his glasses resting on the nightstand next to his wand and his shoebox under his bed like it had been under his bed at the flat.
“A little to the left… No, no, more to the right—there! That’s perfect.”
“Then who?” demanded Theo, eyes wide.
Before the fountain sprang a dark Aphrodite.
Draco laughed brightly. “Yes, you think so? What a lucky Daddy I am, to have a pet as sweet as you. Come on, let’s go for a soak.” Draco turned off the shower and the room was instantly warmer again, the hot water of the jacuzzi bath bubbling with its jets.
“I dunno. It’s your story,” Harry shrugged. “But if I had to pick, it’d be a happy ending for the prince.”
“Ron’s going to watch over things,” Harry shrugged. “For however long I’m out. I’ll still be doing paperwork for cases at home, of course.”
“I would never,” Draco assured Kingsley, offended that he would even accuse Draco of lowering himself like that.
Slowly, Harry shifted off of the chair and onto the floor, onto his hands and knees. Head down, his shoulderblades showing through each slink of his body, Harry crawled his way over to Draco and posed on his knees in front of his armchair. “Yes, Daddy,” said Harry, resting his chin on Draco’s knee. “Whatever you say.”
“We haven’t discussed it much, but yes, I’m sure Harry would take such a thing in stride so long as it were on our own terms,” Draco defended. “I will speak to him about it, if it calms your fatherly concern.”
“What’s more important to you?” Harry demanded as he pulled on his black Auror robes. “Your father’s approval—which by the way, you already have, and if this changes it then it was never real in the first place—or for me to start a family with you?”
That would be insulting if Harry cared about how people perceived the Dursleys. As far as he was concerned, Harry wasn’t a part of that ‘family’ unit. “Mr. Snape,” he said with that same fake grin. “I’ve been out of the closet for quite a long time now.”
“Calm down, Blaise. Just because you’re six months older than me doesn’t mean I’m coming after you.”
“Wow,” Emmett finally murmured.
“…What.”
“S’true. That’s all,” Harry muttered without looking up from his notepad. The crush he harbored for Draco felt like it was flowering in the pit of his stomach. “Um. Go on.”
It struck Harry as soon as he had his hand on the doorknob that he’d never been in Draco’s room alone. Draco had gotten to snooping immediately upon walking into his home, and the urge to do the same was tempting but felt forbidden.
Harry wanted his come, wanted it in his mouth and on his chest and face and splattering the deep walls inside of himself. Harry loved the hot rush of a man spilling his seed inside of his ass, breeding him deep and thorough like it might actually stick. Harry wanted this, and he wanted to see what Draco’s face looked like when it happened.
“Thank you,” Draco nodded. “I have high standards and this room finally meets them.” Draco put his hands in his trouser pockets and looked around at the room, ruminating on his own genius.
“Oh.” Harry had really let his anxiety get the best of him in the moment.
He took a deep breath and nodded at Draco. The other wizard and witch in the room had given up on their bickering and begun to fill out the registration themselves. Pye knew Draco’s dramatics and how cross he was when they were interrupted, and at least they weren’t at the hospital where everyone could see him disrespect his superior.
Draco placed Harry’s hands onto the sides of the frame. “Hold on tight, sweets, I’m getting your ankles now.” Draco pressed his hands over Harry’s to make sure his grip was firm enough. He sunk down to quickly undo the remaining knots, freeing Harry entirely. “Stay still, stay still,” he warned until he rose, putting his hands on Harry’s sides. “Don’t try and move too quickly. Let me lead you.”
“That bad?” Harry asked of himself, lifting an arm and finding that unfortunately true. “Ugh, sorry, I haven’t had much time…”
Did Draco like diamonds? Harry hoped he wasn’t quizzed on that. Did he know what kind of ring Draco would want? Why was he thinking so much about rings? He wouldn’t let Lucius get to him.
Draco twirled the Malfoy signet ring on his right hand. It was supposed to be joined on his left by now with a pureblood woman if the Dark Lord had gotten his way. It was thanks to Harry that he could even live his life freely, openly as himself.

“This also never happened,” Harry decided quickly.
“I’m so excited to learn new spells!”
That same crowd would form a cluster around Julian’s dressing room, declaring their love and adoration. Men absolutely lost their minds to get with the star of the show.
“I’m making spaghetti,” Harry said, stirring the pot of sauce and the pot of noodles on the other burner.
For all the mistakes his parents had made, and there were very, very many, passing on their sense of flair was an inarguable positive.
“You’re only jealous because you’re not full of me.”
?” Lucius pressed. “This is the same boy you wrote home about just about every week in school saying you hated. I have the letters upstairs as proof.”
Draco looked to Potter, confused.
“And your lizard’s shattered tailbone predicts that you worship this arse with all of your poncey poetry and talk one hell of a big game, but go weak the second I touch your—“
Harry couldn’t help it—he needed something to sink his teeth into when Draco fucked him like he did.
Harry didn’t even look up from his laptop. “Only in your dreams, Draco. Literally in your dreams.” Harry had the day off because of Draco’s sickness as well, since the show couldn’t exist with one host according to Kingsley.
“You really like it, hm?” Draco said between faltering breaths. Harry was bigger than he’d expected, and his body even more responsive. “Then why don’t you make a mess in my bed for me?”
“Yeah.”
Also holy crap school is awful and all-consuming but vaguely rewarding since I’m a senior.
Then the television would show a blurry screen image of a chat log as some funky mystery music played. ‘That day, Harry Potter met a man on the internet who was not at all what he seemed…’
Harry never knew a moan like that could come out of Draco Malfoy.
“That’s horrible of you,” Harry mock-chided. “This show will bring you down on cable television for it.”
Harry also loved annoying the living shit out of him, and Draco eagerly returned the favor. Harry sang off-key to every song on the radio to grind Draco’s gears and Draco cheered for the opposite Quidditch team that Harry wanted to win just on principle.
Ginny Weasley had never been so close to punching Blaise Zabini in her whole life. “So you’ve been sleeping around on me?” she roared, the Gryffindor lioness within her coming alive with her anger. “You lying bastard!”
Draco’s cheeks went pink as he scrubbed down Harry’s arms and precious chest. “You’re the only one who gets to hear it except the occasional drunken karaoke incident,” Draco informed him.
The next time Draco pulled Harry off of him Harry’s vision was blurry even behind his glasses but he could clearly see Draco’s teeth in his smile. “Darling,” said Draco, thumbing away some drool. “Undress. Now.” No one had to tell Harry twice. Discombobulated as he was as Draco released his grip, Harry tried to be mindful of the silver eyes on him with his every motion.

The phrase ‘on top of me’ was enough to send a spike of chills through Draco’s body. He stroked himself up and down, mind flashing forward to all sorts of fun he could be having on top of the other man.
“Even if this plan might put us in more hot water than we’re already in?” Draco asked again.
“There.” The shorter lawyer grabbed the filled-out packet that relinquished Zeke’s parental rights and sent it off to her office. Now nobody in the room could reach it to change things.
Blaise plopped down on the space Bianca had left. “So, how was it for you?” he asked as he handed her the midnight snack.
Was that an overshare? Oh well.
“That sounds like a naked mole-rat,” Blaise laughed as he refilled his glass.
“Then what if you look into your child’s eyes and see her mother, hm?” Lucius demanded fiercely in his ever-protective spirit. Narcissa, Draco, Harry, and their possible offspring were the only thing his shrunken heart could care for.
“Draco,” Harry hissed, giving him a look he hoped was universal for ‘I’m trying to get laid, fuck off’ but either Draco didn’t understand it or he ignored it.
“Fair point.”
“You know,” Draco chimed in, seemingly unbothered by the oppressive heat. “I think this is only our second date. I need to take you out more.”
“Yes, Daddy,” Harry responded quickly, nothing sounding better. He got on his side and felt Draco’s flat chest press against his back, their legs tangling together atop the sheets with both still too warm from sex to consider going underneath them yet.
With the promise of more food coming and his fiancée seeming to warm up a bit, Ron was extra chipper. How could he not be when this was the happiest he’d seen Harry in a long time? “So, Draco,” Ron said. “I feel like I barely know the guy dating my best mate. Tell me stuff—what’s it like working at the hospital?”
Draco had not been expecting that response. He’d been expecting a drink thrown at him, or maybe the whole glass and a few hexes for good measure. “What? Well, of course I think you’re attractive. How bad is your eyesight, exactly? Have you ever seen yourself in a mirror, or…?”
“Well,” Dudley snarked as if it were obvious. “I have absolutely no idea what the hell I’m supposed to do to get her to stop.”
Apparently not even a higher GPA could make his girlfriend un-pregnant.
Draco hummed around his mouthful in response to Harry granting him that title again. He worked up and down Harry’s cock as deep as he could each time, hands gripping Harry’s thighs tight to keep him steady for this font of pleasure he was delivering.
“You wanted a Daddy,” Draco replied knowingly. “A true one.”
A gruff-looking woman spat at their table as she made her way to her usual table. This woman, who Macnair had begun to cruelly call ‘Cinderfella’, spat at them every day. Sometimes, he thought about how much saliva she must have lost due to that. Gallons over the years, probably.
He heard footsteps approaching behind him and knew them to be Draco’s. “Scarring Harry for life?” he asked Ginny casually, stringing an arm around Harry’s shoulders that he unconsciously leaned into.
And how could Draco refuse? He thrust roughly into the tight heat of Harry, giving him the brutal shagging he requested. Water swished over the side of the tub and onto the bath mat, but Draco could care less about the mess they were making. He was thrusting into Harry with only one goal in mind, to make him burst on cock alone.
“But I owe you,” Olivia continued before backing away. It was funny to think about, but they both smelled nice when he hugged them. Not in a perfume sort of way, but it was still nice.
“So we’re taking the case,” Draco said quickly.
A sharp suit would mark the occasion of the upcoming confrontation, as even though some of the guests would be dressed scandalously, Harry was really only comfortable being that vulnerable in front of Draco nowadays. This day and always he hoped he would feel that way, because what was going on with Draco and him was perfect if not for their nonconsensual debut as freaks to the wizarding world. Freaks together, at least.
Draco reached down and played with Harry’s cockhead. “No, not yet, pet.”
“You’ve got some mac ‘n’ cheese in the fridge,” she stated, eyes a little wild with hunger. “I’m going to make it. Want some?” She could really care less if they were naked and moaning when she walked in. Grace was eating for two, and the baby apparently needed some artificial cheese.
. A little bridge formed its arches between Draco and Harry, one that let them connect as something even deeper than lovers. Harry didn’t know what the name for it was until he was on the edge of sleep.
Draco got up slightly, grabbing a glass on the bedside table along with his wand, and after murmuring a spell water came out of the tip to fill the glass perfectly. “Here, drink up.” Harry did, and passed the water back to Draco indicating for him to do the same, so he did too.
“And damn proud of it,” replied Draco, holding close the man for whom he would do anything. They were going to get through this, and they were getting through it together.
“No, but look, you tried your best—“
“I am never wrong, girl!” snapped the talking headwear. “Now go sit with your classmates, we haven’t got all night.”
Shivers ran down Harry’s spine, feeling quite spoiled by all of the attention.
When Harry lifted his gaze to the stage again he was shocked. The sparse setup that the comedian had was replaced with massive logos, signs for what hashtags to tweet, pictures, monitors, screens—how had the crew gotten all of that into position in such a short amount of time?
The last thing Ginny wanted to hear about was Blaise’s struggle with being constantly horny, but the twinge of sadness in his voice held her back from screaming at him.
“I said hardworking. Thanks to Neville I always got great marks in Herbology, too. I could take a crack at some flowers, even if they’re just small ones at first. Irises—“ Harry observed of the tray he’d placed to the side. “What do they mean?”
“And you do so much for me,” Draco countered. “Having you to take care of makes me take better care of myself, of this whole house. I don’t think I would have ever gotten to the gardens without you.”
Once Draco had gotten past the first ring of muscle, Harry did just that.
“Let him go! Now! I am not under any curse, I’m here of my own free will!” Harry roared at Ron, who was now standing in stunned silence. This sure sounded like Harry, but could it really be him saying these things? “Make them let him go!”
Harry and Draco’s eyes met, Draco’s full of horror and Harry’s full of excitement.
“I know,” Harry muttered, glasses smudged enough to mistake the iPhone 5 in Draco’s hand for a 3
Harry mock-gasped. Draco rolled his eyes.
Draco snickered. “You’re a wicked, wicked woman. You better warn your mother ahead of time that your girlfriend is a basket case.”
like…” Draco listed, motioning to the display of booze and food on his coffee table.
Alvaro,” Harry said, turning on his right side to face Draco. “He loves him. He wasn’t honest and that was wrong, but it wasn’t malicious.”
There were few options, the quarters not being entirely spacious, but Draco opted for one of the two armchairs adjacent to a small table with Defense books stacked high. The room was full of warm reds and browns, a muted Gryffindor palette. The heavy curtains were drawn on Potter’s bed, robbing Draco of the knowledge of what kind of sheets the ‘savior of wizardkind’ slept on.
It was a thin, pale boy that seemed sort of familiar. Only when Ron stood up to stare down the young man did he remember where he and Harry had seen them last. “You,” Ron said, confused. “We arrested you.”
“Brooke had less lies, I’ll give you that, but that doesn’t make her lying null and void.”
Draco could tell from the first time they kissed that Harry was starved for attention—not the kind he got in the Daily Prophet, either. Real, physical contact with someone who wanted to spend their life next to him.
This all had to be some cruel prank, right? After all, she had purchased the recorder at a prank store, maybe her son had found it. He was probably just playing a trick on her to get her riled up. Yes, that had to be it.
“No! I mean—I mean, you know, that you’re… not as interested in witches.”
Taking a deep breath, Draco repeated his mantra.
The fact that Molly had probably given all of her children this exact talk in this exact voice disturbed Remus more than he could properly articulate. “I know how puberty works, Molly. I’m still trying to forget it, and it sticks with me.”
“Draco, I love living here. I don’t care if the walls are polka-dot purple or what kind of flooring you’ve got, because all of it came from you. I like everything you do here because, well, you do it.”
Harry rose and took it, looking only at Draco. “Let’s.”
Draco was still reeling from his player-versus-player loss against that arrogant twit of a worgen. He refused to accept that as defeat and had gone up against Worgasm for the best two out of three and only won once. Just when he suggested they do the best three out of five, the other man said he had to ‘go to sleep’ and ‘rest’ or some utter madness like that. Only when Draco looked at Theo’s alarm clock glowing in the dark over his snoring body did he realize it was three in the morning.
“Oh, sorry, I—“ the other man said nervously, only seeing the Auror insignia. If he was caught like this, then he knew it would be hell all over again.
“Doesn’t stop me from feeling like one! You should have seen his face when I said I had to leave for ‘work’. Even he knew that was a shitty lie.” Dennis had taken the news disturbingly well for Colin’s taste, but maybe that was because his little brother hadn’t known their mum for as long as he had. Dennis hadn’t seen them together like they had been.
“The maddest,” Draco agreed and nudged their feet together. That was really as close as they could get in here without it feeling painfully hot.
Oh, fuck, was that even a part of it?
Harry’s hands flew to them, undoing button by agonizing button until he could finally expose Draco’s chest with one swift pushing off of fabric over his shoulders. So fit, so gorgeous, so—scarred. Harry held back a noise of surprise upon seeing Draco’s bare chest. The slashes were long-healed but Merlin, how they looked like they had been deep.
“If you insist.”
Harry nodded in agreement before ridding himself of his shirt and his pants and trousers at once. He stepped out of them and into the bathtub, into Draco’s open and inviting arms.
With a breathy laugh, the brunette gave Draco a quick kiss. The man really was learned in the ways of Harry’s body, and he knew that pushing down hard on his glans made Harry’s toes curl under. “Draco!” he cried out, nails digging into the fabric of his robes. “What if—what if someone walks in while I’m—?”
xxxxXXXXxxxx
Considering it was all his fault, Draco was loath to describe every crippling detail, but he knew what happened with Harry when he set his mind to something. There was no escaping whatever cocked-up plan the raven-haired man had cooked up.
Draco released his hand so he could give him a firm spank on the arse. “So cheeky today, you really will be in for it later. My mind’s made up.” And still Draco took Harry’s hand in his again and they walked as one together.
They were safe, weren’t they? They were behind closed doors and nobody was asking probing questions. Well, nobody but Harry.
“Nope,” Harry shook his head. “You can sit down at the counter and keep me company, though. We have a few minutes and then I’ll serve it in the dining room.”
“What’s not fair is a baby being shunned from adoption because of something they couldn’t even control. Nobody picks how they’re born and you should know that.”
“He’s been working hard since day one, though. That’s why we haven’t been able to meet, because he’s almost always in the studio writing lyrics or making music.”
“No, that’s not—“
Off the bat Lucius didn’t like the idea of some stranger helping with the Manor. It was different when Draco’s hapless childhood friends were assisting, but who was this person? Lucius didn’t trust a soul outside of his circle, he never had. This was supposed to be done by a Malfoy.
After he heard what he got to do with Harry’s slumbering body, Draco warmed up to the idea.
Hermione cracked a smile that Draco had never seen before—a genuine one. “I appreciate the concern, I do. I’m positive, yes, because it seems Harry is,” she answered honestly. “And I have to tell you that if you hurt him in any way—cheat on him, do him wrong—I will see your end, Draco Malfoy.”
“You love it when I talk,” Draco told him. “Luckily for you I do quite a bit of talking.”
When they left, Narcissa let out a breath she’d been holding. For a moment there, she could have sworn she was drowning.
“Please may I have some tea?”
As much as I love sharing the stories of others (and as much as Harry and Draco love sharing the stories of others) it’s about time to give these two a little break in filming their series. This is a bit of a filler. I’ve been watching Black Butler lately, and I love Sebastian/Ciel so Draco’s dream is inspired by them.
Even Draco couldn’t hold back a horrible laugh at that. “
Ever since Harry had woken up in a hotel bed next to a naked, sated Draco Malfoy, the online misadventures of the general public paled in comparison. Harry felt guilty for thinking so as he’d taken the job in an effort to make people happy and unite them with their distant loves, but he had hooked up with
Feeling confused and still hearing Bruce’s hoarse laugh from years of what had to be cigar smoking before he was diagnosed, Draco thought up a reply.
“So,” Draco tried. “What brought you to the neighborhood?”
“Grandma!”
“I don’t even want to know,” Lucius said of the weird look on Harry’s face and whatever Draco had just muttered aside to him.
“Mistress Narcissa Malfoy née Black, first of her name,” Gerda announced. Narcissa was also the last of the Blacks to survive the war who wasn’t gay, but she kept that in her head. She and Sirius were the end of the Black empire after years of reigning strong.
Harry took Draco’s hand in his. “Just avoid any cameras. According to your father I shouldn’t even be breathing on you.”
Draco wrapped up his shift with a satisfied smile.
Her usually primly trussed hair was below her shoulders in length without a single curl to be found. Oh, sweet, sweet justice. “Potter,” she said, taken aback. Apparently, jail had robbed her of her quick wits. However, she made up for it in a few sad seconds. “I’ve been doing splendidly. Tell me, I may be on a leash by the Ministry, but what is it like to be on Draco Malfoy’s leash?”
Harry’s head lolled to the side, his breathing heavy and uneven as Draco lowered down his legs, equally winded. “Harry,” he said, endorphins still rushing through his system. “Harry…”
“Underground secret society,” he answered without thinking. Luckily, Colin didn’t ask for elaboration. “Sorry.”
It was a level of Shakespearian irony that the snotty kid who Harry had rejected was now the man he gave his submission to freely. It was Draco’s hand he looked forward to, firm or soft depending on what Harry didn’t even know he needed yet. Draco knew somehow, maybe now because he listened first instead of blabbed about the ‘right sort of people’.
“It really is better with daylight, but the lamps and candles make do for now,” Draco went on aimlessly. “Oh, there’s the scroll from Safeword.” He snorted a laugh to himself.
“Gee whiz,” Seamus said in mock-amazement. He caught right on to this big joke. “You sure are one bad boy.”
There was a silence at the table.
“You’re such an arse,” Harry laughed.
“I won’t,” Harry said.
Merlin, he was crazy. Harry had really done that. He had really, truly confessed his dark desires to the wizarding public—or at least those who read this publication—in hopes of seeing them come true.
can make whatever decisions he wants about who to be with.”
“Yes, sir,” Harry replied in earnest, sliding them off as instructed. When he was done he sat back on his heels, resting on his knees with wide green eyes awaiting further instructions. Harry was hard and prepared to do whatever Draco asked to resolve that situation—considering how fun it was each time.
In the back of the open-air plan there was a massive glass door leading to the biggest office on the floor. Harry could see the woman sitting behind the desk already, her features coming into view.
As if Harry could read his mind, he launched into a much less stressful topic. “Enough about the biological mother. Let’s talk names.”
“Thank you, Daddy,” Harry practically purred.
“Please. Seal. The door.”
“And then there are the owls from my parents. One is due soon,” Draco spoke like one would of a coming storm. “I hope you understand why I won’t be mentioning anything about this in my upcoming reply.”
“Let’s go.” Narcissa secured a Slytherin-green ribbon around the end of the braid.
Draco shifted uncomfortably. He wanted to defend himself, but he knew that Grace had to say this without being interrupted.
She was in their kitchen, for fuck’s sake. Grace Burbage was in the Malfoy-Potter kitchen snacking on pita chips because she felt fat. That was the curse of baby weight at five months, after all.
Zeke’s mother couldn’t take another second of it. She ripped herself from the pensieve only to earn an excruciating headache in the process. “Prophet!” she roared. “I need to see The Prophet!”
Draco really had been meaning to get the Manor’s fruit trees up and running again in the back but they proved finicky no matter what growth potion he poured on them. For now he got his oranges from a Marlborough Farmer’s Market not too far from the Manor. Wiltshire was of quiet, green country, with lots of space in between neighbors and magic wards to keep the muggles from discovering the Manor existed in the first place.
Harry laughed, pulling up so he could look into Draco’s bloodshot eyes. “I knew when you didn’t apparate that you were smashed,” Harry reported cheerily.
The flag rippled in the virtual wind as Harry chased him down. Spells were being hurled left and right, but they all soared past the two mounted heroes.
Yet the Pureblood talent of self-delusion would only last for a moment. Reality was closing in on her faster than she was ever prepared for.
Weirdly enough, Draco was excited. He counted down the minutes on the clock, and actually wound up shoving Potter out of his way to get to the door faster.
Harry, who had been flipping through the recipe book in the kitchen shut it and placed it aside, a mad grin coming to his lips. “Oh, and what would that be?” he questioned on his way to the entrance hall.
Those kids were a ridiculous bunch. They worshipped the ground that the original Death Eaters walked on, but could barely hold their own in a prison yard fight. Macnair thought they were just a bunch of chickenshit kids who didn’t understand what it meant to be on the losing side of a war.
“What? If I had access to the Malfoy family funds I’d be running a tab. You really have to hurt his wallet more, Harry. I swear he likes it,” she teased of her friend.
“This first time, you can come whenever you like,” Draco murmured, smoothing his hand over the thigh he’d brought up, hiking up Harry’s skirts to see his lacy black underthings barely able to hold all of him in. “But the second time you must wait for my permission.”
Draco took a deep, shuddery breath. “I need you,” Draco said shakily. “To trust me when I say you cannot read this copy of The Prophet. Ever. Please. There are just some things—some things that a parent shouldn’t see.”
Offended, Bianca roughly shoved her underwear back on. “No, I don’t want any food,” she snarled.
An absurd thought crossed Harry’s mind. Was this how Draco treated his
“You take such good care of me,” said Harry, hooking his thumbs in the waistband of Draco’s pants. “Let me take care of you.”
Pye had a stay-at-home wife and liked suede couches. Draco had an arse-kicking husband and despised all things suede, velvet, and corduroy for their disgustingly thick materials. The Pyes and the Malfoy-Potters lived on sides of the track that would never cross in normal circumstances.
In a quiet panic Draco crept down the hall bathed in morning light, peeking in the door to see if he had truly gone mad enough as to imagine a whole evening of romance with someone he hadn’t spoken to in a decade. His stomach flipped to discover Harry bloody Potter still all tucked-in, sleeping deeply and peacefully in a bed that he knew well the meaning of sleeping in.
“Comeslut extraordinaire,” Draco dubbed him and Harry laughed like a fool, leaning into his every touch. “Mm, was it everything you wanted?”
A long moment passed between them before Harry was struck with an idea. “Daddy?” Harry said in his quietest, most saccharine voice. “Is there anything I can do to help with that?”
Draco reached down to Harry’s feet and helped him take his shoes off. “I’ll be carrying you there, of course. No need for you to walk.”
Theo frowned. That sounded heavy and hardly as scandalous as sex trafficking. “Oh. Is he alright with that?”
“What?” Draco sputtered out finally at the wave of reporters and photographers outside his front door. “No! That’s impossible—“
Those two words almost buckled Harry at the knees. Draco took note as Harry tried to recover from it, hard and wanting.
Whenever a man sent flowers up to the flat for Draco, Draco would have this giddy smile all day long. Draco liked to say he thought himself amazing and wonderful, but it was really when other people thought of him as amazing and wonderful that he truly believed it.
And with that Draco turned back to the fireplace. “Ready?” he asked Harry, still not sure if he was himself.
“What do you know about growing up?” Draco teased, caressing his upper arm. “You still brush your teeth with bubblegum toothpaste.”
“You’ve got a patient! Room 204. She’s really intent on seeing you now. Right now.”
“Yes!” Draco shouted when the last bar on the crib finally popped into place, completing what had been an hour’s worth of baby-bed-related insanity. “
It was strange to have so many people from so many states in one place who would have otherwise never known each other. Those who had found love and those who truly had been Catfished stood side-by-side and exchanged nervous but excited glances.
Dragonis and his silvery blonde and decidedly virtual hair mounted his proto-drake, taking to the skies. The green dragon flapped its fearsome wings while Draco’s character rode on its back. Using his mouse, Draco could adjust his character’s view of the horizon. He searched the grasslands for some Alliance dog he could swarm when his eyes finally landed on one unlucky worgen.
you don’t want me to go with you?” Theo sighed from his place perched on Draco’s bed. “I wouldn’t stick around to babysit or whatever.”
If they were in the hotel conference room with Harry they would have accused him of making the leap into reality television because he was obsessed with the attention. Harry thought that to be almost the farthest thing from the truth—who cared who was watching? Harry was in this for the experience—but when did they ever listen to Harry?
“Hello, this is Draco from Catfish,” he sighed into the receiver.
“Olivia,” Remus said, no longer needing to drop to his knee to get to her eye-level. She really was growing fast. It made her scars stretch, and Remus knew how self-conscious that could make someone. “You can use all the hot water you like. And don’t you even begin to worry about what the wolf does. You’re separate, and you have to start telling yourself that. Also, I will be sure to try and fulfill every food request you have. Even takeout every night.” That was actually what he and Sirius had most of the time, so… “And if you ever get angry, I’ll try and understand why so that we can fix it. We want you there.”
him,” Harry said as if the thought was unbearable. That was just school talk for ‘causing trouble’ and it looked much more official on a report, but Harry resented it all the same. “Mr. Snape put us together on a project. I’m not seeking this prat out just to mess with him.”
Draco didn’t even give him an obliging laugh like he usually did in hopes of a promotion. “Most of their articles are wrong.” The last one Pansy had showed him in jest said that he and Harry were looking to move to a Buddhist temple to find inner peace and spiritual enlightenment. “Interested in my personal life?”
“Here,” Draco said, glad to see the shop was still open for another hour on its placard. “What you have on is just fine, don’t take it as a jab, but where we’re going you’ll need to be dressed
Harry had already been awake when Draco came in but the follow-up question so early in the morning—it implicated him, as well. “Not enough,” Harry settled on. He licked his lips openly at this display of breakfast delight and turned his wakening eyes to Draco. “Thank you, for breakfast, if I’m really allowed to eat this—“
“Merlin, Ron. You’re the child in the room.”
How Draco could have grown up in this kind of opulence was still foreign to Harry. No wonder he had turned out to be such a spoilt little thing in school.
“I’ve just been watching television,” Olivia laughed. She’d never been so unproductive in her entire life and it was the most refreshing thing in the world. “And writing to friends.”
“I just don’t get it,” Harry had to admit to the both of them. “I understand, um, you know—“ Harry struggled to say the words in front of his current love and his ex-girlfriend. “Impact play, and stuff. I get pain, but why shocks? Is it painful?”
“Yes, there can be cucumbers, but that’s hardly the extent of it. Worry not, I’ll narrate you through every treatment. We’ll be attending my usual location where my privacy has always been respected. Does that sound okay?”
“How many toys does a baby even need?”
Draco threw in a nod of agreement.
“Yes, sir,” Harry replied seriously as if snuggling was a grave commitment. He nuzzled their cheeks together. “Ten minutes on the clock. There’s a lot to be done with timers, I’m told.”
Remus rolled his eyes. The cloud of smoke that was his and Sirius’ fifth year had not been forgotten.
“Photography club meets today.”
“Chilled and ready,” said Pansy from the kitchen, holding up matching margaritas for Draco and her. With a happy noise she, clearly already a few drinks in, bounced back to the living room and handed Draco his drink. “Now drink, if drinking’s what it’ll take to get this out of you.”
“The best.”
“In that case,” Draco said, steeling himself in return. He backed up slightly, squaring off Harry’s shoulders with his hands before reaching into his inner jacket pocket. Once he had the box in his hand he looked Harry right in the eye as he sank to one knee.
“That was a joke,” he smirked. “Though father will definitely try to scare you off.”
“Draco? ...Draco?”
“Thank you,” Harry murmured for a second time. “Thank you.”
“Fucking weirdoes,” grumbled the cabbie. He drove off before realizing the plump man had given him a hundred pounds instead of twenty.
There were a lot of aspects of Harry’s life that Draco knew from sharing it with him online. He knew Harry’s sob story, his sexual kinks, and his attitude towards life in general. Finally, Harry came up with something. “There’s this owl that hangs out outside of my house. She’s snowy white and likes it when I give her cheese, and I have been caught speaking to her as if she were a person.”
“Maybe?” Ginny laughed, leaning back onto the wall where the television was mounted. It was absurd to laugh, but her whole life had been rather absurd from the moment she was born into a family of nothing but boys and a doting mother.
“Oh, joy.” Draco brought up the charmed linen barrier he kept strung around his neck to cover his nose and mouth. He snapped on gloves as he walked, and as they approached the room in question he picked up the foul, fetid scent of rotten fruit. The intern was trying not to shed a tear at its intensity. Draco sighed. Was she Mary or was she Britney? Either way she’d clearly only add to the mess with her weak stomach. “You wait out here, I can do this on my own.” She backed up in silent, reverent head bows. “A Healer’s work is never done,” Draco declared before opening the door so a wave of hot, nasty rot could hit him head-on.
It was a cliché, but Draco acknowledged that it was at least a heartfelt cliché.
The castle held so many conflicting memories for him. The saddest, the most scared he’d ever been was in his four-poster bed in the Slytherin boy’s dorm, but some of his happiest memories were there too.
“Astounding,” Harry echoed.
Draco had presented every discrepancy in Chris’ story to Ruth candidly. He’d shown her how the photos belonged to another man, how this ‘friend’ of Chris’ wasn’t responding, and even with all that she still wanted to go to New York.
But still, there was an undeniable growth of something between them. Draco had become fiercely protective over Harry at a moment’s notice.
Draco pressed the tip of his cock to Harry’s hole and parted his fingers wide enough for him to push in. Easing himself deeper with each passing moment Draco let out a groan of his own, raw and true.
beds, and handing that key to us. As far as I’m concerned, it is within your physical power unless you have a mental block on how to do your damn job.”
“You,” Draco nearly whispered. “Are like a dream come true.” Draco stepped forward so he was at the edge of the bed, both hands immediately going to cup and grope the globes of Harry’s arse. He pushed his skirts up just enough to get to him. “This arse is art—what I would do if I could paint.”
Before Kingsley could sort what happened his girlfriend of five years hurdled over three rows of chairs to fall into his arms. “I,” he stammered.
“You don’t have to do any of that,” Sirius told her before Remus gave him a little shove. “Okay, yes, the good grades would be favorable, but you don’t have to work for this or anything.” Another shove hit Sirius’ arm. “And
‘Slut’ echoed in the very boards that held the house together. It was like she had rung a bell to signal it was slut’o’clock.
“Harry,” Draco called out into the echo of the room. He reached around Harry’s hip to take him in-hand. “With me.”
Harry shrugged. “I am calm.” Ron was a clever and brave Auror who hadn’t even let Voldemort stand in the way of good when Ron was a teenager. “I think you’d be a good fit for the job.”
Harry looked down at the file and forced his head to stop swimming. “Erm. She’s pretty, and she’s on prenatal vitamins.”
“What are you thinking about now?” Draco asked when Harry’s eyes clearly were focusing on something else.
The press practically salivated, screeching and barking at their opportunity to be the first to get a picture of whatever grand revelation was about to ensue.
“Hey, wait!” Dudley said, feeling massively pathetic. “When do you have to go back to work? Maybe we could grab a meal somewhere that doesn’t have a clown at the door. I mean, if you want to—“
Draco had read Aubrey’s text word-for-word to Lorraine at least three times before she got what it said. Aubrey had talked to Macklemore’s assistant and explained the situation to her only to get a reply that Macklemore was not in a relationship with anyone at the time and that Macklemore was a very, very busy man.
“Let’s do it.”
The text wasn’t from Ron or Hermione, though. It was from a contact Harry had entered into his phone at the last minute the previous evening. Draco and he hadn’t stayed up late enough to hear back from Chris in favor of sleeping.
“You know him?” Ron asked, snorting out a laugh before shutting out the madness by closing the door behind the intern.
All he was left to do was lay there and take it. Harry’s eyes screwed shut, hissing through the pain before he grabbed the flogger once again.
“I was just—“
Tom Riddle’s voice echoed in his mind.
Just because he fancied parts of Harry didn’t mean he stopped despising the others that happened to include Granger and Weasel and the part that had made Harry run out of that damn café.
Harry nodded, unaware of the war waging inside Ron’s skull of whether or not he should deliver some tough love to his friend clearly in need. “Good to see you to. Come in, I’m just making a pizza.” Harry waved him in, quickly grabbing the blankets off of the couch and tossing them onto the armchair so they’d have room to sit.
Hours trickled by as Draco cemented his lesson plans, finally reaching a point where he was confident he would remember each one in the moment. Draco fully intended to give out the tips and tricks of the trade, the secrets he’d learned along the way, instead of hiding the knowledge like past greedy Potionsmasters did. Draco wanted for his students to succeed, and one day, perhaps even succeed him.
“Essayist? I don’t really know about all that…”
She closed the door to lock them both inside.
“Mr. Snape? Loathe
Harry swallowed down his shock, trying to keep his brave face. “Well. Your portrait will be down by morning.”
“So it’s really great that your father is supportive,” Harry mentioned to fill the dead air time as they filed into Kennedy’s room.
“Is your goal to make me crazy, Draco?” Shaking his head, Harry rested his eyes for a moment. The travel was rough, but the waiting aspect of it had to be the absolute worst. Harry knew they’d be sitting there for at least an hour
He was all sunshine and smiles, and while Draco was growing fond of the way Harry’s nose crinkled up when he was excited to bring ‘soulmates’ together, he worried Harry was going to be betrayed again by some dishonest person behind a computer screen.
Christmas. Harry thought back, far back, far before he knew what he was to become—a wizard, a savior, a depressed mess, a sexual masochist. Before all that he was just a kid who, one fateful year, believed in Santa before Aunt Petunia disabused him of the thought that orphans got toys from Santa. What did that little boy want?
Remus was always doing stuff like that, Olivia had noticed. Stuff that made people feel reassured and warm. “Well,” she said slowly before grabbing her bag again so that they could walk some more. “I do have a soft spot for chocolate.”
Sure, Draco was great for conversation and easy on the eyes, but he really was a hamper on Harry’s flirtations. His Grindr mobile app had been getting notifications all day long, but there was no way he could answer them without Draco catching a peek.
“Everything smooth sailing in the land of the Scots?” Pansy asked teasingly from her spot on Maggie’s bed.
“Thank you, dear.”
Lucius continued as if Draco had not spoken. “So all I asked of you after accepting this was to find someone you could rebuild the Manor with.”
“And with such a low self-image,” Harry joked, knowing immediately who Draco was talking about.
“Chris,” Harry said out loud. “It’s Chris. Get the camera, it’s Chris.”
“And when was that?” Hermione questioned.
“I would prefer the kid to be gay,” Draco shrugged as he transitioned out of joking. He scanned a unicorn plushie for good measure in hopes of inducing a little queerer in their already queer household. “Then I don’t have to worry about becoming a grandfather and I can recommend all the best bars.”
Finally, the café door opened and Harry just
“And what you mean by ‘what you do with each other’…? Harry, Draco,” Luna said gently. “This one is for both of you: Do you feel you’re in a safe, sane, and consensual relationship at which you can leave any time, under the influence of no love potion or spell?”
Hermione was glad to hear Harry speak aloud the presence of his depression, so it was no longer just the ignored elephant in the room. “You’ve been feeling better?” Hermione asked carefully.
Harry knocked on Draco’s door with his free hand.
“Yes,” Harry nodded, a shiver overtaking his whole body.
“I’m sure you’ll live.”
“They’re people,” she pressed on before standing up. Her ankles were weak, but she felt possessed. “And do you know what? That’s worth being angry over. You want to blame it all on Voldemort murdering my parents? You’re leaving everything else out! Don’t you dare tell me I’m fucked up because my Aunt and Uncle raised me when the world around me was full of shit to begin with.”
Potter himself wasn’t failing even though lots of his little friends were, but he looked the most miserable out of the bunch and Snape honestly just wanted to make him even more miserable. It was more of a life goal for him, an ambition that never ended.
“I’ll say,” Harry grumbled, clearly feeling better if he could pout.
Draco checked but the marks seemed light, so he conjured his glass of water for he and Harry to share before curling up alongside him, knowing that he wouldn’t want anything touching his legs or arse after that for they’d be raw at least a few more days. “I’m here,” Draco murmured, crossing their feet together.
And there was the Draco that Harry knew and lov—liked. Tolerated. Found amusing. Yeah, that was it. That was definitely it.
Under the sorting hat sat Hunter Matthew Malfoy-Potter, his eyes darting around the room so he could avoid the stares.
“Stay,” Harry demanded, keeping his arms locked tight before he realized he wasn’t in any position to be giving commands. “Please?”
“You too, my Dragon.” And just like that Pansy was gone, apparated away to wherever her loyal servants were picking her up.
“And you had her sign the necessary paperwork? And you made sure she had no congenital diseases? Nothing she or the biological father could pass on? What’s the status of the father—?” Lucius began.
“Wonderful.”
The lawyers flipped through the forms. “Initial there, there, there, there, and there. Then sign the bottom of this.”
The kiss was sweet but didn’t last long—it was clear Emmett was uncomfortable in front of the cameras after having revealed something so big.
“Hey, Draco is gay and he’s one of my best friends.”
“It could be nobody’s,” Draco shrugged. “But it could also be ours, if you like.”
“Have you yourselves read the whole story?” asked Luna.
I had the worst case of smut-block. Just assume they shagged wildly in a few months after this. Time for thesecreteater’s Wolfstar fic that I promised I’d write forever ago.
Harry happily moved onto his back, resting his head against a throw-pillow. Squirming into a comfortable position and tipping his eyes back up to Draco, he cracked a huge smile.
He gathered up his boxers from the night before and put them on. He could technically be naked here with how Draco had warded anyone but the two of them from entering, but the expansive halls inspired some shame in Harry he couldn’t explain, like he’d be walking Hogwarts naked.
“That’s all five hundred,” he said, his cheery disposition gone. “Now, you know my boss would be very cross if you were to inform the two men here that I was never really their clerk.”
“That’s how you know,” Harry said as if that was brand new information that Draco had not already figured out on his own. It was still fun to play around with this man, the one whose name he finally knew. Draco Malfoy.
In order to distract herself from that horribly looming fact, she walked on.
“No—“
Purely to get under Harry’s skin and gross him out some more, Draco made sure to include the My Little Pony comment in every single take.
“Sorry,” Harry said about the scars and about the fact that he was apologizing at all, that he was being weird and lingering on this.
The Slytherins cackled at that one.
Lucius had been through his fair share of ‘weird limbos’. “Then you know what?”
Draco opened the clamp wide with its rubber tips and pushed it onto the base of Harry’s nipple, slowly beginning to close it. “Oh,” said Harry in shock when the clamp closed all the way around him.
Considering himself the victor of the conversation—as if conversations even had victors—Draco got right to getting dressed and setting up the camera.
The next witch, a dark-skinned girl with a long braid trailing down her back, was quickly sorted into Slytherin and the ceremony continued without further ado.
Maggie snorted out a laugh. She was beginning to see Pansy’s earlier complaining in a more justified light.
“When isn’t daddy having a conniption?” she reminisced lovingly.
“Something more surprising than this?” Ron asked, deadpan indicating between Draco and Harry. Draco laughed at that when Ron didn’t expect him to.
Curious, Harry handed him the bottle. Draco’s hand squeezed around the bottle to get a dollop out onto his free hand before moving that one back down to Harry’s cock.
“Well, well, well.”
Ginny laughed as she skimmed the made-up details of Draco’s ‘motherly instincts’. Oh, how the Prophet loved gender roles. “You’re jealous of them,” she decided. “Just because we’ve only been on the cover twice doesn’t mean this is a competition.”
“On a trip to Spain a few years ago I had it at a small family restaurant. The dish isn’t really anything complicated but I can never get it to taste like it did there—I can come close, though, and that is pretty damn good. Occasionally I’ll bastardize it and add udon when I’m making it for someone sick—the world’s most savory chicken-noodle soup.”
Harry had been in the middle of some pet battling when he heard the little ping that the game used to signal a friend was online.
“Hey, you were the one who said it first: forever,” Harry pointed out.
With a promise to himself not to look up at the door with each customer that came in, Harry listened intently to people walking in and out of the café. He didn’t want to get his hopes up and look like a complete and utter loser when the man who walked in was just another thirty-something out for drinks with his friends.
Draco smiled a little, but he wouldn’t let Harry see it. After all, just because they were married didn’t mean that the Gryffindor didn’t have to work for Draco’s approval any longer. “Very deep down,” he nodded.
“Only the highest thread count, of course,” Draco said of the sheets. He wondered what Harry’s fingertips felt like and was breathless a moment.
“Lovely,” Harry nodded. While he couldn’t give Draco a ‘meet the guardians’ moment that was anywhere near as intimidating as Harry’s, his friends would at least be doing the same to Draco. Both cliques had a natural distrust of one another after years of butting heads.
“Do you think of anything other than sex?” Harry questioned sincerely, pushing past the embarrassment to keep their repartee going.
“No, no, you got Selwyn.” For many reasons, Harry preferred to stay away from him. “I’ll interview her and get it over with.”
“Get out of my house,” Draco told them both without any intention of following through on his demand.
“Miserably,” Ron said cheerily. “We’re on a wild goose chase for some flowers. Is it bad that I’m actually wishing for a high-profile case of regular murder and deception from a crime of passion to get us off of this insanity?”
In a way, Hogwarts was all about Harry Potter—hating him, being jealous of him, being stupidly attracted to him, being afraid of him, being afraid for him… Madness. The schoolboy crushes were apparently mutual from Harry’s stories of their time there. Talking about that time in their lives, that time in Draco’s life when he was ashamed of who he was, was never easy.
Draco’s hands, Draco’s lips, that trunk of sex toys they’d yet to unpack in the new house…
Harry swallowed and removed the circular frames. He placed them to the side and looked back up to Draco. “Please don’t make me look at one of those ‘E’ charts,” he half-begged. They were the bane of his existence as a child, the Dursleys furious with him each time he got one wrong because that meant he needed glasses and they had to spend money on him.
Harry closed his eyes again because somehow they’d opened when he’d meant to keep them shut—a requisite of falling asleep, Potter, focus—he envisioned the shoebox sitting alone under the center of the bed he was in.
Draco’s mailbox contained a few patients’ records, test results, and one anxious Theodore Nott’s hastily scribbled letter.
He felt sort of giddy about that.
Her first school dance? Her first date? Her graduation? Her first day at work? Her wedding?
“Myself,” Harry admitted and forced himself to keep his head held high about it as they walked through rows of miniature trees. There was a train chugging along around the top of the walls of the shop, lights glowing and flashing.
“There,” Draco pointed to the corner of the gallery that contained the photography credits. “It says the model’s name is Brian Beckham.”
“Then we have to go to Remus,” Ron said sourly, knowing Harry wouldn’t fancy that alternative much more.
Draco grinned and kept walking. “I’ve got a surprise for you, and I figured this was less suspicious than wrapping a blindfold around your eyes. Though I could have made some great demonic warlock references.”
Grinning, Theo put on his own shoes and prepared to apparate. They’d attune to Draco and Harry’s fireplace later, he supposed. “Is that code for ‘we’re babysitting when Dennis has kids’?”
Teacher’s pet, spoiled brat, obnoxious, and filthy rich. His parents bought him a car for his fifteenth birthday, a brand-new corvette. Stuff like that made Harry crazy. Malfoy probably didn’t even know the value of a pound like Harry had had to learn. Malfoy probably hadn’t worked a day in his life.
“No,” Harry admitted. “It has nothing to do with vaults.”
“And that would mean that you would have no contact with the child,” Harry followed up. “We could send you pictures or progress reports, but we would be the only parental figures in their life.”
Harry would fill it, he decided. He would fill Draco’s life with beauty and flowers, roses and violets because he deserved them and more.
“—what, I’ve seen it plenty of times! Ugh, you didn’t even let me get to the part about your sparkling personality. Pretty
Lily came to a halt when she faced a corner of rose bushes, the skirts of her pink dress swishing around her as she looked for another way out.
Harry took a deep breath. Everyone around him was there for Draco and him. “You guys are the greatest.”
It was this sensation that nearly did Harry in again, and Draco could tell.
“Hm.” Draco’s lips spread into a smile. “Yes, yes I could.” He kissed Harry as if to confirm that statement. “So revenge it’ll be.”
“Yeah, it needed a deep clean. But, um,” Harry took up his bowl of rice and started scooping in heaps of the meat. “I’m not really living here anymore, like I said.”
“Nah,” Theo shrugged. “I think I’m going to do everything in my power to make sure this name and this blood dies out.”
“I mean it. You don’t deserve this in a world that barely understands gay people, let alone what we do with each other. You deserve so much better,” Harry insisted.
Meanwhile, similar things sped through Draco’s head.
With their sex restricted to just one room in their spacious, beautiful, ever-so-shagged-in home, Draco and Harry were forced to get creative.
Harry’s eyes flicked back up to Draco’s. He certainly looked the part in that black suit, almost like the sort he’d worn through sixth year. Fuck, Harry had been so distracted by that. “Yes,” he said in a near-whisper as he turned his face away again. “One who’s fair, but firm.”
An impatient whine escaped Harry as he writhed in the sheets.
“It’s because I give a shit you know,” Ron countered.
“Shut up,” Draco muttered against his shoulder before getting on his tip-toes to kiss his cheek. “I’ll be back later, okay?”
“Well, to start off with, your parents were married and in love. It’s rather Walburga and Orion to name siblings after them,” Draco murmured.
Draco didn’t know how to tell Lorraine that lots of people actually thought that, not just white rappers who had gay uncles.
“What the hell do you mean you don’t care?” his father snarled back. “This isn’t about you. You’re a child in a greater scheme of wizarding purity. You hold the blood of kings and conquerors in your veins, and it is your sworn duty to pass it on.”
He stepped out of the shower into his sandals and wrapped a towel around himself on the way to his locker. With a drying spell and a quick change of clothes he was on his way, out of the locker room, employee lounge, and into the lobby.
“The greenhouse is nearly finished, so I may cross that one off the list today. Then we can start moving in and growing plants for the rest of the garden.” Harry watched as Draco stood, naked as the day he was born, and padded over to the bathroom.
. An incredibly official and meaningful step in a relationship that Pansy had never, ever done before.
The rectangle on closer inspection was a brand-new book, one Draco had been looking forward to reading when it was released in the next two months. He opened the cover to find a signature from the author themself. “Theodore, how did you even get your gay little hands on this?”
The golden tiles swirled like snakes up his legs, anchoring him there. “Stay,” Helen requested, putting her hand out to him.
The words of the story didn’t really matter to Harry at all. Sure, it was a wonderful tale, but that wasn’t the point at all.
Harry accepted the card from him before turning it so the writing was right-side-up. “Oh.” A shock went through his spine lightning striking the ground. He knew that name.
Harry could handle a little danger, though. This was finally what he wanted. This was different.
Merlin, Harry looked like a million galleons in this getup. Draco had outdone himself. “Excellent,” he chirped, head held high. “And as for your glasses, is your sight actually as awful as I always teased you for?” Draco hoped they could get on with joking about that sort of thing.
Harry watched this unfold and blinked. Narcissa took her seat with a gracious look to her husband, one that held a great deal of love in it. That gave Harry a few ideas for conversation, if the right time to say them ever came up.
Once Draco closed the door behind Harry after entering his luxurious office—which he had decorated entirely on his own, by the way—he went back to that planet with Harry.
“Lucius,” Narcissa cut in, her frustration more evident in her eyes. “Do you think he would subject the poor boy to
“Then why not practice a little kindness yourself? Must I remind you of the fact that Harry’s kindness once spared us Azkaban? Must I retell the story of that horrible night, the one where all we cared about was finding our boy? How Harry helped me, told me Draco was still alive at the castle?” Narcissa’s gaze was centered on her stubborn, old-fashioned husband, digging for the light she knew was in him.
“Yeah,” he answered honestly. “Joanne and Andrew are really good cooks, and they got me a new broom. Are you going out for Ravenclaw’s Quidditch team next year?”
“Next one?”
Harry smiled. “Such a caretaker my Daddy is.” Harry was also grateful because he wasn’t sure if he could walk after all that, legs like gelatin. So he waited for Draco to get up and scoop him up bridal-style, beginning their walk to the bathroom.
“But she could leave the house to take a call,” argued Draco. “And honestly, if this ‘Brooke’ really is looking after her father then he owes her, not the other way around. She’s a committed enough daughter to watch after him, so he should be committed enough to accept her for liking women.”
“We will send your gifts on your birthday!” Narcissa called after Draco as he took Harry to the fireplace in the entrance parlor.
“Quite the flirt, aren’t you, Harry?” Draco replied in his most gentle of teasing, which for most was still pretty strong. “What is to be done about that?”
Harry poured himself a shot and took it down just as quickly, making a little face before putting the shot glass down. “That’s a glowing review.”
Draco rolled his eyes before returning to sit on his bed.
“A threesome with another man,” she reminded him gently. For a horrifying moment, she sounded like her mother trying to coax her father into eating whole-grain breakfast cereal.
“Harry James Potter,” Draco started and Harry gasped, hands flying to cover his mouth and the shock. “Every day with you has been the best of my life. I can’t imagine a world without you, without us, sweet boy. I want to make you stupidly, deliriously happy for the rest of our lives together. I want a life together—I want you. Would you make me the luckiest man alive and marry me?”
Grace swallowed her nerves. “I apologize. I didn’t mean to inconvenience you.”
It could best be summed up as: Draco felt guilty and uncomfortable, but he wished he didn’t.
“You have a lovely home,” Draco tried, leaning on his proper pureblood training. Nevermind how he’d called the place a dirty hovel for all seven years of school. It was nicer than he imagined it to be back then and now though and he wasn’t lying, so that had to count for something. “And everything smells delicious.”
"Who cares! You were going to fuck the guy with gauges and that's gross and you need to get higher standards," Draco concluded, crossing his arms.
“You won’t snitch on me,” Draco declared confidently. He gave Harry’s arse a hard squeeze. “You fancy me too much.”
Draco froze. “
A startling thought hit her in the present. She was an
“Yes, I saw it laying out ever so inconspicuously,” Harry replied with a sardonic grin. He twirled some spaghetti onto his fork and sampled his work. He hummed too, quite pleased with himself. “The cookbook was appreciated, though.”
“Mary!” Kennedy shouted from the door. “Come inside, I’ll drive you back to your house.”
“Open your mouth,” Draco ordered and Harry did so without hesitation only to find it filled with two of Draco’s fingers. Harry made an appreciative noise and began sucking on them before Draco could even instruct him to. “So eager.”
Draco blushed. He had said that, hadn’t he? And Merlin help him, he’d meant it.
“Healer Malfoy!” someone shouted outside his office door, one intern or another. They were a rotating cast of young faces that turned to mostly disgust whenever in Draco’s presence. Such was the legacy his parents had lain for him and he had indeed followed along with in Hogwarts. Draco liked to think he was changing, becoming a better wizard and a better human more importantly, but he was hardly going to go grovel to the likes of them for forgiveness for what he did when his life and parent’s lives were threatened.
Harry took the reins on talking this time around. People who were just being introduced to Draco’s sense of humor often perceived it as cruel when in reality it used to be much, much crueler. Harry had an advantage in that department—knowing Draco’s past behavior was even worse made this snarky, sort of bitchy Draco look like an angel.
“Erm.” What the hell was she supposed to say?
“Did you notice anything strange about the way she was acting with my dad?”
“Why?” replied the victim of the Catfish. Next to her, Harry sat slack-jawed for another mute moment before standing beside Kennedy and putting a protective hand on her shoulder.
“You have an Imperius on your record, Malfoy,” snarled the Auror holding his left arm, twisting it slightly. Draco braced his face to be stony and not show the pain.
“Harry, the Aurors involved in the incident with you and Ron are sworn to secrecy,” she assured him, not yet having touched her meal, eyes fixed on Harry unflinchingly. “You know that.”
“No, it’s in the bones.”
“Maybe I am,” Harry retaliated, undoing his vest and button-down so he could join Draco in the nude. “No homo, though.”
“I wish we had more time to talk about how you got into this,” Draco admitted. “But shouldn’t we be getting to your parents’ house?”
“Now, there’s another matter we have to resolve.”
“Yeah,” Harry finally responded. “I am. I have Draco, a new house, and soon a new baby.” Well, they had a new baby if the father stayed out of court. Lucius would utilize his full arsenal and wallet to prove ‘Zeke’ an unfit father, but Harry couldn’t help but worry that the courts would rather see a child with its biological parent than with a gay couple.
“Kingsley’s the best we’ve seen in a long while.” Arthur raised his glass in praise. Being a Ministry worker was never easy, but it was especially shameful during the war. Things had gotten so out of hand.
Those were the magic words.
Oh, what the hell. Harry was perpetually bored, tired, sad, and listless—where had that Gryffindor bravery gone? Had the Sorting Hat got it wrong? Psyching himself up through self-antagonism seemed to be working, stoking that old anger he hadn’t touched in years.
Ron and Harry lucked out on which house they checked first in regard to Marcus’ ‘friend’. At first, Harry had been worried about that referring to Malfoy Manor, but it was only slightly better in that it referred to the Parkinson Mansion.
Draco and Harry were lucky without even knowing it, faking smiles for the cameras when they were caught in shots of Ruth admiring the flashing lights and advertisements. They were escorting a charming, beautiful young lady through the city, and it was her first time seeing it.
“Do the lights in that room turn off?” Lucius asked again.
“You’re welcome, and I’ll have you know I don’t talk to anyone about sex,” he informed him as he placed the meals down in the dining room. Draco got the head of the table, and Harry to his right. “For many reasons. The first being that I don’t have a lot of it, past week and a half excluded, and the second that my best friends are like my siblings.”
Harry glared with no malice, suppressing a laugh. “Is it weird to say I have a newfound respect for women? I mean, I’ve always respected women, but this shit is hard. Drag queens, too. Basically anyone who works in heels,” Harry pondered aloud, getting to the second floor and moving up the next flight of stairs without stopping.
Her green eyes locked on the cake as it stood there naked—taunting her.
The red tone Harry’s darker skin had taken on only deepened as Draco spoke. “Yes, Daddy,” Harry admitted, sparks of sensation climbing up his body with how Draco was starting to move. “Even before I knew what this was, when we were just kids I—I wanted you so badly. I never thought I could actually have you. You’re too,” Harry searched for the word, a harder task than he’d thought it would be with dick in his arse. “You’re just too special for me.”
“Don’t be. Your heart’s in the right place, yeah?” Ron told him. “And we don’t have to talk to him today or tomorrow. The last thing I’d want is to bother him while he’s already literally torn himself to pieces.”
“Because he’s so progressive,” Aubrey tried to explain.
“Wait,” Pansy interrupted, taking a moment to look at Maggie. “This is the first time that all of us are in a relationship. Every single one of us.”
“When was I such a musical fanatic? When the hell did that movie even come out?” Sirius asked with a laugh to try and get the conversation away from dead James and dead Lily and dead Wormtail.
“Hmmm,” Draco hummed and had it turn to a moan with how tight Harry still was after all of this work to open him. Draco was closing in on his orgasm though he wished he wasn’t—he wanted this moment to last forever, to always be the one fucking Harry Potter so hard he offered
a good idea.” Narcissa threw her bothered husband a look before he finally got a grip on the peahen’s stomach and lifted up. “There. You know, my great-great grandfather used to hunt fowl. It’s a shame that it’s not as popular today,” Lucius bragged in the snooty way that only a Malfoy could. “Anyway, I’ve searched far and wide for a perfect hen for the peacocks.”
“Sorry,” Ron stopped him. “Didn’t mean to put you on the spot; it’s okay. I think that’s answer enough for me, mate.” A slow smile came to his lips. “Harry, I just want you to be happy, that’s all.”
“How’s that for a happy ending?” Harry asked, cheeky as ever now that he’d heard Draco say it in return. Twice! He was over the moon, hands stroking Draco’s soft face.
