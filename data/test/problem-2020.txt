"Deal," Harry grins. "Although I think I know what Hermione is going to say..." he adds after noticing the look on her face.
"Right. Well, now that that's out of the way," Harry says briskly, adjusting his glasses. "Can I hug you now?"
"Nothing." he says too quickly, turning back to the front of the hall so that she won't catch on. It can be a curse and a blessing to have a friend as perceptive as Hermione.
It's a muggle song; the quality of the sound is tinny and the blare of the brass instruments distorts and warps but the woman's quivering, hope-laden voice rings out defiantly in spite of it, the song managing to evoke both sorrow and optimism with its promise of meeting again in better circumstances.
Harry had worried that Draco might not want to continue after their disastrous first lesson but he'd shown up for the next one his usual thorny self but without another word about it. In fact, they haven't spoken about Lucius again at all, the only change in their routine is that Draco has approached these lessons freshly invigorated. Airing his feelings towards his father has helped some, has pushed him into finding deeper pools of determination he didn't think himself capable of. He's made headway with confronting the boggart but he can never seem to push back hard enough. In the end, the boggart always gets the better of him.
Draco lifts his head in time to see a glowing stag erupt from Harry's wand tip, marvelling at the form as it gallops a graceful arc around the Astronomy Tower. Harry's face is serene as he steers the Patronus out and over the ledge, allowing it to run against the backdrop of the jewelled sky.
"STOP!" Harry leaps out from behind his cover, not for a second thinking about the fact he's rushing to
Harry hadn’t been able to say anything at all, the truth of Draco’s words undeniable, the prickling discomfort at the thought of the Manor too fresh. He had nodded instead, they were in agreement, and that had contented Draco enough that he turned to watch the view so that the rest of their journey was spent in companionable silence.
"You'll think of something." Ginny says confidently, a smile in her voice. So sure of him that he has to blink away at the prickling in his eyes. "You always do."
say yes?" he breathes, grey eyes jumping between Harry's. Harry can probably count every small freckle on Draco's cheekbones if he was inclined to do so.
On cue, Draco flushes bright red and grows aware of Harry standing behind the trunk, his gaze shifting minutely beyond the boggart, wide-eyed and aghast to realise that Harry is hearing his worst thoughts pulled violently into reality.
"Nothing." Draco says quickly with a shake of his head, turning his attention to the gargoyle. He lightly butts the toe of his shoe against the statue. "I can't believe I'm saying this but let's just get this over with and shout passwords at it until it lets us in."
. Potter laughs so hard that he has to cling to the railing to keep from falling over. He laughs so much that he has to wipe tears from his eyes. Draco tries to take it with good grace.
For a second, the air between them is thick, dangerous with static. Ron's lips, smeared ruby red with drying blood, part as if he's about to hit back, the tangy taste of cruel words already on his tongue - but then, it's as if he becomes unplugged. The anger seems to zap out of him quicker than it came on. He balls up what's left of his bloody tissue and they all watch it zip across the length of the room until it wings its way into the wide mouth of the bin with a revolting splat.
Draco looks as shocked as Harry feels, his face grey at the sight of it, then panic consumes his features as he returns his focus on forcing the boggart back into its trunk.
"Really?" Hermione says when he's finished, sitting up straighter with interest, Crookshanks squirming in annoyance at the movement. Harry can practically hear the cogs in her head clunking into action. "A boggart?"
on the rare occasions when she invites me into her parlour, it's as if I'm as far away as the clouds - untouchable but not in the best sense of the word. I feel like I'm constantly trying to - to swim back down to earth but I keep getting sucked back up into the sky."
When Harry's feet hit the ground again - softer than the platform, difficult to find purchase or steady footing - he staggers from beneath Draco's touch, gulping cold air to keep the nausea at bay. He has to brace his hands against his knees, staring down at the gravel beneath his shoes and hoping he won't vomit.
Even as he says the words, the doors burst open and Professor Sprout is leading in a crowd of nervous first years. He can't imagine how they must be feeling; they've probably heard countless stories about the battle, of what happened in this very room. To walk into such a hall bearing banners which commemorate lost students and staff, to be confronted by hundreds of watchful faces, to know that something monumental had taken place on the very ground they are walking over must make Hogwarts appear more formidable than it already is on first sight.
He reaches for his backpack, cast off into the bottom of the empty wardrobe. He'd never gotten around to unpacking his things for their short stay. The hair on the back of his neck tells him that Draco is watching as he rummages through the bag, up to his elbow in scattered magazines and a cascade of socks before his hand finally closes on crinkled paper.
"If you're talking about Snape killing Dumbledore, then it was all planned. Dumbledore was always meant to die - "
"If you is sure, sir." Ploddy says. Then - "I is hearing from the Hogwarts house-elves that you is a great wizard. It is an honour to meet you."
Draco's height offers him an advantage in their walk. Harry would be hard-pressed to keep up with this insistent stride if not for the skeletal hand on his forearm and dragging him mercilessly down twilight lit corridors to who knows where. Somewhere, Ron is probably having fits over the Marauder's Map at the sight of Harry and Draco venturing farther and farther from the classroom.
Harry is nauseated thinking about it. To be so scared of your own father as to use him as a weapon against others? No wonder Draco can be flinty, no wonder he can so often be guarded. Harry had never held any illusions about the Dursley's, he'd always known that they were repulsed by him but he can't begin to imagine the push and pull of a father who loved you at one moment and despised you the next, the sort of effect that that can have on your frame of mind.
Hermione thankfully lets it slide, "It must be tough for him being here after everything." she offers diplomatically, scratching a purring Crookshanks behind the ears.
"I think it's incredibly smart of her to focus on being united." Hermione says, neatly spiralling spaghetti around her fork. "There's more to rebuilding than just stone and wood; we're rebuilding our society.  After being fractured for so long, I think starting afresh and together is the most important thing right now."
“Right,” Ron says with an air of decisiveness, brushing himself down of bread crumbs and bacon bits. “That’s enough weird stuff for today. Who’s ready for Charms?”
"Before you answer, let me just say this; I did all of this because you seem hellbent on wheedling your way into my life and - and I've not the energy to stop you anymore. I have no one else to ask, otherwise I would just - I know the Manor holds memories for you that you'd rather forget. It's bad enough that I have to - well, never mind that. What I'm trying to say is, don't say you'll come out of your insufferable do-gooder complex. I think you deserve more than that and - and maybe so do I."
Harry starts; he shifts on his heels and finds Malfoy's rangy frame braced in the doorway but he's paying Harry little attention. He's staring at the gramophone in revulsion.
He'd even been allowed to return to Hogwarts to resume his final year, much to the outrage of his peers - that is, except Potter. Potter, who had immediately shown him such kindness that Draco was loathe to return it. Until - bewilderingly - he had started to, all against his will. Draco bets Granger and Weasley weren't keen on the peculiar turn of events either, especially when Potter started insisting on them all
"I wasn't going to say that." Harry tells him, aghast, moving closer so that they're almost shoulder to shoulder at the railing. "I just think that it's pretty sad for you, being left alone like that. You're respecting her wishes but who's looking after yours?"
my name, after all." he adds haughtily, as if momentarily forgetting that his purpose in life is to be mean to Harry Potter.
Now, though - now, it is as if Draco has finally found his soul again. He glows before Harry's eyes, nimble fingers grasping the hilt of his wand like he is prising Excalibur itself from stubborn rock.
"I dunno, Professor Vector must have left these records here. I thought they'd - " Harry stops. He'd thought they would do what, exactly? Help the mood? Break the tension? Ease them into this unfathomable situation they've somehow landed themselves in? He shuts the music off, the quiet loud in his ears, feeling foolish. "Well, forget about it. Where have you been!?"
Harry jumps and thumps his head off the ceiling, swearing violently as he spins to find Draco hitched up against the wall by the doorway. Somewhere in his time attending to duties, he'd shed the coat and gone as far as to undo the top few buttons of his shirt. The sight of him arrests Harry, Draco's long limbs arranged effortlessly so that he gives the outward appearance of being utterly at leisure.
Harry's breathing is loud to even his own ears. The vice-like grip on his arm finally disappears and Harry staggers away, rubbing furiously at the place where Draco's hand had slowly started to cut off circulation. He flexes his fingers and catches Draco watching him in the act.
"What? No - no. He's just struggling to overcome his fear, he can never get past the image of his dad."
"I trust that you both know that discretion is key." she says, not bothering to lift her eyes from the parchment. "I would appreciate it if you kept this between yourselves. See to it that you behave responsibly."
And that's it. No little joke, as Dumbledore may have done. No announcements for the coming year. When McGonagall returns to her place, there is an array of reactions. Some of the older students who fought in the battle are softly weeping for their fallen friends, some clap and cheer as loud as they can, others simply have no idea how to react to the words at all, dazedly staring about the room.
"I show up to class, don't I?! Hermione, all I wanted to do was look over your notes to see if I missed anything out in my own. It's hardly cheating, is it?"
"Oh, but if I did something right I would be praised and spoilt beyond my dreams. He'd buy me whatever I wanted on those days, he'd boast about me to his friends. I often hoped for days like those, Potter, that my father would look at me and everything would feel
Being here though, where some of the students are young enough to have been spared of the fight, the atmosphere is tangible yet ineffable. Many can walk the halls and see just that - light spilling through archways and unmarked stone, just another empty classroom - but others recall the harrowing memories of unmoving bodies and nearby screams, of prowling Death Eaters in their skeletal masks.
The removal and usage of his wand until absolutely necessary was their main demand but Draco had accepted it with a level of good grace that had stunned Harry at the time; to have his wand unceremoniously taken from him at the gates by a Ministry official in front of other students, to know that it was to be kept securely in McGonagall's office except for lessons. Harry remembers losing his own wand, the ugly sensation of feeling vulnerable in the wizarding world without it. His fingers grip around the wand a little tighter.
Hermione frowns some more but doesn't say another word about it because she's intuitive enough to know when to press and when to leave well alone.
“I would say it was more of a poor reflection on myself rather than you,” Draco tells him in a murmur, smiling slightly. “Besides, you
“It made me feel loved. Wanted,” Harry admits, face scrunching. “That’s weird, isn’t it? It’s definitely weird.”
department of all places? Harry doubts that he's turned over a new leaf to be exploring the Muggle way of life. At night. By himself. He'd been wandering around on his own like this before when he'd slipped quietly to the Vanishing Cabinet and let in Voldemort's most loyal.
Draco takes a deep breath in, turning to Ron. “The sentiment extends to you also, Weasley. I should have said this sooner but I am deeply sorry.”
"No offence but it's hard to imagine your dad as someone who could inspire love." Harry cuts in, remembering every encounter he's ever had with Lucius Malfoy, in the flesh or boggart.
"Exactly," she agrees with a small, satisfied smile. "I can't give it to Mr. Malfoy so I'm giving it to you instead, Potter. I'm entrusting
Harry snorts, tipping his head back so that Draco can see his Adam's apple bob. He's smaller than Draco by about a head, which was funny really because if Draco had been told about the Boy Who Lived, he'd have pictured him, well...taller, sturdier looking. Potter was always fairly weedy though, from the first time they met he'd looked in sore need of a good meal and some clothing that actually fit. Everything he wears makes it seem like he's swimming in fabric, makes him look even smaller than he probably is. Even the shirt on his back had sleeves that rode down to his elbows and somehow, Potter doesn't care a jot about it.
The journey down to the first floor - Mrs. Norris now safely removed to the dungeons - is uneventful. The peacefulness of the corridors shouldn't concern him the way it does but the last time the school had been this silent, people were attending to the injured and dead in the Great Hall. Harry wonders if Hogwarts will ever look the same to him again; can he ever separate the terrible things that had happened here from the place where he finally found a home after the neglect of Privet Drive?
"Ready, Potter?" Draco asks with some hint of trepidation just as the train begins to slowly chug away, thankfully taking with it their ogling peers.
"Good game then?" Harry asks, shaking the magazine to dispel the careless, pink tinged water drops that have fallen from Ron's inquisitive face.
"You're a blemish on our family name." Lucius berates, his hand always gripping the hilt on his concealed wand like a lingering threat. "I'm sick of cleaning up after your mistakes..."
A delicate cough cuts off Hermione’s lament over Ron’s laziness. All three of them look up as a unit, as synchronised as Fluffy the three-headed dog, to find Draco hovering self-consciously behind Harry.
"It's alright, Hermione. I get it." Harry says calmly, wading into the conversation to lull the tension beginning to brew. "This thing with Draco, I know that he has it in him. I just wish I could help him with this bit."
"Told you he'd forget." Ron mumbles to Hermione. "We wanted to talk the other day? When you went running off after Malfoy again, remember?" Ron asks, lightly rapping his knuckles against Harry's head.
complicates things and we should be focusing on the boggart lessons but it's turned into something more, something bigger than that." Harry explains; how else can he say it? How else can he describe these new feelings stirring within him? "Right now, what Draco needs most is a friend and - well - that's sort of what I am to him."
After that, Harry has no time to even worry about what he's going to do about the Draco situation. Christmas is mere days away so they've put a hold on their boggart lessons to focus on all the work that the teachers are heaping on them. Harry feels so swamped with essays and revision that frankly, trying to make sense of his emotions for his former enemy-turned-reluctant student-turned-sort of acquaintance would be too much to handle.
Harry hitches his bag higher, feeling under dressed in his trainers and jeans in spite of his better judgement when they come through into the cavernous entrance hall.
"That's positively medieval." Draco says with disgust. It takes a moment for Harry's brain to translate the anger bubbling behind Draco's eyes as something directed at his aunt and uncle, and not at Harry himself. "Merlin, Potter, no wonder you have the look of a wilted flower about you."
"You lack any subtlety, Potter." Draco surmises with obvious discomfort, shifting in his seat. His poker face is breathtakingly terrible, so much so that Harry can't believe he'd managed to pull the wool over so many people's eyes for the past few years. Harry can read him as clearly as a book. "Everybody is staring."
Draco lets Harry tow him by the arm, a mad dash across the Astronomy Tower roof as Filch's wheezing voice starts to call out. Draco's head was spinning. Between pants, he manages to squeeze out a few words.
Harry is all too aware of his continued chewing in the otherwise silent room, he might as well be gnawing on rocks for all the sound he's making with his mouth. Draco is - or is pretending to be - unperturbed by the lack of conversation, the typically mean angles of his body turned slack from exhaustion. He's draped across his chair like a discarded cloak.
"How was your time alone with Malfoy, anyway?" Ron pipes up, squelching his way to the settee. "Have yourselves a nice little chat?"
, a menace who had blagged his way through school due to the influence of his infamous father. His trial had been reported in minute detail, barely a day went by where his name was not printed side by side with Harry's. Comparisons between the glaring differences in their traits had been continuously made, none of them in Malfoy's favour.
Hermione tuts, waving her wand to siphon the worst of the mud from Ron's robes. "Ron, don't tip your head back like that, hold it forward - and they're not
It doesn't feel right having told Hermione and Ron about Draco's boggart, especially to be discussing it so flippantly; it feels like a gross intrusion of privacy. Harry knows they're his friends - that they would do almost anything for him - but letting them in on Draco's secret savours too much of a betrayal. He doesn't owe Malfoy anything so why does he feel like this?
"Please, father!" Draco whines, his entire body trembling. Draco's hands are hooked onto the tops of his thighs like claws, fingers digging into his legs hard enough to draw blood. "Please."
When the last scraps of dinner are cleared away and pudding has been all but demolished, Harry pushes the crust of his treacle tart around on the shining plate in deliberation. He doesn't look up when he speaks.
But I will try my best! I totally used to do this all the time. Surely it's still in me to do it, right?
The Map springs to life, clusters of sleeping dots gathered in dormitories and offices materialising like spilt splotches of ink. Harry can't deny it, the dream has spooked him. He peruses the Map, watching for any signs of movement, irrationally looking out for the names of Death Eaters out of sheer paranoia.
Harry can't stand to hear much more for Draco's sake and steps into the path of the boggart, giving it no time to draw out the cries of his mother or the bright green flash that haunts his dreams to this day. With a deftness that only endless practicing can bring on, he easily overpowers the boggart and guides it back into the safety of the trunk, the latch securing itself back into place so that all the boggart can do is trash about on the inside of its prison.
Draco's foot taps out an impatient rhythm on the stone floor. "We're not talking about Weasley though, are we?"
Draco whizzes by overhead, dropping an apple so vibrantly green into Harry's waiting hands that it makes his eyes water.
"You always ruffle the back of your hair." Ron informs him sagely, his smirk immensely smug. "It's like a nervous reaction."
"Something like that..." Harry mutters under his breath; he briefly ponders over the idea of calling out to McGonagall until she comes down but that's no good, they could be here for hours. Harry runs both hands through his hair over and over again as he thinks, a side effect of stress that he's yet to break out of; he's starting to worry that he'll be bald by twenty if he keeps it up. When he glances across to ask for Malfoy's opinion on getting through, he catches him already staring back, lips slightly parted as if he's been Stunned. "What?"
I am soooo sorry that this has taken the longest time to post. So sorry, hope you all enjoy, love you loads.
"I - I try my best - " Draco whispers fearfully to the boggart, face taut. A muscle jumps in his jaw and he's eyeing the door like he's deciding whether it will be worth bolting for.
SIDE NOTE: I don't want to get caught up in negativity but I do want to take a moment to mention something. I'm not a perfect writer. In the past, I've written fics for characters who were already friends and didn't have as complicated a history as Harry + Draco + Ron + Hermione have. This was me trying something new out; I started this a few years ago and, rather naively, didn't plan a tremendous amount outside of a basic outline for each chapter and some random scenarios that I wrote chapters around. Needless to say, the ideas I had for this fic didn't totally translate onto paper (well, screen) and I'm very sorry for that.
They come to a halt and Harry dimly recognises it as the very trophy room Draco had once suggested as the location for the wizard's duel which served as a ploy to get Harry and Ron into trouble with Filch. That time seems so innocent to Harry now. Had Draco known all along that they were headed here, was it an unconscious decision or was it a reminder of the things which once felt so important in their small spheres, ignorant to what lay ahead?
Draco storms over to retrieve his wand, surprising Harry by dropping down onto his hands and knees to stuff one arm into the dark gap beneath the book shelf, his face obscured by the crook of his elbow.
Yet when Draco was free of his responsibilities, he often came to Harry. He seemed to have a particular knack for tracking him down no matter what corner of the grounds Harry had disappeared off to and it was -
"Sorry, Professor. I was wondering whether we could get your permission for something?" Harry says, figuring the best approach is to be direct in the purpose of their visit.
"Ron, you can give Harry a blow-by-blow after you've cleaned yourself up." Hermione calls, climbing in through the portrait hole with a glowering, soaked Ginny in tow. "You're making a mess."
"Do-you-miss-it." Draco repeats, enunciating each word slowly for Harry's benefit. He raises the thin silver sliver of his eyebrow, waiting for awareness to colour Harry's voice.
Ron harrumphs as he shucks off his sodden robes and dumps them in a dirty pile in front of the fire, sharing a look of dark jealousy with his sister.
"I can't just pretend that none of it happened," Draco snaps. "Black was actually innocent of the crimes he'd been accused of. I did all of those things. I was
There isn't much; he spots Mrs. Norris patrolling the lower corridor on the first floor, then there's Peeves zipping around the fourth floor boy's bathroom causing who knows what sort of mischief.
Harry slides off the bed, motioning for Draco to stay put. "While you're here, I have something for you - "
"Yes." Draco simply says in response to the question, levelling a steady gaze at Harry. He makes no other allusions for Harry's benefit, switching topics without bothering to be subtle. "Let's get out of here. I've had Ploddy arrange an informal dinner in your room for us. It hardly seems worth preparing the dining room for a party of two. I - I presumed you'd be happier that way?"
How can Lucius Malfoy be here? He should be under lock and key in Azkaban. Harry glances over his shoulder, pure terror tricking him into seeing the crumbling rows of headstones of the Little Hangleton graveyard, the glassy-eyed expression on Cedric's face illuminated by the cool blue of a portkey. He squeezes his eyes shut and open again, relief flooding through him when the illusion fades and there is nothing besides a school room empty of all but desks.
It was a cruel brag, what Voldemort had hoped would be the final word on Harry Potter’s life. It had been a necessity to play along, to let all who he cared for believe he had truly been killed. To see it here makes him feel as if he is untethered from his body, witnessing what they had, the surreal horror of it.
"Even after everything, will you still not call me by my name?" Harry asks quietly. “Have we really not moved on from that by now?”
As they slip and leap from step to step, Harry's hand steadying him as they spiral deeper down into the castle, Draco reckons that he's right. Maybe for a long time now, he's been chasing that thrill in the hope that it would let him catch up.
It's deserted, a chill in the room, the last sparks of warmth from the dying fire close to sputtering out entirely, enough to make Harry shiver in his now damp bed-clothes. He takes a seat in his favourite squishy armchair near the fireplace to soak up what little heat he can and raps his wand against the parchment of the Map, burying his chin into the collar of his jumper.
accident." Harry emphasises, dodging the playful kick swinging his way from Ron when he leaps up from his stool. Hermione is practically beaming from ear to ear, reaching across to press a hand against Harry's arm.
"There's always going to be bad people, that's true." Harry agrees, leaning over the side of his armchair to grab Ron's free hand. "Voldemort is dead and there's no way we can know whether someone else down the line will take up his mantel. But that doesn't mean we stop trying. It doesn't mean that we can become cynical or that we should, I dunno, shut ourselves off from other people because we're scared. If we did that, we'd be just like them."
"Wouldn't be a stretch of the imagination though, would it?" Harry says in way of an admission. "You're not exactly chuffed to be here."
"Let me ask you something," Draco says suddenly, lacking the courage to turn and look Harry in the eyes. He supposes that's why he's in Slytherin and Potter wound up a Gryffindor, perhaps confronting people and looking at them is just one of those brave things Gryffindors do. Potter is always staring into his face like he's trying to pull out Draco's soul from his eyes. "Why are you so nice to me?"
"It's Weasley, sir." Ron interjects a little heatedly, heedless of Hermione desperately trying to tug his singed robes off his shoulders. "I only bloody went and helped defeat You-Know-Who, not like that should be enough to remember my name or anything..." he adds in a dark undertone.
The action had been careless - automatic - but Harry doesn't require the reminder that Voldemort's threat is still felt. He'd been presumed dead before now, it would be a hard thing to expect the wizarding community to completely accept that truth.
"No, it's not." Draco agrees bemusedly. "Yet I find myself wanting to tell you all the same. My mother became sick to death of people. If I'm to tell you the truth, she was never fond of company to begin with but after - after
to find ruin wherever he goes, had buried itself in his brain like a seed years ago and finally bloomed into something incapacitating after Voldemort's death. The reason for his sleepless nights, the nightmares, the lingering trepidation that flares up if he's left to his thoughts long enough. The cruel irony that he should be always looking over his shoulder now that danger is behind him.
"It's just - it's hard. I'm so tired of being gawped at." Harry confesses, expecting a biting remark from Draco for that. When none is forthcoming, he ploughs on. "But yeah - yeah, I miss it. I
“It wasn’t just the thought of getting my wand back. I thought it would be a joke. I thought you would lure me to a classroom on my own and, I don’t know, shame me so thoroughly for everything that I’ve done that I would run back to Malfoy Manor again with my tail between my legs. I
"Okay, it's time to talk." Ron orders, shepherding Harry over to a chair and pushing him forcibly into it.
"For fuck's sake, Potter." Draco swears in exasperation, bone-white hands grasping the straps of his bag as if it's the only thing keeping him hinged to control. "I thought I told you to leave me alone."
The boggart can’t find the gap in the hood, it seems to have stitched itself shut. It trips against the edge of the upturned trunk, falling backwards into it so that the trunk rights itself. With a wave of his wand, Harry sends the lid crashing down, the lock clicking neatly into place.
words in my father's mouth and I near killed myself to achieve that end, lest my entire family be murdered in their own beds."
They hold still, ears straining, listening to the unmistakable sound of heavy footsteps echoing up a stone staircase.
Draco's eyes flit up to Harry's and back down to the offered wand, crossing the room in three strides.
Draco jolts, lifting his eyes from the still rattling trunk. His hairline is itching from perspiration and he's thoroughly annoyed that Harry always looks at him like he's someone to be pitied. "Oh, fuck off. Spare me of that rubbish, Potter."
Not liking the idea of being confined to one room with only his thoughts to occupy him, Harry decides to retrace his steps, figuring it'd be better to at least get a handle of the Manor's extensive corridors and shadowy rooms than limit himself to relying on Draco to shuttle him around.
Harry spins on the spot, hands braced against the walls either side of him, the close confines of the spiral stairway seeming to shrink in further when those green eyes pierce Draco's own, all wide and sickeningly concerned. Draco nearly falls backwards just to give himself some breathing room.
With nothing else to do but wait, he takes to inspecting the room to divert the peculiar combination of boredom and nerves; he peruses the complicated charts pinned to the walls and finds himself newly relieved that he hadn't let Hermione talk him into taking Arithmancy back in third year, unable to appreciate her enthusiasm for the subject. He inspects the old engravings from students past on the even older desks. He - perhaps a trifle childishly - doodles the clumsy shape of a snitch onto the corner of the chalkboard, and when he checks the time to see it is now a clear half hour from when Malfoy was supposed to arrive, he half contemplates resigning himself to the idea of being stood up and the strangely crushing disappointment at the acknowledgement.
and after my father's imprisonment, she simply gave up bending to the will of society and chose solitude over judgement. She chose an easy road and I don't blame her for that."
Draco laughs coldly despite the burgeoning hysteria threatening to make its unwelcome appearance. "I've barely seen my mother. She stays locked up in her room most of the time. It's not been easy for her, facing so much scrutiny..."
Draco leads Harry up the staircase, thickly and luxuriously carpeted but clearly in need of a clean. Draco picks up on the object of Harry's attention, naturally.
"Because I know you," Harry says with confidence, tipping his head back against the wall so that he can match Draco's stare with ease. He surveys him beneath heavy lids, rather enjoying the slow flush of red creeping into Draco's complexion, the twitch in his jaw that lets Harry know he is right. "I know how badly you want your wand back. I know that whatever is going on, you're desperate to beat that boggart and at the moment, that's more important to you than hating me."
Harry doesn't even want to begin getting into that with her. He's already backing out the door, his answer trailing off as he slips around the corner. "Oh - uh - yeah, real great - yeah. I should probably get going. I have Potions and Professor Slughorn will be wondering where I am, so...uh..."
Draco’s eyes are bright as a laugh erupts from him. It’s tinged through with some hysterical edge, some emotion dwelling too deeply inside Draco for Harry to guess at.
Slughorn's disregard of Ron hits a nerve with Harry. It's the same sort of attitude which had incensed Ron only a few years prior; his fear of being overlooked has always been something Harry has struggled to relate to. Harry, who had spent his former years desperately wishing to be ignored by the Dursley's and later on, the whole wizarding world. Harry, who still remains a constant spot of attention in the public's awareness regardless of what he does. Just because Harry can't relate to Ron's struggle doesn't mean that it isn't valid.
Draco is trying to appear collected. He moves to the edge with shaky legs, leaning heavily against the railing so that he can peer down into the darkness below. It's hard to imagine the boy he was on that night where everything came together in the worst possible way. Hard to shake off the memory of Albus Dumbledore softly talking to him, words carried along on a breeze, gentle and calm as if a frenzied Draco hadn't been pointing a trembling wand at him.
Draco goes as still as a statue, then slowly allows his tensed muscles to relax. A conscious effort, Harry realises.
“What? Enemy?” Harry shakes his head again. "I reckon that stopped being true a long time ago, Draco. Maybe longer than either of us thought. I’m not good, I’m not a hero. Right now, in this room, I'm finally just Harry," he says. "And you're just Draco."
“Oh, cut him some slack, Hermione. Poor bloke needed that lie in,” Ron speaks up, biting into his third bacon sandwich. “It’s nice to be on this side of one of your lectures though. It’s invigorating.”
Ron harrumphs, wiggling further down into his armchair so that he can kick his feet up onto the foot-rest, sending a few discarded Fizzing Whizzbees there flying onto the carpet. He looks down at Harry on the floor and raises an eyebrow, a conspirative "
Harry, ever the diplomat, shrugs. "I think magic is brilliant but I'm definitely with Hermione on the middle ages front."
It isn't a demand, it's an opportunity for him to slip away to the common room if he wanted to. He stares at his friend, at the concern in her brown eyes and the way she's twisting a curl around and around her finger, to the well deserved Head Girl pin secured neatly into the folds of her school robes. He knows that she's just as scared as he is - Ron, too - and finds a genuine smile tentatively creeping onto his face. Smiles have been hard to come by, these days.
"Er - yeah." Harry mumbles sheepishly, knowing full well that they had in fact been chatting quite a bit. "We're getting there..."
They’d parted somewhat awkwardly but warmly in the entrance hall, Draco headed for the dungeons and Harry for the seventh floor, with the arrangement to meet for their first boggart lesson of the year that next day. With his wand now in his possession, Draco’s determination to overcome his fear had seemed to triple.
"Potter, you are the reason why the rest of us get to live freely. Do you think I'd be here having this chat with you if you'd not defeated the Dark Lord? If you'd not saved my life?" Draco says sharply. "Things go wrong around you because other people are
Hermione leans forward in her seat, restlessly rubbing the palms of her hands together as she surveys the room.
The sound of gossip - growing steadily louder like rainfall - dawns on Harry. He notices Draco isn't ignorant to it either, his knuckles white and body stiff as if he's exerting all his efforts to keep from crumpling in on himself. Whispers follow Harry like his shadow; by coming over here, he has burnt all of Draco's carefully cultivated anonymity to the ground.
Harry looks after Draco's retreating figure, then down to the broom still held in his tight grasp. He has to jog to catch up with Draco's long-legged stride, slipping on the frosted grass as they descend a slope.
At that moment, a young house-elf - Ploddy, Harry remembers - comes bounding around the corner. He's a far cry from how Dobby appeared when he served the Malfoy's. His uniform is pristine, a bright white pillowcase bearing the house-elf's name neatly embroidered in electric blue upon his breast. He's holding a sugar bowl in one hand and a tea cup in the other.
"I've heard that there's a custom when two people meet beneath mistletoe. I suppose it's slightly ironic that muggles also used to use it as a way to ward off witches..."
Harry jumps up too but his way is immediately blocked by Ron, finally free of Hermione's grip. She twists on the bench to look between them but Harry isn't getting any overtly concerning vibes from either of them. He doesn't let it slow him.
Draco lifts his wand, pointing it upward towards the wooden structure of the four poster bed. Leaves begin to sprout there, unfurling to reveal small white berries, a beautiful bow of red delicately twining itself around the stems of the plant. Mistletoe.
Something about the sight of him brings out an unprompted declaration from Draco; maybe Potter just has one of those faces you want to spill your secrets to.
"You don't need anything?" Draco speaks softly to his knees, a little awkward and stiff as if the day isn't going at all how he had imagined it and he has no prepared plan for this. "But there
Hermione’s eyes dart from Harry to Draco to Ron, utterly startled. Her reply comes as hesitantly as Draco’s address is to her, her tone cautious.
"Why do you do that?" he murmurs, tracing around the cardboard edges of the chocolate wrapper with his little finger. "Why do you always call me Draco?"
It turns out he's missed the entire ceremony while he was staring at Malfoy; the Sorting Hat has already been removed and McGonagall is stepping forward to address the school.
"Welcome back to Hogwarts," McGonagall begins, purveying the students with a tight smile. "A few words before the feast; this past year has been one of the hardest in Hogwarts - and indeed, wizarding - history. We have been broken and we have suffered a great deal of heartache."
Harry reaches for him then and despite his protestations, Draco falls easily into the encouraging pull. His fingers clench at Harry's forearms and pinch at the fabric of his shirt. They hold like that for a few beats, just looking at each other; Draco's eyes are wide as if he can hardly believe it, staring down into Harry's face like it's forging Draco's being afresh with every passing second.
Harry's head drops down to his chest, his eyes scrunching shut to ward off the threat of losing his composure altogether. Nobody had ever told him that grieving for people you'd grown used to being around and laughing with and talking to would be different to the way he grieved his parents. That sort of grief is different; his mother and father have always been a mystery to him, all he can ever do is imagine how they might have fitted into their vacant space in his small world. He could
"Well, maybe count to three next time!" Harry says, resurfacing to see Draco watching him with mild amusement, then the ever imposing childhood home of the Malfoy's looming just beyond him. "I, uh - don't remember there being so many gargoyles on your house..."
"Don't you see?" Harry asks in desperate murmurs, swiping away the prickling in his eyes for his friend's anguish but this needs to be said. "It was all an act - it's
They both glance out of the window then, watching the rain patter against glass. Harry finds himself longing for the snow back at Hogwarts, for some sort of Christmas cheer in this miserable place...
"I'll - just - my mother. " Draco stammers to Harry, growing more scarlet by the second, his moment of bravery already faded.
"You did that on purpose!" his gasp is thinly veiled amazement, clouds of hot smoking breath chug from his mouth like a steam train. "I'd no idea you Gryffindors had it in you."
"Muggles make do without magic in these situations all the time." Hermione points out, adjusting the purple bobble hat - one of her better attempts from the S.P.E.W. days - on her head. Harry, despite Ron's gentle ribbing, is wearing a matching one in dark green. "They'd have to shovel their way through this."
"Obviously I didn't mean like this! I meant asking someone if they're okay when you see them upset or - "
Harry snorts, nearly choking on a piece of broccoli. He takes the glass of water Ginny is sliding across to him and gulps half of it down. "No complaints from me there, mate. Going through it once was enough."
"I had no idea if I could do it..." Draco murmurs, more to himself than for Harry's ears. His eyes are prickling but he doesn't rub at them, he knows that it'll just draw more tears.
“The whole house felt like a tomb.” Harry says, chewing on the piece of slightly charred bread he’d toasted over the fire. “I don’t know how Draco stands it.”
"Would you prefer the Boy Who Lived, then?" Draco suggests, snapping his book shut. "Our noble saviour?"
There is where Ollivander had been slumped, haggard and only just alive. And there - the spot where Luna had emerged from the gloom, pale faced and astonished to see Harry. Then there came Dobby, a hopeful flash of a lifeline, appearing when Harry needed him, just as he always had. Harry glances around the dismal place, the sounds of Hermione's harrowing screams ringing faint in his ears, the remembered helplessness in him so acute that he has to shut his eyes against it.
"Just like that? I don't understand, Professor." Harry says, gazing at the wand as if it's a trap McGonagall has set out for them. "You just told us you couldn't give Draco his wand."
Harry reckons his best chance of catching Malfoy is just after dinner, where he's prone to slip away before pudding arrives so that he can beat the rest of the school out of the hall while they're distracted. It's not exactly the best plan, he highly doubts Draco will be thrilled at being cornered but he has no other choice - the boy just can't be found alone throughout the rest of the day.
“She loves you.” Draco surmises, cheeks suddenly glowing pink even in the blue light as if he’s given something away about himself.
Lucius's voice comes soft but undeniably piercing into the quiet room. Harry shudders at the sound, flinching against the memory of that voice goading him, demanding he hand over the prophecy at the Ministry.
Harry himself catches onto the infectious mood before too long, looking forward to a Christmas finally free of stress or trouble or the possibility of oncoming death. That is, until his friends ambush him in the common room one morning.
Draco doesn't even move, not really. He just leans in, grey eyes transfixed on Harry's mouth with an intensity as if he's lip-reading. Harry can tell that Draco means to make this count but is trying to understand how to do that and Harry, silently, hopelessly, urges him on until he can feel Draco's quiet, hot gasps on his lips.
As usual, sorry if this felt like a bit of a long wait! I've started a new job, I'm thinking of applying for a Master's so it's all a bit chaotic at the moment but I
"Harry, you must be out of your mind to want this." Draco chastises him and Harry grins, shoving at Draco’s shoulder before pulling him back in again. “You Gryffindors have no idea what’s good for you.”
"Pathetic," Lucius says smoothly, unsheathing the wand hidden within the cane, his resolve hardening. "It looks as if I'm going to have to show you what needs to be done."
Harry trembles, hair prickling beneath the sleeves of his hoody. Malfoy Manor had been bearable with Draco by his side but to walk without company lends the grand home a new, unnerving atmosphere. Harry no longer opens every door he passes, the portrait gallery losing all its former interest in the dark house growing darker with every minute the sun sets.
" at him to tease from behind his cauldron, grinning when Hermione catches sight of it and elbows Ron in the ribs. She's starting her lecture about the requirements of proper and respectful focus during brewing and the stories of countless wizards and witches who have injured themselves from goofing around over potions, and he's grateful to be slipping out of the classroom for a reprieve.
With the Christmas holidays fast approaching, the castle over-goes its magnificent festive transformation seemingly overnight. Hagrid outdoes himself with the trees; lush and green, enormous firs so heavily perfumed that the taste and smell of them linger on tongues and in nostrils long after leaving the Great Hall, groaning under streamers of silver and gold, baubles and bells that softly tinkle carols and play requested favourites.
UPDATE (currently 1st March): I am writing the next chapter! I don't know how else I can inform any of you who may read this fic but I
Ginny looks tired. She looks as tired as Harry feels. She contemplates his question, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear, and nods decisively.
"No, wait." Draco says quickly, looking awfully surprised at his own gall. He swallows hard, flushing a brilliant shade of pink. This, too, is something Harry has noticed of late; Draco is always quick to blush, often at odds with his barbed words. "You...can stay."
family. Narcissa is seated and straight backed in a rather austere chair, terribly beautiful. Lucius lurks behind her, positively glowering at his son coming to stand beside Harry. And between them? Draco. He's much younger than when Harry first lay eyes on him, maybe six or seven years old. Small, round eyed and chubby cheeked, peering out of the frame as if he already knows where his future lies and that he's powerless to stop it. Lucius's hand is a claw on the young Draco's shoulder, holding him back, reining him in with a swift tug.
They lapse into a silence - not comfortable by any means but endurable. For a few minutes, the only sound in the world is the distant rustling of leaves from the Forbidden Forest as a gale blusters between the trees. It gives Draco the chance to sort through his brain, to process the knowledge that Potter at least thinks he has a chance at redemption.
Draco is halfway across the stone courtyard, tripping over his own feet the moment he hears Harry's call.
Each cast is paired by the forceful motion of Draco jabbing his wand as if the sheer violence of his movement can make it all disappear but instead, he merely manages to roll the Harry-boggart onto its side, knocking its glasses askew.
The fury in Hermione wavers ever so slightly when Ron says nothing. For the first time in as long as Harry can remember, Ron is holding back - something he isn't prone to doing when it comes to Hermione. He's always been ready to tease her, to defend her, to rile up and calm down and talk her away from working herself to death.
"No!" Harry says quickly, seriously. "Draco, this is nothing to do with being weak. I do think there's a lot you're keeping from me that we need to talk about though."
Harry recognises their routine enough to despise it. They secretly work on the boggart together and then Harry returns to Ron and Hermione while Draco slinks away to his quiet dormitory and the company of himself,
Potion residue is everywhere. Hermione - through quick thinking and even quicker movements - has managed to save the bulk of it but the telltale glow around Ron's ears are enough to say that the damage has been done. The rest of the class are tittering in the background, taking Ron's ears from pink to deep scarlet in a matter of seconds.
." Harry adds when he sees she's about to argue the point. "You know I'd tell you otherwise. So what were you saying before now?"
"That's how I won yours." Harry points out, failing to see how Draco could need the reminder of that day in Malfoy Manor.
Harry follows her line of sight and sees Ginny next to Ron. He watches her fiddle with the fork in front of her, unusually subdued, a curtain of hair concealing her expression. They'd broken up the month before; it had been mutual, heartbreaking because the grief between them was simply too great and they'd realised early on that it wasn't working anymore. They'd cried together on Ginny's bed the night they confessed that to each other, mourning what they could have been if not for the war, if not for the death, if not for the agony that wrung out any good thing between them. Harry loses himself for a moment, remembering the stifling darkness from her sheets pulled up over their heads, the overwhelming scent of her floral shampoo against the pillow so that it slowly suffocated him, her breath hot against his face and fogging up his glasses as she pressed a kiss to his lips.
Harry doesn't know what to do; he tries to make himself appear busy, fiddling with the loose yarn of his lumpy hat, turning away while his best friends work through whatever they need to.
what she means. "You have that look on your face. The one that means you're thinking of doing something either incredibly stupid or incredibly noble."
“I guess we both got something more than what we thought we deserved.” Harry says, pocketing his photograph. “It’s funny, isn’t it?”
"I imagine it's going to be an interesting year ahead of us, don't you think?" Hermione asks, turning to Harry.
"I need to return to Malfoy Manor for Christmas." he explains, eyes downcast. "There are errands for me to run, staff to meet. That sort of thing. My mother is - uh - otherwise engaged so it falls to me to get everything back on track but I - I'd rather not go alone..."
He can't help it. After the dream, he can't ignore his suspicions. Harry makes a decision, cramming the Map into his pocket and takes off through the portrait hole. Hermione definitely won't be happy with him if she finds out about this.
"I suppose this means we're dating now." Draco says when they break apart, face flushed pink. "I have one question; can I be the one to tell Weasley?"
"The war brought on this rush of emotions for the both of us, we were terrified that the other wasn't going to survive and we just - we collided together again because of that fear. In the moment it felt right but after, when everything was done and the world felt too...quiet - it's like we could hear each other again and we realised we'd fallen out of sync."
Mrs. Norris stretches out, clawing softly at the thick carpet before she slinks out through the door after Filch but Harry's attention is already turned back to the wardrobe, his mind humming with plans and what-if's.
to go back to Hogwarts, for myself." Draco explains. "I need to start living on my own terms and that includes people being free to think of me as they please. I need to - to relearn how to be a person."
Harry's cursory glance over the magazine turns into a prolonged stare. Draco isn't wearing his usual pressed trousers and button up shirt, nor those high collared jumpers which he favours. He's in muggle clothing. Grey jogging bottoms and a baggy black sweatshirt. His hair - fluffy in a way that suggests it's freshly washed - keeps falling into his eyes. He's
Snow turns to ice then turns to sludge as the New Year is beckoned in. Harry is sprawled on the floor in Gryffindor common room in front of the fire, hunks of bread piled high on a plate beside him. Hermione and Ron, returned from their Christmas break, are tucked up together on the settee behind him.
"For the love of Merlin, why are you always following me?!" Draco echoes Harry's thoughts aloud but he doesn't sound mad, only fed up.
Before Harry is able to dwell too long on the prospect of Draco refusing to comply and how best to deal with that, the boy in question blinks out of his stupor and lightly tosses it back to Harry. "You can't blame me for wondering about it. It felt unnatural casting with it. Its bond with you is too strong, it was trying to resist me."
Draco had pinned Harry with his grey eyes, a frown making wings of his pale brows. “You know what for. For coming. I know what it cost you - it was too much for me to ask. Selfish, even. I won’t ask it of you again.”
"Do you?" Harry demands, suddenly breathless at the possibility of Draco acknowledging his attentions instead of sidestepping them.
Draco wrestles with some internal conversation for a brief moment, then all of a sudden slings his bag off his shoulders and onto the floor in a clatter, marching back to Harry until he's almost nose to nose with him. Harry tries to straighten up as best he can but the top of his head still barely clears Draco's chin.
flying. I miss the simplicity of it. Flying for me was always more than just the match, it was - it was about being free. I've spent so long always stuck in one cupboard - one room -
Harry can't tears his eyes away from that awful skull. His own scar has always been a nuisance, an instant identifier in a world where he just wants to remain unseen. Even in the Muggle world, he would be teased over the brutal streaks that criss-crossed and snaked down his forehead to his brow, over its peculiarity - Dudley and his friends had made sure of that. Draco's will betray him in a far worse way. People will see that mark and recognise it for what it is: a brand. They will know who he is and what he has done.
"I reckon I know enough, actually." Harry says coolly. "You can feel alone even with a hundred people standing around you."
I physically can't bring myself to read through this for the hundredth time so I hope it's okay! Lots of love to you all as always!
When he arrives at the staff room door, he's half hoping that Filch isn't there so that he can wonder the castle for a while looking for him to give this headache a chance to pass.
The thought of Remus stops him dead, it's too painful to recall. He remembers the gentle encouragement they'd all received from him, the success they'd had at confronting their fears and overcoming them, the incredible progress Neville had made just from the guiding hand of a caring teacher - one who had looked at him and seen the potential hiding away beneath his nervous exterior.
Harry grins, pulling himself up into a sitting position. The copy of Seeker Weekly has slipped down the side of the bed somewhere but Harry doesn't care; his day is about to become far more interesting than an outdated Player of the Month feature.
Just as he's about to gather up his things and at the very least a decent handful of sandwiches out of the bargain, a glint of copper catching the dying rays of light across the room draws his eye.
With its swirling robes starting to twist around its ankles, the dementor stumbles and trips backwards despite its best efforts to glide effortlessly toward Harry. Harry casts again and again, not stopping until the boggart-dementor is flailing around, its clumsiness sending a telephone flying off a nearby shelf. Harry spots his chance, sending the boggart flying backwards into the open cupboard behind it before throwing himself at the sliding bolt to lock it shut.
"Ever since I found out about this whole magical world, I've been met with some preconceived expectation. They see my mother's eyes in my father's face and already, their estimation of me is based off of my dead parents and who
. He doesn't point out that Draco had only just made a joke about them dating to begin with. "Next Friday it is."
"Harry." Hermione says sadly, recovered marginally from her embarrassment. She crouches at Harry's feet, gently shifting the Quibbler to pat his knee. "If it were possible to take on someone else's fear, we'd have found a way by now. You're doing all you can. Draco will get there, you're a good teacher."
Harry sags into him as if he needs this embrace just as much as Draco, as if they're two crumbling pillars frantically trying to keep one another upright. His arms go all the way around Draco's back and then some, soft hair against Draco's cheek, the clean cotton scent of Harry's shirt enveloping him. Oh Merlin, Draco thinks, will he ever be able to let go now?
It's a gramophone. Tucked neatly into the corner of the room and partially obscured beyond the shelf lined with books covered in symbols Harry can't even begin or want to understand, the gramophone bears a striking resemblance to the one which had occupied Remus's office years before. How or why it came to be in the Arithmancy classroom, Harry can never guess but he drifts towards it, crouching down to run a hand over the ridges in the metal, leaving trail marks and collecting dust across his fingertips for his trouble.
He's handed this wand back to Draco so many times before now, holding it out at the start of every one of their boggart lessons before either of them said a word. Draco always treated the occasion like he was a starving man set before a feast; the very feel of the wand in his hand seemed to provide Draco with a sort of nourishment, he'd turn towards the trunk which contained the boggart with replenished energy that he rarely displayed any other time.
The next morning, a bleary eyed Harry heads downstairs to the common room to find Hermione and Ron already waiting for him. They spring away from each other the minute they spot him, their hands - clinging together only seconds earlier - finding other tasks to busy themselves with.
Draco completes a full circuit of the house, emphatically bypassing the dungeons and the drawing room, a gesture of unforeseen thoughtfulness that faintly surprises Harry.
Draco bends his head, scratching at some bothersome itch or strain there at the nape of his neck, disrupting the fringes of his starlit hair. "Sometimes, it doesn't occur to me that I'm being rude until too late." Draco begins slowly. "I have to remind myself to work a little harder to be...civil towards you."
"Sorry," Draco says gleefully, not sounding the least bit sorry at all. "I suppose years of pent up frustration and the chance at a rare opportunity does that to one's Disarming spell, even with a borrowed wand. I'll remind you that you did ask for it, Potter."
"I feel guilty that I have the Weasley's.” Harry murmurs, as if afraid to say it out loud. “I always felt that I - I deserved what I got at the Dursley's. Like, I shouldn't be allowed to be happy without my mum and dad. They never got to live."
"I was thinking we could hold a revision group for O.W.L and N.E.W.T students in the common room during our free periods - or after dinner in the evening? We could make a party of it, maybe provide some snacks and pumpkin juice so that it'll be fun! I know that I wished we'd had some scheduled extracurricular studying during our fifth year - "
“So I suppose this means that you’ll start getting your work done early more often?” Hermione suggests witheringly, brows knitting together over a particularly stubborn spot.
"I guess I could say the same." she says, reaching out over the table to pat Harry's hand, fingernails chewed down to the bone. Those nails have been a constant source of dismay to Molly. "I'm fine though, I'll be fine."
Draco would have cursed Harry for that in the past. Instead, he turns on his heel and heads to the door, pausing with a hand clenching the doorknob. He doesn't turn back to look but from Harry's position, he can just make out the obnoxious upturn of Draco's nose, the severe cut of his cheekbone. When Draco next speaks, he lets every ounce of his fatigue pour into the words, the lines of his shoulders drooping as if any energy he had clung onto has suddenly drained from him.
"You've got to know me better than that by now. This stuff doesn't come naturally to me either, alright? It took me months before I got with Ginny."
"Even a first-year would be able to see that you belong on a broom. I repeat, why didn't you try out?"
"Lucius Malfoy was rather exacting in his role as a father." Draco begins conversationally, eerily calm as they stroll through corridors with no apparent destination. "I was always taught that if I wasn't the best, I was a failure. I had to show the world what it really
"Blasted students, always making messes." Filch wheezes, slamming his mug down onto the table, its thick brown contents spilling out across the surface. Harry has to dive out of the way to stop Filch from barreling right into him. "Come, my sweet. There's work to be done..."
“I want to apologise,” Draco continues hurriedly, the blush on his face growing deeper but he doesn’t allow his eye contact to drop to the floor. Instead, he tips his chin up, shoulders squared like he’s braced for impact. “For everything. I’ve treated you abominably over the years. It is unjustifiable. I was petty and childish, and incessantly jealous of you. I can’t take back the pain I know I’ve caused but I’d like to atone for it from this point onwards - if that’s acceptable to you.”
"Death Eaters still infiltrated Hogwarts because of what I'd done! You can't clear me of all charges, it's not for any one person to decide. I betrayed you all and if you want to forgive me then
"As you can see," Draco drawls, coming to a halt outside a door. "This place is far too large for my mother to live alone but I can't persuade her to sell and move. So
When Harry rounds on Malfoy, he is slowly rising to his feet with deliberate control. Draco is far from his usually crisp exterior; he pushes back a fistful of typically bright hair darkened from sweat, tear-track stains running down the length of his grey cheeks. He hasn't even changed out of his uniform yet, only loosened his tie and pulled open the top buttons of his shirt. For all of this, he still addresses Harry as if he has merely interrupted a moment of quiet contemplation.
Draco is gasping, doubled over, his hair falling about his face."I'll try harder next time, I promise."
Sometimes, Harry worries that Ron still blames himself for leaving them due to the toll of the horcrux that had been hanging around his neck like a daily noose. It had bothered Harry and Hermione but its effect on Ron had sank deeper into his core, striking at the lingering insecurities he had had about feeling inferior. Harry knows Ron is past the point of jealousy - far from it - but the power that the locket had radiated may have been enough to leave a permanent scar on Ron's soul, planting a new seed of guilt and letting it fester there. Guilt for leaving. Guilt for not being able to spare Hermione from Bellatrix's ruthlessness. Guilt for Fred's death.
Outside of the Transfiguration classroom window, a crack of lightning whips across the black sky, illuminating every inch of Draco's strained, perspiring face as Harry guides the boggart back into the wooden chest. The tumultuous boom of thunder rumbles through the castle seconds after, mingling with the near-indecipherable sound of hundreds of voices screaming across the grounds.
They all sit like that, a human paper chain of grief and pain and regret, heedless of the other Gryffindors milling about around them. No one bothers them, no one ever does. Here in Gryffindor Tower, they never even have to ask. They're the golden trio, what they went through is widely speculated but never spoken, and everyone in the common room often wonders in the privacy of their own heads or in muted questions to their friends but never aloud to the three of them. Something like that can never be put into words.
Chocolate and spit sprays everywhere from his mouth, earning a look of utter repugnance from the Slytherin across the room.
"No-one likes being alone, Potter. Loneliness, even as a choice, can be exhausting," Draco picks through his words with care. "I know that I can appear - appear frozen. I know that it's as if I've been hewn from ice because I'm remote. Even with my mother, I feel...distant.
Harry has no idea how long he's been standing there for or what he may be thinking beyond his carefully blank face. Had he been following Harry?
"My mother. She's...she's not very fond of visitors. She's aware you're here, of course, I would never dream of intercepting her privacy like that but - but the parlour is the one room she respectfully requests you keep your distance from." Draco explains, eyes downcast. His chest heaves as if his body is loathe to reveal any more of his family life. He coughs out the next words regardless. "It's always been her place, it's where she feels most at peace."
The words lack the bite they might have had a few years prior but it still gives pause to what Harry plans to say next.
"You don't have to worry about me - I would never - I'm here for...you know." Harry finishes somewhat pathetically.
done that stuff, he died before he could clear his name. I don't want you to go through the same thing."
for at least a little while longer even though I knew it wasn't real. All I ever wanted was for him to approve of me, I'd have given anything -
Until he seeks out someone who he knows will be too preoccupied to notice. He looks instead to Draco Malfoy continuing on in his mission to glare down at the table like he's hoping to disappear from the spot. A miracle, really, that he decided to come back for his final year. He had to have known the sort of commotion he would cause and yet he still chose to return. Outwardly, Malfoy still looks preened; there isn't a single hair out of place, nor a wrinkle in his clothes but his face is pallor, his complexion ashy against the sleek white-blonde of his hair. Something else is different there though. Harry can't seem to look away from him, trying to place what it is...
"Don't be daft, you told me you'd be busy. Anyway, I've had a ton of time to write to Ron and Hermione. Ron's been sending me letters every other day complaining that his brother Charlie keeps beating him at chess."
"We've been chatting about it for the past month, I'd say." Ron explains, looking around to his sister and Hermione for confirmation. "You would go and get a crush on bloody Malfoy, wouldn't you?"
Harry smirks into his shoulder while he flies down to scoop up the apple dropped in the surprise, "It's just a little friendly competition."
"Looks like we made it in the nick of time." Ron says with relief, stamping his boots clean. His tone grows playful when he turns towards Harry, shoving at his shoulder with a halfhearted thump. "Next time you suggest a walk down to Hagrid's, I say we check the weather first. Right, how about we head to the common room and make ourselves some hot chocolate before dinner?"
Draco looks equally amused, a small mercy that they should be with company and not alone because Harry
