I was referring to the incident in which you LEAPT OFF YOUR BROOM, YOU ABSOLUTE FUCKING BABOON, and then FELL TO WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN YOUR UNTIMELY, YET DESERVED, DEATH were it not for the swift actions of your blessedly competent teammates.
Harry didn't look like he understood, but he nodded very seriously and let Draco tell him all about the dig site.
I was going to write a sharp, but humorous, dig (ha) at you comparing me to stationery, but truth to be told I’m warmed all the way down to the deepest cockles of my cold, frozen heart. I’m charmed. Never stop being you.
Lavatories might be Draco’s second favourite thing (after middens), but even six-hundred-year-old lavatories could have a certain distinct…smell. It was a hole in the ground—it’d not always been a hole in the ground; it had started as a hole in the ground, sure, and Draco had excavated it until it became a hole in the ground once more, so the lavatory was now back in its original form. More or less. After removing layers of dirt, soil, and burnt materials (evidence that this lavatory had at one point had a wooden structure covering it, and that this structure had burnt), he’d reached the treasure trove: human excrement.
Draco slowly sipped Harry’s tea, watching him put together a breakfast for both of them (porridge with applesauce). Suddenly it didn’t feel like he’d been away for months. It felt like he’d always been here, in this kitchen, with Harry, drinking tea. He glanced out the window but it was still dark.
Sorry about that, I’ve calmed down. If you want to know, Alex didn’t refill the coffee tin after they emptied it. I would say that my nerves aren’t particularly frayed at the moment, but I fear that may be a lie. The frost hasn’t quite set in yet, but it snowed today. We’re ahead of schedule. I’ll see you soon.
I am reading Letters to Niezka. I like the letters. I think I understand what you meant when you said to write more—these letters are incredibly intimate, aren’t they? I feel like I’m prying. They’re beautiful letters. Grishina was so passionate about everything and she wrote beautifully, or I assume she did. I suppose I should credit her translator as well.
What is it about fire that makes things feel more homey and safe? Some primal instinct in our animal brains? At any rate, I agree: I don’t need to go anywhere, I just want you here.
"Just—give it here—" Harry reached for the cup, expecting Malfoy to lean away from him—but Malfoy froze for a fraction of a second, and then he leaned in, and suddenly he was kissing him. Malfoy's lips were hot, his mouth was hot, and Harry wasn't freezing anymore, if he'd been freezing at all.
After suggesting we write to each other more, I suddenly find myself at a loss for what to write to you. Do you want to know what I had for breakfast this morning? What the weather is like? Which of my colleagues is being especially irritating at the moment? Well, I will tell you.
Malfoy's eyes were on the door to the broom shed. "Let's strike a bargain," he said. "I destroy whatever the hell it is you're wearing, if you retrieve a broom for me."
It’s normal to write a letter over the course of a few days, isn’t it? I am busy this week and am stealing a moment over breakfast to write a few lines to you. (Breakfast: eggs, toast, tea.)
I reread your letters all the time. (Breakfast today: eggs, porridge, pumpkin juice.) It’s a new kind of missing you—I come home and hope for another letter, but of course there isn’t one because I haven’t sent this one yet. I sometimes wonder how it happened that our careers diverged so wildly that we spend what feels like most of the year apart, and then I think about what you said about an uncomplicated past. I don’t think our early days together were all that uncomplicated, but it’s easy to think of it that way now, isn’t it? I know it was hard, but at the same time, what I remember most was how happy I was every time you wanted to spend time with me. I still feel that same thrill every time I see you, but now those moments are further apart.
They were the only ones in the dormitory, everybody else having gone home for the holidays. Harry tried to look like he hadn't noticed that Malfoy had only three packages, while he was working his way through a mountain—most of which turned out to be presents from people he didn't know, as well as his friends and the Weasleys. No, wait—there was a small package from Andromeda and Teddy as well. And one from Malfoy.
"I didn't ask for it," Harry said, without any real heat behind it. He wasn't in the mood to have this argument again.
The train pulled up at the station and Draco gently extinguished the glow and put the half-smoked cigarette back into the pack. A trickle of people exited the station, Draco watching them idly until—there, a shock of black hair and a familiar duffel bag.
In the kitchen, bathed in the gentle warm light from the little lamps under the cabinets, was Harry, nursing a cup of tea and reading what looked like a letter from Draco. Draco still had all of Harry’s letters in a careful bundle in his pocket.
"Nope," Harry said and landed gently beside him. He secured his broomstick and then sat down, passing Malfoy a slice of tart.
The digsite was completely inaccessible for anyone who didn’t know how to get to it, which was why Draco had gone to pick up Harry at the nearest Muggle train station. Harry had had to Portkey into Magdeburg (via Berlin) and then take the Muggle train to Hettstedt, from where Draco would drive them the rest of the way. Draco was waiting for him in the very small car park leaning against his Muggle car, apparently called a
"Mmh, whatever you say," Harry said, putting the tea aside. There was something—someone—else who required his full attention.
"Sure." Harry put on the jumper Molly had knit him. It was green. "Want to go out for a spin before we head down for Christmas Dinner? I could use some fresh air."
“Draco.” Harry nearly toppled the chair over in his haste to get up. He pulled Draco in for a kiss. “Your letter arrived. I was reading it. Coffee?”
"Fine." Malfoy stepped closer and pulled his wand on Harry in a fluid motion. When Harry didn't move, Malfoy took another step, so that the tip of his wand was flush against Harry's chest.
What do you think people would find in our letters hundred years from now? I’m not sure I would want anybody else to read them, but at the same time it feels like I’ve learned something new from reading Grishina’s letters. I learn something new about
Harry only stayed two nights before he had to go back home and resume his work. He’d be back the following week, for another two nights.
Malfoy accepted it. He twirled it thoughtfully, looking between Harry, the broom shed, and the far distance over Harry's right shoulder. "Race you to that peak over there?"
"No of course not," Malfoy said, finally deigning to look at Harry. "You're only the captain of the team."
Then Draco wouldn’t see him again for more than two months, until they wrapped up the dig and he could go home, and the Quidditch season went on hiatus.
Today’s breakfast: eggs, toast, tea. I’ve left the sink a mess this week but I’ll do the dishes later. In a way taking these moments to write to you every morning feels like a little quiet refuge or a secret space that nobody else knows about but you. It feels safe here. I miss you. These days I’m missing you more than I’ve ever missed you before and I can’t explain it. Have I reached a breaking point? I don’t know.
"I was going to say gaudy," Harry said, and resolved to have a word with Twilfitt about letting people order clothes based on his measurements. "The colour doesn't suit you."
I have to confess I haven’t a Christmas present for you (yet). If you have a wishlist, do enclose it in your next letter. If you don’t all bets are off and I might just bring you a pine cone from the woods in lieu of an actual present.
I didn’t realise love letters were on the table. How does one write a love letter? Would you like me to write you one?
Remembering what else he had in his pockets, Draco put Harry’s tea down for a moment. “I got you a pine cone,” he said, setting it gently on the table.
I have lost count of how many times I’ve read Letters to Niezka. I re-read it at least once a year. Every reading experience is different: the first time I read it, I was caught up in Grishina’s prose, the wild landscapes she painted with her words. There’s something very poetic about the way she writes, even when she’s ostensibly not trying. Last time I read this book I found myself wondering where Niezka’s letters to Grishina are. There isn’t a single one in the entire book, and I wonder—how did Niezka phrase her thoughts? Which words did she like to use, how did she cross her t’s and dot her i’s? Was she as bombastic as Grishina, or did she have a more reserved style? Did they complement each other, or did they contrast?
Harry polished off his croissant, glancing at Malfoy from the corner of his eye. Was he blushing? No. Probably just the cold.
I’ll post this letter after I’ve been shopping. I want to enclose some sweets. (Actually I just want an excuse to get myself treacle toffees.) To end the letter with a quote from Raaid: “Absent or present, you are always my light.”
I had a cup of coffee and toast for breakfast today. I’m actually trying to quit the cigarettes, damn you. I don’t know what’s happening to me—I feel like I want to elope with you. Not like when we actually eloped, but like…I want to go somewhere with you where nobody knows us and where we don’t have responsibilities. Come to think of it, that’s how our correspondence feels to me. A quiet refuge, you said. Yes. You are my refuge, Harry.
Malfoy shrugged a shoulder. “It sucks, but I’ve learned how to prevent them as much as I can,” he replied.
“Sorry,” Ron mumbled, ears flushed pink. Harry rolled his eyes, picking up the pace on his way to the classroom. He was becoming increasingly aware of Ron’s crush on Hermione that year, not helped by the rumours of several boys trying to get with her that year. “But hey, if it goes well, maybe soon they’ll be staring because you’re the big Quidditch legend instead of just a lookalike.”
Harry opened and closed his mouth several times, struggling for any further argument. But he could find none. He didn’t even want to play anyway…
“You’ll be fine, Harry,” Hermione assured him for what felt like the millionth time already since getting to school. “There’s no pressure to make a decision right now.”
Without waiting for a reply, he took the stairs two at a time and strided all the way back to Gryffindor tower, going to bed without another word.
Malfoy shrugged. “I understand. You were trying to impress Puddlemere United,” he said. “I think it worked.” He jutted his chin up, looking at something over Harry’s shoulder.
“Of course!” said Lily, elbowing James in the side as he opened his mouth to protest. “Go ahead, love. We’ll see you in only a week for the Christmas holiday and you can tell us all about it then.”
Just before his knees could hit the ground, Malfoy lunged the last few steps between them, catching Harry around the middle from behind.
It was one of those brief reprieves from his usual extracurriculars or coursework one evening when Harry found himself in the library alongside Hermione, Ron, Neville, Hannah Abbott and Ernie Macmillan. Ron and Ernie were in an intense chess match, Hermione and Hannah were going over details from their latest Transfiguration essay and Harry was half-heartedly listening to Neville’s rant about some venomous plant he read about recently.
Harry startled out of his thoughts, blinking up at his friend in confusion. Around him, his other friends were all silent, staring at him in curiosity at Neville’s comment in his direction. Harry dropped his shoulders, sending Neville an apologetic frown, cheeks flushing.
“Couldn’t put that in a letter? You were gonna find out when you came to the match, anyway,” Harry replied, barely hiding the bitterness in his tone.
Ernie slapped Harry on the back, smiling jovially. “I’m sure you’ll do great, Harry. You’re the best Seeker Hogwarts has had to offer for years!” he said. “Although, I suppose Puddlemere isn’t quite as good as England’s national team, so you’re not as good as your dad.”
A few tears escaped James’ eyes, his lips turning downwards. He reached out and wrapped an arm around Harry, pulling him towards him. “Oh, Harry, I’m so sorry. I never meant to put so much pressure on you,” he cried as Harry tucked his face in the collar of his shirt. “I just thought it was something fun we had in common between us.”
“Gee, thanks, Ernie.” Harry frowned at his forgotten plans for the duelling club meeting the next day.
“Don’t apologise on my behalf, Malfoy,” Harry interjected, stepping back. “Thanks for helping me with—well, whatever that was yesterday, but just leave it alone, okay?”
“Harry, what’s wrong?” asked James. “Why would you do such a thing? You can tell us anything, Prongslet.”
This time, Harry had no trouble taking the cup from Malfoy. He refilled it from the flask, not taking his eyes off Malfoy, and had a scalding hot sip. "Want some?" Harry asked.
. Have you ever written one before? No, don’t answer that. I enjoy love letters, actually, when they’re not mine. Have you read Letters to Niezka by the famous sorceress and suffragette Grishina Sofya Nikolayevna? The penmanship is astounding. May I also recommend to you Raaid el-Qasim, who corresponded with his lover on matters of philosophy as well as matters of the heart?
We’re winding down as well—I have one “real” game left, then two for charity, and we’re booked for some public functions or whatnot, I don’t know. I just go where I’m told to go. I should be completely free in about two weeks, so I have a week free to sort out the house before you come home. (That sounds horrible. I swear I haven’t built a mountain of dishes, I just mean, the floor could do with a bit of scrubbing and I want to get our decorations down from the loft.)
“No, but I am sure he is around somewhere…Ah speak of the devil…Remus. You look…” Severus stopped talking his eyes moving over the form of his partner his black eyes glistening as he took him in. The children really not wanting to be around the adults just gazing at each other decided to say their goodbyes and leave.
“Y-yes, sorry...” Harry answered coming back to the present with a bump and flashing a little smile before focusing on the questions.
“What could I do? My hands were tied, I am a teacher in a school Severus, I have not the influence Lord Malfoy does. It was my word against Albus and Albus insisted it was for the greater good” Minerva sighed looking all of her years and more as she sank down into the most comfortable of Severus’ chairs and rubbed her temples with her fingertips. “I did spend many a summer watching over the boy.”
“Yes, of…of course…” Chuck spluttered reaching for the almost empty glass again and Harry wondered what more his uncle and fathers wanted to know about the man in front of them. They already knew that he had an ex-wife, a muggle born named Becky Rosen, that they had five children together, two sets of twins and a single, all boys, all named after angels, but Chuck rarely if ever saw any of his sons though recently he had been having more contact with the youngest who was the only one still in school. He was the only son of Carver Edlund, a very well-known figure in the American wizarding Government and had a twin sister who was slightly older Amara. Chuck or Carver Charles Shurley Edlund the second, was the black sheep of the family who had been kicked out when he had married his muggle born wife. He had been a fairy above average student and was actually top of his class in several subjects, mostly divination and ancient runes, but Music was his passion and he had done pretty well until he had become addicted to muggle drugs and potions which had cost him his marriage and his sons. He was two years sober and was going strong however his past meant that not many people were happy to take him on as teacher to their children.
“Harry how good it is to see you looking so well” Albus smiled his eyes twinkling with the brightness of a summer’s day. Harry ignored him looking at Severus who was leaning against the fireplace with his arms folded across his chest and his eyes narrowed at Dumbledore and harry felt all of his earlier happiness and confidence vanishing in an instant and he clutched Draco’s hand waiting for somebody to explain what was going on.
“You and Pansy like to tease each other” Harry said somewhat needlessly as Draco helped him out of the stores pattern robes and into some clothes that Narcissa had brought for him off the rail for today. He didn’t understand wizarding money but he had seen shiny gold coins being exchanged and he was genuinely worried that he was just an expense on the Malfoy family. He didn’t know how he was ever going to be able to pay them back. The Dursley’s had gotten a benefit for him, or rather a payment to pay them for the trouble of keeping him, would the Malfoy’s be given that now he was with them?
“Master Lucius! Youse frienden Professors Snakes is heres, Sir” Rocky announced from he door and suddenly Harry felt very cold and very afraid the memories he had been forced to relive coming back sharp and fast until he heard Narcissa say;
“Correct, well done little Draco. I told you it would be an easy one. Welcome to Ravenclaw.” The painting swung open slowly revealing a small set of stairs and a doorway. The stairs were made of polished white stone with swirls of black and what appeared to be glitter giving it a magical glow. There was space only for them to go one at a time, but Harry continued to cling to his friend while Chao-Xiang followed close behind. Once inside the dorm Harry was blown away by the sheer splendour of it. Blue and bronze were the main theme with a huge brown Raven with outstretched wings sitting on a perch atop the fireplace. Dark blue sofas were in front of it and there were tables and chairs on either side as well as shelves of books. The floor was the same swirling white, black, and glitter while dotted everywhere were thick comfy looking blue carpets.
“Harry, dear, I can’t promise to be able to answer everything but I can tell you what I know” Mrs Figg said with a surprisingly gentle smile her head cocking to one side as she sat in the overstuffed armchair across from him. Nervously Harry dragged his tongue over his dry lips and then absently stroked one of the cats that had jumped onto his lap at some point. The cats had never been overly friendly with him before but somehow it was rather comforting to have something to do with his hands. “Why don’t I start speaking and you can ask what ever you like. As you have probably guessed, you are a wizard, with parents like yours you’re probably going to be a blooming good one”
“Sorry, Rolf, we’re still looking into finding a way of teaching others…” Harry gave his friend an apologetic smile. It wasn’t the first time Rolf had said as much and Harry couldn’t help but still feel guilty.
“Hopefully, soon. Okay, I will let you go but it was delightful to meet you Harry!” Pansy said grinning at him and Harry gave a nod. It had been a strange meeting but a good one and Harry gave her a shy smile his own head bobbing up and down. “I will see you to the floo, it is over by the reception desk”
“Master Draco!” Jinx’s high pitched voice squeaked as she popped into the room with a loud crack her hands soapy a dish cloth in one hand. Her large eyes moved to Harry and she vanished the dishcloth and soap. “Little Master, youses been having a funnies turns again?”
“Either Ravenclaw or Slytherin if I were to hazard a guess. Hogwarts houses are rather a big deal, in the western world, perhaps more so than it should be.” Severus sighed lightly his shoulders sagging as he looked at his newspaper and saw that Lucius had already completed the crossword this morning while he lacked four words. Childish and crude comments were written in the side and Severus just barely stopped himself from rolling his eyes at his friends’ antics. “As for Mister Weasley, he remains in Slytherin, however it was agreed that he shall, for the time being, be placed in his own room away from the main dorm. I would have preferred to have him removed from the school altogether but the Weasley’s can ill afford to have him educated elsewhere. Without formal training he shall have his wand broken and be left unable to practice magic at all.”
“Yup! And they all have their own personalities! It’s fun! Though the lion head is the main one. I will introduce you properly! Are you ready to go in?”
“If I had wings, like Noah’s dove, I’d fly up the river, to the one I love. Fare thee well, oh Honey, Fare thee well. I knew a man, who was long and tall, he moved his body, like a cannonball. Oh Honey, fare thee well. Remember one night in the drizzling rain and around my heart I felt an aching pain. Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well. One of these days, it won’t be long, you’ll call my name and I’ll be gone. Fare thee well, Oh Honey, fare thee well. Fare thee well…” His voice only slightly wobbly. Chuck had helped him with his breathing and although he wasn’t perfect, he knew he had a decent voice when he let himself and since his only audience was Draco, he had a boost of confidence. The blond had changed positions and was now sitting crossed legged on the bed watching him with a smile his eyes softer and more relaxed than they were around other children. It made him look more like the child he was, and Harry couldn’t help but grin goofily back at him. Once the last note fell away Draco started clapping and Harry flushed a bright red. “I made tones of mistakes.”
“No idea…” If the twins had meant to say anything more it was cut off by the tapestry being pulled open and the tallest man Harry had ever seen was towering over them his face covered by a large fluffy beard. He had mole skin boots on, a brown waistcoat, and trousers, which were coated with more stains than Harry had ever seen before, and a huge ring of keys was settled on his hip.
“I want you to fuck me...” Harry growled in between kisses and although Draco’s eyes widened with surprise he nodded. Having no clue what he was meant to do next Harry let the more experienced Draco take the lead this time and he was convinced, a little while later when his...Rather, intimate area, was cleaned, stretched and lubed it was the best choice he could have made. He was pressed face against the wall with Draco coming up behind him, the head of his cock pressing against his needy hole and he whined like a kitten which turned into a growl when Draco asked almost uncharacteristically nervously
“Salazar” Lucius whispered rubbing his eyes with his palm before moving closer to his wife his arm wrapping around her shoulders securely. His eyes held a haunted look of their own however he was more focused on Narcissa and her current fears. “Did she say more? Perhaps, how many?”
“I think you’re already worthy…Dad” Harry gave a shy smile the title slipping out a little more awkwardly but with more feeling now he knew that he was doing it and Severus smiled twin spots of colour high in his sallow cheeks. “And Remus…What should I call you?”
“Hey! Pansy is a lady, you don’t speak that way to a lady” Draco growled and before anyone realised what was happening both Grub and Thomas were being flung backwards into a crystal vase that were filled with Narcissa’s favourite flowers. The vase swayed a few times and then fell to the floor with a loud smash covering both Grub and Thomas with the potion Narcissa used to keep the flowers fresh. The boys dropped to the floor staring in shock and horror before jumping up and stammering
The summer king laughed at her and her perceived notions of beauty. To him his spring bride was as beautiful as ever, he said the light in her eyes would never dim, the joy in her heart would always be there. Age did not remove the beauty of her soul and he kissed the bride twice on the lips, his hand caressing her cheek. The beauty that the spring held was in the simple joy of living. The spring bride proved the goodness of her heart by forgiving the witch of winter with her last breath. The witch screamed at the death, the sound so anguished that it broke the ice covering the world and ended the winter spring coming once more. With the first appearance of the flower the Bride awoke. She and the winter witch, became close friends. They share the well on Orkney, the bride drinks in the spring and the witch drinks in the winter”
“Ready to be students at Hogwarts, Harry?” He asked as the train came to a stop. Movement was heard as all the students clambered to get off the train and Harry and friends joined them seeing Hagrid standing on the platform with a lantern in hand calling out for first years. He tried to catch Harry's eye a few times but Harry pointedly ignored him. Remus and Severus had told him that first years travelled by boat over the black lake and Harry hoped the ride would be smooth not wanting to lose the Pumpkin pasties overboard.
“Allow me to be a little poetic, Severus. I meant that he is clearly in love with you.” The older witch chided slapping his hand playfully before giving it a squeeze and moving away. “What is your next question?”
“Did somebody call?” The spectre asked in a plum voice “Ah the Weasley twins, getting into mischief?”
“Yes father! Come on Harry! I’ll race you!” Draco laughed and Harry let out a giggle of his own following the two Malfoy’s making the most of his lighter frame. They raced three times until on the fourth they found Narcissa standing with her arms folded her foot tapping very gently on the grass. She appeared to be trying to appear stern but Harry could see the amusement in her ice blue eyes.
“Is there a chance he was exposed to a dark artifact? House elves are very tuned in to the magic of a wizard’s home, but they are the only true light humanoid creatures. Prolonged exposure to Dark magic could cause an unbalance” The man mused thoughtfully when they had almost reached Narcissa’s room. “It was something that Grindelwald tried to do. He wanted to corrupt House elves. He thought if he could corrupt them, he would have an obedient race that would listen only to him”
“Close to it” Narcissa said looking around with a disapproving sniff and Draco followed suit very nearly scowling at the neat rows of houses that all looked identical with neat little gardens and houses with net curtains. “How depressing, come Draco, Mrs Figg lives over here on Wisteria Drive., she gave me her address in her letter”
“I think they will be happy to allow you” Lucius chuckled “It is rather satisfying even if a little common” Lucius laughed as they walked over to the dummies and Severus removed his outer robe. Although he had come to teach potions maybe it would be a good thing to punch out the stresses of the day on the effigies of those that had caused so much harm to the son of his best friend. The boy he had grown to care for.
“Like from the story...Alice and wonderland?” Harry asked and all three purebloods looked at him in confusion and Harry hastily told them the story of a young girl who went down a rabbit hole following a white rabbit with a pocket watch. It sounded far too magical to have been written by a muggle but Draco nor his mother knew the name of the author so didn’t know if it was a muggleborn who had gone out into the muggle world or not. It seemed possible though as Cheshire cats were a wizarding thing. They were attracted to magic in the same way cats liked cream but they were tricksters who would lead young children into the forests and then vanish leaving them alone.
“I lived in a cupboard until a few months ago” Harry stated unable to look at the werewolf positive that his heart had entered the back of his throat. “Just saying you care about me is all I needed”
“Yes, I told Harry as much” Lucius sighed looking over to his son, wife, and Harry his grey-blue eyes lost for a moment as just the corner of his mouth turned up into a smile as he watched them. Severus stiffened just a fraction his breath releasing in a hiss.
So sorry for going AWOL again, I totally didn’t plan on it. >.< The UK has had a heatwave and I just got slapped in the face with it and on top of having tests and rehab to get over Covid I just wasn’t in the mood to write I’m sorry but I am determined to continue and it is Draco’s birthday today so I had to post. I did intend to post a Darry Cinderella story, but I got embarrassed if you want to read it though let me know. Also if you are interested in the Boris the Brave story I can post the full story up. (I write them for my Nephews, though at the moment they have Birus the Virus who is an ogre who makes people sick >.<)
“Thank-you, I never thought I would see my sister again. The things she did, the madness was always within her but…” Narcissa let her voice trail off, most of it was genuine emotion. She had hoped that she would never again see Bella, but she had wished that she would receive death. That was better than living here in Azkaban. Dobble of course simpered and offered his heartfelt sympathies and Narcissa took them all watching as Kingsley’s eyes glazed over and his mouth became slightly lax.
“Uncle Vernon says that it is a waste of good gold when I am fit enough to carry the bucket and I don’t mind, I like the walk in the mornings.” Harry admitted truthfully as the first row of houses came into view.
As requested, your green sweets. I’m sorry about sort-of-almost-dying. Would it help if I told you I was acting in the spur of the moment? I saw a chance and I
Malfoy gave Harry a withering glare. "It hadn't escaped my notice. I was just—" He pursed his lips, looking like he'd seen something offensive.
Harry laughed and came away from the cooker for a moment to give Draco a kiss on the cheek. “Thank you. I love it.”
Harry squashed the urge to whack the back of Malfoy's head, if only because he was a tiny little bit right. "Wasn't
I never hear from you at the end of digs, so I was surprised to receive your last letter. I know. I’ll wait for you.
"Yes?" Harry twirled his borrowed broomstick. The lion was still singing, but he'd shut it inside the broom shed.
I am not impressed, I am not in the least happy, and I have no intention of catering to your monumental ego. What the fuck were you thinking? You could’ve
Oh Draco Dearest, how your eyes shine in the moonlight like pools of silver and something else appropriate. My heart beats for you and my dick longs for you. Forever and ever.
Maybe Harry should've felt bad about letting Malfoy destroy the t-shirt—horrible as it was, it had been a (probably) well-intentioned gift from the people he was rooming with; an eclectic mix of volunteers and convicts. Malfoy wasn't one of them, and all of Harry's friends who were volunteering to rebuild the castle had been allocated elsewhere. But Harry didn't feel bad—just relief to be rid of the thing.
if you bring me a pine cone from the woods. Do you remember being a child and having a friend in playschool whom you might give a rock as a token of affection? I’d say I do, but I don’t think I ever did, and I don’t think I ever received one. I’ll consider a pine cone an upgrade from the non-existent rocks of my childhood.
"Ugh fine, I'm looking at you," Harry said, taking a sip before passing the cup over. "Just trying to figure you out."
Later, in Draco’s rented bedroom, with the sweat on their bodies rapidly cooling, Draco fumbled for his cigarettes. He lit the half-smoked one. Harry's body beside him was hot, solid, tangible—a world away from the acrid smoke in Draco’s throat. Still, it calmed him.
Ah yes, I found the books. Not that your eclectic system of organisation helped. Anything else I should look for?
Today’s breakfast: two cups of coffee, one with sugar and cream. I cherish your letters, love. I felt that needed repeating; you might not be the most eloquent of humans (I love you) but I can sense the thought you put into them, and I can feel the strength of your emotions (I love you so much).
I wonder if we’ve both reached a breaking point? Much as I love to complain about muddy fields I do love my work. Right now I’m also looking forward to this particular dig being over so I can come home and write my papers and not go on another dig for months. I want to see you every day.
P.S. Actually, could you enclose some of those sweets in your next letter? I cannot possibly be expected to wait three whole weeks for sweets.
On the subject of love letters. No, for goodness’ sake, do not write me love letters. Or—well, if you truly
I believe Raaid helped pioneer certain disciplines, but frankly I don’t much care since they’re not related to my field. What draws me to him (and Grishina) is that he is as passionate about his work as he is in love with his lover. They both remind me of you.
"Not to your liking, Potter?" Malfoy plucked it out of the pile and put it on over his pyjamas. The sleeves were a little short. "Ah, yes. Tailor-made. Twilfitt and Tattings, I believe. I recognise the cut."
leapt for it. I shall endeavour not to recklessly endanger myself (and your heart) again. See? I can also talk like a knob.
Harry turned to look. He felt the air move before he saw that Malfoy had taken off. Cursing, he barged into the broom shed and leapt over the singing lion to grab another broomstick, and then took off after Malfoy.
P.P.S. Perhaps I should congratulate you on your victory, but that would somehow imply the victory was all yours and not in actuality carried on the shoulders of your eminently intelligent and talented team.
The team is heading to Scotland tomorrow for a boot camp, then to France for a game. I’ll come down early to see you on your dig after—unless you’re horribly busy? You can tell me all about your exciting lavatory.
Draco let himself into the house as quietly as he could; it was six in the morning. The light was on in the kitchen, but there was a chance that Harry had just forgot to turn it off the evening before. He left his suitcase in the entrance hall and made his way to the kitchen, bones aching and skin tight with exhaustion.
," Malfoy said. He glanced at Harry, then looked out over the lake again. "It's something to do that isn't…you know."
Perhaps what I miss isn’t the conversations so much as the intimacy. That terrifying feeling of vulnerability—do you remember how hard I found it to let you in? It was a thrill in several ways. Exhilarating. Terrifying. I never wanted it to stop. I wanted it to stop. I wanted more, I wanted less, I wanted everything, I wanted nothing. I wanted to hide, I wanted to yell, I wanted all these conflicting things, and now, what I remember isn’t all the ways we shagged, but the quieter moments. How I felt talking to you.
Forgive me for the long wait. We are working long hours trying to wrap up the dig before the frost sets in, and most nights I’ve crawled into bed exhausted, unable to summon the energy to put my thoughts into words. (If my letter smells like cigarette smoke, it’s only because I miss you a lot today and I’m trying to finish off the pack. I think this will be my last one.) I’m sitting in my tent now, having a quick lunch break and writing to you. Thank you for the sweets—I’ve been savouring them.
I had a cup of coffee and a cigarette for breakfast. It was raining a little, and while I hoped the sun would come out, by lunchtime the rain had intensified. Euan (not irritating) built a campfire and we roasted sausages for lunch. Upon further thought I’ve decided not to regale you with the exploits of my most irritating colleague—I’ve decided to be positive today.
When I get home the first thing I’m going to do (after kissing you) is finish building that pizza oven in the garden. I don’t think we’re allowed firepits in the city, but if I put up some charms and look very apologetic when the authorities eventually come knocking, it should be fine. We could of course actually go somewhere together, but the truth of the matter is, I don’t need to go anywhere. Is it still eloping if we just stay home?
"If you hadn't woken me up in the middle of the night, I wouldn't have overslept," Malfoy replied. "It's your own fault."
prying, in a way, to read somebody else’s letters, even when published. They were once private. There’s a vulnerability in that, too—the correspondents may no longer be alive to witness their private thoughts made public, but I can appreciate the confidence all the same. It feels sacred in a way. I feel vulnerable too, every time I read Grishina’s letter dated April 21st 1897: “You sleep, the eastern sun and the western moon, and your skin shifts from night to day. The world awakens with you and so do I.” It is perhaps not the most profound passage or the most poetic, rather it seems almost childish and clumsy. She writes more beautifully elsewhere. But the world awakens. Harry, I’m awake.
My dig is going well, thank you for asking. (You did.) We’re currently unearthing what we think might have been a lavatory (and you can stop your sniggering at once, heathen, lavatories are the
"I should've known that half the wizarding world would shower you with gifts," Malfoy said, coming over to sit on Harry's bed. He picked up a parcel. "Let's see…Maude, in Swindon, sends her love and a box of fudge." He helped himself to a piece. "Not bad."
I’ve stretched my break long enough, so that’s all for now. I’ll counter with another quote from Raaid: “Oh my soul, we are tired, we are defeated, but we love…”
"What's there to figure out?" Malfoy cradled the cup in both his hands, taking a long sip. Then another. And another.
I’m okay, thank you for asking. (You didn’t.) My emotional state, however, not so. I’m aggrieved. And grieved. I dropped my favourite digging mug listening to the wireless—I swear, I have never heard Lee that terrified before. My heart and mug shattered and while my heart may be on the mend, I’m afraid the mug is unsalvageable.
“Have a seat, Mr. Potter,” said McGonagall, sitting in her seat behind her desk and gesturing to the empty chair between his parents.
“Just don’t steal my food again, then,” said Harry, even though he knew it was futile. “But, no, that’s not what I was thinking about. I was just distracted about the upcoming match.”
“Professor Flitwick already knows you’ll be late,” she interrupted. “But the rest of you need to get to class. Go on.” She shooed Harry’s friends away.
For the majority of that day, Harry kept mostly to himself as much as he could. He kept his head down in class instead of making jokes under his breath or trying to get into debates with his professors, writing notes and practicing spellwork in relative silence. He could sense the concerned looks from his friends and even a few professors, but he couldn’t bring himself to bring any extra attention to himself.
Harry stumbled on the steps down the Hufflepuff staircase at the sound of Hermione coming towards him, calling after him. He turned, forcing a smile at her. “Hey, Hermione. Sorry, I’ve been studying all day and lost track of time, so I missed dinner,” he explained.
Alongside their Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Lupin, stood Harry’s dad James, dressed in one of his old England team jerseys. Despite nearing 40, James Potter was still a handsome man with his artfully messy black hair peppered with grey, stylish glasses and a cheeky grin. Beside him, Remus Lupin was also similarly handsome even with the many scars littering his body and the beginnings of grey hair already taking over his brown hair. Harry knew he was one of the most popular professors at school with his cozy jumpers and tweed jackets and his kind smile that had everyone swooning.
And then he led them out onto the field to the roaring crowds above. He caught sight of his parents up in the staff box with Remus and Sirius and Peter Pettigrew, all dressed in Gryffindor colours. He also spotted the Puddlemere manager, dressed in formal dress robes in the Puddlemere United blue, eyes instantly clocking onto Harry as he moved to the centre of the field to shake hands with the Slytherin captain.
As soon as his parents and Sirius and Peter said goodbye, Harry took off across the field, trying to catch up to Malfoy before he lost sight of his blond hair in the crowd.
“Just leave me alone, Malfoy,” said Harry resignedly. “Don’t act like you’ve ever given a single fuck about me after all this time. You’re just another person that’s added to the pressure by taunting me all these years, so just leave me alone.”
Harry remembered way too late that the Captain was none other than the one person he had been avoiding for the last few weeks.
As a result, every year for the first few weeks of school Harry was swarmed and ogled by the new first years, all pushing and shoving to get a look at the son of everyone’s favourite Quidditch player, to see their immediate likeness and see if he was just as talented as his father. Hari lost count of just how many times people asked him to get an autograph from his father, having taken to outright ignoring anyone that asked.
Malfoy flinched at Harry’s dark tone. He jumped to his feet, glaring at Harry. “I had to tell McGonagall! You hurt yourself and statistically, that makes you much more likely to do it again or worse!” he snapped. “You need help, Potter and it can’t always be me. So don’t you dare blame me for just trying to do the right thing.”
“You’re such an asshole, Malfoy. This is why I’ve never liked you.” He shoved past Malfoy, heading for the stairs.
Harry scoffed, scrambling to his feet using his uninjured hand. “You’re fucking ridiculous. I can’t believe I even told you that,” he snapped, shaking his head.
“Godric, don’t even remind me,” Harry groaned as they entered the Potions classroom. “My head already hurts just thinking about it.”
Walking down to the pitch with Ron and Ginny to get ready for the match, many people stopped Harry to wish him good luck, calling out to him as they passed them. Harry largely ignored them, merely nodding or smiling politely in acknowledgement, picking up the pace until the trio finally reached the locker rooms.
McGonagall stepped past him and led the way up the stairs. Harry followed her reluctantly, feeling his heart beginning to race once again. He willed it to slow down, following her with heavy footsteps dragged down by dread.
In all honesty, Harry had stopped listening almost as soon as Neville started, his mind elsewhere as usual.
“Yes, I am aware of this rivalry of sorts between you two,” interrupted McGonagall. “I have been witness to your many arguments and duels through the years, but when Mr. Malfoy came to me with his concerns, I do not think it had anything to do with any animosity between you two. He said he was worried about you.”
“Come on, Potter, let’s just breathe, alright?” said Malfoy soothingly. He shifted until Harry was no longer almost in his lap. Instead, he rubbed a cool hand up and down Harry’s back and began doing breathing exercises with Harry, breathing deep and slow until Harry could finally breathe properly again.
Harry jumped half a foot in the air as someone banged on the door to his stall. “Harry? You alright in there, mate? The game’s starting soon?” said Ron on the other side of the door.
Harry choked out another sob, stumbling over to the sinks and running his hands through his messy curls despite the pain lacing through his hand. He couldn’t catch his breath or centre his vision and he swore he was seeing spots, swaying on the spot on weak knees. With one last whimper and a gasp of pain, Harry’s knees buckled beneath him.
Harry glanced at his hand again. “I—I don’t know. I guess I’m just tired of all this pressure being put on me lately,” he explained, grimacing. “I just can’t do it anymore. Everyone expects me to be this brilliant Quidditch player and to take after my dad and he’s always trying to urge me to be as good as him. I just—I’m so tired of it. I can’t do it…” He sniffled, wiping fresh tears on the back of his dirty sleeve.
The next day, Harry tried to pretend that everything was okay and he wasn’t falling apart inside. He went down to breakfast with his friends and forced himself to join in with their conversations with enthusiasm, laughing at jokes and making as many comments as he could. He could feel both McGonagall and Remus watching him from the teachers’ table as well as Malfoy from the Slytherin table, but he ignored them, turning himself away from them and avoiding catching their eyes.
But Harry cut her off, tearing his hand from her grasp. His stomach plummeted and he felt his heart skip several beats. “But what about the match? I can’t miss the match, I’ve got someone coming from Puddlemere United to see me play!” he exclaimed, voice going shrill. “I’ll be really careful before the match! But I can’t possibly miss it, Madam Pomfrey!”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Oh, wow, how long did it take you to come up with that, Malfoy? Been practicing all summer for that one?” Harry retorted, earning snickers from their other classmates listening into the conversation.
Harry smiled tearfully, looking back and forth between his two parents. What a mess they all made, all three of them crying in Professor McGonagall’s office as she awkwardly listened in. “I do love Quidditch, Dad. I just—I’m not sure I want to start doing it professionally so soon. I’ll never be exactly like you and maybe we should stop trying to make it that way,” said Harry, bumping James’ shoulder.
“Ah, Mr. Potter,” he said by way of greeting. He held out a hand for Harry to shake and Harry took it. “Charles Burness, manager of Puddlemere United. That was a remarkable performance, I must say. Especially that feint near the end!”
Harry shook his head, more sobs escaping him, clutching his arm to his chest. “It’s—there’s just. So. Much.
Harry’s head swam with hundreds of questions as he marched up to the Transfiguration teacher’s office as fast as he could. His heart was racing by the time he got to her office, discomfort and confusion clouding his thoughts. Swallowing a lump in his throat, he raised his uninjured hand and knocked three times on her door.
“Go—away, Malfoy,” Harry gritted out, cutting himself off with a harsh sob. He hiccoughed, turning around to face Malfoy directly.
“It was,” said Harry, grabbing one of Draco’s hands. “I don’t know if I ever would have gotten help if you hadn’t forced me to. So, thank you for that. It was the kick I needed.”
However, just as he was making his way up the first set of stairs between the library and the owlery side of the school, someone called his name from down the steps. He froze, one foot hovering over the next step, stomach dropping like a stone as he recognised that voice. How could he not? It was the voice that had plagued all of his dreams the previous nights, the voice that taunted and argued with him from the age of 11 and rarely ever relented.
“I wonder what they could possibly be staring at,” Harry deadpanned to his best friend and fellow Gryffindor Quidditch player, Ron Weasley after noticing yet another huddle of kids staring at him in awe. “I haven’t got something on my face, have I? Something in my teeth?”
As the school year went on, between Quidditch practices, N.E.W.T level homework, duelling club and classes, Harry was run almost ragged with anxiety, dread and exhaustion. He had almost no free time with almost daily Quidditch practices and co-running the bi-weekly duelling club meetings with Neville and the growing piles of exam prep. What little time he did have was largely occupied by helping Hermione in her house elf rights group or planning upcoming practices or duelling club meetings.
Malfoy yelped, diving out of the way with wide eyes. Harry pushed forwards and plucked the Snitch right out of the sky, pulling to a halt with ease as he thrust his fist in the air and the stands exploded in cheers.
“Yeah, maybe. But you don’t have the entire school and your world-renowned Quidditch legend dad putting even more pressure on you to do well, do you?”
By the time he got to the common room and slipped inside to join his friends on one of the couches, his heart was still racing and he felt positively sick with dread for the upcoming match and the growing pressure to live up to his father’s legacy.
Harry turned to go, but once again, Malfoy grabbed his arm before he could get very far. He turned to glare over his shoulder and pulled away again, but he paused at the hopeless, hurt expression crossing Malfoy’s face. He’d never seen anything but a neutral, laughing or sneering look on Malfoy and it was disarming to see him so downtrodden. His heart clenched oddly with what Harry refused to register as pity.
His voice trailed off and he fiddled with a loose thread in his school robe, holding back tears. “I didn’t even realise what was happening. Everyone was asking me and starting rumours about getting scouted. I was just so anxious about the match and I couldn’t think straight and I felt like I was about to burst out of my body and I just—I just punched the mirror as hard as I could,” he murmured. “I just wanted it all to stop.”
“What’s wrong with you? What happened to your hand?” Malfoy asked, his voice growing high pitched with alarm.
Madam Pomfrey cocked an eyebrow, pausing dousing him with dittany to give him a signature frown. Through the years, Harry had been in and out of the hospital wing countless times for a variety of Quidditch injuries, backfiring spells or silly pranks gone wrong. She joked multiple times that she ought to dedicate the space to him, seeing as she had hardly any students in there as much as Harry.
Harry shot one final glare over his shoulder and turned back around to his seat, ignoring Hermione’s chastising glare in his direction.
As he got dressed into his Quidditch gear and the cheers and shouts from the crowd outside grew, so too did Harry’s anxiety. He felt the pressure returning in full force, filling his lungs with stones and clouding his mind with doubts and regrets. He excused himself to one of the private changing stalls, leaning against the wall and trying to get his breathing under control. He couldn’t afford to faint or punch a wall right before the match; his friends and family were all counting on him. He just needed to go through the new breathing exercises he learned from his Mindhealer (and Malfoy, but he would never admit it) and then he could go out there and everything would be fine. He just needed to—
“Now, what on earth happened this time?” Madam Pomfrey tutted, gently lifting Harry’s hand, tapping each knuckle with the tip of her wand. It stopped the bleeding in seconds, removing some of the worse bruising around them, though it stung as she did it. “You weren’t fighting again, were you?”
Harry sighed, throwing a glance at Remus, who was watching the conversation with a curious, bemused smile. “Alright, there’s a Cannons scout coming and also a Magpies one for me. But Ginny also has a Harpies scout coming to see her. So, it’s not the most important game it could be.”
“What is it, Potter? Why am I being manhandled?” he complained, letting Harry drag him into a small copse of trees to the side. He pulled his arm out of Harry’s grasp, frowning at him.
Harry held his breath. He shut his eyes and tried to get a hold of himself, tampering down the panic threatening to bubble over again. Finally, he looked up at McGonagall, avoiding the concerned looks both his parents gave him. “Yes, ma’am,” he admitted shamefully.
“Ooh, so the rumour is true?” cooed Hannah, batting her eyelashes too much for Harry’s liking. She had been trying to get with Harry for at least two years now, flirting with him in increasing strength so that Harry was almost always blushing when she was around. “You’re getting scouted by Puddlemere United?”
Slowly, Harry’s head began to clear and his heart rate slowed to a much more normal speed. With that came a great flood of embarrassment as he took in their situation, both sitting on the floor of a lavatory after Malfoy helped him down from some sort of asthma attack. Now that he was no longer fearing for his life or completely breaking down from anxiety, Harry felt the full extent of the pain in his hand, wincing and hissing between his teeth. He lifted his hand up gingerly to inspect the damage.
Harry straightened up, trying to smooth out his hair. “I told my parents the truth about—about my hand,” he explained. “I’ve been seeing a Mindhealer about it and it’s really helped me with those panic attacks you told me about.”
Malfoy huffed, folding his arms over his chest and cocking a single slender, pale eyebrow, giving Harry his signature sneer. “Don’t play stupid with me, Potter. Even if that’s the only way you know how,” he snapped. He interrupted Harry before he could comment. “You know perfectly well, Potter. Are you going to tell the truth about how you acquired your injury?”
He was just heading up to his Charms lesson with the other Gryffindors when Professor McGonagall called after him from down the stairs. With so many people around him, watching him closely, Harry could do nothing but oblige his professor in listening to her.
That evening, tucked away in a secluded corner of the library, Harry wrote a series of notes to give to his owl Hedwig to deliver. The first was a letter to Puddlemere United to explain that he would have to reschedule the match due to ‘unforeseen injuries’ and the second—and much more difficult—letter was to his parents to explain the situation as well. He was already dreading the response from his parents at getting himself injured mere days from what could have been one of the most important matches of his school career.
Malfoy cocked an eyebrow, looking suspiciously down at the proffered hand. After a long, awkward moment, he reluctantly took Harry’s hand and shook it. They both lingered perhaps a bit too long, looking into each other’s eyes.
He was well liked for his witty, sarcastic humour, daring nerve that had him getting into debates with teachers too often for his own good or pranking his fellow students and his friendliness that led to befriending anyone, regardless of their own popularity. He could crack jokes that had even the teachers hiding smiles and befriended students from all four houses through running the Duelling Club to help students with spellwork. With his messy dark hair and bright green eyes, he also had students of all genders throwing themselves at his feet, trying to get a date with him. He was also the Seeker and Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, bringing Gryffindor to the house cup 3 years in a row and everyone knew that it was just a matter of time before he went professional.
Harry ignored them, turning and slamming the door shut behind him. His heart was faster than ever, a tight fist squeezing around his throat until he choked, his feet carrying him through the school without him even registering it. Anger and betrayal and panic were clawing their way up his throat, rumbling through his blood roaring in his ears, thoughts scattering with each frantic step. He stormed all the way up the stairs again without looking back, a swirl of emotions thundering in his ears to the time of his rapid heartbeat.
Harry groaned, burying his face in his hands. “It’s just Puddlemere United,” he grumbled. “The manager is coming to watch the next match. I’d kill to play for them.”
When they entered, Madam Pomfrey was having a low conversation with Professor Lupin while she idly checked on a sleeping third year Slytherin. They both looked up at the two boys entering the room. Professor Lupin paled at the sight of Harry’s bloody hand, eyes narrowing on Malfoy while Madam Pomfrey crossed over to them in a few quick strides. Malfoy stood back as Madam Pomfrey began the process of healing Harry’s cuts and bruises, Professor Lupin eyeing them both with suspicion.
“Why didn’t you tell us you felt that way?” asked James at last, breaking the silence. “If I knew how much you felt the pressure, I never would have…”
“Well, you should have thought of that before you… caught your fall on the stairs,” interjected Madam Pomfrey.
“Professor, I don’t know what Malfoy told you, but he was lying,” Harry insisted as they made their way up the stairs. “I really did just fall on the steps badly. Honest.”
He very pointedly did not look back over his shoulder to see Malfoy’s dejected look as he stood alone in the corridor.
“Er, yeah, maybe…” He cleared his throat, coming to a stop at the end of the corridor near the entrance to the Gryffindor tower. “But anyway, I should really get to the common room. I’ve still got to finish that essay Remus set me about basilisks.”
“Yeah. If Quidditch isn’t what makes you happy, I don’t want you to keep forcing yourself to do it,” added James, looking at his wife over Harry’s shoulder before returning to Harry. “Sure, I loved getting to share that with you, but only if it’s what truly makes you happy.”
But Harry was focused on Malfoy, standing on the sidelines with his arms wrapped around himself, looking uncomfortable. Harry thanked some fourth year Gryffindor complimenting him and slipped past, pushing through the crowd of supporters and making his way directly over to Malfoy. He held out his hand, smiling at the other boy.
“Harry,” Lily greeted, her voice soft and gentle as Harry reluctantly took the seat next to her. She reached out to stroke a hand through his hair, like she used to do when he was a little kid crying about something.
“What is it, Dad?” he asked, stepping back from the hug and forcing a smile as the three of them started towards the castle together.
“NO!” Harry jumped to his feet. Both Malfoy and Professor Lupin jumped in surprise at his volume. “You don’t understand! I’ve
“Is it about how Romilda Vane is trying to spike you with Amortentia again?” enquired Ernie, pausing his direction to an affronted bishop on his chess board.
“Narcissa, My heart” Severus and Lucius said together their tones telling Harry that she was speaking the truth. He felt tears burning in his eyes as she pulled out a pretty floral handkerchief and offered it to him saying gently but firmly;
“I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to make you sad” Harry whispered his fingers trembling as he stroked the folds of the book. His uncle had always told him that he asked too many questions. She half expected the old woman to send him away but she simply pulled a locket out from under her top and opened it to reveal two photos. Stiff backed and black and white. The first was of an obviously much younger Mrs Figg in a white lace gown. Her hair looked almost as black as Harry’s with a mass of curls under a veil standing next to a plump happy looking man with thin circular glasses perched on the end of is nose. The second photo was two young men in uniform one appearing to be blond while the other had his mothers hair.
Hogwarts was as magnificent as it had been when they had visited with Harry’s father’s and the view from the lake made the rather pointless boat trip worth it. Hagrid kept trying to get Harry’s attention, but his brown-haired friend ignored him talking instead to Pansy and Seamus. The oaf looked upset though Draco cared little. He had no time for people that hurt his Harry and the giant of a man had been the one to deliver his friend to the Dursleys and that was unforgivable in his opinion.
“Yes, I think so, I mean…Dumbledore said I am…” Boy…Harry answered looking as bewildered as Draco was feeling.
“Yes, the door is open mother” Draco answered his arms still tight around Harry. The door to the changing room opened partially and Narcissa stepped inside. There was the now familiar smile on her face and Harry wanted to bask in it but instead he shrunk back ashamed of how he was feeling and how much trouble he was causing.
“When I first came to the wizarding world, I couldn’t take it all in either, Harry” Severus chuckled his hand on his shoulder guiding him forwards so he wouldn’t trip as he stared about. As Remus had said it was nothing like the zoo he had seen in France. Everywhere he looked there was something new to see only a few feet away there seemed to be a mountain range surrounded by an almost invisible wall that shimmered in the light. “My mother was a witch, but my father was muggle. We lived on a tiny street with the houses so close together you could hear your neighbour six doors away sneeze on the dust from her carpet. Father didn’t care for magic and we had no many to spare for luxuries, so I never came to places like this until I was in Hogwarts. Even though my mother had told me stories, they never did it justice”
“We have wasted so much time not speaking, I didn’t want to waste another minute. I asked Jinx to prepare tea, though Lucius has said we may have something stronger if you would prefer”
“There! Look! I can see one!” Pansy shouted pointed as they reached the Cheshire enclosure. She bounced up and down and then ran towards a large purple cat that had a large head that seemed to be grinning showing off a large number of teeth. “They are so cute! Look Harry! Quickly, He’s vanishing!”
“Thank you, Harry, you will be my best man, of course?” Severus hummed knowing that Lucius wouldn’t mind forgoing the honour. A glance at the man in question told him that he heartedly agreed with the choice.
“How can you say that?” Severus whispered his hand trembling and Harry watched the letter surprised when it seemed to answer the question that was asked.
“When I urged caution I didn’t mean spill the whole thing. What must Harry think of us, now” Narcissa sighed though she was smiling fondly at the girl who just shrugged;
“Potter-Snape…Um…Remus…He said that I should take Sev’s last name instead of his. Sev’ doesn’t know yet” Harry smiled remembering the excitement that had been in Remus’ eyes when he had suggested it. “Though I will have all my names read out in formal settings”
“Dear Lord Potter-Snape, felicitations on your adoption to Severus Snape and Remus Lupin. I have updated your accounts to reflect this change. Thankyou for your invitation for my wife and I to bear witness to the joyful event, as I said previously, we were disappointed to be unable to make it however I have received the memory of it from my son and it was a beautiful ceremony and I trust that you would be a very happy family for years to come. A gift for you lays here in the box, it is a traditional Goblin sword bearing the mark of family. It can be used but it is more a ceremonial piece and has spells to protect you from injury, but I had it made special for you and I hope it brings you joy. The runes on the handle mean family with your name, that of Professor Snape and Mister Lupin. I look forward to doing business with you in the future. May your axe always be sharp and your pockets plentiful. Yours in friendship Tormuld Ironside’
“Without question, Thistle” Narcissa nodded as she rose from her seat placing some money onto the silver plate that had appeared on the table. The coins vanished immediately replaced with a yellowed piece of paper. “Come then, Children”
“You’re a cute one” Harry chuckled positive that the bird was going to fall asleep on him and he found that he wouldn’t care if she did. A beady eye continued to watch him, and she let out a shrill, irritated noise when he stopped stroking her. “Sorry, sorry. I’ll keep stroking you”
Sooooo….Are you surprised by the wands? I really, really wanted it to be a surprise, I promise that there is a reason that Harry didn’t get his regular wand! But I hope that you like this one…The Major Oak is a real tree in Nottingham, its over 1000 years old and it is said that Robin Hood hid in its trunk to escape from the Sheriff of Nottingham. I have played in it so I can vouch that the middle would be big enough to hide somebody. 😊 Anyhoo…All aboard the Hogwarts express in the next part…
“Boy! If you’re not out here to make breakfast in five minutes!” Petunia warned not finishing the threat. It wasn’t needed. Boy knew what would happen. He would be forced to walk on the cooling coals until his feet were blistered and the hem of Dudley’s old clothes were covered in black cinders. Barely awake he hurried out of the straw nest he used as a bed and scrambled out into the muddy patch of earth between the barn and the thatched cottage. “Tidy your hair!” Petunia screeched looking him over and Boy absently pulled out some chaffs of straw and brushed it through with his fingertips. Today was not going to be a good day, he knew, but later he would be in the forests with his friends.
“The Potters?” Harry almost squeaked while Draco tensed just a fraction. Pansy didn’t seem to notice either reaction and continued in a happy sing song voice;
“You are an omega are you not?” Severus growled his top lip curling before he thrust out three letters. The top one was addressed to him and he stared at it in shock blood bubbling through his ears. He had never gotten a letter before!
“Agreed, we will send him an owl in the morning. This weekend we may travel to muggle London and purchase you what you will need”
“He didn’t have to say it, I could see it in his eyes!” Draco laughed before his expression clouded over and he looked upset. Slowly he started biting on his lower lip, a habit that Lucius and Narcissa were trying hard to get him to stop. “Though…I hope that you will stay here. Even when you are Lupin and Sev’s child”
“Why would the book be wrong?” Fred asked when Harry hissed the correct amount of Arrow-wart needed which was different from the text by two whole bulbs.
“Like in Doctor Who?” Harry hummed remembering the black and white show he had seen at the Dursley’s a few times. Truth be told he hadn’t bothered much with the muggle world since the end of the war. He had seen Dudley several times, mostly at the boxing tournaments he had been in and then again when he had opened his own gym but Harry had, for the most part, focused on the wizarding world in all of the countries he had visited.
“Not right away. But after knowing you for a while. It wasn’t much of a secret, to be fair, not many Harry’s in the wizarding world, much less with bright green eyes. Plus, we’ve seen your scar once or twice” Both twins answered motioning to Harry’s forehead. His scar was almost always hidden by his thick curly fringe but every now and then he would run his fingers through his hair revealing the scar. He did so now, causing Seamus to suck in a breath.
“I did not say I didn’t approve, in fact I think it is rather clever of you to start a friendship with the young hero of the wizarding world, there maybe some families in our circle that would not agree however I have very pleased with you” Lucius of course would think of what it would do for the Malfoy family and Draco had thought of it as well but in truth he had been bored and interested by Harry and he wanted to see what he was like.
“Always happy to help, your guardian will need to sign a few papers as you are not yet of age” Tormuld motioned to Lucius who took out his wand and placed it against the paper the Goblin was pointing to. It glowed red hot and then an elegant signature appeared on the paper glowing in a steel grey. “Thank-you Lord Malfoy, here are the items. I will send a copy of the records of the Potter and Black vaults”
“Take your hands from his person Pants, we have to go” Draco sighed his voice having touch of a hiss to it while he tugged the back of her dress again. Narcissa aided in getting her off him by humming;
“It really is! I wonder if any other Parsaltongue learnt to speak with Dragons.” Rolf hummed from over where he was mixing a rich vegan stew with a large handled wooden spoon. Harry gave a shrug, there was very little known about Parsaltongue, the only other speaker had been Voldemort and he wasn’t on to let in on his own secrets. For Harry it had made sense, after going to China and realising the Chinese dragon was more serpentine, he couldn’t resist trying to talk to it. The language hadn’t been the same, but it had been enough for him to understand and eventually learn to speak to the western dragon. The first time he’d tried in Romania had been with Norberta, Hagrid’s former dragon. The dragon had been surprised to say the least, but she had remembered him as being there when she was a hatchling and she had eventually agreed to teach him to be more fluent. That wasn’t to say every dragon wanted to talk to a creature that was basically food, but a few did, and it gave them an insight no one else had had. “I wish I could talk to Dragons!”
“Crow” The girl said with a jerk of the head her lips thin lines before the pair let out laughs and then moved forward. “It’s been a long time Crow”
“I met with Harry earlier at the Club. He had arrangements this afternoon with Luna and Rolf Scamander. Since I was in the area, I thought I would come and see you both.” He said smiling at his mother while his father let out a dry snort and hid himself behind his paper once more saying just loud enough to be heard.
“Aww its a pity it wasn’t real hens! You can’t start your petting zoo with only two doves” Hermione teased lightly coming to stand over him looking at the painting “But the painting it beautiful, look at the brush strokes!”
“But Dudley...” Harry argued his face throbbing and his lip wet from where it had been split on the handle of the cupboard.
“Draco, this is my good friend Brutus” Masaki grinned introducing the large male who took a step forward and began pawing at the ground with odd shaped paws. They looked like lion paws but there was a touch of hoof about them.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to wake you” Harry said as Lucius came to the bed a lantern floating a his side causing a deep orange light to flow over one side of his face. He was dressed in a grey dressing gown, a pair of black pyjama bottoms and some slippers on his feet. His hair was tied into a side ponytail and was resting on his shoulder fitted with a silk black ribbon to hold it into place. He didn’t seem to have been woken from sleep but Harry couldn’t help but feel as though he had disturbed the man.
“I don’t think that will be possible, Seamus” Bridget was louder now but once again her voice was lost as both the Legion and the Hummingbirds started talking. They praised each other and their game and Harry watched as Conner almost fell over himself to talk to Chai Charoen who was insisting that everyone call her CC in a friendly way. Whatever reason Sho had for coming down to the teams at all was lost as photos were taken and tickets were signed.
“Yes, where are Aunt Cissi and Uncle Luci?” He asked knowing that Remus still looked beyond surprised and repeated ‘Luci’ under his breath every time he said it.
Three hours later, just as Draco predicted Jinx and another two elves were in the room busily bossing them out of bed. The plan for the day was to drink the potion fill in the forms with Kingsley and Flitwick as witnesses for the ministry and then go to the Magi-zoo in the tower of London to celebrate and have lunch. Nino’s friend Masaki Aiba, the magi zoologist was going to be there, and she was excited to have him meet them. Harry had never been to a regular zoo, so he was extremely excited. More so than when he had been when they had gone to the magi-zoo in Paris, but perhaps that had more to do with the fact he was overly excitable today.
“And you’ve clearly got great sportsmanship, coming to shake hands with the captain of the opposing team!” he continued, gesturing a hand towards the Slytherin in question. Malfoy, who slipped away to the other side of the pitch when Mr. Burness approached, looked over with a frown. “I daresay you would make quite the fine fit with our team, Mr. Potter.”
Harry dove towards Malfoy, slapping a hand over his mouth as his voice echoed around the empty hallway too loud for his liking. His heart skipped strangely at the sensation.“Quiet! You don’t have to shout about it,” he retorted, dragging his hand away before Malfoy could shove it off. “Nobody can know the truth, alright? You can’t tell anyone. My friends will just worry about me and never trust me by myself for fear of it happening again and my parents will be so upset they’ll probably send me to a Mindhealer or something.”
“Right, okay, everyone. That’s enough for one night,” Harry said, blowing the whistle hanging around his neck. “Ginny, that was a great last shot there, keep it up. And Holly, much better than last week. You’re really improving.”
As he did so, Harry felt another rush through his head and he stumbled sideways, catching himself on the sink. He swore violently, having grabbed onto the sink with his bad hand, tears pricking his eyes again.
“Oh, yes,” said Mr. Burness, nodding. “I should say that as soon as you finish with your studies, you’ll be an excellent addition to the team.”
“There’s my favourite Seeker!” James exclaimed, opening his arms for one of his famous bear hugs. Harry rolled his eyes, returning the hug from his dad. He could already sense the lingering tension in the air.
After the match, which Gryffindor just managed to win by a sliver due to the many goals scored by his wonderful Chasers and every goal saved by Ron, there was a party going on in the Gryffindor tower. Instead of attending and hearing about how brilliant his friends were and asking why he wasn’t playing and being constantly reminded by his complete failure, Harry hid away in the Room of Requirement until he was sure everyone had gone to bed. The next morning, he woke up only hours later, heading straight to the library to take out a selection of books for class before hiding away in the Room of Requirement once again. He couldn’t get Malfoy out of his head. His memories kept flashing with Malfoy’s hurt expression in the corridor and he noticed the Slytherin watching him in classes much more frequently, leaving him blushing and confused at all times.
Harry laughed bitterly, humourlessly. “Oh, the right thing, was it? Your idea of the right thing was to go and snitch to McGonagall about my own personal issues even when we aren’t even friends?”
“Oh. Well, I’m glad you’ve got help,” said Draco earnestly. “I won’t apologise for telling McGonagall the truth, but… I am sorry about how it turned out. I didn’t mean to hurt you. I just wanted to help and I thought it was the right thing to do.” His pale cheeks flushed a pale pink and he ducked his head bashfully, looking at Harry through his lashes
It wasn’t until Harry finished all his upcoming essays and decided to make his way to the kitchens to beg a house elf for some food that he finally ran into someone.
They had another match against Ravenclaw in less than a week’s time and Harry’s mind kept trailing to the letter he received that morning from Puddlemere United; the manager from PU was coming to watch his next match to make a decision about scouting him. Ever since he opened the pale blue envelope with the navy blue seal, in classic Hogwarts fashion, the entire school was buzzing about the news, someone having let slip the details of the letter at breakfast. Harry kept getting hounded once again by his peers all day, asking if the rumour was true and somehow coming up with the most far-fetched details such as him dropping out early to join the team or how the entire team was going to come watch him.
The match itself was a huge success for Harry. The second he shot up into the air, he felt all of his worries of the last few weeks fading away to a distant blur, feeling the rush of the air as he soared through the sky. Ron was his usual excellent self, saving goal after goal from the Slytherin side and only missing a few of the more difficult ones while the Chasers—particularly Ginny—kept scoring on the Slytherin hoops and using all the new formations they worked on. Harry flew around the field, keeping an eye out for the Snitch while listening to the commentary from Neville. He even managed a particularly impressive Wronski Feint, diving in the opposite direction with Malfoy hot on his tail, pulling up at the last second and zooming back in the opposite direction.
McGonagall cleared her throat, breaking the silence between them again. “Now, we do still have to discuss the concern about your injury and I have several concerns about the alleged love potions spiking you’ve received…”
A few weeks later, Harry was whipping through the air on his broomstick, the sun beginning to creep behind the horizon as he finished off the last of the drills with his Quidditch team before their first match coming up that weekend. It was already getting cold despite October still being a few days away, leaves falling from the trees and the wind growing unforgiving. Harry just hoped their first match against Hufflepuff would at least be dry.
“Anyway!” interrupted James. “Two scouts is still great! I mean, the Cannons aren’t exactly the best team, but the Magpies are really moving up the league this season. That would be great if you played for them! You’d be able to prove yourself and get transferred to better teams!”
As Harry neared, he swore Uncle Remus gave him an apologetic look while James merely grinned broader.
Harry’s heart raced once again, but at least this time it was because he was snogging the life out of his school rival instead of another panic attack. He knew he would have to tell his friends and family about everything that happened in the last few weeks with Draco, but for now, he was just happy to lose himself in his kisses.
“Okay. Thanks for telling me,” he blurted. He patted Hermione’s shoulder and brushed past her, heading up the stairs towards McGonagall’s office.
Harry shook his head. He used the wall to get to his feet, peering down at Malfoy. “Well, it was all your fault it happened. If you hadn’t betrayed me, this wouldn’t have happened.”
Malfoy’s sneer only grew, his eyes flashing dangerously. He opened his mouth, no doubt to throw back some other cutting jab, but was unceremoniously interrupted by the appearance of their Potions teacher, Professor Blair.
And with that, Harry spun on his heel and marched out of the room, trying to hold back another set of tears.
“I’ll explain later. I promise,” he said in an undertone before turning to his teammates as a whole. “Right, everyone. Just remember our drills we went over the last few weeks and just how much we’ve all worked to get to this point. You’re going to do brilliantly.”
“Mr. Potter, it is a very serious claim that you harmed yourself quite drastically on purpose,” said McGonagall. “Is it true or not?” Her voice was gentle and calm, far from her usual stern and distant tone she used with students.
Harry looked up from his hand. Malfoy was crouched nearby, eyes on his bloody hand, bulging slightly and his face drained of colour even more than usual. His lips were pursed together in a disarming look of concern that Harry struggled to match with his school rival. Had he always been this gentle?
After the meeting with his parents and McGonagall, Harry tried to go back to normal again. In the following weeks, he went to all of his Quidditch practices and duelling club meetings with Neville, he completed all his assignments without complaint and put on a happy face as he hung out with his friends in the common room or the library or the courtyard. McGonagall was insistent that he start talking to a Mindhealer once a week via the floo in her office, to talk about his problems and his panic attacks, which was tiresome if somewhat helpful. He largely ignored Malfoy in the corridors or in classes when the blond continued to try to talk to him, but after giving him the cold shoulder multiple times, Malfoy eventually gave up and left him alone. That didn’t stop his own gaze from straying in his direction every so often, his heart heavy.
Without leaving room for any further comments, Harry waved jerkily to Remus and James and spun on his heel, half sprinting the rest of the way to the common room.
At the end of Harry’s rambling speech, the room fell into an uncomfortable silence. It was only broken by Lily’s occasional sniffles as she cried into a hanky and James reached across Harry to rub his hand up and down her back. McGonagall watched Harry over the top of her spectacles with a concerned and alarmingly delicate expression.
“What do you mean you can’t play the next match? But the manager from Puddlemere United is supposed to watch you!” exclaimed Ron the following morning when Harry explained his situation to his friends over breakfast.
“I mean, you can, but that’s not what it’s about, is it?” said Harry, cocking an eyebrow and folding his arms. He leaned his broomstick against his side, lips pursed.
“God, you look so much like your mum like that,” said James, snorting. Harry continued to frown in silence and he dropped his shoulders, sighing dramatically. “Alright, so it’s not
McGonagall sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. “Be that as it may, Professor Lupin and Madam Pomfrey backed up this claim themselves. You don’t believe they had any ill will, do you?”
Aside from Professor McGonagall sitting behind her desk with a grim expression, both of Harry’s parents and
He paced back and forth, clenching his fists at his sides or tugging at his hair, losing all control of his breathing. He was sure he was having some sort of heart attack, vision blurring with his tears and mind spinning with panic and dread.
Somehow, he found himself at the top of the Astronomy Tower, pacing in circles, tearing his hands through his messy hair and trying to get a grip on himself. His vision was beginning to fade, black spots in his peripheral, his chest heaving with each frantic hyperventilation. He didn’t know what was wrong with him, terrified of himself, unable to get his breathing or heartbeat normal again.
All he wanted was to be alone for once. He was sick to death of people going on and on about the match and Quidditch and the scouts and his dad’s talent and everyone’s expectations for him to live up to his father’s legacy or even surpass it. His dad’s voice echoed around his mind with all his words of encouragement and constant urges to try harder, growing louder and louder in his mind until all other thoughts blurred to silence. The letter from PU was etched into his memory like a tattoo on his eyelids, his mind circling with the contents of the letter and the many other letters he kept receiving regarding his Quidditch career until his head was spinning.
“Ugh, not again. Was last year not enough?” grumbled Ron, going pale. In their previous school year, Romilda Vane repeatedly tried spiking Harry with love potion and Ron managed to get himself spiked when he stole one of Harry’s chocolates one time. The embarrassment of having to get dragged to an irate Professor Blair after a very public proposal to Romilda and getting dumped by his girlfriend Lavender Brown as a result left Ron wary of any food offered to him for weeks.
Harry pushed Malfoy away gently and turned, sliding down the wall and sitting with his forehead against his knees. Malfoy kneeled in front of him and Harry clutched Draco’s arms in a weak attempt to ground himself. Much like last time, he made Harry follow his lead through a series of breathing exercises until he was finally able to breathe normally, murmuring gently through Harry’s muddled thoughts.
“Malfoy! Draco! Draco!” Harry called out, sprinting up the field, jostled through the crowd of people heading up to the castle. They called out more congratulations, but Harry ignored them, tearing his way over to where Draco Malfoy was walking up to the school by himself.
As soon as he was finished with the letters and his homework for the next day, Harry slipped them into his backpack, slinging a strap over his shoulder and heading in the direction of the owlery to deliver the messages to Hedwig.
Ron snorted, adjusting his grip on his backpack strap as they pointedly ignored the calls of Harry’s name, heading towards the Potions classroom. “Your hair
Mr. Burness grinned, patting Harry’s shoulder. “I’m sure you’ll make your father proud. He truly was an excellent player and it’s great to see you following his footsteps,” he commented. And then, with a final nod and a smile, he turned and headed off again.
“Fine. But good luck facing James Potter’s wrath when he finds out you’re keeping me from playing Quidditch,” Harry snapped.
Harry rolled his eyes, taking a step closer. “Yeah, well, classic Slytherin helping someone without them even asking for it or wanting it,” he murmured.
“Maybe not, but I’m sure you’ll be getting even more scouts as the year goes on, Harry,” insisted James with an air of confidence Harry wished he had. “I saw the last of your practice. You’re doing great, obviously, but I think if you really start pushing yourself and working on getting the snitch even faster, you’ll have even more scouts coming for you. You might even get a national team scout!”
“What’s this?” snapped Professor Blair as she swept into the room all dark robes and pointed black hat, scowling between Harry and Malfoy. “Arguing already, are we? Ten points from both your houses.”
“You could never disappoint us, sweetheart,” cooed Lily, stroking his hair again. “We just want you to be happy.”
“Yeah, and I’m sure you’ll be fine either way,” added Ron, dropping into a seat at a table near the back, next to their friend Neville Longbottom. “You’re a brilliant Seeker and you’ve got hundreds of options. You’re smart enough to do just about anything you want.”
“It’s a physical response to having intense anxiety or panic,” Malfoy explained slowly. “You can get hyperventilating and shaking and rapid heartbeat and even more stuff. I get them all the time.”
He watched, as if from some other detached body, as his hand began to bleed profusely, blood splattering the broken mirror and shards flying everywhere. He hardly noticed the pain as he simply sobbed pathetically and hyperventilated, clutching his bleeding hand to his chest.
“Get off—me,” Harry gritted, yanking his arm out of the other boy’s grasp. He spun around, glaring at Malfoy with all the venom he could muster. “What do you
Professor McGonagall marched up the stairs, holding up her green dress to avoid tripping. She stopped only a few steps below him, giving him a stern look. “Mr. Potter, I need to speak with you once again in my office,” she stated.
Draco had seen him at his very worst and yet he was still here, kissing him in the shadows of the trees and the music of the birds and the distant chatter of their classmates.
Professor Blair started working at Hogwarts shortly after Harry’s parents finished school, after the retirement of Professor Slughorn. She was the exact stereotype that Muggles might think of when they thought of witches with her long dark hair, sweeping black robes and a pointed hat, standing over potions cauldrons all day. She was a fierce and strict professor who took points off regardless of house affiliations and never tolerated any misbehaviour or backtalk.
McGonagall looked at his hand over her shoulder, eyes narrowed. “I seriously doubt that, Mr. Potter,” she remarked. “And you’re not getting out of talking to me or your parents that easily. You may have been able to slip away last night, but you cannot do it a second time.”
He knew he was being childish, hiding from his problems and his friends, but even the notion of seeing his friends and being reminded of his situation made him positively sick to his stomach.
Behind Harry, someone scoffed loudly. Harry didn’t have to turn around to recognise the pompous, stuck up laughter from his school rival, Draco Malfoy.
As he traipsed through the empty corridors by himself, his breathing grew ragged and his heart raced, his stomach tying itself in knots of nausea and his blood rushing in his ears like a roar of the crowds always egging him on. He was hardly aware of where he was going or what he was doing, bursting through the door of one of the boys’ lavatories just in time for him to burst into tears.
