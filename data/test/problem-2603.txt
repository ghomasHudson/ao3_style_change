Malfoy, glancing at Minerva and Poppy, flushes and says shortly. ‘Yes. Idiot.’

He frowns at her. ‘Yeah, how’d you know?’

With that one moment, everything about the moment changed. This wasn’t just a friendly game between rival seekers. This was a stollen moment. A secret.
heading down the slope. At this rate we won’t be found for hours. No one will even know we’re missing for ages. Stupid glasses.’
‘No.’
‘Taking Muggle Studies doesn’t mean I suddenly know everything about Muggles. you know.’
Draco offers him a cheeky smirk, hands clasped around Harry’s shoulders. ‘Whoops,’ he says, not at all sorry.
She hesitates.
Especially seeing that Blaise has taken to noticing every little thing Draco does now. Not that Blaise notices the things that Greg notices. No one does.
He stomps over to the gathered group of students outside the greenhouses, feeling as if the entire universe is conspiring against him.
She raises one eyebrow. ‘Were you expecting someone else?’
‘Er, hey Harry,’ she says, staring at her captain with raised eyebrows.
‘Yeah. I mean, well, no. Apparently someone is dying, but no one knows who it is.’
‘I do say so,’ says Lavender. ‘After all, it’s Valentines Day, it’s the
Potter straightens, smirk slipping back into place. ‘Great. Just checking,’ he says and shoots Blaise another wink. ‘Guess I’ll just go with the toaster then.’
Worry tightens Ginny’s chest and she struggles to control her breathing, to not let the dark thoughts surge up through her and slow her down. She keeps the boys just within her sights, her legs burning, her feet pounding against the marble floors.
‘They’re you’re best friends,’ says Zabini. ‘Neither of them have said
The briefest flash of a scowl lifts his lips, but then his expression settles back into that pinched, worried kind of look. Honestly. He was going to give himself wrinkles walking around all tense like that.

‘I…it was an accident,’ he says, his voice catching. ‘I didn’t mean it, I wasn’t even trying to cast a spell, I just wanted him to go away. It was an accident, I swear, I tried to make it stop. I tried, I don’t know…’
‘Neville,’ says the seventh year.
Before dreamlessness can consume him memories go crashing through his brain. The match. Flying through the air. Potter laughing. The bludger, heading straight for them. Shock, fear, realisation. It’s going to hit them. It’s going to hit
detail.’
Draco ducks between a few trees, leading Harry up a small hill.
‘Sure,’ says Brown slowly. ‘Thanks, Harry.’
The kiss. They’re…
The cart pulled away. Unable to stay still, Harry leaned forward and tracked the ride with his eyes.
Potter shakes his head. He turns away, scrubs a hand through his hair again, and turns back. ‘Just, tell me one thing. What’re you so afraid of?’
Malfoy nods. ‘And the original?’
think is going on?’
‘Well, I—’
‘Dumbledore made me a deal,’ he says through clenched teeth. ‘If I help him, he’ll keep mother out of prison.’
‘Only when Hermione makes me,’ says Harry.
‘I am not,’ he grinds out through gritted teeth.
Sullen blue eyes flicker back to Severus. ‘What?’
and oh well, everyone else can just fucking deal with it, right? Like taking all the food on the trolley cart, like there’s no one else on the damn train who wants to fucking eat. Like getting onto the quidditch team a year early because whoopy-do you’re Harry fucking Potter. Like running off to the department of mysteries instead of
‘When you were in that fire, he wouldn’t leave you. The others all went. But me and him stayed. If it wasn’t for him, I’m not sure I’d have got you out on my own. I…I know I’ve been a right git about it all but, look I think he actually cares about you and—I can’t
The Girl, standing back from the two boys, winces, staring at the Speaker with another expression that Blue doesn’t understand. Blue twitches her tail. She wants to understand. She wants to know why her humans are so sad.
Harry, who is hunched over, shoulders shaking as he tries unsuccessfully to stifle his snickers, shakes his head. ‘Nope,’ he chokes out.
Potter trudges into Poppy’s office—still in his pyjamas—and slouches in the doorway. Despite the fact that he’s had dreamless sleep almost every night this week, there are dark shadows under his eyes, making his sallow face look paler than it already does. He’s taking longer to recover than last time, and though she knows it’s a sign of his advancing condition, she also can’t help but think a large part of the problem is this mood he’s entrenched himself within.
She clenches her jaw, sighs, and finally relents. ‘I suppose I could talk to the headmaster,’ she says reluctantly. His face lights up, but she cuts him off sharply before he can say anything more. ‘But
‘Just go!’
The spell is an air bubble charm, and it settles around her head as she steps into the smoke filled room.
They head out, and the quiet of the corridor beyond is almost oppressing after the noise of the common room.
Whatever Harry was going to say is lost to the perplexing expression that replaces his uncertainty. He and Neville take the scrolls addressed to each of them and the girl stumbles back out of the compartment.
is a sixth year. And yes,
‘Yeah,’ mutters Zabini. ‘Him and most the school.’
Outside, Malfoy has dictated a new direction. ‘Come on,’ he says. ‘Let’s go get ice-cream.’
Draco Malfoy stands near the far wall, weighing a bag contemplatively in one hand; his own bag slung across his shoulder.
It’s only the underlying panic lacing Draco’s voice that has Harry looking up, his hands stilling over the intricate pattern-spellwork he’s just spent the last forty minutes setting up.
She pushes down the emptying corridor, blinking away dark memories and trying to the think of things that made her laugh—like Fred and George had taught her to do. At least the lunch rush is over, making it easier to manoeuvre the corridor outside.
Malfoy is right, of course. This relationship is bad news. At least for Malfoy. The boy is on the wrong side of the war to be taking up with the Boy Who Lived, and Phineas wonders what in the name of Magic possessed Malfoy to get involved with him in the first place.
Parvati offers her a small smile, looking back at the banner. ‘It is beautiful.’
This year is no different. In fact, this year Narcissa has taken extra pains to ensure that everything is perfect, due to the fact—no,
Luna trots over to the table, sitting down on the corner next to Malfoy. He glances up at her as she sits and winces.
‘So, from your conversation it sounded like you’ve suspected this for a while?’
Molly hears him swallow. ‘Er…thanks…I mean I know we argue a lot…’
‘What? No!’
Draco hesitated. ‘Well, I won’t deny that I miss the snow. But,’ and he drops his gaze over Harry—water dripping from his scruffy hair onto his bare shoulders, ‘I think I can forgive the lack of snow, just this once.’
‘Ah, let me,’ says Zabini and waves his wand, conjuring three more chairs around the now rather small table.
He feels the bulk from the stack of photos he’s already developed. A week’s worth of sitting out in the cool afternoon breeze, trying to time his photos just so—to capture the action of the various quidditch players as they dart through the air.
He steps away, but Draco catches his arm. ‘
Lavender, annoyed that this argument is ruining her chances at a wonderful Valentines, drums her fingers across her table and watches them.
Nonplussed, Ron can’t think of anything else to say except: ‘why?’
not any better. Hermione is almost at her wits end, unable to deal with trying to mediate the awkward tension between them.
that the Black estate has several houses, some of considerable size—after all, that was supposed to be mine.’
Harry picks at the window sil with his fingers. ‘Yeah,’ he says quietly.
‘Narcissa,’ he says, enunciating very clearly. ‘You do realise what you’re asking me could get not just both of us killed, but also Draco himself.’
Draco’s expression morphs into sudden realisation, his grey eyes widening as he stares down at the-Boy-Who-Is-Not-Draco’s-Boyfriend.
Severus rolled his eyes. ‘Sorry Narcissa,’ he mutters under his breath. ‘But there are some things even I cannot undo.’
‘This says you were bitten,’ says Ron, gesturing with the open book.
Mr Zabini, relatively quiet until now, snorts in derision. Severus’ gaze snaps instantly to him and the boy flushes and glances sideways at his friend. Mr Goyle does not, however, meet his gaze and only stares in dumbfounded shock at the ground, his eyes far away and his mind, no doubt, fixed on the very subject they were now discussing.
Harry merely twitches in response, the well of magic circulating him in fluctuations mirroring his conflicting emotions. It shows itself in flickers of sparks and little embers of fire spilling forth from his hands. Albus watches in morbid curiosity, at once impressed by such a sudden eruption of power, and concerned by how obviously little control Harry has over it. He had thought the situation more under control than it apparently is.
Harry glances back up again, and offers a nervous grin. ‘Guess we make a good team after all,’ he says.
‘An Occamy,’ repeats Hermione, surprised. ‘Those are rare. And aggressive. I do hope you were careful.’
Malfoy’s smirk dims. ‘That’s a no, right?’
An odd stillness falls over Harry. ‘It’s…fine,’ he says, and refocuses on his drink.
of his aunt.
Colin hesitates. ‘It’s a photo of the two of you,’ he says.
Malfoy slumps back against the wall. ‘Merlin this is a mess.’
‘I said,’ says Blaise, affecting an air of aloof superiority. ‘That Granger is not my type. Your sister, on the other hand…’
Remus narrows his gaze at her. ‘Why would I know about any teenage romances at Hogwarts?’ The moment he says it, realisation slams into him. ‘Wait, Harry? You think
A bright splash of colour catches Luna’s eye and she turns, spying the corner of a red, leather bound book beneath the nearest shelf of tomes.
. Is it so wrong for me to want to know a little more about your life outside of home? You’ve hardly spoken to me at all about school. Or, am I too old, now to be included? Is your mother no longer privy to the details of your life?’
He snorts and glances up at her, one eyebrow raised.
Neville tries not to gulp again. ‘I don’t want anything,’ he says.
‘No,’ she says. ‘It cannot be Severus or me. Picking one head of house over the other will just make the other boy feel outnumbered; and besides, most of us teachers are too busy to go chaperoning an excursion like this for a full day. Not with NEWTS coming up.’
He turns back to Harry, smirking. ‘Still frightened of your fans, I see.’
Zabini and McLaggin jerk back out of his way sharply as Harry makes for the door.
unacceptable. I’ve half a mind to suspend
At the sound of his voice, Harry twitches, but otherwise doesn’t move from his prone position. Hermione frowns. Since Lavender’s revelation Hermione has watched Harry and Malfoy interact more closely. Lavender, of course, was right. They sat together far closer than was needed. They were always passing things back and forth between them unnecessarily, to the point that Hermione is annoyed at herself for not having noticed it herself.
Tonks rolls her eyes. ‘Merlin Moody, relax, would you? What’s a few Auror’s relaxing after a shift?’
‘What’d you say about Hermione,’ Weasley all but shouts, turning around sharply at the sound of Granger’s name.
‘What d’you think happened?’ asks Greg. ‘You think Potter found out about…’ he trails off, his gaze flicking nervously to Theo and away again.
Minerva tilts her head and follows her out into the main wing. The room is quiet and cool, and Poppy expects to find her charges still asleep. Previous experience with Potter has indicated that he doesn’t sleep well, and she’s made sure to include dreamless sleeping potions in his retinue of potions in all visits since the previous year.
Irritation works it’s way up Harry’s spine. What was with the constant smiling?
‘Merlin. Was he hurt?’
He goes silent. He’s still staring off into nowhere, but there’s the slightest lift to his lips—a small, bittersweet smile that lingers on his mouth and in his eyes. Harry can only stare, suddenly quite unable to breathe. He drops his gaze to his own mug of deliciously warm cocoa, made just the way he likes it, and swallows hard.
Another rustle of clothing. ‘It doesn’t sound like hissing. It just sounds normal. Like they’re speaking english.’
Unlike Pansy, Daphne and Theo follow Blaise up from the table. Greg and Vince are too wrapped up in their breakfasts to have even noticed what’s going on, and Blaise feels a twang of sympathy for them.
‘And be responsible for you freezing to death? I think not,’ he says. ‘And anyway, we’ll warm up in a minute.’
Then she frowns, and waves her hands in Narcissa’s direction. ‘Sit, sit, I’s get the presents ready.’
His gaze snaps up to hers, an objection on the tip of his tongue.
name,’ says the Girl.
So I kinda dropped off the face of the Earth and I'm sorry. However, I'm happy to say that my health problems have all but resolved themselves. I still need to take things slow for the moment as I'm still catching up on a lot of sleep loss, but things are getting better.
‘Why wouldn’t I be?’ he asks, trying—and failing—for innocence.
Potter when he’s tasked with the mission of killing Potter’s mentor? It’s so absurd it’s hysterical.
the start. You know this can’t last. How can it?
‘And you broke up with him because of that?’ asks Ron.
Pansy frowns. With a disgruntled huff, she mutters something undignified about boys, and saunters off after the rest of their classmates.
Seeing that Draco had changed his mind four times over the course of the morning—and once more in the half hour before class—Blaise isn’t sure which book Draco had actually chosen.
He sighs, his entire frame drooping into the doorframe. He glances up, dragging his gaze from the floor to meet her eyes.
‘What in the name of Magic are you two knuckleheads talking about?’ Mad-Eye scowls.
‘Alright,’ she concedes, ‘You didn’t only panic. And you recovered better.’
Dread fills Malfoy’s face, but Potter just grins, tightens his grip and drags the boy off to the shops.
‘Okay but you can at least
Something occurs to Draco. Something that washes any ounce of arousal and warmth from his body.
There’s an odd flush to his skin beneath the bruising on his face, and Harry’s desperation is growing. He looks at Ginny, gaze imploring and understanding washes over her.
She explains her idea, and some of the frustration seeps out of Minerva’s expression. A small smile twitches at the corners of her lips. She looks over at the two boys, a contemplative expression in her eyes.
content, and twists within the confines of the tank to rub against one of the rocks. She is glad she will be getting a new home as she has grown far too big for this one.
Albus watches them go and, as they reach the door he adds, ‘I’m sure I don’t need to say this, however, a bit of discretion also would not go astray.’
Ron glances over at Harry, pointing his fork at him. ‘Yeah, you don’t really want to give him any more reasons to start shit?’
Ginny takes a step toward him, leaning forwards to hiss, ‘What is wrong with you?’
‘Alright, come on Draco,’ comes Blaise’s persistently cheerful voice, the sound of bed curtains being pulled back echoing behind his words. ‘Let’s go get some coffee into you. I’d rather you weren’t a complete and utter sodding nightmare today and--oh...er...well, this is awkward.’
Luna shakes her head and decides that she really must start working on her wrackspurt charms, before the situation gets out of control.
‘What are you talking about?’
Harry thought he was doing—Harry scrambles to his feet and runs.
Harry shrugs. ‘He’s my best mate,’ he says helplessly.

Theo swallows. Tries to unstick his throat. Before they notice how shaken he really is.
Harry opens his mouth, no doubt to snap something harsh in reply, but Minerva gets there first.

‘What? In the Slytherin dorms?’
They stumble and the blond has to brace himself against the sinks so they don’t go tumbling over onto the ground.
‘But he almost
Draco blinks and his expression turns cool. He straightens his shoulders. ‘I’m not sure what you’re talking about?’ he says stiffly.
‘Odd?’
‘You know, I think I’m starting to work it out.’

In truth, she’s so tired she’s not sure how much longer she can keep treading water. She’s not had a lot of experience with swimming, and the task is harder than she’d thought.
‘Dying? But you can’t…you can’t be dying. I mean, there has to be a way to fix it, right? There’s got to…’
Chapter Fifty
Malfoy and his goons are arguing, but Ron isn’t paying attention. He yanks his arm free from Ginny and turns, his wand raised.
‘Shall I send him back to class?’
Thistle blinks her big eyes, glances over at Bella, and offers Narcissa a knowing nod. ‘Of course Mistress,’ she says, and quickly rearranges the piles. ‘Alright, Master Draco, these be’s your presents sir.’
Minerva freezes for a moment as all eyes fix on Potter. By the time they swivel to her, however, she’s composed herself by pulling a stack of paper’s toward her to grade. That doesn’t stop her from hearing Potter’s response though.
Understanding flashes across her face. Understanding…and horror.
Something changes in Potter’s expression. The intensity returns and he straightens up, staring at Draco with those burning green eyes.
‘I…’ Potter trails off. He swallows and looks back at the floor. ‘I didn’t mean to.’
‘What’re you trying to do,
Madam Pomfrey offers her a brief smile and dips her head. ‘They’ll likely be asleep for the rest of the night, but you’re welcome to sit with them until curfew if you wish.’
‘I’m not the one who—‘ Draco cuts himself off. ‘You know what? I don’t fucking care. I don’t care about you and I don’t care about fucking Potter.’
‘No, it’s quite alright,’ the Professor says briskly. ‘I understand that for a muggle-raised child like yourself the concept of electricity and technology may seem rather dull to you; but as you’ve so eloquently pointed out not all people in this class are as familiar with the subject of this class as yourself. Therefore, perhaps you’ll benefit from pairing up with Mr Malfoy here and working on your assignments together? Perhaps if you’re focused on helping each other, you’ll refrain from anymore interruptions for the rest of the class?’
Harry mutters something low and inaudible, and stomps out from the showers in nothing but his trousers, a towel slung around his shoulders. ‘Throw me my shirt will you?’
‘So you don’t mind failing then?’
‘Potions practice,’ she says, blinking. ‘You know. With Malfoy.’
Malfoy shrugs, leans back on the table and twirls his wand. He raises an eyebrow at Harry.
Harry rolls his eyes, shaking his head. ‘You’re hopeless.’
Hermione returns the smile. ‘That sounds like Hagrid.’
Harry laughs again. ‘We’re still getting no where. I feel like I’m getting whiplash with all this back and forth.’
‘Shouldn’t you?’ the Girl retorts.
‘You’d think he’d give up by now, the great git,’ he says, and nudges Harry, not even noticing that he’s barely in control. ‘But you show’d him, eh?’
Potter returns the smirk in a manner eerily reminiscent of the Slytherin he’s mocking (a clear indication that they’ve been stuck spending far too much time together). ‘You’d be lucky to get my help,’ he says, still leaning on his table. ‘This class is
She drops into the seat opposite his desk and laughs. ‘Keep up Kingsley,’ she says. ‘He
Colin’s grip tightens on the bag, and he reconsiders his idea to bring the photos out of the safety of his bag as Harry Potter drops into the seat directly opposite Ginny. The seat that happens to be next to Colin.
‘Merlin, Lovegood, make a noise,’ Malfoy snaps, taking a startled step backwards.
He yanks out his wand. Theo flinches, but Draco isn’t pointing it at any of them. He flicks his wand at his curtains and they swish shut around his bed, the obvious quiet of a silencing charm going up following on it’s heals.
When they get to the right corridor, Harry paces back and forth along the wall with practiced ease, the annoyance fading away under the familiar motion. He thinks of the room the DA had used, and before he’s even made the third pass the door appears. Harry grins, and steps in, almost forgetting about Eric until the boy follows him.
Instead all he can focus on is the utterly miserable look on Harry’s face as he sorts through the copious amount of red, heart shaped letters that have landed in front of him. People stare at him and whisper—as if none of them have ever heard of subtly—and Harry’s shoulders turn inwards.
‘What, switched?’ Zabini asks, his tone and expression incredulous.
‘Is that better?’ Harry asks, his voice low, curious,
Draco blinks. Then he realises it’s
‘You’re not going to tell me either, are you?’
‘Who cares,’ says Ron, cutting a sharp look across to Hermione.
Next chapter is almost finished, and definitely kicks up the fluffy level.
‘Alright?’ he asks, keeping his voice low and quiet.
By now, a significant portion of the table is eavesdropping and Blaise relishes in the irritated glare Granger is not-so-surreptitiously shooting his way. Well, if she didn’t want him goading information out of Potter she should’ve been more explicit with the specifics of their bet. As it is though, teasing Potter into tripping up is fair play.
Ginny raises her eyebrows. A cheeky grin flashes across her face. ‘Again, Harry? My, my,’ she says teasingly.
are…are…what
Theo sighs heavily, annoyed at having to point out what is, to him, quite an obvious flaw in their reasoning. ‘Not if Potter is gay,’ he says, keeping his voice carefully void of interest.
Potter tilts his head. He turns and mimics Malfoy’s position against the wall, leaning back and gazing up at the ceiling.
‘It’s been a few nights since I’ve done a proper dessert. What do you think, Harry, should I make a pudding? Or perhaps some brownies? What do you think your Mr Malfoy would enjoy?’
‘I didn’t buy it. I made it.’
kissed you. That kinda voids his little “it’s not going to happen” speech, right? Obviously he likes you, otherwise he’d have just kept flirting with you to mess with you. The fact that he told you it was a bad idea means that he
Severus knows what’s happening, but not
‘Really Ron?’ she asks. ‘Harry, ignore him. He’s just being an idiot.’
Colin flushes. ‘Does it involve photographing the horned serpent?’
Blue looks up, catching a flash of auburn as the Girl stalks away after the Speaker. She looks at the Pale One. Human body language is still confusing, and so she tastes the air, trying to determine what the look on his face means.
approval. Did I not need Potter’s?’
Without a word, without so much as a single look at anyone else, Malfoy slips the photo into the pocket of his robes. He casually flicks through the last of the photos, and, with one last arching of his eyebrow, he hands the pile back to Colin.
Well, maybe he’s not a
Poppy hands out several potions to each boy and waits until they start drinking. Malfoy sniffs at his cautiously, glancing up at her warily, unlike Potter who downs his without hesitation—having been through this routine many a time before.
‘We are! Sort of. Look we didn’t start the fight it just…happened,’ he sighs and runs a hand through his hair, wincing when his hand brushes passed a cut above his eye. ‘Can we do this later? I just…I really need to talk to Ginny right now.’
Harry surges forward, grabbing Draco by his stupidly nice-looking turtleneck sweater, yanking him forward and kissing him on his stupidly nice-looking mouth.
‘Scared, Potter?’
He rolls his eyes and stomps over to the tree, flicking the shield charm back up by way of answer. Harry settles back down on the ground beside him, leaning into Draco with his shoulder.
‘That you made?’
Irritation burns along Deans spine, and he storms toward the two girls. Rumours claiming Harry is dating someone new are a knut a dozen—and
Phineas raises his eyebrows. While he is aware of the seating arrangement rigged between the boys, he was under the impression that they hated each other. Malfoy’s words, on the other hand…
‘I’m fine,’ says Harry, cutting her off sharply.
He emerges a minute later, fiddling with the shirt collar, and comes to a stop, raising an eyebrow at Potter. ‘Well what’re you standing around for? Are you going to pick a shirt or what?’
The trunk lid was open, it’s contents scattered across the floor as Theo dug through it. A letter from his father lay discarded on the floor, telling him exactly what to look for. He pulls out more books and pristinely folded clothes, throwing them carelessly around him, mindful of the fact that he only has a limited amount of time before his dorm-mates return.
‘But…I thought you realised…’
Harry.
‘But you
James Potter, took one look at his son and called them the same; but Minerva knew better.
As if she’s a small child in need of coddling. She narrows her eyes at him and he offers her a brief smirk in return. Ugh. Utterly insufferable. It irks her that Draco and Blaise have suddenly found common ground. She preferred it better when they were at each other’s throats. It gave her more leverage when she wanted something from one of them.
‘Because you’re standing out here in the freezing cold hitting bludgers,’ says Ginny dryly. ‘C’mon Harry, somethings obviously got you worked up. Tell me what’s wrong.’
Confidant - Ginny:
topic once the others arrived) and surveys the room. There are several boxes stacked up in the corner and she raises one eyebrow, smiling as she narrows her eyes and contemplates the spell she needs. She bites the inside of her mouth, twirling her wand through the air.
‘This has nothing to do with Potter.’
the only logical answer of which sends Harry into full blown panic mode.
‘Draco,’ says Narcissa as the meal finishes. ‘Shall we go for our ride?’
With a sigh of relief, he grabs at it and hurries back up the stairs.
Tonks grinned, turning to admire the beast. It’s iridescent, pearl scales glitter under the ambient light the dome casts.
‘He, uh, he was,’ Malfoy frowns down at the table top, twisting his hands around the rag he’s been cleaning with. ‘He was sick.’
‘Oh?’
‘…why you even bother,’ Malfoy is saying.
He’s stopped slicking it back, and it falls around his face in fine, loose, white strands. Harry, despite his flair of temper (or perhaps because of it), has the sudden impulse to run his hands through those strands. To tighten his fingers through them and find out what Draco Malfoy’s lips
She shrugs, looking toward the house, her mind flashing back to the various run-in’s she’s had with school mates. ‘Occasionally.’
‘Hello Hermione,’ says Luna, turning her large, unnerving blue eyes on Hermione.
So it is late, I am functioning on incredibly minimal sleep (sick kids, yaayy.....), I have not edited this one bit, or even glanced at it since I wrote it but...here you go anyway.
‘Mr Potter is suffering from magical exhaustion.’ The headmaster’s voice is as calm and gentle as ever and yet they send Draco’s vision into a spin.
Ron flinches. ‘You heard about that?’ he asks, dropping his gaze.
Glass shatters somewhere in the distance, and Ginny jumps.
‘I’m not doing anything—ow! What the hell, what did you just do to me?’
He tilts his head at Nott and the two of them proceed to class. Hermione sighs, and hopes that she won’t come to regret this decision.
Potter smiles. ‘You’re okay.’
‘No,’ says Harry, his breath wheezing. ‘I can…I can do it. I can…’
‘Sorry,’ she says with a smile and jogs to catch up. ‘Lost in thought.’
‘What? No! He was almost killed this morning.’
’Now,’ he says slowly, ‘think about how your body shifts its attention. How everything becomes tense, but in a good way. It’s slow at first. A kind of stirring. The way your insides start to coil. How everything seems to tighten and grow. Everything else goes out of focus, you know? You want more. More tension, more friction, more touching.
‘What the hell is going on?’ asks Ginny, coming over to grab Ron’s arm. ‘Everyone is staring.’
She winces, cursing her habit of voicing her thoughts. The Bloody Baron was
Blaise resists the urge to snicker.
‘Why didn’t you tell me about any of this?’ asks Remus, a little hurt that she hadn’t confided in him.
?’ he said again, just behind her shoulder ‘Please sign the form.’
Hagrid smiles, claps his hands together, and says. 'Alrigh' then, I have a treat for yeh.'
‘What? Seeing as we have to start getting along, I don’t see the problem in appreciating the finer points of other houses.’
‘Wait, blood? Where was the blood?’
Albus steps around to the other side of the bed and begins a complicated spell, pulling the focal point of magic in the castle wards to this section of the school and funnelling it toward the boy, pumping enough magic into the boy’s body to sustain him while Poppy works.
Hermione blinks and frowns at his almost finished essay and the half a dozen books he already has scattered on the table. Then she spots the real reason for Harry’s abrupt departure.
Potter laughs, quiet and mirthless. ‘You don’t know why I’d save you?’ he glances up. ‘You haven’t been listening to me at all, have you?’
‘Relax, I don’t mean right now,’ he says, shaking his head. ‘But soon. We can’t have you thinking that Hogwarts is an adequate home. There has to be
‘Maybe Draco can offer some insights?’
‘Has anyone ever…I mean, do you think that, if people can change—if they can become
Like the way Draco disappears out the common room door half an hour before breakfast. Which isn’t all that unusual, except that Potter is waiting on the other side. Greg has a good view from where he’s sitting at the study table, getting in some last minute homework.
‘So? You could’ve levitated me—‘
, why were you two talking about snogging.’
At lunch, she watches as Malfoy and Harry make their way into the Great Hall, straggling in after their joint Care of Magical Creatures.
‘What do we do first?’ asked Ron, staring around the park with wide eyes, his mouth gaping open as he turned in a circle to survey the sheer magnitude of colour and noise around them.
‘Yes, Ron, it is,’ says Hermione, shaking her head. ‘Honestly, sometimes you can be so dense.’
‘Hello Luna,’ says Hermione with a smile. She takes Ron’s arm and pulls him into the room. ‘Hello Harry,’ she says, sitting down in one of the spare visitor chairs by Harry’s bed.
Three days, three days he’s been home and yet, Narcissa has hardly seen him. He mingles at the parties, polite and yet reserved. He holds himself back at dinner, smiling at all the right moments, but never in a way that reaches his eyes.
‘You don’t?’ asks Malfoy in disbelief.
‘Hey Malfoy,’ says a new voice, one that Blue does not recognise.
She smiles. ‘Of course,’ she says, and starts down after the two of them.
Narcissa edges forward on her seat, casting a quick smile toward Draco. He smiles back at her, but it doesn’t quiet reach his eyes.
Dean’s expression sours. ’You really think I’d say something?’
The blond clears his throat and looks away. ‘Look, Potter…’
Blaise straightens. ‘You’re getting in late,’ he remarks.
‘Can I have Hedwig? Just…for a night?’ he glances toward her, his shoulders drawn inwards, still chewing on his lips.
Dean stares at her, fury and outrage making him sputter. Did she…did she just
‘Excuse me?’
It’s—Something funny, Potter?’
The spell holding Theo snaps and he staggers forward, almost falling on his face. Draco turns abruptly and flings something vivd and red at the nearest bed. The room explodes into feathers and bits of tattered fabric.
‘Thanks, Neville,’ he says in a soft voice.
times.’
‘I heard.’
‘Why’d you sleep next to me all night?’
Potter looks exasperated. ‘You want to be friends?’ he asks, incredulously. ‘So, we can’t be together, but we can be friends?’
Dean frowns at them. ‘Uh, yeah. I guess.’
Draco scowls at the empty hallway in front of him as he stomps toward Gryffindor tower, unsure yet what he’s going to do when he gets there, but half tempted to blast his way through their portrait door and demand to know where the hell his idiot Gryffindor has gotten too. He’s checked everywhere else. The library, the astronomy tower, all their secret nooks and alcoves, hell he’s even checking in with Myrtle, but his wayward Gryffindor is nowhere to be found.
‘Even though it’s hot and sweaty.’
For the life of him he can’t think of anything else. Nothing, of course, except the obvious.
‘Oh? So it’s true then? You broke up?’
fault.’
‘Do you need a hand, Lav?’ asks the Patil sister from where she’s finished packing up her own things.
‘Yeah well, it’s not like a had a choice in that matter,’ Malfoy mutters, rolling his eyes. ‘And just because I’m not taking the class doesn’t mean I’m an idiot. I still have the books. Making Muggle technology work with magic is a pain in the arse, and so inconvenient.’
person he’d talk to about issues like this.’
Draco glances up, frowning. ‘Pity?’
Draco shrugs. ‘However you want,’ he says. ‘However you need me to.’
?’ she asks. ‘About…? But I thought that was over?’
She smiles at him. ‘Not this house,’ she says. ‘Since you’re almost seventeen now, I thought that you might like to have a place of your own. This is the Ward Key to Black Lane. It’s yours.’
Harry nods. ‘Alright,’ he says in a slow, hesitant voice. ‘But…do you think we could maybe just sit for today?’
‘Do you know why it happened?’ asks Hermione.
‘Well, if you like.’
‘Pansy,’ he says warningly.
‘Gin!’ Dean is racing toward them.
‘Perhaps, but your tolerance for said moron seems to be improving.’
Draco shrugs. ‘I was just wondering,’ he says, but he frowns up at the tree above, feeling somewhat unsatisfied by the answer and not knowing entirely why.
Silence that echoes with the muted tone of disbelief descends on the room; until Severus, never one to keep his temper, erupts with, ‘you used an
Harry looked up so fast his neck cracked. Malfoy leaned against the wall outside, watching him with shrouded eyes. He looked as immaculate and arrogant as ever, except…except there was something in that gaze. In the way it stayed pinned on Harry, never once straying toward the inside of the room where his friend had died.
Ginny looks up from her essay. There’s a spot of ink on her nose that makes her resemble her brothers more than usual. Luna doesn’t point it out. She feels that Ginny won’t appreciate the comparison. Ginny isn’t overly fond of being the youngest of seven, and while Luna understands the need to make a name and place for oneself, she can’t help but feel that she herself would be positively thrilled to have siblings to resemble, no matter how annoying.
the way it was before.’
‘Really? Because it’s all my Slytherin’s can seem to talk about this afternoon,’ he says.
Smith. For an entire year. He wasn’t sure which one was worse.
‘Uh, hi,’ says Romilda.
What it comes down to, as always, is Potter.
in his brain overwhelms every other thought. For a moment everything goes dark.
‘Alright,’ says Poppy, banishing the boggart with a flick of her wand. ‘That’s enough.’
‘Hm? Okay, do you want a hand?’ she asks, but Harry is already up and speeding toward the shelves.
The scowl he gives her could melt butter, and she winks at him, smiling in victory. ‘Anyway’ she says lightly, ‘that’s all I had to say.’
Malfoy groans and leans back into the wall, running his hands through his hair and dislodging the pristinely arranged strands. ‘Merlin talking to you is like talking to a wall. You just don’t listen. All we’re doing is going around and around in circles.’
He felt his face twist into a scowl, furious and frustrated. ‘Fine,’ he growled, pulling his hands free from her grasp. ‘Fine.’
‘I guess I just don’t like feeling so exposed,’ Potter mutters, his voice barely audible above the running water.

that Minerva is momentarily stunned. ‘You look after me better than my own relatives do and anyway, you and Pomfrey are basically like my parents at this point, so I don’t see
‘Well thank Merlin for that,’ says Severus sarcastically.
Tonks almost laughs at the expression of mingled disbelief, pleasure and wariness warring over the Dragon Keeper’s face at Potter’s announcement. As the trio stop just shy of the (still huge) baby dragon, the Keeper settles on satisfaction, obviously pleased to have people admire his charge.
It’s almost comical, the way his eyes go wide, the way his expression pales into complete horror as his mouth drops open, speechless and sputtering.

‘Don’t worry, Miss Granger,’ says Madam Pomfrey, tucking Ginny in with expert hands. ‘They’ll be asleep before long, and by the time they wake the potion will have worn off.’
‘Stop,’ says Harry, rolling his eyes.
Archie chuckles. ‘I thought the yellow house was supposed to be for the meek ones? I think maybe he’s in the wrong house,’ he says this to Hagrid.
‘Er,’ says Harry, tilting his head. ‘It’s a painting?’
for heavens sake? So Ron wanted to spend the day with a girl instead of fixing his friendship with his best friend. That was
Luna frowns. ‘Does anyone else feel…heavy?’ she asks.
Hagrid rubs at his beard again. ‘Mebbe, hard teh say though, they been ‘ere so long now. They’re not used teh flyin’ out fer the season.’
Before Mad-Eye has a chance to get started on the predictable tirade on constant vigilance and the benefits of transparency in an uprising, Kingsley and Tonks both look at each other and—at the same time—say,
That relief had been cut short the moment she began to read in earnest. The moment she began to understand.
‘That’s not fair,’ Earnie says. ‘How come the rest of us can’t have that option?’
Ginny laughs. ‘Understatement, isn’t it? Well, when are we making this official?’
‘Jesus, Hermione are you really bringing that up
‘Fuck I don’t know, because you Slytherin’s get a kick out of making people beg? Come on just, grow a heart and tell us what you know. I’ll pay you if that’s what it takes.’
infuriating?’ Potter snaps, uncrossing his arms and gaping at Malfoy in outraged disbelief.
‘Uh…yeah,’ says Harry, and his shoulders droop.
Chapter Eighteen
Malfoy stares at him for a long moment. ‘The prophecy says one of you has to die?’
Malfoy sits up, slowly, still giving Harry that wide eyed stare and Harry thinks he might throw up. Or pass out. He’s not entirely sure which, only that his insides have just turned to jelly and his brain is short circuiting over the monumental realisation that he’s just kissed Draco Malfoy.
‘Well come on, out with it then.’
Ron shakes his head, disbelief curling through his gut. ‘Truce?’ he barks. ‘With
Bella squeals with delight over some gift or other, but Draco never looks away from Narcissa as she peels away the wrapping paper and lifts the lid of the box beneath.
‘I imagine,’ she says into his hair, ‘Draco is the sort of person who would not express his feelings unless he was very sure of himself.’ She gives him a soft squeeze, before releasing him. ‘And of you.’
‘Oh, don’t start,’ snaps Ginny. ‘I’m not in the mood.’
Slughorn coughs expectantly and Potter’s head snaps back up, as if he’s only just remembered they’re in the middle of class. He blinks owlishly and rubs at his glasses.
just sign it?’
‘Just…trust me, hitting that shield with a spell is a bad idea,’ he says.
Harry glances up, frowning. ‘What—oh,
He says this in a smug tone, clearly thinking he’s brushed aside her concerns and Minerva makes a mental note to remind Poppy to run any of Potter’s foolish plans by her
‘So he sprained his ankle! He was running from Death Eaters. I think he was more concerned with getting away from them than remembering
Harry shoots him a sly smile. ‘Too small?’
You guys are all awesome so I put a rush on this one (I hope it turns out okay).
As if each gift of chocolate or quidditch related memorabilia, or knick-knack of some other is a shadow falling over him.
Ron frowns at her. ‘You make it sound like you

‘Cold, Luna?’ asks Ron, glancing sideways at her.
‘One of those is written by a wizard?’ Potter asks, eyebrows raised.
Mr Goyle blinks up at him uncomprehendingly. ‘Huh?’
in Nott’s direction. The boy is basically non-verbal, and even if he
Harry laughs. ‘Well if you need a hand wrestling it into submission, let me know.’
He stares at the leaf, uncomprehending, and she gestures at him with it. He takes it from her hand, pinching it between thumb and forefinger, and staring at it as if it might bite him.
Albus, musing on the dramatics of teenagers, senses the glares of his two remaining staff. Minerva and Poppy are both glaring at him as if it were
‘About what?’
He remembers what Malfoy said the night of the fire. About fighting for Harry. About doing things that no one else would.
Albus glances up with the kind of vague smile that so often frustrates Phineas. ‘If only,’ he says.
He saunters off, pulling the photo back out of his pocket to look at it as he goes.
A grin stretches across her face, and she shoots Romilda the kind of expression that two close friends might share…only, Romilda and Ginny weren’t friends.
They spend twenty minutes trailing through the winged horse section. Hagrid and Malfoy actually manage to hold a conversation over by the Abraxan heard, while Potter looks on in amusement, idly sipping his coffee and absently petting one of the foals that has come up to him. Neither of the other two notice.
, he doesn’t need to be supervised every minute of the day. No matter what Mad-Eye says.
So far there’s been no need for her presence. She knows (from Mcgonagall’s letter) that the boys are being passed off as brothers from Hufflepuff, and with their disguises they certainly look the part, but Tonks finds herself increasingly amused by the way they’re interacting.
‘Theo,’ says Draco, still in that same low voice. ‘If you tell anyone, if you put him in any danger, I’ll kill you.’
Draco gapes at him, shocked into speechlessness. For once. Then he yanks out his wand. In a flash, Theo has his own wand out.
Draco snorts and flicks Harry in the head. ‘Hopeless,’ he repeats.
‘Draco is okay,’ she says, and Severus doesn’t miss the fact that she didn’t answer his question. ‘Well, Draco is as okay as he can be.’
‘Uh, I’m not sure that’s--’
‘Seems you
Ron shakes his head. ‘Wait, what…are you not…together? Anymore?’
‘Can we go look closer at the dragon?’ he asks.
Malfoy frowns. ‘What the hell is a Tonks?’
Kingsley’s eyes—which hadn’t even blinked at the term “boyfriend”—widen imperceptibly. The man was plain unflappable. ‘Well,’ he says,
to you?
‘Yes, Potter, we’re good.’
Ron swallows, scowling down at the ground. He clenches his fists and grits his teeth. When he looks back up, there is a determination in his face worthy of the lion he wants to become. He’s still standing a step below them, so that they are staring down at him from a greater height, but that doesn’t diminish the fierce resolve in his eyes.
‘Sure,’ says Harry, glancing sideways at Draco with a sly smile. ‘Let’s go with that.’
Malfoy rolls his eyes and shoves the book Luna gave him at Harry. ‘Read this.’
Ron grins, piling up all his money and shrugging. ‘I’ve had some time to get used to it.’
Harry sighs. ‘I know,’ he says. ‘But it’s home.’
‘Draco? You awake?’
Harry sighs. ‘I bet,’ he says, blinking rain out of his eyes and staring up at Draco’s shield. ‘What’s one more detention, hey?’
‘How about we hear the next presentation,’ interrupts Professer Burbage. ‘Mr Smith you may redo your assignment, so long as you do the research properly this time. I think Mr Potter has given you enough to go on now.’
Harry chewed on the inside of his mouth. ‘What if I said yes?’
Ginny looks up from the photos she’s inspecting with interest. ‘You got photos of those two flying?’ she asks, her voice impressed.
The bed where Potter is laying.
He scrubs a hand through his hair. ‘I know.’
Harry sighs. ‘And what will people say if you’re suddenly going around hexing people in my defence.’
Dean resists the urge to roll his eyes. ‘Yeah, I do,’ he says. ‘Especially when you’re talking loud enough for people down the next corridor to hear. About
‘It was my fault!’ he blurts.
At least then he’d have an outlet for all the nervous energy keeping him awake at night. He runs a hand through his hair, and instantly his mind flashes back to one of the dreams. Soft caresses and touches and Harry groans, scrubbing at his face.
‘Er,’ the Speaker says, glancing between Blue and the girl.
‘What?’ Harry asks, and then shakes his head as he realises the state he’s in (the fact that he didn’t even notice speaks
Some of the sludge, which somehow didn’t manage to spatter any further than the immediate radius around their desk, siphons away into a vial the professor produces from inside his robes.

Blaise can’t contain a snort, and turns away, turning is laugh into a jagged cough, hiding his smile in the crook of his elbow. Theo, the guy who never utters two syllables when one will suffice, stuck next to the loudest person in all of Hogwarts.
have an ulterior motive. How positively Slytherin of you. I suppose next you’ll be leaving out some of these books in conveniently placed locations for them to stumble upon?’
Harry doesn’t answer. He’s already turning the corner toward the room.
their family values due to a simple crush?’
‘Is that good?’
‘You’re not stupid.’
The first is that it's not my intention for Hermione to come off as a bitch. She loves Harry and Ron, and cares about them, but she's also naturally curious and so it's in her nature to want to figure things out - like this mystery with why things have changed between Harry and Draco.
She stares in wonder at the painting within.
on me!’
‘Sure,’ says Brown again and allows Potter to steer her from the room.
‘What’re you doing up here?’ he asks.
He shakes his head. Straightening his shoulders, he pushes past Ron without saying another word.
The fact that Remus was spending Christmas at the Burrow was merely a coincidence. Really. After all, Potter was here too. As a member of the Order it was part of her duty to check in on him (not to mention that bet she had with Kingsley over the outcome of the Zoo excursion).
‘But I didn’t have anything to drink,’ Potter protests. ‘We just sat around eating chocolates and talking about…oh god. Romilda.’
Ginny looks shrewdly between Harry and Colin again. ‘I expect details later,’ she says, gesturing at Harry with her fork. ‘Also, Colin, if you don’t send in that shot of me scoring, I’d love to have that photo. It’s a great shot,’ she pauses, winks at them and adds, ‘Plus, Ron looks like he’s about to fall off his broom.’
‘Why would there be something going on?’ asks Harry, still in that same low, sarcastic voice.
It’s his turn to scoff. ‘Yeah, you lot are a whole other species.’
‘God Ron—’
‘Oh for Merlin’s sake, Potter,’ says Draco, rolling his eyes and crossing his arms. ‘You really need to get better at this. Look, Myrtle, was it? We’d appreciate it if you didn’t say anything.’
is…is…well it’s just…
‘Now, first,’ she says when they’ve both finished. ‘You’re going to tell me exactly what happened earlier today. Then, you’re going to explain everything else.’
Blaise, however, rather enjoyed a good bet. Besides, a quick glance at Potter and Draco has him sure that he isn’t going to end up out of pocket for Draco’s mistake after all.
‘I’m sorry, I—’
Malfoy glances away, staring off into the distance. He nods, reaches into another pocket and withdraws a single golden galleon. He tosses it to Colin. In his rush to catch it, Colin almost drops the pile of photos. He stares at the coin in confusion.
Draco peers over the edge of his towel at Potter, raising an eyebrow. ‘Excuse me?’
sarcastically.
Ron’s mouth goes dry. He stares, unable to move. Unable to
Not a moment later a shadow falls over her and Dean.
The burning in Ginny’s gut swells, and she flicks her wand at Zabini, who winces.
despise him,’ he snaps. ‘If Potter wants to go around shagging any moron who lets him that’s his choice. What do I care?’
‘Isn’t this why you followed me out here?’ says Harry in a soft voice, turning his face into the blond’s neck.
Malfoy cuts Harry off before he can say anything more. ‘Relax, Potter. I won’t do anything to them. I just want to see.’
She sighs and wishes she’d just done what Justin did and asked Harry.

Potter laughs, abrupt and loud, startled at whatever joke Malfoy has made. He glances sideways, flushes pink and turns to look back out at the enclosure.
While Thistle is organising the presents into several piles, the two house elves return, distributing the hot chocolates and eclairs that Thistle had ordered.
They all stare at him in varying degrees of disbelief and envy.
He glances nervously at the two remaining seats; one next to Malfoy, and one next to Zabini. He drops his gaze to the floor and heads to the seat next to Zabini, slipping into the seat with a nervous smile.
‘That’s not possible,’ says Ron.
Ginny rolls her eyes. ‘Trust me, no one cares,’ she mutters.
She runs the tips of her fingers along dusty book spines, her fingers pattering along the soft fabrics and hard covers. She rounds the corner and almost runs headlong into Malfoy and Harry.
) as Harry pulled him forward and pressed their lips together for the first time. For the first of thousands, he hoped.
Moments start crashing through his mind. The Alley. The Attack. Draco sodding Malfoy desperately casting healing charms and cradling his head. Draco pulling him into the space between carriages on the Hogwarts Express so no one could see Harry having a melt down. Draco Malfoy taking him to the Hospital wing and not telling a single person when Madam Pomfrey declares that he’s fine, he’s just having
Blue! What the hell?’
Hermione purses her lips and fights the urge to say something about how not fine that response was.
So, can anyone guess McGonagall's plan?
Hermione catches Zabini’s eye. He smirks at her, tilting his head at his friend.
‘It is when they involve “the saviour”,’ she says. ‘By the way, if you call him that to his face there’s a fifty-fifty chance you’ll get hexed.’
Chapter Three
Harry nods and does so, moving first to wash his hands and then reaching for the flour without Molly having to tell him which container it is. She smiles. If she’d have instructed Ron or Percy or even Ginny there’d have been a lot of griping and question-asking just over which container it was, let alone any of the rest of the instructions.
Her heart aches and she wants to reach out and wrap him up.
‘Draco darling,’ simpers Pansy in what is supposed to be a sultry voice.
‘Potter,’ says Poppy, stepping hurriedly forward, her voice sharp, ‘calm down.’
There’s no hesitation from Potter, and despite his earlier irritation at Malfoy, he’s kissing back with as much ferocity as Malfoy is giving.
Chapter Six
He swallows, but his breathing is too rapid, and he sways precariously.
Malfoy looks up at him, a frown etched into his features. ‘Are they from the fire?’
- I’m sorry.
‘What about when I sleep?’ he asks.
Victory lights Blaise’s face, and he reaches over to tug playfully at the braid in Ginny’s hair. ‘Somehow, that does not surprise me,’ he says.
‘You don’t know?’
‘Are you kidding? If I take him to St Mungos there’ll be a record.’
He shakes Potter’s hand exuberantly, and Potter laughs awkwardly, obviously embarrassed about the attention.
I’m saying this—he might really be good for you.’
that?’
Perhaps it’s the unexpected “please”, but she doesn’t berate the boy for interrupting her. ‘Why not?’
After all, he doesn’t know
He hesitates, makes a split second decision to trust that Draco was smart enough to get the hell out of there, and darts down the street in the direction of the echoing blasts.
He shakes his head, tries to put Malfoy’s bizarre turn of character out of his mind, and focuses on the one important thing Malfoy said.
No one did. Apparently Muggle camera’s weren’t different enough from Wizard technology for anyone to show an interest in. Hannah sighs in relief, and retakes her seat.
How the hell is going to keep his cool around Malfoy for an entire day now?
‘Mum!’ he squawks, his face flushing bright red. ‘I…gees, you can’t just
‘Ron, don’t,’ he says. ‘He’s just joking. There’s nothing—’
Malfoy looks at him like Harry’s lost his marbles, and Harry thinks he rather might have. He doesn’t feel like himself. In fact, he feels a bit like he’s dreaming, and that at any moment he’s going to wake up, sweaty and breathless, as he has most nights since the summer. It doesn’t help that Malfoy’s been a see saw of contradictory actions ever since that day in Diagon Alley.
Hermione marvels over that. If this was their Harry, did that mean that the Harry of a few moments ago was Malfoy’s?
She spots the rest of the sixth years over by the corner bookcases and trots over, disappointment making her sigh as she drops unceremoniously onto the couch.

Something isn’t quite right with
Tension pulls his shoulders taut and his expression closes off. He glares at her, fury turning him quiet and calculating.
Potter, ever the hero, crouches down, reaching for the paper and Theo’s mind is screaming. It wasn’t supposed to be him, damnit. It was supposed to be—
‘Yeah,’ he says sheepishly and runs a hand through his hair. ‘Sorry. Again. It’s been a shitty few days.’
He sits at the end of the couch, staring about with that utterly lost look, like a house elf that has lost it’s master. Pansy rolls her eyes. Honestly, he could at least
‘Sorry,’ he says, rubbing his head and looking up. ‘Didn’t see you—Malfoy?’ he chokes off, coughing over his own words once he sees who exactly it is he’s run into.
This time when Harry steps into the room there is no painting. Scorpius is sitting in a magic crib, happily playing with a set of levitating blocks.
‘Give you?’
‘What the hell was that about?’ Ginny asks, staring after her brother.

‘It was odd,’ says Hermione, and pretends not to notice the intensity in Harry’s gaze as it snaps back to her.
‘What do you mean you don’t know?’
Draco is staring at Vince, a contemplative expression on his face, twirling his wand around and around in his hand. The way he always does when he’s trying to puzzle something out.
‘Don’t want to watch me die,’ says Potter with a sigh.
Theo has more important things to worry about.
Blaise shoots him a glare and Greg winces. Theo, to his credit, doesn’t flinch.
Dora glances across at him, her expression guarded. ‘What makes you say that?’
‘Go to the wall,’ she says her tone is hard and demanding obedience. 'Now!'
Harry reaches for his glasses, fumbling them as his heart beats a staccato rhythm in his chest.
‘I’m quite good, you know,’ she says, smirking in full now. ‘I could…tutor you.’
Malfoy frowns, his shoulders stiffening as Potter focuses his attention on anything but the boy beside him.
The night air is cool and crisp and Neville winds his way around the side of the castle, so excited he has to take extra care not to trip and fall on his face. Not that he’d care if he did. For the first time he feels like even falling won’t stop him. He’s full to bursting with pride.
and he thought it was the most hilarious thing in the world. I stayed up all night just to make sure he was okay. And this morning he was so lethargic. Not his usual self at all and now…now
‘For Merlin’s sake Potter, I’ve
Potter snorts. ‘Tell me about it. He asked me to “give him his support”.’
Draco’s head whips around to stare at her, grey eyes wide and open, flashing with shock and perhaps, a little bit of fear. It’s only because she’s caught him off guard that she sees it. Really, the best way to throw off any Slytherin—Draco in particular—was to ask the question you actually wanted an answer to. They were so used to manipulating each other that being upfront was usually enough to rattle them.
‘It sounded like it hurt.’
She gives him a cool look, as mistrustful as any of his housemates, before relaxing her shoulders and offering him a soft smile. ‘Yeah, it was. Thanks.’
He growls in annoyance, throwing his bag on the floor and glaring at her.
‘You think Draco is
‘Oh, I thought we’d just use the room the DA—er, the club I ran—used,’ he shrugs. ‘Thought it’d be easiest.’
Draco chuckles and straightens, not moving out of Harry’s lap but giving him room to straighten up. Only Harry stills, his eyes flashing wide, his cheeks flushing red.
‘Might as well get it over with,’ he says, and heads in.
Ron bristles. He’s all but ready to step into the room and ask what the
‘These,’ says Professor Burbage, ignoring Potter. ‘Are two fantasy novels. One, is written by a wizard. The other, is written by a muggle. If you can tell me which one is which, with adequate reasoning, I’ll pass you for the entire year.’
‘And if he loves someone else more?’ she asks, her expression morphing into one of desperation. ‘Am I to make him choose?’
. This getting ridiculous.’
‘Hey, did you hear about the fight in the Slytherin dorms?’
‘Fuck,’ he swears, shaking out his hand.
Harry scratches at the back of his head, like he always does when he’s embarrassed, and pulls away. ‘What’re you even doing here?’ he asks, looking down at Malfoy.
‘Way. He’s in the Hospital Wing. They’re trying to patch him up but he might not make it.’
‘So,’ says Draco, his tone shifting toward condescending. ‘This sort of thing probably makes them feel dirty. Like they’re doing something they shouldn’t be doing.’
Well, this
can. He told me so.’
Ginny chuckles. ‘Because I saw one flirting with you as I came over.’
- Thanks for the books.
He closes his eyes and groans, resigning himself to the fact that he’s going to have to go out into the cold.
‘Important?’
Harry rolls his eyes and shoves him. ‘Don’t call me Potter.’
Still, there are enough students lingering about in the corridor that by the time she blinks away the memories, Harry is already pushing through the doors between carriages.
Ron’s complete bafflement is almost endearing.
They all look at him. Pomfrey’s expression shifts, as if just remembering that he’s in the room.
,’ she says.
‘What the
. How can you be such a complete asshole, and yet so…so…I dunno just,
he’s going to be a total nightmare this week.’
Tonks blinks. Pistachio? Guess she has more in common with Potter than she thought, because that was—
‘You didn’t have to pay for the shirts,’ says Potter for perhaps the tenth time since their food arrived.
Dennis stares at him as if he’s lost his mind, and Colin half feels that he might have.
The Boy jumps, looking up with wide eyes at the newcomer. His expression shifts into a scowl, anger flashing through his eyes at the human girl.
‘I’m fine,’ he says, tone despondent.
He scoffs, and glances out into the street behind her, ensuring that there is no sign of Narcissa’s older, less hinged, sister. ‘Unlike you, I don’t have time to wait around on the whims of others. Well, at least you’re alone this time,’ he says, just to confirm (one can never be certain when it came to Bellatrix Lestrange).
At least the panic has subsided, he reflects. Belatedly, he realises he can hear more than his own grumbles of pain. Malfoy, wherever the stupid sod is, is swearing.
‘Uh, please don’t,’ says Malfoy, looking up at her.
, Weasley?’ Snape says, and—without warning—steps into Ron’s place. Brushing Harry’s friend aside as if he’s nothing.
Harry rolls his eyes and looks away, throwing his arm up over his eyes. ‘A bit.’
‘I dunno,’ he says to the floor.
Hannah glances back, almost hesitating in the doorway. The tension between them is stifling, and she wants to sit them down and make them talk about it, like Professor Sprout does whenever two Hufflepuffs have a particularly loud row, but she knows it’s neither her place, nor would it be appreciated.
‘Sorry,’ says Colin again.
He thinks about that.
For a moment Ginny thinks he’s calling out to
Professor Burbage tells explains, telling them all about “carnival games” and “rollercoaster” rides. Things that Hannah can barely comprehend. She stares at the model, at the small locomotive device that shoots around and around a track of twisting and turning rails, wondering how on Earth Muggles had managed to build such a thing.
Potter turns around. ‘Oh?’ he says, and there’s a slight challenge in his voice.
Draco frowns, rescanning the crowd again. He spots a bright flash of red that can be none other than Weasley and scowls, still bitter about yesterday. Longbottom and one of the other Gryffindor girls whose names Draco can’t be bothered remember are next to him.
‘I always see you two together lately. Her and that Ravenclaw girl. The odd one. What’s her name? Looney?’
Her eyes fly open just in time to see Ron slam his fist into Harry’s face.
She trails a hand along the wall to see if the stone has cheered up any. Though she can still taste sorrow on the tip of her tongue, she thinks the heavy feeling is fading. There’s a hopeful sort of hum trailing through the walls, warming her fingertips.
The thing is, he can’t let it go. Aside from the satisfaction of beating Granger in this bet (which, yeah okay, had started out as a joke), he can’t help but feel that if he is right, if Draco and Potter have somehow managed to put aside their differences and become friends, then there might actually be some hope for the rest of them.
Predictably he trips over the trailing blankets and slams into the edge of Potter’s bed.
‘I have to say,’ she says, eyeing Ron with a smile, ‘I am impressed with how well you’re taking this.’
‘Well I’m
‘Er, well, I have detention, remember.’
Next to her, Earnie McMillan stifles a snort of laughter, quickly turning it into a low cough before anyone notices.
is it that you want from me?’
Draco’s voice cuts off in a rustle of sheets and bed springs. The whole room freezes in static tension. Draco is on his back on the bed and Potter is leaning over him, magic curled around one raised fist, eyes wide with fear.
‘No idea, probably Malfoy just throwing another one of his tantrums.’
‘Yeah,’ says Blaise, but he’s staring at Draco with that calculative gaze, and Theo feels dread settle into his stomach.
. Did you really think no one would find out? Did you really think this was
Clearly he’s gone stark raving mad.
‘Shocking, I know,’ says Malfoy dryly, and he turns, those cool blue eyes landing unmistakenly on Colin.
Draco shrugs, not bothering to look away from his inspection of the ceiling. ‘Apparently it’s called a “walkman”. Whatever that means.’
‘Then what
Ron whirls on her. ‘Hasn’t done anything?
‘Because it was your bloody idea to go down this stupid mountain in the first place.’
Zabini snorts again. ‘He’d skin me alive.’
to spend—
She pauses, giving him a significant look, like she can see right through all his denials and protests and read him right down to his soul. He swallows, lowering his gaze.
Hurt attempts to curl itself around the base of Theo’s spine. He shoves it away, reminding himself that it was
‘I still don’t know how they do that,’ he mutters, glancing around the room for some secret entrance.
And that’s when Hermione’s hunch pays off. Whatever guilt had been plaguing Harry pops like a balloon.
Harry, never one to back down from a challenge, straightens up. ‘Alright, let’s do this.’
?’ says Malfoy, gaping at the Gryffindor woman.
‘Great,’ says Harry. ‘Let me know if I can help. You know, without breaking anything.’
Well, she wasn’t expecting
She raises one eyebrow at him and he shudders, half turning away from her. His breath comes faster and Poppy purses her lips. She steps forward.
Neville straightens and reaches out to take the paper. Professor Sprout’s familiar cursive curls across the parchment.
‘You,’ gasps Draco, half bent over, one hand on his head the other on his wand, ‘had no right.’
? She turns to look at Neville, who flushes under her gaze.
A/N: I know, I know, I'm two updates behind. Have no fear, I've not abandoned the story already. Rather, there's a severe stomach bug going around the city I live in and I've spent the last week being violently ill, which doesn't really lend itself to good writing - thus why this chapter is so short. Never fear though, I hope to make it up to you, if not in the next chapter but the one after that.
,’ Albus says, still with that tiny frown he’s trying to hide. He glances hopefully at Severus, but Minerva jumps in before he can ask.
Red swarms up Harry’s neck and cheeks, but he grins. ‘Right,’ he says. ‘Uh, I can put her away?’
the cheery, eager Professor, Lisa could feel the woman’s resolve cracking.
‘It’s not just your lack of guardian approval,’ she says to Potter. ‘There are a dozen other perfectly good reasons that you shouldn’t go.’
Draco throws him a grin (a rarity these days) and nods, ‘of course,’ he says, a smirk slips easily into place. ‘I would expect nothing less.’
It’s as if the air itself takes on the taste of despair. It’s bitter and tangy, and it leaves Luna feeling wretched and exhausted. A feeling of foreboding spreads through her, and she shivers, the cold gripping her with clawed hands.
Minerva rolls her eyes. ‘Not that that’s ever stopped them before,’ she says dryly. ‘You do recall their little trip over to the Department of Mysteries last year.’
Despite what she knows, it’s still bizarre to see them like this. Casually chatting above a game of Quidditch, each as relaxed as the other. That relaxation filters down into the rest of them. For the first Slytherin versus Gryffindor match, there’s been far less aggression than there usually is.
‘Well, she does have six older brothers,’ offers Seamus. ‘It’s no surprise she can handle herself.’
‘While I appreciate the thought, Charity,’ says Minerva with a small frown, frustrated at their lack of options. ‘I do agree that we shouldn’t make too much of a fuss about it. There’s no sense in us all rearranging our schedules to make it work.’
‘Oh really?’ Draco asks disbelievingly, narrowing his eyes, ‘So then, you must get a lot of action?’
do. I’ll do whatever it takes to keep him safe, and if that means I have to go through you or anyone else, I will. He’s mine, and I
‘Dean?’ asks Ginny, concern flashing over her face.
McGonagall waits. She stands stoic, one eyebrow slightly arched as she stares down the entire hall, as cool and unyielding as any Slytherin. Blaise shifts uncomfortably, and glances across at Snape. The man glowers down at his food, stabbing his fork at his sausages and Blaise wonders how many arguments this “rule” caused during the night.
‘Yes,’ says Blaise patiently. ‘But that doesn’t necessarily mean you’re gay.’
Ginny tries valiantly not to laugh, truly, but she can’t help it. Giggles erupt and Harry shoves her.
He scrubs with a vengeance, fury still surging through his veins.
‘Uh, yes.’
‘And?’
‘I…no,’ says Draco, though he doesn’t at all sound sure. ‘He’s just so…I mean I can’t…I just…’
Greg makes a face. ‘He asked to borrow my inkwell.’
Poppy’s eyes widen. Before he has a chance to continue, she is flying across the room, flicking her wand at the nearest bed to send blankets and bandages and potions whizzing around the room in a flurry of action. She doesn't ask how bad the injury is. She doesn't need to. Albus would not come for anything less than near-death.
retired.’
He glances at Ginny, who raises her eyebrows, widening her eyes slightly.
and I’ll never get to see my son again! Now stop blathering and fucking
Harry snorts.
The ride through the gardens had been their Christmas tradition for years, ever since Draco had first laid eyes on an Abraxian horse and begged them to get one. He adored them, and was always the first to line up at the door after lunch, ready to go and see them.
Any excitement over the prospect of getting to know the exotic plants is quashed by despair. Whatever was going on just now had obviously been
Where
Blaise catches Greg’s eye and tilts his head toward Draco. He doesn’t bother trying to get Vince’s attention (or Theo’s, who aside from being engrossed in an essay, hasn’t even looked at Draco since The Fight).
A momentary pause, and Malfoy looks caught, like he’s not sure how to respond. ‘I despise you Potter, everybody knows that.’
It takes Neville a moment to realise what it is, but when he does he wonders that he didn’t see it earlier. There’s no hostility. They’re arguing, yes, but it’s almost like they’re having fun. There’s a faint smile tugging at Harry’s lips, and a gleam in Malfoy’s eyes, like they’re playing some strange game trying to see who can out-insult the other. Yet none of the insults are serious. They don’t mean them. Even Malfoy’s voice isn’t as barbed or cutting as it used to be.
Theo has Potter at wand point, and yet there are three other people in the room who could disarm Theo and protect Potter. And they would, too. Theo can see that. Oh, not before Theo hexed him, but really, how much damage could Theo do with one spell? Even he’s not sure of his own conviction.
Malfoy doesn’t say anything, just rolls his sleeve back down.
Potter, who has his chin propped in his hand, sighs and breaks away from his intent study of Hogwarts grounds to turn and poke Malfoy in the ribs. Malfoy jerks, his head snapping up and around to glare at Potter. Potter tilts his head and nods toward the front of the room where Professor Burbage is still waiting for a response. Lisa resists the urge to snort. Subtle.
The girl cuts off as Hermione passes, giving Hermione a rather sour look and pointedly slipping inside and closing the door. Hermione raises her eyebrows, glancing back over her shoulder at them and wondering what exactly that was about.
‘Secrets?’ Hermione frowns, glancing back and forth between
‘Oh?’ asks Harry, and his voice sounds sort of funny.
Poppy sighs and glances back at her file. How was she supposed to answer that question? She wants to tell Minerva what’s on her mind. After all, Minerva is not only a respected colleague, but her friend. They’ve worked together over twenty years, and there is no one else whose opinion Poppy valued more (not to mention the fact that—being Potter’s head of house—there was no one better suited to give Poppy input on Potter). And yet, patient confidentiality prevented her from discussing anything regarding Potter’s situation with anyone except the Headmaster—and quite frankly, with the state of Albus’ own health, Poppy doesn’t see him as a viable option. She resists the urge to sigh.
Hermione rolls her eyes. ‘Alright, fine.’
'Smith,' says Hermione, her voice calm and deadly even. 'How long have you been eavesdropping?'
‘I…er, we’ll try our best,’ says Harry weakly but Myrtle gives him a hard look, shooting forward to get right up in his face (she only wishes she could get in his face like
Potter blinks and glances over his shoulder, only just seeming to realise where they are. Several students scramble for their books, though they all keep one eye on the two of them at the front of the room. She ignores them and raises an eyebrow at Potter, motioning toward his empty seat. He doesn’t move. His jaw has that familiar set to it and Minerva feels a headache coming on. She close her eyes and sink into her chair. Instead, she takes a deep breathe and tries a different tact.
Colin shakes his head. ‘Oh, no. No you don’t look like an idiot.’ He laughs and says, ‘Actually, I got kind of nervous when I saw it. I thought Malfoy might get angry. I can’t believe he paid me for it.’
Harry shrugs sheepishly. ‘I mean sort of. For me. Not all of us can have giant mansions you know.’
Zabini passes her as she kicks for the surface, and a pinprick of relief assuages her guilt. Gasping at the air, she sees another hand reaching out.
Rumbling footsteps shake the ground. ‘Everythin’ alrigh’?’ asks the Giant One, rushing over to them.
at Ron.
‘We’re not,’ she says. ‘Not really. But you forget, I’ve spent a decent chunk of the last year basically stalking him.’
!’ Ron shouts.
Professor Slughorn comes bustling over to their table. ‘Now, now Mr Malfoy, whilst a regrettable outcome, it’s not worth such language,’ he says, pulling out his wand and giving it a swift flick.
‘Draco,’ Harry sighs, and his gaze flashes to Molly.
Harry glances up at her, his eyes wide, a flash of fear crossing his face that is more apparent without his glasses to shield his face. The air thickens, and Hermione shivers, the hairs on her arms standing on end as static fills the air.
Footsteps race along after her, Malfoy—being taller and longer legged—easily catches her.
