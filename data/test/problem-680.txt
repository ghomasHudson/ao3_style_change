“That’s exactly what I’m saying, because I don’t do shoddy work,” Malfoy replied, his tone straight and light “but I’m sure Healer Murphy will be happy to provide you with a number of those.” He added matter-of-factly. Dana snorted behind her hand, unable to keep it straight hearing Malfoy’s unsubtle jabs.
Before he had time to consider the possibilities and wonder how it would feel to spend long afternoons playing chess with Malfoy, if it would feel the same as when he did it with Ron over winter break…
Griffith nodded but he didn't seem at all convinced. Draco was glad they didn't lose the girl; it would have been a much different conversation to have.
“But that didn’t fit with your perfect, could-do-no-wrong image and the news spun it differently,” Malfoy concluded. Harry nodded.
“Harry, dear, thank the heavens you’re ok.” Molly’s round face greeted him from the door. “Ron told me about the accident, but I had to see you for myself,” She hurried in, followed by Malfoy at a more sedate pace and a tall desi woman sporting his same robes. Another healer then. He immediately relaxed having people around meant he could avoid going crazy for a little bit.
He repeated the experiment on the other side, a little higher, near the crease of Harry's hip, eliciting a desperate little whine from Harry as he soothed the sting with his tongue.
"Just Draco is fine, Miss Rana," he mentioned. "Have you met the rest of the medical team?" He rested his chin on his left hand, hoping she would have gleaned some better insight than the sterile curricula Granger had passed onto him before departure.
“No, that’s just what my father used to bring her all the time,” he replied. “Nice try but you need to be more critical about the information you extract, especially if you make deductions based on circumstantial evidence. Better luck next time.”
“No need to thank me, my young friend. I'm always happy to help hard working healers, even english ones.”
“I didn’t” Malfoy replied, and from the finality in his tone, Harry knew he wasn’t going to get anything more about it even if he asked.
“He’s safest in my hands. I know you don’t like it but handing him over to another Healer is just as dangerous as keeping him here, if not more. His treatment is a constant balancing act and his reactions tend to be erratic.”
“The first step is to spot the intruder, which was hardly a chore since you move with the grace of a gryphon” Malfoy started explaining. His voice was so calm and even, the warmth and approval so overwhelming Harry barely noticed the jab at his delicacy.
"Give me a minute to change." He shrugged off his robes and picked a light white linen shirt and sand-coloured trousers. Formal enough but non-threatening.
"I asked for a special furlough for you, so you can come visit them with me." He told her eventually. There weren't many chances for his mother to leave the manor and he wished he could accompany her back into the world on a more joyous occasion, but those were their circumstances.
He supposed the man was owed a day off at some point, but it was disruptive to his routine. Wasn’t routine something people in recovery needed?
He waited until they were wrapped in fluffy bathrobes walking down a quiet corridor with walls decorated with stunningly intricate geometric mosaics before asking the question.
Keeping track of seasons while frequently changing hemispheres was a fine art that Draco had yet to perfect. Having to date his letters to Pansy and Blaise helped with keeping track of the calendar when they moved from the hot Hawaiian summer to the cold of the Falklands to dig up old cursed artefacts from the war that were starting to reactivate for unknown and ultimately, at least as far as Draco and his colleagues were concerned, irrelevant reasons.
In front of that irrefutable fact, Hermione backed down. They were all aware of what it meant, but it was Harry that felt the days tick by, each of them a step closer to death. It was like walking into the Forbidden Forest again, only this time it wasn't some grand sacrifice, it was just pointless, an empty void growing bigger and bigger behind his breastbone with each sunrise and sunset until there would be no more.
"We can't just do nothing, Malfoy," Harry insisted, frustration clawing at his throat. "You need to try."
"Quite a bit, how about you?" His tone was calm but Harry could read the provocation behind the words, the snake behind the flower.
my fault, but unlike someone else, I can tell the difference between what is and isn’t. This one isn’t, although some say it was just what I deserved.”
Malfoy nodded and gestured for her to follow him through the camp. He moved with ease and confidence among the tents, the loose clothes moving with the desert wind.
He spent a lot of time sitting near the edge of the village, staring down at the path out the jungle, waiting for the man to finally show up. Vaisakhi came and went and Malfoy sat next to him as the sun went down after another hot day, the air around him cooling and the sounds of the jungle changing from the light song of the day to the quieter whisper of the night.
“Why are you lying to him, Draco?” He asked patiently, preparing to argue Draco into settling down. Draco used to say he lawyered his anxiety away, used to tease him for how easily he slipped into cross interrogation techniques.
On Sunday afternoon, with the workweek looming over them, Harry decided to go over and check out the progress on Grimmauld Place. Hermione hadn’t been very generous with details, just that the house was still volatile, and there was no clear way to settle it.
"How about skipping the restaurant and taking a walk around the city?" he asked Malfoy as soon as Hermione disappeared with the nice professor.
"How long until she gets suspicious about us being incommunicado, do you reckon?" Malfoy asked casually.
“It was really no trouble. Anything you need to get Harry back into fighting shape as soon as possible.” He smiled, holding out a hand to shake.
"It's yours, Harry. If you want it." He took out the papers and Summoned a quill. "I got it for you, you can sign the papers now and have it."
"Any chance you've got food in that backpack of yours?" he asked, pushing his hair back from his forehead, matted with sweat.
“Good evening, master Zabini, Master Malfoy is waiting in the living room,” the elf informed him, taking his bag.
With this chapter we should be past the worst of the pain (as far as I've planned which isn't far at all). On that note I feel like it's fair to put a TW for panic attacks. It's not really graphic or intense but I feel like it's better to be safe than sorry. Also there's children being harmed and women dying. If you need details check the end notes.
“You already know.” Harry was about to argue that no, he didn’t, but then it clicked, Ron’s voice resonating in his head.
"I don't know, Potter, travelling through mirrors is incredibly dangerous, there is a reason we use fire instead." Malfoy sounded terribly reasonable, but Harry had thought about that too.
He stopped when he saw a figure in front of Potter’s door, looking around in the least subtle way one could imagine.
He didn’t turn around when Draco joined him on the balcony and hesitantly placed a hand over Harry’s on the balustrade.
“For starters, you’re not going out yourself, with or without me.” By now Harry knew to recognize a deflection.
She left after making tea and feeding him some more around six, telling him she had to start making dinner, Fleur was coming over with the children.
Draco glanced at the envelope and then at her, as he figured out where she most probably was aiming. He schooled his face in a carefully crafted neutral expression and tried desperately not to get his hopes up, it seemed too good to be true.
“Get the dragonhide ones.” He called after her. She emerged victorious a few minutes after Soup went in to assist her, holding a pair of skin tight dragonhide trousers she and Blaise had gotten him on some kind of occasion he couldn’t quite remember.
"But we can start, right?" Potter's earnest look couldn't get more than a shrug out of Draco, as much as he wanted to give him the answer he wanted.
“No, I’m sorry, disregard my face. I want you to go and do what you need to do for yourself. We’ll figure everything else out when you get back.” Harry nodded. “And until then I’m going to make peace with Soup.”
“Good, we’re on the same page,” Draco gave him a tight smile and gestured for him to follow. He found a mostly empty corridor and discreetly threw up some privacy charms around them.
With the girl's condition stabilising as Draco finished reconstructing the second lobe, he asked for an update on their work during the day.
“To ‘Mione,” Ron corrected him. “I just happened to be the one with the means to actually do something about it, so I did.”
“No, you’re not a guest of theirs or you wouldn’t have lied to me in the first place,” Draco cut him off again. This one was too easy, he hadn’t even had to try and the man was ready to wet his pants. Draco squared his shoulders and took a purposeful step towards him.
“Mate, he was visiting the grave of the woman he almost married, what do you think?” Ron replied looking up at him with wide eyes. “It wasn’t a jolly walk in the park, but it was… you know, composed,” he shrugged.
“He rarely is, but it’s only for a while. Weasley says he’s getting close, once Potter’s out of danger I’ll go back to what I was doing before.”
"I'm going to miss your conversation," he told her, looking down at the half glass of champagne he was holding. This was it, closing another successful mission, leaving the new friends behind to move on to the next disaster zone.
Healer Dana came to check in on him after lunch, testing his mobility and asking him about pain level, tightness in the healed area and seemed satisfied with the results. Teddy watched over the process like a hawk, showering the woman with questions. She indulged him good naturedly and asked him if he wanted to become a healer when he finished Hogwarts. Teddy shook his head at that question
Granger stood out in her cream anarkali suit, the golden details drawing out the amber hues of her skin. As he scanned the room, he spotted Miss Rana, once again in green, with silver brooches pinned to her hijab and her jacket, and Healer Gupta, standing tall among a group of strangers, with her hair gathered in a relaxed updo instead of her usual stern plait. And then his eyes fell on Potter, looking delectable in a black ensemble with gold detail, doing his best not to engage in any inane conversation no doubt going on in the room.
Half of the bottle in they were both on the couch, the coffee table covered in parchment, Blaise’s shirt unbuttoned more than was appropriate in any kind of professional setting while Draco almost dozed with his head on his shoulder, he’d never been very good at handling alcohol.
Harry watched him slowly up the difficulty of the positions, lean muscles flexing as he shifted the weight of his body, flowing seamlessly from one asana to the next. The precision and economy of movement and breath were exactly how he remembered them when they duelled back in school; with a wand or a broom Malfoy had always been lethal and precise. Harry idly wondered when and how did he start practising yoga. It didn't seem like something he would pick up from British high society, and yet the ease with which he moved indicated a seasoned practitioner. He was so distracted by his thoughts that Malfoy almost bumped into him on his way back to the hotel.
By nightfall, they were settling in a hotel room in Amritsar, the Golden Temple illuminated against the night sky out the window. It was nothing compared to their connecting suites in Mumbai, but as he watched Potter drop his clothes in a pile and head to the enclosed bathroom to shower, Draco knew they didn't need the wide berth, they'd learnt to breathe in sync and exist in the same space. He dropped his backpack at the foot of his bed, leaving the one closer to the window to Potter, and barely made it into his pyjamas and under the sheets before passing out.
“Alright, I’ll let you back to look for what you need, but you can’t tell anyone,” McReary cracked, opening the side door for him. Draco smiled brightly at him.
“Very funny, Potter, there are other less involved ways to form a bond.” Draco replied, picking up the chart to go over previous accident reports to see if he’d been exposed to any possibly triggering rituals “Like marriage.” He mentioned.
The plan to keep things professional backfired when he set his mind on attending Mrs Weasley birthday dinner at the Burrow. Malfoy, after expressing vehemently his displeasure and his firm medical advice that he reconsider, decided to tag along to
“What makes you think it doesn’t right now?” Malfoy countered, gently squeezing his arm to test the growth of muscle under the frail skin.
He flicked his wand and crossed off the line from the list with a deep sigh, rubbing a hand down his face. Just one left, the weight of his weariness hanging on his shoulders.
Harry kept staring Ron down in silence, he knew his stare wasn’t as good as Hermione’s, but Ron was weak to it.
Draco shook his head, "The best chance is a team that works efficiently, and that's not one with me at the head right now. If I were the one giving orders, every Brit in there would try to sabotage me, Griffith would spend his time doing damage control, and you would have one and a half Healers doing actual work in an already suboptimal environment. This way you have a perfectly decent leader and a team that follows directions."
A young man, Vikram, offered to guide them down the rocky path into the mountain, and with a touch of his finger he lit up the intricate drawings climbing up his arm, shining a warm light around them as they went deeper.
Draco grimaced at the gentle reprimand. He wasn't focused and he knew exactly why. "I'm sorry, Sāhiba."
"Can't he have graduated from open hostility to the much more mature position of pretending I don't exist at all?"
He didn’t have to go very far, he ran into Ron and Malfoy almost immediately, both in uniform and looking grim. Despite the context, a spark of excitement ignited deep in his chest, it looked like there was news on the case.
“Potter is right here, you know?” Harry mentioned, trying to cut the tension, waving his good hand a little.
Once they reached the conference room Pansy kissed both their cheeks and wished them good luck, after that she was gone, headed to her studio to prepare for the fashion week.
“What’s wrong?” Harry asked, the pinched expression on Malfoy’s face couldn’t mean anything good “Aside from the obvious” he added, looking down at the pristine white bandages on his arm and the patch on his chest.
"Harry was telling me about how you played against each other a lot in school." Teddy mentioned, interrupting his inspection of Draco’s robes "Said he always won." He added with a wide innocent grin that fooled exactly nobody.
"You will love living in Kolkata, Hari, I still miss it," Aunty Priya said, nostalgia tinging her eyes.
Harry nodded. “Alright,” he agreed. “Why did you pick those memories?” Harry asked, picking up his wand again, twirling it between his fingers.
“Shut up, I’m smooth enough,” Draco argued, drawing a quick arc with his wand and letting his shirt fall open and go fold itself on the bench at the foot of the bed.
His mood only got better when Healer Dana came to check in on him and confirmed that his chest looked good and in a few days they’d probably be able to start reconstructing his arm. The only discordant note in an otherwise perfectly harmonious morning was the lack of Malfoy’s scathing sarcasm injecting adrenaline in his day.
"You'll have to get a lot better at charms, Griffith, and not get lazy with the fancy equipment you have in London," Draco teased him gently.
“It’s ok, we can make up for it today.” Teddy reassured him with a determined look on his face that only made Harry smile brighter as Andromeda set up for tea on the rolling tray.
First of all let me indulge and acknowledge myself. I wrote a fucking novel in less than a year, starting with no plan and ending with a highly emotional story that broke 100k words. I’m a fucking badass. You're welcome.
The showers had the same gorgeous tile design of the hall, and the different shades of blue here created an illusion of flowing water even before Harry turned the tap on and the perfect pressure of water started washing away the mud.
He checked himself out in the mirror, the dark trousers and light sherwani, his hair perfectly styled, if maybe growing a little long. He idly thought that Blaise would approve of him finally attending a reception with foreign dignitaries and high officials, just like he'd wanted for the two of them. Too bad he wasn't there to see it.
Harry shrugged, usually he spent those functions being introduced to just unending rivers of people he promptly forgot the following day, it didn’t surprise him that he’d failed to notice Zabini and his wife. He was about to ask about Malfoy but Healer Dana stopped by to whisk Seamus away, leaving Harry to his own thoughts.
He got up and strengthened the spell until a muffled voice came from the other side of the collapsed wall.
"Healer Andrews, esteemed members of the committee," he acknowledged each of them with a nod "shall we proceed? I'm sure you have much more pressing matters to attend to." He gave an imperceptible tilt of his head, subtly taking control of the room by inviting them to start the proceedings.
Harry choked on his spit for a moment at the casual offhanded way the man talked about it. “I… ah… what? Maybe?” He managed, pointedly avoiding looking Zabini in the face. He wasn’t sure how he felt about Draco talking about that with his friends.
Of course it was all about how Potter got heroically injured during an extremely daring Auror operation. Words like
Malfoy looked at him half-confused and half-amused by his admission, his eyebrows were furrowed but a smile crinkled the corners of his eyes. “That’s very considerate of you, Potter,” he commented, packing up the chessboard.
“Forgive me, Healer Malfoy, but the trainees are needed for a seminar with Healer Andrews.” She informed them. Malfoy turned around when he heard his name, nodding at her.
“Potter lies!” Draco snapped. “You know it, I know it. Do you think you can find another Healer with the specific competence and willingness to call out the Saviour of the Fucking World on his bullshit? Someone who’s going to put his recovery ahead of his momentary happiness or that wouldn’t be tempted to just try to make him like them? Because I’m not convinced there’s an abundance of those in London.” He stopped and sighed, looking Weasley in the eyes, feeling his heart beating fast in his chest, the silence stretching between them for a long second. “I won’t let any harm come to him, I’ll brew his potions myself if need be,” Draco insisted. He needed Weasley to understand that moving Harry was a step in the wrong direction, that he would keep him safe no matter the cost. The fight seemed to leave Weasley’s shoulders, but he still argued, trying to poke holes in his plan.
“I didn’t know you have a child,” Harry commented once he got his bearings, the longing fading as he settled back into his body. He felt too light, his arms limp without the weight of Astoria between them.
“Since when do you hate putting up a performance?” Blaise asked, twisting Draco’s hair around his fingers, the smallest hint of teasing in his voice as he looked down at him.
lying to you, had been since almost the beginning. I should be the one to apologize to you. For manipulating you and gaslighting you and bringing your own best friend into it. I deliberately hurt you, twisting the knife in your guilt to make you back off when you got to close to the truth. And as much as I might want to I can’t apologize for that, because I’m not really sorry. It kept you and everyone else safe, I can’t be sorry for that. But hurting you in the process…” Draco swallowed hard, trying to fight the lump in his throat. “You know I have many things to regret, and this doesn’t even come close to a satisfactory apology, but know that what I did, hurting you, is coming close to the top of my list. Despite what many may think, I took no pleasure in hurting you like that.” Draco’s eyes were shining with the steadfast honesty of his admission, and Harry wanted to believe him so badly.
Malfoy turned his arm so Harry could see. Above and below the mark sat two rolls of parchment reading “
"That's not the point, Hermione." Harry gave up on his idea of storming out and taking a walk around the city until he was a bit calmer. He walked deeper inside Hermione's suite and sat down on the rattan couch, sinking in the soft cushion. "You took a Malfoy on a decolonisation diplomatic mission. How is this not absurd to you?"
“That’s cool, I didn’t know you could do that. I knew about magical tattoos, animated like paintings, but nothing like this,” he commented.
"He's shameless, Hermione. Coming to dinner showing off his Dark Mark. It's like he's trying to derail the entire mission before it even starts." He slammed back the Firewhisky.
Teddy was probably the most delighted by the new development, he got to hang with both his favourite people at once all summer long. Him declaring that sparked a heated debate over who was the
It was embarrassing to be reprimanded like a first year trainee but Draco supposed he deserved it for letting Potter's wide shoulders distract him to the point of injury. He should have known better than to let a pair of flexing biceps pull his focus.
He wasn’t entirely sure how he came to that decision, but as soon as they said their goodbyes and walked out, Harry apparated them to Godric’s Hollow. It was another year that he was growing older than his parents ever got to be, another year closer to surpassing Sirius too, he couldn’t just not come visit them. And after the world-shifting realization, he just needed to see his parents. Malfoy stopped complaining about the dangers of Apparating when they reached the cemetery, and Harry was grateful for the gentle pressure of a hand around his arm as they stood silently in front of the grave. He never could find the right words when the anniversary came, and for once Malfoy didn’t feel the need to fill the silence. It felt like he understood what the moment was about, and a part of Harry wished he didn’t when he knew what the price of that understanding was.
“Wait, Draco,” Harry reached out for him. “I slept almost 24 straight hours, I’d like to talk for a while. Will you stay?” he asked, his fingers brushing against the back of Draco’s hand where he stood next to the bed.
Draco ran a hand through his hair taking a slow breath. “I’m telling you transferring him suddenly apropos nothing just after they get a little exposed is going to raise concerns. We have to assume they know nothing so far; I’ve been very careful with him and he’s getting better at Occlumency. Besides they wouldn’t want to kill him in the hospital and show their hand. They probably don’t want to kill him at all if they think they can use him for information on the case,” he tried to reason.
She sighed and stepped aside to let him in. "I knew you'd react this way, that's why I didn't tell you."
role in this mission is to actually work instead of lending my name and face to leverage governments and having the tourist experience of Calcutta.”
He had to take a moment to really take the view in. Harry naked, spread out like a buffet on his bed, looking delectable against the silk sheets, just begging to be ravaged with that smile on his face that made Draco weak at the knees.
Draco stared at him for a long moment stunned and then shook his head. “I can’t accept that apology,” he murmured.
Draco flicked the corner of the envelope with a finger and took a few paces towards the bed, then stopped, running his fingers along the edge of the paper.
Harry immediately asked about the population and how they were doing, insisting he check on the people affected by the curse. It took some forceful negotiation to convince him that the progression of the curse had stopped and that he wasn't going to get near anyone or anything if not some food and a bed after being cursed and locked in a cave for a day and a half.
Hermione thanked the man when he placed two tall glasses in front of them dripping with condensation.
They chatted about the fallout from the last mission, how the department was scrambling to do damage control and how the press was running wild as usual.
The spot of carpet between the couch and the coffee table in Ron’s living room had probably taken the shape of Harry’s behind with the time he spent sitting there while Rose played with his hair, his face and now, his nails. Harry held his hands out, fingers separated as he rested them on the coffee table so Rose could paint them purple. She’d decreed he needed to look extra fancy for his birthday, hence the beauty treatment.
“You pulled me a little too close and I stepped away before you showed more than you meant for me to see,” he replied, eventually relaxing his death grip on his wand.
The committee was already gathered, sitting behind the long table. Andrews, head of the committee and chief of the poison ward, in the middle and then two on each side. The lack of seats for him and Blaise could only be on purpose, forcing them to stand under judgment like postulants. Well, if he couldn't sit he was going to stand tall and loom over them all, they did put themselves in the perfect position to be looked down on. He stood a pace away from the desk, with his hands clasped behind his back, he took a moment to settle and then spoke.
Then, he joined Harry in the kitchen and casually told him to lose all his clothes and meet him in the living room. Setting the leather armchair just right to catch the light of the bay window didn’t take more than a minute and he suspected Harry might have vanished all his clothes with how fast he came to meet him.
Draco woke up before his alarm had a chance to go off, the weight of the day crashing on him the moment he opened his eyes. He took a slow breath, letting the air out from his mouth and steeled himself against the day ahead. He stood in front of the bathroom mirror, straightened his back and squared his shoulders before opening the cabinet to take out the razor.
"He was like a dog with a bone when we got here but I haven't heard a single word of complaint from him for weeks."
Draco's deathday comes and goes, Harry believes he's dead and grieves him. The fic is NOT tagged MCD for a reason.
" Malfoy replied. "And in case you haven't noticed, I'm not really in the position to do much about it."
Harry felt it as soon as they emerged back into florid vegetation. Something was wrong. It was in the eerie silence of the jungle, the stillness of it when it should be crawling with life. His worst hunch was confirmed as soon as they breached the wards to find what looked like a ghost town. The stench of Dark Magic was heavy in the air and while Harry's step faltered, Malfoy had already dropped his backpack and got his wand out to scout the first few buildings.
“Soup wasn’t as fond of old Master Malfoy as he is of his son.” The elf replied with a small melancholic smile before walking out, leaving worlds unsaid with that single sentence.
Harry ran his fingers through his hair. "This is the business you had in Amritsar?" Harry asked Draco.
Harry tried to argue that it wasn’t true, but deep down he did feel purposeless, a prop for Hermione’s political game. Either way, Malfoy wasn’t done and a hissed word from him was enough to shut Harry up.
“Never thought he’d actually come around to doing that, but he has real crap timing, as usual,” she commented.
and soon there were a few Hindi words being thrown around, mixed with heavily accented English that warmed Harry more than the rhythmic muscle movement of rolling out roti after roti. As soon as he flipped one towards the cooking station another small ball of dough was rolled in front of him as he heard about gossip, history, religion and the proper rolling technique, all mixing together in one gentle caress of round Bengali vowels softening the harshness of the English language.
"I do." Draco propped his elbow up on the table and leaned his chin on his hand, studying the young man in front of him while a waitress quickly cleared the empty plates. Judging by his age, he must have been one of the first to start Hogwarts after reconstructions. This man, with his round face and curly hair, had only had a brush with the war, too young to entirely understand what was going on if he was lucky.
“I suppose it could work.” Bonhomme conceded “but it’s unpredictable. A four handed draw from the magical core with the healer as conduit would be safest.” He argued.
Harry's sense of loneliness and isolation gets exponentially worse throught the journey, he disconnects from his family back in England and breaks down in the arms of strangers. There is a vague mention of unwanted avances, blink and you miss it.
had become a parody of itself. Potter was barely out of danger and his image was already being used for some screwed up fetishistic hero fantasy to titillate the morbid curiosity of the masses. While the mediwixen doing actual outstanding work were discounted as extras in the production that was Harry Potter’s life.
He got to the hospital with a clear plan and he got there early for his shift, early enough to get his plan derailed by Brown coming to him begging for help with an issue with the Potions lab. Apparently, there wasn’t enough stock of what her supervisor needed for the day’s procedures and she didn’t know how to fix it.
Harry's eyes fell to his left arm when he moved to bring it to his chest. His shirt looked feather-light, white against skin that used to be milk white. Just like his face, the forearms, bared where the sleeved had been rolled up to his elbows, were tanned, and a careful look could spot freckles in the most unexpected places. Still, it didn't take much attention to see the curves of the Dark Mark wrapping around his left forearm, shamelessly on display.
"Yeah, well, I know what it means, I'm not going to forget that easily," he muttered, swishing his second glass around, letting the ice clink against the crystal. He couldn't get more than this, not while in charge of Hermione's protection, so he was going to make it last. As nice and aged as the liquor was it couldn't burn hotter than the bitter anger clinging to his throat when he thought about Malfoy showing off in front of Healer Gupta, being entertaining and dialling up the charm as if he wasn't sporting the symbol of a British blood supremacist right there on his arm.
“Oh, that got you interested, uh?” Seamus teased him. “No, Zabini’s married to Daphne Greengrass” he told him “Come on, they’ve been to several ministry functions, you’ve seen them together.”
"I promised," Draco murmured, an aching tenderness filled his voice, as if it was the one thing he'd most wanted to do in the world.
who came through for me once again. Jay, you were the best gift this Christmas, the discord squad knows just how serious I am when I say it.
"It's a last-ditch protection. I got the tattoo done in Abu Simbel, on one of my first tours in Egypt. The woman who did it is a specialist, the ink is imbued with phoenix tears, reacts to curses and poison."
“What was it he did last time?” At this point, Blaise was just having fun at Draco’s expense, giving him a moment of breath, a distraction.
“Ah, yes, that was why you missed the girls’ early Halloween party, you were busy at a birthday,” Blaise hummed.
“Potter, this is going to be very hard for you if you don’t stop presuming you already know,” Malfoy replied placidly, slowly loosening the straps of his holster and letting it slide off to reveal the faded mark underneath it.
“I’m about to get you naked, I have every right to be smug,” Harry argued, swinging his feet a little.
“I know, chéri, but you did it anyway. I’m proud of you,” he murmured, watching how easily Harry leaned into his touch, his eyes fluttering closed as he soaked up the approval.
Draco smiled at the sharp lines of Blaise’s signature at the bottom of the paper, he would get him anything he wanted if he could get the board off his back and keep this thing from leaking to the press.
“I’m sure we’ll get on great, mr Potter. We’ll leave you to your lunch.” She nodded at Molly. “Mrs Weasley,” She added before turning to leave with Malfoy. They walked shoulder to shoulder, his head tilting a little to listen to her speak, with an intimacy that twisted Harry’s guts in a way he didn’t want to look at too closely.
The few people he talked to during the tour confirmed it was a great working environment, the synergy among the departments was great, and there seemed to be a million trials running at the same time. The publications alone were incredible.
“No.” It was a simple statement, and still, Malfoy wouldn’t meet his eyes, as if it was just ordinary small talk.
"Anything's possible, there was a lot of volatile magic in the air at the time. Mine, his, Murphy's, Orion's…" he shrugged. "By the end, the wards were supercharged with a mix of all our magic and they warped to revive Harry. At this point, I have learned that making prognoses about him is an exercise in futility, so we'll take it one day at a time and see what happens."
“You’re dressed scary, I like it.” He announced looking at Malfoy’s clothes “Your robes are super cool.” He ran a hand down the lapel, studying it with furrowed brows. That did the trick and kicked Harry’s brain back online. Just as Malfoy said something about introducing Teddy to the designer he called
He shook his head with a sigh and dropped his eyes, coming back to earth. He caught Malfoy watching him with a quiet intensity and averted his eyes, as if afraid the man could read those thoughts if he let him look into his eyes too long. He didn't think too hard about Malfoy suddenly going quiet after refusing to shut up for a single second the entire way there.
Harry felt the same cold rage and boiling revulsion he'd discovered upon finding the horrid Muggle trials setup at the Ministry, ten years prior. Some things never did change apparently, and as horrified as everyone acted with Voldemort's rise and fall and second coming, it was just more of the same. Healer Gupta spoke of it calmly and with detachment, almost used to the horrors of the irreparable loss of generations-worth of knowledge and practices.
With that knowledge heavy in his chest, he worked every day, breathing life in his patients, soothing wounds, unravelling curse damage, cleansing poisons. Each day it got hotter and more humid, to the point where he had to teach Griffith how to weave a Weather-Control Charm into his Personal Protection Charms so they wouldn't drip sweat on whoever they were operating on. He sorely missed the desert on those days.
He padded out of the bathroom and picked a pair of clean briefs before looking at the clothes options he had. He went for some light wash jeans and a slate grey linen kurta. He didn't bother to do up the buttons all the way; they weren't going anywhere formal anyway.
"And how long will I be enjoying your company?" She asked, unable to hide the happiness at the prospect of having more of Draco's company, no matter the circumstances.
He was quiet as they crossed the road and made their way through the busy streets, still wet from the storm but just as busy as before it came sweeping through the city. Malfoy's silence didn't last long. They barely made it to the park limits before he asked again.
Draco shook his head. "I have to take you somewhere first." He wiped his face as discreetly as he could. It felt all wrong but if he didn't do it now, he would never get to it.
“Everything is fine, Potter.” Draco told him, trying to sound as comforting as he possibly could. He rearranged the tools on the tray and pushed it aside. “There were developments of my intervention on you that we didn’t account for,” he explained “but now we know and we’ll take care of it. We can fix your chest and then let you sleep.” He promised, hoping it would be enough to reassure him.
August was never easy for either of them. It was riddled with dark memories and grief. He knew he shouldn't leave her alone during it but it was hard watching her grieve his father or Aunt Bella when he had his own grief to squeeze the air out of his lungs and close his throat with the enormity of it. She reached out to take his hand, her fingers warm and strong on his skin.
"You don't owe me anything more than you've already given. I know you won't go backwards, Draco. That’s enough."
One of Draco’s hands wrapped around Harry’s, guiding him to stroke him at exactly the right speed. Harry turned to look at the way their fingers entwined around Draco’s cock. It didn’t escape him how Draco moaned at the scrape of Harry’s beard against his sensitive neck and he did it again to listen to that desperate little whine and feel the twitch of his cock in his hand.
“Hey!” Harry argued, “That doesn’t count, I knew that already. I wanted to know something about you, prat,” he elaborated.
We got a nice and rocky start to this whole thing, no one is happy about the situation except me because I love suffering.
He immediately offered up his good arm. Draco closed his fingers around his wrist and gently pressed the tip of his wand to the crook of his elbow murmuring the incantation and letting blood pool there for a moment before pulling the wand away floating the blood after it and splitting it in three parts. He dropped each in a capsule and sealed them before turning back to Potter who was looking at his arm with a frown, gnawing on his bottom lip and trying to rub it against his side.
He threw the paper away after checking how his investments were doing. He poured himself another cup of coffee and savoured it slowly before getting into the eggs and toast.
Malfoy hummed; the tiniest twitch of his lips could almost be called a smile, "you said that already," he replied.
"We can't keep her under Stasis much longer, she's starting to show signs of sufferance." He pointed at an indicator slowly turning purple from the red it was the previous day. "We should finish. Do you think you can keep going for a few more hours?" he asked.
They went back and forth for a while, pulling up the research done in France on the procedure and all the precedents Blaise could pull up at a moment’s notice, formulating a strategy.
“I can’t treat him while he’s this open to external influence, messing with volatile potions,” Malfoy argued. He set the notepad aside and crossed his arms, his back straight and his chin raised. There was an entirely different energy to their confrontation now. Malfoy wasn't going to be moved by any insistence coming from Ron, not when it came to putting any patient in danger, not when it came to putting
“It wasn’t yours to buy and restore either, but you did. There must be something I can give you,” Harry couldn’t believe he had to argue about it.
“It doesn’t have to be a desk job. You could be a trainer, you’re a decent duelist and it’s not like you lack experience. That way it wouldn’t matter if your own casting is not consistent you could still teach the recruits. Or you could dedicate your time to those outreach programmes… well, that would defeat the purpose of lessening your public exposure, but it would make you feel actively involved,” Draco reasoned.
Draco wasn't sure how much help he could be in either department, so he followed Healer Gupta's lead in the hopes of at least learning some new techniques to employ. He kept an eye on Granger, discussing a plan with Professor Chambers to leverage whatever influence she might have for some more resources to try and avoid the incident repeating itself.
“I don’t care, I want to take the organization down,” Harry insisted stubbornly, staring Malfoy down.
After the late-night conversation with Griffith, getting a bit of common ground and none of the hostility he expected, not even Potter's scowl could put a dampener on his mood. He didn't have to ignore him for too long either. Like the previous day, as soon as they touched down on the small island in the middle of the river, Potter split off with Granger and Professor Chambers, leaving him with Griffith and Auror Foster to pick up the work where they left off.
“He’s probably right,” Draco agreed with a resigned sigh, smiling when Soup’s voice came in from the other room.
Harry looked at him, the question in his eyes, but he didn't ask when Draco led the way back out the graveyard and hailed a taxi. They crossed the city too fast for Harry to keep track of where they were going until they pulled up in front of a teahouse. A tall man with a long dark beard and purple turban appeared to be waiting outside for them, or more accurately for Draco, from the questioning look he gave Harry, he was clearly an unexpected development.
"You are incredible." Harry felt the shift of magic as he signed his name at the bottom of the page, how the house became brighter around him, and the air got sweeter, the carpet softer under his feet. "I will speak for you in England, you deserve the chance to go home too." He looked up at Draco with determination set in his eyes.
“Let’s just say you weren’t entirely off the mark arguing that my plan would trigger the Unbreakable,” Draco admitted. “It was a bit of a gamble and we got pretty close.”
"We'll be there in less than an hour, ma'am," the driver told her as they passed the Valley of Kings' crowded parking.
Malfoy's shoulders visibly relaxed as he gradually took down a section of the net and a few moments later the rubble parted like water, revealing Healer Gupta's smiling face and Vikram behind her. Both had their arms bared, big sections of their tattoos glowing red as they manipulated the rock around to make a secure passage.
Once the Thai delegation arrived, under a dark sky full to bursting with rain, their work on the island lightened. Thanks to Healer Gupta's invaluable work righting the crooked growth of magic in the population, Draco found he and Griffith had much fewer accidents to fix. The outbursts of accidental magic were fewer and less violent now that the population was more grounded and learning to channel their energy.
“He hasn’t.” Harry grumbled his mind going back to how stern and unyielding Malfoy was “But he can’t very well kill me, I’m his patient.” He pointed out.
"I had Pansy investigate the branches you couldn't track down," Draco started to explain, opening the papers and spreading them on the table between them. "See here?" He pointed at an empty space on the tree he'd drawn with Harry almost a year prior. "She managed to get access to the magical school records and fill in the gaps with a bit of bribery and her superior heraldic knowledge, enough to track down Mr Singh here."
“Since when do you care about appropriate?” There was something off about the way Malfoy was talking, paying only half attention to the conversation. It wasn’t right, but his mind was locked down tight and Harry couldn’t get anything from him.
“I want him to be safe, Blaise,” Draco sighed, the words spilling out of his lips in a rush, as if he might lose the resolve to say them out loud if he didn’t say them fast enough. “And I want justice for Kore.” He still said her name like a prayer, it wasn’t by mistake that he called her with the name of a goddess, arguably the most powerful of them all.
There were two tubs, close enough to each other that they could keep talking quietly even after getting in the mud bath. Hermione didn't waste time, shedding her robe immediately and climbing in the tub, slowly lowering herself in the mud. She giggled as her leg disappeared in the mud and Harry quickly followed, gingerly dipping his toe in.
“I know, it’s expected.” He replied with a wave of his hand, dismissing her concern. He flicked his wand crossing off point number ten from the list. “It was never meant to last long, that’s why we need to get through the battery of tests today. I need a clear diagnosis so I can employ a more permanent solution before the patch loses all its charge, so if you would kindly pick up the pace, mr. Bingley.” He looked at the other trainee with a raised eyebrow. The man fumbled with the tools on the tray for a moment before pointing his wand at the list and crossing off another line.
Disruption didn’t seem too bad when it was Teddy and Andromeda walking in around eleven, arms full of packages.
"I am. This is my pro bono for the year, another thing I couldn't really do while working for the bank."
Do you think you know where I'm taking this? I promise you don't but I love hearing theories and meta on my work, I'm narcissistic like that.
Malfoy and a blonde woman, that could have almost been his sister, were assisting a woman, laid out on the runway.
“Apparently in the last twelve months there were twenty-eight separate instances of you being exposed to potential magical degradation or contamination of some form.” Malfoy announced to the room, giving him specifically a stern look.
“Get naked.” The way Harry froze for a second with his lips parted made Draco’s grin turn predatory. “You
“I’m not an elf” He replied, deciding to dismiss Potter’s nonsense for a moment. “I see a solution and more problems” He told him “The residue has coagulated away from your chest wound, so I can fix that without putting you in danger.” He started, a tentative sense of accomplishment sitting in his gut, daring to light a flicker of hope inside him.
Draco huffed out a laugh, realising he'd just stared down the man with fully black, slightly demonic looking eyes.
“Of course, because who needs structure or discipline when you have the saviour of the wizarding world on the team?” Draco sighed, he should have expected some nonsense like that.
"Merlin, Potter, it's recently acquired, can you stop it? I'm not going to tour my slave camp, it's just a house for Salazar's sake, I thought we were past this!"
He decided not to linger too long on that or the fact that Ron was indisputably right in his assessment of the situation and asked Rose about her last few weeks of summer holidays.
After clueing Dana in on the state of the proceeding Draco decided that he couldn't spend the day alone, waiting for Blaise and Daphne to come knocking on his door to drag him out. With it being the middle of the week and August his options for company were kind of limited, but there was someone who was always available.
"What? Diana Damrau is exceedingly talented, and this is one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever written" Pansy argued, just a touch too quickly and too vehemently.
The boys turn twenty-eight and deal with it in distinctly different ways. A fairly harmless chapter this one.
“Better safe than sorry… Oh, hey mate, when did you wake up?” Ron asked when he finally noticed Harry wasn’t sleeping anymore.
Harry groaned and slammed his head back into the door, hard enough to startle Draco and make him momentarily worry about the integrity of the wood.
He eventually dragged himself out of the bath and shared a light dinner with Soup before turning in early. He mentioned Pansy would be coming around for breakfast and wasn’t surprised in the least to hear Soup mention having just acquired a jar Pansy’s favourite jam and cherries.
And yet, in a blink, the sky was filled with the bright colours of dawn, vibrant and warm as if the sky itself knew and was preparing for the second day of Holi.
His thoughts went to Teddy. How would he handle losing him after fourteen years? And Malfoy didn’t even get to meet his child.
"I've been suspended until the end of the investigation into my misconduct." He replied. "It's fine, Blaise has everything in hand and I get to spend some time with my mother." he pre-empted her comment.
“It only collapsed the building” Malfoy repeated. “That means… There was someone there.” His eyes widened as the pieces fell together, finally fitting in a way that made sense.
He leaned against the railing once they all loaded onto the boat and closed his eyes to enjoy the sweet wind on his face and the spray of salty water on his lips. For a moment, before they docked in Mumbai proper, Harry had no responsibilities, and he could fully enjoy the exhilaration of being back in his home country. It still wasn't Punjab, but maybe, between then and June, he could find a day or two to get off duty and fly out to Amritsar, see the Golden Temple, visit his family's graves…
And then Harry did the unthinkable. He turned, nuzzled his hand, kissed his palm, his ring, his wrist, his tattoo and then looked up at him with utter reverence in his eyes before kissing his mark. Draco couldn’t move, Harry’s lips were warm against his cold skin, like the tears rolling silently down his cheek as Harry branded him anew, granting him absolution he didn’t deserve, rewarding every risk Draco had taken with a love and devotion Draco could have never imagined he could feel again, marking him a new man.
for the beta, she came through for me even though she's pretty much in my same boat. Your work is very appreciated.
"You were looking a little too plain, Potter," Malfoy told him, rubbing his hand on his face, from his forehead down to his neck, to make sure he got him good.
Teddy and Andromeda ended up staying well into the afternoon, opening cards and packages until they got bored, then Harry pulled out the chessboard and Teddy was dead set on beating Harry at least once before leaving. He’d improved a lot, probably thanks to his time spent at the Ron and Hermione’s, Ron had always been a much better player than him even back in school, there wasn’t much left he could teach Teddy about chess.
"Ouch, fuck!" Harry cursed, reaching up to rub the back of his head. He glanced up at Draco, and they stared at each other for a moment in silence with wide eyes, before they both started giggling, holding onto each other trying not to fall over.
landed in the foyer of the British embassy in Calcutta Harry was ready to take on the world. The warm fragrant air energised him, but it only took the time necessary for his balance to settle after such a long Portkey jump before the universe hit him in the face with a cricket bat. Malfoy was there, sitting on a low couch, dressed in flowy robes and clearly waiting for them. And that traitor Hermione was greeting him like an old friend. He knew he should have been more suspicious of her evasive answers about the international expert coming in to lead the medical team. He bit his tongue until Yuvarani, the young woman who would accompany them and coordinate with the locals, had shown them to their hotel and helped them settle in their rooms. Then, he marched right up to Hermione's and banged on the door until she opened.
“I know, I know it looks very bad and it was all my doing, so I need to fix what’s fixable before I get kicked out of the order.” He needed to do one thing right that could prop him up in front of the committee the next day.
“What am I missing?” He asked out loud, flopping down on the chair with a sigh. He stared at Potter as if he could parse the solution to the puzzle from his eyes. Potter just looked back at him, helpless, with no answers to offer except for a small shrug and a tentatively encouraging smile. With all the touted heroism he was just a man lying in a hospital bed, his life on the line, and Draco couldn’t do anything to fix him, he had one job to do and when it really counted he couldn’t even do that.
"There's a new assignment Hermione asked me to take on," he mentioned, slowly stirring his tea and eyeing the towering stack of perfectly square burfi. How Priya always got the edges perfect was beyond him, and she refused to divulge her secret. Harry's always came out sad and wonky.
“I didn’t say I didn’t like it,” Harry mentioned. Draco raised an eyebrow, wishing he could say exactly what he was thinking, but his mouth was occupied in way more pressing matters and Harry was still too coherent for a man with his cock in Draco’s mouth.
“Finnigan?” He vaguely remembered a Gryffindor in their year with a penchant for explosion, certainly couldn’t be the same one.
Zabini still swung by on day two of Draco’s trip, probably to check for corpses, and he stuck around for tea.
As they whizzed through the streets, he kept his eyes fixed outside the window, tuning out the excited chatter. Soon enough, after they left the docks, past the apartment blocks, past the stadium and a few parks, the skyline was taken over by skyscrapers and sleek glass and metal. The palm trees lining the wide roads and the peaks of domed spires he could glean here and there were enough to remind him he was as far from London as he could get.
It was oddly warm, and it took a moment for it to settle over Harry's body, dense and still, holding him up suspended in an earthy embrace.
“I just finished working on his wrist and gave him some pain reliever. You can go in if you want, the entertainment value is pretty high, but he’ll probably fall asleep soon,” he replied with a tight smile.
“That tends to happen when you win championships,” Harry replied with a proud smile. Ginny was crushing it and he couldn’t be happier for her. Malfoy nodded in amused agreement.
And he’d testified in his favour during the trials because it was the right thing to do, just like seeking him out to return his wand.
Harry knew that, before leaving for France, Draco had talked with Soup. Knives and murder were mentioned, which did not make Harry feel very confident at all. But after getting the shovel talk from the elf, and grovelling a little bit, things smoothed out considerably.
“Can I help you?” Draco asked politely. The man jumped and turned around, looking at him like a deer caught in headlights.
Malfoy’s hand moved quickly, spinning his wand in tight circles around his wrist, if he concentrated, he could feel his magic imbue his blood.
"Because Ambassador Granger decided it so; if you don't like it feel free to hike back to the city and take the complaint up with her, otherwise get to work." He looked at the gathered group of Healers, building experts, and assorted magical educators with a stern look. "Anyone else have any complaints that I should hear before we get a move on?"
She was still smiling when they exited the building, and Harry was honestly impressed with how she manoeuvred the department head, how she manoeuvred him and Harry’s anger to pressure the man into granting all the resources they needed.
Hours slowly crawled by as he overanalised every interaction they had, the twitches of Malfoy’s eyebrows, the tension of his hands, the rings on his fingers, the thin line of his lips.
"Now chop chop, Soup made me clafoutis and you need to eat something too." This wasn't usually the hard part. He usually didn't have his stomach twisted into knots. Eating felt like a feat right then but following Pansy's energy was doable. Papageno helped. The trill of the glockenspiel infusing some artificial happiness into his dreary mood. Pansy chatted about her latest project while Draco forced himself to down some food. The honey tasted like ash on his tongue and not even the coffee brought him joy. He did catch on to the third repeat of the queen of the night aria and raised an eyebrow in question at Pansy.
"Before you accuse me of stealing your family house away from its last descendants, I tracked the owners down with the help of your cousin and bought it back." Draco preempted an accusation that hadn't even come to Harry's mind. "He helped me find local craftsmen and artisans to restore it. I hired Dean Thomas to find the original art but… well, it was recreated as close to the originals as possible."
“Just two to go while we wait for your blood to react.” Draco replied, picking up a jar of black powder and the potted plant.
It was the sloppiest grip Draco had ever seen and Scorpius looked seconds away from rolling upside down, but he had this big excited grin on his face that Draco couldn't resist. He crouched down and beckoned him closer.
“From you? Nothing besides collaboration in your treatment. What were you about to ask for?” Malfoy asked, leaning back against the chair and crossing his legs at the knee.
Draco chuckled carefully tilting Harry’s head back, keeping his hand between it and the door as he gently pressed his lips against Harry’s. He felt him melt into it, his hands sliding down Draco’s back, pulling his shirt out of his pants, and then Harry’s warm hands were on  Draco’s skin, intoxicating him like the sweet taste of Harry’s lips.
"You know, pushing me off the edge of a tall building is not that imaginative…" Malfoy mentioned as they walked across the Brigades grounds to reach the base of the column.
It was over way too quickly. Harry came embarrassingly fast; all it took was one long, slender finger sliding in his loose, relaxed hole to brush against his prostate, and it pushed him over the edge, coming with a strangled cry. Draco’s free hand immediately went to his dick to stroke him through it, gradually slowing down as he milked every last drop of pleasure from him, until Harry was left boneless and sated, sprawled on the bed.
“We’re going to heal your chest wound now.” He informed him just as Healer Dana walked through the door.
"Whatever poisoned them is still active, and even if I spent all day directly cleansing them one by one it would be like using a tissue to fix a breached dam. We need to find the root cause. Whatever happened in the caves needs to be fixed, and only then I'd be able to heal them."
Harry relented and rolled his sleeve up to the elbow, exposing the white tendrils extending from the point of impact.
"Maybe they were, maybe not, what matters is that I needed an experienced emergency Healer and he was highly motivated," Hermione replied diplomatically, closing the door behind him.
"Miss Rana, how nice to see you again," he greeted her as he took his seat. "Ambassador." He nodded at Granger.
Bonhomme didn’t take much longer to reply, letting Draco know he’d be happy to help out a young healer, asking what time would be most convenient for him and if he’d mind talking through mirrors instead of fireplaces, mentioning how the knees of an old man don’t suffer very well extended floo calls.
“Since he didn’t agree to play this game with me. Since I asked him to be honest, and he is, and he thinks I’m doing the same but I’m not. I’m serious Blaise, please, I feel like I’m fucking up and I’m bringing Weasley down with me.”
Harry spent most of his days listening to Hermione and Professor Chambers discuss the local history of magic with a group of ancient-looking wixen. He tried to keep up with the discussion, and the history of colonial oppression made him angry enough that for a while he forgot about Malfoy on the other end of the island playing hero. He knew that Malfoy was up to something. He didn't fall for his charm and the friendly mask he put on for everyone around. He had to have a motive to be around, unpaid. It didn't matter how many sideways glances Hermione threw at him; he was going to get to the bottom of it. It almost felt too easy when he caught him sneaking back into his room early in the morning two days in a row. He just needed to follow him next time and see where he went and who he talked to. He wasn't going to let the ferret screw up Hermione's mission. It was easy to Disillusion himself, cast a Notice-Me-Not as precaution and walk leisurely a few feet behind him, light as a Lethifold and unnoticed by everyone.
"We're shit out of luck," he announced, the coin slipping from his hand and rolling on the floor. The light ding reverberated in the empty room and he sighed, not bothering to get up and get it.
When the discussion shifted from massive tracking spells towards the technicalities of education reform, Harry started to struggle to keep up and stared at the massive map of India hanging on the wall behind the desk. Each new child coming into their power flared on it as a little flame, flickering on and then off as soon as someone took care to add them to the registry. Except… They all knew there were pockets untouched by that map, places where people burned themselves out with untrained magic without being anything more than a blip on the radar.
for the beta work, she's the real MVP, picking through grammar and syntax, forcing me to write things that make sense.
Suddenly the room wasn’t there anymore, only a shut door and a silvery dome behind it. He tried to reach for the door but it disappeared before his fingers could reach it, and in the next breath he was back in his own body in St Mungo’s.
Draco chuckled, wrapping his arms around Harry’s waist, pulling him closer until he could bump their noses together.
"One more way I failed you. I should have protected you better." Draco shook his head taking her hands and kneeling in front of her
“I assume you heard about Potter’s latest exploits?” Draco started. Blaise nodded slowly. “I’m the one who operated on him,” Draco tucked his feet under himself.
“You’re lucky you’re pretty, you stubborn arse,” he murmured, brushing Draco's hair back from hisface.
The way the consonants rounded on her tongue already sent Draco back into his body. He sat straighter and closed his eyes. She clapped once and the light ringing sound of a bell resonated. The vibration resonated in Draco's ribcage much deeper than such a soft sound had any right to. The second ring started resonating with Draco's core, the wash of magic on his skin was warm and comfortable as it settled in a grounding weight. It pulled at his core like a harp string until his breath followed.
Harry slid his fingers into Malfoy's hair, feeling the soft short strands at the nape of his neck, like velvet under his hand. Malfoy's fingers were digging into his sides, holding him close as he sucked on Harry's bottom lip.
“Fuck, Harry, you’re perfect,” he groaned, struggling not to just push all the way in that tight slick warmth. He let Harry set the pace at the start, giving him ample time to get used to the stretch, only moving when Harry gave him the go-ahead. When Draco pulled out and slowly thrust all the way back in, his hips flush with Harry’s ass, Harry gave a low moan that sent lightning down Draco’s spine. He bent down to place a kiss between Harry’s shoulder blades with a heated whisper of
"I'm sure they will." Harry decided not to distract her further and sat still, content to watch her scrunch her nose in concentration. She looked so much like Hermione in that moment, that same curl escaping her messy bun in the middle of her forehead, that same scrunched nose, and the tip of her tongue between her teeth as she got to his pinky finger. The smattering of freckles, though, showing up now in the middle of summer when the sun kissed her tawny complexion, were all Ron.
Next chapter should be up around the 15th of September if academic commitments and fandom fests allow, it's already partly written so I'm confident I'm going to make the deadline.
Objectively he was Harry’s type in a lot of ways, especially now that he was a grown accomplished man.
"It's your pet project you want me on, then?" Malfoy studied her for a long moment and Hermione did her best to withstand the scrutiny. His eyes were sharper than she remembered but there was nothing she was trying to hide. In the end, he seemed to find what he saw satisfying, because he relaxed a little and took a sip from his glass and sighed, "I'll bite, you've got ten minutes before I have to go back in to finish the decontamination. What is it?"
"So it can be truly seen only by someone familiar with death." Draco commented, looking at it with a new understanding.
Draco hummed. “If I didn’t know any better I’d say you were hungover,” he commented with a shake of his head.
"You promised me anything I needed," he started softly, walking towards Draco and stopping under the dome.
Taking stock of what was missing wasn’t hard and each empty drawer made another piece click into place until a chilling realization filled him.
"He's a Death Eater! And you have emergency Healers at St Mungo's who would be all too happy to drop whatever and follow you halfway around the world," Harry retorted.
“I’m not telling you not to go,” Harry told him softly, covering Draco’s hand with his own. He wanted to. Desperately. “I’m just saying that you should make sure it’s for the right reasons. Don’t do it because you feel guilty, do it because it’s what you want to do.”
“You should have seen him, Harry,” Ron chuckled before launching in a horrible imitation of Draco. “I know most of you are functional illiterates, but even this dishrag clearly states that the Healer involved in criminal activities got killed in the raid!” Ron waved his copy of the prophet with unmatched fury. “As you can see I am very much
“Maybe, but I need you to walk me through your dreams first, starting with the latest ones,” he replied, pulling out his notebook.
“Are you sure, Soup?” Draco asked, the tiniest hint of worry behind his words. Harry knew Draco trusted the elf with his life, but he couldn’t help but wonder whether Soup was still trying to get him killed and make it look like an accident.
"Officially 1962, but Hermione thinks it must be later, judging by the size of the community and the pattern of 'unexplained phenomena' reported in the area by Muggles. The local Ministry of Magic is still trying to track down all the isolated enclaves and the old British records aren't necessarily reliable."
And wasn’t it absurd? Draco’s long pale fingers buried into raven messy locks, Harry craving his approval, of all people. Harry’s eyes never left his own as he gently caressed the shell of his ear, his hand moving lower to cup his jaw, tilting his head back imperceptibly.
“First of all who said I’m the one who’s going to propose?” Draco replied, trying his best to sound haughty. “And second of all Pansy hasn’t gotten married yet so the option’s open.”
Malfoy had finally agreed to bring in a physical therapist to get him started while they took a break from reconstruction before tackling his hand. He was still aching every day, probably worse than before, but it was the deep muscle ache that came from actually exercising. It was good pain. And Harry knew that as soon as he was out investigating with Ron they would get to the bottom of the case in no time.
Draco’s hands settled on Harry’s cheeks like a promise while he trailed lazy kisses down his back, counting every knob of his spine with his tongue until finally he pulled his cheeks apart and Harry could feel the air on his hole.
"But we're not here to talk about Griffith, are we? We're here because I don't deserve luxury." Every word was dripping with a patronising sweetness. "Do you know what happens when you spend sixteen hours a day casting? You were combat trained; you should have an inkling. Your muscles get stiff. I know thinking has never been your forte but make a bit of effort with me, Potter. Do you know what happens if my hand cramps at the wrong moment?"
“Only tangentially, Healer Malfoy” Hanson replied with a grin, getting up to leave. “Have a good day, gentlemen.”
“Am I, though? Because the way he looks at me, Blaise, the fucking trust in his eyes while I lie...” Draco’s voice cracked. “I want to be the man he thinks I am, but I can’t.”
“I have no idea.” Malfoy looked like he was in physical pain as he admitted it. “But I’m going to find out.” He added, determination settling in his shoulders as he got up and left.
“And what would that craft be, pray tell?” Harry asked, shifting backwards on his elbows until he felt the slope of pillows against his back.
“I just got a peek at our books and potion stock, they don’t add up, haven’t for four months, and not even Murphy is that much of an idiot. Apparently, he’s not an idiot at all since he’s been running an illegal potions ring right under our noses.”
It burned bright and fast, filling the square with the strong scent of aromatic wood and incense, feeding magic and new life to everyone present.
“mh… And you think I’ll give out information just like that because you lost a few chess games?” Malfoy asked, his fingers rapping on his knee as he watched Harry with a spark of interest in his eyes. Harry had a feeling they were starting a new game, one he didn’t know the rules of.
and has been for the past seven years, is a volunteer emergency Healer with more field experience than half the emergency and trauma team in St Mungo's put together."
Harry watched him repeat the process several times, followed the tension in his shoulders and the furrow of his brows building and breaking the moment those memories were pulled from his mind and he relaxed.
"Ready to get back to it, Griffith?" Draco asked, rolling up his sleeves and casting a quick Diagnostic Spell to check on the girl's conditions.
“Thanks for coming, Andy.” He told Andromeda as she transfigured the plastic chair into something a little more comfortable to settle in.
He was still carrying around that weight in the pit of his stomach when they got back to the hotel after the second day of work and decided he couldn't handle another meal with Malfoy's short hair shining under the lights and his perfect smile seducing everyone it was directed at. He excused himself with Hermione and walked out on his own. They were with Foster in the unlikely possibility that anything were to happen that needed Auror intervention.
“Naughty Potter,” Draco tsked, failing miserably to keep the fondness out of his voice. “So...” He prompted, sliding both hands into Harry’s hair, scratching his nails lightly onto his scalp. Harry’s eyes fluttered closed as he tilted his head back to follow the touch of his hands.
“But I’m fine, look at me, alive, fit to work and all. You’re the one in the hospital bed,” Draco reassured him.
“Does it?” Harry asked, uncertainty bleeding into his voice. Had he read everything wrong? Malfoy glanced up at him, his fingers loose around Harry’s wrist, his eyes pained as he met Harry’s.
“Both?” Draco replied, leaning closer and taking Harry’s hand. “Whatever it is, we can figure out a way to make it happen.”
As if reading his mind Hermione dragged him back upstairs as soon as he finished his second drink. She sat him down in her suite and they played Exploding Snap until the boiling rage in Harry's stomach wasn't threatening to spill over anymore. He bid her goodnight and headed back to his room down the carpeted corridor.
“What do you think?” She rested her hands on his shoulders, meeting his eyes in the mirror. He just nodded at her.
“Nothing I didn’t already know.” Draco replied, picking up the jar of powder, sprinkling it liberally over Potter and sending a small jolt of energy through it to jumpstart the reaction, this was it. Unless the blood turned up something useful he’d wasted an entire day and a considerable amount of resources to turn up nothing. The patch had maybe a day and a half before becoming unusable and he was nowhere closer to finding a way to actually heal Potter’s wound.
"You would like Harmandir Sahib. It's all gold and marble, a work of art in the middle of the lake." Harry smiled.
“See?” He told Malfoy gesturing towards her “She thinks it could be a bond.” He said, that proved his point.
More freckles were dotting Draco’s nose than he remembered, and Harry could have counted and catalogued each one in the centuries it took for Draco to lean down and close the distance between them to finally kiss him again.
He pushed Harry's thighs open a little wider and as he ran his hands up from Harry's knees to his hips, feeling the solid muscles under his palm, Draco idly wondered how it would feel to sink his teeth in that muscle, just a little bit. And Draco was nothing if not a man of science, so he proceeded to do some empirical research on the matter. It felt really nice, and judging by the pleased gasp that rose from Harry's lips, the man agreed. The teeth imprint left on the inside of Harry's thigh made something purr deep in Draco's chest as he traced the shape with the tip of his finger.
a shitty apology, by the way,” he added. “More than being kept far from the investigation, what hurt me was that you two didn’t trust me to make that decision for myself. Had you explained the situation to me, I could have chosen to step back and hand the reins to Ron, like you got to do, instead you saw fit to handle me like a child. I hated it when I was fifteen, I didn’t like it any better this time around.” Harry grimaced in distaste at the memory of the Order of the Phoenix discussing things around him, as if they didn’t concern him very personally. “Still, forcibly extracting memories is just one step down from torture,” he continued. “I’m not entirely exempt from fault.” he rubbed his knuckles against his jaw, scratching his beard.
Once properly caffeinated and fed Draco went to get dressed, as he buttoned his robes, smoothing down the shoulders he swiped aside the vulnerability, cloaking himself in the impeccable composure he’d learned from his mother.
“Was it developed by suicidal garden gnomes?” He asked, glancing at him with a raised eyebrow “Because it would explain a lot of what’s going on here.” he added, tapping the list with a finger.
As he slid between feather-soft sheets, he couldn't help but think about the following day and what might be waiting for them behind the protection of governmental wards confining innocent people away from the resources needed to understand themselves. As big as it may be, a closet under the stairs was still a closet under the stairs. He tossed and turned, as the thought of Malfoy wouldn't allow him to rest. Nobody seemed to be able to see him for what he was. He wasn't even trying to hide it, but somehow, he still had everyone fooled. Everyone except Harry. He was going to keep an eye on him, two if he could manage.
“I’ll go take a look,” Draco sighed, plucking the list from her hand and heading down the hall at a fast clip. He’d been looking for an excuse to poke around the Potions lab anyway.
He woke up with a headache, the smell of the greenhouse lingering in his nose and a strange pain in his right hand that promised the start of a not-so-great day.
A brief stop at the caves of Elephanta explained the better shape the local community was in. The entire island was heavily magically charged with a soothing and nurturing energy that not even the establishment of British cannon positions on the southwest side could disrupt more than a little.
“Will you keep your clothes on while you fuck me into next week?” He asked. Then he cracked one eye open. “Please?”
“Could be transference.” The woman offered, looking at Malfoy for confirmation. Malfoy gave her a short nod of approval and Harry saw her visibly perk up at that, a small smile coming to her face as she turned to address him instead. She reminded him a lot of a young Hermione.
It was holding up pretty well, all things considered, but the residue wasn’t declining sensibly according to the monitoring spell.
He’d retired as a healer not too long ago to focus on teaching and research, Beauxbatons had been more than happy to have him on staff and open a post-NEWT course in preparation for healer training. Draco had to hope he’d be willing to spare a few moments for him. French flowed easily as he explained the situation and asked for his invaluable input. He signed at the bottom and sealed the letter with the hospital’s seal before sending it off into international floo postage delivery.
Harry nodded slowly, too captivated by the perfect outline of an erection under the fabric of Draco’s underwear, and the curve of his arse that Harry was sure would fit under his palm like the missing piece of a puzzle.
The days got longer and the heat more stifling after that, and Draco couldn't help but feel the weight of Potter's words oppressing his chest and cutting his breath short more than the unbearable humidity could. The monsoons were going to start soon and Granger's prophecy was slowly coming true. Draco was burning himself out, and he knew deep down he was doing it only to make Potter eat his words, or even just speak to him again, and stop pretending he was invisible when they occasionally crossed paths. He hated feeling like that, like Potter might have been right about him doing all of it for attention.
“That’s why I got you here. You’re my self-care,” Draco told him lightly, pouring himself some firewhisky.
“This,” Draco replied, handing him the green envelope. “And my pretty face, you know you can’t say no to me,” he added flipping his hair over his shoulder.
He remembered being kept in the dark while people sacrificed themselves for him, while a war went on around him and he was forbidden from intervening. He never wanted to feel like he was idling in a corner while he could be doing something useful, something impactful.
“Before we start, how was the night?” he asked, checking the chart to see if the night shift had annotated anything.
At some point, Harry decided to let the beard grow. It was around the third time Malfoy bullied him into shaving because he was, once again, starting to look like a mountain man in the least complimentary way possible. The words “sad Hagrid” were used.
He apparated home just in time for dinner. He took off the green robes, shedding his armour piece by piece, hanging it carefully before sliding on a soft t-shirt and joggers, then he joined Soup for dinner, already thinking about how he was going to explain the situation to Blaise.
“Do you really have nothing better to do than stay here and collect my dreams like divination homework?” he asked Malfoy.
“Ah, yes. It’s the only class where Ron and I did better than her, and we were absolutely rubbish at it. She quit after three classes or so.” He told Teddy, shifting a little to make space for him to get comfortable with his cup of tea. “You’re thinking about taking it?” He asked. And that opened up the discussion about fourth year electives, apparently Teddy had given them a lot of thought, enough to have a list of pros and cons for each.
“Come on, you’ve always had this weird thing for him that no one really understood.” Seamus shrugged.
When the grey London winter turned into a tentative grey London spring, Harry was ready for it to be April already, but there were briefings to be had and arrangements to be made, specific training to be done and a million other things Harry wished could be over already.
Granger narrowed her eyes at him. "It's not his style," she pointed out. "Do I need to worry about you two?"
“We’ll unpack that at a later date,” Blaise hummed, folding the notice back up. “Why are you so worried about this? It’s not the first time you get called in front of the board, not even the tenth,” He pointed out, relaxing into the chair sipping his liquor.
“It’s someone inside the hospital,” Draco said without preamble as soon as he was sure no one could overhear.
Harry sighed and started talking from the end, working his way back to the beginning, through endless boring nights walking through greenhouses, stocking cabinets, brewing and bottling potions, studying schedules, like some kind of administrative employee. Malfoy let him talk freely, interrupting him very rarely, only to ask for more details.
“I suppose I would if I read the article,” He offered, unsure what the right answer was to that question.
He promised to say hi to Hermione too and be back sometime the following week if he managed to get away from work.
“I believe that is a very reasonable request. Healer Malfoy will be suspended with pay until the end of our investigation. We’ll reconvene in three days to pronounce on the issue definitively.” She was calm and assertive in a way that reminded Draco of a young McGonagall in a way he never thought possible. Andrews didn’t find it in himself to argue. He exchanged looks with the rest of the committee and then addressed them again “If no one has any objection that’s how we’ll proceed.”
"I know we're going to have to hike a bit to get there," Potter mentioned. "There is a small enclave on Gharapuri but the locals are taking care of it. Healer Gupta came by in December to set up operations and we're sending some of ours along for technical support. The rest of us with you and Griffith are going north to Sanjay Gandhi National Park. A considerable part of the untraced magical practitioners retreated into the caves and settled on one of the summits. It was warded off when detectable accidents started happening more frequently back in the mid-1850s."
“I’m the one who doesn’t have another day. The preliminary hearing is tomorrow.” He told her, his shoulders slightly hunched “I want to finish the job while I still can.”
“Fair. But you’re going to fix me, who’s going to fix you?” Harry replied easily, a smile tugging at the corner of his lips.
Hermione held onto her hat, as the hot wind threatened to carry it off. The white sand was on the edge of too bright under the summer sun, even behind the dark glasses she was wearing, as the jeep left the outskirts of El-Tarif behind to head towards the desert. The streets got narrower and rougher the further they went from the city.
Draco had already made a horrid mistake, two actually. The second one admitting responsibility out loud in front of Potter. It was the first thing one learned: don’t admit a mistake in front of a patient if you don’t want to get sued.
"Well, this is less than ideal…" Malfoy commented once the shaking stopped. He glanced up above himself where all the points converged to the centre and then to his wand. Then he looked down to Harry, still cradling his arm. "Definitely not ideal."
“Auror Potter is currently under the effect of a… I believe you defined it as a /pseudo-bond/ as a direct result of Malfoy’s intervention.” Andrews interjected. Draco avoided Blaise’s look.
"It's not truly relevant, is it? It's the best configuration possible. Am I undervalued? Yes. Do I enjoy that? Not really. But this is how your mission succeeds and I'm broadening my cultural and technical horizon. Wasn't that what you wanted from me?"
Draco leaned over and carefully wrapped his lips around the bit of dough. It was light and fluffy, the chutney fresh and fruity, with a touch of mint that came through as he chewed thoughtfully. Potter brought his thumb to his mouth to lick a stray drop of chutney, watching him with a hint of anticipation that Draco didn't like. It took a moment for the chilis and cumin to hit and warm up his mouth, cutting through the freshness of the mango. Draco's eyes widened and so did Potter's smile.
"It's good to be back working with you, Potter, I missed this scintillating energy you bring to the table."
“We’d been growing apart for a while and she was ready to admit it. I wasn’t. I told her some pretty nasty stuff the last time we fought about it. Ron didn’t speak to me for weeks but we all worked it out in the end,” Harry summarized.
“Oh, not your first rodeo, I take it?” Draco asked with a teasing smile as he reached for the bottle of lube in the nightstand.
Harry was like spilt water, folding in on himself as he knelt down, bright green eyes looking up at him, open and vulnerable. Draco’s heart was like warm wax melting in his chest at the sight and he couldn’t help reaching out to trace the angle of Harry’s cheekbone with his fingers.
“Safe ways to sever a bond,” Malfoy replied, unperturbed by the annoyed glare Harry sent his way at the answer.
"What business do you have in Amritsar?" Harry asked eventually. He'd checked and there was no one from WON working there.
Draco only had to briefly stop by St Mungo’s once he got back to England to pick up a few things, and then he could go home. Where Harry was. Waiting and making a list of all the ways he wanted Draco to take him apart. For a moment Draco’s life felt perfectly on track.
"What in the name of Circe are you doing, Potter?!" Malfoy yelled as the wall behind them collapsed under the force of Harry's spell, blocking the exit completely.
“It wasn’t your lucky night, go look for a scoop somewhere else before I call security,” he told him in an even and deadly tone.
“Yeah, I have made a few trips round these halls,” Potter commented, scratching his beard with a little smile that was almost self-conscious if not for the glint in his eyes. He wasn’t even sorry about his unnecessary recklessness.
Warning: given the in universe context of a singular meaningful breath being what connects you to your soulmate, breathplay is common practiced and considered sappy and romantic, that is the reason why it's so under negotiated before Draco and Harry go ahead and do it. (You can @ me about it after the fest and I will debate you about it)
“I know I promised we’d discuss kink, but I need to get you naked sooner than yesterday so how about I suck you off, we fuck until we can’t stand, and
“It picks up on trace magic better than any revealing spell or diagnostic instrument we’ve created” Draco replied, putting the jar of powder down “Especially when you’re testing for something old, it picks up on things much further than a
“Oh yeah, that too, but it’s not the one I meant.” Draco couldn’t believe he forgot about France for a split second. “The interim CMO offered me the spot of Head of Potions and Poisons, here at St Mungo’s, as soon as I got back,” he mentioned. Harry’s head snapped up, almost headbutting him in the chin.
“I wasn’t the one to break up with Ginny,” he said eventually. Malfoy’s raised eyebrow and the tilt of his head betrayed his curiosity far more than his detached “Do tell” did.
Laennec Hospital had grown a lot in the ten years Draco had been away. From a small peripheral medical centre, it had become a first-tier research hub, with great momentum going forward, and they still wanted Draco to be part of their team.
Blaise would have never imagined that, after resolving to take the dark mark at sixteen, Draco would ever be in this kind of position again, fighting his every self-preservation instinct to protect someone else, falling apart in his arms. Being charged with the responsibility of Potter’s continued wellbeing was going to destroy Draco and Blaise wondered whether he could rise from the ashes again after it happened.
“Ah, oui, English don’t like putting hands into magical cores, do they?” Bonhomme hummed, a gentle teasing note in his voice
“Yeah, well we do what we can for the most interesting man in the world,” She replied, shaking her head a little. “But I’m afraid my break is over,” she added heading out.
“Unremarkable” Harry replied with a small shrug, glad that the tension seemed to dissipate as Malfoy snapped into action “More boring vivid dreams.” He reported giving Malfoy a small smile when he saw him looking down at him.
"Thank you, Daddy, I love it!" Scorpius smiled up at him, completely unperturbed by the grass stains over his presumably brand-new grey shirt, or the bit of mud on his cheek, and took the broom back. "I'm going to become great and make the Quidditch team just like you."
He wasn’t sure how long it was before Pansy tapped his shoulder to get his attention. He blinked and looked at the mirror, studying himself. She’d worked the side of his head into two tight braids on each side, swiping up into a loose ponytail. As he turned his head to study the style he caught the subtle intricacies of the small braids she’d weaved in his ponytail, each ending with a metal ring. It was meant for war, there was no mistaking it.
Harry nodded, “Yeah, they talked too, you know, Parseltongue, but they talked, I think they bit him,” he confirmed.
When they tested the wards, Draco couldn’t tell apart the old foundation, from Orion’s structure or Harry’s new additions, they’d fused together in a harmonic architecture that resonated with Harry’s magic.
Potter shook his head, "That is all temporary. I'm talking about the wiping away of culture in the name of conformity, the stunted growth of a people in the name of control. The separation, the instigation of conflict. That is what England left behind. That is what it still stands for, despite whatever mask of respectability and honour it presents."
He was somewhat surprised to find Malfoy actually waiting for him in the foyer, looking clean and put together. For all intents and purposes, he was the poster image for a distinguished western tourist… Which he was, at least for tonight.
Draco tore his eyes off the girl to look the man in the face. What the hell did they teach in St Mungo's these days?
The morning dragged by and around point fifteen the entertainment factor of Malfoy’s frustration with Bingley’s insubordination had worn off. The delight of surprise at the new and strange diagnostic tools Brown pulled up from the tray vanished around test number twenty, leaving only the irritation at being incessantly poked, rubbed, scraped, covered in rocks, powders, liquids, and just generally having strangers touching him and constantly inside his personal space.
Draco turned to look at him with an expression of polite confusion. He saw no point in discussing it but the deep frown of Potter's eyebrows suggested the man was of a different opinion.
Comment to show your support for Astoria's polite drag of Ron and Draco's need to spell things out to Harry.
"Thank you, Miss Rana, for indulging me, I won't keep you any longer. I'm sure we'll spend more than enough time together in the next weeks for you to grow weary of my company. Will you be joining us for dinner?"
"You've been antsy all night, Harry, what's got you all worked up?" Padma asked, putting away the leftover bhindi masala.
“And wasn’t that wishful thinking,” he commented, bitterness bleeding into his voice. “Thank you, Soup, I can always count on you,” he said eventually.
“Perfection doesn’t need fixing” Malfoy mentioned absently, already more absorbed by his chart than their conversation. Why wouldn’t he pay attention to him? Had he really become so stale through the years? Why couldn’t he get a rise out of him anymore?
Despite bringing their best resources and the sharing of half a celebratory drink for good luck, the mission in the Falkland Islands ended up being more complicated than they predicted. Even under Weasley's guidance it took months to clear the ground and the coast from poisoning influences, and to contain the curses they couldn't lift altogether.
Before Harry could continue there was a rustle in the undergrowth ahead of them and a moment later a man emerged from the darkness of the jungle, making his way towards the light of the torches at the side of the path.
Malfoy tore his eyes away from the domed top and looked back at Harry's face, the question clear on his face.
Hermione had the decency to at least look like she was torn about the situation, but that didn't do much to ease Harry's fuming anger.
and that’s when he knew he’d severely misjudged Murphy. He flipped the book closed and quickly gathered all that Brown needed for her procedure with Ross, making the appropriate substitutions when he couldn’t get the desired brew. They’d have to strike a careful balance, but it would be a good learning experience, for Brown at least.
Harry kept his wand in front of himself, paying attention to where he stepped on the slippery rock. There were cracks in the walls and signs of collapsed corridors, but what caught his attention were the etchings in the walls and how the rock formations were delicately shaped.
“For all we know Auror Potter could be bonded to Healer Malfoy just as much as he could be in a feedback loop with himself. Whatever the case might be, Healer Malfoy is unfit to be his Healer.” Blaise couldn’t counter that argument but there were other ways to soften the blow, if he couldn’t argue merit he could argue procedure.
“It’s a common expression of bonds.” She explained to Harry “Even temporary ones often manifest in some form of conscience transference, especially during sleep when we’re less in control of our mental defences.” Harry nodded along. Made a lot of sense.
“As ready as I’ll ever be,” he replied with a cheerful smile. He wasn’t looking forward to the pain, but the pain was temporary, an arm was forever. Or something like that.
“As good as Draco is, sometimes you need a fellow sub to talk things out, so don’t hesitate to swing around the Greengrass household when you do,” he told him before stepping into the Floo.
“Wanna hear about it?” She offered, unfolding the paper. The fact that Harry agreed to it was probably an indicator of how desperate he was to not be left alone to think.
“Hm?” Malfoy hummed vaguely in acknowledgement but didn’t tear his eyes away from his work. He never did.
Of course, everyone knew not to let the Death Eater near the poisons, Merlin knew what he might do that he couldn’t do with scalpels or a wand, what terrible damage he could wreak if he got his hands on pain relievers or blood replenishers.
Draco decided he needed to take a nice long bath to wash the day out of his skin, take Blaise’s advice and take care of himself a little. Light a candle or two, add some essential oils, let the water work its magic… He was almost dozing off, his head resting on the side of the bathtub when Pansy’s reply arrived, making him smile and ache at the same time.
"It's been eleven years." She murmured. Draco could only nod, staring out at the green perfectly trimmed lawn "He would be starting Hogwarts." Draco squeezed her hand and just nodded again, unable to meet her eyes. It was only too easy to forget that his own grief was also hers, such was the nature of a parent, the pain of their children was returned tenfold onto them, and there is no pain unfathomable quite like the loss of a child. There were no words to encompass it, no medicine to soothe it, not even time could cure it, barely dulled the sharp edges of it.
Hermione sighed, pushed open the door and walked in. "I'm starting to wonder whether I've bitten more than I can chew," she admitted.
"Griffith can take care of mending bones and some burns for one day on his own. You said it yourself how much better he's gotten in just a month and a half. Healer Gupta is there for anything more complex," she cut off his protest.
He could feel the weight of all his choices on his shoulders, and the mark on his arm a testament to them. His only saving grace was being able to put all the expertise he’d gained during the war towards something good, giving life instead of taking it. The vow of non-maleficience was his only anchor, a balance to when he swore allegiance to a genocidal man.
The days started to blend together for Draco after a while. Potter still pretended like he didn't exist save for those times he looked at him full of contempt. He knew he didn't have a leg to stand on when it came to Potter; any kind of animosity he still held was entirely justified, Draco had done more than enough to warrant a lifelong grudge, and he'd fooled himself into thinking that if Granger was willing to overlook their past, Potter would do the same.
I'm alive. Thank you all for your patience, but things will still be spotty for a while. Work has been taking up most of my time, and study has been taking up the rest.
“Relax,” he murmured, placing a kiss behind his ear. “They’re children, they won’t judge your fashion choices.”
“So, Potter, I hear we might have more in common than originally thought,” Blaise mentioned casually, stirring his tea.
“Malfoy?” he called softly, watching his slender wrist bend and flick his wand in a flourish that by now was intimately familiar.
“It’s not going to hurt me either,” he assured, reaching out for Harry’s hand and placing his palm over his hip bone, covering the red feathers. “It’s just a tattoo right now. Barely even magical.”
Harry hummed softly, letting her get everything out. Ron and he had learnt a long time ago that sometimes it was best to let Hermione talk until she figured out the solution to her problems on her own. She just needed someone to nod and hum at appropriate intervals so she could detangle her mind.
They didn't. Only because the hotel staff insisted and Granger used words such as 'denser than a garden gnome' when Potter mentioned wanting to go out in the middle of a monsoon.
Draco’s hands were strong and inquisitive when they ran down his sides and caught on the elastic of his briefs, tugging them down with a decisive move, leaving him completely bare under Draco’s burning gaze.
“Malfoy’s going to have a field day with that” Harry groaned, he’d done some stupid shit and of all people he wanted to get their hands on that kind of information Malfoy was probably the last.
Draco lifted his chin and straightened his shoulders tugging slightly on the lapels to make sure the robes fell right on his body and walked in, followed by Blaise half a step behind.
Harry pushed himself up, a wide smile never leaving his lips. “Yeah,” he replied, reaching for Draco’s belt, quickly unbuckling it. “You’re way overdressed.”
"Screw you, Malfoy," he muttered before backing out the room and pulling the door behind himself. It didn't even give him the satisfaction to slam shut; damn Cushioning Charms in the frame.
The sand crunched under her boots as she took a few steps toward the tent but before she could reach it, a hand pushed the flap aside from inside and he stepped out, the disinfection charms still glimmering around him as he stretched, turning his face up to the sun. Despite everything, she still felt relief wash over her as she saw him physically there.
“You can be whatever you want, Teds” Harry told him. “As long as you make all your NEWTs and train hard.” He added.
Harry was tempted to linger in the shower; the water pressure was perfect and the scent of the body wash divine, but he had a plan for the evening. He scrubbed himself down, paying attention to get the mud out from under his nails and between his toes. He wrapped a towel around his waist, wiped the condensation from the mirror, and looked at the image critically. He rubbed his cheek, feeling the scrape of stubble under his fingers. It could stay. It was not like Malfoy would care if he was clean-shaven or not. He wasn't going to kiss the git so he had no stand to complain. He ran a hand through his wet hair and decided his curls could pass as artfully tousled if one were to argue about it, which Harry fully expected to be put in the position to.
“You’re going to be ok, Potter.” Malfoy told him again, meeting his eyes and holding his gaze for a moment, there was certainty on his face and Harry nodded slowly, willing himself to believe that Malfoy knew what he was doing.
“Hello Harry, Draco. So, Grimmauld Place was checked out, and whatever you guys did or didn’t do in there made a veritable mess. The amount of unstable magic in there is the stuff of nightmares so, as much as I trust in the capabilities of my colleagues from the curse-breaking division, and the volatile magic specialists, we should start thinking about an alternative accommodation for you, Harry,” she told them, summoning a chair and plopping down in it. “And I haven’t properly thanked you, Draco. I know whatever you pulled off inside that house probably saved Ron’s life and half a dozen other officers,” she added with a smile. “What
"Sorry, protection charms," he apologised. "Ambassador Granger, to what do I owe the pleasure of a visit from the most beloved of England's high officials?" he asked, casually rolling down the left sleeve of his shirt.
"I want you to get some freshly butchered meat when we get back to the city and practice regrowing tissue without the help of potions, because I have the feeling this isn't going to be the last organ we'll have to remake and there is only one of me." He tore his eyes off the girl and glanced up at Griffith's face waiting for him to acknowledge the order.
"I suppose we'll have to continue working in tandem, with Griffith and I dealing with the emergencies while you and your team take preventative measures with the population." He'd been hoping to learn more about Healer Gupta's style of healing, but his personal interests had to take a step back in the face of the current situation. "The strain should lessen once Granger can reach a compromise with the government about education. We just need to hold things at bay until they get a new gurukul."
“I wasn’t in too much pain this morning and I was kind of bored of losing at chess,” he replied with an easy smile.
"Potter—" Malfoy called him when they got off, but when Harry turned around he hesitated. "Thank you."
Andrews didn't tolerate tardiness unless it was his own apparently. It was just ten minutes before they were called in, but it was the principle of it, the implicit show of power in leaving someone waiting, that irritated Draco. The committee was supposed to be a neutral body, it should be supporting the staff, troubleshooting problematic circumstances and setting up protocols to prevent them from happening again, not a place to appease the power fantasy of some individuals.
"It's nothing illegal, Potter, don't get your panties in a twist. I have property there I need to check on."
“I’m not leaving him here, Malfoy, in the hands of the people that almost killed him and will happily try again.”
As he got closer he noticed it wasn't just black, it was almost like damask, sinewy figures running through the fabric black on black, there was a floral natural theme to them but abstract enough to need a close inspection and a bit of imagination to interpret. The back of the robes was occupied by a phoenix in flight, in the same translucent black thread, almost invisible under the low light. Its wings spread out to the full width of the shoulders, its neck curving over the left shoulder and peeking over to the front just barely.
And Harry was on his own again, to face another uncomfortable night, at least whatever was wrong with the environment control spell got fixed during the day because he didn’t feel as hot and stuffy like the night before, and he most definitely couldn’t smell the Thames as he fell asleep.
The perfectly crispy hash browns didn't keep Draco from eyeing the pancakes Potter was having, or the dips arranged on the table in front of him. He was unsubtle enough that Potter ended up offering him a taste, in the name of Draco's cultural education, of course.
Harry looked down at his hand and closed the fist. “Feels fine,” he replied before spotting the purple streaks running from his knuckles to his wrist. “Woah, those weren’t there this morning!”
Thanks to the new connection, the library filled day by day, as the men and women gathered outside it to listen and practice their magic with fewer and fewer accidents with every passing week. Harry often sat on the balustrade under an arched window and watched people of all ages help each other out to figure out how to bring out the energy they had inside instead of letting it burn them up. Every flare of the torch planted in front of the library was a small victory, every seedling of gooseberry growing brought more hope and a sense of accomplishment that filled Harry's chest with pride and comfort he'd never felt before. He was invited to a tattooing ceremony for one of the boys reaching adulthood and earning the first permanent magic channelling tattoo.
"I hope you know what you're doing, Ambassador," Malfoy mentioned before sliding his glasses back on his face and walking out, presumably to get back to work on cleansing clueless Muggles and reckless wizards from Nundu poison.
This chapter has been a struggle but I've been looking forward to getting to this scene so much, I'm just happy to publish it at this point.
Her words cut deep. They were true but it wasn't enough. He hadn't done enough in the end and he'd done too much for it to be balanced by that. His mother was sitting straight right next to him, thin and frail, her hair greyer than he remembered it being the last time he'd seen her.
“Did you sleep alright?” he asked, Harry shrugged “use your words, Potter, please, I’m begging you” Malfoy sighed, looking down at him.
"I see you're in a great hurry to go correct their misconception." Harry crossed his arms and looked at him with a raised eyebrow.
“There weren’t many things she was wrong about,” Malfoy replied, sliding the holster back on his arm, tightening the straps with precise and practised movements.
“Before I leave you to an undoubtedly satisfying lunch I wanted to introduce you to Healer Dana,” Malfoy mentioned, gesturing to the woman next to him.
Malfoy rested an elbow on the table and studied him for a moment, propping his cheek on his hand, "Now, is that supposed to be a compliment?"
Ron eventually left to go back to the Ministry to deal with the aftermath, and it left Harry and Draco alone in the room, with silence stretching between them. There was so much running through Harry’s head he didn’t know where to start. There had been something growing between them for months, something undeniable, but then they had the fight of their lives and Harry had crossed several lines. They had done horrible things to each other, and it felt like there was a chasm between them, so big and empty that building another bridge on the rubbles of the last one seemed impossible. But Draco had come to him, despite everything, begging not for forgiveness but for a chance to save Ron and the team, asking nothing in return.
As soon as he stepped inside, arm in arm with Daphne and he found himself immersed in the smell of leather and latex in the low light, he could finally breathe freely.
Hermione rested her hands on the table and leaned closer, "I've been tracking you through your tour of the commonwealth with Wizards Outside Nations, volunteering at any magical or magic-adjacent catastrophe where they would take you. I'm fairly confident you want to start cleaning up the bullshit colonial England left behind almost as much as I do. We've left those people to fend for themselves for too long, they deserve better than that from us. I think we need to be accountable for the damage and I know you agree." She raised an eyebrow daring him to disagree. "I can't say that much about the emergency Healers at St Mungo's."
He couldn't avert his eyes from the magnificent architecture, the open doorway calling him closer to home, but there was still the name of foreign monarchs smiling from above as they stepped into the welcoming shadow of the arches and headed towards the city.
This is my baby, my creature, my love, but you were a wonderful co-parent. It wouldn’t be as good as it is without you and I would not have had half the fun writing it. Thank you for helping me breathe life into this creature.
“A fantasy, it’s entirely natural, we all have them and I won’t hold it against you.” Malfoy finished for him, annoyingly in control of himself. Harry’d just accidentally shown himself on his knees begging…
Harry glanced at Malfoy’s face, but the abject horror reflected in his eyes, barely held back by the clench of his jaw, made him avert his eyes.
He was perfect, kneeling above Harry, those black briefs looked painted on and the golden pattern on the elastic did nothing to dispel the illusion of a renaissance painting.
Harry stared at him stunned at the thought of owning his ancestral home, and after a long moment Draco seemed to hesitate in front of his silence.
this morning in all your tragic glory,” Draco replied, standing up to check on the patch on Potter’s chest.
“I’m just a guest lecturer,” Draco reminded him, walking back out in a simple ensemble of white linen and olive green suit.
After that night he managed to go a full two weeks without doing anything stupid. He kept up with his Occlumency training with Malfoy, he very carefully explored the extent of his bond with the man on the other side, he relayed his dreams to Ron twice a week, slipping in whatever extra information he dug up through the bond, and obeyed Paul’s every order when it came to his physical therapy.
“You too, mate” Seamus replied with a fond smile “Come on, play with me.” He told him, turning the board.
“Of course it’s Potter upending a carefully balanced equilibrium in my life.” Draco laughed, the tension bleeding out of him as he emptied the glass again and fully laid down on the sofa, his back against the armrest. He wandlessly called the bottle to him to pour himself another glass.
“So, they took the antidote. Which is good, since it kept you from dying, but it means you’re transferring a lot more than we thought,” Malfoy sighed. “No wonder we couldn’t balance your treatment, we didn’t have half the stuff you were interacting with.” He twirled the pencil twice in his left hand, “We don’t even know what was an adverse reaction to our treatment and what was transference. Merlin, Potter, you couldn’t be easy for once, could you?” He shook his head, “we need to find a way to cut you off from the bond.”
“You already are,” Draco replied, squeezing his hand gently as he pressed his forehead against Harry’s.
Malfoy was relaxed as they played, a small smile gracing his lips as his eyes wandered over the board. There was nothing of the tense concentration Harry’d seen on his face while he was playing with Ron. He would have felt offended if he didn’t so much enjoy the look of him so at ease and clearly in his element. There was an easy smile on his face as he watched Harry ponder and strategize, and that look didn’t make it any easier for Harry to keep his strategy straight. He felt like Malfoy was toying with him, a game of cat and mouse where Harry was meant to stay alive only as long as it amused him. Malfoy was so open and relaxed, so comfortable with his skills that Harry started catching him give out tells when Harry made his moves; a quick smile when he opened his pieces up for the taking, a raised eyebrow when he made a surprisingly bold move, a subtle widening of his eyes when Harry stumbled into putting him on the ropes for a moment.
Draco was getting ready to leave when he realized the shrunken chessboard was still in his pocket. He sighed and decided he could just drop it in Potter’s room on his way out. He checked he wasn’t forgetting anything, picked up the damned green envelope and walked out, following familiar corridors at a brisk pace.
"I have no idea," Draco replied honestly. "As far as I know you can't change the magical charge of an environment from one day to the next, I'm thinking of the struggle to cleanse remnants of Dark Magic from the earth or buildings, this… This is beyond anything I've ever done, it's centuries of nurture and devotion…"
He decided to stop by his office to send a quick note to Soup asking him to bring over his chessboard. He wasn’t about to go steal from paediatrics to entertain Potter.
And with that word, the spell was broken and time started running again. Even as he went to shower, Draco could still feel the gentle caress of Potter's eyes on him.
“In the coming days I might not be able to be as present as I’d like so she will be taking over for me when needed.” Harry could swear there was an unsatisfied edge to his voice, a displeased angle to his lips, like this whole thing was an annoyance to him and Harry immediately needed to know why. “Aadhya, I’m sure Potter doesn’t need an introduction.” She nodded with an amicable smile.
Potter's eyes falling to his exposed forearm didn't go unnoticed either. As much as he avoided meeting Draco's eyes, or in any way acknowledging his presence, his eyes kept drifting away from whoever he was talking with and towards the dark lines of the snake coils whenever Draco reached for his glass. Before dessert was served Draco discreetly rolled down his sleeves and buttoned the cuffs at his wrist. That finally prompted Potter to look at his face and it was Draco's turn to avoid his gaze, entertaining Healer Gupta and Yuvarani with tales of a very wet summer in the Amazonian forest.
@NanBlythe, @sutera28, @LoonyBadger, @Caterine2403 Thank you for taking the journey with me more or less from the beginning. Talking to you guys in the comments was what made this whole adventure exciting and meaningful. In particular I want to thank @Caterine2403 for making me feel for the first time the truly international nature of fandom and @LoonyBadger for being so unwaveringly supportive of my writing but adamantly refusing to enable my procrastination of academic work, if I’ve gotten as far as I have on my thesis (which isn’t that far, tbh, but still...) it’s also because of you. (Also I’m writing these in the law library instead of working… oops?)
Harry put on his best smile while he was introduced to said woman. She was tall with the kind of strong frame that made Harry think of a devoted practitioner of physical disciplines. Her dark hair was pulled back into a stern and neat plait hanging down her back, but her smile was kind and genuine when she greeted him. Harry brought his hands to his chest and bowed his head.
Harry shook his head. "You probably don't even remember this but we met in Madam Malkin's shop and you weren't the image of pleasantness there either," he informed him.
Harry couldn’t help but chuckle, he was getting predictable, or maybe Harry had been spending a little too much time inside Malfoy’s head and vice-versa.
"So I've heard, which begs the question why are you here asking me to come along for a second trip." Draco turned to Granger "I'm sure you have Healers lining up at your door to be associated with your pet project. And they can't be all entirely inept, Griffith himself was halfway decent when I left him."
“What about your training in Occlumency, is he good enough to hold secrets?” Blaise nudged his forehead to bring his attention back to them and not the danger looming over Potter.
“Oh, I don’t doubt that, you’re just not the easiest patient, and I don’t see Malfoy being the type to put up with that.” Seamus replied.
“You didn’t tell me you had another tattoo,” Harry mentioned, reaching out tentatively to trace the outline of the iris. Draco was immensely grateful that was the thing he focused on instead of the scars.
“Wait, am I getting inside your head?” Harry asked, catching up to the implication of Malfoy’s words.
He exchanged a few words with the nurses of the night shift and the trainees before heading up to Potter’s room. He got there just as Hanson was leaving.
“It’s not just a tattoo, this one is magical. It has a temperature control spell embedded into it, combined with the ones Pansy puts in my clothes, it prevents me from having to constantly cast it myself or straight up hibernate in winter,” Draco explained, watching the fascination in Harry’s eyes as he studied it.
“Not many know both killing curses left a scar,” Harry replied, brushing his fingers gently along Draco’s cheekbone. “Besides, I much prefer having your mark near my heart over his,” he added. Draco turned to kiss the palm of Harry’s hand.
