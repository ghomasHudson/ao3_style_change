Draco assumed they had to follow his example and was about to puncture his own finger when a hand wrapped around his wrist.
“Well she is a curse-breaker, she kind of work with weird stuff most of the time”
“There it is” he was grinning. The bastard was grinning. Draco was losing his composure, his mind and his pride for the rest of his miserable life and Harry Potter was grinning cockily, obviously satisfied with the reaction he was getting from Draco.
“Oh, please. Stop being so overprotective. I’m fine. Adjusting, I guess, but perfectly fine. Let’s find Mr. Hilarious at once. I want to go get some rest” he gave Harry’s hand a soft squeeze and the brunet smiled. He tried really hard to resist the urge of kissing him right there and then.
“What is it?” he asked gently to the little elf.
“Don’t worry, it doesn’t hurt. Although it feels a bit hot at the beginning” Cleaning both magically and physically his forearm and fastening the string around his bicep, Potter grabbed the drug container and pressed the pointy tip on his skin, where his veins were popping out. He closed his eyes, waiting for the pain as he didn’t believe Potter for an instant, but it never came. He did feel the point, burning a bit, but nothing else. Potter’s hands removed the string carefully and even caress the place a little, his magic tingling in Draco’s arm. He opened his eyes to see how the liquid disappeared through his skin, shining all the way up his pale arm, like a glowing river. It was actually kind of beautiful. It took two minutes for the vial to empty and the same burning sensation appeared when the Gryffindor removed it. There was no mark left in the place “How are you feeling?” asked the other while grabbing a notebook and taking some notes.
“How do you possess someone without trying?” Draco hissed again when his hand touched the wound in his abdomen. Harry stood up and checked it for him.
“Master Potter, what can Kreacher do for you?”
“Alexei, be careful” Olga shouted calling their mother’s attention.
“He gave up the magical world after some incident and moved on making the muggles believe he was some kind of messenger from God and that he could perform miracles through pray and touch and sexual stuff. I don’t know if the divination part is true, but if it is, I’m starting to think they are all bonkers”
“You’re not going anywhere without me. We’ll get through this together, I promise” Draco believe him, of course he did. He took advantage of their position and hugged Harry tightly, feeling the other man hold him carefully, as if he was something precious that shouldn’t be harmed. He felt the first drops fall on his neck, just where his healer deposited a kiss.
“What about, sweetheart?” she looked concerned, so he tried his best to hold back a smile.
“Where are we?” he asked as he registered his own body. He was hurting everywhere. He couldn’t define where, he just felt like a hippogriff had dance a polka on him.
When they landed where Ms. Kozlova dropped them, Harry thought they had changed countries. The isolated and imposing castle didn’t fit in that place. Yekaterinburg, where he discovered they were later that day, was one of the most beautiful places he had seen, full of joyous people and beautiful colors. They had gone straight to the wizarding part of the city, which had the single access point to and from the school.
“He did nothing, my friend” Rasputin asked “I have no idea what you are implying but I do know you must be mistaken. I don’t know you and I am very much alive” Harry looked at Death. It was there, but no one seemed to notice it; it looked very interested in the exchange.
“How is he?” she asked, worried, starting to dry his son’s forehead. Harry took another towel and started cleaning the skin surrounding the injuries.
“Yes. I’ll be ready in fifteen minutes” he stood up from the bed and made his way back to his own room.
“I have never been asked out before” he said softly when he finally spoke.
“The most plausible explanation is that you have suffered some kind of soul alteration, since your core was intact when I checked it” he finished and Draco took a second to absorb the information.
“Good morning, darling, would you want some breakfast?”
“Good morning, sleeping beauty” Harry greeted and Draco blushed. Of course he blushed. Who had energy to flirt at this hour?
“Yeah, yeah. Pretend it’s just that” Harry knew he was joking, he had to be, but it was true. It wasn’t just that. They continued eating, going over some more research and playing with the cats.
“How long have I been out?” the blond asked as he straightened himself in the bed. Harry was next to him, in the chair he usually occupied, making notes on his pad.
“And I have told you a million more that I won’t let you, mom. Speaking of which, you have to tell me how much do we owe Potter, you are not paying for that either”
“Shush” he burst at that, but she managed to keep her own smile hidden.
“Harry?”
“Master doesn’t need to cook” the elf hated when he cooked. Harry loved it, it was relaxing, but he barely had the time, so he would not bother Kreacher frequently. He decided to ignore him, or they were going to be arguing until tomorrow and Draco and him had skipped lunch, so Harry wanted to make an early dinner for them.
Alexei was six years old, he was playing with his sisters in the garden by the fountain while his mother read a book, sheltered from the sun under a tree. He had his eyes covered, counting till ten while his sisters hid somewhere around for him to find them. Well, Olga was not hiding, she claimed to be there just to watch over Alexei in case he fell or something, she said she was too old for children’s games. But she was there and that’s all that mattered.
The door was barely open and Harry just pushed a little before seeing his wand abandoned on the floor, and mirrors, everywhere.
“To the library, then?” the blond asked, heading to the door, but he paused when he spotted a portrait in the door-wall. A teenage boy, with dark, wavy hair and pricing blue eyes, very similar to Draco’s mother’s, and a kind look, was smiling at him.
“So?” that man was an imbecile. That was for granted. Draco’s chest was still moving and that, along with Alexander’s presence, seemed to have calmed Harry enough so he could think properly.
“If you have something to say, Draco, do it now, but I assure you it won’t change anything” maybe he wasn’t hiding his emotions as well as he thought, at least not to his mother.
“Can we get an ice-pop?” the boy pouted, knowing it softened his godfather most of the times.
“I liked it, okay?” he crossed his arms and looked away, cheeks blushed.
“It’s been a while”
Summarizing the situation: he possibly had a stranger’s soul appended to his, that was causing him a deadly illness. It would only manifest when he was weak because it didn’t intend on possessing him but some unknown dark wizard had decided that this should happen and not even the most brilliant witch he knew was able to guarantee it had a solution. Great. Just great.
Harry turned to Draco, who had been silent for too long and instantly ran to him.
“I will. Please, send Mr. Malfoy my regards” she smiled sadly and he knew why, she had told him about Lucius’ state, but she nodded anyway before leaving him alone.
She looked at him when the door clicked as it closed behind him.
“Hermione!” Potter rolled his eyes in protest.
“I will” they smiled. Ginny who had her head resting in his brother’s shoulder, looked confused for a second, but probably decided she didn’t want to know what they were talking about “Be good, Harry”
“See you, Harry”
“Are there any records of what he used to do here?” Harry asked. He knew Rasputin had gone back to Koldovstoretz once before his death and that had to mean something.
“Sorry we are late” she said. The tension was almost physical and not even her peculiar presence did much to change that.
“I think he got the idea, Luna” Hermione intervened and the blond nodded, but still looked at him like she was expecting an answer.
The one on the right was too small; Harry wouldn’t fit there either, not even the big elf from the castle would fit there.
just in case. Then undressed him and started applying ointment in every hematoma that covered his body. He had not hurt himself beyond that, but it was not normal to develop those bruising spontaneously. Yet, again, Draco’s illness had very little of normal.
“There, was it that difficult?”
“I bet you did” he heard him laugh on the other side of the line.
“Generally. I skip a couple meals when I have too much work and Kreacher is always pestering me about it”
Next step was to take care of himself. He asked Kreacher for some coffee and breakfast and made his way to the bathroom. Cold water was in order and he let it run over him, just standing there clearing his head for a while before taking his honey and almonds shampoo and pouring a little bit too much in his hair; some of the product fell down his neck but he ignored it, mixing it later with the soap to wash the rest of his body. Foam was everywhere in the shower and he appreciated even more the cold water now; steam would have made the air too heavy with smells and his head was not in the mood for it.
“I can picture the scenario, yeah” Harry chuckled at Draco’s horrified face.
When they stopped in front of the hotel he almost started crying. There was a half-rotten sign hanging from the left side, the painting was falling from the walls and most of the windows were broken; it smelled like every bad thing in the world mixed together.
“There you are, my little monster” they both laughed. They almost looked like good friends, and as concerning as that might have been, Harry had to admit that he liked it. When he took his place in front of Hermione, she sent him a knowing look, but he chose to ignore it. She was one to be judging when five minutes ago she was being all nice to a guy she allegedly hated.
“Forget it” he was standing up. He had been serious, he had said something embarrassing, asked something important for him and Harry was joking. Harry pulled him back softly and hugged him.
“No, this one is fine. I just…I’m not used to cats. Mother never let me have any pet other than an owl and the manor is not exactly near anywhere with domestic animals. I only saw them at Hogwarts and now that my neighbors have a dog, but no cats around” an image of teenage Draco trying to stroke Crookshanks in the halls of the castle when no one was looking popped into Harry’s mind and he almost cooed.
“Bollocks! Lollipops are nothing compared to…ugh, never mind. Could we please forget this ever happened and go to the library?”
“I am sure you recognize that spell, Dmitri” he pointed to the circle.
“You didn’t know?!” Harry was alarmed. He dropped the old book to the floor. So much for extra-careful.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about” he sipped from his cup avoiding eye contact, again.
“Do we have to do this?” Harry asked Ellias, who had come back to see what was taking them so long.
“What is that doing here?” he asked, confused, as the little ball wrapped its wings around itself. Harry didn’t answer. Instead he pulled a little away from Draco and kissed the golden ball. Draco was completely puzzled and the fact that Harry was kneeling wasn’t helping his reasoning abilities in the slightest “Harry?” he looked down to Harry’s offered hand, where the snitch was opening to reveal a beautiful blue sapphire-encrusted ring “Oh, Salazar” was that happening? Was that really happening?
“It’s called a laptop. Is a portable computer. Muggles use them for research, working and storing stuff” Harry had answered absentmindedly before pressing a particularly large button. Suddenly, a picture of a bearded man, a fancy woman and a bunch of kids in black and white popped into the screen, making Draco jump.
“I see” Luna said, and she looked like she was about to say something else when a newly arrived red-haired made his entrance.
“You had been through some serious shit when you had his age too and you handled it just fine” he felt Harry laugh.
“You cook?” he was not believing it, not for a second.
“Well, yeah, but that is because of his attachment to your soul, it’s affecting you like Voldemort did with me, but he was a wizard, all of our existence is linked to our magic, Alexei is not”
“So we have to do this every day?” he asked putting on his shirt again hiding the scars in his chest. Potter hadn’t mention them when they had met again, but he still felt uncomfortable showing himself to the other wizard like that. It was a mixture between bad memories coming back and utter shame.
What?
“You never told me what had happened after I passed out” he said after a while, when they were just relaxing “And don’t you dare call me the Boy-Who-Lived again, Potter or I swear I’ll cut your balls off” Harry’s laughter made his body vibrate.
“What?” his face was red, and he looked exposed, so Draco decided to tease him a bit more.
“This is the first time I believe you are a healer” said Draco as soon as he stepped in his bedroom “Green robes and tons of potions, classic look”
Draco could see himself everywhere. His eyes were sunken, he looked skinnier with Harry’s green wool sweater hanging from his shoulder, his pajama pants were losing from his hip, he had bandages on his hands and arms, messy short hair; every reflection had something different to remind him of his current state. He had to go to the basement…the library… to fix that. He dropped Harry’s wand and touched his face to see if the other Dracos would do the same. They did. They all mimicked him. So, he was either hallucinating or he had stepped into a room full of mirrors. That school had something with mirrors.
“I don’t care, go away!” he was deadly worried, he needed to check on Draco, he was injured and sick, so he dismissed his self-surviving instincts and pointed his wand at the door whispering
“I should be able to speak Russian since Alexei can speak English” Draco mentioned as they made their way to the spa after he tried to read a sign in Cyrillic.
“After all I had to do to convince you that I didn’t need to be watched” it was true. This morning he had woken up to a completely healed thigh, and Harry had already given him his medicine by midnight, when they decided to go to bed.
“Excuse me? I must have misheard you, I thought you said Malfoy just now” Harry chuckled at his friend tone.
“Thank you, Hermione. But I don’t think Harry will agree to this” she smiled softly.
Harry almost buried the man with a look but he softened his expression when Draco entwined their fingers. They walked past the entry, not contentedly, since Draco could feel some kind of spell rummaging through his magic, but after the initial moment of discomfort he found himself pleased with the way more adequate vision that welcomed them. That was more Draco’s style: fancy and cozy.
It was a strange library. It had no bookshelves, no parchments, no tables, no quills, no people, no Harry. It was empty.
“Do you want to go back to sleep? I can come back later; you seem to be healing just fine”
“Do you know him?” it was a dumb question but Harry was not in his best condition.
When Harry considered he was peaceful enough he pointed his wand at him and started chanting the spell. It was a long, complicated incantation and he had to focus as much as Draco, the main difference being that he didn’t need to keep a pose.
It was written in English, for some mysterious reason and it brought back a lot of memories that Harry had chosen to burry deep. He aligned the key with the lock and turned it to the right two times and four to the left, like Alexander had instructed. He heard a clicking sound and the door opened when he pushed.
He would take an Unbreakable Vow.
“Of course, it’s written in Cyrillic” he cursed internally and made the promise of studding a couple languages when he went back to England.
“I know”
“Always” Harry answered from the kitchen and Draco kissed Hermione’s cheek. Greeting Ronald was still a delicate thing. Draco had received the ultimate awkward hug in Christmas’ Eve. When Harry had finally told them they were together and the red-haired had tried his best to show his acceptance. Not a pleasant experience.
No, all of them were Nagini.
“A deceitful man; a wizard, like you. He wanted me to return his soul back from my domain once he died, and, in exchange, he would gift me with five pure ones” it made a pause “Your kind seems to have a dangerous taste for immortality” Harry knew it meant Voldemort.
“The pleasure is mine, Mrs. Malfoy, and there’s nothing to thank, it did sound urgent” he sat in a couch. A house elf offered him something to drink but he politely refused “You said he wasn’t responding to regular treatment”
There was also the thing about Alexander. He thanked every god out there that it had been him who had picked them up, but he still owed the man an explanation. He just hopped he would be discrete until Harry was able to talk to him. Draco had no classes until Monday; that gave him two days to recover, but to Harry that wasn’t nearly enough. He was at risk from now on whether the connection was broken or not. He had very few options: either finding another temporary solution to control the kid’s soul or fucking solve what they had come to do at once and going back home.
“It just makes no sense” he declared “They are supposed to be secret spies and they are going around the city shooting at each other from their vehicles like it’s the most normal and discreet thing to do” Draco was hugging Harry’s bare chest while talking. The dark-haired wizard had put on his underwear after their bath, but Draco had fallen in love with the Turkish cotton bath-robe, which were a beautiful shade of green. He stopped to eat the fruit the other man was offering but kept speaking after that “They don’t even know how to obliviate the witnesses” Harry’s chest vibrated with his laughter.
“I couldn’t. I kept getting ideas and it made it impossible to rest” was Potter’s answer. He was smoothing the covers of the bed. He patted the spot that faced the mirror and Draco took it as a signal to sit there.
“I don’t have a chimney in here, but I could open the one in my workshop or give you access to apparate. And I would rather do this tomorrow, if you don’t mind”
“Not really” he was already making his way to help him get to the bathroom “How are you feeling?” the honey and pine scent was so distracting. Why did he had to smell so good so early?
No one said a word, but his mother’s face made it clear it was very much true: Harry Potter was in his bedroom.
“Relax, Draco, it doesn’t hurt. I will try to reach for your soul in a much more innocuous way than Dementors do. It may feel a little invasive, somehow like mind reading, but it’s not painful, I promise” Draco nodded but he didn’t look any less concerned “I will stop if you ask me to” Malfoy fixed his eyes in Harry’s and his shoulders relaxed with a sigh.
“Well, I’ll leave you three to talk. I already asked Bibly for some tea but if you need anything else I’ll be in the garden” Narcissa excused herself and left them alone.
He reached the field and sat on a rock to relax. His knee hurt and while it was bearable, he knew he needed to rest a moment before heading back. He took a flower between his palms and rub them together, the smell of it intensifying. He picked up a bunch of them and tied them after transfiguring a leaf into a green ribbon.
Draco moved from his place next to the window, embracing himself, before grabbing one of Harry’s hideous sweaters on his way to the bed. It was a simple, yet, beautiful wand. Draco left the cup on the table and took the wand; he listened to it.
“I’ll be fine, mom. Please, don’t cry. I’ll do anything Potter says, I promise” his body was screaming for him to go back to bed, but he couldn’t see her like that and do nothing.
“Maybe. But it looks amazing on you and it feels great so, no shaving. Take care of it but the beard stays” he declared “And now stop with the cocky grin and go get my breakfast” he stole one more kiss and freed Harry so he could go check the oven.
“With my family, they were…we were…” he started breathing heavily again, until realization stroke him “I am dead” it was not a question this time.
He reached for it, fighting the panic that had taken control of his body when he saw Nagini going up his leg.
“It’s not about tags. That doesn’t matter to me” he explained “I haven’t had anything formal, ever. And I’m tired of not knowing, of having nothing for certain” he was. He was done with open relationships, which was a nice way of justifying cheating, he was done with one night stands and contact information. He was not willing to go through that with Harry, he didn’t think he was able to settle for that this time.
“I have a shift at the hospital, but I had to bring you these. Take one before each meal until I get the new medicine done” he left the vials in the bedside table with a note specifying the amount and time in case the blonde forgot it.
What had been Draco wearing when he left the room? What had they last talked about? Had he said something and Harry didn’t notice?
He was not ready to lose Draco.
“I am Rasputin’s grandson. I think I can say, confidently, who you are” bum.
Security reasons, sure.
“No, he didn’t!”
“I’m so happy for you two” he said as he squeezed Ron’s shoulders.
Harry looked up, to the inscription over the doorframe of that same room and swallowed hard.
“And here I was, planning to make your favorite for breakfast” interest shined in Draco’s eyes immediately.
“I love you” he whispered and kissed his cheek.
“Why would you do that to him?” Rasputin looked at him, confused. The bastard dared to look confused.
“I…I am not Draco” the voice was his, definitely, but the accent, the tone, the look in his eyes when Harry managed to finally focus on them…that was not Draco Malfoy.
“Teddy!” he said kneeling next to the boy, who let the puppy go and jump to his godfather’s neck.
He made every turn out of luck, or magic, or something but he did them anyway. He would find the library; he knew it was there. He would find his answers, his boyfriend, his body…
“I… I don’t want you to…” he looked like he was going to barf again, but it didn’t happen. Harry took out his wand and summoned a glass of water.
“I know” he had no idea what the blond was feeling, he could not start to fathom it, but he had felt so sad when he found out it was a kid “We’re going to help him, Draco, I promise” the other wizard nodded again, as convinced as himself: not at all “Let me tend to your injuries now, please”
Draco decided he would investigate the thing with the fire and ice in this place later. For now, he would enjoy it.
Alexander led the way, going first through the gap. Harry turned and looked at Death, hovering next to the arc, just like it had been when he had arrived.
“Is it the phone or not?” he had bought one two or three years ago, but he had barely used it.
Harry was awake. Teddy didn’t know that. The little boy was trying to sneak into his bed like he used to when he was younger and had nightmares or got cold, so, as the boy removed the sheets and climbed beside him, Harry pretended to be asleep. The now red-haired kid snug himself into his godfather’s chest and soon his breathing went steady. It was almost two in the morning and Harry was so awake that he was starting to wonder if he had had a cup of coffee without noticing… or ten.
They continued eating. Draco had a culinary orgasm with the sharlotka he had picked. It was some kind of apple cake and he supposed the blond would appreciate it, but he was actually pretty jealous of the sounds it was making him do, and that were causing havoc in the healer.
“Yes, Mr. Malfoy. What can Kreacher do for you, sir?”
Harry was toying with his necklace and rereading the letter he had received from Hermione; he had found it with a bunch of other open envelopes, most of them directed to him, but he would ask latter why were they unsealed. For now, Draco had fallen sleep in his arms, holding his mother’s letter and crying softly.
Why was Harry here and not in his own house? Why was Harry kissing his forehead? Why was he looking at him like that? With adoration and concern.
“I didn’t take that class, but I found runes pretty helpful when I started studying magical medicine. I had to get an intensive curse, but they are where most of my experiments regarding muggle and wizarding biology came from. The Black’s library has an extensive collection of healing papers that talk about the applications of runes. I’m not Hermione, but I’m competent enough” Harry answered shyly.
Harry didn’t answer immediately. He took his time to look at Draco. His eyes sweet and tender. His half smile calming the blond a bit.
“A myocardial infarction, doctor” the nurse informed him of the patient’s data as they walked to the emergency room. He saw a Surgery case passing by…it didn’t look good, but he knew barely nothing about surgery. He had picked Internal Medicine, considering it the most useful of the muggle’s specialties.
“He isn’t what?”
“Don’t push your luck, young man” he couldn’t hold the laughter much longer.
“He is not here” Regulus’ voice answered.
“Harry?”
Half an hour later, the Weasleys started to arrive, along with Hermione, Andromeda and Teddy, who was the only kid allowed as he was staying whit his godfather for the night; the rest of the youngest were at home, with their caretakers; it was too late for them at their parents’ opinion. The only ones missing were Percy, who was currently ill, and Charlie, too busy with his dragons back at Rumania.
“Oh, you mean this?” Harry lifted his arm in the air and when he lowered it he was holding a Golden Snitch.
“Oops” the elf snapped her fingers and vanished leaving a very amused Harry Potter bursting into laughter and a really embarrassed Draco Malfoy sinking in his seat and hiding his face behind his hands.
Teddy’s letter was mostly Andromeda’s letter with a drawing and a note from his godson asking him to be back soon and telling him that he missed him terribly. They were doing fine, and Harry hated himself for having to ask her for a favor, but he knew she would understand, even if it didn’t please her. She was Narcissa’s sister after all.
“It was almost midnight, and you were sleeping, but suddenly, you started convulsing and looked so frightened and disoriented and then…” he stopped, concern was written all over his face and Draco was starting to feel anxious, and particularly aware of his injuries “You talked, but it was not you, I mean, it was your voice and everything, but, you even spoke in another language”
“You had an accident with your magic in the studio, or at least that’s what you told me yesterday” the healer stood from his bed and helped him get comfortable.
“Potter, I think I would know if someone had cursed me. As hard as it should be for you to believe, I’m actually a very accomplished wizard, you know?” this time Harry’s eyes rolled back.
Wizards, like muggles, were human, and humans worked as a whole. To be considered healthy they had to be physically, mentally, emotionally, environmentally and, in the particular case of wizards, magically fine. Lucius had suffered a disruption in every single one of those aspects while he was imprisoned and his body had failed to protect him for any longer. He needed treatment, an integral, strong treatment but Harry had serious doubts he was going to receive a proper one.
, a gift someone had gave him when he moved to the apartment, in a street near to Diagon Alley, four years ago.
When the time to return was approaching they made their way back from a different direction, so they could see a couple more things before heading to the tavern where they should meet Ms. Kozlova. They were almost there when a particular construction, a white building with a lot of golden domes, grabbed their attention. It looked like another of many museums or memorials but it had something more solemn to it that the others were lacking. Harry asked an old man who told them that the place was called the Church on the Blood. He actually gave them a lot of information, glad to get a couple of strangers interested in his country’s history.
Harry tensed when a woman glanced at them for a little too long but she didn’t seem to recognize any of them; she actually looked more surprised by their joined hands than anything else. Ellias went straight to the bar after telling them to take their time to register so they made their way to the counter.
Needless to say that it killed the light mood of their date.
They said their goodbyes and his mother walked him out of the room. It didn’t take Narcissa more than eight minutes to get back. Yes, he had been counting.
He wrapped his legs around Harry’s waist and his boyfriend held him there with his hands under his butt-cheeks. He had the vaguest notion that they were moving but the only things clear in his mind were the soft hair under his palms and the hot body against his own.
“Blaise” he should have guessed it.
“Take that back, you monster!” Harry laughed “For your information, I have no problem with alcohol, it’s just too hot in here” he was lying, shamelessly, but Harry wouldn’t push. He went back to his sauce and to check the oven before entertaining himself cutting vegetables for the salad.
“Thank you, Herr Schmidt. Mr. Potter is downstairs and I’m sure he would like to speak to you” Draco said and the man nodded before leaving them alone. His mother broke then.
“Draco!” his mother shook him awake and he jumped in his chair. He had fallen asleep, it had been just a dream, as genuine as it had felt “Darling, I think you should rest for a bit”
“Don’t worry Mr. Potter, Master Draco has a guilty pleasure for strawberry lollypops, you don’t have to be ashamed”
“Well, at least now we know we were right. The next step is to find a way of talking to it” Draco’s eyes stayed glued to his, expressionless “Any suggestions?” he pushed.
“I’m certainly not!” Potter dared to laugh at him.
Harry went back to his previous position, licking and sucking Draco’s cock from the tip to the base.
“Come on, you’re going to like it. They have the best coffee and unrivaled snuggles, Teddy loves it here”
“Thank you” he went back to the hall and tried the bedroom but he wasn’t there either; nor his, nor the next one.
“Fine, I get it. You are usually this charming creature and you just pretend to be a horror with me so I don’t fall to your feet” Draco’s eyes opened for a second, but he seemed to recover fast enough.
In different circumstances Harry would have laughed of Rasputin’s face. Instead, he froze when he saw the look in his eyes. He could almost hear him thinking:
He tried to regain his breath before opening his eyes. A hand – Harry’s hand – was making circles in his back, comforting him.
“Perfect, now, try to keep your mind empty. Focus and breath, eventually you will be calm enough for me to get in” Draco opened one eye and raised the respective eye-brow at the same time Harry realized what he had just said and cleared his throat making the blond grin “Concentrate, you, asshole” Draco chuckled but did as told and started breathing evenly.
Harry was answering, his lips were moving, but he couldn’t hear him. Suddenly, everything was foggy. He closed his eyes again, and he didn’t remember opening them back.
The next time he opened his eyes he was no longer in the garden, but tucked warmly in his bed, back to his chalet. The room was dark even when the windows were open, so he guessed he had been slept for a while. Draco lit the lamp in his bedside table, noticing he was still in his pants even if the shirt had been removed, leaving the scars in his chest perfectly visible. It was three in the morning, according to his alarm clock, a present from Pansy, modified to shout his name if he didn’t wake up two minutes after it went off.
They had spent the rest of the day with her and when they had returned to Grimmauld they fell fast asleep.
By three in the afternoon they had found a bunch of books that mentioned Rasputin, but they were either in Russian or were focused on the general life. Luckily for them, Draco had come across a compilation of the most notorious wizards in Russia, and it had a full chapter dedicated to Rasputin.
“This is amazing” Harry praised getting Draco out of his thoughts’ line “I can’t remember the last time I had fish”
The dreams. Of course he had been manipulating them.
“I knew I had to wait ninety years after Alexei died, I prophesized it after all. But I was not going to wait more than that” he did remember the prophecy.
“That’s a hard one” Harry was leaned so his eyes were at the same level as the elf’s “But I think I’ll go with the cheesecake” he answered winking at Draco who was absolutely not blushed “And I would love some coffee if you don’t mind, Bibly” the elf nodded happily and disappeared only to return seconds later with the dessert and coffee for both of them.
He stayed there for a couple more minutes, absorbing the peace and quiet and thinking that maybe someday he could share his special place with someone who would appreciate it as much as he did. Draco was fine with being on his own, but loneliness hit him hard sometimes. He was getting too old for one night stands and the simple thought of going out to a bar or a party to find someone, flirt, get to know them…it was enough to make him feel tired.
“What did you find?” he asked finally and Draco opened the too-many-Gs-in-the-title book in a marked page and offered it to Harry, who grabbed it and made his way next to the other wizard.
“I didn’t open the letters”
“Yes, they were. Something had to be good among so much destruction and darkness” maybe it wasn’t intentional, but Draco felt like, somehow, the red-haired was accusing him. He had every right to not like him, but he had made peace with his past and the Gryffindor was not going to take that away from him, nor make him feel guilty at all. He had been a boy, a scared boy, and had done what he had to do to keep his family and himself safe.
“What?” he had understood him but that was certainly not what Harry expected to hear from his distressed boyfriend as soon as he woke up.
“What about Rasputin?”
“It is still my country” he went back to the bed but left the curtains opened, so the light filtered inside the room “Why were you holding him when I took over? He felt too happy to be a bad thing” Harry panicked, again. He was not ready to explain his relationship with Draco to a boy that had lived almost a hundred years ago and that was currently in his boyfriend’s body.
“Get in with me” he asked “Please” he added as if it was necessary to plead Harry, who was more than happy to oblige his every wish. He took off his clothes, doubting if it was appropriate to take off his underwear too, but Draco took the decision for him and turned to do it himself. He got in and they positioned with Draco between his legs, his back against Harry’s chest and his head resting on his boyfriend’s shoulder.
Death finally moved and the circle disappeared, allowing Alexander to approach them.
“Oh, nothing, I was just going to check if we have everything for dinner” Kreacher tensed up.
“Well, maybe not the best but definitely the most practical one, we can use the GPS to go around the city and it has a camera, so you can take as many pictures as you want”
After the war, Harry had a bad time dealing with the aftermath. He could barely see his own friends without remembering the ones that were no longer with them, the casualties were too many and he had blamed himself for that for a long time. On top of it, he had to see his face in every single paper and hear his name everywhere, a constant reminder of the final battle; everybody said he was a hero, but it didn’t feel like that to him. He was supposed to be happy because it was finally over, but it seemed wrong, too high of a price to pay for peace. So, he kept himself away of the wizarding community, at least partially. He started studding muggle medicine (as soon as Kingsley got him the documents to enter a muggle university), thinking that it was something he could do to help in both worlds as there were no healers with a profound knowledge of the muggle diseases or treatments, which he considered way more advanced than the magical ones. He was surprisingly good at it, so he graduated quite quickly and took the basic education to become a healer, specializing himself in combined therapy; he took the idea behind the muggle treatments and applied them to wizarding biology. Soon enough he became famous, but this time it was because of his achievements in the medical field and not for surviving to some lunatic killing his parents.
“I know this will sound weird, but I was thinking about babies” he blurted out. Harry looked momentarily confused but then chuckled.
“My soul?” he asked, his expression a little confused.
“Your mother contacted me. She wanted to see if I could help you since it seems to be difficult for regular healers to treat you. I suppose she was actually desperate if she called me” Draco rose one of his eyebrows at the obvious comment.
“Harry, are you awake?”
“How is he doing?” he was curious, he had always been, but he could not present himself to his aunt’s house and ask to meet the kid, could he?
Was that possible? Wasn’t she dead?
Once he got rid of his pants he sat back in the bed and looked at anything but Potter as he started a series of diagnostic spells he was already familiar with. Draco noticed he didn’t ask for a blood sample but he was no one to question the procedure, so he didn’t say a word. It took Potter almost ten minutes to finish and when he did, and Draco finally met his gaze, he knew something was off. He had already told him everything, since the first day he started feeling poorly, excluding his thoughts of not feeling like himself, of course; he didn’t need anyone else telling him he was crazy and, particularly, not Potter. He had granted him access to his medical records and he would speak with the previous healers after seeing him, but it seemed that he was actually pretty sure about the results of the examination, and he obviously didn’t like it.
“It was” Draco answered and held Harry’s hand “But I am a little stubborn, you know? I decided I would like to earn that future by myself” Harry had no idea what had happened but he had the feeling it had something to do with him and that made him melt.
He was almost done with spells and potions when he noticed a bruise in Draco’s arm, where he had hold him last night to keep him from hurting himself during the seizure. That brought back the theories about his condition. He was not sure about the procedure in cases like that, that’s why he needed Herm, but he knew that they had to start with information. The had to know who was inside Draco and why, but that was easy to say.
“Of course we do. Kreacher keeps everything perfectly stocked”
“Night, Harry”
“We are in my friend’s house, in Marseille, France” he answered calmly, and trying to provide him with enough information. Draco’s face twisted in confusion and panic.
“Not at all” he whispered and left a kiss in Draco’s forehead “Let’s get some rest, okay?” the blond nodded and Harry went to take off his trousers and drew the curtains close. When he went back to bed, Draco was completely naked under the sheets and Harry had to make use of every bit of his self-control not to jump over him right away.
“Shall we go into the main house then?” Draco asked and when they all agreed Narcissa led the way while talking to Herm about something.
“You do not look old enough to know him personally, my friend. How can you be so certain?”
“Don’t you
section, but I’m sure you will find everything to your liking” he passed them a couple papers to sign and a golden coin with a number on it “Room 386. All services are at your disposal at all moments, you will find any information you need on the flayers in your room, I personally recommend the spa. We hope you enjoy our hotel and welcome to Russia”
“Welcome home, master Potter” Kreacher was with him in seconds, announcing that breakfast was ready and the mail had just arrived.
“Oh, such a sweet boy” she turned to Narcissa and everyone froze. The fireplace activated again and Luna showed up with one of the twins in her arms, followed by her husband and his other son.
“Thanks, mate. I hope is a boy this time” he confessed. Ron loved his daughter, but he was crazy about the idea of having a son. He claimed that Rose favored her mother way too much, and that he needed someone to team up against them.
“Busy night, I see. I thought you were going to sleep when we parted in the hall”
“Let’s go make some then” he suggested with a wink and Draco let himself be taken home.
Like everything in his life, he had made changes to it; he had got rid of the sidecar and adjust it so it would shrink and still be fully useful since he had no garage for it thanks to the architecture of Grimmauld Place. But it was not just the journey that he had enjoyed. Having Draco’s arms wrapped around his abdomen, his chest against his back, the blonde’s hair smelling like him, wearing one of his sweaters, it was proving to be way more satisfactory than Harry could have imagined.
“I thought we were walking there, or apparating or something wizarding-worthy” he said even while making his way to Harry and accommodating himself behind the brunet.
“About time” Draco snorted pretending he was not impressed, but he was actually deeply relieved; with that he could go back to his normal life again.
Holly, phoenix feather core, eleven inches, nice and supple. It felt like Harry and it loved its master. It had always fought hard to protect him.
“I don’t think so” this would have been a perfect moment to have Ellias around “We just arrived from England, but maybe our friend had something booked for us” the man waved his wand and checked a stack of papers without even looking.
“Earwax is not a good match to carrots, definitely”
“Yes Kreacher, something light, please. I’ll shower first, so take your time” he kneeled in front of the fire, where Hermione’s face awaited.
“What are you doing here?” he guided Potter to his wardrobe and put on only his underwear; he was covered in wounds, and he needed to keep them accessible for his healer.
He found a candle and as soon as he touched it, the wick lit itself. He could hear water dropping in the distance but that was it. He had to start walking, he needed to find the library.
Harry moved around the place, his mind running wild, trying to remember everything he had ever read on possession and soul containment. The Horrocrux’s principle was to rip the soul trough murder and store the fragment into an object or living being; it was an excruciating process. That was not an option since it was not Draco’s soul the one he needed to separate, but he could use the idea of a receptacle. Maybe, if he could transfer the foreign piece somewhere else, he could get rid of it and stop the side effects on Draco… or maybe not.
“What happened?” his voice cracked and Potter handed him a glass of water from the nightstand.
Draco kept his word and by midday was writing to Miss Ebranati to notify that her wand was ready for her to try it; he struggled a bit with his Italian, but it was surely because it had become rusty surrounded by French all the time. Sealing the envelope, he attached it to his owl’s leg and opened the window, breathing the fresh air. His workshop was placed in a sort of guest house, magically enlarged and reformed to his needs. There was even a basement where he kept the materials and, unlike the main house, a chimney, exclusively for his clients, as he didn’t receive many other visitors.
“Alexei” and with that he apparated.
“Oh, yes. There is a statue, just outside the church” he answered enthusiastically “That was a sad day for this country. A dark one, but war has always brought terrible mistakes. Have a nice day, gentlemen”
“Yeah, but that didn’t last much. I love her, but she is like a sister to me, so, weird” he shuddered and Draco smiled without hiding his satisfaction “I have dated people, but nothing too serious. I’m either the unreachable doctor or the damned boy-who-lived”
“Harry, make him stop” he shouted again. He was holding his arms to roughly but no matter how much Harry tried he wouldn’t let go; he was going to get hurt.
“We read about the school’s library. It could be helpful if we could study the texts there” Harry added, sounding surer than he would have thought. She didn’t look convinced, but seemed to trust them.
“I know. Maybe we should go to sleep and hope to find something in the bookshop tomorrow” Draco had hidden his blush as best as he had been able to. It had been a sort of unspoken agreement that he would spent the night at Grimmauld with Harry, and it had made him feel…weird. It was the logical decision since none of them would go back to France that late at night, but it had still felt too personal, too homie.
“For fuck’s sake, Harry, take this damn thing off” Harry laughed softly and did as told doing the same with his trousers and Draco’s pajamas.
“I had a dream before waking up” he said instead “I think it has something to do with Alexei, but it makes no sense”
“Yes. I was the one who gave Alix and Nicky their long wanted son”
He wasn’t going to read Hermione’s but he opened his mother’s letter as quickly as he could and read the content anxiously.
As soon as Draco awaked he would write to a German colleague who would, hopefully, be willing to help while they were in Russia. Harry would personally treat Lucius once they were back but he was not sure either of them could change the picture too much; anyway, he had to try.
“I know. But I would recognize you anywhere” Harry was starting to think he had a very malleable mind. He was too easy to manipulate. He wanted to say something, reveal the truth, but he advised himself against it; he focused instead in Draco’s steady pulse under his fingertips, the movement of his chest.
It was Death.
“This is charming but, unfortunately, I have more important things to do. I would love to leave you two to catch up, but the clock is ticking” Rasputin voice broke the moment and snapped Harry back to reality. He had seen the man send a spell in his direction. What had happened?
“My godfather died when he fell inside the one in the Ministry” Harry was certain of that. He would not fall for Death lies. He couldn’t get his hopes up and see them being destroyed again when he found out the truth.
“Sorry. We are late, I know. An egg moved and we had to stay for at least half an hour to see if it would hatch” Charlie said as he kissed his pregnant sister-in-law and proceeded to do the same with everyone else present. Ion, his husband went straight to Draco.
“Is that supposed to make me feel bad?” that was it. Harry gripped his wand and pointed it towards the other wizard. Rasputin’s smirk disappeared and he raised his arms.
“I guess I’ll be seeing Granger too” he had to keep his mind off the moment.
“Well, I’m not you mother, but I think we can do something decent before everyone else arrives” he rolled up his sleeves and asked George to clean up while he reviewed the recipe and started working.
“Maybe” Harry said “I should go to the library and try again to find something about that damn man, but I don’t want to leave you alone” Draco smiled at his concern.
“What?”
“How can you be so cynical? Do you have any idea how many people you have hurt?”
“I knew you were trouble, Potter. I should not have let you come here” he said “How did you find this place?” he tried to approach them but the fire circle rejected him. It didn’t hurt him, probably because he didn’t enter, but it sent him flying away. He composed quickly enough.
Perfect. He had an exceptionally annoying disease, he ached everywhere and was covered in bruises, having stupid, creepy dreams; his healer was no other than Harry-Sodding-Potter, who used to be his archenemy and who was apparently charring confidences with his mother. Life was, indeed, full of surprises, Draco found himself missing the time when his biggest problem was not finding a decent supplier of unicorn hair.
“No reason. I’ll see you later” and he was gone.
“It’s a perfectly reasonable treat and a very popular one, for your information” he adjusted his glasses and pretended to be offended.
“Have you thought about having kids, Draco?” he choked on his drink at Luna’s sudden question.
“Yes, so to speak” he was a little bit less tense without Harry there, but he suspected the man was smoking somewhere and he didn’t like that he was the cause.
“Except for the part of me being deadly sick. Good to know”
He waited for Harry to come back while revising the parchments left behind by them. Some were discarded in a pile with a red cross, others had been adjusted with a darker ink and others remained untouched, he was extremely concentrated in absorbing as much as he could. He understood most of it, except for the bits regarding pure healing magic.
He would never have to come alone to that field again. He finally had a special someone to share his life with and he couldn’t be happier.
Harry went through the content of every missive mentally before relaxing when he realized that no one had touched the topic, miraculously, as everyone had been focused on bigger news.
“What’s what?”
They had arranged to meet the next morning at Draco’s place and go over the idea, though he hadn’t expected Hermione’s husband to come along.
Mom, dad, Olga, Tatiana, Maria, Anastasia…
“Is Anastasia all right? I saw her. When they shot at us…she was fine. Where is she?” he had stood up and was holding Harry’s shoulders, shaking him violently. The name Anastasia was as common as the next one, so it did not helped Harry to give a better answer.
“I wouldn’t have taken it, Mrs. Malfoy, I did have to keep an eye on Draco”
“Is there something in this world that hasn’t happened to you? You have like, the worst luck ever, you know?” Harry obviously didn’t want to laugh, but he did anyway.
“Is not like my mother would let out of bed any time soon” Draco hadn’t planned on saying that out loud, Harry was certain of that, so he blushed hard before clearing his throat “Would that be all?”
Death moved, Draco fell to the floor like a puppet whose strings had been cut.
He was starting to get a headache.
“Okay, I have an idea, and you are not going to like it, so I’m already informing you that I don’t give a fuck, I’m doing it anyway”
“Bibly has made three different desserts, sir, but she has no idea which one to bring” Draco smiled fondly. These were the kind of problems he used to face when his life was not turned upside down. He missed that.
“Draco, can you hear me?” the other man screamed in response, he was barely conscious “Narcissa, I need you to get some towels and water” he didn’t need them, but the witch would never leave his son side willingly and he had to concentrate. She seemed to understand and ran to get what he asked, even when she could have asked an elf, or summoned it with magic.
“Are you feeling any better?” he asked while caressing his thighs softly. That was far from being a sexual moment but it was a deeply intimate one and, circumstances aside, Harry was enjoying it; like he did every time he had the chance of touching that pale skin, trace his scars and detail his entire body. Draco nodded but he knew he was answering just to avoid worrying him so he offered some comfort while stroking his hair “I will write to a friend that I think can help him for now” Draco turned, making some of the water fall out of the tub.
“You don’t need to be afraid. I’m not going to hurt you. I’m a doctor. The body you are using is my patient’s. I would never do anything to hurt him, and therefore, you” he took another step “Can you come here? We can talk until you calm down. I promise I will try to tell you everything you want as long as I know the answer” he held his hand and waited patiently. The man looked at him for a while, probably guessing if he could trust Harry.
“I will, Narcissa. No need to worry” he had looked at Draco hungrily “I won’t take my eyes off him” the other wizard had returned his look with red cheeks and Narcissa had raised an eyebrow.
For now, Harry had to go a step ahead and find a way to communicate with Alexei, if that was even his name, so displaying all of his books and notes on the desk of his current room he started planning. He had Hermione’s ideas on a piece of parchment and was trusting he could make some progress; god knew Draco needed hope and he was determined to give it to him.
With a twist of his wand he discovered he had five minutes to get to Narcissa’s house, so he focused and twirling in the spot he apparated straight in the garden, receiving a reproach from his mother, stating he was too weak to do that kind of magic.
“No, Potter, I haven’t, not since the war. Why?” Harry didn’t know exactly why; it was merely a feeling. Draco’s most probable diagnosis was perhaps the strangest thing he had seen in his professional life. He didn’t need to take blood to run tests on it, not since he could magically detect the level of most components, but he was starting to think he had made a mistake. The dark-haired wizard gave his wand another twist and white, smoky numbers floated over Draco’s body. No, he wasn’t wrong, it just didn’t make sense.
“You should be nicer. I just saw you soul, Draco. It’s so pretty I can’t believe it belongs to you” Harry was still recovering and his nerves were on edge, it had been a difficult spell “The other one was there too, and I can tell you it is not supposed to be, the spell rejected it immediately” or vice versa, he wasn’t sure.
“Yeah, me neither” they both stayed in silence for a moment. They knew there was nothing they could do to help Alexei, he was dead, and most probably his family too. What could he need to rest? Why was he still around? How was that possible without magic? They had to keep searching, but they were not going to find anything in any wizarding library. The Romanovs were muggles, after all. Royalty or not “I think we should keep looking around in your library. It’s improbable, but maybe there’s something else”
Being Potter’s patient wasn’t as bad as Draco had initially thought it would be. The Gryffindor was actually pretty good at his job; Draco didn’t feel half as bad as he had at the beginning. His mother wouldn’t let him move more than necessary yet, but he did feel better. Books were piled up around him and at least twenty work-related letters were waiting to be read. He had already alerted his clients that he was ill so the orders would be delayed a couple weeks. Luckily for him all the wands for immediate educational purposes were done before he got sick.
The stair’s wall was the only one that looked out of place and at the same time was the one that felt more like Harry. Draco guessed that, at some point, something had been there, hanging on the deep green painted surface, something entirely different from the current decoration. There were small frames, with pictures, instead of portraits, in them; one with Harry and the whole Weasley family, one with his two best friends and their baby daughter, a couple of him with a three years old boy and the same kid, who he assumed was Teddy Lupin, a bit older, flying on a broom with Harry, a picture of Sirius Black, Remus Lupin and James Potter laughing, one of Lovegood’s wedding day, probably, and the last one of his parents, young and loving to each other. It was a beautiful display and Draco found himself absorbing this new side of Harry’s life, the one that treasured his family and friends that way. Well, he had always been like that, but Draco haven’t had the chance to see it away from Weasley and Granger.
“Come on, before he says something worse”
“I’m all right, mom and I need to finish a couple things today since I haven’t been working in almost a week” he adjusted a lock that had escaped the bun and went back to carve the hornbeam wand in his hands. He liked this wand, he was working with the materials provided by the client, which was uncommon, but the man had claimed that a phoenix had took him to that specific tree and left him a feather. Draco was no one to doubt the wizard so he took the wood and the core and started working, hopping he could make a very special wand for his client.
. At first he had forgotten it, he had been too worried about Draco to think about anything else, and then Alexander had asked him not to take it to the Prophecies’ Room since it was heavily protected against all kind of spells and he could get caught with a simple
When they were done with the main course Bibly popped with a concern look.
“Not so far” Draco knew he meant the medicine, but, for some reason, he considered telling him something about his dreams. Potter had been nothing but professional so far and maybe he could provide a logical explanation or at least discard a psychological trauma. He was hesitant, he did not want the other wizard to think he was crazy “Can I ask you something?” Potter looked surprised and he couldn’t blame him; Draco had not been particularly communicative with him so far.
“Draco Malfoy! What are you doing down here?! Go back to bed! For Morgana, what have I done to deserve this?”
“Muggles need to date more” Harry laughed again and pulled him up for a kiss that he received happily.
Draco saw a box, a different one, among the other. He knew that box contained something important. He had no idea how, but he did.
The fire turned green one more time and George stepped out of the chimney holding his niece, Dominique. Seconds later Fleur came through with Victoire and Bill followed her carrying Louis.
“I don’t doubt that, Malfoy, I’m merely trying to understand why on earth you have a disorder like that. I already checked your magical core and there’s nothing wrong with it, even when dark magic is frequently attached there but there has to be an explanation” the blonde seemed skeptical and annoyed.
“I’m flattered, Harry, but the merit is on you on this one. I’ve never seen you so passionate and dedicated to anything before” she seemed to realize something and her look fell on Draco “Actually…” Harry’s hand was covering her mouth. It intrigued the blond even more, but he saved his curiosity for later.
“I agree” he was suspiciously blushed.
They were going to be fine.
“Not personally, of course, but he was the main reason to make limitations in Koldovstoretz’s magical specialties”
“Don’t worry. You’ll compensate me with a second first date” he kissed him again and stood up before gathering his stuff “I’m not stopping until it turns out perfect” he waved goodbye and Draco smiled. It had been perfect. Every moment with him was perfect.
“We can’t allow that” he kissed Draco deeply and roughly. He only restrained himself from biting too hard for obvious reasons “We have to wait until Monday, though. The school won’t have us any sooner”
“I won’t have you bleeding unnecessarily, we are staying somewhere else. Thanks, Mr. Loughty” the unspeakable opened his eyes and reached for them before they could turn.
“I’ll be fine. I can’t be completely okay if I don’t know what’s happening to me” Harry thought about it for a minute, but finally surrendered.
“Oh, cut the crap, Harry. Everyone knows Gryffindors have no tact”
“Hey, Harry. I called you earlier in the morning but Kreacher told me you were with a patient”
“What have you done to that poor tart?” a deflated, blackish sponge cake rested on top of the table where a weird looking cream whipped itself.
The smell of coffee reached him on his way down the stairs but he was received by way more than that. Pancakes with blueberry sauce, chocolate, orange juice, black tea and a perfectly cut green apple among other fruits. Draco couldn’t hide a smile.
Draco had seen Harry naked before, of course he had, but that didn’t prevent him from admiring him. He took in his sun kissed skin, his muscles, flexing from the slightest movement to accommodate them better on the bed, the thin line of hair that went down his navel and disappeared in the bush of black curls on the base on his hard member. His mouth watered at the mere thought of having all of that just for him.
“Kreacher! It’s been so long. How are you?”
“It’s a boy” he murmured.
“Draco, please, tell me what’s happening. Let me help you” Draco let out a cry of obvious pain and grabbed his sides, pulling down towards the floor. Harry let him kneel softly on the stone surface. They were attracting to much attention; someone was even calling an ambulance.
He wanted to be angry, he really did, but he couldn’t remember how.
“I forgot to take care of your cut this afternoon. Let’s go to the studio and then we can keep going on with the research” Draco blinked, confused, and it took him a moment to react and answer before following him upstairs.
He tried once more, this time his eyes were closed and he avoided unnecessary thoughts. A tanned, green-eyed figure pushing them away. Harry was going to be there if anything happened...
“I was worried, you, ungrateful monster. You are just nice to Hermione” he sounded hurt, but Draco knew it was joking and chuckled.
“Only if he chooses to” Death must have seen the confusion on his face because it elaborated the last statement “These veils exist to connect the two worlds, Harry. They make my job easier, but they can’t kill anyone, not on their own”
“Come on, what are you waiting for?” Draco was standing still, looking without blinking at the scene in front of him. That was just too much. Harry-Bloody-Potter, a damn hot piece of trouble, riding a bike and he was just supposed to keep living after that. Not fair.
“No” he answered when he found his voice. The room was dark, but Draco knew it was not nighttime yet “Can you open the curtains?” the hand never left his head, but the light came through the windows instantly. Draco looked beside him founding Harry’s eyes, stained with concern. They were still in the guestroom; apparently, he had fallen asleep while being healed. There was a chair next to the bed, so he guessed Harry had stayed by his side.
I changed Anastasia's situation a little bit. She was considered to have survived for a long time anyway, I just played with the dates.
oy, but it was not. He leaned against a wall to catch his breath after running a second time around the whole floor. Maybe he had gone back to the room, maybe he was in a different floor, maybe he had just gone to the garden for a stroll, maybe, maybe, maybe.
“It’s bloody perfect!” he took another bite and groaned this time “God! I could get used to this”
Dumbledore’s wand.
“Indeed I do” he threw the paper away and pulled Harry by the shirt “Who’s going to kiss me if you are not around? I would hate being forced to ask a random Russian to do it for you” Harry knew he was joking, and provoking him, but he had said it last night, he was possessive. He let out a growl that made Draco hold his breath.
“I’ll be back soon. Call me if you need anything” he was about to go, but stopped in the door “Do you happen to have a cellphone?”
When they broke apart, Draco was still smiling and had a funny glitter on his eyes, that was quickly substituted by surprise and something like fear.
“I’m fine mom, in perfect shape. How’s father?” he asked.
“My pleasure, Draco, please, send her my regards. She was my favorite cousin” Draco nodded and left the room. Harry was waiting for him, but vigorously avoiding his look.
He missed Draco, he had hated to leave him like that and he hated even more the idea of not telling him about what had happened, but it had been necessary and it was worth it. He had some new information that could help them. He knew there was a way of aiding Alexei or at least there must be, according to the prophecy, but nothing was for certain. He still had no idea what it meant; a dragon’s decadence could be extrapolated to Draco, of course, but maybe it was too literal to be that and it didn’t work that way. Then there was the part about help, death and love in the same sentence and that was not only disturbing, it also could not be a good sign and, finally, time, something they definitely didn’t have and calm, another lacking feeling these days.
It could be Draco coming back, it had to be.
Something was trying to come out, desperately. Harry grabbed the stone around his neck again. It had never worked since that time at the woods but it gave him a bit of comfort, a bit of hope.
“Oh, for god’s sakes Ronald, it just Harry”
“I love it! Thank you, Harry” he looked like a little kid who had received exactly want he had asked for Christmas, and even when Harry imagined that his boyfriend had always got his every wish it still made him happy and he ended up smiling like an idiot when Draco kissed his cheek.
Draco crawled back slowly until he reached the head of the bed, sitting as far from the intruder as possible. It hurt, every little movement was agony, but it didn’t matter, there must had been an explanation for this and that was far more important.
“Yeah, that would be awesome” they stood up and without planning they both started picking up Harry’s mess from the floor. The notes he had made were all over the room.
“I did, but I happen to care about myself first, and I knew I had no future in my time. I just used my connection to his soul to buy me some time” he said calmly.
Someone stepped out of it.
“It’s fine Mrs. Malfoy, I’m used to thick-headed men” she said laughing while pointing Harry.
“He was in so much pain, Harry” he whispered “I was…conscious, I heard, or something like that, the entire conversation. When he started thinking about his family, remembering his death…it was so heartbreaking” he wiped his tears “He’s just a boy”
“Exactly, I accept cards and flowers from tomorrow on” he joked and Harry smiled while shaking his head.
“Kids, children, babies, offspring, hatchlings…”
“A nourishing potion with some supplements added” Harry was already performing spells and had his attention on the task so he didn’t see him making a disgusted grimace.
“Dr. Potter, please, there is an ambulance arriving” the voice of the nurse brought him back from his slumber quickly and, grabbing his glasses from the side of the pillow, he stood up.
“I hope it still does. Darkness is always around, and joy is most needed even in the brightest of days” he answered, as dispassionately as he could, before heading towards the victoriously smiling duo that was calling for him.
Exhale… At least he was not crying this time.
“I don’t know, Draco, I haven’t been even near that thing in my entire life, what makes you think I know how it works?” he walked to the little table where it was ringing and picked the handset.
They stayed there for a while; Harry kept the temperature warm with his magic and Draco left him clean and tend to his body while he relaxed.
“I was going to look for a couple books back at home, but…well, I needed to be sure you were okay” he was slightly blushed, and Draco felt his chest fill warmly.
“At least Rasputin didn’t predict anything about you” Draco offered.
“Yes…where is my family?” he had tears in his eyes, in Draco’s eyes. Harry held his breath at the sight.
“Good night, Gin” and with that he disappeared into the flames.
“Oh, my. What kind of spell have you put on me?” he joked dramatically and Harry laughed.
It was a lot to take in and he knew Malfoy would need time to adjust himself to the idea. As soon as the man agreed, he would perform the analysis of his soul, and they would know if the theory was correct or not. From then on it was a matter of trial and error.
“Yes, they received the money from the bank yesterday as you scheduled. I have told you a thousand times that I can pay a part of it, I know is not cheap” she offered but he shook his head in response.
“It looks like he made his choice” Death shifted in the air until it was floating behind Harry making the hair on his nape stand on end.
A couple arms surround him from the back and he smiled, putting the cigarette back in the box.
Harry thought about the risks and Alexei and Draco. The memories of his boyfriend’s wounded body, his eyes red from all the crying and his agony screams back at the church were enough to bring back his Gryffindor recklessness and make him accept the deal with little hesitation.
Blaise had told him something about the savior becoming a sort of healer, but the bastard didn’t give him details, or mention anything about the Gryffindor being hot all of the sudden.
“Yes, I was with Malfoy”
“But there is nothing to be hated, and if he had been more open-minded he could have seen that. I’m still sorry” he did look ashamed. He tended to take things too much to heart.
If Lily was Harry’s kryptonite, he was Draco’s.
that was Ron’s voice in the back.
The headmaster was pointing his wand at Harry. Completely ignoring Rasputin.
“Hermione and I agree that the most obvious way is to satisfy what could be keeping him from going to wherever muggles go after they die. I just hope is as simple as that”
“Scared, Malfoy? I didn’t have you for a softy”
“1918 of course” oh, God…
They had arranged a late lunch. That way everyone could bring the kids. Kids were crucial that day.
“How are you feeling, darling?” she asked, but Draco ignored her completely as his focus was on the dark-haired wizard.
He stood up and cleaned the dishes before heading back to his bedroom to change and get ready. He had to gather new supplies from his cabinet and go back to Malfoy’s house, so he went to his studio and drinking a couple potions himself, he refilled the case with vials and bandages and grabbed some more books to keep researching while taking care of Draco. Once ready he secured the house and apparated away.
“Why didn’t you wake me?” he asked sitting at the table and pouring some tea on his cup.
“I don’t think I have ever heard anything about such thing” Draco stated hesitant; he seemed to believe them, but Harry admitted it was hard to swallow.
“Mom, ask the elves to prepare a nice lunch. We are having guests”
“Alexei, don’t run, son” he rolled his eyes and kept running. He caught Maria just before she touched the marble edge where they had started the game.
“I don’t know, I already told you. I can try and find out, but you need to calm down” he took Draco’s wrists in his hands. The cloth he was supposed to be holding had dropped to the floor along with the blanket “This…we are in 2008…it’s been ninety years since then.  There’s nothing you can do for them, but if you give me the details I can try to find some answers” the boy started crying, desperately, screaming and fighting for air. Harry didn’t know what to do, so he let him.
Draco didn’t need anything else. He threw himself over Harry and kissed him. Words were no longer an issue. Draco was happy, too happy, too excited, a bit scared, a bit overwhelmed.
“I will explain it later, but the point is, Herm approves, and that’s reassuring enough”
Hadn’t she been by his side just now? He shrugged.
“What do you mean?”
He arrived to George’s flat earlier than everyone else. The red-haired opened the door welcoming him with a pink apron with white letters that read
“Yes, it was normal”
“I told you how I felt when Voldemort’s soul started to manifest itself. The symptoms I had are very similar to yours now and there is the event from two nights ago”
“Ugh, not the toilets again, please” Harry murmured. He hated to enter the ministry that way and he hated that it was the same here. Draco looked confused “You have never use that entrance?”
He was laying on the floor, drowning in his own blood. Grigori was beside him.
He took her to every floor and back. He stopped in front of Harry’s studio. The door was open.
“How is Mr. Malfoy?” Alexander asked as soon as Harry approached his desk in the empty library the next afternoon.
“Good. Are you done or do you need more time?” Draco checked his notes and then the book on his hands.
When they landed, and the blond managed to recover from the nauseous feeling due to the lack of recent practice, Draco noticed they were in a sort of hall, simply decorated, but with a powerful aura. He felt somehow welcomed and he attributed it to the Black part of his blood.
“I thought the meeting with Granger would take more time, so I asked them to prepare a nice lunch, since I don’t know your preferences. Suit yourself” he motioned to one of the chairs and Harry sat on it.
“Mom!” Draco’s jaw fell open and Narcissa smiled, amused “You are a mean woman, Mrs. Malfoy”
“Regulus, have you seen Harry?” he asked to the portrait in the studio.
The air was cold and there was a thin layer of frost covering the street they had landed in. The place was deserted, except for a man in heavy clothes that was waving at them.
“Draco! Draco, can you hear me?” the other wizard’s eyes were now looking frantically around the room, panic written in every feature “Draco, come on, look at me, it’s okay, you’re going to be fine” the gray irises stopped in him, Harry felt like the other man didn’t recognize him, he seemed scared, and disoriented “Draco…”
What was happening? He had been in Harry’s house just seconds ago.
Draco’s mind had another moment of brightness, this time to make him realize that they were both extremely dressed. Immediately, he moved his hands away from Harry’s hair and went all the way down his arms and then his hip, where he found the hem of his shirt and pulled it, accomplishing little to nothing to remove it.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m lost” he admitted after looking at them blankly for a moment. Hermione was about to explain it again, but Harry stopped her. Draco was his patient and, honestly, she was not always the easiest person to understand.
What?
As the bright red light touched him, the runes started to move around his neck, they felt hot and before Draco could register what was happening, a sharp pain stabbed him in the middle of the chest. He hissed, and grabbed the sheets to control himself, but he couldn’t help the cry that came from his deep throat. His eyes were shut, the warm from the letters extended down his chest and as soon as it had started, the pain stopped, leaving him panting and sweating.
“Yes?”
He knew it before his eyes could see it. His wand was there, it was close. It shouldn’t be, but it was. He could feel his magic pulsing frantic by its presence. A broom’s cabinet? Why would it be there?
” he voiced, and after a second, or maybe two, the door clicked and opened like it had never been closed.
“It’s okay. I don’t expect anyone to believe I have changed or anything, and I don’t blame him for hating me”
“That makes no sense. I haven’t broken anything”
“October?” he gave him a confused look.
“You shouldn’t have gone through so much trouble just for me wanting to cut my hair, love” Draco said as he rubbed some more oil on his shoulder.
“That’s a bit harsh. We are just going to investigate, find a way to help Alexei, so I can finally get my soul back. It’s not that dangerous” Harry’s sardonic laugh made him tense.
“I’ve seen you tired before, Draco, you have never fainted” he looked at his mother with tenderness and kissed her hands after sitting beside her in the kitchen table.
“Come on now. You wouldn’t attack a disarmed man, would you?” he was right. That was against his principles.
A knock on his door distracted him from his thoughts, luckily. Seconds later, his mother popped in.
It was past noon when Draco knocked on Harry’s door.
A wand. All of this for a wand.
“Oh, he didn’t, it was his mother”
“I am afraid I do not know what you mean” Harry felt Death moving and Rasputin’s eyes went straight to it while he grabbed the cross hanging from his neck “Oh, you mean that” he smiled “To help him, of course” Harry was starting to like Death. He would choose it over that sadist any time.
“Fucking hypocrite” he murmured and threw the book into the pile taking a new one:
They had not talked much after that, but the agitation hadn’t left him. He wasn’t used to see Malfoy so vulnerable, even while being sick he was annoyingly proud, always defensive and careful, and then…
Harry put some cream on the side of the bowl and took a fruit, taking it to his mouth after dipping it. His eyes were fixed on the wall in front of him, where there was a shelve with jars full of candies, all Teddy’s favorites. Draco didn’t move for a while, only reaching for a strawberry when Harry got his second one. Their looks connected and Harry bit the red fruit without taking his eyes from Draco’s gray ones.
“And this chair gets stuck everywhere” Lucius added. He had made quite a recovery. Harry had used some of his especial medicine and in just a month Lucius was back on his feet…well, so to speak. He could not make any effort, so he was on the chair most of the time. But he was alive, and that was more than enough for Draco “And your mother has to push it harder” he had been told many times that Draco was his son and he had just assumed it was true, but he didn’t remember having a son. He was still a little out of himself, but they had never expected that to get better.
“Damn, Draco. You are so beautiful” Harry hissed all of the sudden and Draco’s heart missed a beat. He had been told that many times and he knew he was a handsome man, but it somehow felt different coming from Harry. Like everything, so far. He was confident about his looking, but he felt like he needed Harry to tell him so, to look at him like that.
“Will it hurt?” he asked in a low voice and the healer gave him a grin.
“Sur…”  Draco didn’t need more than that. He threw his arms around Harry’s neck and kissed him passionately. Harry’s hands, now in his hips, pressed him against his body even more and Draco melted right there.
“Save me the talk for latter, Kings” Harry handed the sock over to the man and grabbed Draco’s hand “We’ll take your office’s chimney, thank you” Harry hurried towards the door and Draco managed to see the minister smiling and shaking his head in denial, like he knew Harry had a malfunction way beyond repair and had given up with him a long time ago.
“We’ll figure this out. I promise” he kissed him and they both let the heat do its work.
The veil moved again. Harry’s heart stopped. He saw the shape of a person getting clearer and clearer as it approached the veil.
Tomorrow I'll be posting the last six chapters and I hope you keep loving this story. Thank you all for your support.
Once in bed he reached for a book and opened it in a chapter about the magical properties of the doxy’s hair and started reading. Again, he must have been really fatigued, because he could barely understand what his eyes were looking at, as if it was written in ancient Greek. Giving up, he called it a night and turning of the lamp he fell in a peaceful sleep.
Draco had waited for him in the living room, obviously planning to kill him since he was wearing one of Harry’s shirts, unbuttoned. He had not missed Draco’s attempts to provoke him to go further from kisses. They were grown up men and they liked each other a lot, of course, but Harry was not risking hurting Draco. He was still sick and he was violating the patient-healer relationship enough already.
“Do you need something?” he denied again. He felt Harry’s arms surrounding him and his body laying on the bed. Harry was stroking his back and kissing his head, he was comforting him.
“Bibly told me, so don’t you dare to lie to me, Draco Malfoy” her stern tone made him feel bad, so he chose to move on from that conversation and changed the topic.
“I did” he lied “This is my normal face” Blaise laughed at that, since it was obviously a joke.
“Aren’t you good with alcohol? You are turning a very lovely Gryffindor-red” the blond gasped.
“Life is not even a thing, Harry. Life is a concept. I am real, I am the one standing in front of your eyes and you can’t just resign to me. Even if you could, you would just go to be tested yourself, there is no point on taking that risk. Your friend’s soul is not even important to me. I don’t care if it goes or stays here, I just need the boy’s soul” Alexei’s soul.
He tried to open his eyes again, doing it more softly this time, until he got used to the light. He was alone in the fluffy bed, but he could hear movement in the bathroom. He stood up and stretched his limbs, numb from the time he must have been unconscious before walking towards the open door of the bathroom.
“Ok, I’ll find something
Harry was kissing him.
He tried the library, but he was not there either. Draco was starting to suspect he had just apparated somewhere outside of the house but he wanted to doubt that he had left him alone without warning.
“I do not expect you have heard of Soul Magic” he answered condescendingly.
Harry wasn’t deeply sleep, but it took more than one shake of his shoulders to wake him up.
“What?”
He glanced up at his copy of Magical Hieroglyphs and Logograms, which rested in the desk next to an ancient book about Spiritual Summoning. He had to try. He stopped his walking and dropped into the chair; he was not going to stop until he could find something, even if it would take him weeks.
They entered and the smell of toasted coffee beans embraced Harry like an old friend and the sudden touch he felt on his ankles made him crouch.
“Oh, yes. Everything is perfect, is Pansy coming? She has not confirmed yet”
It probably did.
“We just had breakfast, Teddy. The excuse of being growing has its limits, buddy” he was not a spoiled kid, so he just insisted once more before giving up. Harry would buy the kid a bag full of candy and pastries since he wouldn’t be seeing him for another three days at least. Andromeda was going to kill him, but his godson’s smile was always worth it.
“Yes, but you did not answer my question. Are you feeling well?”
“I don’t know how to tell you this, it’s hard to believe, even for me, and that’s saying something” Draco’s irritation was obvious, so the other kept going “I think you were possessed” silence fell upon the room. The blond stared at his healer, who was chewing his bottom lip nervously. Draco’s memories weren’t clear, but he could see himself talking to Harry, feeling confused and scared, but that was it. Now, even when it should have sounded ridiculous, he believed it.
“Oh, I wouldn’t kill you, Teddy, but I should have burned that damn thing the moment I saw it” Andromeda shoot the older wizard a scowl and he blushed, stroking his hair.
Draco didn’t move, but looked down at his own figure; bandages were covering almost every region he could see. A sharp pain in his neck made him hiss.
“What’s that?” he asked suddenly, moving from his position, after hearing a buzzing sound.
“Relax, Draco. I have to keep one of this around for my muggle work, but I remembered I could use the information in here” Harry had then proceeded to explain something called
“Death, old friend. It is nice to see you again” Rasputin said as soon as he comprehended where he was. Something hot waved through Harry’s body. A foreign anger. He was upset himself, sure, but he knew he was not feeling just his own emotions at the moment. Could Death really feel? “I am sorry, but I have no idea who you are” he added looking at Harry this time “Although, I reckon you have something to do with my return, so I guess I should offer you my deepest gratitude”
When they finally entered, a bunch of orbs started shining with a soft white light. It looked like a lot of
“I know what you mean” he offered and the blond almost smiled “I already wrote to Hermione. I’m seeing her tomorrow, but I need to confirm if you are fine with me telling her everything”
“Where should we start?” Harry asked, looking around him, obviously disoriented.
“Are you sure?” he was a mess.
“It’s all right. Do you want to take a bath?” Draco nodded and they both stood up and made their way to the bathroom. Harry reheated the water in a moment and they entered. The pool was big enough for them to lay and don’t even touch, but they had no need of doing that. On the contrary, they ended up doing it again. Draco on top of Harry, slowly and tenderly. The blond found out he liked it that way as much as the other. It surely was driving Harry insane and therefore bringing the smugness out of Draco.
“Yes” very informative, no doubt.
“Oh yes, I’m so excited. I just can’t wait for the lot of them to go to Hogwarts, it would be like us all over again” she looked so excited that it was contagious. He was a bit jealous though. All his friends were already having families and kids and while he had Teddy, it was not the same. He had always pictured himself with a bunch of little terrors, a big happy family, and there he was, lonely and seeing everyone move on with their lives. “Don’t worry, Harry. You’ll get there, I’m sure there is some devilishly handsome man out there, who we all will approve and consider good enough for our best friend, it’s just not that simple” she said holding his hand, probably sensing his sadness. He had to laugh at the mental image.
He tried to concentrate on his own magic this time, to communicate with his body, so he could find the disturbance and…do something. Maybe he could unravel this mess by talking to this soul, what name had Potter said? Alexei. Maybe he could convince this man to leave him alone. It sounded preposterous, but the situation itself was not exactly logical.
“I thought you could see and hear what happened to Draco. He cans”
“You like it?” Draco nodded shyly “I could have sworn you hated this kind of thing”
“Are you going to explain that to me or are you too busy enjoying yourself at my expense?” he couldn’t help it, but he controlled himself and tried to explain Internet to the blond wizard, but he gave up before Harry could finish “Forget it. I look for books, you put on the goggles or whatever” this time Harry bit his lip to contain the chuckle before agreeing with Draco’s plan.
The one in the middle smelled like vodka and tea and sex. No, Harry always smelled like pine and almonds.
“I see you have met Draco” he said and the blue-haired boy looked up at him.
Exhale… Harry would be there; he was going to solve it.
“Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter” Harry offered, even if it was not necessary. He liked fallowing protocol sometimes. Made him feel like a normal person.
“I never pictured you as one to have elves working for you. Not after Granger’s campaign for the elves’ rights”
Draco read the name on the parchment and put in his pocket.
“Shocking” the sarcasm in Alexei’s voice took him back.
“Hello, prince” the man whispered back. He was awake. He had just given him time to adjust after waking up.
Death was static on its spot. Not that Harry was expecting help but it was making him nervous.
Master of Death.
“There is no way I would be able to finish this much food, mother. Between this and the fact I can’t as much as walk for exercise I will be fat in no time. You don’t want a fat son, do you?” she looked at him for a couple minutes and just when Draco thought his life would be over because his mother was going to stab him right in the forehead with her fork, she leaned in and stole his key-lime pie portion.
“I think we should give a try to this theory of yours before I get more anxious, if that’s even possible” Harry motioned to the stairs and started walking, taking his notes, and a small envelope Granger had brought him earlier, with him.
Draco didn’t remember the last time he had had a panic attack and, sure as hell, he did not remember what had triggered it, but it had been much worse than this one. This had probably been the mildest of them all. He didn’t know if it was because of the cause, which was more important than the reaction it could bring, the place, since it was his own home, or the fact that Potter had been there as soon as it had started, but it passed without consequences. Last time he had been secluded in his bathroom for almost twelve hours until Pansy had arrived and dragged him out.
Draco was not used to care for other people’s feelings. He had been a selfish little bastard all his youth and by the time he had grown up he had no one to care for except his mother and his very few friends. Narcissa was a different matter, but he had never been one to protect his friends’ sensibilities and they knew it.
“Alexander would let us know if he is captured but he is still missing” Harry’s hand was entwined with his and Draco gave it a reassuring squeeze. He wondered why Harry hadn’t asked him about the test inside the veil, but he appreciated it. He couldn’t bring himself to talk about it and keep it together. Maybe some other day.
Harry was laying in his bed, limbs spread over the mattress and the cookie bag Luna had brought yesterday resting in his belly. He was drained. He hadn’t slept for a minute last night and he probably wouldn’t do it this one either. His mind was crowded with thoughts about Draco and his illness and the sudden possession and the possibility of them being entwined. Harry knew that, to solve one, the other had to be eliminated, but how was he going to deal with a soul that wasn’t even trying to get control over Malfoy’s body?
“Do you really think it is that simple?” it said, getting in the middle of his way.
“Miss Granger, a pleasure to see you again” Harry said nothing, but Hermione smiled and offered her hand to the blond, who took it softly.
It was the most horrible thing Harry had ever heard.
“I’m not crying” he said wiping his cheeks and making the older man smile “I didn’t know your friend was sick, I’m sorry. I won’t complain anymore” he hugged his godfather and Harry stood up, carrying the boy.
“The pleasure was mine, Hermione. Thank you for your help” he said politely “Have a good day, Mr. Weasley” he had tried.
“And Mr. Malfoy, yes” Harry had answered still holding Draco’s hand.
“I know that, old man” he stopped and corrected himself “Mr. Smirnov” who the hell was Alexander? “What about Malfoy?” he asked then and all eyes fell on them making Harry tighten his arms around his boyfriend.
“Shut up, Harry. No one had noticed” they were all there, finally. Draco looked around, amazed by how much his life had changed in a couple months. From being alone with his mother and work, to having a house full of family and joy.
“This way, please” Ellias guided them through a sort of scan point where they checked their identities and then started to move towards the stairs “I have arranged for you a reunion with the head of Security Enforcement, she should be able to give you access to Koldovstoretz and then, if you are allowed to go, I will take you to a hotel until you leave to the school”
“Good evening, Draco, Mrs. Malfoy”
“I thing we are even now”
Night had gone as smooth as one could have expected with that precedent. Potter had transfigured the chair into a bed and spend the night with him, alternating reading with care-taking and one or two hours of restless sleep. Draco knew his mother had offered the wizard his guestroom and he was fine with it, but he also knew that he would not use it as long as Draco was in such condition.
“Yes. I’m sorry about Ron, he is a bit…thickheaded sometimes”
He followed Narcissa to a fully-equipped bedroom with an in-site bathroom and even a small desk facing a wide window with a view of Draco’s workshop and part of the garden. It was cozy and elegant, the same odd combination the rest of the house had.
“Hey there, buddy” the kid left a sonorous kiss on his cheek and started talking about some amazing trick he had managed to do with the broom Harry had gifted him for Christmas last year.
“They recommend that we go by the ministry to get a language artefact, whatever that is”
“What do you mean?”
“I’m sorry, Draco. I didn’t know it would hurt that much” but it was going to hurt, it had. Although, it could have been worse.
“Draco, open the door” he could do it himself, but he knew the Slytherin enough to know he could end up dead “Let me help”
They were happy, so happy.
“I don’t think I saw you in Ancient Runes back at school. Should I be concerned?” he trusted Harry, and Granger had gone over it and approve it, but he was still a little bit afraid.
“Mr. Shestakov, I think we have worst problems” a professor said, pointing her wand at Rasputin.
“Pretty sure of yourself, aren’t you Potter?” he could not avoid the mockery in his tone, but regretted it instantly. And there he was, thinking he had grown up since school when he was acting like a child, like every time he had faced Potter.
“Are you angry?”
“Good morning, mother. I can’t believe you didn’t ask how am I feeling” Narcissa send him a glare.
“Correct” he sounded like a professor “A dark charm” oh, great.
“Draco, he is just worried. He may look inflexible and stubborn, and yes, he is, but he is able to put everything aside for the people he cares about” Draco’s chest tickled “He has to absorb the idea, but once he sees it’s the best for you, he’ll come around, trust me”
He was now closer than ever.
Well, he was about to go down when he noticed another door open. That door was never open.
“Can I do it?” he looked confused now.
“Yeah, I’ve missed you too” George sent a kiss flying to him and he took it jokingly.
“Tired, not enough coffee in this house to fix me, I’m afraid” Harry moved closer to unloose the neck straps and check the clavicle wound.
He tried the locks in the closed door, but it didn’t open and somehow he had the feeling it wouldn’t.
“That’s so Saint Potter-like”
“I’m going to hurt myself for five minutes” he joked, but Draco only stared at him “Not that funny, I guess. I’ll be right back” he left the library and made his way downstairs.
Harry had been too fired up to reason at that time, but he had been certain of something: he hated the thought of Draco Malfoy getting hurt. That was not going to happen, not on his watch. He had tried for some time to convince himself that the reason he felt so protective over the man was that he was his patient, but that was bullshit. He had always been attracted to him, even if he hated himself for it, and now, that he had met this new Draco he couldn’t help to go down with the ship.
He kept his eyes locked on the veil. It’s not like he believed Death, but he wanted to. If Rasputin had come back after so many year, his boyfriend should be able to come home to him. He had no idea what kind of test was he facing, what kind of trial he had to surpass, but he hoped he would choose him.
“Where is he?” he should be there.
“Nine…ten…seek” he said loud enough for them to hear him and he started looking for them.
He had not liked it. Not the smallest bit.
“Sure” she said giving him a look that transmitted calm, even then. He nodded and appparated straight into Malfoy’s room.
“Oh. I see” she had smiled cleverly “You have a lot to tell me, young man. I expect a full detailed letter when you have the chance”
They walked behind Ellias and as soon as they turned the corner they encountered a street full of people, very different from the one they came from. Harry couldn’t get a word of what they were saying, but none of them seemed to be paying particular attention to the three wizards. They continued walking for a couple minutes until they reached a public bathroom.
In a stylish hand writing was the name of Narcissa Malfoy. That was definitely unexpected, so he stopped eating and open the envelope, extracting a long, very detailed letter. His eyes were running through the lines, trying to catch as much information as possible. Once done reading, he ran to the chimney and introduced the coordinates indicated at the end of the parchment, seconds later he was speaking directly with the witch that had saved his life ten years ago.
“You doomed his family. You sent them on the wrong path, you were the reason they were killed and yet you say it was to help him?” the veil moved, but Harry saw nothing coming out so he kept his focus on the other wizard.
“How the hell am I supposed to know that?!”
“Did you checked the hospital bill was paid?” he asked instead to change the topic.
“I guess I am not feeling like it. I have no energy today” Harry was about to ask more about it when Alexei’s body shook and Draco hissed in pain.
“You have no reservations on your name Mr. Potter, but we were notified you were staying with us” he knew, of course he did “What kind of room would you like?”
“Yeah, I’m totally normal” they both laughed then.
“She is upstairs” he said. Draco hadn’t come out of his surprise when Harry appeared.
“I have to go over some paperwork and start preparing your medicine, but I will drop by later to give you a new set of potions” Draco nodded. He had already added Harry’s magical signature to the guards in case he preferred to apparate instead of using the floo and while the Gryffindor favored the last one, he appreciated having the other possibility, just in case of emergency or something like that. “If you need me, use this” he said handing the blonde a card whit his name on it. He had made them mainly for his regular patients’ urgencies. It was enchanted to call him when touched with a wand “I’ll come immediately” and with that he retreated back home.
“It was awesome, Harry, I rode it backwards. Grandma almost killed me when she saw me”
“I’m sorry, habits are hard to forget. Ron started as an auror, but left the ministry and went to help George with the shop” Harry’s fingers brushed his skin in a very sensitive place, so Draco stayed focus on Weasley.
Blaise was coming down from Draco’s room when he arrived. Harry had decided he would talk to Narcissa first as the woman deserved to know the basics of his son’s current condition, so he had apparated in the garden connecting the house to the workshop and entered calmly through the back door.
“I know, I know, it’s not that. I’m just glad you are here” she looked nervous, but Harry let it go as Teddy threw himself into his godfather’s back.
“Poor thing. I remember I used to have the same problem when I was three. My mother lived giving me ginger infusions. At some point it stopped, but it was not pleasant” the man looked more uncomfortable with every interaction, but it didn’t stop Draco “Harry told me you work with your brother in the store” Ronald frowned at the name, but nodded anyway “How is it going? I haven’t been in England in ages, but I think they were doing great ten years ago”
“Mr. Potter should tell Bibly his favorite dessert, sir. That way Master Draco can choose it for you next time” they both blushed. That elf was too straight forward.
“I am afraid the heart is not my area of expertise, but I have done my best. He seems to have gotten better these last twelve hours” the healer spoke in a deep German accent.
He had immediately given him a key, a small, golden key that, he claimed, was made by goblins and was the only way to enter a certain room.
Draco kneeled to be at his eye level “Hi. My name is Draco Malfoy and the pleasure is all mine” Teddy opened his eyes in surprise.
“Here, let me help you” the brunet lift him until he was resting his back on the pillows before handing him a glass with a thick, muddy liquid.
They had spent more than an hour tearing apart every piece of information that the…laptop…offered and corroborating that it matched the books, but it was also limited. Oh surprise. They had managed to find the cause of death, and some more information on the family and the revolution. They had also learned that Anastasia, the youngest girl, had supposedly escaped the massacre and lived for some more time, but they both doubted it. The rest of it was old history: Alexei was born with hemophilia, Nikolai II had not been the best leader, the revolution had been awful and their deaths were the most horrible thing they had both ever read, and that was saying something after living through a war.
“I’m here, babe” he whispered back.
He managed to get there without being caught and locked the door behind him; he also added some silencing spells as soon as he deposited Draco on the bed. He ran to look for his medical bag and started to treat Draco.
“As I was saying, I remember being forced to memorize the whole family tree of the British royal family”
September mornings weren’t cold, actually, they had the perfect temperature, but it was raining cats and dogs outside today, so, instead of walking home, Harry found a lonely corner and apparated.
He wished he had his wand and that it could be as simple as saying
He was trying to decipher if a certain scrawl was a representation of the Thurisaz rune or the Wunjo one when Harry’s face appeared mere inches away from his. He took a step back, hiding his surprise as well as he could.
With a twirl of his wand the workshop was reorganized, he took his coat from the back of the chair and made his way back to the main house.
Well.
“Harry?” he called. He wanted him to greet his mother.
The next he knew, Draco was hissing and he immediately withdraw his wand; the light was gone and he was left panting while Draco stroked his throat, also looking out of breath.
“Cooking, maybe?” the healer suggested, amused.
He was in that same room, of course. Harry’s wand was still on the floor and the door was still slightly open. He went straight to it, but instead of the hall, he found himself in a dark stone corridor. He knew, somehow, that he needed a candle. Where had he put his wand? Had he left it in the room? Maybe. It didn’t matter. He was under the impression that it wouldn’t work anyway.
“Well, I did stay in England, but I think that was obvious” Draco rolled his eyes and Potter smiled “My godfather left his house to me. I was tempted to move out since it had too many stained memories and he actually hated the place, but it was the only thing I had linking me to my family so, I stayed there. I renovated it, though, it is way less terrifying now”
They finished that movie and went through their options for the next one. It was Draco’s turn to pick. He didn’t know any of the titles but one of them called his attention.
“How so?” Rasputin’s collected mask had flinched for a moment. He was getting nervous.
He looked up at Rasputin. He nodded. He thought of Draco and Harry. He took his sister’s hand.
“Have you told Harry?” she asked cheerfully.
It took them less than five minutes on the bike to reach a small shopping district that Harry frequented with Teddy. Draco walked the couple streets with outmost curiosity, fascinated by every funny thing he saw in the shop-windows. They reached a hidden and cozy coffee shop with a cat sign on the entry. Harry had been there a thousand times since Teddy discovered the reason behind the cat symbol, and he had the feeling Draco would enjoy it too, or be extremely annoyed, both ways, Harry’s win.
“Come on, I can’t go through all this on my own, can I?” Malfoy’s face shifted from surprise, to comprehension, to irritation. He rolled his eyes and put a cookie in his mouth before muttering something that sounded like
“I tried to remember if he had a stick like you do, but I think he had nothing like that” he answered “He carried a bag with papers everywhere, though. And a big cross around his neck that he touched every time he healed me. He never took that off, but I guess that makes sense; he was using his connection to God to cure me” he added while laying his head on the pillow.
He took one of the letter after closing the book he was reading and unfolded it. A broken vine wand, dragon heartstring core, an English witch who lived in Spain. He could not fix it and she knew it, but she requested a new one with the same qualities and, if possible, the same core. Those were tricky ones, but he enjoyed a good challenge. Marking the parchment with a green
“I told you, I cannot hurt you”
Down.
“What are you talking about?” he explained and Draco’s expression turned into a horrified one “I’m not doing that!”
“Fine, I agree with this” he said so softly he doubted for a second that they had heard him, but it seemed like they did because his mother whispered a relieved
“Good evening, prince” Draco let go the air he had been holding without noticing. This was not another dream, another illusion. He was back to Harry, his Harry. He felt relief run through his body as Harry’s smell invaded his lungs.
“Mr. Potter would prefer Pumpkin Pie which is Madam’s favorite, Apple Crisp Cheesecake, Master Draco’s favorite or Fresh Peach Crumble with season fruit?”
” Harry didn’t need to understand what he was saying to comprehend it. That was Draco’s voice, but it was definitely not him.
“It was not going to be so easy, Potter. It could be anywhere in these books. They don’t have very suggestive titles, so we have to go through them all” Draco said, leaving the volume in his hands on the pile of discarded and reaching for Harry’s book “Let me see that one. I don’t trust your reading skills” he was already going back to the page where Salazar Slytherin’s family tree started. It was a graphic book, therefore, it was huge.
He stayed immobile for a couple more minutes before finishing his breakfast and deciding he needed a shower and that he could deal with his mixed feelings later. He had a shirt on since the wounds in his upper body were healed, but trousers were still uncomfortable. He was almost sure he had a pair of gray harem trousers Pansy had given him for some fashion test once, but he had to find them in his wardrobe first. He was not enthusiastic about the idea, but he had to stop going around half naked, especially if Potter kept his way of applying ointment.
He knew Alexei had been the cause, but he could not blame the boy. They could control him to a certain point; and being in front of his family memorial was too much of a trigger. He had broken the connection, something probably risky, but he didn’t know if it was permanent, if it had even worked or if Draco had passed out from the shock. He could not ask for help without having to explain the situation and that was not an option.
Draco woke up to something familiarly warm against his back. He was laying on his side and a heavy arm was over his waist. He could feel Harry’s breath on his nape, deep and steady. It took him a second to remember how had he ended up in such situation.
“Where have you been then?” he asked. He could feel the tears rolling down his cheek but he ignored them.
“There’s nothing to thank for, I’m glad to help. See you soon, Draco” and with that he left the room. He heard distant voices coming from downstairs before it went silent and in no time his mother was opening the door.
“And I am not. But I like a good deal as much as anyone”
Draco was resting his head on Harry’s shoulder as the sun set behind the further lavender flowers of the field, thinking that, perhaps, that field had been altered with magic for it still had bloomed flowers and that was not the weather for it. But he could be imagining it, after all, he was exhausted. The reunion had ended just fine but it had been a challenge to keep it smooth all the time. On top of that, the kids had invented a game that involved the adults, and with the obvious exception of Hermione and Lucius, they had all ended up drained. Well, George and Ginny had managed to survive longer than the rest of them but, eventually, they had fallen too.
The item in Harry’s lap was even scarier up close. It had a shiny screen and a bunch of buttons with letters that the other wizard kept pressing randomly while words appeared in the white bar of the luminescent board.
Draco’s dream came to him. He heard his voice, telling him what had happened, as he ran downstairs. Turn here, careful with the broken step, follow your instincts, well, at least that was something he had. It usually got him into trouble but he was looking for that, he needed to find Draco and he knew he was in danger, he needed Harry and he was not there.
“I think I can manage for a few hours” he assured Harry, but he had no desire of staying alone when anything could happen in his absence; they had no idea how the link would behave. The healer seemed to be thinking the same, since he looked hesitant. Draco gave it a second thought and came up with a proposal “Can I go with you?” he murmured so softly that he doubted Harry had truly heard him.
He felt the flow of his own power through his body, something he had learnt to do while studying wand-making so he could imbue the materials with his magic to transform, for example, a simple piece of wood into a functional wand. He did not found any disorders in the course of his magic, but that was nothing definitive. The only thing that startled him was the now usual feeling of sharing his body, the difference being that, this time, he knew that it was the case.
“Hi, Kreacher, this is Draco Malfoy, Draco, this is Kreacher” the probably blind creature looked at him abruptly and held the necklace he had, a sort of locket with an S. It didn’t look like something a house elf would own.
“Nice” was all that Draco could come up with.
He tried mirror by mirror, facing his own hand against the hard suffice in every effort, until one of them swallowed his fingers, then his palm, his wrist, his entire body was going through the looking glass.
Thanks for your comments, specially to Mostlywinstuff and TweetArya for the first comments. I don’t think I know how to answer to them but I tried, so I hope you got my reply. Thank you so much.
“Good” he took the book back and eyed it again, looking for something he could have missed.
He kept going away until his back hit the wall. Harry was trying to find out what was wrong. Had the spell damaged Draco? It was barely possible, Harry had made sure it didn’t have any side effects even if it didn’t work properly, but maybe he had done something wrong during the incantation itself.
“Are they gone?” Draco asked even if he knew the answer.
“Come” the voice said. It was really tempting. For some reason he knew he would be okay if he obliged, he knew he would be safe because Harry was supposed to be there.
“It’s perfect” he praised, interrupting the girl, mid-sentence, when he tasted a sip “How did you know I don’t like sugar?”
“I am, I mean, I knew something was off with me, I told you the other day, but of course I’m concern. Someone apparently possessed me and I don’t remember a thing about it, and while I would have normally told you you’re crazy I do trust you and it freaks me out” Draco was not used to say that out loud, so he cleared his throat and kept talking “Did it say something else?”
“I’m glad you called, I was actually planning on writing to you for help”
“Thank you” he said in a whisper.
actually meant fire, and it was the name of the red and gold section of the hotel.
He was suspicious. He had the feeling his mother had managed to leave them alone. She had been bothering him about building a civil relationship with Harry, and even when he had assured her that they were civil enough, she kept insisting. That looked very much like one of his mother’s attempts.
He felt a hand on his, Harry’s, probably. He couldn’t hear or see anything. The room was too dark.
“The pleasure is mine, Mr. Malfoy, thank you for your congrats by the way. It was a pleasant surprise” Draco smiled politely while the other wizard processed the situation. He knew Malfoy was well-mannered but the man in front of him had nothing to envy Prince Charming and, on top of that, it appeared the blond had somehow congratulated his friend about something.
“I think someone is about to go to bed without dinner” Draco composed himself immediately and made a gesture of zipping his mouth close that made Harry grin.
“Were you planning on telling me anytime soon?!”
“An old habit” Draco smiled. He was happy, tired, sure, but happy that everything had gone well. He couldn’t imagine his life with Harry if their families and friends were in conflict. They didn’t have to love each other and exchange Christmas’ presents, but at least be able to behave in common ground.
“I, I mean, he was being carried, the whole family was walking to a room underground. They killed them, Harry, cold-bloodedly, with those muggle things, guns, I think they are called. The bullets were everywhere” he was shaking, who would do that to a bunch of kids, for Merlin’s sake? “There was a girl, she was still alive when…well, when he died. I think that’s who he was asking about”
“I broke the connection between you two, but I had no idea what was happening or what did you mean by making him stop; I just did what I thought was best” Draco nodded and tried to analyze if he felt anything different now that he was not linked to Alexei. He decided he did not and proceeded to explain what had happened back in the church to Harry.
she had told him, and yeah, she was right, he had better luck on that department, women were just not his thing. Saving the world had been way easier than kissing a girl.
“Oh yes. Russians are secretive. But maybe they’ll make an exception for Mr. Potter” they arrived to the third floor before noticing and the unspeakable walked straight to a door at the end of the narrowest aisle Harry had ever seen. He had to squeeze in it at the beginning, his shoulders barely passing the frame, but as soon as they started walking it grew larger, showing lines of bookshelves and other doors in between. He struggled with the end again, but finally, they reached the door. He couldn’t read the sign but he assumed it was the person they wanted to see.
Wands could not be mended once they broke and yet Draco was holding Harry’s wand. He was holding something that should be impossible.
“Yes. I bought it when we went to that library in London but I hadn’t found the time to give it to you” they started walking, his arm around Draco’s waist.
and something amazingly dramatic definitely happening.
“Are you waiting for someone, Mr. Stranger?” Rasputin voice took him out of his mind.
Inhale… He calmed down bit by bit. His ribs didn’t hurt any more, his head stopped turning; he loosed the force in his hands and stop moving.
“Don’t be. Anyway, were you even paying attention to your work?” he pointed to the papers “You seem to have been too attentive of my conversation” Draco raised an eyebrow, teasingly.
“Annoyed?”
“I know it’s stupid, since it doesn’t solve a thing, but it was a way of burning away the anxiety. When everything finished I even considered that the war had been the easy part. To deal with the lost, the trauma, the stress, the attention, the consequences…it was too hard” Draco offered him a supportive look “I went to a muggle university and I was lucky I had the excuse of being away and studying overnight to cover the fact that I barely slept, otherwise Hermione and Ginny would have killed me”
“Okay, okay. I get it” he chuckled and reached for Draco’s hand “Babe”
“Well, not me. I can only feel what he is feeling and, believe me, it is enough” Harry felt a little bit ashamed. If Draco was felling the third part of what he felt, those were no emotions for a thirteen years old kid.
Harry slid a hand under Draco’s left thigh, lifting it into the air and guiding it until his foot was resting on the warm skin of his shoulder. Then, Draco fell back moaning when Harry’s tongue touched his entrance for the first time, feeling like fire had just kissed the sensitive skin. He tried to hold onto reality by grasping the sheets with his fist.
“Thank you” he said softly and even if he looked like he wanted to say something else, Harry was not going to force him to do anything he wasn’t ready for.
“Be careful, Potter, if you fall from up there you could hurt yourself badly”
“Listen, Hermione thinks we should meet now, can we go over in say…ten minutes?” he looked down at his trousers, cursing and thanking Pansy at the same time, before answering affirmatively “Great, we’ll be there soon, I have to find a chimney” he dropped the thing back at its place.
They were Malfoys.
“Yeah, bye” and they disappeared through the garden door.
Back to Hermione’s letter, she had asked how they were too vaguely, almost politely, probably out of the excitement of having a baby-boy coming up soon, and told him about how Ron was planning on throwing a party but wanted to wait for him to celebrate. She also asked if they were together already and, if so, how was he planning on telling her husband. That had made him smile; she knew him way too well.
No thinking about that.
“Of course. Those kids had no future back then. Russia would have made a joke out of them after killing their parents. They were born with a bright destiny but they lost it during the war. I can see the future and I knew they were going to be humiliated, they were going to be miserable orphans. I changed that. They went to the other side with their parents, as victims, as martyrs” Harry controlled the retch that overwhelmed him. That man was completely convinced that he had done nothing wrong.
“I know” he answered automatically before sipping his tea.
An elder wand, thestral’s hair core.
“Why wouldn’t he tell me?!” he sounded hurt and outraged.
“I’ll be all right, love” he kissed him softly “Go. We have to solve this once and for all. I’m just sorry I can’t be more helpful”
Lucky for them, the signs were in various languages and they were able to find out that
The situation was definitely a déjà vu, he had dreamed of that when he was a teenager and hated the guts out of Harry and his stupid face. Although, he had to admit this version was so much better built than his scrawny predecessor, so much better…
Harry was there, his back turned to the entrance while he poured something from a bottle into the pool, already filled with a very inviting steamy water. Draco was barefooted so Harry didn’t notice his presence until he wrapped his arms around the brunet’s chest.
“Oh, good to know you were just mildly dying, I’ll make sure not to worry next time” he rolled his eyes. And then she called him a drama queen, bullshit “I’ll bring you some food, I think you have lost weight” Harry looked at her fondly, and Draco smiled while she left the room.
“Rasputin?” he asked.
“Why?”
“Well, I guess that makes sense” he answered dryly “He wouldn’t have had half the followers he had if they found out he was a half-blood”
By the time he left his workshop it was almost four in the afternoon, he still had another hour to meet his mother, so he decided to take a stroll around the house. Draco’s chalet was one of six in the area. It was located in the outsides of the city, in a small open field, where the six houses were distributed, far enough from one another and all of them belonging to magical families. Draco was the only single man in the area and the only one living by his own. He had looked for a place to live for months, but nothing convinced him, until he found that one. The house itself wasn’t as spectacular, but if he walked down a near hill, he would find the most beautiful, wild lavender field. He loved that place and there’s where he was heading.
“Now, do you have any idea how to bake a carrot cake?” Harry laughed at the sight of the kitchen turned upside down, flour covered every surface, the carrots where grating themselves and falling out of the bowl and the vanilla bottle laid open in the counter, dripping to the floor, as George read a book of recipes that was clearly not very helpful.
“But we have barely been together the last few weeks, you are always busy. And now I’ll have to stay with gran for three days and I love her, but I miss you, Harry” he was almost crying, and his hair had turned blue. Thanks Merlin he had taken precautions. Harry kneeled in front of the boy and hold him near.
“Is there any possibility that this illness is causing me to feel…like I’m not myself?” the dark-haired man stared at him, but not as Draco had expected. There was no mockery in his expression, he just seemed to be thinking about it, and it irritated Draco to no end.
“Draco…um…I don’t know how to put this, but…”
“I saw your father today. The doctors say he has been behaving, but still has no memories of the recent events. He gave me a flower, the same kind he used to bring me when we first met” Draco knew how much she loved her husband, even after all they had gone through, so, he couldn’t help the knot forming in his stomach at the situation. They had made many mistakes, but his mother didn’t deserve that; she had probably been the bravest of the Malfoys. “Are you alright, Draco? You look pale” seconds later he was empting his gut in the lawn, holding tightly to the chair, everything turning around him, right before it all went black.
He washed his face and teeth and tried to fix his hair with his fingers, making it look more sexy-casual than pillowed-mess and went back to the room. Harry was reclined against the wall beside the bathroom, waiting for him. He looked good even after barely sleeping. The thought of Potter aging nicely crossed his mind again. Merlin, what was wrong with him that morning?
It had turned out to be a good day after all.
“Better?” it was an even dummier question, but the blond nodded anyway, still whining “Can you tell me your full name? I can start by looking it up. I presume you are from Russia?” he nodded again.
“I agree”
“Don’t know” he could barely talk. He could feel his heart fighting to get out of his chest. His hands were trembling and tears had started to form on his eyes.
“He is better, but I need to solve this soon. He needs to go back home in full shape and he needs to do it quickly”
His mother was adjusting his father’s sheets so he was completely covered and there was a man in the room, a healer, picking potions and bright stones up. He supposed it was Harry’s colleague. He had written to his mother the very same day Harry told him about that but he had no idea what had happened next. He had been too busy dying or trying not to, to be precise.
He chose to sit in one of the armchairs. The throne-like chair looked too old and unused and he would not be the one to disturb it. He unfastened the button of his suit’s vest and sat down as gently as he could manage since his back hurt like the devil, but he was received by a very soft cushion. Those looked rather new, so they had probably been chosen by Harry. He had to remember to thank him later.
He was turning in a hall on the second floor, absentmindedly, when he heard his name being called very, very softly. He glanced both ways and to his back but he saw no one there. It was not until he reached the staircases, a couple steps ahead, that he saw a little girl with lovely freckles, dressed in the school’s navy uniform, making gestures for him to get closer.
“Dangerous hobby” Draco glared at the brunette who was smiling teasingly.
“What are you, four?” he joked, earning himself a glare from the other wizard.
“Mom, I can walk. You know? I’m not paralytic, I could eat with you down stairs” he protested as a tray, full with every protein known, fell softly on his lap.
“Remind me again why did you put sugar in the cake?” Draco asked and Harry laughed.
By eleven Teddy had passed out in the couch, but the adults continue to drink, ignoring that the next day, many of them had to go to work, but potions were made for something. Hermione grabbed her glass of juice and stood up asking for their attention.
“Hopeless positivism” then both laughed.
“And you say it like it’s the easiest thing in the world? Such a Potter thing to do”
“That leaves us two days for shopping and sightseeing” Harry knew he wanted to say something else, but he wouldn’t push it.
Lily ran to him and climbed on his leg until she was settled in Draco’s lap and went straight to the sweets displayed in a silver tray on the table.
The healer managed to unzip the blonde’s coat enough to see if he had any injuries, and even when he was not wounded, a bunch of hematomas were starting to form everywhere, his skin was really hot but he was shivering. Harry was officially panicking. Alexei was out of control and that was messing with Draco’s power. Wizards healed by means of their own magic, and his medicines were just a plus to aid his organism; if he lost his control that way, it would affect his body that was already in a delicate situation.
“How else could he have found the entrance? Only those who know this place exists can get inside the mirrors” Alexander continued.
That was going to be a really long night.
She broke the silence first.
“What have you done?” he asked.
“Thank you, Alexander” he nodded and the man left the room. After a couple minutes Harry stopped hearing voices, so, he grabbed Draco as naturally as possible, in case anyone saw them, and made his way towards the third floor.
“You sound way less optimistic than this morning”
“I was thinking we could go and grab lunch somewhere before heading home. I have to buy something anyway” Draco shrugged and they made their way out.
“Beef Wellington” Draco coughed his wine in a really un-Malfoy way.
“Okay, the sooner we start the quicker we’ll be done” he put his legs in the position Harry had instructed him earlier and closed his eyes. He had to connect both sides of his body, so his feet and palms had to touch, that way the magical energy flow was uninterrupted.
“Thanks” he took a sip. Perfect “I got us a little bit of everything, I hope you are hungry” Draco nodded and took a piece of bread and spread some butter on it. They stayed in silence for a while more until Harry noticed Draco looking at him from over the juice cup “What’s with you today? You have been acting so weird”
“I didn’t say you were going to die, Merlin you’re such a drama queen” he added in a whisper forgetting for a second he was talking to a patient, but the other man had always been good at getting on his nerves “It has a treatment, luckily, I just need to adjust it to your biology. I’ll have it ready in a few days and you should get better almost immediately. You just need to avoid any kind of injury; it could be really dangerous”
“I don’t know. Although, I can tell you it’s your soul what is here, not you. Do you remember anything before our encounter the other day?”
He was being kissed like he had never been kissed before, Harry’s hands where on his hip, keeping him as close as possible, like he was going anywhere. The soft contact of the cool metal of Harry’s frames against his cheek, the hungry lips devouring his, his tongue tasting Draco’s eagerly, as if he was trying to steal the flavor out of him, to never forget it.
“Thirteen, my birthday is next month” he was a kid. A kid that had died at thirteen. Harry was not expecting that.
“To protect everyone, my friend. I cannot share his secrets and he cannot share ours. As simple as that”
“This guy had something seriously wrong going on in his head” Harry concluded.
This was stressful.
No, not this again. He knew what was coming.
“Not much, the twins are driving me crazy. I caught Lorcan out in the garden the other night, almost leaving the wards. I think he was chasing something or was affected by Wracksputs, I didn’t have my glasses though” Harry smiled at that.
“Hemophilia is an inherited condition and it is really rare among wizards, especially pure-blood ones, besides, you don’t have a family history of this disease from any line. On top of that, the signs of Hemophilia are impossible to hide: bruises, articular pain, lack of coagulation when harmed. Medicine has improved a lot for muggles but magical kids with this illness rarely get much older than fifteen years”
“I was about to come home after work, but when I tried to organize the studio, I don’t know, my wand didn’t answer. I saw things explode and my body hurt and…”
He screamed again.
“For Merlin’s sake, just kill me already” he murmured to himself and Draco had to laugh. Well, the day had gotten better, undoubtedly. He had had a chance to meet his mother’s family house, he had found out Potter thought he was attractive, so far, so good.
“Sure, fire away” he explained the basics of the situation, respecting Draco’s privacy and concentrating on asking about something that could cause a healthy wizard to suffer from an inexplicable disease “Did you check the magic core?”
” he murmured. He was not Hermione, but he could manage a decent enough memory charm. Everyone present started to look confused and then they kept walking like nothing had happened; the girl on the phone cut the call and apologized to the assistant for bothering him but she couldn’t seem to remember why she had called on the first place.
Draco having Hemophilia was just crazy. Even for muggles it was infrequent and there he was, filled with bruises, joint pain and inexistent levels of the eighth factor. The only healing treatment for non-magical people was a liver transplantation, but it was possible to live almost normally just by injecting the missing factor frequently, so Harry needed a way to adjust the regular drug to a wizard’s metabolism for it to work on the Slytherin. He wasn’t taking any drastic measures until there was an explanation.
“I have another question” he said instead, turning to look at Harry “Just an insignificant detail” the brunet nodded “Do you mind telling me why the fuck was Death protecting you?”
A couple minutes later they were still in the bathroom’s floor, holding each other, as Draco recovered.
A couple hours later, Harry knew everything about the Russian royal family and their descend, he read some more stuff related to Anastasia, but they were not really conclusive and he had come across a new name, Grigori Rasputin, that seem somehow important. He was supposed to be a priest of some kind but he had helped “heal” Alexei’s hemophilia, something suspicious in Harry’s opinion, since there had been no cure back then; he had also been known for his predictions and their accuracy and he had played an enormous roll on the failure of the tsar’s ruling. Apparently he had had quite a reputation.
“Good. I’m Ellias Loughty. I’m here to escort you. Welcome to Moscow” the Russian Ministry was located in the capital, but that’s all they knew. That’s why they needed someone to guide them and Hermione had been nice enough to arrange that for them. The man had a rusty voice and a heavy accent, but he was supposed to be British, so it was a little confusing “The ministry is not far, fallow me”
“I don’t think it works like that. Alexei is able to use your abilities such as language because he is feeding from your magic, but he sums nothing to you”
“Fuck” he moaned when he felt Harry’s hand wrap around his neglected cock, completely hard again, as if he was a hormonal teenager who could take it as many times as he wanted. Draco was crumbling, he was letting Harry melt him and rebuild him like he wished. He had never felt more complete. Draco tried to tighten his muscle ring around Harry and he knew he had done it when his boyfriend gasped and quickened his pace even more, if possible.
“How is that possible?”
He changed the course of his kisses, going down Harry’s neck, biting, liking, marking desperately. He moved his hip and rubbed his groin against Harry’s, smiling triumphantly when the other growled in his ear as they reached the bed. He never untangled his legs from around Harry, making them fall together on the soft mattress. It was not a smooth movement but he couldn’t care less.
The weather was not ideal, but it wasn’t that cold either, especially for late October. Ms. Kozlova reminded them to be back at the instructed hour and left them on their own with a really vague indication on the stylist location. Luckily, Harry was not expecting much more from the woman and he had taken his own precautions.
“Magical processes like soul attachment or fragmentation, usually have a visible effect on wizards and witches. The body repels the intrusion in one way or another and is even more difficult when the person has a powerful core, we agree on that; but muggle souls have no magical signature, they are not recognized as hostile and, therefore, they are not rejected” she explained.
“He should be here any minute. He went to pick up Lily” at that exact moment the fireplace flashed and Harry appeared, carrying a little black haired girl in his arms. Their daughter.
Everything in that sodding school was a torment to the savior of wizarding England. He had struggled to find Ms. Kozlova’s office, he had found it empty, he had got lost looking for her in the halls, he had entered the girl’s bathroom by accident, he had found the damn woman back in her office once he returned twenty minutes later; he had fought with her for the permission to go outside of the school, she had told him to ask the headmaster, he had preferred to die, and told her so, she had agreed but had put every possible limitation and finally, when he had got the bloody permit it was written in Cyrillic and he hadn’t had the slightest idea of the conditions written in it, but he had signed it nonetheless.
“Do you know where he is?” he tried instead.
“Promised. By who?” Harry could make himself an idea, but it was a nauseous thought. How could anyone do something like that to a little boy?
“Sorry?” the witch rolled her eyes but smiled before kissing him too.
“Yeah” he took a bite “I’m not thrilled about that, if I’m being honest, but I guess it is necessary”
“Shall we wait for your mother?” he asked as Draco took his own seat.
Draco went first inside the chimney, straight to his mother’s house. Harry had gone to drop their luggage at his house. If she was not there he would wait for him to come back before going to the hospital but he saw the window open and heard the kettle whistling before Harry stepped out of the chimney behind him.
“I have grown up, Potter, thank you very much” he said crossing his arms over his chest making the other laugh while finishing with his thigh, which he was working hard not to think about.
He found himself in front of a door after half an hour walking, or was it three hours? He had no idea, but there were three doors, he was certain of that, at least. All of them were different and none contained any indicators of which one was he supposed to choose.
He stood up and opened the balcony doors to let more air inside and walked until his abdomen was in touch with the railing before closing his eyes.
“Says who?” she left her cup on the table and stood up “I’m done with this conversation, honey, and I would really appreciate if you don’t bring it up with Harry. He was not comfortable with the subject when I addressed it and I don’t want him to feel bad” and with that she left the balcony, returning to his room.
“What are you talking about? He went inside that thing; he is dead” he hissed the last word. He was not ready to say that.
Wait, was he being manipulated right now? Rasputin lowered his hands and clasped his cross. Harry started to drop his wand too.
Death was laughing.
“Harry?” the voice answered. It went silent for a while before speaking again “I see” he said, sounding intrigued and excited “Come, he is here” he knew it. He knew he was going to be here. Harry was always near when he felt safe. But, was he? Was Draco really safe there? He was cold; he was never cold around Harry.
They stayed like that for a couple minutes. Catching their breath. Harry fell on his side and hugged Draco.
“Hum, that’s peculiar indeed, I’ll make some research; I’ll tell you if I find anything”
“Why not?”
“Then there is no one better to detain him” another voice spoke. One Harry was a little bit more used to “You will agree with me that we must found out how is this possible” said Alexander, stepping inside the room “You must forgive my tardiness. I am too old for that bloody passage”
“Okay, let’s hear this”
“Hush, my dear. There is no need to cry” he heard a voice. Not Draco’s. A horrible voice. He lifted his face and looked for the origin “I am here. I have been longing to see you” Harry saw a hooded figure floating towards him. It was not a Dementor. Dementors couldn’t speak. It was something else, something worse.
He and Dudley had a civic relationship now, since he had come to Harry a couple of years after graduating Hogwarts and apologized for everything he had done. They even had gone to a couple football matches now and then but he had not once gone to his house, let alone the fact that he had actually spoken with a magical creature. He should probably be worried but he didn’t care for his cousin that much, leaving him merely intrigued.
“Are we the first ones?” Ronald asked, depositing Rose on the floor.
“Dark magic, probably” Draco nodded and the healer continued with his previous idea “It explains that you have a muggle condition, that your wand fails you even when it’s loyalty has not changed and most of the concerns you have about not feeling yourself. It also explains that it didn’t showed itself before”
They were kind of stuck with the reading. Draco’s tip had led them to the right section of the library, but there were at least fifteen books on the subject. The ones they had already gone through were resting, useless, by the tray Kreacher had brought them with coffee and sandwiches, now empty. Harry’s lap was full with a thick volume named
“Oh, welcome Master Draco, the house is happy to receive family” he looked subtly at Potter “Forgive Kreacher, Master”
Narcissa came by a couple times, first bringing Harry tea and then some dinner. He told her about Draco being awake for a minute and she left a little bit more relieved. When it got dark outside Harry went over the wounds and replaced the bandages before sitting back. He grabbed a book and reviewed some of his notes there, all about Draco’s condition, for hours until his eyes felt to heavy and started to close.
“I see you have one of my gifts with you” it said. It sounded like a he, but it could be anything and Harry had no intention of acknowledge its presence, even when it was right in front of him “Why are you so sad?” it asked. He could not get his eyes of the black figure but he could not talk, it hurt too much “Is it because of the boy?” Harry’s attention focused on where the mouth of that thing should be. It was dark and he could barely see his own hands, the only light in there came from the arc, along with a soft, undefined whisper, so he wasn’t able to see any particular features “Was he important to you?” it continued to talk and it was getting closer. Harry drew his wand out and aimed it towards Death “That is not my wand, but I can tell it still belongs to you, as does the cloak and the stone hanging from your neck” he grabbed the necklace unconsciously “You can talk to me. You are the only one I consider my equal. I won’t hurt you”
“Good night, babe”
“You look good babe, trust me” he did, he always did.
“Not like that! Ugh…let’s just eat, okay?” he passed Draco his plate and poured some more wine in both their glasses before sitting next to the blond.
Draco thought they were going to do the experiment in his bedroom, now known as the hospital wing, but Harry passed the door and entered his own room; the blond followed.
“I fou…what are you doing?” he asked, dumfounded.
“Draco, Harry told me all about it. I’m so happy we are moving forward. You’ll see, you’ll be better in no time. Why are you so red, darling? Should I call Harry back?”
Maybe he had to go looking for him. Maybe everything was on the other side of that veil. Maybe he could finally find the library and his answers and his boyfriend…
“Harry, I think you are overreacting. It’s a perfectly logical idea and you know it” she tried, earning herself a glare from the dark-haired wizard that would scare a basilisk “Am I supposed to be impressed by that look?” the man growled and continued pacing “Ignore him, Draco. He can be really irrational sometimes. I do think it’s a good idea. Did you speak with Alexei about it?”
What had really puzzled Harry was the note he received from Kreacher. Poorly written, due to the old elf’s semi-blindness, he notified Harry in it that his cousin had gone by the house and when he had found out he was not there he had asked Kreacher to tell him he had sent him an e-mail; although Kreacher had written
Why now?
“This is the first time you admit you lions are thick-headed”
It all made sense then. All the pieces fell in their place.
“How are you feeling?” Harry asked putting the bottle in his pocket and turning in his arms until he was facing Draco.
“I’m your healer, Draco, this is strictly necessary, and you know it” he did, but he was to proud and to ashamed to show his body to his ex-nemesis “Please” Draco inhaled deeply and started unbuttoning his shirt with his eyes closed.
Four hours, eight coffees and twenty-three parchments later, he had two things: a crazy theory and a massive headache.
“Oh, believe me, he is. You should have met him twelve years ago. He is being charming these days” something in Harry’s voice made him laugh. He was familiar with blood-purity-obsessed creatures and it was not pleasant to deal with them when you were not the object of their adoration “I think he just puts up with me because he is old. Age has softened him. Shall we?” he asked pointing the stairs and Draco nodded.
When Harry left his room he started to feel the oppression in his chest again. He grabbed his sides strongly and concentrated in his breathing while rocking in the place.
“Oh, who knows? Maybe hell is full with littles Potters who would torment me forever” Harry smiled. If he could joke like that he was not that bad.
He looked up, to where Death was now floating in front of him, protecting him.
“This is a library, I thought we were going to a bookshop” Draco asked beside him and he had to force himself to keep his eyes from the blond. He had adjusted the sweater to Draco’s size and he had picked that one because he had barely use it. He had discovered that that color didn’t fit him, but it definitely looked good on the blond, too good, it was distracting.
“Is not about you cutting your hair, babe” he answered. He had come with the idea after Draco had left the room that morning, still tasting him on his tongue, the thought of skipping too many stages had come to him and stayed there the entire day. He wanted his relationship with Draco to be special, in a nice way. Sure, they had not started in a particularly romantic situation, but he wanted to make Draco fall in the best way he could. He had not been lying when he said he was not a good boyfriend, he had never been, he was not one for details, but he was set on making things work, and he would “I want to take you on a date” he said to the blond who stopped moving his hands and shifted his position on his lower back so he could look straight at Harry.
Draco explained everything; from the feeling of someone else sharing his body, to the dreams, the failures in his abilities, the lack of certain memories and the presence of many other that didn’t belong to him, but he felt them as they were. Potter stayed in silence, playing with the black stone hanging from his necklace, absorbing everything Draco said, his eyes were like an open book, the blonde could almost see his thoughts running wild through them. When he finished, embarrassed, but relaxed from taking that weight off his shoulders and finding someone who would listen and really try to comprehend him, Potter nodded but remained silent for a couple more minutes… way too long for Draco.
“No, I feel like shit but you know that already. How did you make him stop?”
No, Harry couldn’t have been there. Had he been lying to Draco? Was that possible? Apparently everything was possible for Harry Potter. He could even fix a broken wand.
The blond was lying in his bed, blood was everywhere, and Narcissa was trying to hold the bleeding in some of the wounds but it kept coming out, staining the sheets and clothes.
He approached the spot she had picked to place the table and chair with his tea and books. She looked at him from the corner of her eyes.
“Oh, Merlin, just kill me already, again, whatever” Harry laughed one more time and before Draco could react his mouth was on his.
“Well, you know I’m reluctant to apparition in your condition and it’s a bit far to walk. Scared of bikes, Malfoy?”
“W-w-where are we?” he asked after a couple minutes. Harry noticed again the strong accent, and the fact that it seemed to be difficult for him to speak in English. The first time they had met he had spoken in Russian; maybe the spell gave him access to Draco’s…capabilities, even if he still struggled with the language. Harry wondered what else would it do; would he be able to do magic? It was unlikely, but the healer decided that finding that out was not his priority.
“I’m fine mother, I will take it easy today, I promise. Just a couple hours to finish the wand I was working on yesterday and I will come right back home and take the rest of the day off”
“I think we could agree on the last part, but Weasley has some brilliant moments; he married you, after all” he kissed her cheek good bye and she left with a smile.
“What do you mean? Where is he?” he tried to sound as calm as possible but it was a challenge with his head drumming.
“You can ask the elves for anything you might need. I know this is Draco’s house, but if I had taught him anything there should be no problem with you making yourself comfortable”
Was his reason coming back to him? Had he really lost it?
to do. Easier to say, though”
He made his way to the computers on the corner of the library and started looking for more updated information on the Romanovs. He wanted to take notes but he couldn’t just summon a parchment while being surrounded by muggles so he stood up and went to the little stationer’s store on the second floor of the building. He bought a notebook and a regular pen and made his way back to the electronic station. He saw Draco between some shelves, completely absorbed in the reading, so he decided not to interrupt him.
“I hope I can behave as good as you, then” he said and started striping as well.
By the time he got to their room he was grumpy, stressed and hungry. Founding Draco dressing a small table for them to have dinner together had soothed him a little but it took more than that, precisely, a cup of wine and a back massage, to get him back into his relaxed mood again.
“I’m sorry, Luna, I have to go, you can stay as long as you want, just ask Kreacher to secure everything after you go, please”
The proud dragon could fall a thousand times and even if he could open his wings by his own, Harry would always be there to help him fly again.
I don't know about you but I found very little oficcial information about Koldovstoretz, so, I kind of made it up.
“Technicalities” he had his eyes locked on Death, probably wandering why it was not attacking him after what he had done. Harry had the same doubt, but he assumed it had something to do with being a reasonable…thing. It had just brought him back, and it had no reason to take him again “Our souls have always been linked. A perk of soul magic. You had his soul, but it is thanks to that connection that I am here now. How else was I supposed to guide the future container here? I could have been in there for ages if I had not told you where to go”
He woke up on his mother’s couch. He had had the most bizarre dream. He had been in Russia, with Harry, they had…kissed and…oh, Merlin, he was a teenager, having wet dreams, all over again.
He looked at Harry. His Harry.
Harry considered reanimating Draco, but he needed to rest, so he made his wand flicker and took the risk, apparating them on the pick-up point where, instead of Ms. Kozlova, Alexander was waiting for them.
“You can’t go in there, Harry Potter”
“Harry you have to trust me” easier said than done “I can’t hurt you, remember? Now be the brilliant wizard you are supposed to be and keep your mouth shut” it said and just when Harry was going to ask what it meant, a bunch of wizards and witches from the castle started to fill the room through the gap.
“Yes, he has been sick for some time now and we assumed that the potions and spells were working, but then…well, maybe you should see it yourself” she extended her hand and he took it, feeling the familiar pull of side-along apparition.
He opened the water key and stripped himself, taking the bandages off delicately. He grabbed his shampoo and started rubbing his hair, the mint and coconut smell filling the air before he cleared it and applied the mask. He took the soap and started to wash his body carefully, avoiding the stiches, which he was certain were Harry’s domain so he was going nowhere near them. He let the water run down his body for a couple minutes more and finally stepped out. His leg hurt, but it was bearable. He hadn’t taken clothes, so he wrapped a towel around his waist and made his way back to the room while drying his hair with a smaller one.
“You are a terrible healer. I’m so sorry for your weak hearted patients, honestly”
“Yeah, but I though some Internet could come in handy if we want this done quickly and I don’t have it at home” Draco looked at him as if he had grown a couple horns in the middle of the forehead and he had to laugh at that.
“Yes, her. Why is that name so familiar?” Draco asked, more to himself than to the other. It had been in his mind for a while. He had the vaguest feeling he had heard of it before. Well, obviously, it was not an uncommon name, but he was almost sure he was missing a significant piece of information.
“Draco, Harry, it smells lovely” she greeted right before the fire clacked again and her husband came out with his daughter in his arms.
“Is there any kind of memorial?” Draco asked.
“Tell me about it” he told Harry every detail of his dream and he agreed that I made little to no sense “Why would Alexei be in a magical place like that? He had no idea magic existed until now”
“All right, I’ll get it ready for you. Wait here” Draco let him go reluctantly and he stood up. He drew his wand out and located a jar that he transfigured into a big enough bathtub. Then, he filled it with water and took it to the perfect temperature with some spells. He grabbed the muscular-relaxant salts he had in his medical bag and added some scented oils before feeling satisfied with his work. Once done, he helped Draco undress, carried him on his arms and deposited him inside the tub but, when he was going to turn around to leave him alone, his boyfriend grabbed his trousers.
