Fearful was fast asleep in his terrarium, but lifted his head from the coil of his body with a flicker of his tongue, as if sensing trouble. He set his head down again, and Harry blew out a breath.
“Well, what about the elves not at Hogwarts?” Draco asks determinedly. There has to be a way for them to capitalise on elf magic. “There are dozens of families in Britain who still have them, and numerous others on the Continent, I’m sure. If we were able to locate an elf here, it may be able to get us as far as Hogsmeade.”
, oh god, that he might look at
“But — it’s really legal? For Muggles?” Draco asked every five minutes, and drifted back into his own thoughts every time Harry said yes.
“Potter, I c—” Draco gritted his teeth and wrenched away. “We’re not seeing each other anymore.”
Struck by that, Draco glances around. “I haven’t seen anyone,” he says, abruptly uneasy by the fact, “not since…” He gestures over his shoulder.
The green of her eyes was fading. Draco took a step forward.
They didn’t talk about it with anyone.
he’d said.
“I don’t know.” Draco exhales. There’s a heaviness to the sound of his honesty that didn’t exist in the bland explanation he tried to offer. “Granger didn’t say, so we can’t, can we? My theory could stand. It really could. We— We could hold onto that.”
My eyes snapped to his. Fucking liar. Potter had hated me since we were children; there was no way a year of sharing a teaching fellowship would change that. Not if my feelings hadn’t changed— and they emphatically
“And the bandage tape?”
Finally, Draco’s eyes came up. He inhaled slowly, consideringly, and then said, “No,” before turning and walking over to drop into the lone chair on the side of the room. Leaning back and crossing his legs, he propped his elbow on the arm and tucked his hand under his narrow chin.
But you don't really want
“Why did you come back?” Malfoy asked, shifting against Harry and drawing him away from his thoughts. Harry turned to look at him. “You never go to the library to study like the rest of us.”
“The berries were good enough.”
(It would be me, of course. Harry Potter never paid for anything and I knew that for a fact; countless restaurants refused to present him with a cheque when we found ourselves shopping for our classes in Hogsmeade or Diagon Alley, as though they’d rather go bankrupt than take a Sickle from one of the wealthiest wizards alive.)
magic, he's down to a few cans of beans and some overly-salty cured meat. Whoever lived here before — a bachelor, he suspects, due to the lack of family photos, the clothing in their wardrobe, and their lackadaisical philosophy on housekeeping — was overdue to replenish their groceries. They're probably dead now, but Harry can't let himself think about that. Maybe he'll pass a store with a broken door or window and be able to scavenge a bit. He could look for a torch, perhaps.
Accomplishing that quickly, he grabbed his dressing gown from the hook outside the stall and wrapped it around himself before stepping out… only to come face-to-face with Potter, who looked as surprised as Draco felt.
Draco clears his throat and checks out the window. “You were saying?”
Hermione’s voice softens. “I love you.”
The eighth of May. She would have turned seventeen not a week after the final Battle. Which meant— “That’s why you were never charged with anything,” Harry said. “You weren’t of-age.”
Rather than taking it, Harry caught Draco’s wrist and turned it over. Cradling the back of it in his palm, Harry took hold of the cuff of his shirt, that loose, drifty cotton, and glanced up at the slow tightening of Draco’s forearm; Draco met Harry’s eyes, but didn’t move away — permission held in the ether between them, and then granted by Draco’s tiny nod. Keeping his gaze locked on Draco’s, Harry eased the sleeve up one-handed, pushing the material bit by bit until it was bunched in the crook of his elbow. “Can I?”
in front of them, just that we…”
seen at, they buy the groceries they’re able to spot you carrying in pictures; hell, you can’t walk through Diagon Alley without running across some desperate character with a lightning bolt tattooed on their forehead. If you come to me, they will too.” Malfoy dropped his napkin onto his near-empty plate, then pushed it away. He rose, his jumper held fast in one hand. “It’s a win-win, but it’s up to you.”
Afterwards, Draco held him, his chest warming Harry's back. Harry said, "I go back to work on Monday. Let me stay tonight."
wanted.
“Shame. I slept like the dead,” Malfoy said.
— his wand against his palm, a file folder against the outside of his trousered thigh. His lips, tightly pressed, then pulled apart. It's a nervous habit, I think in an attempt to expend some of his inexhaustible energy. He's the noisiest, twitchiest person I know.
“Just two.” One of Draco’s eyebrows lifted, a surprised little quirk. “Been investigating my romantic history?”
in return. “Anything else?”
in that way that leaves Harry wrecked every time he sees it. Open, impish. Beautiful. The real secret Harry's been keeping.
“The— same. What we’ve been doing works, we don’t have to... As long as we both…” Harry shuddered; he should insist on pulling his hands away, should stand up and have this conversation with some distance between them. He curled his fingers, digging them into the soft suede of Draco’s breeches. “Every ten days?”
Besides, if Draco wanted to accuse him of impulsivity, it would only give Harry the opportunity to explain that he was wrong, and Harry liked doing that, too.
“You—” Narcissa caught whatever insult was on the tip of her tongue. “What?”
“Draco.” Harry tried to catch him as he passed, but Draco swerved to give him a wide berth at the last second, leaving Harry grasping at air. The doors to the study slammed behind him, and Harry, hands distinctly empty, turned to the people who were supposed to be his friends. Trying to curb the fury in his voice, he said, “Someone tell me what the
Draco blinked, slowly. A droplet of water sparkled on his eyelashes. “Only when I look at it,” he said.
“What I’d like to know is why,” Draco said. “Not letting me die is one thing — and I’ll confess I’m shocked you’d even bother — but your image couldn’t possibly need the additional bolstering that tending to
Draco points it where Potter gestures. Potter kneels in the dirt, removes several items from his pack one-handed, and pulls out a bulky, wrapped item. Bewildered, Draco takes a look around the dark forest as Potter shakes the thing, whipping his head back around when what Potter’s holding pops out into something bigger, as if extended with a charm. It’s peaked at the top, rounded at each end, and longer than it is wide. Potter replaces the items he’d taken from his bag, glances at Draco’s face, and snorts.
“What, want to kill each other sometimes?” Ron cracked a laugh. “You know better than that.”
“Right,” Draco said, heart slamming hard against his ribcage. Not letting himself think too much about it, he slung the tie around his own neck and tied it. Potter’s lips parted, his chest rising and falling faster.
“You got my return note, then?”
“Fuck you.” Potter twisted his head and scraped his teeth along Draco’s jaw. “Just, seriously, fuck off, you’re on my team, and you’re
For a single, fragmented moment, Draco is so stunned, all he can do is consider the kiss as if from a distance: the urgent pressure of Harry’s lips slanted against his own, the clever, teasing hint of his tongue, the way he tastes. And then Draco stops thinking at all.
“Yes.” Anthony breaks off, throat working silently for a moment as his gaze swerves elsewhere. He takes a deep breath in through his nose, lets it out. When he looks back, he says, "Well. They’re meant to be a gift for her. Her birthday is next week.” He spreads his hands, a helpless little smile crossing his face. “I’ve been… carrying them around.”
..." Dizzy when he fucks against you through your trousers and mouths at your neck with a sharp nip of teeth, his breath skittering raggedly over the saliva left on your skin.
4. To snog Harry Potter.
“More than I have since I promised you I’d be careful,” Harry admits. “And… maybe less. I’m a lot better at my job than I was in my twenties.”
, as though the embers of his pain had caught kindling elsewhere in his body. Malfoy’s cock was long and noticeably stiff through the materials of their pants. He’d removed his trousers along with his robes and shirt, and Harry realised that he was only wearing a set of boxers and a thin undershirt that had ridden up over his belly button; it was a socked foot that rested against Harry’s back, so he must have taken off his shoes as well. His stomach was warm and heaving lightly under Harry’s.
“I do, but—”
The curlicues on the curtains, Teddy’s toy wand. His trainers, left in the middle of the floor. His tiny socks, stuffed into them. And Teddy.
* * *
Potter snorted. “Yeah, that surprised me, too. I guess there was a fine print on the bottom that explained how it would Vanish to the Matching process as soon as it was completed.”
Harry swallowed. “You’re not — about that.”
They look at each other. Several defenses cycle through Harry’s mind — that it hadn’t occurred to him Malfoy had thrown away the note after that happened; that he thought Malfoy might want it one day; that he’d thought it was a kindness. But none of them are true. He’d deliberately not given it much thought at all.
The instance preceding his revelation was foggy in his rush towards death, but Harry did remember that, at first, there’d only been Ron: his exhausted embrace, dragging, rambling reassurances, a scuffle nearby, a snarled “Get your bloody intern hands away from him or I’ll hex you, what are you, sixteen? Where the fuck is—” and a bellowed, “
, and
“What?”
to look like that.
he said, and tightened his hand.
It’s unexpected, the pain that sits heavy in Draco’s chest, like the weight of the air around them — hot, sticky. Uncomfortable. Something he knows he shouldn’t feel because in all truth, he lost his father more than ten years ago. But when Draco was a child… When he was a child, he’d ridden upon his father’s shoulders and felt a prince. And for too long, he’s nurtured the memories of Lucius’s indulgent smile, of a huge, warm hand cupping his cheek, of the soft brush of kisses over his forehead.
get on with it. And I don’t know if Hermione could see what he was thinking — they’re like that sometimes, way more than most people would guess — or if she really did drop her gloves, but either way, the result was Ron stuck with me under the mistletoe. And George… I thought he’d have an embolism, he was laughing so hard, and Bill and Charlie too, and Ginny and Fleur were hooting, and Percy was coughing mulled wine all over his shirt…”
“Yeah.” Potter’s gaze locks with his. He tilts his head, one corner of his mouth quirking up wryly. “But you’re necessary, too. Somehow, you are. So liability or not, I can’t risk something happening to you. I’d prefer to do the fighting, if it comes to that.”
“Of course, of course,” Arthur said heartily. “We can understand that. Can’t we, Molly?” He looked at Molly, eyes widening significantly. Molly’s lower lip wobbled and Harry stomach pitched, but then she squared her shoulders.
“Well, it didn’t amuse her father, who I’ve been told ensures that there are six months worth of red tape any time one of our investigations leads us into Spain,” Harry snapped. “Mariana was barely eighteen, on her first trip out to London, and dancing with the one person whose identity pretty much guaranteed photos would make it back to her local papers.”
They were years out of school and Malfoy couldn’t stop behaving like a jeering child. Harry’s irritation at that had him slapping the contract onto the table rather harder than necessary, rattling Malfoy’s plate.
Malfoy smirks, a little meanly. “What a devoted protector of the helpless you are, Potter.”
I have no idea where my smile comes from, but I don't even want to hide it. A hint of amusement touches me. Suddenly, I'm not nervous at all.
, yes. Teach Malfoy a lesson. Ruffle his feathers, too. Maybe make him cry out a bit. Or a lot.
“Thank you,” he said roughly, muffled. Then: “I’m sorry.”
Harry snorted and let Malfoy adjust his arm so he could lie back against it. Once he was settled, Harry admitted, “I didn’t really have to come back. I wanted to be an Auror; I still do, I think, and there will be a spot for me when I’m ready for it. I just wanted…”
“Yeah.” Potter doesn’t make him finish, doesn’t ask any questions. He simply continues sweeping the stained cloth over Draco’s chest and stomach, his chin and collarbone and wrists, pausing every now and then to wet the material and wring it out again, until Draco’s exhaustion presses on him once more. He wants to doze off, but when he’s aware of his need for sleep, it’s more difficult. He thinks about Potter instead, Potter washing him, so enigmatic, as though this is a service he’s accustomed to performing upon people he once hated. Thinks of how Potter is really, truly here.
"When do I get to practise with you?" Harry asked him.
Draco sounded amused at the presumption, but not displeased. “I have my own vault. It’s not what it once was, granted, but it’s enough to purchase—” He pressed the backs of his fingers against Harry’s shoulder. “—an indulgence or two.” His voice softened, wistful as a secret. “I should hope.”
“I couldn’t even use my— I had to throw a
After a quick detour to set her files down in Poppy’s office, Hermione slips behind the curtain shrouding Narcissa’s bed. She takes a seat and waits, watching Narcissa, who doesn’t even deign to look up from her book. She’s been well-kept, and any normal person might show a measure of gratitude, but then, the Malfoys have never really been normal, have they? Never even approached it. Always haughty, no matter how low they’ve been brought. Always dangerous, no matter how defenceless they are.
“Wait, that’s—”
under house arrest. In the Manor, confronted by— Every single day, while all of my friends were able to move away and move on. And the very
It wasn’t treacle tart, but it was delicious nonetheless.
“That’s what Robards said.”
“It means I’m not going to get the promotion I’ve been working my arse off for,” Harry said wryly. He let the knowledge of it settle, quiet and unavoidable, inside him. It felt to weigh about a thousand tonnes, and he was abruptly glad he hadn’t eaten anything; there probably wouldn’t even have been room.
It’s not the cleanest lake he’s ever been in, a murky green-blue, and far colder than it felt while dipping his hands into it to wash their clothing, but it’s refreshing, too. Draco ducks his head under the surface and comes up. He cleans his hair, his body. Layer by later, he strips the grime away until he feels a little less like the refugee he is. When he’s finished, he looks for Potter and sees flashes of his blue shirt just beyond the trees, so he indulges himself and sets off to swim along the bank line, checking periodically with his feet to ensure he doesn’t accidentally swim into deep waters. It feels good to move in a way his body doesn’t have to think about, a way his muscles recognise. The jogging he used to do every day before all this to stay fit has been more of a duty, a chore — and one grudgingly committed to, at that — but to hear his mother tell it, he'd learned to swim before he’d learned to walk. Unfortunately, the bylaws regarding wizarding space don’t make room for extending his balcony to build a lap pool, not in the middle of London where Muggles are packed in like sardines, at least.
Draco made a stifled sound and said, “You’re not the only one allowed to make stupid decisions sometimes,” and Harry swallowed the hard knot rising in his throat. Draco’s jaw tightened. Barely moving his lips, he said, “I’m fairly sure Greg won’t be able to measure you with those hanging off your hips.”
. Voice low and breathless against Harry’s mouth, his body pressed flat against the padded piano bench after Harry went in search of haunting strains of music drifting throughout the house, his fingers flying as fast on Harry’s flies as they’d flown over the ivory keys:
“So I gathered in the shower.” Draco’s eyes drop to Harry’s towel with a pointed look. He runs his tongue over his bottom lip
“I apologise if I interrupted,” Audrina murmured as they began dancing. “You two were simply dashing, but dancing with a woman can be a bit different — as you must know, since the—”
Harry smiles bitterly and reaches for his own bag. He wishes he could tell Ron how much better about that he is these days.
Draco laughed, Delighted Thing and Self-Congratulatory Thing (which he hadn’t felt in any real way since fifth year) fighting for space. “
The boeuf bourguignon was only a little burned.
“And here I thought you might simply offer to step aside,” Harry said, “in exchange for not going to Azkaban.”
“Let me, Harry,” he says. Potter’s flat stomach ripples; he hesitates. Draco swallows and presses his cheek to Potter’s, breathes it directly into his ear. “
“Well, it might help in a specific
Harry found the term funnier than he perhaps should have. If it had been a fight at all — and Harry was abruptly unsure of that — then Malfoy had undoubtedly won the round. He thought of saying
Ron hesitated, then admitted, “He seemed right shocked at first.”
none.”
“No,” Draco said after a pause, stroking gentle and thoughtful through Harry’s hair. “We’d both have to take them off when we were on duty, anyway. Besides, wearing a ring would only get in the way of my social life, and if that’s the best you can do,” he said, with an insolent smile and a sidelong glance that slipped slow down Harry’s body, “I’m really going to need one.”
Drowning,
Harry snorted, abruptly too weary to take offense. It was a stupid thing to get upset over, as though school Houses still mattered — as though they ever should have.
“And—” Draco’s lips tightened; he pulled out four slender phials, three of them caught cleverly between the fingers of his hand, one held to his palm with his thumb — a blood regeneration potion, Harry thought, taking it when Draco popped the cork and passed it over. Draco waited until the phial was empty, then handed Harry another and gestured for Harry’s hand again. Peeling the gauze away as Harry swallowed the second potion, he took up Harry’s wand once more and said, “And— Fuck, Harry, I don’t know.”
,” Draco said over the sound of Harry’s hysterics. “You obviously—”
This is
Draco’s breath comes out soft, measured. He spreads his index and middle fingers wider, and moves them up and down, on either side of his cock. “Tell me,” he breathes, “what we’re going to do.”
Granger crosses her arms over her chest and gives Narcissa an abbreviated nod to proceed. Narcissa takes a breath and… falters. Granger narrows her eyes, but Narcissa’s hesitation is unexpected and entirely unfeigned. She drops both hands back into her lap and momentarily feels as lost as she had the afternoon Lucius appeared before her in her own study, his beautiful grey eyes bright for the first time in years. Too bright — fevered; aglow with terrifying purpose. That she might be forced to betray him in this manner had not been a consideration until today. Nor had she been prepared to feel as though it
Draco took it, those bold Gryffindor colours almost glowing in his fist. He looked at Potter, who nodded, lashes lowered.
“I wanted you,” Harry says. “I didn’t know I wanted you before then.”
"Well, I don't know," Potter says, a groove dug between his eyebrows. "I get hunches, you connect them."
Outtake one:
His throat is tight. Pansy rests on her back, the colour of her lips garish now against her grey face. A sheet has been draped over her up to her chin and it’s darkly stained at the neck, but both hands under the sheet rest over her chest, and her hair looks as though it’s been freshly tended to. Angling the torch to the side, Harry finds a brush with a mother-of-pearl handle, raven strands caught in the bristles. He turns away, props himself against the wall, and reminds himself to breathe.
“My father’s caretaker can barely keep him clothed and safely in his rooms at the Manor, so I wouldn’t put it past him,” Malfoy says sourly. He clamps his lips shut and closes his eyes for a moment, exhaling. “That was—”
“I know.”
made Harry react before he could control himself. He almost wished he could pretend that the objection made had been about the nature of Blaise’s shop, or the aging Wizengamot’s discomfort with his sexual preferences — but no. “You mean Draco,” Harry said, pleased when his voice came out steady.
Harry hesitated. But before he could make up his mind whether to respond on his own, Narcissa said, “Lucius, please go ensure the elves have lit the fires in our parlour and bedroom.” She pulled her wand from the miniscule handbag dangling from her wrist and touched her robes with a murmur, the gossamer material unfurling to drape around her shoulders in a makeshift cape. Glancing up to find her husband still there, she adopted a tone of surprise. “I’ll be right along, my dear.”
“Yes, thank you,” Draco said.
The front of Harry’s neck crawled with heat, rising over his jaw. To his cheeks. Explaining that Draco had made soup for him Saturday night would do nothing for him — nor would relating how, when Draco mentioned that anyone could heat something in a tin and Harry’s spoon had clattered back into the bowl with a splash, Draco had only paused for a bare second to study Harry’s face before climbing back out of bed with the tray.
Harry gives him a hard, searching look. He opens his mouth, brow knitting, but the moment is lost when he quickly shakes his head and returns to task. He buckles their packs securely and puts one over his shoulders. Draco puts on the other, strangely bereft. They’ll have to abandon the tent; as protection from the touch of Inferi go, it’s pathetic, but it’s been the only one they’ve had. Neither will they be able to take the blanket and lamp — still unpacked, they’re not worth the risk it’ll take to Shrink and tuck them away — and the thought of leaving their few, spare comforts behind is harder than it should be.
I meet his eyes and say, "Keep the spatula."
“Good,” he said instead. “I mean— not that she didn’t. But that Snape did.”
“For not noticing,” he said. He tapped the breast pocket of his robes, Draco’s secret tucked inside. “That you weren’t…”
faltered under an onslaught of offensive magic.
Bastard. “Pardon me for not having had twenty-seven years to get used to the idea. Did you even lose any of yours?”
“But McGonagall wants us to meet,” Potter finally said.
“No, right, don’t hurt them,” Harry says lamely, “but, god, I can’t—” He presses his knuckles to the hollows of his eyes; gets ahold of himself. “Ron, can I talk to Ron too? Am I on speaker? Draco and I have a suspicion, Ron will know how to access the Auror resources to see if we’re right, if he can get— Ron?” There’s another long silence, so long Harry pulls the phone from his ear to make sure the call hasn’t been cut off, almost dropping it in his haste to bring it back up when he hears Hermione’s voice.
“What?”
“Potter, have you been under the impression we’re an
too much, cataloguing the multitude of Harry’s tells that only a real lover should be privy to, once Harry gave into the relief of him.
Draco sets himself to task, finding each item with relative ease, considering how many things Potter’s got stuffed in there. It occurs to him that he’s left his files back at the hotel, his diary. Not that they’d be of any use. They’re already carrying far more than they probably should. His own bag is packed to the brim with his clothing and other personal items, and he decides to discard several of them in the morning before they head on; they can disburse Potter’s bag more evenly to share the load.
Hermione smiles wider. “Would you like to speak to him too?”
“Whatever that may be.” Draco shifted. The floor was cold under them, but the outside of Draco’s thigh pressed warm against Harry’s under the shared duvet. “Is wandmaking a sufficiently modest occupation for you, then?”
badge.
“Tell me you hate me,” he said, face hovering above mine. “Say it.”
Pobble steps closer, one ear nervously twirled around one long finger. Hermione watches, her stomach twisting in on itself, as Pobble stretches her free hand towards Narcissa.
Harry sat back, hands flat against Malfoy’s fuzzy blanket, and looked at the bike as he thought it over. They’d propped it carefully against the gnarled trunk of the tree it rested under for who-knew-how long. Clean and shiny, the frame and handlebars looked good, but they had to wait for the Muggle things Harry had ordered before they could do much else to it; apparently, it was a bad idea to Transfigure moving parts when you actually hoped to use something long-term.
“So you won’t catch a chill,” he says at Draco’s lifted brow, then hesitates. There’s a new comfort between them that does nothing to quench the desire he’s been living with or the happiness pervading him, but a new awkwardness, too. He’s not sure how to ask some of the things he wants to know. He tweaks the lapel of Draco’s dressing gown. “This is nice.”
Harry snorted. The constant churn in his stomach relented, for the first time in hours. He drew out his dressing robe and darted another cautious look to Draco. His lips were pulled up in a half smile, his expression wry.
“Me, what?” Harry asked, startled. Ron’s finger was so close to his nose, he had to cross his eyes to see it.
The tent shudders at a blast of wind, and Draco hears the faintest howl in the distance over the sound of the rain — like a werewolf baying at the moon. It’s almost surely the weather, but a tremble slips down his spine, regardless.
Greengrass Public Relations
Pansy went into his arms, pressing her face against his chest with a sob. “I’m so glad you’re okay.”
“How proletarian of you, Draco,” Lucius said with a sniff. He thumped the tip of his cane against the rug and gave Harry a flat stare. “I don’t suppose this elf of yours will have our meal ready any time
“The wards,” he says again. “She’s got to be creating a pocket in them, a hole. Whatever signal the mobile sends will have to find it. She means for us to use a locator spell. Over the Quidditch pitch would be the most likely place. The wards extend higher there to allow for games, so they’re likely a little weaker, more malleable. Still, it’ll require a tremendous amount of energy if she’s to do it without shattering the wards completely. I can’t imagine where she’ll be getting that from, but if you really think she’ll be ready early, I’d call her now.”
“Fine. When I think about you…” Harry gives it some thought. “Sometimes more, sometimes less. But that’s about right.” He settles back against the pillows again, smiling wider, and keeps his hand curled around the high arch on the top of Draco’s foot, relaxing a little. He hums under his breath, considering whether he should say it, then figures there’s no reason not to. “You wear knickers. Frequently. Every day, I think.”
Which will be Harry’s death knell, he might as well say. Hermione’s studied the maps; though no one has been able to posit a guess as to why the Inferi are so drawn to the spot, the travel tunnels are thick with them, and the area around the entrance to the service tunnel, crowded dark. The spell will only buy Harry and Malfoy moments, but they’ll be precious ones. If Harry tries to get there without a magical assist, he’ll have no chance for survival. And neither will Malfoy.
“As long as we can eat on the way.”
“What’s your point?”
“You should— go,” she says. Her voice sounds funny. Strained. Clearing her throat, she tries again. “Talk to Anthony and then, um. Go find Hannah for breakfast. You probably haven’t got to spend much time together since…” She makes a vague gesture and forces a laugh when Neville gives her an emphatic nod. He says something she doesn’t quite catch, gives her arm a friendly squeeze, and heads out.
“He said you would,” Harry says, confident in the truth behind his lie. “He said that because you cared so much, he had no doubt.”
"That's good." Ron pauses, long enough for Harry to glance at him. His black eye has faded, the gash across his brow and cheek healed. "But what about… Y'know."
you,” he hissed, pumping faster. Everything was so fucking wet, the cling of Malfoy’s inner muscles around him so different than how sex had felt before, in every way he’d barely let himself contemplate. His thighs were trembling with heat, his lower back prickling, Malfoy’s cock pushing up against his stomach from where it was caught between them. He didn’t want it to feel good, but—
The spasm of pain in his chest increases, and Draco unsuccessfully tries to swallow the sound that breaks from his throat. Panting, he opens his eyes to discover Harry’s trembling hands have moved into his line of sight, hovering around the mobile.
“Don’t even think about touching me.”
“Harry!” Weasley shouted, smacking the door a few more times. “Are you in there?”
“I forgot you could do that,” a voice rasped.
There’s a grim irony there, and Draco huffs an acknowledgement of it against his temple. His fingers dance over the hair on Harry’s thigh, and then he flattens his hand and strokes up Harry’s stomach. He traces Harry’s belly-button in the waiting silence, rolls one of Harry’s nipples between thumb and forefinger. His touch is light and unobtrusive, but a sensation Harry can fixate on, to get through the rest.
Malfoy waits for an answer, dragging the hem of his t-shirt up and wiping his face with it, like someone might in the training gym. It’s a strangely familiar gesture, and Harry sits back on his hands, refusing to be bothered by that as well. He knows he’s got no reason to be, other than because it displays the scars Harry gave him so long ago, and even that’s nothing in the face of what’s coming — or
“Me too,” Harry said with an easy smile. He sat down and propped his boots on the edge of Robards’ desk, smile widening when Robards’ eyebrows flew up. “We have a lot to talk about.”
Dropping his gaze, Harry leaned in. He darted a lick over the pearl of moisture clinging to the tip, felt Draco inhale, hold, exhale, one of Draco’s hands creeping out to slide over Harry’s shoulders, the spread of his legs widening. He smelled warm, his scent softer here than the crisp notes of the aftershave he wore under his jaw. Harry licked him again, slower, a flat stripe from where Draco’s fingers covered to the tip, rolling his gaze up in time to see the flare of heat on Draco’s face, identical to the one he felt streaking through him. And then he opened his mouth and lowered, descending to take his cock in, inch by inch.
“Get in there,” Draco said, avoiding his eyes. He tucked his hand back into his pocket. “Yes, we should.”
“I have
But even as the words ran through my mind, I couldn’t process them. And then Potter’s mouth was covering mine, and… well, that took a bit longer to process. So long that Potter’s tongue, still faintly sweet from the treacle tart he’d consumed after dinner, managed to coax my mouth open; so long that when I finally recovered my senses enough to push him away, I had to unlock my arms from around Potter’s waist first. I wiped at my mouth, slick with Potter’s kiss. “What the hell are you doing?”
Eras passed and the earth cooled. Life sprang up around them, creatures swam from the seas to grow legs and stand tall, and nature flourished, all because of the magic they had spilled over the lands in their anger. One day, a man plucked a stem from a tree to sculpt into an image from his dreams: the first wand.
, fuck,
The dull, patterned carpet is nubby under Draco’s socked feet. Uncushioned, as though the decorator simply installed the least expensive flooring they could find over a slab of concrete, and unpleasantly worn too, from years of being trod upon without care. Draco curls his toes into it and takes a breath.
Only to turn around at the sound of the gnome's rumbling, perverted laughter.
Draco aimed a wicked smile at him that thickened Harry’s poor, neglected prick for the thousandth time, yet all he said was, “Every person is a potential client.”
“I was about to say that I’m going to stay in Ron’s room tonight. We’re heading out in the morning, early,” Potter murmured when his laughter stopped. He pressed a damp kiss to Draco’s collarbone, lips drifting downward as he parted Draco’s shirt again. Licking over Draco’s nipple, he said, “We’ve got plans to spend Christmas Eve with the Weasleys, and we’ve not had much of a chance to talk lately. So I hope you’ll be here tomorrow night when I come back, instead of moving in with Parkinson.”
, and, “
“I’ll do it,” Malfoy said. Harry jumped in place, horrified and turned on and not nearly as angry as he probably should be that Malfoy was using Legilimency on him — but after a second that went on for about six years, he was able to unscramble his brain enough to realise that Malfoy hadn’t noticed anything. Harry tried to make the grab for his pillow look casual, putting it over his lap and pasting on his most earnest smile. Malfoy cleared his throat. “But I have some conditions.”
“There’s more than one way to leave someone bleeding out, though.” Harry swallows. “Isn’t there?”
That day changed everything for them — to the point where she wondered, occasionally, how deeply she could have possibly loved him before it. And almost nine months later, things changed again, securing her love for him further when she saw the tender look in his eyes as he held their son for the first time.
” he hisses, shaking him. “I ordered you to run!”
“I did warn you,” he says, with a smirk so fond it can hardly be qualified as one. Harry chokes on another laugh and sets his glasses back.
“Where was it?”
If he’d held any hope Malfoy’s reaction would equal how big it felt to say, Malfoy dashed it immediately; he gave Harry a small nod and said, “I know.”
Too many responses roll through Draco: how unfair that is, what a lie. What a weak little shit Harry can be for someone with such a golden reputation. The temptation to return to form is almost overwhelming. But he finds himself suddenly tired, unwilling to engage in the sort of battle they once might have indulged in, if Harry still thought him worthy of one.
Draco frowned, a careful thing with one side of his lips. Making automatic adjustments for his pain. “No one just stops being a Parselmouth.” He cleared his throat, then pointedly added, “
, wet enough now from Potter’s saliva and his own to ease the way. Potter gasped and pushed a little harder. “—just a little bit,” he said.
Potter looked a little startled, but nodded again after a beat. “Yeah. But it smells better in here than it ever did when she made it.”
“I love you too,” Harry says, looking out over the field. “And Ron. Rose, Hugo. And tell Ron— Tell him to be there for the next call, okay, and—”
* * *
Hermione shakes her head. “Will this ruin your new—? Um. The hybrid flowers you’ve been planning on putting into your next research paper?”
. He sliced it with his wand and tied it off.
, and the sudden need to be covered in it. To claim it.
” Harry heard behind him, pleased when he closed the door faster than Draco could get the rest out.
But discussions about that sort of thing were harder than this revel in sensation, and Harry had always been better at the illustration than the account. His first year in primary school, he’d brought in two toys for his turn at show and tell, Tommies of Dudley’s that he’d fished from the bin. He’d been stumped when asked to tell the room why they were special to him.
Malfoy assessed them both, looking comfortable with his chin held at such a haughty angle, even if it was Harry’s wand doing the holding. His gaze slid sideways.
“Then…” Malfoy pushed away from the counter, a slow kindle of interest flaring in his eyes. They widened, a lick of anticipation darkening in them, that trace of his smile returning. “You’re done fighting it?”
Draco stands by the Floo, looking more surprised to see Harry than Harry is at his presence. He’s got on a sooty black tuxedo, the bowtie loose around his collar, the first three buttons of his shirt undone. The cords of his throat stand out above his exposed collarbone, and his hair is tousled around his face.
“I’ll leave you to it,” Astoria said with a light touch to his elbow. Unable to drag his gaze from Draco, he saw the amusement in her smile from his periphery, but when she spoke, her voice was kind. “I should be getting in there; you’re not my only client here tonight, you know.”
Or so he thought, until Potter said, “God, no. I’d be mad to tell Ron right now,” before sucking Draco’s fattening prick into the slippery heat of his mouth and working his head up and down.
“You don’t have any clue what I was about to say,” Draco says, lips turning down in a sulky little bow.
Harry slowly peels his hand away from his cock as the need to come subsides, before his grip can turn into a massage. He’s already too worked up. “You like dirty talk.”
* * *
“Fuck you,” Draco spat, kissing him once more in a way entirely different than they had on his bed, no longer dreamy and lost in it, but boiling with all the resentment and rage he’d had festering in him for days and possibly
Someday soon, he will.
That’ll worry Harry later, probably. He pushes the thought aside and says the thing he’s never said before: “You owe me, Draco. And I want to collect.”
Harry dreams of lifting Teddy onto his shoulders. He’s sturdy and warm and laughing; squirming, he reaches for the sky, and Harry wants more than anything to be happy with him. Only he can’t keep a firm grasp on Teddy’s shins, and Teddy is so unsteady, and Harry is so, so afraid. He looks to the cushioning charms spread out around the playground, but they’re all twisted as thorns and wickedly sharp, not a single soft landing among them, the playground nowhere near as safe as it’s supposed to be. Harry clutches desperately at Teddy, unable to move for fear of killing them both, and then he spots Malfoy sitting on a nearby bench, and everything stills.
Seconds tick by like hours, measured by the drum of Harry’s heartbeat. And then the door opens. The lack of barrier strips everything away — logic and uncertainty, even Draco’s last name. Harry’s not aware of striding to him, just that he
like seeing it?”
No longer able to stall if he wants to say goodnight before Teddy falls back to sleep, Harry heads back upstairs but finds Teddy’s room empty. Worried, he goes back into the hallway and hears Malfoy’s soft voice, coming from his room. Harry feels a bit creepy, but can’t resist pausing once more outside the door, this time to eavesdrop.
Draco smiled in a soft, helpless way that made Harry’s heart flip over. “Genevieve,” he murmured. “She was seven. Behavioral problems, she refused to listen to her mum, got into tempers at the dinner table. It was mostly boredom; she was happier after I got her involved in a creative playgroup. I worked for her family, stayed with them for six months. She was fascinated by the tattoos, so I made it an incentive: if she applied herself to my lessons, she could pick one for me when my contract was up. She liked pineapples.”
“Now. Five things you can feel. Or smell, or see, or— Whatever, give me a list.”
table, having to put up with someone who’s
“By all means.” Harry spreads his hands, yielding the floor. Draco gives him a smug look.
to fetch it from across the hall. Draco stirred when he returned, voice thick with sleep.
, and felt seen by him. He treasured Ron and Hermione's loyalty, but at times felt guilty for allowing them to foster such a blind faith in his goodness. Draco saw that the goodness in Harry was something he'd collected in scraps, and had to cling to at times, rather desperately; Draco saw the tattered, ugly stains of Harry's life alongside his goodness, and he could make room for both. He always seemed to know without being told when one of Harry’s cases went awry, and always knew what to do about the turbulent magic seething through Harry’s veins because of it, whether that meant listening patiently while Harry ranted about work, or repairing shattered windows without batting an eye, or stripping them both down and making himself an offering Harry could spill his frustration into.
“Yes.” Draco released his shirt and cupped Harry’s jaw from under his chin. He spread his fingers on one side, his thumb digging painfully into the other, and raised Harry’s face a touch as if about to kiss him. There was no time to be disappointed when he didn’t; Draco held him there and ran his free hand down Harry’s chest and stomach. He lifted Harry’s shirt and paused to crook his finger into the waistband of Harry’s jeans, tugging, then let go and continued — past Harry’s belt, down to the bulge of his erection. “An explanation, is that what you want?”
Harry turned to him, swallowing. Ron stared out the window at his side, nodding a bit to himself.
He needed to, and so he didn’t. He sat with the impulse instead, because it felt as wretched as Malfoy’s voice had sounded. He sat with his wand out, ready to do it and holding himself back, because he’d already blasted enough things to splinters for one night. Twenty-one years old, and half the time he still felt like he had at fifteen, relishing the destruction of Dumbledore’s office. Half the time, that was still his first response, the only way he knew to feel better when he was faced with any feeling he didn’t like.
“Tell me you love me,” Harry says, studying his face. He doesn’t really need to hear it, but wants Draco to keep talking.
“Yeah, hi. Where’s Draco?”
“You’ve been pretty thoughtful about your gifts to Ron,” Potter offered after a moment. “My Hufflepuff likes… stuff for his hair. Potions and gels and things.”
bothered, a little demon in Harry prompted him to defend Paul. "To be fair, the vase is decorated with gnomes copulating. He couldn't have known how rude it was to wank on it."
“Was it a big… project?”
The game devolved. With the introduction of the Bludgers Draco had charmed to intermittently aim for them over the pitch, by the second hour, Draco had to resort to desperate measures just to stay in the air. He didn’t cheat — a Bludger narrowly skimmed his shoulder just as he was reaching for the Snitch forty feet up in the air, forcing him to set a new course and let the Snitch escape — but he didn’t pull any punches, either.
“And you know so much about people imprisoned in a...”
Flipping Draco two decidedly unsubtle, resentful fingers, Paul scampered out. Harry looked at Draco. "See? He's not that big a problem."
It took years for Harry to realise Sirius had been making a promise to him — years after the Veil had swallowed him whole, taken him away. He’d tried his hardest not to think of it since, but, stroking through Draco’s hair, Sirius’ voice drifted back to him like a talisman, incorporeal, dear.
“Thank you for the invitation,” Blaise said.
“Tell me,” Draco says. There’s a new edge to his voice, some mix of how he sounds after those charged silences that happen sometimes between them, and how he’d sounded in the bathroom before sending Harry away. Harry flicks a glance to his face — Draco’s cheeks are flushed, his kiss-bitten lips shining and parted. His gaze is hot and fixed on Harry’s cock in his hand. Draco licks his lips. “Tell me what you want.”
Potter was. After he’d taken Draco’s elbow to the ribs, he’d settled his hands on Draco’s hips. Draco tried not to look too smug; these were Potter’s friends, after all.
Mortified, he tries to regulate his breathing. Listens to the sound of the chimes. By the time Malfoy spells them off, Harry’s erection is — mostly — under control. His imagination, however…
“Right now? Nothing at all.” Harry drained his drink. “You?” He looked at Draco, something hot and expectant simmering the air between them. Draco’s gaze dropped and Harry sat back; he hadn’t realised he’d leaned closer.
An hour and a half later, Draco shook his head at Potter’s lazy offer to head to the bedroom, righted his clothes again, and hobbled to the Floo. Finally home, he spent the next two days wanking and resolving never to be alone with Potter again.
There’s an answer to that, but Harry decides to ignore it for now. “I can make us breakfast in a bit.”
"I kissed her. When she fussed about it, about being you," Bill said, leaning in a little — lowering his voice to a hush. “I kissed her in your body, pulled her close. Felt her respond how you might have.”
"I will
you are,” Malfoy said, an exasperated set to his jaw. “At least keep me apprised, if you insist on this nonsense. When you walk into a room filled with slumbering curses, I want to be able to point you in the direction of the one likely to kill you the fastest, and win my freedom.”
Kreacher, apparently less concerned with ruining Harry’s life than a good elf ought to be, nodded. “Mister Longbottoms is being waiting; he is trying to leave when Kreacher is telling him that Masters of the House are not up yet, but Kreacher is checking the clock and saying no, he is on time, Masters Harry and Draco will be upset if he is going, there is celebrations to attend, and so he is waiting with the nog Kreacher is giving him.

Harry pressed his lips together. That— grated. “Does he know that?”
“I know. I’m sorry,” he said automatically, a ripple of guilt streaking through him when she smiled and shrugged. She set down the napkins and lifted her wand once more, clearing one of her guest chairs of the folders stacked atop it and sending them to rest, precariously, on a different stack near the door.
There was literally no way this day could get worse.
Despite the worried frown Malfoy gives him, it feels a bit like an accusation. Harry bristles. “Prophecies are part of
In the fading light, Draco can't make out the colour of Potter’s eyes — but he can see that they’re leveled right at him. Potter breaks their gaze and crouches to root around in their supplies, coming back with their dwindling bag of almonds. He tosses it and it lands with a gentle thump next to Draco’s hip.
Ron contemplated him, orange brows drawing together. He sat down in a side chair and glanced around the library for a footstool. Not finding one, he tossed a sofa pillow to the floor and swiftly Transfigured it with a flick of his wand, then stretched out to prop his feet up. “All right,” he said seriously. “What do you think’s happened?”
I really did hate him. I hated the easy, friendly smile that creased his face, and the stupid jokes he made about how I’d tempted him into midnight duels at the age of eleven as though our entire history was so damned amusing. I hated the flare of heat I could always feel from his magic, even for the simplest of spells (not to mention what it felt when I saw him duel). Most of all I hated how he could instantly revert me to that fifteen year old boy again, sneering and smug for getting the final parting shot.
“But now?”
“He’s always been like that about Malfoy,” Weasley said. His eyes flared with accusation, and Potter, interestingly enough, flushed.
pile. Harry retrieved those too; they were comfortable. Malfoy glanced over his shoulder and huffed. “And for several days hence.”
“We all do, Malfoy. We just don’t like to admit it, because that would mean acknowledging what they’re for,” Potter murmurs. A birdcall sounds from nearby and they both fall quiet to listen to it.
Malfoy hops up. Gritting his teeth, Harry does too — watching Malfoy's languid stretch. It displays the soft, white-blond curls under his arms and lifts the hem of his shirt to bare a strip of pale skin. His nipples are tight through the cotton of his tank. Peaked. Harry looks away, refusing to visit Paris twice in one morning, and Malfoy drops his arms with a low, quiet chuckle.
me to.”
The Malfoys and Luna sat across from Harry and the Weasleys, Hermione and the solicitor in the two side chairs bracketing the sofas. It made it impossible not to see Malfoy unless Harry wanted to twist his head to stare out the window behind him. Malfoy’s mouth was closed tight, his lips white around the edges. He straightened his shoulders — stood up tall — and extended his wrist across the table between them.
He breaks off, some part of him hoping Draco will bitch at him for the gnat comment, but Draco remains silent. Harry can feel Draco’s gaze on the side of his face like a brand.
Your prick swells at the memory. You'd like a wank, yourself — another, that is. You spent your weekend doing it, when they were done with the damn tests. You could only produce a nominal amount of your own lubricant after the heat, had to resort to Conjuring some over your fingers before fucking yourself with them. Thinking about Potter, his smile and heated laugh. His cock, his knot. The utter rotter. No one else had ever made you feel so good.
generous,” he says, stifled. “I needed it. And it was… fantastic.”
“And now?”
“He really
The snap of his hips gets faster. You cry out, drool slipping down your chin at the thought of taking it. You nod feebly, pliant and aching. You've never been so hard in your life.
“And you want to fuck me,” he murmured. I couldn’t even be bothered trying to dignify that with the response that came to mind:
yoga, all right?”
” Harry said. “That was me being your— friend.”
Still, Potter seemed to take the question seriously. He mumbled, “When will I tell you?”
“She doesn’t really have off days,” Harry admitted, albeit more than a little grudgingly. “Unless she’s angry with me and I don’t know it — but she usually lets me know.” And he still had all of his body hair, which Harry felt was a pretty good indicator. He went quiet as the waitress brought over two more drinks and their food, some sort of delicate risotto with asparagus for Malfoy, and what looked like an entire chicken off the bone and mashed potatoes for Harry. Everything was topped in a creamy sauce that floated whole mushrooms through it, and as the scent wafted up to meet him, Harry’s stomach rumbled, mortifyingly loud. “This looks good.”
Setting Harry’s hands firmly on his hips, Draco reached back between them. He cupped Harry’s cock through his jeans and rolled his head on Harry’s shoulder. “What?” he murmured. “Tell me what you want.”
But if
Passing over his weapon in one hand, Draco takes Harry’s in the other. A pinch of pain tugs at his heart, but… it's only a pinch. The extreme shudder of torment that he’s been associating with his wand has lessened significantly since Harry’s begun working with him in this capacity. He prefers Harry’s — the sturdier hilt, the lighter heft of metal to the blade — but thinks that’s precisely what these training sessions are about: his preferences are beside the point.
“Yeah,” Draco says again. He rubs a hand over his hair. He probably looks a mess. It feels like he does, though part of that comes from the shaky uncertainty pulsing through him in the aftermath of sex, his mind stuck on the way nothing seemed to matter but his release, and Potter’s, the way the smell of sweat and arousal had blurred out the pain. Draco hasn’t even heard her voice today. He swallows. “Does that mean—?”
serious relationship, to the point of considering Significant Jewelry. She refused, however, to discuss specifics, merely saying that nothing is yet set in stone and— cont. on page six.
“You weren’t even
“What? For what? Who?”
He continues, warm breath feathering the hair at Harry’s temple, one hand idly stroking over Harry’s replete, tingling bollocks and playing with his spent cock. Harry listens with half an ear, about how Pansy had laughed upon walking in on Draco with someone else, but then later said she needed some time to focus on work. About how much Draco’d wanted their affair to have been a lark, something he’d even convinced himself they might be able to revisit it on occasion once everything had stabilised between them.
They were both half-hard. Harry didn’t know when that had happened; he hadn’t had the motivation for a decent wank since the contract unfurled, and was sore all over from their scuffle, besides. From their position on the floor, Harry couldn’t see the mirror, but he could only imagine how he looked based on the throb of his jaw and the smoulder of pain spreading over his ribs, intensifying with each second they spent locked together the way they were — and if he had to guess, Malfoy felt even worse.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Draco asks stiffly. He crosses his arms over his chest. “They won’t…” He flushes, so suddenly and fully that Harry has to bite the inside of his cheek to keep from laughing. It's obvious, from belligerent angle of Draco's chin, that he’s about to double-down. Git. Draco huffs. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“Parts of it, anyway.” Harry hears the resentment in his own voice and does what he can to minimise it. “Which is good. I’d rather have—” Here, he falters. This is the part where acknowledging things gets difficult, where his throat always runs dry.
Narcissa’s eyes widened; her lips rounded into a soundless ‘o’. Harry got to enjoy it for all of two seconds before the splintering of wood down the hallway drew his attention.
“I’ll just hold it for you then, shall—”
“No,” Harry said. “I mean, Hermione asked if you wouldn’t mind joining us, and Neville…”  Neville’s return letter had been bewildered, appalled, full of anxiety-ridden enquiries and assurances:
And stops.
“Draco—”
“Draco,” Harry gasped above him, close, “I love—”
Draco smirks. “Alcohol.” He cheerfully continues torturing Harry half-to-death for about a year, then sits back on his heels and frowns.
~ ~ ~
“I found myself at a loose end,” Harry said conversationally. “I had a date, you know the sort. He cancelled, so I ended up basically torturing his best mate.” Draco’s head twitched with an instinctive turn to face him, but he reined it in. Harry walked over to the side of the bed and sat on the edge behind him, stretching out his legs as the bed frame creaked. “It didn’t make my list of top five evenings ever, but I was worried, you see.”
“It’s different,” Harry says. He meets Draco’s eyes. “You might not believe me, but it’s different now. I won’t hurt you. I know I won’t.”
, I still... Anyway.”
“Yes, precisely,” Malfoy says. “Crying is always okay when you need to, no matter what anyone else ever tells you, and especially when you feel disappointed after having worked so hard to master something and finding that you haven’t yet, or when you’re scared, or for any reason at all if it might make you feel better.”
“Okay.”
“Fuck. Yes,” Draco said, or possibly moaned, dragging Potter down into another hot, slick kiss. Potter’s chest heaved against him and Draco investigated it as they snogged, catching one of Potter’s nipples between two knuckles and tweaking it, losing his breath when Potter gasped out of their kiss and buried his face against Draco’s neck to bite and suck along the bend of it. Every graze of his teeth and pull of his lips sent a shock of pleasure straight to Draco’s cock, and really, he should probably just take off his pants soon; spunk was so hard to spell out of material. “My boxers are expensive,” he explained.
to stop and consider. Whatever.
Stomach churning, he made it halfway through his potatoes before slamming his fork down. “Are you just here to put me off my meals, or did you want me for something specific?”
“Harry?”
“No! Merlin, I’d never ask
“Potter,” he choked out, trying to gain some traction. But Potter still had his leg, still had him pinned, and his face was twisted up with so much pleasure that the Delighted Thing made way in Draco’s chest to store it like a Muggle snapshot, secreted away. He wiggled a hand between them to grasp his cock, but Potter knocked it aside. “I need—”
Malfoy’s knees were bent, a tent under the covers. He picked at their design, an elaborate stitching of the Black family crest. He stared at it and muttered, “Do what you came here for and fuck off.”
“Oh, that’s not the question you should be asking,” Harry said. It was getting more difficult to hold onto wrath that had sent him here now that he could see with his own eyes that Draco was fine (if simply a complete twat), but he doggedly managed it. “I’m an Auror, that one should be obvious. Why not try: ‘What did you do last night, Harry?’”
and goes to sleep with his nose pressed to parchment.
without my presence,” Draco said. His eyes were dark as slate, unwavering on Harry’s face.
, circular, meaning the same thing. Draco exhaled. “Just— I’ll show you.”
“Damn,” Anthony murmurs and Hermione nods, a cold knot of dread tightening inside her.
Harry flicks him a glance. He goes to the window and cranks it open by the lever; he twists for another look at Draco before climbing out — and then he's gone.
Humming, Harry pulls out everything he’ll need and gets started, and makes a mental note to look for game as they go. Some fresh protein would be sorely appreciated at this point. Until then, they’ll just have to get creative.
“Don’t be absurd, Harry; I just happen to buy them right before they die,” Draco said, and walked to the Floo.
okay, it just—
“I’m fine now,” he said. “Professor Snape told me Potter didn’t even understand the—”
“Having cherries?” Malfoy gave him an arch look. He lifted another one and dangled it over his mouth, eyes on Harry, then curled his tongue around it to detach it from the stem. Tucking it into his cheek, he grinned. “But I missed dinner and have recently discovered that I have quite a taste for them. Even if they’re not quite ripe.”
“I’m your gifter,” Draco said without equivocating. He Summoned the small gift still waiting under the decorated fir tree in the corner by all of the other religious displays, nearly hitting some of the students sitting before it — he supposed a lot of them had been watching the game, rather than opening their gifts. He passed it over to Weasley, who took it without saying a word. “It’s a scarf.”
, aren’t I, and you’re— I’m—”
He’d left his ugly Healer robes open that morning, but his clothes under them were well-tailored — snugly-fit trousers and a waistcoat, both in a darker shade of grey than his eyes. Harry saw his prick twitch through the expensive material; riveted, he watched it lengthen a bit against Draco’s thigh. He took a step closer without thinking.
Harry hesitated, then gave Malfoy a wary nod. “She’s contacting the
So Draco had got the “protection” part right, at least.
The third had lost one of his kidneys and a week of his memory.
“I do think you should invite Granger next,” Draco said, picking up a conversation in the middle — one that they hadn’t been having. “Weasley if you must, and I suppose you do. I’m going to have a few guests over, myself,” he waved at the parchment on his desk,  “and we can coordinate at dinner, if that works for you.”
No one did.
After showing Harry that he did, indeed, occasionally like doing the fucking, Draco tucked his face against Harry’s neck. Shaking, still breathing hard, he left it there long after his hips had stopped jerking. Harry pet the sweaty strands of his hair back and marvelled over the sensation of Draco going soft inside him, enjoying the soreness in a way he hadn’t anticipated. Enjoying the stickiness between their bodies the way he had from the start.
“No I couldn’t,” Draco scoffed. But his pale eyes gleamed with satisfaction and his mouth twitched when Harry deftly took her in his arms, keeping a careful distance between them. Draco nodded at her once more, an implicit,
Draco takes it. Rolls it thoughtfully in his palm. “Muffliato?”
“We are?” Harry asked. “I thought most of today was clothes.”
Draco shrugs, moving on. “Obvious or not, it counts. I could have been reciting your shoe size and how you take your tea each turn if I’d wanted.” Then, in what’s clearly nothing more than a guess, he hazards, “You wank… twice a day, thinking about it.”
She snuggled into him and, soon enough, was snoring quietly. Draco closed his eyes, better able to accept her comfort when she was fast asleep.
“Can we focus on the part where I came back to you from a train station between life and death?” Harry says, muffling his chagrin with a laugh dropped against Draco’s shoulder. “Be moved by that for a few minutes, or at least impressed? What do you want from me?”
“Could you figure out a way to make it Muggle-friendly?”
It made Harry come, Draco wanting him so badly, just knowing he was on the cusp. He groaned, his fingers bruisingly tight on Draco’s lower back, cock spurting everything filthy wet between them; he kissed Draco, forced himself to keep it soft, questing, his body still wracked with shivers as Draco started to come too. Taking back the room that had felt, so preciously, like
“Why waste time arguing over it when I can just show you,” Malfoy said coolly, folding his sleeve back with quick, jerky movements. Harry’s gaze was drawn immediately to the bright ink on the inside of his forearm, a tattoo of some sort covering his Mark, but Malfoy continued shoving up his sleeve when it reached his elbow, and rotated his arm. Only a few inches were visible, the rest disappearing behind the material of his shirt, but there it was: an ugly, gouging scar bisected over the skin of Malfoy’s bicep — roughly the width of a Hippogriff’s talon. “It goes all the way up to my clavicle,” Malfoy added, looking grimly satisfied. “Though I’d prefer not to take off the rest of my clothes in a crowded restaurant to prove it.”
“Draco,” he said, “shut up and put me in you.”
, yes.” He lifts up on his knees and grips Harry’s cock to angle it. Harry closes his eyes, the sight of his cock being guided between Draco’s cheeks almost too much for his overloaded system, and helps by sliding his hands back from Draco’s hips to his buttocks, fingers biting into the muscle so he can spread them. Draco wriggles, and Harry feels the tip of his cock slide over smooth skin, feels it brush and press against Draco’s slippery hole. Harry opens his eyes.
” The curse is unintended, as surprising as the blur to his eyes and the way he stands from his chair without meaning to, so fast he tips it over. There's a
“My father’s dead.” Draco doesn’t mean to say it.
Awareness of each detail shot through Harry’s mind like the memory of a dream upon waking — disorienting and nonsensical and bulleted, dissipating before he had a hope of working them out. And then Malfoy rotated his hips, grinding their cocks together.  A shocked sound punched its way from Harry’s chest and he pushed against Malfoy on reflex. His gaze dropped to Malfoy’s sullen, bleeding mouth.
“Well, in Herbology, you end up learning a few things about potions whether you want to or not, and I’m pretty solid about theory at this point. But Hermione…” Neville’s lips quirk. “You do remember me in Potions class, don’t you?” he asks with unselfconscious humour. “Eventually, with the proper people, it would probably be simple enough. If I tried to do it, I’d probably end up exploding half the castle.”
— a teenager, Harry thinks, propping him back into the seat. He takes a deep breath and checks through his pockets. It’s unpleasant, and turns his stomach; it feels more than a little like gravedigging. The boy’s pockets are empty, but Harry spies a school bag resting on the floor between his feet, and carefully lifts it out so as to not jostle him more than he already has. Tucked into one of the front compartments is a small, boxy mobile with a hard plastic shell. Harry looks at it, blinking, and then tucks it into his jacket before checking the woman in the driver’s seat; she has one as well, an older model. Holding his breath, he tries the power button and finds himself unable to look away when the phone comes to life — with 84% of the battery left to use. He’s still turning it over in his hand when Draco joins him.
, and Harry groans and tilts his head to give you more access, his cock pulsing again inside you, his pleasure at having been claimed, too, slipping hot over your tongue.
Harry hesitated. Giving in to the temptation of using the Elder Wand still weighed on him a little, despite having made himself accountable to McGonagall’s opinion on the matter. But as McGonagall had pointed out, he was doing it to right a wrong, and with no expectation of power. Using the Elder Wand once every eight years under such selfless circumstances might be acceptable, she’d said, and there’d been no way for Harry to admit that it
He swims to where the sandy shoreline disappears into the trees and back to the rocky buttress, then flips underwater to do it again, mind blissfully cataloguing only those things he needs to keep moving: the pattern of his breath, the burn in his muscles, the extension and stroke of his arms and legs. Eventually he can no longer maintain any of it, so he turns onto his back to float and cool down, gaze firmly set on the two puffy, white clouds in the pink-streaked sky, and that’s when he hears Potter call. Draco turns to see the speck of him standing on the rocks and realises he’s floated nearer to the middle of the lake than he’d intended. With a sigh, he sets for shore.
Neville shifts from one foot to the other, his gaze flickering over her face. Quiet and serious, he says, "I just wondered how you are."
Harry thought. He looked at Ron and Hermione, wavering as they tried to remain standing, and kept his teeth clenched, in hopes the word wouldn’t accidentally fall out.
After a while, he’d asked if he could borrow their owl. He wrote a missive to the Malfoys: a location, a date, a time. A paltry invitation to a wedding — as far as such things went.
It was a rhetorical question — he’d already sat down. Harry didn’t turn. He watched as the water slowed the gush of blood. Watched the gush transform into ribbons and wash away.
“Wanker, fine. Merlin, you’re difficult,” he bitched, and I felt him yank at the coverlet and roll over. Outraged, I opened my eyes and stared at the back of his shoulders.
eager, too forgiving of him. Hermione bit her lip and ventured, “So what have you been doing, otherwise?”
After a moment, Draco sighs. He doesn’t comment on the lost time — perhaps because he hadn’t complained about how they’d used it — but says, “Do we need to leave now? We could head back towards Amiens—”
“The age thing again?”
Draco was marginally better with Teddy, seeming to decide that treating him as a miniature adult was the best course of action. Teddy, of course, enjoyed that for its sheer novelty, and took full advantage, chubby fingers wound tight around Draco’s index finger as he marched them around the room and pointed at everything that caught his eye.
” he said, but took his hand off his prick all the same. Malfoy’s snort puffed into his ear; he grasped Harry’s cock. Fucked Harry into the circle of his fist.
Malfoy set the box down. “Oh please, Potter. Latex wouldn’t even look good on you.”
“And?” Hermione asks. “It’s a tiny slip, and the wards aren’t fragile.”
Harry’s whimper tries to break free again. He takes another great gulp of lavender-vanilla scented air as Malfoy removes his hand and pulls off. Hastily, Harry comes down into child’s pose, stretching his arms out. Putting his face to the mat. His dick throbs, caught between his belly and the press of his thighs. He listens to Malfoy move away, and the volume of the chimes increases.
Harry said,
The resistance abruptly vanished when he reached the wide, high arch of the doorway, and he stumbled against the door. Somehow, that only added to the momentum of his anger.
After that, the force had cracked down, pulling paper-runners from around the Ministry to train new-hires and fill in for the missing ones. And still it was rough going, experienced people having to slog their way through the department’s policies, Aurors pitching in and pulling double shifts. Even then, things weren’t falling into place, and it had been a wild shot in the dark when Harry decided to look into the missing, the dead, the injured.
It fits itself into the body that fell, rising slowly. Its eyes are milky, its hands are bloodless, and everything it sees is an abomination it must cure. It brings death to one, to another and another, and some scream and topple but others join it, the crackle of their magic growing to extend their reach. Like a soundwave, like a Muggle bomb, the curse ripples out, shutting down magical communications and feeding on magic itself. It hangs in the air, heavy and thick as it travels north and south, east and west, spreading out from Paris to hunt for those who can join the swarm and those that are not worthy enough to.
It sounds almost like a question. Troubled, Hermione kisses her forehead once more. “That’s precisely right.”
Draco was staring at him, jaw bunched. “So what, precisely, are you saying?”
Draco looked at him back.
“My father has fallen,” he said, standing in front of Harry’s door. He didn’t bother to explain whether that meant Lucius was dead or writhing in pain — not that it would have mattered to Harry, in either case. But then Malfoy said, “My mother is holding on, for now. Yours will all start dropping soon, too, if they’re not already,” and Harry held the door all the way open and stepped aside to let them enter.
Harry nods. He rewards Draco with another hard, biting kiss, then lowers his head, grazing his teeth down the cords of Draco’s neck before pausing to suck at the bend of his shoulder. Draco squirms, panting brokenly, the motions of his hand between them increasing from a slow shift into fast, jerky movements. Harry shakes his head, catching Draco’s wrist and glancing down, breath leaving him in a rush. Draco’s hand is dipped below the waistband of his knickers, stretching out the fabric, his fingers wrapped tight around his cock. Harry pries them off, replacing them with his own for just a moment to feel the weight of Draco’s erection, to thumb over the soaked head. It jerks, drooling out a little more precome against the pad of his thumb.
Swallowing hard, he takes a last, furtive glance over his shoulder before tapping out the bricks that will move the wall aside. They shift, part, and he steps in. The silence here, too, is ghostly.
“Do you need a bigger response than what I just gave the world?”
“Lovely,” Draco says, snorting. He looks down at their clasped hands, resting on Harry’s knee. “I didn’t mean it.”
, leading to an hour-long discussion on the merits of different wizarding charities. The day after that he’d wanted Draco’s opinion on the socks he’d received from his gifter, seeming entirely undisturbed when Draco pointed out how pitiful a gift it was.
They sat in silence for a minute, looking down at Draco’s broken wand. It represented something to each of them, and Harry thought it would have been hard enough to accept for those reasons alone, but the sheer maliciousness of what Robards had done to Draco was enough to make him sick. He still hadn’t been able to reconcile the man he’d so admired to the man who was capable of such greed and spite; he didn’t think he ever would. And what made it even worse was that part of Harry wanted to
“But we might not. We could make it.” Harry slid his hand up to the ball of Malfoy’s shoulder and gripped it firmly. “Let’s try it and see.”
He sends Malfoy letters,
Draco looks at him suspiciously. After a few moments, the tension leaves his shoulders, his forearms. He takes Harry’s hand and allows himself to be pulled to his feet. “Why are we getting up?” he grouses, apparently not over his offence. “It’s warm by the fire.”
They look at each other. They don’t touch. It’s almost ritualistic at this point.
I shut the door to my room — too hard, everything echoes in this place — and fumble my flies open with shaking fingers. He's got his nervous habits, and I've got mine. Sweet Merlin, I'm so hard and sensitive, I hiss just brushing my fingers over the dripping head of my cock. Shoving my trousers and pants around my thighs, I lurch unevenly to my bed and fall face-down onto it. My hand is wedged, perfectly, between my mattress and my body. I bite down on my duvet to muffle my moans and start a frantic fuck into the tunnel of my fist.
“Yeah. Sorry about the Patronus. I only got a few hours of sleep,” Harry said. “I’d have gone up myself, if I’d been thinking.”
Hermione meets Minerva's widening eyes, and quietly closes the door.
“What?” Harry said, watching the irregular throb of Malfoy’s pulse in his throat — all of those faint blue lines like the ones in his wrists, a conflux of tributaries rushing under the surface, sucking him into their flow. He looked up, saw Malfoy’s eyes were on his mouth. Desperately, Harry thought
It happens just before lunch, as you're considering going to St Mungo’s. One wrong inhale through your nose — a waft of clean, masculine perspiration coming from down the hall. Your whole body goes rigid in your seat; your cock pulses with what feels like a small climax. Padma's chair creaks as it swivels around. She turns to you from her cubicle, nostrils flaring, a look of concern on her face. She's a Beta, you've got nothing to fear from her, but you feel too exposed. You feel…
It was one of the longest exchanges they’d shared since having been informed of the contract.
A few days pass. You’re productive, if a little lonely. But at least you find it quiet, and because they’ve relegated you to a hidden corner of Obscure Artifacts, you’re able to play the Wireless a bit without reprimand. The treks to and from Employee Resources take a good quarter of your workdays. It’s annoying but not unmanageable. You realise with chagrin that your placement is probably wise; the looks you receive are far too keen, though you’re done with your heat.
“What’s going on?” she asks.
“If I go in before him, I’ll automatically be his superior,” he explained. Malfoy ticked him an incredulous look, and Harry shrugged. “Yeah, I might end up getting promoted first, or he might, but whatever happens, it’s better to start from the same spot, isn’t it?”
: stomach and back, stomach and legs, stomach and head and throat. Ron sat in a chair at the far end of the room next to Hermione. His face and hands were still splotched with soot and grime from the fight, his blood-stained robes crumpled in his lap. He was resting his cheek atop Hermione’s head, tipped familiarly on his shoulder; without his glasses, Harry couldn’t make out their features, but he felt fairly certain they were both asleep. He turned his head carefully.
Draco shook his head, pushing faster into Potter’s hand. “I don’t know,” he choked. “Something other people don’t know. A secret. So I can tell you one.”
“Yes,” she says, with a small catch to her voice, a betrayal of her natural poise that denotes the depth of her pain. But when Narcissa speaks again, she sounds herself: “We go on, as we must.”
Robards stretched his arm to take them with a blink. He rose from his chair and opened his mouth, but was interrupted by the flap of rustling feathers as a new owl flew in Harry’s door.
Something complicated passed over Malfoy’s face. He wrapped his arms around his bare ribcage like he was cold, looking defensively out of place, something Harry abruptly realised he’d never seen before. Malfoy’s bravado was such that he automatically seemed to own any room he walked into.
They eat largely in silence, but when they’re done, Draco pushes his plate away with a sigh and leans back in his chair, stretching out his leg to prop his bare foot on Harry’s knee. He’s the most tactile person Harry knows, and his shamelessness about encroaching on someone’s space increases exponentially the more he trusts them. For a while, Harry tried not to let it mean as much to him as it does — not until, for a while, it was gone.
Granger tries to disguise her pause by taking another measured sip of her tea. “Are you trying to pretend you would care if she wasn’t okay?”
“It’s just.” Potter hesitated. “It looked really familiar. I’ve probably made it before,” he said. He tapped his temple with two fingers. “I used to cook a lot, all the time really, before…” A look of fleeting discomfort crossed his face. “Before school. How does it look wrong?”
Harry’s gaze, vivid and sure, lifts to his. Draco’s heart shudders to a momentary halt. He doesn’t know how to interpret a look so full of understanding so closely following the last, and it occurs to him to wonder whether he’s been the one waiting for Harry’s answers to
Without much else to do, and because Hermione and Ron were sort of gross around each other sometimes, Harry redoubled his efforts to find a place of his own, and something to fill his days, come autumn.
“He’s a rather brilliant child, isn’t he?” Draco asked later, flopping down on the sofa with an exhausted sigh. He rolled his head to look at Harry. “I don’t think they’re all that inquisitive.”
“Could fix things,” Draco said tightly. He blew out a breath like a laugh, uncomfortable, fake. Anticipating a laugh from Harry too, over his well-considered plans. Over his aspirations to improve himself.
“I could barely compare you to a child when you were one, Malfoy,” he says, hooking up one brow when Draco snorts. “You know exactly what I’m saying. Dick.”
It brings to mind the way he looks in his Quidditch leathers. Malfoy says, "Just… try to feel it in your body."
“If you think that’s disrespectful, you should hear how I talk about him,” Harry says. Malfoy cracks a laugh that goes on too long and is underscored by a harsh, bitter wheeze when he draws in a breath.
4 b diamonds in stock, too much to use all??
Draco made a sharp gesture, jaw firming as he stared at the Floo crackling green. “I’m fine.”
— when Harry panted out a hello on the third occasion earned him an invitation to drinks upon Harry’s recovery, and by the time Draco treated him for a curse that was leeching all of Harry’s blood to his head, Harry didn’t even pause at Draco’s teasing threat to sell photographs to the papers.
“He told Kreacher
— and a durable, one-man tent. Motherload.
Bill nodded again, slower.
“It’s not okay,” Harry said through his teeth. They’d had a good year, and he didn’t want to fight, but it
. He was looking at—
Harry follows him, bewildered and relieved and fucking
“I… A bit,” Harry admitted. It might be in a confused, frustrated way that seemed destined to drive him mad and make him question all of his life choices, but it unavoidably shared certain properties with things like— fascination and amusement, and even newfound respect. Certainly with attraction. “Yeah, maybe. It’s probably nothing more than a spot of fun, but…” He shrugged, no more prepared to think about it than Hermione was to hear it.
Those were the things that held him together in the aftermath of every fight; he and Draco bridged the gap from one to the next with sex that never got any less brilliant. He never stopped wanting to touch Draco. That helped, since he couldn't die every time he wanted an arrow to point him down the right path; he wasn't even sure he'd be given the chance to come back again, if he did.
“The more anxious you get, the more unaffected you seem,” Harry says, picking something at random. Might as well, it’s evidenced right in front of him. He jerks his chin at Draco’s pose. “It’s different when you’re just frustrated or annoyed; you let that build. But now? Legs outstretched and crossed, hands folded loosely over your stomach, body leaned back. Even that smile. This must be killing you.”
Harry softened, and then it was his turn to hold Draco. To whisper in his ear with a tenderness Draco liked to pretend himself incapable of giving or receiving:
There was a pause, and then Draco said, “Harry?”
” Other things filtered in, then: a yelp, a swish of fabric, the clipped tread of Draco’s footsteps. The posh, irritated tones of Draco’s accent persuaded Harry a little closer to the surface.
Malfoy glanced at the birds and gave a stilted nod as he removed his towel. Harry averted his eyes. That he couldn’t find a way to blame Malfoy directly for the mess they were in didn’t make it okay that he enjoyed any aspect of it. He wanted to like it less, wanted to be the Harry he’d been a few months prior, his own man for the first time in his life. He got onto his hands and knees on the squeaky bed, and waited.
Harry’s stomach twists. Absurdly, he finds himself remembering the argument he and Ron had with Hermione, in their first year of Auror training, when they scoffed over one of the rules in the handbook:
“Have you gone insane?” Draco stood up, moving further down the wall — creating more space between them. “I was only going to stop you so you— I wasn’t planning on…”
“Betrothal?” Harry asked again before his mind caught up. He glanced back at the ballroom, zeroing in on Draco immediately. It was hard not to; he stood out like a beam of light in his solid white dress robes, an almost exact copy to Harry’s except in colour, stretching tight across his chest and the lean breadth of his shoulders, a million gleaming, ivory buttons lined from his throat to his knee. He was chatting calmly with a small group off the centre of the room. Harry blinked once, then again, to make sure he wasn’t imagining things when he realised Draco hadn’t been doused by fairy dust — that the brightness around him was his alone.
“We’ve all been busy,” she said when he sat down. Somehow, the way she instinctively tried to clear him of responsibility made it even worse. They’d all been working, yeah, all been busy. But Hermione and Ron had made time to let him come over; they made time for dinners and visits to the Burrow, and check-ins, and the longer Harry was on holiday, the more he was able to see just how much of his life he’d put on hold in his drive to advance his career. Hermione hadn’t put anything on hold, and it was obvious how engaged she was with her work. Ron hadn’t either, though Harry was pretty sure he had orders that went back for six months or more. They simply seemed to know how to prioritise what was important to them, and it made Harry wonder when he’d stopped doing that.
He hadn’t even known they’d had one.
“Both.”
“Oh. Yes. That’s— Yes,” Granger says. “All right, thank you.”
A glance in the shower yields nothing; both the floor and the nozzle are bone-dry. Harry grabs the travel bag and slips back out of the bathroom, then sets both bags on the bed. He turns to look at the sofa.
“But not for my sheets,” Draco said, voice gratifyingly unsteady, “not the oil I use for sessions.” He slung his arm over Harry’s shoulder to reach for something and came back with a small bottle of soap, thumbing open the lid and squeezing out a healthy dose onto the flannel. “Turn around.”
“Yes, you are so fucking me!” Harry said.
"Malfoy," he croaks. "It was Malfoy."
“It’s mostly fallen. Some Unspeakables made it here as the Floos were shutting down, a few Aurors and some Healers from St Mungo’s managed to get some patients here. We got a lot of people from the village. There’s very little outside help to be had, but we do have people monitoring what’s going on with the available magic. We’re working on it, okay?”
“Anyway you want to do it,” Harry says. He can see hypnotic hints of Draco’s cock, paler and more slender and slightly longer than his own, whenever Draco twists his hand, and he forces himself to loosen his hold on Draco’s shoulder so he wouldn’t bruise him. Draco leans in and obscures his vision by nipping at Harry’s collarbone, tongue dancing light and wet over the bite of his teeth as he pulls away.
Harry thought about it.
Harry darts a glance at his face, then away. Draco looks down at his hands, now curled in his lap. He can’t bring himself to elaborate. He hadn't known he was going to say it; even thinking it brings a guilty burn to his cheeks. Freedom from one’s past isn’t attainable, nor should it be in the case of a past like his, Draco knows. But admitting he wishes things might be different — that he might be able to openly enjoy a walk along Diagon Alley rather than maintaining a carefully neutral expression when he’s in public so as to not attract attention; that he’d not have to scrape to advance in his field; that any part of him misses being able to take his place in society for granted — isn’t acceptable either. It’s just as selfish as he’s always been.
Potter’d said.
Draco looks at him over the rim of his mug as he takes a long, calm drink of his coffee. “How?”
“Oh.” Harry’s shoulders came down, a dwindling of that blistering rush of curiosity that sent him to Malfoy’s door. He sagged back in the chair, not quite sure what to do with that information. “So it’s normal. Or, normal for magical houses.”
“My father loves me,” Draco said. “But he loves me best when I’m of use to him. You’re one of the only people who’d never let him leverage me for his personal gain. You won't be used at all.”
“I was going to say ‘disrespectful’,” Malfoy says, then sighs. "Irrelevant, anyway." He narrows his eyes to the long road before them and swipes his forehead with the back of his hand. “Where are those dark specs?”
Most choose their mates through a combination of response chemicals and good, old-fashioned dating. So many of them want to be
There are so many things that could go wrong with this scenario, and it’s on the tip of Draco’s tongue to say so. But he’s not unaware that he’s indebted to Potter — yet again — so he refrains from commenting a second time and only says, “If we take two each, there’s a three-second punch of magic after swallowing that might mitigate some of the risk. It won’t get us far, though.”
No. Can't wait.
Harry gulps and shakes his head. Thinks better of it. Nods. He's naked, covered in sweat. There are scratches all over him and his joints are clawed. It takes effort to straighten them out. He can still smell—
Malfoy pulls away, eyes glittering, face as hard as his cock pressed against Harry’s pelvis. “I don’t even want you,” he says, before proving himself a liar by kissing Harry again with a deep, guttural moan. Harry threads his fingers through Malfoy’s hair, now tousled and coming undone from its clip. He makes a fist and Malfoy shudders, so much of what’s soft about him caught in Harry’s palm as he kisses Malfoy back, stunned by the intensity of his own desire. He squirms higher onto the desk, one leg coming up to hook around Malfoy’s arse.
), steady and tight, and holding on.
“Goodnight, then,” Malfoy said. Harry tried to recall if they’d ever wished each other goodnight before. It certainly didn’t sound like them.
consider—”
“I know.” Draco doesn’t know what’s happening between them, less so what it
It had, in the form of Capricarian Black, married nine years to a man she’d not chosen. Whether preventive magics had been used to bar conception, or their biology had simply been incompatible, no one ever knew; their arranged marriage had not been fruitful, and she’d fallen in love with someone else.
Potter lifted off, letting my cock slip from his mouth. His eyes were hazy, his cheeks a deep red. He rose to his feet, breathing unsteadily, and swallowed. He cocked his head. “Do you? Really?”
The solicitor paused, forehead going shiny again, a nervous man whose name Harry couldn’t bother himself to recall. He was obsequious, but uncompromising nonetheless — very definitely a Slytherin — and he’d been the one alerted when the contract roused from its slumber. Staring down at his hands, he mumbled, “There, ah, must have been something,” but moved on hastily before it could devolve into the near-duel that had ended their first meeting. He returned to the Reading of the Scrolls, the last of the recorded histories detailing the links in their bloodlines, then turned to explain the stipulations of the contract:
Draco pushes off the encroaching nausea and concentrates on the Dark magic tangling around his senses. A sour, rotten taste fills his mouth, makes him gag. He nods.
The fondness of his father’s touch remains as real and easily accessible as the pain he taught Draco later, his first
“That wasn’t me being a
“I’d be incredibly cautious about investigating it further,” Malfoy added after a beat. “At least to the point of having Kreacher check for you before you wander down any new corridors. House-elves can’t be hurt by the home they’re loyal to, and… Potter? Are you even listening?”
Turning my cheek, I see Potter standing in my doorway, face red — those eyes wide and astonished. Dumbfounded. Oh fuck. Oh
Harry wanted an answer to give him, any but the one he suspected.
“It’s good of you to have us,” Blaise said. “We’d wondered where Draco had disappeared to.”
“Hermione,” he mocked, “when have you ever been able to stop me?”
Harry found it amazing how quickly he and Malfoy could complete their work the next day, and how, even still, detention seemed to drag on forever; being stupidly horny and having a willing partner made gathering ingredients feel properly urgent, like a race or a contest where they could help each other to the finish line. Even the bike hadn’t given Harry the same level of incentive.
“I believe in you, Harry.”
Harry spooned some more sugar into his tea and drizzled in a bit more milk. He stirred it, keeping his eyes on the fragrant curl of its steam wafting out. Kreacher grumbled about serving Earl Grey; he said the way Harry drank it was common, and maybe it was. But for ten years it hadn’t stopped feeling like a luxury, being able to add whatever he wanted, making the tang of the bergamot sweet. He warmed his hands with the cup and finally looked up.
,” Harry said as Draco led him to the back of the shop again; for a few items, he’d paid so much gold he should have been able to fly home on them like a magic carpet. Annoyed at being handled, he shrugged off Draco’s hand. “Greg Goyle?”
But despite the similar links Harry could track over the course of their friendship, the realisation that Draco loved him hit him differently — as a deeply-embedded awareness Harry thought he might have known forever. As the instantaneous comprehension of a whole universe he’d happened upon without looking for it. Being in that space woke up something inside of Harry, and it felt like waking up to
And there went another mistake Draco couldn’t blame on his friends: Not paying attention to whatever the hell Potter had been saying in that moment, which turned out to have been something like
Potter nodded, a swatch of satanically dark hair falling over one eye, and inched his zipper down to reveal grey boxer briefs. His stomach fluttered, caving in briefly as his gaze landed on my prick. I gave it another rub to shine him on. Potter fucking
Well, mostly. If you disregarded how frequently Potter managed to sneak into my mind while I was tossing off, but I found that irrelevant. And not particularly new. I’d gone through the same phase as most of the students in his year, after all.
“We had a date?” Harry asked, willing to play along. His confusion was a distant thing to the steady rouse of desire between them. The only thing he really knew was that for all that they’d done, he hadn’t allowed himself to want Malfoy this much until now. Not in such a personal way. “Tonight? Another one?”
“Not to you,” Hermione said with censure. Harry whirled, reached her in three long strides. He scooped her up as she came into the room, a dizzying wave of relief washing over him. Hermione returned the hug tentatively, then tighter, patting his back with a soothing flutter of her hand. “Harry? What are you doing here so late? Are you okay? What’s going on?”
“Yes.” ‘Back then’ was a rather polite way to say it, the papers hounding Draco near as much as they had Ron and Hermione. It made good copy, Harry’d supposed at the time. Draco was the only Death Eater available for the wizarding world to point their collective fingers at, and the
what it is,” Draco snapped. He fell silent again, then said, without looking up, “Give me my wand.”
“Tell me,” Draco said into his mouth, rolling his hips against Harry’s, his ankles hooked around Harry’s thighs. He slid his hands hot up the back of Harry’s shirt, fingers clenching when Harry sucked at his lower lip. “Tell me the first way you want me,” he said, and Harry was so hard he had to yank out of their kiss to pant his answer against Draco’s cheek for fear he’d come. He snatched a reply from the million warring desires in his head and asked for it, smiling when Draco chuckled, warm and easy and said “Yes. Fuck. I can do that.”
“We’ll— cool down, for five,” Malfoy says, sounding unsteady. “Then I think we can stop for the day.”
That thought in mind, Harry grabs their bags. They’ve not had a chance to have something hot yet and he’s been looking forward to using the camp stove, the mini-kettle. He’s not quite sure how to feel that Malfoy’s placed the heavier items in his own bag, thus sparing the extra weight on Harry’s shoulder, but he takes a moment to admire Malfoy’s organisational setup nonetheless, everything in easy-to-access order. Merlin, no wonder he went into the Department of Mysteries.
when they were so willing to go on their knees for you, especially when you realised you liked them. Bad manners and all that. So his last-minute trip to Hogsmeade was totally justified, really.
, but argumentative. Potter was just revoltingly frustrating to argue with when he gets an idea in his head. My dick was so hard it almost hurt, and my chest felt—
Unshaven and sipping his first cuppa, he blearily watched as Malfoy decimated his wardrobe with an exuberance that seemed entirely out of proportion, muttering things like, “Good lord, Harry”, and “He actually thinks he’s still fifteen doesn’t he?”, and “What have I got myself into?”, and Harry’s favourite of the morning: “Did he utilise wizarding space to host all of his band t-shirts?” And Harry might have argued with any or all of those statements simply because he was tired, except then Malfoy would probably make a comparison. If he did, Harry wouldn’t have a leg to stand on; Harry was wearing yesterday’s jeans, hastily pulled on, and the t-shirt he’d fallen asleep in, and Malfoy’d shown up looking fit and finely kitted out in a pair of sharply pleated black trousers that hugged the flare of his arse just so, and a dark patterned green-and-silver tie and matching waistcoat, nipped in at the small of his back by a grey fabric cinch. Harry couldn’t stop looking at that cinch, which didn’t seem to quite go but still stressed the narrowness of Malfoy’s waist, his hips, the lean breadth of his shoulders and the stretch of his height as his body shifted under his clothes with each economical movement he made.
“That’s probably true,” Malfoy said, running his eyes up and down Harry. “Merlin knows you look even more hopeless than you did in school. But am I supposed to glean from that taciturn expression what sort of help you’re expecting? You’re obviously not here for what I traditionally offer.”
“Wait,” Harry said. His heart pounded at a sickening pace, and he felt disoriented and vaguely ill, the base of his skull and his shoulders aching with tension. “Wait. Malfoy. I— I want this job and,” he swallowed, “I need your help. I’m— I can’t keep—”
” He opened his eyes to find Malfoy staring at him, his fork suspended midair. Harry flushed and Malfoy looked back down at his plate.
Harry gnawed on his lip. What could Malfoy have done?
They stared at each other for the length of two heartbeats before Malfoy struck first; Harry heard the dull thud of Malfoy’s fist meeting his jaw a bare second before the pain flared, and Harry let his own fists fly. He caught Malfoy under the chin, in the stomach, revelled in the blow he took to the ribcage. And then they were on the ground somehow, a hard shoving wrestle, all of the fury Harry had stored in his magic and his chest unleashed against the Malfoy’s squirming, bony frame, the best he’d felt in a bloody month. Malfoy hooked a leg around him, using his heel to kick at Harry’s back, and Harry absorbed the sensation with a gratified grunt. He gripped Malfoy’s knee with bruising fingers to prevent him from doing it again, and shoved Malfoy to the floor. Panting, he pinned him there with a hand to his throat.
“I do, actually,” Harry says. Malfoy snorts and rises, arching a bored brow at Harry until Harry slides off his desk. Malfoy sets the files down and pauses, his back to Harry and shoulders stooped forward.
“The—” Malfoy gulped, then groaned and sagged as Harry kissed a spot just under his jaw, so Harry paused there with a pulling suck that made another one of those gasps issue from Malfoy’s throat. When he could force himself to lift his head, there was a deep violet mark left behind, like a target Harry could aim for to make Malfoy go weak-kneed again if he wanted, and Malfoy’s face was wrecked: slender lips swollen, complexion blotchy with heat, his eyes glassy and pupils shot dark. His hair was a mess too, the easy quiff Malfoy styled it in every day undone by Harry’s fingers, and filled with little bits of tree bark. Malfoy turned his face away, closed his eyes, and bit his own lip. Nudging his hips forward, he roughly said, “The— The blanket.”
The sound of glass slamming down on the counter made them both jump and look up.
” he said, jerking away when Draco bit too hard at his lip. But Draco’s eyes were alight, excited, desire open on his face, his cock swollen and stiff between them. Harry kissed him again, crushed their bodies together, and said, “
“And I can die happy for you knowing it,” Harry said dryly, disgusted on all fronts.
Draco flicks a glance to the wizard, a frown appearing between his eyes. “Don’t what,” he says flatly. Unamused.
He kissed Harry. They made love again, and again, in the big white hotel bed, each time just as good as the first time had been, and every subsequent time since: having Draco, and being had by him.
I agree to do this for you, it won't be my idea of a thrilling time, either, so you can wipe that fucking look off your face.”
him for trying to wrangle out of it again.
Harry looked, and immediately wished he hadn't. Paul had gone lax in Harry’s grip but for his hand, quickly moving over what, Harry supposed sickly, passed for a gnome erection. He held Paul further away. "
“God, Draco,” Harry said. Smiling, because he couldn’t not. “I could have told you that.”
“Right, because that would just be weird,” Harry said, snickering. As if the sound itself was a lock coming undone, he dissolved, no longer able to contain the bubble of stunned amusement that had been growing in his chest. Draco huffed and yanked his arm back, smoothing down his sleeve and shoving Harry’s wand at him. Harry gripped it, trying to gulp back helpless laughter as Draco folded his arms together and watched him impassively for a minute, then said, “If you’re quite finished—”
“I don’t think the word ‘just’ is even a little defensible in that sentence,” she said, giving him such a look of dismay that Harry had to look away. “Oh, Harry. If I’d known that sending you to him would… That you’d… That…”
“I—” Helplessly, pointlessly, Harry shook his head and stared at the fading scores his nails had left on Draco’s back. He stroked one, lightly, just over the sturdy push of Draco’s left shoulder blade. “Yes. But— you’re right. I’m sorry. I didn’t…” He bit the inside of his cheek, ashamed of his own inability to be that open, furious with himself for his assumption he
Swiftness and stealth are traits he's had all his life — learned first at the Dursleys, used later at Hogwarts, and perfected in the Auror Corp. But this time, when he needs them most, they fail him; the shard of glass sticking up from the sill snags his jeans. It cracks and falls to the pavement with a resounding shatter. Harry snaps his head over.
“Fuck, that’s freezing! You could have warned me.”
"You said there's been two Pureblood Supremacist uprisings in your time with the Aurors?" Draco prompts after a few seconds.
They climb four levels down with the rungs built into the brick wall of their building to the second rooftop, where Harry pauses to pull the blade and three of the incendiary devices from his pocket. He spends a few minutes meticulously puncturing something on each of them, then props them carefully in a row on the ledge and guides Draco along with a silent jerk of his chin. Though the middle is the longest of all three structures, it still takes them no time to span its length, and then they have to slow to redistribute and secure the casual lean of their bags on their shoulders; the third building is a little harder to access, attached only by narrow steel girders that shudder under their weight with each step they take. Gracefully agile in a way Draco should probably stop letting himself be surprised by, Harry accomplishes it more quickly than he did during their practice runs, and extends a hand to help steady Draco over his last few precarious steps. He exhales a long breath when Draco’s back on solid ground — or what passes for it.
* * *
“I’m sorry too,” Potter said. “For
settings were a mistake.
“What?”
He lifted his head, his chin wet with saliva. He rubbed the bristle on his jaw against Draco’s arse cheeks, bit one of them gently. His voice sounded strange to his ears. “D’you want…?” He was hazy with all of the things he wanted to do, to try. Things he’d only read about, or seen once in a blue film that had left him blushing, and terribly turned on. “I can…”
, whenever he could. And, well— he
“Is that a fact.”
Robards nodded, then pointed at what was left of the glowing green stack on Harry’s desk. “Take care of those today, reports included. As soon as you’re done with your—” he glanced at the owl and raised his eyebrows, “—personal correspondence.”
“It’s fine,” Potter says quietly. “I don’t think they heard you.”
Anthony nods, a little sheepishly. He opens his mouth to say something, but the echoing clack of boots coming up the corridor makes them both look over. Two Unspeakables are headed toward her office wearing matching expressions of concern.
“It’s just. It’s time for— all that to stop. It’s got to end." Harry gusts out a sigh, raking his fingers through his hair. “We’ve been wasting too much time, and we have to— to focus for now. Right?” Tightly, he adds, “You couldn't have expected it to go on forever, once you were… better.”
“There,” he says, stooping back down to work Draco’s belt free from the jeans Draco’d folded and set just inside the tent. “Finish those off. Protein. I’ll be right back.”
Apparently, blinking twice was as close as Zabini ever got to looking startled, but he certainly sounded it when he said, “Today? Draco, we've got back orders to—”
“We…” Draco exhaled. He’d hoped, maybe— but he hadn’t really been prepared for the possibility of being right. He tried to make the quaver in his voice sound more like a purr. “Of course we can. I’ve been wanting to see how you take it.”
DRACO MALFOY TO ACCOMPANY HARRY POTTER TO MINISTRY GALA!
Relaxing, Harry chuckles and cuffs him lightly on the shoulder. But rather than explaining his puzzling statement, he asks, “What makes you think that?”
“What do you want?”
“Get on your knees.”
, and didn’t understand it — his need to get away, his near-panic to be alone. He made for the door. “I’m good, I can help, I just—”
“I’m going to suck your cock through all that lace,” Harry says roughly. He opens his thighs and leaves off his prick to cup his balls. The way Draco’s throat bobs, seeing it, gives him as deep a zing of pleasure as the way his hand feels, rolling his balls and tugging at his sac. “I hope you don’t mind if it gets sticky, because those aren’t coming off when I fuck you, either.”
“It’s too late to cancel,” he rasped with another nip. He darted his tongue over what were almost certainly the imprints of his teeth. “Now stop trying to get your hands down my bloody trousers.”
when Potter huffed, and sighed, and made an aggravated noise, and eventually climbed into bed. So he was startled when Potter broke the silence.
He said, “I think I get stuck seeing something a certain way, and then never bother to reevaluate unless I have to.”
~ ~ ~
“Well.” Draco took a step away. “I suppose I should thank you for the gifts,” he said, voice coming out bleakly formal. “Thank you. And I’m— sorry,” he added. “For… everything else.”
Harry doesn’t bother with a denial. Draco knows far more about the topic than he does, anyway —
“I want you,” Harry told him, willingly. He hadn’t meant to trap Draco to the wall, but could only press harder against him once he realised he had, hiding petaled names under Draco’s back. He was so hard it was ludicrous, laughable. Draco hadn’t even done anything but allow his wrist to be kissed, his neck, his shoulders pushed to the wall. “Draco, god — I’ll want you tomorrow, too.”
"H-how can Pobble be of service to Mistress Malfoy today?"
It's choked. Disbelieving. Oh no. Nononono.
The drizzling grey skies had nothing on the colour of Draco’s smirking gaze across from the conference table, and it took everything in Harry not to climb over it and have him right there.
“Yes. Floo, Owls. We still spoke at work, but—” He suddenly blinks, sits up. “You’re thinking she meant for us to use Muggle communications.”
,” she said, smirking. “I’ll bet you were ready to buy half of his merchandise because you thought he might shag you.” Then she hesitated. Rolled her eyes. A little more fairly, she added, “His preferences are rather fluid, which helps. People almost always know when they’re being lied to, even if they don’t want to believe it.”
“You seem to know what to do,” Harry says, “and I didn’t even suspect he was scared. Not— not until I heard you say it, when he asked about crying. I didn’t know.” The laugh that breaks loose from his throat is at least dulled enough with regret that it doesn’t disturb Teddy again. He pushes his glasses onto his forehead and rests a hand over them. Thickly, he says, “I just… I didn’t know.”
"Yeah."
“I never agreed to be called that.” He smiled charmingly at a couple of Unspeakables as Harry hustled him along. “I’m not that, not your boyfriend, this is incredibly casual, a first date really, or perhaps we’re just friendly acquaintances, titles are a different discussion and there are several steps someone in your position should—
be a bother.”
Nor does it know that the spell turned out
The elf crawled into bed, the mattress dipping to accommodate it. On the verge of sleep, I let it settle against me, its lean, warm body nestling close, its head fit into the crook of my neck. I fit an arm under its shoulders and sighed. Felt the brush of hair against my jaw as it pressed its lips to my collarbone and— Wait.
Harry took the bag and nodded again at Ron — who was ranting about being taken advantage of now, or something to that effect — to show he was listening, and Summoned a plate. He hastily dumped out the variety of pastries and held them in front of Ron, arm extended. “Hungry?”
Potter groans again, his cockhead streaking wet over Draco’s stomach where his shirt’s rucked up. He bites the bend of Draco’s shoulder, nips the shell of his ear, and then slides down the length of Draco’s body, loosening the ties at Draco’s waist as he goes. Draco moves instinctively, lifting his hips when Potter goes to pull his bottoms down, widening his thighs as much as his joggers will allow.
The hour before dawn is eerie, the light from their torch far flimsier than it feels when they’re in a relatively isolated space. They don’t talk until they’re well on their way and then only in whispers. Harry hasn’t been out with someone at his side when it was this dark since— Well. A topic preceding another fuck, perhaps. At least the moon, still hanging low in the sky, is almost full, though the mist of oncoming clouds obscures its light from time to time. The motorway they travel beside is dotted with abandoned vehicles, but Draco touches Harry’s arm when he first goes to approach one of them.
“Neutralising techs should be here shortly, and it’s
Spent, later, Draco makes a sound of displeasure when Harry pulls out. He wakes enough to shift onto his stomach again, and sighs when Harry murmurs a spell to clean them both.
Malfoy’s lips quirked with a subtle moue of displeasure. “Knackered,” he said. “Revolting. Like thestral shit worked over. But how do I look?”
The alcove had filled up with people as they talked, but Harry was only too willing to go somewhere else — until Draco’s long strides stopped in the middle of the dance floor.
"Yes, and of course none of us are smart enough to have thought of that," Draco scoffs. Potter's lips twitch with a small, acknowledging smile, and Draco smirks in response. "That was just a theory I'd been working on, a way to customise all existing Floos with an Auror's magical signature. It'd mean no green flare to warn the person on the other end, no wards to contend with."
Sessions go for an hour.
“Really?” Potter said, not seeming that interested. His eyes were no longer green so much as black, and his face was splotchy-pink and distracted. He bit at Draco’s jaw and kissed his mouth again, palms rubbing up and down his sides, and Draco wondered what had happened to his shirt, because it had gone and opened all the buttons — even the cuffs were loose, his sleeves riding up.
And then Draco disappeared around the corner, making the decision for him.
“What did you think?” Harry asked. He reached between them, paused when Malfoy caught his breath, then found the drawstrings of Malfoy’s bottoms. He plucked at them — curled them around his fingers. Malfoy glanced down, then up, and this time he did smile, just a touch, so subtle as to almost be a smirk. Harry huffed a laugh. “In the attic. Why you thought I was distracted tonight.”
Harry examined him, some little wire inside himself tripped at the evasion. But Malfoy had got better at closing himself off since school — everything flaunted, then, a constant show of dramatics — and the wall that he was able to put up left Harry a little wrong-footed. That Malfoy had deemed it necessary was some sort of a clue, but Harry was too bothered by his own curiosity to pull on the string yet; he could think on it later, in private. He took a sip of his tea and moved on.
“Maybe later,” Harry says, looking around.
“He's fine,” Harry says. “He's got to be.”
“So was Dobby, if I recall correctly,” Minerva says. “Until he wasn’t.” The look she sweeps at Hermione is so filled with disappointment, Hermione has to control the urge to flinch and to drop her eyes. To excuse herself for doing what she has to:
Anthony shakes his head. “I’ll get them back from you later. She’ll understand. She’ll even like that they were worn by someone who needed them, I think.”
“Not me,” Draco scoffed. “Never that.” But he was smiling, even as he moved his hips against Harry’s in reminder, and that was sweet too.
“That second Inferius.”
Another smile teases the corners of Malfoy’s mouth, and when he turns his head to the side to look at Harry, his eyes are warm enough to change the quality of Harry’s own rising blush.
Narcissa swiftly conceals the small grimace that pulls her lips tight — though not before Granger has seen it, apparently, because her eyes linger on Narcissa’s face. She puts her hand back into her lap and asks, “Did you tell them about that part of the conversation, too?”
“Makes sense, I guess. I’d never seen it like it was in Paris, though,” Potter says, then stops abruptly, catching Draco by the elbow with one gloved hand, fingers tightening fractionally when Draco draws in a sharp breath and looks down at it. He shakes off Potter’s touch instinctively — it’s too potent, even now — and looks to where Potter points: two long, squat buildings, each containing a series of shops with broken windows. There’s a wide walking path in between them.
, they said, as though Draco knew Harry had been waiting.
“Not Ron. He’s as informal as it gets.”
“Fuck,” Potter hisses, driving faster into the circle of Draco’s fist. “
As Kreacher muttered about setting the house to rights for their company, Harry compiled books on wandlore from the library and brought them upstairs. It took the two of them hours to organise everything into the most relevant and easy-to-understand texts, and once they had, Harry spent the majority of his days ensconced in the warmth of Draco’s room where he could keep watch while Draco recovered. He was shaky as a fawn when he walked, and bitter about being unable to proceed as he normally did, not shy about sharing his unhappiness — he pulled faces, and complained under his breath, and snapped at Harry whenever he reached to scratch a healing welt and Harry reminded him not to:
What the fuck.
be certain of one thing, established once already to Granger's detriment,  which Granger fortunately continues to overlook:
“The usual response to that would be to dance with the object of your desire, instead,” Draco says. He sucks his lips between his teeth, a crease at the edge of his mouth.
Malfoy stood in the archway of the dining room uneasily, shoulders spiky under a floaty white shirt, the sort a swashbuckler might wear — long-sleeved, with even longer cuffs that were subtly ruffled over the backs of his hands. Buttonless, the shirt covered him almost to his collar, where untied laces revealed the tension in the cords of his neck. It was tucked into tight tan trousers, which in turn were tucked into black boots that came near up to his knee and were polished to a high shine.
Also, my cock was getting hard. But there were still troll-sized pieces missing from the puzzle.
“But…” Harry’s cheeks heated. “Why? Just for the heir? There are lots of ways to, um. If that was so important. Muggle ways, adoption. And I’m—”
“You just stopped in, then?” Malfoy asks, gaze leaving Harry’s face to glance around the room quickly. His shoulders slowly come down. “I was on your way?”
Still massaging himself, Potter eyes him, then suddenly leans over and turns off the lamp as quick as he'd turned it on. He pushes from his position on his knees to cover Draco, one leg forcing his thighs apart. Draco closes his eyes at the drag of Potter’s erection against his hip and tenses, his responses more startled than he feels, his hand already slid inside Potter’s underwear to grip him. Potter’s cock jumps when Draco takes hold of it, hot and heavy in his hand, and with a wretched little groan, Potter fucks into his fist.
It took Harry a moment to realise that what he was feeling wasn’t anger, but pain. That sensation of being slowly gutted. They were so similar, and one a perfect escape from the other — a neat little cave Harry could hide in where someone else was to blame for his feelings.
She wants a drink in the worst way.
crazy, in no time was almost unbearable, the constant flex of his arsehole around the crown of Potter’s cock, all of his nerves there stimulated over and over and over. He couldn’t catch his breath, mind gone blank other than the rising need to come.
Setting his glasses on an empty shelf and wrapping a towel around his waist, Harry came out. Draco was already waiting for him and, inexplicably nervous, Harry idled by the table. It suddenly seemed so much more significant, though why was beyond Harry; Draco did this to clients all the time. But that in addition to his own budding revelations changed the dimensions of what he’d thought, coming here, this would feel like. Skewed his perception.
When Potter finally came up for air, his lips were red and his eyes glazed. “People are watching us.”
Malfoy’s complexion turns positively chalky and Harry bites back a curse, closing his eyes and reaching for patience. He’s never been able to curb his words when he’s frustrated, and being chastened — even rightly so — has always had the regrettable effect of loosening his tongue. His stubborn impulsivity has got him trouble at work on too many occasions, into fights with Ron and Hermione, into dangerous situations in the field. Those things he knows how to deal with; what's harder is the ugly pit of regret that forms when he has to confront the consequences of his temper.
Harry closes his eyes. It’s agonising, the bitterness on Draco’s face, the venom Harry never thought he’d see again — far worse than the savagery of Draco’s words, the punishment he’s trying to inflict.
Pansy. Draco lets her name run through his head, somehow able to survive each stab of pain it brings when accompanied by Potter’s touch. Pansy, his darling. Pansy, who pretended she’d outgrown her love of pink so she would be taken seriously, but who managed to wear it nearly every day with the lace and satins between her clothing and her fine skin. Pansy, who always knew how to make him laugh, who’d never once let him down.
, I guess, a distraction, when you reach the Channel,” she says, sounding worried. “The map we have indicates they’re… well, it’s congested there, in and around the travel tunnels. But we're fairly sure the service tunnel is empty. We’d only need to clear the way enough for you to reach the doors. I can’t guarantee there won’t be any complications going through, but it’s the best way we can think of to get you across. How far are you from it?”
Harry nods, satisfied. Neither of his suppositions is the real reason, of course, but whatever gets the job done. He shoots a sharp glance to Draco as Draco sets the towel aside and begins flicking open the buttons of his Auror robes. Harry returns to his trousers and pants, the materials of which are clinging unpleasantly to his skin. He clumsily manages to get them down to his knees before having to prop himself again to get them the rest of the way off, all-too-aware that Draco is disrobing beside him. Harry opens the towel and rubs himself down briskly, then wraps it around his waist and looks up in time to see Draco tugging the steel-grey tie around his neck loose.
Since the showers, Draco wasn’t sure how Potter wanted to play this. Potter had smiled at him the few times they’d crossed paths in public, but that meant nothing, really; they were sharing a dorm room. And even if it had been more, most seventh and eighth years had at least one and, more often, lots of people to warm their beds. There was a lot of casual shagging going on this year — far more than Draco’d ever seen or heard about in the dungeons, where Snape turned a blind eye provided you were discreet enough not to shame your family and had enough common sense to come to him for preventive potions if you had a girlfriend. There was even a sexual safety notice charmed up on the announcement board in the common room instructing students to go to Pomfrey for potions, next to the notice about the on-staff Mind Healers. So it wasn’t as if they were likely to get in trouble if they were found out.
Draco’s head snapped up, his focus immediate and alert. He gazed searchingly at Harry for what seemed a long time, radiating more agony than Harry was in. Then Draco wobbled a tight, disbelieving shake of his head, and leaned in, and kissed him. The kiss felt like it went on and on, the way Draco’s gaze had, soft and shivering and excruciatingly good, spiralling Harry’s heart to reaches he’d not known existed inside himself. Harry contributed to it as well as he could, but when Draco pulled away, his face was twisted, crumpled, and his eyes were glassy with tears. Staring at Harry, he blinked several times and schooled his expression — not very well, but enough to fool anyone who didn’t know what Harry finally did.
, two weeks left, before we’d be able to leave.”
Malfoy chews, contemplating that. His throat bobs when he swallows and he stares at nothing in the distance before inhaling for what seems a long time. Finally, a little haltingly, he says, “I— wondered if I was imagining that.” His mercurial eyes flick to Harry, and he worries his upper lip between his teeth. He shrugs one shoulder in a twitchy gesture, like someone might unsettle a fly that had landed on them, sounding cautious when he asks, “Why, do you think?”
“You’re dressed,” Harry croaked dumbly, blinking at the realisation Draco had never come to his room, but unable to process it yet. And Draco
“It’s not them,” he says under his breath, but Draco doesn’t take much comfort from it — not while Potter’s holding both his wand and machete so tightly, one in each hand.
“The former,” Harry says, sitting up as well. He pauses to put on his glasses and tips Draco a small smile. “Though I still maintain anyone with Inferi chasing them ought to curtail their ‘grooming habits’ to under thirty—”
All over his flat.
Draco’s calf tenses against Harry’s leg. “The game, of course.”
“Fine.”
“It’s fine,” Harry said. He caught Draco’s eyes and tried to transmit the sentiment with his own:
polite?” he asked. “I mean, at a certain point, the use of etiquette might be considered offensive in itself, right?”
, and
“When you shut up,” Harry said. “When you don't touch me.”
Harry heard the word like an echo, and then
“Aren’t you going to ask me if I fucked him?” he said later from the doorway of Harry’s room. He was leaned against the frame, arms folded, and Harry paused for only a second before continuing on to his wardrobe.
“What is it, Nev?” she asks when she’s finished, standing and slinging her bag over her shoulder.
Draco’s mouth opens. Closes. Again. “I— I don’t have my wand.”
“I’m yours,” Harry says, “and I don’t want anyone but you.”
“Good,” she says. Her lips tremble for a moment before she firms them. She clears her throat. “That’s very good to know. But I was referring to your Mr Weasley.”
It gave Harry something to talk about with Malfoy over dinner — not exactly a common interest, but at least a topic they could both focus on for the duration of their meal that didn’t leave Harry feeling angry and flustered, one that wasn’t accompanied by Malfoy’s imperious little smirk. Sometimes their conversations were merely bizarre:
Harry feels so full, stretched to breaking, burning for him. He slides his gaze sideways to meet Malfoy’s eyes.
“Good
Always for Draco.
“So what’s your plan? To run against me, with a week before voting would need to close?” Robards asked archly. “To make accusations that would make you look just as incompetent as the Wizengamot thinks you are when you're not able to find anything substantial? I’ve worked with these people for years. Decades, in some cases.”
Harry drank the potion and licked the tangy sweetness from his lips. He handed Draco the empty phial and said, “You didn’t save my life.”
“Oh.” Weasley blinked at a nudge from Granger. His voice was dull. “Thank you, Malfoy.”
“No, I don’t mean— I’m not avoiding anything.” Draco opens his mouth, closes it; a perplexed little groove fits itself between his eyebrows. “I’m sorry,” he says at last, and interrupts Harry’s protest by leaning in for another kiss. “Take your time,” he murmurs again, “and we’ll talk when you’re done.”
put it in me.”
"I know you only have an eight am class tomorrow, so please bring both a gown and a set of robes; he needs to practise dancing around formal wear," he said, the rough edges of his fluster gone. Parkinson nodded, grimacing, and Draco sighed. "Very well, let's begin."
“It's not that I don't… appreciate it,” Draco said stiffly. “But your— heroics—”
I spluttered. “I meant—”
Harry gurgles a strangled laugh but Draco has no time to smile back because they’re already off, streaking through the car park as fast as their legs will carry them. They tumble over each other into the vehicle, new Inferi hard on their tail, and manage to get the door shut behind them.
“What about you?” Face forward, Harry risked a sideways glance. “I thought you were supposed to be getting a Potions Mastery.”
Harry thought, helplessly.
“I—” Robards inhaled, the whisky in his glass trembling. “Well, I’m flattered, son—”
Draco sighs, looking put-out. “Maybe you can forgive me for trying to maintain our cease-fire for as long as I can. You’re forgetting that I know you, Harry, probably far too much about you, and if we—”
“If they could get hard-ons, I considered it,” Draco said, cutting into his quiche with the side of his fork. He took a bite, groaning softly as he chewed and swallowed. “I had more experience than you, regardless.”
Draco glances at him. “Probably best we hold off on that.”
“You think I’ve done something to
“Cheer up,” he advised Weasley, feeling remarkably cheerful himself, “lust potions wear off within a few weeks. Potter’s too decent to
Harry dragged his gaze from the wedding bands to his plate. He’d been hungry only moments ago, he was sure of it. He lifted the cover back onto his tray. “Hey— are you okay?”
“Perfect would have been watching your head roll,” says Draco. He purses his lips when Harry grins, nods to concede the point, and bounces slightly on the balls of his bare feet.
But it wasn’t the time, so he simply slipped his hand into the crook of Draco’s elbow and stepped close once more — thumbing the slender curvature of Draco’s bicep, feeling it flex as Draco escorted him out.
“Ah, yes.” Draco exaggerates his glance around them. “I think you might need to work on that. Seems you’ve overshot a little.”
“We should compliment Draco, too,” Arthur said to her, voice low. “Don’t you think?”
“You’re finally admitting you don’t understand clothing? To
,” he said, face wretched with the same want Harry felt, his eyes wild. He parted his lips to say something else, but Harry covered them with his own before he could — biting at them, pulling one between his teeth and then the other, sucking the slender bows plump, swollen, and running his tongue along the inside of them. Draco’s fingers tightened; he guided Harry’s head into a deeper slant, and met the skim of Harry’s tongue with his own, slick, hot.
“Which doesn’t mean she’d think he deserved you!”
“Love— you—” she said on a stifled, wheezing inhale. Her face had been white before, beneath the blood, but it took on a greyish cast, and just before her irises grew milky, Pansy’s gaze fell to the still-transfigured wand in his hand. “
Potter took another step, nose raised in the air. He’d obviously been outdoors; his cheeks and nose were pink, and his hair was windswept and scruffier than ever. He gave Draco a small, approving smile. “Julia would be proud.”
The result of it all was that the second batch of eggs went unmade, and they didn’t leave the modest rooms Draco had turned into a cosy home. Harry stayed away from Draco’s bedside drawer, and Draco took to sitting on his face whenever Harry mentioned the gala, so Harry mentioned it often. A compromise. Harry puttered around peacefully and read Draco’s books when Draco had a customer, and when he didn’t they found ways to keep themselves occupied. During the lulls between fighting and fucking, they learned more about each other, their conversations hushed and broken by kisses.

good, Harry.”
Draco peels off his right glove — it only makes sense, if Potter is determined to stand between him any threat they face — but Potter shakes his head. Draco glares at him and finishes removing the thing, then shoves his hand into the left pocket of Potter’s coat. Potter automatically reaches to stop him but goes still, face arrested, eyes flicking between Draco’s searching hand and his face. A wicked slice over the pad of Draco’s forefinger indicates he’s found what he’s looking for, and he grabs it, pulls it out. Potter inhales sharply through his nose.
“Not that he bothered asking me first,” Draco said, rolling his eyes, “but
“What is it?”
I'm fortunate to be sitting with my lap hidden under the kitchen table. I affect boredom as well as I can. "Yes,
get married, it won’t be until I’m thirty at least,” Pansy continued, disregarding that, “and it’ll be to someone who can’t get enough of me.”
He didn’t comment further. Harry looked at his face, and didn’t ask.
dated men like Potter, he liked men who— “That’s what I mean; they’re always well dressed and elegant, powerful, usually more pretentious than you are, and almost always dull as mud,” Blaise interrupted him to say. “The panel is still out on how boring he is, and I doubt he’s pretentious, but I’ve got no clue why getting a hard-on around him this afternoon is something you’d need to whinge at me about for over an hour, because he’s
Harry measures his exhale in seconds to slow the flip in his stomach. He looks up at the canvas top of the tent. He doesn’t want to know what expression he's wearing that provoked Draco’s question, not that he's able to answer anyway. Draco’s right. They
“Just enough to make the way nice and slippery,” he says. “Why, did you want to do it?”
“I—” Draco’s breath smelled like sweetened tea, his eyes glazed on Harry’s face. “We… We have an appointment.”
“No.”
“That nothing I did?”
“What d’you mean?” Harry glanced at the empty space where Draco had stood as though he might materialise again, his face warming at the contemplative arch of Hermione’s eyebrow. “He was polite.”
Potter hesitates in the act of taking off his jacket, lips thinning. He slips a hand in his right pocket and pulls out a small, leather bag. “The fabric surrounding us will prevent skin contact long enough for us to take these,” he says, wrangling open the drawstring cord that holds the bag closed. “They won’t be useful in a fight, and need to be saved for an emergency
It was also ground zero.
When he opens them, it’s still raining, but a bleary light seeps in through their tent. He rubs the gritty blur from his eyes and looks up. Harry's gaze is on him, eyes dark and full of questions. Draco waits, heart kicking hard. He feels balanced on the edge of some unknown precipice. But after several seconds, Harry only expels a trembling breath, then sits up and moves away.
He lowered his hand and Malfoy sagged again, watching Harry with eyes that seemed too large for his face. Malfoy slid his spine upwards against the frame to regain his full height and directed his gaze at the floor.
, people on the lower rungs of the DMLE disappearing or sending in their resignations with no notice. But they were the people who dealt with the filing, the scheduling, the mundane aspects that kept the Aurors running smoothly; by the time anyone had realised there was something bigger going on, the department was in a state of organisational semi-chaos. The first two Aurors had been taken out with ease, their Owls regarding taking holiday time not even checked for forgery until it was too late.
“Potter,” Malfoy said, twisting to press his mouth to Harry’s ear. “Put your legs together.”
, was all he could come up with, and
— but then Malfoy thrust the Cloak into Harry’s hands and walked back over to Harry’s wardrobe.
Minerva shakes her head, eyes brightening with moisture. “She hasn't told us any more. Hermione.” She stands, rounds the desk. In a rare display, she covers Hermione’s hands, encasing them in warmth so suddenly Hermione realises how icy her own hands have gone. “Listen to me, child. Hogwarts has faced— Well, many, many things, and it’s survived them all. And so have you. Not all hope is lost.”
,” he tells them all. He pulls Potter deeper into the (frustratingly tasteful) living room, and turns back to him. “But I might be persuaded to stay."
Harry starts, exhales. Inevitable as it was that Draco — too smart not to ask himself the right questions, based on context clues — would figure out what Hermione really said, Harry had still held out the hope he wouldn’t be quite so accurate. He doesn’t suppose he’ll get any credit for not obeying her instructions to the letter, though.
“What?” Harry looked over. I profile, Draco looked normal. Better than. Sitting up tall in bed, the relaxed curve of his bicep and narrow line of his waist exposed, the jut of his shoulder, flax hair glossy and tumbled, the way it looked after—
“Thought he wouldn’t keep it?” Harry asked, closing his fingers and tucking the wand away, close to his heart. “Then you’re a bigger idiot than you are a liar. But I won’t use it,” he said. Robards gaze came up; his face was shaken. Sick. Harry shoved down the gratification he got over that — just a little longer. “I won’t use the wand. I won’t tell anyone about it. Not if you go to Kingsley right now and confess the rest.”
“I— No,” Malfoy says, gaze on Harry's hands. He licks his lips, still straining for contact. “I— I killed— Before they could change. My coworkers. Two— of my,” his voice cracks, “friends. They were—”
“Hydrus?”
With a bemused glance at the other Unspeakables, he says, “All of the elves have volunteered, without exception. We’ve been using older elves, because their magic continues growing as they age until it peaks, at which point—”
“What?” Draco asked.
Draco was surprised to find madness so overwhelmingly good; for years, he’d assumed it must be unpleasant, but no, it was really quite nice. And
, intention and balance, energy, add alexandrite?? Cross check good fortune charms against wood and core.
“It’s not,” Harry said, Draco’s wrist at his mouth, upturned, the criss-cross of sapphire veins, the bracelet of their last names together. Not sure which of them was trembling, Harry tasted his pulse; he counted the beats of Draco’s heart against his tongue and sighed, shakily, over Draco’s dampened skin. It felt impossible, to want something so much.
That by itself probably wouldn’t be considered very strange; though Harry couldn’t remember ever having seen a bicycle in Hogsmeade before, he knew some families lived in the area surrounding the village, which had to include children, and probably some whose parents were Muggle-born. A bike, alone, made perfect sense.
“Out there, I mean,” Potter says. “It’s too dangerous. It’s dangerous

He never thinks to ask how it ends.
Harry lifted one shoulder. “You. This.”
“So are we.”

, just want to.”
“Ninth or tenth, more likely; apparently I’ve got so many of them,” Draco says, not caring if he sounds bitter.
“Is that a question or a truth?”
“Consider it done.” Harry watched him go, a burst of warmth thrumming inside him, then picked up his quill and dashed off,
“That’s rather unfair, isn’t it?” Harry asked. He finished removing his shoes and socks, tucked them under his chair. “When I haven’t touched you in days. Ever since,” he added tightly, “you stopped wanting me to.”
“I mean
Stepping away, Harry eyes the balcony nearest to them — two metres in distance, at the most. Malfoy’s always been a dramatic bastard; Harry doesn’t know why he expected the apocalypse might change that. Still, it’s roughly the length of a fully-grown man, and it’s not like they have a lot of space to start at a run. Harry shoots the broom straight across, barely letting it clatter to the stone before grabbing the bags from Malfoy’s unresisting shoulders and tossing them over too. At their thuds onto the other balcony, Malfoy finally seems to understand what’s happening, and drags his gaze from the Inferi who’re apparently trying to claw through the glass.
“I am.” Malfoy sounded surprised and pulled to a stop. The edge of Hogsmeade was perhaps a few hundred feet away, but Harry stopped too, pulse picking up once more. Malfoy blinked a few times and said, “The Headmistress got Slughorn to agree to let me apprentice under him. How did you think I was going to get my accreditation?”
, dampening the inside of Draco’s pants.
“Oh, didn’t you hear?” Potter spread his legs under the table, bracketing Draco’s with them. Draco stared down at his sprawl for a beat, dragged his eyes back up, and found Potter watching him.
Minerva doesn’t belabour the point. “And Narcissa? Would you like me to accompany you?”
“Harry,” Draco says, stifled, against his cheek. His cock is slippery between them, pushing through the tracks of his own precome, and he increases the grind of his hips. “
As if Harry’s going anywhere.

“Harry,” he said, a murmur of sound, nearly voiceless. “I want you, too.”
again. They’d been too cautious of showering very often in the hotel, and Draco feels like he’s covered in fifteen layers of filth. He waits impatiently by the break of trees for Potter to catch up, and can’t help his glare when Potter’s first words are, “They can hide underwater; we need to make sure there are none in there.”
“Okay,” Harry said, concerned. He searched her face. “Then you won’t be.”
sweet — and terrible, too, because
Harry didn’t ask, as Kreacher seemed to expect. He kept himself busy writing letters, working. But he paused by Draco’s door when he went downstairs in the morning — and on his way up to the wandmaker’s cabinet — and up to his room at night. The strains of music that sometimes accompanied Draco’s spellwork sounded, and the tearing of fabric, and the
And so it went: sex, and sleep, and food, and, eventually, mysteriously pungent salves. They fed the birds together in the mornings; wandered down to the kitchens to deter Kreacher from coming back to the bedroom at inopportune moments. Talking about things as they came up, allowing the rest to flow under the new bridge between them. Harry learned when to wake Draco when he jerked and made a distressed sound in his sleep, when to leave him be, and how to decipher whether he should ask questions. And then in the bath, still sheathed and trembling inside Draco, Draco's long legs locked around Harry's waist, his chest the perfect spot to muffle Harry's groans, learned how deep his own willingness to talk went. Felt shaken to the core when Draco stayed in his lap after and ran hands over him, a certain, specific care to his touch — a skim on Harry’s forehead, and the Basilik fang marks on his forearm, and the silvery sketch of words on the back of his hand. He held his breath as Draco pressed a palm to the oval burnt into Harry’s chest above his racing heartbeat and then faltered, prodding the skin beside it.
Harry moved to his chair and did the same. “Thanks, Kreacher.”
And then, Malfoy showed up to supper.
“Yes.” They don’t report to her of course, but seem to understand the importance of sharing information, at least for now, and that’s something Hermione can appreciate. She glances at the gauge that signifies when it’s safe enough to contact Harry. The amount of magic they’re redirecting into the wards has it rising slower and slower; the gauge barely cleared the bottom ‘safe’ tick. But she sent Harry after Malfoy days ago and it’s unlikely they’d still be in the nearby vicinity. If she contacts Harry and makes him pull his coin unnecessarily, she could be putting her plan for better communication at risk. Could be putting him in even more jeopardy.
“Well done!” Surprised into a genuine smile, Hermione pats his arm but pauses as something occurs to her. “They don’t need a stasis charm to remain fresh or anything?”
Potter gives him a quizzical look. “I don’t think they qualify as human anymore.”
Glaring, Draco surprises Harry with a beat that knocks his blade to the side with the soft screech of metal-on-metal. He lunges and Harry bends back, evading Draco’s swing by mere inches before parrying, the shaft of his weapon angling across his chest to block Draco’s second and third swings, which grow increasingly sloppy as his frustration mounts. They engage in a flurry of counters — up, down, high inside — that push Draco from the foot of ground he gained with his original moves and back into his starting position, and then back further. A panting laugh breaks free from Harry's throat when Draco growls and drops, propping himself with one hand flat on the floor as he jabs the tip of his sword upward, and he nearly catches Harry in the thigh, but Harry jumps back in time. His hip knocks into one of the filing cabinets; it clangs against the wall, sheafs of papers falling from the top and thumping against the floor.
Everyone had, by then, entered into the same unspoken pact: If George is smiling, play along. But Harry couldn't stop himself from glancing at Ron.
“The whole place!”
Draco cleared his throat. “I know it’s a mixed gift, but I had to use the Black family thread, and it wouldn’t let me remove any of the names. But I managed to cover them so they’re not visible, and I'll keep experimenting on—”
“Been stewing on that, have you?” Draco says, releasing Harry’s thumb. He doesn’t look up from where he’s driving Harry to madness with his hand, but a tiny, smug smile ticks up at one corner of his mouth. “Good. I could make you feel so good, if you like. I’ve wanted to for a while.” His hand speeds up, voice dropping and softening. “For so long.”
“Yeah, I got an Owl from Nev.” Potter took another sip. “He asked me to let you know that Hannah’s not feeling well.”
Harry frowned, declining to play along. He’d put on the same robes Draco had chosen for him the first time the Malfoys had intended to call, but Draco wore neither robes, nor his swashbuckling wizard attire. Instead, he’d chosen a Muggle suit in black. He’d left off the jacket, and the severe tailoring of his waistcoat hugged the line of his ribcage; his tie was crimson, his watch fob and collar-studs, gold; his shirt a snowy white
Potter stared at him. His face split open with a sudden grin and he brought Draco’s fingers back to him. He applied pressure to them with his thumb, pushing them in a little, oh sweet Merlin.
and—”
drawn to him. “What you said, about how you and Pansy used to call each other every day…”
“I’ll get it,” she said, then paused in the act of shoo-ing them off. Her gaze took on a glint that made Draco decidedly nervous. “
“What—” Harry gulped in a breath, relieved. Probably. “What do you owe her?”
“But we’d still have you.”
“I may perish with anticipation.”
“I see.” Narcissa pursed her lips. “Well, I’m certainly glad he hasn’t proven to be a disappointment in other ways,” she said, gesturing to the trimmed tree. It sparkled off-centre of the window, glamoured with a finish of fairy lights.
“Then—”
“Good to know.” Malfoy sat back. “Wouldn’t want your reputation to suffer too badly. It might be of use to me, especially if it’s going to reflect on me somehow.”
“Nothing.” Harry squirms the bags off his back and picks up the broom with his good arm. The whole thing’s got to have taken less than a minute, but if they were short on time before, they’re bleeding it now. He can worry about a wrenched shoulder when they’re out. “Put those on. You’re trained to lend magic, right?”
“I saw.” Draco swallows. “Alright?”
“You weren’t like this in school,” Harry finally said, and Draco scoffed.
“Any functional system can get congested or blocked with the wrong sort of energy,” Malfoy said after a few beats, no longer sounding so amused. “Like a wrench thrown into Muggle machinery. It’s the same with the magical network, those extra nerves and chromosomes we have that connect with our nervous systems. When it starts to get dodgy, people experience it with a variety of symptoms: exhaustion, frustration, anxiety, unreliable magic, et cetera. What I do boosts the flow. Strips away the—.”
“I don’t want to read it,” Harry said, refusing to take it. He stepped back, watched the letter flutter to the floor between them. Felt on his cheek that Draco was looking at them now, and made the effort to keep his voice calm. “I believe you.”
Malfoy started to smile, seemed to catch himself. His jaw knotted, squaring off a touch. Though Harry suspected he’d stay slender and pointy-faced, the weight Malfoy had gained back over the last year looked good on him. So did the sun he inevitably got in detention with Harry every day after classes, which soaked into the glossy strands of his pale hair and added a sort of glow to his complexion. Harry felt mostly okay noticing those kinds of things about guys now, even if noticing them about Malfoy had rattled him at the beginning of the year. The unexpected part was his own flush of pride over the half-twist of Malfoy’s smile before Malfoy schooled his expression.
“It will be Christmas, in a few weeks,” Draco said.
Draco picks up his bag and makes his way to Potter’s side, awareness zipping through him like little aftershocks. Potter’s pupils are huge; he’s panting lightly. With a slightly strained voice, he says, “I had to unleash…”
Harry swallowed, and slipped the button free. “Today,” he agreed, inching his fingers to the last one. The material collapsed forward and Draco’s cock sprang free, pink and full and risen upward. Harry smoothed his hands down the tops of Draco’s thighs; they flexed, parting. “Once.”
Either way, they’d pushed through enough rounds of whatever conditioning and strengthening exercises Harry could think up: laps, push-ups, sit-ups, lunges, curls. He eats when Harry says and drinks when he says, bathes and sleeps when Harry says, and with proper food, hydration, and rest, by the fourth morning Malfoy’s only lagging behind Harry by one of anything per set, if that.
Draco inhales sharply, the pressure increasing on Harry’s nape. “You could’ve,” he says after a pause, as though the end of that statement doesn’t matter. “I wanted you to. So we’re both a right mess, aren’t we?” He gives Harry a light squeeze, and then his hand falls away. “Come on, Potter. Don’t want to keep Granger waiting.”
He liked the flat he'd moved into on his own just fine, but working the hours he did left it with a silent, sterile quality he could never seem to get rid of, even when he left the wireless on or avoided laundry for a few days. He’d tried to spruce it up more than once, but Neville wouldn’t even let him
“I thought you said you’d use that coin of yours to let her know we hadn’t figured it out.” Draco tastes his own dinner, swallowing a moan along with the imprudently-sized bite he’s taken — it’s rich with fat, salty, and he shoots Harry an appreciative look as he begins eating in earnest.
” I threw myself back against my pillow. “We’ll just be madly in love, shall we? Work together, eat together, go on holiday and fuck each other’s brains out, and forget the rest of it. How does that sound!”
“Anyway, I have a little more leeway. It— hurts.” She grimaced. “But not as much. I can get more out. If I think you need to know.”
“I have a lot of things here,” Draco says, and Harry realises. He swallows.
Brutally fast, a tube smacked into his hand. Draco scrambled to adjust his position, eyes wide and chest heaving, hair dripping water against the reflection of the back of his head as he pulled his knees up to prop his heels on the edge of the counter, thighs wantonly spread. His cock was curved hard against his rippling stomach, a heavy lean toward the jut of his hip, and Harry stared at it for a moment before dropping his gaze down over Draco’s neat, tightening balls to his exposed arsehole: pink, tight, furled. Pretty. Hands shaking with want, Harry thumbed open the lid of the tube; he squeezed a generous amount over two fingers. Hesitated. Looking up to Draco’s face, he stroked the lube on his fingers over his own cock.
Harry dragged in a breath and glanced at her to find her frowning. Her head was tilted, her bun listing to the side.
Potter halts, body bent in a half-crouch above the sofa. He looks at Draco and rises. Turns to look over the back of it.
“—because Hermione is vicious, remember when she set Snape’s

in a low, comforting voice, and,
The edges of Harry’s vision blot out, and he makes himself inhale. He pries the phone from his ear, holds it out. “Your mum is at Hogwarts,” he says flatly. “She wants to speak to you; you’ll have about a minute.”
“Fairly sure it’s a binding—” Blaise said, and Pansy sank her nails so deep into his bicep that Draco winced.
Draco’s heart pounds in his throat. He feels a bit sick, and a lot like Apparating away, and a little like laughing, and sort of like crying, too, which generally makes him angry, but — fuck it. Bring on the chaos.
Harry nodded distractedly — work was the one subject about which he always knew what to say — and took a moment to soak in the rest of it. “What do you mean by ‘inaccessibility’?”
It’s a rhetorical question, so Harry doesn’t answer. He points to the lonely petrol station they’ve been approaching. “It’s probably ransacked but do you want to see if there’s anything left?” he asks. He hadn’t exactly given Malfoy the choice of stopping earlier. He can’t really apologise for that — Malfoy’s trainers were perhaps a single hard day’s walk from losing their soles, and the rest of his clothes didn’t offer much in the way of protection — but he can at least give him the option, now. He's probably traumatised Malfoy enough for one day. “Then we’d not have to dip into our own supplies. We need to stop and eat, anyway.”
But none of that changes the fact that Teddy’s wet the bed for the third time in a row, or that he’s been sobbing like his heart is broken ever since.
“What?” Malfoy shook his head, a half-grimace twisting his mouth, and Harry bit down on his lips. “Potter, are you mad? The whole point is— Oh sod
“I—” Draco took a breath, shifting, pulling back a little, enough to leave Harry’s hand empty. “I tried to fly my father’s broom,” he said. The pink in his cheeks looked like spring, and Harry balled up his hand and pressed it to his side to keep from touching that, too. “I fell onto the gravel in the drive of the Manor and broke my leg in two places. Everyone was so busy tending to that, no one noticed the cut. By the time they had, it was too late to fix.”
