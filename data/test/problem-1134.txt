They’d all clammered over him. Mrs. Anderson had shrieked when he’d passed out suddenly. However Narcissa had taken over and the women had run off to the infirmary, Severus had given him one firm nod and run off to alert the children and keep them calm. Lucius had wished him luck with a hard look in his eyes before following his wife. Sirius had his own ‘errand’ to run.
His Lord and the other adults froze, staring at his son’s hand. Draco paused, giving his mate a quick glance up and down. Hadrian usually morphed the love bites away, so there were no marks. The blonde frowned a little bit in confusion when his uncle and his lord leveled him with twin venomous glares. Draco blinked again, the shimmer of red catching his eye.
Lily would come back to an untouched plate sitting outside the door. The only reason he didn’t throw it was because Tippy would have to clean in. James beat him for the offense anyway when Lily ran downstairs crying.
“Okay. Draco wanted me to try something. If you know it, it’s called Legilimens. This is going to hurt unless you are aware and accepting of me going into your psyche. Would you like me to do so?” The brunet brushed his hair over his shoulder and relaxed against the table with a gentle smile.
Something a bit lighter and funnier before we start getting into the climax of the fic! (I got plans like you wouldn't believe my friends >:)
“We should get our robes on. We’re going to be at the school soon.” The train ride was supposed to be hours, but it had only felt like minutes to Hadrian’s surprise and delight. Their robes swished with their steps in the dying evening light as the train slowed to a stop and all the first years were dragged along by a very tall man into river boats. Hadrian felt a dim light of anxiety in his chest as he glanced back at the train. Laney felt the discomfort and granted a small mercy.
“I’ve heard you’re a Metamorphagus, is that your effortless or just your preferred appearance?” The words tumbled out of his mouth before he thought of just how rude he was being. He was relieved as instead of being offended by the blunt question the younger man smiled softly, eyes glancing at Draco.
If you have any opinions about how you want this posting schedule to go, lmk and I hope you enjoy this little angst fest!
“Hey Draco, where do they put our luggage? They kept both our animals with it and I’m worried for them.” Draco gave a firm pat on her shoulder before maneuvering to walk between the two siblings. Crabbe and Goyle flanking behind by a step and forming a protective ‘V’ formation. Hadrian was rather impressed with the practiced smoothness of the gesture.
The two were a sight to behold. The shorter woman was more stout, with caramel skin and brown curls that seemed to bleed warmth like a beach sun, her smile was easy and bright as another woman loomed over her. This woman was lean, with skinny but strong limbs and pin straight blonde hair that was held in a high ponytail on her head. Her eyes were cool and lips firmly in a blank scowl. Snape had to pause for a moment when the resemblance got a little two uncanny towards his newest duo of troublemakers. The shorter woman reached a hand out to him.
“Hadrian is much scarier than you, if Potter weren’t so obsessed with him we could probably get Hadrian to cow him into submission with a glare.”
“What would be quicker? Waiting for a warrant as is or filing all the paperwork to destroy Potter legally and then gaining the warrant?”
Alex sat down on the stool with a small glance at the side. Hadrian’s friends had all been thrown to the snakes! It was perfect, when he was in his rightful house with Alex he’d see how he was supposed to act. Right now, standing there on his own, he already looked so much better, his posture was still straight, but his hands tucked into his pockets. Shoulders back with easy and powerful grace. He wasn’t more powerful than Alex, but having some intimidation to back him up was always good. That’s why Draco ran with Crabbe and Goyle after all. He almost reminded Alex of Uncle Sirius.
Their reputation untainted and in the clear from the hurled accusation, Hadrian had two weeks to figure out the plan to end his brother’s beloved social life and turn it into a PR nightmare when Alex did all the work for him.
“Erin here is a little magic, she never tried to be an active part in the wizarding world however. She’s a high ranking officer in an international anti-bio-terrorism unit, but she was certain to bring both muggle and magic culture into the house when Harry joined our family. Also the books certainly helped us understand that our other two daughters were showing signs of accidental magic as well. I was wondering why the hell I kept losing the TV remote when it was time for bed.” Snape raised a brow. Erin answered.
It was like being in a house of over emotional toddlers. One didn’t understand basic human decency, one wanted everything to go her way, and one liked to hit. Hadrian was grateful Annabee’s tantrums were far and free between and that her biting phase was extremely short lived when he played the big brother card and told her how disappointed he was. Her little sobs had been heartbreaking when she’d realized how upset hitting made him, but she’d never bitten another kid at the farmer’s market again and Hadrian had showered her in kisses and cuddles after timeout.
, but Hadrian walked in from the kitchen and any soft disappointment faded away. Hadrian’s long dark hair was held up in his signature high ponytail, bangs and fringe gently curling around those wide cheeks. A short apron tightened his waist to an impossible angle and hid a good portion of his sinfully tight light blue jeans and his maroon V-neck.
The only thing that held him back from lunging at the little prat was the pain in his leg, the fear of death, and James Potter glaring at him as if daring him to disobey. As it stood, Hadrian found it easier at each meal to ignore the food and everyone there. Let himself waste away and laugh as the ones who ‘loved’ him. Simply watched it happened.
Though, with how the day was going. She had little hope for him, she’d thought by the end of the day she’d get her boys to work out their problems and things could go back to how they were once. Peaceful, with Harry and Alex living and balancing each other out. James could have two sons to spoil rotten, losing Harry had been a hard hit. James hadn’t meant to be so hard on the boy Lily was sure. But he had gotten into the bad habit of resenting his brother like Albus had warned them about. That he might be a squib only seemed to heighten the animosity.
Annabee cheered with Laney and Draco raised his hand excitedly. Mama ruffled the blonde’s hair and smiled at Lucius as they all began migrating to the hall. “I’ll use the floo to give a quick call to Severus to come join us. You don’t think he’s busy do you?”
Snape rolled his eyes, “I’m aware. Draco and Laney ganged up on an unfortunate Gryffindor yesterday in Potions when Hadrian continued to be unable to speak in my class. My house is filled with more introverted students so I don’t expect it to be an issue. Your daughter’s rowdiness is definitely the more… noticeable quirk between the two.” Erin gave a half smirk that mirrored Laney’s easily.
Soon, they were all pulled into the Slytherin Common Rooms, which were oddly enough in the dungeons. Hadrian wasn’t complaining however; the air was nice and cool. Dark and comfortable, his sister squeezed his hand. It seemed she liked it too as she admired the green and silver drapes, she mused quietly aloud.
Settling down. Hadrian stripped to just his thin button up and his slacks. It was better to do it naked, but if he needed a quick escape he’d need clothes so he didn’t streak through Potter Manor. (Though the idea of escaping James while buck ass nude did inspire a delirious sort of hysterical amusement). These were the lightest clothes here. Plus, he couldn’t bring himself to put on the hand-me-downs in the closet. He’d rather feel disgusting physically than subject himself the mental torture the past would conjure up in his mind. The circle was blood, but just in case, he held his hands up and keep his weeping injury skyward and began to mutter, feeling the circle closing and encasing him. Unable to move until it was finished.
The dark haired boy didn’t even meet his gaze however, too busy staring at other people as the hat above him yelled Gryffindor and he was off to join Ron and wait eagerly for his brother as McGonagall continued to listen before yelling out with a small tone of confusion.
“Draco! I thought you had school?” Draco’s face uncontrollably split into a wide smile. A feral part of his mind purred,
Hadrian’s adopted parents resembled the two Dragmas. It was made more difficult when physically Snape saw the uncanny resemblance James held toward both his sons, but expressively wise was nowhere near like Hadrian.
An icicle had formed in his chest, sharp, cold, and aching as he held his husband. His magic lashed out dangerously, shattering one of Severus’ empty vials while leaving the impromptu cauldron alone and brewing in the corner of the room. His baby. His son had suffered, and Tom was going to make sure every guilty person was punished thoroughly.
Dark and murky, the water beneath the ice swirled agitated and aggressively. Severus placed a foot on the edge, cracking the surface slightly and gasping as the memory washed over him.
Said mentor was relaxing on the patio next to the tree, enjoying a shady spot under the veranda with his wife. Sipping at what was either a fire whiskey or an iced tea. Narcissa sipping at a glass of water beside him.
“With all the respect in the world, why are we here? You say the Potters regret their actions, but it was to protect Hadrian. But what child below Hogwarts age needs magic for protection? Alexander was at much at risk in their care, yet he was the one they kept. There is also the fact that we are trying to tear a child away from two mothers who have raised him and housed him with no aid from his parents who even after the adoption sent no letters, no yule gifts, no visits. Here we are trying to tear a son from the family that raised him legally and uncontested for four years and who is vocal in wanting to stay with his mothers. One who has even protested visitation with the family who abandoned him to muggle relatives without a glance back. Parents who are trying to use the effect their neglect had on him as a weapon in this trial against the parents who have done nothing by heal and treat Mr. Dragma as their own. Do you really want to destroy a family and return a child to a place they are afraid of going back to?” Albus looked enraged, especially as the thinly veiled ideas of disregard and the blatant proof of neglect had many of the Lords glancing piteously at the two mothers who were holding their three children tightly. Lucius suppressed a smirk, he was certainly confident off the get go Hadrian thought.
“Their birthdays are eight days apart and Laney declared that that made them pseudo-twins. Hadrian never argues or disagrees with anything really, so he just accepted it and so did we. It helps that when we throw joint parties they seem more pleased then jealous at sharing a birthday. Annabee was very little when we adopted Hadrian so she’d never known anything different I guess.” Sara swatted her wife.
Narcissa smiled, “We should do a heritage test at Gringotts today! We all could use a nice rest, we can explore Diagon Alley and make a fun day out of it. What do you think? Draco?”
Laney cursed, “Damn it, I wasn’t done plotting. Oh well, we only have double potions then we can do and hide out in the common room can’t we? Or grab Suni and use her to ward off any of the Gryffindor.”
Although he griped about wearing an uncomfortable glamour their lord was quickly swayed with the promise of a relaxing and
“I’m looking into that now.” Mother was ice cold fury as she spoke in low tones with Lucius, hands twitching as if looking for her magnum. Lucius was rifling through different law books and sending owl after owl out to various connections at the Ministry and other powerful Lords.
All when he had parents, biological, living parents. Who, by the way Severus was clinging to him, would have loved and cherished him deeply his whole life. All those children he was jealous of growing up, the ones with doting parents. Who grew up, even if they were poor and just as raggedy as Harry had been in his hand me downs, loved. He could have been loved. The man’s long and thin hands curled into Hadrian’s scalp, renewing the tears that burned on his cheeks. Hadrian barely heard it when the doors to the private office at Gringotts’s burst open.
“First, let’s dissuade you of this notion that you will ever leave here. As Head of the Potter house you will
Yule break started on the right note, they were to take the train to Draco’s house, where their parents and them would be staying until after the court case and the holidays. The snow was falling like a winter wonderland, sandwiched between his best friend and his sister and coming home to a large manor where a toddler flung herself into his arms.
No, disrespecting his family had consequences. Hadrian didn’t plan on stopping until Alex was firmly trashed in the eyes of his peers. However, for all his careful planning what he hadn’t expect his brother to do all the work for him.
“Holy, you both look like my brother and don’t look like him at all. That’s a weird line to tip toe and I don’t like it. Still. Wild.”
Hadrian was Draco’s heaven outside of the wizarding world. Though, he was definitely a wizard (and god he hoped he was maybe a half-blood because then he would have half a chance at convincing his father that this was okay). He was still Draco’s.
The dark-haired man gasped and stepped back, Hadrian looked at him, slightly haunted and pale. But the boy still looked into his eyes and stepped closer to him.
“Welcome to the family, Hadrian. I’m glad my son found his one so easily.” Draco swept Hadrian’s long hair off his shoulder absentmindedly when Hadrian sat back down. Which Nagini seemed to take as an invitation to slither up onto Hadrian’s shoulders. His Lord stiffened, hissing.
Alex was sitting nearly six feet away from the other three and each time he tried to scoot closer Laney simply turned towards him spitting proverbial fire and glaring. Hadrian was laying on his back with the little one using his chest as a pillow and seemed more than happy to just lie there and let it happen. Severus had to bite his lip hard as Alex crept forward and Laney threw a pen at him while hissing viciously.
“What are you doing?!” Hadrian’s grin was manic on top of him and it was beginning to scare the ‘other’ Potter. “Aren’t you supposed to be grounded in your room?”
A medium, he’d need one for the ritual circle. The only material thing he would need as long as he memorized the words he would need efficiently enough. The wards would scream if Hadrian tried to smuggle the book into his room for guidance, so memorizing was the only option. He should only need chalk or paint, something that would last and not get brushed away by a draft or swirl of magic. Not that his loving ‘father’ would ever give him access to anything like that. After that last visit he’d left Hadrian bloodied up and taken everything useful or studious for him to do, or for him to use against them.
“No, conflict of interest. Albus is a well known family friend, especially when we let him become Alex’s godfather. Any court case with us bars him from voting or having anything to do with the jury or hearing.”
Perhaps tutoring wouldn’t remiss with those three… A small explosion sounded and the two laughed softly, grinning like children with an inside joke, or a secret. Snape snarling and yelling at Gryffindors while subtly trying to shape up his house’s side of the classroom.
Draco glanced up from his own letter and eyed the staff table with interest, frowning at something that Hadrian couldn’t see. The raven nudged him a bit as Laney collected their replies and waved down one of the post owls with a knut in her hand. Hadrian let his eyes ask his question and the blonde gave him a slightly bewildered smile.
Hadrian woke to a banging at the door, growling, Hadrian crawled out from under the bed. Glaring at the door angrily.
“Of course Lucius, I’d be delighted to do dinner with you and your wife. I have a toddler if that’s okay?”
“Five years and I hadn’t heard a word about this?” Draco looked for help but found all three men sipped their tea and avoiding eye contact. Even Hadrian wasn’t paying real attention, instead looking intently at the snake that had slithered just beneath his crossed legs. Hadrian was obsessed with snakes and a Parseltongue, so Draco really wasn’t all surprised.
“Biologically? No clue. Mama and Mother are aware of magic, Mama has none. Mother might, but she was never schooled and I don’t think she’s ever been interested in pursuing it more than she has already for herself. But both of them worked really hard to work both the wizarding world and the muggle world into our home. Especially when this moron was adopted.” Laney jerked a thumb at him. Hadrian picked up the que.
With a cruel snarl, James threw a cutting hex from the safety of the wards. Hadrian gritted his teeth and held back a scream. Why did that man fucking love destroying his leg so much. Luckily, Hadrian had practice ignoring pain. So he kept running.
Sara turned on Lily immediately, smile sly and dangerously sweet, “How did you raise your son? Hadrian loves baking with me in the kitchen and gardening.” Lily balked.
“Maybe he won’t notice if we bolt to our next class, he can’t try to corner us if he can’t catch us.”
With that, the two women helped themselves to the floo and vanished with a flash of green. Severus hid his own smile and left the Potters shell-shocked in their chairs while he went back down into the dungeons. He had a few letters to pen after all, and godchildren to check on.
Alex and Harry hadn’t gotten along as children, especially when Alex began his tutoring. Harry had always looked at her with such sadness when she had to stop reading to him to work on teaching Alex to read. James hadn’t helped. Not understanding how his sons could be so different from each other, and one so different from him.
“He’ll visit if that’s what he wants. And only what he wants. I won’t force my son to see the people who abandoned him.” With that the two women brushed out of the office. Severus and the Potters hot on their heels where outside the office Severus had to smother the chuckle that threatened to escape.
Dumbledore cleared his throat, “Yes, I see. You mentioned Alex was quite upset when he met his brother again after so long. Do you know what happened?”
“Ah, you’re right. My platonic knight in shining armor. The brotherly prince to my damsel in distress.”
“Christmas, when he was nine. You screamed when I told him to let her wreak havoc on the neighbor’s mouse problem.”
This is the man who took his godson. The man he couldn’t recognize anymore. This was his enemy. He mourned for his godson and each spell was his fury at everything he missed due to James keeping him away from him and then sending him away.
“I know. I know. Lily was insistent to make him feel at home. That meant giving him free reign and hoping for the best. All he did was lock himself in his room and never come out until everyone was asleep. Surprised the little snake didn’t slit out throats in our sleep. He hurt Alex! And used his own blood for the disownment ritual.”
The image of a happy baby with big green eyes. Not seeing him anymore as James pushed and pushed Alex at him. The last time he’d seen his godson was the image of Hadrian looking out from the window. Eyes obscured by the window panes, hair messy long waves and laying his head down on the windowsill. Next thing Sirius knew he was gone.
Lily frowned and James sighed, watching her lightly pick at her food. Dark rich summer red hair curled like a waterfall around her face. Framing adorable freckles and those forest green eyes he’d be enraptured by since first year. Seeing her so unhappy always broke his heart. Which is why he couldn’t tell her everything. It would only upset her. If he kept it quiet, then he could wait until Albus let him tell the whole truth and she’d understand it was what he had to do. What had to be done.
Snapping back, Hadrian bit his tongue hard. Shit. Maybe he did need more therapy after all if this was what happened when he stopped going… The raven shook it off. He just needed to survive this meeting with the headmaster and take it one day at a time.
“Have Uncle Sev try Legilimency on you sometime. The fact you blackout entire school years isn’t normal. Anyway, there’s a war going on. Between Dark and Light, and everyone thinks the Light side is all sunshine, roses, and goodness. But, the dark side is being painted in a demonized light. Tom, our lord, was dragged into this war by the leader of the light side who manipulated him and then tried to kill him after killing a few very well-known wizards under Tom’s name. Now our lord was forced back into the light, people know he still lives and the war has been started all over again and we’re going to die unless we can clear the names of dark witches and wizards before they kill us all.” Hadrian frowned in thought, eyebrows scrunched up.
She looked so perfect, with brown near black curls and the biggest grey eyes looking up at him. Her face was scrunched up in confusion, until a tiny hand grabbed his nose with a loud giggle and a smile across both chubby cheeks.
“Hadrian.” The blond aristocrat kept his voice soft and nonthreatening as possible. The boy gave a slight nod, his sister was looking worriedly between the two of them. Hadrian blinked. “I promise, I’m not going to let anything happen to you. This will just be some questions to deviate your home life and how you’re doing, okay?”
Have I mentioning how frustrating and amusing it is to have a seven year old throw back you words at you. Exactly as you said them with the date and time you said them? It’s awful and funny!” Sara sighed. “I consider you kind of like a godfather anyway, I don’t really know what those are supposed to be. Not magical or religious here. But any legal godfather did nothing for my son, yet here you are… protecting him. Good enough for me.”
“Haden’s mine! Go ‘way!” The little girl burrowed her head into Hadrian’s collar and Alex was gifted with a poisonous glare from his biological twin. But just before a fight could break out and Dumbledore could intervene their mother straightened.
Draco was more than pleased to escort his mate through the alley. His hand on Draco’s arm as they looked at all the sweet shops, the quidditch store, that stupid joke shop run by the Weasels that unfortunately Hadrian seemed to adore. Draco’s favorite was the apothecary, listening to his Uncle and his boyfriend bicker about the proper way to brew (potions for his uncle and elixirs for his boyfriend, the same thing really, but Hadrian insisted a few elixirs differed from potions) before they bound together to spout theories on how to improve each other’s concoctions. Their lord seemed pleased to visit the book store, where Narcissa, him, and Draco were arguing on the legality of Dark Arts textbooks versus Defense Against the Dark Arts.
Immediately, it felt like shackles had dragged him down. Holding him in a vice grip and leaving Hadrian no choice but to collapse to the floor and wheeze. “Crucio! Give me your wand!”
“Oh cool! Harry’s got his pet snake Suni, she’s been his for years now. But I just got a new kitten and I’m still trying to get her used to me. I named her Marissa. Do you have any pets?” Draco grinned, not responding for a moment as they all stumbled into one boat before he spoke again.
With a blink of Draco’s eye, Hadrian had whipped out his wand. A rather plain, but efficient weapon as with a flick of his wrist and a murmur all the candles in the house flickered to life. An impressive show of magic, Draco had half a mind to swoon. Especially as the tension seemed to relax and dissipate almost immediately once Hadrian’s wand rested innocently on the table. His mother smiled brightly.
“What did you need me for? The rooms perfect!” Hadrian rolled his eyes and shoved Draco to sit on the end on the bed. Plopping down onto Draco’s lap so he couldn’t escape.
The circle folded itself to create a small path that Hadrian stumbled out of. The wards were buzzing curiously at him, still recognizing him as well as not really remembering the taste of his individual magic without the family blood. They poked and prodded at him. But as he’d been here so long and still tasted of Lady Magic’s influence, they ultimately left him alone. The raven grinned, bloody and victorious.
“Those two don’t, I have a black owl named Akumu. He was my mother’s but she got him when I was a baby and he imprinted of me, so she gifted him to me when I was ten so I could send my own letters. I wanna meet Hadrian’s snake though, what breed is it?” The long hair brunet answered for his sister.
“Long day.” Smiling, Hadrian didn’t look up from where he was braiding his hair for bed. It was already near three in the morning and they were all exhausted. Nagini was slumped, sleeping blissfully on the charmed heated blanket she’d insisted having on one of their nightstands after she realized Hadrian was her ‘hatchling’. It seemed she felt as if she’d failed him and Tom, now determined not to fail once more. Draco stood behind him, they’re eyes meeting in the mirror, he didn’t even blink at the blonde’s nervousness. He knew his nerves were shot, but the… abuse he’d survived allowed him to outwardly brush most things off for later.
Severus gently brushed his fingers through her hair. More shouting was beginning to echo down from the room. Along with a cold rumble that sent shivers down his spine. “No one will take your son. Sounds like your wife is going to freeze everyone with sheer will power.”
The table startled again, Draco included this time. His love had looked like his lord already and now he was basically the man’s (slightly more handsome) clone. His lord, though shocked, looked very amused. Raising a hand and pointing to his partner.
“Hadrian Dragma-Potter!” Hadrian winced as all the eyes turned to him. Shocked and confused, including the angry eyes that had been previously trained on his blood brother. He chanced a glance at the man. Onyx eyes met his and just stared. Not softly like his parent’s, but also not bitterly or angrily. More as if Hadrian were a puzzle.
“Firstly, how are the boys doing? Settling in alright?” Minerva, who’d been watching quietly started first.
“Really? Last I checked I’m the one who grew up with him. Oh my god this is a Twitches moment, isn’t it?” Hadrian snorted, a rather undignified sound, but it made Draco smile before listening mesmerized by the low, smooth drawl that left Hadrian’s mouth.
“Kindergarten? I’m so proud of you, did you have fun my darling, darling?” His voice bounded and bounced with a doting tone. The red haired girl smiled dreamily as the little girl cheered, still holding onto her son’s arm as the three migrated out of the office. Alex following as soon as Lily nodded her ascent.
Where Alex giggled madly and wrecked havoc on his broom, Harry had always looked up with those carbon copy eyes and happily sat in her lap. Listening to music or letting her read aloud to him from her charms book.
Hadrian leaned back and examined his lists. Every second here was a chance for him to be injured. And even complying meant suffering under the hands of James cruelty and Lily’s ignorance. What did you pick when there were no good options left?
“Grand castle, soft and warm yellow lights and a night sky with a lake? This is basically Mama’s photography wet dream.” All five of the eleven-year-olds stumbled out of the boat. Crabbe and Goyle talking between the two of themselves as they helped out the three distracted students out of the boats, gaining grateful smiles in return.
“Good morning love,” Hadrian smiled. Draco grumbled but smiled back. Glancing around the room at all the adults before his mate handed him a cup of coffee with his left hand. Right still clutching his half eaten pastry.
“Show me.” Hadrian didn’t bother to fight it, ignoring the gasps and the small sharp sob from Draco as he pulled down his small morph. Nothing changed, except the smoothness of his skin. Now there were scars marring him horribly, not many that could be seen as most were on his back or his limbs. He still grimaced as Severus, one of his fathers, traced the thick and gnarled scar across his neck. Fingers deftly sweeping back up, the tiny scar the cut the upper left of his lip, the long line under his left eye. All three caused by the same beer bottle that Uncle Vernon had sent hurtling at his head. The long and faded scar on his forehead was much smoother, nearly healed and unseen beneath his hairline.
“Met him. Didn’t like him. His ego crowds a room. Thought you didn’t want to associate with a bunch of
Draco soon shambled down the stairs. His parents following quickly behind him. The blonde looked relieved to plop himself down next to his paramour, stealing sips from the younger man’s mug. Hadrian didn’t bother chiding him, smiling indulgently. Lucius gratefully poured him and his wife some coffee and sat down at the table. Hadrian peeked around.
“We’re going to get him back Anna. We won the court hearing, the ministry can’t ignore his kidnapping. Even if they did, Hadrian’s smart, he’ll figure a way out and then he’ll be sitting on the patio smirking at us with that quiet smugness asking why we’re freaking out so bad and don’t we trust him? Then, we’ll make a plan to
“I don’t know Lily. And I’m not going to chance it until Harry is in our family firmly and we’ve won both the court case and gotten the boys to settle their differences. I won’t risk Harry manipulating Sirius into thinking he needs to get away from us or using Sirius against us. His word in court could be the difference between a loss and winning and Harry is being extremely bitter towards us right now, who knows what he’d tell Sirius to get him to let him stay with those women.”
Draco gave a large grin. “That’s my godfather Severus Snape. He’s the head of our house actually so you’ll get to meet him in just a minute when he joins us in the Slytherin common room. He can be a bit grumpy, but he’s cool once you get to know him. I think you’ll like him.”
“The women called that Death Eater scum lawyer; he’ll be representing them against us in Harry’s custody case this winter. I doubt he’ll see sense like any light lawyer and settle this out of court. It’s going to be a public spectacle and we’ll be dragged through the Wizengamot. Rita is going to be a nightmare if she gets wind of this. We’ll have to be careful with Alex’s PR.”
The tears fell silently down his partner’s tan cheeks as they always have. Draco took a step back to give his partner some privacy as his Uncle, Hadrian’s
“Let’s call this meeting adjourned for the time being as it seems the children have gone away. Would you all be amenable to meeting again soon? Alex is Harry’s brother and even if its just visits, don’t you want your son to know his birth family?” Erin frowned at him.
“Never call my sssister that ever again. Unlesss you’d like me to wring your neck until you are a lifelessss puddle on the floor.” Alexander paled until he was paper white and Hadrian released him, letting the lion slide to the floor as he returned to his friend’s sides. His arm shooting out to grab Laney as she giggled and swooned dramatically.
“Mother, Father, Uncle Sev, My Lord. This is Hadrian, my boyfriend.” Understandably, seeing as none of them had known he was gay or taken, his father and the dark lord were shocked and still. His Uncle Sev was more reserved, but curiosity was in his dark eyes as he appraised Hadrian with careful eyes. His mother had no such hesitation. Reaching out immediately with a hand.
Shoveling down the peanut butter sandwich the elf left him and silently thanking the creature, Harry tore through the book. Various forms of Potter Family Magic that he would never use it if killed him, but there was one thing in every Grimoire and it was what he needed to find. Hadrian’s grin was bloody and vicious when he finally found it near the back.
“Hadrian’s making a pot of coffee now, this conversation first. I need help.” Severus was wide awake. “It’s not big. Well, I think it is, but Hadrian has memory problems. Like he doesn’t remember months of his life, and something about it gives me a bad feeling and he won’t listen to me. So, I was wondering if…”
“He’s doing great, Alex is annoying, but our classes are awesome! I’m getting tutored, but Hadrian’s curb stomping the rest of us in lessons.”
Something about that didn’t sit right with her. But, he husband was an Auror, he knew the law better than she did. And she missed her little Harry. Everything would be okay, if Albus and James agreed nothing could go wrong. So, she didn’t question him. Only smiled warmly, brightening as he smiled back.
“Not a bad idea. Crabbe and Goyle are already down in the hall.” Hadrian sighed and just decided to skip the robe as Suni cheekily rested her head on his shoulder. At least she let him put on a tank top and pants. “Are you going to walk around like that.”
So Alex not only was responsible for points lost (an extreme 50 points) and detention for a month, Laney was also extremely well liked by quite a few people in all the houses. She was fun loving, and chaotic while still being sensitive and kind. Social rating for Alex plummeted. The most important consequence was one he hadn’t seen coming.
Hadrian was happy, lazily doting on his honeybee. Draco beside him trying to wrestle Suni into submission as the snake threw herself on top of every piano music sheet the blond pulled out to read and study. Laney was having the time of her life terrorizing the peacocks and Annabee was being spoiled rotten not only by him, but the Lady of the house as well. (Their mothers were both working and spending ‘quality time together’ and he couldn’t hear it through the walls. A plus).
“Haden! Haden!” Alex’s chest burned when that gained the first ever full blown smile he’d ever seen from his twin in all of their days together at home and now at school. It didn’t feel fair. He was his brother. He should get Harry’s smiles. His attention and doting. Instead, he watched as his taller brother curled around and coddled the tiny girl with his whole body, sharing his space with both girls that were
“Ah, Sara Anderson and Erin Dragma yes? I’m Lucius Malfoy, Draco’s father and now your barrister in Wizarding Britain. It’s a deep pleasure to meet the mothers of Draco’s closest friends, he speaks quite fondly of Hadrian and seems to be baffled and intrigued by your daughter.” Lucius extended his hand as Erin nodded and Sara grinned. Greeting both of them warmly.
One time she read to him from outside the door, put treacle tart on a plate and slid it through the locked door. Hadrian liked blondies,
The relief was like getting dumped with a bucket of ice water in the summer heat as Hadrian jotted down the answers swiftly and passed it to Laney who squinted and bit her lip.
Hilariously enough, the killing blow didn’t even come from Lucius, but rather Dowager Longbottom, Neville’s grandmother. She was wearing a lace trimmed dress with a large hat as was her usual appearance. She had a stern frown on her face with disproval heavy in her eyes, Hadrian suddenly remembered that Neville had grown up suspected to be a squib until nearly age ten. Draco grinned beside him.
“I don’t pay the mortgage, it’s already in my name. Just yearly taxes. I’ve been pulling overtime lately anyway so I have more than enough to take some time to get to spend some time with Draco’s family.”
“Perfect. Severus, send for the twins?” A flick of his wrist sent a brilliantly white doe sprinting across the study and past the closed door. Sara was biting her lip nervously and twiddling her thumbs until the door gently creaked open and Lucius studied the new occupants of the room carefully.
The dark-haired man gave a swift nod. He knew what it was like to worry, even if it might be nothing. Following gut feelings were very important and it wasn’t like it was difficult to check as long as the boy consented. “Have you talked to him about this?”
With that, James grabbed the dishes and disappeared into the kitchen whistling a soft tune as he left.
“I was hoping you’d know!” Sara laughed again. “He’s such a sweet boy, Laney’s a little devil. He really blossomed you know? When I met him he was this skinny and quiet, so quiet little boy. Bones that jutted out of his skin like they were trying to run away, bruises all over his face, and a glare that honestly unsettled me. I knew though, I knew that hurt people hurt others, usually not on purpose. So I pulled him into my fold, gave him a home, and watched him stitch himself back together. I never regret it. I love him so much.”
outing with his closest confidants and his husband had the man trudging out. Cracking his first smile when Hadrian decided to mimic his glamour with rich blond hair and bright brown eyes and mockingly sulk around the man. Draco and his mother was nearly in stitches, almost falling over when they apparated into Diagon Alley.
.” Draco thought it was a little unfortunate that Dragma (male Dragma? They would figure this out. Maybe middle names?) didn’t laugh again or continue talking with that deep rumbling voice. Alex seemed to stew angerly at the two basically ignoring his existence. Ron, a Weasley, stayed quiet and watched with confusion.
After a minute his Uncle covered his mouth. The dark eyes, usually so calm and even were red and misty as he kept glancing from the parchment up to the boy beside him. Hadrian cocked his head curiously onto his shoulder as even his own father looked at the finished stack of paper and went sheet white, looking at Hadrian with a new reverence reserved for very few people. Severus’ hand-dipped low enough that with a squint Draco could read the scrawl on the top.
Outcast at home, outcast at school. There's never been a break for him. Not for the Freak of the Dursley house, until unexpected people brings pasts to light and suddenly. It seems that he finds the chance he'd been waiting his l I f e for.
“Laney wanted to play and those two are attached at the hip so naturally Hadrian joined to be with his twin.” James’ smile fell, turning into a scowl.
“We can only avoid him for so long, why is he being so persistent? Didn’t he get the hint before we got sorted?”
“Making sure I’m not horrifying our new godfather, that my grades are fine. Oh, and that that little pleb isn’t bothering you too much.
Now she was still the same, but it was obvious to him that he’d scared her. More often than not when they walked Mother would have a hand on the back of his head, covering his old injury. Double checking the straps when he had to wear a leg brace and carrying him when he couldn’t walk anymore.
“Annabee is just plain smitten with her brother, he could say the sky was green and she’d adamantly defend him against anyone who tried to say it was blue.”
They were right, it was still him. His skin was still tanned, but now it seemed more natural and less like it was just Hadrian staying in the sunny restaurant all day. His hair had changed from a dark brown to a glossy black, the only flecks of color was the slight sheen of brown when the light hit his hair just right. His eyes were the most different part, they went from that vibrant green to a dark and endless blue like an ocean.
“HADRIAN!” The boy blinked tiredly and jumped when arms looked around him like a vice. Nearly struggling until the scent of brown sugar assaulted him like a brick to the face. Tears hot and burning welled up in his eyes as he desperately wrapped his own arms around her. Feeling her hands clawing nearly painfully at the back of his head and his back.
James frowned again, “Alex said he went up to greet Harry before the sorting ceremony and he got ignored all the way to when Harry was sorted into Slytherin rather than our family house. He was distraught that after five years the first thing his twin did was snub him.”
Laney withdrew her hands revealing a tiny calico kitten blinking cutely around the room. Hadrian frowned at his familiar as Suni gave the tiny creature a speculative eye. Draco snapped back to himself. He was eleven, he would not be jumping the bones of a boy he just met.
“Doesn’t need help with that. I taught him well. Someone tried grabbing Annabelle at a park. Homophobe that didn’t like that Sara was married to me. Hadrian sprinted after him and broke his arm. That time
I thought it only fair that if I posted a filler chapter, that I hurry up and bring the substance to the plot a little bit quicker than usual. I hope you all like this early update! :)
“Dining tables in the kitchen, gimme your coats.” His father almost abolished him for his rude abruptness, until their lord laughed. Long and deep, it rumbled in the air.
Four days of hard work. Bags were becoming purses of black under his eyes as he worked tirelessly into the night, before throwing a rug on top of the circle as soon as the sun broke the horizon. Then he’d suffer through James dragging him to breakfast where he’d sit silently and they’d all ignore the bruises and the fact Hadrian could barely walk without leaving a blood trail behind him from his leg. Lily shot her husband concerned looks, and Alex was wary, but reassured by his father easily enough. Enough that he had the audacity to tell Hadrian that the sooner he behaved and got ungrounded the sooner they could fly together and get homeschooled together.
“You have the adoption papers?” Sara handed over her file of copies. “Perfect, and what can you tell me about your professions?”
“Oh, I know you hate James Potter, Hadrian wrote me a letter nearly hysterically laughing about how much you hated the Potters. Said he saw it, James was a cruel git to my son growing up and Hadrian remembers
“This school year is going to be hell. That insufferable headmaster is still in charge even though he’s been bedridden. I want to stay here.” Hadrian nuzzled into his arms, making Draco sigh. The warm sun was kissing his skin comfortably as they sat on the beach’s bench.
“I wouldn’t blame you. It happens you know.” Hadrian could see the understanding and between the lines words in Draco’s eyes. The blonde mulled over the words, before he stepped closer to Hadrian.
“Be quick, Hadrian wait with your sister for your other sister. I’m in the room across if you need me. I’ll be right out once we drag your godfather out of his lab or his rooms. Then we’ll choose where we’re going hmm?” Mama gave him one last kiss and disappeared down the hall with Lucius.
“It’s our home Draco, you don’t need permission to bring guests over. Though, I am making dinner, so a headcount might be nice? I hope we have enough chairs…” Draco didn’t even try to stop himself from smiling like a loon. Our home. If he weren’t afraid of getting murdered by the Order the pure domesticity he was feeling might tear him apart. His Uncle Severus looked at him curiously and sharply as he hung up the phone.
“Oh do tell?” The Potters looked confused, only Lily and Albus were perceptive enough to look wary with their Slytherin banter.
“Stay still, I need to fix your tie.” Draco was in his space, long and thin pale fingers working at the tie around his neck. Basically sharing the same breath, but Hadrian didn’t want to pull away. It felt warm and comfortable.
Immediately those pink lips split into a grin and Hadrian was pressed into his side. Draco’s face burrowed into the crown of the smaller’s head. Squeezing him tight until he let go. An arm still wound around his beloved’s shoulders as Hadrian’s nimble fingers gently traced the small of his back, unseen to their guests. Draco could feel the blush on his cheeks as he introduced them.
“Lucius, Hadrian is selectively mute. Would his sister be allowed to be present? She often helps him get his message across and keeps him grounded.”
“I figured your guests might prefer it, seeing as the first time I made you tea from my home you sputtered like a nun at a strip club.” Draco was surprised to see him mother muffle a laugh at the raunchy joke, but the amusement was quick to fade. Uncle Severus was the first to speak.
Hadrian shot up and got to the other side of the room as James forced himself in. Alex grinning behind him and waving cheerily as if they hadn’t invaded his prison cell. Lily followed a bit more calmly and warily. She tried to smile calmly at him.
The red head glanced around and grinned like a lune when she saw no one, keeping the Cheshire grin locked on. She pointed her own wand at her face and shot herself with a stinging hex. It sent her wand flying and her directly to the ground with a thundering smack.
Harry could use his guidance in seemed, spending so much time away from home had changed him for the worst. The girl next to him, he would have to phase her out of his brother’s life and the Malfoy’s son. Malfoy had been a death eater, one of his inner circle, before Voldemort’s demise and so he was both arrogant and dangerous. Alex also couldn’t deny the curl of jealousy and anger that rose up when Malfoy stepped closer to his brother. Occupying the space that should be either his or Ron’s. The girl he didn’t know, but he did know that he didn’t like the way she was hanging on his brother. Holding hands and wrapped around his arm like an octopus. It was shameless and disgusting, especially when she whispered next to his jaw and hoarded his entire left side. She was probably a muggle born that was hoping to leech off his fame through his brother and that just would not do. Especially as Alex watched his brother lean closer to her when she spoke and roll his eyes playfully. Gifting her all of his attention.
Tom was looking at him with wild and confused red eyes. Zeroing in on the paper in his hands and Severus’ arms wrapped around his body, and he came closer. Barely breathing the man stared at him as if he were looking at him for the first time. Like he was something special. Tracing the shape of his eyes and the fall of his disheveled ponytail, murmuring softly.
He was supposed to be brought back home when he went to Hogwarts. Hogwarts was the safest place on earth, and keeping two preteens safe when they could listen and understand the things at stake as easier than trying to keep two children safe. James hadn’t been so optimistic. He just didn’t understand. Alex was his son. Harry was
“I never would, you may actually have to worry about him hurting me-ah!” Hadrian smacked Draco’s bicep with a pout that dissolved into a grin. “See! Abuse! I’m in danger Uncle Sev!”
“Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville has lost one.” Her nasally voice was the nails on the chalkboard. Making him bristle and any contentedness in his chest die quickly, both at the interruption and the high and loud tone of voice. Draco basically growled at her.
“Where’s your husband Severus?” The dark-haired man snorted and glanced at the clock. “Ah, well, I’ll wait a bit before starting breakfast then. How did you two sleep?”
“Mama!” The red-haired girl whined; Hadrian only gave a firm nod. His arm slung around his sister’s waist. “I swear, terrorize one elementary school and you’re called a trouble maker! Please! They were all amused and you know it!”
“He talks to her, Suni by the way. We decided if he had a gift that let him talk to snakes that he deserved to have the chance to let his gift flourish. It also helps him to have a confidant that isn’t one of us. Instant bodyguard too. He drapes her over his little sister and instantly she’s kidnap proof if he has to dart away for a minute.” Erin snorted.
“Bodies are fluid, so I tweak myself depending on my mood. Kinda like when I’m working out and I get rid of the dick to be more comfortable. As for me now… sort of effortless, my scars are ugly so I smooth them over. But everything else is
“Why didn’t I know you? Tom said you looked like us, but I didn’t think anything of it. But you’re my little prince. My Hadrian.” The brunet was pliant as Severus held him tight, knuckles blood white from how tight he was holding Draco’s mate. Hadrian glanced at the sheet, eyes widening when he saw the words on the top, slowly, Hadrian was able to uncurl from his Uncle. Not going too far, he stayed plastered to his uncle’s side as Hadrian looked at the sheet, grabbing the stapled pages.
It felt like chains had cracked and slipped off his shoulders. Leaving him raw and sore where the shackles had bit into him, but lighter than he’d ever been before. He felt free.
“The way my aunt and uncle sometimes spoke I think they were. I don’t know for sure though. My mentor let me have her last name when I moved here, it helped keep social services off our back. But, it also means I don’t even know where I’d start looking.”
Draco had gotten on the train interested to find the boy who lived, but he found himself rather satisfied with what he’d found instead. His mother and father would hardly care either way as long as he made nice wizarding friends that had a shred of a decent head on their shoulders. Hadrian’s head leaned back slowly, craning to look at him. Those eyes pinned him down, and even though Draco knew he wasn’t another empath it felt like the other boy was baring out his soul. It was a slightly thrilling feeling.
Snape rolled his eyes, “Basil is hatred. The original meaning was, before it became love. However I favor sticking to what flowers meant before people tried to beautify their meanings with false pleasantry.”
When Hadrian explained what his goal was Laney was immediately on his side. A mad grin on her lips. Draco was resolute as well, Greg and Vince were basically Laney’s whipping boys rather than Draco’s vassals anymore so they were obviously not going to object. He’d let Lucius destroy the Potter’s legally.
Odd, but boys were reckless, and if he were Harry Potter… Harry Potter. Why hadn’t Hadrian recognized them in his home? Severus had been his professor for years, Voldemort had even seen the boy during Albus’ set up in the Tri-Wizard Tournament. Harry Potter. Oh god, Tom had almost killed his baby. That’s why Harry had lived. The Boy-Who-Lived. Magic was more than intent, it would know if he were unsound. Even under compulsion upon compulsion and induced madness, his magic knew he’d never hurt his blood. His magic had probably recognized Hadrian and had backfired to prevent him from killing his son. Thank Merlin.
“Wait here alright?” Hadrian nodded easily, Annabee waved from his arm’s happily and Laney gave them a grin. There was a large skip in her step as she practically danced to the bathroom, Hadrian chuckling and watching her antics as Lords and Ladies alike exited the hall leaving it mostly empty as he waited.
“Come out on the balcony with me.” Hadrian didn’t fight or question it as he let Draco pull him up from the vanity and lead him to their small master patio. Hadrian’s herbs swayed softly in the brisk night wind, still blooming in the beginning spring. The stars shone brilliantly above them, making Hadrian smile with tired eyes. He’d never get sick of this view.
Draco was sitting across from her, being the one to hold her baby sister. He was like her, quietly distraught as he tried his best to soothe the five year old. Dodging floundering limbs with impressive grace and pressing Annabee’s face to snuffle into his robes pathetically. Vince and Greg were on either side of her, caging her in and keeping her propped up when she felt like a marionette with no strings. Suni laid on her lap limply, sulking with her eyes closed in despair at the loss of her speaker. Laney didn’t know what she was thinking, and she couldn’t ask how to make her feel better.
“Play nice Leandra.” The girl looked at him with utter betrayal, as if he’d just insulted her entire family. It was a rather funny expression to see on a child before she pouted and slouched into her brother, looking up at his through her hair.
“I’m afraid it’s unplottable. I can’t help you or the Auror’s Severus. Just trust I will do what is right for the Greater Good.”
“We’ll take care of it. It’s all a misunderstanding that can be cleared up nice and quick.” Sirius felt ill listening to them plot and plan against his innocent godson. The child who did nothing wrong, at least, nothing bad enough to warrant the abuse and the
“Anything else we should know about sweetheart?” Hadrian took a sip of his coffee, before letting a hand wander down to slip into Draco’s back pocket cheekily. Giving his parent’s a sly wink while Draco simultaneously wanted to grin like a loon and crawl into a hole and die before his fiancé’s parents murdered him and hid the body.
“Good, how’s school going?” The raven was still blinking back into focus, but he gave a thumbs up. Laney snorting beside him.
First, he gently sawed off a chunk from the ends of his hair and fashioned it into a decent brush head. Using his ponytail, his hair hung limply down and around his head as he hyper focused on wrapping it around his broken wand and the tip of his new brush. Useless for magic, but perfect for painting precious lines.
Sirius had been important to the arrest and the trial, damning Albus with a closed confession of what went down that night and nailed the old man with compliancy to child neglect, abuse, and attempted murder. He would die in Azkaban and Severus had taken his place as Headmaster. McGonagall was seen as too entrenched in Albus’ ideas to be suitable. Lily Potter escaped charges, but with the fall of Albus, the ‘Boy Who Lived’ worship fell. Criticism and hate came from all sides to a mother who abandoned her child and ignored abuse. Alex was let off as he was only a child.
He was wary of course, but he also didn’t think his effortless looking more like his fathers would be so bad. Hadrian relaxed his shoulders and let out a sigh, raising the vial in a small toast, though he didn’t know what to. Having a family again? Finding his birth heritage? Reclaiming what he’d lost?
It almost looked like Alex’s room, or what little he saw of it that one time he snuck out of the attic.
The courtroom was already packed with the Lords and Ladies as they shuffled their way to the defendants area. Hadrian bit the inside of his cheek, glancing either way, paling a bit when he caught sight of the Headmaster.
He looked so different too. Her eyes on a face she didn’t recognize. So tall as well, he’d be taller than his father if he continued growing. With long limbs and creamy pale skin, long dark hair and eyes that weren’t hidden by glasses. So cold. He looked at her as if she were a disliked stranger.
“Think nothing of it. I’ll get your rooms ready. Draco, let’s leave them to relax for a moment. You’re going to be helping me.” Draco went to protest, but Hadrian only had to glance at him with a single brow raised before Draco was standing up. Abandoning his plate.
“We need to get a picture for the moms. Mama would lose her god damn mind. This is just her aesthetic.”
Though, as a Veela, Draco only had one mate for the rest of his life. It made sense that he was unafraid of commitment, especially with someone he already felt attached too. Severus smiled into his coffee. The adoring looked Hadrian kept sending at Draco made his feel reassured that his godson was in good hands. Lucius leaned forward.
Another smaller chapter, but if it makes you feel better! The next chapter was so big that I had to split it into two separate chapters lol! So you're in for a treat once I upload that!
, when Alex couldn’t even get a bloody wave. Cooing with a disgustingly sweet and devoted tone that didn’t match the apathetic boy he’d seen Harry twisted into.
Laney’s jaw was hanging out of her head as she stared, openly gawking before shutting her mouth and grabbing onto the side of his robes. Easily, he threw an arm over her shoulder. He’d gained a decent amount of height when he joined his real family. When a tap on his shoulder had him breaking his reverence to glance behind him. Breath freezing like ice in his throat.
the man smiled into the kiss before pulling away. Draco grabbed his hand. Kissing each knuckle before slipping the ring onto Hadrian’s ring finger, letting the small thrill, the ember, that lit up in his chest burn as he got to admire the ring on his hand. He grinned up at his groom, grabbing the front of the man’s shirt and shoving him back inside and onto the bed. Wandlessly and wordlessly throwing up a silencing charm and straddling his future husband with a wicked grin.
Severus, Sirius, and a man named Remus were also here, arguing at the grill and taking turns working on dinner. Tippy popping in and out to assist them and sending him glances as if to make certain he were still there. Tippy was familiar and deeply loved by him. Remus and Sirius were too, though he’d only met the last two recently. Sirius it turned out was his godfather from the Potters, and when they abandoned him; he rejected the Potters and disappeared with his husband Remus to France. He was also the man that arrested Albus and killed James to protect his honor and his life in a duel supposedly. Though, Sirius refused to say what it was that had set him off so badly and never told him anything about it. Never said anything about why Sirius had seen fit to kill James rather than let him live. Only that it was in Hadrian’s best interest.
“God, I gotta work on pronouncing half of this. First one’s drought of living death? Draught? Second one is the stomach of a goat, that was the bezoar question. Third is nothing, both are aconite.” Snape pinched the bridge of his nose and summoned the sheet of parchment from her hands. Glancing it over and nodding firmly.
Severus’ letter had come as a surprise to him. Meeting with him through the floo had been a meeting with an equal amount of surprise. A meeting that had filled him with equal parts hope and outrage. Hearing that James had lost custody and proceeding then to simply take it, it had infuriated him. When he’d tried and failed to gain custody as James abandoned his beloved little godson Harry. Harry-Hadrian who was no longer just a child.
“Now, I heard from your mothers’ that you were in therapy. Obviously, that is not offered here at Hogwarts. Can I inquire as to how you are doing?” Laney obviously looked at him, one of the few questions she couldn’t answer for him. Hadrian straightened his shoulders a bit.
“Yes, after my twelfth birthday. Amazing we’re seventeen now love. So, over five years?” Draco smiled indulgently.
His husband shook his head slowly, watching carefully as Severus pulled thin and callused fingers against his pulse point. “It’s the artery that leads to the brain, a laceration the scroll described would have killed him in minutes. That’s why he was magically exhausted that year, his magic was the only thing that kept him alive. We could have lost our son Tom! And we would have no idea what we’d lost.”
“I’m from Britain and I’m probably English by blood. But my home culture is from a small desert island named Dicai. Blistering sun and spice is our life, though I grew up here and only have been to the homeland a few times, my mentor made sure I was taught all our traditions and immersed in the culture from the second she took me in.” Hadrian paused. “You don’t have to hide your wands or magic by the way. I know and I am.”
“No. He hasn’t spoken to me since we sent Harry to his relatives. He’s in France with Moony, I don’t even know their address to send him a letter. There’s also the chance he’d be pissed at me enough to grab Harry and run. As the legal and blood-adopted godfather we gave him, he would be harder to fight than the lesbians.”
“Don’t worry about it Lane. They’ll drop off all our luggage, pets included at our dorms once we’re sorted. Unless you have an owl, then they go to the Hogwart’s owlery.” Laney nodded happily, ignoring Draco’s small squawk as she grabbed his hand to hold as they walked. Harry sniggering near silently at the confused expression on Draco’s face.
“Don’t be sorry, I was being careless. That was my fault, but I’ve seen enough for right now.” With a blink, he was back in reality. Hadrian didn’t even bat an eye, taking a sip of coffee as if he weren’t mentally violated just seconds ago.
“Don’t we have to get sorted now? Oh! They’re calling names! Boys let’s roll!” Leaning out of her brother’s arms, neither boy had time to react as Laney grabbed Hadrian and Draco by their robes and shoved them forward merrily. A skip in her step as she separated her brother and friends from the massive prick. “Vincent! Gregory! Let’s go boys, we’re holding up the line!”
“Of course! Come on in, my name’s Laney! This is my brother, we’re both first years. What’s your name?” The three boys looked thrown off in the face that was Laney Dragma, but the blonde was the first to relax. Giving a brilliant smirk that caught Hadrian’s eye.
, said he would work on brewing a memory potion immediately. Though it wasn’t likely to work on Hadrian, it was fine. He didn’t want to remember school if he was the Potter that Draco had whined about and cursed constantly. His fathers were desperate to remember though.
“That would make a scene! I almost want to see that. But I rather like you two, so I think sticking with me would be in both of our best interests. I’ll teach you how to mix with the right sort. Are you… muggle-raised?” Draco said it with a slight grimace, but Hadrian appreciated the effort. A lot of pureblood families like the Malfoy’s had strict beliefs that would take time to break down. Laney spoke first.
Green eyes shot open, blue skies were replaced with the smooth ivory ceiling of their dorm room. The covers were heavier than normal on his, which made sense when he felt a snoot nudging at his jaw from under the duvet. Hadrian let a hand reach up to massage Suni’s head, eyes still locked onto the seeing. Mind running and not really comprehending that real life existed for a moment.
“I want to go home.” Lily flinched at the cold and quiet words. James glowering at him from behind his wife and Alex looked crestfallen and upset. Looking up at his father for comfort and guidance when Hadrian glared at him more harshly. Rebuffing any attempt Alex would have made to get closer to him. Evidently, Alex remembered getting his ass handed to him and kept quiet when Hadrian drew his wand.
“I thought I was going to say screw it and get expelled before I was even sorted when they prick started talking to us and trying to steal my brother. If he tries anything I’m severing off his limbs and beating him to death with his still bleeding arms.” Violent, the three pure bloods turned pale at the grotesque threat, but it seemed Potter- Dragma, the male Dragma, was unimpressed. Or rather unaffected.
Feeling marginally better about the door (even if he knew it wasn’t actually secure) he took stock. His head was foggy, but there was no damage. Even his leg felt fine. That was good, next. Hadrian searched the room. Parchment, quills and ink in the desk. Useful. Various posters of Quidditch teams he’d never heard of or his brother’s useless books, which he’d never read. Not useful. A rug, warm at least, if James took away his sheets. Bed that was crimson and mussed up from his wake up call. Window, but he was high up in the Manor, he’d break his legs. Crawling was a last resort, but not one he was above using if he had to. His closet held clothes of differing sizes and varying amounts of use. Thrift stores? Hadrian grimaced as he amended the statement. Hand me downs from his brother.
Narcissa whistled low and smiled. “He’s as pussy whipped as you were when you and I started courting.” Lucius smiled weakly. Until his Lord also smiled, the look was distant and far away.
Stuffing the letter in his robes. Severus escaped down to the dungeons, whistling to call his post raven down to his chambers he sat down at his desk and grabbed a quill and parchment as swiftly as he could.
“Ah, Miss Dragma. This is Mr. and Mrs. Potter, and I’m sure you’ve met Alex.” Laney flicked her hair over her shoulder when Alex reached out a hand to shake.
Hadrian cocked his head. “I don’t believe I know what that is, but it sounds like a decent idea. I called my mentor last night and took this week off in case you all needed me. Let’s say I had a feeling when you called me last night. So, my schedule is free.”
Still, nothing, even sweet memories could compare to the soft humming that was coming from the kitchen. Voldemort looked wary, hand at his wand with Severus also at the ready. Nagini curled around both her masters’ feet. Draco stepped forward, letting his school bag drop to the floor noisily.
“There’s memory loss. There isn’t a doubt about that, if it was due to any tampering either you or they covered any trace of it very well. Was your last blackout your school year?” A nod. “Then seeing as you’re out of school, I wouldn’t worry too much. If you have another blackout, let me know as soon as possible. As well as give me any people who might have been around you.”
Hadrian grinned at his Dad, “Now, since we have this all sorted out. How about you and Narcissa help me with wedding plans for after you all win that stupid British war against the old man? We have a lot of work if we’re going to win a war and pull off a marriage in a timely fashion!”
“It’s common knowledge how much the Potter’s value family and their children. The Potter’s quite obviously love their son, and they love Harry just as much. Any actions made were regrettable, but it was all to protect what they thought was a squib sibling from dark wizards that targeted the family. If you believe in the love of family, you’ll return young Harry to his parent’s loving arms and let him learn to regain his place in his rightful family.” As Albus sat down, Lucius smoothly got to his feet. Hair neatly pulled back.
Lily watched with a deep bitterness as what used to be her quiet and most withdrawn son blossomed under her eyes. Butting his head against that woman’s daughter affectionately moments after he’d rejected his own blood brother.
The box fell open, revealing the shimmering platinum band with small diamond crusting and the ruby that was traditional for Dician weddings. It was in that second, Hadrian knew he’d been blessed. This caring, sweet man that was looking at him like he was the reason the world turned. Hadrian grinned.
The brunet was dragged by his ear by an irate and infuriated potions professor as Draco hurried over to his sister. Holding her wand which no one bothered to check, the sparkle in her eyes was full force. Yes, a beautiful job well done. Laney put her thumbs up for him to see from the library and whooped with glee when Greg piggy backed her to the infirmary. A month and a half until the court day left.
“I had a dream that we had a son once. He had Severus’ hair, and my eyes, the color before I was devoted to the dark arts. I don’t remember his name, but it had felt so real. I could vividly see him playing with Nagini on the floor with a stuffed dragon that had a handkerchief. I almost thought it was real when I’d woken. I think…. If we ever did have a son. I think he’d look a bit like young Hadrian does.” Severus squeezed his bicep, ignoring the twinge that screamed in the back of his head.
Still, he limped to the window and peeked out. Heart dropping into his stomach, swirling with ice cold nausea. Outside was two familiar figures on brooms flying around the Quidditch pitch. Large hoops loomed on either side bearing large banners with the Gryffindor crest displayed proudly besides the Potter family crest.
“What do you want?” Snape rolled over the thoughts in his head. Seems the mildly terrifying anger was on both sides. Good to know. Lily looked cowed however, holding a sulking Potter clone in her arms tight as James frowned deeply.
The ex-Potter started slow, it didn’t matter what you did it mattered how you were seen after all. Laney was seen as a holy terror with good intentions. He was the quiet scope of control and grace. Forever he would be the good quiet kid.
“Yeah! Dad told me you were coming home for Christmas. You won’t have to go back to those women’s house, you’ll get to come home again! Dad was saying that your adoption wasn’t real so we got custody of you again!”
Alexander lit up as Hadrian’s gaze slid over to him. “Harry! Why have you been sitting with the snakes, come on. You should be with me don’t you think? We should be catching up, I haven’t seen you in years. Please?” Draco snorted.
He tugged on Hadrian’s ponytail softly, lips pressed to his beloved’s crown. Who knew he would find his Veela mate so early in life and fall so deeply in love with him before even the bond kicked in. Draco’s fingers twitched, it was nearing the end of summer and he hadn’t even gotten to introduce his parents to Hadrian.
Mooney was a quiet and kind man who was working with Severus to make sure Hadrian stayed up to speed with his schoolwork. The two men were ruthless of making sure Hadrian went above and beyond on his studies, until Padfoot interrupted to ‘save Hadrian’s brain from the book worms’. Watching the three bicker brought Hadrian a special joy and he rejoiced when Mama and Narcissa locked them in a closet together and they came out blushing and holding hands. All three of them.
“Don’t worry about it Hadrian, not like these guys are big talkers either and at least you got the intelligence and competence to pull it off. I’m more surprised no one’s ears are bleeding from that harpy. She could have at least knocked. It’s only polite.” Draco checked the scenery and looked into the hallway.
“Harry was attached! I didn’t want Suni to get sick from wild rodents, he would have been heart-broken! Then you know Laney would have been upset and Annabee would have a downright melt down that her brother was sad.”
“It’s not that rare.” His voice was smooth and level, the blonde blinked quickly, staring intently as Hadrian leaned his head back. Stretching his shoulder’s back elegantly and confidently as Mother taught him commanded attention and consideration. “My biological family were all Gryffindors. I’m certain my ex-brother will be vying to go to their family house. The Weasleys are another traditionally Gryffindor house hold, like the Lovegoods are traditionally Ravenclaw. Many old wizarding families in Britain have family expectations.”
“You’re so fucking beautiful, never talk about yourself like that again.” Hadrian finally cracked a smile, Draco could feel it hovering just under his bottom lip as Hadrian looked at them with those mesmerizing eyes. The scars, the emotions, the strength Hadrian had for enduring them; they were all Hadrian’s and it was all beautiful to him.
“I’m sure he didn’t mean that. I’m Lily, Alex said that your name is Laney correct?” The curly red head just glared at the older woman quietly, obviously still peeved and unwilling to engage. She shifted her attention to her ex-son before a kind smile blossomed on her face.
Apparently, Laney had not stolen a sink. But she had gotten away with taking a faucet by Halloween. Uncaught by everyone except the Weasley twins, who were in the midst of stealing a toilet seat.
“I’m aware. I’m here to take both of you in. You’re wanted for kidnapping, disregarding a restraining order, and quite a few other things. Does Lily know truly what you’ve done? Or have you just pacified her with Dumbledore’s greater good argument?” James snarled at him and Sirius just looked his fill. Before James started flinging spells at him.
“Oh! The Italian!” Lucius smiled indulgently as they recollected themselves, Hadrian looked a great deal calmer, legs down on the floor again. The red head had splayed herself practically across the sofa in the patent ‘take up as much room as possible’ way of sitting. One of her legs hooked over her brothers lap.
Instantly, she knew he was gone or injured. Annabee would never be alone and crying like that if he were able to get to her. Most of her childhood was lazing on the couch or a park bench as Hadrian kissed Annabee’s boo boos or soothed her to sleep or fed her a bottle. Hadrian never let Annabee cry for longer than a minute if it wasn’t a temper tantrum or misbehaving. And no injury, especially a bleeding one, went unaddressed for longer than it took for her raven haired brother to get his hands on the toddler.
“He was dark! That scar on his forehead? A sign that the Dark Lord put a horocrux in him! A piece of his soul! As long as Harry is alive, You-Know-Who can come back again and again and Alex will never be safe. Is one boy’s life really worth the entirety of Britain?” James looked so pathetic suddenly, at his mercy. At wand point. So unlike the loyal boy he once knew and unlike his beautiful, beautiful godson. Who was so strong. Who suffered under this man’s hand.
Hadrian felt a similar grin tug at his lips to read HAYDEN in bright pink crayon on an attached letter. Handing off their mother’s letter to Laney he decided to read his baby sister’s  letter first.
He bounced Annabee in his arms as he wondered what restaurant his mothers were going to choose to celebrate; he hoped it was going to be a sushi place. Honestly, there was nothing more he loved than a spicy tuna roll and Suni was always happy as a clam when he brought home some smoked salmon for her to munch on. His spoiled little girl. She was probably lazing around in the Malfoy’s sunroom, she was going to adore the self-heating basking spot he got her for Christmas (now Yule). If Marissa didn’t harass her too much to share in the warmth.
.” They hesitated, especially Hadrian, but Draco the more tactful of the bunch grabbed both his friends and dragged them away. Visibly down the stairs as if to prove they weren’t eavesdropping.
Snape hid his slight surprise when the Potter spawn replied with a bland voice. “Many, and I believe Mama and Mother will beat you to it. Mother has been fed up with them since my adoption.” His godson hopped in the conversation. Snape eyed the way the blonde’s hands curled around the long-haired boy’s bicep. It wasn’t the worst Potter twin it seemed, but Snape was still displeased. Though, this wasn’t the conversation he’d been expecting, or where he was expecting to have it. Draco growled his input.
"Are you okay? I’m sorry you had to see that.” This boy, was more worried about him witnessing his memories of abuse then he was about being forced to remember what was probably a traumatizing time in his life. Severus grabbed the teen’s forearm, firmly but not aggressively.
Hadrian was shaking back in the back, not as bad as he could of, he had trained restraint and silence in the whirl of hectic emotions. That didn’t mean that he was unaffected internally as his mind spun.
“You must call me Sara then! I’m very thankful to Severus for suggesting we meet and more thankful to you for coming. My own son has only glowing reviews about your son, and my daughter is no doubt terrorizing him. I apologize for that.”
Hadrian blinked as Draco tapped his cheek. “Eyes up. You look sharp. Your mothers are the kindest people to exist that I’m not even sure their real. Severus is on our side and respected as a no-nonsense man who’s rescued countless Slytherin’s from abusive home. Laney’s a good holy terror and attached to you like an STD. And my father’s the best lawyer that exists in this country and everything is going to be alright. Don’t you trust me?”
held the boy tight. He looked at his own father and got a nod from him. Immediately Draco set off to fetch his mother and their lord.
All those lonely nights, bleeding, starving and locked in a cabinet because they were ‘his only living relatives’. All the scars on his face, on his back, the hatred that they had instilled in him so much so that he hated how he looked without morphing in the mirror. Running for his life when he was nine and losing the careless childhood he could have had.
The blond was leaning against the tree with him. Their hands were intertwined and those grey eyes covered with some of the most uppity muggle sunglasses Hadrian had ever seen. Suni was splayed across his lap, her golden scales creating a contrast to the other boy’s porcelain skin. Hadrian glanced at the couples and groups around the garden and back to Draco’s hand, twisted so firmly in his own.
“Hello Harry, how’d you sleep?” He didn’t speak. Only glaring at her. His chest was wound like a spring. Lungs held in a dizzying vice grip that left him light headed and impossible to speak clearly. “Are you ready for breakfast?”
Photographs of all their friends and the five years (summers and one holiday technically) they’d spent together. Hadrian’s paintings hung on the wall, with little knick-knacks they’d collects strewn on shelves. The blanket Draco had given Hadrian for Christmas when they were thirteen laid on the living room couch.
Tom gave a smile and leaned into Severus, Draco pressed a kiss onto Hadrian’s temple as the oven dinged.
The other boy seemed to falter when he caught sight of his biological twin, before he waved and made a motion for Hadrian to come closer. A small grin on his face and a light in his eyes that spoke of glee. Hadrian for his part gave a slow blink before turning his back to their other boy, face smooth and blank as glass.
Hadrian sighed softly as Draco’s arms wrapped around his waist and joined in his sister arguing about what and ever with the two vassals. The raven hadn’t the energy to try and even understand what Laney was trying to convince them of this time, so he just relaxed and focused on meditating until finally breakfast was finished and Professor Snape came to collect them both, Laney pouting about delaying he first day off with her kitten and new friends while Hadrian tried to float in his happy mental place.
They won the courts, they won’t get away with this. He just had to be patient. Patient. Patient. Patient.
“Well Sara, Erin. You’ve raised a well mannered and charming young man. He is visibly quite happy with you in your home, and well taken care of in it. Safe to say if legal action is attempted, we can be swift and thorough in shutting it down. That said, please do keep in touch. My wife and I would be happy to invite you to dinner, and Draco is already bugging me to invite you over to visit during the Yule break.” Sara took his hand firmly and gave a massive grin.
Hadrian hadn’t been kidding when he said he was going to use the end of school to spruce up the place.
“Nothing you wanna know about Papa. I assure you.” Severus looked appalled but the Lord was ducking behind his husband where Draco could hear him snorting with quiet laughter, shoulder’s shaking as he tried to cover it with a cough. Severus glared at him.
“Snakes stick together, united front and all that jazz. Besides. I prefer you already. I can feel the entitlement from here.”
It should have startled him when Hadrian barely even batted an eye at stabbing his own palm and bleeding into a quill. Until he remembered that as a declared dark wizard in his culture blood rituals were very common and socially acceptable, and that his beloved looked to cook and prep things with knives. As soon as the quill was full, Hadrian’s hand-stitched itself together and the two older men snatched up the parchment to inspect as the quill flew like a mad man down many pages. Starting with a new sheet when it ran out of room. Draco quirked a brow and Hadrian tugged his hand quizzically.
Laney grinned dopily between Crabbe and Goyle a few steps ahead of them, “A true edge-lord. I am so down. Tea!”
“What’s your middle name. Both of you.” Hadrian looked vaguely curious and Leandra looked startled. Draco just smirked.
“She likes skin contact. It was an experience to wake up the first time with a boa slithering up my pants and into my shirt whining that she was cold.”
“Assuming you mean Potter.” Laney flicked a strand of hair over her shoulder as an answer. Snape allowed that to be his answer as he sighed softly. “Regardless, the snake pit has a few more members than expected and we’re short a bed until I can get another one. Any ideas on what you’d like to be done for the night?”
“C’mon, let’s’ go back down. You promised desert.” Hadrian laughed and they went downstairs and host their guests. Draco was pleased with their desert and for a small while, the war didn’t weigh so heavily on the families.
It felt like an eternity, but it was really only a few minutes when Draco saw his love turn from the stove. Six mismatched mugs balanced on a tray with a small jug of milk and mason jar of sugar. Draco didn’t even blink when Hadrian plopped his favorite mug onto his placemat, tea already a dark milky color, evidently, Hadrian had made his tea for him. He took a sip and was a little surprised.
“Imagine having such an ego that you take a losing case to court under the delusion you win and you muck it up so badly that you’ll be lucky to say a Most Noble House by the end of the PR nightmare that was just unearthed?” Laney gave him a confused look. “I’ll explain why later, it’ll help you understand why Sev is such a big deal to all of us here and why the Potters are going to lynched in the newspapers.”
“Is this seat open? Or should I leave?” He was confident, but who wouldn’t be with the two bulky shadows who stood guard behind him like bulldogs. Laney grinned and waved him in, definitely Mama’s daughter as she welcomed them with open arms, letting go of Harry’s hand to help them settle in.
.” Sara smirked. “Besides, I wonder who would also win this fight if it’s all about money. I own my own business and Erin here is extremely affluential in an international military task-force. You are the equivalent of a stay at home wife and a police officer. Noble, but not very lucrative, all your money was made by your ancestors. We’re self-sufficient and though we have a lower net-worth than you, we didn’t see fit to
Albus was quick to try and do some damage control. “Now, we weren’t insinuating anything like that-“ Erin glared at him and Sara grinned.
The morning rose softly, Hadrian’s eyes blinking as the glow pried his eyes open. Draco’s blond head was burrowed into his hair and his arms were squashing Hadrian’s face into his neck. The raven haired man laughed softly, kissing a hickey on Draco’s neck before rolling out of his grasp. Hissing a good morning to Nagini and wandering downstairs to start the coffee maker.
He looked both different and exactly as Alex had pictured. His eyes were Mom’s shade of green, but everything else was all Dad. With fair, but not pale skin and lean, sharp limbs. A seeker’s build, or chaser. Alex didn’t expect the lack of glasses however, in every picture Harry had been a quiet frown with wide green eyes, hidden by glasses and unruly black hair. Harry now however had no glasses, his eyes were big and long, framed neatly with bangs and hair pressed into a long ponytail that made him look kinda girly. Alex would have to convince him to maybe trim the hair, or at least wear it differently.
. The sharp pieces of his broken wand parting his flesh easily as it had his hair, as if it were a hot knife through butter. Blood was flowing easily, but not overflowing as to drip and ruin the circle. He looked out his window. Night was still young. He got to work. Jabbing the homemade brush into his arm and careful drawing the symbols.
Draco wishes the summer had stayed forever. His body ached from running, his mother and father were on either side of him. Their lord and his Uncle Severus were running close behind, shouting defensive spells and shields until they were able to get out of the Hogwarts wards to apparate with a loud crack.
“I spent months ruining Alex, fully prepared to target James next. And he did it for me. I’m almost disappointed.” Laney grinned and Draco wrapped an arm around his waist with an conspiratorial grin.
“Mama, it’s expensive. But, I’m going to need so much more therapy.” Mama laughed with him loud and unhinged, gulping in breaths between laughs and sobs with him and rocking him in her arms and her lap. Kissing every strand of hair on his head and every piece of exposed flesh. Careful not to touch his profusely bleeding leg.
Draco was sitting beside him as Laney sat across from him. Crabbe and Goyle sandwiching her protectively. The lunch table was crowded, pressing the blonde tight against his side in a way that made Hadrian hold back a blush as he enjoyed the warmth. The blonde was chewing slowly as his eyes wandered speculatively across the hall.
“Your Metamorphagus traits will have stopped most physical changes, but you might notice a slight difference in your bone structure, eye color, and or skin tone. Maybe even hair color. This is to both clear any lasting compulsions, and possibly some of the memory charms and potions, and void out the blood adoption so that we can keep custody of you, should Wizarding Britain not recognize your foreign magical guardian. The last thing either of us want is you caught back into this war too. You had no place in it, you have no obligation to try and clean up the mess that Dumbledore caused.” Hadrian looked up at them, his parents.
Godparents in wizarding society were as good as third or fourth parents to a child. They held nearly all the same parental rights to any child under their care. It was the reason their mothers were pleased that Severus took all three of them as his godchildren, it meant in the event of their passing Severus was next in line by the eyes of Magic. And Magic wasn’t to be trifled with in the matters of children. The fact that the Potters had denied visitation and custody to someone who
The next morning when Severus stumbled out of their bedroom, he was caught by Draco before he could even ask their host for the location of the nearest coffee shop. He glared at his godson grumpily who just rolled his eyes.
James gave him a dark look, hauling up the trunk stuffed with all the parchment, quills and ink in the room. Leaving no books or utensils behind. “Perhaps if you have time to do nothing but reflect. You’ll realize how good you have it by even being welcomed back into this house.”
“You may be my godson, but that is my little boy and I will poison you in your sleep if you hurt him. Are we understood.” Draco relaxed, smiling down at his fiancé.
He tried to use that time to nap a bit as he’d stay in his room, James too busy with Alex to remember that Hadrian wasn’t there to eat dinner or lunch. Lily often drifted towards his room, holding one of her books and asking if he’d like to read with her.
“Can I pet Suni?” Hadrian gave him a gentle smile and sat still as Draco hopped on the bed with him and reached out. Hand hovering in front of the large snake patiently letting her scent him before going to gently run his hand down her long body. “She’s gorgeous.”
Draco looked satisfied and his companions were too busy with treats from their bags to care for the conversation. “So, not twins because your adopted with different birth parents. How close in age are you to be the same year?” Laney giggled as Hadrian slumped onto her head, his boney chin digging into her crown.
“I’m Hadrian Dragma-Potter. Minstery wouldn’t let me drop my birth name until I can legally drop my heir title.” Draco’s jaw dropped.
“Alex is doing wonderfully, the Weasley boys and him have been thick as thieves, the loud and rambunctious lot they are.” Snape figured this was his turn now as he kept a vigil on the two mothers’ side.
Was gonna wait to post! But I got too excited. I'm going to try and wait a few days between updates, but what harm can one early update really do?
In the end, there was little she could’ve done, besides what she was doing now. Getting her son his twin brother back.
“That’s an understatement. We started with wanting a heritage test for me to see my bloodline and we ended up uncovering that I’m both the Boy-Who-Lived, stupid name, was mind raped and manipulated by an old creep, and taken from two loving fathers who were alive and grieving unaware while I was being beaten and starved. It’s… been a day.” Hadrian hadn’t meant to sound so bitter, but the soft smile Draco gave him soothed any worry he had. Letting his lover give him a chaste and soft kiss. Rubbing his shoulders over the loose tank top that Hadrian slept in.
“Blackouts, I go to a boarding school, but I never remember going or coming home. It’s like I don’t exist for nine months, I fall asleep on August 31
Unbidden, Hadrian felt a deep longing for the massive mint green sweater in his real trunk. It was XXL, with cotton that was beginning to pill, and a cute pig face stitched into the corner. He’d had it for as long as he could remember knowing Laney. She’d give it to him the first day she’d found him shivering on a curbside, trying to keep him warm. Annabee also loved the sweatshirt, always crawling into the folds whether he was in the shirt or not. His little clingy honeybee and his chaotic twin. Suni usually dozed in the front hanging pocket, as much as she could anymore now that she wasn’t a one foot baby anymore.
Severus still dug around, finding nothing incriminating anywhere in the office. Or any papers unrelated to school and students except a single letter from the French Aurors that made him pause. There was only one man in France aside from the congress that Albus would attempt to speak with after the trial. Digging his hands into the envelope he wrenched the letter apart desperately.
, home safe and sound with more school supplies and completed homework from the year before. I brushed it off, but Draco’s worried that I can’t even remember the name of the school. The only thing I know is that I’m forced into one morph the whole time and it makes my skin burn.” Severus blinked, studying him carefully. Blackouts were one thing but losing a specific portion of time every year was odd.
“The Potters are friends with the Weasley’s. A family who are widely considered blood traitors with no inheritance to speak of and one average income from the father. With
stood above them all, and easy smile and strong lean arms. Laney batted her eyes back and forth between the two of them.
“Oh.” Hadrian opened his mouth, but it almost looked as if he choked on air before he clamped his mouth shut and drew his legs up to his chest. One hand beginning to tug anxiously at his ponytail and his gaze settled just over Lucius’ shoulder, glassy and unfocused.
“Obviously, we’re friends with Draco, Vince, and Greg. I would say we get along with pretty much everyone else. I don’t have beef with anyone in particular and Hadrian’s way too chill to really piss anyone off. As for our muggle school, not really? We had friends, but they were more school friends? Like, you hang out at school, but nowhere else? Hadrian has always been my first and best friend, more so after we adopted him.”
“Stop manipulating your brother Anna, we both know you have him wrapped around your finger.” Her cold eyes glanced toward the family sitting next to her kids and Hadrian felt the temperature in the room plummet at least fifty degrees. Immediately she and her wife were firmly planted between their kids and the other family. Sara was the first to speak, and even she’d lost her care free smile.
“Annabee, been a good girl for Mama and Mother baby girl? Have you? Have you!” The girl squealed happily. Grinning when her brother nuzzled her cheek, soaking up his attention and love as their Mama and Mother walked in closer, stopping to stand beside Snape.
“Couldn’t your godson ever do things by halves? He couldn’t just have a wizard as his mate, he needed a Metamorphagus Parseltongue. Had to go big or go home.” His Lord looked younger without Dumbledore’s forced grotesque glamour on him. Soft and spiked brown hair and warm tanned skin, the only thing unnatural about him was the blood-red eyes. He mocked disapproval, but there was a bemused tilt to his lips. Sipping tea and sitting down at the kitchen table so calmly. Draco almost could pretend there wasn’t a war. That this was just his family meeting his partner.
Crammed under a bed, with hot tears beginning to stream down his cheeks. He never wanted his mother more than that moment now.
Potter Manor stood proudly just as it always had when Sirius was younger. The wards curling and embracing him like an old friend, even where they were scorched at the edges. His godson’s brilliant work. The sky was dark, but when Sirius closed his eyes for a moment, he could still hear Charles’ laughter as he sat on the porch. Dorea yelling at them to come inside for dinner. James and him flying on their brooms and giggling madly as only misbehaving children could.
“Cool, what do you- holy Merlin.” Draco interrupted himself, prompting Hadrian and his sister to look behind themselves. Both froze and looked awestruck.
“The Greater Good, you mean what suits you and your agenda rather than the law or the good of my traumatized godson. You will lose Albus, that court loss and this media circus is only for your loss. I hope losing everything reminds you what you’ve taken from me and the mothers you are so callously ignoring.” Severus finally relented, allowing Albus to scuttle towards the Great Hall. His glare following him the entire way until his frown melted into a smirk. Minerva should keep him busy enough. “Cockroach Clusters.”
“We have house elves do the chores really. Alex and his father fly in the backyard however, Alex is quite excited to join the Quidditch team for Gryffindor like his father.”
“No one has seen the Potters since Hadrian went missing, Madame Bones is already starting a search, but it will take some time. They haven’t been stripped of their most Noble title because the court case wasn’t even an hour ago.”
Weeks passed with school work, the world's most interesting Halloween feast, and cramming as many politics lessons into his head as possible. Hadrian was exhausted and more than content to simply exist. It was another one of those meetings the Headmaster had to arrange with his mothers and the Potters, where more arguing and useless bantering happened. Severus was escorting the children, Draco tagging along like a lost puppy with Hadrian (the crush his godson had was disgustingly cute). Severus was quick to grab the children and place himself in front of them as Sara slammed open the portrait door gasping for breath.
It’d taken effort and destroying the beautiful tie that Draco had given him. But his leg was clogged up enough to not give him away was he limped to the Potter library and immediately beelined to the Family Grimoire. The raven smiling when he found the book conveniently lying on a table next to a plate that had popped into existence before his eyes.
“Hadrian was really looking forward to Defense, but the teacher is a little dull.  I love potions! I’m not great at them though, it’s basically the same as chemistry! I was horrible at it, but it was still my favorite. Snape’s tutoring Greg, Victor, and I, but I think I just don’t have
Hadrian cocked an eyebrow. “Does that mean I need to cause a scandal? The only ‘closed door’ quirk I can think of is how shameless our mothers’ are with PDA. And that’s just so cute it’s sickening.”
“Lily. Go.” The redhead shot concerned and longing glances between her husband and her ex-son before she hurried Alex away and escaped down the hall. Leaving Hadrian to face
They were in Charms when he found out. Laney was maniacally giggling and having a bit to much fun learning the fire charm, Vince and Greg dutifully pulling books out of the radius as she experimented happily. Draco was watching with no little amount of awe and a healthy dose of fear when Hadrian felt a tap on his shoulder.
Suddenly Professor Snape was upon them, merely glancing at the five snakes before he looked to the lion on the floor as the youngest Weasley boy was working on getting him up. “Twenty points from Gryffindor for lazing on the ground and blocking the entrance to the class.”
“Professor, do you know why we’re being called into the office?” Laney’s pout was at full force while still being respectful to their Head of House. Hadrian glanced back at Snape himself, the man stayed blank but did answer them in a bland voice.
“I think I graduated, no one came to pick me up this year like the last few years. It’s been relieving.”
“Laney used the distraction to catch an extra episode and stay up later. So far Anna’s keeping the tradition. Though more creatively. I found it in the freezer last night.”
Laney herself right now was kicking a football, dodging between Greg and Vince as she both taught them football and proceeded to curb stomp them at the sport. He knew later they were going to be teaching her Quidditch and it’d be their turn to dominate in a game.
Lucius has also shown him ritual magic and allowed him to hone the craft himself, impressed with his skill in performing the difficult magic he had to escape his prison. Hadrian could honestly save he’d never been happier or more fascinated practicing a branch of magic, each successful ritual was an elation, an adrenaline high.
“Hello there! I’m Laney Dragma, this is my brother Hadrian Dragma. You are…?” Her grin was sharp and challenging, Draco smothered a laugh at the affronted look on Potter’s face and motioned Crabbe and Goyle closer, making them loom over the three of them while Hadrian slowly sorted himself back together.
“I know, I know, desert lad. But, in the highlands of Dicia in the mountains, there is deep cold and snow. My mentor taught me how to ice skate there and I fell in love. I also burn like a white boy in the desert sun, so this is better yeah?” Severus spared the teenager a smile, examining the area, before looking under the ice itself. The area was oddly blank, normally teenaged minds were complex with memories and emotions. Severus could see the chunks of life that were missing, but the ice is what scared him.
“She can be a loud terror when she wants professor, we know. No need to sugar coat it, there’s a reason Hadrian’s the voice of reason.” Snape needed to stop being blindsided by how much
There was a certain humiliation in being trained in defense from the age of six and getting curb stomped by your ‘squib’ brother who decided silent casting the entire time sounded like a great time.
“Merlin willing I have been waiting for this.” With that Hadrian brought his fist down and broke Alex’s nose in one swoop. Stopping his screaming abruptly as Hadrian hauled him up by his collar and hissed directly into his face. “Maybe this will give you some food for thought when you think its okay to watch your father kidnap and beat a child he lost custody of for a
He’d had that exact dream. The dark hair, the wide dark blue eyes. He even knew exactly what stuffed dragon his husband was talking about. It’d been a red dragon because that was the mascot of his mother’s muggle university. He’d had the plushie for years. Severus knew it was in the Prince vault, as it had for many years, but Tom had never seen it to Severus’ memory. He’d wanted to save it, for a child, for a son.
“Am I not?” The silence was telling enough. Hadrian smiled apologetically. “He has a point though. I’m sorry. I think it’s a good ice breaker before anyone steps on it thinking it’s an issue. They died when I was a baby, lived with my muggle aunt and uncle until I was… nine? My mentor took me in when… circumstances made living with my relatives difficult. She gave me this house and let me work at her restaurant to maintain a life. I still work there and go to the homeland with her occasionally.”
“How long have you and my son been together?” Hadrian peeked at him, a hand squeezing his knee under the table.
“Tutoring. Eight o’clock Friday night Esmerelda. Piers, eloquently written. Twenty points to Slytherin for teamwork and correct answers. See me after class, both Dragmas.” Laney’s head dropped to the desk with a thud and Hadrian just nodded easily and continued taking his notes. Draco snickered quietly and later on in case Hadrian and Draco watched in awe at the complete failure Vince, Greg, and Laney were making of their potion. Their own was simmering and giving off a soft silver vapor. The other’s had black billowing smoke.
Laney was uncharacteristically quiet; she knew it was worrying everyone. But she couldn’t bring herself to do anything other than stare blankly at the squirming toddler in front of her or the strands of red hair that were slipping into her line of sight. Annabee was being nearly impossible to settle. Incoherent and inconsolable as her little limbs failed and sobbed in absolute hysterics. Hadn’t stopped crying since she’d fallen and Hadrian had disappeared before her eyes.
“The war is more important right now. Thank you for your shelter, Hadrian. As well as the meal, it’s delicious.” Hadrian smiled gently, his frame flickering as it went back to honey tan skin and dark brown hair. Working around the snake on his shoulders, Hadrian green eyes didn’t even glance at his hands as he quickly pulled out his ponytail and put it into a messy bun.
Ah, Hadrian didn’t notice the mini circle that had formed around Alex and them. That was nerve wracking. Still, he pushed it away in his mind to focus as name after name was called until Crabbe was the first one up, heading to Slytherin and quickly followed by Laney who was happily Slytherin with Draco and Goyle. The red head threw her legs over the bench next to her with a cheeky grin. Ever confident he’d follow her.
“Harry, it’s breakfast!” The sweet tone Lily used belied the aggressive banging at the door. “James! Calm down, give him a chance to wake up.”
“Twitches has a completely different context, different age, was a muggle movie of magic and I’m a man if you hadn’t noticed?” The red head giggled into her brother’s shoulder.
Morosely, she set the table just as the floo sounded and she perked up with a quick, but weak, smile. Her husband came strolling into the dining room, still wearing his Auror robes and his brown hair windswept gorgeously. He gave her a heart stopping smile, looking behind his glasses with warm hazel eyes. At least some things would never change. A quick kiss and then they both sat down to their dinner before Lily pounced.
So, this is the part where I tell you last night I basically got possessed and wrote the entirety of the fic. There is four chapters left and I'm debating to publish chapters and wait for a moment between each or if I'm just going to hail mary it and post them at one a day and wrap this up swiftly.
Draco huddled between his own parents lost in his own thoughts as his parents murmured above him. Anxiously, Draco fingered the box in his pocket with a mix of relief and fear. His plans were a little ruined, but hopefully for the better. This also meant instead of praying to his partner’s dead parents he was going to have to not get ripped to pieces by two men who just found out they were fathers that had their little boy ripped away from them and obliviated.
“It was so real. It had felt so real. It was real, is real.” Immediately Hadrian was swept up and crushed into the other man’s arms. Sandwiched comfortably between the two lovers as Tom hovered over both of the shorter men. His princes. The most important men in his life, Tom still stared, as if his senses were lying to him. Like Hadrian was going to vanish if he blinked. “Why can’t I remember you?”
“It’s a pleasure to meet you Hadrian.” The crooked grin looked so innocent in that moment that Draco almost laughed hysterically as Hadrian grabbed her hand with both of his.
“Suni wouldn’t let him get dressed. It’s a Saturday anyway so, it’d probably be more exhausting to try and fight her on it.” Severus reached into his desk drawer and threw it at the half naked eleven-year-old. The raven shrugged it on without a single complaint, not even flinching as Severus shrunk it to fit him snuggly with a flick of his wand. Laney sniggered behind her brother’s shoulder, only smirking when Severus gave her a withering glare. Sara was all over them quickly enough, checking on them and kissing their cheeks. Lucius watched a little surprised as neither preteen tried to squirm away from her affections as many older children did, only basking in it. It was refreshing after three years of Draco’s ‘I’m a big boy’ attitude at being ‘coddled’.
“A bad seed? Jealous monster? Waste of space? Disgrace? Squib? It’s alright, don’t panic; I see that face you’re pulling. I’m joking. I just hear the rumors. But yeah, I’m the ‘lowly’ Harry, twin of the Boy-Who-Lived.” Hadrian smirked. “Shame I’m not so lowly anymore when I’m going to show people just who they’re gossiping about. I’m going to make my family, the
Or was that just when you thought I was a muggle-born gypsy oh great one.” Alex winced and wilted under her harsh sneer and Lily pulled him closer to her before giving a small smile.
The feast was brilliant, even if Hadrian had to glare at Laney to keep her in line with her dietary restrictions. They had a merry time all the way until they were being called to be escorted to their dorms in the dungeon. Hadrian gently tugged on Draco’s arm, gaining the other boy’s attention easily. The brunet jerked a head towards the long head table.
Eleven and performing a ritual, especially this ritual. Hadrian wondered if he was breaking some sort of record as he bled and darkened a couple of the symbols. It would be difficult to scrub off the blood if it didn’t work and he’d be set back another week at least if he needed to sneak into the library and see what he’d gotten wrong.
. This was the first step into learning and growing into his magic, this is where all his possibilities would blossom and grow.
Hadrian tightened his grip on his wand. Lily flinched again and tried to entice him closer with open arms.
The blonde fell to the ground, panting as the adults followed him. They all crowded into a small dark alley. Uncle Severus was bleeding from a small cut on his forehead, but overall, they were safe. For now.
Creeping out of bed, his body protested the movement. Especially his leg. The joint screamed at him viciously, and a peek under the sweatpants he knows he never put on revealed the abused flesh. His knee joint was a swollen and angry red mottled with dark purple near black bruising. Hadrian grit his teeth, a foggy recollection of a boot stomping on his leg.
His leg had healed amazingly after his ordeal and the ministry. The best part was Lucius insistence to replace his wand with a custom wand. He mourned his holly and phoenix feather wand near daily, however the Malfoy Senior had gotten his hand on a search warrant for the Potter Manor and found the feather his core was made out of in Potter’s office, in a warded desk drawer. In France, his new wand was born, a birch wand with his phoenix feather core responded more beautifully than his premade holly wand ever had.
“You corrupted him. He’s a lion like the rest of us Potters on the inside.” Laney rolled her eyes and pressed into Hadrian’s side as he struggled to breathe again. He sounded so much like James it was scaring him. Soft hands gently intertwined with his and squeezed.
James had been indifferent, more focused on Alex. Alex had been distraught and angry that his brother had disappeared when they had promised he’d get to see him. Lily had been equally distressed. Searching all over Wizarding Britain and finding nothing. Until her baby showed up to the sorting. With a sister according to Albus.
The air rippled softly again and Hadrian’s dark hair pulled up to just below his shoulder, going just a bit darker than his natural hair color and falling in soft and thin waves. His eyes melted into the dark onyx of his Uncle’s and the smirk Hadrian tilted onto his lips was dead on. Tom nearly roared with laughter as Severus sputtered beside him. Even his mother was laughing and clapping delightedly.
She was a true task master. In charge of his physical therapy and healing, she pulled no punches. Forcing him to do his exercises daily and dragging his ass into doing the most helpful and horrid things imaginable. Whether it was forcing him to walk up and down the manor stairs until he was shaking from the effort, or tossing him into the pool with his arms bound and a bubble head charm to get him to tread water with his bad leg. He probably wouldn’t have healed as completely if it weren’t for her firm but well intentioned love.
“I’m Sara Anderson, please just call me Sara. This is my wife Erin Dragma. We’re pleased to meet you! You’re Severus Snape, our children’s head of house, right? Minerva was talking to us along the way. I’m glad to see you in person however! As long as we’re not here because certain people,” An amused glance towards the twins was sent. Only Laney grinned bashfully as Hadrian was too busy cooing over his little sister to care. “Decided to blow up a sink again.”
“This, will it purge out the blood adoption? How much change should I expect then?” Tom, Dad, looked him up and down curiously, Papa was more matter of fact as he tapped the vial in Hadrian’s hands.
Hadrian’s went up the stairs with Draco hot on his heels, meeting the blonde’s parents and Uncles(?) had been nice. Even if it was a little tense and worried. He was glad that he finally got to meet them, seeing as Draco had already met his mentor a few times now. Hadrian grabbed his lover and shoved him into one of the guestrooms, Draco gaped at the fully clean and furnished room.
“See? It’s ugly.” Severus looked at him with such sorrow and Tom’s arms squeezed tighter against his waist. But both were overshadowed by Draco finally butting in and stomping over. Grabbing his mate’s face and slamming his lips over the other’s forcefully until he yielded, melting against his long time boyfriend’s grasp. Draco pulling back with a sharp gasp.
“Erin works in a dangerous job, we have all her ducks in a row. I admit though, there’s a bit of lack of plan if both of us were to pass anyway… We want the kids to stay together and have all of our assets going into a trust for their care. However the only back up plan we have are my parents and they are getting quite old.”
Draco laughed, though he had no clue what his love was saying. His lord was immediately sitting up and leaning in excitedly.
Lucius shooed Severus and the women out of the door swiftly after that and made his own greetings to the first-year students. “I’m Lucius, Draco’s father, and your mothers’ new lawyer. Do you two know why you’re here?”
“Never thought I’d see the day you volunteered to claim three children in a week. I trust you’ll be as good a godfather to them as you have been with Draco.” Lucius smiled. “Perfect, the next set is of course talking to the children. Without you present unfortunately to avoid claims of coercion. Would Hadrian be okay with that?”
Severus was sat on one of the chairs beside Lucius, the two mothers were sat in front of them on the couch in his office. Tea and coffee sitting and ever warm mugs on the coffee table between them as well as a pile of documents in front of the blond lawyer.
Draco gave another barking laugh. “Your presence this year is going to be scandal enough. I’m almost disappointed I won’t get a front row seat to the show you’re going to make when they call your name. I want to see that stupid headmaster’s face when you’re sorted.”
Hadrian doodled a tiny bumblebee with a snake at the bottom underneath his name and folded it up to seal it with a wax stamp. Looking up to where Laney was folding up her own reply to their parents, he raised a brow and his sister grinned.
The rest of the trial went about the same, Albus touting the idea of family and love as well as trying to destroy any credibility the Dragma-Anderson household had. Which didn’t work as Lucius viciously and expertly destroyed any doubts and turned back the accusations on the Potters, who were much less prepared for such accusation. Hadrian rolled his eyes discreetly as many Lords were beginning to look at the Potter’s with distain. Especially when his therapist brought up his PTSD and abandonment issues from being tossed at his relatives when he was old enough to remember everything. The few purebloods who agreed with tossing a squib relative always did it young or obliviated the child of the magical world. Obviously, the Potters were hoping Albus and their fame would be enough to ride the coat tails to victory.
“I’ll stick to the basics because you’re more familiar with Dicai Wizarding Traditions, but in the British World. Which, do you remember any of that from school?” Hadrian sighed.
“This may not offer much comfort, but all my charges are under my care. They are my snakes and as such I won’t let anyone hurt them. Hadrian may have been my godson when he was a Potter if Lily had forgiven me for my mistakes. I owe him for not seeing what they’d done and letting my hatred of his father blind me to shielding him.”
Laney was soon in front of him, but he firmly held the smaller girl to his chest when Laney tried to relieve him. Hadrian looked up at his friend with a bright smile that she’d never seen on him, eyes more alive than any fire and misty as his voice cracked and rasped.
“Boo-hoo.” A ghost of a smile fluttered on his lips when she tugged his ponytail with a swift tug in irritation at his bland attention. It was at least his full attention.
Hadrian dropped the shell shocked boy and shot to his feet just as James stopped at the corner. Seeing Alexander bleeding on the ground and Hadrian bleeding while standing over him, however Hadrian was still in an adrenaline rush and not just waking up. So he grabbed a vase from the table and hurled it right at James’ face before taking off.
“The Potters threatened to sue for Hadrian’s custody yes.” The room got so quiet you could here a feather falling. The red haired girl fell silent, mouth slightly agape with wide and shocked eyes locked onto him. Hadrian’s eyes were just as wide, terrified as his body remained stiff as a board, knuckles white where they clutched at his sister.
as Severus and Draco rounded the corner. Right on time to see the older Potter twin staring at his god daughter lying on the ground, face swollen and wand nearly ten feet away from where she was moaning in (exaggerated pain).
“For you? His father? He should have been worth the world.” James glared and opened his mouth. But Sirius was tired of listening. “Avada Kedavra.”
With a start, Laney was the one to notice Alex creeping closer to her brother’s free left side. A small tap got Anna’s attention as Laney flicked her head to the intruder. It was easy once Anna connected the dots and jealously moved to Hadrian’s left side and held her arms up. Bless his heart, the long haired brunet caved thoughtlessly, ignoring Alex and easily hoisting the tiny girl onto his hip and holding her with both arms. Alex gaped.
All his life he'd known nothing but to bend and break his own spine for the sake of others. Now forced into a marriage he never wanted, with a man who hated him beyond belief. Harry could really only see one way out, and that was throwing himself at his enemies feet and letting Death soothe away the humiliation and the pain.
The blood would stain deep and wouldn’t smudge when he had to throw the rug over it again. If he were to keep this a complete secret and only work at night, he would need at least three nights with clear skies and moonlight to finish painting all the runes. Then one night to do the ritual and run.
If Hadrian had shorter, lighter hair, the lord and he might look similar Draco mused. But that’s assumed Hadrian would ever wear his hair short voluntarily. Draco had asked once if Hadrian would even morph his hair to be shorter than his shoulders; but the venomous reply that he was forced into one gender and one short hair-cut for nine months at school was enough even if he didn’t remember anything of school once he came home.
One bed. Which is what he was laying on. With a dresser and a desk it looked like. The window was shut and lined with burgundy drapes (they only had blinds at home, and there was no water. Definitely not the dorms). The whole room was ivory with dark wood, gold accents, and warm red fabrics.
. It was unnerving really when Alex tapped on his shoulder and received that look. His eyes held nothing in them, not even a twinkle of the bright light that was in his mother’s eyes usually. He was unfocused, and Alex felt particularly insulted when instead of talking to him, the girl basically glued to his brother answered for him.
Cons- Underage Magic (might get the Ministry here quicker if they have to arrest me and everyone here. Not a bad idea).
“I don’t know where young Mr. Potter is. Alexander is finishing up the semester at home, you know how family problems go. I’d assume Lily and James took some time off to console and teach their son.” Severus rounded on his employer.
“Final questions children. Do you wish to stay with Sara and Erin?” Hadrian nodded so quick that Lucius thought his head might fall off. Laney looked affronted and deeply offended, protesting the idea vehemently. “Do you wish for visitation with the Potters and Alexander Potter?”
“We wanted a chat with Harry, seeing as he doesn’t seem to have the, affluence or comforts he was born into. I’m concerned as his rightful father as to his treatment. It goes to show that he went missing just days before you two adopted him…” Hadrian glanced up, but Laney frowned and Annabee soon commanded all his attention easily by grabbing his jaw. Erin clenched her jaw with a venomous glare.
Or, rather, actually cared for him rather than some image procured of him. A fantasy son that would never exist except in the mind of Lily. Nor the monster that James seemed determined to make him out to be. As if he, a grown ass man, was ever in the right to kidnap, torture, and abuse a child that happened to be his biological son.
“I hope you have all your things of value brother. You’re coming home now.” He shrugged his shoulders, he never had anything. Harry glanced down, he could see the glittering of glass in his skin, Docile and dazed. He didn’t fight her as they weaved their way through the crowds and the people until they were at her home. Their home. Dragging him up the fire escape on the side of the building to their apartment on top, Laney went running into the house yelling and dragging a petit woman with soft brown hair and honey brown eyes holding a baby.
“Perhaps I’ll talk to Uncle Sev after classes today, we can’t spend the rest of first year hiding in various alcoves and being sandwiched by Vince and Greg, as much as your protection is appreciated.” The boys grunted in agreement as Laney patted their arms. Her wavy auburn hair fanning out behind her.
His Papa choked as Hadrian skipped out of the room and tackled his beloved in his arms. Nagini hissing delightedly and the Malfoy’s snickering quietly at his parents.
The yellow and white boa snickered and slithered up her master’s chest. More firmly pushing herself into his jaw and affectionately scenting it. That was the second time his therapy had been brought to his mind. He doubted the headmaster would let him leave the school, however. He’d continue in the summer, and if it got worse he’d talk to Laney.
Severus paused, as far as he knew when the younger Potter went missing he had never gone to another family. Albus had said he was sent to live with a branch of relatives in the muggle world for better education and a better safer life. Seeing as the Dragma’s adoption began processing a couple weeks after Hadrian went missing from his aunt and uncle’s home; there was little chance he’d went to a bad foster home before the Dragma’s got hold of him.
“You’re gifted in making explosions.” The near maniacal grin that split the girls face made it difficult to keep a blank and straight composure. Hadrian seemed to have drifted back to reality as well, giving a barely there smirk.
“Years with no letters, no phone calls, when Hadrian was adopted your parents didn’t even look up the records and send a letter to us. And you blame me for Hadrian being disinclined to speaking with you? Maybe look at yourself, the sun doesn’t shine out your ass Potter and not everyone likes you.” Alexander spit hate right back as Hadrian felt dizzy, struggling to breath in the face of someone so like his biological father so angry. Flashes of pain and hurt and humiliation coming to the front of his mind.
A loud crack startled Hadrian. The raven whipped around only for something hard to smash into the back of his skull. Dropping like a rock, he hit the ground with a loud smack, Annabee falling from his arms. Distantly, he could hear her screaming and crying, but he couldn’t reach her. Moaning in pain as his head spun and pounded, he blindly groped the floor. Trying to blink the blood out of his eyes and find his baby sister as she continued to cry. Before he shrieked as a foot crushed his leg underneath its weight and a wand fell into his squinted view.
Hadrian held back a scoff. As if she didn’t always do that anyway, even before he escaped the hellscape that was this family. James rounded on him the second her footsteps disappeared, snatching the lists of Hadrian’s desk and hissing viciously. “What’s this?”
“He’s claiming there’s no way we can support three children without an inheritance, but we’re fine! I can prove it! We live in a safe neighborhood on base, the kids had activities, they went to school. They never wanted for food or clothing or love… I don’t want them to take my baby.”
Hadrian gagged as his twin laughed in his expense. Annabee stared confused before mirroring her brother’s look of disgust on instinct. His words were still bland, but they bounced with more cadence that Snape had heard yet when he spoke. “I love the both of you. Keep it in the bedroom and away from my eyes.”
Laney squeezed his hand. Draco took his other side, caging him in and Laney was more than happy to glare at the Potters and hide him from view. Hadrian squeezed her hand back just as the gavel banged and the case started. Albus stood up and motioned to the Potters who were making obviously glances to Hadrian.
Gathering himself up, Hadrian glided up to the stool and sat down as gracefully as he could. Long limbs gave him a lot to practice with that when he’d hit that large growth spurt when he was ten. The hat soon covered his line of sight with the crowd and his mind eased a little bit.
“Six feet under, so I wouldn’t know actually.” Narcissa coughed and Draco groaned when Hadrian just giggled.
“No! He’s my brother and I’m not going to let some muggle born gypsy steal him away and corrupt him to the-“ Snap. The anger cracked and popped like a strike of lightening in his chest, his body moved faster than his mind. The three other purebloods startling as he beat them to the punch. Hauling his former brother by the collar and shoving him against the wall. Hissing venomously next to his ear.
“Shouldn’t we be getting to bed?” Draco nodded and slipped off the bed, all of them getting changed and wandering off to their beds. Hadrian didn’t even bat an eye when Suni snuck up onto the bed for a cuddle, nor when Laney attached herself to his back, a fuzzy bundle squished between her chest and his back. The raven just closed his eyes and accepted it was going to be a family cuddle. Not the worst thing in the world.
Hadrian sighed and forced himself out of the covers. Suni hissing in displeasure, but refusing to release him from her fully body cradle. Her eyes did wander however briefly to the kitten dozing on his nightstand. He was watching Marissa for Laney for the night, apparently the tike didn’t like exploding snap and Draco was a bigger fan of chess. Therefore, he was playing babysitting Uncle for the evening. It helped that Suni was now more curious about the kit than predatory, letting the feline explore in her coils without Hadrian fearing for her safety. Suni was well behaved when he said no, so he hadn’t been too worried to begin with.
Two classes and an evening of tutoring later, and Laney still sucked at potions, but not quite as bad. Professor Snape had spent the time stopping her from killing the three of them while teaching Hadrian the flower language that apparently Lily had taught him so long ago. It was… odd, to think of the woman who abandoned him being an innocent child once. Not unpleasant however, Lily made horrible decisions, but she didn’t cause the pain that her husband had to him.
“There will be time for pleasantries later, so let us get down to business. Is there anything the Potters might use against you?” Erin curled a hand behind her ear, clearing her face of any stray strands, Sara was relaxed underneath her wife’s arm.
“No one’s going to expect us to be up for a while now, so I think we can spare an hour or two…” Dray looked up at him, flushed and looking so adoring and lovingly at him, with a healthy amount of pure love and lust. Hadrian squeezed his thighs against the hips underneath him, admiring the shudder of his lover and letting their joy bleed deep into the night.
Hadrian blinked with mild surprise as the adults were already seated at the table, looking a little worse for wear. Tired and worn down. The man smiled at them gently and ducked past Tom, his father, to get into the kitchen. Pulling a box of pastries out of the fridge and tossing them on the counter for everyone to pick at. The pot of coffee was already brewed to Hadrian’s delight. Tom or Severus must have made coffee for them.
That event had some other consequences as well. Laney was perfect one because of her lack of fucks to give and two,
Hell, if Hadrian hadn’t met Draco, he might have been ‘Potter’ full time. Slipping into whatever twisted role and mind-melding was forced on him. He’d never known his birth parents, maybe never even known his mate.
The sun was gloriously warm against his face, and his torso was also comfortable warm as Annabee slept sounding against his chest under the large tree. The sky was clear and a bright blue, not a cloud in sight in the garden of the Malfoy Manor.
“We have a good chance to remember yes. But Hadrian was exposed to compulsions and memory charms so early and so young that his memories of being Harry at Hogwarts are gone forever, and he was a baby so any memories with us are either faded to nothing or gone. When we get home, I want to make a blood purging potion. I want any remnant of that old bastard’s magic and blood adoption out of our baby.” Tom nodded placatingly, magic still lashing dangerously around them. Slowly, he stretched them out onto the bed, still holding tightly to his husband.
“Yes, that should be fine. He can speak with Hadrian’s therapist Nina too if he wants a better overview of his history.” Lucius jotted some notes down with his quill.
“I’m Draco Malfoy, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle. I’m going to be a Slytherin, what house do you think you’ll be?” Laney’s tight red curls bobbed in the corner of his eye and he looked at Draco’s face. Sharp silver eyes. Hadrian paused, watching as they continued to converse.
Well, that was one way to announce their arrival. A barely there look of scolding crossed his eyes, before he painted on his blank mask. Hand still clutched in Laney’s, his chest froze though. A bubble filling his throat and leaving him dizzy and breathless. He couldn’t do it. Oh god. God. God. Laney squeezed his hand. And stepped to break his line of sight easily and protectively. Snape stood steadily behind him as the world spun slowly.
Pushing open the door, no elves bothered him at all. Either they were gone, or they were hiding away from the turbulent family magic. The dark haired man paused, voices were carrying down the stairs. Probably from the study. That was always where James went when he needed to brood or was stressed. It was where he hid the fire whiskey too. Sirius drew his wand and crept up the stairs, easily drifting through the halls like a silent breeze until he was peeking into the study.
Lucius shoved back any unease, he was a child and a perfectly sane and polite child who was simply powerful and upset for understandable reasons. Magic could be uncontrollable and spurred on by strong emotions, especially when untampered by age and experience. Draco talked about the boy as a treasure, quite infatuated with him honestly. The raven was good. Smiling gently and as calmingly as possible, he took Hadrian’s balled fists into his own grasp.
And he was right. Alex glowered at him, but when he tried to get him into detention he got points removed for picking on his brother again. After all, it was well known that Alex tormented him and his sister. And it was ‘well known’ that Hadrian didn’t retaliate unless pushed and often did do in quiet harmless ways.
“Albus! Don’t play coy or stupid with me! We both know you represented the Potters, they lose and suddenly Hadrian goes missing? Where are the Potters and Hadrian?!” Snape snarled at his employer. His godson was missing and the snake inside him was all venom and fangs, ready to dig in. Albus just smiled calmly.
Then he had to witness Hadrian popping into existence, collapsing from blood loss from a hex James shot at his own son and hemorrhaging from his core because he had to rip the family magic from his soul and blood to escape a household he’d already fought tooth and nail to escape. Magically exhausted from apperating at his young age. Images of him dropping, passing out in Mrs. Anderson’s arms, skin paper white and blood covering his gaunt frame. Hair long and gritty with grease and grime. Limp. Like a puppet without strings.
Silence, until of course like the pop-up book from hell, his sister bolted up right and whooped. Clapping loud and clear which egged on the rest of the Slytherins and Hufflepuffs to join as he let the female professor remove the cap and he smoothly walked to the empty seat between Laney and Draco. Ignoring the incredulous stares easily as he ignored the gaze of his brother borrowing into his back.
There was a time crunch, but there was also no reason to rush like a Gryffindor. He’d sleep on it, look at the lists in the morning to see if he’d miss anything and a make a decision. The back up plan as always was to throw himself out the window and crawl to freedom in the dead of night. Hadrian sighed softly and got up, yanking off the duvet and pulling it under the bed with him as he crawled into the safe space.
The young boy didn’t look much like Snape would have expected at all if he were honest. Alex was the James’ clone he’d hated to see, but his supposed Squib twin looked similar but not the same. He looked more like Lily’s father, with those haunting green eyes. Hair neater than any Potter he’d ever seen. Female Dragma’s hair was wilder than his, bright red hair that looked like a more groomed rat’s nest. A handful, and he just seemed quiet.
Hadrian looked to him, almost as misty-eyed as his uncle as his voice cracked. “I had living parents, and they sent me to live with
“Incareous.” Immediately ropes bound Albus helpless and Sirius stepped up from behind the two of them, wand drawn. James jumped back, wand at the ready. The man snarled at him, his forehead was still bleeding. Obviously from where Hadrian had chucked a vase at his head. Sirius gave a proud smirk. Go Haddy, he hadn’t seen that from the doorway.
“Oh? Then you will have no issue with me lawyering up then. Just for precautions. Can never be to careful when someone’s trying to
“Harry… we just want to be a family. I’m your mother! I’m sorry I wasn’t there for you, I want to be here for you now.” She tried to step closer, but Hadrian shuffled to keep the bed between them. James loomed behind her staring at something, Alex was looking at him beseechingly. Lily had enough sense to stop trying to get closer.
Carefully, Tom handed the paper to Severus, not letting Hadrian look on it too much. It was enough to know his little boy had lived it. He didn’t need to be reminded of it. Tom watched his husband flick through the pages, as a Potions Master, Severus knew the human body much better than Tom. Severus already fair complexion went white as a sheet as he lingered on a single page, his hands brushing Hadrian’s neck. The teen stiffened and glanced at the paper.
“She’s a banana ball python, and a big girl. She’s getting close to five feet long, which is the normal average size for a full grown python. She’s a good girl, she’ll love you.” Draco gave a childish grin, finally looking like a kid rather than a haughty old man.
Scrambling, The raven grabbed the concrete walkway with both of his hands and dragged himself forward and squirmed until he was in the ward lines. He felt bad for bleeding all over the Malfoy’s nice walkway and leaving what were probably startling drag marks. But he was finally safe from any of the Potter nut heads. Though, he probably had some time before James or Albus came calling to the Malfoys either way.
“I wouldn’t worry about me ma’am.” Severus could see the shorter man’s hand squeeze Draco’s thigh under the table and held back a spit take. Internally he was cackling, Hadrian was still smiling like a church boy as the hand squeezed again when Draco wheezed quietly. The young man would’ve made a good Slytherin, Severus mused.
Sara waved her off, “We didn’t know owls were like magic post. We got Laney a kitten for her birthday and a Hogwarts send off. But Hadrian got Suni his ball python for his… oh, was it his ninth birthday?” Erin played with her wife’s fingers idly.
Hadrian was going to reply when the door to their cabin was rudely forced open. A girl with frizzy brown hair barging in unapologetically. Hadrian gave a displeased pout as Laney smiled fondly and patted his arm. A tight smile on her lips as Draco sneered at the intruder.
“Come on. Let’s move quickly, the address is 320 St. Dineral Ave.” Immediately, Draco stepped back and let his mother hold his shoulder and apparate them to the spot just outside the property. The street was dark in the night, but the soft glow of fireflies and the occasional street light made Draco smile again as he hopped up the porch with no hesitation. Keys clinking as he hurriedly opened the door and let his family and the dark lord inside.
Hadrian knew his mothers were only meeting with Lucius just in case, but he was also unsurprised when it turned out to be necessary.
A soft touch on his shoulder jolted him out of his spiral and he looked into Draco’s silver eyes. Concern was evident in his eyes, but Hadrian just gently shrugged it off. Ignoring his food to drape his head onto the blonde’s shoulder. Ignoring everyone else and letting the idle chatter of the other Slytherins wash over him.
Immediately there was pandemonium in the courtroom. A Lord to an Ancient and Noble House doing such a thing was a scandal. Extremely. Hadrian leaned back and watched with apathetic eyes as the judge furiously berated the Potters and signed every document allowing his mothers custody and even a restraining order while giving James and Albus the evil eye. Annabee squealed happily and threw herself at Hadrian. Making a couple Lords smile indulgently as the eldest Dragma held and rocked her softly. Draco snickered quietly.
The shorter woman gave him a sweet smile, “Call me with that lawyer’s number. It’d be nice to meet Draco’s father. Hadrian and Laney positively gush about the lad. If that’s all, expect all these ‘meetings’ to stop. I’m considering you a threat to our family and I will file a restraining order if you push me or my son. Good day.”
“I gotta use the restroom first.” Mama looked around the hall, it was beginning to wind down, and everything looked safe enough.
“I think it’s stupid they don’t let you drop your last name if you don’t want it. Did you see the way Potter and the Weasels were looking at you like you were their next victim? It was like indoctrination, it was barbaric.” The girl, Laney Dragma from what he remembered scowled.
This chapter was inspired by one of you commenters! (Harris you know who you are, did I get the name right?)
Eventually, they finally ended their trip at Gringotts. Draco was nearly vibrating with excitement. Hadrian just rolled his eyes and dismissed his hyperness easily enough. His mother and their lord decided to go to some of the clothing shops, he could hear them debating color schemes the moment they had separated. Uncle Sav and his father had decided to accompany the boys to get Hadrian’s test. Because of the Malfoy status at the bank they were given a private room to get the test. It was a rather easy one. Hadrian was given a dagger and instructed to place seven drops of blood into the quill so it would begin to write on the various pieces of parchment.
“He’s probably stalking the floo like the dungeon bat he is waiting for news, I’ll come with you. Draco? Can you go run to Gringotts and get some money out for dinner?” Mother stood up.
“It seems the Headmaster would like a word with Hadrian today after breakfast. However, he said nothing about informing you as his sibling. We will endeavor there after you two and I eat.” Laney frowned.
“I remember the basic governing style. Some goblin wars from history class. Honestly, I barely remember the classes, most of what British wizarding skills I know I taught myself from my school books. I only remember the creepy headmaster really. It’s like from the moment he picks me up to the moment he drops me off is a giant blur.” Draco frowned.
“Be calm my boy. He’ll have been returned to the Malfoys and his adoptive mothers, he’ll be back to school after they feel it is safe enough and then we can try again. We’ll do a blood adoption and perhaps a compulsion potion just to keep him put. You shouldn’t have given him access to the library, nor kept his door unlocked.” Albus’ voice was soft with a gentle cadence, he was in a similar state of undress.
. His brother was sitting there looking nervous but still animatedly speaking to anyone who would listen. Lily was beautiful as ever, dark and rich red hair flowing smoothly as she quietly chatted with the headmaster, one hand absently stroking her son’s hair.
It took ten minutes for them to get ready and another ten to drag Laney out from her dorms. (Another five to get her to stop mooning at his bare arms and making suggestive comments. Draco pointedly tried not to stare at what were some nice biceps for a preteen). They made it to breakfast on time however and sat next to Crabbe and Goyle on the end. Marissa was on Laney’s lap mewing up a storm and demanding bacon from his sister’s plate. Hadrian hid a smirk. Simply eating and relaxing until the post came swooping down. Draco got his customary letter from his parents and Laney grinned as a letter from one of the postal owls dropped into his hands.
There was definitely a resemblance between the two. Potter had the same general facial structure and their hair was the same shade of dark black-brown. That was about the end of their similarities however.
Dumbledore, motioned to two chairs in front of him. “Sit, Mrs. Dragma and Mrs. Anderson will be here as soon as Minerva has gotten them both. Lemon drop anyone?” Alex grabbed one happily, but hesitated as the two students opposite of him said nothing. Unanimously staying silent and united. Alex swallowed the bitter feeling in the back of his throat.
All the students stepped into the beautiful hall and as a ratty hat started to sing, Hadrian glanced at his companions. Laney had a dreamy smile full of wonder and excitement as she held his hand. Draco caught his eye and gave a confident smirk with Crabbe and Goyle gave him firm nods. It bolstered Hadrian immediately as he looked up at the head table with determination.
And James wand flew out of his hands into Sirius’ where he snapped it with barely a thought before forcing James to his knees at wand point. “Now, before I arrest you and Albus, I get to do this. WHY?! WHY DID YOU HURT MY GODSON?! HOW COULD YOU DARE LAY A HAND ON AND ABANDON YOUR OWN SON YOU WORTHLESS PIECE OF SHIT!”
Draco gaped and Severus’ hands shook. One reaching out to cup Hadrian’s jaw who was still confused, but perceptive enough to know something was happening and to stay quiet. His uncle stepped closer to Hadrian, letting the paper fall to the ground, which Draco’s father snatched up quickly, and held Hadrian’s face with both hands.
“Severus! You could have been so adorable! Look at those cheeks! I keep telling you two, once the wars over you should have a child. Mix your devastating good looks and you’d have a drop dead gorgeous son or daughter.” Lucius smiled at his wife’s teasing, but the adults quickly went quiet as both of the men in question stopped smiling. Only Severus managed a softening in his gaze.
“So, as I understand it, you’re Harry’s adoptive sister, yes?” The headmaster gave another grandfatherly smile as Laney scowled and Snape glided behind them.
“Now, I hate to say this. However in the event of your untimely death do you know where your children would go?” Sara patted her wife’s knee.
“Ah, the anxiety disorder? Not a problem, of course his sister may join.” Sara relaxed again and Severus hid a smile, still sitting beside Lucius. “I hope they won’t try to use it against you or him, however mental health studies are slightly archaic in the Wizarding World. So I hope Potter won’t be depraved enough to dig, if push comes to shove however would Hadrian be comfortable to simply be assessed by a Mind Healer? A muggleborn named Ted Tonks, he would serve as an expert testimony to help keep Hadrian out of Potter’s hands. Only if they pursue legal action that is.” Sara nodded.
“He did the thing, didn’t he? I swear, he could say the most mundane things. But how he says them you think he was Dane Cook or something.” Another flat glare was fixed at her as Hadrian fell silent again. Though this time Draco didn’t feel that stab of coldness, so he assumed Harry was a bit more comfortable in his skin now and just choosing not to respond.
“Brother, can we blow up a sink?” The little one cooed, Snape marveled as the cold boy he was getting to know smiled again. Hadrian held her head in his hands.
Certainly one his easier custody interviews. Lucius hummed, shuffling his paperwork around again and sorting it neatly into relevant folders. Waiting patiently until the two mothers and Severus filed back in. Lucius straightened his back and greeted them with a nod.
Sighing, Hadrian grabbed his wool coat and slung it on as he trotted obediently down the stairs to the floo. Hauling Annabee up onto his hip and good naturedly allowed Draco to wrap his scarf around his neck like a mother hen (or an overprotective house wife). Mama was at the tail end as Mother and Lucius led the way.
Shoving the pieces of his wand into his pocket, he darted out the door. The halls were dreary and oppressive, but the magic still enveloping him was intoxicating and left him feeling high. As if nothing could touch him. Whipping around a corner, he slammed into a small body. Sending them both careening to the floor. Alexander lay under him, shocked.
The excess potions and compulsion charms layered on each other and Tom wasn’t even surprised that no one would recognize Hadrian from Harry. With that much mind manipulation and compulsion, it was a wonder that he wasn’t a moody and violate mess full time. How Hadrian had kept himself intact for the summers away from the insane headmaster was impressive.
“Narcissa would be disappointed if you didn’t bring the child. She’s rather smitten with them, our biggest regret is not being able to have more of our own children. Although even just one child was a bit of a handful to raise with accidental magic.”
He could see why they wanted to remember, however. All the little moments had been taken from them. His birth, maybe even his first word, the memory of whoever attacked them and took their little boy away. Made them unable to get him back until all these years had passed.
“Or you won’t touch this ass for a month.” For emphasis, Hadrian slapped his own ass and swayed his hips enticingly as the brunet sauntered to the kitchen. Draco gaped quietly before reaching out both his arms.
The twins tormented his brother merrily for the rest of the month until they were in the beginnings of December. Each prank more humiliating and hilarious than the last. Until anger finally simmered down into distrust and dislike. Suspicion was also off the Dragma twins as Alex finally stopped screaming about how Laney set him up. (Dumbledore tried to back his savior up, but by the time anyone thought to check their wands it was too little too late and all that was on Laney’s prior incanteum was incendio spells).
Flicking a long ponytail over his shoulder, he blinked and turned his head when there was a knock on the train door. Pulling away from his thoughts he stared at a boy with platinum blonde hair stood in front of the two of them, cocking an eyebrow at his and Laney’s intertwined hands.
“Ask your son, his best friend’s father is the best lawyer in wizarding Britain. However, I am rather close with Malfoy senior as well. I’d be happy to give him your address and arrange a meeting if need be.”
I'm going to be working on a new project, however, the difficult part is deciding which project I work on first. So I'll give you two summaries and if you have an opinion. HMU in the comments! The summaries will be in the chapter notes, I'm running out of room here.
Hadrian glanced down at his hand. Proof of his lover’s devotion, to his parents and their proud eyes on him. To him and how he now resembled them again.
Soon the brunet was moving back into the room, grinning past the snake vying for his attention as he placed down the big dish in the center of the table. Draco almost drooled, but stuck to look at Hadrian with utter admiration.
“Good morning! Severus, right? Coffee?” He nodded, and soon a cup was pressed gently into his hands. He gave a grateful nod as the young man sauntered over to the table and plopped down, leaning back and looking through the window with an effortless grace and power. He could see why even before Draco’s creature inheritance kicked in that he was so taken with the boy. Strong, while still being lithe and elegant.
Immediately upon discovering where he was Hadrian pulled out his wand and locked the door. Whipping his head around his eyes caught onto a trunk at the end of the bed. The letters
Albus had been… concerned, with Harry’s attitude. He was still her sweet boy, but he seemed to resent James. Lashing out at him every time James even got close to him. Distancing himself from everyone. Even his brother. Then, when Harry had left Alex slowly began missing his brother, clammering for stories and wanting to see him again. Losing all his animosity. Just as Albus hoped Harry had.
Hadrian surveyed the room with a quick glance and sharp eyes. Four beds, a large bathroom. Cool with dark elegance, but no windows, no escape. It both soothed him and made him crawl up the wall. Laney’s nails dug into the back of his neck and he blinked back to reality, memories of cupboard neatly shoved back into a different corner of his mind for now. Draco looked around as well, a small frown on his lips.
A sigh echoed through the halls, “Maybe you’ll feel better for dinner.” And her footsteps echoed down the hall.
“That’s dumb. Of course, staying hidden is better. My aunt and uncle knew what I was growing up until I got away from them. It was awful… there are good people. But terrible things happen when the wrong people know…” Draco rubbed his hands along Hadrian’s sides, he’d never seen the scars. Hadrian always stayed out of his effortless as much as possible, but that didn’t mean Draco couldn’t infer his life before he’d been taken in by his boss and given a home to reside in. His mentor hadn’t been a parent in the strictest sense. Hadrian didn’t need a parent after the trauma he’d survived. But she had given Hadrian a roof, traded work for a living wage and food on the table, gave Hadrian a culture and heritage to call home.
A sudden fear gripped Sirius. He knew what a horocrux was. If it was ever released. If Albus or James ever released it out of spite or to try and gain control of Hadrian it would be over. The press would call for his blood and the Ministry would stop at nothing until his little boy was thrown through the veil or kissed. They wouldn’t look for a solution. They would be like James and think only of themselves, rather than a little boy who deserved to live. A victim.
