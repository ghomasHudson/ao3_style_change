Draco woke late to an empty room, and on the bedside table was a vial of hangover potion and a scribbled note that said -Thank you (drink this, you’ll need it)
Draco froze. He had to be imagining things. Potter would never say the very words Draco so wished he would. His addled mind was only able to produce a feeble “what?”
“they’re great craic” agreed Seamus.
With a wave of his wand, mellow and soft music filled the room, and Harry just held Draco there, whispering into his ear.
Draco was in the common room desperately trying to finish an essay for his classics class on the merits of Plato’s republic, which he completely and utterly did not understand, when Harry and Ron came through the door. The two were honestly stuck at the hip- apart from their separate classes, they were never apart. Harry was in dickies dungarees and looking like he stepped straight out of an indie record shop in London, but somehow, he made it look comfortable and approachable, which Draco both resented and found endearing in equal measure.
All too soon, it is time for Harry to go home. He says he’s moved in with his godfather in Bath.
“I know Sirius” Draco replied simply, and watched Harry’s brow furrow, guilt flashing across his face.
Later that night, Draco suddenly remembered his quest to learn harry’s music. “Hoozey!!” he blurted into the darkness.
Draco knew Harry was bi now, which meant he had a marginal chance with him, but hearing Harry talk about all these past relationships, Draco was sure that if they ever got together, Harry would want sex from him, and that was just something Draco couldn’t give him. The thought made him rather melancholy. He wished he could be normal, but he valued himself enough to know that he would not ever try and force himself into having sex; instead, he just resigned himself to the knowledge that he would likely be rejected by anyone he tried to pursue, and the hope that he would find someone to love him regardless of his- he was never sure how to refer to it, refusal? Inability? - aversion to sex.
He switched a light on and the room flooded with soft yellow lamplight. It was a very cozy sitting room, with a tiny sofa and an armchair, as well as a little bookcase full of worn books. On either side of the room was a door, and Harry moved towards the one Draco assumed was the bedroom.
“it’s nothing, I have masses of space and it’s nice to have some help with teddy. You are welcome to come round anytime, to see Draco or the baby” Harry had said, while trying to gently manoeuvre Teddy into some pyjamas without waking him up.
He was proud of the way the tent looked, and he called over to Malfoy that they could put their stuff inside, and set up. As he turned to call to Malfoy, he saw that neither of the other pairs had managed to do their tent, so he sighed and ended up having to do all three. By the time he was done, it had started to get a little chilly, so he donned a massive berghaus fleece that used to belong to Dudley but that he had kept because it was warm and somewhat comforting, despite its associations. Tents all set up, sleeping bags and roll mats sorted, the six set about making dinner.
“that’s better, eh?” he heard Harry say before a strong arm wrapped around his shoulders and he was tucked back into Harry’s side. Draco looked up to see Harry take a swig of his beer, and stared mesmerised at Harry’s jawline, that was dusted with dark stubble, and how his Adam's apple bobbed as he swallowed, and how the beer on his lips glistened in the moonlight. Draco couldn’t believe he was romanticising beer drinking; the same way he couldn’t believe he was tucked up next to a rugby boy- wearing his hoodie no less- but Harry was turning everything on its head. It should have scared Draco but it excited him more instead.
“Alright Draco? Bit hungover there?” Ron laughed, and Draco grimaced.
She giggled, before leaning over the bed to the floor and pulling one of his t-shirts on.
Blaise and Pansy sputtered, before laughing deep rich belly laughs.
“it’s alright. It’s not like I haven’t done this for Ron, or Seamus, or any of my other mates” said harry soothingly, crouching down to rub Draco’s back.
He is jolted out of his reverie by Hermione returning, two steaming cups of vanilla black tea in hand. She curls up next to him on the sofa, wordlessly handing him a mug, and then looking at him expectantly.
When dessert had been cleaned away, Harry said “Draco if you take everyone through to the living room? I’ll put Teddy down for the night.”
sorry! I accidentally posted the wrong chapter!
Harry saw Hermione frowning over the instructions and ambled up behind her, draping his arms over her and bending down to rest his chin on her shoulder. She sighed and leaned back into him. “it reminds me so much of the forest of dean” she whispered, and he could feel the tired sadness in her voice. He supposed that for Hermione this trip wasn’t just a reminder of the horcrux hunt but also a reminder of Ron’s leaving. He hugged her harder and said “he isn’t going anywhere. We know that. And I’m always, always here.” He straightened a little, dropping a kiss to the top of her head before resting his cheek there, content to know he had the rest of his life to be with his friends like this, no longer fearing that the next stranger they met was Voldemort in disguise.
The banging of the door startled him out of his reverie.
Pressing the heels of his hands into his eyes, he took several deep breaths, feeling the burn in his thighs already.
“I sent Dean and Seamus home.” She said, before lapsing back into silence. Minutes passed, with only Draco’s deep breathing to be heard.
“the memory and your panic show that none of this was your fault, so stop beating yourself up over it. Draco might be a nightmare tomorrow. I fear he was a bit too drunk to really process what Blaise had done, the extent to which Blaise had betrayed him.” Pansy sighed, reaching one hand over Draco to hold Harry’s.
Draco wanted to be swallowed up by a hole in the ground.
“after the battle, Andy succumbed to her grief. She couldn’t care for Teddy properly, and I don’t blame her. I had this massive house and all the time in the world given that I had completed my life’s purpose at seventeen, and I was too traumatised from the war to even think about working yet, so I said I would take him, and she gave me full custody rights. Ron and Hermione and the rest of the Weasley’s and some friends from Hogwarts helped me fix the place up and make it homely and baby safe, and the two of us have been living here ever since. We see Andromeda every Sunday for tea, and Teddy never has a shortage of babysitters. It’s hard work, but I’m alone less than I’m not, and everyone has been wonderful in helping me. I love him, so much, and I feel so grateful to be able to give him the childhood I never had.” Harry said.
“Good to hear boys. That’s not to say that I thought you would be, but better safe than sorry.” Wood replied, before striding off to his own building.
The week before the ball was a flurry of activity. The main hall was kitted out with tables. There was a sit-down dinner, followed by dancing. Trucks bringing champagne came and went from the school’s side entrance, and every conversation overheard in the halls was discussing who was bringing who and whose date was fittest and who would be ‘getting some’ that night.
He turned and picked up a camera, charmed to immediately print every photo taken to the printer in Harry’s little study. He took two pictures of Draco with Teddy in his arms, so that Draco and Narcissa could take one home with them. He then settled Teddy into his cot, sent Draco back down to his mother, and ran up to get the pictures.
“I’m off home then. See you lads soon , I'm sure.” Ron said when the food had been finished. He stood from the table and hugged Harry, Sirius and Remus in turn. “Nice t’meet you, Draco. I’m sure you’ll see a lot of me this summer” he said to Draco, who was shocked to be so directly addressed. He felt almost as if he had sunken into the wallpaper most of the time.
Draco was dying. The muggle consultant hadn’t been kidding about the heatwave. He felt like he was melting. The full-coverage, all-black outfit had been a massive mistake and sweat was pouring down his back, making his top stick uncomfortably. He had never felt ore grateful for anything in his life- apart from maybe not being killed by Voldemort- than he was grateful that Potter was carrying half of his stuff for him.
Sirius showed him around, pointing out the historical buildings and who lived where. They went into some of the boutiques, and Sirius bought Remus a thick knitted fisherman’s jumper, telling Draco he tries to buy Remus something every time he comes to the village. It warmed Draco’s heart to see such easy love between two men. It wasn't something he had ever had the privilege of witnessing, and seeing proof that he would be able to live a happy domestic life without a wife meant more to him than he had ever realised. He even found his eyes pricking with tears a bit to hear Sirius talking about Remus with such love and adoration written across his face.
Harry reached out and put a hand on Draco’s shoulder, gently turning him to Harry could step in and take Draco’s place. Draco clung to him like a drowning man, and so Harry decided to forgo the stairs and apparate them straight to their bedroom.  Harry didn’t know what to do. These were very much unforeseen circumstances. He started by taking Draco’s makeup off with a wet wipe, gently wiping his face clean of tears and glitter. Then, he took Draco’s top and jeans off, and placed him in bed, before stripping down to his underwear and sliding in next to Draco, and pulling the blond in close.
After quite a few of his mixed drinks, which by 8 had gone from 60% vodka and 40% lemonade to 80% vodka and 20% lemonade, Draco was relying quite heavily on Harry to keep him upright. He hadn’t been with Harry for the whole evening- at some point early on Harry had disappeared. Draco had caught a glimpse of him hugging Ginny tightly, after which Ginny whispered in his ear and kissed him on the cheek (it was at this point that the % quantity of vodka in his cup began to increase)
this is the end but I'm not sure if I like it, so I may write a sequel one day...
“then its okay” replied Draco, burying himself back into Harry.
“My rooms up here if you wanna go...?” Draco asked instead, feeling utterly out of his depth. He’d only ever had five friends round to his house before, and he’d known them all since before primary, and they all had houses just as big.
Pansy almost dropped her mug. Wandless magic was done only by the most powerful and experienced of wizards. Most are only able to do a wordless Lumos, nox, or if they’re lucky, an aguamenti. That Potter treated a wandless incendio like it was nothing was crazy to her. He must be a veritable well of raw power. She couldn’t tell if it made her feel more safe or more nervous to be stuck with him for a weekend.
“no, Ron this is bad things very bad things you were right this is awful things.” He said, unable to rip his eyes away.
“I think I met him once. I was young, and hiding from Bella, and he found me. He was kind to me. He said he hated being there too, but that we could leave soon. He was kind to me.” Draco repeated the last part. He didn't know why, but it felt important. He looked up from his hands to see a sheen of tears in Sirius’ eyes.
He stayed, shivering in the cold with Ron until the last two mourners left the graveside- Petunia and Dudley. Once all that was left was a mound of fresh tilled earth, Harry and Ron went over, and stood, looking down to where Vernon rested.
“Oh, come on my love” Pansy said, shuffling up until Draco could rest his head on her shoulder, and now it was her turn to run her hands through Draco’s hair, which was almost long enough to be tied in a bun now, given that he hadn't had it cut since arriving at the farm. Pansy said as much, and said she’d leave him a pack of her hair bands. Draco snorted a laugh into her neck and said she could braid it.
“I don’t, I just put in contacts”
“what the actual fuck, Blaise?” hissed Harry, seething. Blaise just shrugged nonchalantly and said “I told you I wanted you, Potter” before turning and strutting back inside. Harry’s anger was quickly replaced by hurt and panic, and he began to shake. He stumbled back into the club and found Dean seemingly waiting for Seamus by the loos. Harry collapsed onto him.
A sleek black BMW pulled up, and Harry stopped talking immediately. Draco was somewhat surprised that it was Harry’s car- he had never indicated a level of wealth close to that of Draco and his friends. He immediately admonished himself for his snobbery, and also remembered that Harry had recently moved to stay with a godfather, who’s financial situation may have been different to Harry’s previous home, not that Draco knew anything about that. Harry was very guarded about it.
“He’s more than a prick,” Draco muttered before he even thought about what he was saying. He flushed red, instinctively expecting to be scolded, but he was pleasantly surprised when Sirius just laughed.
“rolling with the homies”
Harry snorted, “what an inappropriately older step-brother? Are dubious morals your thing, Blondie?”
Harry loved this about Ron- he always knew how to make him laugh and feel loved all at once.
Harry had then prepared another pot of tea, put the fire on because it was getting later and colder, and settled in to explain his sudden fatherhood to Narcissa and Draco.
“Aren’t you going to uni? Any of you?” Draco asked after they had finished. The question had been weighing on his mind for a while.
“I like you too” Harry said in his voice that rumbled along Draco’s bones.
The two were now standing nose to nose
“I'll do anything you want, Draco” Harry said, lacing their fingers together.
Draco sat more gingerly next to Harry, and selected a scone for himself. He nearly groaned in appreciation at the first bite, Ron’s mum clearly had talent in the kitchen. Before he knew it he was on his second already, slurping down tea between bites.
Harry and Blaise spent a lot of time discussing racial politics, and they bonded in their shared identity of being people of colour in a predominantly white institution. As Blaise was Black and Harry Indian, they shared and compared curry recipes, and had become fast friends.
The music held him, spoke to him, soothed him, and so Harry danced. He danced for those he wished he could dance with but never will; Sirius, Fred, Tonks, his parents, his friends. He danced for those he still had, envisioned himself dancing at Ron and Hermione’s wedding, and ultimately, he danced for himself, for the childhood he had lost and the future he was about to gain.
“I think the fact that Sirius refers to me as his cousin and does not specify that I never even met his mother or father doesn't help my case much” Draco said and he felt Hermione nod.
They were laughing and shoving each other, and smelt slightly of beer, and Draco envied their easy existence. He had his friends, sure, but he had never had a friendship like that.
Shaking it off, determined to enjoy the end of his birthday, Draco tugged Pansy into the kitchen where Sirius was standing, leaning against the kitchen counter with a wine bottle in hand. Upon arrival, Remus, Draco and Pansy were all handed thin-stemmed crystal wine glasses and Sirius poured them each a hefty amount, giving Draco the most.
“he’ll be in the porch, and there will be a door between you, don’t worry” Harry laughed, putting his hand out so Talgarth slid up his arm and curled on his chest.
He set Draco down gently, settling him under the duvet.
She was right. By the time everyone was packed, it was near one am, and Harry could tell she was knackered; not just from the transfiguration but the constant bickering about what was needed and what wasn’t needed and how hot would it be and would they need pyjamas and general complaining about the tent sharing situation. She had needed to do all of Ron’s packing for him, which Harry was grateful for as he had thought he would be doing it for Ron.
Hermione and Ron returned with armfuls of chipped glazed clay mugs, and passed them out around everyone, and Harry and Remus followed not five minutes after with big stone jars that they lined up on the table, before pouring for everyone. Draco lifted the mug to his lips and the scent of spiced apple enveloped him. He took a tentative sip and cool apple cider filled his mouth. It was possibly the most delicious thing he had ever tasted. He closed his eyes in bliss as he drank, revelling in the cooling late-spring air against his skin. The moment was so nice he almost forgot he was surrounded by strangers, miles from a home he had never felt fully comfortable in.
“How do you know Latin?”
Pansy squealed “can I help?” Draco shot her an incendiary glare, but she just winked at him before batting her eyelashes at Harry.
- here she looked directly at Harry with a knowing smile, and he was forcibly reminded of the inordinate time he has spent in the hospital wing and vowed not to injure himself this time round-
One sentence had stuck with him in particular:
Shrike, by Hozier
Pansy decided to work off her debts by teaming up with Granger. She claims it’s ‘gratitude’ but we all know it's so she can regain even a crumb of social standing after her somewhat unsavoury comment made during the war.
Draco was replaying the conversation in his head when he heard
“James Potter” Harry said, reading out the inscription under the photo.
“it's actually, er-“Harry stammered, looking at Ron, and going bright red.
“looking sexy, Parkinson” Seamus said as Dean whistled.
Wah dis make you feel like do
He turned to her, his head protesting at the movement. “We didn’t… did we?”
Draco’s heart cracked. He had never seen Harry this vulnerable, even when he had seen his limp body lying in Hagrid’s arms during the final battle. He had never felt more grateful for his mother.
Despite the fact that his date was really just his childhood best friend, he was excited. He loves an excuse to properly dress up. he has a host of suits tailored to his exact measurements that fit his body like a hug, and he can never pass up an opportunity to wear one.
“I’ll floo call them, I’m sure they won’t have plans tonight.” With that, Draco left for the floo, and it took all of Harry’s self-control not to follow and eavesdrop. Instead he pulled out one of his favourite muggle cookbooks, and settled on making a mushroom pasta, just in case anyone was vegetarian. Looking forward to getting out of the house for a shopping trip, he strapped Teddy to his chest, grabbed his wallet from the little table by the front door and left. Only once he was in Tesco, he realised he hadn’t actually received confirmation that the Slytherins would indeed be coming that night.
Harry chuckled, and said “you’ll want to see this mate” before going to the door and flinging it open. “Darling!” squealed Pansy before leaping into his arms, bride-style, and licking along his collar bone. “you taste divine, Potty dear” she said, grinning at him like the Cheshire cat.
Then again that was Draco’s MO. Always pining over men who didn’t want him back, mainly straight boys at school who had wowed Draco with their confidence. Because of this, and because he had always been too scared to come out at school, Draco hadn’t even had his first kiss yet. It made him a bit ashamed to think about it, but with Harry sitting there, glistening with sweat and chatting to Ron about something Draco didn’t really understand, Draco couldn’t help but think about how nice it would be if Harry wanted to kiss him, and how unlikely that was to ever happen.
“you’re welcome to join us Blaisey” said Harry, “But then I would have to bake your balls this morning”
The four of them ate breakfast in amicable silence, everyone too tired or hungry or hungover to maintain conversation. “I don’t know when you intend to leave, but the bedroom is yours for as long as you want it. I was thinking I would take Draco to the cinema today, and you are both more than welcome to join. We could get lunch and make a day of it. Teddy is off to the Weasley’s.”
He had no idea what he was doing, so he let Harry order for him, while he played with Teddy at their table. “you’ve been awfully quiet today” said Harry as he slid into the booth opposite Draco. Draco shuddered internally at Harry’s intense gaze. This felt all too much like a date, yet Draco thought Harry was with the weaslette. That being said, now he thought about it, Harry hadn’t mentioned the fiery redhead at all, and had they been together, surely, she would have helped harry raise the child? “what happened between you and Ginevra?” asked Draco, wincing at his lack of tact. Harry snorted. “nothing happened. Its more about what didn’t happen. Almost nothing did. We were an awful couple. The one time we did have sex it was awkward and uncomfortable. We barely talked, barely spent any time together. At first we put it down to the aftermath of the war but then all that cleared up and we still never saw each other. Then I decided to take Teddy and she saw that as me trying to settle down with her, ‘trap her in domesticity’ as she put it, but honestly, I hadn’t even thought of her when I agreed to take Ted. She wasn’t in my mind at all. That’s when we ended it, about mid-July.” Harry explained.
Draco felt his cheeks heat at being remembered; being included. He kept forgetting that he was liked here. His instinct when addressed by adult men was to shrink back, hide himself, become smaller, as he did with his father, his late grandfather before his passing, the teachers at school who still believed corporal punishment should have been legal. To feel safe around men like this was still a new and tentative feeling for Draco.
“You’re not making it easier, Draco” he replied.
Finally, practice was done, and Harry and Ron, sweaty and high on endorphins made their way back to their dorm house, grinning and half-wrestling, happy that their new team was so welcoming and so good at rugby.
Draco breathed deeply. His head felt soft and fuzzy, so at odds with Harry’s heavy diatribe.
At dinner that night, Draco was looking forward to catching up with all his friends. He had seen most of them at the start of the summer, but he and his family went to France for a month every august, staying in the family chateaux in Bordeaux. His mother would spend her days picking lavender and drinking wine with her girlfriends who lived in France, and his father would conduct business in the day and drink Chambord in the evenings with a book on the origins of Italian opera or something similarly pretentious.
It was only the first Saturday of the year and Draco was already stuck. He deeply regrets taking French, and scoffs at the irony at having spent months every year there- skiing at Christmas and sunbathing in the south in the summer, and yet is utterly unable to do his French homework. Conversational French-not that he knows much of that either- is a world away from textbook French, and the A-level is already so much harder than the gcse.
Whilst the t-shirt was quite tight (uncle ted was not one for sports, he was thin as a beanpole) Harry was not a very tall boy, and so it hung just to the edge of his boxers, giving the impression that he wasn’t wearing underwear at all. Draco may be asexual (Hermione had taught him the term when he had confided in her over text once. She had been asking him about his feelings for Harry, and it all just came out), but he still felt affected by the allure of sex, even if he never wanted to have it, and oh god did he feel affected right now.
Draco fought a shudder. His aunt Bella was bordering on insane. She reminded Draco of the Trunchbull, which her cruelty and utter hatred of children. He liked his aunt Andromeda, but his father had forbidden them from seeing her, as she had married a poor factory worker from the Black Country. His mum and her wrote to each other, and sometimes his mum would sneak off to see her on the pretext of shopping, and take Draco with her, which he loved.
work song, by Hozier
Surrounded by his favourite people, Harry put his headphones in full blast and stared wistfully out of the window, reflecting on the bittersweet nature of his last ever train journey on September first. Ron and Hermione bickered fondly, Neville was talking to an overgrown plant and Luna leant her head on Harry’s shoulder, humming as if she too could hear the notes seeping into Harry’s brain. All too soon, they were in the Great Hall, stars twinkling above them, waiting for McGonagall to announce the Eighth year living arrangements. Harry caught sight of Draco across the hall, and nodded once in acknowledgment. Draco nodded graciously in return, and the two boys, two sides of the same coin, felt something warm start to glow in their chests at the lack of animosity, the recognition of great suffering endured, soon to be overcome.
“gross, potty”
And oh, did they talk. They spent hours bitching about the Blacks, and Draco about his father. Sirius talked about his upbringing, about how his father would hit him with his cane, and so Sirius resented having to use his.
The floo chimed as he whisked his scones out the oven and Molly came bustling through with a sleeping Teddy in her arms. She carefully strapped him into his highchair, before wordlessly helping to set the table for Andromeda’s arrival. It was at times like these that harry almost forgot that Molly had not raised him since birth. Despite Harry having known Molly for less time than he did not know her, she acted as if she had been there all his life. He smiled at her, boxing up a few of the scones for her to take home. Just as she was about to leave, he decided to ask her about his decision on Narcissa. “Molly. I thought that some familial support might help Andy heal. I uh, I invited Narcissa and Malfoy for tea on Wednesday. Even if Andy wants nothing to do with them, they’re still Teddy’s family and I want them in his life if he’s open to it. But do you think I should tell Andy I reached out, and that she should speak to Narcissa, or ask Narcissa to reach out to her when I meet with them?” he asked. Molly beamed. “Harry you sweet forgiving boy. How lovely for you to extend such an olive branch and think of Teddy in that way. As for Andy, I would maybe mention you reached out to them on teddy’s behalf, but not mention that you did it for her too. Wait for her reaction before telling her to speak to Mrs Malfoy.” Replied Molly, brushing a hand down Harry’s cheek before turning back to the floo. Teddy woke up then, and Harry busied himself preparing his milk and a small bowl baby food, thoughts of the black sisters and Malfoy gone from his head for the time being. Much to his disappointment, not that he would ever show it, Andromeda seemed even deeper in grief when she came over. She was spacey, and even though she held Teddy in her lap, she barely played with him, and responded to everything Harry said with a vague ‘that’s nice dear’. Harry hoped that the topic of her estranged sister would snap her out of her reverie. “I wrote to Narcissa Malfoy.” He blurted. She looked up; confusion written all over her face. “she’s Teddy’s great-aunt, and Draco is his cousin, so invited them to meet him. I want Teddy to know all his family.” He explained, suddenly scared she would see this as a betrayal and not the helping hand Harry intended it to be. “oh. I so loved Cissa when we were girls. We united against Bella’s cruelty as children. I miss her often” she responded, in an airy way that reminded Harry so much of Luna. This was a good sign though, he thought. That she was reflecting on good memories of Narcissa, and using a girlhood nickname. “would you be open to mending that bridge” Harry asked, hoping for nonchalance but probably coming across like an interviewer. Andromeda pondered this, playing mindlessly with Teddy’s wispy hair. “I think, maybe I would. If she would want me back. She cut me out, not the other way round. If she were to express a desire to become sisters again, I would consider it” she said. Harry inwardly whooped for joy. Outwardly, he offered Andy a soft smile. He then got up to put Teddy down for his nap, before leading Andy into the living room for their tea. They chatted idly for an hour, before she left, giving him a soft kiss on the cheek before flooing home.
After all the prep and too much snacking on various muffins and biscuits and slices of banana bread, Harry excused himself to go and get changed.
She said, backing away from the notice board. Ron finally shoved his way to the front. “THEY’VE DONE TENT PAIRINGS”
By the time they could spot the tiny figures that were Harry and Remus surrounded by the smaller figures of the sheep, Draco was thoroughly winded and probably already sunburnt, even though it couldn’t have been six thirty  in the morning yet.
The Weasel gapes at Potter until Granger slaps him on the thigh, and everyone else seems to assume that Potter’s joking.
“i’ll drive you” Sirius said, standing to get his keys.
“And then he said ‘I hope to see more of you’. More of me? What does that mean?”
No one had come back into the kitchen by the time he was finished, so Draco just made his way back to his little cottage, changed into pyjamas and settled into bed. The late spring heat was a bit stifling and the duvet was thick and better suited to winter, so he got up and opened the window. He stood there and leaned his head out, savouring the breeze on his face and through his hair.
The walked up the stairs in silence, before Harry turned onto the floor that housed his and Teddy’s bedrooms, and entered the nursery. Draco let out a soft gasp when he saw all the photos, and went straight to the wall and began looking at them all.
“sleep now, Pans. We’ll sort it all out in the morning” whispered Harry, turning onto his back and pulling Draco to him, one arm still wrapped around Pansy’s shoulders.
“Their house is called the Burrow. Ron is Harry’s best friend, has been since they were both born. Ron is the second youngest of seven, with Ginny being the youngest and only girl. You’ll meet two of the older brothers later, they're helping out Remus today and will stay for dinner.”
Ron handed the tin to Draco as they climbed back into the tractor. The metal bottom of the tin was comfortably warm in his lap as they drove. The weather was steadily getting hotter and Draco regretted wearing a sweater.
“come onnnn Harry we haven’t been out in so long and I’m desperate to go on the pull” wheedled Seamus as Harry refused to go clubbing with them in Diagon.
Remus picked up the slack, asking Draco an endless stream of questions about his schooling, which subjects he had studied, what he wanted to do at uni, if he ever went. Draco tried to keep up as best he could, pretending that the cold silence radiating off of Sirius and Harry was something he hadn't even noticed.
All the Gryffindor boys drink, and Finnegan grins and says “we’ve only been together a week, we’re making up for lost time” whilst grinning and sliding a suggestive hand up Thomas’s thigh. I hope he never did that to Potter... I turn to look at Potter, who’s just grinning. He looks almost happy for the couple. It shouldn’t make me relax that he doesn’t seem to have any interest in Finnegan, but it does.
I try and keep the blush at bay, but I can’t. Potter smirks at me, but seems to take pity, because he turns to Granger and says “shall we try truth or dare now?”
Madame Pomfrey came bustling in just as Harry succumbed to the pain and closed his eyes, falling asleep. She took one look at Draco and manhandled him into the adjacent bed with a mouthful of pepper-up.
“What, did you think I’d cough? City boy’s never smoked weed before?” Draco said mockingly.
“do you want to talk about it?” Draco asked hesitantly, aware that just because he trusted Harry with everything, the vast difference in their circumstances meant that it may take months, or even years, for Harry to trust him with things like this.
The image of last night flashes in his mind again, and he closes his eyes and takes a deep breath.

“I picked Luna’s dress. It's very her, just a bit less out there than she would have chosen. She’s picking my suit based on how I described the dress to her. Picking each other’s outfits was her idea, but I am a little bit worried.” Harry said, smiling.
“you can owl Blaise, or Pansy and invite them over whenever. The room is all set up. They could come tonight if it isn’t too late notice- I can make dinner for us. That being said if you want to see them without me that’s fine and I hang upstairs with Teddy” said Harry as Draco emerged in the kitchen doorway.
“Oh, yea that was to make my ex leave me alone, the champagne just… accelerated it a bit, I guess. Was a bit of fun but we’re definitely only friends” Harry said, and Draco had to physically stop himself sighing in relief.
He led Draco into a small room at the very top of the house, in what must have been the attic. It was clean and well kept, with a single bed pushed against one wall, a large chest of drawers wedged in a corner and a desk pushed under a circular skylight.
Where you at?
“come closer to me. Your freezing, my body will warm you up”
“What do you want, Cedric?” Ron asked in his low, no-nonsense voice, and Harry was so grateful for him.
Saturday dawned, bright and early, and Draco was apprehensive. Ron had said that Luna, Hermione and Ginny were all coming to the match, and that Hermione had asked Draco to sit with them. He didn’t particularly want to sit with Luna or Ginny- who he had discovered had been harbouring a crush on Harry since she had first met him at age eleven, and Ron teased Harry mercilessly about it.
Draco expected a typical farm housewife to come bustling down the stairs; skirts and a blouse with an apron on top, a tray of scones in hand and victory rolls secured atop her head. Instead, a man slowly made his way down, gripping the banister. He was wearing black cargo trousers, socks with holes in the toe and a ripped t-shirt. He smirked at Draco, eyes glinting.
The bonfire was crackling nicely now. He was sat sandwiched between Ron and Hermione, his favourite place to sit so as to stop them necking in his presence, and they never seemed to mind much. Ron was using a small knife to sharpen sticks into points so they could roast marshmallows. Once he was done, he nudged Harry with his elbow, so Harry held his hand out and said “accio marshmallows”.
Harry frowned, before getting up and settling Teddy into a strange baby-swing contraption that he had found at a muggle store. He then floo called Hermione, to see if he could wrangle a meeting with Kinglsey that morning. “for you saviour, anything” she winked, telling him to get changed and floo through in fifteen minutes. Twenty minutes later, he found himself sat in Kingsley’s office, Teddy on his lap, desperately trying to explain why Draco is moving in with him without seeming crazy. Kingsley understood, even if the Wizengamot members in attendance were disapproving. Kingsley gave permission before scooping Teddy up and letting the boy play with his robe collar. Harry snapped a photo of his godson in the minister’s office, before thanking Kingsley profusely and rushing home to help Ron and Charlie with the bedroom. He had chosen one for Draco on the floor below Harry and Teddy’s, in the hopes that Draco would be able to sleep through the numerous night-time crying sessions. They cleared the room of dust, before transfiguring an armchair in one corner, and a desk and chair set to be placed under the window. The three men and baby then went down to eat leftover orange polenta cake from Sunday’s tea, and Charlie gave Teddy a small dragon toy he had brought from Romania. It breathed fake fire and kept the infant occupied for hours.
They then enjoyed high tea at One Aldwych, which was a delightful experience. Despite his copious amounts of money, Harry’s upbringing imbued him with forced frugality, and it felt really nice to spend money on himself for once. He was overtly polite to all the staff, well aware that he and Pansy probably came off as spoilt children of foreign dignitaries or some such, and he did not want to fall into that stereotype. Pansy was surprisingly good company; funny, witty and scathing, but in a strangely respectful way. She had come a long way in the short months since the war, and it warmed Harry’s heart to see the improvement.
He nods again, more sure of himself this time.
Draco woke up feeling well rested for the first time in months. He felt a warm weight over his midsection and his heart fluttered when he realised he had been spooned by Potter all night. He was in deep. Too deep. Awfully, horribly deep. Oh, merlin.
It hurt Draco more than he was willing to admit, seeing Potter curled around Granger like that. There was no romance in it, but the tenderness was clear and hard for him to look at. He was also shocked that the Weasel didn’t seem to care that Potter was apparently whispering sweet nothings into his girlfriends-and, if rumours were to be believed, future wife’s- ear. When the sweetness of the moment became too much he ruined the moment by bringing it to the Weasel’s attention, expecting an argument or at least some possessiveness from the Weasel, but all he got was mocking from Granger, and Potter’s stance didn’t really change, until he went off with the Weasel to sort their pathetic excuse for dinner.
It was embarrassing, and he was now unable to look Potter in the eye. Finally, the group stopped for lunch, and Draco welcomed the reprieve until Potter declared that he was ‘bloody boiling’ and shucked off his t shirt. Draco was thoroughly fucked, and not in the way he desperately wanted. He ate his stale sandwich dejectedly, desperately trying to calm down his raging libido. Distracted by finally being able to have an extended break Draco was reminded of the havoc this hike was wreaking on his body. His thighs burned constantly, and his shoulders back and hips ached despite the considerable reduction in his burden thanks to Potter.
Oblivious to the sparkle in her eye, Draco grinned and said “I am, mum. He’s really nice, and really good at French. And he likes poetry, and he gets on well with the boys”
“Draco sweetheart, I bought hot chocolate.”
The next morning, he was awoken by Harry as per, and they set off to the barn where the milking machine was for the cows, but for the first time since he got there, Ginny was stood waiting by the doors to the barn. Draco felt uncomfortable knowing he was in her trousers, but she didn't even spare him a glance, here eyes on Harry the whole time. Draco thinks he might finally have figured it out- she liked him. A lot.
“I could never, Pans. you’re my everything” he said, kissing the top of her head. She hummed and within five minutes her breathing indicated that she was fast asleep.
That was Harry. His voice was thick.
Eventually, though, Harry arrived, Draco saw him through a window, strolling down the winding front path in his dungarees over another large sweater, and an orange beanie over his riotous curls. He always dressed like a ninety’s poster boy.
Potter just shook his head, and when he had unpacked most of Draco’s bag into his own, Draco saw the considerable (and again, impossible) size of Potter’s biceps as he hefted his now-full bag onto his shoulder, before wandering off to where the tents where without a word or even a nod. Draco heaved a sigh. He felt simultaneously worse and so, so much better. The embarrassment of knowing that Potter knew how weak and pathetic Draco really is burned in him, the feeling leaden and nausea-inducing in Draco’s stomach, but the fact that Draco didn’t have to carry what he so clearly was unable to released a surprisingly large weight from his shoulders. As he tried to lift his bag now, he could do it easily.
So he tries to pacify her
“Right. Onto the serious stuff. I don’t know what thoughts you’ve had since last night, but I think you should tell your mum”
Sometimes, in times of self-doubt, he wonders if it is internalised homophobia as a result of his father and school environment, but he is generally quite confident that sex is just something that holds no appeal to him.
Soon the two stopped kissing and started murmuring sweet nothings to each other in the chilly October air, and Draco turned on his heel and ran. He ran all the way to the woods that bordered their property. He fumbled for his phone, needing to unload what he had just seen on someone. Shit, he couldn’t tell the boys. Their parents were in the same social circle. Theo’s dad was even here tonight.
God, how he wished Pansy was there to complain with him and cuddle up with him on the chilly nights and discuss the others with him. He resolved to be more open about how much she meant to him when he returned, and also enquire as to whether she could come and stay for a weekend during the summer sometime. He also needed to ask how the post worked here.
I only wish Pansy had explained the games more thoroughly, though. As we speak. I am sat on the floor, nestled between Pansy and Blaise, as Granger explains ‘never have I ever’, which doesn’t sound awfully grammatically correct.
“I am literally right next to you Draco” laughed Harry. “come on, back to bed with you”
“you look… fucking indescribable” he said, smirking when Draco blushed a deep red.
“I can’t, I mean not after, I mean it pales in comparison” Draco started, but Harry cut him off, sounding commanding even with his voice sounding tinny through the phone speaker.
Members of last year’s team would have mocked Draco and Theo mercilessly, then accused them of sodomy, taken their wine and left. That was what Draco was used to. Not this.
Draco swallowed, mouth suddenly dry, and was so busy staring at boy number two that he missed their introductions. The next thing he consciously heard was the roar of the rugby team as they welcomed their newest additions.
“you’re disgusting Parkinson” laughed Harry, “and technically, its ‘god-daddy’” he said, before turning to the floo, hearing Draco get up off the sofa to follow.
Harry was also always ruffling Draco’s hair, or patting him on the shoulder if they passed in the common room, usually followed by a wink and a dazzling grin. It was killing Draco. Every time he saw Harry, he was desperately waiting for a nickname (pet name, his mind treacherously called them), a touch, a wink, and then after it had happened Draco could focus on little else.
Hermione turned her stricken, tear stained face to the mediwitch, the silent question in her eyes. “they’ll be fine. They’ll need a couple of days here and as eighth years you are welcome to come outside visiting hours if you wish. A bludger hit Harry’s  broom, rather than him, breaking the damned thing in half, impaling him and showering poor Ron in splinters. Ron took a nasty fall due to the shock, but as always they will both make a full recovery.” Just them, a frail first year limped in, and Poppy rushed off to care for her newest ward. Hermione gave Draco a watery grin before magically expanding Ron’s bed and climbing in, curling her small dark body against his, placing a kiss on his cheek and closing her eyes.
“A shame indeed, I would have liked to meet your friends” Harry says, tightening his grip on me and stepping a bit closer- his way of signalling he will want to leave soon.
“Oh, I don’t. I don’t know. I just loved that he saw all of her, or almost all of her, and still wanted her, you know?”
“I’m not asking you to go somewhere else, I’m asking that you warn me first” says Harry, hoping to come across as diplomatic. It doesn’t work. Draco is filled with anger, even though he doesn’t know where it comes from, and he directs it at Harry.
“Up you get blondie. Lots t'be done” was the curt greeting before Harry left the cottage. He heard the murmurs of conversation outside and wondered if it was Remus or Sirius out with Harry.
“He’s here my love” Remus called up the stairs as he held the door open for Draco, motioning for him to take his trainers off and doing the same with his work boots.
“Yeah. Having Pansy here is the best thing ever” Draco responded, smiling, happily aware of the comforting weight of her head on his thigh. “I hadn’t even realised how much I missed her. It’ll kill me to see her go again” he sighed, suddenly realising that he couldn’t keep Pansy in this little idyll he had found, that she would be returning to London the very next day.
And just like that, Harry had a date. And just like that, Draco didn’t want Harry to call him anything other than darling ever again.
“Shit, you’ll be caught” Harry said, clambering out of the massive four-poster bed and herding the boy into their bathroom. He barely had enough time to leap back into bed and grab his book before their door opened again, and- fuck. It was Cedric. Of course, Cedric was their house prefect.
If only Harry knew what she meant.
“I’m sorry” Draco said. He could assume that they had died from that, but he had guessed that already. He now knew who the James was that Effie had mistaken Harry for, and brought back painful memories of the past.
It was now only a few days until his birthday, and though he dearly missed his mother he was glad he wasn’t celebrating 19 in the presence of his father. Draco had recently begun to think that there were a multitude of reasons for his being sent to this farm. Not least because he had refused to apply to Oxford University, where his father, grandfather, great grandfather etc. had all attended.
There were some girls dotted around the dining hall, looking surprisingly pristine after a night of drinking, and one couple in the corner was necking already.
Oh god. Harry had just told Draco about how he has essentially been with three people all before the age of seventeen, and Draco is going to have to say that he has done nothing. Not even a first kiss- he doesn’t count ‘trying’ with Pansy in year eight- nothing at all.
“Does Sirius know? Why didn’t he tell me?” Harry felt equal parts betrayed and overjoyed that he had found a new link to his dad.
He didn’t have to wait long though, as the floo chimed before he had finished his eggs. He yelled “in here, Draco” before continuing to eat. He offered Draco bacon and eggs, which the blond accepted somewhat hesitantly, and then gave Teddy to Draco, who held the child at arm’s length. “you can let him touch you, you know” laughed Harry “what if he vomits on me. Vomit doesn’t come out of cashmere” whispered Draco in a horrified voice. Harry laughed so hard he cried. “then don’t bloody where cashmere around a baby you git” he said. “come on let’s get you moved in” Draco was astonished when Harry didn’t shrink or ‘wingardium leviosa’ his trunk, but the boy simply hefted it up in his arms, before bouncing up the stairs. As much as Draco was loathe to admit it, he couldn’t stop himself thinking how Harry’s arms must look under the baggy clothing he always wears. Draco is appreciative of the room prepared for him, and seemed to Harry to be relieved when he realised, he wasn’t on Teddy’s floor.
He assumed their closeness indicated that perhaps Harry and Hermione were dating, and whilst none of the adults paid any heed, Draco noticed both Ron and Ginny glare somewhat at the two. Interesting.
“my friends already know that I like you, Draco, and they’re all fine with it. Hermione is the one who said I should tell you.”
“You didn’t look like friends last night, Harry. You were all over her” he said, mustering a smirk onto his face. It took an embarrassing amount of effort.
“will you stay with me, tonight?”
“Malfoy” he heard Potter outside. Fuck, Potter couldn’t see him like this.
“I’m going to have to carry Pansy so he’s all yours” said Blaise as he attempted to help Pansy stand. Harry rolled his eyes before bending down and picking Draco up bridal style. Blaise gave up with Pansy and did the same, and the two of them slowly made their way upstairs. Harry directed Blaise to the spare room, before taking Draco to his. He dropped Draco onto the bed and as he was conjuring a glass of water for the blond, he saw Draco trying to undo his shirt buttons, without much success. Harry sighed, and undid Draco’s shirt and slid it off him. He then did Draco’s shoes, socks and trousers, before rolling the underwear-clad boy under the covers, and leaving to check on Teddy.
He explained the meeting to Ron and Hermione the next day, when they dropped by. Hermione was encouraging, but Ron was wary. He relented a bit when he saw the love in Draco’s eyes when he saw the photo, and when Harry had explained how loving and maternal Narcissa had been. He had received a letter from both Malfoys two days after their tea as well. Narcissa’s had thanked him for the effort he had made again, and explained that she had owled Andromeda and the two had arranged to meet for coffee at a muggle establishment. Harry had responded inviting her to babysit Teddy the next week, and with an envelope full of muggle notes, as he had assumed she may need them. The letter from Draco was more surprising, however. It had read
Finally though, Malfoy was ensconced in his sleeping bag, looking at Harry with a soft smile on his face. Harry opened his arms, “let me warm you up” he said, voice low in the dark safety of the tent. Malfoy giggled, and Harry thought he definitely needed to hear that sound more.
Draco sat down near the middle, and was immediately flanked by Pansy and Hermione. Judging from Hermione’s overly effervescent demeanour and the disapproving looks she kept giving Harry, Draco assumed that Harry had told her of their conversation and she was trying to prove that she had liked Draco all along. Which, to be fair, she had.
“oh god. I vomited on myself. On your floor. Shit I’m so sorry”
I thought Potter liked me, just as much as I liked him, but I guess not. I dropped my bag and practically ran into my room, slamming the door and falling into my bed as the tears start to fall. I feel utterly pathetic, but death and heartbreak in the same day is just too overwhelming and so I let myself cry.
If boy number 1’s key features were ginger, tall and freckled; boy number 2 was strong, dark and handsome. He looked like an impossibly muscled Dev Patel type, and it was all Draco could do not to drool. He had a strong jaw, thighs that looked able to crush watermelons, and arms that looked as if they could rip tree trunks from the ground. He was wearing those awful rugby shorts that were too short for decency and exposed an expanse of strong, brown thigh.
“shove off Parkinson, I got baby sick on my pyjamas, I’m about to go and get some clothes on” Harry said, feeling awfully exposed.
Harry was shaking. The idea of forcibly spending a weekend away from his wand went against everything he had ever learnt since he was eleven. The war was over, but he still didn’t feel safe. “Harry, breathe” He felt Hermione’s warm hands grip his, and her commanding voice speared through his anxiety, forcing him to look up into her warm brown eyes as she knelt before where he sat on one of the common room sofas.
“not a chance in hell mate” said Harry, before floo’ing back to Grimmauld, and making up an extra bedroom for Dean and Seamus, should they decide to stay.
He could barely stand the service. Ron held his hand throughout the entire thing, but even with his solid, steadying presence, it was so hard for Harry to hear the priest drone on about the ‘wonderful’ life Vernon had lived, as if Harry wasn’t living, breathing proof of some of the worst parts of humanity, as if Harry didn’t have a triangular burn scar on his upper thigh, that even Ron hadn’t seen yet, for all the awful memories it brought up, from being forced to iron at age seven. As if Harry didn’t have crippling claustrophobia from being forced to live in a cupboard. As if Harry didn’t have permanent nerve damage in his fingers from all the injuries sustained whilst cooking.
“come on Blondie. You invited me to stay. Talk to meeeee” Harry whined, clearly putting it on to distract Draco from his accidental confession. It should have made him angry but it didn’t. Harry never made him feel the things he was supposed to feel.
“I don’t know what you mean?” asked Draco, feeling oddly chastised.
Draco just stares dumbly as Harry leaves, the words ‘it would be good to see you’ circling in his brain.
The two other men barely spared a glance at Draco but both said “y’alright, Draco” in perfect unison. They both had long ginger hair pulled into buns at the back of their necks. Bill’s ear was adorned with piercings, and Charlie had strands of hair falling into his face that he kept tucking behind his ear. They looked so similar to Ron, only older, and Draco was confused at how anyone could tell the six boys apart when they were all together, not that he’d met them all yet.
“how am I supposed to convince him. He barely trusted me not to do a runner before this!” Harry replies, feeling more and more stressed by the minute.
Draco used to love them. He loved being doted on, praised to the high heaves, shown off. He had a marginally better understanding of the wider world now, and now all he saw were old white men and their wives with too much money to spend in a lifetime, hoarding wealth and making political decisions that just kept the poor in poverty and made the rich richer. It was becoming hard to pretend he agreed with their politics.
“I think” Ron whispered conspiratorially, now he saw that Harry had calmed down, “I think I could get some firewhiskey from George, really spice up the weekend, eh?”
“I uh, I wanted to say sorry, Harry. I was such an awful person at school, and I crossed lines that most bullies wouldn’t even go near. The war is a different matter altogether but even before then, I was awful to you, and I’m sorry” Draco said, in a strained voice. Harry turned to him, a solemn look on his face.
“Hey, little man.” Harry whispered now Teddy was awake. He kissed Teddy’s forehead repeatedly until the little boy was giggling and clapping his chubby little hands.
Harry was trying to enjoy the end of his party, but he couldn’t help but think of the disdain in Draco’s voice when asking Harry about his girlfriend. It was almost as if he was jealous, but he was also drunk enough to throw up for the best part of an hour. As those living with him began to drift off to bed and more and more people were leaving via floo, Harry made his way back upstairs and crawled into bed beside Draco, who had thrown up again, conveniently missing the bucket. Harry had left his wand downstairs, so he threw an old towel over the mess and almost collapsed from exhaustion.
Draco stayed and chatted to Hermione and Luna and Ginny. Ginny seemed somewhat suspicious of him, but laughed despite herself at his sarcasm, which he counted as a win.
Any lingering hatred or jealousy Draco felt for the golden trio and the bond they shared disappeared in that moment. How could he do anything but admire a friendship so secure you could hold your best friend’s girlfriend so closely as you both prayed for his safe recovery. Though, he supposed, Hermione was not Ron’s girlfriend to Harry, she was a sister to him just as much as Ron was a brother, and despite the relationship that should have cleaved the three apart, they seemed somehow even stronger.

“Eighth years” she said, pleased at how they all immediately fell silent and turned to her in rapt attention as she spoke.
“This is t’guest house. S’not much, a bedroom, a bathroom and a sitting room. You’ll take meals with us up at the house, aye?” Harry said, fumbling for a key and opening the door.
“I didn’t mean it like that you arrogant prick, I meant we’d make good friends. Don’t worry, you’ll keep your balls”
“ I’m sorry Potter, but I just don’t see you like that. I understand that’s not what you wanted to hear, and I do still wish to be your friend, I enjoy all the time we spend together.”
“thanks, Narcissa. It was a long cold walk from the bus stop”
The first week of year twelve was finally drawing to a close. Draco saw he had French Friday morning and almost dropped his head into his cereal. He had made an utter fool of himself the night before. He just… he hadn’t expected Harry to acknowledge his existence so casually, in front of both of their friends. That wasn’t how the school worked. Rugby boys, by virtue of being good at tackling and getting muddy, believed they were better than everyone around them. They weren't nice to Draco and his boys, and Draco and his boys weren't nice back. That was how it worked, none of this smiling and friendliness. (no matter how much Draco wanted it)
Hermione was practically dragging Harry and Ron by their hair to see the notice board with the DofE groups.
Draco then called his mum as they all went inside. It all felt so surreal to Harry. To think that Draco liked him so much he lied to get off school just to see him, and to think that Narcissa cared enough to let him; not just to let him skip school but to drive him all the way to Harry’s home. The empty space that had invaded his chest since the lawyer had told him the news filled, just a little bit, with warmth from the sheer force of love of the people around him.
“Thanks, so much. You should teach” Draco said, wishing it could accurately convey his gratitude.
The last sentence hit me like a bludger to the stomach, and I stare helplessly as my closed door, desperately wishing Potter will come back even though I know he won’t. I can’t do this. I can’t talk to him. I also can’t let him continue without knowing my feelings, and so like the coward I am, I decide to write it down.
“Thanks, Draco,” Harry said, smiling at him. “I hadn’t thought about it like tha”
God it just makes me feel so shit. I haven’t told Harry this, of course, because then he would simply stop coming to the events and honestly they’re like 40% of his job at this point and in terms of public image and thus public support of the ministry as a whole, Harry Potter the Saviour-Golden-Bastard-Who-Couldnt-Die has to keep making appearances. And so I keep coming with him.
Harry chuckled. “Do you ever give anyone the opportunity to do that, though?” he asked, suddenly looking contemplative.
“116” somehow Harry turned him practically monosyllabic. One-word answers were most unbecoming of a Malfoy. His mother would be disappointed.
From then on, the atmosphere soured completely. Harry went from shovelling heaped handfuls of food into his mouth to eating nothing at all, just staring at his half-finished plate in silence, occasionally sending pleading looks at Sirius. These all went ignored, as Sirius was looking at Effie, his face tight and his eyes shiny.
“Ah, fuck” Harry said, lying back down. “I’m sorry, Draco”
“alone time with you darling? How could I say no?” she said, and followed him up the stairs.
We stand in unison and he clutches me to his chest, and I feel his tears soak through my robes as surely as my tears soak through his shirt. He rocks me gently as we hold each other tightly, and I never ever want to let go.
“if I look ridiculous Parkinson, I will blame you” harry said, but when he looked in the mirror, he had to concede he looked really rather striking.
The attractive older man from Harry’s Instagram stepped out, and Harry launched himself at him. The two went staggering back against the car, Harry's arms tight around the older man’s neck. Draco felt a surge of melancholy that he had never had a relationship like that with his father, but then remembered that Harry's actual father was dead, and he felt awful. Ron was then hugging the man too, and they were both loading their suitcases into the back of the car.
Harry had run back out before Draco had time to sit up in bed, and Draco heard the distant sound of the floo alongside distressed baby cries as he threw some clothes on and ran down after Harry.
“Very easily, Draco. I'm not going to do anything that makes you uncomfortable. And you know that nothing has ever happened between Ron and I. I know you don’t have siblings, but it is honestly like your mum sharing a bed with her sisters, just with less touching, probably.” Harry said, always so considerate.
He’s sat at the little desk in his room, Theo off for the afternoon with Daphne, and his vision is wavering in and out of focus as he stares at his subjunctive worksheet and regrets every decision that brought him there. As much as he was loathe to admit it, he needed help, and there was only one person in his French class that he was even vaguely on talking terms with.
Sirius looked amused but stayed silent, and the drive was over before Draco knew it. They all piled out of the car and Draco noticed that Sirius was leaning on his stick even more heavily than before. The walking around the village must have been hard on him.
Draco took French, Classical Civilisation and English for A-Level. In the words of his mother, ‘humanities are the domain of the upper classes, my darling. Under no circumstances may you study anything else.’
It had forced Draco to re-evaluate all his judgemental views about rugby boys and their aggression and their tribal tendencies. He saw Harry in an entirely new light, and he felt weighed with guilt. He had complained so much about his father, and must have seemed like such a bastard to Harry, who listened to it all, knowing he had spent eleven years in a cupboard.
Pushing thoughts of his father aside, Draco held his glass out, and hastily threw back the substantial amount he had been given. It burnt on the way down, but tasted unequivocally like money, and Draco settled into his birth right of only consuming the most expensive products on the market, surrounded by boys who had been raised the same.
“do you remember much from last night?” asked Harry, getting into the bed and sitting against the headboard, eyes twinkling with amusement as Draco tried to hide his shame in the duvet. The blond groaned
“No shit, Sherlock” Draco mumbled, stealing the joint from between Harry’s fingers. Harry frowned briefly.
The day before his birthday, he discussed this all with Sirius over scones Molly had brought round, with homemade jam and tea. Sirius looked pensive as he took in what Draco was saying.
“of course, make yourself at home. Draco, you could help me put him down if you want?” offered Harry. The blond nodded mutely, before rising to follow Harry out of the room.
“My brother’s gay” said Ron, nodding seriously. Harry rolled his eyes. He knew Ron had good intentions, but it did sometimes come across weirdly, which it had just done, judging by the way in which Wood was regarding him.
He hauled him and his cargo up the next set of stairs, and the realised he didn’t know which of the two rooms was Draco’s. he went to the closest one, and pushed the door open as silently as possible. He saw a body sprawled on a bed, topped with a head of white-blond hair, and knew he had guessed right.
“ask you?” the blond laughs “you are not my FUCKING DAD, POTTER” he screams.
The door knocked and it was entirely too loud and too early and Draco’s head felt like a bomb had exploded in his cerebellum and the light from the window was too bright and the door knocked again, and Draco had no choice but to drag himself out of bed and answer.
After breakfast, Draco followed Remus instead as they checked over the horses, and he and Remus made pleasant conversation about Pansy, how Draco was missing her, when she should come up next and the like. It was a nice change from the morning, and Draco relished it, talking more than he was helping and mainly just watching Remus do most of the work, which the other man seemed happy to do.
“Same people who came after Saint Dunstan’s day, and Percy. He’s another Weasley but he works in the city and only comes home for the summer. That's alright with you?”
“I really, really didn’t want to do this in my office” he starts, reaching out for one of my hands. It’s shaking when I lay it in his large, dark palm.
The traditions of ‘poor people’ as his parents would automatically class people who lived in a village such as Hogsmeade would be laughable to his parents, and Draco wanted to keep his experience sacred and his own, instead of letting them step all over it. He wrote instead of visiting the nearby village and reading in his ‘quaint little sitting room’.
“Ah! Draco, this is Peterson, my pa” Harry says. Peterson gives me a terse nod and says “we’ve met” in a slightly strained manner.
He couldn’t find Potter, so went over to collect the necessary items for his backpack. He was given a roll mat that didn’t look nearly thick enough to make sleeping in a tent comfortable, a sleeping bag in a garish orange colour, food that consisted of ‘instant noodles’, something he had never even heard of, let alone eaten or tried to make- a water bottle and a camp stove. He tried to lift his back to go and collect a tent but realised with a panicky feeling that he wasn’t strong enough to lift it. His breathing started to shallow, and he felt sweat prickle down his back. This was too humiliating.
“shut UP Blaise. I know what he looks like, I live with him”
“our muggle consultants have sent me a list of things to take into account whilst packing, and I believe you would all benefit from listening.” Here, she unrolled a piece of parchment, and cleared her throat. “do not, under any circumstances, wear jeans. There is supposedly a late-summer heatwave this weekend so shorts, and light t-shirts are recommended. Sportswear such as tracksuit trousers, leggings etcetera are recommended. Light rain jackets are required, as well as sturdy hiking boots. Of course, many of you won’t own a single item of clothing on this list, so you have tonight to work on transfiguring your robes into appropriate clothing.”
Hermione just rolled her eyes and took Ron’s hand into her own. Harry was shocked she wasn’t immediately and vehemently objecting to the suggestion of taking alcohol on a school trip, but he supposed she had broken the rules a lot over the years, it just barely seemed like it at the time because the situation was always so dire. Despite himself, he found he was looking forward to their weekend. He absently wondered who the other three would be.
“of course not love, you wouldn’t be able to fetch me cups of tea if you couldn’t walk” smirked Draco, turning his face to kiss Harry. “Pans wants to do our makeup. We shouldn’t keep her waiting”
“the saviour needing help from a lowly death eater, qu’elle surprise” intoned Draco, bending down to help Harry, nevertheless. Harry frowned and opened his mouth, no doubt about to launch into a spiel about Draco’s redemption arc, lack of choice, blah blah blah but Lovegood beat him to it, “we don’t think you’re a death eater, Draco. Your actions in the war could maybe count as death nibbling though, snacking maybe” she said in that dreamy voice of hers, and it was all Draco could do not to drop Harry with how hard he was laughing. Harry roared a laugh and then winced at the pain it caused, and the two slowly made their way to the hospital wing’s bathroom.
“he started rugby so he would have an excuse for all the bruises when people asked. He then just happened to be good at it. I think it was a release for him, too. And the more he was at practice, the less he was at their house.”
“it’ll be okay, yeah? Call me whenever. I’ve done all my work so just let me know if you want to hang out again this week. It would be good to see you.”
“I can’t wait to go out tonight” Draco said against Harry’s neck. “it’s been too long, and you look so delectable when you dance”
Speaking of Potter, about half an hour ago he and Weasley had decided they were too hot for propriety and had removed their t-shirts. Weasley had a surprisingly muscled torso, littered with pale brown freckles and the odd mole. Potter’s was broad-shouldered, and abs peeked through a thin, soft-looking layer of fat on his abdomen. Draco was thankful he was walking behind the two, so he didn’t get… distracted, for want of a better word. The harrowing past two years seemed to have delayed the final stages of puberty through pure stress, and now he was free, his hormones had returned with what one could only call a vengeance. He had suffered a particularly horrifying knack-jump over the summer, after which his voice seemed to have deepened even further. It also meant he had a tendency to be ‘distracted’, especially by Potter. Infuriatingly by Potter.
He had Ron, which was important, but he missed Hermione with all his heart. The people had been friendly enough. Purely by virtue of his place on the rugby team, he was treated with respect by most boys, possibly fear by others. That one posh blond from French seemed to view him with… apprehension and disdain, a feeling Harry was entirely unused to. People were never scared of him. Hermione described him as being the human embodiment of a chocolate Labrador. His friends’ mums always loved him.
“I must say I’m excited to be cooked breakfast. The food last night far exceeded my expectations” said Pansy.
Aside from grumbling about ‘posh rich wankers’, Sirius was also supportive, which left a warm feeling in Harry’s chest.
“don’t you think I know that? I wouldn’t be talking to you right now if I thought you would do that. It’s not me you need to convince” Pansy hisses, and Harry is reminded of the colder, meaner girl she used to be at school. He’s glad her meanness is in defence of Draco.
He loved it there, but he always missed his friends whenever he was away from England’s mountains green.
Harry loved music, needed music, lived on music. The summer between second and third year, the Dursleys’ radio broke and he fished it out the bin when no one was looking, hiding it in his cupboard, and at night when the night was silent and the claustrophobia kept him awake, he would lie next to the radio and weep, listening to whatever he could get the failing machine to play. The music soothed and saved him; it kept him going through the long summers of neglect and abuse and starvation, until September first rolled around again.
Draco scrambled into a sitting position as she came in with a tray, large mugs with whipped cream sat on top. God, he loved his mum.
“What the fuck was that, Harry?” Draco said mildly as he got two cups down. He watched out the window as Hermione went and sat on the doorstep of his little cottage. He sped up making tea for the two of them, and snagged half a pack of chocolate digestives from the breadbin.
Soon enough, it was 5:30 and the ball was in an hour and a half, and they started to get ready. Hermione went into the bathroom to change first, whilst Harry and Ron got into their suits. They had known Luna long enough that being in their pants in front of her wasn’t an issue.
“Right, I think we should do a film analysis. It’s about French culture, right? And cinema is their septieme art, so I think film is a good idea, and then we can talk about its cultural significance.”
“I have to agree. I understand the theory behind it, but it’s too heartless for me to appreciate it.”
“I wish I could offer more advice but this really isn't my area of expertise, '' Draco said.
Well, snog is a better word for it. She took advantage of his open mouth and it was all tongues and spit. Harry quickly cottoned on to what she was doing, and began to kiss her back in earnest, revelling in his chance for revenge against Cedric.
Then the dancing. He had to admit, he and Luna were a striking couple as they swirled around the hall, her waist fitting perfectly into the curve of his arm, her head resting on his shoulder as they waltzed, her tulle skirts floating around her. They looked like faerie royalty.
“For god’s sake, Draco. You didn’t know, yeah? It’s fine. And seeing your dad cheat on your mum is a big deal. It’s a massive deal and I’m glad you called me to talk about it, so now talk to me about it”
Once at the Burrow, Molly insisted on feeding them, and it was an hour of treacle tart and pork pies before they managed to escape with Teddy in tow. Teddy was crying when they arrived back at Grimmauld, so Harry took him straight to the nursery. As much as he loved his nights out, he loved Teddy a hundred thousand times more, and getting him back after a night away was still such an emotional feeling. Harry loved how perfectly the small boy fit in his arms. Teddy was still restless even after countless story books, so Harry decided they can indulge in a film. He puts some trackies and an over-sized t shirt on, and takes the small boy downstairs.
“from what I heard, you missed me soooo much I felt I just had to get back to you”. Draco didn’t dare look up, scared to see the smirk he knew would be gracing Harry’s features.
Harry had seen clueless? It was as if God had heard Draco’s innermost desires and shaped Harry in their likeness. Draco needed the two weeks away to sort out his feelings. He just had to get through the ball first. It would probably be hell, but at least he would look good and have access to unlimited champagne.
“you were the one who came with no forewarning, mate. We can’t be held accountable for what we do in our own home” replied Dean, walking into the kitchen with his underwear on backwards, and Seamus following close behind.
Halfway through the evening, Draco was feeling quite suffocated by all the sycophants, and escaped to the patio. Now he was away from the party, he couldn’t bear to go back, and so he took a meandering walk around the gardens. He reached his mother’s walled rose garden and heard voices. He slipped in, wondering who could be in there so late, and almost screamed at the sight that greeted him.
Bruk off yuh back by Konshens
Harry flopped onto the grass next to Draco, mirroring him by pillowing his head on his hands.
“Harry. I’m not having my sister present whilst I try and woo Hermione. Bring Luna.” Ron said, which a self-deprecating laugh.
“fuck” Harry whispered. He wasn’t sure he could take the emotional toll anymore. He hated thinking about his past, especially the Dursleys, and now he would have to deal with upset and guilt. It all felt like too much. In all the drama of shopping and films and crying, he had forgotten that Ron and Hermione were due round for a late evening tea and cake. He groaned, and then said to Pansy, “Pansy, I forgot that Ron and ‘mione were coming for tea. I need to make a cake; do you want to help me? I can apparate us both straight to the kitchen if you need?” she sniffled and nodded, so he eased them to standing before taking her hand for the side-along. He accio’d two Weasley jumpers for them, knowing the comfort a large knit jumper could bring was unrivalled, and started cooking while Pansy ate some of the left-over brownies, no longer crying. He heard the low murmuring of serious conversation in the living room as he gathered ingredients. He made an indulgent chocolate fudge. Partly because Ron would need placating due to the presence of Pansy and Blaise, and also because he needed comfort food. Once the cake was in the oven, he went to the living room door, and motioned to Draco to come without Blaise. He pulled Draco out into the corridor and said “Ron and ‘mione are coming for tea. I’m not good at all this emotion and I’m feeling quite overwhelmed after dealing with Pansy and hearing Blaise shout. If I put a film on, could the three of you watch it while I spend some time with Ron and Hermione? They just got back from Romania this morning.”
“of course, mate, I'd say we have at least an hour yet, though. Grab a pint at that pub round the corner?” Ron asked. Harry grinned at him.
They ended up watching clueless, because it was on Draco’s ‘recently watched’ playlist and Harry said “no I LOVE that film!” and so what could Draco do but watch it for the second time that week?
“Shall we watch a film, Harry?”
Harry’s gentle song finished, and Luna smiled her ethereal smile up at him and his heart swelled at the love he saw there. He hadn’t even noticed Draco’s arrival until then, but he found that he did not see it as an unwelcome intrusion; he trusted Luna’s judgement of others. Hermione, true to fashion, took this moment to gently ask the others which muggle subjects they wanted to take, showing them the sign-up list that had appeared on the notice board overnight.  Students could take up to three, but no less than one. Draco was overjoyed to see that classical civilisation was an option, and knew that it would be a safe subject for him- he could study his favourite text, he doubted many people would choose it, and it was widely agreed upon that homosexuality was a key component of ancient Greek society, so those that did elect this subject were unlikely to be homophobic.
“did you know about this?” I ask, turning in his arms and resting my own over his shoulders.
(Draco, 7:33)
He wobbled back to his room, narrowly avoiding falling down the stairs through sheer force of will, and collapsed onto his bed fully clothed. He fell asleep almost immediately.
Panic and excitement hit Draco in equal measure. The idea of all that time with Harry was intoxicating, but Draco had never had a proper sleepover before, not like this. He and all his friends have chauffeurs, and so at the end of each day together they would just be picked up and driven home. If they stayed for a long time, it's because their whole family had come to the estate for a weekend of hunting or some such in the summer, at which point the family would have their own set of rooms.
Cedric said nothing, but sniffed, and then left. Harry decided to take the safer route and waited in the bathroom for Cedric to check the other room, then go down all the flights of stairs and leave the year twelve’s wing of the building. When all was silent again, Harry eased out of the bathroom, slipped out of the room, and stole down the stairs in record time.
“How long since you last saw them?” Draco asked.
Ron winced at the sound, and the sour, acidic smell that was starting to permeate the room.
Draco nodded mutely, flushing pink at being the sole receiver of Harry’s attention for the last five-ish minutes.
Effie and Monty had then bought the farm, re-named it after themselves and re-built it from the ground up, starting with only a dairy herd and a handful of sheep. He spoke of how they worked tirelessly to create a business that was strong enough for them to pass down to their son, of how this was where Sirius came when he was kicked out, how he became a second son to them, and thus how he inherited. He ghosted over James’ death, but talked of how he and Remus had moved here straight after, adopting Harry as their own and raising him as they knew his parents would have wanted.
“he’s gone, isn't he” Harry said. Sirius nodded at him, standing and opening his arms. Harry folded into them.
final chapter! I hope you enjoyed this :)
He was settling in with Theo and Blaise, having gratefully swapped his uniform for soft woollen trousers and a merino wool jumper when he heard the door bang open, and the room flood with noise.
“Hermione my dear, have you seen the ring yet?”
Draco is both excited and scared. He doesn’t want sordid details of Harry with another man, but Harry’s face when talking about him after the ball was too intriguing for Draco not to know.
“Okay then. What subject were you thinking?” Sirius said, smiling at him.
“I'll come to yours at some point in hols and we’ll sort it out then, yeah? I need to pack”
(Draco, 6:30)
“then tell me something anyway. Distract me.” Harry said, and Draco could only oblige.
Soon though, Draco gets swept up into conversation with Bill, the brother from the day before, and forgets all about his little spy mission to learn more about the people around him. He spoke to Bill about how he was finding the farm, and even though he had barely spent a week there, Bill seemed genuinely interested in his opinions and thoughts, which made a refreshing change from Harry and Ron.
When they had finished eating, Hermione dragged Draco out of the kitchen before Harry had the chance to say anything to her, and back to the cottage, where they went back to getting to know each other a bit better. Draco was learning that Hermione was quite a tactile person, like Pansy. She was always touching him, whether she was hanging her legs over his, or resting her head on his shoulder, or playing with his fingers while she spoke. It was nice. Her touch was reassuring.
There is a little-known tradition in Slytherin house. Little known on purpose, of course, we keep our cards close to our chest. Whilst the rest of the wizarding world sees and frowns upon our ‘arranged’ marriages, little do they know that we often arrange them ourselves- to an extent.
He was well aware of how pathetic his crush was, but each day he spent in Harry’s company only made his feelings increase, and it was hard to avoid him when they all studied together nearly every day. The only time they weren’t together was when Harry and Ron had rugby training, and on weekends. Harry and Ron often went into the village to see Hermione- who, as it turns out, is not Harry’s girlfriend but his best friend, who Ron is quite hopelessly in love with- and Ron’s little sister. There seemed to be something about Ginny. Ron teased Harry about her a lot, and Harry would always respond with “shut up, Ron”. She was the one who called Harry ‘daddy’ on Instagram, and Draco was curious about their dynamic.
They went to the same club as last time, and like last time Harry had a wonderful time. He received many appreciative stares and looks, but stayed dancing with his group. Soon enough his favourite song came back on, and he turned to Blaise and grinned, “I promised you a dance Zabini”
Soon the hot chocolate was made, and Draco was reclining on a sofa with his little book of Shakespearean sonnets, wondering how he was supposed to wax poetic about his favourite without coming off as too gay to his English teacher. After reading through his four top favourites, and deciding on sonnet 116, he heard the door open and looked up to see Harry and Rugby boy 1 walk in, deep in conversation. Harry’s brow was furrowed, and he looked deeply troubled.
All I know is that to me
“I haven’t, since I was sixteen. You’re the first Black in decades” Sirius replied. Draco felt a sadness weighing on his heart. As much as he hated his father, he loved his mother and he doesn’t know what he would do without his little family unit, as cold, stiff and unaffectionate as it is. His turmoil must have shown on his face.
Soon enough, it was nearing eleven, and the dorm prefect would start doing the rounds, ensuring everyone was where they should be. Draco stood to leave, and the room started to spin. He could feel himself swaying on the spot. Theo had gone off somewhere to facetime Daphne, likely to engage in whiskey-fuelled phone sex, and so Draco was left to make his way back to his room alone.
“we’ll be there.” Said dean. “now leave us to continue what you so rudely interrupted, unless you wish to join of course.”
“I’m probably the last person he wants to see right now, other than Blaise, and you’re his best friend. You know him better than I could even hope to at this point, and even if you can’t magically fix it, you’ll do a better job than me”
(See the end of the chapter for
This was not how things worked. Ron was completely eschewing the informal-yet-formal hierarchy that existed in this school. The hierarchy which dictated, no matter how much Draco believed he should have been at the top, that rugby A-team members were the crème de la crème of the Hogwarts halls, and thus were not so considerate as this.
His father was stood by the wall, and Mrs Prewett was facing him, back to the wall, snogging his face off. One leg was propped against the wall, and his father’s hand was under the satin skirts of her cocktail dress, the other hand violently groping a breast. Draco couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t look away. He couldn’t think. Fuck. He hated his father so, so much.
“Bryn?” Draco asked, remembering that Harry doesn't know what Draco does.
You hit me with a call to your place…
To say that Draco was not looking forward to this weekend would be an understatement. He had barely slept, worried that his body was too weak to cope with the amount of exercise he was expected to do. As well as the obvious effects of the war, being held at the ministry awaiting trial as a growing boy boy, and being fed prison food had left him somewhat malnourished, and he had only just started to build his body back up to wear it should be as an eighteen year old involved in competitive sports for the whole of his secondary school career.
“For fucks sake, Gin, fine. I’ll kiss you, and you’ll leave me alone, alreet?” Harry said, anger evident in his tone.
“I really thought it would be better this time. I sent Blaise home, but I don’t want to go back there. I can’t bear to look at him, knowing he tried to take you away from Draco, and me. I know it’s different, but I really like you Harry. No-one has ever been as kind to me as you have been, even after all I did to you, and I couldn’t bear to lose you.  I hate Blaise for jeopardising that. I hate him for hurting Draco, and for using you to do it.”
Draco stumbled to catch up with him, and squinted ahead to see where they might be going, but was fruitless in his endeavours. They tramped across damp grass for about five minutes until the torch alighted upon a tiny cottage that looked to be about two rooms big.
“Right. Subjunctive isn’t too bad once you get the hang of it, yeah? Just takes some getting used too. What I love is that it’s not technically a tense” Harry says, and Draco is immediately lost. He was supposed to be good at French, dammit.
“Ah. I can see how being gay at a posh private boy’s school may have put a bit of a limit on exploring. Especially given how painfully straight your friends are.” Harry says, and Draco huffs a laugh, tension dissipating from him.
“Everything okay?” Draco asked, curious.
Draco’s musings were interrupted with a soft “Sing for her, Harry”, and soon Harry’s baritone, like warm melted honey, filled the space. Draco recognised this one from the first morning back, and closed his eyes, soaking up the sound.
“I don’t know what your future plans are, but if you don’t want to go back to them, the cottage is yours, if you want it.” Sirius offered. Draco felt the unsaid ‘if you want us, instead’ that should have followed the end of the sentence.
Draco tried not to read too deep into the kiss. He failed.
Hermione takes Pansy out somewhere. Harry wasn’t really paying attention when they left. He returns to his Simnel cake, using magic to make tiny chicks out of marzipan to decorate it with. He is so absorbed in his task, he doesn’t hear the faint footfalls, the soft breathing of two tired bodies until a long, lithe arm sneaks around his waist, and a head of soft blond hair rests on his shoulder.
Hermione looked taken aback for just a second, before taking a deep breath and walking out the room.
“stay” Draco whispered into Potter’s mouth.
“Blimey, ‘Mione. I never noticed,” said Ron.
“I was the older brother. I always had to do everything better. I bore the brunt of all their anger, all their dysfunction. I tried to save him from so much and then I left him there. He had four years in that house without me and I dread to think of what they would have done to him.”
Harry watched Malfoy as he sat on the grass, away from the five of them currently sorting dinner. His chest ached for the hollow shell Malfoy had become. He seemed so isolated, his pale skin and hair a stark contrast to the deep rich earthy tones of the surrounding mountains. He couldn’t tell if Malfoy was alone by choice or not, and so he walked over and sprawled out beside the blond, setting Talgarth down next to him.
Of course he wouldn’t want Draco- who would? Who would want an ex-death eater with anxiety and daddy issues and a mean streak a mile wide. As the familiar vice of self-loathing tightened around his chest, he felt Potter stir behind him and decided he had to get as far away from him as possible.
The end of June came in the ensuing weeks. Draco witnessed Ron and Harry have a seemingly uncomfortable conversation from the window of his cottage, but this time he heard none of it. It didn't take a genius to guess it was about Ginny, though. Afterwards, the two boys seemed completely fine with each other, which brightened Harry up. He had seemed weighed down in the aftermath of the ‘Ginny debacle’ as Sirius jokingly called it, and having Ron still on his side seemed to help.
It is true, but also a subtle hint that Harry needs a bit of break from the suffocation of pity, no matter how well meaning it is. Harry loves him for it.
They settled on Its a Boy Girl thing, but most of it was spent with Hermione ranting about the classist and sexist stereotypes, despite her having said it was one of her favourites. When he teased her about this she said; “I watched this before I fully understood how it was problematic and I loved it so, so much, and still do, I just have to consume it critically” and Draco was beginning to see that she took everything very seriously. He liked it about her.
“it’s okay Parkinson. What happened in the war stays in the war, in my opinion. You did what you did to help those you love and I’m sure others would have done the same. Hogwarts was my home and you and your little group were not so bad as to ever change that. The only person who ever made me feel unsafe at Hogwarts was Voldemort, and perhaps snape in first year” -here Draco snorted- “and maybe I haven’t forgiven it all but like Draco said I have moved past it” Pansy just clutched at him harder, and Harry remembered that as old as they may all feel, Pansy is only an eighteen-year-old girl struggling to reconcile herself with mistakes she made in the past. He stroked her back and rocked her slightly, as he did with Teddy. Draco stood up and mouthed to Harry that he would talk to Blaise, before silently leaving the room.
The end of the film found him tearing up, his body filled with bittersweet emotion. He tried to sniff, quietly but the wetness of the tears gave him away.
“I must say Potter,” a deep voice drawled behind him, “now you’re nearly nude I must admit I do see what all the fuss is about.”
“Draco, my sweet. I was hesitant to tell you over the phone but there have been some changes to do with your father and I. no divorce, of course. At least not until your grandparents die. They'd have a heart attack. But I did confront Lucius, and so we came to an agreement. He has moved to the coastal residence, and has left myself, and you, by extension, with the Wiltshire property. We will still holiday in France as a family, and come together at events such as Christmas, easter, birthday’s, soirees, the like. But for all intents and purposes, we are free of him for the most part.”
“are you okay?” asked Potter softly. “if you didn’t like the kiss then we can forget about it, no hard feelings” he continued, and Draco felt his heart lift at the gentleness in his tone.
Intrigued, Draco stood and made his way over to a table nearby, similar to Molly’s but laden with savoury party foods like finger sandwiches and cheese scones and other very British things. Draco bought himself some cheese scones, and when he looked up again to get closer and overhear the conversation, he saw Remus doing the same, a look of concern on his face. Draco was noticing that Remus always seemed to look quite concerned about those around him, specifically Sirius and Harry.
She keeps singing.
“not you too, Blaise.” Harry deadpanned, and Blaise chuckled.
” hissed Harry in reply
Draco scoffed at the immaturity, but felt so utterly good about the fact that he was, for whatever reason, wanted by Harry. As he got closer, he saw thin white strings snaking out of Harry’s ears and down his torso to a small, unfamiliar black box with a glowing blue box.
“No, not really” Draco said, laughing dryly. “I just caught my father in flagrante with one of his friend’s wives”
“of course, I'm sure. It's like me sharing with Pansy. It's okay, Harry. Really" he says, smiling, and it is. Harry has told him more than ever before in this conversation, even if it was inadvertently. Though saddened by the bed fact, Draco feels elated to have been trusted with it in the first place.
And here I am, with his arm around my waist, under my robes, which caused quite a scandal the first time he did it, but now is taken as par the course of our relationship. And, you know, the wine is okay, the food is passable and it’s not the worst way to spend an evening, if it weren’t for the people.
Harry sat the two of them down, Draco still leaning heavily against him. Harry was so warm, and it was so cold outside.
“That he is. And of course your friend can stay. I’m sorry Harry hasn’t been more forthcoming but like I said, he probably lumps you in with the people who kicked me out at sixteen, who I’m fairly sure you’ve never even met.”
He was telling Remus about how he was on his gap year before uni when the front door slammed.
The fragile peace of Grimmauld after the stress of Teddy’s illness was broken not three days later. Draco had gone out with Pansy, and the next morning Harry awoke to a strange semi-naked man in his kitchen. After the man had gone, he sent Teddy to the Burrow and dragged a very hung-over Draco into the living room.
When Draco finally emerged the next day at around noon, having the decency to at least look ashamed, Harry just gave him a brief nod and greeted him with a curt “Malfoy” before taking Teddy off to the park for a walk. he knew how petty he was being, but he decided that whilst Draco acted like the prick he had been at school Harry would refer to him as such; no ‘Draco’, only ‘Malfoy’. He also knew he didn’t want to see Malfoy for a good long while, and that part of his anger had been jealousy; he couldn’t remember the last time he went on a night out. When he returned from the park, he floo called Andy to see if her and Narcissa would take Teddy for the night, to which they of course said yes. He then owled Dean and Seamus to see if they were up for a night in Soho. The two owled back almost immediately, with a very enthusiastic yes. As a muggle born, Dean had taken Seamus and Harry to their first gay clubs, and the three went sometimes. Harry usually felt too guilty for swapping Teddy for a night out, and so since he had taken custody they had only been three times in as many months, but Harry needed to expel some energy after the hospital trip and the fight.
“I’m sorry” Draco said yet again, feeling like a broken record.
It stung that the only boys his age seemed to refuse to befriend him, but the rational side of Draco’s brain forced him to acknowledge that to them, he was a rich twat who had barged in on their way of life with absolutely know knowledge of farming at all. His inexperience could come off as superiority, and his clothes probably made him seem pretentious. He resolved to try harder, to prove that he was more than the superficial view they probably held of him.
“Sleep usually. Harry is a massive cockblock” said Seamus, laughing when Dean slapped him on the thigh.
When he returned to his room, he saw a small package on the bed. Opening it hesitantly, he saw what looked to be a white version of the small black box Harry carried with him always, and a set of the white wires that were perpetually attached. A note fluttered out, which read: “Merry Christmas, Malfoy. This is an iPod like mine, and I took the liberty of downloading Hozier’s entire discography for you. Turn it on with the big button in the middle, put the headphones in and then press the ‘play’ button, which is the little sideways triangle. -Harry”. Draco was so overtaken by the kindness from Harry of not just the gift, which cannot have been cheap, but also the forethought of having it delivered to the Manor.
“When are you going to put him out of his misery and actually make your move, mate?” Ron asked, laughing.
“ugh, as IF”
By noon, Pansy and Blaise stumbled into the kitchen and tore ravenously into the muffins from a few days before, and the four of them drank enough tea to water a garden whilst Teddy crawled around on the floor, drooling over their sock-clad feet. Once she’d finished, Pansy scooped him into her lap and it warmed Harry’s heart to see her interact with him so lovingly. He and Teddy may come from the same parentless place, but Teddy would never grow up wondering what love felt like.
The three sat around the table, eating cake in calming silence. Hermione got up to make a pot of apple tea, which she sweetened with honey. Finally, Harry felt calm enough to face the others, so he loaded a tray with three slabs of cake for them and braved the living room. They were watching the screen with rapt expressions, but when they heard the trio enter, Blaise shot up, barely waiting for Harry to set the tray down before pulling him into a bone-crushing bear hug. Thankfully, he said nothing, just squeezed for long moments before pulling away. Draco thanked him for the cake with a soft, understanding smile which made Harry’s heart squeeze, and then the golden trio went upstairs, all getting into Harry’s bed and curling around him, keeping him safe.
Draco nodded, and Pansy giggled. “I forgot how much of a lightweight you are Dray darling” he shot her a look full of rage and embarrassment, and Blaise laughed at him too.
“Oh, tell them to bring their stuff, and we can all change in here, yeah? Right let’s change into normal clothes to get them here. I look like a brown Elton john in this, which doesn’t bode well for secrecy”
“I’ll bring Pansy, like I always do” Draco said, hoping that his friends didn’t make a joke about it that accidentally outed him. He liked Harry and Ron, but he couldn’t yet trust them not to be homophobic.
Draco was so enamoured with this new discovery of the Golden Boy he felt himself reply in the same language; “mais quand? J’ne savais pas que tu étais allé en France?” (but when? I didn’t know you had been to France)
“let's not do this now. You don’t need this, after today” he said.
He’s fantasising about which of his suits he will wear when Harry gets up, phone to his ear.
(Draco, 1 pm)
“Where did you get all this muscle you hunk? God you’re like my dream man now” Pansy said when she untucked her face from his neck.
“I wouldn’t worry too much about the team, mate. They seem decent blokes, and I’m always on your side”
“Draco. Latin for dragon, right?”
“Yeah, your mate- we don’t even know his name- stumbled into our room on the dot of curfew last night asking for you, and then we heard the prefect coming, so we shoved him in our bathroom. Diggory stayed ages, because we kind of… know him-“
“Let’s just leave it there, yeah?” Draco said, and Harry nodded and got up, walking away with his shoulders slumped.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Aye” nodded Ron as they walked up to a dirty tractor that was parked a little ways from the main farm house.
He looks contemplative here, as if only realising that I am capable of goodness; as if only realising that I am my own person, not a pawn of my father.
“I had a lovely evening, Draco and I hope to see you again soon. Harry, come with me” and she grabbed his arm, basically frog-marching him out of the cottage. Draco grinned at her matronly-ness and got up to get ready for bed (and possibly try and hear their conversation from his bedroom).
Sirius continued to look distracted, likely by thoughts of Harry’s behaviour, and barely looked up when Draco excused himself to return to his little cottage. He was slowly but surely making his way through every book on the bookshelf, and spent a lot of time either sitting on the little stoop at the front, laying on the lawn, curled up on the sofa or sitting on his windowsill in his bedroom reading. He fell into the books for hours at a time in the afternoon, using the escapism to distract from aching muscles and homesickness, and this afternoon he needed it to distract himself from missing Pansy.
Her eyes and words are so icy
I’m on a roll now, the words falling out of my mouth before I can really think of them.
Honey just put your sweet lips on my lips
“Racism” Hermione said with a sigh. “Sirius’ family always disapproved of his friendship with James because of his race, and I don't know if anyone told you what happened to his parents, but eighteen months after Harry was born his mum and dad were killed in a racially motivated attack in a village called Godric’s Hollow, about an hour’s drive away. His mum’s family lived there, and his parents were visiting.”
“Hey blondie” harry said, leaning against the door jamb.
“I’ve sworn off Weasleys, Dean, you know that, and anyway, it’s not my fault he’s bloody gorgeous and willing to help” retorted Harry. Draco, however, heard none of this exchange, hung up on the fact that none of the Gryffindors in front of him, Harry specifically, had denied the three of them having sex the night before. Draco felt strangely,, uncomfortable? Jealous? He wasn’t sure, but it wasn’t a nice feeling, especially seeing the three touch and joke so casually while only half dressed. He knew he should thank Harry profusely, but his mind was full of thoughts of Harry having sex with people that weren’t him, and it was all he could do to excuse himself to get as far away from Harry as possible. As he was leaving, he heard Seamus’ unmistakeable Irish lilt say “Oh Harry you should have seen his face when you didn’t tell him we didn’t have sex! It was like the exact opposite of when he saw your arse last night. He wants you” Draco flushed red at having been that obvious, and an even deeper red when he realised how happy he was to know that Harry had done nothing but sleep the night before.
Here at Hogwarts, if you made the team, your GCSES, A-Levels, UCAS application all came second to rugby. The school lived, breathed and ate rugby, and it was damned good at it too.
“Come on, pup. Let's go home, maybe see Teddy? Or do some baking? Watch a film? Whatever you want. I've emailed Minerva at Hogwarts. She knows me, and she’s read the court proceedings; she’s given you as much time off as you need”
“I love you, mum” Draco said as he stood, walking towards the door.
That Friday, Draco was lying in bed re-reading his beloved Wilde when he felt the bed dip next to him.
Pansy sniffles against Harry’s shoulder but nods slowly.
The months that stretched before him were still daunting; as much as he loved the place he was in, the people still presented a problem. Of the three his age only one seemed to like him to any degree, and it was clear that he would never achieve the closeness with Hermione that she shared with Harry, or even Ron. Sirius and Remus were kind, but they were also twenty-odd years older than him, and he didn't really want to spend his summer and autumn third wheeling an adult couple when he was just a teenager. The other Weasley brothers were kind and polite too, but they were also much older, and their kindness often felt a little bit like pity.
Draco nodded, before slowly clambering onto his bed and reaching for his laptop, which was on the floor.
He lifted Draco up, but when Draco’s legs shook treacherously when he tried to take a step, harry scooped him up again.
“Molly said something happened and asked me to check on you.” Came Hermione’s kind voice from behind him. Harry put his bowl down and turned in her arms, folding into the embrace and inhaling her comforting scent of lavender and ink.
When Draco finished reading he looked at Sirius, who had a sheen of tears in his silver-gray eyes. “This is amazing, Sirius” he said, and he heard his own voice crack a little with emotion. He distantly noticed Hermione slip silently from the room to let them have their moment.
” the snake flicked its tongue out, and licked Harry’s nose. Harry fell in love with it.
“He had to pick something up from the village, he should be back soon. He’s sorry to miss your birthday breakfast” Sirius said. “And I hope you don’t mind, but we’ve taken the liberty of organising a little celebratory get together for tonight? I don’t know how you usually celebrate your birthday and you never mentioned anything but we didn't want to let it pass unmarked” he continued and Draco’s grin split his face apart.
“I know” Potter whispered back, turning Draco’s face, bending down and kissing him. He tasted of chocolate, and Draco was so caught up in the feeling of Potter kissing him that he didn’t notice that Potter had gently manoeuvred them so that they were lying side by side against the green pillows.
“Talk to Ron. Sorry, I won't be back for a few days. I'll miss you x”
“oh my darling boy you don’t, of course you don’t. No one expects you to go.”
“oh, you bellend that’s exactly what Harry said” said Ron, laughing.
“Draco. I dare you to lose your virginity to Potter”
“I’ll help, yeah? If you want to tell her today, I can stay until you’ve told her, or I can help you draft a letter? Anything you want”
“It's a shame, Harry. We would work so much better together” Bryn said, winking and drawing a finger down Harry’s chest.
A large majestic farm house with stone walls and wooden shutters, that was clearly past its prime and looked a little dilapidated sat at the centre. Around it, garages and tractors and barns and hay bales and animal pens stretched into the green expanse, growing larger as the car made its way down the winding path bringing him ever close to his life for the next few months.
“yeah” Harry breathed out shakily. “yeah”
“mate” he hears Ron say softly. Draco had forgotten that he was there. He wondered at the sudden gentleness. He heard Harry cough behind him.
I jumped the fence and I ran
“when I feel better tomorrow, you can tell me all about Romania. We will have to go through the living room, but not yet.”
“He knows about where I lived before Sirius. You don’t. Therefore, he’s the insensitive one, You aren't, and I don’t even consider him to be insensitive. And before you ask, no I'm not telling you, not now at least. Now, do you have a t-shirt I could wear to bed?”
“ I never want him to forget he’s loved” said Harry as he began taking out Teddy’s pyjamas. “I’ll take one of the two of you, in a minute, though I’m sure if your mother has anything to do with it there will be many future opportunities to take more.” Harry said, turning back to the changing table he had put Teddy on. “do you want to do it?” he asked, holding the soft blue pyjama onesie out to Draco. “oh I, I’ve never held a child before” stuttered Draco, face going pink. “oh Draco, it’s like the best feeling in the world.” Exclaimed Harry. “grab a pillow and sit on that armchair, and put the pillow on your lap” he instructed. Due to his sleepy state, Teddy was much easier to dress, and then Harry went to Draco and gently lay the baby on his pillowed lap.
“the more I think about it, I think that maybe it was finally good because Draco wasn’t on top anymore. Blaise’s name had no stain on it from the war like mine or Draco’s’. Blaise had the cushy flat in Chelsea- which had always been Draco’s dream- and Draco was on probation, stuck in the manor, unable to work or travel abroad or show his face in wizarding society. I’m thinking now that the jealousy never left, and I think Blaise kissed you because he can’t bear to see Draco happy and in love whilst Blaise doesn’t have that.”
‘hurt’, thought Draco bitterly, was an understatement, seeing the state of the two boys upon his arrival.
He will slay you with his tongue
Luna began unceremoniously stripping with Harry there. She was wearing matching underwear with little radishes on, which was just so Luna that it made Harry smile.
He barely registered the walk back to his room, desperately wondering how this would affect his family.
“lists are up, boys! Come on”
Unable to resist, Harry sang along to all the songs, much to Pansy’s delight. Teddy fell asleep by the end, and Harry went to put him to sleep, Pansy in tow. “you are a half-way decent singer, Potter” she said. “my my Parkinson, was that a compliment?” Said Harry, winking at her. He shrugged and said “I like music a lot, and I wasn’t allowed to join family film time as a child, so I make the most of it now” he explained.
“i thought you were being picked up! I would have driven you home myself if I knew”
“oh god Harry. I do not want you to see me in this state”
He regrets the last part the minute it leaves his mouth, and he stares up into the darkness breathing raggedly, waiting for Harry to leave, reject his love, kick him out, but the cries continued, and Harry didn’t move. Draco fell asleep to the sounds of tears.
“But, Draco, I really, really want you to marry me” he says, and I feel the tears fall. It’s all I can do to nod and he grins, a bright dazzling thing that illuminates the whole room.
“my, my Potter. You look even better than the last time I stayed here. Still not as good as you do naked” said Blaise in his deep, sensual voice, stepping over the threshold and wrapping an arm around Harry’s shoulder and steering them inside.
“Harry delivered her a few years ago. She was stuck in her mum and it was his first problematic birth. He still feels a bit like her mam I think. I sees him talking to ‘er some days”
“Ginny’s clothes do him alright then?” Harry asked and Ron nodded.
It was backbreaking work, but Remus barely seemed to break a sweat and soon fifteen feet of fencing had been replaced. Though he had done next to nothing, Draco felt surprisingly accomplished as he looked at the new posts standing proud in the soil.
Those were just generic reasons to attend any good school- there didn’t seem to be anything for Harry here.
“She’s fancied herself in love with you since she knew what love is, Harry.”
Once there, he curled up in bed on top of the duvet, fully clothed, and fell into a fitful sleep. When Remus came to get him for dinner, he said he wasn't feeling well enough.
He will tear your city down
“Right, let's get some tea. The scones aren't as good as Molly’s, but they are good.” Sirius said, setting off towards one of the tea shops Draco had seen, choosing a table outside and lowering himself into a chair, more gingerly than Draco had seen him do at home.
“That sounds like a story I want to hear” Draco replied, wondering how Harry ever managed to date Cedric. They were equally good looking, but Cedric had been at Hogwarts since year seven, so Draco had no idea how he had met Harry.
“okay Malfoy.” He heard Potter say, firmly but not unkindly. “okay. I accept your apology. You were a child with a monster for a father and a monster for a lord. I forgive you.”
“Alright Draco” Harry nodded to him as he passed. Draco hadn’t exactly been… forthcoming with friendship so far, but Harry didn’t want to jump the gun and ignore him completely.
On his way to the makeshift bar- bottles of vodka and fizzy drinks as mixers, and more cans of beer than he could hope to count- he saw a glimpse of Hermione and Ron in the corner, necking.
Of course, it was at this point that Harry finally decided to grace them with his presence and he opened the door and just stood in the doorway, mouth open.
“No, of course not. It wouldn’t be an issue at all” Harry said very softly, before reaching out and tucking a strand of hair behind Draco’s ear. Draco loved it when Harry touched his hair.
Harry sent the letter off, and received a short note of confirmation and thanks in return. He wondered what to bake, but ultimately settled on chocolate fudge cake; Ron would find it hard to be angry if there was chocolate fudge cake involved. Saturday came, and Harry was just getting Teddy up from his nap when he distantly heard the floo from downstairs. He yelled “up here Draco” before desperately wrestling Teddy into his outfit. For an infant, Teddy had a powerful kick. He was losing a fight with a near-new-born when Draco wandered in, in muggle clothes again, to Harry’s repeated astonishment. Only now did Harry realise he hadn’t yet changed and was in pyjama trousers with holes in and a t shirt that sported some baby vomit on the shoulder from earlier. His face burned in embarrassment, but he guessed that this is what parenting is. Still fighting his godson, he said “he’s being really difficult, so I haven’t changed yet. Hope you don’t mind that I’m covered in baby sick. Its basically just milk, right?” he chuckled. He was not expecting Draco’s reaction “oh god if he’s sick why haven’t you taken him to saint mungo’s? Harry?? He’s clearly not well!” yelled Draco, rushing behind Harry to look at Teddy, who gurgled at the new visitor. “what? Draco no that’s just a thing babies do. They vomit sometimes its normal. Its technically not even vomit, it’s just milk he’s spat back up because he didn’t want it.” Harry said. He turned to Draco. “seriously, if I thought even for a minute that he was in danger he would have the best medical care the world has to offer.” Harry said, before turning back to Teddy and cooing over him while doing up the poppers on his onesie. “you just like to make me smell of sick don’t you! Don’t you!” Harry burbled in baby-speak, before picking him up and handing him to a speechless Draco. “apologies Harry. I wasn’t trying to be accusatory. I just don’t know how babies work” “it’s fine, Draco. I was terrified the first time it happened too. Can you hold him and just wait in here while I get changed?” Harry gave him the baby without waiting for an answer, before pulling off his t-shirt as he left the room.
After a while, Draco’s muscles relaxed and he fell back asleep, boneless in Harry’s arms, who was soon sent to sleep by the whiskey in his system.
“oh, Harry” Ron said, wrapping an arm around him where they were sat on the sofa in the cosy living room of Ron’s house.
“it's nothing, mate. Honestly” Harry said. “we’ll go to lunch, and you just shower in our room, yeah?”
Bryn’s parting remark was another tidbit for Draco to file away, about Harry’s lack of a mother, possibly implying that he had one, but lost her. Bryn’s blatant flirtation seemed to rule out the mark being homophobic in origin.
His body relaxed, going boneless at the touch of her soft fingers, and before he knew it, sleep had settled over him like a homemade quilt; soft and welcoming.
in this Draco describes his asexuality as making him 'not normal'. i don't believe this at all, but in my mind that's how his character views it, not what i actually think. asexuality is completely normal, so please don't listen to people who say otherwise.
“You can stay here tonight? I’ll take the sofa” he said, even though it wasn’t late at all.
They looked clumpy and ugly compared to his near skin-tight jeans and thin fitted sweater. The air around him was cool enough for him to gather that it had to be very early in the morning. He dragged himself to the bathroom for a piss and cursory teeth-brushing before he steeled himself for the day ahead and opened the door.
He bent down, and hissed at the snake. “
“What a wanker” Ron replied, pulling an economics textbook out of his backpack.
“yea. My uh... Tonks hurt herself so her and Remus are off to the hospital and Sirius is on babysitting so he was hoping I could stay the night here, if that’s okay? I can't get to Remus's house easily from here, sorry.”
Ron, clearly the name of Rugby boy 1, was nodded and murmuring soothing sounds as Harry complained.
Harry immediately lost himself in dancing with Draco. They set up a slow grind together, arms loosely draped over each other, moving sensually to the songs played at an ear-splitting volume. After what felt like hours, Pansy tugged Draco over to the bar with her, and Harry danced with Dean and Seamus, before the heat overwhelmed him. He yelled over the music that he was going for some fresh air and stumbled out into the smoker’s area. He heard the door open immediately after him, and turned, assuming Draco had seen and followed him out, but it was Blaise.
The door creaked open. Draco’s heart dropped when he thought it might have been his father, but his mother poked her head ‘round the door.
Remember when we first met?
The Potter boy slides in to the chair next to Draco, and pulls out a lined notebook, his school planner and a Charlie and Lola pencil case, which draws a startled laugh from Draco, which he immediately regrets now that the Potter boy is looking at him with those awful (hot) green eyes.
Draco walked in, head stuck in the Iliad for the hundredth time, but he looked up when he heard the words Harry was singing, ‘I wanna feel all your ass in Hawai’I, I want that jet lag from fucking and flying, shoot a child in your mouth while I’m riding’
Harry looked like a god, toned body evident beneath his t-shirt (it said queen but there were for men on the t shirt, not an old lady, which Draco found confusing) , hair running wild. He felt like a god too. He always felt close to Sirius with his long hair running free and the triumphant tones of Queen keeping him buoyed. He looked to the boys singing with him, Draco and the girls just watching in amusement, and he felt a surge of happiness run through him so powerfully that he almost choked on his firewhiskey as he downed it.
Before those hands pulled me from the earth
“I’m sorry” he whispered. “I just don’t know how to help”
“Merlin save me” muttered Parkinson. “don’t bring that thing anywhere near me Potter or I swear to god”
Draco kicked her and she laughed and said, “don’t lie Dray darling, you wish you were there too.” He turned bright red and knocked back the rest of his glass before immediately pouring himself more.
i do recommend this film!! i watched it on a school trip and my french teachers laughed at us hating the sex scenes :)
(Pansy, 7:30)
“Same place the grey eyes come from, I suspect” Draco replied, inexplicably happy when Sirius threw his head back and laughed a deep hearty laugh in response.
(Draco, 5am Saturday 12/09/1998)
Draco finally took proper stock of his surroundings and he realised why his favourite hymn referred to England’s ‘pleasant pastures’. The verdant and vibrant fields imbued him with a sense of vitality and he took a few seconds to bask in the feeling of sunlight on his skin before turning and following Remus, walking gingerly among the cows, scared his newness would incite violence.
“And now, let me introduce the newest members of both the student body, and our wonderful rugby team”
“since when did you have a doorbell mate?” the ginger asked, before looking at Harry and going slack jawed. “what in Merlin’s saggy balls are you wearing Harry?”
As they were sixth form, the girls were technically allowed to stay over for breakfast and then coaches would take them to the village if they had a signed permission slip from parents. Pansy never stayed, but Draco didn’t particularly want her too.
” hissed Talgarth in his ear, and Harry swatted the snake away, laughing.
“they’re good lads. I’m glad we came here”
His eyes flew back open when a strong arm wrapped itself over Draco and pulled him flush against Potter, who turned to lay on his side, then curled his body around Draco. It was a bittersweet feeling at first, knowing Draco could get this close but no closer, but soon the ‘sweet’ eclipsed the ‘bitter’, as the warmth that leaked out of Potter and into Draco, and he relaxed into Potter’s body, feeling safe cocooned in the warmth.
“It’s lovely to meet you, Hermione,” Draco replied, happy that she seemed to have taken to him faster than Harry and Ron.
“Harry! Ron! We’re having a bit of a lad's drinks in our dorm tonight; it’ll be great craic. Welcome in the new year with style and all that. Bring yourselves along lads, sure it’ll be grand”
it worked wonderfully. It shocked everyone, and I received no less than fifteen howlers from Azkaban, and I felt so utterly self-satisfied.
Draco thought he’d get whiplash from the abrupt subject change, but could tell it was the wrong time to push.
“Tell me more about your dream josh, then” Harry said, his face close enough to Draco’s that Draco could feel the warmth of his breath.
Talia by King Princess
“ugh, I thought we were friends Draco” moaned Harry, rolling out of bed with his eyes still closed. Something tight eased in Draco’s chest when Harry didn’t respond with the burning anger and aggression that was the third in all their interactions up until the war.
Pansy and Blaise then went shopping for a few hours, Pansy claiming she was in desperate need for a new outfit for tonight. Harry and Draco made cupcakes, or rather Harry made cupcakes and Draco watched and unhelpfully slapped Harry’s bum whenever it came within arm’s reach. Once they were in the oven, Draco pinned Harry against the counter and snogged Harry within an inch of his life.
“Yeah, apart from him. Hermione more than made up for it tonight though” he replied.
“I don’t fucking know, Dean” Harry groaned, desperately wishing he could go back in time to seven minutes ago and somehow stop the whole thing from having happened.
As expected, Harry had not slept well, but pleasantly he found himself on a sofa in the common room at about 5 am, with Luna’s head in his lap as she dozed and a fragrant cup of tea warming his hands and heart. “sing to me, Harry?” came Luna’s lilting voice, floating up to him in his daydream world. He stroked her hair as he racked his brains for the first line of what he knew was Luna’s favourite. “boys working on empty, is that the kind of way to face the burning heat?”  he began, voice a bit croaky from not being used much that morning, but Luna hummed with happiness, so he continued. “cause my baby’s sweet as can be, she gives me toothaches just from kissing me.” His voice grew stronger now, “when my time comes around, lay me gently in the cold dark earth, no grave could hold my body down, I’ll crawl home to her”
Draco will never admit he always walks past hoping the door will be open.
“I'm sorry you let it hold you back from relationships.” Harry whispered into the space between them.
Harry coughed. “I-er. My parents are dead, Draco”
Then, Ron left, spurring everyone else into action.
They had a vast quantity of chickens, for the eggs, who ran around freely, though many of them stayed around where the farmhouse was.
Oh, Harry felt bad that he had made Draco feel as if it were his fault, but also relieved, because he could fix this, without having to face his past too much.
“yeah” Harry said, giving Ron a last hug before he sped away to Hogwarts. He turned around and went back inside, curling around Sirius’ body on the sofa, as if one man could keep the terrors of the world at bay.
“what do you do in your baby-free time then Potty?” asked Pansy, on what looked like her fifth glass.
He and Ron waited until the service had started, then slipped into the back of the church, sitting in an empty pew at the very end. He saw Petunia’s head turn at the intrusion, saw her face screw up in anger and bitterness as she beheld them. He saw the tears glinting in her eyes, and tried to remind himself that today she wasn’t his abusive aunt, today she was merely a woman mourning the loss of her husband. He didn’t succeed. He knew she was both, and that the tumultuous emotions of the day would likely make her crueller to him, if she got within spitting distance.
“That was surprisingly good advice, Draco” Sirius said, smiling at him. Draco blushed, so unused to praise from a father-like figure. Lucius had never once said anything like that. Draco was hoping that he might get some praise on his a-level results when they came, but he knew he was being unrealistic.
His finger hovered above Harry’s number on his phone. He didn’t know if they were the right kind of friends for this, but he had no one else to talk to, and so he pressed the ‘call’ button.
“I’m just grateful we got back after you two had gone to sleep. I cannot believe you did bits with Luna”
He had spent a lot of time with Ron since his return, who had explained that the reason Harry went to Dursley’s rather than Sirius was because blood relations took precedence over god-parents, and the fact that the Dursley’s were a family with their own son meant the courts had thought they would be better suited to raising Harry than the single, childless man Sirius was.
Harry laughed. “this isn’t for you mate, this is for Pansy and Blaise. Just wait, and you’ll see what I mean” Harry said, heading upstairs and thinking about how Pansy’s new habit of coming in the front door so she could fling herself into Harry’s arms would shock Ron.
I can almost hear his face turning purple.
Draco was sick with worry the day Harry was due to return to school. He had taken a week off, and even though Draco had been at home for two of those days, he hadn't seen Harry, who had instead been with his family, and Hermione. He knew it was because they knew Harry and his past better, but he couldn’t help but feel like he was unimportant, because Harry hadn't needed him.
Harry turned around and yelled “bye Draco”, and the fact that Harry remembered Draco even through what was clearly a joyous reunion made Draco feel all warm. Harry made him feel that way a lot.
“Draco, its past 1pm. Everyone else has gone out for lunch, and I stayed to make sure you hadn’t died between me getting up for breakfast and everyone leaning.”
Narcissa stood up and swept harry into a hug that surprisingly reminded him of Molly. He relaxed into her embrace, glad he had reached out to them for Teddy, now he saw all the love that lived inside Narcissa. She gave Draco a knowing look, and excused herself to the toilet. Once she had gone, Draco opened his mouth. “I was so awful to you. God Harry, I had no idea. I thought you were doted on, that you were worshipped, and you weren’t even fed” Draco sounded horrified. Tears slid down his porcelain cheeks, but he made no move to wipe them away. Harry sat down to him on the sofa and put a hesitant hand on the blond’s shoulder. “you didn’t know. And this can be a lesson to always be kind to people because you never know what they’re going through. A lesson you can teach to Teddy when he’s old enough to understand.” Harry said, gently. He wasn’t sure that he had quite forgive Draco for his past bullying, but he could see that the remorse Draco now felt was real, and that was good enough for Harry. Narcissa swept back in, announcing that they should be heading home. She thanked Harry profusely for the tea, and promised to be in touch regarding both Andromeda and when the two could see Teddy again.
Harry says. Hermione looks pensive, but agrees with him all the same.
Soon, Draco heard Harry’s deep, even breaths that indicated he was far away in dreamland, but Draco was too wound up to sleep. He had never imagined his first kiss would be with anyone he liked so much, and he especially didn’t expect it to be followed up with a night spent in each other’s arms. It was more than he could have hoped for, and his cheeks ached from smiling.
“We did a little bit. Not all the way though, don’t worry.”
Cause what’s inside her never dies
I will not ask and neither should you
Draco didn’t know what to do with this. Harry kept laying himself bare to Draco. First the story about his childhood and now this. Draco didn’t know how to cope with this kind of a relationship; he had never had a friend like this before. He coughed, and ended up saying “she can’t have been good if she didn’t want to look after Teddy” he said, realising how true he felt it to be as the words left his mouth. Harry looked surprised, but then a massive grin split his face, “you are exactly right Draco, but I also can’t blame her. She wanted to live her life, but to me right now Teddy is my life and I love it. It’s like I said before. My life before the war was defeating Voldemort. After the final battle, while everyone else’s lives could begin, with no threats to impede them, mine felt like it was over. Dark lord vanquished; prophesy fulfilled blah blah blah. I didn’t know what to do with myself, but Teddy became my purpose, and I love it.” Draco was astonished at this admission, having never thought about it but he supposed it to be true. Harry’s life had ended during that battle, in more ways than one. Their food arrived, and Draco was pleasantly surprised to see that he really enjoyed what Harry had chosen for him.
He was too stressed to do homework, and so just sat at his desk, staring out the window and wringing his hands for what felt like hours until there was a tentative knock at his door.
Harry called to Draco then went to their room to get ready. He wriggled into the same pair of black jeans as the night before, and slipped the shirt on. He went to button it up and stopped short. “Pansy!” he yelled. “it’s not got bloody buttons!”
Draco awoke at dawn the next day, already brimming with excitement for Harry’s imminent arrival. He wasn’t coming until 11:30, but by 7 am Draco was dressed, fed and ready, and spent many restless hours trying to read or watch tv and not being able to focus on either. His mother teased him mercilessly when he told her who was coming, which made his nerves worse and time move even more slowly.
“nothing’s up, I just like you” Draco whispered, feeling able to speak his feelings now he knew they were reciprocated.
“I’m sure that’s not it” said Draco, almost calling Harry handsome but restraining himself at the last minute. “And Bryn sounds like an arsehole”
“Oh Haz, I didn’t know you had a girlfriend” Cedric said, in a voice a few octaves higher than his normal. Harry grinned internally, it was nice to be wanted, and equally nice to get his revenge on the prick.
He and Sirius drove home to find Draco sitting on the doorstep. Harry stepped out of the car and Draco flung himself at him, wrapping his arms tight around Harry’s middle.
“You wanna talk about it?” Harry asks, standing there.
(Draco, 6:33 am)
They made their way down the stairs and Harry could hear Ron’s loud laugh followed by a “you’re not so bad, Zabini. I see why Harry likes you”
Draco couldn’t help but think he probably looked at Harry like that too, but he laughed nonetheless, which is clearly what Harry was going for, because he was then released from the death-grip hug.
Harry missed Hermione, but that Friday night really cemented his love for Hogwarts. He felt at home there, and he hadn’t felt at home many places in his life. He was itching to see Sirius and tell him all about the team.
“No it isn't pity its-” Harry trailed off, cursing under his breath and sitting up.
“you asked”
The next day, he had been allowed to lie in, and was awoken by Remus standing outside, telling him he could wear his ‘city clothes’ because they were going to the saint Dunstan’s celebrations. He slides on his most casual jeans and a t-shirt with the logo of his school on that he had intended to use as a pyjama t-shirt, but after his visit to the village yesterday he was aware that his normal clothes would still make him look out of place, so he used the least-posh clothes he could find.
“someone Neville has been trying to set me up with for months. I have no romantic interest in him nor him in me and so we settled on a no-strings-attached arrangement. He’s nice, but he’s not you.”
“I guess he must be more like you, though. Your name literally means dragon” Harry says, teasingly.
songs
“And Sirius has forgiven him. Do you think Sirius wants you to hold his grudges for him, or do you think Sirius is actually quite disappointed that you’re acting like a child towards his own family when he raised you to do better?” Hermione scolded and Draco pitied any and all of her future children. She spoke like a seasoned mother already, and she was only twenty.
During their conversations, they also resolved to reach out to Andromeda, find out how she had fared since her excommunication from the Black family tree. It took Sirius a day of wracking his brain, but he remembered the surname of the man she had married, and with a name like Andromeda Tonks it wasn’t hard to find her on facebook. Their friend request was still pending, but they both had hope.
“Don’t think about tha” Harry said, his eyes and voice kind as he looked at Draco.
Harry went to make himself a cup of tea before finishing the epic, and Draco resolved to offer his comfort to the raven on his return. He was beaten, however, when Harry returned arm in arm with Luna. The two got into Harry’s bed, and Draco watched while the two finished the poem, Harry crying again at the return of Patroclus’ ghost in book 23. Draco waited for Luna to leave, but to his dismay she donned one of Harry’s t-shirts as he stripped down to his boxers as he did every night, and the two fell asleep, his dark body curled around her pale one, and Draco tried to ignore the pain in his gut at the sight.
With everyone else massively hungover and not in sole custody of a child, Harry and Teddy had many long hours together. They enjoyed a breakfast of warm milk and Weetabix, and Harry even let Teddy have a few sips of his hot chocolate. After breakfast was tummy time, and Harry thoroughly enjoyed watching Teddy fail to lift his head off the ground. They then watched cartoons for the rest of the morning, and Harry’s hands and chest slowly got coated in a thick layer of baby drool.
“I had a couple of ideas, but a lot of the films I saw looked really sad. I don’t like sad things. I try to avoid sad fiction as much as I can, which rules out La Haine and Entre les Murs” Harry said, and Draco felt a pang at Harry’s stark admission about avoiding sadness.
“yea, yea that’s fine. God I really thought something had happened”
“Malfoy, you weren’t at dinner, so I brought you some food. I hope you’re okay. I’d like to talk to you, if that’s okay”
He opened it to immediately be swept into a bear hug by Harry.
“I’m sorry” Draco said again. What else could he say?
“I don’t think Harry likes me much, or will ever like me much, but that doesn’t change that this is the nicest place I’ve ever been, and that you and Remus are the kindest people I’ve ever met. I really don’t want to go back to my father.”
“she would, she needs family right now.” Replied Harry. He then glanced up at the clock and got up.
“Diggory?” Draco squeaked.
“what’s wrong?”
“that’s awfully kind of you, but I would hate to impose”
If Draco didn’t know better, he would have thought that Harry had spent the last two weeks flirting with him. There were a lot of pet names, ‘sleeping beauty’ if he woke up late, which was happening with increasing frequency, and ‘blondie’ was a particular favourite, which Draco pretended to hate but secretly loved.
Draco was so astounded by the confession that he didn’t have it in him to feel any jealousy at the prospect of Harry and Ron sharing a bed.
“what's dinner then?” Harry asked, hopping back on to Draco’s bed. “from the size of you and your mother, I'm sure I eat double both your portions combined” he said, winking.
A new song came on, and he offered his hand to Pansy with a wink. Blaise danced with Seamus and Dean, who were getting along quite well with the Slytherins.
She kept her smile to herself, aware that her apparent stoic demeanour was an anchor for them all. Once they had all gathered- one group of six and two groups of seven, she called one member of each team forward. Once this was sorted, she surveyed the group once again, and offered up a final prayer that this would work.
I want your love
“Oh my god??” she said, looking at Draco with wide eyes and gesturing into the doorway Harry just disappeared through.
Much to his horror, Draco started to cry even harder, and Harry just stood there, arms wrapped around Draco, cocooning him in warmth and surprisingly nice cologne.
Draco watched in fascination as all the Gryffindor’s sang along, belting the peculiar words at the top of their lungs, swaying together, arms over each other’s shoulders
“a friend” he replies.
Draco was embarrassingly excited to see Harry again. He never put his phone down now, always waiting for a response.
“if you’re interested in the dance, I can teach you, or ask to Bianca to, she taught me when I went to one of Hermione’s family parties” replied Harry.
“Who, Harry?” Draco asked. She nodded and shifted closer to him on the sofa until their hips were aligned and touching. She leant her head on his shoulder and he rested his cheek atop her hair.
Sometime later, he heard the door open and he turned glassy, unfocused eyes towards the intruder, too far gone to care about being seen in this state. To his genuine surprise, it was Lovegood, slowly and softly making her way into the room. She knelt down by his bed, gently taking the bottle from in between his limp fingers. She then rose, and went to fiddle with the black box by the side of Harry’s unmade bed. Draco assumed she would curl up in the raven’s bed in some romantic attempt to replace the body that should have been there, but to his surprise she came back towards him, as music started to fill the air.
“Do you want to tell me about Ron?” Draco asked gently, rubbing his hand up and down her arm. It was weird, doing this comforting thing to someone who wasn't Pansy, but clearly Pans had been good practice, at least Hermione wasn't crying… yet.
Draco nodded again, shouted a hello to Ron and then left.
“Alright Draco? You said this was a house on the phone yesterday. This seems bigger than a castle”
I hate that I owe them for this, now, too. I already owe Potter too much. Right now, he’s too virtuous to cash in on his debts, but one day, fifty years hence when the fame is faded and he’s old and bitter because no one cares about him anymore, he will wish to exact his revenge, which is a thought that keeps me up at night.
“Pansy, I am happy now.” Said Harry firmly. “I have Teddy. I have Ron and Hermione. The Weasley’s are my family now and I see them all the time. I have Andromeda. I have Dean and Seamus and Neville and Luna. I am starting to think I might even have you guys. I am happy. The past is behind me and it is so full of loss and pain and suffering that I cannot dwell on it. I live solely in the present and the future, because there was a time when I thought I had no future, and even a few brief minutes when I was dead, and I had no present. Can you leave the past behind and live in the present with me? Can you do that?” Harry felt Pansy’s body relax somewhat at the words, and he silently cheered. Then he heard shouting from downstairs, Blaise’s distinctly deep voice yelling “they STARVED him but made him cook! And we’ve been making him cook for us this whole time! What the fuck Draco-“ Blaise’s shouts were cut off and Harry relaxed a bit, but then they started up again. “he slept in a CUPBOARD. FOR ELEVEN YEARS. AND WE ALL GAVE HIM SHIT ABOUT IT”
“we’re good, then? This hasn’t changed things?” Harry asked, scared one drunken night would cost one of his dearest friendships.
Hermione and Ron laughed, and Harry draped the snake around his neck before walking on.
“Ah, what a lovely idea. Nicole and Emma will love that!” Harry says and Peterson’s frown deepens. Harry has lunch almost everyday with Peterson and the two secretaries, Nicole and Emma. They all have desks just outside Harry’s spacious office, and he’s told me before how gossiping with Nicky and Emmy- as he affectionately  calls them- is the best part of his day.
“oh.” Exhaled Draco quietly. He straightened up, and reached a shaking hand out to place it on Potter’s chest. He tilted his head up a bit and suddenly Potter’s lips were on his again. Soft, insistent and oh, so much better now he was sober, and fully aware of what was happening. Too soon, Potter was pulling away. “I was sent here to find you and tell you we’re going back now.” He said, a small smile on his face. He took Draco’s hand and pulled him back towards the others.
Somehow though, Harry managed to circle back to Draco just as Draco realised that perhaps he should have slowed down on the drinks four drinks ago, and now only Harry’s arm around his shoulder and Harry’s strong stocky body at his side was keeping Draco standing.
“Draco, just because Ron knows more doesn’t mean that you aren't also there for me, or that I don’t massively appreciate what you do for me” Harry said.
Draco’s insecurities bother Harry somewhat, but only because he knows they are entirely unfounded. Harry can also tell that Draco feels uncomfortable that he developed feelings for Harry long before Harry developed feelings for him. It is what it is though, thinks Harry, smiling at the new pet name before going to collect fresh sheets from the linen cupboard and planning what he will make for his numerous guests that night. Whilst he dresses the bed and dusts and generally makes sure it’s up to scruff for the two very posh and very picky Slytherins that will soon be occupying it, he decides on salmon teriyaki and rice.
“sleep” Potter whispered back, before turning Draco round and wrapping an arm around his middle. When Draco woke up, the arm was still there, Potter’s gentle breaths soft against the back of his nape, and for the first time since fifth year, Draco was looking forward to the day ahead.
“Oh, my god” he said, before turning to Minerva.
He heard a soft intake of breath behind him and assumed Harry must have heard. ‘Serves him right’ Draco thought, finally stepping away from Hermione, allowing her to hug Pansy. Eventually everyone had left, and Harry and Remus were taking the table back inside. Draco and Pansy returned to the cottage and discussed everyone quietly as they got undressed then into pyjamas and climbed into bed.
“Er…” he said again, elegantly. “Come in?” was all he could think of. It wasn’t supposed to sound like a question but oh well.
This year, it would be him, Sirius, Remus and Tonks, and little Teddy. Harry’s new, wonderful family. He was beyond excited. He would miss the Weasley’s, but he was too excited to be with Sirius. They were all going to the Weasley residence for boxing day, though. Harry had to see his found family at least once during the festivities.
His little mental mind-map of the people around him was growing steadily. He felt as if he were surrounded by a mystery, and he was desperate to solve it, both for personal satisfaction but also because he thought that understanding of the little world around him would come hand in hand with his full acceptance into the people around him, who all seemed to know and love each other so richly.
“I know, darling. That’s the point of it” she yelled back, and he was chuckling as Draco walked into the room. In a tennis skirt. Harry’s jaw dropped.
Hermione eventually puts a film on, and Harry loses track of time. The next thing he’s aware of is Pansy making her way down the stairs, still in his t-shirt but with an added pair of tracksuit trousers underneath. Harry and Hermione shift along so she can sit on the other side of Harry.
“Christ, Draco. It's mid-November and you’re only in a t-shirt. Here" was all Draco heard Harry say before Draco was leant against the wall on the other side of him. He drunkenly protested at the loss of Harry’s warmth, and well, Harry, but then something big and soft and warm was being wrestled over his head, and through the drunken haze Draco realised that Harry was dressing Draco in his hoodie.
Harry hadn’t realised how tired he was until he fell into bed, Draco on top of him, snoring softly already.
“Shut up Harry, you know it’s impossible to say no to mum.” Ron groaned. The suit was nice- plain black with a well-tailored jacket. It was only that the shirt was a maroon and green paisley that hurt your eyes if you looked directly at it.
Bruk off yuh back
They lay there for what felt like aeons, just smiling and looking at each other. Zabini and Parkinson were still engaged in heated debate and Ron and Hermione had gone off somewhere, presumably necking in the woods, but Harry felt like he and Malfoy were the only two people in the whole world. Soon though, Malfoy began to shiver, and Harry reluctantly sat up, pulling Malfoy with him.
“come on Malfoy, you’ll catch your death of cold out here, let’s go to the tent” Malfoy stood and stumbled a bit, and the two boys walked unsteadily to their tent, arms around each other for support. Harry fumbled around in the dark, grateful that he had had the foresight earlier to set his pyjamas out on his sleeping bag. He shuffled out of his sweaty tracksuits and into his thick plaid pyjama trousers, and shucked off his t shirt, exchanging it for a clean one and then putting Dudley’s fleece back on. He then slid into his sleeping bag and got comfortable, watching Malfoy have considerably less luck getting changed.
Draco stumbled, foot slipping on a loose rock that he hadn’t seen, and he was caught again by none other than Potter, who gently propped him up, and then, as if sensing the exhaustion that permeated Draco’s very bones, murmured “it’s not long now, Malfoy, and then you can rest until tomorrow”
“I know this is weird but can we hang around here, just until they’ve buried him? I want to make sure he’s really gone.” Harry said.
“It wasn’t anyone at Hogwarts” Blaise says, with a debonair drawl.
He dropped his bag on one of the sofas, extracting from it the fancy Whittard hot chocolate his mother always bought him, and a mug he had been given as a joke from Greg, on which was written ‘the princess has arrived’.
“Alright sleeping beauty?” he said, winking, and running his hand through Draco’s bed hair. Draco let out a shuddering sigh at the gentle touch that he desperately hoped Harry would assume was because he was out of breath.
“My dad hates me. Hates that I’m gay. Sirius is the first man in my family to ever care for me, or make me feel wanted.” Draco murmured quietly, watching Harry’s eyes widen in shock from beneath lowered, heavy eyelids.
Ron and Hermione helped, of course. They had helped him fix up the ancient house of Black, putting in a nursery and tidying up the garden. The three of them had put all the heirlooms and old furniture in the attic and on the fourth floor, sealing the top of the house off. From the third floor down Grimmauld was near unrecognisable. It was the epitome of modernity and had everything a child could wish for, at Harry’s insistence. He was adamant that Teddy have all he had lacked as a child. The kitchen was large but cosy, as it was slightly subterranean. They had decked it out with light wood and dark granite, and in a typical display of whimsy, Luna and Molly Weasley had bedecked the kitchen in homemade bunting. The living room was bright, with a muggle telly, and a host of plush sofas and armchairs. The floor was currently scattered with toys Harry had not had the energy to put away earlier. The entrance was light and inviting, Walburga replaced with countless photos, muggle and wizard alike of all those Harry loved and believed Teddy would need to see every day. Harry and Teddy’s parents, Sirius and Lupin, the Weasleys, Luna, many photos of the golden trio, often with Neville in tow, face obscured by a large plant, that had been taken over the summer after the war. Photography had become Harry’s new thing. He was so scared of losing any more people, and he learned to cope by taking as many photos as he possibly could, so should the worst happen and yet another of his loved ones died, he would have so many versions of them on film he would never truly leave him. While the others found this somewhat sinister and paranoid, they all indulged him, and he had been gifted more cameras than he knew what to do with on his 18th birthday after the war. Teddy was in many of these too. Him with Tonks and Remus, him with Harry. Him being held by nearly everyone Harry had ever met. Teddy barely had object permanence, but his bedroom walls were covered with photos of him with the minister for magic, the headmistress of Hogwarts, the head of the Wizengamot, the list goes on.
“i suppose” Draco said haltingly. “I sometimes feel like it means I can't give someone something important”
I look too good to be alone
“Harry James Potter. Telling someone you have been told to apologise to them is possibly the worst way to apologise, and what have you done since then? You’ve ignored him, and then gotten angry when I choose to spend time with him. Do better”
I made it as gentle as I could, and he nodded gracefully, and said “of course”, before turning round and we walked back to our flat in silence.
He hoped it was enough. He hoped it wouldn’t scare Draco off, or remind Draco how different their lives were. Draco grew up in a sprawling country side estate with hunting and ascot. Harry grew up in a cupboard.
All through the day, Draco worried about how Harry was doing. He desperately hoped he didn’t have a run in with his aunt or cousin. He kept checking his phone under the table in lessons to see if Harry had texted but he never did, beyond one text to confirm he and Ron had reached London. Then again, Draco supposed it was awfully bad form to be on one’s phone during a funeral, but he hadn't expected Harry to stay for the whole thing.
Immediately all eyes were on Harry and Bianca in the middle of the floor. Harry positioned himself behind her, broad hands on her waist as she bent down and began to roll her hips suggestively intime to the music. Harry did the same, their hips grinding in unison as they danced.
“What did you need me for?” Sirius asked, and Draco was glad for the change in subject.
He must have finally fallen asleep, because he woke again in the middle of the night, ensconced in the warmth of Harry’s arms around him. He started grinning uncontrollably again, and turned in Harry’s embrace so he was facing him. He ran his hands up Harry’s arms, over his shoulders, down his chest. He pressed little kisses to Harry’s cheeks and nose, giggling quietly in the darkness, too overwhelmed by the fact that Harry wanted him.
At the end of the conversation, Harry said “i love you Sirius, see you later, yeah” and Draco wondered if he had ever told Lucius he loved him, or if Lucius had ever said the same to Draco.
Ah, but I’m singing like a bird ‘bout it now
Shit, she’d noticed. God, it keeps getting worse. He forced himself to go down for breakfast, and breathed a sigh of relief that Harry and Ron were there without their female counterparts.
“what are you thinking?” asked Harry, voice hoarse and scratchy as he took Draco’s hands in his. Draco took a few deep, raggedy breaths, before saying, “I think,” he said in a thin, weak voice before clearing his throat and starting again, “I think I want to show Pansy.”
Draco heard Theo groan from beside him, and he looked to the stage, where two boys were making their way up the stairs on one side. One was… very ginger. Very ginger, very tall and very freckly. Despite all this, he still managed to be attractive, a fact Draco found very upsetting. The ginger had nothing on the second boy, however.
“no, Ron it’s okay. I need you to do something for me. Can you tell Draco? Explain it all to him. He needs to know, but I cant- I cant say it. I just cant. Tell him all of it, yeah? Even what you didn’t tell Hermione. You can explain the rest to Hermione now as well.”
“no, but I knew Hermione had been up to something last night. She must have had a tip off from Lavender, who works as the Prophets magical creature liaison” he says, before kissing me much like he did the first time, close mouthed and sweet.
“He’s helping mam. He’s the only man in our family with any skill in t’kitchen” Bill said, and Charlie chimed in after, saying “There’s a little party in the village tomorrow for Saint Dunstan’s day, and mam bakes the cakes for it every year, and Ron has helped since he was tall enough to see over the kitchen counter”
The two hags have taken it upon themselves to create ‘interhouse unity’, coming up with plans to lift our spirits. Ugh, how gauche. What’s worse, is that I must attend all these little soirees. As the closest thing to a war criminal, I must show the most willing, or so Pansy says. She's just too busy pining over Blaise and needs me there at all times as a constant buffer whilst he talks about, well, not her. He even waxed poetic about Granger, once. Pansy cried so hard even I felt sympathetic. Like a fool, Pansy laid claim to Theo in third year, and now he’s off gallivanting in France and she’s stuck with a boy to whom she could be invisible, for all he notices her.
“shut the fuck up Parkinson” Harry muttered.
Ron and Hermione stood in the corner with Teddy, looking confused and massively out of their depth. Perceptive as ever, Pansy walked over and carefully scooped Teddy into her arms, cooing over him for a bit before looking at the two Gryffindors standing before her.
“that’s because I love her. Maybe you’ve not been spending enough time with Hermione” Harry replied and Draco’s brain short circuited. This entire situation had been like a rollercoaster- throwing him for many loops.
“Let me, let me” Harry says, hushed in the cavernous office. I hold my hand and the ring out to him and he slides it onto the ring finger of my left hand. It fits perfectly.
Don’t say that
What’s worse, is they were about to increase in number. Draco sat next to Theo in assembly on the first day of year twelve, dreading the year ahead and the upcoming announcement even more. Their wizened old Headmaster stood at the centre of the raised stage in the Main Hall, named after one of the school’s more illustrious alumni, some poet or something. He had been droning on all morning, and Draco was able to tune it out, until the fateful words were spoken:
“Yeah, it is,” Draco whispered back, his fingers drawing shapes onto her t-shirt above where her belly-button was.
Then the hand moved to his lower back. He turned to Harry bewildered at the intimacy-the possession- of such a touch, but Harry just smiled softly at him and said
Harry could hear the tell-tale wobble in her voice that meant Pansy was crying. He wrapped an arm around Draco and rolled his body over, so he was now in the middle, and turned to Pansy, gathering her small form in his arms.
“you take teddy into the sitting room, Andy. I will help dear Harry with the dishes.” Narcissa said, standing and shooing Andromeda out of the room with the baby in her arms. She turned to Harry, hesitantly. “Harry, I wanted to ask you. Andromeda has offered for me to move in with her. The Manor holds so many awful memories, and Andromeda’s small townhouse is quite quaint, with enough space for the two of us. Therein lies the problem though, as much as I am eager to accept, I cannot leave Draco in that cesspit alone, But Andy’s house only has two bedrooms. I was hoping, if it is not too much of an imposition, if you would perhaps allow Draco to stay with you, just until he finds a place of his own?” she looked at Harry imploringly. “if he doesn’t mind living with a baby under one, I don’t see why he cannot stay here. Merlin knows I have the space. I’ll get Ron to help me set up one of the spare bedrooms tomorrow. When would he be coming?” Narcissa sighed in relief, then fiddled with her hands, not looking at Harry. “he doesn’t, he doesn’t know yet. I asked him not to come, so I could talk to you about this first. He is awfully affected by the war, and holds a lot of guilt. He would have outright refused if I had suggested this to him. You would have to offer before he would even consider it.” She said. “I understand” said Harry warmly. “if you come up to my study, we can draft a letter to him.” She smiled at him, and Harry saw the women she could have been had she not been forced into marriage with Lucius, and followed down his hellish path at his side. Her eyes sparkled and she almost glowed with muted happiness. The final letter, after much deliberation from Narcissa and many spelling mistakes from Harry read:
They were back at the house soon, and Draco walked into the kitchen to see Harry, Ron and Sirius devouring scones like starving men.
Helplessness in the face of death, and loss and mourning is a world away from the helplessness he feels now, knowing Draco is in the same home as him, and yet Harry feels entirely unable to go to him. It is easier, though. At least Harry knows that even if Draco never wants to see him again, he will still be alive. None of the others are alive.
Eventually she emerged, and she looked lovely. Her sleek bob was pinned back on one side with golden kirby grips, and her dress was a long floaty affair. It was a pure white with broderie anglaise, and she looked a little bit like an angel.
Hot and fast and angry as she can be
“Andi replied to me” Sirius said, turning his face skywards to look up at Remus. A single tear wended its way down his cheek. Remus looked down with the softest expression Draco had ever seen.
Luckily Harry had an abundance of athletic wear, saving him from the nightmares of transfiguration. After the war, he had turned to intense, near-harmful physical exercise to work through all the trauma; punishing, twenty mile runs, flying for hours on end, spending hours in the night when he was woken by nightmares doing push ups and sit ups and all sorts, desperately hoping that he could tire his body out enough to sleep. It had been Hermione’s suggestion initially, he supposed because exercise had seemed the healthiest coping mechanism she could get him to engage in. Luckily back at Hogwarts he had schoolwork to keep him occupied, but he still ran around the grounds every morning to release steam, with Ron sometimes joining him. Harry and Dean had taught many of the other’s football, to try and introduce some fun to a summer that was overhung with grief and mourning.
“then you must understand that your current actions do not merit you being good, either.” He looked confused at this, and more than a little hurt too. “look at it this way, Potter. Because you think you are a Good Person, you don’t act like one. You believe that by virtue of you being Good, everything you do it good, and that is complete bollocks, if you pardon my language. Take me, before the war. You thought that I was a Bad Person, thoroughly and completely, and so nothing I did to you was ever good. I was saturated with bad-ness, when in fact that isn’t true. I was awful back then, but I was capable of goodness and kindness despite this.I let Pansy sleep in my bed with me when her fifth-year boyfriend called her ugly so she wouldn’t feel so alone. I always shared the sweets my mother sent me with Blaise because his mother often forgot to write him. I did Crabbe and Goyle’s homework for them when they couldn’t understand. Those were good actions, done by a bad person. What you’re doing now are bad actions, but you can’t recognise that, because you are so unflinchingly good.”
Ron snuck into his tent and brought out a bottle of Ogdens, opening it with zeal and taking a hefty swig before handing it to Hermione, sat next to him. She drank from the bottle more primly, and passed it to Harry, who drank deep. His new bulky physique had led to a surprising tolerance for alcohol. He passed the bottle to Malfoy, who sat on his other side, and the boy also drank deep, a bit too deep perhaps, given how thin he was. They spent the next hour like that, passing the bottle round. They chatted, or rather five of them chatted and Malfoy stared pensively into the fire, his hair falling around his pale face flushed rose with alcohol.
“Uh, yeah” Harry said.
“it’s fine Ron, he’s grown, and so have I. I didn’t kill Voldemort (and be killed, he thought to himself) just to come back to school and continue petty rivalries.” He took a deep breath, entered the room and leaned heavily on the closed door behind him, eyes closed, fatigue hitting him like a freight train.
Though not entirely sure why, Draco soon found tears meandering down his face like warm caresses, as Harry sang unrelentingly, unaware of the effect he was having.
“I pretended to throw up in the toilet and said I had norovirus so the school called my mum to come at get me. She's here somewhere, she wanted to see you too. All I told her was that your uncle died, I hope that’s okay.”
