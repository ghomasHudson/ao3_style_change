Malfoy half turns so he can get to Harry’s mouth with his own. In the glancing light of the moon through the window, Harry can see that Malfoy has his eyes shut tight. Across the room, Ron’s breathing catches and quiets into a soft sigh.
“At least he waited until now. For Scorp's sake, I mean.” Pansy was speaking into her martini glass, mouth half-preoccupied by an olive, carefully careless, as though Harry didn’t know that she was probably the only person as pissed off about the whole space thing as he was.
“Draco,” Harry said in a thin quiet voice. “Draco, I need you now.” He looked exhausted, Draco thought, eyes tight with tiredness even as they fluttered shut when Draco leaned in to take his mouth.
Harry knows that Draco understands just how much someone with a broken heart can bear, so he doesn’t need to say anything, but he keeps working on Draco's ribs with a gentle
“Are you going to go?” Malfoy asked, finally, and the regret in his voice was so clear that Harry could have cried, but instead he just shook his head and kissed Malfoy on his trembling sulky mouth, and Malfoy—real Malfoy—kissed him back.
He was still good at that, being impossibly posh and commanding, Harry thought dimly, looking up at Petunia from the front step. She was so tall. And then she stepped to the side, leaning back against the wall as though she was very tired, and Draco steered Harry past her so fast that it was over before he even had to think about it, and he could breathe again.
He holds out his left arm, fumbles with the sleeve until Harry takes over, pushing the fabric up and up until it bunches hard around the taut bulge of bicep. Malfoy’s arm is clear and unblemished, nothing but the faintest silvering of scar tissue where the Mark had been, and even that’s intersected by something more vivid, more vicious, where Harry’s Sectumsempra has never faded.
His hands were inside Draco’s open shirt now, thumb pressing a nipple to an insistent point, and Draco pushed Harry’s jumper up so he could get at the buttons of his jeans.
“She likes you,” Malfoy said accusingly, like it was all some sort of trick, but his hands were still stroking stroking stroking over the disruption of Harry’s fingers buried deep in Peggy’s fur. Between the two of them, they were sending her to sleep.
Draco takes a sip of his coffee and grimaces. “I think I know the best way of getting rid of it,” he tells Harry, gesturing for the bill. “But we need to get back to London.”
It should have been ridiculous, Harry thought, and maybe if Draco was there and it was anyone else who had died, Harry would have been able to find it silly. Across the room, the curled edges of the curtain fluttered, then sank quietly back to stillness. The old woman’s cries trembled and rose like a song, then died down to a small gurgle of grief. Her tears were real; Harry could see them sliding unchecked down her face. Beside him, Narcissa had a very white handkerchief held to her mouth, and an almost imperceptible shake in her hand.
Draco isn’t wearing his own face either, but Harry would know him anywhere, that nervous energy, the excellent posture, the haughty tilt of his head. Draco's by his side by the time Harry reaches the bar, leaning in to murmur in his ear under cover of the din of the rest of the room.
“I suppose my stone was an off-cut of the original,” Harry says, already moving into an almost-dream, the shadows of the Forbidden Forest moving sinuously across the ceiling of the room. “I wonder why they buried the wand with her, though. It’s so…”
on the small clearing amongst the trees.
Harry moves away from him, just a little bit closer to the other side of their big bed, though he turns on the pillow so he’s watching Draco. His glasses are off, and in the strange spill of winter moonlight, across the stretch of white linen, he’s washed out and colourless, nothing like himself. His mouth is a petulant curl.
Draco should have known this would be a bad idea.
“I could kill them,” he said quietly when Harry came up behind him, hooked his chin over Draco’s shoulder so he could look into the dark space under the stairs. He felt okay about it, with Draco’s body between him and the cupboard.
It was just that Petunia was still there, that was all, standing in the doorway, ribs straining with her rage, the rattle of her outraged breaths keeping Harry at a distance. He remembered how angry she could get.
Andrew, up on the altar and not looking in the least bit cold, is all in robes the colour of a fresh bruise or the thin skin of a plum, which make his eyes look even darker. By the time he says, “He is risen, Alleluia!” and smiles his sudden, lovely smile when everyone echoes the Alleluia back to him, Harry can no longer feel his feet.
“I was surprised,” Draco says. “He’s filled out. And I wasn’t
He nearly makes it all the way to the werewolves, and Draco who’s holding them off—barely, and only because he’s fast and scrappy, not because of any particular skill, and he’s going to get lamped any second, and the werewolves are showing teeth and that really won’t be pretty—but Draco does something complicated with the pool cue which he’s managed to wrest away from the werewolf, and he launches it right at the witch at the bar who’s holding the big knife, and that’s that. The room is seething with tension, rolling off everyone like a wave of breaking chaos, and suddenly everyone is either fighting or running. There’s a sizzle of spellwork in the air, the sick rich burnt-sugar smell of dark curses, and the crunch of glass underfoot, and the sour note of expelled air and resentment that goes along with the wet crack of knuckles on skin.
“Okay,”  Draco said. “That’s good. That’s good, I think. What are you going to do instead?”
mum, she would be the first thing he went looking for, he knew it. Just another reason to be glad that it was Harry—brave Harry, good Harry, unselfish Harry—who had been chosen for this.
“Come on, Potter,” Draco murmured, and Harry could see the wet gleam of his mouth even in the darkness. Harry had leaned forwards, then, pushing down on Draco’s leg, bending himself in half, wanting to be
“Right,” Draco said thoughtfully, and then he walked back towards Harry, and dropped down to a crouch in front of him. He looked at Harry interestedly. “I can see it. It makes a lot of sense, actually. You’ll be a good Auror, Potter.” And that had been that, and Harry hadn’t regretted any of it, not in the two years of training and two years on the beat, and all the exams and bureaucracy. He’d loved it all, right up until the day he had met Draco for lunch and they’d got caught up in a botched robbery attempt and Draco had just been unlucky. In the most profound way, it should have been Harry. He wished it had been.
“Look what I found,” he says fondly. “Dumped on Archway Bridge, can you imagine? They like your desk, Potter.”
He drops the bag, touches the lines of the Hallows instead. “A Peverell?” he asks Draco, and then sees the second crest, the upraised fist clutching a wand. “And a Black?”
Hunger drives them out of the bath eventually, and Draco goes to make the tea while Harry gets into his pyjamas even though it’s only about four o’ clock, but it’s almost dark outside and the snow has started up again.
Across the room, Draco was surrounded by all of Scorpius’s friends, and Dzifa was asking him how long the ascent would take, and then Finbarr got Draco started on how loud the banging was at take-off,
“Buck up, Parkinson,” Ron said briskly, but his hands were gentle when he steered her away from the body, and she went with him willingly enough, which was still a new enough development that Harry was surprised by it, and for one horrible moment looked around to catch Draco’s eye and laugh about it, and then remembered with a sick unsteady feeling that he wouldn’t get to laugh with Draco about anything ever again.
, that it must have been written all over his face, that sort of muscular lean wartime love of his. He had no room for anything else; there was war, but mostly there was Harry, and that was all Draco had room for. Even the Muggles all knew, calling out to Draco to ask him where his boyfriend was whenever Harry was away, or giving him a sly elbow when they watched the press conferences with Harry’s face all over the big screen, open and lit up and transformed.
“Well, don’t then,” Harry whispers back, viciously, and throws his scourer into the sudsy water and storms out, the restless flickering sound of shuffling cards fading behind him.
Dream-Malfoy pulled back, confused, but he was still touching Harry, one hand deep in the curls at the base of Harry’s skull, the anchoring pull of his hand strangely familiar. Dream-Harry, the Harry who seemed to know what this was, tried to chase the kiss, but real-Harry managed to stop himself.
so much?”
“There’s no need,” Draco tells him and finally—
, like you know what I’m talking about. You couldn’t possibly have a clue what it was like.”
jealous in the way he always has been—greedy for the people he loves, never getting quite as much of them as he wants.
But all that came much later.
“It probably won’t work now anyway,” Draco said, looking apologetically at Harry from under his lashes, before taking Harry’s hand just to check that Harry would still let him. “Do you want to try anyway?”
And at least Draco could laugh at that, though it was a thin shaky sound.
The fire spat, little tongues of flame, as Draco threw something into it, and then Harry smelled the over-rich meaty smell of something roasting. Draco swallowed hungrily, though he looked a bit sick, then picked up a tumbler, cut crystal winking in the firelight, firewhiskey smoke rising in plumes, and dashed it into the fire, glass and all.
“Ah,” says Harry.
“She looks—” Draco whispers
Harry dredged up the memory of the dream—and how often over the years had he wished he could forget them all, scrub out all the details of every time dream-Malfoy had smiled at him, or laid a hand upon him so casually that Harry wanted to hit him, or every time dream-Malfoy had said his name (
Draco stooped to pick up the knife as they went, some horrible old thing more like a fancy letter opener than a proper knife, now Harry could see it properly, with the Malfoy crest worked in silver on the black handle.
Draco wants to kiss him.
to be apart. So they—” He gestures at the tomb, gracefully, disparagingly, as though Harry doesn’t know exactly what Draco would do for love, and dying isn’t even close to the worst of it.
to know, either. Before the whole thing happened, Harry would never have imagined losing Draco, not when they were both still so young. Draco always seemed so alive, brimming with a gleeful sort of energy, and it had always made Harry feel hot-blooded and taken over by him. He felt like Draco couldn’t possibly be gone, not really.
“I know,” he answered. “We all could.”
, he mouths at Ginny as he passes, and she grins irreverently at him over the woman’s shoulder, then flicks back her hair and follows the woman, pointing at a scar on her arm that Harry knows for a fact she got coming off her broom too close to the Whomping Willow.
and Draco was at the bar, laughing at something Harry said, and then all of a sudden he got very serious and ran a finger down the bridge of Harry’s nose, almost cross-eyed with the effort of focusing after the fifteen million drinks they’d had. “It’s crooked,” he said sadly, and “I never said sorry, did I?” and “I am, I am sorry,” and Harry waved him off, and told him it was fine. And when Draco was leaning over the bar and shouting out the order for yet another round, he realised it really
In a way, they didn’t feel like dreams at all. Malfoy was always in them, and he always seemed very much himself, with the same handsome crooked smile and strong hands and that arresting silvery hair.
“Yeah, no shit,” Draco said, and pulled the apple from his pocket. It was a beauty; a gleaming globe, skin the unblemished pink of a blush fading into the fizzy green of new leaves. Draco had kept it tucked in the pocket of his jacket all evening, waiting. It was so very fresh, so very much part of this living world.
The screen blinked red around the edges, a countdown, and Draco leaned in even closer and said, “I mean literally. I’m on your side of the planet right now. And I’m coming back down soon, remember. I mean, I have to. But I would anyway. Just hold on for me?”
“Okay,” Harry says. “Okay, that’s a good sign.”
“Do you mean this isn’t bad?” Harry asks, and waits as Draco looks up at him from the cradle of his clutching fingers, face pinched and shocked.
“Was there anyone with her?” Draco's voice is slow, steady, eyes gone North Sea grey, looking past Harry at the rest of the room, but Harry doesn’t need to answer for him to know that Narcissa died alone, and probably not easily or gently, in her cell in Azkaban. Harry’s hand is white under the reflexive press of Draco's fingers.
follow me in. Not if you like your entrails on the inside.”
Draco is silent for a long moment, and Harry can see his throat tensing, Adam’s apple moving as he swallows hard, and then he shakes his hair back off his face so Harry can see he’s smiling.
“It’s done,” Ron told him, and he let the cloth fall with a wet slap into the pitcher. And it
Draco went to the window, felt the pull of the night air. His face was hot, eyes stinging.
“Deal,” Draco said, and then, “Oh shit,” when magic sparked between them. “I think we might have just made some sort of magical covenant.” He looked up at the roof of the Abbey suspiciously, following the graceful upward line of the columns to where they disappeared into the darkness of the vaulted ceiling. “It’s all this ancient community magic. Plays absolute havoc with my casting.”
“Because I wouldn’t mind. If you did want to think about him, you know. I sort of”—he licks his lips hesitantly—“like it.”
“Oh,” Harry said stupidly, into Malfoy’s warm mouth, dismayed. “Oh.”
into being, through the sheer force of wanting it so badly.
“There really should be exceptions to the anti-Apparition thing,” Harry grumbled, and then he caught Draco around the waist and dipped his head for a kiss, then another, a curl of the tongue and his hands tightening against the bottom of Draco’s heaving ribcage.
“And if Hermione wouldn’t totally kill us…”
There are fifteen speeches at the wedding party, Muggle microphone passed from hand to hand, and there are more prayers, this time over the food, though no one seems very devout about any of it. Harry eats salted cod in cream, and Malfoy orders bottle after bottle of Muscat for the table even though he hardly drinks at all usually, and he’s quieter than normal while Ron and Harry talk. By the time the music starts they’re already a bit drunk from wine and sun. Harry hadn’t bothered with a jacket anyway, and Ron opens one button and then another at his throat, and Malfoy’s pale linen suit is soft and crumpled from heat, and he has the beginning of fresh sunburn across his nose.
and Draco was under him, this time in Harry’s bed, his ankle resting on Harry’s shoulder. He was wearing all his rings that time, and they caught the moonlight where his fingers were tensing and releasing in the sheets. Harry was still over him—in him—aching to move, but waiting for that curious flood of fullness in his chest to pass, the one that caught him off-guard so often and left him undefended against that careful, wanting look in Draco’s eyes.
“I think you should go out with me,” Harry said. Which. Well, it wasn’t exactly what he had come up there to say, with the storming and the brandishing of the teacup and all of that, but all Harry could think of was all the dream-Malfoys—the kissing one, and the one who looked like he very much might have just got off a horse before the dream started, and the one who Harry had met in some wild dream woods who had an
, he said gravely, as though there might have been something brutal and awful lurking among the pansies—and Hermione, who bore a long grudge, said unsympathetically, “Oh, do shut up” to Petunia as she ran some diagnostic charms over the lintel of the front door. Ron hovered behind her, glaring, wand out.
“I hate you too,” dream-Malfoy had replied sweetly, and that had been the end of the dream, except when Harry woke up he had felt inexplicably sad, like he was grieving over something.
bow and arrow, and the Malfoy with the full golden beard who Harry had only seen for a brief glimpse but who had told dream-Harry, “I know you prefer me clean-shaven but…” before real-Harry had been woken by his alarm, and before he could tell that dream-Malfoy, “Well, actually…”—and how they all liked Harry so much more than real-Malfoy did, and he was fucking sick of it.
bit, and then he takes the sword and steadies himself, and
Neville was already at the tv cabinet, rifling through the drawers, casting detection spells. Behind him, Luna was methodically patting down all the couch cushions. The tinny blare of the television was unceasing, figures in lycra moving in sync.
to be him, and he knew that Hermione was going to make him come no matter what. But after the meeting he had dragged Draco out into the hall and kissed him quiet again, got him all slow and languid up against the wall, and then he had said, “I’ll go if you come too,” which settled it.
Green Park is freezing, Christmas lights blinking sullenly in the distance that stretches beyond the dark shivering mass of bare tree branches. Harry shifts resentfully from foot to foot, stares at the shifting breadth of Draco's shoulders as he casts
“Do you want to put some music on?” Harry asks, and his voice is slightly blurry with tiredness and the low dirty edge of desire as he shivers into Draco’s touch.
Draco lets him fall silent, because he never makes Harry say these things out loud, and says in his poshest, most carrying voice, “No, this isn’t exactly a
“She’s beautiful,” Harry said, enchanted by her suspicious sideways glare, the raised snaky line of scar tissue over the curve of her snout, her precisely-shorn underbelly with an old surgical mark meandering over the velvet of her flesh. “She’s really perfect, Malfoy.”
“Hey.” Harry was behind him, quiet as a cat in his stockinged feet. “Too soon?” He pressed a hand to Draco’s spine, right between where the wings should be.
“That one’s just an old wives’ tale,” Draco said, chucking a packet of Space Raiders at him, which Harry plucked out of the air casually, gracefully. “And anyway, it’s not like I’m fully… whatever. If you were my mate, you’d know it. Believe me.”
The Healer puts Harry on an anti-nausea infusion, and when it finally kicks in he’s so relieved at not feeling sick anymore that he falls asleep, so he misses it when Draco arrives. Harry wakes, confused and muzzy and finally hungry again, to the sound of Draco’s frantic voice and his fingers laced desperately through Harry’s.
Malfoy, incongruously, in a boat—a tiny thing, hide stretched over wood, the sweet elegant curve of the prow beckoning them forward, behind them nothing but the rocky rise of a small island, ahead of them nothing but sea the same grey as Malfoy’s eyes. Harry in a cream wool jumper the twin of Malfoy’s, both of them with sleeves rolled up against the pull of the oars. Harry leaned forward, and as often happened, dream-Harry took over and let the words come. “Le chéile, mo chuisle,” he told Malfoy, and Malfoy grinned at him, white teeth against skin a darker gold than Harry would have imagined for him, eyes creased against the sun, hair tucked under a flat tweed cap, and what the fuck even
Draco twists impatiently on the bed, the span of his stomach muscles buckling under Harry’s pressing weight.
“You’re the one who said he looked good tonight,” Draco says, and he can’t help himself, he stretches slowly across the space in the bed until he can feel Harry’s heat. “Anyway, I can’t sleep.” He edges nearer still.
“Why didn’t you get that healed?” he asked brusquely, then worried for a moment that he’d shattered the fragile peace. But then Draco had sighed and said, “I didn’t want to be late to the party,” and dropped his hand with a grimace before walking away, and Harry had stared at his back with a sort of uneasy curiosity and thought,
“We are not taking the dog,” Hermione began, and that’s when Harry slipped out into the hall.
“What if I don’t want to come back?” he said, and Harry laughed.
Harry is dry-mouthed, slightly queasy from the night before, bones already heavy with the heat of the day, but Malfoy tweaks the sheet off him and pets his hair sympathetically, and tells him it's nothing some bacon and eggs won't fix, and then presses Harry over onto his side and strokes him until he’s hard, and it's almost too hot with Malfoy behind him breathing unevenly into the back of his neck, and Harry can feel the drumming of his pulse in his temples. He’s not sure he'll be able to come at all, sp when he does it's like a lovely surprise, creeping up on him with a slow uncurling heat from nothing but slow lazy thrusts into the circle of Malfoy's fist.
He had four different sandwiches in his hands when Draco finally came back and hooked his chin over Harry’s shoulder. He smelled of smoke and peppermint and lemony public toilet soap.
Teddy runs a finger over the handle of the sword, pokes at the tip of the arrow-shaped pommel, says quietly, “This is quite cool.”
Harry knows that sometimes Draco goes to the library in Grimmauld so he can talk to the portrait of Narcissa and her sisters that hangs on the gallery wall there. He doesn’t do it often, but sometimes Harry hears the rise and dip of girlish voices over Draco’s low murmur, and afterwards Draco always goes straight to bed, pale and red-eyed and defensive. And Harry remembers Draco in Sixth Year, the long, nervy lines of him, the shadows under his eyes, the way he had forgotten about Quidditch and Harry and everything else he had always cared about. Harry thought that maybe it hadn’t been all
International portkeys are an admin nightmare even for a Senior Auror, especially if there isn’t strictly a case number that they can be signed off against. Also, Draco is pretty sure that the Ministry would make things difficult for him if they knew he was leaving the country before his mother’s body has even been buried. So, in the end, they just go to St Pancras and get the first Eurostar out of London, Draco distracted and too pale, Harry carrying their one small holdall on his lap as Draco rests his head on the window and watches the outside flicker silently past.
The pub is called The Leading Light, though inside it’s dense with noise and grimly lit, like the lamps themselves can’t be bothered to cast their glow beyond themselves. It’s also Muggle, so Harry sheathes his wand, casts a Notice-Me-Not over the holster. He wonders how he’ll even find Draco amongst the heaving throng of bodies, all of them surging and pressing there in the dark, in the malty fug of beer and the hot overripe smell of perfumed bodies.
“Up,” dream-Malfoy said, tapping Harry’s left leg, and then he lifted Harry’s foot and began easing his boot off. The muck and filth of the trenches was getting all over him, over the crisp cream of his uniform trousers, and over those quick clever hands of his that dream-Harry had seen dismantle a .303 like he was born to do it, which he probably was. Harry’s eyes fluttered shut again, and Malfoy moved onto his other foot.
“I read about that one too,” Harry replied, voice rich with suppressed laughter. His fingers stroked more insistently over Draco’s back, lighting up the jut of scapula and the hard swell of trapezius and deltoid, sending filaments of sensation over the rolling ridge of vertabrae. “Do you feel like showing me?”
“Have you heard of the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics?” Harry asked Malfoy cheerfully as he finished filling his cup and nudged the kettle handle around to Malfoy, and then smiled to himself as Malfoy started to laugh.
“I know you were very young.” Harry is careful. He can feel Draco quivering minutely, tiny little shivers, almost imperceptible, through the sole of his foot which is still wedged against Draco’s ribcage. “I know how you feel about it
“You didn’t kill anyone,” he says, and he takes Draco by the arm, just above the fine arching bone of his wrist, his fingers meeting over the blue lace tracery of veins. How many times has he touched Draco here, he wonders, just like this? How many more times will he do it before he stops thinking about it, before it stops feeling important? “You didn’t kill anyone, even if you tried. Maybe you would have, I don’t know. But you didn’t. I would have too, you know. I would have killed people, if I had to.”
Harry crossed the floor so he could be nearer, just like he always did whenever he dreamed, these days. He could hear the noise of hundreds of other men outside, through thin canvas walls, though the night was mercifully quiet otherwise. Dream-Harry was, real-Harry realised, waiting for the desperate scream of shells and the rattle of bullets to start.
He was always doing that, these days. Reaching out for Harry, touching him casually, like he couldn’t really help himself. He didn’t care that Ginny was watching and rolling her eyes, or that Hermione was sighing from the hall doorway and gesturing at them to come on. Harry liked it, liked the feeling that he
weird, to catch Ron Weasley’s eye across the pub and make the drink motion at him, and know what it is he’ll ask for. And it’s weird that Ron Weasley is on track to be Head Auror, and that he’s better at Quidditch now than he ever was at school, and that he makes an excellent roast dinner, and that he has a great set of forearms. And yes, it’s weird that he’s good-looking. But Draco can’t say anything of this to Harry.
But now Malfoy was back in England, and Harry was starting to wonder if he was just using the dreams to try and justify things to himself—if he had taken that same old fucking fascination he’d always had with Malfoy, and turned it on its head, and done something very stupid with it. And he couldn’t even tell Ron about it.
followed. Had
“You should eat,” Harry tells him. “We need to finish it today, if we can. I can already feel—” He pushes away the plate, tightens his grip on the holdall, swallows sickly around the same old feeling from the Forest of Dean; the desperate reek of old canvas, damp undergrowth, cold beans again, Ron slipping away in the night, and nothing but rage left behind.
Draco is at the window, a darker silhouette against the night that shows no lightening signs of dawn. He’s holding the thing that was the Horcrux in one hand, and more worryingly, the Peverell wand in the other.
Every inch of skin had some sort of memory, Harry thought. He had known that body, over years and years, over acres of Quidditch pitches, through blood and sweat and spit and come; he had known him from the inside out, the stretch of him as he opened up, and the sounds he made when he was turned on or fucked out or hungry or sad or angry; he had known that he could never get enough of Draco, and now he really never would, and he couldn’t put the goodbye off any longer.
“You wish,” Draco told him, but pushed the hair back off the delicate swell of Scorpius’ forehead, tucked him in tighter, held him closer. Territorial, the specialist had called it, that need to stake a claim, but Draco hadn’t wanted to tell her that all of that was nothing new. From the moment when they had lifted Scorpius out of Draco and into his arms, he had known with certainty that he could (and would) finally kill if he had to. Scorpius had done for him what even Voldemort had failed to do. Scorpius closed his eyes, fumbled a kiss on the edge of Draco’s mouth.
“You can get it back later,” he told Harry. “After I’ve fucked you. Just stop thinking about it for a while, okay? I want you to come back to me now, all the way back.”
“Yes, darling,” Draco said, because it was okay to say it like
“I don’t want Dudley holding her,” he hisses at Draco after the service, when they’re on the way back to Privet Drive for whatever polite, mournful sort of gathering Dudley has organised. “I don’t want
“Thanks for coming, Harry,” Dudley says awkwardly, and his girlfriend gives Harry a confused smile as they move off. Dudley can barely look him in the eye these days, which is an improvement to the punching, Harry thinks.
Sirius laughs, puts a steadying hand on the wall, the row of house-elf heads staring sightlessly down at him, grotesque. Why haven’t they taken them down yet, Harry wonders.
“I don’t care,” Harry said, and then he stretched gingerly and sat up. “But I do have to go. I need to let them know that she’s agreed to do it.”
Malfoy looked torn between surprise and delight, and he looked down at the dog in his lap.

Pansy is still terrorising the nervous young man who’s standing behind the drinks table, and Ron is talking very earnestly about taxidermy to someone from Vernon’s old company (“It’s all in the eyes, really, that’s what makes them look really lifelike”) while clutching a massive slice of quiche. Hermione is quietly but intently intercepting anyone who looks as though they’re going to come and talk to Harry, and as he smiles at her across the room, he thinks again of Draco talking about how lucky they really are.
The dreams were always the same that year, and they always took place in Hogwarts, maybe because of the old magic leaching from the walls. Malfoy was always Malfoy in them, or some version of him anyway, and Harry was always Harry, but in the dreams everything else was different.
“I’ve told you before, I won’t deal with you when you’re in a mood.” He sounded tired, Harry thought. “Go away and have a walk and come back when you’re ready to go over the Littlegate file properly.”
a lump of frozen dogshit right where Draco was about to perform the ritual.
Harry would go in anyway if Draco needed him, they both know that, but he doesn’t have to, because Draco is out within about three minutes, and even then Harry knows from the smeared teartracks through the grave-dust on his face that he probably could have been out even quicker than that.
Draco's holding a glass so tightly that his wrist trembles, and the skin of his knuckles is split open like an overripe plum. He doesn’t turn to look at Harry, but his shoulders drop a little at the touch of Harry’s hand to his lower back, the tense line of his spine sagging and softening into something less wary.
“Like a mandrake?” Harry says, and his chest shakes from trying not to laugh.
He smiled at Draco, a proper, sweet, substantial thing, and all of a sudden Draco knew what he meant. Because Draco would do the same, of course; if it had been him who was the Master of Death, and if the alternative was losing Harry, he would rip through the Veil and take, take, take Harry back. But then, he had always been selfish like that.
“...lion-taming, no it’s really quite safe when you know how to avoid the teeth,” Harry hears as he walks across the room to the buffet table, which is good work from Ginny, especially when paired with all those pretty freckles and her winsome eyes, though the purse-mouthed woman she’s talking to—from Number Seven, if Harry remembers correctly—is moving backwards slowly, looking alarmed.
“Is all of this your doing?” Harry asks, gesturing surreptitiously at their friends, who are bright and vivid against the backdrop of the horrible beige sitting room, with the couches that Harry was never allowed to sit on, and the big tv in the corner, now silent, and the wall of family photos that Harry isn’t in.
Later that morning, after breakfast, they walked the bounds of the estate. Malfoy was quiet, pale in the wash of early summer sun. Harry knew Malfoy didn’t want Harry to be there with him, back in this place where neither of them could escape exactly who they had been during the war, but he let Harry take his hand anyway, sighing as though he couldn’t help himself.
leave you.”
It wasn’t always like this with them—neither of them had a proper bed, even Harry over at Whitehall just slept in shifts in a shared office, but every so often they found the space to go as slow as they liked. They were so close to the sky up here, suspended out of time. It was hard to remember that they needed to think about anything at all except the deepening burn of muscles as they rocked against each other, and the sweet humidity of their shared breaths when their mouths met.
Thankfully, the mutation seemed to have skipped Scorpius.
and Harry was twenty-two, and feeling a bit less miserable, and he was sitting by the Lake with Hogwarts behind him and the shimmer of a Warming Charm around him. Draco was skimming stones.

, really” —he waggled his eyebrows— “wish you were here.”
Everyone who’s anyone in the Ministry is at the Gala, and all of them notice when Harry arrives forty minutes late, without his bowtie.
He’s smiling and he works hard to keep his voice light, but Draco can hear the thin thread of regret, because Harry still can’t quite work out how Teddy went, so quickly, from being a boy to being a teenager. He worries about Teddy all the time, especially since he started school, and Teddy, who’s been loved all his life and is confident that he always will be, has no compunction about being a little shit to the people who care about him. And Harry cares about him the most.
Harry’s fingers went to the
Over breakfast later that day, he had watched Malfoy across the table, feeling slow and stupid and so tired, not really knowing what he was doing. It wasn’t as though he was going to catch a shadow of dream-Malfoy’s smile on real-Malfoy’s face, after all. But as Malfoy reached for the marmalade, Harry saw the fine bones of his hand shifting and the strong straining line of tendon running tense at the base of his thumb, and he had been reminded of dream-Malfoy gripping the long hilt of his sword with intent.
Harry presses a hand between them, pushes it up under Draco’s t-shirt so he can feel his skin, runs his fingers along the ridge of the scars there.
“Are they real?” he asks Draco, but it’s Hermione who nods, takes his hand in hers.
Malfoy would probably love if Hermione moved out, but he just mentions in a mild tone about how hard she’s been working recently, and when Harry lies back to stare at the sky in a temper, Malfoy efficiently unzips Harry’s jeans and eases himself down into the open V of Harry’s legs. They’re quiet about it, because Hermione’s window is the next one over, and she has an early start the next day. Malfoy’s eyes are bright in the sodium streetlight and he looks blissful with his mouth stuffed full, Harry arching up to meet him, and when Harry comes he feels vaporised, like he’s sizzling off into the stars that he can now see behind his screwed-shut eyelids.
He likes his choice.
“She was family.” Draco shrugs angrily. “But it wouldn’t matter if I loved her or not. This thing can’t be out in the world. My mother wanted it gone.”
“I’m really not,” Draco says. “Not that I’m not constantly surprised that I get to have you. But it’s what you said about trust, I suppose.” He lies back down, pulls Harry with him. “If you’re telling me you’re all in, then I believe you. So I don’t need to be jealous.”
Harry knows it’s done because whatever part of the thing that’s still alive shrieks when the spell hits it, and then there’s nothing but flames and silence. Harry feels exhausted all of a sudden, exhausted and ravenous, like he could eat himself into a stupor. He drops his head to Draco’s shoulder, and their hands, linked around the wand, drop down to the side, leaden and tingling from over-casting. Harry doesn’t think even coming back from the dead was this tiring.
“And definitely Good Queen Bess? Not any of the others? Not that ‘we will fight them on the beaches’ chap? Was he not up for it?”
“We haven’t done the garden yet,” he says, and Draco groans. “And I thought the shed would be a good place for the lab—” but then Draco pulls away and goes to look out the bedroom window at the long back lawn, still almost impenetrable from twenty years of neglect.
easy.
“I got you this,” he says, and places a small box on his own bare stomach. It sits there incongruously, right on the softest part of Harry, covered in slightly threadbare velvet with a tiny jewelled button at the front—antique, obviously, Draco doesn’t even need to ask. It shifts slightly with every softening breath that Harry takes.
She flapped a hand lazily over Draco—over the body—in a shooing motion, and then allowed it to rest, gently, momentarily, on the spot under which Draco’s heart used to beat. “Go on,” she said spitefully for Harry’s benefit, leaning over Draco, whispering in his ear just like she always had. “Don’t hang around for him. He’s done enough damage.”
And as Harry lay in bed worrying about the dream, he remembered how dream-Malfoy had looked then, smiling back at him with something like relief, like Harry smiling at him
“Fair enough.” Draco smiled, the lovely heartbreaking crooked smile of his that Harry knew to touch and taste. “Let’s get out of here,” he said, and kicked the cupboard door shut.
He crosses the sticks on the ground, and sprinkles the salt, and he knows the sword is still as sharp as it was when he used to watch his own father doing this, all those years ago, because he sees the blood welling in his palm before he feels the sting of the cut, and then he clenches his fist and squeezes and blood dapples the ground. Despite themselves, the others have gone quiet.
“They got out of talks three hours ago,” he said. “They’ve agreed to stand with us. No negotiation with terrorists, the PM said, and they’ve promised officially that they’ll recognise Kingsley as the legitimate head of the magical administration.”
“I don’t like it any more than you do!” Draco wishes he sounded less defensive, but he’s exhausted after a long day of trying to be friends with various Weasleys, and he doesn’t have the energy. His eyes feel scratchy, his body strung tight with the strain of the day, quivering with tiredness. He’s too tired to sleep.
For one tiny moment there’s quiet in the chaos, as Draco turns to look at Harry across the stretch of disgusting green carpet; Draco's smile is sweeter than it has any right to be, considering that his teeth are filmed with blood, but at least it’s
“And then your kids will be able to call it up too?” Teddy asks when he’s finished laughing (he hates Lucius about as much as everyone else, though Draco is relieved that he’s not in the least bit scared of him, which is a beautiful thing to see). His face clears then tightens up. He suddenly looks older.
The barman looks relieved to see them leaving, and Harry wonders if it’s just that Draco was bleeding all over his bar, or if he sees something else in them that he doesn’t like, that small kernel of something dangerous and lost that Harry fears is permanent, after everything. The women eye them up slyly as they go, and one winks when she sees their linked fingers, and Draco grins at them with his fierce reddened mouth and sweeps Harry into a few seconds of a waltz just for them, a firm steering hand at Harry’s waist, his bruised elegant hand in Harry’s, their faces very close together. He looks happier, Harry thinks, and before that look can be replaced by something else, Harry hurries him out, hand clasped at the back of Draco's neck like he can’t wait to touch him any longer.
“Well then,” Harry said, and though Draco’s hands were still pulling him close, he was very still. “I suppose we’re sticking around for the same reason.”
Easter has all the best hymns, Draco had said, and now Harry sneaks a look at him as he sings. On Draco’s other side, Sylvia has an arm through his, and they’re singing different parts of the same hymn, each one taking an answering line in a weird little conversational piece that’s making them both grin. Sylvia is louder, but Draco is sweeter and more tuneful, and Harry looks at the words in the hymn sheet and falls for them all over again—the simple melodiousness, the incomprehensible dialogue, the inexplicable inclusion of weird imagery about murderous blots and patient hearts, and Harry wonders, like he always does, if all these hymns are meant to sound like love songs, or if it’s just all
, it said.
But he didn’t know what to do
“She killed him first, or he killed her first, who knows—either way, but the wand is the thing…” His voice drops suddenly in the pull of a new wind across the grass. “She shouldn’t have been able to die. Melanthe Peverell? With Death’s own cloak? No, the wand’s the key here. And it should be in here somewhere.” He grunts, pushing against the edge of the capstone with his shoulder as it gives a little, and once Harry joins him the whole thing shifts with a groan, almost as though it’s relieved to let them in.
Harry had eased the bite after one reckless moment, though he didn’t move away. “I don’t normally do this sort of thing,” he murmured into the thin skin of Draco’s ankle. He felt he had to say it, because things were new between them then, and he was still embarrassed by the ferocity of his strange attraction. He wanted Draco to know that he knew it was weird, this urge he had to
have a head injury at the moment,” Harry whispers, and when Draco shakes in his arms, Harry thinks he might be laughing.
“Did you know,” Draco said without turning, allowing his shoulders to flex a little under Harry’s grounding touch, “some Veela can only see in black and white.”
“I dunno,” Harry said indistinctly, mouth full, eyes bright with mischief. He swallowed, smiled. “It felt like you were mating me pretty hard last night.”
Everyone goes very quiet then, which is a relief, and the Healer draws the curtain around the bed and leaves. Draco puts his head in his hands and says, “You’re such a prick. I thought you might be… I thought it was something bad.”
“I doubt it,” Malfoy said, yawning right in Harry’s face, only partly from real exhaustion after a long week of potions raids. Even six months before it would have made Harry want to punch him right in his stupid open mouth, but they were friends now in that intense way that Aurors often were, after dismal months of forced proximity and dull assignments and partnerships that didn’t seem to make sense at first, until they did. And now, because they were friends, seeing Malfoy yawning just made Harry want to wrap him in a blanket and cook him a nice dinner. Which was, funnily enough, what the most recent dream-Harry had been doing for his dream-Malfoy for weeks now, because the dreams were as vivid as ever and they were no less frequent.
“They didn’t want me to leave,” Harry said, and closed his empty hand into a tight fist, though not before the tremble took root. “They like having me around.”
certainly not coming.”
Though he
He didn’t wait for Ron, who was cheerfully squeezing his own teabag with a small spoon, just took his cup and left, though he didn’t go back to their office. Instead, he slipped out into one of the stupid charmed courtyards the Ministry had shoehorned in around the building, to try to bring the outside in.
“We’ll do it ourselves,” he tells Draco, “I promise, okay? We’ll find it, I swear. And we can go to Az— We can go to see her. I’ve got us on the next boat over. If we leave now we can Floo through to Flamborough Head. You can say goodbye at least.”
And it worked. They came out, the Muggles, travelling in groups at night, and walking the tunnels of the Underground trains, and some of them in boats slipping unobtrusively upriver—just to join up with Harry. Because all of them watching him on their tvs—his big scarred hands, the proud jut of his chin, the careful tension in his shoulders—had seen him for what he really was, and believed him. They were ready to follow him wherever he would lead; Draco knew it, everyone in London knew it, even Voldemort knew it.
. But Draco had just said shakily, “I should hope not, most distracting, here… let me…” and all the while he was skidding unsteadily down the ladder until he was bracketed in Harry’s arms and Harry could press himself against Draco’s back and slip two fingers around his body and into the gap between buttons on his shirt. “You make me feel helpless,” Draco said crossly, breathlessly, arching back further into Harry’s arms, and Harry tightened his hold and bit at Draco’s soft earlobe, at the tender skin of his neck, at the muscle of his shoulder through his t-shirt…
“Men?” Harry asks, thinks about Ron’s generous mouth, the span of his shoulders, the self-conscious flex of bare bicep, those big hands. “He’s relaxed about that stuff. Not
This close, it’s easier, with his face in Harry’s curls—smelling of smoke and sky from the night flight across London—and the long smooth stretch of Harry’s solid flank under his hand.
As Malfoy shifted on the grass, the puppy’s quivering nose slid slowly around his side, and Malfoy dropped his arm back and scooped the dog into his lap.
“I needed her to be impressed,” he said. “I needed her to see me as an equal. Or better, even. She’s already a bit of afraid of me, they all are. But I wanted her to believe in me.”
But not all the Weasleys are kind, nor would Draco expect them to be, not with the constant reminders of their history and the conspicuous Malfoy blond hair across from them at the dinner table. Molly, her mouth set thin, trying to be generous, but still looking at Harry worriedly even now, two years down the line. George, barely civil, often drunk, never really wanting to be at these dinner parties, always looking for something lost; he nearly punched Draco at Harry’s last birthday party, and Draco would have let him. Ginny’s alright—she’s practical, and was always tough, and she wants Harry to be happy. Draco can barely look at Bill even now, and Bill knows it, though he’s always distantly polite. Draco sometimes worries that Harry has forgiven him for everything too easily—forgiven him for who he used to be, for all the things he did. Draco doesn’t want him to do that. He’d rather Harry remembered. But at least the Weasleys haven’t forgotten.
But no, he thinks, in Harry’s dreams Malfoy doesn’t have tired lines around his eyes, and he doesn’t have any scars, especially not so many, flickering in and out of Harry’s vision with every shift of his collar as Malfoy moves restlessly, baring his throat to Harry’s mouth. In Harry’s dreams, Malfoy’s fingers are more sure, more demanding. Dream Malfoy always takes what he wants, but this must be real, because this Malfoy is cautious, waiting for Harry to move again, watching Harry from under his downturned translucent lashes that Harry has never seen this close up.
Because though he really
“I’m quitting the team,” Harry told him, and Draco’s next throw went down with a plop and a ripple.
“I most certainly fucking will not,” Malfoy said, startled into loudness, and then he sat down abruptly, uncertainly.
so happy about it? It’s not like you believe in God, or miracles, or any of that stuff.”
“Yeah, he looked pretty joyful today alright,” Harry says, thinking of Andrew’s cool stare from the pulpit. Harry doesn’t blame him, of course; he’d never had Draco, not properly, but he had
“Not quite,” Malfoy said, and then he stretched self-consciously, rolling his shoulders, and his eyes clouded up for a moment, plum-dark like the London summer dusk. Harry had only seen him flying once but he remembered it—the greedy spreading span of feathers, and the concave arc of Malfoy’s spine as he leaned into the wind, and when he finally took off, the sinuous rolling beat of those wings.
“I can’t believe it’s this easy,” Draco whispers as they stand shoulder to shoulder, looking at the monument, but Harry can
“You’re not going alone.”
“What did you want to talk about?” he asks, and wraps some of Draco’s hair around his fist, tugs lightly. “Or will I just shut up and make you come?”
They kiss until Harry feels like he needs to lie down, and though Draco's hard in his jeans, his hands are shaking too much to undo the buttons of Harry’s shirt. He follows Harry to the bed eagerly though, but Harry just kisses up the inside of his wand arm into the crease of his elbow and then pushes him down, gently, to heal him up.
Harry
“I didn’t like it,” Harry tells him. “I
, and Ron is doing air guitar with one of Dean’s brothers, and the priest, red-faced and jovial, dog collar cutting into his jowls, is dancing a complicated-looking jig with Seamus’s mum.
Harry was exhausted, and it was Monday morning after a long weekend full of bad decisions, and he hadn’t been sleeping well, and the last thing he wanted was to talk about Malfoy.
smile, even if it’s on that stupid borrowed face. “Thank you,” he mouths at Harry, though Harry’s not sure what he’s done to be thankful for, and then Draco twists and lunges upright and makes a break for the edge of the wards.
Later, much later, when Harry was already headachey and mostly-sober, Draco found him outside on the patio, stubbing a cigarette out in the pot of lavender Harry had planted last May, before he’d realised that all this was even a possibility, let alone that Draco had been training for it pretty much since he left school. That Draco was
“Malfoy’s back,” Ron said.
, and he had taken his gear and left without looking back.
“Seamus’s dad is a greyhound trainer and Seamus has two massive rescue greyhounds living in his flat in Shoreditch,” Malfoy said primly. “Seamus is great with dogs. But Peggy is very nervous, especially of men. She’s had a tough time of it. So you have to be careful with her.”
Harry didn’t know what to say, because he could feel the slow familiar bloom of panic deep in his chest, and everything felt too small and dangerous now he was actually here, with the same heavy tick of the kitchen clock, and the fuzzy murmur of the television from the next room, and knowing Petunia was just down the hall. It wasn’t that Harry didn’t feel like he could eat the biscuit. He knew he could. This wasn’t his home any more, and he was here on business, and he didn’t care about the fact that the biscuits were for Dudley. He just didn’t want it, not with this sick curling ribbon of tension spooling through him.
Draco sat next to Harry, split the apple down the middle with his pocketknife, not wanting to taste a Diffindo off it, and picked the small black seeds out of the star of the core for Harry, before taking a bite of his own half. It tasted so very sweet.
“And you’re jealous?” Draco sounds cautious, but his arms tighten around Harry, pulling him closer. Harry thinks he might be getting hard.
Because Harry
“I thought you liked it intense,” Draco says, but his voice is blurred around a yawn, the outbreath of it humid against Harry’s throat.
“Have you ever considered getting an earring?” he asked instead, then pulled Malfoy in so he could take Malfoy’s earlobe in his teeth, curl his tongue over the velvety skin at the hinge of Malfoy’s jawline.
“Theoretically.” Draco is careful. “If I had children, then yes.”
“It can’t hurt to have a woman, either,” is what he said out loud, and it was the right thing to say because Harry brightened right up at that.
after
Without looking back, he calls, “I’m ready”, and hears Marie muttering something unimpressed-sounding to Harry, and Harry laughs again. It’s a big deal that she’s even here with them, but she has a soft spot for Teddy, and he’s about the only person she can never say no to. Also, Draco thinks she’s looking for distractions—she’s scared, because she broke a rib coughing three days ago, and she’s been spending a lot of time with her mum recently too. He closes his eyes for a second and wishes as hard as he can—like he’s been wishing for four years now—that she’ll finally think about going to St Mungos. He and Hermione are so close with the new legislation. He just hopes they’ll be in time for Marie.
“You shouldn’t have come. This is a conflict of interest.”
can’t bring the dead back. Not like I can, anyway.”
, Harry thought. Through the window he could see Dean and Seamus in the back garden. The dog was on its back on the grass, four legs in the air, wriggling with delight as they rubbed its fluffy tummy. Through the open window, Harry could hear the distant hum of a lawnmower. The air felt heavy with summer.
“Right! That’s just what Hermione said. Every Muggle in Britain will know her—if we can get her in front of the cameras, all that red hair, and we even have one of her dresses here in the upstairs exhibition space… I think she just might swing it for us. Even
Draco helpless for him. It was different when it was just them of course, Draco possessive, almost greedy, rougher sometimes (though Harry liked that too), his hand covering first Harry’s mouth, then his own, to muffle the sounds he made when Harry touched him back.
When Draco concentrated, he could feel them there, magically contained under the skin, so close to the surface; the potential quiver of the air under the primary feathers, the almost-uplift, the press and fold of every almost-moving part.
“We should take a trip,” Draco says, like he always does whenever they’re standing on the upper concourse under the delicate metal spines of the curving roof. The glass gleams with snow. “We should go to Paris.”
Teddy looks up at him, eyes bright with fury and something small and hopeful.
His hand isn’t quite shaking when he raises the Peverell wand, but his eyes are wet, and when Harry steps up behind him he looks around wildly as though he’d forgotten Harry was even there.
“How can I forget?” Harry asks him gently. “How could I possibly? I won’t ever. But Draco— don’t you see, none of it is about forgetting? It’s about—”
Malfoy flying high over patchwork fields real-Harry didn’t recognise, leaning low over a clumsy-looking broom, hair sleek and parted down the middle, sporting a thin moustache that was less stupid-looking than it should have been, Harry in the air beside him, both of them swooping into dives and laughing, always laughing.
There’s a brief moment when Harry thinks Draco's going to break something, or someone, but the smile hardly falters.
so Draco can finally sit up properly, and when he does, he takes Harry’s face in his hands and kisses him again, rougher this time.
“I would hate you in any universe, in any lifetime,” he said cheerfully, and Harry would have lost his temper at that, before, but now he noticed the slow pinkening at the base of Malfoy’s throat, and the twitch of his fingers around the mug, and he thought about the latest dream-Malfoy—swaying opposite Harry on some anonymous crowded subway carriage in some anonymous crowded city, with his head shaved to a velvet sheen, his smiling mouth a careful lipsticked red—and Harry wondered.
“Maybe next time,” Harry said, and kissed him. “Maybe next time I’ll let you go on a murderous rampage.”
“You’re late,” Draco said, and reached for the Resurrection Stone. He had to prise Harry’s fingers open ungently to get at it where it lay cool and solid in the crease of Harry’s palm.
to justify how sharp and unexpected and vivid they were, so much so that Harry had told himself they couldn’t all be coming from his own head. They had to be some sort of sign of
“You haven’t changed your mind?” Harry asks, too quickly, but Draco shakes his head, and that’s that.
“I hate to be the one to break it to you” —Draco looks positively gleeful— “but I’m literally looking at a walking miracle right now. You absolute twat.”
, he called him, smiling even over the din of battle, and even real-Harry knew how right the name felt when dream-Malfoy said it like that).
Malfoy considers that for a while, arms crossed firmly over his chest, the curling tail of a scar a distraction above the opened neck of his pyjamas.
“It’s not actually totally dark,” Draco told him absent-mindedly. “Even as far out as we can go, there’s light from other galaxies, maybe? And there’s…” He waved skyward. “I mean. There’s the sun.”
“Malfoy, listen,” Harry says. “You need to keep smiling at me, okay? Just keep dancing and keep smiling for a few minutes, and then we can get out of here.”
“Speaking of forever,” he says, and then he rolls back under Draco just in time to catch him when he drops loose and satiated, shaking with release. Harry has one arm around Draco’s neck, and he’s very pink and pleased-looking, and when Draco stretches out beside him and presses along his side, his arm tightens.
Malfoy was looking at him questioningly, his face very close to Harry’s on the pillow, still creased and pink from sleep.
There was a sheet laid over Draco, one of the papery, crisp, Mungos-issue ones, and it slid to the floor like a fall of water when Harry twitched it away gingerly. Under it, Draco was naked, the rack of his ribs standing out spare and bleached like he was already bone, the soft fall of his cock and the curved musculature of his thighs and the strong lines of his forearms at once horribly familiar and completely foreign. This close, Harry could tell that he smelled faintly of disinfectant, and under that the strange, ozoney scent of long-lasting Stasis charms.  For one desperate moment, Harry wanted to put the sheet back, to tuck Draco in, away from all the eyes. But it wasn’t him there on the table, not really, not anymore. And anyway, Draco probably wouldn’t have minded. He always had been fairly pragmatic.
against his tongue, but it’s just ginger ale, and Draco laughs to himself, looking down at the bar.
He’d kissed Draco’s mouth, right on the curve of his upper lip, then along to the dimpled crease that deepened when he smiled. But it had felt all wrong, of course, too cold and unmoving, and Harry felt weird for having done it, so he picked up Draco’s hand and kissed that instead. The body had been cleaned up, all the blood Scourgified away with hospital-grade spellwork, so there was only the faint medicinal tang of that from Draco’s skin.
“You won’t though.”
“You were summoning him?” Harry asked flatly, feeling the prickle of the chill October wind on the back of his neck.
“You got it? I thought— When I saw you earlier, you seemed… I was sure it was a dead end. I thought you seemed sad.”
for the first time since the curse had hit. And then they dressed him, and they were all crying, even Hermione who hadn’t ever really liked Draco, not even after Harry told her that Draco was
“You’re a real shit sometimes,” Harry told him, watching Draco peer at the surface of the simmering liquid, thinking back to Hogwarts and remembering his own thin, small face in the Mirror of Erised, his dad’s devastating smile reflected back at him from just behind his mirror self’s shoulder, almost real enough to touch. As though Harry hadn’t raised his own dead enough times; as though he wouldn’t have ripped straight through the stupid veil, if it could be done.
Harry sighs, yawns, reaches half-heartedly for Draco, who bats him away and kneels up, already so close that his own hand is enough, feeling the preemptive shiver of exhaustion under the building tension of pleasure that means he’ll be able to sleep, soon.
“I thought,” Draco says breathlessly, “that we could talk about you dressed as a vicar. You know, that long black thing Andrew wears, the one—”
“Is this how you want to do it, then?” Draco asks him wonderingly, and Harry starts to get hard at the thought of how breathless he sounds already, and Draco tells him to wait—bossy-sounding, like he gets sometimes, voice hardened up, brittle with desire, and clinical, as though Harry is a problem he wants to solve—and casts the Oleumenti with the borrowed wand.
“Weasley and I thought that if you were determined to come to this thing, you should have some moral support,” Draco said. “And since all the neighbours already think you’re a criminal, we might as well give them something to talk about. We’re all St Brutus students today.”
Harry wakes to the sound of Seamus's voice from outside the open window. "Grand day for a wedding," he's saying to someone, and he sounds gleeful, and it is, it really is, because when Harry rolls over in the bed and cracks an eye, all he can see through the gap in the curtain is a vivid opening blue, like the summer sky might go on forever.
But anyway, real-Malfoy was nothing like this dream-Malfoy, who was pink-cheeked from heat and booze, with his hair pushed back and curling behind his ears, and wearing some sort of flouncy linen shirt with a froth of frills spilling down from the base of his throat. It rather suited him, Harry had been thinking, and then dream-Malfoy was moving towards him, still talking about whatever he had been talking about when the dream started. His fingertips were black with ink. The loose cuffs of his shirtsleeves slipped further up his arm as he gesticulated—no Mark, Harry thought absently, because he never had the Mark in Harry’s dreams, and he wondered what
“Malfoy,” Harry said again, and Malfoy sighed and stood up.
“The bar is shut to non-residents, I’m afraid,” the receptionist tells them with what feels like genuine sympathy.
“Can we keep them?” Draco asks, and Hermione says, “I was looking for a crup— I thought, for Harry, you know? But a cat would be just as good, really.”
“They can try,” Malfoy sounded pleased, like Harry was telling him the punchline of some private joke, and that was all it took, that sly shared smile that had Harry wanting like he didn’t think he’d ever wanted before.
“Potter.”
Harry’s voice was muffled through his hands. “Oh, Draco,” he said, and at whatever was in his voice, Draco began to stroke down the cool skin at the back of Harry’s neck, then up into his hair, tugging the curls between his fingers, smoothing, soothing.
“Luckily for you, I was there to cover when your Apparition jump was flagged. I told Robards it was an evidence check for the Brindlefair case.”
Harry made him leave the curtains open, and when Draco tried to kiss him he turned his face spitefully towards the window at first, staring out, but when Draco pressed into him with a low quiet lonely sound, Harry turned his face back so he could capture the noise and feel of Draco over him in the night.
to be dreaming dreams about stupid bloody Malfoy, for fuck’s sake. But the dreams were relentless nonetheless.
Then Harry wakes, and Malfoy is still there beside him, but there’s no travelling cloak, just a cool moonlit expanse of bare skin, and wary wakefulness.
“Don’t you dare come in here,” she said, pointing at Harry, hand upraised, and he couldn’t help it; he flinched. Draco was behind him suddenly, a solid heat at his back, and then Harry felt his steadying hand at the base of Harry’s spine.
house. In some ways, Draco looked just like he always had, because he was still handsome and severe, with that thin crooked mouth of his that Harry had liked—so much!—to kiss.
“Did you wear this on purpose?”
When Draco opens the door to the cupboard under the stairs, Harry doesn’t need to look inside. He knows it’s just a cupboard.
His hand caught Draco’s where it was tangled up in cotton, big palm already warmed up a bit, and shook.
Under the crown of leaves he wore, his face was pale, concerned, focused, shadows under his eyes the same rich purple of the dying edges of sky. Harry wondered if he had slept at all the night before, remembered the restless energy of him in their bed, something strung taut in him when he’d reached for Harry just as the chill trickle of October dawn crept sluggishly through the crack in their curtains.
“When I’m there,” he said, and Draco gasped as his cool fingers flickered along Draco’s shirt, a fast unbuttoning, “and I can hear the whispers—they all know who my parents are, you know, it’s the Potters this and the Potters that—I think you’re the only thing that keeps me coming back.”
“Well, why don’t you just go, then?”
In fact, he had tried it after they brought the body back from the hospital, and everyone had tactfully left to give Harry time alone to say his goodbyes, or some other awful idea that made no sense at all. Because when Harry thought about it, it seemed impossible that anyone would expect him to wrap up everything that had happened into some kind of farewell.
“We can double-barrel,” he says, and then they’re kissing carefully, and Draco has Harry’s face in his hands, and his heart feels very full. In the moon’s clean winter light Draco’s ring is bright and obtrusive, the weight of five hundred years of intention sitting lightly on his left hand.
, and being here with Draco, and watching the languid shadow of fresh snow clouds passing over his uptilted face through the glass of the dome while he sings, “look up, and trust, and live.” It’s
“It’s very plain,” Harry says, frowning, and Draco laughs shakily. “There was another, with a sapphire… anyway, Fand said… But, you will, won’t you? Marry me?”
From down the hall, Harry heard a distant chime, as his wayward kitchen clock defiantly struck the hour. Dinner time, he thought, and then he let himself think of Draco lazily shaking a frying pan, smiling at Harry across the kitchen, and he cried again.
Harry was doing fine up until he took a right onto Gillygate, but then the traffic thinned and road signs started to flicker past too fast, and in the seat beside him Draco was already leaning against the window with his eyes closed, and Harry nearly missed the next turn while sneaking a look at the clean curve of Draco’s Adam’s apple.
“You should sleep, Potter. It’s almost time.”
“I’m not going to kiss you,” he told dream-Malfoy meanly, and dream-Malfoy’s mouth curled up in challenge, like Harry was amusing him, and his hand tightened in Harry’s hair, and rather than lean back in Harry tried to will himself out of the dream, hurtling towards wakefulness with a speed borne entirely of resentment, until he woke panting and pissed off and turned on in his own bed in Grimmauld.
Around them a crowd has formed, and everyone is oohing and aahing, and the wyvern hovers steadily, batting its wings playfully until Draco’s hair whips around his face. Then it drops gently, its unearthly white hide incongruous against the grass, and Draco gets to pet it a bit, as it knocks at him blindly and devotedly with its enormous snout. It even holds still long enough for Teddy to have a quick stroke, though once it starts getting restless again Draco gives it a farewell pat and quickly kicks the sticks out of alignment, and when he takes the sword up again the wyvern sails into a swooping arc and disappears.
“I like you best like this,” Harry tells him seriously, and Draco takes a shaky breath.
“And I can’t break this,” Harry said, stretching out to where the Elder Wand still lay, rolling the wood under his fingers. “I need it. Even if we decide not to bring Elizabeth back, I have to keep it until the war is over. Just in case. People die in wars, you know. I might need to go and get certain people back, if it comes down to that.”
“So you’re basically a dragon king?” Even though this whole thing was Teddy’s idea, he’s not helping with any of the preparations. He also looks deeply unimpressed, though that’s sort of just his face these days.
“He looks like a Kyon to me,” Luna said mildly, and Dudley interjected from the corner, “She’s a she, not a he,” though he fell silent after a withering look from Hermione.
“If it’s any consolation, you
The music starts to climb, the rhythm frenetic,
The Healer says, “Mr Potter, you’re pregnant,” and at what she must see in Harry’s face, “I take it this comes as a surprise?” And Harry barely makes it to the sink before he’s sick again, only this time the shivers start, and he hadn’t known this was even a
“Wonder of wonders, oh how can it be?” he sings, and it sounds like an old music hall number, but then Draco follows it jauntily with, “Jesus the Crucified pleads for me!” and Harry recognises it from church earlier.
“Anyway, I'm not going to die,” Draco said, which for all he knew was going to end up being a lie, even if not a permanent one. People
Draco laughs. “As if I’m going to tell you,” he says, hissing as Harry pats along his ribcage to check what’s under the black bruising there. “I know that look. Put it this way, if you think I’m in a bad state, you should see him. And what’s a bit of Crucio among informers?” He pauses on a swallow, looks past Harry out at the big curtainless window, at the diffuse glow of not-stars. “Anyway. I got it. Or at least… he told me where I can find it. After I managed to... persuade him.”
“I should do it.” Draco licks his lips, sick-looking. “You’ll only mess it up.”
liking it, and I feel…”
When Draco's Owl arrives, Harry is at dinner at the Burrow, but Draco's handwriting is shaky, and there’s what looks like a smudged fingerprint in blood on the parchment, so Harry pushes his plate away, suddenly queasy, and Molly reaches out for him, looking alarmed at whatever she sees in his face.
“Fuck you,” Draco says tiredly, and then shakes his head, presses the heels of his hands into his eyes. “This is just the Horcrux talking, you know. The sooner we get rid of it…”
do this.
Draco says, “What about yellow? A proper yellow, like the window panel in that gallery in Rome, remember?” and he’s off down the paint aisle of the big B&Q in Peckham.
each other,  I mean. To
that Hermione is leaving, he tells Malfoy later when they’re both sitting on the flat bit of roof just under Harry’s—
you. We chose this, together. I want it, I want it all. Can you see that?”
“My hero,” Harry said, and he finally—finally—holstered the Elder Wand, and Draco could breathe properly again. “Want some?”
“I have to head over to Whitehall in a minute,” Harry said, sounding sad and scooped out. “Hermione will want a rundown, and I need to eat something, I think.”
He’s still holding Malfoy’s arm, which is blissfully warm and solid under his fingers, and Malfoy looks at him like something has shifted, gone awry, and then licks his lips. He’s blushing.
until we try it, I suppose. But if you’re asking if she’s going to be some sort of shuffling undead zombie type, well. I don’t think so? It’s not like we’re doing necromancy here. Her body can stay right where it is, thanks. I’m just bringing her essence back, giving it some sort of… form, I suppose? Her afterlife form is pretty hot, actually. I do like a redhead.”
“Mmmm,” Draco says disapprovingly, but Harry sees his eyes flicker, and remembers that he lost his mother too.
“No,” Draco answered, body tensing, though he put his free hand over Harry’s where it rested against his stomach. “I mean, I
“Was he really here?” Harry asks, frantic with it, again and again, and Draco rolls him over, presses him into the bed, strokes him quiet.
“I’m in you,” he said, and for the first time that night his eyes were bright, focused. “I can’t get any deeper. You’ve taken all of me.” Because he said things like that sometimes, voice low and filthy-sounding on the edge of a groan, like he was making sure.
“You hate this though,” Draco says, twisting his arm upwards so the Mark is on show. His skin is still pinked up and plump from the hot bath, and the Mark is just a darker stain, nothing much anymore, its edges furred and indistinct, faded to a dull pink.
“But,” Draco said quietly, “if you like, I can mind it for you. And you can have it at home with a cup of tea.”
The sight of Draco falling had been suddenly and horribly familiar, as had the unfurling ribbons of blood. Through it all, Harry had been able to keep his head and get that shitty excuse for a criminal into a proper Bind. It had only taken him about twenty seconds to get it all under control, but he had still been too slow. He thought about it so much that he wondered if he was going to go mad from it. Because after all, he had done everything he’d been trained to do—secured the suspect, called in the duty Aurors, summoned the field Healer—but he was still too late to save Draco.
“And with that touching declaration, I have finally reached the end of my tether,” Ron says from behind them, and Draco goes to shoulder him but remembers the baby at the last minute and glares instead. “And these sandwiches are shit, mate. Can we choose to love you somewhere else?”
And of course it was his father, Harry thought. Lucius Malfoy, off in Azkaban, no one ever mentioning him except Draco calling out for him in his nightmares, the same every time, a murmured frantic litany of “Father!”, and “please.” And then Lucius prison-sick, disdainful and distant even as he watched his son so hungrily on that last, awful visit. And at the very end, in St Mungo’s, an inconveniently early death, slipping away quietly while holding Draco’s hand, just enough tenderness left in him to make sure that Draco would miss him forever, and would be eaten up with guilt.
“There’s a new packet of Toffypops in the top cupboard,” Harry tells him, and makes his escape with the pot of tea before Draco can complain too much, though the sound of Draco muttering “I can get those in Sainsbury’s anytime, I wanted Cocoa Glaciers,” follows him up the stairs.
“We can go to Paris, you know,” Harry tells him. “We can go any time. I bet everyone in France drinks fancy red wine in the bath. We’d fit right in.”
But that was all long ago, and now Draco’s cold body was in Harry’s house, the house that had been
“All the Weasleys are good-looking,” Harry says solemnly, and Draco knows it’s true (and he’s seen how Harry keeps a careful distance from Charlie, not that Draco would mind. Harry is an all-or-nothing type, and Draco’s had all of him for a long time now).
“Sometimes I think about you kissing him,” Harry says roughly. “I think about him touching you, and it makes me want to… it drives me crazy, I just want to—” He presses a kiss into the hollow of Draco’s throat, curls his fingers around Draco’s ribcage possessively so he can feel Draco’s unsteady breathing. “I want to keep you to myself.”
“Yes,” Draco said, “please, yes. And yes, break the wand. It’s not good—” a pause for him to muffle a sigh against Harry’s shoulder at the slow push of Harry’s finger “—to have that sort of power. We weren’t meant for it.” And he did sigh then, a long slow juddering exhale as he moved back to meet Harry’s hand.
“I knew you were busy this evening.” Draco's voice sounds rusty, congested. “I got a tip… there was a man… Well, I couldn’t risk waiting in case I missed him.”
It’s the middle of the night by the time they get to bed, though Draco can hear the distant sound of someone drunkenly singing Christmas carols in the street outside. Harry must have left the window up.
From behind them, Draco can hear Harry laughing, and he doesn’t realise he’s smiling at the sound of it until he sees Teddy rolling his eyes. Below them, far in the distance, the long fingers of skyscrapers reach for the lowering clouds. The view is slightly warped, like they’re looking through a dirty window, but it’s only the veil of warding spells protecting the wizarding space that’s been at the top of the hill since the Bronze Age.
Draco really hadn’t wanted to die.
“Lovely,” he says drily. “That’s a nice cheerful one.” Draco just eyes him unrepentantly and takes two Toffypops before curling up on the other end of the couch.
Dream-Harry stumbled on his way to the stool, and Malfoy’s steadying hand was at his elbow, an anchor. Outside, there was a loud crash, then laughter. Both Harry and Malfoy jumped.
Harry knows he can’t be dreaming because he knows his own brain could never recreate Sirius so accurately, so cruelly. Nearly all the lights are off, and Harry tries to cast a Lumos, but he must have left his wand somewhere, and then Malfoy is beside him, sleek as a seal in his best travelling cloak, eyeing Sirius warily. Malfoy never drinks, doesn’t trust the letting go.
“Am I your mate, then?” Harry asked from where he was lying on Draco’s couch, with the big window open all the way so that Draco could feel the beckoning call of the summer evening sky.
“Any word from the PM?” Harry asked tiredly, and at least Draco had good news for him, finally.
is between them. He shuts his eyes and thinks about cutting Draco open in the bathroom, wonders if he should tell Draco that he’s happy he left scars. They don’t speak the whole way back to London.
He couldn’t stop thinking about the last time Draco had been alive. He’d been there when Draco died, holding his hand so hard that he left  bruises across those elegant pale knobs of knuckles, and when the Healers had tried to take Draco away and do whatever it was that they do in these cases, Harry had screamed his throat raw and held on to the body (the agonising taunt of the lingering warmth of it) and they had just let him be, in the end. Let him stay there with the body, Draco’s body, the body that Harry had thought he had his whole life to learn over and over again.
that wand, and real-Harry could remember the silky slide of alder under his fingers, and the easy magic of the tools—lathe and chisel and gouge—and the feel of being satisfied, of the knowledge that he had done
“Malfoy really loves that dog,” Ron said, watching Harry across the table.
Harry didn’t mind the dreams usually (though they were weird, they weren’t any weirder than all the Voldemort dreams), but this one had disturbed him. Dream-Malfoy had been so close, where they were shoved together in the alcove on what was in real life the fifth floor Charms corridor, and Harry remembered saying to him, “Where are we? Where are we, Malfoy?” and Malfoy had sheathed the sword, just slid it smoothly into the leather sheath at his hip until the throat of the sword was buried in the leather of the scabbard, and then he’d touched a gauntleted hand to Harry’s chest, resting lightly over his heart with a clink of metal against metal, because
“No,” Harry says, pressing down a little with his body, feeling breathless. “Not me.”
When Harry gets down to the kitchen, the kettle is boiling, and Draco is fiddling with the radio, looking dissatisfied, moving from station to station through the soft hiss of static.
And it was just as well, because he could hardly remember all the times that he had gone for weeks or months without any dreams at all, because they had started up again with a vengeance, and Harry’s nights were a furious barrage of Malfoy after Malfoy after Malfoy.
Harry told him—told him the thing that hadn’t told anyone else yet—and held his breath with the magnitude of it.
that Draco's had to glamour away the lines of tension around his eyes for tonight. Harry wonders what it’s all for. No one in the Ministry believed Narcissa when she told them at the trials, and they still don’t believe her son, no matter how many hands he shakes or how sweetly he tries to convince them.
But he had tried.
“Yes, you weirdo. As long as you’ll stay around, I’ll keep coming back to you. Deal?”
a dad, which is more than Harry can say.
“You don’t even want the real me.”
The church doesn’t look like any Harry has ever been to in England. It sits squat at the top of a cliff, bleached by sun, bare bones of columns rising to the sky. Inside everything is gold, and the altar groans with tapestries, and the end of every pew bristles with bouquets of lavender, and the sultry smell of incense fights against the sea breeze through the open door.
And Friday night had been brilliant, and awful, like it always was with Malfoy. And then Harry had Saturday night alone, and spent all of it waking, shivery and unsatisfied, from dreams of Malfoy—all variations on the same dream, over and over and over, dream-Malfoy on his haunches in a shallow stream, nose red and peeling, a wide-brimmed hat jammed on his head, the rough cotton of his shirt dark with sweat. He was laughing up at dream-Harry, and in his hands he held a large flat gravel-filled pan which he was swishing through the water. Harry thought if he had to watch Malfoy’s smile begin one more time he might go mad, and he couldn’t imagine why Malfoy was even in his head at all. He certainly thought he’d fucked Malfoy out of his system fairly efficiently the night before. But Harry knew that the dreams didn’t ever go away for good.
“Could be hours,” Draco says, smiling spitefully. “Residual damage. Might go on all night. Never stopped anyone else before. But if you’re not into it…”
Not friends yet, but no longer sworn enemies, and Draco was wincing, holding a hand to his side. Teddy, who can’t have been more than three then, was running around hopped up on birthday excitement, and Andromeda had finally allowed Harry to buy him a training broom, and Harry and Draco were quiet and companionable together as they shot Cushioning Charms at the grass. Neither of them wanted to be the one to ruin Teddy’s first fly with an argument. But Draco’s mouth was tight with some sort of pain, and when he laid a careful hand to his hipbone, Harry saw under the hem of his t-shirt a horrid dark bruise, and he remembered the Bludger from earlier, the sound cracking around the stadium and Draco swaying on his broom, and then shaking his head and motioning impatiently for them to play on.
“Are you trying to have phone sex with me from the moon or whatever?” Harry said, not wanting to smile but feeling it starting in the corners of his mouth anyway.
In the mirror over the bar, reflected lights wink low and confiding through the warp of the old glass. Harry catches sight of his own unfamiliar, borrowed face looking back at him, too pale and too thin but just on the right side of unnoticeable. He pays for his drink with a mint-bright Galleon and the barman slides a tepid bottle of mediocre ale over to him and jerks his head towards the back of the pub. He doesn’t give Harry any change.
“I’ve been standing here looking out”—he gestures at the Park, at the spot where a few hours before they had split the soul out of the Horcrux and let it burn itself into oblivion—”and wondering why she used that. Why she used something of mine, something with my name on it. She must have taken it from the Manor. I used to have it in my room. I grew out of it before I went to Hogwarts, but you don’t just get rid of your first cloak pin, you know?” (as though Harry could possibly know, with his cupboard and his hand-me-downs and all that magic lost to him for so long).
And Harry was in bed, in Draco’s bed in fact—the bed in Draco’s old flat (the weird flat with the bathroom down the hall and the hand-painted flowers on the kitchen cabinet, and the French flatmate who played Muggle guitar and had rigged up a sound system that was part Muggle equipment, part Sonorus Charm). But for once, they were alone in the flat, and Draco had hurried Harry along the windowless corridor to his small room, pushing him with a firm hand at the base of his back, and Harry had just gone with it, half-excited and half-terrified at the thought of finally getting to see Draco naked.
