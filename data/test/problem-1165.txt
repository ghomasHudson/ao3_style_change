Carefully, Draco pulled Harry the rest of the way in the room so he could shut the door. Then he helped him up, took him over to the bed, and sat him down.
The dark-haired man gave an exasperated sigh. “They are not. I’ve seen plenty of guys with pierced ears. Fred and George each have an earring.”
Softly shushing him, Draco gently rubbed Harry's back and took him over to the bed. They sat down, Harry on his lap, and waited as he cried himself out.
Just then the lunch trolley rolled around. The boys bought themselves a few snacks to hold them over until dinner at the castle and after stuffing their faces, Harry felt decidedly better.
Harry stood in his window, watching Draco’s retreating back only to note a familiar car already parked outside the house. He watched as Eric exited the vehicle and walked up the sidewalk.
Harry looked down at his fidgeting fingers. “I just… I feel bad that I didn’t spend anything on your gift.” He said.
Harry sat back down and sighed again. “No, he doesn’t hate you. We could never hate you.” He put an arm around the boy’s shoulders and Scorpius rested his head on him. “Now, what do you mean you didn’t know?”
Hagrid expression softened completely and he backed away from the pair that was still holding hands. “I guess I’ll leave ya ter it then.” He said softly, then turned and walked away.
“You alright, love?” The dark-head of hair bobbed in a nod, but Harry’s sudden shaking told Draco otherwise.
“I trust you’re feeling better.” Dumbledore said as he seated himself in the chair Sirius had vacated.
Harry gave his friend a hard look. “He’s not the same git he was in first year, Ron. He… he’s changed.”
“Bull shit.” Draco reached up and pushed Scorpius’ hair back from his ear. “What the hell is this!?”
“I see you’re up to eating now.” The blonde said as he picked up his own roll. Harry nodded his reply as he chewed.
Feeling much more like himself now, Draco checked to make sure Scorpius was still asleep before making his way to Harry's bedroom. He knocked a few times and opened the door when he received no answer.
When Harry finally got out of the bed he ran toward a door but then stopped when he saw an identical one a few feet away.
As he crossed his arms, Harry snorted, “That’s easy for you to say. You get to go home to people who love you. Why do I have to go back there anyway? Voldemort’s been gone for two years now.”
The two walked in a moment later, Petunia fussing over Dudley, and took a seat at the table to wait. Not a minute later, they could hear Vernon coming down the hall, talking loudly and excitedly like he was trying to impress someone.
“Harry, if at any time you want me to stop, just say so. Alright?” Draco asked quietly, his eyes clearly saying, ‘Please don’t make me stop now.’
“I know this isn’t exactly a good thing.” Draco started slowly. “But I used to wish you’d get hit more… just so I could see you.” He avoided the other’s gaze because he didn’t want to see the hurt there.
“It’s ok Harry. Everything will be alright.” He said and cupped Harry's cheek, wiping the tears away with his thumb in a soothing motion.
With a frown, Draco replied, “I’m not sure if I should say. I probably shouldn’t have said what did. Like I said, I don’t want to upset you.”
Both blonde girls gasped and immediately turned to look back up at Tonks. “Please?” They begged with clasped hands and puppy dog eyes.
For the first minute or two, Draco moved at a moderate pace, not wanting to hurt the other boy. Harry could feel every inch sliding in and out of him and it was the better than he could have possibly imagined.
After a few minutes of relative silence, Harry flipped over so that he was facing the blonde. “Can I ask you something?” He asked.
“Who are you?” He finally asked the question he had been wanting to ask for weeks now. All she did was smirk, grab his tie, and yank him forward into another heart stopping kiss.
The answer became obvious when a guilty look crossed the blonde’s face and Draco turned his head away with a small cough. “Not… exactly.” He replied as he put a featherweight charm on Harry's trunk so the pregnant boy would be able to lift it.
Hermione looked down at Harry to see he had stopped crying and that his head was resting comfortably on Draco's shoulder.
Time wasn’t the only factor that contributed to Harry's ability to sleep peacefully. Exhaustion was another big part of it, and not from over-studying for final exams as one would expect. No, now that Harry had crossed the line to being a
Draco had laid back down and was now stroking his erection back to life. His other hand was absentmindedly caressing the skin below his navel as he stared Harry down.
“J-James.” He repeated. Everything came flooding back and he nearly dropped the still unnamed infant.
Madam Pomfrey lowered her wand and the image faded. “I know it’s not much right now; it’s barely a quarter of an inch long. Just give it some time to grow and it’ll look like the child you’re expecting it to be.”
Draco quickly unlocked the door and opened it to find a sobbing Harry on the other side. He had collapsed to his knees while trying to wake the other. In his distress, he couldn’t remember which stones revealed the doorknob.
“Shhh. Shhh.” Draco pulled Harry into a tight hug. “He’ll never hurt us again. He can’t anymore. Weasley didn’t make it.”
In the dim light, he could barely make out a form huddled in the corner. The young Malfoy pulled out his wand and cast Lumos. He was surprised, to say the least, at whom he was looking at.
“Wha… what are you doing here?” Harry asked when the other pulled away, neither of them noticing that the majority of the room was watching them and whispering.
Draco walked into the bathroom just as Harry was expelling what was left of his dinner into the toilet. “I thought you said you were better.” He said sternly as he knelt beside the sick boy.
Draco, who had been standing just to the right of Harry's vision, had quickly moved to help the, mostly likely, bruised boy off the ground.
Draco felt his heart clench painfully for Harry. It took everything he had not to push Sirius out of the way so he could hold Harry and tell him everything would be ok. But he wasn’t just going to stand there either.
The next two weeks felt like a year to Harry. He knew it was his own fault though because he was doing exactly what Draco had told him not to do: watching the clock.
“Harry!” A female voice exclaimed. He snapped his attention to the closing door to see Hermione running to him. She gave him a quick hug and sat down next to him.
Harry sputtered and coughed as he fell backwards, arms flailing, and knocked the lamp off his nightstand as he went. He sat there a moment, coughing. In the background, he could vaguely hear Draco apologizing.
“I was paying Astoria ten grand a month with another ten just for the birth. She didn’t really need the money though; she just wanted to help me. As soon as she found out about my predicament, she absolutely refused to take the rest of the money. Thankfully, I had put the money for her in a private account so my father couldn’t take it back.
Professor Dumbledore extracted a small knife from within his robes. “That’s not how a magical contract works. It needs a drop of your blood.” He stated.
Hogsmeade weekend couldn’t come fast enough for either of them. Every minute seemed to last an hour, every hour seemed to last a day. By the time that Saturday came around, Harry was a nervous wreck.
Almost the moment Harry’s head hit his pillow, but sounds of an infant crying drifted over the baby monitor on his nightstand. With a sigh, Harry sat back up.
For the first time all over again, their lips met in a fiery kiss. But kissing Harry was somehow different than kissing Harlot. She had been confident, while he was much more shy. Being in another’s skin must have made quite a difference.
“Potter, don’t sneak up on me like that.” He said angrily and ignored the fact that the naked body behind him was making him hard.
The pair acquiesced but just as the flash went off; Draco tilted his head slightly and planted a soft kiss on Harry’s temple, maintaining eye contact with the camera. Just a little extra way of saying: He belongs to me.
Draco laughed lightly at Harry's antics, tilted his head up, and crashed their mouths together. Their tongues immediately delving into each other, exploring and tasting.
“Remus, you already know Draco.” Harry started, introducing them. “Sirius, this is Draco Malfoy, my boyfriend.”
Harry bit back a smirk even though no one could see his face at the moment. “Harry.” He softly replied.
Harry sighed in relief when he read that he wouldn’t have to testify. He wasn’t sure he would be able to face Ron again or if he’d be able to talk about in front of him and a bunch of other people he didn’t know. It wasn’t very hard to decide he wouldn’t be attending the hearing.
“Really, Hagrid, I’m fine. I can get there myself.” Harry said, politely trying to get him to leave as they made their way across the courtyard.
“Alright, here we go.” She walked around the corner and not a moment later soft, classical music began to fill the air.
Draco scoffed. “You don’t know my father. He likes things the traditional way, which means no bastard children and certainly no homosexual sons.
“I don’t like it either but you know very well why. Dumbledore thinks there’s a chance that the remaining Death Eaters are still after you.” Draco explained for the billionth time. “One month. I will be there to get you July 31
The younger man took a deep, calming breath and did as instructed. On cue, the finger inside him slowly began to move in and out. Only a moment later, a second finger was added to the first and the pair repeated their previous actions.
Harry heaved another sigh and slumped against the headboard, eyes closed. He just wanted to curl up and hide for a while, until everyone forgot he ever existed. Then he would be safe.
Meanwhile, he lined his erection up with the prepared entrance. Draco pushed into the hilt in one smooth motion. Beneath him, Harry moaned incessantly.
As the two males continued to stare each other down, the room steadily grew quieter. Neither seemed to have noticed the commotion they were causing and the attention they were drawing.
“Then come for me, Harry.” Draco growled huskily in his ear and lowered himself just a little more so that Harry's cock was rubbing against his stomach.
He was cut off when a snowball hit him right in the mouth. He sputtered for a moment to get the snow out and brushed it off his face. Harry stood a few feet away clutching his sides and laughing.
Harry stared unseeingly at the child he was still holding. Tears pricked his eyes and silently began sliding down his cheeks.
“I think I can more than make up for it.” With a smirk, Draco took her by the wrist and pulled her toward a wall. He whispered a password and the passage into the Slytherin common room opened up.
Harry pulled the blanket back and waited until he’d tucked the small boy into bed to reply. “No, Papa’s not mad at Scorpy. Or anyone else. Life just does weird things sometimes and he’s mad at that.” He smiled tightly.
Feeling Harry's heavy gaze on him, Snape said, “Cleaning and diagnostic spells.” Not a minute later, he was walking down the empty side of the bed toward the new parents.
Harry tried to answer but he started vomiting again. This time it was accompanied by blood, and quite a bit of it.
Harry was still looking at Draco but he quickly looked down as he answered. “I- I got in a fight with Ron.” He stammered.
Harry lowered his wand and the force field flickered and disappeared. Then he walked over to Draco and took his hand.
Harry flopped onto his back on the bed he was sitting on, arms spread out and his head hanging off the other side. “Mother fucker.” He repeated.
“Congratulations, you have just given birth to a healthy baby boy.” He said as he leaned down to the place the child in Harry's now outstretched arms.
“Draco.” Narcissa Malfoy called when she saw them. Draco sped up a little and hugged her when he got to her. Catching sight of Harry a few feet behind him, she asked, “Is this the young man you were talking about?”
After leaving the twins to their play, Harry turned his attention to the door hiding his first son. He noticed the ‘Do not Disturb’ sign hung on the doorknob and checked to see if it was locked. It came as no surprise to find he couldn’t open it. It was an easy decision to give Scorpius some time to himself.
“Harry. And if you want to hear it, it’ll cost you.” He finished as he stuffed the dirty cloth back into his purse.
Emma rushed out of the room and toward the bathroom door on the left. The door was closed though and she was about to go use the one downstairs when she heard the unmistakable sound of someone being sick.
Immediately, the woman deposited her parchment and quill onto the coffee table in front of her. “No problem.” She replied. “I’m only meant to report on the wedding and child for the events page.”
“Knock it off!” Came a snarl from the bed. Both men turned their attention to the two boys. Harry's body language made it extremely obvious that their argument was upsetting him. He was curled into Draco's side, the blonde’s arms wrapped tightly around him as he shook.
Draco blanched and subtly tried to cover himself just in case Harry decided to take a shot at his bits. “Why?” He asked in more of a squeak than he would care to admit.
Using his wand, he quickly removed Harry’s bindings. Next, he found the bathrobe that had been thrown across the room and got it onto the other man’s naked body.
It took nearly twenty minutes, but eventually Harry had his youngest boys cleaned up and in their pajamas.
“Mmmm.” Draco purred. “That bad, huh?” He pinned Harry’s smaller body against the cold, stone wall and pushed a knee between his legs.
Almost instantly, he felt his legs being pressed together and the other boy straddled him. Hot breath wafted over his ear and a husky voice whispered, “I thought I’d pick up where we left off.”
Harry rolled onto his back and spread his legs apart to give Draco access to his most intimate place.
Deciding that was as good as it was going to get, Harry folded it up and moved to tie it to Hedwig’s leg. She nipped his hand affectionately before taking off.
“It’s getting late.” Harry stated, glancing at the clock on his nightstand and noticing that it was after six. “You need to go.”
Harry sighed again and snuggled into his boyfriend. “I know. I know. Alright, go ahead and wake me up for round two.”
This time Draco moved his lips slowly against Harry's hoping to coax a response out of him. Surprisingly, he felt Harry's lips moving with his almost right away.
“That’s ok Harry. You don’t have to talk to me if you don’t want to. But there is someone I would like you to talk to.” He said and gestured to the door. A woman wearing a gray muggle skirt suit and glasses with blonde hair up in a loose bun walked in.
Harry couldn’t help but to tune out the rest of the introduction. His attention was currently focused on trying not to cry.
Harry continued walking at a hurried pace, trying to keep ahead from the other’s huge strides. He didn’t think Hagrid would like the person he’s dating very much.
Once that was taken care of, the blonde rose from his seat and stretched his back before shoving his hands in his pockets and making his way out of the room.
When he was allowed to breathe again, it took Draco several minutes to be able to form a full sentence. “Will you… at least tell me… your name?”
The teen sighed, not entirely knowing what to say. “Sort of, but not really.” He knew his answer was incredibly vague, but he wasn’t ready for
The blonde man stood, wincing as he did so. “Yeah, I’m fine.” He replied as he brushed dirt off the short, pale pink dress he was wearing. They both looked down to see that his bare knees and shins were scraped up and bleeding.
In the hallway, Draco could hear the clear sounds of intermittent sobbing. He turned to head in the direction it was coming from, but another thought occurred to him first. “Elliot.” He mumbled to himself.
As soon as Professor Snape released Draco, the blonde hurried back to Harry's side and pulled him into a comforting hug. The eyes of three of the four adults in the room widened in shock when they saw the once enemies embrace.
Draco got up and opened the window. The gray owl flew into the room and landed on Harry's lap, presenting him its leg. He removed the two envelopes and the owl took off back out the window.
“Of course I have a name.” She rolled her eyes. “But you…” She poked him in the chest. “… can call me… Harlot.”
Several minutes later, the couple was curled up on the couch with Harry snuggling on Draco’s still bare chest.
Before continuing with the preparation, Draco moved back up and distracted Harry with a mind-blowing kiss.
Harry nodded just as the door creaked open again and two girls came into the room: Hermione, followed by Ginny. Harry felt his stomach drop. Was Ginny going to blame him? Ron was her brother after all.
I know we mostly just talk through our mirrors before bed but I couldn’t wait that long to get this out, even though you probably won’t get this until tonight anyway.
Harry laid down on his back and stared at the ceiling just as Draco was doing. A few moments later he felt a finger brush against his hand and he opened it so their fingers could link together. He shifted a little so he could comfortably turn his head and observe his husband.
“Um… yeah sure. I-I just need to get mine from my seat.” Harry said timidly as they walked away from the Slytherin table.
Harry quietly got into bed after taking off his blood stained night shirt. For the first time in a long time, he fell asleep smiling.
Harry had been ready for retaliation and ducked out of the way just in time. He dropped to his knees and prepared another ball. When he looked up, Draco was gone. “Where’d you go?” He asked.
Distractedly, he replied, “Draco Mal—” There was a loud smacking sound as “Starlight” clapped a hand over his mouth.
Draco wrapped an arm around Harry's waist. “You know I could help you in potions, don’t you? After all that is my best class.” He asked.
The older boy nipped the shell of the ear in front of him. “I’ll take that as a yes.” He said and began to gently move against the other body.
Harry couldn’t help his own small laugh, despite the situation. “That means he thinks you're Draco’s brother, dumbass.
“Isn’t there something you can give him for the pain?” Draco asked as Harry began wincing and gasping through another contraction.
“Caesarian, or C-section, is when a fetus must be removed surgically for various reasons. I was told you were catatonic when you were brought in, so that is likely the reason.” Emma clarified.
“That’s what is says on my driver’s license.” He said with a small grin. “And now that everybody knows everybody, answer my question.”
“Well don’t just stand there, Harry. Make yourself at home.” Draco said as he plopped down on a squishy, over stuffed couch.
“Yes, but I won’t be offended if you decide to choose someone else. Many parents, especially first-timers, prefer… more experienced healers. I assume that’s why you chose McNamara to begin with?” She asked.
Being the first time he’d been touched by another person, Harry was quickly nearing his release. His wand clattered to the floor and rolled away as his fingers dug into the cold stone behind him.
Emma bit her lip and refused to meet her dad’s eye. Scorpius had told her not to tell, but if he was sick, she wanted him to get help.
“The only way you and I will ever have sex, is if we’re both completely willing and it’s not a form of payment. And certainly not tonight.” Harry replied resolutely.
children now, plus, a grandchild, and I love them all dearly. But… I think it’s time to stop.” Draco slowly and cautiously explained.
“I automatically started thinking the worst but I didn’t want to start panicking for nothing. For all I knew, it could have just been a routine check-up. So I looked up the doctor’s name to find out what his specialty was. I was furious when I found out.” Harry paused and shook his head to help clear the anger that was suddenly rolling off of him.
She wasn’t holding a baby and they couldn’t hear the cries of a newborn. The worst possible outcome jumped to the forefront of Draco's mind and his heart began hammering in his chest.
The blonde man turned to take his leave, but a thought occurred to him. “I should also probably mention this so you aren’t surprised by it later…”
Harry picked up a biscuit as Anna continued, “So, it seems you two knew each other for some time before getting together. How did that happen?”
“What do ya think yer doin’ Malfoy?” Hagrid nearly roared as he stomped over to them, “Get yer hands off’a Harry!”
Both finally naked, Draco moved to Harry’s groin, his now hard cock standing tall against dark curls. The blonde immediately sucked the appendage into his mouth, eliciting a high pitched moan from the man beneath him.
“Sorry.” Harry shut the door behind them. “Do you want anything, a drink maybe?” He asked, suddenly nervous.
With watery eyes, the brunette looked at the red brick separating them from the muggle side of King’s Cross.
“Scorpius Hyperion Potter-Malfoy, do you have any idea what time it is!?” Bellowed an angry Draco the moment his fourteen year old son walked through the door. “Your curfew was almost three hours ago!”
The first thing Harry did when he woke up was check the time. It was almost two-thirty and the very first thing he felt was irrational anger. He’d slept right through lunch and Draco hadn’t woken up him.
In case you haven’t realized this yet, I’m pregnant with your child. I’d say probably close to five months by now. Yeah, I wasn’t sick toward the end of the year. I wish I would have listened to you and gone to see Pomfrey.
Draco continued in such a fashion and buried his face in her hair at the side of her neck. Harlot’s pleasured screams were muffled by the pillow beneath her. Her breathing hitched as he began placing love bites on her skin. And suddenly, something gave the young man pause. Hadn’t he been pressed against her hair?
“Why didn’t you just tell him?” Harry asked. “He might have been more understanding if you’d just explained yourself.”
“Good night, love.” Draco whispered with a small smile and kissed the brunette’s forehead. He watched Harry sleep for a minute before he walked around the privacy screen and motioned with his head for Remus and Sirius to follow him.
He quickly racked his brain and came up with only two places Ron would have taken him without getting caught; The Room of Requirement or Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.
By the time Draco moved away, Harry could barely breathe. That seemed to be his goal because he smirked and dropped to his knees in front of the brunette boy and said, “I’m thanking you.”
Draco stepped out of the way so Harry could get in front of the barrier. “The featherweight charm should last long enough to— actually; I’ll just put another one on it.” He did so and then added, “As long as they don’t stop for too long, that will last plenty long enough for you to be able to carry it inside.”
“How did Mrs. Weasley put up with this six times?!” Harry exclaimed when he was finished in the bathroom. “I’m only two months into my pregnancy and it’s already driving me crazy!”
“I wasn’t expecting anything more. In fact, I think I would have been rather disappointed had you reacted.” Eric said huskily into the boy’s ear. “I like how inexperienced you are and I will greatly enjoying breaking you in.”
Draco went from a happy grin to guilt-ridden worry. “Love, what’s wrong?” He asked as Harry’s shoulders began to shake.
“Scorpius…” That’s all it took for the boy to break down in tears. “So, you are then? …Pregnant?” He nodded and wiped at his eyes.
As the girls approached the bed, Harry noticed that Ginny looked angry and that she had been crying. Her arms were crossed tightly over her chest as if to stop herself from taking out her wand and cursing whatever was in her range.
? That’s the day after my birthday! You were only going to give me one day’s notice?!” Harry shrieked. “What if I hate everything you picked out?!”
Harry hurried across the entrance hall but came to a stop when he heard someone call his name. He turned to see Professor McGonagall coming toward him.
“Yes.” The shorter boy grumbled and dropped the book, Quidditch Through the Ages, into his trunk. “How was Quidditch practice?” He asked, changing the subject.
“And you’re sure you’re okay with this?” The brunette asked warily. “I don’t want to make you do something you’re not ready for.”
“And baby.” The blonde repeated and looked down as well. “And grandma.” He added with a smirk, earning him a smack to the back of the head from his mother and a laugh from Harry. “Come on. I’ll take you to the barrier.” He said as they pulled apart.
“Ok, Daddy.” They chorused and hopped off their chairs. They took their dirty dishes to the sink before shuffling from the room.
Sirius gave Harry a soft smile. “Don’t mind us.” He said. “We’ll leave you alone so you can rest. We need to speak to Dumbledore anyway.” He stood up and kissed the top of Harry's head. “Love you, Harry.”
The man quickly changed the girl’s nappy. “I suppose I could do without having to change those anymore.” He grumbled to himself as he sat in the rocking chair to soothe Olivia back to sleep.
“Read this and when you’ve finished it, bring it back and I’ll answer any questions you might still have from there.” She instructed.
Harry took a few deep breaths to calm himself down before continuing. “That was almost a year ago and I haven’t even attempted a serious relationship since then. I’ve certainly had my share of one-nighters, with both men and women, but nothing ever came of them.
“Fine, just make it quick. I want to go back to sleep.” Harry stated as a warm tongue began lavishing attention on his burgeoning cock.
Scorpius nodded. “Ok.” Harry smiled. “Good. You also have my permission to go back to your room if you get too uncomfortable or your father
“Well…” Draco took a seat as he began. “First we have Scorpius. He’s fifteen and he has your hair and stubborn attitude. Then there are the twins.”
After that, they stopped at the crowded Three Broomsticks for lunch and a couple butterbeers. Harry wasn’t quite ready to make his sexual orientation public yet nor did he want to share his relationship with Draco (not because he was afraid of their reactions but because he wanted to keep him to himself for a while), so they found a booth hidden away from the prying eyes of curious students.
“Yes, it is my business. It’s been my business since I found Harry crying and bleeding in the middle of the night three months ago. Why do you think he’s been happy even though you keep abusing him?” Draco asked as he tightened his hold.
They were figuring out that something strange was going on with Harry and it doubtlessly wouldn’t be long before they questioned him about it. If they were to find out about his pregnant state, his uncle would probably do more to him that just a smack upside the head. That was something he wouldn’t risk and mostly likely wouldn’t live through a second time, accidentally or otherwise.
“Physically, at least.” Harry replied as he fidgeted with the corner of his hospital blanket. It wasn’t a lie either; his stomach really didn’t hurt anymore.
“Harry.” He turned to his blonde boyfriend. “Because there are still so few of us, abortion is illegal in the wizarding world unless bringing the child to term poses a risk to the carrier’s health.” Draco explained.
All the while, Draco continued to, almost imperceptibly, add his ring ringer to the tightness inside Harry.
“If you do have a miscarriage, I’ll be right here to help you just like you helped me. You may not realize it Draco, but you are so much stronger than me. I wouldn’t have come out of it if I didn’t have you.” He finished. They were silent for a while, each contemplating their situation.
“Well, well, well. Sensitive, aren’t we? I just might have to explore this.” He said with a teasing smirk.
A few moments later, the boys were dropped onto opposite ends of the couch in the living room. They scooted as far away from each other as they could get and firmly avoided looking at the other.
to be something else we can do. We have hundreds of books filled with the old laws we could look through, see if we can find something in one of them.” Draco suggested as calmly as he could.
When it stopped, Harry found himself lying on his side on the floor. He glanced up at the fireplace but decided he didn’t want to risk moving again as he began sobbing.
Harry nodded and looked down at his slightly protruding stomach. After fifteen years of having no family that loved him, fate had finally given him something he’s always wanted. Even if it was his rapist baby, it was still
Harlot smirked and grabbed the back of his head. “You have no idea.” She then pulled him back down into another steamy kiss. Their mouths and hands continued to explore each other as clothing was torn away.
Harry awoke the next morning feeling warm, cozy, and happier than he could ever remember being in his entire life. He could’ve cast the strongest patronus the world had ever seen if he needed to.
“Well you’ve already started receiving gifts of relatives who won’t be attending the wedding.” Narcissa interjected.
Finally, he remembered the small, rectangular device sitting on his nightstand. The one Draco hated. If he could only make a call, just one.
Using the leverage he had with his grip on Harry's hands, he was soon pounding into the writhing and moaning body beneath him.
At first when he hadn’t seen her in a single one of his classes, he assumed she was just a year below him. But after a few days, he realized he couldn’t find her in the Great Hall either.
He continued, “And yes, I had an erection. All that means is that you’re attractive. Obviously,” He glanced down between their bodies, “you think I’m attractive too.”
“Yeah, but this is different. My body feels like it’s on fire knowing that I can’t do much about it.” Harry explained. The blonde suddenly pulled Harry into an alcove behind a nearby tapestry.
“Harry?” He called as he stepped into the room. The blonde immediately noticed his husband’s naked form on the bed and was both surprised and confused he hadn’t received a response. His heart jumped into his throat as the worst possibilities raced through his mind.
Draco backed up some to take in the sight of the glorious naked body before him. His eyes settled where her hand was lazily rubbing her clit. “Now,” she demanded in a husky voice. And he was only too happy to oblige.
Still smiling, Draco stood from the couch and held out a hand to help Harry up. “Why don’t we leave the rest of your mess for later and take a bath?” He suggested, already leading the shorter boy toward their bathroom.
“How did the son of the richest man in the country end up living like this?” The question was rushed, almost like he was afraid or ashamed of asking.
With a light chuckle, the red-haired man moved around the bed and stopped at Harry’s side. He crouched down to the bound man’s level and, surprisingly, removed the gag.
“I know I’m not ready but, I don’t think I could bear the thought of having a child out there whose life I wasn’t a part of.”
“Harlot” was suddenly a frightened deer. “Oh shit, it wore off,” he stammered and scrambled away from the older boy, pressing himself against the head board.
“He was your best friend, you little shit! He would’ve given you everything he had if you’d asked for it! You act as if he asked for the life he has. Harry would give everything to have a normal life!” Snape spat. “I’d kill you but you’re not worth going to prison over!”
The frizzy-haired brunette was taken aback. “I’m… sorry Harry. I didn’t know you cared so much.” She said in confusion. “So, what happened?”
“The last time I saw you was when I was six. I had finally managed to stop messing up and getting myself beaten. I used to visit you sometimes in the late evening when you’d already be in bed. Remember?” Harry explained softly.
“It’s not a big deal.” Sirius cut in. “Lots of parents have trouble naming their kids. If what I heard from relatives is correct, my brother was home from the hospital for an entire week before my parents picked a name for him.”
“That still doesn’t explain why you became a prostitute.” Harry said as the blonde finished with his bandages. “Surely you could have gotten a job anywhere.”
For a while after that, the group of four just sat there and talked about their day. They were careful to avoid subjects that would upset Harry too much. Hermione excitedly told him how Snape actually gave her house points when she answered a question correctly. She assumed the potions professor knew about the situation and felt sorry for her. Draco confirmed this story with a nod.
“Sweet Merlin, Harry.” Draco dragged a hand through his hair. “We need to get you to St. Mungo’s. Now.”
Harry’s mind began to race as he realized he had actually been in labor all day. He’d been too focused on staying comfortable to figure out that the crampy feeling he had before his bath had actually been light contractions. Even after having had false labor a few weeks ago and getting a taste of what the real thing would feel like, he still hadn’t figured it out.
As he was about to shut the door, another one opened and Harry stepped out in nothing but a pair of low riding pajama pants.
He turned around to see Draco standing above him, his arms crossed and a triumphant look on his face. Harry tackled him and they both tumbled through the mounds of snow for a moment only to stop with Draco on top of him.
“Now that is really none of your business.” Draco replied quickly. Even Scorpius didn’t know the real story behind how Harry and Draco got together. He turned to his son. “It’s almost time for me to speak. Let’s go sit down now.”
Up in Harry’s room, the door intentionally left unlocked, the dark-haired young man sat nervously on the edge of his bed. “Well, this is it.” He gestured around the room. A bed, a dresser, a chair, a hamper, and not much else.
'Look. If you've suddenly decided to act like a badboy, that's fine with me...' She frowned now, shaking her head quickly. 'Well, it's not fine. But... who am I to-' She never finished her sentence and just inhaled deeply. 'Just stay out of trouble. Okay?'
"But I want to," Draco continued, moving his lips down his jawline to kiss his neck. Harry closed his eyes, the frown increasing on his forehead.
"Will you please just fuck off?" Harry threw her an angry look, his eyes red of crying, Myrtle snarled at him, making her way up to sit at a window, brushing her hair with her fingers – sweeping looks at him as Harry washed his face. "You are just like the others," she spoke as he investigated the outside world. "Cruel and-"
"What is going on?" Harry managed to draw from his lips, his voice broken. It was no longer a question. He demanded an explanation. Or else: a hospital bed. Dumbledore, calm as always, gestured Harry to come closer.
The doors opened in front of him once he opened his eyes. The crackling sound of stones grinding and changing position echoed through the halls, leaving Harry almost exposed – if anyone was the approach him soon. As the passage became all clear to go through, he made the smallest steps he could afford, making his way through the portal – allowing the wall to enclose him at once. The room was soundless. He was in the room of hidden things. He couldn't believe his eyes, finding objects he'd never encountered before. Closets, trophies, piles of books reaching up to the ceiling – wobbling to make the passage too dangerous. This castle would always be a majestic place full of secrets. How amazing, finding out different secrets each time. He wanted to stay here for a while. He wanted to go through the boxes stored with statues, kettles, tools. Who knew what was kept hidden here? A shuffling sound caused Harry to turn immediately. Birds flew above his head, creating spirals and layers of dust to move. He coughed, holding his hand in front of his mouth and nose as he narrowed his eyes – his glasses not fully protecting him now. "Malfoy?" he hissed as he arced his back, moving through a path of old mirrors. "Malfoy, I know you're in here. It's why the passage opened itself. Is this what you want?" He gritted his teeth together, holding a statue that was ready to fall down on him. "A game of hide and seek..." Harry sighed, the level of annoyance was raising once more, and he couldn't believe he'd fallen for this. A simple game of mind fuck. How long was this going to take? When would Draco be done with this? With their awkward experience, and whatnot. How could this still linger them two? Sexual adventures were standard once growing up. Probably half of the school encountered homosexual experiences, if it wasn't just for almost all of the girls. But not Hermione. Hermione would never kiss anyone – to Harry's believes.
"Yeah," Draco replied, his voice soft – his throat being sore. "Get your shit, we've got to go, Potter." Malfoy transformed again. His former attitude creating for him to be the greatest ass again, and Harry couldn't stand it.
Harry pursed his lips after pressing another kiss on his skin, this time on the exact spot where his bellybutton was located.
'It was idiotic,' Hermione concluded, after what Harry nodded convincing – beside the fact he was busy trying to keep the smirk from his face. Ron sighed, taking the pot of floo powder in his hand, and he offered Harry to go first. They were planning on visiting Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. Having the strange desire to prank around, and see what they could get their hands on for easy money.
Harry gathered his strength and straightened his back as if he was about to perform an interview. Dumbledore could be the one to know, and he wanted answers.
"What are you implying?" Harry asked as he threw a quick glance at Snape - as if he wouldn't know anything about it.
Harry softly closed the sliding door, resulting for Draco to swiftly flick his wand so the awnings fell down with a noise – granting them privacy.
Harry grinned, pulling Draco closer to pull him back for a kiss, yet the blonde refused. Showing off his gums, his cocky attitude raising Harry's likings, he trailed his hands down Harry's body – his slender fingers drawing patterns on his belly. Harry gasped, his cheeks fluttering bright red now he managed to look down at his own pants – seeing his erection nearly peaking out the hem of his pants. His boner was rock solid.
"Protect what? Me? Seeing you with Hermione doesn't do shit to me compared to everything that happened to me in the past. I'm actually quite happy for you even."
After an article about broom grooming he looked up from the magazine, an exhale left his mouth. Was he really going to bring this up? Breaking bones all over again, getting into trouble? He stopped questioning as soon as he saw a familiar robe drawing through the hall. He quickly put away his cup of tea and fastened his tie as he hopped on his feet - rushing towards the gate.
"-What about Draco?" Harry cut through. Enclosing the group, he wished to talk about any other business but them two. "What happened?"
"Did I make the right decision?" Draco's eyes were awfully widened – his hair roughly patched to the sides. Harry established himself – leaning onto the dresser to his right, finally able to look at his company. Though the answer would've been unsure to many, Harry knew he made the right decision. It was after all what they most desired - the both of them. Nevertheless Harry didn't answer. Not yet at least. Draco straightened his back, unbuttoning the first few buttons of his cotton white shirt – causing him to almost choke by adrenaline rushing through his bloody veins. "Please," Draco muttered, his throat sore by the filthy air he breathed.
Draco finally moved his ass, getting up at last, and approached him. Their eyes meeting along the way. "Friendly approaching is not appreciated, I see..." He wetted his lips and shook his head, tightening his blazer around his body. "I wanted to talk about the upcoming school year. I expect no nonsense?"
"Jeez..- Don't!" Harry called, jumping back while putting his palm against the blonde's head, - as if he though he had to hold him back with force. He more or less calmed down when Malfoy started to laugh and he realized he'd been joking – or at least he hoped so. He didn't laugh himself, though.. For a moment he thought he would end up in one of those particular hallucinations again.
Harry and Draco were later put in Professor Snape his office. No cup of tea to ease their nervous tummies, nor a tap on the shoulder – or a warm welcome home. They were sitting next to each other. Draco was obviously offended now his own headmaster decided to keep him here, and Harry seemed to be braindead. He stared ahead of him, his hands lightly folded, as if he was waiting for a train to arrive – or took his time to take a proper shit.
Draco narrowed his eyes and grabbed Harry by his neck - scanning him closely, as if he was checking whether he stole some of his cookies and he could find the evidence in the corners of his mouth. "Now, what are you doing here? Think you can spy on me and my father? I think not."
"Well there must be," Harry panicked. "I saw him! We've met. We've met so many times. I swear, I'm not crazy."
"I want you to leave me alone," Draco gasped as his blonde hair stuck against his sweaty forehead. "Go!"
"Students are not allowed to stray outside the Castle after dark." His eyes became small. "I presumed after all these years you knew," Snape threw a look at Harry, blaming him; "Potter."
Excitement caused his breathing to become irregular. He could hear the walls moving. Talking to him. Opening a whole other world. Another room. He was standing in the Hall of Hexes. The seventh floor in the left corridor of the Hogwarts castle. Harry closed his eyes, pausing his walk to speak out his desires – screaming them out in his head. Anxious for what would come. Malfoy was dangerous. Many told him so.
He took some time, wiggling the wire inside the lock - expecting it to work the same way as it did back when he lived at the Dursleys, yet it didn't. "What do you want that is inside here anyways?" he suddenly asked in slow phase.
"You've been of great value, Neville," Harry replied surprisingly uplifted – tapping his shoulder as he left.
'You know what I'm talking about, Harry. Stop doing such idiotic things! You know Malfoy is not going to accept this. If he finds out what you did, you are going to be in trouble.' She hit his shoulder a second time, and then glanced around in the hope not to find Malfoy or one his bulky "slaves".
Seamus turned his back, shaking his head as he gathered with his mates to talk as they walked away – leaving Harry without a word.
Harry kept his jaws clenched. He didn't want to respond anymore. He'd given too much information already. God, she was good at guessing.
"Who are you?" Harry muttered as his hand trailed across the wall to find the cabinet. "I will kill you Ron, really."
"Hey," Harry muttered as he entered Ron's bedroom. Rubbing his hair dry with a towel, he stared at the spare bed – knowing how much it would please his exhausted body. If Ron could only keep his blabbering short...
'You look pretty,' Harry breathed against Draco's lips eventually without realizing how stupid and uncommon that might sound.
"See you later, Potter." Draco buttoned up his blouse, and made himself ready to leave – the gate crumbling in view.
"I don't feel like anything," Harry replied. Cold sweat dripped down his back, and every unfamiliar sound caught him off guard. The blonde didn't seem to buy it.
Draco curled back his arms, frowning his brows as he took some distance – yet without leaving the bed. "Wow, easy there. What's gotten into you?"
"You would've surely forgotten about me, if I didn't rescue your drunk ass tonight. What have you been drinking?"
'Venting anger on books, I see?' Harry spoke then, revealing himself from between the bookshelves. He didn't seem to fear, though. A miniscule, challenging smile crossed his lips even - to Draco's frustration.
Harry lowered his fork – confused as hell, knowing they were most dedicated to each other. Especially ever since their faces were stuck together every five minutes.
It had been months since Harry faced Draco. That special meeting caused some serious damage to Harry's brain, and he couldn't afford his school to suffer by it. He had more important things to put his focus to. For example, finishing many essays he'd been piling up over the weeks. Obviously he saw him once a while, at school whenever they had class together, but they never spoke – not that they ever did much. Now school was about to start again, his head became more fuzzy every minute. Malfoy haunted him in his dreams. Causing Harry to see things that weren't really there. Obscure thinking. Not quite pleasant.
Harry looked back over his shoulder, his friend staring at him – tensed, afraid he would be send home for whatever the reason was. "The room of requirements, Professor. I though you would reckon."
Harry grabbed him, holding his solid, warm, throbbing cock – jerking him slowly while he thumbed the tip of his tongue along the edges of his teeth. Draco took over him, grabbing the both of them to make their tips touch – grinding him until they were both close to their very edge.
Hermione tugged them two along, planning on going home soon since her belly became to growl for some lunch too. However, a certain curiosity crossed her mind. "Don't mind me asking, Harry. But what's with the strange obsession?"
Harry sat down on the bed, rubbing his eyes, and threw Ron a quick glance. He would've been impressed, and curious, if it wasn't for his terrible daydream causing his head to spin. "How is Draco?" he asked before he knew it.
And there it went. Droplets of sticky sperm poured all over Harry's stomach and abdomen - since he leaned back against the desk, and Harry wanted it to – and after he'd entirely climaxed, Harry moved his lips up to the Draco his abdomen so he could lick up the bitter seeds as well now – trying not to throw up as soon as he tried to swallow it. He managed not to, and in the end even seemed to like it - no matter how badly his head spun by the amount of physical exertion and alcohol he had.
The blonde turned, shrugging all the same as a fair answer. "The usual. We don't really celebrate it, for my father thinks it's a muggle's business."
"You getting wet?" Draco teased as he sucked on his skin, leaving a hickey at a perfect spot. His fingers drew along his neck down his collar, unbuttoning another two of his shirt.
Harry pursed his lips now, glancing over Hermione's shoulder to search for the sight of someone too, but didn't seem to put any effort in listening.
"Like you actually care," Draco smirked. "He minds everything." Harry couldn't keep himself from smirking too, and buried his lips in Draco his neck as well– sucking his skin softly while making his way down. Draco sank his fingertips into Harry his back, scratching his nails over his skin until red, slightly burning stripes revealed themselves in the shuttering light of the reflecting candles that illuminated at the entrance. Harry clenched his teeth now, trying not to groan as soon as Draco pressed his teeth into the skin of his chest, and he opened his eyes on a crack to gaze at his body – just realizing how hot he looked while wearing his tie but no shirt. He gasped now, sheaving his hand into the back pockets from Draco his pants, and couldn't keep himself from squeezing his ass. A gasp came from Draco's throat, and he threw his head in his neck, not being able to hold back a moan now as soon as Harry started to move the tip of his tongue along his bare chest.
"Please," Harry muttered – entering the classroom. "How should I know? I hate that slag, and you know it."
Malfoy marched through the tower, rubbing his chin before he took the time to speak again. "Lucky, I was."
"So that's it?" Draco muttered as he looked at the brunette's back. "We are going to pretend like nothing ever happened?"
Ron threw a glance at Hermione, barely able to keep his laugh in, and both followed Hagrid who gestured them to come out of the train and follow. Obviously they had to get out now too, and continue their normal business while their other musketeer was being punished a heartless soul.
The group spread out like butter on warm toast and watched from afar as Pomfrey checked the boy's temperature. "How are you feeling dear?"
"Yeah," Neville replied excited. "Lucius took a whiff of the situation, and he went totally nuts. Besides, Malfoy hasn't opened up to his father yet. Didn't tell him what he's been doing. What about you, Harry? Do you know anything?"
"Draco?" Seamus responded – full of disbelieve. "He's been gone for months. You got him expelled. Remember?"
Harry chuckled, drawing shaped in the blurry state; representing the ceiling. "Have you seen my glasses?"
"Don't," Harry threatened as he pointed at him. "Don't even start. You're a fucking snake. Your silver tongue will no longer work on me."
'Shut up, Potter,' Draco growled while pressing his body closer against those of Harry. 'I know this is exactly what you want.'
Harry chuckled under his breath - snorting as he wiped a tear away. Shaking his head in vain. "How? How are we going to get through this?"
Harry got up now, standing tightly with his body against those of Draco, and buried his lips in his neck as he tried to steady his breath.
A knocking noise caused Harry's heart to skip a beat, and pull back – resulting his head to bump against the tiled wall behind him. "Yeah?" he tried to start with some volume – though a stutter was noticeable in his raw voice.
"What are you going for, Malfoy?" He looked at him, his eyes filled with what seemed disappointment. "Is this a twisted way of getting back at me? For whatever I have done to you?"
The halls were stripped, yet by people. Only a few stayed around; and funny enough Harry appeared to be one of them. The Weasleys decided to go to Romania, on short-term, since Charlie could not make it home this year, and Ronald couldn't decline - wishing to see his bother all the same. Hermione, obviously, immediately got drawn back home - unable to stay with Harry alone, for he would get on her nerves now he'd been seeming so blue, and no matter... Harry did not seem to care as much. Hagrid and some others would stay as well, and the holidays could be a great opportunity to finally get him to some studying. His OWL's were merely floating in thin feathers, and Snape would not appreciate him failing at the defense of dark arts - knowing he'd get stuck with Potter for another bloody year. All the same, owls flew up and on delivering him mail - and like the years before the Christmas tree was to be surrounded by presents again. Two pair of itchy Gryffindor socks - knitted by Ronald's mom (in merely three years he could be dressed in those things from tip to toe) - and plenty of candy, comics, and a photocase with a picture of the three when all was still well.
Harry strongly avoided any eye contact. He didn't know why, but it seemed for the best. He could already sense the tension between the two of them. "That was a mistake," Harry muttered. "Only to mock you."
Hermione gasped for breath as she finally found some support by leaning against a wall, and after she hit Harry several times on his shoulder with her just-barrowed library book, she clenched her teeth to purse her lips highly unsatisfied after. 'Why on earth did you do that?'
"Things have to end, Harry," Draco simply responded, not having the nerve to turn back around. "I don't expect you to understand. I just want you to accept it." Draco gritted his teeth, wiping his runny nose with the him of his blouse - stretching his shoulders to adjust his attitude.
Harry shrugged, staring at the tip of his fancy black shoes. He felt ridiculous for coming here. For still caring at all.
Draco stood there, standing with a black eye and a chipped lower lip. Strange, how it appalled him – knowing he wasn't the cause of it. "Come on, tell me." His voice became raw. "Was it your dad?"
Draco growled, casting another spell towards Harry's appearance again (he was standing on a distance) but missed again, as if he meant to. Several vials and jars broke, and many dried frog eyes rolled over the floor - though they didn't come very far.
"Ah, well I got something that will surely cheer you up. Look at this." Ron fetched a folded article from under his pillow, and raised his brows by surprise – as if he'd never read it before. "Lucius Malfoy arrested after abusive manners." A smirk formed itself on his face. "Dipshit. He couldn't keep himself from venting his anger on mister Borgin. Apparently their deal is off. Curse him."
"Well, you shouldn't have," Harry mumbled as he jumped off the stone bench, yanking the tears off his cheek. He looked at her, questioning whether to speak, until he turned around and left.
"It is, isn't it?" Hermione sighed. "I want you to know that I respect that, Harry." She tried to move his face yet he pulled back - unwilling to look at her. "I'm so sorry I did not know so before. That I wasn't there for you."
Harry could no longer remember the moment he first noticed the change. He sat down in the fountain courtyard watching the leaves dance with the wind. His right leg twitched rapidly, unable to control his muscles now nervousness and doubt controlled him. He looked down at his paper note that contained catchwords in case he would forget what he was trying to imply. He still considered whether he should leave or not. If just for a couple of weeks. The headmaster would understand. Wouldn't he?
'Please, now finish me,' Draco dared to whisper as his cheeks turned more red. Harry moved his lips up to Draco's and kissed them gently to stroke his lips down his chest afterward. He made his way toward Draco's penis again, desiring for the unfinished climax he was about to manage in hopefully half a minute. In a flash, Harry moved his lips around his erection again, sucking him faster than he had before – apparently wanting to give Draco that blessing climax as well now.
"Afraid that I wouldn't?" Draco stood at the end of the stretched boathouse, - hands in his pockets while leaning against the wooden wall. Harry sighed deeply, chuckling under his breath as he walked closer.
"Tell me about Draco," Harry sighed as he dropped his attitude. He swallowed, hoping to make the following more easy to say, yet his voice was broken.
Harry made his leaving as quick as possible – almost afraid to look back, as if he thought to see it had all been a simple illusion. Though it wasn't even near nighttime yet, he claimed to go to bed anyways. If just to forget about what happened – for good. As both swallowing and breathing became almost impossible, he loosened his tie as well. With swift, tugging moves he pulled his buttons to open his cardigan, and with great hurry he rushed through the halls. He wanted to make his way up to the seventh floor – ready to hop into his dorms and vanish for the night. It was only then, right before meeting the painting on the wall, he saw Hermione and Ron standing to the side. They were kissing. Their lips touching, gasping for breath – hungrily – at every twist they made. Their eagerly grabbed for more, tugging their clothes as they went. Hermione groaned at Ron's touch, a smile tugging her lips as Ron made his way down her neck – characters making their way from their paintings, if just to snatch on ether one of them. It was almost sickening, how Harry stood there watching his best friends making out – he being the third wheel again. Standing there, Harry froze. His stomach twisting by jealousy; seeing the innocent bursting out of them. He wanted that too. He wanted to experience the same harmless, secret lovemaking. He wanted to be a part of it. Hermione, finally opening her eyes as Ron harked his teeth along the skin of her neck, spotted Harry on the stairs. She gasped for breath, unwell by the caught – and Harry stood there.
Harry took a deep breath as he wandered through the halls. He managed to find some ease on his own, yet his mind wasn't put to rest just yet. He had to find Draco. He had to know whether he was still around. Unfortunately entering the Slytherin dorms wasn't an option, and so he paced through the dungeons – hoping to find him there. Holding his advanced potion making book, he decided to read a little – hoping not to took too suspicious as he wandered around.
"You really have his back," Ron yawned as the three made their way towards transfiguration class. Harry shrugged, granting him a cheeky smile in return.
'But I am the chosen one,' Harry smirked in reply - what resulted another hit from Hermione with the book, but this time against his head. 'Okay, sorry.'
He slowly walked up to his blonde, crouching in front of him – ready to give him a hand. "Just stay out of my way, alright?"
Harry fetched his blouse from the floor – along with his other missing uniform parts. "That is what you wanted?" Harry straightened his back – noticing the buttons missing from his shirt – and cursed under his breath.
Harry bit his lower lip, his forehead covered in sweat while his body stuttered. Looking up at his companion, he pulled him up close – crushing his lips firmly onto his, wanting to take him whole. He would no longer wait. His body was covered in sweat, and his muscles were aching by desire. He wanted to have him. He wanted to share his first experiences with his blonde enemy, and he wanted to cover him whole in cum.
"I'm sorry," Harry exhaled as he closed his eyes. "I am lost. I have no clue what's going on with me."
The wood crackled under his boots. Here and there it seemed a little bit slippery, and right before reaching the open entrance Harry almost lost his balance.
Harry claimed for last night's encounter to be simply a dream. In fact he decided to visit several teachers today to ask around if anyone had any information about Malfoy. Was it true that he'd been expelled for months? He remembered a while ago when Draco visited him at the Masquerade, telling him so. But still? Would he come to visit, endangering himself just for him? To see Harry? It was impossible to hide a smile during the thought of that.
"It's all in your head," Draco replied softly - guiding Harry onto his back. Harry could no longer respond. He was asleep...
Harry pressed more kisses around the space above his boxer now, and kept stroking his thighs as some way of comforting.
"Seamus," Harry shouted, approaching his fellow student with a smile. "Seamus- Tell me you've seen Malfoy in the last five minutes."
'Hears about what? The way you decided to have your revenge by slapping me on the cheek? He'll feel ashamed. I assure you. You used a flattened hand.'
"We've only just started," Draco called as Harry made his way towards the exit. Harry clenched his jaws, annoyed by his weak encouragement to stay, and shook his head. "Go to bed, Malfoy. You're taking a piss."
"And?" Draco asked after a snort. Harry bowed his head, unable to speak – for he didn't understand what he was asking for.
"Probably just one of his creepy skull collections," Hermione muttered as he tugged Ron by the arm. "Does he have any?" Harry replied as he threw a glance at the golden haired girl. "Surely."
Draco looked up, frowning as he lowered his wand. He seemed offended. "No." Dropping his wand he kicked it to the side – vanishing beneath another's bed. "Now you prove it, that you're not up to no-good."
Harry shook his head – frowning his brows, unable to comprehend the answer. "No, I don't think so- I... If you see him tell him I'm looking for him, okay?"
Harry's legs didn't seem to understand the normal way of walking – his mind suffering from constant disruptions causing him to stop every time in a while. On his way walking past the Great Hall he interfered with various friends – leaving their concerns about Harry's disturbing appearance (tired and dirty). He scattered them away. Nothing seemed to matter. Not to him. No longer.
Harry frowned, deeply encouraged to do some more eavesdropping – knowing his friends were hiding something, if just for him. Where they in love? Perfect, he muttered to himself – they ecstasy was gone. He would be a third wheel from now on. However, something as small as that couldn't care for now. Besides, it would be a benefit. Hermione and Ron running off together, every once in a while – to do whatever they had to do... This meant he would have some time of his own. Precious minutes, ready to be spilled. Malfoy would be his project, for now. School could hardly keep him busy, knowing his head wandered off into clouds every now and then. First he had to know what it meant. What they meant. And how they could fix it. Draco, floating around his head like radiowaves. He couldn't concentrate. Malfoy seemed to have created another way of approaching him. Sending messages around, through the walls, giving him hints. It even seemed like he managed to slither into his dreams. Though Harry could find this hardly unpleasant, for some kind of odd reason, it did keep him awake at night. If not in cold sweat, it would be by utter excitement – ready to ask for more. There was something up with this blonde-haired boy, and he had to know what. Hoping to find him outside, leaning against a tree, sitting on the grass – hopefully on his own – but in vain. He wasn't there.
Today was Halloween. The chatter and laughter had become louder, and tricks were done all through the day. Tonight there would be a ball. Hermione got them their outfits, and though Harry hadn't seen them yet, he wasn't as keen too either. Ronald still lived his lie, leaving Hermione clueless according to the situation – and funnily enough Harry seemed to be more sorry than he was. However, he couldn't get tangled in between them. He finally had his friends back. No matter how it could break them, as the golden trio, he was selfish enough not wanting to lose the both of them again – for now he felt lonelier than ever.
"It must be here somewhere," he muttered as he crouched in front of the drawer. After some pulls he realized it was well locked, and there would be no way to open it unless they owned the key. Snape would be far too intelligent to leave his property easy to theft. No spell in their possession would work. "it's locked."
"Well fuck you too," Harry snapped at him, getting up from his desk to move to another seat. He wasn't ready to talk to them. Not now.
"Now what?" Harry muttered once he sat down at the top, his back resting against the ever so cold bricks. "Enlighten me."
Dumbledore rose from his chair that very moment, raising Harry's attention by a gesture. Harry cursed under his breath. His stomach needed at least a bit of content before he was ready to continue the day, and so he grabbed an apple – stuffing it in his pocket.
The crowd looked from afar - great worry coming from their faces, and a perfect, Harry could not extinguish, asked them all to leave. Harry cried and gasped for breath as several nurses came running in and were asked to keep him down.
Not more than three seconds after Draco's begging, he climaxed – pouring out a large amount of seed over the blonde his lips, cheek, jaw and chin. Draco inhaled deeply, licking his lips slowly to get the bitter taste on his tongue from his companion's precious cum. He acted like it was the whipped cream on a birthday cake. After cleaning up the spaces he couldn't reach with his tongue with his fingers, he licked it off them as well – searching for Harry's face after who still panted and groaned while stroking one of his hands roughly but caring through Draco's hair.
Fear and anger gripped Harry like a glove and tears began to spill from his eyes. This was all Ron’s fault.
“Harry is coming with me, that’s what going on here.” Draco explained without looking away from the mop of dark hair resting on his chest. “We’ll just get his things and be on our way.”
Harry nodded and leaned up a little for another kiss before Draco took a step back and left before he decided he couldn’t do it.
The blonde pulled the smaller boy back to him and held him reassuringly. “Tell me what happened.” He said gently.
“Yes, and about that,” He turned toward Draco, “I’ve only heard mention of fathers, plural, nothing about a mother. Care to explain?”
We just want you to know that we don’t blame you for what our idiot brother did. Everyone knows Ron has always been jealous of you. We just didn’t know he would ever go this far. George and I hope you feel better soon.
“I thought that if Lucius found out after my son was born, he’d see him and instantly fall in love with him since it would have been his grandchild, after all. Two months, that’s how close I was to being a father before my life went to hell.” He said as he tried to stop the tears forming in his eyes.
Before Harry could move much, Draco lifted the back of his shirt and could clearly see where the blood was coming from, but there was more than just blood. There was also dried semen.
Draco smiled down at his boyfriend. “I’m not really sure yet. Maybe run a business. What about you Harry?”
With a very naughty idea suddenly planted in his head, Harry slowly turned over in the blonde’s embrace and pulled the thin sheet that was keeping them apart off of himself. He then slipped his lightly trembling hands under the silver comforter and gripped the base of Draco's erection.
Harry laughed heartily. “Oh, that’s what you’re on about? I thought it was something serious. Or, bad, at least.”
In another place, in a beautiful manor, a young, blonde man was reading the morning paper as he sipped a cup of coffee. He immediately noticed the picture of a familiar black-haired boy fidgeting and staring nervously at the camera.
“First of all Harry, I would like you to know that Professor Dumbledore contacted me last night and gave me the basics of what happened. He would like me to come see you at least once a week depending on how I feel you’re progressing. I hope you’re alright with that.” Emma explained.
Running a hand through his hair, the blonde reluctantly turned away from the barrier and went back to his mother.
“Wait…” The brunette suddenly murmured, only two buttons in. He then grabbed the edges of Draco’s shirt and pulled, the remaining buttons flying off in random directions. He looked up at the panting blonde. “Was that okay?” He asked when he was met with silence.
A crinkling sound caught the attention of the two men. “What’s in the bag?” Draco asked as he rose from the couch and approached his son.
“Come on; just admit you had fun, Sev.” Sirius goaded as the pair of dark-haired men approached the door to number 12 Grimmauld Place.
Ten minutes later Dumbledore, McGonagall, Snape, and Pomfrey were congregated around a still unconscious Ron in the headmaster’s office.
The very experienced medi-witch wasn’t so sure she believed him but she had no reason to think otherwise and went about healing this newly revealed injury.
Harry nudged Draco's knees apart with his own so he could lie between them more comfortably. He continued from the blonde’s neck to nip at his collar bone before moving straight down to a pink nipple and lapping at it. His other hand made its way down past their erections and two fingers slid inside the still stretched hole, just to double check.
Draco was getting worried. Potions class had started ten minutes ago and neither Harry nor the weasel had shown up yet. He knew that somewhere in the castle, something terrible was happening. Against his first instinct though, Draco decided to wait five more minutes before going to look for Harry. He ended up not being able to wait that long though.
Every so often, he’d pull back far enough that the head of his cock would push against Harry's entrance when he slid forward again. Each time this happened, a small gasp would escape Harry, each one louder than the one before it.
Having been given permission to do what he liked, Harry climbed up on it and bounced a little. He watched the bedspread ripple out from his feet like ripples in a pond. He then jumped once, landed on his butt, and purposely fell back so he would move with the bed.
Harry suddenly pulled out of his grip, wide-eyed, and said quietly, “Not here.” He took a hold of Draco's hand and dragged him up the stairs to his bedroom.
“Ron woke me up and he was angry. He pulled me into the shower and smacked me. I made sure to do everything he asked so he wouldn’t hurt me as badly as he usually does. He still has to hit me though, every time.” Harry explained as he tried to calm down.
Eyes still held tightly shut, face pressed deeply into the sterile pillow, Harry began crying. He groped blindly for his comfort, for Draco, only to start panicking when his fingers found empty space beside him. ‘
Harry quickly schooled his expression to one of amusement. “There’s that bratty son of mine.” He replied with a grin.
“Dad!” Draco shouted after he finished reading Harry's letter. It had been sitting on his desk for over a week now but he’d been too afraid and too busy wallowing in self-pity to open it. Only innate curiosity of the unknown finally convinced him to read it.
Draco’s eyes widened and he dashed forward. “What? Really? Where?” He placed his hands on Harry’s belly.
Harry picked up the parcel he knew would be his own Weasley sweater and block of fudge. Sure enough, he tore open the brown paper to find a black sweater with a shimmery green ‘H’ adorning the chest. Slipping his sweater onto his naked torso, he was pleasantly surprised to find cakes hidden within instead of fudge. Molly likely figured the pair would share.
“That’s part of it…” Draco trailed off. He didn’t want Harry to hate him for the rest of what was causing his fear.
A few minutes later, two sets of hurried footsteps were heard in the corridor through the partially open door.
“Now wait just a second.” Harry stepped between the other two males. “Draco, we need to talk about this.”
Like the good little “house wife” Harry was sure he was expected to be, he turned toward his intended. But he wouldn’t look at him.
“You’re glowing, Harry.” A fifth year Ravenclaw girl said in passing. This pattern continued until the two boys were settled into a carriage.
“Are you ok with me taking off my boxers, too?” Draco carefully asked once Harry was naked. While he didn’t mind not having a sexual relationship with Harry, he did want him to be comfortable enough to have one someday, even if it wasn’t with him.
“He’s a what, now?” Harry asked, eyes going wide with shock. “A muggle?” He then started giggling in a slightly hysterical matter. “I’m sorry, Scorpius. I know it’s not funny, but you just seem to have a horrible combination of circumstances.”
“Draco, not-” He was interrupted by a passionate kiss from his husband. “Not. Here.” He finally managed to pant.
The hand Harry was watching started moving back and forth as if it was trying to alleviate some sort of discomfort. “Are you ok?” Harry asked without looking away from the hand.
Draco pulled Harry away from him and looked him in the eye. “How can you say that weasel is your best friend? He beats you, Harry, and worse! You need to tell someone. He deserves to be locked up in Azkaban.”
Draco slumped back against his husband’s chest and sighed. “No, Harry I’m not mad, just frustrated.” He said quietly.
“Now that that’s settled, I’ll let you get back to your visit.” Dumbledore said, his eyes twinkling happily. He quickly stood and left the room.
“I… I—” Harry was cut off when Draco suddenly thrust hard into him, jabbing his prostate. “Ooooh. I love you too!” He shouted.
Managing a tiny smile, Harry replied, “I love you, too.” He barely had the words out before he was pulled into a fierce good-bye kiss, earning them some unseen glares from parents for such a public display of affection.
hate you. If you don’t want to speak to him though, you don’t have to. And don’t worry about anything he might say. He’s not quite stupid enough to say something in front of your brothers and sisters. I’m going to talk to him about it tonight so we’re all on the same page. Ok?”
Blech, I wasn't very fond of writing this chapter or the next. I can't really stand het anymore because so much of it is far too fan-girly. I don't know why I don't like my own, but, whatever.
After giving them a few minutes of privacy, Madam Pomfrey returned and set up the screens around Harry's bed. Then she transfigured her patient’s pajamas into a hospital gown.
“Oh, fuck yes.” She moaned loudly as she gripped Draco's shoulders tightly to use as leverage to help lift herself.
Scorpius didn’t like any part of that plan. He didn’t want to have to tell Ethan anything and he certainly didn’t want him to be obliviated, but he knew all of it was necessary. He nodded feebly, indicating his agreement.
It became sloppy as Draco's concentration was torn between Harry and trying to get the jar open one-handed.
“Well I’ll take care of that when we get home but right now, I think you’re mentally scarring your family.” Draco said with a small chuckle.
Both men had been unaware of Draco's presence before that and they looked at him as if he’d grown an extra head.
“Second richest.” The blonde stated through a wince. “I heard enough bitching about “That Potter Kid” from my father to know he’s angry about not being number one. You ever heard of him?”
The dark-haired boy sighed. “I was thinking you wouldn’t let me. I figured when you finally noticed, it would be too late anyway and you’d let me keep them.” He whined.
Draco let out an appreciative moan and leaned against the shower wall in front of him so he wouldn’t have to support all his weight on his legs that were slowly turning to jelly under Harry's skillful hands.
“Nonsense. You’re covered in bruises and your best friend is lying unconscious five feet from you.” She said firmly.
Just as the blonde girl was about to push the door open, Scorpius brought his arms up to rest on the toilet seat and began sobbing into them. The sight scared Emma. She’d seen any and all emotions from the sulky teen but she’d never seen him outright cry before.
Draco sat up a little straighter and gently turned Harry's head more towards him. Then he placed a short, chaste kiss on Harry's lips.
“That’s right.” Draco announced to the room. “Everything you’ve read in the papers and magazines has been a lie. Harry didn’t want any of this. He was sold when he was sixteen.”
“The call came from an abortion clinic.” Draco's jaw dropped. “By the time she came home a few hours later, I’d hired some movers to get her stuff out of my house and had destroyed half of this room. I had also changed all the locks. I haven’t spoken to her since she left the house that morning.
In an instant, Harry felt as if he was wrapped in chains before it seemed to sink into his body and the feeling disappeared. He wondered if Emma had felt it too.
Harry had fallen asleep only two hours later and didn’t wake up until the train had jerked particularly hard a little over an hour before they were to arrive at King’s Cross. They spent the rest of the time cuddled up with Harry straddling Draco's lap.
“Then I started thinking about how much easier it would have been for me and all the muggle-born students if we’d had someplace to teach us things about the wizarding world, like the fact that wizards can get pregnant. That would have been really nice to know beforehand.” Harry explained.
Meanwhile, the blonde teen was ravishing his unresponsive mouth. The one-sided kiss continued as Draco brought a hand down to cup the raven’s crotch. He couldn’t help but smile when he discovered that Harry was actually half hard already.
Once they were on the road again, Harry pulled a piece of parchment and a quill out of the knapsack he hadn’t put in his trunk and put his baggie of food in it. He immediately scribbled down his extreme disdain of how his summer had gone so far. If it weren’t for his relatives, he would have used the mirror and talked to Draco face to face. A letter would have to do for now.
Immediately, Draco pressed the head of his cock against Harry’s pucker, the ring of muscle giving way instantaneously. He slowly pushed forward until their hips were flush against each other. Then he waited a moment for the other boy to get used to the intrusion.
“Going with you?” Vernon sputtered. Draco nodded. “He’s leaving.” Another nod from the blonde. “Forever?”
Harlot moaned as he rubbed a little harder before coming back to herself and glaring at him. “If you don’t get the bloody hell on with it, I will leave.” She threatened with a tone of voice and a look in her eye that seemed eerily familiar to him, but he just couldn’t seem to place at the moment.
“Alright then. I suppose I shouldn’t try to force you.” She said as she picked up the empty vials. Pomfrey disappeared into her office for a few minutes. When she returned, it was with a book in hand.
“I’m not.” The blonde held up the baby gift he was still holding to show that the wrapping paper was still intact. “Just looking.”
Once he was fully sheathed, Harry sat back up and positioned a pale leg over his shoulder. Draco automatically pulled the other one up to his chest and waited for the onslaught of pleasure to begin.
The blonde man moaned into Harry’s ear and lowered his body closer. His hips started picking up speed, nearly slamming against the other’s body.
“The library?” Draco joked, then added, “No, if Granger’s half as smart as she seems, she’s going to scrub herself inside and out.”
Again Harry nodded. He was quiet for a few minutes as he tried to think of where he wanted to start.
Ron fell sideways and slightly forward, luckily missing Harry, the side of his head smacking into the corner of the dark-stained end table next to the bed. He landed on the floor and remained motionless.
Turning his head toward them, Harry stuck out his tongue and, with a big grin, said, “You’re all just jealous.”
“’m sorry.” Harry mumbled as he wiped at the puddle of tears and other fluids that had accumulated on the blonde’s chest with his sleeve.
Harry’s erection twitched against sheets in interest as Draco’s cock prodded his stretched entrance. “How badly do you want my cock, Potter?” He asked.
Finally, Scorpius felt his orgasm building once again. “I’m close.” He breathed between harsh kisses.
It was silent for a few minutes and Harry was nearly asleep again when a hand touched his thigh before sliding up it. The touches were so light though that they didn’t disturb him. The hand gripped his already half hard cock and started stroking it to full size.
“Yeah, the twenty-fourth.” He said sadly. “He took an entire month off work. I can’t imagine how bad it might be this time.”
“Fine. I’m a male prostitute, happy?” He asked sarcastically. “But you don’t know me and you don’t know my situation. So don’t just stand there and judge me.”
For the third time since Draco found him, Harry burst into tears. This time though, he collapsed onto the other and cried for several minutes.
Harry grabbed his wand that he had dropped and stood up. He quickly cast a silencing charm on the room before making sure the door was locked. It wouldn’t do to have two impressionable five year olds walk in on them. He turned back to his husband and paused to take in the sight before him.
Without a single thought, the bound man leaned forward and pushed the answer button with his nose. “Draco! Ron’s here. He came back and tried to hurt me again! Please, come home!” Harry sobbed into the phone as another contraction hit him.
“Okay.” The blonde took the parcel and tore it open. “It’s just a rattle, love.” He gave the object a small shake, only to start when it began to vibrate on its own. Draco pointed it away from his face just in time for colorful sparks to shoot out accompanied by, “Congratulations, Harry and Draco!” Chorused in Fred and George’s voices.
When he finally managed to compose himself, he looked back up at Draco and asked, “What… who are the others?”
Harry wiped his sweaty palms on his pajama pants as he made his way down the corridor. He checked the time before unfolding a piece of a parchment he was carrying and re-reading the short note.
“You’re being flippant.” Draco stated. “We’re nearly thirty-five years old and we already have a grandchild. I don’t think we need any more little ones running around here for a long time to come.”
Harry's thoughts wandered back to the night before in the prefect’s bathroom and how amazing it had been. He had never gotten off on another person’s touch before and he was greatly looking forward to doing it again.
After a short elevator ride, the small group arrived at the fourth floor. Almost immediately, they were approached by a short woman with a floating stretcher.
“You know, Harry, despite how today ended, I think I’d like to hang out again sometime. Maybe even go on a date?” The blonde man suggested.
Draco kicked his shoes off before slipping under the covers and cuddling up with Harry, chest to chest.
“Wait a second, what was that?” Draco noticed something glinting in Scorpius’ dark hair when the light from Harry’s wand had passed over his head.
But you know what the irony is, he won’t be able to. Not for a while at least. You see, I’m already pregnant. I know because I have all the symptoms. I’m just lucky that my muggle relatives are stupid and think it’s “wedding jitters” or something like that.
Draco smirked up at him and replied with, “Yeah, but I’m your whore.” He flicked his tongue over one hardened nub before immediately sliding farther down Harry’s body and sucking the erection he found there into his mouth.
Dumbledore wrote us this morning and told us what’s been going on. I’m so sorry Harry. But you really should have told someone sooner.
“Because they match the dress.” Draco replied with a roll of his eyes, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. “But that’s part of
Remus rolled his eyes in annoyance. “They aren’t like puppies, Sirius. Babies need constant care at any and all hours of the day and you can’t just give it away if you decide it’s too hard or you don’t want it anymore. It’s for life or not at all and you’ve never been the best with commitment.”
Despite the fact that he was a boy, Scorpius grabbed a nearby towel to cover his naked torso as he exclaimed, “Lily! What do you want?”
“Is that really necessary? You seem just fine to me.” Sirius said, earning him an elbow in the ribs from Remus.
“Give me your hand.” The older boy gently ordered. Ethan took the offered appendage and flipped it palm up. Then he squirted a little lube into. Lastly, he guided the hand toward his own raging hard on.
The pair laid together in an amiable silence for long enough that Harry nearly fell asleep. He was only pulled back to awareness when pale, nimble fingers found their way to his semi-soft cock. He looked down their bodies to see Draco was already standing at attention.
Worried, the two men rushed up the stairs, following the sounds of coughing. They reached a door they recognized as Harry’s and flung it open.
“Of course, whatever you want.” Harry whispered into blonde hair. “When they discharge you, we’ll pick up the boys before going home. Then we can all cuddle up and spend the day in bed.”
Once inside, he flicked on the light and was surprised to find a prone, female figure on his floor. He quickly recognized it as, “Monica,” he spat.
“I know. I don’t want you to either.” Draco said and held him a little tighter. “In a month, it’ll just be you and me.”
Draco drew his brows together. “I don’t like that.” He stated his disproval over the disappearance of his child.
After a few minutes, Draco went about preparing his lover’s waiting hole. He pulled lube from the bedside table and immediately stuck two fingers inside of Harry. The brunette man moaned deeply and pressed himself down on the familiar intrusion.
“Hmm, I’d like to examine your birth canal, just to be safe.” The witch said as she stood from her seat. “Please, remove your pants.”
Harry woke up the next morning with cold stone beneath him and a warm body behind him. For a minute he had trouble remembering why he was on the floor. He smiled when it came back to him though.
Draco turned towards the morose brunette. “I’ll make sure he doesn’t come back if you don’t want him to.” He said quietly.
“Well, my story’s not nearly as long, or interesting, as yours. A few years ago I started dating my best friend’s younger sister, Ginny. It was great except for the part where I was ready to settle down, start a family and she wasn’t. We were dating for two years before she ever even moved in with me but she wasn’t actually around most of the time.
good scream.” He explained. “Remember what I said about what makes it feel so good when two guys are together?”
When Sirius and Remus arrived on Christmas Eve though, Draco had to make himself scarce. Harry had told him that he didn’t think Sirius would take it too well that he was friends with a Slytherin, let alone a Malfoy.
Harry dragged a hand through his hair and sighed. “You’re right. You want a ride to the police station or the hospital?”
“Harry… what are you saying? That you wish our life together hadn’t happened?” The blonde man asked.
He couldn’t think, he could barely breathe. But that could have been more physical than mental. Shocked, Harry fell back onto the stretcher.
“Do you want me to?” Draco asked warily. “I thought it would freak you out sleeping in the same bed with another guy.”
“No. I have to pass this potions test or Snape’s going to give me detention. Again.” Harry said with his head in his hands.
Harry bit his lip in thought and glanced between the two items. While he wanted it to be done as painlessly as possible, he also wanted to feel everything that went with it. He pointed to the jar.
“He found out.” Harry said through his crying. “He was making fun of me, saying I was getting fat. Then he poked me and I guess he noticed what it was. He asked if I was pregnant. I said no but everyone knows I’m not a good liar.”
“I highly doubt it’ll come to that.” Draco said. “I think we’d both agree that the next one will be planned.”
“Now then, for the next month, I would you like to meet with Ms. Haysley every Wednesday night at seven o’clock. At the end of the fourth session, the three of us will decide how often you should continue meeting with her. It could stay the same or be reduced but we won’t make you see her more often than you like.” Dumbledore explained.
“Tomorrow’s Sunday, which means there’s no classes. I don’t see why not.” Draco answered with a bright smile.
The next morning, Draco's sleep was disturbed once again by Harry struggling in his arms. At first, he thought Harry was having some sort of panic attack.
“What?!” Ron yelled, jumping out of his seat. “That git beat me into unconsciousness. I can only imagine what he did to Harry!”
Harry was about to jerk away or push the other off of him, when the hand on his knee suddenly slid up his leg and cupped his crotch. When it started rubbing him through his jeans, he felt absolutely mortified that his body reacted.
“It’s adjustable.” Draco said as he reached behind Harry's neck and shortened it. “It’s not really for being looked at. You need to be able to feel it so you should probably keep it under your robes.” He finished.
Finally, the door to the compartment slid open and a head of stringy, dirty blonde hair adorned with a pair of spectrespecs popped in. “Hello, Draco.” Luna said dreamily. “Oh, I see Harry’s asleep.” She slid the specs down over her eyes. “Probably for the best. He’s surrounded by wrackspurts”
Ethan knelt down so the dark-haired boy could see his niece. “She’s squishy.” He said with a small giggle.
Draco looked at his husband over their son’s dark head. “It’s the twenty-first century, Harry. They can co-parent without being in a relationship.”
Harry giggled and Draco smirked at Sirius' ridiculous reasoning for seeing the two boys so close. The man sank into the other chair next to Remus.
Before picking him up, Harry adjusted the boy’s jacket and pulled the hood over his head to ensure he’d stayed dry until they were in the house. Then he carefully scooped him up, shut the door, and ran toward the door that Draco was just reaching. By the time Harry got there, it was unlocked and being held open for him.
“It’s nice to meet you both.” The woman stated as she sat in a lovely wingback chair. The teens sat opposite her on a small love seat.
Harry's smile was sad now. He’d forgotten his friend as well but for completely different reasons. He hadn’t had the time to remember.
When Harry was through the barrier, he stopped and tightened his grip on the cart until his knuckles cracked. It was all he could do to keep himself from abandoning his stuff and going back after Draco.
Very carefully, Draco adjusted the infant so that he was holding him with just one arm but still had a secure grip and was supporting his head properly. He then reached down with his free hand and pushed Harry's fringe out of his eyes.
“The last time he… you were there, you told me you might need glasses. I laughed and said that glasses were yucky.” Draco said with a small smile on his face. Harry released a breath and couldn’t help the laughter that rose out of him.
“One’s from Fred and George and the other’s from your mum.” Harry said, mostly directed at Ginny. He tore open the one from the twins as Draco sat back down on the bed. He read it to himself and then aloud:
“Oh.” Harry looked at Madam Pomfrey. “I suppose that’s why you didn’t ask if that was an option for me, not that it is.” He gave Draco a reassuring smile when he felt the other’s hand tighten around his own.
“He kept abusing you just because he couldn’t get off with Granger. He deserves to die.” His voice laced with anger.
Harry nodded vigorously into the pale chest in front of him and desperately clutched his back. “Please.”
Most likely, the next time you see me will be on the train for school and I’ll be a married man. Harry Harrison… you think he’ll let me keep my last name? I doubt it. This bastard would probably make me change my first name.
“Is something wrong?” Draco asked as his hips stopped undulating. He propped himself up on his elbow so he could lean over the smaller boy.
“Really? Because James would have just accepted that he was cute instead of whining and insisting he was a handsome young man.” Harry countered. “And which one of you is always pulling pranks on us?”
Draco fumbled for an answer before finally replying with, “Because you didn’t have anyone to teach you any better.” He hadn’t even finished speaking when he realized that was, absolutely, the
“Are you sure you want to do this now, Harry?” Draco asked quietly as the blonde woman came into view. “I can always tell her everything later so she can get used to the idea before you come live with us.”
“My father disinherited me because I’m gay.” He stated gruffly. “That’s the short version anyway, but I’m sure you’d like more specifics.” Harry nodded.
Harry sighed. “Yeah, I guess. I’m just… disappointed.” Then he added as an afterthought, “And horny.”
Harry was sitting in the entrance hall on top of his trunk, waiting for the carriages with a few other students. Most of them were already outside, but some of them stayed inside to get out of the hot son.
Harry stirred at the sound of the soft voices. “Are we there yet?” He mumbled and wiped a small amount of drool from his lips.
“They were trying to come up with some way to help repopulate wizardkind without resorting to crossbreeding, that’s how they stated it, with muggles.
“They do.” Draco replied. “This is Lily and Emma. Emma, Lily, this is your grandfather.” He reluctantly introduced them.
Aside from the upcoming nuptials, which will be invitation only, the pair of young lovers has a wonderful announcement to make: they are expecting a child to be born at the beginning of next year, early 1998.
The moment Draco signed his name; the parchment folded itself up and took off. He watched it zoom around the room before it flew out an open window.
The dark-haired teen looked at his fairer-haired husband. Draco shook his head, indicating he had nothing to add or ask.
The dark-haired boy nodded and went to pull up his shirt when he remembered it was the only thing covering him.
Harry moaned against Draco’s neck as the paler body slid above his own. One of his hands gripped a tight bicep while the other moved to hold on to the other’s side.
When his balls were pressed firmly against Harry’s firm arse, he waited just a few seconds before gradually pulling back out. He slide back in and started slow, but firm pace.
“Fine.” Harry said slamming his book shut. He nearly jumped out of his chair when he looked up to see the other’s face mere inches away from his own.
Draco laughed, partly at Harry’s words and partly at his son’s adorableness. “I see; now you’re Mr. Baby Expert.”
“That’s what contraceptive charms are for, damn it.” Draco said in a harsher tone of voice than Harry would have expected.
Harry looked down at Draco to see that he was asleep. “Well my first pregnancy was a surprise. We were still in school, actually. I miscarried though. We got married after we graduated and surprise, surprise, I ended up pregnant with James and Scorpius… on our honeymoon.”
After Harry had been gone a couple minutes, Draco made his own way toward the Great Hall. Most of the student body was already present but he could still make out Harry's hair in the crowd. It helped that the brunette was sitting at the end of the table closest to him. He looked at him sadly as he turned toward the Slytherin table.
Before leaving the room, he checked on the baby already in his crib. The infant was obviously fighting sleep pretty hard, but it wouldn’t be long before he’d succumb to the sandman.
Immediately, one of Draco’s hands flew to Harry’s belly and began feeling for any movement. A few seconds later, he felt a soft thump under his hand.
Before he knew what he was doing, Harry was walking over to the still motionless blonde and was taking off his glasses. They slipped from his fingers and smashed on the floor. “Look at me, really look at me, and tell me you don’t know who I am.” He whispered and grabbed the sides of Draco's head. He brought their faces close together so they could look directly into each other’s eyes, Harry on his toes to be level.
“Hmm…” Harlot pretended to think for a moment. “Nope! Now, fuck me.” Draco was only happy to comply.
Harry left first and Draco watched him go with a frown. He didn’t like being secretive about their relationship anymore. They both agreed it was a good idea at first, but now, Draco wanted everyone to know who Harry belonged to and that he belonged to him as well.
“Time to go.” Draco said as he got up from his comfy seat. He picked up his bag from the floor near the bed and walked toward the door. Harry slowly followed suit.
Draco rested his forehead against Harry's abdomen and bit his lip, trying to control his teenage body. He was pulled back to the task at hand when something jabbed him in the butt.
“What was this about?” Draco asked, confused but less angry now. “Why did you trick into having sex with you?”
The blonde woman looked from Draco to Harry, who was anxiously biting his lip, and then dropped her gaze to his stomach where one of his hands was resting. “Please, tell me he’s not pregnant?” She practically begged.
When two weeks had passed, Draco began asking around about her but no one seemed to know who she was. He began fearing for his sanity.
“Sure.” The blonde replied hesitantly, thinking this guy had to be nuts to just hand his keys to a stranger.
Once that task was finished, Draco washed his hands and then stood in front of the mirror. He lifted up his night shirt, the only thing he was wearing, and turned to the side. Just over three months into his pregnancy and he was already starting to show.
As Harry reemerged from the bathroom, Madam Pomfrey came out of her office. She gave him a sympathetic look of understanding before gesturing for him to sit on the bed he had vacated in his haste.
Harry moved into the room to stand next to Draco. He crouched down before replying, “I thought about what we talked about and okay. Let’s do it.”
Instantly, he jumped back up from the bed, having sat in something wet. Almost immediately it occurred to him. “Are you in labor?”
As the kiss became more heated, Harry used his hold on Draco to pull them as close together as they could get. His hands moved down from the middle of the blonde’s back to grip his arse and pushed their groins together so Draco could feel just how much he wanted him.
Harry took a right turn at the next stop sign and was just starting to get back up to speed, when someone ran out of an alley and tripped in the middle of his lane.
Next to him, Draco had one hand in his and the other soothingly running through raven locks, repeating things like, “You’re almost there, Harry. It’s almost over.”
The pair fell silent as Draco finally extracted himself from the bed and began to redress himself. Harry joined him in his task.
It was getting late, nearly 10 o’clock as Harry Potter made his way home from work. The sun had gone down hours before and the road was wet with early spring rain.
“Not nearly hard enough.” Draco sighed. A thought suddenly occurred to him and he pulled Harry off his lap so they were sitting next to each. Turning toward the brunette and glancing at his stomach, he asked, “Didn’t you say you’re pregnant?”
The young Malfoy frowned at his boyfriend of nearly twelve hours. He didn’t have a clue what he was supposed to do now. He’d never seen anyone so depressed. For now all he could really do was be there for Harry and hope it was enough.
Even walking slowly, it didn’t take nearly long enough to get to the barrier. They stopped off to the side so they weren’t in the way of other students and parents crossing into the muggle world.
Now that the other two had shut up, Draco brought a hand to Harry's exposed cheek and tilted his head up so they were looking at each other. “Are you ok?” He asked softly.
“I do care about you, Harry. I had to get ready for class. I was hoping I’d be back in here before you woke up. I’m sorry I didn’t wake you first.” Draco said sweetly.
Draco sighed in relief. There were only a few bruises this time and most of them were already fading.
“I’m… I’m sorry, Harry. I just saw you on the floor like that and I assumed the worst.”  The man rambled as he dealt with the fact he just seriously injured an innocent man.
“It’s also a Potter. Just like with our hair, my genes might beat out yours. I hate to break it to you, babe, but dark wins over light.” Harry responded with a sarcastic sigh.
Once they were full to bursting, Draco paid the bill, after much protesting from Harry, and they ventured back out into the chilly February afternoon. They made a trip down the street between the shops before Harry decided to drag Draco into Honeydukes.
Harry moaned and his hips jerked forward into Draco's hand when his lips descended on him. His mouth then dropped open as his body tried to decide if he wanted to grind back against the other cock or thrust forward into the hand.
Draco looked at Harry in confusion before his expression changed to one of complete shock. Two seconds after that, a shout of, “Daddy!” had Harry whipping around in surprise. He’d never been called that by Scorpius. The toddler had only just started to be okay with calling him Papa Harry, never Daddy though because he already had one.
Draco couldn’t help but to smirk up at the frustrated brunette. He placed a wet kiss on the inside of Harry's thigh before sliding back up to be face to face with him.
Over the next few weeks, Draco and Harry started getting a lot closer. They’d eat meals in Draco's room and study together in the library when Ron wasn’t around.
“Tsk, tsk.” Draco chided and he teasingly pulled his hips away from hers. One of his hands slid over the top of her thigh and pushed one finger into where she wanted his dick to be before moving up and running lightly over her clit, causing her breath to hitch.
Draco shrugged and pushed his hair back. “I don’t know, but you have money and power. That’s where people like my father come from.”
At that moment, there was a sniffle and a sob from the occupied bed. Harry immediately jumped up from his chair and rushed over to his husband.
Harry managed to suppress a laugh but shook his head a little as they walked to the other bed. “I’m not used to being called that. At Hogwarts I go by Potter to avoid the confusion.”
Harry watched as the flames surrounding the contract died out once again. He couldn’t remember how many times he’d tried it since his birthday a few days ago and he only grew more and more depressed each time it didn’t work.
The slightly younger man hurried over to his nearly catatonic husband and sat on the edge of the bed. Gray eyes flicked up to his face for a moment before going back to stare at a spot on the blindingly white wall.
“Love you too.” He replied with his own smile. Hearing this, Draco had a sudden longing to hear those words, in that voice aimed at himself.
The blonde man abruptly remembered their deal to tell each other their stories. “You wanted to know why I do what I do and I told you. It’s your turn. How is it you have my son?”
One long soak in bubble filled water later, Harry felt decidedly better, only now he was very tired and ready for a nap. That had been the only reason he got out of the tub to begin with. It wouldn’t do to fall asleep and drown, Draco would kill him.
“I don’t think that will be necessary, Poppy. But I would like you to accompany me to my office so that you can examine Mr. Weasley. I’d like to talk to him myself before contacting the ministry.” Professor Dumbledore said.
When he turned to look at the other door to the room, green eyes widen a bit when they landed on the person that woke him up. In a flash, images of long forgotten memories flitted through his brain and Harry was wide awake.
Harry started to stand up, his face red in either anger or humiliation. “Well you were the one who was late.” He muttered heatedly. “If you’d been here at 8 we’d have been done shagging by now and we’d both be sated.”
Harry felt some of his tension ease. Knowing he had a way out if he so chose made him feel more secure in his decision. “No, I want to. I just…” He trailed off and took a deep breath.
The conversation Harry's aunt and cousin were having floated in through the door that Eric had never bothered to close when he left. He allowed the sound to go in and out of focus in his mind until he heard the doorbell ring.
“Uh… yeah.” He replied and looked away from her to stare blankly at the table. That was probably the best he’d be able to do for now.
“What’s going on?” Though the words were muffled by the cloth in his mouth, apparently it was clear enough.
It was Tuesday, classes had just started up again after Christmas Holiday the day before and Harry had been confined to their rooms as he was ready to pop any day. The only thing that made it slightly better, was the fact that he wasn’t in the hospital wing.
Snape did not reply. He simply stood there for a couple of seconds until he turned away - folding the edges of his sleeves as a part of grooming.
"Are you going to leave?" Harry asked at last. A vein pounded right under the upper skin of his forehead, heavily visible. Draco didn't respond. He stared at his feet, defeated. It was like he was shrinking by utter shame. "Answer me," Harry cried, spit leaving his mouth unintentionally. Draco looked at him. His judging eyes stung Harry as they met, and he rubbed his cheekbone, right under his black eye. He hissed, as if forgotten he had any of the bruises at all, and batted his eyes again – trying to gather words from afar.
Funny, how Harry decided to keep his mouth shut once he managed to find his way back to his original destination. Without giving a proper clarification about his messy looks, he simply walked along with his confidential musketeers, buying the stuff they needed for the next week. School was about to start again, and how coincidental for him to meet the one person he'd been trying to avoid for months on his very first day of fixing his school supplies. As if they were meant to meet. Harry couldn't get him out of his head. How forceful and confident Malfoy had been. Something new. Something invigorating. There was something about this boy, something different – and he couldn't quite put his finger on it. Thinking about their encounter, months ago, his lips started to burn – a familiar smell raising some sort of excitement to keep his breath off edge, his heartbeat speeding at the thought of it.
A penetrating voice made both of the boys flinch. Professor Snape stood at the end of the steps, listening – his eyes piercing up through their shadows.
"I-" Harry stammered breathlessly, his eyes begging for Draco to turn and look, "I just don't understand," he responded nonetheless.
"Well, I saw someone sitting from miles away." Harry smiled painfully. "Didn't think it was you at first though."
Lunch was served at the Great Hall. Every Gryffindor was blessed with a great mood now Harry had managed to capture the Golden Snitch the other day, and Gryffindor caught up with Slytherin – the lions now shining on first place, as it should. Hermione and Ron were sitting now both at another side of Harry, plucking his hair as he ate – imitating weaklings of some animal sort. Harry laughed, being merry for his friends were back – deciding to cut their fluffy bullcrap giving Harry the shivers. Eating pudding, sausages and scrambled eggs, they chattered about the Halloween Ball, how they were planning to go coupled as three – matching outfits (if just for the sake of making Harry feeling better). A last glance got thrown at the Slytherin table. Draco's seat was still empty. Would this chapter be closed at last? Did he vanish out of his life just like that? He didn't know. He decided to avoid all of Draco's nasty little friends ever since he battled Goyle.
The music stopped. Harry flinched at the sudden silence, and put his senses to work – scanning for a sound. "Potter."
They drove the entire way through the hills with their eyes heavy. Though Ron tried his upper best to impress the blonde, only a couple of giggles managed to escape the girl's throat before she left to meet her friends a few cabins away. Hermione was reading, her eyebrows wrinkled like they were used to whenever she was concentrated – and Ron fell asleep as soon as he neatly planted his head against the window.
"How convenient," Harry replied – the towel covering his parts for the greater good. "I'd like you to leave now. Goodbye." Trying to find the way out, his toes searched around for the edge of the bathtub. Meeting the ground, fabric wrinkled under his foot – buttons activating his pressure points, and he looked up as soon as he saw another piece of clothing falling down in front of him. "What are you doing?" He pulled his foot back – as if he thought to be safe between the small walls of the tub.
The blonde looked up at him, his eyes bloodshot and his lips slightly chapped. He smiled nonetheless, leaning in to brush Harry's hair to the side – finally being able to give a good look to his scar. "You look like a dipshit with that thing on your forehead."
Harry covered his face as chunks of stone clattered through the hall, and he fell to his knees as he heard someone approaching – heels rattling against the cobblestone floor. Harry cried, looking down at his hands in shock – his body shivering by fear. The person approaching him in rapid speed appeared to be Professor Snape, as if he was destined to be seen by the worst teacher at school.
"Please, do some homework. Go to class. Borrow a library book. Your attempt was most disappointing."
"Snape!" Harry called at last, stampeding like an ox. "Stop ignoring me, damnit!" He tugged the Professor's cloak, cursing at him – his head dizzy by angst. Snape kicked his elbow, tugging his cloak loose from Harry's grip; being suddenly cautious and askance.
"Here," a soft voice came from behind – reaching out a blurred hand. Harry squeezed his eyes together, unwilling to take accept the helping hand for he couldn't see who was reaching out. His pair of glasses got put back on the bride of his nose; the vivid white picture becoming clear as day at instant.
Harry couldn't stop smiling and stepped in - waiting for a few seconds - until he greedily wrapped his arms around Draco's neck, pulling him close for a hug. His eyes boiled with tears as they dangled away into the shadows of the tree - burying their faces in each others neck.
"One month," he began slowly, "of detention is what I am giving you for breaking the rules last night. Plus, as many points I can possibly pull from the Griffindor's scoreboard – for you never learn! I'll find you a fine punishment myself, and therefore I'm going to make you regret you came back to school this year. No more contact with Malfoy, for he is my finest student and you make his life even more miserable as it is right now!"
"Fine," Draco sighed, stroking his wand down his face – the mask fading into dark smoke. Harry dropped his jaw, veins popping on his forehead, and he held his breath.
Later that afternoon he found some of his friends sitting in the great hall; reading books and chatting about the ball last night. New couples were formed, and others were broken. Hermione, for example, was sitting all alone – holding in tears while avoiding any eye contact. Harry wanted to visit, give her a hug and ask what happened, but got no opportunity since Ronald came around to spoil it. Hermione cursed, crying her eyes out as she hobbled away – Ron lingering at her feet as he spoke of his apologies.
Ron chuckled under his breath and glanced up at Harry, lifting his brows highly enjoyed. 'Oh please, it was just a joke.'
Ginny got up, knocking over her cup of tea. "I saw you with him! Stop playing me!" Her eyes burned with tears, turning Harry's heart heavy.
Harry had his wand drawn. His view, black by anger, caused all of his muscles to tense, and he threw a spell after he pushed Malfoy down to the ground – giving the blonde no possibility to respond in defence.
They had to talk. They had to sit down and talk for hours. No more bullshit. No more lies. Harry couldn't bear to live another minute knowing Draco's feelings could change like the weather on sunny spring day. Harry took a glance behind him, watching the dusty piano that used to make a fine melody a long time ago. It reminded him of the first few encounters with Draco. Sexual encounters. Full of tension and burning desire. It seemed silly to keep his mind busy with business he shouldn't commit to. Would his parents have accepted his sexual preferences? If this was a preference at all? Harry would still not admit to be gay – knowing what went on with the blonde went far beyond just loving or lust. It was like they were drawn to each other. Made to intertwine. Soulmates. Forbidden lovers like the ones in the muggle stories about Romeo and Juliet. He remembered those books lingering around aunt Petunia – wanting more from live than it had to offer, knowing her life would never be as exciting as those of the two forbidden lovers – or her lost, magical sister and (by aunt Petunia's) abandoned child. He could no longer remember the last time he went to the Dudley's. Boy, what would happened if they know about him and Draco. They would go bloody mad.
Draco stared in silence and shook his head – showing a slight sense of panic what made Harry question whether to continue or not. He believed changing the roles would turn out for the better. "I don't know," he squeezed out – lying, somewhere.
'Don't get lost,' Ron smirked to bring back the memory of years ago when Harry first used the floo powder. Hermione slapped Ron against the shoulder, yet it didn't seem to destroy much of the joy. Harry didn't really mind Ron. He simply took a hand of powder and simply stepped into flames as needed.
The both of them ended at the entrance of professor Dumbledore's office without sharing another word. Once their presence was accepted they led themselves in - Snape deciding to linger near the doorway, gesturing Harry to go further in. Professor Dumbledore stood at the pensieve. He held his eyes closed as he slightly leaned over - looking up once Snape had introduced the both of them with his penetrating voice.
The school no longer felt magical to him. The reason of his presence here seemed a mere lie, and he was close to losing all of his friends. This place no longer felt like home. He no longer followed the education of witchcraft and wizardry. It felt like he walked the distorted path to his death row. He'd lost his appetite - just as his sanity - and thought of opening up to professor Dumbledore. He wanted to lay low for a while. Perhaps stay at the Weasleys, or any place else just to be far away from Draco. Luna confronted Harry the other day. She claimed his head was full of wrackspurts once more - an infection cause by tiny, invisible magical creatures - possible to be expelled by thinking positive thoughts. Depressing, reminding him he didn't have any.
"Just a few more days, Harry," Ron comforted him, nuzzling himself under his fine sheets. "You're not really talkative, Harry. Are you okay?"
"What do you want," Harry spoke as he stood just a couple of feet away. "You wished to speak to me."
"Doesn't seem like it," Neville replied, now turning the pages of the Daily Prophet he received from Dean after he finished reading it himself.
Ron scoffed awkwardly, throwing looks at both Seamus and Neville. "I'm sorry, Harry. I didn't know you cared so much."
Harry crumpled his notes while he tried to look her in the eye. "Why are you saying this?" he smiled faintly.
The following minutes seemed to last longer than forever. Had Harry been right? Or had he been oh so wrong? Harry rubbed his hands through his untidy hair as his eyes troubled with tears. He pulled his roots, biting his lip as he couldn't find the strength to look them in the eye. "I'm not sure I can handle this," Harry whispered as professor Dumbledore's words vividly echoed through his head.
Malfoy thought it would be pretty fair if he could undo Harry from his shirt as well now, and so did – not caring about the tie remaining on his neck. After all, he still wore his tie as well. They couldn't easily rip that one off from their necks. It would suffocate them.
"I got to go, though," the blonde muttered as he rapidly got up from the mattress – fetching his clothes in haste. "Professor Snape wishes to see me before noon."
"Shh," Draco comfortably hushed as he sat down on the same bed. He drew his fingers down the sides of Harry's face, pressing his forehead against his as he held him close. "We can't," he continued with an comforting voice.
"Why take the effort?" he muttered after he thumbed the tip of his tongue along his lips. "Why do you come to see me? What makes you?" Throwing a glance back over his shoulder, he saw Draco pinching his lower arm; the dark sign was burning his skin.
"Potter," Malfoy stated surprised – a smug smile appearing on his flawless feature. Harry wrinkled his nose – his eyes shooting fire – and pushed Draco back in. "Hands off," Draco hissed – his judging eyes popping out. "I swear I wasn't taking a piss on you."
Draco didn't reply. His sunken eyes stared down at his feet, and he quickly rolled down his sleeves – turning away from the both of them.
"That's it?" Neville asked – raising his brows as if not impressed. Luna was simply listening. Her dreamy eyes stuck blank to Harry's glasses, but he didn't mind. He truly liked her, even though her weirdness. Harry gave a nod in return – his mug closed between his hands, as if he was holding a hot mug of coco during the winter. He simply felt sick, nervous and destroyed.
The note burned on the inside of his pocket. Should he tell Hermione about this? If just about the note and their meeting at Borgin and Burkes. He batted his eyes, staring down at his roughly patched hands and nails. Hermione lowered her book, lifting one of her eyebrows – curious but judgemental.
The white haired boy took a breath, leaning back against the wall – showing no sign of wanting to participate.
"Call for Professor Sprout," Madam Pomfrey yelled at painting the lady in white - hanging from the west-side wall. "Tell her to bring us a new batch of aconite."
Harry got up, deciding to take place next to the blonde – placing his hand down on his knee. "You're never this silent."
"Your Father?" Harry replied almost baffled. "Proud? Ever? Look at yourself! Look at what he's done to you!"
Harry had nearly forgotten what kind of event they were reaching. The halls were decorated with pumpkins and candlelight, and Nearly Headless Nick was out for a cheer – greeting everyone with such excite he finally managed to be actually scary (He decided to pop up every time you didn't expect, shouting out as if he tried to sell a bunch of cheap flowers on a market). Not always very pleasant – though it did brighten Harry's mood.
Draco snorted, and pursed his lips concentrated while rushing towards Snape his desk. "Get yourself something to drink."
"We will be missed," Harry muttered as he got off the desk – suddenly not as frisky anymore. His energy was lacking, and his mood had dropped. He felt no longer the need of kissing another, and for all he knew he simply wanted to take a bath – and perhaps clean his mouth with a pint of butterbeer.
Harry smiled once more, though it faded as soon as he realized the blonde didn't come any closer. "Can I kiss you?"
Draco's expression blurred into a blank canvas. Nothing was left to be read on the blonde's face. "What are you talking about?"
"Potter!" Snape called, a twitch in his voice – he sounded angry. He grabbed Harry by the collar, investigating his face, the blood, enjoying his tears.
Now he sat alone, his arms creating a wall around his parchment – scrabbled with terrible humourless characters he used to cry about with his other half, Ron.
"You weren't in your bed, Harry," Hermione cut through – her cocky attitude polluting their spirit. Ronald couldn't care. Though it was determined to cost Harry his education at one point, for now it remained amazingly fascinating.
'Obviously,' Ron nodded as he briefly glanced at Hermione who still seemed to be pretty pissed. Harry stared straight in front of him, holding up his hand to throw the powder into the flames any moment, and he started pronouncing the alley accurate to get it right.
Harry clenched his teeth as he loosened his tie, opening the first button of his shirt after. He snorted as well. The alcohol was draining his energy. "What are we looking for?" In some large steps he stood next to Draco behind the desk, and sank through his knees as well to look at the drawer just like Draco did.
Just as Draco began to shake his head, blinking a couple of times as he gazed around – still not daring to look down and face his companion together with his little friend – Harry wrapped his fingers around the thin skin of his friend's erection.
'Wh-' Harry tried to speak through Draco's roughly way of kissing. Slowly he pulled back a bit, what resulted Draco to move his lips towards Harry's neck, and while Draco seemed to struggle with Harry's properly tied tie, Harry tried to swallow away some blood so he could ask a question in a proper way after. Now he thought of it. Wasn't it disgusting to snog while someone bled? Maybe this had something to do with being a Slytherin, though? Maybe they liked it kinky...
"I said GO!" Harry growled as he jumped up, grabbing his wand to point it at the bed. Harry fell to his knees, grabbing the edge of his bed as he cried – knowing no one was there.
"Harry?" Myrtle cried as he appeared from afar. Harry wrinkled his nose, snorting, trying to keep his business to his own.
Draco stared at Harry with widened eyes - apparently having his wand dropped or put away cause he was rubbing his fingers along his knuckles now (the once that crushed Harry's nose seconds ago). He stared at him as if he'd just seen a ghost.
Draco moaned as he struggled to get up. "I'm bleeding," he squeaked as he wiped his palm along his brow. "Argh, I'm fucking bleeding." He hissed and cursed under his breath, leaving Harry in shock as their eyes met. Why was he acting so horrid?
Her tender body lingered in his arms, shocking and shaking as her tears shed. Harry couldn't move. The way she pronounced his name struck him as lightning. He was eager to ask her; when, where, how? But his lips were sealed – for no sound managed to come from his throat, afraid to make it all real. Almost pretending as if he didn't hear it, he drew his fingers through her hair. "I do love you," he whispered; forcing himself in some sort of trance, as if he whished to believe his own lies. "Trust me, I do."
The blonde rushed towards the bed, quickly pecking the brown-haired boy on the lips before he vanished.
"No, you don't. Not like I love you." She dropped her shoulders, biting her lower lip as she gasped for air. Her body shivered under his touch as he pulled her close into his arms – kissing her temple as he felt it easing her muscles. The two of them kissed, once or twice, and ever since chemistry seemed to have been growing between them. However, ever since the complications with Malfoy grew, their chemistry flew.
"Fuck," Harry groaned, realizing how his dick began to grow without his permission. It bumped against the cloth of his underpants, and got suppressed along the way – especially as Draco buried his teeth in the skin of his shoulder now. Draco grinned, stroking the tip of his tongue toward his earlobe, not realizing how he was giving him a boner by this. He just meant it as a way of teasing, but apparently, he was very good at it.
The door closed. Harry was send upstairs to head towards his tower – however, unguarded. Draco, on the other hand, was guarded by Professor Snape – holding him by his cloak, almost dragging him along the pavers towards his storeroom. Draco sat down on a stool, looking around – becoming awfully small once Snape got settled. Along the way they'd been talking. Draco's eyes were bloodshot. He wasn't just being punished because he sneaked out of school. There was more. He knew.
"What are you implying? What are your real desires?" Harry his voice was soft – showing some weakness of being uncertain about this situation. The drug did not just befoul his breathe or motions, but also his feelings.
Draco didn't reply. In silence he looked down on him, enjoying his power. Loving how he felt like someone at last.
"You have no business here," Goyle replied – his ugly eyes narrowed even more than usual, trying to look sturdy even though Harry could smell the cold sweat running down his shivering spine. "This is Slytherin's property. Besides, do you feel any better?"
"Sush," Harry breathed now – trying to rid of Draco his underpants. The blonde tried his best to steady his breathe, and knocked the boy on the ground - allowing him to hop back on his feet again. Trying to catch his trousers, his boxers dropped to his knees by accident - getting confronted with his swollen erection – realizing how easy it had been to wet him up.
Draco remained out of sight for the following week, and to Harry's suspense he came up with the most ridiculous conclusions possible. He claimed professor Snape hide him, whether to use him for experiments or ingredients. However, this couldn't be true, knowing Draco was his favourite student, and Harry simply became mental.
Harry's response was cut off by a loud moan when his prostate was jabbed again at the same time his cock was swallowed to the hilt. His body tried to arch off the bed but he was held down by Draco's free arm across his waist.
The eldest of the three smirked. “I still managed to acquire an invitation to this little get-together.”
For a moment, it looked as if Draco was going to say something, but when the blonde man opened his mouth, he suddenly winced and glared at his husband. Scorpius left before he had the chance to speak again.
The door to the adjoining kitchen swung open and a handsome, young version of Oliver stepped through, shortly followed by Oliver himself.
“That is an excellent question.” The headmaster started. “Let’s see… I think it was just over three centuries ago now that the heads of several pureblood families got together to discuss our slowly dwindling numbers. I believe the Potters and the Malfoys were among them actually.
“Well, since everyone somehow knows I’m pregnant, I’ll either cry or freak out on them, depending on who it is. They’ll think it’s from hormones, feel sorry for me, and leave us alone.” Harry retorted.
“What took you so long?” The raven-haired teen asked as a familiar, painful squeezing ripped through him once more.
“Sweet Merlin.” The older man declared as he finally sank into a chair, pale-faced. “I’ve never heard such an awful thing and I…” He trailed off when Draco gave him a pointed look.
“We’ll talk about it later.” Harry’s tone and hardened expression left no room for negotiation. “Are you girls done eating?” He asked, turning toward the blonde twins.
Harry's astonishment doubled when the small boy ran passed him and straight into Draco's arms, who was now kneeling on the ground. The room was silent, except for the sounds of the two blondes crying together.
Harry was on the floor, his face covered in spunk and surrounded by broken glass. Above him was another naked man.
With a pale hand, Draco cupped Harry's cheek and kissed him gently, hardly more than a brushing of lips. But there was more feeling behind it and it meant more than any kiss they had shared to date.
“You’ll be here. We can do whatever we want without the weasel finding out that we’re friends.” Draco explained.
Harry's head fell back against the headboard and his mouth opened in a loud moan. “Holy shit.” He said; his voice a bit higher than usual.
Not wanting to spend so much time in close proximity with two wizards, Mrs. Dursley hurried back to the kitchen when neither boy said anything.
“They picked him up from the neighbor that was watching him and went to my place to get some of his stuff. I can tell you they didn’t take two steps into the apartment before deciding I was an unfit parent and most likely didn’t even go into his room, the only bedroom.” Draco explained with watery eyes. “If they had, they would’ve known it was his immediately and might not’ve taken him away. I always made sure his room was absolutely spotless. There was no peeling paint, no dirt, no bugs, or anything.
Draco picked up the conversation from there. “Your escapades with my son have resulted in pregnancy.” He stated flatly.
Draco, not being tired at all, just laid there and held Harry for a few hours until he finally did fall asleep. He didn’t want Harry to wake up alone.
“Can you make your hair orange?” Emma asked a second later. After a moment, orange replaced brown and both girls clapped enthusiastically.
“What’d ya do ter ‘im? Did ya use the Imperius Curse on ‘im or jus’ confund ‘im?” Hagrid roared. He made to move toward Draco again but Harry stepped between them.
Not only that, but the morning sickness that had gratefully left him only a week before school ended, came back full force after three days of being there. Harry didn’t know if it had just been a short reprieve or if it had something to do with his surroundings that brought it back.
“Unfortunately, Harry couldn’t make it tonight.” Draco then gave him a brief explanation of the situation. “I pretty much know what Harry was going to say, so we figured I’d apologize for his absence and make his speech for him”
, and he was married to the man he loved. Suddenly he felt overwhelmed as it all really sank in for the first time.
Finally, the little girl was presented to her parents, wrapped in a soft, pink blanket. “She’s perfectly healthy.” The nurse stated as she laid the small child in Scorpius’ arms.
A few moments later, eyelids fluttered open to reveal watery, gray eyes. Instantly tears started spilling from them.
“Wand, wand, where’s my wand?” Draco sing-songed as he looked for the thin piece of wood amongst their discarded clothes.
“Oh fuck, Harry.” The blonde moaned into the other’s ear. He could already feel his release quickly approaching. And for a moment he marveled at the fact that Harry hadn’t spent himself yet.
His nightmares had pretty much become non-existent. Most of the ones he did have weren’t bad enough to scare him awake and if they did, Draco was right there to hold him.
A little while later, the girls announced that they hadn’t eat dinner so they could come see Harry. They said their goodbyes and wished Harry well. Minutes after the door closed behind them, it opened again and two men walked in.
Draco answered first. “We first met on the train to Hogwarts our first year.” He started but was quickly interrupted.
Madam Pomfrey held the parchment, a blank birth certificate, out to Draco. “It can always be changed later if it becomes a problem but this should be filed as soon as possible. Just touch the tip of your wand to it and clearly say his full name. The rest will fill itself in.”
“No. I’m bi-sexual. I like boys and girls.” Draco replied. “But I’m not a whore. I haven’t slept with that many girls and none that I wasn’t in a relationship with.”
Draco grabbed the edge of Harry's almost elbow length sleeve and slid it up to his shoulder. A small gasp escaped his lips. An angry, purple, handed shaped bruise adorned Harry's bicep. He quickly reached for the other sleeve and saw a matching bruise there as well. He then placed his hands gently over the marks and Draco saw that the person’s hands that caused them, were even bigger than his.
“As is required to be a potions master, I have an extensive amount of medical knowledge.” The dour man replied.
With the other hand he cupped Harry’s face and rubbed the brunette’s cheek with his thumb. “I love you. Ok?”
Thirty minutes later, and the brunette was hardly more than halfway through the pile. He considered taking a break at that point, but he quickly changed his mind because he just wanted to get it done and over with.
At first the blonde didn’t respond, just sat there staring at his lower abdomen incredulously. Then he brought up a hand and poked around under his belly button before laying his hand across it. The corner of his lips twitched a bit until a full blown smile graced his features.
Tuning out the din of conversation, Scorpius slowly finished his first piece and reached for another from one of the boxes in the center of the table. At the same moment, he felt a slight tug on his left sleeve. He glanced down at his sister and she beckoned him closer.
“Yeah, I’m okay now, Sirius.” Harry replied with a small smile as the other man waddled into the room, shortly followed by Remus and Draco. “Where are the kids?”
A few moments later, Narcissa entered the sitting room the boys were occupying with a middle-aged woman in tow. “Draco, Harry, this is Anna Manuel. She’s here for your interview.”
The blonde slightly adjusted his position to better thrust into the man below him, instantly earning him a loud moan in response.
Draco’s heart sank into his stomach as his son spoke the words he had secretly been terrified of hearing one day. He knew Weasley was out of Azkaban, but he never truly expected the redhead to try something against them. The man then stepped back to the podium and quickly announced his departure to the room.
Halfway there, he stopped and came to a decision. He whirled around and marched to the other side of the room.
“We do love each other, very much in fact. But when we were in school we weren’t friends at all. We actually hated each other for a long time. Then the war ended, things changed, and we fell in love.” Harry said softly. “But that’s a story for another time. Ok?”
“It’s a date.” Draco replied. The two of them then spent the rest of the afternoon trying to swallow each other’s tongue.
After a few minutes, Harry broke the kiss and rested his head where Draco's shoulder met his neck, breathing heavily against his throat as his thrusting sped up and became more erratic.
“I thought you were a figment of my imagination as well. I had a very lonely childhood so I thought I dreamt you up to deal with it. When I told my parents about you, they said imaginary friends were pathetic muggle things and that it was wrong. That’s why I thought you stopped coming back.” Draco said softly. “I really missed you for a while. Then my father had some other kids my age come over so I could have some real friends and… I forgot about you.”
“What the bloody hell was that, Malfoy?” He asked in a tone not nearly as harsh as he wanted it to be.
While he continued to wait, Draco ran his fingers over Harry's stomach and sides and dropped light kisses across his face and neck in an attempt to help relax him. It worked apparently because sooner than he expected, Harry experimentally rocked his hips and tightened around him.
One of Ron’s lanky legs was then raised and he placed a foot on the bed near Harry’s knees. As he began to haul himself into a standing position on the bed, Harry saw his one and only chance.
“I have to remove the fetus by a cesarean section. I’ll cut into your abdomen and remove it and any other evidence of it; otherwise, you’ll die, Harry. Do you understand?” The woman asked.
Lucius gave the letter back to Draco. “Unfortunately, it is. It’s not a very common practice nowadays, but they never made it illegal. Harry was still underage when his legal guardians made the contract, therefore, it can’t be undone.
Harry dropped a few pieces of clothing in his trunk. “I don’t know.” He answered with a small smirk and a shrug.
. I’m powerful and it’ll be more likely he can get me pregnant; something I didn’t even know was possible until he told me!
“I want… no, I need you to stay.” Harry said frantically. If he was going to have to retell it again, he was going to need some help this time.
Emma nodded. “And I think maybe he had too much lunch too, ‘cause when I hugged him, his tummy felt extra full.” She added as an apparent afterthought and patted her own stomach.
In an instant, Draco was up from his chair and taking the now fussing baby from his distraught husband.
It was happening all wrong. Draco was supposed to be there with him to help, to make sure he was ok, and that he got to the hospital wing alright. But now, sitting there alone and despite having gone over everything a thousand times to be sure he was ready, Harry had no idea what he was supposed to do.
“That may be true, but I am your mother and you’ll listen to me while you’re living under our roof.” She stated as she smoothed down an unruly piece of her son’s hair.
Applause sounded throughout the room as the blonde man stood and made his way to the stage. The clapping died down as the man reached the podium, but before a single word could pass through his lips, a loud shout of, “papa!” filled the room. He searched for a few seconds before he spotted his son hastily making his way toward the stage looking frazzled and frightened.
Before anyone had the chance to answer the rhetorical the question, a scream was heard from the room behind the blonde seventeen year old.
“It’s been sometime, hasn’t it, Harry?” The middle-aged woman asked as she took a seat next to the distraught man’s bed.
“Ah yes, I suppose the pain in your heart will take much longer to heal.”  He said softly. Harry nodded dejectedly and curled up for warmth now that he didn’t have Draco's body heat next to him.
“I think we’re done for today.” Emma, no longer smiling, said once he’d finished telling that part of the story.
“She was out one day, spending my money, when the phone rang. It was for her from some doctor saying Ginny needed to come in for a follow-up exam. That was all they were allowed to tell me.
Scorpius found himself sitting up. “I like you.” He replied simply before engaging in another scorching kiss.
In the hallway, the frazzled man leaned back against the door he had just closed for a moment and ran his hands down his face. He then went to find their maternity healer.
“On both of us.” Draco added. “I know you bottom more often than not, but we shouldn’t risk either of us getting pregnant again.”
The raven-haired boy paled slightly as images of a certain redhead flashed through his mind. He began to shiver.
The brunette boy froze for a second. No one had asked him that yet and he struggled to find an answer. “I… I don’t really know.” He said brokenly. “He said… something about being friends with me wasn’t what he expected. Like he thought some of my fame would spill onto him just because he was my friend.” There were some other things as well but Harry didn’t want to share those.
“No. You’ll be lucky if you’re not dead by the time I’m through with you!” Draco screeched. “Actually, maybe you’ll be luckier if you are dead.”
“Scorpius…” The older of the two murmured. He moved from his chair to the edge of the bed. “Remember how I said ‘maybe someday’?”
can n-not be James.” Harry stated, pointing in the general direction Madam Pomfrey had gone. “I already h-had a J-James and he was taken fr-rom me.”
Once Draco deemed him stretched enough, he removed his fingers and let go of the cock in his mouth with a wet, squelchy pop. He lined his own prick up with the prepared pucker and paused. "You’re sure about this?” He asked, double checking Harry was really into this.
Harry began piling his food back into the colorful bag it came in. “I’ll take it with me and finish it on the way.”
You are probably the most confusing girl I’ve ever met, but certainly the most intriguing.  Reading about how much you miss my cock has it standing at attention.
“That’s easy for you to say.” Harry groused. “I’ll probably have all of my summer homework done in three days. What am I supposed to do after that?”
They talked as they walked the entire length of Hogsmeade all the way to the Shrieking Shack. Harry explained to Draco how it wasn’t really haunted and what actually caused the noises people used to hear.
“Now then, there’s one more thing. Do you want me to be on top?” Draco asked, not realizing what that could imply.
“What did this…?” Draco trailed off, his eyes widened and flicked to Harry's stomach as the implications of what he said registered.
Harry forced himself to stand straight, his eyes locked – reaching for every feature of Draco's body, as if he was afraid he would miss them after tonight. "Should we go back?"
It was most clear that Hermione let out an annoyed sigh, resulting for Harry to jump into his bathrobes as quick as possible – stuffing his dry toothbrush between his teeth, hoping to take the attention off his red fluttered cheeks. Funny, how he didn't even realize he put on his glasses the very second he got out of the tub. As if they'd never been gone – because they had not.
"Nothing at all. I am just concerned. They have also told me that if you did sleep in your dorms you would have quite a lot of nightmares." Dumbledore looked down at a piece of parchment. "And you seem to talk in your sleep?"
"Blimey Harry," a voice interrupted from behind. Ron stood there, Hermione at his side holding his arm tight. Hagrid tried his best to wiggle his body inside, but couldn't come any further but sticking his head between the entrance.
"How!?" Harry screamed once throwing his arms in the air. "How is this going to make it any easier? You said you missed me this morning!" His face had turned red with fury. This relationship was toxic. Unbelievable. Made up with lies. As if he'd been fooled for months after months.
"Malfoy?" Harry stuttered as he turned to the side of his bed – ready to step out and go for a hunt. A hand from behind pulled him back onto the bed, causing Harry to twitch as he huffed in fear.
"I need to..." Harry cried as he swung his arms against Madam Pomfrey's side to push her away. "Let me go through!"
Harry walked straight up to him, wanting to pull the bottle out of Malfoy's hands. Nevertheless, instead of Draco jumping aside all cheeky, he pressed his lips almost violently upon Harry's, and so before Harry knew it , he gave in. Draco tried to put away the bottle, back on the shelve without looking, but failed and so dropped it on the ground – not caring about the glass clattering among the floor as it broke into thousand pieces. Harry startled for just a second, knowing they would be in great trouble, but grinned once the intoxicated side took over, and accepted the kiss by gently kissing back – folding his hands under the blonde his jawline who pulled him closer.
Neville seemed to have changed his attitude. He acted more mature than ever – and even though Harry felt like a proud lill' daddy seeing his moron all grown-up by lovesick, he felt slightly offended. No matter, he made a turn and left – wiping the sweat off his brow. "I'd like to hold you right now," Harry muttered nervously to himself, wishing his blonde would show up like he used to do. Randomly and unexpected. Rushing through the corridors Harry made his way to the court-yard. A few were outside, walking around – trying to get some fresh air after all the smoke and alcohol they'd consumed the night before. The cold came sweet, like the kiss of Oblivion – making Harry forget his head had been pounding for the last few hours. No matter, it did freshen up his memory in a different way; he forgot to go to Professor Snape's office. He cursed once he looked up the time. Though he could be saved, going to the Professor's office right now, he couldn't gather the effort to actually go there. Ginny scared him off, and made his head quite a mess – afraid she'd tell the others. Sitting down at one of the benches outside, he rubbed his eyes trying to remember the lot of last night. His stomach tickled, funnily enough in an extraordinary pleasant way.
"Nothing," Draco replied, harking his teeth over his bare skin of his shoulder now. In a second the cloth of his shirt flew through the air. Harry had simply ripped it open, not caring about the buttons clattering all over the floor. Satisfaction took over the blonde as he cocked his head - bearing his teeth in pride. Harry sighed in pleasure, pulling the boy close now he realized the game was on.
"Because it does," Snape continued sharply - grabbing Harry's wrist to prevent him from leaving. "I always-"
"Shut it," Professor Snape hissed – slowing his moves. "You," he muttered, his icy glare and bony index-finger pointing at Harry who slowly crawled up from his former position. "Not even a foot planted behind the walls of Hogwarts, and you decide to pick up a fight. You two are coming with me."
Harry stared up bolt. Thinking about their possibilities, he could only think of one. One he did not wish to take – for it carried terrible memories.
Harry almost slipped by agony, his hands gripping the cranes to stay steady on his feet. "What on this bloody earth are you-"
Harry couldn't speak anymore, seeing his friends their worry washing over him. Draco simply showed off a smug, faded smile – knowing he was in bare trouble within the hands of his headmaster. Harry, on the other hand, was completely screwed – always being punished by the one person who he hated the most, and vice versa. Draco snatched his wand back, ready to spit out a curse, but got tamed by a slap against the back of his head.
"We are going home," Harry smiled as he brushed his fingers down Hedwig her feathers. "We are finally going home again." Though Harry's time off was no bad deal, according to the fun things he'd done with his friends, yet Hogwarts was the only place he could really feel like home. Just as he finished stuffing his last belongings in his trunk, he wrinkled his brows – hearing a knocking noise on one of the windows. As he walked on over – pulling the hems of the curtains to open them swiftly – he stood eye to eye with an eagle owl, his shaded feathers reflecting by the fluttering sun. He held tight to a letter, clamped in his beak, and looked judgemental for not opening the window already. Harry looked around, wondering where he came from, and pulled the squeaky hinge to open the window at last. Slowly extending his arm, trying to fetch the letter as slowly as possible, he strained eye contact – seeing the murderous glance on the bird as if it was ready to eat his whole hand as a light snack. Luckily the bird appeared to be completely harmless, and flew off as soon as the parchment clamped between Harry's fingers.
Ripped by arms enclosing him, he tried to avoid Hermione's caring treatments – who immediately grabbed an handkerchief to stop Harry from flooding the pavers with blood. "Hands off," Hermione muttered as Harry tried to stop her actions – his thoughts still out of space. "It's just a nosebleed," Harry replied at last – taking the cloth to do the job himself. "Must be the weather," he muttered as he squeezed his eyes to keep the sun from burning his pupils. "Besides, I'm starving."
"Harry!" Hermione called – her judging eyes burning in Harry's back. "Stop this nonsense at once!" He had no clue whether it was about their fight, or him following Malfoy, but he couldn't care. Now his stomach was sick, and his curiosity took all of his attention, he simply went – knowing where to find Malfoy in case of losing. He was lucky once realising Granger didn't follow, and even though the arguments with his best friends, he didn't feel like solving them.
"Of course I do. Or well I don't, I just don't want to hear it. You've been ignoring me ever since you decided to hook up with her. I thought we were a team!"
Draco stepped dangerously close now, and hit his flattened hand against Harry's face though he still pointed his wand at him too - it just appeared that he didn't dare to use it. Not on Harry to cause any harm, at least. Harry stared at the ground pensively, clenching his jaws together while feeling his skin burn, but terribly enjoyed the way Draco just showed his anger too. It was a progress to what he was aiming for, but still weak. He wanted to piss him off, for once. Really piss him off.
Harry got up on his feet, rushing his hands through his hair – walking circles. "Why," he cried as he closed his eyes. "Why didn't you tell me?"
"You can," Harry replied softly, pulling the blonde's roots as he exhaled. "But not in our rooms. We should go to the room of-" He didn't finish, for bad things had happen in the room of requirement, and they both remembered them very well. Backing off he pulled his sleeves, shaking his head as he scratched it. "I'm sorry." Biting his lower lip he took a glance at the Slytherin entrance. "I feel so wrong."
Harry gasped as he threw his heavy body on the nearest chair, and gazed around as he stroked a lock of hair out of his face. "Another death-wish?"
While everyone remained busy changing clothes and face painting each other with fake blood, Harry remained calm and alone in the corner of the Gryffindor common room. Hermione decided for them to dress up in a Victorian style with dashes of muggily-peeks to it, just for shits and giggles. Ronald seemed delighted by her ideas. The brown suit would match perfectly, along with wooden oak mask – making him look wise and mischievous, to his taste. Hermione, on the other hand, thought he looked silly. But since their love was tough enough as it was, she decided to leave him be and keep his stupid mask. Harry thought of keeping it plain simple. A normal black mask attached to a stick, so he didn't have to look as silly all the time – or take off his glasses. A masquerade ball. How fun it would be.
Harry quickly hopped off his bed, grabbing his trunk along with Hedwig sleeping in her cage – trying not to wake her along the way.
"Potter..." Professor Snape broke their argument, his voice laced with bitterness and his lingering tongue. "Weasley."
After a moment of silence, Harry gritted his teeth – wanting to leave, if just to break the dreadful silence causing his head to spin. Their distance was small, causing Harry to bring up desires barely knew of. He had to leave. He couldn't make a fool out of himself now.
“Harry, you’re okay!” Cried a voice from the doorway. The man in question looked from the baby he was holding toward the voice.
“I’m sorry. I’m just nervous.” Harry replied. “Articles about me in The Daily Prophet don’t always go well.”
Once they were snuggled up under the blankets, Draco took a deep breath to calm his nerves for what he was about to say.
“Does it feel like I’m for real?” He asked, thrusting his hard-on against the smaller boy beneath him.
Said blonde whined and wrapped his arms under Harry to hold him in place. “Let’s skip.” He suggested as he cuddled more into the warm body beneath him.
The pair sat in a pleasant silence before Draco broke it by saying, “I actually have something else for you, too. I’m just not sure if I should give it to you yet.”
That was the last straw. Draco let go of him, shoved him to the ground and kicked him in the stomach.
“I missed you t— mmph” Draco was cut off when Harry suddenly grabbed the back of his head and smashed their lips together. It only took a few seconds for him to be able to feel Harry's growing erection.
“That’s different.” Draco crossed his arms belligerently but sounded slightly unsure of his response.
As it said in the paper, expect an announcement for our first child within a year. That’s the only reason why he wants
Tonks smiled brightly down at them. “I would love to, but my boss here has asked me not to.” She pointed a thumb a Shacklebolt.
Before he could even close his bedroom door behind him, Harry felt the weight in his right hand multiply. The handle slipped out of his grasp and his trunk crashed loudly against the floor.
“What’s wrong?” A different, but very familiar voice asked. The dark head of hair turned to reveal confused green eyes.
Draco rummaged through his trunk and pulled out a pair of blue pajama pants that looked brand new. He took off the robe and slipped the pants on. Then he went to look for the matching top.
At the other end of the bed, the exhausted young man could only blurrily make out the shape of Madam Pomfrey handing a flesh colored blob to Snape before she disappeared behind the blanket that was draped over his raised legs.
A voice finally broke its way through Harry's trance. He looked up at Draco who was walking next to the stretcher that was now being rushed toward the hospital wing.
The pair fell into an amiable silence as they watched each other with Draco waiting for Harry to make the next move. And Harry, well he was trying to make that move.
“I’m sure you are, Mr. Potter-Malfoy, but that changes nothing. There are still other forms of intimacy you can participate in.” She explained. “Now, there’s just one more thing I want to make sure of.”
Before the man’s robe had even whipped out of sight through the door, Draco was rushing back to Harry's side. “Are you ok, Harry? He didn’t say anything to upset you, did he?” The blonde boy asked.
Draco wandered the corridor for a few minutes and came to the conclusion that he was just as bored as he was in the classroom. To give himself something to do, he figured he might as well actually use the restroom before heading back.
Harry then revealed a vial filled with a familiar potion that changed from pink to blue to pink again. He popped the cork and brought it to the other’s lips.
Harry leaned up and planted a kiss on the other’s lips. “Of course, you are.” He said with a grin. They took each other’s hand and headed up to the infirmary together.
Draco moaned into the kiss and gripped Harry's hips so he could lead him backwards toward the poor excuse of a bed.
“Is he as arrogant as my father makes him sound?” He asked as he tossed the bloodied towel on the coffee table in front of him.
“That’s right. You gave birth by caesarian to a healthy baby boy at roughly nine-forty-five last night.” She explained.
The brunette teen suddenly laid a hand across Scorpius’ shoulders. “Why don’t I help you with that stress.” He whispered practically in the other boy’s ear.
“Young Master Malfoy sir, please don’t punish Dobby sir! I is only doing as Headmaster asks.” Dobby said as he quivered on the floor.
Other than his relatives founding out, the worst part about it was how small he already was. Despite his growing stomach, the renewed vomiting was causing Harry to lose weight. If Draco were to see that he was lighter than when they parted, he’d probably kill him, or more likely his relatives.
At the door, Sirius pinned the taller man against the wooden surface. They shared a deep kiss before making their way inside.
“Alright, Harry, I’m going to see how far dilated you are.” The boy in labor nodded his understanding before turning his attention to Draco, who was holding Harry's left hand in both of his and had it pressed to his mouth.
By the time Harry finished, he was speaking very quietly and was on the verge of tears. It had taken everything he had in him not to cry.
“No!” The older boy nearly yelled and then forced a small smile. “I probably just needed to get it out. I feel better already.”
Once she was finally asleep again, Harry placed the infant back in her bassinet before going to look for his husband.
Harry rested his forehead on the blonde’s collarbone. “Fine.” He grumbled and Draco squeezed him a little.
“I need you to go back to the house with him and wait for the other children.” He started quickly. “Harry was attacked and now he’s at St. Mungo’s in labor. I have to run to the ministry and get aurors to the house before his attackers wake up and try to get away.”
