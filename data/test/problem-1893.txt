"We better be!" Draco responded in mock anger as Harry took his hand and they walked for a few minutes more before reaching their destination.
Unlike his first sixth year, nothing really happened. Draco was part of the Slug Club and won all of Slughorn's prizes since he was the best in the class. Even with his time traveling trick, Harry would never be a Potion genius. He just got by.
Pansy let out an annoyed sighed as she passed yet another compartment that contained neither Draco nor Harry. She was looking for them so she could apologize and they were making it a lot harder than it needed to be.
All rational thought was gone from Harry's mind and he lunged towards the man that dared to lay a finger on his Draco.
Harry let out a sigh and kissed her gently on the lips, "Pansy, I know all about unrequited love. Trust me when you love someone like I love Draco, you'd do anything to be with them. I will forgive you-eventually."
Harry took a deep breath, pulling Draco close to him and picked him up before settling Draco on his lap under a palm tree, "I want to show you how much I love you."
“A lot of you may not be aware of this fact but Draco Malfoy is part of the reason that I stand here today. As you know I have already spoken on behalf of his mother, but without Draco’s wand, which he graciously threw to me, we would not be sitting here today.” Harry took a breath, as though daring anyone to interrupt. No one did.
Harry rushed forward in an attempt to stop Malfoy who was trying to sit up, Malfoy’s eyes darted around the room as Harry guided him back into a horizontal position.
disposition, they had sent him to work in Azkaban, preparing food. Kreacher came back on the weekends to make sure Mr Potter wasn't tarnishing his Mistress’ house anymore than he was by simply being there. It was then that Harry had asked Kreacher, very sweetly, if he would pass the letter to Draco Malfoy. Kreacher’s ears had pricked up at that, a Black descendant, in Azkaban, of course Kreacher would pass on the letter, muttering to himself about the nobility of the Black Family.
Draco thought back to a conversation he had heard between his mother and his aunt, something about Mudbloods moving into a family home. They must have been discussing Potter’s house. And if that was so, it would mean that Potter was living in Aunt Walburga’s house.
Hermione's eyes lit up, “oh harry! Redoing Grimmauld Place would be amazing! I'll send along some catalogs and DIY books! Oh this is exciting!”
“Excuse me, Minister, but before you give your verdict I would like to say something.” A new voice cut through the shrill din of the court. A voice that was both a comfort and set Draco’s nerves on edge. Harry Potter had stepped up, out of his seat in a dark corner of the room. Draco’s heart sped up slightly, holding his breath in fear of a longer sentence. Voices all around the court tittered but Draco paid them no mind, his eyes fixated on the Boy who Lived.
Draco, for his part, was surprised in the urgency of Harry's kisses and caresses, but gave into them. He wanted this night to be perfect. Being a traditional pureblood he was just as eager, this isn't his boyfriend anymore, this is his husband.
"Hold your horse's dad! Sheesh you need to loosen up." A feminine voice giggled and Harry grinned when his second eldest and only girl, Cassiopeia Lily Malfoy-Potter at age 15 came down the stairs and gave him a mock serious look.
"Shh love, McLaggen will not be my downfall. You don't have to worry about, my pretty." Harry said wrapping in his arms
Riddle sat down between them putting a finger on both their foreheads as Harry watched in awe as Draco's body regained color while Anthony grew paler and paler until he simply disappeared.
Unfortunately for Harry, he couldn't think of a plan that would make the second task easier, so he guessed he was stuck with Gillyweed. He tried not to worry when Draco was called away, but that didn't make him any less concerned. He was fidgety as he stood on the dock waiting for the signal to go. He wanted to hurry up and save his Draco.
He had been foolish! In helping Voldemort, he had given him the chance to rise and now he had an enemy to destroy. No matter, he had destroyed him in the past and he would do so again. He wrapped Draco in his arms. No one would take Draco from him.
Draco let out a loud gasp staring at the sleeping Cerberus in front of them just as the door began to rattle confirming that Filch knew they were in here.
He barely got the words out of his mouth when the door opened and the Fat Lady fell into an enchanted sleep.
Harry looked out into the crowd and spotted his boyfriend, smiling at him and he couldn't help the grin that came across his face. Draco was his boyfriend, his love, not anyone else's.
But, that didn't mean that he been lazy. Harry had been practicing over the past summers for the final showdown he knew was coming. He knew for a fact that Tom was going to be angry once he found out about their engagement, which he would since Draco had been dropping hints to anyone who would listen and had not bothered to take the ring off.
Harry laughed opening his presents; he had a lot more presents than when he was a Gryffindor that's for sure.
"I know what you're trying to do," He mocked him,"You're trying to trick me, so I'll release you and make your escape."
"Well, there could be more to it, but that's what we've thought of so far." Blasie put in. He unlike Draco was not blind to Pansy's crush. If Harry had loved Draco since they were first years, then Pansy had always harbored a crush on the raven for that long as well.
But the more Pansy watched, she realized that Harry was looking back in admiration. He was admiring what was his and there was no mistaking the possessive/obsessive (and just slightly creepy) glint in his eyes when he looked at Draco.
"Potter is preoccupied, love." Tom responded. The brat would be out of the way soon enough and he would make to erase him from Draco's mind, nothing a few spells wouldn't fix.
He marveled at how Remus was able to make their Boggarts become funny. Take Theodore's for example: the ghost of his dead mother who blamed him for her death had been sucked into a vacuum. He shook his head and watched as Draco went forward.
He landed in front of the maze as the crowd of specters burst into cheers, but Harry ignored it all, focusing on Draco's slender form as he came towards him, the delight visible in both his eyes and lips.
Harry stood up looking at the nearly solid form of Tom Riddle and choked back a sob, "Listen, you can do whatever you want: world domination, elimination, war, I don't care, but you don't take him."
As Harry watched Draco go crazy over another bouquet of flowers and poems, "Moody" watched from the Head Table as the Malfoy Heir basked in his courtship. It had been too easy to hide under Dumbledore's crocked nose as he sought information about Hogwarts and the Potter brat, but even he had to admit to himself that that was not all. If it was, he could have just sent one of his followers. No, he wanted to see Draco Malfoy, the naive and utterly innocent boy who looked at him with affection.
Not that Harry cared, he was more than happy to see his love flourish under the lime light for something besides his beauty and Malfoy heir status.
Draco stormed angrily down the hall way. Stupid bloody Harry Potter! Who did he think he was anyway? So he defeated the Dark Lord, big deal! He could do that if he tried. Draco was too busy with his internal rant that he failed to notice the person in front of him until it was too late. Both of them as fell to the ground in a tangle of arms and limbs.
"I am," Draco said quickly and regretted it when he saw Harry's crestfallen face, "I mean... I was."
Instead of answering, Harry brought his lips to Draco kissing him before reeling away in shock. He could have died of embarrassment. Months of planning down the drain because he couldn't control his hormones; instead, he decided to think with his
Spotting his target, Harry grinned and immediately walked towards a taller Slytherin. He ignored the fact that he was surrounded by fellow Slytherins, who were making their way towards the common room. He knew that Snape would be pissed that he dared to confront not only a senior, but a fellow Slytherin in pubic, effectively breaking their most sacred rule: Slytherins stood united and only in the privacy of their own common room were they allowed to fight among themselves.
Harry smiled staring at the beauty in front of him. Yes, his love was steadily growing more and more beautiful. He was still petite and dainty, something that would probably never change, stuck with his mother's bones. His hair growing out and now reached his chin. Draco had stopped gelling it back and it framed his small, pale face beautifully. Currently, the tease was sucking on a sugar quill. It was official: either Harry had died and gone to heaven or he was being tortured in hell.
Their wedding before their seventh year was the social event of the century. After his defeat of Tom, Harry had been offered the position in Fudge's office and he knew that within a few years, he would be Minister.
Harry chuckled before moving back in for another kiss, only this time Draco moved away, "So those letters, were they from you?"
Once again Harry spent his time at the ball watching the one he wanted to be with dance with someone else. That didn't mean he didn't enjoy himself though he had gone to the ball with Luna and she was entertainment all by herself. He should befriend after he had secured Draco as his own. He knew if he couldn't have Draco, Luna was who he would want.
Draco smirked at him, leaning even closer so that their lips were just barely brushing, causing Harry's breath to hitch before whispering, "I'd like to see you try."
Harry went in with Sirius on his trail as grey eyes looked at him impressed. They made their way up to the dormitories and spotted Peter sleeping on the desk next to Ron before grabbing him and replacing him with another rat. They left, the traitor put into an enchanted sleep. This time, Harry vowed, he would not get away.
"If you want me to stop, all you have to do is tell me," He whispered before pulling Harry down for a kiss.
"You know, you lose brain cells doing that." Draco muttered, stepping into the hallway where Harry was.
"Can you take me instead? I will forgive you, Pansy, if you do. It's time to end it once and for all."
"Dumbledore called your name! You're a champion!" Pansy whispered as Draco paled beside him, too stunned to say anything.
He couldn't hear what was going on, but Amelia Bones was looking at him with a disgusted look on her face and the Minister looked like he was going to die from shock. It was then he noticed that James' and Lily's boy was staring at him with a glare and he shuddered. Maybe he shouldn't have betrayed the Potters...
Harry ran outside the bathroom only to run into Anthony Goldstein and grinned thanking Merlin before stunning him and bringing him back to Riddle.
Yes Harry is a creepy obsessive stalker but that's the point. This will be different because since Harry is so hung up on Draco some deaths turn out differently or different people die.
Draco made his way to his room only to see it covered with rose petals and chocolates. He looked at the bed and saw Harry smiling at him and felt his heart break. Did he think he could just play with his feelings like that? He was to distraught to realize Harry couldn't have made it back here before him.
Sirius turned to the voice that had spoken and felt his breath catch the boy was adorable! The wide grey eyes, plump red lips, flawless pale skin, and silk like hair he could feel his protective canine instincts coming out. That boy could have the whole world wrapped around his fingers.
The next day the Hogwarts' staff were somber and the reason became apparent when Dumbledore made his announcement, "I regret to inform you that fellow classmate, Miss. Hermione Granger was attacked last night by the troll that managed to enter the building. As she wasn't forewarned that a troll had been found in the castle and it found its way into the girls bathroom. Unfortunately, the troll was apprehended shortly after Miss. Granger was harmed and is currently resting in the hospital wing with critical injuries."
Feeling someone's eyes on him, he turned and found Draco staring at him with a worried expression on his face.
Not only had she looked at Harry like a fangirl in love with his fame and money, but her father's death had transformed her into something of a scarlet woman, for lack of a better term and Albus was not stupid. He knew that with that dark love, no one else was allowed to touch what was deemed his.
He felt silent tears wet his sheets and Harry's heart clutch. No one would harm his Draco he vowed and very gently picked up his love and took him to his room, cuddling him close.
As the weeks passed and it got closer to October, Harry could feel his anxiety increase as well as slowly losing control of his temper. He knew he had to step up his game as Draco was going ecstatic over those letters Tom sent him. Hell, he even kept them in a box and he had all the flowers he sent in a vase next to his bedside.
"Really, I suppose it doesn't matter. I could just kill you all." Harry laughed before releasing Terence, "No matter when the times come, you will all be dead."
"I swear you act so gay, it's a shame," Pansy snickered as she reached over and petted the now longer blonde locks.
Part of her reaction was jealousy over the Weaselette. If Harry were to cheat on Draco, why the school tramp.
"Sssh," Harry muttered putting a finger on his lips, interrupting him, "This has nothing to do with that."
Draco let out a moan and crumbled to the floor or he would have had Harry not been there to catch him. Harry grinned inwardly. He had successfully removed the fact that they had an argument when in fact it seemed Harry had declined his offer to spend summer at his house because he had prior engagements.
him: one he was messing with Draco's mind two much and second everyone saw. Even he wasn't that powerful to make hundreds of students and guests forget what they saw. Anthony was one thing, not everyone in the school knew him, but this?
Draco waited, hoping that it was all a mistake and that the tramp had kissed him first. He even approached Harry, hoping that he was under some spell or potion or something, but found nothing.
The compartment went dark and Harry felt his body be hit with a spell and cursed himself for ever trusting Pansy as his hands were tied around his back.
"Nice, spent it with Anthony." Draco dozed off, not noticing how Harry's breathing had quicken and his grip had tightened.
Harry let out a moan, wrapping his arms around his waist and pushing him against the wall, before pulling away again to Draco's annoyance, "Wait, so are we boyfriends now?"
This past summer, Harry had kept a close eye on his future father-in-law and besides seeing Lucius trending lightly, no doubt aware of Tom's attraction to his son, he had no new information on the Death Eaters.
The moment young Harry had entered for his sorting, Albus had high hopes for him. Hagrid had found him to be shy and good natured. Reports had reached him that he had befriend the Weasley's youngest and had scorned the Malfoy heir, but once his name had been called, it had gone all wrong.
Once again he was subjected to the same questions: Did you put your name in the cup? Did you ask someone to put your name in there? Do you know what this means?
Tom looked bewildered before he let out an enraged scream. He would not be defeated by such a childish spell and didn't waste time retaliating,
"Hmm?" Harry looked up to see Draco staring at him wide sliver eyes and he felt his breath hitch. Draco would be
The sobs were inevitable and he cursed. He didn't want to hurt Draco. He hugged him and Draco collasped in his arms.
"Because if I die, I'll end up leaving you available and alone and I don't intend for that to happen."
In fact, Harry thought as he walked up to the Head Table, Tom just helped him out! When he won, he could prove to Lucius that he was worthy of his son and he could prove to Draco that he could protect him as well. And this time he wouldn't bother helping out the other contestants, so he had this in the bag.
Harry let out an annoyed huff. They did this all the time whenever they were found in a compromising position together and it was getting old, but that's not say he didn't mind being in a compromising position with Draco.
That made Harry move and he took a deep breath walking up to the stool as the sorting hat was placed on his head.
He made his way quickly to the lair and stopped, finding Draco on the floor, skin paler than normal and hardly breathing.
"That you cheated on Draco! He's up there crying his eyes out because of you!" Daphne burst out and Harry looked at her shocked.
And after a few days, the Weaslette had calmed down considerably, no longer spreading rumors that Harry had seduced her.
Peter still belonged to Ron and Harry didn't know how to approach him or if he should. The red head might have been a great friend in the past (minus fourth year and the Triwizard fiasco), but he didn't want to lose Draco and there was only so many times he could oblivate him without harming him. Like Ginny, he had erased her memories so many times that she was becoming a loony version of Lockhart but, the difference was that he didn't care about the harpy, but cared about Draco. Though it hadn't happened in this timeline...yet. Plus, if he approached Ron, he would have to deal with Ginny and he didn't want to. He had enough of that crazy harlot for one lifetime.
One thing Harry found out was that girls would be girls no matter what and that meant getting together and giggling over the Yule Ball. Speaking of which he needed to ask Draco if he would go with him.
Harry smiled. Draco was maturing and becoming more like his snarky old self, except in a less mean way of course.
"No, you're not!" Draco smirked, ignoring the feelings of jealousy, "She's going with Greg, Millie is going with Vince, and Theo is going with Blaise."
"I think Uncle Vernon that you have no choice. Thanks to a certain potion I'm technically considered an adult and I am using an unknown wand, so I suggest you hold your temper unless you really want me to turn you into the fat whale that you are."
Harry spent the next few days skillfully making Draco avoid spending anytime with Anthony, not that he noticed, but still. In fact, he was so hung up on that Draco he was completely shocked when he heard the Balisk in the pipes.
Harry snorted at that! Yeah, right! She had had no trouble lying to him in the past in an effort to keep him chained to her. Regardless, Harry searched her mind and found that she was telling the truth and scowled walking away ignoring her cries for him.
He watched in shock as the words disappeared and scowled readying his quill to rewrite it when words appeared.
All the other boys in the room let out a collective groan. Trust Draco to only be concerned on whether or not he came out on top during an argument.
After his kidnapping, Harry kept an even closer eye on the beauty, something that both Lucius and Narcissa were more than happy with. Draco was their only child and they both adored him and would do anything for him.
Draco, even if he did have a different outfit for every day of the year, holidays and mishaps taken into account. Harry just thanked his lucky stars that he was wealthy, if wasn't he would be in so much trouble with his spoiled blonde.
Last time he had done nothing, but not this time! If Voldemort believed that some cheesy poems and some stupid flowers were enough, he was dead wrong. He would court Draco as well!
Draco didn't even stir and Pansy sneered at his lovely face. He looked like the damn muggle fairytale of Sleeping Beauty.
"Know what?" Harry asked vaguely annoyed. His proposal just got postponed and he didn't want to deal with Pansy's bitchiness right about now.
Tom smirked,"I could never resist you, could I Draco?" He cooed as stroked his cheek, "Fine! Potter will have five minutes to prepare before I end his pathetic existence. And when I do, you'll be mine."
Just like Hagrid's class, Harry stood in the back of the classroom while Remus introduced Boggarts for two reasons. One he wanted everyone to have a chance unlike before where he ruined it for half the class and secondly, he didn't know what his Boggart would be and if it was something like the dead body of one Draco Malfoy, he'd have a hard time explaining it.
Harry just rolled his eyes, willing the spell to work faster. He could care less what happened to the bint. He needed to get into that damn Tower!
Draco huffed, but allowed himself to be dragged away. Harry stared after them or rather his very fine arse; it seemed to have gotten fuller probably due to the pregnancy.
tune played seeing as there was no bride. Lucius was glaring at him so hard, as if hoping he would die right there and now. He may have accepted the fact that Draco was getting married to Harry bloody Potter no less, but it didn't mean he had to like it. Draco was his only child, so if he was a little extra protective so be it.
Like the original timeline, Dumbledore had hired Slughorn to teach Potions and had finally given Snape the Defense Against the Dark Arts Position. He seemed to think that since Harry was in Slytherin, then Neville Longbottom could be trained to kill the Dark Lord. A thought that made Harry laugh. That wasn't likely.
Harry glared at the spot where Tom use to be before turning to Draco and casting a specific memory spell on anybody who knew Anthony. Now it was like he had never existed, "Come on let's get out of here."
"She was trying to turn this damn house against me and has no doubt filled Draco's head with lies about my apparent disloyalty, so I could care less about her feelings right now. All I know is that I need to find out who the hell set me up."
Tom looked at the blonde beauty as he kissed his poems and felt something fluttered within him. What was wrong with him that he actually cared about the blonde?
Draco blinked. He hadn't realized he had been talking with Anthony for so long and glared at Harry. Why did he care anyway?
Instead, he watched him from afar as the Ministry threw themselves at him and in extension the Malfoys, his future in laws.
"Not yet, sweetheart," Harry responds and even though he wants nothing more than to be inside Draco, he forces himself to calm down. He has two fingers in and needs to add a third, but all he can think about is how hot and oh so tight Draco is and how much he wants, no needs to pound into him and come inside him.
The Boggart transformed into a large woman with dark eyes and a leery smile, as she scanned the room.
It felt wrong to compare the two: Draco, pure, sweet, wonderful  and Ginny, a complete tramp, who...
Weird things were bound to happen, not to mention that his own father and godfather had their own forms, so it had to be genetic or at least inherent. Sirius and he were family through his paternal grandmother after all. His Patronus should been a clue.
At least there was no danger of Peter going to Voldemort as he already had a body and this time Harry would be able to avoid the tournament or so he hoped. Two weeks later, Harry made his way to the station and frowned when he didn't see Draco immediately. Where was he?
School passed by with whispers about the infamous Sirius Black, but Harry and Draco ignored such gossip. Although, Harry cringed about taking Hagrid's class, his classes were both boring and predictable. But, this time he was ready and Harry made sure to stay far in the back away from Buckbeak along with Draco as Harry kept a close eye on him.
“He has multiple wounds, all of them from curse damage, I think there's at least 2 broken ribs and I can sense that one of the Unspeakables has been used on him. he needs to go to St Mungo’s.” Hermione announced grimly.
“Right,” Kindgsley said with a glance at Harry, “well, we’ve charged Antone Growse and detained his superior for questioning along with some of the other guards.”
“Luna, what are you doing here? Did Ron or Hermione call you?” Harry asked, the question leaving his mouth faster than it entered his head.
“Well, we have to get going, are you ready?” Harry asked, taking a hold of Draco’s left hand and delighting in the feeling of a ring on his finger. They had been hesitant to get married. Neither one saw much point in it since they had already gone through so much together but then Draco picked up one of Hermione’s old wedding magazines and all he could hear was wedding bells. They'd gotten engaged a short while after but had yet to plan the wedding.
Of course Potter would know the guards, Draco tuned in just in time to catch how the two knew each other, a Weasley wedding. Potter was wearing clothes that actually fit for once and he looked less skinny than he had at Hogwarts. Draco dreaded thinking he actually looked good.
Myrle looked at him and sighed, “He’s still under a stasis charm, his bones have grown back already and most of his injuries are healed.”
Harry looked away from the fireplace, “they don't keep me up that much…” just then a thought came to him, “does the wizarding world have like a furniture store? Or like a DIY store?”
“I just don’t understand why I shouldn’t wear my dress robes, it is important that I make a good impression.” Draco said, walking out of their ensuite in his ‘fancy’ black jeans and a suit jacket while running his fingers through his hair. It had been years since he had even attempted to slick his hair back. Nowadays he just let it fall how it wanted to, all he did was style it slightly in the mornings.
“Um, well I don't know,” Rosetta stammered. Harry ignored them and walked towards the patient, he already knew who it was.
Kingsley sighed, “I don’t know yet, but between the DMLE and the minister we’ll come up with something, I promise.”
Harry smiled, feeling all sorts of awkward, “Um, Rosetta is a beautiful name, it clearly suits you.” Harry said, reading her name tag.
“Thank you for everything you have done for my mother and I, we will forever be in your debt and if there is anything either of us can do-” Draco stopped. Potter was touching him. Well actually Potter was holding his hand. Draco stared at their conjoined hands in shock.
Hermione frowned, “They appointed Eldon Leveret after the trials, why Harry, what happened? Step back, we’re coming through.”
Harry looked down at his feet, “Yeah, you two go home, it's late.” He said and they hugged him goodbye then headed down the corridor towards the floos.
Potter was thanking him? No, this must be some practical joke. He expected Weasley to jump out and Potter to laugh at him but no, Potter was running his thumb over Draco’s knuckles.
“Go back to sleep dear,” Myrle said to him as she walked towards the door, “rather get some sleep, it won't help if you’re so tired you can’t be there for him.” She said as she closed the door behind her.
Draco shook his head at that thought. there was very little possibility that Potter would ever be interested in being friends let alone…  more… with him… Draco scoffed at his own thoughts and rolled over on his cot in his cold cell, gripping at the measly blanket all prisoners were given.
“You’re going to need to take him as soon as I let go.” Harry said to the woman and she nodded. And as soon as Harry took his hand back, the two disappeared from sight. He turned to Cornus and nodded that he was ready. with a quick wave to Hermione who waved back, they apparated.
Before it was time, Harry had already swallowed the Gillyweed and was in the water, swimming towards Draco. He didn't need Myrtle's help this time, as it was hard to forget something like this. He was among the first ones to get to their captives and this time he wasn't going to bother help anyone else. He found Draco floating serenely, looking like an angel with his silken locks framed across his face. He was so beautiful, but now was not the time to think about how beautiful Draco was when he could do that later.
Harry held him, kissing his perfect blond head and whispered sweet nothings,"Shh, I'll protect you. I promise".
Harry looked at her and laughed in her face making Pansy's face redden in shame and embarrassment. How dare he laugh at her!
Draco waited until he was sure everyone was asleep before lighting up his wand and pulling out a black book. His father had instructed him to give it to a bloodtraitor or a mudblood, but Draco hadn't seen the point, it was just a dumb journal Plus he was curious, Lucius had promised to tell him what it was when he was older, after he saw it in his study, but that was five years ago, surely he was older now?
Of course, according to the Slytherins the Yule Ball wasn't much of a party and they decided to have their own in the common room. It was actually pretty nice until someone decided to spike the punch and Draco decided to do a strip show, something that would provide Harry with wank fantasies for months to come, although he felt jealous. Draco was
As school came to an end, Harry found himself wanting to spend more time with Draco. However, this time he wouldn't be stupid and get in argument with him. He would also prevent another Anthony from coming between them.
Ironically, he had his father's high maintenance personality and Harry couldn't wait to see who would end up taming him, but then again Rose Weasley seem to be managing that just fine. Despite having Draco's personality he didn't have any cunning skills. Not at all; in fact, he was loud and brash just like he had been at that age in the original timeline: a Gryffindor.
Also, once he heard those things (very intimate things) about his Draco, his mind snapped. Harry needed to see his Draco, who he hoped would still be pure, and safe, and his.
He couldn't help but bite his lip, he didn't love Tom in that way and he really hoped Harry would be okay.
Unfortunately, because Tom was back and they weren't connected meant that Arthur Weasley had been attacked by Nagani with no one knowing and had died. The Weaselys had been called away for the funeral and Ron had come back quiet and subdued, making Harry feel guilty seeing his former friend like that. He had found comfort in Hermione and they were now dating, and he seemed to be getting better.
Draco nods lending against him and sighs before mock glaring at him, "Be a dear and wait for me downstairs, I need to get ready without any distractions."
Lucius Malfoy and Cornelius Fudge were threatening to sack Dumbledore and close down the school and Draco was acting really weird and fidgety and scared, probably because the attacks were getting to him.
Although Draco was fine and healthy after his ordeal and thanks to Lucius' position as Governor he managed to get Dumbledore fired. Well, that had been until the other students had been cured thanks to his efforts and Dumbledore was welcomed back as Headmaster, although he was put under more scrutiny. He might have saved those students, but it was due to neglect that they were harmed in the first place.
"Trolls aren't smart enough to get in here on their own. Someone put it there, but they messed up. They were suppose to put it in the dungeon, but the troll is too dumb to make its own, so it found Granger instead. The problem is why would someone put a troll in the dungeon unless they were after someone. The only person who stays in the dungeon worth going after is you." Draco finished, cheeks flushed from saying it all in one breath.
Pansy just watched the two lovers and realized how foolish she had been. Harry had lived; he had defeated the Dark Lord. He had won.
Tom dodged the last one and snarled. He hated when one of his favorites spells was used against him,
Harry opened his mouth to tell him Treacle Tart was way better when Quirell ran in screaming about a troll in the dungeons. He blinked when a hand grabbed his and turned to see Draco's worried face.
Harry let out a growl and crumbled the paper knowing instantly who it was. Voldemort was after his Draco and that was unacceptable. After he dealt with Peter he'd be coming after him. He didn't have time to wait. Harry looked at Draco who was still sucking his sugar quill and smirked. Tom was doing him a favor. He knew from the previous timeline that, Draco due to his loving overprotective parents had been pretty clueless to the aspect of flirting and sex as a whole and probably wouldn't until next year and when that time came he could say those letters were from him. As he cuddled the blond to his side, he made up his mind. It was time to be more decisive.
Harry ran, needing to get to Draco and if he caught Pansy along the way, well it'd all work out for the better in his mind.
Draco, on the other hand, was gushing over it like a girl. How could he like it without knowing who it was? Harry stifled another growl as Draco brought the poem to his chest and gazed at the flowers dazedly. They were just flowers! But, despite that, Harry knew that the hidden meanings were damning to his chances with Draco.
The end of the summer sped by too fast for Harry's tastes. He liked having Draco around, loved being near his blond beauty and holding him in his arms as they slept. However, it ended all too soon before he had to leave to his parents' once more.
Surprisingly enough fifth year passed without much of a problem as Umbridge was still around, but because he wasn't friends with Hermione, he didn't bother starting a dueling club. Plus, being in Slytherin had taught him that sometimes you had to ally yourself with people you didn't like in order to survive-in this case Umbridge. He was also popular with the ministry without his crazy Voldemort claims and was friendly with Umbridge, which also made him friendly with Fudge.
Harry thought as he watched Draco be fawned over by his parents. Oddly, enough Lucius looked frazzled and couldn't stop embracing his son. He had looked at him with grateful eyes when Draco pointed out that Harry had saved him.
Harry scowled, then frowned, he seemed to be scowling and frowning a lot, but he was no closer than finding the person with the diary and the petrifying seemed way worse than when he was a Gryffindor. Justin Finn-Fletchy and Headless Nick had been petrified like before and so had Hermione and Penelope, but however this time so had Dean Thomas, Ernie McMillan and Tracey Davis.
Harry locked eyes with the man and then with a slight flick of his hand, ropes sprung out of nowhere and bound Antone as he dropped to the floor. Hermione turned to Harry as Rosetta started protesting and they shared a look.
Harry signed off and smiled at his letter. His eyes traveled to the photo frame sitting on his desk, it  was a house warming gift from Hermione and Ron, it was a picture that they had taken the summer after the war when they had finally taken some down time to just relax. His smile widened and he got up to finish sealing his letter, cast some final protection charms on the envelope and headed to bed for some much needed relaxation in his new and comfy bed.
“My lips are sealed” Harry smiled as Hermione got up and elbowed him in the ribs once their tour guide had turned her back.
“Who said I’m doing this all myself, didn’t you hear about Saturday’s plan?” Harry said and Ron’s eyes widened. Harry burst out laughing, “I’m joking mate, although some help would be appreciated…”
The year after Draco had come home from St Mungo’s was one filled with healing and growth. Draco had nightmares most nights and hated sleeping separately from Harry. To this day, he still had nightmares on days where his anxiety was intense. But together they had found their niche and realised that they never wanted to be apart. It was a tricky road to navigate, with Draco coming to terms with being gay and then coming out to his mother. And of course once the press got wind of their arrangement, it was like blood in the water.
Draco woke with a start, it had been difficult to fall asleep and he expected that he had been asleep for about 3 hours at most. He had just blinked the sleep out of his eyes when he heard the sound of footsteps coming down the passage. Draco tensed up as the footsteps grew closer. It sickened Draco that he knew his attacker by their footsteps and he knew they were coming down the passage.
Harry felt a smile creep onto his face, “thank you Hermione, I’ll pop in at Flourish and Botts too.” but Hermione had not heard him, she was already muttering to herself and a quill which was taking quick notes next to her, then her head disappeared from the fireplace altogether and the call ended.Harry smiled to himself, he knew how Hermione could get, he better send a note to Ron, apologizing for getting his girlfriend stuck on another task.
Draco sighed and rolled his head, feeling barely any twinges of pain. He sat on his cot and lifted a forkful of today’s mystery slop to his mouth, swallowing it down quickly. On his third forkful, he noticed something gleaming at the bottom of his dish, putting his fork down and expertly balancing his dish on his hands he pulled out another envelope titled ‘Malfoy’ in a messy script. His heart warmed and a sensation settled in his stomach, but Draco was quick to blame that on the food.
Harry relaxed. Sirius wasn't interested in Draco. Thank Merlin, it would have caused problems if he was.
As soon as Pansy arrived to the throne room, Draco was quickly snatched from her arms. She watched, envious that Draco was being fawned over by the Dark Lord, red eyes roaming over his delicate face.
"Careful," Harry muttered pulling Draco back to him and pulling them both down to the seat. "Just relax okay," he muttered stroking Draco's hair.
Draco stared at him and Harry wondered that perhaps he was a bit to forward and thought that maybe he didn't need to know the numerous tracking spells, protective charms and all the other jinxes and hexes he put on the necklace.
"I'm not," Draco said turning around so Harry could see the worry in his eyes, "It's just that you could die and you're like my closest friend and I don't want you to die."
Just like in the past, Viktor got the snitch and Harry watched as Draco looked on in awe, feeling a little jealous. But, he had nothing to worry about, right? Viktor may have come to Hogwarts for the tournament, but that didn't matter. He had dated Hermione, so there was no way he would be interest in Draco, no matter how stunning he was.
"Hello," Theo said as he rolled his eyes, "You two are the hottest guys in school! After me of course," He added as Blaise snorted, "Of course, they want to break you up! If both of you are single then the other ugly souls of Hogwarts have a chance. And we all know that the Weaselette has been after Harry for years."
He watched as Goldstein moved away from Draco pulling him to the wall in front of his stall and pulled Draco to him. Harry stared at Draco in all his naked glory for the first time: soft, pale skin flushed pink in all the right places, an asre even rounder and fuller than it appeared through his pants, and between his legs a dripping cock begging to be touched. Goldstein pulled Draco to him and lifted him up by his arse as Draco wrapped his legs around his waist and using precum as lube, he slid his asre down.
"I feel sorry for the poor sucker you trick into marrying you." Harry chuckled, but he had a feeling that Hermione's and Ron's daughter would fix him up first.
Tom grinned and stretched, he was alive! No longer was he a half-spirit roaming around without a body. He now had the memories of Voldemort and was now at a young age of 27 thanks to the body he had absorbed, which had add their ages together. His 11 added to his own 16. He smirked when he realized the boy he had taken was also besotted with the Malfoy child. And seeing he had inherited his powers (surprising that a Ravenclaw could have been so dark) he could now work on getting sweet Draco for himself after he got rid of Potter, who was fool to think he would actually keep his promise.
The blonde belonged in his bed and he could already see himself waking up to him, making love to him and seeing him swell with his heirs.
Harry had been holding off his advances for a while now, but right now Draco looked utterly adorable and ravishing at the same time with this confused look on his face: his lips pouted with his head tilted and his soaked hair that caused the blond hair to stick to his face and out of place. His flushed cheeks were completely red and his clothes had turned see through and so Harry couldn't be blamed for what happened next.
Harry was jerked out of his thoughts when the door to his cell slammed open and dark glowing red eyes were glaring into his own.
But now, he definitely had to get that diary from Ginny. Maybe he could use her crush on him to his advantage...
"Oh wow, Harry! Look it's Viktor Krum!" Draco's voice shook him out of his thoughts and he turned to see Draco staring at Krum in awe as he flew around.
"Just like Pansy was your friend, Draco? She lead you to my arms and lead to Potter's imprisonment " Tom responded in a harsh tone, but immediately regretted when Draco looked like he had been slapped.
"I didn't cheat on him, you crazy bitch! You of all people know that I was planning to propose to him today, so why the hell would I cheat on him!" Harry shouted, his hand twitching to curse the bint. For a Slytherin, she and everyone else was too dense to see the truth.
"I knew something like this was going to happen." Draco muttered, "This is what happens when I hang out with you."
Harry smirked when he remembered the look on Dumbledore's face when it had been discovered that he had killed Tom. While the wizarding world had gone crazy with the news and the Ministry praised him, the Headmaster had looked at him stunned.
Although Harry would have liked to have sex (he was more than ready), Draco was still holding back. Not that he expected much, seeing as Draco hailed from a very conservative pureblood family, but still Harry wanted more. However, he didn't ask for more, knowing that it was one of the reasons, Draco believed that he had cheated on him.
Although Harry lived with Sirius, they were more than comfortable living independently as Sirius went out at nights trying to reclaim the years that had passed him by while he had been imprisoned and barely watched over him. But, seeing as Harry was a grown man in a child's body, he was more than happy to be left to his own devices as he spent all his time with Draco, sometimes socializing with the other Slytherins.
Harry sighed, tired of having the threat of Tom's wrath hanging over his shoulder. He needed to get rid of him and as soon as they got off the train, he'd go find Tom and end this now before coming home for the annual Malfoy Christmas party to announce his engagement.
"So, what now? I don't think we could use spells for this one." Harry muttered staring at the potions.
Draco looked at Harry in astonishment, but he was also grateful and he shivered when he thought about the hooded creature. When Harry reached over and cuddled him, kissing his temple, Draco smiled at him, accepting his warmth.
Harry kissed him and he felt his husband melt, "I am just worried that's all. These Ministry events are more than friendly get together and Cormac McLaggen has been after your connections for months now and this would be the perfect opportunity to-"
Of course, Harry knew what he was looking for and had already took and hid the sorcerers' stone, but he didn't need to know that. Besides he needed to get rid of Voldemort.
"I need to talk to you," Harry demanded, knowing exactly who he was dealing with. Although he might have spent his time snogging Draco, Harry was always aware of the happenings in his house.
"Ew! You should go see Madame Pomfrey about that. I'm pretty sure having a face coming out from the back of your head is unhealthy." Draco pointed out.
When Peter opened his eyes he recoiled in fright because there in the flesh was Sirius Black staring at him. As he came into consciousness, he realized that they were all in the Ministry and that he was in a jar.
That thought still made bile come to his throat and Harry pushed it back. He looked at Draco sigh over the flowers and he vowed to change things. This had been the reason he came to the past. It wasn't so Voldemort could get back his youth and have Draco! No, it was so Draco would be his and one day married and living with his sons!
Kreacher shrugged, he wasn't a part of that department. Harry set down his toasted cheese and went into the living room, leaning down to floo Hermione. Hermione had Fridays off from the ministry internship programme.
The first jinx came before Draco really prepared himself and he tried not to cry out in pain. But after the 5th or 6th one Draco had given up stifling whimpers of pain. He had lost count by the time he had been hit with the cruciatus curse. Using practises he had mastered while the Dark Lord had lived in his house, Draco retreated into a safe place in his mind and slipped unconscious.
Cornus resumed position outside of the door and Harry collapsed into one of the hallway chairs, his adrenaline wearing off. His brain clouded with thoughts of Draco,
‘Alright,’ thought Harry, ‘you win this round.’ And into the kitchen he went, where he had placed all the shrunken furniture from the living room on the kitchen table. He set down the book he had brought from the living room and his plans for how he wanted said room to look. Contrary to popular belief, Hermione wasn't the only one who planned. He opened one of the furniture catalogues and started paging through, bookmarking items he liked.
“Harry James Potter, I know you did not just say that to me!” Hermione hissed to him and Harry immediately regretted opening his mouth.
Potter has a friend in here? In Azkaban, a guard? Could it be the guard that seems to have an affinity for harming Draco? No, surely not…
He’d hand the letter to Kreacher just before he leaves in the morning, he thought as he snuggled down under his duvet.
“I know it may seem silly, Mr Potter, for a mother to put their child through so much but still claim to love him as fiercely as I do, but I’m sure you understand, one does what one must to protect those they love in the harshest of situations.” Narcisa had said to him with a grim smile on her face, and a pang of sorrow rang through Harry. He had written to Draco later that evening and the letter had sat on his desk for 2 whole days before he decided to send it to Draco.
He berated himself, and hoped Malfoy wouldn’t hate him for it, or sue him, or whatever the wizarding equivalent of that was.
Harry, not knowing what to do, looked back at Hermione who , who raised her eyebrows at him and looked towards the door leading into the prison, “Could I ask you a small favour,” Harry asked, turning back to the girl, “could my partner and I have a small tour? See we really want to be a part of the DMLE and this could really help us once we start solving cases..”
Draco Malfoy tuned out the fighting members of magic. He had dark rings around his eyes and his hair had become stringy, messy and growing into his face, no longer slicked back like before. His gray eyes, normally stormy and vibrant, had a glassy shean to them as though he was looking at things but not seeing them.
He wondered how his mother was doing, Potter had said she was fine, but she always kept her mask well in place, it was only him who could see past his mother’s mask. He learnt from a very young age that certain emotions were allowed for only certain close companions. He hoped she was keeping well, he knew she was only allowed two elves and she had kept the one that had raised her and the other had raised Draco. He hoped they were keeping her company and out of trouble. She could be feisty when the time called.
Kingsley sighed, then scribbled something on a spare piece of parchment, whispered an incarnation to this and it flew out the door. “You're not the first people to suspect this or come to me about this, and I’ve been building a case for a while.” he said.
“And this here is the Infirmary where prisoners or guards are treated if they are injured for any reason, this is also where prisoners have their first check ups when they arrive.”
Harry rushed into the room while Ron went off to find a medi-witch. He dropped the backpack at the foot of the bed and grasped Draco’s hand. As he did, grey eyes sprung open to meet him.
Draco could not remember him, but the name had sounded familiar, it was possible Aunty Bella had spoken about him once or twice. Often his name was in a sentence with the words “blood traitor” and “mudblood friends”.
Eventually, Draco woke up and once his eyes found Harry, he tried to force himself into a sitting position. But Harry guided him down and placed a few pillows behind his back to make him more comfortable. Draco opened his mouth to say something but the words seemed to die in his throat. Harry rushed forward and enveloped the blonde in a hug.
Potter was writing as though they were old friends and had never gone through a war. As though Draco was in some distant land and not stuck in Azkaban reading smuggled letters. And a small part of Draco secretly loved and looked forward to these letters, albeit he’d only received two so far. He put the letter down gently next to him and quickly finished his ‘dinner’. He then waited for the house elf to come back around to collect trays then he collected the letter that he had laid on the bed, hidden from view of the elf and carried it to the foot of his bed.
Malfoy lay in the bed, barely moving. The bandages around his head were soaked with blood, his hair was sticking up in funny positions and his face was badly bruised. Yet his chest rose and fell ever so slightly.
Draco opened his mouth once more and this time only did the words tumble out, “H-how?” he stuttered. Harry smiled at him, and stroked his bright hair out of his face.
“I’m just checking in, Molly wants to invite you to supper by the Burrow on Friday evening.” she said.
That first night, all Draco could think about was the way that potter had held his hand. It had been the first time in so long that someone, who wasn't his mother or a guard pulling and prodding at him to move faster, had touched him. The action had brought a wave of feelings that he had thought were firmly buried under shame and guilt from his school days.
Harry never realized how much him being in Slytherin would change things. First off, without Draco garnering for Harry's attention (and oh what a fool he'd been not realize that earlier) Slytherin was actually liked by other houses (tolerated at least), they didn't go out of their way to bully other students or laugh at them, except for when they did something stupid. Draco seemed to take Harry's request for friendship in stride, even more so when he ignored Ron. The red head didn't bother him either (mumbling about not being around dark wizards) after Harry didn't acknowledge him, not that Harry cared. He probably should've turned down Draco's request in a more polite manner, in the other timeline, not that it mattered now.
Warning! Ginny!bashing. No I don't hate her she's just hated in this story. Harry resents her for marrying him (even though he married her but go off sis)
Silver eyes looked at him confused, "But, what am I doing here? All I remember was being on the Hogwarts train and Harry-Where's Harry?!" He asked in a frantic tone.
He turned back and groaned out loud. He had given Draco his pajamas instead and he looked utterly adorable in them. Harry's pajamas were too big for him and were hanging off him and with his hair all askew, he just wanted to throw him against the bed and ravish him right there. Harry let out a sigh, he had to be responsible and so put Draco into bed as he stroked his hair, something he needed to do in order for Draco to fall asleep.
She looked like the exact copy of her father: platinum blonde hair to her waist, silvery eyes, pale skin and he couldn't be any prouder to say that she was his daughter.
Pansy giggled to herself. Harry had enlisted her help to keep Draco occupied, while he set up his proposal. They made such a cute couple. She and Draco were currently making their way back to the castle as Pansy had kept him busy all day and they were going back to Hogwarts to see what Harry had done.
As the school year passed by in relative peace, Harry knew that it was time and he made his move. He grabbed his invisibility cloak and made his way to the Gyffindor Tower. Since, he didn't have the Marauders' map since he wasn't friends with the Weasleys, he would have to be careful, but that didn't matter because he had memorized every shortcut, statue and portrait in Hogwarts.
"I think you should drink it, it was your idea." Harry suggested. Plus it gave him a reason to initiate the kiss and the thought of dominating Draco was a dream come true.
As expected the Durmstrang and Beauxbaton students sat with the Slytherins and Ravenclaws, another sign once again proving which houses were more superior. At least to him.
"Where did you get that?" Harry asked as he watched the pink tongue lick and his cheeks hollow as he sucked on the treat, "The trolley women hasn't come by yet, has she?"
Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Narcissa staring at them in amusement and knew instantly that he had her support. Lucius, on the other hand, looked furious as if he wanted to strike him dead on that very spot.
Suddenly, she felt like an idiot for ever thinking that she could compete with the way he looked at Draco.
"No!" Harry shouted and seeing Draco's expression, he coughed, "I mean I don't think there's another way out of here and I don't want to take the risk."
Harry shivered having been under the crucio before. Anyone who could make that feel like child's play was to someone that had be obeyed.
"Oh, when I was five, my father took me on a trip to Knockturn Alley and I got lost. That girl found me, but instead of helping me find my dad, she started dragging me somewhere else. She wouldn't let me go and she told me that I'd be perfect for her daughter. She was so mean and she would tell me to quit my blubbering because daddy wasn't here to save me. I thought she was going to take me away and that I wouldn't see my family again," Draco muttered as he got teary eyed at the memory.
With that in mind he dragged Draco to the dorms undressing him and searching for any mark or jewelry that Tom could have given to him, when Draco spoke up.
Harry is not a horcrux and is not connected to Voldemort. In fact, there are no horcruxes in this at all except the diary and that's useless since he used the diary to come back.
"I don't know who you really are nor do I trust you. You might have saved Draco and I am grateful, but he will not be spending the summer with you. For all we know it could be an elaborate trap-"
Draco had told him about the mysterious deaths his mothers suitors faced, leaving her with a large sum of money and that of her search for the fountain of youth, which Blasie feared that if she actually found it, she'd stay young forever and kill him in a second.
"Obvious, isn't it? The small one will send you forward, the large one will send you back, the three medium small ones are poison and the two large ones are wine. Unfortunately, the small one is only enough for one person." Draco muttered.
He watched as their eyes glazed over, "Perfect. Draco is spending the summer with me. When the summer is over, you Lucius and Narcissa, will think that Draco spent the summer at home and Draco will think that you two decided to let him stay over am I clear?"
"Wow, it's so pretty." Draco muttered holding up a necklace it was a silver chain with a green H on it and a green snake with silver eyes and a silver dragon with green eyes wrapped around the H.
That more than anything made Harry mad! How dare that bastard drag his pure Draco to the chamber! How dare he kiss his lips afterwards!
"Dad, what are you doing just standing there? We're going to be late." A loud voice said rousing him from his musings.
Harry inwardly grinned. These were the only people he trusted Draco to be alone with since there was no competition. He knew from the future that Draco had known he was gay for a while, something Harry had found surprising but it saved him the problem of dealing with a sexuality crisis.
Sirius smirked and wrapped Draco in his arms and grinned inwardly. It wasn't like he could go out with him! First of all, they were related and he looked just like his cousin Narcissa. Second he had his own lover and third the boy was too adorable for him to want in that way.
"N-" he couldn't lie and was compelled to tell the truth. Inwardly, he panicked as the words spilled out of his mouth, "Yes, I was."
"This is my home," Tom answered as he approached Draco and gently (although in a very commanding way) led him back to the bed.
The taller Slytherin glared at him and sneered, "Listen, Potter just because you're the almighty savior of the world doesn't give you the right to call me whenever you please."
Wide eyes looked at his friends, needing to believe that Harry loved him and what had happened was a mistake. But, he had seen that Harry was in his right mind! Draco stuffed another chocolate in his mouth, needing a distraction,
He managed to get Harry off guard and he was slammed back, his wand flying from his hand in the process.
Ginny did nothing wrong but marry Harry, Harry's just taking his frustration out on her. He ignores everyone and hates everyone except for Draco and sorta Sirius
"It was your Mudblood's mother doing, not your own." Tom replied, hoping that the slur against Lily Potter would make Potter overreact and lose his focus.
Harry scowled. He finally understood why Ron had despised Lockhart so much as he looked over at Draco, who was staring at said professor with an awed expression on his face.
"You know that I'm not. Want to know why? Because I find your voice annoying. So do me a favor and shut up."
"Somehow, I seriously doubt that." Harry grinned patting him on the head, "Isn't that right, Sirius?"
"Look, Draco there is a reason why Harry was waiting for you with roses and chocolates," Daphne responded as her eyes roamed over the disheveled bed and half eaten chocolates, "Pansy was helping him for a reason, alright? So, just go and apologize to Harry. You were wrong and he was right, now go make up and snog him already! Because if you don't, he's going to murder everyone from Draco withdrawal." Daphne ordered pushing him out of the room.
Harry took a deep breath looking around the ministry hall; if only his love came, it would all make it a little bit more bearable to be here.
"Wait," Harry said pulling away although part of his brain was protesting, "Is this for saving your life?"
Pansy breathed out harshly, feeling relief that she had finally been able to say what had been on her chest all these years, "Everyone loved you! Everyone! To them I was plain Pansy, pugged nose Pansy, who was nothing compared to Draco! Even Harry, especially Harry felt that way. Since the moment he laid eyes on you, he wanted. He spoiled you even before you even knew what a crush was. He always looked at you as if you were a gift from Merlin meant just for him. Hell, the Dark Lord feels the same way!"
Draco cry. especially when it deems me the reason for those tears. He has a pretty face and as beautiful as he looks crying, it honestly breaks my heart to see that."
Green eyes watched as Draco sobbed in pain, holding his chest. Harry knew what that memory meant to Draco.
"No, I don't think I will. I gave you a chance and you blew it. You'll be lucky if I ever decide to talk to you by fifth year." Draco sneered and turned to leave.
"Are you guys almost ready yet? The Ministry Gathering started half an hour ago?" Harry called out from his room, more than ready to leave.
When they had to choose their dragons, he was tempted to choose the tamest dragon. But decided that him beating the most aggressive dragon would help prove his worth, so he pretended to be shocked and horrified when he was told that he had picked the most aggressive dragon known. This time he hadn't bothered telling Cedric about the dragon; however he had managed anyways, and had received the highest score, but that was about to change.
Harry stormed down the castle angrily. Stupid bloody Anthony stealing his Draco, again! Studying together his arse! He stopped when he came upon the petrified form of Mrs. Norris on the walls next to the bloody words of
Tom didn't love, did he? Not if he saw him as nothing but a momentary distraction that could provide him with heirs and the Malfoy fortune.
Draco squealed and launched himself at Harry, who suddenly found his arms filled with one very happy blonde kissing him everywhere. Not that he was complaining.
Pansy nodded grimly before flinging herself at Harry, "Please be careful, even if you don't care for me, I love you."
"Oh! Who are you? You're not a Gryffindor." She asked in a far way tone as she slowly began to drift off.
Anthony stared at Draco and made a decision that he wanted him. The blond was like a precious doll and he would be his. However, he knew for a fact that Potter wanted him too, but what he didn't know was that Anthony was just as powerful as Potter could be. He was studious and interested in dark magic (not that he would tell anyone), but being a Ravenclaw meant that he practiced, used and perfected all sorts of spells and charms. As such, he was just as easily as powerful as Potter.
"Yes, sweet Merlin, yes!" Draco shouted, jumping into his arms, "I have to tell father, and mother and cousin Sirius and-"
Harry had finally gotten Lucius to accept the fact that he was planning on being with his son and had gotten his blessing along with the 'you better not hurt Draco' speech. In fact, he had got that speech from a number of people, Narcissa, Snape, Blasie, Pansy, Theodore, Daphne, Vincent, Greg and many more. Although, the only ones that actually scared him were Lucius, Snape and Narcissa, since they were three Slytherins you did not want to piss off.
"For the Yule Ball. I wanted you to ask. I thought the letters were from you and you would ask me to the ball, guess I was wrong," Draco trailed off, falling asleep.
"Don't rush us! Unlike you my kids know how to dress properly," Draco snapped from his closet as he rejected various robes, needing to find the perfect one. Even after all these years and all the functions they have attended, Draco was still very much a perfectionist.
"Harry Potter," McGonagall calls out and she has the sorting hat in her hand and he can't help, but frown. The potion worked a little too well; instead, he wanted to go back to the time before Goldstein asked out Draco and not repeat his school years. It would be more work, but maybe this way Draco would definitely be his. He looked around, eyes searching for Draco and spotted him sitting with Crabbe and Goyle, with a pout on his face.
Harry glared, pushing Draco behind him and clutching Quirell's face with his hands, "Nobody touches him, but me." He hissed, letting go and watching with amusement as Quirell's skin cracked and he turned to dust. Harry turned to Draco, who was watching him with awe.
The simple spell was easy to cast wandlessly and Harry withheld a laugh as tiny birds launched to the air, preventing the killing curse from reaching him.
"Thank-you, for saving my Draco," Nacrissa said as Draco blushed. Maybe Harry wouldn't have to use force-
Pansy stood watching it all with a happy smile. She knew it was wrong, but if she couldn't have him, nobody could. She looked down at the unconscious blonde in her arms and sighed, "You always got what you wanted, didn't you, Draco? The admiration, the love of men, of Harry. Hell, even the Dark Lord! But, it was never enough, was it? Never enough for you!"
Harry nodded, not saying anything to Draco's confession. He loved that his love trusted him enough to share things with him, even if the confession seemed random. There were several things that he didn't know that about the Malfoys and to be honest, he had truly been a fool to not see beyond their last name and Death Eater association to learn more. Though he hadn't really had a choice in the matter. Not wanting to linger on anymore depressing thoughts, Harry pulled out his wand and covered Draco's eyes. He whispered a spell that would change his life forever, after all it would give him the one thing he desire above all else.
As Harry laid in the dark, cuddling a sleepy, cute blond, thoughts raced through his head, making it impossible to sleep. If Voldemort wanted Draco, why allow his lackeys to talk about him like that? No doubt, he didn't really love Draco, only desired him for a short moment and Harry would never let anyone have Draco. No ever again. Still the fact that the dark lord wanted his Draco made it utterly impossible for them to live together in peace. Pity because Harry would have gone Dark just for Draco alone.
He let out a loud groan. This meant that he'd probably have to waste his time saving Ginny or he could just figure out a way to get the diary from her, but then again he could just let the bint die. After all, she was one the reasons why he couldn't be with Draco the first time around. He briefly wondered if she was still in love with him now that he was in Slytherin and shivered. He hoped not, although he could humiliate her...
Harry apparated home not caring that they can hear him and goes down to the basement and pulls out the potion he's been working on. He'll do anything it takes to make sure that Draco was his. Draco would be his forever and ever and with that thought in mind he downs the potion as everything goes black.
He then noticed someone glaring at him and turned to see Harry glaring at him while watching Draco out of the corner of his eye and Sirius got it. His godson thought that he wanted him! Well, wasn't that was so cute. Look like he already did have someone wrapped around his fingers.
"Tight," Harry muttered as he rains kisses over Draco's face and body to relax him. He can't wait to be inside his blonde love as he should have been long ago, but he won't hurt Draco.
"Hello, Potter." Tom said apparating to the dueling ring. Harry noticed that there were no Death Eaters in sight.
Last time he faced the dragon he had a nice idea, but it could have been better and know he had that chance. He looked in the crowd and spotted Draco's worried face and winked at him, blowing him a kiss which he pretended to catch and fawn over while the rest of the stands went crazy trying to figure out who the Harry Potter was blowing kisses to. As he faced the dragon, he smirked and pulled out his wand. He would be done in about five seconds or less.
Harry was just surprised that the Prophet hadn't picked it up, seeing as this would be the wedding of the century. After all, he was the Potter heir and the Boy-Who-Lived, while Draco was the Malfoy heir, but he shrugged it off.
Harry stood outside the door stunned, scratching his head wondering what that was about and shrugged it off as one of the blonde's melodramatics. Although, it was crappy timing. He was about to propose after all. As soon as Harry went downstairs, he automatically knew something was wrong as everyone was staring at him like he had destroyed their only hope.
The reception was beautiful as well. The cake was outstanding, but all Harry could think about was the honeymoon and how wonderful it would finally be to thrust into that tight body.
To say that he was shocked at his transformation would be an understatement. He had studied the animagus spell before, the Marauders being the inspiration, and had attempted it unsuccessfully.
Lucius' eyebrow rose in amusement. He doubted that the brat could pull it off, "So, what will you do if I say no?"
"You mean to say that I "cheated" on the person I loved since I was eleven with the school tramp that everyone and I mean everyone and their brothers has fucked? Because Parkinson, you are stupider that I once believed if you believe that!"
Some of his quirks were cute like his need to keep everything tidy and clean. Others, however, were annoying and unbelievable like the fact that it took him two hours every morning to get ready for the day and to go to sleep each night, which honestly baffled Harry.
"So, why should I let you marry my son?" The Malfoy Lord asked in cold amusement. It was not everyday that his son had both the Dark Lord and the Savior wrapped around his finger. Although Lucius didn't want anyone near his baby boy, his only child he might add, his Malfoy mind couldn't help, but approve of the situation. No matter how this war turned out, the Malfoys would be on top.
Draco moaned and moved before falling back to sleep once more. As he did, Tom noticed the ring on his right hand.
He raked his head for any reason Draco might be annoyed with him before it hit him, "Look I'm sorry for not accepting your friendship. That was stupid. I wasn't thinking straight but I really want to be friends with you."
He shivered in delight when Harry carried him to bed, slowly undressing him carefully, his green eyes showing his awe.
"I thought that you were mad at me?" Harry asked, unable to believe that Draco had come to him willingly.
The rubies were also shaped in a rose surrounded by a heart shaped diamond. It was beautiful. Soon Draco would be his and no one would be able to take him away from him.
"Oh, so not only are you a cheater, but you're a liar too." Pansy added in a snide tone and Harry felt himself slowly snap.
Harry narrowed his eyes. Something was up, but for now he would make sure Voldemort never got near his Draco again. Maybe it was time that he put his plan into action...
Harry scowled. That simply would not do, who knows how many other men or women could be after Draco by then? None of them were worthy of
Apparently, this was the wrong thing to say because some of the Ministry officials sneered at him before pouring a liquid down his throat.
"Well, I don't know about you, but I suck at chess and this is a giant chess board so obviously we have to play to get across."
On the bright side, he had gotten to second base with Draco, which consisted of groppage, frottage, hand jobs, and blow jobs. Draco may not have known what he was doing, but he certainty made up for it with his enthusiasm and eagerness to learn. Plus, Harry always came like mad when his large eyes submissively rolled up to look at him with his cock in his mouth. He was a horny little bugger not that Harry minded.
"Well, the Dark Lord is going to attack the train and during the commotion I'm supposed to take Draco to his mansion, while his other Death Eaters keep you at bay or kill you themselves."
Harry had already brought them a small house to live in when they graduated and he hoped it was enough, although Draco might want to live in a Manor. However, all he needed was an engagement ring and Draco was good as his.
Harry snickered to himself. Apparently, Tom was still trying to get the prophecy and he had no bait to lure him there. Sirius was in America in some place called Vegas and he couldn't use any of his friends because they were Draco's friends too and he might show up there instead and he didn't want to hurt him.
From his conversation with Narcissa, Harry knew that Draco got his high maintenance from his mother. In fact, he had to buy him a gift to quell his anger for not telling him about Sirius. His gift had been a mood ring, luckily for him Draco didn't know much about the muggle world so he had gotten away with gifting him one, that someone might win from an amusement park, he enchanted to actually work though. Of course, not being a muggle Draco had no idea what it was, but since nobody in the wizarding world would have one, it was technically considered one of a kind.
"What are you doing?" Draco asked more as a reflex than actual confusion. He loved being spoiled after all.
When Draco woke up he let out a gasp as he looked around and frowned, wasn't he talking to Anthony? But, how did he get to his room and why was he covered in blood? Or was it paint? He shrugged and got up making his way to the bathroom. Maybe Tom could explain later.
Harry savored the word and it made him happy. Draco was all his no one else's, not Tom's and definitely not Anthony's, only his now and forever. He didn't focus on the vows being said; oh no, he was picturing his wedding night, his Draco laid before him, his own virgin sacrifice.
. Harry grinned pulling his blonde in for a kiss that was just a tad inappropriate for the audience members.
He looked to see his eldest son Scorpius Edward Malfoy-Potter at age 19 staring at him with his arms crossed tapping his feet. Scorpius or as the triplets liked to call him Scor, had messy black hair like his own and grey eyes. He was a carbon copy of himself minus his eyes right down to horrible glasses.
Pansy's jaw dropped at the insult and unable to handle anything more, she ran to the girl's dorms in tears. Harry just watched her as some of her friends glared at him.
"Aw, maybe he'll let me have him when he's done or I can watch." The second protested and Harry growled. Draco would never belong to Voldemort nor would he be some sex toy that was passed around! Harry narrowed his eyes. He would find that man and destroy him for ever daring to talk about Draco like that.
“We managed to stabilise him, we cleaned up all of his cuts and healed 2 broken ribs and a shattered femur, we did find quite a substantial amount of curse damage and he might have trouble casting any spells for a while, but it will come back and heal overtime. He is under a stasis charm just to help his body heal. I will be providing a detailed report to the Aurors with a list of charms that we can sense has been used on him.” Myrle finished, looking towards Cornus.
Harry lay on the floor of his study, or well he had claimed it as his study, he had yet to make any changes to the place. But it had a desk, a comfy chair and a bookshelf, all the makings of  a good study, or so he hoped. A painting hung on the far wall, of a gruesome battle he had no idea when had taken place. Because it was a magical painting, the poor victims were slain over and over by a dark hooded man on a black horse. He really should get rid of that painting, he thought to himself as he winced, watching the people under horsefoot getting trodden on.
“The baby is not going to care what you are wearing, Draco.” Harry said as he got up to kiss his fiance’s head.
It had been about 45 minutes since they had started their tour, Rosetta had found it of utmost importance to show them every room in painstaking detail all while twirling her hair and making eyes at Harry. Hermione was reaching her limit. They had perked up at the mention of the infirmary.
“To Malfoy'' the envelope read, in the most untidy scrawl ever, and Draco’s pulse sped up for different reasons. It was from Potter. Had Potter finally come to his senses and realized that Draco was the evil monster the Ministry officials had painted him to be? Nervously he opened the letter and it read:
Rosetta’s eyes widened and she looked out towards her boss’ office, “I’m not really supposed to allow non-staff into that area but…” she trailed off and Harry did his best to smile warmly at her, it must have worked because she blushed again, “I guess since you
“Rosetta, please stop shrieking.” she scolded the secretary. It was then that Olive burst through the Infirmary doors with the head guard behind them.
Harry looked at Draco once more, he looked so peaceful in his sleep. His face had regained some of its colour and his hair was no longer bloody. Harry reached for his hand and held on to him. He then moved forward and put his head on the bed. And before he knew it, he was once again asleep, holding his ex-arch nemesis' hand.
“Hermione mentioned you were starting this stuff, I think you’re bloody mental to do it all yourself, there are wizards who do this sort of thing.”
It had been less than 5 minutes since they’d been shoved out the room when Kingsley came strolling down the passage. “Hello Harry, Ron, Hermione,” he greeted them all, “Just came to see our patient and deliver an update. How is he?”
“Uh… no, no I don't, he’s still in Azkaban isn't he?” Harry asked, doing his best to not be suspicious. Luna shrugged, and told him that Draco had appeared in her dream and she hoped he was okay, then she apparated out of his living room.
Although the two had only apparated mere seconds after Draco and the medi-witch, by the time Harry had returned his feet to solid ground, the doors to one of the curse damage wards were already swinging shut.
Harry pricked up at that, that didn't seem right. He shot a look at Hermione who sent a similar one back as they followed Rosetta into the ward.
Hermione’s eyebrows came together in a concerned expression, “have you been sleeping? Are the nightmares back?”
In came Ron and Hermione, Ron was holding a plate of food and Hermione had a backpack slung over her shoulder. They both had grim expressions and exchanged a look when they noticed the twos conjoined hands.
Harry nodded acceptingly then turned and faced Kingsley, “Where will Draco be going now since Azkaban is clearly dangerous?”
Hermione’s eyes were large with worry yet when Harry looked at her, he could see that she was fighting the urge to rage. “I’m going to test his vitals now,” Hermione said, addressing Harry more than Malfoy. Harry nodded and held Draco’s hand as firmly as he could without it being too painful for the emancipated man.
Later that night, Harry lay in bed thinking about his day. After lunch with Ron, they had stayed at the Leaky talking to Hannah Abbot, who was dating Neville and had passed on the invite to rip up part of Grimmauld Place on the weekend. From there the pair had walked across to Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, where George had chastised Ron for taking ‘a lunch so long I’ve aged 7 years and got married’. Ron had simply rolled his eyes and got back to work, pulling Harry into the backroom to assist with a series of tasks.
Harry sat down in his new study, appreciating the new furniture that had been installed to write a letter to Draco.
“Harry, we need to find a way into the Infirmary ward” Hermione whispered to him, hiding her face from the witch seated at the desk in front of them.
“We’re waiting for the medi-witch to tell us, sir, she’s in there with him now.” Hermione answered, while Harry was still pacing around the corridor.
There was a sharp rap at the door and someone entered on Kingsley’s command. “This is Olive Felide, they’ve been secretly investigating and building a report on this, take a seat Felide.”
The first letter came within a week of Draco being in Azkaban. Well, technically he had found it, hidden underneath the grey slop they had named stew. He had no idea how it had gotten there and hoped it wasn’t cursed and sent to kill or maim him for his crimes. His pulse quickened as he picked it up, hoping for a simple and painless death.
Draco rolled over and pulled the blanket over his back, making any attempt to shade himself from the oncoming onslaught. The footsteps stopped right outside the door and Draco tried to steady his breathing to seem asleep.
Except Harry didn't get the chance to, Kreacher appeared in the kitchen on Friday afternoon, just as Harry was taking his toasted cheese sandwich out of the machine.
Harry smiled wider at the two of them, he’d always wanted someone like that to bicker and banter with, his eyes drifted to the pale hand still in his grasp,
Harry studied the letter but his attention was quickly pulled from it when the owl nipped at him looking for treats. He made his way to the fireplace where a jar of owl treats sat. He threw one at the owl who deftly caught it and flew out the open window. With a sigh, Harry headed up the stairs to one of the spare rooms in order to prepare it for Draco.
They took in the scene laid out in front of them. A shrieking secretary, a bound guard yelling into the floor, Hermione, standing over said guard. And Harry standing over the only occupied bed where the patient seemed to be shaking.
“Okay so what’s the issue mate.” Ron asked. He was seated next to Hermione and hadn’t touched his food.
He only got about 3 hours of sleep before he woke up with a start. Myrle was in the room, checking Draco’s vitals. Harry sat up and rubbed his face with his hands, “How is he?” he asked.
His fiance however, had long since given up with doing his hair and let it live the life it wanted. Although Draco never put on much weight, Harry had bulked up over the years, putting muscle on and replacing the scrawny boy that left Hogwarts. After Draco’s sentence had finished, Harry started offering to do wizarding home renovations and pretty soon Draco had joined him doing interior design. Together they had built a beautiful brand.
Wow Harry, really laying it on thick aren’t you?” Hermione said almost gleefully, “Ron is going to love this.”
After changing the bedding as Mrs Weasley had instructed to do when he was expecting a guest, he summoned Kreacher to ask if he would collect the letters that were in Malfoys cell in fear of someone else finding them and reporting them. Kreacher nodded then popped into thin air only to return less than 5 minutes later with the small stack. Harry thanked him, set them down on the table and headed back to his fireplace to floo back to St Mungo’s in order to allow Ron and Hermione time to go home.
Draco would be sleeping in a room across the hall from Harry, in a room Harry hoped would suit Draco’s high standards.
Meanwhile, in London, a Mr Harry Potter lay in a spare bedroom in Grimmauld Place, thinking over how he had grabbed and held Malfoy’s hand, a feeling of dread crept into his heart. He hadn’t asked for consent…
Harry smiled back at her, “Hi Luna, I’m-” he trailed off, he wasn't quite sure how he was. Luna smiled, and patted the bench she was on, signalling him to sit next to her, before Harry could think, his gaze snapped to the doors to Draco’s room.
“And I brought some food for you, it’s not much but I have a feeling you haven't eaten since yesterday lunchtime.” Ron piped up, setting the food down on the side table.
She picked up on the second ring, “Hi Harry, I’ve been meaning to speak to you about-” her words died in her throat when she saw his expression, “Harry, what’s wrong, what happened?”
The cell was hardly a room, it was barely 2 and a half meters across and 3 metres wide.  As you entered the door, the ‘bed’, although it was more of an army cot, was on your right and on the left in the far corner was a simple toilet and handbasin. There was a tiny window opposite the door that had some sort of charm on it that prevented any rain from coming in. But didn't keep the cold out.
“Right! That's it, I really ought to be getting him away now Mr Potter.” the guard, Barnaby says. Potter nods, letting go of Draco’s hand and thanking the guard. Potter flashed one last smile at Draco before he was pulled away towards the fireplaces.
“Would you mind if I spoke to Draco, it’d only take a minute.” Potter said, sounding hopeful. The guard nodded, smiling at Potter and stepped a few paces away, shooting threatening glances at Draco.
Harry nodded, his eyebrows furrowed trying desperately to recall which day it was exactly. Hermione, sensing his confusion, alerted him to the fact that it was Tuesday. Harry nodded, thankful, while calculating how long Draco had been in Azkaban for. 2 weeks, 6 days.
About 10 minutes later, the trio was seated in Kingsley Shacklebot’s office, explaining to him while doing their best to leave out the bits of information that could get Harry into some serious trouble.
Harry shook his head, “I havent been caught, as far as I know, no one knows what I’ve done except Kreacher and now you two.”
Even though the Dementors had been removed, courtesy of Granger, there was still an air to this place that tended to sap all the energy and hope from his soul.
The house elf waited patiently as Draco sluggishly moved forward. “Excuse me,” Draco said in a voice that sounded strained and foreign, “could you please cast an Episkey on my cut?” Draco asked the elf, moving his body so the cut faced the elf.
“I just don't see why a boy of his status should get a lower status, after all he carries the mark and…”
Hermione finished conveying a message to her patronus and it bounded out of the room. It then fell silent in the room and Harry turned back to Draco, whose eyes still seemed to be darting around the room.
“He’s doing a lot better, his bones are majority healed and all of his injuries are mended, we want to keep him for observation for a few more days so we can check his magical core and then he’ll be free to return…” Myrle trailed off not knowing where the blonde boy was going.
“What's going to happen to him, since he’s got friends in Azkaban?” Harry asked, his eyes never leaving the ward doors.
“You have a patient in here and no one monitering their vitals? Have they even seen a doctor?” Hermione questioned, her autoriatina voice taking over.
“Sir, I am going to have to ask you to please take a seat next to the screaming woman, I have already contacted my colleagues.” Olive said, calmly as they walked over to Harry, “Hermione, cast a muffliato please.”
It was then that Myrle entered the room with Ron behind her, “Right, I'm going to have to ask you all to leave while I do some checks, you can come back later.” She said as she shooed the trio out the doors and closed them behind her with a flick of her wand.
Harry shook his head, and carefully extracted his hand out of the sleeping man's grasp. He then took the bag from Hermione and gave them both a hug before setting off to find the showers.
Harry watched them leave then nodded to Cornus before entering the ward. Draco lay on a bed in the middle of the room, machines beeping next to him and the slight movement of his chest was the only signal that he was alive. Harry collapsed into the chair next to the bed and let out a sigh, he then leaned back and let sleep overtake him.
“Well, he’s doing a lot better, but I’ve put him to sleep so that his core will heal faster, he’ll be under for the next 5 hours at least, I suggest you use that time to let a variety of people know and ready your home for his transit.” Myrle said with a nod to Harry. She then picked up Draco’s file and left the room with a nod to the others.
“Hermione, he doesn't deserve to be in there and they’re going to kill him if he stays any longer. He was a child, we all were.” Harry said, the anger bubbling up again, “We can't let this go on.”
And that was how Harry found himself standing in what he guessed was the lobby of Azkaban. Hermione had summoned a clipboard out of nowhere and started taking notes, of what Harry had no idea. Harry tugged at the collar of his standard DMLE uniform that had been issued to him. Olive had disappeared into one of the offices to talk to the head guard about ‘important business’.
Harry had just stepped out of his floo when a tawny owl landed on his windowsill and pecked at the window, asking to be let in. With a sigh he walked over and allowed it in, the owl landed on the armrest of the nearest couch before holding out its leg where there was an attached letter.
Harry Potter was not having luck, none at all. Hermione had provided him with a series of books and manuals of home decor and renovations and DIY, but none of it seemed to be working at all. He was currently trying to remove the ghastly green carpet from his living room but it seemed to be stuck down with industrial grade sticking charms. He had gone through nearly all the charms in the books and none of them seemed to be doing much.
Harry stood up and walked towards the painting on the wall and took it down. Progress, he thought. Turning around slowly, Harry headed over to his desk and took a seat whilst pushing his hair out of his eyes, his mind wandering to how Malfoy was. He picked up his quill and began writing a quick note to Ron and sent it off with a barn owl named Rocky which was a gift from Hagrid, who had sobbed upon hearing the news about Hedwig, before starting yet another letter to his supposed ex-arch nemesis.
Hours or minutes could have passed and Draco would not have known. a slow shuffling and quiet grumbling woke him from what he guessed was a deep sleep. It was a house elf delivering the evening's meal. Draco krept forward to the bars of his cell to receive his meal.
And honestly, he shouldn't be surprised by Granger’s interest and keen, albeit, annoying way of sticking her nose in everything, she did enough of that during their time at school. A pang of guilt rang through Draco at the thought of Weasley joining the other twin because… because… Draco stopped that train of thought. He knew the train of thought well, and he knew where it led him. He promised his mother and Pansy that he’d not fall into that pit, after they’d found him with slashes down his wrist after a particular bad thought.
Harry was seated in the chair next to the bed holding Draco’s hand when the blonde’s eyes opened and seemed to dart around the room before they landed on Harry. A smile spread across Harry’s face as the blonde's eyes slid shut once more and fell back asleep. This occurred twice over the next 3 hours each time Draco would only still once he found Harry.
The following Tuesday, Harry picked up a book on gardening and how best to treat the plants that Neville had deemed dangerous. Luna popped in on Wednesday,  just as he was getting ready to tackle some of the less dangerous weeds and promptly joined him. Luna told him all about her latest article that she was putting into the Quibbler and how best to prevent nargles from infesting his home.
“I’ll talk to the Ministry, but that should work, I’ll be in touch.” with that Kingsley said his goodbyes and made his way down the corridor.
Draco’s heart was pounding uncontrollably and a thick fog filled his head drowning out the rest of the proceedings. He jolted when one of the guards tugged his arm sharply and he followed down the passage towards the fireplaces that the prisoners used.
They didn't have to wait much longer as the doors opened and they were allowed to enter the room again.
“It’s just Harry, Kreacher” Harry tried to correct him. But Kreacher pulled a face and continued talking.
“He can't stay here, he needs to go to St Mungo’s now.” Hermione whispered to Harry, paying no mind to the secretary who stammered out a protest but fell silent when Harry looked at her.
It was nearing the 6th hour since Mediwitch Myrle had placed Draco in a peaceful sleep when the blonde started to awaken. Ron and Hermione had left about 2 hours prior, since they insisted on sticking around an hour longer to make sure everything was okay. But finally, both of them dead on their feet, they headed home.
Harry shook his head, “Haven’t done shopping in ages, there might be some Chinese takeout in the fridge and possibly cheese?”
And that is how the letter found its way underneath Draco Malfoy’s slop, with a waterproofing charm on it.
“Antone, what are you doing here? Are you the one caring for the patient? They won’t let me leave!” Rosetta said, leaning forward in her seat.
The room was dusty, and had a sour smell. All except one bed was empty, except for that there was no one else in the room.
2 hours after they arrived at St Mungo’s, the medi-witch came out of the ward and made a bee-line for Harry. Hermione had joined him about an hour after he had arrived at the hospital and Ron had shown up about 15 minutes later, bringing along some hot coffee and baked goods from Mrs Weasley. As the witch approached, Cornus joined the trio to hear the news.
Footsteps could be heard hurrying down the passage. Draco’s eyes stopped darting around the room and finally focused on Harry, his eyes grew and he gasped. Draco tightened his grip on Harry’s hand and seemed to shrink into himself. He pulled his legs up towards his body and began shaking.
“Well Hermione might, you know how she was when you wore that red jersey last week.” Draco countered. Hermione had been rushed to St Mungo's last night for early labour and had been patiently waiting for her first daughter to arrive. As the two godfathers, Draco and Harry were instructed to be there at a very specific time (3:27 pm) by a very emotional Hermione. And no one dared question.
“Kreacher, who is in charge of Azkaban?” Harry asked, trying to control the rage that had bubbled up inside him.
“Master, Harry,” Kreacher began again with more attitude than was necessary, “I’ve come to return your letter.”
A few minutes later, Harry finally felt clean. He headed back to Draco’s room and was surprised to find Luna seated outside the room.
A cold chuckle was heard from the passage outside his cell and then the sound of footsteps walking away. Draco sighed and slumped down against the wall, hanging his head.
“Harry! You can't do that! Have you been caught, is this why you called asking about Levert?” Hermione sounded indignant.
He thought to himself with wonder. Casting a tempus charm, Harry realised that it had been 5 hours since he was in Kingsley’s office. He sighed and got up from his chair to walk a lap around the corridor.
Harry smiled and heard Hermione scoff behind him, “Of course, do you have a pen and paper?” Rosetta nodded and handed him a quill with a pink glittery feather and Harry signed the page and handed it back to her. She looked like she was about to pass out from glee.
Harry looked down at him, he was still unconscious and glowing faintly. Harry sighed, he was still exhausted.
Luna, sensing his apprehension smiled sweetly at him, “He’s really strong, and very lucky to have a friend like you.” she got up and gave him a hug.
Ron turned back to Harry, “Moine and I’ll stay here and let you know if anything goes wrong, I wouldn't be surprised if the ponce decides to sleep for a good 10 hours.” he said with a smirk.
They stayed like that for long, only breaking apart when Draco’s sobs had stopped. Harry summoned a glass of water and handed it to Draco, who drank long from it, draining the glass and looking at Harry who wordlessly filled it once more, yet Draco only sipped from it this time.
“Lay with me?” Draco asked tentatively and Harry smiled with a nod as he climbed onto the bed next to Draco and he cuddled up into him.
