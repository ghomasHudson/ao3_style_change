“Yeah!” half the team shouted.
“Do you want to go back in?”
He avoided the Manor by a wide berth, but behind it he spotted a roof behind a copse of trees about a Quidditch pitch’s length away, and what was more, there was smoke coming out of the chimney. Somebody was home, and Harry hoped it was Draco.
had come to the game today, all of Harry’s friends, and Ginny’s friends and her family—including her parents, whom Harry still hadn’t gone to see since his break up with Ginny—Harry’s own family, in the form of Teddy (who did not have a game of his own to play today, and who was there with both Andromeda and Draco’s mum), and friends of friends and family. Millicent was sitting with Pansy and Padma and some girl Harry didn’t recognise, and on the other side of Draco were Blaise and Gilliam and some girl who looked like she could’ve been Gilliam’s identical twin. Dean and Seamus were there with what looked like Dean’s siblings, Rhosyn was there with the rest of the Harpies. Everyone.
By all accounts it was normal to have unpacked boxes for a long time—George used to joke that he dealt with so many boxes at work that he just couldn’t be arsed to deal with those at home—but the boxes made Harry uneasy. Like they hadn’t finished moving in together, like the process could be interrupted, reversed, made undone.
“Maybe. I…” Harry rubbed his eyes. “I’m not sure I can do it alone. I don’t know where to start, or where to get two more players, or uniforms, or—” He cut himself off with a wave of his hand. “Or the paperwork.”
In the romance novels he’d read with Draco there was always a big moment after the break up, the Black Moment that Draco loved so much (well, in the novels anyway), so it stood to reason that if this was their break up scene, then Harry should do something big—only, there was no airport to chase after Draco in, and there was nowhere he could publicly declare his love for him either (and more to the point, he wasn’t sure Draco would enjoy a public spectacle). But he could get him a gift, maybe, and prepare a speech, and go knock on his door?
“There is?” Harry asked, interested despite himself. “But…” He had his days full, with both the daycare and his regular archive shifts and now also the Little League. “Do I get my own office?”
The table erupted into laughter.
And Draco had come home with Harry instead of Apparating to his own home, and the bathroom had been quiet in a kind of magical way as they’d stood there, tiredly brushing their teeth and washing their faces and not talking. Draco had looked contemplative and Harry had looked at him in the mirror, at the damp strand of hair falling over Draco’s forehead, and thought that it wasn’t possible to be more in love than he was, right at that point in time.
It was not Draco.
“It occurred to me that I wasn’t entirely fair,” Draco said, directing Harry to follow him into the kitchen.
“What is it, then?” Ginny asked as the doors closed.
“Close enough. We’ve set a moving date—two weeks from now, so we’ve moved the schedule up a little.” Dean grinned, then his expression softened as he glanced at Seamus. “It’ll be fantastic to get out of the city. I love it here—grew up here and all—but there’s something to be said for the lush Irish hills, you know? There’s a kind of peace and magic there you don’t find in the city.”
“Ready to go?” Draco asked, having come up. He put a hand on Harry’s shoulder, his grip firm and reassuring.
“What are you looking at coroner reports for?” Harry finally asked.
Malfoy had stopped just a few steps from the store. A customer exited and brought with them the scents from inside. Harry grabbed the door before it closed, and gestured for Malfoy to go in.
“You’ve got the head for it,” Mildred added. “And I believe there’s a course starting in a few weeks at the College.”
“He once suggested it and I said no and then he said okay,” Harry said. “I mean, what I actually said was I hate sex and that I wished it didn’t exist. And he said okay. And then nothing happened.”
“No, wait, sorry, that was rude of me—let me look that up for you,” Harry scrambled to say, already flicking through the ledger, a large leather-bound volume which permanently resided on the desk. “Coroner reports, was it?”
He needed this to be over.
Let’s move in together.” Draco had turned strangely intense and speculative. “How do you feel about living in a barn?”
show?”
“I want to,” Malfoy said. “I didn’t expect—but I want to. What did you have in mind, for this date?”
All the same, the whole thing appealed to every fibre of Harry’s being—training a little team from the ground up, seeing them through a couple of games, helping them win a trophy, and at the same time raise money for a charity of his own choosing? Harry could think of more than a few causes he wouldn’t mind putting his support behind.
“No? How do you try a bath bomb? I regret to admit our instructor didn’t tell us much about them.”
“Harry?” Mildred appeared in the doorway to the break room. “There you are, love. I think your friend is waiting for you.”
“Oh.” Malfoy blinked. “I would like that, thank you.”
“Do people give you grief about…you know.” In the first years after the War, it’d been near intolerable. Grief and anger had run rampant, and those who’d allied themselves with Voldemort had taken a lot of abuse, even as they waited for their trials. It’d been miserable, and they hadn’t even had their own government and judiciaries to sort it all out; the dust had barely settled in Hogwarts before a delegation from Europe had shown up to clean up the mess.
“That’s what my therapist says.” Harry took in a deep breath. “She’s talked a lot about patterns and finding my own limits and…stuff like that. It’s—it’s kind of what I was trying to do, really. I wanted…I mean, I’m not sure what I really wanted, but it was only a matter of time before we’d have to have sex, right, and I didn’t want it to be too long because that’d just mess things up, and I wanted to see if I could find out what I can do before it starts feeling awful, and…” Harry trailed off, not really sure how to continue, and either way, Draco was looking at him like he was going to cry. He hadn’t even gotten to the part about PCD yet.
“Is that when we should’ve broken up?”
“This,” Harry said, gesturing at the shelf. “He, well, he likes romance novels. The really dramatic ones. But he also likes science fiction and fantasy—I think science fiction a bit more? He likes the ones with queer characters and relationships in them. Uhm. I don’t know what else. I don’t know which ones he already has, aside from that one.” He indicated the book Draco had lent him the first time around, the one with the spaceship on the cover. The one about the mixed crew of humans and aliens and the varied ways they loved each other.
Malfoy nodded. “Right. All right. Bye.” He nodded again, then turned and walked away.
Draco was shaking his head even as Padma was answering. “It’s been repaired once before magically, but the spell wore off and it broke again in the same place.”
“I don’t doubt that you love me,” she said, after a while. “But you don’t want me. You…having sex with me, it’s like a chore, for you. And I deserve better, you know? I want more than…that.” Her lip was wobbling, now, but she wasn’t crying.
“Yeah,” Harry said and then he finally caught up and realised
Harry drew his wand over the ledger and compiled a request form: coroner reports, all-inclusive, the British Isles, 19th century. The form filled itself out and Harry went over it to check that the parameters he’d set were right. “Uh, Malfoy, that’s over three thousand documents…are you sure you don’t want to narrow it down further?”
Harry wasn’t sure what to do with that information. How had that gone down? “When?”
“Gay ones?” Harry asked. “There are
“The pub?” Malfoy’s shoulders stiffened. “Uhm.”
, but they keep writing stories about magic—wildly inaccurate but nonetheless amazingly imaginative stories—and many of them are superstitious, which is a certain kind of belief in magic, and they have folklore and mythologies that clearly stem from a much older time, from before the Statue of Secrecy, that they still adhere to to a degree, and there’s the entire alternative medicine thing, which closely resembles magic but isn’t, and—” He flushed red.
“If you’re trying to make friends with our resident murder boy, you’re not being very good at it,” Albert said from somewhere behind Harry, almost startling him off his chair.
He was still struggling with whatever emotions he was having about Malfoy, and the lack of sleep was seriously catching up with him. Looking at twelve kids—
“Does everybody really deserve a happy ending?” he asked.
He didn’t even use his wand, just let all his accumulated feelings of disgust and anxiety and hatred of that fucking bed and everything that had happened in it flow out through his fingertips, and vanished the damned thing.
wanted to talk to
“Not too busy to hang out with
Harry knelt in front of them, first aid kit open. “No,” he said. “A little bit. I’m disappointed more than I’m angry.” He gave Betty a reusable ice pack. “Hold that against your lip, yes, like that.”
scared.”
It’d been a while since Ginny had gone home to the Burrow after a fight, and Harry had honestly thought…thought what? That they were past that kind of difficulties? If anything, the difficulties they’d been having had only become more pronounced now they didn’t have other people to hide behind.
“You were a terrible captain at Hogwarts,” she said, but her eyes were twinkling. “But you’re not on the team this time. I hear you’re great with the kids on your little hobby team.”
“Do I have to wear Muggle clothes?”
“Hullo,” Harry said in greeting the moment Malfoy came through the front door. He’d been waiting for him to turn up; he’d already been filled in on his new rota of tasks and seen to two of the research rooms and all that was left was Malfoy. “How’s our favourite murder boy today?”
“Okay?” Harry wanted to touch him again, but now it seemed like he couldn’t. “Why not?”
“I’ll come,” Draco said, slowly. “For moral support, correct? You’re not bringing me because you harbour some secret hope that I’ll hex your cousin six ways to Sunday?”
“Of course I have,” he said.
“No,” Harry said. “So long as my schedule won’t change. But I like being at the front desk.”
“I’m not sure I follow. Are you saying you…don’t…” Draco trailed off, frowning. “Could you try to explain?”
Malfoy looked up from the report he was pouring over. There was a thin wrinkle in his forehead. “It is that hour, is it?” He sounded distracted. “My apologies.” He glanced at the report, then at the trolley. “I haven’t finished.”
“You mean you were looking forward to watching
“I mean, I don’t…
“Okay, so…” he said eventually. “How do I…get out of that pattern? How do I get to a point where…it’ll be all right?” It was all getting too much now. “You said sex should be a
, but Harry didn’t like putting them together.
“Yes,” Harry said, glancing down at himself. He should probably do something about that. “I’m. Uhm.”
Harry was very aware that Blaise hadn’t brought a guy to the pub before and, as far as he knew, was straight…or had been. Nobody at the table was commenting on it, or in some other way drawing attention to it—it wasn’t that it bothered Harry, but he was unsettled anyway, as if something had gone off-script.
“Okay. Yes. When? Is it a date? Are you taking me to a Muggle store for a date?” Malfoy looked entirely too pleased about this. “Should I wear Muggle clothes?”
“Rhosyn Jones? She’s dating Ginny,” Harry interjected. “Rhosyn from the Harpies?”
“I’m trying not to,” Draco answered, his voice thick and cracky.
“That…would potentially send the wrong signal,” Malfoy agreed. “You really want me to have one?”
“Right,” Malfoy said. The crease deepened and his eyebrows did a funny thing that made him look uncertain. That, paired with the still flaming red cheeks, made him look…cute.
“Did I like it? I fucking loved it,” Harry grinned and drew him into a kiss. Draco squeaked, but melted into the kiss anyway.
“Oh.” There was an odd quality to Malfoy’s voice now, and Harry tried not to notice. “Have you…forgive me for asking, but have you read books before?”
“Any?” Draco opened all the bags. “Anything you’re particularly in the mood for?”
“Of course.”
“I can hear you thinking,” Draco mumbled from inside the pillow. He barely stirred. “Go back to sleep.”
“You don’t think that’s physical?” Malfoy asked. “They did have to connect some wires in a way that scanned as incredibly physical to me. Slotting plugs into sockets.” The way he pronounced the technical terms was very careful and precise, as if he’d practiced enunciating the unfamiliar words out loud multiple times.
This wasn’t. And that was the weird thing: even if Harry knew that what he’d been put through wasn’t right, it’d been easy to brush off when it was Hermione saying it. She was always finding something wrong with the world, something to fix, something to feel sympathetic about. Malfoy saying it…Harry had once considered him a nemesis. They’d hurt each other, tried to kill each other—for Malfoy to say it, it was making it all real in a different way.
“Don’t be dim. That boy will be back at five to pick you up. Walk you home or sweep you off your feet. Probably both.”
Stories about pirates, maybe? Or dragons and damsels in distress? Muggles liked to read about magic and dragons and villain-defying heroes, Harry knew, but he’d lived through what would probably be several books’ worth of magic and dragons and defeating villains, so he, at least, did not want to read about that sort of thing. Maybe Malfoy didn’t either.
He’d read it soon. Maybe as soon as he finished the robots one. Or maybe he’d put the robot book aside for now and just dive headfirst into this one. Or maybe he’d just put it in his bookshelf where he could look at it and where it would wait for him until he was ready to read it.
“People.” Harry summoned the hot sauce packets levitating just inside the boundaries of the umbrella, and emptied two of them onto his plate. “War. And…” Well, there was the way the robots in the book had formed relationships, that had struck a deep, raw chord with him. “I thought it was interesting that…for the robots sex wasn’t a physical act, it was about fusing minds. Like, sharing information—allowing complete and unfettered access to everything inside their heads.”
“We—”
but she took off through the open window.
“I don’t know. I hadn’t really thought about it before I asked.”
“I don’t know. I’m still figuring it out.” Harry exhaled. “I have…weird hang-ups about sex. I don’t want—I don’t know. Is that okay? Is that a problem? Because I don’t want it to be—”
Draco looked at it, his eyes skimming the pages. Harry could see the moment understanding dawned; Draco’s eyes widened and the hand that was still on Harry’s face stilled. "This is how you feel?" he asked. Harry nodded. “I think I understand,” Draco said slowly. “And we can figure it out, but there’s no rush, is there? Just breathe. Take your time. Go to fifty therapy sessions if that’s what you need. I’ll be right here, and when you’re ready to try again, if you’ll be ready, we can try. But until then…” Draco bit his lip. “Well, there’s this curry I cooked.”
Harry threw himself into work. When he wasn’t teaching five-year-olds basic flying and Quaffle handling (they were not ready for Bludgers yet), or at the Archive alternating between fetching patrons documents and cataloguing the odd little collection, he was working tirelessly on putting together a Little League team.
“He likes those, does he?”
“Rhosyn Jones,” the woman said, shaking Harry’s hand. “Ginny’s teammate.”
Before either Harry or Draco got a chance to reply (Harry was slightly bewildered by the fact the lesbians all seemed to know each other—though he did remember Cornelia, she and Pansy had been together a ways back and Harry had met her at pub night a few times), the impromptu single-or-not-update thing going on got interrupted by the arrival of three tall and rowdy people.
The kids nodded and trotted outside quietly. Avery went for a swing seat, but Charlie and Alice took the Quaffle over to the seesaw and started throwing it to each other.
Draco turned a smug smile on her. “Fear not, I have a plan.”
“Oh. I’d love one. Do you mean like…” Her eyes drifted to Harry’s badge and then Draco’s. “Mmh. Master Strategist, I think.”
With this seemingly age-old argument playing out, Harry could afford Draco some attention. “Are you okay?” he asked in a low voice.
“The offer still stands if you want to come,” Harry said, stepping aside to let him in.
“Let’s just go back inside.”
—for Cedric,” Harry snapped. “It was bloody complicated. And it didn’t matter anyway. He died.”
“Are you, like, all right?” Pansy asked. “Not that I care, you understand. I’m just…fascinated.”
, and their life had to go on. He could just…keep teaching little ones all about flying and Quidditch and finger-painting and how to be friends and what respect was and everything.
“I don’t know,” Harry answered, truthfully. “I don’t have a girlfriend anymore and I don’t have any siblings either,” he told her. The words slipped out easily and with little to no pain.
“I know that look,” Ginny said. “Stay for the game, at least?”
“I need fresh air,” Draco said, abruptly, and extricated himself from Harry and the table. “Come with me, please.”
He hated that he’d had to sleep in a cupboard, that he’d had to face a basilisk alone, that he’d had to walk to his own death to save everyone else, and he hated that he hadn’t
He walked out of the store with Ginny’s favourite, a pink thing with jasmine and rose, as well as a cheerfully yellow and citrusy one he liked to use on the rare mornings he started with a bath instead of a shower.
“And how do you feel about that?”
The last time he’d seen her, really seen her, he’d been pretending to be dead and she’d been lying to Voldemort. Next time he’d see her it might be in a nice sitting room over tea.
“Uhm.” Harry didn’t know where to start. Gladys had had to ask him probing questions to get him to talk—to articulate his feelings. “Standard stuff,” he said, eventually. “Like—beat me, terrorise me at school, all kinds of…that. My aunt and uncle were the worst, though. They—they used to lock me up. It used to be, my Uncle would punish me for breathing, and I wouldn’t get dinner, or—” Harry cut himself off, acutely aware that Draco’s grip on his hand had become painfully tight. “That kind of thing,” he finished, lamely.
Not that Harry was lying in wait for Malfoy (he wasn’t), but he’d got started on that wizarding classic Malfoy had lent him, and now had a burning need to talk about it.
Ron and Hermione were both giving him speculative looks, Harry realised, and he decided to change the topic. “How is Project Baby coming along?”
“I didn’t
Guilt rose up in Harry along with the tears, but so did all his complicated anger and hurt that he’d come to realise was woven around Ginny in this fine, invisible cloud. And yet…if she was so determined to talk, Harry would fucking talk. “All right,” he said, snappish and grumpy and heartsick, and petty enough to want to push that pain outwards. “But I want it known for the record that I did
“Okay,” he said, and followed Ginny into the bedroom.
“I always mean it.”
“It’s an essential part of my personality, Potter.” Malfoy grinned back. “If you want to be friends with me, you’ve got to live with it.”
There. The words were out. It was made real.
“That’s rich coming from someone who couldn’t get out of bed for six months,” Harry snapped, and instantly regretted it.
There was also the fact that he wouldn’t actually be able to get a full team, even if he somehow had kids lined up to join; he ran a Quidditch-themed part-time daycare, not a sports team or a Quidditch class. As a registered childminder he could only be responsible for the care of up to five children. If he wanted to enter the daycare into the league, he’d have to sort out what could only be a terrifying load of paperwork, and then find two more players. Maybe even extras, to rotate… it wasn’t impossible, but it was a change, and a challenge, and Harry had been walking in the same groove for a long time now.
“Just because I went to prison it doesn’t mean the scales are even—”
And then, without anyone noticing, Alice caught the Snitch.
Lee whooped. “Get me all the exclusives, yeah?”
“There’s food, it’s a date,” he pointed out. “Let’s go.” He started pulling Draco towards the exit. “I’m dying to see the place. Do you have any idea how long I’ve been waiting? Six bloody weeks!”
“Come here,” he said to Hugh and Betty, setting the kit down on one of the kid-sized tables in the middle of the room. His voice came out too brusque, and Harry bit his tongue.
“You don’t have to answer,” Harry said. “I was just…”
To his astonishment, they both flushed bright red, but instead of it being some kind of awkward embarrassment, it appeared to be a symptom of acute delight and pride.
“Sort of. They’re shaped like balls and when you drop in the water they fizz, so I guess that’s why they call them bombs? They don’t explode, but they move around and all. It’s fun to watch. And they smell great and make your skin all soft and they have different colours and sometimes glitter.”
“Kind of.” Harry had five little players, if one could call them players. That seemed a mite generous. And it wasn’t a team, it was a daycare. “I don’t have a full team.”
“Mr Potter? If you’re ready?” His therapist, Harry presumed, had appeared in the doorway.
“Then she would’ve been lying about her best friend’s death,” Harry said, after two bites of curry-soaked bread. “Which means that she killed him.”
my ugly parts?”
At the other table, Draco was looking at Harry over the top of the book, a concerned expression on his face. The book was upside down—the realisation that Draco was keeping tabs should’ve freaked him out, but all Harry felt was relief and a peculiar ache in his chest. He shook his head minutely, trying to convey that he was fine (he wasn’t, he so very wasn’t, but he couldn’t move, he couldn’t speak, and definitely could not handle any kind of…care, from Draco, right now) and Draco frowned, but went back to pretending to read the book.
Draco sipped his tea. Harry pressed a kiss into his hair. “We like our straight friends,” he said. “But sometimes it’s nice to just…”
Harry stared. Was that a joke? Was Malfoy trying to joke with him? “Well, let me know when you’ve figured it out,” he said. “Can’t have people just disappear on me, you know, I need to check people out of the reading hall properly.”
Malfoy worried his lip. “I’m writing a book,” he eventually said.
It wasn’t used much, as it looked to Muggles like a narrow passage between two large buildings barely large enough for a cat to pass through, and to wizardfolk felt a little like rubbing shoulders with an electrical outlet. Most preferred to enter and exit the district through the Leaky Cauldron.
Saving the questions for later and changing the subject, Harry asked, “Do you want to come to the pub tomorrow?”
“That’s when you disappeared,” Harry said. Part of him was horrified, that a person could just stop like that, that it could happen to someone so normal as Draco—but he’d seen the effects of war and trauma first-hand during his community service. For it to happen after a death of a parent didn’t seem so outlandish after all. “Pansy stopped talking about what you’d been up to, and you didn’t show at any…well, anywhere.”
“This is a charity series, not the First Division,” Oliver interjected. “Our main objective is fundraising. Disqualifying teams for arbitrary reasons such as non-compliance with the standard Quidditch Regulations is in direct conflict with that goal.”
“It doesn’t like me,” Charlie said, eyes flickering towards the broom.
Harry glanced at his feet. The hem of his cloak was muddy, as were his shoes. “I did just get off a broom,” Harry told him. “It’s my other job, remember.”
“And you? How are you dealing?” Hermione asked.
Satisfied with this resolve, Harry tidied up.
The surprises just kept coming. “
Peony chuckled. “Yeah. Thank you. Hey, I’m glad you called. I’ve been meaning to talk to you, but I didn’t know how to find you.”
“It’s…” Harry shrugged. “I don’t really know. It’s relaxing, I guess.” They were walking close enough together that Harry could touch his elbow to Malfoy’s, so he did. “I bet you have some kind of reading room to read in, with a nice chair and all.”
Padma rolled her eyes. “Pansy is moving in with me, so thank you for the offer, but…” She shrugged.
, and possibilities, and a place to start.
“Yeah, well.”
Their friends could make whatever assumptions about his and Ginny’s conspicuous absence that they wanted.
“All right,” she said, eventually. She stood up. “I’ll…just grab some of my stuff and come back for the rest later.”
When Harry finally stepped out of the shower, his fingers were prune-y and his skin scalded, and the bedroom smelled like sex. The bed was a mess, a familiar site of destruction, and Harry—Harry suddenly had
“You’re having me on.”
Unpacking went slowly. Between Ginny’s long days with Quidditch practice and Harry’s two jobs, neither of them wanted to spend all their free time dealing with finding new places for everything. Boxes stayed piled up in the living room, and two weeks later were still largely untouched. Harry never uncovered his books and rather feared they’d ended up in the charity shop pile somewhere along the way.
“You’re saying Ginny was a…” Harry couldn’t bring himself to say it. He’d loved her. He still loved her. And he knew she loved him. She wasn’t like the Dursleys, and he hated even thinking the thought that she could be. “She didn’t
novel,” he whispered, as if imparting some great, wondrous secret, “about Muggles in space. It’s very exciting.”
“But if she wasn’t lying?” Harry asked. He couldn’t take his eyes off Draco, who rarely looked as animated as when talking about books. His whole face came alive: lips quirking, eyebrows moving, eyes twinkling. There was a line in his cheek that deepened every time he did the ‘or maybe’ face.
Betty made a victory loop around the other kids, whooping and cheering, and then released the Snitch. Alice went after it right away.
“Don’t make fun of me, Potter. I couldn’t handle it if you did.”
Technically he wasn’t late at all, as he wasn’t required to show up to the archive at a set time to use his study, and he’d never indicated a set schedule to Harry either, but he usually showed up at one o’clock or just a few minutes past, and it was ten whole minutes past one.
“I’d like for you to take the rest of the evening off,” she said, before she sent him out the door. “You’re overwhelmed, and you need to process.”
“Yes, murder boy. Is he here?”
“Well done, Betty!” Harry yelled back. “Now release it and try again!”
“Okay. Then. I’m going.” Ginny headed for the door.
Ginny just nodded and waved them off, so Harry went to the changing rooms. His own robes were less flashy than Draco’s, being simply cut and black (though the fabric felt much more luxurious than what he usually wore), but the tailor had wanted to put him in a short robe with tightly fitted trousers instead of the more common long robes, muttering something about the shape of his legs that Draco had very vocally agreed with. Draco had also, upon learning that Harry didn’t own a single pair of boots, splurged on a pair to go with the outfit. These new boots were nearly knee height, shiny black with silver fastenings, and matched his new (also short) cloak, which had a single silver clasp holding it closed in front.
“Hi,” Ginny said, eyeing Draco warily, but she extended her hand.
“Oh!” Charlie grinned. “It came!”
“Well,” Ginny said eventually, slowly, seemingly talking around a throat issue of her own. “I won’t pretend it doesn’t hurt that you’re more broken up about this than you were when
The vacant, dead look in Malfoy’s eyes was slightly unnerving, so Harry cleared his throat. Malfoy’s eyes brightened and he turned his attention to Harry, though his face remained expressionless. “Here’s the documents you requested. We close at five. No beverages or any other liquids are allowed in here. Don’t write on the documents. Any questions?”
“And then
“Only to my hand!” Charlie declared, with somewhat more confidence than Harry was expecting.
“No, not really. He just lent me some books.” Harry shrugged, like it was nothing, but he felt like he was lying. “I have a Little League team,” he said, changing the topic. “I sent in the formal registration. We’re having our first training session tomorrow afternoon. More like, I’ll get the team together and we’ll all get to know each other, but there will be brooms involved.”
She shrunk the trunks and walked off, and Harry finally, finally, could go back to Draco.
“I’m going to see Andrew Crocker play!” Charlie said. “He’s my favourite. Who’s yours?”
“Okay,” Harry said, to no one in particular. He leaned back in the chair. Nobody was in the Archive but him—correction: nobody was in the public areas of the Archive; the archivists were at work in their offices and work rooms and down in the strongrooms, cataloguing collections or conserving documents or whatever it was that real archivists did, and that Harry didn’t.
therapist thought it would be a good idea to…confront my past, to put it that way. Because, uh, I haven’t told you this, but well, my relatives that I grew up with were, ah, they didn’t treat me very well,” Harry said, floundering a lot more than he’d done in Gladys’ office. “And so tomorrow I’m meeting my cousin.”
He answered questions about his team (
Malfoy worried his lip, staring at the cards. He eventually picked the one with all the hearts. “Taking this…which signal does that give you?”
“I know which way the College is,” Malfoy said, quick grin on his face. He fell into step with Harry, and a few seconds later, his hand was in Harry’s. “Is this okay?”
“We’ve a staff meeting on Monday before you come in and we need to rearrange some things,” she said, showing him a neatly filled out form. “Your murder boy friend sent this in last night. It’s a request for two things, a private research room and a designated research assistant, and it says here,” she indicated a rubric near the bottom, “that he wants you.”
“What’d you do with the properties when you were done? I heard you sold them.”
“No, I’m not saying
“I don’t follow,” Harry said. “What do you mean the properties were dead?”
“Oh! Good! Do you want to—” Harry realised he had no idea what he wanted to do. He couldn’t see—or think—past the next few minutes. “Be with me?”
“But Muggles don’t…I mean, they can’t interact with magic, can they?”
“Can I take it back?” Draco asked, looking alarmed.
“Do you mean…what do you mean? Like a date?” Malfoy was definitely flustered, cheeks pink and eyes wild.
Harry had taken Draco to a Muggle bookstore on the weekend, where they’d each got a copy of the same book to read—carefully selected, after perusing the Young Adult section for hours, and on recommendation by the store clerk who’d been restocking shelves nearby. After, Draco had cooked him dinner. At Harry’s place, mind, as it’d been within walking distance, and Draco had made a funny face when Harry had asked him where he lived.
“Hmm.” Harry nudged the broom with his foot. The problem was obviously not the lisp. “I think it’s frightened. It’s playing dead, see?” He nudged the broom again.
It was easier to let the tears come under the warm spray of water, where he could pretend he wasn’t crying at all and where it felt like all his ugly mistakes washed away.
“I want you to consider that repeatedly having sex when you didn’t want to was a traumatic experience, and you have been re-traumatising yourself every time you engaged in that kind of activity,” she said. “You’re conflating sex with a task to overcome instead of a bonding experience—you talk about it in the same terms you’ve used to talk about your childhood trauma and war experiences.”
“Sickle for your thoughts,” Draco said, coming up from behind and surprising Harry. They joined the line at the café.
Harry put the course pamphlet, which he’d been using as a bookmark, between the pages of the book he was reading, and closed it. He’d started with the science fiction novel. “Hi,” he said.
“Not at all.” Dean clicked his glass to Harry’s. “Everything all right? You look harried, if you’ll pardon the pun.”
“Okay.” Malfoy still looked wary.
“These are Alice’s,” Ginny said, throwing over a pair of gloves.
Harry managed to suppress the sobs in his chest for long enough to get out of bed, slowly and unsteadily as if the entire world was rocking under his feet, and went to take a shower.
The week went by quickly. Between Little League practice, starting the Archive Studies course at the College, and the readings that came with the course, Harry had little time to himself. He’d cracked open one of the new books Malfoy had lent him—a Muggle science fiction novel with robots on the cover—but hadn’t made much headway with it. He did chat with Malfoy at the archive when he could find a spare minute; with the spring semester starting up at the College, the Archive was seeing an increase in patrons and Harry couldn’t skive off work to chat with Malfoy as often as he liked.
“Oh.” Ron chewed. “Does it work?”
“That’s not true,” Harry said, taking a step away. He was acutely aware of how loud Ginny was, and that there were people outside and some still in the changing rooms, and this really wasn’t the place to have this fight, or any fight at all. “It’s not
“I just mean,” he continued, looking at the drinks on the table, “that I want him to know it’s okay.”
“All right,” Wyncall said. “I’d have offered, otherwise.”
Sometimes when he read a funny passage, he’d read it out to Harry, but most of the time he’d say
“Yes,” Draco agreed. “I think that’s what it comes down to, really: either you believe she was capable of killing her best friend, and thus also betrayed her country and successfully lied about both, or you believe that she couldn’t save her best friend, and that she was framed for the whole thing by her former lover and as such, is innocent.”
“I finished the book,” Harry said, fetching Draco from his study for their usual Friday Lunch. “I brought them all, so you can take them back home.”
“Okay,” Harry agreed. He stood up and stepped back, to give Charlie space. “You can try now.”
?” Before Harry could respond, Malfoy had crossed the room and was studying a blue, rocket-shaped bath bomb. “It is!”
Malfoy sniffed the bath bomb, then looked at the label again. “That’s remarkable. None of these ingredients have magical properties, but what you’re describing sounds very similar to the effects of the Calming Draught.”
“Yes. Have you seen Draco?” Harry was getting impatient. “He, uh, was supposed to come meet me here.”
Harry had packed them off with their parents pretty quickly and set about collecting and packing up the equipment with Ginny. She hadn’t said much during the game that wasn’t Quidditch related, and the work went by quietly and amicably.
“Oi, girl,” Harry said to her. “Stick to the rules, yeah?” He signalled for Jamie to take Love’s place.
“Yeah,” Draco said. “I think I failed at the socialising with someone I don’t know part, because that…well, that ended up being you.”
The tree was easily dealt with: a swish with a wand put the fire out, and a flick produced a stream of water to drench the smouldering remains, just in case there were still live embers in the tree. The brooms—well, the brooms could wait. Addressing the crying and the cause of the crying (and the cause of the fire and the unresponsive brooms) was next.
“Chaser!”
“You talked to my
“I’d love to, but I have homework.” And a book about robots to get back to…though the temptation to stay and watch the Harpies throttle the Magpies was strong. “It should be a short game, right?”
“What did you want to ask?” Harry prodded.
“I think so,” Harry said. “I don’t know.”
want to have sex with them was so entirely foreign to Harry that he didn’t know what to think or say. Ginny had wanted him all the time, or so it had felt; it hadn’t happened very often that she turned him down. Possibly because he hadn’t asked very often to begin with. It was usually when they’d been fighting that she didn’t want to, which had made a lot of sense to Harry. He’d never wanted to either, and especially not then.
“Dean and Seamus said they’d be there, Blaise said he’d come, but didn’t say if he’d bring Gilliam, Pansy and Padma will be there, though possibly not until nine, George said he and Lee would be there, Angelina too if they could find a sitter, Percy and Oliver said they’d try to make it, but Oliver is refereeing a Little League tomorrow and then playing for Puddlemere after that, so it might just be Percy.” Harry frowned, counting on his fingers. “I think that’s everyone.”
“What?” Harry completely forgot what he was saying. Stop? How? By just saying it?
stayed with
Harry huffed.
“She just—she just grabbed it—”
Ginny wasn’t there. There was actually no sign she’d come home at all; her bag wasn’t there, and her shoes weren’t in the hall. Harry called out anyway, but got no response. She’d gone…home. Home.
“Perce, you and Oliver coming to the pub with us?” Ron was asking, leaning over Harry.
“I only meant that I want to do the dishes first,” Draco clarified, smiling wryly. “It’s going to bother me if we just leave them, so can we do the dishes first and
He didn’t have to wait long.
Harry took Draco’s hand again. “Hang on tight,” he said, taking a deep breath. A swish and a pop and they materialised in a narrow laneway, scaring a cat and two pigeons. “You okay?”
“So you will quit your studies and your job at the Archive,” Draco said, when Harry had momentarily stopped talking to shovel in the last bites of his dinner. Draco had finished his own a long time ago, by virtue of having been eating while Harry had been talking his mouth off.
“Mr Harry!”
Turning, Harry saw that Draco was standing alone near the exit. Of course. Draco. Harry’s belly flipped. “You don’t want to say hi?” he asked her.
“It was bonkers. Was it supposed to be an analogy for some kind of…class segregation? I mean, this Edwarde tosser did all this shit and never saw any consequences, but his mate lost everything he had, and…Edwarde wasn’t kind to him either.”
“Let’s get out of the kitchen.” Harry slipped the outer robe off completely and draped it over his arm, knowing that if he dropped it here it would also bother Draco. “Bed?”
“You,” Harry answered, looking at Draco. “I wanted to know more about PTSD and all that, so maybe I could understand it better. I was curious, too—I wanted to know more about what it’s like for you.”
“Geoffrey just got handed a massive collection, an entire estate’s worth, down in Kent, so he’ll be doing that for the foreseeable future,” she said. “It’s months of work, and he’s taking two trainees with him. We need somebody to cover the private research. That’s your murder boy friend here, and three other rooms. I can get Annie to cover the mornings and Tuesdays, but we need the extra help.”
“Yes, damn it. I didn’t suffer for most of my life only to continue to suffer. I don’t care about what I deserve or don’t deserve, I care about what I want. Right now, that’s you, us.”
showed up for pra—what’s wrong?”
“You look good,” Harry said. “Let’s go in?”
“Yeah,” he replied. “Pretty much.”
Harry knelt by the broom, running his hand alongside the shaft. The broom was very much alive; he could feel the low thrum of magic when he focused on it. It was only playing dead. These brooms typically weren’t temperamental, and generally not prone to hysterics just because small children happened to say things around them; it was more likely that it was picking up on something in Charlie that he hadn’t communicated out loud.
“No, it isn’t! Merlin’s bloody hat, Draco,
“All day tomorrow,” Harry replied. “We close early on Fridays.”
“What about the book?” Harry kept stroking his fingers over Draco’s skin. His shoulder had a tiny birthmark on it.
Harry turned around, left Diagon Alley, and headed instead for his favourite Muggle shop. He wasn’t running low on bath bombs exactly, but there were none left of the kind Ginny liked. She was a shower person, but sometimes Harry could persuade her to join him for a soak.
Harry was late. He was so late he was running through the Ministry to Hermione’s office because he was late—not just
“No, but you can stop!” Draco interrupted, voice rising. “You can say stop any time!”
, but Harry actually just wanted to scream.
Harry looked up, at the plain wooden boards, grey with age, that made the ceiling above their heads. Some light filtered in between the boards, which meant there must be a window or two up there somewhere. There was a narrow rickety ladder going up through a hole in the ceiling, and Harry really wanted to climb it to see what it looked like up there.
Harry finished up his duties and returned Malfoy’s morbid documents to the strongrooms. He locked the front doors as he left, heading towards the cross where Diagon Alley and Direction Alley met—Flourish and Blotts was still open, and this time Harry wanted to actually go in, pick a book, pay for it, and bring it home.
Malfoy was late.
“No.” Harry drew in a breath. “This was a long time coming,” he admitted. “Ginny’s already met someone else, and…” He tried for a casual shrug. “It’s probably a good thing.”
The stadium erupted, Lee’s voice nearly drowning in the cacophony.
“And if we lose?”
That had Draco laughing, which Harry took as a yes and reeled him in. “Okay,” Draco said, smiling and kissing Harry back. “What’s next?”
“Pansy,” Draco answered, looking terrified.
And then the worry had set in. Worry that they’d lose the next game since training had gone so spectacularly badly, worry that Harry would never figure out how to break his bad patterns, worry that Draco would get tired of him, worry that he would never be able to look at Ginny again without thinking about how they’d mistreated each other, worry that he’d never have a family of his own, worry that he was a crap Quidditch captain, worry that he would fail his Archive Studies, worry that the maple tree would never heal, worry that Alice would grow to be scared of her own magic, worry that he would never be good enough for Draco, worry that everything would soon be ending, just stopping, ceasing to be, without him being able to do a single thing about it.
“Did you…want a recommendation?” Malfoy asked, looking at Harry at last.
“Well, Harry, you have been avoiding us lately,” Hermione said and picked up her own food. “I thought we’d have to drag it out of you.”
Harry wasn’t entirely sure he should believe him.
“Uhm, not much? They’re slaves to wizards and giving them clothes sets them free?” Harry thought about the decapitated house elves in Grimmauld Place, and Kreacher, and Dobby, and Winky. The Hogwarts elves. “They’re loyal to their masters…and stay with the family? And only the rich wizards have them?”
“Yeah. A bit.”
Harry froze. There were a lot of things he’d wanted when he was five, but none of them were professions. Alive, his brain helpfully supplied. Anywhere but here. With my parents. “A dentist,” he finally said, latching onto the first Muggle profession he could think of. “Though Little League Quidditch captain is working well for me.”
“Oh.”
Alice, Avery, and Charlie were great kids, and they’d do well in school. Harry was sure of it.
They agreed on a time and place, and Peony took down Harry’s address. “Looking forward to it, Harry,” she said, and Harry awkwardly stammered a reply and hung up.
Not really. Malfoy must’ve seen that uncertainty on Harry’s face because suddenly he smiled like he’d seen something really funny.
. Or maybe—maybe he could move in with Draco, if that was what Draco wanted?
“Mate, you’ve been spacey since you walked in,” Ron said, kicking Harry’s chair.
“The others went ahead to the pub,” Harry said, when she was done, and kissed her again. “We’re going to celebrate your win.”
“Can I ask you a personal question?”
The reporter wasn’t done. “What did
He cried until he fell asleep, and when he woke up it was because he was dehydrated, hungry, and there was an awful racket outside the front door.
“Yes. Yes!” Harry was. He wasn’t being very good at it right now, but he did see that they needed to go over the formation again. “Let’s pause and show them again?”
It was odd, feeling hungry. He hadn’t felt hungry like this in years. Not since the Horcrux hunt, or the summers at Privet Drive…Harry’s stomach turned and gurgled, and the hunger abated bit by bit.
Harry lingered for just a moment, soaking in Draco’s joy, and then strode over to the kids and Ginny. He tried to channel confidence and positive spirit, or whatever would get his team to believe that today would be a great day. “Who’s ready to win this game?” he yelled.
“About two or three per week,” Harry replied. “Depends. Sometimes less, sometimes more. This week none so far because I haven’t had the time.”
And that it was hard, and necessary, and Harry…well, he wanted to be good for Draco. And maybe,
“Emergency of some sort or other, I don’t know.” Ron shrugged. “She’ll be back, or she won’t. What’s up?”
“Hello,” Harry said.
“I don’t know. I never thought I had to.” And yet…there were a lot of things that Harry couldn’t honestly say he’d really dealt with or faced. Or acknowledged. Maybe, if he’d been less of a coward, if he’d…talked to somebody, his and Ginny’s relationship wouldn’t have turned into the farce it’d been, and maybe they’d still have been together. Maybe he could’ve fixed things—himself—before they became unfixable.
, it went on. Harry’s hands were shaking, and the pamphlet with it.
“Anything else?” Ginny loosened the towel, letting half of it fall away to reveal a pert breast and a pink nipple. Her eyes sought Harry’s, and then she let the other end of the towel fall.
“Depends,” Harry said, touching the brim of his hat. “Is it working?”
“What truth is that?” Harry liked this Malfoy—the one that talked with him about things like this. He hadn’t known him for long, but he desperately wanted to keep him, so he allowed the hope to grow bolder. He could use some.
“Who?” Albert frowned. “Oh, murder boy?”
“Yeah.” She stood up, then held a hand out to him.
!” he burst out. “I read about it in class. Some Muggles believe that scents can have therapeutic effects. You said this helps you sleep?”
“Yeah, yeah, I was just…I have so much to do. All this stuff, my evening courses—I started the Archive Course, which, well, you wouldn’t know about because I only just started it…I’m sorry we haven’t talked.” He squeezed her hand, then started walking her back to Rhosyn. “I’ve missed you.”
“Right. Well, as you can see,” she gestured at herself, “I’m transgender. I realised fairly early on, but I also realised that if I let it fly, my parents would turn on me the same they turned on you, and I didn’t want that to happen. And I didn’t want them to find out or raise suspicion, so…I took part in their abuse, of you.”
Malfoy huffed. “Trust that you’re on a first name basis with the kitchen staff.”
But it wasn’t about him, it was just a book, a fiction. Teenagers waging a war that their parents were unequipped to deal with, suffering heavy losses to take down corruption and injustice and coming out the other side victorious.
Harry didn’t go to the pub, though he did chat with Ron and Percy briefly after the game. Percy was impressed by Harry’s decision to go back to school and Ron thought it was brilliant. Once homework was over with, Harry spent the rest of the weekend reading about robots, only surfacing for food and a peek at the Little League reportage, which Ginny brought with her when she came to pick up her things.
“Right,” Harry said, looking between them. On one level he was genuinely relieved that he and Ginny no longer had to…keep doing what they were doing, but on another there was residual grief and hurt and some feelings he didn’t know how to name. What he did know was that he needed to free himself from Ginny for good. “Right. Er. Gin, can I talk to you for a second?” No time like the present.
The owl gave him such a deprecating look that Harry snarked back. “I don’t care what hour it is.” Deciding on writing Draco anyway, he tore a page from his notebook.
Ginny stared at him. “You know, that may actually have been the first honest thing you've said to me in a long time,” she said. “Talk to me? I'm a big girl—whatever it is, I'm sure I can handle it.”
“But it’ll fix you?”
He was surprised to see that despite the disastrous training session, the formations they’d practised (attempted to practise) were working beautifully. Dorcas, Denise and Avery, on Chaser rotas, were moving together in a beautiful uniformity Harry would not have believed five and six year olds capable of, torpedoing through the opposite defence and scoring another goal. Behind them Love and Jamie were attacking Bludgers with a terrifying ferocity—one Bludger whizzed past Faulkner’s head, ruffling his curls in the process. He was so startled he nearly fell off his broom and forgot to give out any kind of penalties.
It was quite possible that Harry was falling even deeper, if such a thing was possible. He resisted sneaking a kiss and instead summoned their plates, which bobbed over happily, and put a refreshment charm on them. Soon enough their food was hot and inviting again.
(e.g. get an erection -> sustain the erection -> please the partner -> ejaculate, with no space for the male partner to not climax at all (the male partner not climaxing being seen as a slight on the female partner), and on it goes.) as well as build
“I—I can’t promise anything,” Draco whispered back. But little by little his shoulders loosened up.
Harry’s heart sank. This wasn’t new information, not by far—and he’d known her long enough to know that. It’d just…never disappointed him before.
Draco shook his head, smiling. “No. I don’t know, actually. I thought about naming it
“Are you aware that your team might be disqualified if you do not comply with—”
Malfoy froze, two short paces from the service desk. Then he seemed to realise what Harry was talking about, because his shoulders loosened and he offered Harry a smile. “I imagine that was a deliberate choice on the author’s part,” he said. “Are you not enjoying the book, then?”
Harry exchanged a few pleasantries with them—apparently Roxanne had made the walls sing just the other day—and then headed out of the stadium. The journalists had mostly left, though a few were conversing with the celebrity coaches and the stands were filling up more as the game would soon be underway.
Ginny was shaking out her hair and Harry’s attention snapped to her. She was drying her hair with magic, and soon it fell about her face in a soft cloud.
Narcissa levelled a cool look at him. “That depends. What do you want him for?”
“No.” Harry frowned. “We don’t even live together.”
Harry checked the ledger. “Most recent reports on file are from 1899.”
“Exactly.”
“I think your ideas are great. I’ll support you, whatever you choose to do,” Draco said. “I think this…it suits you. It’s very heroic.”
He kept talking all through dinner, only pausing occasionally to appreciate how fantastic the food was; mouth-melting and intensely flavoured and so, so good. Draco’s cheeks acquired these lovely pink spots of delight every time Harry praised his cooking, which only made him want to do it more.
“Yeah, that’s what the rooms are for. The shelves will remember for you. If you come back tomorrow—”
“I was still in denial at the time,” Dean said. “Still went with Seamus, though.”
Draco’s cheeks were colouring rapidly, following this passionate explanation. Harry turned the book over, considering it. He’d have preferred if the couple in the book had just continued onwards and onwards with their relationship without this ‘Black Moment’, that they had just been happy without all that trouble. That wasn’t wrong, was it? “Couldn’t they have been happy anyway?” he asked.
“I wasn’t asking about that,” Draco said. “I—nevermind.”
“Oh.” Harry didn’t know what to say. “Er. That’s a nice name?”
Was it too much? Not enough? Harry frowned, Hilde hooted, and before he lost his nerve he folded it up and tied it to her leg. “Make sure he gets it,” he told her. “It’s okay if there’s no reply, don’t hassle him for one. Just make sure he reads this one, okay?”
“What’re you going to name your book?
There was a course starting up the week after next, and it was an evening course. There was a full time and part time option, a manageable enrolment fee, and Harry surprised himself with how interested he was. There was a course module called Record-keeping Theory and Practice, and another called Medieval Palaeography, and another called Managing Services, Access and Preservation. All in all, there were about twelve modules, six core modules, the rest optional, to be taken over the course of two years if part time. He pocketed the pamphlet and went back to the desk, deep in thought.
Harry paused his eating. “Ruined it? But…it was a happy ending. They won. Did you want them to lose?”
He still had seven minutes until his appointment.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Sure, George. Owl me?”
“Yeah.”
“I’m a bleedin’ dyke, Draco,” Millicent said, and Draco coughed.
“What? Oh. A book, I think,” Harry answered, semi-distracted. “WELL DONE, AVERY!” he yelled, just as Lee was announcing the score. Ten minutes into the game and the Butterfly Bumpkins were ahead thirty points to ten.
And then, before Harry could react—he was certain Malfoy had never said as many words to him before as just now—Malfoy’s face drew together into a more blank mask, and he fidgeted with his notebook instead of looking at Harry.
didn’t seem to cut it.
“Robots.”
Malfoy slowed down. “Something about getting you some books. You said you wanted some of your own the other day, and I thought…” He gave a little half shrug. “It’s a terrible excuse.”
“Mmhmmmaybe.” Draco, as usual, set all the plates to levitate smoothly ahead of them as they made their way to the garden. “The part about dying, at least. I’m not sure what to do about the rest. I don’t suppose you have birth records?”
“It’s not that,” Harry said. “It’s not you. It’s just…I have a date.”
“Hi,” Draco said back, shaking her hand. “Lovely to properly meet you,” he added.
Harry just grinned at him. “Yes, okay. It’s brilliant. No need to be smug about it.”
Seamus raised his own pint in greeting. “Did you start early? The metaphors don’t usually come out until much later,” he said.
“Come to the pub with me,” Harry said. “Please.”
“Uhm, okay, uh, what about—when did you want to do this?” Malfoy’s eyes were getting wilder—or was that panic?—by the moment.
“Are you coming back?” The words tumbled out before Harry could stop them, and he hated how desperate they sounded, how desperate he sounded, but he didn’t want Draco to go. He wanted to apologise, he wanted Draco to stay, he wanted a do-over.
“I met someone,” Ginny then said. “It’s a girl, if you’ll believe it. I don’t know if I like her because I’m not as straight as I thought I was, or if it’s because she looks at me like—like I’m the hottest woman in the entire world, but she makes me feel wanted. And I want that. I
“My friend?” Harry put the stopper in the ink bottle; he’d finished the letters anyway.
Hugh was frowning. “What’s burnt caramel smell like?”
“I’m afraid everything has been mixed up,” Draco said, standing in the middle of the room. “I did use that Charm you showed me, but I think my thoughts were all jumbled, so…”
It was altogether too much. Harry got up. He left the change in a donation box near the exit and headed for the tube. If he was lucky, Draco would already be at home waiting for him. Harry wanted nothing more than to kiss him, then sit down in the kitchen to watch him cook, kiss him again, and skip class tonight. Record-keeping Theory and Practice could wait.
“Oh.” Yeah, Harry knew. “I’m getting the book.”
Malfoy seemed to realise this also, because he took a step backwards, cheeks pinking again, and turned towards the front desk. Harry rushed in, catching up with him and giving Albert a frazzled greeting as he slid around Malfoy and to his spot behind the desk.
The treatment options given in the (fictional article) Harry read are all real treatment options I cobbled together from various sources. In addition to the sources linked here, I read some in Danish that suggest a treatment option to be literally “be in a relationship where it is safe to turn down sex” as "participating in sex when 'not in the mood' can have disastrous results". In more detailed words, this meant
“I need—” Draco stopped, collecting his outer robe. He didn’t put it on. “I need some space.”
“Harry,” Hermione started, as soon as the waiter was gone. “Is—”
“Well—yeah.” Harry found the paper bag discarded by the door and fished the book out.
Harry was staring. “What are you doing?” he whispered. “You can’t break the Statute of Secrecy!”
They said their goodbyes and Harry went to find Ginny.
“Darlings!” Pansy greeted them, flashing her ring. “And Draco.”
have earned one.”
“Yup. Not yet—but the process starts next month. By July we’ll be settled.” Seamus was grinning again, but it was softer now, and aimed at Dean.
Harry shook it off. If Malfoy had no more properties left to restore, he was more than welcome at the archive to study coroner reports.
Malfoy came back the following day as soon as the Archive opened. Harry politely processed his request form and Malfoy took his place below the painting once again.
“Of course I suppose you know all about Muggles and science,” he said. “So it must seem silly to you.”
He wondered if it’d be the same with Draco, if he’d need this prop to actually enjoy it, or coax Draco into doing things differently. Different from what? Harry had no frame of reference because he and Draco hadn’t done anything, hadn’t even kissed, and maybe they would never get that far, maybe everything would fall apart before they even got the chance. Maybe they wouldn’t even have to.
“Furnace!”
“I saw it first, so it’s mine!” Avery said.
“Oh. Yeah, of course. I knew that.”
“All right. I understand that what you would like to happen is to find a way to enjoy having sex with your partner without it being a terrible thing to overcome, and without there being this ‘sex-hangover’ afterwards.”
“Why…why lend me that book?” Harry thought maybe he could understand why Malfoy had lent him the queer science fiction novel, and even the romance novel (which he hadn’t got to yet) and the poetry (ditto), but this? Presented as a classic, not as a personal favourite, Harry had thought maybe Malfoy was giving him a piece of wizarding literary history, something Harry wouldn’t have encountered on his own.
All eyes were on Harry. His neck was burning.
“Curious?” Malfoy rubbed his face. “To answer your question. One thing. Well. It taught me that I’m a coward, and that there’s no excuse for making the wrong choices.”
That familiar flare of rage smouldered in Harry’s gut, but he was almost too exhausted to let it live. “Yeah, it’s amazing the difference it makes when I’m actually free to be who I am without my aunt and uncle punishing me for every little thing,” he retorted.
Harry could probably listen to him talk about anything, so long as he did it with this voice.
“We’ll still be around,” Dean said. “Ireland’s connected to the UK Floo Network. But come visit sometime? Bring your date if things go well?”
“No.” The trials had gone on for two years. Harry had done his community service in between testifying—every week he’d had to show in court again—and most evenings he’d been at Pansy’s parties or in bed with Ginny. Those were the years where the exhaustion had carried him through everything. “That was when I started working here, and the year after that I started the daycare.”
“Who is this?”
“Yeah,” he croaked, breathing in the scent of her hair. Floral and sweet. “You too.”
“For company?” Malfoy asked, reading the label. “Jasmine and clary sage are both an aphrodisiac, though jasmine is also a stress reliever. Interesting that they paired it with rose and ylang ylang…” He made a small assenting noise. “Or perhaps not; this seems like it would support a soothing, sensual and romantic atmosphere.”
The wrong impression? “Maybe another time,” Harry agreed. What’d Draco mean by that? Wasn’t this a
She didn’t answer that, instead taking in their outfits. “Are you two trying to bring back pointy hats?”
“Oh, that’s great! Congrats. Do you need a flat? Ginny and I broke up.”
hadn’t been what
“Pointy hat? Those are kind of unfashionable,” Draco said, with a frown. “Only old people wear them, and people in uniforms, you know, like school or ministry.”
“Can I put my arm around you?” Harry clarified. “You don’t have to say yes,” he quickly added. “I just wanted—thought—”
The kids all sniffed the air. “Smells like fire,” Charlie said.
had my big gay awakening,” Pansy then said, thoughtful look on her face. “There was a girl in Durmstrang who just,” Pansy gestured, “did
“Sometimes I read,” Harry said, going over to grab a ball of sunshine, the one he used for the rare early morning bath. “Sometimes I just want a break.” And sometimes he had company, when he could get Ginny to join him. There was a pink bomb with jasmine and rose she liked, that Harry was now eyeing. He had one left at home, that they hadn’t had the chance to use before Ginny left.
Malfoy didn’t answer, just continued eating. Then: “I suppose that depends on whether you’re willing to face those ugly parts yourself. As I recall it, that was the first crucial step for both mechas before they could connect their…hard drives. I imagine real life is much the same.”
“Betty’s mum. She’s on my team?”
sorry. You didn’t deserve any of it.”
Ron shrugged. “There’s not much else to say, is there?” He speared another dumpling. “Unless there’s more to say?”
team, your kids.”
he wanted.
“I—” Harry tried to push the nausea down. “I guess,” he croaked, then cleared his throat.
“Yes,” Harry found himself saying.
“I could’ve done without the press,” Harry muttered to Ginny, who just gave his shoulder a squeeze.
“Ginny,” he gasped, watching Alice—he was almost out of breath, but it didn’t matter—and there,
“How could I resist?” Millicent said. “I had to see Big Gay Pub Night for myself. Draco, long time no see. Hello, Potter. And you two are?”
“All right, uhm…” He turned around. The parents were sitting in the stands, chatting and watching the proceedings. He waved. “Could I have a volunteer? There are brooms in the cupboard!”
Harry chuckled. “I had to say something.” He rubbed his face. “I need to get out of here.”
“Do you want me to talk you into it or out of it?”
“Thanks buddy.” Harry smiled. “I’ll see you next week, we’ll practice some goalkeeping, yeah?”
“Have you faced yours?”
Malfoy very nearly rolled his eyes, it looked like. “You’re on.”
“Ring me if you need something,” he said and left Malfoy to the dusty deaths of Ireland.
“Uhm, so…how is your research going?”
“How do you listen to books? The only books I’ve heard speaking are the ones in the restricted section in the library at Hogwarts. They scream if you try to read them without permission.”
“I guess,” Draco said and sipped his tea. “But I wouldn’t have liked it half as much. I like—I like seeing people earn their happy endings. It’s—on a narrative level, I think it’s more satisfying to structure a love story that way, but personally, emotionally, I just…like it more.”
“Mmh.” Draco kissed Harry’s palm again.
Draco nodded.
“I need to go,” Draco said, and rolled out of bed. With the aid of his wand he cleaned up quickly and started getting dressed.
“Yeah. I wanted to repair them and give them away. Continue to fix what I broke, you know? And give back. But the problem was, most of those properties were dead, and many were in Muggle areas. So I couldn’t use magic to fix them, and while I could give them to magic folks, well. They were still dead, you know?”
“Oh you know, just the usual.” Harry stole a sip from her drink, then leaned over to say hi to Padma. “How’re you two? It’s been a while. Nobody else here yet?”
“Do you mean the part about a private research room, or the part about me?” Harry asked, hoping he wasn’t overstepping his bounds. There was professionalism, and then there was…
But. But Malfoy. Harry closed his eyes, wishing Malfoy were here, or that he was somewhere else, where Malfoy also was. He wanted to continue the conversation they’d had earlier. He wanted to talk to him about queer science fiction novels. He wanted to ask him about the Malfoy properties. He wanted to tell him that he’d got into the archive course, which actually meant telling him he had applied and was waiting for an answer, and that he had some kind of plan with his life now.
Maybe something about cowboys and Indians, he thought, recalling glimpses he’d managed to steal from Dudley’s comics in childhood. Maybe something about space.
“Can I play Beater this time?” Emma piped up.
“…Bill helped me set up some investments or something at Gringotts, I don’t really know what, but the profits of that is what’s keeping the daycare running,” Harry admitted. “I was thinking I could ask him for help with the funds for the team.”
sort him out.
“What?” Draco looked up, surprised. “What has that to do with anything?”
“I gave most of them away. Donated them to the local communities. The ones that had had Muggle tenants often had historical value to the Muggles in the area. The rest, well. I sold some. All the land, most of it arable, some of it forest, I also sold or gave away. Some went to Muggles, some to wizards. And before you ask, all the proceeds went to charity.” Malfoy finished his tart. “Isn’t your break over?”
“Much as I enjoy sucking dick, I don’t enjoy it when the person whose dick I’m sucking doesn’t actually want me to be doing it,” Draco snapped. “That does rather sour the experience of it.”
crying,” Draco said, crying. Fresh tears ran down his cheeks. “I’m just having a lot of emotions.”
Harry was tired, not because he’d slept badly, but because he’d stayed up until two in the morning reading the science fiction novel Malfoy had lent him. He’d drawn up a bath and thrown in his last bath bomb (a sunset bomb with lavender and other things, designed to calm and induce sleep), and had only come out of the bath when the water had cooled completely, and he was tired enough to almost drop the book into it. Harry had dragged himself to bed, then, with the scent of lavender in his hair and faint glitter residue on his skin following him there.
“All right.” Ginny leaned against him. She watched him finish building the bookcase. She watched him test its stability and move it to the wall. She watched him shuffle it a few inches to the right and then just a half inch to the left, until it was perfect. “Come to bed,” she said when it was all done, “and let’s break in this home of ours.”
Betty scraped her knee falling off her broom and Harry put his thoughts aside for a moment to convince her to let him patch her up. He kept a closer eye on the kids after that and had almost shaken his brain out of the unending cycle of despair and anger and vile feeling of injustice and jealousy by the time he met Hermione for lunch.
“Like this,” Betty declared.
There was a kind of urgency behind Draco’s every move that Harry hadn’t expected—or, well, he sort of had, but he was surprised anyway. Their clothes were off and folded neatly (another of Draco’s neuroses) in no time, and then it was like Draco was trying to drown himself and come up for air at the same time.
Draco nodded thoughtfully. “That’s nice of them.”
“It’s not really a coming-of-age story,” Malfoy said, after a while. “But it was for me.”
“Because I pretended I couldn’t get a date so you’d go with me,” Seamus said. “It didn’t really work, but I think my lack of seduction skills can be excused. I was fourteen.”
Maybe he could just transfigure the bed for now, and then get a new one later.
Confused, Harry opened it.
He could go in, pick a book, and take it home, wondering all the while if maybe Malfoy would’ve liked it, or he could just go home. Ginny was at home.
“That’s quite all right, thank you.” Malfoy cleared his throat. “Have a lovely evening.”
She flashed him a grin and went back to sit with Love’s and Denise’s mums, and Harry turned his full attention on the kids.
“Yes, you get to play Beater this time,” Harry said, glancing at his roster and all his notes. “And Anthony, you’re Seeker, and Jamie, you’re Chaser. Is everyone ready?”
“Wow,” Harry finally said, his tongue feeling thick. “That’s—not what I expected. Du—P, what the hell? Where is all this coming from?”
“Oh,” said Malfoy, following him into the study. It was relatively small, but there was a desk, a chair, and several empty shelves. There were two windows, facing north and east respectively, and a small painting of a cherry tree. “It’s suitable.”
Harry had Quidditch Daycare on Monday mornings, so he wasn’t at the Archive until after lunch. He inquired with Albert, but Malfoy hadn’t come by—yet. Malfoy hadn’t said when he’d come in again or asked when Harry would be in, for the matter of it, so Harry didn’t know if he’d come at all. He took over front desk duty from Mildred, checked the visitor logs and made a quick round of the reading hall, and settled back behind the desk.
Ginny and Rhosyn shared a look. “That was fast.”
“It is also an anxiety thing,” Malfoy added, with a wry smile. “At least the first few times. I didn’t like sitting in here with strangers nearby.”
He wanted to tell Draco. He wanted to show him these articles, show him there was a
the distress radiate from his body. “I see.”
“Right. Your course? I’ll walk you.” Malfoy put his bag into a well-charmed concealed pocket, where it disappeared out of sight and didn’t cause any unnecessary break in Malfoy’s silhouette.
And if he was even more honest than that…all he really wanted to do with his time was to be with the people he cared about. He hadn’t seen Teddy in weeks, he hadn’t properly hung out with anyone outside of Friday pub nights, and he’d love to get more than a handful of hours with Draco that weren’t spent doing homework. He missed their discussions. He missed eating lemon meringue tart with Draco in the Archive garden while talking about house-elves.
“That’s an odd day for a date,” Malfoy commented. “It works for me. Should I bring something? Muggle cash? I don’t have any, so I’ll have to make an appointment at Gringotts first.”
“Lots of pillows?”
. “Oh!”
Little League Quidditch was going to be…interesting, if it took off the ground. There were two age brackets, five to six and seven to eight, and so far, there were four teams registered to the lower bracket while the upper bracket had ten teams. Harry trusted the seven and eight-year-olds to be able to play Quidditch semi-competently, but if the other four teams were anything like his kids…
Malfoy blinked. “Oh! Sorry. There’s no party. This is for LARPing,” he said, enunciating carefully. “We’re both wizards.”
He and Draco had picked up their new robes, cloaks, and hats from the tailor this morning before heading out for the game, and while Draco was wearing his new outfit already, Harry wouldn’t be changing into his until now. During the game he had had his game clothes on, ordinary robes and a cloak with the team name and his name written on the back in the team colours (maroon and black), all to identify him as the captain of the team.
And Harry wanted to know things about Malfoy, like which way his hair parted in the mornings before he styled it, if it misbehaved at all, and how many sugars he liked in his coffee, if he liked coffee at all, and if he would—could—
, I just don’t
Harry laughed. “Thank you, Charlie, but I think I’ll give these cards to my friends, because I love them very much,” he said. “Have you finished your card? Do you want me to help you write a message?”
The Butterfly Bumpkins had won their third game by a hair; Candy Cranes had put up a good fight. As much as it could be called a fight with children this age—but the weather had been good, the kids had been in a good mood, and everyone had had fun. The defeat to the Fishes the previous weekend seemed all but forgotten, and when the game ended with the Snitch still on the loose and Butterfly Bumpkins ahead by ten points, the kids were happy.
Strange, thought Harry, watching him go. Both Malfoy’s choice of reading material and the detached way he’d spoken to Harry, as if they were...strangers. Interacting with Malfoy in the past had usually been coloured by annoyance and alcohol, even when they’d been civil—and on rare occasions, even friendly—and this had been anything but.
Draco’s eyes welled up and his entire face contorted in a way Harry had rarely seen before.
“I’m not laughing at you,” Malfoy said. “I’m just realising something.”
want to have sex in general, but I do kind of want it anyway, but in a detached kind of way, like, I want to make him happy, and I know it can be nice, and I want it to be nice, but when I just think about it I…
“It’s beautiful,” Ginny agreed, vibrating with glee. For a moment Harry forgot they were broken up and that they’d been awful together—they’d always been great like this, when it was about anything else but their relationship.
“Is she always like this?” Draco asked, watching her go. “That was awkward.”
Ginny moved to sit at the table. “What’d you fight about?”
“Are you entering the Little League?” Lee asked, leaning across the table.
“Ew, that’s just gross.” Harry shuddered. “He wasn’t capable of love, or remorse, or anything that could’ve redeemed him. His story could never have been a romance.”
Below is a brief-ish summary of PCD and "stuff".
Harry didn’t know if he’d ever see her again, or if Ginny even wanted to see him again…and what was worse, he didn’t know if he really wanted to see her, either.
Malfoy did, in fact, object to lunch.
“So it’s a
“Now?” Harry’s stomach dropped. “I—okay, if that’s what you want?” He wasn’t entirely sure that’s what
“You didn’t hate it? Okay…but…so…”
He noticed Hermione and Ron sharing a look.
Harry shuffled his chair closer. Draco was a bit taller than him, but it wasn’t a noticeable difference like this, so Harry put his arm around Draco’s shoulders, resting it on the back of Draco’s chair. “This good?”
“You’re not staying,” Harry said. He looked at her. “I—” What was there to say? What he wanted, she wouldn’t—couldn’t?—give him, and what she wanted…Harry couldn’t give her either.
“There’s a Little League tournament starting up. It’s a charity fundraising thing, only a few games, and the prize is a,” Harry leaned in to whisper, “chocolate trophy.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, automatically. He didn’t feel like a good captain. He just felt like a confused person.
“Er. Cordless telephones?”
“Zoë Hopper? Last I heard Juniper was dating her,” Millicent said. “I think they’re engaged, actually.”
“Fine! Fine! You can have sheep and a furnace and whatever, but don’t come complaining to me when the shed turns out too small for all your hundred and fifty-seven art projects and you can’t find your oil paints under ninety pounds of unspun wool.”
“Don’t look at me like that.”
There was a letter on the floor by the door. Harry’s heart jumped into his throat before he picked it up and then dropped into his stomach when he realised it wasn’t from Draco. It was a Muggle letter, delivered by Muggle post, and it was from Peony. Harry stared at the letter, disappointed it wasn’t from Draco and confused it was from Peony, and angry, and upset, and tired.
date?
“Yeah?” Malfoy rarely talked about what he did when he wasn’t at the Archive. Harry knew he wasn’t seeing his friends on a regular basis; Malfoy never talked about them, and Harry had asked both Pansy and Blaise the last time he’d seen them, and neither had heard from him in months. “What kind of plans?”
The meadow was bathed in sunlight and the grass swayed in the wind, the bunnies that lived in it running hither and thither. Malfoy didn’t pay attention to any of it.
ETA jan 2021:
“Okay. Do you want to try again?” Harry silently reset the broom as he moved it to lie on the ground between them.
“Harry,” Draco said, “it’s pointless discussing it further. Mood thoroughly ruined and all that. We can talk about it later if you want, but right now I just want to get back to my tea and maybe try to catch up with Pansy. I haven’t…been the best of friends, to her, lately.”
, and
Which was why Harry was now trying to find out if he could find Dudley. He checked Surrey first, in case the Dursleys had returned and Dudley had chosen to stay close to his parents, but while he did find his aunt and uncle back at 4 Privet Drive, Dudley wasn’t listed at that address.
His first instinct was to run after Draco, apologise, beg on his knees if he had to, and bring him back. But Draco had said he needed space, so instead Harry was still sitting on the bed, cold and sticky and heavy-hearted.
The stadium was enchanted with anti-Apparition wards, so they had to get outside the boundary to leave. Harry tugged Draco off.
“Yes—well, actually, I’m almost done with this lot, so would like to get some more reports up.” Malfoy had sorted the documents neatly, and was retaining a small pile. “I have the reference numbers copied down of some of the other reports I looked at before, if I could have those up too?”
why he was messed up like this, and—reality came crashing, as Harry remembered that Draco had left and hadn’t answered his owl and might not want to talk to him at all.
“Mmh, after.”
“That is entirely up to you.” Malfoy finished his food. “And I’m not going to lie and tell you that it doesn’t hurt to try. It might. But if you want to fix…things, it’s a start.”

Gladys, seemingly aware that Harry had reached the end of his tether where therapy was concerned, rounded off. She gave him a brief rundown of what kind of phrases for good communication he could use that Harry nodded through, and a pamphlet about healthy communication habits that Harry pocketed without so much as looking at it.
, he’d just been hoping it wouldn’t be
“Yes, thank you.”
,” Harry answered. “Anyway, they weren’t going to tell me I couldn’t support more than one charity, you know?” Oliver had told him that once rumour spread that he was joining the project, interest had increased. Seemed like suddenly people were interested in charitable work as soon as there was a chance to be in the same league as Harry Potter. “Come to all the games. Your ticket money will go to several good causes.”
“I guess,” Harry repeated. The exhaustion was creeping into his bones. He glanced at Draco, who was no longer pretending to be reading his book but was openly looking over at their table. He raised an eyebrow and Harry nodded. Yes, he thought. Let’s leave soon. He hoped Draco got the message.
If Malfoy was interested at all.
“It’s all terrible. I just want to be in love.” Harry stood up. “I’m going home.”
“I see.” Peony had the decency to look appropriately ashamed. “Well—lay it on me, then.”
“Was that dramatic enough for everyone?” Blaise then said, amused, and moved past the topic. “Good to see you, Draco. This is Gilliam, the most perfect boyfriend in history and also the love of my life.”
What kind of question was that? Harry’s brain stalled. Get back together? Maybe if she’d asked—no, it didn’t matter. She was right: he hadn’t fought the break up. He’d let her leave. Amidst all the heartache, he’d felt
minutes late, which wasn’t out of the ordinary on Mondays, but
“I don’t know,” Harry managed to tell him. “I don’t know where to start or what to do or what I like.”
“I know how to read, Malfoy,” Harry snapped. He instantly regretted it—Malfoy’s face shuttered, and he’d taken a small step back. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean for it to come out like that.”
Clutching the paper bag, he went home.
“They both are.”
“You don’t
The kids cheered. Some of them also giggled. He had to learn their names as fast as he could.
“That’s easy for you to say—”
He was impeccably dressed, though he had dark circles under his eyes and a sickly tint to his complexion. He’d changed his hairstyle since Harry had last seen him, what had possibly been three or four years prior, but his white-blond hair didn’t look the way it usually did, if Harry’s memory was anything to go by; it wasn’t as shiny as he remembered it to be.
“I haven’t had the chance to read them yet,” Harry said. “I just started the robots one. I was going to read it tonight.”
Draco’s pink cheeks and stern demeanour were delightful, and Harry wanted nothing more than to look at him for the rest of his life. He’d never tire of this sight.
Harry tried to protest, but Malfoy ignored it, striding to the front of the store. Harry followed him and watched helplessly as Malfoy paid for both the book and a small pile of other books that the shopkeeper materialised onto the counter.
Harry wanted to ask about the peacocks at Malfoy Manor, or talk about the science fiction novel Malfoy had lent him, or come up with any other excuse to talk to him some more, but Malfoy looked settled to work, and Harry had to go help Janie with a collection of letters.
Pansy shrieked suddenly, a cue that some particularly exciting person had arrived. Harry turned to see Blaise and Millicent making their way over, carrying a large number of drinks on fire. “Millie!” Pansy shrieked. “I thought you weren’t coming!”
“Yep,” Harry responded. If he was going to have to fake it, then so be it.
“Yes.” Malfoy drew out the little black notebook from some invisible pocket or other and extracted a folded request form. He unfolded it slowly, then held it in his hand as if he wasn’t sure whether to give it to Harry or not.
“Yeah,” Harry said, touching his cheek where he was positive Draco had just kissed him.
“Ginny,” Draco said suddenly and Ginny turned her attention back to them. “I didn’t get you a badge because I didn’t know what to put on it. Do you want one? I’ll personalise it any way you like.”
“What did
“It’s nothing,” Harry said, the words turning sour in his mouth instantly. Of course it wasn’t

queer friends about Big Gay Pub Night, a small handful of Quidditch players that Harry didn’t know had turned up, too. They’d set Draco on edge for a hot minute, but once it was clear they were there to chill he’d relaxed again.
,” she said, her tone so scornful that Harry nearly grounded her on the spot. “See? Mum charmed them to protect my fingers.”
“Have you, ah, processed my request?”
“I can’t today. I have other plans.”
It’d been less than a week and he was already feeling…if not nothing, then very little?
think is important, or something someone else told you is important?” Draco asked, and he sounded so much like Gladys that Harry felt a little bad for putting him in this situation to start with. “Because I’m going to be honest here and say it sounds like you don’t really believe a word of what you’re saying.”
“He does, eventually. But until then there’s all kinds of bullshit,” Malfoy agreed. “I never said it was a good novel, just that it was a classic.”
