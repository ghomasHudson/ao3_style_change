Harry moved through the landscape of the dead for an age, or for a heartbeat. He felt like he was suspended in an eternal moment. The only sound was the harsh panting of his own breath. Everywhere he looked were sightless eyes, accusing faces.
The boy smiled, showing a missing tooth in the front. 'My name is Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy. Can you tell me a story about Quidditch? Did you fight a dragon? Teddy said you fought a dragon.'
'It was,' Draco agreed, throat raw.
'Are you invisible now, Harry?' she asked.
'I've been a part of that life for about ten years now,' Draco said, leaning forward. It was important that he try to make them see. 'Since not long after school. It's not about hurting people,' he said, hoping they might be able to understand. It was a concept many people who didn't feel the need for that sort of experience often couldn't comprehend. 'Pain might be a part of what happens - not always - but the core of the experience is to allow people the freedom to be whoever they want to be - to explore their desires in a safe space, to take control or give control in whatever way they need.'
'Good idea,' he says. He pulls a file to the table in front of him and flicks the cover open as he drops into a seat beside Draco. Draco looks faintly surprised by his choice of chair but he doesn't say anything, just reaches for a file of his own. Harry can smell the warm sweetness of his happiness and suddenly he wants to reach out and touch Draco, to remind himself how he felt, to see how his scent would change at an action like that.
'Is this because you want to mess with Davies?' Malfoy asks, and his scent sharpens. Harry can't quite read it. It smells like… interest?
'How are you feeling about it?' Harry asked.
He found himself focussing more and more on the presence, trying to remember how it looked, what it did, how it
'What?' he asked, belatedly, hoping what he'd been thinking wasn't written all over him.
'You just ate an hour ago,' Draco said, eyeing him.
The idea sent a frisson of doubt through him. Harry wouldn't do that … would he? Two weeks earlier, Draco would have been sure of the answer. Now - now, Potter was basically having him arrested within fifty metres of his son. Anger battled the doubt, pulling it under and rising in its place, making him feel sharp and alert.
'You must have misunderstood me when I told you to get out,' he said. 'What I meant was, I have absolutely no interest in hearing any proposal that a bunch of blood supremacists who supported a genocidal maniac have to offer.'
Ladon hesitated, hand still on the box, facing away from Harry.
It was three more days before he could talk to Ginny … it wasn't that he'd been avoiding it. There had been a big case at work he'd had to stay late for - a Muggle had driven a lorry straight into the side of a bus full of wizarding families, headed to the Bridge for one of the Reparation Society outings. Two adults and five children were in St Mungo's being treated for serious injuries. The driver had died at the scene. The crash in itself would have been written off as an unfortunate accident … but the Muggle had had photos in his vehicle. Names. Like he had been watching some of the families who had been on the trip.
He would rock James back and forth in his arms.
'What's up?' Harry asks instead, pushing away those thoughts. It's no good thinking them when nothing will come of them.
He toyed with the leather band … maybe Malfoy had a point … did Malfoy have a point? Had he just done what he did with life because everyone had expected him to? He sighed and let his fingers fall from his neck, pushing himself up and out of bed. He needed to shower and eat. It was too early to be having an existential crisis.
No, Markwell is a client and Harry is a random choice—one of ten employees—and Archer just happened to pick him. That's all.
'Come inside, dear,' she said. 'Let's get you a cup of tea and something to eat. You're looking a bit peaky.'
One was tall and slim, blonde hair shining under the light. He was wrapped in a cloak that covered him from neck to ankle. For a moment, Harry thought of Malfoy the night before, shining brightly from across the room. He smiled wryly at the idea that prim and proper pureblood Draco Malfoy would be into anything like this, let alone at a Muggle club.
Harry looked around the room, biting his lip, then he spotted a guest he'd been curious about, 'What about her,' he said, nodding at a woman in a red and gold shimmering dress. Her mask pointed at the nose and curved in flaring spikes behind her head.
at him. 'He works for the Floo Network in some shitty job. That reminds me,' Harry said, turning to Hermione with a frown. 'Who can I talk to about the fact that he's been treated so badly since he started work at the Ministry? He's in some stupid job that's a waste of his time. He was second to you in school. He shouldn't be duplicating reports for a living.'
Draco gasped and had to close his eyes as the tentacle in his arse, which had slipped out during the adjustment, was inserted back in, pushing in deeper than before. He'd never felt so full and the feeling squeezed tears from his eyes. The tentacle retreated slightly and Draco shuddered as he felt another enter beside it, the two of them squirming their way in.
Harry eyed her sideways and shook his head. 'Thanks, but I'm fine.'
Harry did glance at him, then, or where Draco's voice was coming from, under the Cloak.
'Ah, Draco. I love you,' Harry bit into his shoulder, hammering his arse, almost brutal in his need. 'I love you. I love you. Fuck, Draco.' Another package burst and it seemed that was what set Harry off. His arms tightened around Draco as he shuddered, thrusting hard up against him as he emptied himself, his come mingling with the squid's.
Harry narrowed in on Lucius, stepping into the room. His team fanned out behind him. There were no other chairs in the room - of course there weren't. Malfoy probably wanted them to stand, like supplicants before him.
Was Malfoy a Catalyst, like him?
Harry couldn’t quite hold his eyes as he mumbled something about not having got around to it. Then he changed the subject abruptly.
Harry pulled his Auror robes off, throwing them over the back of a chair and calling a bottle of firewhisky and a glass to himself as he sank into his armchair with a sigh. He put his feet up on the coffee table, leaving his boots on as he let himself think back over the interview, running his mind over it again and again, pulling out the key points to turn them around. He tried to separate himself - his thoughts and emotions - from the facts of what had been said. But it was hard. Watching Malfoy from behind the glass had been far more difficult than he had imagined. A part of him had enjoyed the chance to just watch, unseen, to let his eyes trace over Draco's features, noting the hardness to them, the sharp beauty that had lured him in.
Draco rose to the bait beautifully, holding out his hand and wandlessly Accioing one of the brooms. It hit his palm with a smack and Harry grinned.
'Just sick,' he croaked, his voice hoarse. He remembered screaming - sobbing - and he felt the emotions swirling up into him again, threatening to drag him back under.
'You should eat something,' I say, eyeing the nearly empty glass in his hand. As soon as the words are out of my mouth, I want to take them back. What do I care if Potter eats or if he drinks himself into a stinking mess on the floor?
He reached the side table and stretched down to pick up the framed picture. It was of Malfoy and his son. They were riding a broom together. The boy looked to be around four years old and his face shone with happiness as he gripped the broom handle, leaning down as though to make it go faster. Malfoy was sitting behind him with one arm wrapped around him. The look on his face was one of pride mixed with a desperate tenderness that made something crack in Harry's chest.
Ginny's eyes narrowed, but she took a deep breath. 'I haven't been
He realised Sue hadn't responded, and looked back at her.
'You won't hurt me, Harry,' he says, and there's a hint of something dark and excited in his voice.
He didn't try to talk to her again. He stood beside her instead and they stared into the hole together.
Instead, Harry fucks him through his orgasm, grinding into him, and after a few moments Draco opens his eyes, panting hard. A smirk hovers over his lips, widening as he smears his thumb through the mess on his stomach. Harry feels something burn and twist inside him at the look in Draco's eyes. He looks positively devilish as he brings his thumb up and rubs it across Harry's lips.
He's at almost three hundred when he realises the sound of Malfoy's relentless scratching and tapping has stopped. He tries to think, as he continues moving, when he'd heard it stop.
birthday party - all alone?'
'Again,' Harry slurred and Draco grinned around his cock, scraping his teeth again before biting down lightly.
'Us,' Harry said. 'Here. Me, letting you into my mind voluntarily.'
Harry smiled. 'Sorry. I just wanted to come in and say thank you,' he said, trying to convey the depths of his gratitude. 'For all of this. It's amazing. Perfect.'
He looked across at the stage to see the man being released from his restraints and the woman in red standing behind him with a cloth, which she was using to soothe the marks on the backs of his legs. Harry was sitting close enough to the stage that he could catch some of her words.
When Harry drifted slowly back into awareness, he could hear singing. A gentle melody. A sound that made him feel safe. Protected. It took a while before he realised it was coming from the man laying beside him - the man he was curled around and half on top of. It took longer before he realised that man was Ladon. He lay quietly, feeling as though he was floating, letting the soft words drift over him - he couldn’t understand them, but they were beautiful.
like it,' he said. 'I was half hard most of that damned party thinking about why you had it and what you did with it.' Harry groaned softly and nudged his hips against Draco's thigh again. 'I couldn't stop thinking about what you imagine while you use that thing on yourself.'
All of the pieces of the conversation click into place and Harry realises that the 'product' the two of them have been talking about importing is children. Malfoy is a fucking child smuggler. Harry feels a red hot rage fill him, a flood of sick disgust underlying it. A snarl pushes its way past his lips, deep and vicious.
, he thinks as the realisation rips through him.
Harry rolled his eyes. 'What job? All I fucking do is sit around and get paraded out whenever the Ministry needs the Chosen Face for their Chosen Cause or their Chosen Fucking Message.'
'Fine,' Draco answered. Harry raised an eyebrow and Draco huffed.
Harry looked around for another empty seat - the last thing he wanted to do was sit next to Draco Malfoy and have to pretend to be polite to him in front of the children. Everything around them was full.
'Perhaps
Harry almost doesn't need him to continue. He's seen the story play out so many times. He feels the freshness of his lingering grief over Teddy tugging at him, twining with the loss in Malfoy’s voice.
'Harry,' came a relieved voice from beside him, and then Ron was there, breaking into his spiraling thoughts and standing over him, looking down with concern written all over his face. He turned away for a second and Harry caught a glimpse of Ron's Patronus flowing from the end of his wand, the jack russell tearing from the room. Then he sank back into his chair, reaching out to grip Harry's hand in both of his, squeezing it as he let out a shaky breath.
Harry's eyes were drawn by Malfoy's hands, deftly undoing his belt buckle and then his flies. He watched, unable to look away as Malfoy shimmied out of his tight jeans, standing naked, cock jutting in front of him. Harry licked his lips, but Malfoy took a step forward, dropping gracefully to his knees, as he opened Harry's jeans, pulling his cock out and pausing to look up at him.
'Young Master,' Modrey said, inclining his head, so that his large ears flopped forward. 'Master is in the red drawing room. Modrey shall take you to him.'
Then Harry pushed his sleeves up to his elbows and Draco's eyes dropped to the red welt that ran up the inside of his forearm. He felt all other thoughts leave his mind and desire spark in his chest at the sight of - at the mark he had left on Harry with the agiel. Harry hadn't healed it. Draco couldn't take his eyes off it - this proof that what had happened between them was real … that Harry had wanted it. Then Harry shifted and drew his sleeves back down. Draco's eyes flicked up to Harry's face, to see his cheeks had darkened slightly.
Malfoy waves him off with a smile and Davies makes his way through the diners, walking with a grace that reminds Harry of a predator stalking.
“You’re both so stupidly blind. Harry
Suddenly a rustle of blankets made Harry look up from his lunch. Draco was stirring, grey eyes blinking up at Harry.
Maquis that Hermione made an alliance with.
“You didn’t like the owls.”
“Well, as it happens, I know your parents, and I know for a fact that Lee is blindingly in love with your mum. He and Ginny took a long time to find one another, but their marriage is a strong and healthy union, and without it you wouldn’t exist.”
Harry pushed the shovel into the dirt again, tossing the lumps and clods that came up. Neville had tried teaching him the planting spells he used with Third years, optimistically ignoring Harry’s perpetually abysmal Herbology marks. But Harry preferred it this way, manually, his muscles shifting with the work. Besides, the longer Harry stayed outside the Potions classroom, the better the odds of the Potions professor coming out to yell at him.
“Rousingly romantic, thank you. Yet you
“Oh for heaven’s sake,” Hermione snapped, “you two deserve each other.”
“Merlin, I
Death Eater,” Harry said. He pointed down to the tile they were standing on, where
The shout as Harry came was hoarse and halfway sobbing, but Malfoy held him through it and licked him clean after. Harry fought, with every atom of strength left, to not let his legs give out. The fissures beneath his ribs and around his heart had fractured, had splintered the very foundation of his universe.  Malfoy stood, calm and composed, and tucked Harry back into his kisbet, carefully and gently, all while Harry tried to remember how to breathe.
“Probably barely,” Harry called back, and it was like a dance: throw a quick shield spell around Draco here, sidestep a curse there, and an instinctive pivot to let Draco move around him to launch an attack of his own. “Think of all the other things I’ve done to make you hate me. This is a treat in comparison!”
“Er,” Harry said. “It was…square-ish? I don’t remember much, but I’m happy to give you the memory for a pensieve if you think that might help.”
“Basically. No fighting, no bitterness, and a bond that happens properly, instead of this mess created by that blasted beacon.”
Harry closed his eyes. “It’s not what you think.”
“Hey! I’m a professor now, remember? I can figure out stuff for myself.”
Draco stiffened, but not how he was stiff before. Now he was coiled, poised, suspended. “You’re planting Narcissus?”
“Samantha, are your parents soul mates?”
“Draco?”
There had been one kiss, only one. One kiss that was biting and familiar and desperate and sweet and perfect, perfect, perfect. One kiss, under the fireworks for Guy Fawkes, before Draco had pulled away, running his fingers carefully, reverently along Harry’s chin, and said, “never again.”
“It’s
Harry felt Draco’s long fingers wrap around his wrist pulling him up. “Well, Potter? What have you got to say for yourself to redeem this farce of a situation?”
“Where do I dig?”
He had asked his die to get him to a tile with booze,
Draco looked up as the gust of wind nudged his shins.
was scripted beneath their feet in glowing letters. “We’re going down this path, right?”
“The only living ‘expert’ is Cyril Celandine,” Draco said. “And he’s an insult to the Curse-Breaking community. He had no issue destroying people in order to break a curse and then charging triple for the honour. He only switched to breaking soul bonds so he could start fleecing Purebloods horrified at discovering their soul mate was a rent boy, and claims he can split a fully bonded pair—which has
Draco turned around to face his parents. “Mother…”
After everything, Draco needed to be the first to know, but he’d been in Paris with his mother, and would be taking an international Portkey straight to work this morning. So Harry didn’t bother with an owl, and instead sped out the door without no breakfast, charged into their office, and said, “Draco! Yesterday —”
“…How do we pet a crup on fire?”
Draco blinked at the sudden and overwhelming rush of affection he felt at the sight of Harry’s pouting face. He stepped forward, cupped Harry chin, and kissed him, immediately certain that he’d do anything to be the person gifting sleazy novels to Harry in their old age. “Harry, I’m positively heartbroken at
big enough to fit a small, cheap desk. Even with his chair out of the way, the door could only open three-quarters of the way before it knocked into the desk drawer that wouldn’t properly close, jarring the unstable lighting charm into flickering violently for a minute or so.
Harry sighed. “I understand that, Sam, it’s okay. We all know you never intended to get us into this mess.”
“I think I’m grateful to the beacon,” Draco said quietly. “Despite it all.”
The door opened and Harry stepped in again.
got absolute confidence in you,” and he winked.
Draco closed his eyes, and said a very long sentence in French that sounded like it had a lot of swearing in it. The clouds drifting below them didn’t seem to care, but then the insults probably weren’t for them.
Draco frowned, thinking. “Oh, right, I remember. I was about to keep you from falling and then everything went black.”
He hadn’t even finished talking when there was a sudden woosh of sound to their left. One by one, tiles slid through the grey and settled into a new path that branched out from the white tile they were on. It stretched all the way out to a faraway tile that glowed with faint blue letters:
Draco huffed in aggravation, letting go of Harry’s wrist, flinging his hands up and spinning back to the pile of tied up smugglers, who were still yelling at Draco in French. He reached into his robes, yanked out the Ministry Emergency Apprehension Portkey — a Christmas ornament shaped like a pineapple — activated it and flung it at the smugglers, whipping them off to the Auror’s holding cells and leaving the stretch of wing suddenly empty except for the wind.
“But sir, it’s said that your soulmate is your perfect match, a balancing and equal force that can complete you!” Diana shouted.
Draco, clever Draco, figured out what was happening before Harry did. He gasped, reached out for Harry’s mucky, outstretched hand and said, “Harry,
“I can wait here all day,” Malfoy said, “but eventually, you have to choose to follow my orders.”
“Oh yes, your predecessors have certainly put the Defence against the darks arts on the map as being one of the more intellectually challenging subjects, Lockhart obviously being the crown jewel of your lot.”
It took thirty-one hours before the
, pathetically in love with you, but left with closed doors, and secret rendezvous, and whatever bones you throw me!”
“Yeah, me too.”
so much that she landed us in an abandoned pocket dimension because of your flirting!”
Draco’s eyes widened, but it only took a moment for him to school his features in an expression of curious interest.
Honestly, this whole situation was just really great.
The dice bounced, rolled, and landed on a total of Ten.
Which is why Potter had no excuse to wander out of his office and into the downstairs bathroom to sing like a collapsing accordion whenever he felt bored.
“I was being polite!”
“Because you won’t obey me?” Malfoy asked. “We both know you
“Er, yes.” Harry tried a shrug and a half-grin, so he wouldn’t look like he was screaming inside.
From three tiles away, Harry took a step forward and paused, opening his mouth to say something, but then the orange space beneath his feet gave way, letting Harry and his black die drop into the void with a yell.
kids. Not having kids is the reason Ginny and I got divorced!”
Draco paused, eyebrow raised. “My entrance hasn’t gotten that kind of response from you in years. I feel nearly fifteen again.”
, minutes ago. Hours ago? Whole identities ago? “Don’t worry, many do. But just in case, Voldemort collected a whole assortment of incentives, for those supporters who needed a bit more motivation.” Malfoy hummed. “Will you let me finger you?”
Harry grinned. Draco was threatening his life. Draco got the letter.

Or a dangerous, twisted hope for who
The bottle was empty, so Draco hurled it into the void and let his head drop to his knees, since the tears weren’t really stopping anymore.
Well. He had ruined his only chance at excellent sex by falling in fucking love, and then falling into a fucking pocket dimension, where he watched the man he loved fall into endless fucking nothingness. There was plenty to be disappointed about.
that’d make you think you weren’t good enough for me. But I did. Even though you’re smart, and generous, and damn funny, and I’m sorry. Because I think I love you too, and I think I ought to be doing whatever I can to deserve your love for me. Starting, probably, with telling every news outlet I can about how I’ll be with you as long as you’ll have me. And that they can fuck right off if they don’t like it.”
Draco manoeuvred himself out of his chair and squeezed out the door, heading to the stairs. The downstairs bathrooms were the closest to the trainee offices, and used almost constantly. Draco knew this because his office was, of course, directly above the bathrooms, allowing him to hear every single miserable flush that came out of them.
Draco had always known he was gay, but he’d resigned himself to the fact that he would be married off to a woman and spend his entire life trapped in a lie to please his parents. He never thought he’d find himself here, smiling and ecstatic, on the morning of his wedding to a man. And not just any man, the most incredible man he’d ever known.
“Hey! If you add one, we’ve rolled a seven!” Harry grinned. “And we’re on a white tile. I wonder what our prize is?”
“Yeah, yeah, don’t lord it over me,” Harry said. He pulled the spectacles out of the case, and nodded at the ones Malfoy had brought. “Well, then. Think we should give these a whirl?”
“Fantastic,” Draco snatched the broom from Harry, enlarged it, then made to straddle it. “Aren’t you coming?”
“A soul beacon,” Draco said, tapping his finger on an image in the book and sliding it over for Harry to examine. “It’s a device meant to attract or draw one’s soulmate to them. Once it’s activated, it would act like a homing beacon. The activator puts a portion of their magic into it and the beacon identifies their mate’s signature. Then it magnifies the activators magical signature across large distances seeking and attaching to the mate. Essentially a person’s soul mate would find themselves inextricably driven to make choices that would lead them to the possessor of the beacon. Once the two meet, they both touch the beacon and it dissolves, returning the pieces of each witch or wizard to their owner completing their bond.“
Having Draco yell at him wasn’t ideal. Harry preferred Draco talking to him about Quidditch, or teasing Harry about his terrible singing while Harry teased right back about the Snape-like swish of Draco’s robes. Draco yelling at him would be an improvement, though, to the frozen and withdrawn silences that have taken to surrounding Draco like gauze.
“I can handle this whole farce effortlessly and still find it damned inconvenient.” Draco’s
Later, Draco would claim that it was his Healer instinct that pushed him to reach for Harry, an instinct he’d have for any patient in need of help. Deep within him, though, burned the absolute knowledge that Draco’s body moved because it was
“There’s nothing wrong with pirates,” Harry said.
Harry growled. “We
“Of all the bloody ways to do it,
“But despite the risk, for that sort of bond, wouldn’t it all be worth it? To have the person that completes you and loves you unconditionally?”
Draco pulled back and very nearly shoved Harry onto the stupid orange tile right then.
Draco had blamed it on the cabin air, apparently. It was the “stale oxygen they puff out at the Economy Muggles in that arial plane” that made Draco sneeze and let his flashy Auror robes flicker into view, which gave it all away. Not at all the fact that the smugglers were
“It’s
?” Harry nodded and Draco tilted his head, regarding him. “And you decided to stay with me until I woke up? How very noble of you.”
His lips were cold, but his breath was so, so warm. It tingled across Harry’s lips as Draco pulled back, then gently kissed him again, the chilly tip of his nose a tentative press against Harry’s cheek. After that kiss, Draco stayed close, fingers in his.
“Sorry,” Draco muttered. “
. “Do you really mean what you said?” he asked.
“No one except for a belaboured champion who should have been
Malfoy walked up to the Holodeck entrance and rapped on the metal, pausing as it slid open. “So now, both of us are an entire lifetime away from the bastard of a man who defined everything we were supposed to be,” he said. “I guess this is probably as good a time as any to figure out who we want to be during that lifetime.”
Harry shook his head. “Okay, I sort of get that: rare things will happen a lot, and common things won’t really happen. How does that help us?”
The curse hadn’t even been meant for him, just an old man’s misfire at some neighbourhood kids badgering him for his dementia. The Cursebreakers examining him were unanimous: only the old man could break the curse, whenever he actually remembered how. The good news, apparently, was that all Harry would forget was just every Tuesday for the rest of his life. He’d only been a proper Auror for a few months, Draco’s partner for a few weeks, and he’d had a panic attack less than twenty minutes after he found out.
.” Draco looked up. “May I have that roll, please?”
Harry nodded. Despite the oddity of it all, he really believed it, too. “All right, then. I trust you.”
Draco vaguely noticed Hermione and McGonagall exchange looks and even Sam looked perplexed. But Harry’s face was what drew his attention, it was oddly blank and expressionless, his eyes shiny.
The truth was, he had been really scared when Draco had passed out like that. Initially because, well, it wasn’t every day someone went out cold like that in front of him. But when Draco hadn’t woken up, Harry had started to panic and called the nurses. Everyone had rushed in, apparently under the impression that Harry was the one in need of help and had been puzzled to find Draco sprawled out on the floor.
Harry leaned against the bare wall, breathless and slick, trying to ignore the tremor under his ribs.
Harry’s ears were still ringing from the force of his orgasm, the static of his synapses too slow to fully process Malfoy’s words. He hadn’t even gotten the feeling back in his fingers, and Malfoy was already back in his uniform, breaking regulation by rolling up the sleeves to show the sharp black snake on his skin.
“This… this is not Hong Kong,” Harry said.
“Victoria, darling, treacle tarts are my fiance’s absolute favorite dessert. It’s still only 9am. We won’t get to dessert till around 6 or 7, I’d wager. Would it be possible to scramble and get some in time? It’s just that one of my vows is that I plan to do everything possible to make this man happy, and I’d hate to break it on the first day of my marriage.”
“That child has a very endearingly good ear for gossip. Andromeda taught him well,” Draco said, but he was only half paying attention to the conversation now. He was frowning at the read-outs. He double-checked Harry’s file, then wiped the monitoring spells and cast a fresh set, but the numbers were exactly the same. “Your vitals are peculiarly strong.”
“What were you thinking, Miss Jordan?”
look at Draco, less than fifteen feet away at any given moment, with the soft strands of his hair catching the sunlight, and the soft pressure of his fingers pressing into Harry’s shoulder as they maneuvered around each other in the hallway. Ron gave him a firm kick in the shins when he caught Harry watching the tilt of Draco’s head as he argued theory with Hermione, and Harry honestly didn’t even care.
Harry grinned across at him. “Looks like the dice rolled a Three. Mind the gap.”
“Don’t worry,” Harry said. “
Samantha had the good sense to look a little ashamed, but continued on, “Nothing sir, but why don’t we learn about them in school?

found out that Harry and Draco were living together.
“You know, the plots of these books are actually really well developed.”
“Then let me show you,” Malfoy murmured. He leaned deep into Harry’s space “Let me show you exactly how I can maintain Command when I’m
“Really? There’s no one?” Ron asked.
“Well, that’s much better than the orange tile,” Harry said, and plopped face-first right into them.

?” Harry said, and looked down to scan the note. It was in a messy hand, the ink blotches making it look like it was written in a rush.
He didn’t have the breath for it, the courage for it, but he still said, “Yes, sir.”
“If you think I’m ever going to respect your
“How come this didn’t manifest itself before?” Draco’s voice woke Harry from his reverie. “I mean, we have touched each other in the past.” He looked down at his hands, his cheeks tinted a lovely pink shade. “Like when you saved me from the fiendfyre,” he added so quietly that Harry almost missed it.
And Draco said, “Harry, what’s the best way to tell you that I’m in love with you? Should I start with our emotional compatibility? Or the fact that my first real sexual fantasy at Hogwarts was about you in nothing but your school tie?”

The following days passed as if someone had cast an
“Roughly 6.6 divided by 10 to the power of 34,” Draco said. “Muggles call it Planck’s Constant, but Wizards have been using ice in fire lizards as a measure of magical probability for millennia. Why?”
“Someone always comes,” they said. “I sent an invitation. No one turns down my invitations.”
A quick
Ruined. The pressure against Draco’s sternum squeezed in. He sat up.
“Well, I couldn’t go further than ten metres from you before I almost had to sick up.”
“Look at that,” he glanced at the clock leaning back against his desk and folding his arms against his rolled up sleeves, “Class is over. Well, I hope this has been enlightening and that we are finished with this topic. Please read the section on Vampires for next class as well as the muggle literature I have provided, and write me three feet of parchment on the difference between muggle lore and fact, detailing specifically how the perception of vampires in muggle culture has affected vampires living in the muggle world.”
Potter was sitting on the counter by the sinks, kicking his scuffed shoes, examining the mould on the ceiling, singing. He more or less had the tune, but seemed to have no idea what all the words were, and so would mumble-hum every few bars until he got to a snatch he remembered again. He sang with gusto, though, letting the acoustics of the bathroom reverberate his voice in winding, off-key echoes.
“The card said to pet all crups, not kneazles.”
So Harry had slammed them against the mats and tried to choke Malfoy, and got a punch in the balls for his efforts.
“Right.” He smiled.
“They identify one another when they first touch with a feeling of love or kind-- OH! I was falling! You meant to help me, you touched me with kind intent, you’d never done that before!”
Harry pulled back to look at Draco suspiciously. “You’re not mocking me?”
“Oh, but Potter,” Malfoy said, spreading his bare arms. “Neither of us are wearing a uniform right now. Isn’t that the point of this
Draco breathed a sigh of relief.
Draco frowned. He had grown into the imposing figure of a Potions Professor, though Harry personally thought Draco pulled it off better than his predecessors. Broad shoulders, lithe body, and razor sharp jawline — every single first year got a crush on Professor Malfoy at some point, and Harry didn’t blame them.
“Yes, of course we did, they’re your favorite.” Draco said waving a hand in Harry’s direction as he flipped to the next page.
The die wiggled, started to bounce, and Harry said: “Hey, I think that magic wall is gon —”
“Er,” Harry said. “How mad at me is ’swearing in French’ mad? Is this more mad than when you’re throwing things?”
The die didn’t move.
“I think I got it now,” Hermione said, pointing at Sam’s notes.
One Monday, Harry woke up to sunshine and songbirds and an unfamiliar owl at his window with a note:
He went out of the room, leaving a strained silence behind him. Draco was confused. Had he said something wrong?
Malfoy gave a halfway wheezing huff of laughter, then slammed his fist down hard into the crux between Harry’s legs. Harry’s training let him catalogue the injury, noting that it was technically an impact to his pelvic girdle. Functionally, though, it was a
“Don’t know what you’re getting at.”
“You know, in Punjabi, my full name means dragon, too,” Jag would say. “They’re prestigious. Around the world, any culture that has dragons reveres them. Knows that dragons are a kind of magic above the rest of the standard breed. Like you and I.”

They probably shouldn’t. Yet the statistically impossible kneazle looked at Draco with improbable eyes, and it was an opportunity he would never get in his life again.
Draco saw it too.
“It’s not
“Professor Potter?”
“I know —” Harry started, but Draco held up a sharp finger: “
“Thought that I joined for the gleeful opportunity of galaxy-wide murder?” Malfoy asked, lipping at Harry’s balls. The balls that Malfoy had
, you’re dead wrong,” Harry snapped.
“Just so you know,” Malfoy said, flicking his tongue out to catch a drop of Harry’s come on his upper lip. “My ship was full of Maquis double agents. Voldemort found out that Pansy, Blaise, Greg, and I were conspiring to sell out his secrets. It’s why Granger let us join this ship on its slow crawl home.”
Hermione nodded. “The work is incredibly amateur. I really wish there were a living scholar we could consult, but there hasn’t been one since 1836.”
“Fine, someday, but not in here,” Draco said. “There’s better places to go in the Ministry in the middle of the night than the bathrooms for a bit of caterwauling. Personally, I prefer the abandoned star charting chambers.”
Draco was right. At school they had always had strong feelings toward each other if not of an affectionate nature. But growing up and getting a second chance after the trials, Harry had seen Draco make amends for his role in the war and for his old beliefs. It had happened on more than one occasion, after dinners at Andromeda and Teddy’s, that he and Draco found themselves at a local pub, talking long into the night, well after Andromeda had had to shoo them out.

“Harry, you really are in love with me, aren’t you?” Draco asked. “This proposal… it isn’t some massive prank you’re pulling on me?”
Draco’s twitching lips slackened in surprise as he realized what he meant. What Potter was offering was a statement of intent, a promise of future interaction. Even after Draco had come down here to shout about the singing.
“It can’t be
The examination had been thorough, and Harry had, in an attempt to respect Draco’s privacy, tried to avert his eyes and then left the room. But he had only made it to the lunch room when an intense nausea took hold of him, and he had to stagger back, just in time to see the nurses stand back in shock of what they had found on Draco’s body: an exact replica of the mark Draco had discovered on Harry’s, the difference being that the hands stretching over Draco’s back were touching.
“No, listen,” Harry said. “You’re quicker at spells than me, so you should stay safe here while I spring the trap, and then, you can save my arse. Otherwise, we’re stuck here until Mr. Ship-Nitwit-Smith gets around to rescuing us.”
Draco sniffled. “Did you practice that?”
Then Draco bit his bottom lip, opened his mouth, bit his lip again before sucking in a deep breath and pressing his mouth to Harry’s.
“Uh, yeah, here,” Harry said, digging it from his pocket and shoving it in Draco’s direction, simultaneously trying to play a card with his other hand. “Neville, come on, ease up on me a bit!”
was to follow through on the unspoken agreement he and Malfoy have observed during every single encounter since their Academy days: if the two of them were alone in the same room together, neither were leaving until one was a clear conqueror.
And so when Harry invited First Officer Malfoy over to the Holodeck for a sparring match, they both knew why. Defense was Harry’s domain, the Holodeck program his own special creation. When you walked in, it automatically generated a random combat arena — from Medieval Earth knights at a joust to a Klingon bat’leth training yard to a Vulcan

Harry studied the way Malfoy’s eyes studied the paper, the way his fingers traced over the ink. He didn’t exactly have any kind of grand Cursebreaker gaze, but it was effective enough for seeing what he needed to. “You believe this is real, don’t you?” he asked. “You believe this isn’t some kind of joke, or mistake, or nefarious scheme.”
The shovel crunched into the dirt with resistance, pushing against knots of roots and scraping against stray pebbles. Harry braced his foot and pushed the shovel deeper into the ground before shifting his grip to lever it up and toss the dirt over his shoulder.
“I don’t care,” Draco snapped. “He has a reputation for being immature with his money and his sexual conquests and his attire. Yet, somehow, it’s a reputation that’s
“You love me?”
“Draco?” Harry said from behind him.
“And now you’ve gone and dragged me down with you.” Draco laughed.
What the Aurors did know about this entity was unpleasant at best: someone called the Collector had swept through the British Isles the last few months, vanishing people into thin air. Someone else would get a note, offering a choice — willingly trade their magic for the return of their loved one, hale and whole. Those who agreed were effectively rendered Squibs. Nothing, not a single trace of magic was left. Those who didn’t agree kept their magic, but their loved one was never seen again.
It was the first thing Harry had said in a while, interrupting the quiet of the grey. Draco debated not answering, but he had never once succeeded in denying Harry before now.
It was true. Of the four smugglers, only three were really fighting — the burly one quaked at the trembling turbulence of the plane, and stayed on his hands and knees during each shudder, cursing in what sounded like French. Draco had already secured the passengers, despite having never seen a Muggle plane before this morning, and Harry was pretty certain he knew where the contraband was stashed. This wasn’t even a fight, it was recreation.

dropped a glamour on a mission.”
“But I’m still confused, what does all that mean?”
Harry brushed his hair back and chewed on his lip. “I don’t remember anyone attacking me. I had dismissed class and was just cleaning up after the messy buggers when I picked up a project with a bunch of runes on it and blacked out.”
Draco grinned to himself thinking, maybe, just maybe this was going to be ok. Maybe something good was finally happening to him.
“Well, it’s not like I’ve spent my life thinking that you were my soulmate or even believing in the phenomenon, but now that it seems a fact, I guess it fits.”
“Yes, sir.” She blushed.
Then he carefully, strategically, ran his fingers along the nape of Harry’s neck, just under the hairline, saying, “Harry, can I borrow those Quidditch gloves of yours now? You said I could at breakfast, and never got around to giving them to me.”

possible long-term consequences of doing so.”
Harry clenched his jaw. Neither option was acceptable, so he didn’t have a choice but to find another way out. “What do you even do with all this magic, anyways? Keep it in boxes on a shelf somewhere?”
“You’re an idiot.” Harry grinned.
“What?” Harry said. He read it again, hoping that an extra pass will allow for a bit of extra understanding “Am I the father here? I don’t have a child named Albus. I don’t have
“I think we’ll need to do exactly that,” Draco said. “But I need a fresh read on your vitals, first. The last recorded set was looking fairly rough.” He set the monitoring spells to show an ongoing readout. “Please remain as motionless as you can. We can still talk, but try not to move around.”
booze, and he was not disappointed.
“You… what?” Harry asked, dazed, disoriented at how Malfoy’s tongue tipped back into his slit and curled around the head to tuck under — just a bit — the foreskin. “He threatened your mother? I thought…”
Draco knew exactly what had happened, and it wasn’t a curse at all.
Harry crouched down. “Should we pet it?”

“Harry,” Draco said softly. “You have a soul mark on your back.”
And it was
“I mean, I’d like to do all those things,” Harry said, then frowned at Draco’s stunned expression. “I can also… not do those things, if you’re not, er, interested.”
“Oh,” Harry said, softly. Then, “Here,” he reached into his robes and pulled out two shrunken brooms, and held one out to Draco. “I brought these, just in case. You can see North America over there. It shouldn’t be a long flight.”
Harry looked down at his food tray. Shepherd’s pie and pumpkin juice with treacle tart for dessert. It would have been appealing if he hadn’t had some variation of this dish for three days now.
Draco sighed. “We’re going.”
“All we know is that this beacon demands a specific consensual act to seal the bond,” Draco said, pinching his nose. “A kiss, or marriage, or magic-melding, or even sharing blood. Yet the maker apparently didn’t find the particulars important enough to be actually
“Go on.”
“You’re going to wait a while,” Harry said. “I don’t have a spouse, or parents, or children, or even a crup. No one will come.”
“Yes! In 500AD, Aryabhata theorized the use of differential magi-calculus in chaos theory to invert universal probabilities! In a closed system, highly improbable occurrences become more frequent, and things that are statistically likely become virtually impossible!
“Well, gentlemen! Looks like there’s not much more we can do for you here. Your bond is healthy and normal, there’s no reason to keep you. We’re going to discharge you.”
The was nothing else but the void, a stone-coloured emptiness with no echo, no hush. Then there was a sound: a rattle, a clatter. And up the path came a large die, rolling up with jaunty bounces before coming to rest gently against Draco’s knee, a shimmering incandescence blooming out from behind the sharp black dots on all sides.
“Hmm?” Harry said, half turning. Draco’s fingers always broke his concentration, but this time, the concentration broke just as Weasley’s card snapped a sharp numbing shock into Harry’s palm.
“Roll the die, please,” Draco said, tired.
Harry blinked. “You don’t want to go do our vacation after this?”

“Please, Malfoy,” Harry gasped. “Please,
“Bite your tongue Harry Malfoy-Potter.”
“Oh, really?” scoffed Potter, folding his arms and raising his eyebrows. “I’ll only believe that with evidence. One of these nights when we’re both here alone, you’re going to sing for me.”
“I really do,” Malfoy said softly, running his fingers over the words on the parchment. “I really do believe that somewhere out there is a version of us who had these two sons, and that these two sons needed us to do something so badly that they were willing to reach out across space and time to ask for it.”
It was easy to watch Draco. Everyone did. The
“Draco,” Harry said. “I haven’t even talked to Malcolm in years. We’re not —”
“Sorry, Minerva, I had to sick up behind the gargoyles,” he mumbled at the floor. “I Vanished it but I think some of the smell lingers.”
The air surged out of Harry chest and wisped away into wind roaring around them. The glowing adrenaline of being on top of the world with Draco by his side had seeped away. Harry had proposed and Draco hadn’t murdered him. But this wasn’t exactly better.
Harry stopped. “
“Your victory is only momentary,” the Collector said, even though their head was tilted very precisely in order to keep their horns from brushing the rowan berries. “Goodbye, meagre hero. I’ll have your magic before the moon sets.”
Fuck.
“Would you believe that it
“Roll the die, please!” Draco called.
It had been about two weeks since the Prophet had gotten word of Narcissa’s funeral, two weeks of owled condolences and awkward sympathies. There had been one letter, rejoicing at the death of a Death Eater, that had slipped into the school with the morning mail, and that had made Draco stiffen and tighten like a decaying rose before he stood up and left without a word.
“Yes,” Malfoy said. “It was. But not anymore. Now, we’re in the Delta quadrant, and your destiny is 70,000 lightyears aways. You don’t have to be everyone’s hero any more. Which is why you’re
“Quickly,” Harry said.
Let his family obligations wait another day. “Lead the way.”
Draco nodded, “I’ll just wrap up my cases.”
Malfoy waited, then said, “Officer Potter, will you let me suck your cock?”
“Not unless you want the entire conversation on the front page of the
“Honestly, Draco, I don’t go looking for trouble, trouble usually finds me.”
It had felt like the rumble of a pending avalanche, the way Malfoy pulled the tight black kisbet over the jutting bones of his hips while Harry tried to follow suit. It had felt like the gasp of a star collapsing into a black hole, the way Malfoy strode over to one of the tureens, picked one up, tilted it over his body, and let the oil slide along his sharp shoulders, his sternum, and down his shins to the soles of his feet. The oil pressed the kisbet even closer to Malfoy’s skin and glistened through the fine golden hairs that dusted his chest.
Harry swallowed his bite of treacle tart. “You passed out when examining me.”
the plane, where people belong!” Draco yelled over the French shouting. He stood like a matador, poised and powerful, snapping off countercurses while the wind in his hair made him look like a superhero. “
“Can I please have a new roll?
,” Harry had snapped and reached for the hem of his uniform shirt.
“Oh please, that's a silly muggle superstition, besides, have you forgotten? We’re already magically bonded. Unfortunately, I’m stuck with you whether I like it or not.”
Malfoy pressed his lips together and strode from the office door to Harry’s desk. He carefully placed the glasses and a note down in front of Harry.
And the orange tile disappeared beneath Harry’s feet completely, leaving only an empty grey void beneath him.
“The discomfort is your own making, little hero,” the Collector said. “Your position is not nearly as discommodious as that of all the others I borrow. And you well know the conditions of your release.” They walked to the edge of the ichor pool and pulled out a metal key from fathomless and luminous black robes. The key was laid on top of a small silver chest resting barely a breath away from the lapping, inky waters. “Take the key. Open the chest. Leave your magic. And you’ll be returned to your life, hale and whole.” Then they fluttered their fingers, too long, too white, and covered in a fine membrane of moss. “Or wait until someone comes for you and let them accept the exchange. Whichever you prefer.”
They spent their mornings dancing around each other in the bathroom while they took turns showering, following Hogwarts dorm etiquette and averting their gaze, though Harry’s eyes always drifted to the pale skin and toned muscles that peeked out from Draco’s towel. No matter how often he corrected himself and desperately tried to focus on his toothbrush, Harry found himself lingering on the sight of Draco’s collar bones.
Once he’d realized that his home would always be Hogwarts, more than anywhere else in Wizarding London, McGonagall had dropped some very strong hints that Harry would be welcome to take over the post for Defense instructor. Still, he liked being Groundskeeper more — he was always outside, he had his own small cottage separate from the castle’s shenanigans, and he never had to mark essays. Marking essays were all Neville and Draco seemed to complain about when Harry sat with them for dinner in the Great Hall.
“No, you wouldn’t. But now the hands are touching.”
“Did you get a pair?” Malfoy asked. “Or anything odd like this? Mine was in a green box with white trim, and sent directly to my office.”
Harry suddenly burst into the door, panting like he had frantically sprinted up the stairs himself. “Draco, no, wait! Don’t open the trunk! My gloves are on the bedside table, and there’s nothing…”
Draco yelled louder than Harry did, lunging as Harry scrabbled for a grip on the white tile past the chasm. The
Draco grabbed another book. “Foreign blond prince travelling as an ambassador to negotiate with an Alpha werewolf?”
“My place is a bit small, I know the house you’re talking about, it used to be my great aunt's. That sounds fine...” Draco said, looking away awkwardly.
And so Draco hands stretched out to catch him, his fingers brushing past Harry’s elbow in an attempt to steady him.
“Do you remember when we used to chase each other around Hogwarts?” Malfoy said, pulling from the end of Harry’s cock with a soft
“Yes, but it’s an odd thing,” Draco said. “This morning, your magical core was nearly wiped, your heart rate was dangerously low, and your serotonin and dopamine levels were essentially non-existent. But right now, everything seems to be… thriving.” He flipped through Harry’s file. “Even that massive bruise on your back seems to have healed.”
As he passed by them, his mother was fuming, her sense of decorum the only thing keeping her from causing a scene. But when he looked at his father, he was surprised to see what looked like respect in his eyes.

“Well, it’s hard
Draco frowned, and put down his quill. “We don’t
“Yeah. It was a really long flight up from the space I was on.” Harry paused, then reached out a hand. “Wanna ride on here with me? I think I can see the trophy on the final space, and it looks like the Portkey out of here. We can just swoop down and get it.”
“Good.”

“Magic is a delicacy,” they said. “I partake in my collection whenever the occasion calls for a delicacy. Or when humans have become tedious again and partaking is better than the Great Sleep.”
“I got us a reservation,” Harry said, a peace offering. “At that place in Montreal with that chef you like.”
“Oh, you mean other than the fact that he claims to be the best Chaser in the league, even though his left turns are always sloppy when he flies defence? Or how he practically salivates over you whenever he’s at your charity events?”
And then Malfoy found his prostate, and Harry cried out, shameless and loud. He watched as Malfoy pulled off, grinning viciously in triumph.
“This is why I didn’t want Fiji,” Draco said. “Or Paris or New York. They’re very public places to be seen with ‘interesting company’ like me.”
“I don’t think you need to worry about the attraction being one sided,” he said, brushing his lips against Harry’s, which sent sparks of pleasure along his spine.
“Draco,
we are, instead of what this place is
Draco watched him, staring at Harry like he was trying to stare through Harry, like he was finding a new face under the face Harry always had. Then he nodded, and took a deep breath. Carefully, he peeled off his outer robes, folding it and placing it on the windowsill. He pulled off his black tie, rolled up his black sleeves.
“They’re
“What happened?” he mumbled, rubbing at his eyes while slowly getting up in a sitting position.
“I think so, sir.”
point in the past.” He saw Draco’s pause, then groaned. “Son of a bitch, you’ve been telling me on Tuesdays.”
Harry frowned. “This is either a very clever and very dangerous trick, or the work of someone gone off the deep end.” Carefully, he reached for the glasses, peering at the strange metal frame. “I mean, it could also be real, but that’s a bit of a stretch. Still, we ought to figure out which it is.”
“And this one about the posh aristocrat trying to save his reputation with an arranged marriage to a commoner?”
When Ron and Hermione weren’t visiting, Ron with groceries and Hermione with rotating stacks of books about soul mates, Harry and Draco spent their days touring Grimmauld, Draco revealing secret nooks and passages that Harry never knew existed. They spent their afternoons in the kitchen, kicking out a disgruntled Kreacher so that Draco could learn to “cook Muggle”. They spent their nights carefully separated on the biggest bed in the place, talking to each other in the quiet and the dark.

Malfoy pressed into him, consumed him, worshipped him. Harry shivered, and moaned, and gasped.
But then he was gone, in a wisp of smoke, and all that was left was a metal key and a folded piece of paper. When Harry knelt down to grab it, he opened it to see the sharp black words:
Draco always turned them down, gently, politely, but they never had the right to ask. Not when Harry was right there. Even though Harry was always better at duels than spitting out what he actually felt.
, all donated with the intent of making Potter as comfortable as possible.
“Oh Mother,” he smiled sweetly. “I don’t think you need to worry about instructing me on decent and respectable. You and I have a very different opinion of what that means. But now that I’m no longer a child, I think I can find my own way. In fact with the Ministry restrictions placed upon father, I am effectively the head of this family, and I think it’s time we start doing things a little differently around here.”
“The curse got lifted,” Harry said, “Yesterday, while you were gone.”
“No, think about it, Harry, was your intent kindness or just a duty to do the right thing? At the time, you would have saved nearly anyone except Voldemort from that fire. Morally, you were incapable of leaving someone, even someone you hated to die. As soon as we were out, we parted still intent on hurting one another. But now, we’re friends, sort of."
When Harry raised an eyebrow, Draco shrugged. “It’s always a wise idea to be exceedingly polite to possibly sentient pocket dimensions.”
“It’s my parents,” he said softly. “Father has hired Cyril Celandine to break the bond one way or another, and they’ll both be here by noon.”
Draco frowned. “They do. But very rarely. It’s nearly statistically impossible.”
to pet any kneazles.”
Draco shook his head. “I need to get off this plane. Right now.”
Potter’s mouth let out something suspiciously close to a chortle. “Can you do better, then? Is carrying a tune one of those weird posh things they train you in, like with using too many different forks and flouncing down a marble staircase?”
Draco’s cold fingers were still around his wrist, jaw slacked, eyes wide. “You just proposed to me.”
“Hence my consternation upon receiving this,” Malfoy said. He waved at the glasses, and a standard display of diagnostic spells floated above them in precise, purple lettering. No warning flashes or traces of danger. “They’re not cursed. Not so much as a cleaning spell since the moment they were created.”
the first Healer they send to deal with me, whatever this is can’t be good.”
“Oh, I know,” Malfoy said. His face was sharp and his amusement was sharp, but the overall effect was disconcertingly soft. “I’m well aware that I’ll only ever be your First Officer in name only. I know that, more than anything, you’d rather have me on my knees than giving you orders.”
“Hey,” Harry said. “You don’t suppose this is some kind of trick, right? A whole path full of orange tiles.”
Draco sat two tiles away from the
“Already? My god, you’re insatiable.”
“What? No,” Harry snapped, suddenly flushed and wrong-footed. “No, I won’t,”
“I may be a genocidal Maquis, Potter,” Malfoy said, “but I’m still your commanding officer. If I really felt like aggravating you, I could ask Granger to put you on my personal security detail, and you’d have to follow me day and night. I might just do so anyways. It might help you learn to respect my authority.”

Harry woke up the first Wednesday after he was cursed to an owl tapping softly at the window with a note from Draco:
Draco frowned as he handed one of the remaining letters to Harry. “It’s from someone named Sam Jordan? She wants to meet you in person to talk about the questions she was asking in your Defense class. Did she fail an exam?”
“You mean, do I think we could have created a soul bond naturally, if we had not started as enemies?”
Draco pushed his chair back from his desk, feeling it bump into the door to his office. It was the smallest of all the offices given to the Auror trainees, only
Harry grinned. “I can cheer you on?”
As the ichor began to ooze off his shoulder and drip down past his ribs, Harry took his first deep breath in ages and beamed. His chest felt like bursting in the best possible way. “I’m great. I need a shower, and maybe some sleep, but I’m really, really great.”
“I can see it now,” Draco said. The corners of his mouth were twitching now, more upward than downward, and he didn’t even want to stop them. “The tales would spread far and wide. The Boy Who Lived To Wail Paperwork Into Submission.”

“Isn’t that a good thing?”

make the bargain.”
“Will you let me suck your cock?” Malfoy asked.
. Just a ‘sorry’ and a ‘don’t eat anything’.” He looked at Harry. “This is what you get for making the poor desk clerk choose our destination for us.”
“Harry,” Draco said, and it was the hardest thing
“Oh... how tragic for you. How ever do you survive such a horrendous burden!”
“Potter, you need to bloody stop that, or the grindylows are going to get ideas about mating season in here and start coming up the pipes,” Draco said.
The theories were, unsurprisingly, ridiculous: Draco was clearly holding Harry hostage in his own home. Or perhaps Harry needed a Black blood relative as a willing sacrifice to stop Wallaburga’s curse on wizardkind. Or maybe it was a conspiracy, involving frequent visits from both Hermione Granger and Ronald Weasley, to go back in time and stop the war before it began by using a former Death Eater’s insider knowledge.
Malfoy had put the tureen down and straightened.
But the real reason everyone watched him was because it was impossible to have Draco Malfoy walk by without watching him. He’d grown into his pointy nose and boney chin, and he somehow also got sharper cheekbones and fuller lips in the process. He walked like he was the ghost of the Queen of England: poised, elegant, dazzling — and yet still somehow ethereal and unreal. Harry had hoped that he’d gain some kind of immunity to the thrall of Draco Malfoy, standing by him so much every day, but he never ever did.
“Good,” Malfoy said and took Harry’s cock back into his mouth again. This time, Harry also felt the touch of Malfoy’s hands, one bracing against his hip bone, the other sliding along the curve of his arse, an echo of their earlier wrestling. Only this time, Harry wasn’t flinching away.

possible to use a Muggle analogy to describe magical things? You can do it and the world doesn’t even end, not a little bit.”
There were nearly a dozen of them, clearly worn, but carefully preserved. They were Muggle books, thick with pages but still small enough to be covertly tucked into a pocket. Carefully, gently, Draco picked one up, showing Harry the muscled, shirtless man on the cover, posing stoically on a ship while his hair lifted in the breeze. Draco read the title: “A Pirate’s Passionate Tempest?”
even without his wand, and so he shouted out their words even as the air was whipped out of his mouth. That done, he let Draco handle the rest as he worked his way up to a sitting position and just watched.

“Hmm...love?” Draco answered, engrossed in the pages in his hand.

Potter’s office was massive compared to Draco’s. It took two whole strides to get from the door to the desk,
And he said: “I received these this morning with a note written by a person apparently named ‘Albus Potter’.”
“It stopped being
Draco shook his head, pressing himself closer. “I want you, Harry. I’ve wanted you for as long as I can remember.”
And so Harry had to wait, rolling his eyes, while the requisition witch wrote down her Floo address on every one of Draco’s return slips.
Harry was in the middle of saying, “Hey, do you think that —” when there was a pop, and a bit of parchment fluttered into Draco’s hands.
After the initial shock had settled, Harry and Draco had agreed to go to Hogwarts to find out more about the bond and the effects on Harry’s magic before his parents and this… Bond Butcher they had hired arrived. Deciding that floo travel was too risky for the incomplete bond, they had Apparated together, Harry holding Draco’s arm with more force than was strictly necessary. Draco assumed it was because of his weakened magic.
“Wha…
Harry swallowed at the heat that burned under his skin. It started at his throat and fluttered past his constricted lungs, before drifting further, deeper down. He huffed and flicked his fingers in the tiny scrap of space between them. “

Draco reeled back. “
“No, sir.”
“The game didn’t warn us about those Pygmy Trolls, but did warn us about this.” Draco said. “It can’t be
when you punched me in the balls,” Harry snapped. He could stand now, but the throbbing pull of his groin meant he’d be unable to walk with any dignity for a long while yet. “Don’t even pretend to be surprised that it was against the rules.” He shifted enough to make it seem as if getting his back against the near wall was only happenstance. It wasn’t strategically sound, but it at least gave him fortification.
Across the Eighth Year common room, Ronald Weasley gave him the nod. He was distracting Harry with a new version of Exploding Snap from his brother’s shop, which slowly turned your fingers numb if you missed the cards.
“I don’t see them here is all.”
, and the two of them had been left staring each other down. There were no change rooms, no privacy screens, no convenient nooks. And no way to oil wrestle while still wearing Starfleet uniforms.
“The reports all mention it,” Draco pressed his lips together. “Let me do a manual check. Can you take off your shirt?”
“Right. Friends,” he said. “I’m sorry, I… I need a moment.”
“Or we would have finished off Voldemort by third year and finished our schooling in peace,” Harry said. He paused. “Would your mother still be trying to marry you off to Astoria if we had been bonded?”
Harry shrugged. “I listen.”
“As long as there’s consent, there’s no problem,” Draco said, cutting Hermione off. “And I’ll be happy to help you access all of your magic again. I mean, that’s what friends do, isn’t it?”
like that, glistening and pale, long lashes brushing the soft blush of his cheeks. He was sinful like that, a breath away from the fabric of Harry’s kisbet, chin tilted with a confidence that burned against the significance of the position he was in.
?” Harry said, contorting so quickly to see for himself that he nearly tipped off the bed.
Draco’s cheeks were pinked, and the fingers on Harry’s skin were freezing cold. Harry wanted to tell Draco how beautiful he was, but figured he should probably say something that didn’t show how obviously head over heels he was.
Harry stared at Draco. “You’re brilliant”
the trashy things that happen between your blond snobs and boorish commoners. Imagine the inspiration we’d have gotten!”
Draco looked up from Harry’s file. Antagonistic runes were practically the foundation of curse work. “The investigators found nothing like that around you. Do you remember what the project looked like?”
Malfoy had raised a brow. “Scared, Potter?”
“Draco?”
Draco sighed. “Between you and me? No, I have no idea. But if this works, we’re telling everyone I had absolute confidence.”
Draco’s head tilted up ever-so-slightly in interest. Jackpot.
happened without severe magical mutilation of both parties. There are even rumours that he used to set soul beacons as traps for Purebloods to get more business.”
“What is it?” Harry asked again, voice tinted with impatience.
“You’re not?” Harry asked incredulously.
“Healer Malfoy?” the intern poked her head into the break room. “Are you busy?”
And so he said, “A voice like yours could never stay a secret. Especially not if you keep planning on blasting it through these poor belaboured pipes.”
The ropes that lashed out around the Collector were like the ropes of a standard Incarcerous, but made of branches and and silver and bright red berries. They looked thin and fragile, yet the moment they wrapped around the Collector, their oddly-jointed limbs recoiled and thrashed, yanked into uncomfortable constraints. Harry sucked in a breath past the ichor in his throat and tried to smile. Of course Draco would find strange and rare spells for binding Fae-adjacent creatures.
The die wiggled and tipped over, so now that side pointing up showed One.
“Once they’ve met I hear that there is a magical bond that forms between them, is that true?” Diana had a moonstruck face as she perched her chin on her hands.
and excuses to not leave a bedroom for forty-eight hours.”
“It’s another dice!” Harry whooped.
“You’re not that mad,” Harry said. “You haven’t cast a single
silent. It had felt like roaring, the way neither of them looked away as they stripped off shirts, boots, socks. It had felt like the tuning of a symphony, the way Malfoy’s mercury grey eyes stared into his as they both undid their pants and let them drop to the floor. It had felt like the snap of an ion storm, the way they both pulled off the last of their clothes and stood in front of each other, bare and unyielding.
“How do soulmates identify each other if they do meet?” said Rosie.
He took half a step forward and threaded his freezing fingers through Harry’s. He was so pale that Harry could see faint blue veins near Draco’s knuckles, and feel the smoothness of his skin. Except for the side of his middle finger and the pad of his thumb — calluses from quills and wandwork. Harry knew they’d be there, even before Draco’s fingers touched his own, and Harry loved him so overwhelmingly much that he couldn’t breathe.
They both knew it wasn’t. The point had been for Harry to make clear that, as Security Officer, he wouldn’t let someone like Malfoy threaten his ship. The point was to make it clear to Malfoy that he would do whatever it’d take to protect his people. The
Once upon a time, when Harry was with Ginny and he thought that was what he wanted, there were always plans in the back of his mind for a spontaneous proposal. He’d ask her to marry him the way he defeated Voldemort: when the instinct felt right, or when he felt like he was dying.
From across the wing, Draco
“Harry, how gravely are you injured?” Draco asked, levitating him up and out of the ichor pool with the most tender and gentle spellwork that Harry had ever felt.
His eyes drifted to Draco a lot. Between the reporters and Hermione’s insistence on limiting any impact to an already volatile, beacon-forced bond, they were stuck at Grimmauld. It wasn’t like he could
And then Draco began to disappear.
land on the orange tile?”
What he would always remember, every single day of this possibly endless journey across the stars, was the way Malfoy’s hand felt as it slipped past the waistline of his kisbet and then down. How Malfoy’s fingers, slender and slick, skimmed past the curve of his arse and even further, pressing their bodies so close that Harry could place Malfoy’s every scar by touch alone.
“It’s a shortcut,” Draco said, stunned. “There are still about 80 or 90 tiles to go, but the end is in sight.”
And so Harry felt relief when he heard the crunch of shoes behind the crunch of the shovel, and Draco snap, “What the hell are you doing, Potter?”
“I dropped out to protect my mother,” Malfoy said softly. A quick suck at Harry’s cock again, and then: “I was worried Voldemort would kill her if I didn’t show how loyal I was. He did anyway, though.”
It didn’t matter that the closest Harry had ever come to an airport was a week abandoned at Mrs. Figgs’ when the Dursleys went to Bermuda. Or that the two of them marched right into unfamiliar,
Frowning, silent, Harry followed a few tiles behind.
It was a regulation move, what Malfoy did. But it made the breath in Harry’s lungs feel rampant, made the burn in his blood feel unchecked and egregious.
, letting your Commanding Officer suck your cock until you beg him to let you come.”
“What, like Arithmancy?”
“No,” Draco snapped, flinging his hands into the air. “I’m barely mad at you at all, and
“Draco, thank you,” Harry said. “I’m sorry, but thank you. If I could even stand up, I think I would kiss you right now.”
“No one else does!” Draco snapped. “Because people cross the street to avoid me! There’s a public list of shops that won’t sell to me! I’m a perfect secret fuck for you because the only job I can have is in my basement potions lab! You’re the person everyone talks about, but not the way they
Narcissa opened her mouth to reply, but Lucius put a hand on her arm to stop her.
Harry sighed, this topic came up in February every year like clockwork, it was just a matter of which lovestruck young witch brought it up first. Since there was no avoiding it, he decided he may as well answer. “Because Samantha, soulmates are from a much older time in wizarding history. Back then, people tended to live in very small communities and very seldom ventured more than three or four cities away from where they were born. It was much easier back then. These days, people tend to lead much more complicated lives and move around much more frequently. Also a marriage bond with one’s soulmate isn’t the only type of fulfilling and loving relationship. People don’t need the stars or fate to match them to a partner who will love them unconditionally throughout their lives. In fact, less than 5 percent of the population even finds their soulmate anymore, and, in those cases, it’s usually just a lucky accident.”
Harry shrugged. “I do what I can to keep up the reputation. Plus it wasn’t so much a decision as it was a way to stay sane.”
Harry swallowed. “Yes.”
“Also, I’ve read there are magical means of pulling or attracting your soulmate, is that true?” Sam seemed rather serious.
“Shut it, Malfoy,” Harry said, biting his lip to keep from smiling. “Did you want to see the memory or not?”
“It looks like a board game,” Harry said. “Y’know, like Monopoly, or Candyland.”
“What?” Harry said. “Do you mean Dumbledore?” He felt wrong footed, like Malfoy was talking about some important case that Harry had somehow missed a meeting about.
Waiting on the path was a black cube, squirming with excitement, flashing bright white dots on all sides.
gone. But in its place was the image of two hands, in greys and blacks and browns. They spanned Harry’s entire back, from shoulder to shoulder, reaching out for each other but not touching.
Harry held out an elbow and winked. “Shall we?”
Draco sighed, “I’ll be right there.”
When they settled from the dip of the tile, a blue light wobbled in front of them and formed into a small card.
In the Holodeck, Harry let the weight of his body slam the both of them into the mats. He took the force of the landing on his shoulder, twisting his head to the side to avoid a mouthful of white-blond hair. He yanked his arm so that the crook of his elbow pressed
“Do kneazles come in purple?” Harry asked. “Is this something I should know about?”
“Neville says he’ll help me keep them blooming all year, not just in spring.” Harry said. “So you’ll always see a bit of her when you’re teaching.”
Clutching the key tight in his hand, Harry closed his eyes to Apparate back to the Collector.
“Harry, you have a
“Two weeks ago he asked you
“I was wondering about something I read in the library about soulmates.”
“No one will come,” Harry wheezed, trying not to choke on the feeling of ichor spreading through his lungs.
, you idiot. I said I need to get off this plane. I think we need to get back on land, take
Malfoy pressed his lips together. “This is —Scorpius was the name we would have given our child, if Astoria had lived,” he said. “And the way he does his Y’s… they’re like mine. I think my mother would have taught him how to write like that.”
He couldn’t articulate why, but he knew, in the deepest core of his being, that this was the choice he would have always made. That realisation wasn’t enough to fracture Harry, but it still created fissures, too easy to crack when placed under pressure.
Draco knew what his mission was. It was dangerous, and might lead to something that couldn’t be unseen, but it had to be done.
Malfoy watched him. Harry could tell even with his eyes closed. He knew that Malfoy watched him process what this choice would mean, how this choice changed the very orbit the two of them had, circling around each other.
Then Malfoy stepped right into Harry’s space, close enough that Harry needed to tilt up to look him in the eye, and said, “you’ll need to work harder than that to get me at your mercy, Potter.” He gestured at the Regenerator in Harry’s hand. “Go on, there, don’t be shy. Heal yourself up. It’s nothing I’m not already familiar with. Remember, our wrestling arena hadn’t come with change rooms.”
And there, like a firecracker, like a shout, like a perfect spell in a duel beside his partner, the adrenaline came exploding back. “You love me?” Harry asked.
sense of romance,” Draco said and gave him a very aggressive kiss on the forehead. “I can’t believe I’m going to marry you.”
Harry watched as the frown minutely twitched into a smirk. Progress.
Draco took another drink.
“Harry,” Draco said, softly, sadly. “How could you keep this from me?”
He woke up in his flat, on the couch that was actually more comfortable than his bed. He tried to sit up, groaned, and saw Draco poke his head into the room.
“Thank you, Minerva,” Harry mumbled. “And does the bond—?” He turned to Hermione, avoiding eye contact with Draco. “Will the bond be affected if the attraction is only one sided?”
You were trapped in an incomplete bond. A sort of magical feedback loop where your body only knew it was bonded but had nothing to attach to, so you had the symptoms of a newly bonded wizard separated from his mate. Without me to complete it, you likely would have gotten weaker and weaker until you died.” Draco shuddered.
“It sounds a bit like you care a lot.”
Harry didn’t even notice Draco stroll off with the key, and Draco forced himself to keep that slow, strolling pace until he turned the corner at the bottom of the stairs. Then, it was a sprint, up fifteen stairs to the landing, across to the second door on the left. The moment he closed the door behind him, Draco stilled, staring down the innocuous trunk that held Harry Potter’s secret.
to keep his expression neutral. “This is a book about a green-eyed pirate stealing away a pale blond noble.”
“What is it?” Harry asked, his voice vibrating pleasantly through Draco’s body.
It was Draco who explicitly told Harry that baiting the Collector would be the most imbecillic decision of his soon-to-be-shortened career.
She kept her quill down, “why are you asking?”
two chapter in one day!!!
Draco took one last look at his apartment and Harry casted a spell to remove every trace that Draco was ever here. When Draco joined him, Harry held his hand out, “your phone”. Draco handed him his phone with a confused look. Harry took the phone and broke it. They took the emergency exit out.
He roamed around her office like a toddler, touching everything and nothing. There was a muggle photograph of Ron and Hermione at her desk and one of all three of them from Hogwarts. His brain lit up like a bulb.
“care to tell me what is going on Harry, team is getting suspicious” she asked as soon as she picked up. He knows he should tell him. But someone inside must have told Jace of his location. “I can’t right now, but you just have to trust me. I’ll tell you everything soon. Did you find out how Jace got inside the ministry?”.
“Later, we don’t have time right now, I need you to pack a bag and take only necessary things”, said Harry already walking towards the closet. “What, what do you mean. Harry Potter I’m not going anywhere until you tell me what the hell is going on!!” he said standing his ground.
“Draco!” he turned around to see Pansy Parkinson standing a few compartments behind him. He stopped abruptly. She came crashing down on him and eloped him in a hug with such force that he had to take a few steps backward, barely saving them from the fall.
Malfoy looked at him a bit surprised and angered, “I’m not doing anything illegal Potter, you can check whatever you want, I know you’re an auror” said Draco barely controlling himself to not shout at the man. Of course, why else would Harry potter, the savior of the world wants to do anything with Draco Malfoy, an ex-death eater?
Alice looked at him like he grew a second head for a minute, “what! you sent me an emergency Patronus because you couldn’t decide what to wear!?” she said with an unbelievably irritated expression.
When he reached the restaurant, he saw Malfoy standing out waiting for Harry. Harry was relieved to see the blonde was safe. He stopped in front of Malfoy and gave him the helmet. “get on, we need somewhere private to talk” without missing a beat Draco said, “we can go to my place, it’s only 10mins from here”
Draco got on his back and folded his legs in a criss-cross position, and hesitantly put his hand on Harry’s back. He could feel the hard muscles underneath along with the warmth his body offered.
Hermione
“when Kingsley brought the case, he had no idea where you were. He also acted differently. Now I know why” said Harry putting on his boots. “so, you’re saying what, Kingsley is involved in this?”
Draco gripped Jace’s hand tightly and long white veins of magic was being transferred from Jace to Draco. He got up on his feet still gripping Jace’s hand. Every on the room was trained on Draco and his was set on the prey in front of him. His eyes were so focused that the grey iris was almost like glowing
Harry was so close to burning up his entire wardrobe. He couldn’t find anything to wear and even when he did choose a shirt, he couldn’t find matching pants. It was almost 12PM and he was freaking out like Ron on the day of the Yule ball. Defeatedly, he sent a Patronus to Alice screaming it's an emergency.
Harry was well trained to perform under pressure but this...this was like Hogwarts over again, lives of people he cares about in danger. He took a deep breath trying to calm his growing anxiety.
It was the perfect opportunity, as Auror Potter, the Head of the Auror Department, and Minister Draco the Head of international relationship, were to invited the ball to Gujarat, India, along with other few members of the department.
“I promised Draco I would protect him no matter what” he said feeling the weight of everything that has happened. He had no idea if Draco was in there or not. He had no idea whom to trust. Alice was like a sister to her. She reminded him so much of Tonks that he couldn’t believe she would do this to him even in his wildest dreams
“send me your location, I’m coming to get you. I’ll tell you everything just do what I say.” Said Harry already taking out his bike and putting on his helmet. His phone pinged and the location was not that far from where he was.
Every time on Regulus’s or Sirius’s birthday they would  do something  to honor their memory. His first year in the house, on Sirius’s birthday  he took his motorcycle  out for a ride, since then he’d been enchanted by it.
Harry wrapped a hand around his waist and pulled him closer so now Draco was sitting fully on Harry’s lap with both hands on his torso, “you can sit here anytime you want darling, and it’s Harry”. Feeling Harry’s hot breath so close to his neck Draco went completely still for a moment.
“I’m always up for something illegal I can’t get the record without a warrant but you're lucky the guard Larry owes me a favour” she winked at him and went out. Fighting with Bane to have Alice on his team was so much worth it.
(See the end of the chapter for
He was making Jace feel the pain he gave other. The pain of all the innocent lives he and his sister took. The pain of the people in their lives. Every single ounce of pain.
“I’ll write to you mother.” he picked up his trunk. Before entering the train, he turned around and waved Narcissa goodbye before finally letting the worry show on his face. He ignored the pestering eyes and walked through the train to look for an empty compartment.
“how do you know, somethings will shock you. I was choosen” said Draco showing his dark mark. Harry remembers clearly that Draco did not kill dumbledore. He couldn’t.
“why are you doing this?” he asked Alice as she was cuffing him to the poll. “you’re too naïve Harry. I joined the task force to get justice. Instead all I got is a team of gutless aurors, who instead of throwing death-eaters in jail, was giving them a second chance!” she said with hatred evident on her face. Harry cursed himself for not seeing it earlier. He knew Alice struggled with her emotions. Maybe he could have helped her.
“what, I wasn’t following you, I never followed you”. He said in between his breaths.
Harry ignored Draco’s confused looks and walked towards the window to make sure he wasn’t followed here either. He saw the same guy from Knockturn alley and hurridly turned towards Draco.
They had somewhat of an awkward friendship. Passing each other soft smiles as they walked past each other in Ministry. Looking for each other at ministry balls, even though they don’t talk much but still keeping an eye on each other from afar.
That turned Malfoy’s stunned face into a confused expression. He squints his eyes, “you, who dreaded going to the library during Hogwarts, just happen to waltz in here looking for books”. Quick, not smart.
Draco felt little butterflies in his stomach, who thought after 5 years of war he’ll be texting with Harry freaking Potter… who happens to use emoticons. He laughed to himself and texted back
Listening to her shouts Harry ran to his living room and saw Alice ready to shoot any threats with her wand. Which was rather ridiculous seeing her appearance was not at all threatening. “I need help deciding what to wear?” said Harry.
“the place doesn’t seem to be guarded” said Mo. They both made their way up the stairs. Harry banged on her door. He could feel there are no protective wards or any kind of security. It was like the place was deserted. When no one answered they sneaked inside through the window.
Name: Draco Lucius Malfoy
They had successfully transferred both Alice and Jace to Azkaban. Kingsley was still in recovery, but he was out of danger thanks to Hermione. They managed to save Billie as well who was currently in the St.Mungus.
It was no secret that Harry was pansexual. The world went upside down when Harry came out as a part of the LGBT community but the noise died down.
He wondered if it’s the right kinda pic that should be sent to your ex-rival. He stared at the screen waiting for Harry’s reply, biting his lip in anticipation.
Harry tugged Draco more strongly against him that it pushed the air out of Draco’s lung in a gasp. He used the opportunity to explore the inside of his mouth with his tongue. He sucked on Draco’s tongue which made him moan in his mouth.
“I thought this would go along with your plans for tonight,” said Hermione in his ear. Her smartness never ceases to amaze him. He surged with excitement that he forgot about his empty stomach.
Draco looked back and saw Harry was just walking right behind, apparently checking out his ass. He hooked his fingers in his pants and pulled them a little up in an act to adjust them a bit, or really just highlight his ass more.
Harry crouched down on his heels and spoke softly “How about you make me some in his memory today, we can eat together before i leave for work".
Lucius was in Azkaban, he frequently sent letters as they were not allowed visitation rights.
Love, Harry.
Later that night.
“Give me five minutes and I’ll be with you" she said getting back to her papers.
“I’ll manage with the rest, you go help them” he said walking towards the room still under the cloak. He knew Cassie will be alright as the people who entered were none other than Mo and Billie to creating a distraction.
____________________________________________
Alice looked at him like she couldn’t believe this was happening, but fuck it, she’s a Slytherin and Slytherins always help a friend in need. She took a deep breath, “okay”
Seeing his reaction Harry backed off a foot and ducked his head in embarrassment,
Draco nodded. He hugged Harry tight, “promise me if things went sideways, you will kill me”. Harry tried pushing him away, “Draco what?”
Harry screams loudly
“you know married people do this right” Harry pointed it out.
“it’s okay, I’ll have a coffee, black please”, said harry and the waitress turned towards Malfoy. “I’ll have a Cinnamon Roll Frappuccino Blended Coffee, extra sugar”, ordered Malfoy. His cheeks still burning red from the waitress’s prior assumption.
“Actually, we need to protect him.” said Billie. Everyone looked at her confusingly. He knows his team isn’t biased to ex-death eaters. Each of them had one thing in common, that is someone close to them was on the wrong side of the war.
Please  leave  a comment, l would love to interact with you guys.❤
Draco looked at him, “Harry” he said in a whisper. “yeah It’s me”. After making sure he was focused on Him, Harry wrapped his arm around Draco and picked him up. If he was someplace safe, he won’t even let Draco walk, he’ll be giving him all the care in the world a person needs after an episode but right now they needed to hurry.
please leave a comment.
Harry had no answer to why he was here that would seem appropriate for the situation, but thank merlin his brain was quick to come up with something. “ I was just passing by, and thought to stop by”.
“I think there is a way we can find him before” said Beatrice. “your blood bond, you said earlier that you dreamt of how Malfoy like you were in his body” she clarified, “yeah, that was when I was in deep sleep. I don’t even have control over it”.
After a few moments of trying, Harry woke with up a hard gasp. This dream was even worse than the other he encountered. And also, different. Like he was in someone else’s body, who was being shot with the crucio again and again by Voldemort.
A woman opened the door. her hair was grey and short. She looked old but her body was still lean and muscular. “hello Harry” she said coming out to hug Harry. Harry let go of his hand and hugged her back, “it’s so good to see you Beatrice”.
“we know who’s controlling the Minister” said Harry. “Jamie stay here and find out every information you can about her. I can’t fucking believe she played us right under our noses.
Alice, bless her heart, didn’t ask anymore questions.
Harry stopped him at one of the photos Jamie was going through, “that boy” he said. He had a mark on his neck that Harry would never forget. It was the same mark he saw on Jace’s neck. “Joel Lunox, they’re twins”, said Jamie looking back at Harry.
Pansy was talking with Luna and Hermione. Ron and Blaise were having a drunk Wizard chess game and even drunk Ron was good. Neville and Ginny were dozed off on the floor and beside them, Cedric was talking to Cho.
He changed to a black see through night shirt and white shorts. He took the phone and clicked a mirror selfie and sent it to Harry with a caption, “can’t wait to see you again”.
Harry was also wearing traditional Indian attire. A maroon red Kurta to match with black tight pajama and a scarf. His hair was a mess as always. His aura demanded respect in every room he walked not because he defeated Voldemort but because of who he is, which was just the perfect contrast as he walked towards Draco with a smile so bright it could outshine the sun itself.
Harry made his way to room where Malfoy was sleeping and quietly kept the tray of food beside the bed. For minute he just beside Draco watching him. He looked much younger sleeping. If he wasn’t already in love with him, he definitely is now.
It didn’t look small to Draco, “we need to stop, you’re bleeding. You need to cast some healing spells now”. He said checking the wound. “I will, we’re almost there”.
_______________________________________________
He casted a revelio on the walls to look for any spells protecting the building. “I can’t see anyone inside. We need to get to the basement” whispered Billie. “we can’t just walk in.  The place has got alarming charms on every door to window.” He waved his wand towards the building which created a light yellow centric circled indicating the charm.
“We’re here if you want any help". He looked at her.
“you alright” he stepped back a little. Still not removing his hands. Draco let his hands fall to his side but not pushing away.
____________________________________________
"but please make sure it’s not a strip club". She gasped but the corners of her mouth twisted up a bit, “ONE TIME James Potter, that happened one time", they both laughed at memory of Ron's face when he saw girls dancing half naked on table tops.
“give me 5mins I’ll be downstairs”. Ron nodded his head.
_____________________________________
“I’m here now, with you. I’m more than fine Harry” said Draco and kissed Harry’s scar on his head. Harry laid them down on the bed and turned to his side to look at Draco. After few moments of just looking at each other, Draco asked, “why are there people after me though?”.
She ignorned Jamie’s comment, “the person being controlled doesn’t even realize it.” Harry looked at the photos and saw images of Bellatrix. In one image she looked like a perfect Black. White crisp dress robes, not a single hair out of place. In the second image she looked different. Maybe it was the way she was sitting or her clothes that were all black but still held a lady like posture. With every image, he saw how she changed completely to the Bellatrix he remembered, slowly slipping into insanity. A completely different person.
“I always come prepared for anything Harry” she said and took out a clear liquid vial. “this, will create a temporary break through the spell”
Harry stood in front of the mirror with his hands on the counter and looked at himself, he looked at his hair, long enough to cover the scar on his forehead. He's not depressed anymore but he longs for the feeling of fulfillment. He sighed and walked inside the shower cubical. He didn't even wait for the water to get hot and stood under it, his thoughts went back to Malfoy,  to how he used to stare at him through the dining hall, his face, he was so beautiful, long lashes falling on high cheeks. Harry' cock stirs in interest.
“oh", even after being the head auror he couldn’t tell it was a same expandable charm he used on his bike. He’ll never get used to magic.
Type: pureblood, stripped of magic
Harry’s whole aura changed. Sure, he fooled around office and have lazy days, but when it’s work, he was nothing but professionalism. The rest of the team joined soon.
When they got back to the hotel, Harry accompanied him to his room to drop the stuff off.
Draco caressed Harry’s cheek, “I think I have a thing for falling into your arms like this.”. Harry gave him a full tooth smile through his watery eyes, “I’ll always be here to catch you my love”
“merlin mate can’t you dream about unicorns and rainbows for once” asked Ron caressing his head and back. Harry let out a light chuckle, “I know how to find him” he said letting go of him.
“where is he? Where did your psycho brother took him?” he growled again bending to face her. “you can torture me all you want, you’ll never find him” she said gritting her teeth. “tell me where your brother took him and I might just save you from dementors kiss” he tried to reason with her again.
Before he could say anything her phone rand. Harry took out her phone from her pocket and saw it was Jace. He went outside ignoring the threats Alice threw his way. Kingsley was again unconscious.
They bought some souvenirs. Harry followed him like a puppy from shop to shop, taking every bag Draco purchased. Draco was enjoying it so much that he might have bought a few extra things that he absolutely didn’t need just to make Harry work a little longer.
comments are really appreciated!!
Later that day when he got home, he took out his phone and stared at Potter’s number. He was distracted throughout his evening that he was serving wrong orders most of the time. Thankfully, the owner liked him enough to let it go for one day. He took his shoes off and changed into knicker shorts and a loose shirt that reached his thy and flopped down on his bed.
comment are very appreciated. Thank you for reading.
“You looking for someone in particular?”
Harry hid behind a bookshelf to not startle him. He noticed Malfoy had grown his hair long and was tied in a messy bun. And merlin did he look so damn adorable in his white oversized sweater which made him look so tiny, and those black leggings were made in hell he was sure.
"Thanks for the juice, I forgot you were gonna visit" she finished her juice in one go.
“meet me at the balcony after the ball Harry” he stood on his tippy toes and leaned in to plant a soft kiss on Potter’s cheek, carefully to keep his hands at a distance, and then walked into his room.
_________________________________________________________
“you already lost this Jace. No matter what happens today, the words gonna get out about Kingsley”, he said, his patience running thin. “not yet, you forget that I have a bigger leverage here than you. Go ahead kill her. I lived through the deaths of so many like you. I know I can survive hers but can you survive his?”
quill from her hand.
He accepted his desire for Potter when he moved to London and found himself thinking about Harry much more often than he’d like to admit. Soon he realized he actually missed Harry.
“okay” proceeded Cedric like Malfoy had fallen right in his trap, “Sit on Harry’s lap for the rest of the train ride”
“Or not if you think this was just a one-time thing” Harry pulled back his hands with a little disappointment.
“you’re the only person who ever made me feel normal and special at the same time. You’re the only person with whom i can just be, just Harry. May it be fighting over petty things in school or laughing like a hippo at a date. Having you here in my arms right now makes me feel like whatever I've been through in my life was worth it” which made Draco smiled through the tears. To Harry, Draco has never looked more beautiful.
"I gotta go i promised Mark i would be home early". Alice picked her stuff in a hurry
Malfoy looked like he could be anywhere but between the two men “yeah uh right, Potter this Is Jake, he’s my...” Malfoy paused before adding “boyfriend, he’s my boyfriend”.
Harry looked up from where his eyes were on the ground and saw Malfoy’s eyes were wide as humanly possible. “or lunch, breakfast, or even a coffee would do” he added a bit panicky.
Draco raised his hand and held Jace by the head. As soon as Draco’s hand touched Jace he started Screaming. Loud shrieks of pain were heard throughout the Chapel. It wasn’t physical pain. Harry could feel what he was doing to Jace.
Draco clutched his hand tightly and Harry kept his hand on Draco’s waste for safety measures, yup that’s it. No other intentions. And with a loud bang silenced by a silencio Harry apparated them both to the safe house.
In his attempt to get to Malfoy he didn’t even look at the book he picked, which was 50 shades of grey by E.L James. A very erotic romance novel because the universe just hates him that way. Harry hasn’t read the books but he watched the movie.
He still couldn’t believe that he was sitting in a compartment full of people who would have cursed him dead a few months ago. But it wasn’t that bad. No one bothered him about not playing. Now and then, Luna would ask if wanted more beer or anything. He’ll decline her with a little smile.
They all set to do their assigned tasks. He was walking past the desk when he caught the glimpse of something on Alice’s desk. It was an old photograph of her class group. But instead of Dumstrang she was in Hogwarts uniform. Harry checked the year and saw she passed out 4 years before Harry.
After some time the laughter died down everyone went back to doing what they were. He relaxed back into Harry who was caressing his arms and hands. He was warm and comfortable. He looked around and after a very long time, he found himself at peace.
Few moments later he held Draco’s chin to look up at him, “I’ll never let anyone hurt you ever again. I promise you Draco Malfoy” harry said leaving no space for doubt.
They were walking towards a nice two-story suburban house. He could see the lights coming from the inside. Harry walked towards the door his hand never left Draco’s since the apparition. He knocked.
Being the head of department of magical creatures is no walk in a park. She raised the petition for free wolfsbane solutions to werewolves and also free treatment of the newly bitten.
"Flowers!" Harry and Hermione both tuned towards Ron
With the corner of his eye, he saw Cedric move away from Harry and wrap his hands around Cho who kissed him in return. When Cedric looked back at him and let out a laugh knowing Draco understood what he did. Draco blushed furiously.
After they came down from their another laughing fit, Harry looked at him with so much adoration in his eyes, Draco looked back at him with the same intensity. Harry looked at Draco almost like breathing him in, his hair glowed golden in the yellow dim light of the restaurant, how he missed those beautiful stormy eyes. Draco licked his lips and Harry’s eyes followed the movement, then Draco moved his eyes down with the cutest blush Harry has ever seen.
Kreacher bowed his head, instead of just leaving he sat on the small chair in Harry’s room. Every time Harry had an episode that was worse than usual, he would just sit there in silence with Harry until Harry went back to sleep or left for the gym.
Draco doesn’t know if it’s the voice or being called baby that made him suck harder and nod. Harry got back to leaving marks on his neck and rolling his hips in rhythm along with it.
Harry was fuming with Anger by the time they reached their place, “this is all my fault” he whispered to himself. They were standing in front of her house looking for any sign of threats. “she played all of us Harry, don’t blame yourself” said Mo offering a comforting hand on his shoulder.
Draco knew those green weren’t lying to him, he breathed deeply, “fine, I’ll go to dinner with you, for now, I have to get to work”, he saw how Potter’s face lit up like a Christmas tree, his eyes were even greener when he’s smiling.
“I need to buy something from the trolly” he hurriedly excused himself out of the compartment. He closed the door behind him and started walking mindlessly in one direction.
Cedric looked at him and nodded in appreciation, Draco smiled and nodded back. The year ahead still seemed scary. But with a certain raven-haired boy, he couldn’t help but be excited about it.
“not willingly. Look, don’t leave the house. Don’t open the doors for anyone other than me or Beatrice. If someone else comes go to the floo and get to grimmauld palace” he said, more like ordered. “I need to get to the ministry”. He walked towards Draco and kissed him quick and then apparated away.
Harry did dream about Malfoy that night, but it wasn’t a nightmare. He dreamt about the time when Harry justified in favour of Malfoy at his trail. How had Malfoy looked up at him when Harry arrived in the court, shocked, scared and a little hopeful, he looked so fragile, like porcelain doll. All Harry wanted to do was hug him tight and never let go. 8 years of rivalry melted away from that one look. He would have hugged him and never let go if he knew that was the last time he was seeing him. Until tomorrow.
He got off the bed and went into his study, his team followed him inside. He pushed everything off the table and unfolded a map of London. “I saw a road sign that said ledbudy road, launderette. Jace must have took him nearby this road.”
He followed his routine, went to the gym, worked out, took a quick shower. Kreacher was standing in front of the black family tapestry when he came down. Harry stopped in his footsteps and quitely leaned on the entrance door frame.
He rubbed the spot increasing the speed while he thought about Harry fucking him hard and rough into the mattress, claiming his mouth all while his cock slammed his spot again and again. I’m about to cum harry, more.
The man was still lying unconscious on the ground. He sat down in front of Draco, “ you’re okay Draco, you’re safe” he said trying to get him back to him. “you’re with me, the man can’t hurt you anymore. I’m here darling, come back to me” he said softly
“but I never created a bond like that with him, I don’t even know how to make a blood bond” he said getting more frustrated. He did some healing charm on his wounds but it still hurts.
Harry’s mind supplied with a little anger
Harry set the plate aside and moved to sit beside Draco. Draco hid his face in his neck and breathed Harry’s scent to calm himself.
“well we need to make sure which stage he’s at and collect evidence” said Harry. “I don’t know about the last two stages, if we’re lucky we won’t need to” said Billie.
When Hermione came to through the floo with Ron, they both eloped Harry into a tight hug, “we’re really sorry for you mate” said Ron, “we’ll try to help you as best as we can” finished Hermione.
he saw he bodies of his friends and family lying around. He walked ahead a few dead bodies and saw one of them was of Ron’s.
Draco took out a bag from under his bed and started packing. He went into the bathroom to pack the essential, “alright, I’m ready”.
“what kind of dreams?” she asked. “nightmares about him, but lately I’ve been having nightmares about someone who’s being tortured. It’s like I’m in their body but I can’t figure out who it is.” He explained.
“maybe you did, you just didn’t realize it, till he got in danger. I think him and the man in your other dreams are two different people. Talk to him about it will you.” she said drinking from her cup. After that they sat in silence. After Beatrice left the ministry she came to her hometown. She was rich enough to last generations but she lived for simple pleasures.
He used the opportunity to explore Draco’s mouth with his tongue. Draco brought his hands up to Harry’s neck and hair. They were softer than he had imagined. He pulled his leg up to pull Harry closer by the waist.
"filthy redhead" Kreacher muttered under his breath and went to do his daily chores.
Everybody went silent. Draco was turning red by the seconds. He was mortified and confused. Harry sat a little straight. “it’s just a stupid dare Draco, get it over with so we can move on with the game” said Pansy.
He never dreamt of Malfoy even once. Maybe because he often thought about Malfoy when he’s awake that his subconscious decided to give him a break during the night, until now. The same dream in three nights, he couldn't even write him a letter since no one knows where he is. It's been 5 years after the war and no one has seen him, the daily prophet wrote articles about him in the beginning, but soon left it alone.
Harry answered without stopping. “there’s someone out there who followed me till here. I need to get you some place safe.” he said as he put out a few pair of clothes on the bed. “what, why me, I haven’t done anything since the war, I don’t even have magic anymore for fuck sakes” he said angrily.
“Draco c’mon join the game. It’s stupid but fun!” exclaimed Pansy. Draco looked around the room full of people telling him to join. And one of them, in particular, looked at him like in a challenge “scared Draco” said Harry with a smirk.
“Wh… what? Why?” Harry Potter stuttering, what would the Ministry say if they saw their precious savior like this. Draco smiled at that thought.
Harry thought.
he chanted trying to get out of his own head
“do you miss living in the muggle world?” he asked in return. Harry thought about that for a minute, he never talked much about that part of his life even with Ron and Hermione. “my experience in the muggle world wasn’t good, the people who I lived with loathed me for who I am. Magic and all, they hate wizards”. Draco looked up at him, “living with people with so much evil and hatred in their hearts is hard”.
he chided himself.
He watched carefully how he stood on his tippy toes to keep the books. How the few strands of his hair decorated his face. His face, he looked nothing like the Draco how he remembered but exactly like it all together. Maybe if they weren’t so focused on fighting, he would have noticed that Malfoy has light little freckles around his nose that only added to his beauty.
Kingsley closed his eyes and began to scream. Harry immediately casted a maffliato. Beatrice moved beside, “untie him, get him on the couch” as soon as Kingsley was untied he started having a seizure. “ what is happening to him?” he demanded.
“Harry, Kingsley’s up” said Cassie. He glared at Alice, “think about it, for as far as I can see. You already lost”. He walked in the room saw Kingsley demanding to be cut loose. “Harry what is going on” he pestered.
They got judging looks from other people but they didn’t care. It was like the two kids who were robbed of their young life become teenagers again. He laughed with Ron and Hermione sure but with Draco It was different, and he knew Draco felt it with how relaxed his posture looked and how his legs would hit Harry’s now and then.
“Yeah, why’d you ask?” Draco answered. Harry caressed his nape in nervousness. Draco loved seeing him like this, the man can get the hardest criminal masterminds to open their mouth but in front of Draco, he was a nervous wreck.
“you just have to sit on my back Draco, don’t worry I won’t let you fall,” Harry said looking straight into Draco’s eyes. Draco gulped down and Harry’s eyes followed the movement of his throat.
“okay It wasn’t like you were any better”. Suddenly Draco felt a pang of guilt on his heart and he looked down.
The conversation between the guys inside. He was filled with disgust and anger making it hard for him control his magic. There were at least six or seven guys inside. Harry knew he can’t walk in there, if he was alone he would have done that like yesterday. But he couldn’t let Draco hurt anymore when he’s already bled so much creating the blood trail.
Harry’s hand dropped down to his ass and squeezed hard which made Draco moan in his mouth.
_______________________________
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck and asked, “were the dreams really that bad?”. Harry took Draco’s hand in his and kissed his knuckles. “yes, I was killing me not knowing how you were. And I felt it, I think, like I was you in few of those dreams. Like I was in your body, I felt how much pain you were in.” he said holding both Draco’s face with his other hand. He wanted to talk to him about the blood bond but figured now isn’t the right time.
There was a rattle, and the die tipped and bounced around them, over and under the tiled path and back again. When it stopped, only the upward-facing side lit up: Four.
come.
“Right,” said Weasley. “About that. Are you willing to wreck your Quidditch gloves?”
“I can try to be more boring if you’d like.”
“Let’s just finish this and leave,” Draco said, sharp. He waved away the green and black fireflies floating around him. “We’ll get back to the Ministry, mollify Shippertonsmith, and get back to our lives.”
“Don’t you even dare try,” Draco said, though there was a soft flush filling his cheeks. “You’re still disgusting, and I would never get that muck out of my robes.”
“I’m not sure yet,” Harry said. “It’s just, how close are those odds to the odds of a purple kneazle being born? Or a Pygmy troll? Or this two-headed peacock? They’re all possible, but really improbable, right? And yet we keep running into them.”
Draco wanted to stop. He
die. Do not.”
Draco suddenly spun around on his heel, overwhelmed with the desperate need to face away from Harry, and Harry’s grin, and the hole that nearly stole Harry away.
an exquisite francophone, yes. Quebecois French uses more dialectical Anglicanisms, though, even without the Acadian influences.”
“But wait a minute...I pulled you from the fiendfyre. Wouldn’t that have activated it?”
“Yes, Sam?”
“Wait,” Draco ran his fingers up Harry’s jaw, pulling him around for a kiss. He meant for it to be deep and dirty, but it was somehow still chaste for all its aggressiveness. “Do
“Do they always land?” Draco demanded. “Every single time?”
It was a little less nice when the plane hiccuped and Harry stumbled and the stiff tug of a body-bind wrapped around his muscles before he got his balance back. Harry grunted as his shoulder landed on the wing of the plane and he slid a bit before the sticking spell snagged him. The smuggler had her wand on him, chanting, but the plane bucked again and she went down hard on her rump — the sharp green light of her spell shooting up, instead of at Harry’s prone body.
“Harry,” he said. “I appreciate that you’re alive and I respect that you’re probably incredibly uncomfortable right now, but if you do that again, I will
“Yes, sir,” Harry said, and there was no hesitation in him, anywhere at all.
jellyfish. This stupid thing is taking forever —
Draco instantly stood up. “I did indeed.” He forcefully vanished the crumpled letter
They moved on to the first tile after the “Start”, a bright yellow one which bobbed under their feet but steadied enough for them to move to the next one. They hopped over the third tile, orange, in unison before landing on the vivid green fourth tile.
dropping from Malfoy’s mouth. But it was too late. Malfoy had seen, and those lips had tilted upward in a pleasantly surprised and calculating smile.
“Hey, it’s the song Hufflepuffs have to sing to get into their dorms!” Harry said.
He picked up the sieve from the thali, looked to the moon through it, and then faced it towards Harry to secure its blessings.
, harry mentally slapped himself.
Harry worked out in the gym till he tired himself to the bone. He found the pain in his muscles a good distraction from his thoughts. He went to take a shower in his bedroom, he had two hours before he needs to leave for the ministry. Kingsley gave him the job of the auror the minute he completed his 8th year. He still decided to go through the basic training. Ron changed his thoughts about being an auror after the war, It's good Harry thought. Now Ron worked at the shop with George, the business is going so well that the Weasley's don't have to worry about the money like they used to.
Malfoy stared at him approaching and sat a little straighter. “Can I join? he asked with a smile, he hoped he looked confident despite being shit scared. Malfoy nodded his head, “it's a free country” he said, gesturing towards the opposite empty chair.
“be careful Harry, if you let go of either any one of your anchors, you can get lost in your own head forever” she warned him. At this point Harry was ready to drink poison if it meant he could save Malfoy. He emptied the bottle in one go and laid down on the bed. Ron sat beside him holding his hand.
When Alice returned, she closed the door of Harry’s office and took out a book size of a coin from her pocket and kept it in front of Harry. Harry raised an eye towards her silently asking for explanation.
The bottle ends on Harry and Neville. “Alright, Harry, truth or Dare” slurred a more than a little tipsy Neville.
“I have some plans,” he said softly. Hermione sighed to herself as she watched the little scene unfold.
The only reason why he agreed to go on a second date with Jake was that he looked a little like Potter. Hell, all his one-night stands have been with raven-haired men.
“I’m sorry for this, but you are under the control of the medallion you brought us as a case” he said. “Bullshit, I’m the minister. You think I wouldn’t know if someone tried to take control over me” he replied angrily.
“ready” they all say in unison.
He ran up the stairs. Draco’s wand shot up to him with a wide expression. There was clear fear in his eyes. “Draco” said Harry as calmly as possible. Draco eyes shot up when he heard Harry call him by his name.
“of course, not every godfather gets their godson a copy of an erotica romance novel for their 5th birthday," he said with a grimace but Malfoy laughed and Harry thought It’s not that bad being an idiot if it makes him laugh.
sleeping curse. “we haven’t hurt your pretty boy yet, but we will.” Said Jace stroking his hand through Draco’s hair.
please leave a comment.
He quickly purchased the book, eyes trained on the blonde the entire time. He walked out of the bookstore and towards Malfoy.
With a confused look on her face she asked, “why do you wanna know?”.
The man entered and looked in both direction. Harry took the opening and they both had a duel in the middle of the corridor. Harry threw a stunning spell towards the man which made him fell on the ground. Before he walked towards him threw an expeliarmus and took his wand away.
he raised his wand and pointed it towards Draco. “oh I see” says Jace taking in the scene before him. “do it, Harry. Be the saviour, do what you need to do” he challenged.
It was so awkward that Harry could practically taste it on his tongue. Malfoy schooled his expression into a straight face and said, “well, you can look around, I’ll be by the reception” and with that, he walked away as fast as he could.
The angle was just right for both of their dicks as the next roll made Draco moan louder again, this time Harry kissed him to shut him up.
"Wait... The Draco Malfoy. I thought he was dead." Alice was unusually surprised.
Malfoy turned around, taking the AirPods out of his ears. He stared wide-eyed at Harry and backed away in what little space was left between him and the bookshelf.
“Careful there, mate,” said Ron. “yeah,” Harry said his cheeks turned red.
“Just come on you, high posh git”. Draco flinched a bit when Ron reached for his trunk and took it to the compartment. “Careful with that, it costs more than your entire family’s salary weasel.” Old habits die hard. To his amazement, Ron only laughed and proceeded to carry the trunk instead of dragging it.
Draco put down his sandwich and with a scowl, “I know about it”. He gathered his courage to look at Harry. “The…voldemort” he again took a deep breath. The name still made him feel could. “ he gave my father that cursed object to control some of the death eaters who didn’t wanted to submit. Someone like me”. He dared himself to look at Harry. his eyes were filled with tears.
Draco started walking toward the restaurant when he felt a hand on his wrists, “look, it’s not like that, I can assure you. I know we have a history together, but I want us to have a new start. All I’m asking for is one gathering with you, you can decide the place if that makes you feel safer”, he looked straight into his eyes.
They still had to deal with the press conferences and everything but he couldn’t worry about it now, not with Draco lying so peacefully by his side, away from all the troubles.
Halfway to the staircase, he heard someone loudly bang open the gate they came through. “run” he shouted as Draco and they both ran down the stairs. The man threw a few stinging spells which Harry blocked.
Harry tripped over his own foot and he looked up to Draco laughing at him.
“Dare,” said Malfoy hating the feeling of vulnerability.
Harry smiled and said proudly "Kreacher made pancakes".
The ball was going to be held at a sanctuary to keep it enclosed from the muggles. Arrangements were made for them to stay there as well. The ball was on the same night as the festival.
He hugged her and pecked her on the cheek. They have never been this affectionate towards each other, but after Lucius being away and the house arrest, they opened up to each other.
His thoughts came to a stop when he saw Draco walking to him. Harry’s heart skipped a beat when he saw Draco had a soft smile on his face directed towards him.
death eater to deal with.
When they both returned to the compartment Harry pulled him back on his lap. “looks like you two had your fun” commented Ron.
“Fuck it,” said Harry and crashed their lips together in a hard kiss. Draco kissed back with equal enthusiasm. Harry was overwhelmed with the sensations. He was drowning in Draco's smell, he smelled like vanilla and god damn he tasted almost angelic mixed with the taste of beer on his lips.
It was Hermione-fucking-Granger. “oh hey, aren’t you two coming inside”. It’s like they have completely forgotten the past 7 years.
“we can’t just let the minister roam free and wait for him to reach the last few stages”, everybody turned towards Jamie.
"What, makes sense. Gender fluid or not, a guy like Malfoy would probably swoon over flowers"
Harry’s hands were just inches away from it. Ron decided to be the clown of the group which made Harry laugh so hard his whole body shook along with Draco. His hand accidentally fell on Draco’s pants. Draco bit his lip tightly to not make a noise.
Alice had her wand pressed under Mo’s chin threateningly. The lights came on and he saw Jace standing beside unconscious Draco. Draco was floating in the air, no doubt under a
He went to his office and delivered the extra lemon cakes to Hermione’s office. He waited for Alice to come to ask her about his last night query. She reminded Harry of Tonks. Alice wasn’t a metamorphamugus but she dyed her hair different color every month, this month it was baby blue.
“yes, I’m pretty sure. I don’t know why but he was the first one to see that I deserve a new start. He actually convinced me to see a muggle mind healer of some sort. Why what is it?” asked Draco concerned. Harry hurriedly got off the bed. “what where are you going?” asked Draco sitting up too.
He saw him two days ago at the burrow but he's always happy to see Ron. Ron and Hermione understood that Harry needs physical contact to reassure him he’s there, after all they all went to the PTSD together Merlin knows the Dursley’s never even touched Harry.
“I can’t you look so beautiful like this,” Harry replied. He circled the thali in front of Harry’s face the agarbatti was already lit, its rosy scent only added to their environment. He prayed to every deity who would listen to him to wish all the happiness in the world to Harry along with a long and prosperous life.
To say he was nervous would be an understatement. In the gist of getting to see Malfoy, he completely forgot what he’s actually going to say to him. After half an hour of playing dress-up with Alice— and another 15mins of her encouraging him— while she did her hair for her date, he was finally feeling confident in what he was wearing, a black t-shirt with white stripes and white pants and a blue jacket to finish the look, and his hair was a lost cause so he didn’t even bother.
"hey mate", Harry got up to hug his friend.
Can’t wait. Tomorrow, lunch at 2pm at your suggested restaurant, see you there.
"you love me" Ron retorted back. Some things never change and he's glad.
He realised he would not be able to get Draco out of here without getting hurt. He guided Mafloy to take the door to the next approaching floor. When they entered, he hid behind the cut and waited for that man to enter.
Now that he was laying in the comfort of his bed, he could let his thoughts run free. He thought about how his hands held him tightly in place. He reached a hand down and palmed himself through the damp fabric and squeezed. He gasped as he felt his own hardness up and down slowly.
“Does he know what’s happening to him?” he asked and tied up Alice beside him. “We haven’t got a chance to talk to him yet.” Said Billie. “Jamie filled us in on her” she continued pointing towards Alice.
Hermione said without looking up, “yeah, Arthur made a strong case on how wizard jobs are not enough for the youth and we need more jobs, Kingsley supported it”.
Billie pushed him out of the way and begin casting healing charms to help him. Harry ran towards the room, eyes filled with anger and pointed his wand at Alice, “tell me what is happening to Kingsley or swear to merlin I will forget every empathy I ever held for you”
Once the guards were on the ground, he picked Malfoy up and started walking towards the same way he came in. when he reached the ladder, he carefully put Draco down. The movement made Draco open his eyes.
The waitress came around with their orders. Harry paid for both, he drowned his coffee in large gulps and he took Malfoy’s drink and thought
_________________________
“Should’ve asked you before all that but I never did follow the rules.” Draco threw his head back and laughed so hard.
A lot of wizards and witches took up muggle education and muggle jobs, even from pureblood families, but Malfoy’s name was nowhere to be found. It's been 2 hours looking for his name.
In all his years of existence, he never thought Hermione Granger, the girl who got tortured right in front of his eyes, would ask him to join their little group. He wanted to say something, anything. A simple sorry would do, but it seems she adopted her boyfriend’s patience. “just get in here!”
“shit, I didn’t mean it in that way,” said Harry hurriedly trying to console the blonde. “it’s okay potter, we all made mistakes, some more than others, I’m assuming there’s a reason why you’ve run all the way here to stop me?”
Malfoy had a bewildered look on his face. “um Jake”. “Yeah hey, are we still on for the brunch?”. Harry looked at the man interacting with the blonde and a sudden roar of jealousy rose in his gut. he might have puffed out his chest a bit, unconsciously of course.
Pictures of Draco and the whole Malfoy family, along with people who were Voldemort followers, decorated the wall, some who were dead were crossed in red. He walked over to the picture of Narcissa Malfoy. He had heard when he was training that she died of heart attack but there was no solid proof. Eventually the aurors let it go thinking it was on less
Love, Ron and Hermione.
Jace fell to the ground and crawled away from Draco holding his head. Looking at distance like he was living through the pain all over again and again. slowly going insane.
“no trouble.”
“great, we’re abducting the minister of Magic”, clarified Jamie. Other thing they all had in common, their love for reckless adventures that could probably end their lives. Harry couldn’t be more proud.
Nothing that Harry said made Malfoy come out of his shocked zone. “what.. what are you doing here Potter?”.
Within a minute Alice apparated to Grimmauld Palace in bright pink bathroom robes with something green on her face and her hair chapped with the hair dye Harry gave her, “what?! what happened, Harry where are you?!!?".
he imagined Harry would say. And with a hand last few rubs of his fingers and strokes of his hand he came so hard shooting white ropes of cum all over his hand and belly.
Harry reached behind Malfoy and caught the book before it could hurt him and placed it where the blond was trying to reach.
The day was going surprisingly well with only exciting promises ahead, he was going to see Malfoy today, hopefully.
Draco looked down at his drink and thought maybe something is wrong with this beer or maybe this all is just a complete big hoax. But the way Harry kept glancing at him, told him that maybe he was just simply trying to move on from the past, starting by fixing up a stupid school rivalry.
“whoever might be controlling Kinglsley would need the blood of the Malfoy heir, squib or not, to get to the third stage. Complete change of mindset, Ideologies. One day he supports equality for all creatures, the next he could order genocide for every werewolf. Keep him where he is. Don’t tell us or anyone about it” she finished.
With a sudden wave of confidence, he said, “oh, I’m fasting for you?” he kept his tone nonchalant. Harry who mostly avoided looking Draco in the eyes, abruptly looked at him and stared before he could get his brain to function again.

“don’t you understand I have to do this, I have to” said Draco. Hands shaking for what he was about to do. He looked around looking for Snape to come. Any moment now.

“Oh, hey Malfoy,” said Ron testing the grounds. Draco could not believe the situation he was in. “I guess you can join us too”. He opened his mouth to speak, but nothing came out.

“I couldn’t. They wanted me to. But I knew I just couldn’t” said Draco looking down at his feet. Harry lifted his chin with his fingers to look him in the eyes, “I know, I was there. I saw you”.
He put his hand on the wall beside the door and focudes his magic through silent spells to listen inside. “that potter get everything” Harry heard a man say,“the golden boy my ass, gets everything. Even this beauty right here” he heard another. “we all know he’s keeping Malfoy around to warm his bed. Let Jace deal with him. Then you can have all the fun you want with this scum of a death eater said another and all laughed
