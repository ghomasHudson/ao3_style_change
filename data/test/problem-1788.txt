“This table alright?” Malfoy asked in a dull tone, not looking at Harry. This struck Harry as quite odd; since when did Malfoy need Harry’s approval for anything?
things about him and yet never pushed him to tell her more than he was comfortable with. There was Theo, with whom he had entrusted the knowledge of his apprenticeship, someone who perhaps didn’t talk as much as the girls, but always had a smile for Draco. Daphne and Blaise were far friendlier to him this year as well, now that he wasn’t as atrocious a bully as he had always been.
Potter cast, quietly, and the two of them waited with baited breath. A moment passed and nothing happened.
It hadn’t gone exactly as he’d hoped, perhaps, but it had been a lot better than he had feared. He felt a strange sense of excitement inside of him, as if seeing Draco and exchanging awkward small talk over tea had been some sort of thrilling adventure.
“Great minds think alike, huh?” Harry said, placing the jar down and watching as Draco carefully extracted two seeds to add to the potion.
“I cannot believe that you walked into the Ministry Atrium with a nine-foot long viper draped over your shoulders,” Potter said, for the umpteenth time, chuckling before taking a long gulp from his pint.
It had felt like everything went Potter’s way; everyone wanted to be his friend, Dumbledore favoured him, all the teachers adored him—with the notable exception of Severus Snape—and he seemed to get away with all of his rule-breaking, for he always had the convenient excuse of some necessary heroic deed he had had to perform.
It felt far more disorienting than all the times Hermione had done it, probably because he had never stayed in his Animagus form longer than a few hours. He felt weighed down to the table, his body heavy and bulky. He blinked several times, his hands coming up automatically to adjust his glasses, and he patted himself down his torso until he felt his wand in his pocket. He often wondered what happened to his body and clothes and such when he was in his Animagus form. Hermione said it was similar to Vanishing objects and re-Conjuring them. His head hurt slightly, probably due to his brain being confined in the small body of a crow for so long, and he had a dull sort of ache in his left arm, a similar sort of ache to what he had been feeling in his left wing the last two days.
Nevertheless, being witness to Potter’s attitude but not being on the receiving end of it filled Draco with a wicked joy. Like the time that Potter had been arguing with Officer Hitchens from the Magical Law Enforcement Squad about how they had snatched a case from the Aurors in a shifty way, going behind their backs to the Department heads and insisting it was in their wheelhouse and that the Aurors weren’t needed to investigate it. It was all politics, Draco had said to Potter, since the case involved a high-profile victim (“four time cover star of Witch Weekly,” Draco had said, quickly following it up with, “Pansy told me,”) and the M.L.E.S. was angling for more recognition, thanks to how the sacrifices and success of the Aurors during the war had made them far more popular among the public. Members of the M.L.E.S. were often bitter about it, feeling like they were trapped in the Aurors’ shadow, and it led to rivalry between the two sub-departments.
If it were two years ago, Draco would’ve been scared—not that he’d have admitted it. He was a right coward back then.
. He was slowly realising that he had no interest in girls and much preferred boys, but he refused to acknowledge that his hatred of Potter had anything at all to do with that, even though the back of his brain kept pushing that conclusion at him. He hated how anxious he felt about the third task, how anxious he felt about Potter, and he hated Potter even more for giving him that feeling. When Potter had returned, crying and bleeding and clutching Diggory’s lifeless body, Draco had felt a sharp, twisting pain in his gut, followed by a horrific sense of relief that accompanied the realisation that it wasn’t
He had sat down with a cup of tea after his somewhat explosive resignation in an attempt to calm himself down. If anything, this dreaded time loop was showing him how pathetic his life had become. He tried not to worry about waking up the next morning jobless, but by avoiding that particular train of thought, his brain inevitably landed back on Potter’s face, on that amused expression. What was so
Potter’s eyes were enormous as he stared at him. Draco stopped mid-rant, his breathing heavy and his heart racing.
After he and Dean parted ways, Draco Apparated home to rest for a bit before he was due at the Manor. He had promised his mother he would go there for dinner tonight, though he wasn’t feeling entirely up to it. He thought he’d much rather wait for Elpis at home and just be lazy on the sofa, but he knew better than to go back on his word with Narcissa. If he tried to say he wasn’t feeling well, she’d be at his house in minutes and have Polkey prepare him a soup.
to talk about Nathaniel with Pansy, was completely gone. What a ridiculous thought that had been. He drained his wine glass.
Scooping out about half a handful of Floo powder from the bowl on the mantelpiece, he stepped into his fireplace, said, “the Greenhouse,” in a clear tone, and dropped the powder into the fire.
They never had a real conversation about the years of enmity they had shared. Draco never found a good opportunity to apologise. Their short, pithy conversations they had at work were definitely not the right time. It wasn’t exactly like they were friends, but Draco still delighted every time Potter wandered over to his neck of the woods and struck up a conversation.
Harry snorted. He recalled having almost the same exact thought on his twenty-first birthday, when Hermione had first explained to him what was going on.
Draco waited, wanted the moment to stretch out as long as possible, until Potter looked like he was seriously straining to keep from moving.
“Nah, I don’t think he will,” came Ron’s voice, bringing Harry back to the present. “His mum’s on house arrest and Lucius is in Azkaban, he’s got to be there to take care of her.”
He wanted to think that Potter had something to do with his invitation, but Potter had been surprised when Draco told him he was coming. He was a terrible liar too, so Draco knew the shock had been genuine.
Harry groaned, and allowed Hermione to quickly catch Ron up on the awkward meeting Harry had had with Draco at the Velvet Tearoom. All things considered, it had actually gone better than he had expected, but he couldn’t help but feel embarrassed about it. He had barely said anything, and clearly Draco had felt uncomfortable being there.
“Fine, take a loop or two off and go get drunk or whatever you want to do. But you cannot let this keep going on.”
Draco froze in his seat, and it took all of his effort to force himself to remain in his body. He tried to focus, on the hard wood of the chair, on the solid stone under his feet, on the sharp pain in his palm from where his nails were digging into his skin.
“I…yes, I would love to,” he started, and Ollivander seemed to sense that there was more coming, so he waited as Draco pondered how best to continue. Finally, he decided simple honesty would be the best course of action, as Ollivander had never been anything but kind and accommodating.
Potter cut him off at once, his green eyes shining in the sun and Draco had a momentary lapse in which he couldn’t decide whether it was intimidating or magnificent.
“Alright, this is going to sting a little bit, but I have to clean the wound. Who knows what Aquila had her talons in before you?”
rather beautiful after all. “Another symbol of remembrance of the dead. Celebration of the dead.” At the look on Potter’s face, he hastened to clarify, “No, no, not a celebration of their
Ginny was still looking at Harry, though, and he knew that this wouldn’t be the last he would hear from her about this, so he made a mental note of adding talking about the Malfoys to the list of conversations he was avoiding having with her.
“Draco, I know it’s no excuse, but I didn’t know what that spell did, I’m so sorry, and I never even asked you if it scarred or if you were okay or…”
Draco had had the chance to do something good, and characteristically, he had failed to do so. He saw absolutely no reason why Ollivander would want anything to do with him.
“I’s abou’ ‘Arry’s saviour complex,” said Ron, through a full mouth of roast chicken. Hermione looked at him, too surprised by his words to show any sign of disgust at his eating habits.
“Oh, good. I never wanted to say anything because she was your friend, but she was a desperately unpleasant person.”
Granger’s head shot up and she cast wild brown eyes at him. The intensity in them was so strong, Draco almost took a step backwards.
Curiously, Harry continued scanning the board. He saw some familiar names in the column of mentors, namely Tiberius Ogden—who had been in the Wizengamot—and Gwenog Jones, former captain of the Holyhead Harpies. Dean Thomas and Alice Runcorn were the names in her row, and Harry was definitely going to ask Dean more about that later.
He whirled around to find Professor McGonagall looking at him from behind her rectangular glasses, her lips pursed and her eyebrows raised.
Harry looked around the classroom. It wasn’t nearly as occupied as Transfiguration, but there was a decent smattering of people, more than there had been in his sixth year Potions class.
“Only teasing, Jones. Besides, you know I didn’t ask for that. It was a group effort, it always is.”
At the mention of breakfast, Ron was instantly agreeable, and the two boys turned to Hermione for her approval. Her stern posture dissipated.
“I’m trying to figure out what’s wrong with you,” Violet responded, her eyes still drilling into Draco.
Harry laughed, loudly and genuinely, and watched in delight as it triggered a little smile to appear on Malfoy’s face.
Potter mumbled something that sounded like, “I know, I know,” and ambled off to the ingredient storage. Meanwhile, Draco went to back of the classroom to trade the pewter cauldron for one of solid gold.
“D’you think I could manage a wandless one?” Harry asked, the excitement causing his heartrate to pick up.
“You are referring to the Oath of the Sacred Twenty-Eight, I presume?” Draco asked. He was certain that she was, however there were a not-insignificant amount of magical oaths purebloods were historically rather fond of.
“It was very nice of you to speak at their trial, Harry,” said Hermione, clearly trying to cheer Harry up. Her efforts didn’t go a long way, as Ginny’s head snapped in his direction.
Furiously, Draco looked at Potter. He wasn’t exactly sure why, but wasn’t Potter the one always going on about the war being over and the fighting being behind them? He found himself angered even further when he saw Potter was simply gazing out the window, as if blind to what was occurring right in front of him.
“You know,” Bill started, in a much quieter voice than he had spoken in before. “When we got married, during the war…I know some people thought it was crazy, or bad timing. But we thought, this world may be full of hatred, but it’s full of love as well. And I think maybe things balance out like that sometimes. The other day, we read in the papers about Ollivander’s death. And here we are, celebrating a new life. It just makes me think…life is unpredictable, and we never know how much time we have left. I’m grateful that I’m spending this time here, with you all.”
Sirius leaned in and lowered his voice so only Draco could hear. “Molly hasn’t been quite as steady after losing Fred in the war, and when we found out about Charlie’s accident today, we were really worried how she would be able to handle it. She was a right wreck on our way over here, but finding out that Charlie has someone he loves, someone who saved him from a literal dragon? Well, I think it saved her, too.”
me!” Because hearing Potter call him Draco made him think of that night, made him relive the tenderness, the sweet caresses, the feigned affection. “You said we’d be friends. You said I’d have a brilliant time. Guess what? You were wrong! You’re a fucking liar, and I hate you so much I can’t even…”
Draco smirked and tightened his grip on Harry’s hip. “Don’t worry,” he said, wiggling his eyebrows, “this Santa quite likes naughty.”
“You’ve said that before.” And yes, he sounded like a petulant child, but no, he couldn’t care less.
And how could any of that ever hold a candle to Harry? Harry, who he’d been in love with once before, whose reappearance in Draco’s life had reintroduced a spark that he hadn’t even noticed was missing. Harry, with his glass-blowing and his family man’s heart. Harry and his green eyes, his kind voice, and his knowing smile.
“Hi,” Harry murmured, ignoring the roughness in Draco’s voice and the tremble of anticipation it sent down his spine. “I thought you were—”
A shiver of anticipation ran down his spine when Draco lifted his hand, gently nudging Harry’s chin up with the knuckle of his bent index finger, forcing Harry to meet his gaze as he whispered, “What makes you think I can?”
The dog licked his wrist and looked up into Draco’s eyes. It almost felt like it was trying to assure Draco everything would all be okay.
“Who are you?” Draco whispered, still addressing the opposite wall, still clutching Fayette tight against his chest. “Do I know you?”
“Draco!” Slyvia, his upstairs neighbour, called as soon as he opened the door. She swooped into the flat, swaying her hips dramatically with each step, shamelessly trying to draw his attention. Her vintage, hounds-tooth printed cocktail dress, complete with crinoline to poof out the skirt was a perfect compliment to her dark-blonde, Marilyn Monroe-style curls that bounced with each step she took. Draco stifled a groan.
.” Draco swallowed, feeling his eyes burning. “I’m so bloody tired of being alone, Charlie. And here you are, surrounded by a family who loves you and is willing to accept me too, just because a Mediwitch mistakenly believed we were engaged.”
“See?” Draco murmured as his finger brushed over Harry’s prostate, making him yowl. “So good. So fucking perfect.”
Draco paused in front of the tapestry, cocking his ear to gauge the situation in the corridor outside. The Dark Lord had finally stopped talking, and from the sound of it, people had stopped fighting. For now. Where explosions and curses and heart-wrenching wails of pain and grief had resounded only moments earlier, Draco was now only able to pick up soft, sob-laced murmurs and the dull shuffle of leather soles against stone. People were moving, and if Draco’s ears didn’t deceive him completely, they were all headed towards the Entrance Hall.
“And now this. I didn’t mean to mislead your family, just… When Hannah said I was your fiancé, and everyone looked so shocked… I’m not sure why, really. I mean, I’m rich and good looking, why shouldn’t you want to be with me? But then I realised they actually believed it and things just snowballed so quickly. Your brothers were hurling questions at me, and Ginny looked ready to hex me if I upset your parents — I’ve been on the end of her bat bogey hex before and do not want to be there again — and then Sirius told me about your mother, and Hermione looked ready to drop her baby any second, and I just couldn’t do it. They all looked so hopeful and happy.”
Don’t be ridiculous! No one’s avoiding me because of you. As I said, everyone’s just busy, and I’m positive Ron’s the only one still taking his time getting used to the idea. Even Luna and Dean — who I thought would find it extra weird, considering they were once imprisoned in your manor’s cellar — have given me their blessing, so could you please shrug off that ill-fitting insecurity cloak now? It doesn’t suit you in the least, and I’d happily take your insufferable, sassy wit over it anytime. (And knowing how irritating I’ve always found that particular side of you, that’s really saying something.)
?" Harry turns, grinning. "You seem awfully concerned about…my snake." Harry drops his voice low on the final two words, emphasising the innuendo.
The silence stretches between them, a charged tension humming in the air, travelling over Harry’s skin, making his every hair stand on end.
Harry sighs, leaning forward to set his mug down on the coffee table before he accidentally spills its content in his lap. “It doesn’t matter, okay?” he says, slumping back against the cushion.”It’s not mutual, so—”
Merlin, the way his voice quavered, Draco was almost tempted to believe Harry was just as affected by all this as he was. He swallowed, but his reply still came out all weak and gravelly as it tumbled out of his mouth.
Draco kept his eyes locked on Harry’s the whole time, only closing them occasionally when Harry’s touches and needy sounds became too much for him to process without coming. Harry revelled in the beauty of them, the warm bluish-grey framing dark glittering pupils, enlargened by desire and softened by emotion.
"...and no house-elves," Harry added, laughing. Their attempts at the Manor had proven to be just as unsuccessful. He was pretty sure Narcissa was sending her house-elf Penny to spy on them and interrupt at inopportune moments. No elf could have that lousy timing on their own.
“Draco, please, I’ll…” Harry writhed under him, babbling incoherently as he reached for Draco’s head, running his fingers through long, blond tresses that had long ago escaped the once neat bun at the nape of Draco’s neck. “Fuck, Draco,” he whined, grabbing handfuls of hair and tugging, coaxing. “Come here. Please, I need…”
Honestly, I’m not sure I even want to know just how poorly that letter was written, and I do admit I’m quite relieved to not be able to give it a second look. From your reply, I can only imagine what it must have read like, so do feel free to cast an Incendio on it whenever you get the chance, okay?
"I love you," Harry says quietly, and the truth of the words fills the room like Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.
Can you believe it? Our two houses sharing a table at the Three Broomsticks? If you weren’t stuck in that place, you might even have sat there with us, all haughty sneers and witty retorts. With that in mind, is it so hard to imagine that I sometimes expect you to show up as if you were just back from the loos? Or returning from the stacks with a book or two when we’re all at work in the library?
"No Weasleys…" Draco said, no doubt thinking about the times he'd tried to slip into Harry's room at the Burrow so they could have some privacy. They had not been successful.
Draco hasn’t spoken to his parents since. Hell, he hasn’t even mentioned them once. As if they didn’t exist. As if their absence from his life doesn’t bother him at all.
At the very least, Harry figured he should give dating another try. He hadn’t been on a date in like… five months? Or was it six already? Harry had no idea. He didn’t particularly like dating, especially when set up with random strangers by his well-meaning friends, but he’d do it, he promised himself. Anything to take his mind off Draco.
“No, no, I’ll be fine, and Harry will be along tomorrow to give me a hand running it all. Usually, it’d be Ron, but with Hermione…”
PPS Did you know they mentioned your transfer on the wireless on New Year’s Day? And during prime time too. Just keep up the good work and you’ll be a celebrity in no time.
Draco merely had time to register Potter’s lips on his before the kiss turned from sensation to memory. A barely-there brush of
“Excuse me,” a scowling man demanded, nearly knocking Teddy to the ground in his haste. “Excu— Oh, Mr Potter, sir. I’m sorry, I didn’t see you there.” The scowl morphed into a fawning smile so quickly Harry wanted to scream. Not that he didn’t think a sincere apology had been warranted, it most definitely had, rather because Harry was once again reminded that, most likely, the only reason he even received one was his unwanted celebrity status. “Have a good day, Mr Potter, and Happy Holi—”
The uncharacteristic praise makes Harry’s throat ache, delight bubbling under the surface but kept at bay by an instant rush of guilt. Because he’s not
father’s name. Yes, he was a half-blood, believe it or not — which is probably why you haven’t found him in your precious pure-blood listings.
“Hi. I’m Harry Potter.” Draco couldn’t help smiling at that, at the offer to start over with the man he’d always wanted to be his friend. His skin tingled as he grabbed Harry’s outstretched hand with his own, squeezing it gently. “And you’re Draco Malfoy, Charlie’s fiancé. It’s nice to meet you.”
Harry tried to engage in conversation with the other adults around him, but his mind was elsewhere. Mrs Finch-Fletchley, who was just in front of them — Harry couldn’t for the life of him remember her first name — told him all there was to know about her family’s holiday plans, her husband’s promotion, and something about a mischievous crup that had…? Harry had no clue. All he could do was nod along and try to hum in the right places. However, no matter how much Harry tried not to, his gaze kept drifting back to Draco over and over again. And the worst part; he was pretty sure Draco had noticed.
He was so good at this, urging people to improve themselves by opening their minds to things they hadn’t previously considered. And if they opened their purses to charity at the same time? Well, that was the entire point of the evening, wasn’t it? That was why Pansy needed him.
Draco wondered if he should mention the amount of work he was putting into the project, but he let it go. He really didn’t want to sound like he was boasting. Instead, he quietly followed Harry into the Floo and stepped through, emerging into the Reserve’s reception area, darkened and abandoned for the evening.
For some reason, everyone seemed to think this hilarious, and all I could think was, ‘If they only knew. Surely, they wouldn’t laugh then.’ Which was when I changed my mind about telling them that day, deciding instead to try and slip out unnoticed when the time came to meet up with the owl around the block or something — because, yes, apparently I was about to chicken out again. (Some Gryffindor I am, right?)
“I sure hope not.” Harry chuckled as he rolled over on his side and propped himself up on his elbow to meet Draco’s eyes. “You see, I have plans for you, Draco Malfoy,” he drawled, his free hand stroking leisurely up Draco’s thigh, “and all of them require you being alive.”
Orion lets out a hiss of irritation and Harry just knows that if he could, Orion would currently be treating him to an epic eye roll.
“And you think I haven’t? Godric, Draco, I’d forgotten how stubborn you are. I almost combusted waiting for you to give in.”
Draco lets out a long, satisfied hum that travels through Harry's body like the tremors of an impending earthquake, quickening Harry's pulse. The accompanying smirk is almost too much.
“Because this is all kinds of strange, don’t you think? That Charlie’s unconscious, that he’s suddenly engaged to Draco Malfoy without any one of us having heard a word about it?”
Draco scanned the room. From what he could discern, he assumed the only people who hadn’t been at the hospital were spouses and children. “Uh, not everyone. Only the ones from the other day. Oh, and Joh— Angelina, right? She’s married to George now, isn’t she?”
“Of course.” Harry’s voice reached him from the open doorway to the right through which he’d disappeared a moment before. “Haven’t you?”
His eyes are so dark, barely a sliver of grey framing the black pools of longing and desire, and Harry has to avert his gaze to keep from initiating another desperate kiss. In search of distraction, his attention is drawn to a small mark about the size of a Galleon that he, oddly enough, hasn’t noticed on Draco’s collarbone before. Squinting in the dim light, Harry takes a step closer.
She threw her head back in laughter, accentuating her slender neck and exposed Adam’s apple. She really was beautiful. Her stunning, teal blue evening dress, covered in sequins for the night, clung to her body like a second skin, the cut showing off her smooth leg from thigh to ankle. Although she was already a good five inches taller than Draco, she wore two-inch heels with straps that wrapped around the lower part of her calf, effectively drawing any man’s eye down her leg.
He can't see it in the dim room, but Harry's pretty sure Draco rolls his eyes. "We really need to get him a girlfriend," he grumbles before grabbing his wand and casting a Heating Charm on a pillow before throwing it into the corner.
“You’re beautiful,” Harry said. How could he not? He wanted to reach out and touch him, but his hands were occupied holding his thighs close to his sides, presenting his achingly empty hole for Draco’s cock. “I can’t believe you’re—”
Reading about your childhood, I also can’t help drawing parallels between you and my cousin Dudley. He was just the same as you, Draco: adored by his parents, spoiled rotten, and arrogant as fuck because of it. He was the worst bully, tormenting me 24/7, both at school and at home, and just like you, he had this entourage of loyal thugs who followed him wherever he went so he never had to face his victims one-on-one.
Making up his mind, he closed the window and grabbed his cloak from the peg on the wall, gave the roaring fireplace a longing look — he was momentarily grateful that protection spells made the fire safe to leave so the office would stay warm and dry for when he returned — then ventured out into the dreadful Christmas afternoon weather.
Harry trailed off, causing Draco to return his full attention to the man before him. The blush had deepened further, Draco noticed, and Harry worried his lip as he seemed to debate whether to elaborate or not. Amused by his flustered state, Draco smirked and raised a quizzical eyebrow his way, ignoring his urge to free that trapped, swollen lip with his tongue as he waited for Harry to cave.
He shifted his weight and freed Harry’s left wrist too, no longer able to resist the urge to touch Harry’s naked flesh any way he could; his sensitive nipples, his smooth flank, his round arse, and his thick, muscular thigh. As he did, Harry’s hand went straight for Draco’s hair again, fingers digging into his dishevelled tresses as if wanting to get tangled up for life, and not only in his hair either. And fuck if Draco didn’t enjoy that thought, far more than he probably should. They’d never talked about this being more than a one-time thing, after all. Heck, they’d just dived right in, all reckless and foolhardy — something he might have expected from a Gryffindor like Harry, sure, but never ever from himself.
Sirius looked up with an innocent raising of his forehead, his eyebrows nearly touching his hairline.
Her words rushed through Draco like a calming draught, making him relax for the first time in what felt like ages. Charlie was safe.
Harry may regret a lot of things in his life, but letting his walls fall down tonight will never be one of them. If anything, he wishes he’d never erected them in the first place. It’s impossible to dwell on that, though. Not with Draco’s throbbing cock filling his mouth as he’s kneeling on the tile in the shower. Not with Draco’s lips stretched around his erection a while later when they’re tangled in the sheets on Harry’s bed. Not with Draco’s arms wrapped around him as they eventually give in to the bone-deep lethargy of sex-induced bliss. Not with Draco’s mouth still curved into a lazy smile as Harry wakes him up the next morning with a hardened nipple in his mouth and an even harder cock pressing against his thigh.
“Get your bearings.” Severus gets up and makes his way over to Draco, who hasn’t opened his eyes once. After a moment, he can feel Potter’s stare on them as he tries to rouse Draco, as he lightly pats his cheek. He's burning up. Severus has a fever reducer, he pulls it out and quickly nudges Draco’s mouth.
"I might need to consult Poppy regarding your case, Mr. Potter," his godfather says, "She has your medical history."
** We will be moving the chapter warnings to the end notes starting soon in order to avoid major spoilers. That does not mean you shouldn’t be cautious and refrain from checking them if you think the content might be triggering. Stay safe.
Both of them crumple into a bed of hay at the same time, their legs giving out beneath them. The hay prickles his skin, but it’s better than the cold and also rotting floorboards of the place. He can hear Harry’s wheezing breath beside him.
His eyes are so dry they burn. He blinks. And feels nothing as the empty pit in his chest seems to grow larger.
Harry shifts so he’s kneeling right in front of Draco, and Draco sits back on his heels, palms flat against the ground. He curls his fingers, trying to get some feeling back into the flesh. Any feeling that isn't pain.
"We're going to be in so much trouble-" he breathes those words, his lips are inches away from hers, "Breaking all sorts of rules."
John only nods and lets his Quill scribble away at the parchment, blackening one line after the other.
Minerva gestures at them to shuffle closer, "Remus will be overseeing your detention in my absence."
"Well, we're alone," Sirius huffs, "So don't worry your furry butt over people finding out you faint over the sight of needles."
It takes Malfoy only a second to right himself, and that familiar sneer is back on his face, “So, Potter,
He vaguely feels the hand on his throat tighten, and just for a moment, hopes that the fingers would crush his windpipe, strangle him to death before it could get his soul sucked out of his mouth. He shudders to think of his body as a soulless husk with a scar on his forehead. Limp, and pale, and… shallow.
Evan's face stretches to a smirk once more, directed at the floor. "Your mercy is the reason I live,"
Draco promptly forgets the name of half of them as soon as Harry tells them, but he knows that the one pecking furiously at Harry’s palm is Lester, and the two on his shoulders are Benji and Larry.
"Good." Harry dumps the carrots into a pot and then runs it under the tap, dispassionately waiting for it to fill up.
"Stop that," Harry tells him but takes the offered treat nonetheless. "I'm not a child." This Sirius, unsurprisingly, doesn't act like the imaginary one at all, and Harry guiltily thinks that he likes the one in his head better.
“You’re right. Just like I didn’t kill Cedric, or the Dursleys and the same way my parents’ death wasn’t my fault. At some point, you all have to realize that I don’t need to be the murderer in order to be responsible for someone’s death. If you weren’t helping me, then you wouldn’t be here. It’s as easy as that.” Harry’s words, said so simply, as if he were stating mere facts, ‘
Since this is an Interlude, we will be updating chapter eighteen NEXT Saturday instead of the normal scheduled date. Have fun with it and stay safe.
“Of course I did. I meant it on a strategic level. He’s really into chess and strategy too. You’re kind of similar.”
The bed dips under Harry's weight and Draco stirs, before without opening an eye, he reaches beneath his head to wrestle out a pillow from the small heap. Harry silently watches the momentous struggle as Draco pulls the pillow out and chucks it at him, which he catches instinctively, before rolling onto his good shoulder, facing Harry. Then he absently pats the bedside, before his breath evens out again.
Pushing down the panic that’s starting to bubble in his chest, he pushes himself off the bed. It’s still early morning. He calls out again, louder this time, still to no answer.
"Here we go!" Maggie the muggle barges in their private little bubble, two glass sundae bowls in her hands. "Enjoy!"
Lucius Malfoy is there too. Harry thinks that he is. That or Imaginary Sirius now has a companion with him. The man isn’t staring at him, unlike his son, but rather at Draco’s back, from what Harry’s blurry and wracking vision can tell him. He’s leaning on his cane, his back straight as an arrow as the torture goes on and on and on.
Harry touches his damp face, his eyes never waver from his own tiny body, and he tries to walk toward that wavering image, but it seems as if the more he walks, the further away it gets.
"Do you have any available rooms?" Draco asks and is proud of the way his voice doesn’t wobble. He knows what they look like. Two dirty, homeless teenagers, more criminal than the victim, clad in soaked clothes. If the woman somehow finds something fishy with them, she probably won’t let them stay.
Bella was easy too, Harry had been almost too gentle with her, two flicks of his wand, she hadn't even screamed properly before he let her up, let her grovel at his feet and pepper it with desperate, grateful pecks. He had sneered down at her with a certain gleam in his eyes before watching her retreat back to the flock of death eaters who bore witness.
Something flashes in Harry’s eyes, too quick to decipher, before he looks back at Twinky, assessing her. Then he nods, flopping back on the floor. Draco rests a hand beneath his head, tilting it up a little and trickling water down his throat. It reminds him of a similar position, attending to Potter in that abandoned bathroom, but at that time, things had been much simpler.
Harry squeezes his hand, and just then one of the weird muggle cars passes them by. Draco freezes for a second but Harry seems nonchalant.
I know Harry’s friends with you now, for some reason, and even Hermione says you’ve ‘changed’ or whatever, so I thought we should…I dunno, clear the air or something.”
“Alright, alright, at least we should all go out together sometime. Bring Violet and Daphne, they’re good fun.”
“Yeah, it was great. We had loads of fun, and we all knew what we were doing was important. Everyone was eager to learn and try stuff.”
He supposed that was good enough, but he couldn’t help but begin to doubt his decision once again. There was no love lost between him and Malfoy, and he wasn’t completely sure that this endeavour wouldn’t end in thrown hexes.
Narcissa herself had had quite enough of it once her year of house arrest was through, having been confined within its walls as she served her sentence, and she had wheedled Draco into taking a lengthy vacation with her on the Isle of Skye. Upon their return, she had settled into a nice routine and grew to enjoy the Manor again, now that it was a home instead of a prison.
“Violet Foxblade,” she said, lifting her wand into the air. The next thing Harry saw made his heart nearly stop in his chest.
It was Valentine’s Day, and apparently the Hufflepuffs were throwing a party in the common room at midnight. Harry’s immediate thought was that he would much rather go to bed and get some sleep, but Hermione, Ron, and Sophie all seemed to be looking forward to it, and when Hermione looked at him with a smile and bright eyes and asked, “You’re coming too, right, Harry?” he knew he couldn’t just say no. What kind of a friend would he be if he left her to be a third-wheel with Ron and Sophie?
Ron was one thing, but Ginny was a completely different case, and he didn’t particularly want to see how she would react when he told her he was friends with a Malfoy now.
“That is without question. The students of Hogwarts are all recovering from the events of last year. However, it seems to me that—for Slytherin House—the war had not yet ended.”
Slughorn wasn’t looking at Draco, he appeared far more interested in the crystal glass of brandy in his left hand.
“I think she thinks it’s her fault, you know, because the article was her idea. Tell her not to worry about it.”
“Are you sure you’re not training me to be an Auror?” he huffed, as Ashworth lowered his wand and gestured for him to take a seat. Ashworth laughed.
“It isn’t that,” Draco said, quietly, feeling his heart beat in his ears as Potter took a step closer to him.
“She’s a beginner?” Ron exclaimed, clearly impressed. Harry was surprised as well; he had witnessed Simone Wexler bat away a Quaffle with her fingertips while
She mumbled all of this very quickly, but Draco felt fire flood through his blood with every word. He was about to speak, but Potter beat him to it.
“I’m sorry. I don’t think that, you know,” he said. “Well—I did think Nott’s father was a Death Eater at first, but after Greengrass said all that, I asked Hermione and she said that it was only his uncle that was a Death Eater and that his father and uncle hadn’t spoken in years anyway because of the association with Voldemort, so…” he trailed off rather nonsensically, and Draco shook his head slightly to himself. Of course he had had to run it by Granger, his walking encyclopaedia.
She had been harassed at Hogwarts that last year by the boys in her grade, for being a Slytherin. Harry and Draco had stumbled upon her crying in a corridor once.
Clearly caught, Harry stuffed his Cloak back into his robes, watching as Malfoy opened his book bag and started searching for something.
When Potter just blinked at him, Draco realized this was a perfect example of one of the many aspects of the magical world that those raised by Muggles didn’t necessarily know about.
“Yeah,” Draco nodded, swallowing hard to prevent any tears from sneaking up. He folded the letter and tucked it back into its envelope before reaching for the parcel and opening it up. He drew in a sharp breath as soon as he saw it.
“Since when do we care about what’s fair to Malfoy?” added Ron. Sophie, who had accompanied them on their walk up to Founder’s Tower and was now sitting with them in their common room's armchairs, snorted, which made Ron grin happily. Hermione shot him a reprimanding look.
The long white gown transformed itself into a clown costume, complete with oversized striped shoes and honking red nose, and Daphne stepped back with a satisfied expression on her face.
And yes, sure, they had won. But at what cost? Could it really count as winning if they had lost so many people, so many lives? Harry still thought about them all, about Remus and Tonks, about Fred, and Moody, and Dumbledore; even Snape. And Sirius. Always Sirius. He thought after three years maybe the pain would start to subside or numb itself out, but it still came at him in harsh reminders, like a quick stab to the chest every time.
Malfoy’s face had gone a deep pink and he immediately looked down at the potion again. This didn’t seem like Malfoy, who normally preened at any praise directed his way. Harry looked at him, somewhat confused. Surely Malfoy enjoyed the attention—he always had. Why was he acting like he didn’t want to meet anyone’s eyes?
“No, it wasn’t, however Amortentia brews much stronger in a gold cauldron. Sometimes, during the brewing process, when the Valerian root is added, the potion can reach extremely high temperatures, and some of the pewter from the cauldron can melt and mix into the potion, which dilutes it. However, gold has a much higher melting point, so it doesn’t carry the same risk.”
Potter chewed down on his lip in thought. Draco’s eyes flickered to watch the movement before he refocused.
Draco sighed. He liked to think he was mysterious and hard to read, but Violet seemed to always be able to tell when something was bothering him.
Malfoy didn’t even seem to realize what he had said, still focused on the potion. Harry wasn’t sure if he should bring it up, he figured it would be rather obnoxious if he did, but Malfoy was constantly obnoxious, so if Harry had something to tease him with, what was wrong with that?
“Want to go again?” Draco asked, shooting Potter a cheeky smirk. Potter huffed, but grinned toothily back.
Harry did his best to follow that advice, but he was somehow sure something terrible would happen if he unclenched his jaw. Draco moved away to stand beside him, a step behind, leaning with his back against the benches, and casually draping his hand onto Harry’s shoulder.
“Not entirely, but I did get a good three hours of sleep. Hopefully I’ll sleep tonight as well and I’ll see,” he said, the prospect of getting back into his four-poster sounding utterly delightful.
“They better bloody let you out of it,” said Granger, and it was then Draco realised that she wasn’t vibrating with excitement at the prospect of a puzzle to solve, she was
Draco was very tempted to roll his eyes, but he supposed Potter wouldn’t take it with the affection with which Draco meant it.
“It’s been happening all year,” she said, in a small voice. If she wasn’t in an N.E.W.T. class with him, Draco wouldn’t have believed she was a seventh year. She barely looked fifteen.
“We need people with the Dark Mark,” Potter tried one more time, but it sounded like an excuse more than an argument now.
"Haven't you ever heard of the ancient tales of Merlin? Fighting dragons with a mighty sword! I'm almost jealous of you, squirt!"
As he served himself some roast pudding and mashed potatoes, he wondered if he really needed to stay here for the next three days. If so, he needed to find something to do. Go flying? Get some advanced reading done for the next school year?
He walks through the halls of the Manor, shrugging off his clothing layer by layer and letting them fall to the floor until only his trousers are left. Quiet pops fill the night, telltale signs of the House Elves dutifully doing their jobs and whisking away his mess. One pops to his right and Harry accepts and puts on the offered sweater with a grateful smile.
Ron and Draco left for the mission on the 10th. If they only spent six days there, then they should have been back by the 15th. But Draco had said that he only got back on the 18th…
“Get to ground-level,” he instructed. “At least the earth is soft. I don’t want you hitting your head on stone. And cast from a good distance away, just in case the stone explodes like what happened in the Forest. Are you
Draco Malfoy’s competence and reliability as an Auror still amazed him sometimes, though he supposed it shouldn’t. The past five years they’ve been Aurors, Malfoy had been nothing short of exemplary, if not a bit pompous at his achievements. The arrogance was well-founded, though. He had quickly made his way up the ranks, sometimes even doing better than Harry in terms of performance. And Malfoy fought fairly and well for those achievements.
"Why not? Just let me punch him once. Potter's too much of a weakling to bite me for a second time, I'm not
As soon as the words are out, he immediately regrets it, because it’s inappropriate, insensitive, and Hermione and Ginny are both going to kill him when they find out.
“Don’t call me that.” Harry glares. It’s getting harder to stay calm when Draco’s so decided to be an asshole. “Look, Malfoy, there’s no deeper, ulterior motive to this. Can’t we just. I don’t know, be friends?”
"What matters is that we're still together. We're safe. We will get the Manor back," his father had firmly told him.
Harry steps in close, as close as he dares, to clasp the robes together. He feels just a little bit guilty at his ulterior motives. “You have no idea, Malfoy.”
"You better be grateful Dumbledore cancelled the Quidditch Cup this year!" Draco scowled, still glaring at him with a finger tapping at Harry's chest. "I'll be captain next year, and you're joining the team, got it?"
important, wasn't it? Very important. Why would Potter do it? If Potter was going be hungry for human blood from now on, he didn't want to be in the same dorm with him. And Potter
And then he heard a loud sigh of relief, before he felt the magic wrap around his arm. It felt weird, like having a single stream of liquid pass through the skin of your arm, but it was over as soon as it began.
Draco raised an eyebrow, but an amused, mischievous smile made its way to his lips. "And you couldn't have done that in the beginning because…?"
All thoughts of Ginny fled from his head as Draco slipped his tongue past Harry's lips, caressing Harry's tongue, and that was all Harry could feel along Draco's warm hand on his cheek and it was wonderful.
Draco flinches and looks away, mouth curled downwards. “We lost the chance for that back in first year. Too late for friendship bracelets now,” he mutters.
And, like a steady stream of water slowly flowing through a crack on a tall, daunting dam, Harry could feel himself being filled with
"The human who gives the vampire his first taste of human blood is referred in texts as the First Donor. It is this blood that… rearranges the chemical construction of the vampire's body. The vampire's body will change according to that first blood, and as a result, will crave for it thereafter." He paused, letting all the information sink in.
"Sorry," Draco whispered, his breath ghosting against Harry's lips. He blinked his eyes rapidly to fight back the tears and swallowed to push his heart back down from his throat. "Sorry, I'll fix that," he muttered, his voice breaking off at the end once again.
Harry immediately recognizes it, and his eyes brighten. “Oh. It’s from Molly.” He parks the wheelchair on Draco’s side of the table and then sits down on his chair.
That was mainly because the last time Harry did reach boiling point, he ended up with broken knuckles. And he also did not want to go back to the Hospital Wing because that meant Madame Pomfrey forcing the culprit behind the Jinx out of him.
He and Draco interacted more than before, but other than that, it was mostly still the same. Harry hanged out with Theodore, and Draco, Pansy, and Blaise formed their own group. They would often disappear during dinner time on weekends, though, not that Harry noticed because he always looked for white-blond hair every meal time out of habit.
“No, you misunderstand me,” Narcissa rushes to assure him. She shakes her head. “Voldemort—“ And the unflinching way that Narcissa says his name has Harry wondering just where did this woman hide all this courage. “—is gone, and so is his reign of terror, all because of you. You’re a hero, Harry. You can have everything you want and it will be given to you. You can choose to live however you want. Concerning yourself over Draco is, I understand, a…” Here, her lips press tightly against each other, and there is an expression of pain that flitters across her face. “A hindrance to that, perhaps?”
Harry's fists clenched, making more blood trickle out of his wounds. 'Bloody fucking wankers,' he spat angrily, not caring if no sound came out. He glared at the infirmary door.
So he dialled the correct number and off they were zoomed to the Auror Department of the Ministry of Magic.
Pansy could do it herself. Harry didn't owe her anything. And Harry certainly didn't care about what Draco thought about snogging. It was absolutely irrelevant and unimportant.
Harry nodded. He was wary of Ron's reaction, wondering if he'll start ranting or just blurt out things that should not be blurted out so suddenly. Still, he couldn't help grinning at him.
and figures falling to the ground with heavy thuds, but all Harry could see was Draco, covered in blood, again,
Harry's shoulders were slumped, and his eyes were wide and green and nervous as they stared at the table. It was that that made Draco know that this morning wasn't going to be like the rest, aside from the fact that Harry didn't have any treacle tart with him.
Draco leaned back, relaxing, letting himself slump (just a bit!) against the hard backrest of his chair. He really was too far gone with Potter.
The Goblet of Fire burned brightly, the tips of its flames dancing wildly in black and blue, until – a hiss and a pop – a piece of paper flew from the goblet, into the air, and into Dumbledore's waiting hand.
The next day, Harry comes and Draco’s already in the middle of the garden, his wheelchair forgotten a distance away among a shrub of pink carnations.
"Yes, and I believe they miss you dearly," he said, and then his face turned sour. "Albus informed me that Narcissa has been trying to send me Howlers."
Harry looked at him, amused. He could feel the beginnings of a grin threaten to worm its way up to his lips.
"Unhappily pining over a love that may not be as unrequited as you think," Ginny added, a true smile gracing her features. "Where's that Gryffindor courage?"
Lucius hissed. "Voldemort will be looking for you and me. It's better that Draco is not with any of us."
Severus, dripping wet and his hair plastered flat on his head, spluttering furiously and cursing Albus and Minerva alternately for putting him in an Enchanted Sleep.
Once the amazement of seeing a dragon wore off, the gravity of the situation seemed to fall on the others. They all seemed a little paler, even Viktor.
August comes to a close, and the upcoming school year has everyone busy, so much that the invitations for whatever functions have stopped. He thinks that that’s why Narcissa has stopped asking him to come to the Manor, though she
“My mother’s name is Lily,” said Harry because he didn’t know what to reply to what Draco had just said.
"I get by with an Acceptable, thank you very much," Potter muttered in reply. "I'm fine. I have this belief that if there's anyone that can beat Voldemort, it will probably be Madame Pomfrey. Also, I heal very fast. It's another one of my
"I didn't ask for it," Potter said, clenching his fist. He was looking away again, and just when Draco had finally got Potter to look at him.
Potter looked offended. Good. "I don't either! It just so happened that you had to go and get yourself poisoned by a snake. And of all the snakes, it had to be Voldemort's!"
He wasn't even sure how there was a Quidditch pitch in this place. He should ask Severus later. Or Kreacher. Kreacher seemed to be more indulgent in divulging important things.
Harry had already traveled to the Astronomy Tower and then to the Great Lake before he was confident that his head was a whole lot clearer. When he returned to the castle, he was just tired and ready to sleep this all
He registers the stunned surprise colouring her face once she sees him, but he doesn’t know what he says to her, only remembers Malfoy’s name slipping through his lips, and Narcissa’s off, hurried footsteps, and then, down the hall, a turn of the knob and the creak of the door opening and the click as it closes.
Then she turned back to the professor and the lecture, and didn't talk to them until they were dismissed.
Harry thought that he might be dreaming. After all, he hadn't been this happy since Sirius died. He had this little fear that something
Draco looked away, feeling awkward with all the honesty. "You did it to save my life, Potter. Even I know when a debt is made."
Leaning heavily on the fence, he wiped away the sweat on his face using his sleeve, noting belatedly that his hand was shaking.
Seamus opened his mouth to speak once more but that was the same time that Ron pointed a finger towards the cat and blurted out, “
– burst with pain and Harry shouted, loudly, crumpling to his knees, and he almost didn't hear the words that disrupted the quiet of the night:
Sirius' head was shoved aside. Remus smiled apologetically at him. "I'll take care of him, Harry. You go enjoy the Triwizard Tournament. It's a chance that not everyone gets to have. Write to us all about it, alright? Talk to you in three days."
That night in Little Hangleton… with all the Death Eaters present… He was sure that Mr. Parkinson had been there. So had the Crabbes and the Goyles. And Nott's father.
When Potter spoke, gone was the irritability that he had brought with him since the morning. When he spoke, it was almost soft.
Draco goes back to glaring at the pancakes, and Harry finishes his third pancake mechanically. Once he’s done and there’s nothing left on his plate for him to stuff his mouth with (and there’s no more excuse for him to shut up), he tries, “Do you want me to feed you?"
As soon as he had stepped out of the Tent into the arena, he barely had time to jump behind a boulder before a burst of flames was sent his way. He was mentally screaming.
“Sorry!” Harry said quickly as the witch behind the cashier sent him a glare. He smiled nervously at her and at the one other customer who turned to look before picking up the book that had fallen.
"I don't want to stay with Potter," Draco said, frowning. He had always been more outspoken with Severus, because Severus never treated him like a child.
Harry's world zeroed in on that voice then and on that familiar smirk. The same thing happened every time Draco talked to him. Granted, it occurred more often than Harry was comfortable with, even after four years of being housemates. It always tore him inside how much he wanted to be friends with Draco again, and at the same time how afraid he was that the same thing would happen in the end.
wrote Harry on the Self-Erasing Parchment the next morning as they were walking to the Great Hall. Hermione had already gone ahead of them since they had woken up late after staying up until two in the morning.
Harry watched it go with amusement, debating on whether to follow so that he may put a halt on his immature musings.
Harry rolled his eyes. He took Draco's hand and gingerly guided the long fingers to trace the one word etched on the wood of their table.
“What is it, Hermione?” he asked, urgently, no longer caring much who was listening in. “Do you know what it is?”
“I always expected him to cause pain,” When he spoke, it was as though the words were coming from somewhere else. He could feel his lips moving, hear his own voice, but there was something distant about it, everything coming out without conscious permission. “No matter what, I always braced myself around him. It was never enough, but…it was always expected. Never surprising. It sounds…it sounds horrible, but he was predictable in a way. At a certain point, I think I just became numb and desensitized to it all. It stopped being shocking, the dreadful things he did, because he didn’t have any lines he wouldn’t cross. There wasn’t an evil he wouldn’t commit, not a human being he wouldn’t kill—man, woman, or child. He could cause excruciating pain, but…but I think…it hurts more when you don’t expect it. When it’s caused by someone who isn’t
Draco took a very deep breath as he returned his attention to the potion long enough to add an ingredient and quickly step back as the potion hissed and sputtered.
“What is it, Malfoy?” Potter said, some urgency in his face. He must have thought Draco had noticed something pertinent to the case about the house. A sharp curling sensation in Draco’s chest forced him to speak, to reassure.
“Do you work?” he asked, hesitantly. Throughout his years at Hogwarts, he had never thought he would have to work in his adult years—at least, certainly not the kind of work he was doing now. But then again, he had always planned to end up like his father back then, and now, well, his father wasn’t exactly in a position to be the ideal role model.
He sighed and set his quill down before rubbing at his eyes. They had been at this for ages, perhaps it was time for a break.
Oh, bollocks. He looked up to see the gaggle of recruiters all looking up at him with wide eyes. He tucked his hands in his pockets and ambled over to them. He supposed they wanted to ask about Ginny. The news of their breakup had gone past simple school gossip and had managed to make the front page of the Daily Prophet’s Christmas issue.
As soon as McGonagall finished speaking, the tables all magically filled with food, and—as if on cue—Hermione began chattering.
“No argument here,” Ron said, with an easy grin. “But what exactly are you talking about right now?”
It had been hatred at first—anger at being snubbed that evolved into steady dislike as the hostility between them increased in magnitude. Underneath it all had surged a feeling of envy and hurt pride. He would lash out at Potter’s friends, because he had chosen them over him, and the more he told himself it was for other reasons—Weasley’s poverty, Granger’s blood status—the more he believed it.
He looked up to find Ginny Weasley stomping towards him, followed closely by Potter, who seemed to be trying to pull her back.
no such thing has been accomplished in wandlore yet, Draco, no one had even considered it. You should be very proud.”
Draco eyed him suspiciously, but Potter merely looked back with his bright green eyes expectant and his face open and patient. It was almost disarming, in a way. He had never seen that expression aimed at him before.
Hermione was seated by the front, one of the other Gryffindor girls—Harry thought her name started with an S—next to her. Harry and Ron joined their table, Harry nodding a hello at the Gryffindor girl, who smiled back.
Hermione Granger worked on the fifth level of the Ministry, in the International Magical Office of Law. She was apparently very important, as she had both a receptionist and a secretary outside of her office. Potter seemed to have some sort of all-clear, as they immediately let him in as soon as they saw him.
Draco looked up at her, then up at Dumbledore, then—with another jolt in his stomach—at the portrait next to his, with contained a stony-faced Severus Snape, whose eyes bore into Draco like he was trying to burn a hole through his skull.
“Say,” he said, suddenly remembering what had been occupying his mind before Ollivander’s tragic death. “Has Pansy visited any of you?”
“I did want to ask, Harry,” Waya spoke again, and Harry focused his attention on him. “If you would be interested in continuing our sessions after you have finished your schooling.”
“But fools rarely differ,” he mumbled, dropping a miniscule seed into their cauldron, and Harry didn’t know who this comment was directed to.
“Yes, yes, you’re the embodiment of evil, very frightening, blah blah. Seriously, did something happen?”
“Robards thought he was going to get to retire after the war,” she said. “That’s why he volunteered to do apprenticeships at Hogwarts our last year. Well, that
“Yes, that,” he said. “It’s a bit…well, everyone else here loves it because they get to take the mickey out of me constantly.”
“Hello, family,” said Arthur, as he walked inside. Everyone greeted him, with Molly walking over to help him out of his jacket and Bill inviting him to sit beside him. Taking advantage of the distraction, Ginny squeezed Harry’s leg and then got up from the sofa, effectively ending their conversation.
him, he reminded himself—to try and transform. Hopefully if he was in a nest or something, the branch would be able to support him, or at least he wouldn’t fall from such a great height.
“You had no right to take our case like that,” Potter said, firmly. “You could have come to me as a fellow member of the department and asked if the Aurors and the M.L.E.S. could cooperate and work together on this case, but instead you went over our heads and are shifting authority on a case in progress. Do you know how much work will be lost that way? We have a rapport with the witnesses! We have potential leads!”
for him to hate a boy his age so much?” And his father had shrugged it off and said something about rivalry being healthy or whatever nonsense that Draco had completely internalized.
He knew Violet was a pureblood too, though he wasn’t sure if she was descended from any of the Sacred Twenty-Eight.
“You can call me Harry,” Potter said, still in that calm, kind tone. “I know it’s probably hard to talk about, but it’s important for us to know what happened, okay?”
“Of course. I daresay you will have one of the most experienced mentors of all. Garrick Ollivander himself has agreed to oversee your apprenticeship.”
“Potter,” Draco replied. He was so tempted to ask about what he had found so amusing about Draco quitting his job, before remembering that of course, this Potter had no recollection of such a thing.
Dennis came over to them on the bench, leaning over to show them the last few snaps he’d captured. The more he flipped through, the more Harry’s stomach churned.
Harry had just blinked at hi, but before he could say anything, he felt a sharp pain suddenly rise up in his fingers and on his palms, like he’d been…like he’d been
The Slytherin team wasn’t bad, Harry thought, but the Ravenclaws certainly weren’t making it easy for them. Their strongest assets were definitely their Beaters—seventh years Martin Penn and Ruby Sullivan—who seemed to
century, and the facts she’d given him had left him in such disbelief that he had spent an entire night in the library’s Muggle Studies section, until he’d learned as much as he possibly could. He’d sat there, horrified at what he’d read, but also horrified that he hadn’t known. After that, he listened to every word Violet said about her classes, and almost always went to the library afterwards for further research.
So his parents, surely, held some of the blame. They had raised him to believe in blood purity, to believe in the inferiority of Muggleborns, that Muggles had oppressed them for hundreds of years and it was time to finally fight back. Father had gone on and on about how Muggleborns were stealing magic from “real” wizards. Of course Draco had believed him. He had believed everything Father told him.
“No one else will ever hire you, you know,” Finchley said. “You can say you’re reformed all you like! Once a Death Eater, always a Death Eater!”
“I came to support my House team,” Harry said with a smile, keeping it neutral, but adding, “Ginny’s a fantastic player, one of the best I’ve seen.”
“…and peaches, and the leather of a Quaffle,” girl-Weasley was saying, leaning forward in her seat next to Luna, who said nothing more than “it smells like friends and stars and happiness,” when it was her turn to speak.
Draco’s eyes widened. He was constantly taken aback at how he had never noticed Violet until this year when she was possibly the most Slytherin of them all.
He used to be like that. It was only by spending time with people like Violet and Luna and Ella that he became gentler; softer. Kinder, both to others and to himself. He was privileged to have such friendships. Not everyone did.
“They don’t much like being tampered with,” Luna continued, and Draco braced himself, ready for Luna to tell him it wasn’t possible, that he was stuck with this monstrous mark seared into his skin for the rest of his life.
“It is a valuable skill to learn, and while I usually recommend it is taught to children from a young age so they have longer to become accustomed to it, I am aware that you are a highly unusual wizard. I have hoped for many years that Hogwarts would begin teaching more wandless magic, and I think you would be the perfect choice to introduce it.”
On one early Saturday afternoon, after having fallen asleep the night before on his Potions essay, he decided to head down to Hagrid’s, to make up for missing the day before. It wasn’t like Hagrid really needed his help, but he had gotten used to Harry stopping by, and besides, it was something to do.
And now it was he that was staying at Hogwarts, he that wasn’t welcome back at home. Of course, he couldn’t be mad at his mother, he knew she was only thinking of his best interests. He couldn’t imagine it was easy for her either, trying to purge the Manor of Dark Magic with only two elves to help her. Truthfully, he wasn’t sure if it was even possible to remove all the Dark Magic from the Manor, as plenty of it had existed long before the Dark Lord had claimed the house as his headquarters.
He was also certain that his name was on the Greengrass’s list of potential suitors. He was, after all, one of the only age-appropriate males of the Sacred Twenty-Eight left. He was sure he wasn’t high on the list, what with his ex-Death Eater status. Theo must be up there, and perhaps Longbottom, although he doubted that Longbottom had taken the oath.
Truthfully, Draco found the latter far more interesting, not that he’d ever admit it. He had been leaning a lot from her. Muggles seemed to have their own kinds of magic, things they created that worked sort of like they had charms put on them. Violet tried to explain how they worked without magic, but it had been extremely complicated and Draco had barely been able to follow. He was sure he’d get it after a while.
Their food arrived shortly and they all dug in eagerly, too hungry to put much effort into maintaining conversation. Harry was grateful for Ron’s choice in venue, his chicken salad sandwich was delicious and he couldn’t imagine eating a hot meal on a day as warm as today.
“Experimenting with cores is a vital part of your education in wandmaking. Were you thinking of any in particular?” Ollivander turned his wide, silvery gaze to Draco.
To his surprise, he saw that Draco’s pale face was tinged with pink and he was determinedly not meeting Harry’s eyes.
“You were trying to. You wouldn’t have cast it,” Potter spoke matter-of-factly. “I know how those spells work, Draco. You have to really mean it.”
“Doesn’t mean he’s not here,” said Draco. There were ways to hide from the human-presence-revealing spell, after all.
“I wish it was,” Harry said, quietly. Ginny looked at him, and Harry could’ve sworn the expression she wore was pity.
More hissing. Draco slowly felt his fear abating, as the snake seemed to settle back into a less defensive position, and as Potter’s posture remained relaxed. He found himself curiously listening to the strange sound of Parseltongue coming from Potter’s mouth. Potter was rather clumsy with the English language, stumbling over words and muttering lots of “er”s and “erm”s. Admittedly, Draco didn’t understand what he was saying, but Parseltongue seemed to be so natural to him, like he didn’t even have to think when he spoke. It flowed out of him with an almost graceful ease and yet such power in the sounds, harsh and pointed.
Still, part of why he had been such an incessantly irritating little brat throughout those early Hogwarts years was to cement some sort of place for himself in Potter’s life, even if it wasn’t the most flattering role.
“Wandless and non-verbal?” Draco rolled his eyes so hard he could feel it in his head. “Merlin and Salazar, and you wonder why I hated you for seven years, you can just do bloody everything, can’t you?”
Well, that made sense. All the Gryffindor boys had returned so naturally their arrangement would remain the same. Draco turned to look at the door on the left.
At this, Draco had finally looked up at her properly. Her arms at folded and she was regarding him with a scolding look, like the one she used to wear when he was a child and got caught chasing after the peacocks in the garden.
Jamison looked very much like he wanted to curse Granger, and Draco could see Potter’s hand slowly moving towards his wand holster, but then Jamison just snarled.
“I think he must be Native American,” Hermione said, her eyes still on the new professor. “I wonder what tribe.”
Hermione and Ron were waiting at their table with wide eyes and questioning glances. Harry just shook his head at them. They seemed to take this as an answer for now, but Harry knew there would be many questions later. Hermione’s expression was unreadable.
“I know,” he said, honestly. He supposed it made sense that some of the inexplicable pressure he had been feeling to stay with Ginny could have been because of this, but now that they were no longer together, he felt no desire or responsibility to get back with her.
It was comforting, to have this sense of familiarity, particularly when everything else felt wildly out of orbit.
He had never really liked cooking for the Dursleys, so for his first year out of Hogwarts, he avoided the kitchen. But he felt terrible that Kreacher was cooking and no matter how many times he told him he didn’t have to, the old elf would just scowl and insist that biscuits and tea weren’t a proper meal and that “Master doesn’t understand an elf’s duties to his family” and that “Kreacher cannot allow Master to starve himself out of stubbornness”, so finally Harry had acquainted himself with the kitchen and began cooking some simple meals for himself, discovering along the way that he was actually rather enjoying himself.
possible that he and Potter had gotten somewhat emotionally invested in the case and allowed that to cloud their professional judgment. Slightly.
“It isn’t an eye for an eye, Draco,” she said, sharply. “Just because I told you my story doesn’t mean you have to tell me yours. You don’t owe me anything.”
“You are serving as an example to the younger students,” she continued. “Mr Potter, we spoke about the importance of house unity at the beginning of the year, or have you already forgotten?”
“And this is Pettigrew’s,” Ron nodded towards the wand now sitting beside his plate. Harry looked down at it, and saw that it was indeed much darker and shorter than Ron’s old one.
Ron just grinned. “Please, mate, this is Ginny we’re talking about. Bellemore ended up on the receiving end of her famous Bat-Bogey Hex. Should teach people to stay away from my sister.”
Draco couldn’t help but wonder how relative the degree of Weasley and Finnigan’s success was. His eyes were just wandering over to look at Zacharias Smith and the other seventh-year Hufflepuff at the front of the class when he realized Slughorn was inviting them to name what they smelled from their potions.
Draco let himself join the crowd as they exited through the front, and discreetly made his way around the building. Potter was leaning against the back of the building, a Muggle cigarette between his fingers. Draco felt the familiar shiver run down his spine at the sight of him, the smoke floating from his lips.
It was easy to tell Ashworth was incredibly proud of being a Gryffindor. He had a scarlet triangular tapestry with a lion on it hanging on the wall behind his desk, and the desk itself was home to a number of golden quills and a large, red chair made of velvet.
“You don’t have to tell me,” Potter said suddenly, leaning back, as if realizing the reason for Draco’s hesitation.
They had been kissing for what felt like hours now. They had gone from the doorway to the sofa and finally into Draco’s bed, and at some point during all of that kissing, Potter had become Harry. The first time Draco had gasped his name was entirely by accident, as Harry had kissed down his neck and gently sucked on a sensitive spot, and Draco had felt all blood leave his brain.
Draco did not trust easily. He was taught from a very young age that trusting people was dangerous, that they would always let you down. His father had told him, time and time again,
Harry felt his stomach sink more and more with every word Ashworth said. He didn’t have anything against the idea exactly, but his standing in school was nothing like it had been in fifth year. In fact, it was completely the opposite now. Instead of being the crazy outcast, he was now the Boy-Who-Lived-Twice, bloody Saviour of the Wizarding World, as much as he hated it. How was he supposed to find someone who actually needed tutoring and was able to take him seriously as a teacher, instead of seeing him as
“Be quiet, Ronald,” Granger said, swiftly, and Draco was rather impressed when Weasley shut his trap instantly. She turned to Draco. “How’d you find out about that anyway?”
They had managed to identify him as a Clarence Price, a former employee of broommakers Beyond Brooms. By digging into his history, they had discovered that he had had an older sister, Claudia—a Squib. Their parents had gone the old-fashioned route—locking her up in the basement and pretending to the world that she didn’t exist. It had been Clarence’s job to bring her food and to generally take care of her, as their parents wanted nothing to do with her.
Draco had been in too deep from the very beginning, and he knew it. But still, how was he meant to resist? It was
“Our apprenticeship information is out,” replied Hermione at once. “Everyone’s mentors are listed on the bulletin board.”
Weasley’s face looked rather constipated, but he stuck out a freckled hand nonetheless. Still completely bewildered at what was happening, Draco shook it.
He held it in his hand and felt a rush of magic run through him, as if it was connecting him to his new wand. The length was far more comfortable; at a quick glance, it looked to be about eleven inches. It was a warm colour, relatively light but not as pale as aspen or poplar. He supposed it could be sycamore, though it was a bit redder than a sycamore wand should be. He wouldn’t be able to figure out the core until he experimented with it a bit.
But he didn’t think he did. He liked being his friend. He liked that he could now talk about the true nature of his apprenticeship with him, that conversation rarely turned to the war, that Theo was smart and well-read and could easily keep up with Draco.
Draco felt the quail shift uncomfortably in his stomach. It had been a long time since someone had mentioned the war. If he were being honest, that was largely why the thought of Pansy had been so disconcerting.
Granger’s success in school had always infuriated Draco, especially since his father never let him forget how a Muggleborn had bested him in every subject, but now, he simply couldn’t find any anger left in him for her.
“Many of the ingredients are regulated, so it’s not like I can brew them on my own, but I need to know how to brew them before I apply for a license for my own Apothecary.”
“Yes?” asked Malfoy. “Yes, you want me to turn you back, or yes, you want someone you know to do it?”
“Nah,” Ron said, returning to his food. “She’s on her emergency rotation now, so it’s more often, but they’re putting her on poisons and antidote training next month.”
What Draco had actually been doing was trying to phrase it so that he didn’t sound like he believed he knew more about Potter’s problems than Potter himself, however he had to admit that yes, it applied to him as well.
“Procedure dictates that cases are not transferred unless absolutely necessary. You wanting to get your names in the paper is not a matter of necessity!”
The other Thestrals had also become accustomed to Draco’s visits and greeted him with soft snorts or else a sort of benign indifference. Armstrong’s head was comfortably nestled in Draco’s lap and enjoying the way Draco was scratching him behind his ears.
“Not at all. If it would help at all for me to speak on your behalf, in regards to the validity of the work we will be doing.”
“Finnigan barely restrains himself from hexing me on sight, Thomas is a little bit better but that’s not saying much, Finch-Fletchley nearly pisses himself any time I’m in the
“Yeah, mate, and it…well, ‘Mione says it was like an experiment, right? We had feelings for each other, so we gave it a go and…well, it didn’t work out the way we thought.”
, Draco thought to himself, feeling a shudder run down his spine at the mere memory of the Dark Magic searing into his flesh. He squirmed slightly, feeling the nervousness turn his stomach.
“That’s lovely to hear. I knew that larch would be the right choice for you. It will help you pick up your confidence as well,” at this, he gave Draco a wink. “And unicorn hair, like your first wand. I remember it well—hawthorn and unicorn hair, ten inches, quite springy.”
“Sounds like she sucked,” Laurel finally said, a half-smirk on her face, and the tension that was weighing over the table snapped like a twig.
“Oh, you know,” said Pansy, with a shrug of one shoulder. “The food is divine, the boys are delicious. I finally sat for my exams last year, the French equivalent to the N.E.W.T.s. I didn’t see the point, but my mother insisted, and you know how she gets.”
Draco had felt that he wasn’t as needed around the house as his father had made him believe he would be. He’d also found that he didn’t mind much, however, as he had quickly taken to spending most of his days lying in bed.
“If we follow the chain of allegiance of the Elder Wand, we see that young Mr Potter won it from you with a similar subtle method, a Disarming spell or something of that nature, causing no significant harm to you. The Elder Wand, not being especially loyal, thus transferred allegiance to him. However, hawthorn is not a wood that makes for easily-won wands, as you well know. When Mr Potter gained control and possession of your wand, there was a shifting of allegiances—of that, there is no doubt. Whether that allegiance was of
She stared up at him, eyes wide at the implication, but she obediently held out her arm and pulled up the sleeve of her robes to reveal smooth, blank skin. Un-Marked. Unblemished.
He falls onto the damp ground, flinging out his arms in order not to face plant, but his arm gives out under him anyway and he yells out in pain. His shoulder hurts. It hurts as much as it had the day he’d been cursed. Which is bad. Merlin, it’s bad.
"I don't know," Harry teases, "I heard a smidgen of a compliment in your voice." He looks around them again, his eyes only subtly admiring, "This place is beautiful."
"Just a moment," she says and disappears into the corridor that leads to the man's office, emerging only after a few minutes have passed.
Harry stirs when a sharp knocking raps the door right behind him, he almost jumps out of his skin, scrambling, reaching for his wand, until Aunt Petunia's shrill voice cries out, "Get up! Get up! The breakfast isn't going to cook itself, get up!"
Potter lets out a groan, turning his head away from the vial at his mouth, but Draco firmly plants a hand against his face, holding his head in place as he urges him to drink, more furiously than before.
They’d made a gamble, going for a Horcrux despite not having found the one Morris had left. They’d known it had been a fifty percent chance of being the real Horcrux. Morris had one, the Dark Lord the other. Morris took the secret to his young grave, and it was up in chance, whether what he took was the locket or the ring.
He has downed half the glass in five seconds, and it burns. He finishes the rest of it and pours himself another, but doesn't sip yet. He stares at the nearly full glass, and the liquid inside, and his hands which are gripping it. He traces the rim with a finger, his lips pursed.
Draco’s first instinct is to snap at her, ‘How do you think I’m doing?’ but he holds his tongue, turning her words over in his head. He would have thought Father asked her to inquire, but if that was so, she’d have asked earlier. And phrased it differently.
Then he promptly lets his head roll over to Harry's shoulder. His cheek pressed against Harry’s bony collar bone as Harry grunts in surprise. His eyes fall shut and he slowly, reluctantly, releases Harry’s hand.
Severus, once they arrive at the rundown cottage, doesn’t waste even a second, ignores Potter crouching over an alarmingly unconscious Draco and rips out his portkey from the inner pocket of his robes.
"You're gushing out blood," Harry pushes the vial back into his hands and Draco wants to grip his fingers and put them on his own face. Just to feel warmer.
Harry is trailing his fingers upwards, muttering the names, "We need to go north," he says, and Draco feels guilty for not participating.
Rosier chuckles, and the sound sends a sudden wave of shivers down Harry’s spine. “I would have,” Evan says. “But Lucius and our Lord have made it abundantly clear that you aren’t to be touched.”
When the curse is lifted from his body, Umbridge's face is inches from his own, and he jerks back in surprise, his eyes widening. He cannot feel his wand, his only weapon, where is his wand?
Harry sees the silver gleam of a knife that's stuck inside the flesh. Hysterically, he wishes he'd been the one to put it there.
around the room, anything to just shut the damn cats up, they might not be the sole reason for the pulsing in his temples, but they're not helping either. With a sigh, Harry wonders how long it will take for his cuts to close this time.
Fudge's mouth is full, and he cannot answer for a beat, his chin is dusted with white, and the man hastily reaches for a napkin as he washes down the rest of his scone with a long swig of his teacup. John patiently waits, the perfect image of professional journalism.
He walks over to a bench. The pieces of cheap paint on metal are rusting and peeling off in some places, but he sits down anyway. He scratches some of the paint chips with his fingernails, idly glancing around the playground.
” Severus casts a quick non-verbal shield around Draco as he sprints across the room towards Potter, who is now on the floor from the resulting explosion from Rosier’s spell.
Hermione awkwardly sits at the edge of an unmade bed that must be Ron's, and Harry leans back against the closed door, just taking them in. They looked… kind of pathetic.
around the unventured cottage in search of said kitchen. Severus starts peeling off Draco’s robe, and then his shirt, wincing at the claw like marks across his torso but focusing on his shoulder. There’s so much blood that he can’t even make out the wound.
Draco’s eyes flick over to Potter’s right hand. Which is… bloody again. There isn’t as much blood as yesterday, at least, not much that he can see, but it’s still smeared all over his hand.
When Draco turns around towards the pitcher to get himself some water as well, Twinky is standing there with a tray in her hands. Two sandwiches and two quarter pieces of an apple. He asks her to set down the tray, she shakes her head violently, her large ears flapping. “No, no one must know.”
"You heard that?" he snatches his hat from his desk, inwardly cursing the minister for his awful timing. "I won't be gone for long." The bustling in the office slowly trickles back into full volume. "Julia is in charge while I'm gone."
“Of course I am, I have no idea what to do, he might die, oh fuck. He really might. I need to call someone, but no one would hear us, and if they did they might not help him. I don’t know what to do. This isn’t good. This is really bad. Fuck. Fuck,”
Staying here, getting tortured by this wretched woman, until she decides to either wipe out his memory or do something else, well, Draco doesn't bother finishing either thought. They all lead to the same fate.
Draco woke up to Harry making them peanut butter sandwiches, using a torn piece of bread to plop the thing on another piece, as he spread it evenly and topped it off with another from the package.
Snape was there, standing next to a chuckling- considerably taller- Harry, standing with his hands locked behind his back and his face completely stoic. A statue probably would have shown more emotion than that man.
He still has detentions with her. Not held in Dumbledore's office, as it had been completely sealed shut upon the man's departure, but instead in her own pink splashed, cat littered villainous lair. In many ways, Harry is relieved that he doesn't have to serve any torture sessions in the man's office.
Harry's eyes trail up to him with a soft smile, his hand edges toward the knife, but Draco barely notices over the warmth in his eyes.
The proceeding articles that emerged after Professor Dumbledore's escape each seemed wilder than the last, and Harry sat each morning at his table, wide-eyed as the owls delivered the Daily Prophet in a flock of chaos in an otherwise ghostly silent Hall.
"This is going to hurt a lot," Harry hums, and he looks as if he knows how much Draco is secretly dreading this. Which of course he does.
The curse that Rosier put on Harry before parting will be featured greatly in the last arc of this installment in our series, and while not explored too explicitly, still we feel compelled to take care of our lovely readers.
He quickly swallows the piece without chewing and knocks, feeling his heart sink just as always when he's heading to these detentions, with the last one being last night. There's a shrill chirp that says "Come in," and Harry actually rolls his eyes before opening the door.
He makes Harry drink the rest of their water, and much to his loathing, they split the bread into two, and munch on it as they walk. Draco just blissfully ignores the blisters surely forming on his feet in favour of avidly listening to Harry groggily talk.
"If you must know,” Harry scowls, his hands pat around on the table blindly for his glasses, “I really miss my friends." Draco sighs and plucks them up from the far side of the table. Harry is prone to losing the damn thing a lot. He opens the flimsy frame and leans over, placing them on Harry’s face.
“Just a little bit more,” Draco whispers to Potter as they’re heavily leaning against the wall. Severus watches from the corner of his eyes as Nott rounds the end of the corridor, leaving it vacant. There is no one else on the main levels but Lucius, them and Nott. Bella isn’t even in the manor, and that’s a blessing on itself.
"Oh Evan," she has her wand pointed at him but Harry doesn't remember her drawing it out. He can't focus on anything.
Well, yes he is. But that’s not why he came here. But he also can’t tell Harry that he freaked out because he wasn’t in bed with him, “I guess?”
Last night’s storm is long gone and has given way to a cheery sun, clouds rolling about the too blue sky. It’s almost insultingly merry.
Draco doesn't quite know what to do with the information so he just shrugs, running a finger on the chipped swirly tabletop. There's a small piece of carrot left there, desolate and alone. Draco stares at it.
"Stay behind me," then they're on the move, their steps quietly clicking against the stones as they stride to the stairs at the end of the corridor. No one else should be there, prior to his departure from the study Lucius promised to keep an eye out so Severus is mildly optimistic that they won't run into much trouble.
He occasionally encounters people, he only knows a few and studiously ignores them, but other than that no one really pays the too thin boy with overly large clothes and dark circles under his eyes any mind.
Lucius considered privacy a delicacy these days, the same way he had considered his father’s company as such as a young boy, since he barely got to meet the man as a youth, and even later on as an adult.
Remus knows this. He knows this very clearly. He’d been worrying himself sick over Harry too, but this isn’t the way to go, this way they’d be doing something. They can’t just sit idle and waste away. "He wouldn't want you to do this to yourself."
Daydreaming is too simple of a name for it. The vibes that Draco is getting from Potter is wildly different. Tangible.
The Minister swipes a scone off the platter for himself and carefully starts unwrapping the white powdered treat with devoting care. "Then please," he says, the tips of his fingers powdered white already. "Feel free to start any time now, John."
The second one, is that despite that endless drone of pain that shakes his body, in the most ironic sense of the word, Harry is acutely aware of Draco Malfoy staring at him the entire time, between half lidded eyes, from the corner of the cell, where Rosier also stood when it wasn’t his turn to play. Harry doesn’t know why, but Draco watching him suffer, is more embarrassing, and nerve wracking than he had realized. Harry knows that on a sub conscious level, he doesn’t give a flying fuck that Draco is watching as he screams and writhes on the stone cold floor, but in the same instance, he has to constantly stifle the urge to yell at the other boy, just to tell him to “LOOK AWAY! DON’T LOOK AT THIS!”
Every twitch, every laugh--because Sirius has more than a dozen of those and each means something different-- every frown, and every time he looks at Remus with the look on his face.
In a place that reeks of dark magic, a house where every little thing could pose a threat of imminent death.
The following is our reply to a lovely reader, who unfortunately deleted their comment before we could respond. In case they are still reading this story, here is our response. The rest of you guys...feel free to read for a bit of meta from the writers, otherwise, feel free to skip it ;)
Kingsley cocks an eyebrow at him. "You're not from my division." He says and grabs a scone off Futternic's tray.
This time Draco really cannot reign in the frown creasing his face. Balms. And skin grafter potions? Even if Severus were stupidly optimistic there wasn't much any of those things could do to a werewolf wound. Werewolf injuries cannot be healed. It's a universal truth.
"Why are you moping?" Draco asks, pulling out and plopping down in the chair in front of Harry on the kitchen table.
Here’s the first interlude! Hope you guys enjoy it, thanks to our wonderful Beta! Tell us all about your favorite scenes!
Draco can feel Potter staring at him. It's unnerving. Impossible to ignore. As if he’s trying to see right through him and digging out his deepest, darkest secrets. And there are plenty.
Draco wants to ask so badly. 'Is he dead? Is it over yet?' but at the same time, asking such a question seems inelegant, deformative somehow. What he really wants to know, isn't whether his father is dead or not, it's whether he died in disgrace, and alone, and in pain.
This seems to jostle the werewolf into the present. He reaches for the inkwell and tightens his other arm around Harry's shoulders protectively. The countdown starts and Harry feels a familiar tug behind his navel, the Dursleys's living room disappearing in a swirl of colors.
They barely encounter any muggles, there was one with an umbrella that gives them a weird look before hastily moving away from them, and a man growling into his hand that for some reason was held to his ear.
To his great surprise, all the seagulls are still there when Harry has stood up. He can’t recognise a single one of them anymore, but there are still all six of them.
"When may I have this one, master?" the snake had asked him as he’d stroked her head. He rubs his hands vigorously at his pants, to make himself forget the feel of her scales. In the vision, he’d merely tilted his head to the side, regarding the mangled remains of the whimpering man.
"His identification." Harry pushes the card across the table for Draco to see, there’s a tiny square picture of a man, and a series of numbers that don’t really make sense. Draco hums, an identification card, that seems rather smart. Not that he’s going to admit that aloud.
He sweeps into the bag the four nearest vials of Harry’s nerve soothers, stomach clenching at the thought of Harry needing them now more than ever. A couple spare rolls of bandages also go in. Dittany, and the last five vials of pain potions. Severus was supposed to restock the next time he came in.
Draco purses his lips and shakes his head. He doesn’t want to see the damage. But another look from Harry, and he can’t refuse him. How could he? With the determined expression on his pale, too thin face, and hands that are so gentle despite their tremors. He’s taken aback by this.
"Care to tell me what is going on here, Mr. Malfoy?" Draco stares at her, absolutely poised, and still, except for his wide eyes, his half-opened bag still in his hands.
"Thanks," he says and Draco nods back, promptly digging back into his food. Harry doesn't know what the other boy's intention is behind the nice exterior, it's making Harry feel guilty, and all… weird inside. He doesn't know what to call it yet, he stashes it away as he picks on his beans.
Draco stops a few feet away from Harry and raises an eyebrow, trying to emulate Severus but probably failing spectacularly if Harry’s expression is anything to go by.
"Sod off," he sneers back, reeling as he quickly dodges a stunning curse, and prepares to fling a curse in response before the fireplace in Umbridge's office flares green.
Potter is the main priority. Albus had made that very clear, and to be quite frank, Severus doesn’t blame him, Draco might by the snarky look on his face, but Severus doesn’t. He is a grown man with more than a decade of double agency filling up his resume. He is fully aware of the risks and of Potter’s importance. It is imperative that Potter gets out alive. Although, not blaming Albus didn’t mean it was an easy fact to swallow.
"People with nothing to lose.” Contempt and disgust drip from her voice, “And people with nothing to lose are the most dangerous kind."
"Hmm?" Potter has started swaying a little on his feet and looks seconds away from collapsing. Severus shakes his head, he has to hurry.
"No seriously,” Harry twists around, facing Draco, “I don't know about you, but if you ask me, I'd say the scars are kind of like stripes. Like a white tiger's stripes. Metaphorically speaking."
Remus knows Sirius Black more than he knows anyone else. Not like the back of his hand, but rather the veins leading to his heart, like every coherent word in his mind, and every moon cycle day to day.
"Your blood," Severus says, "It's not as thick as it should be. This must have caused the bleeding along with a severe lack of platelets to clot your blood. I know what this is."
"If you say so, Malfoy," he is now cradling his right arm against his chest. Draco peers at him, trying to make out if he is in any pain, but Potter’s face is relaxed.
Malfoy takes it, peering at the damage with pursed lips. "What does she want to do? Carve into your bones and harvest them?"
The door silently creaked open, revealing a narrow gloomy hallway, lit by bubbles of flickering lights attached to the walls, where the wallpapers have long peeled.
Harry is leaning against him, his face lolling against Draco’s collar. Draco can’t smell spices anymore. Just blood. Blood and the acrid smell of dark magic.
You light up at whatever Parkinson is saying, the corners of your mouth curving into a smile. It looks good on you, that smile, so open and genuine. Nothing like the countless smirks and haughty sneers that once were your shining armour. The reflections of the festive fairy lights make your eyes glitter in the dim room, and with that smile adorning your features, you look more relaxed and carefree than I’ve ever seen you before.
“Nightmares, right?” Malfoy finally said, in a quiet tone, and now it was Harry’s turn to be surprised.
“Known to bring luck!” The wandmaker’s words drifted back to him, and Draco desperately wanted to go back in time just to hex him into oblivion.
Once Weasley had turned his back and marched resolutely back over to his girlfriend, Violet finally spoke.
Harry awoke to find Ron and Hermione’s blurry faces peering over him in his bed. He instantly scrambled to sit up and reached around blindly for his glasses. Once he had shoved them onto his face, he exclaimed, “What?”
all over again. I’ve lost count of how many times it’s repeated now. At first, it was alright, I suppose. My life is so boring and repetitive that it didn’t even make much of a difference. But now,” Draco swallowed, trying to tamp down any emotions. “It’s so—I’ve been coming here for days now, to talk to you, and you never remember, but I do. I know you get your tea from the canteen in the morning. I know you hate the sound the interdepartmental memos make when they fly in. I know Eleanor Branstone gets on your last nerve. I know you feel uncomfortable living alone because your house is too quiet. I know you’ve considered getting a cat. I know you prefer quills even though Muggle pens are
“Erm, well,” Hagrid shuffled from foot to foot. “He said tha’ Peeves got into his private storeroom.”
Draco walked over to join them, levitating one of the desk chairs over to sit beside Theo, across from the girls, who were up on the windowseat. On the left, with her long blonde hair falling elegantly over her shoulders, sat Daphne Greengrass, a piece of parchment floating in the air as she perused over it.
Molly huffed. “I like sex as much as the next person, but if you really need to talk about sex right now, Ginny, then perhaps we can talk about that time when your father and I walked in on—”
Draco was puzzled, but he approached the fireplace confidently and smiled at the young Healer-in-Training. “Yes, how can I help you?”
Another fundraising party down, and now the orphanage would hopefully have enough money to build the new playground before spring arrived. It was one of Pansy’s pet charities, and one she always suckered him into helping with. He’d never tell her it was one of his favourites too.
Draco buttoned up his tailored, pale-grey dress shirt and reached for his silver cufflinks on the dresser. The party at the reserve was not fancy, but Draco was still Draco, and he had a smashing fashionista reputation to uphold. Pansy would be there, as would some of the more casual friends from the foundation, and he didn’t want to embarrass himself. He pulled on the burgundy velvet suit jacket over the top, straightening the sleeves and fastening only the centre button before he turned to inspect his reflection in the mirror.
This day was not about him, though. It was about Teddy. And there was nothing Harry wouldn’t do for his godson, even if it involved bumping into every witch and wizard in the country.
Molly tutted, her voice scolding. “You just don’t know Draco, Harry, dear. You’re imagining the boy you knew in the war. This young man is perfectly lovely, and quite attractive too.” Draco thought he might blush at her words but concentrated on keeping his breathing even, not wanting to betray his eavesdropping. “It’s no wonder Charlie loves him. You’ll see.”
Just one word, so definite. Anyone else would only see the defiant confidence you present, in your features, in your voice, in your diction. But behind all that, I notice your clenched jaw and the flicker of uncertainty in your eyes, and I realise why you’ve decided to tell me.
His first instinct was to call her back, but as his eyes skimmed the note, reading the girl’s neat handwriting, his voice got stuck in his throat. Draco blinked. Swallowed. Read it again. And again. Once he remembered how to breathe, how to move, he tore his gaze from the inexplicable words, frowning as he watched the girl’s chestnut ponytail swing from side to side in sync with her retreating steps.
— and pushed off from the doorframe with his shoulder, retreating to the safety of his kitchen as fast as his legs could carry him.
Draco started to laugh, and when Harry joined him — Merlin, but he loved that laugh — a warm, happy feeling spread throughout his chest, and he struggled to catch his breath. “You really have been busy, haven’t you? You must be exhausted.”
Draco gasped as the pad of Harry’s thumb stroked the sensitive skin of his inner thigh, causing a muscle in his left arse cheek — one of the glutes maybe? Draco had no idea, it wasn’t like he’d been able to pay any attention to the content of Harry’s quiet murmurings — to twitch without his permission. Harry stilled midstroke, his hand hot on Draco’s leg as he fell silent, as if choked by the sudden tension crackling in the air between them.
“That was…” Harry begins before realising his vocabulary has been swept away in the flood of emotions.
He raised the cup to his lips and took one first sip, letting out an appreciative moan as his eyes fluttered shut, seemingly of their own volition.
Thanks, by the way, for the image of you muggle-cleaning your way through that ginormous house of yours. (128 rooms? For a family of 3? That’s
“Yes, there is.” Teddy’s defiant glare was enough to wipe the last traces of amusement from Harry’s mind. Had the volunteers going around asking for donations really stooped so low as to…? On Christmas Day?
Besides, sooner or later Lucius must realise disowning his only son won’t help with his obligations to his beloved heritage; if he’s not willing to take Draco back, the ancient Sacred-Twenty-Eight bloodline will die with him. Harry’s pretty sure not even a serious case of raging homophobia will be enough to make Lucius choose to exterminate the Malfoy family name from the face of the earth.
Reaching the doorway, Harry stopped, his eyes immediately drawn to the bearded old man looking down at Harry’s godson with a concerned look on his face. In his signature outfit, he’d surely be the centre of attention anywhere, but where most people would focus on the red velvet fabric and the white fur trim, the black boots and broad leather belt, all Harry could see was the rosy blush on those cheeks, a flush of colour against his white-blond locks, and those perfect happy wrinkles at the corners of his sparkling silver-grey eyes.
Which, in hindsight, probably wasn’t the best thing to do, given the rain that had frozen across the ground.
Draco turned to Charlie. “I’ll let you two talk. I’ve left the bag with your things over there on the table. I noticed the cat food in your coat, and I’ve been stopping by the cottage every day to feed Mushu.”
“I don’t think it’s about the big things, though,” Draco argued. “It’s the little, everyday things that can make you a hero. You care about the dragons every single day.”
been surprisingly pleasant so far. And considering the way Harry was once again topping up their glasses, he didn’t seem all too eager to call it a night either. A fresh bout of anticipation fluttered through Draco’s body at the mere thought.
"Well, that would be unfortunate. But it's my birthday, and I'm waiting for you to fulfil your promise."
“Is that how it is with you and Bill?” The words were barely out of his mouth before he realised how personal the question was. “Sorry,” he added sheepishly, “you don’t have to answer that.”
He expected a laugh, so Harry’s choking cough was a surprise, but ever so much more satisfying. Draco tossed a sly glance over his shoulder and gestured for Harry to follow him back into the living room. He was pretty sure he could feel Harry’s eyes on him the entire way.
Draco frowned at her amused smile and wracked his mind, trying to figure out what she was blabbering about, then remembered thinking something of the sort before he dozed off earlier. Merlin, had he said those things out loud?
useful dating advise. Now I know exactly how to do it once I figure out who to woo… Circe, your fucking useless, arn’t you?
PPS You’re seriously contemplating Esmeralda? As in Quasimodo’s seductive enchantress? How the hell do you figure that to be an appropriate name for my inner snake?
Didn’t know you were such a fan of metamorphmagi. And here you’ve been cousins with one for your entire life without knowing… What a shame. Teddy hasn’t started morphing yet, fortunately. I don’t even want to know what babysitting him will be like once he does.
“But, if you want this”— Draco’s tentative voice brings Harry back to their conversation. —”then why hold back?”
imply she’d hold me responsible for your success, and I wouldn’t want to be the target of her ire were you to fail that exam. But if you have everything under control, then—”
His friends all laughed, and— Dammit, he could even hear Orion's sounds of amusement from the snake’s favoured position wrapped around his upper arm.
“But you’re not him. Listen, I’m speaking from the wisdom of age here. Do not project your own fears and insecurities onto other people. You are not them. Worry about yourself and wait to see what they’ll do. In my experience, people will surprise you more often than not.”
. How could he have forgotten? He’d sat here, joking with two-thirds of the Golden Trio, and he’d fucking forgot. How did one forget Harry Potter? How could he ever have forgotten the boy he’d been circling around for years during his childhood, the man he’d been head-over-heels in love with for half of their eighth year at Hogwarts? Not that he had ever let his stupid crush be known by anyone, of course — not even Pansy.
Feeling very pleased with himself, Harry smirked and returned to his task, placing the last cup in the plate rack before turning off the tap. He reached for a towel to dry his hands and when he next chanced a glance Draco’s way, the man was looking pensive. Not wanting to be caught staring, Harry busied himself with wiping off immaculate counters while he waited for Draco to sort out his thoughts, intent on letting him be the one to eventually break the silence between them. When Draco did, his voice was soft and hesitant.
“Thanks,” you say, and it’s all I can do to not reach out and touch you, to wrap my hand around your arm, your wrist, your hand. “You’re the best friend a gay pure-blood could ever have.”
“Oh, Draco.” The man frowned and reached out to place a hand on Draco’s foot over the covers, squeezing it gently. “Never think for a minute that your parents don’t love you. They do. You mean the world to them and I know it.”
“Wait,” he manages before his mind is clued in to the soft flesh under his touch, the smooth skin, the pleasant warmth. Without letting go, he hastily — and far from elegantly — gets to his feet, spreading his fingers over Draco’s skin as he takes a step closer. “I just need to know for sure.”
Draco let a similar smile cross his own face, seeing Charlie in his mind. “His kind, blue eyes, when he smiles and greets someone. No matter how much of a hurry he’s in, he always makes time to say hi and meet their eyes, like they’re important.”
Harry nods. “In my dreams at first, and then later when I bumped into you in the corridors. Nothing like this, though. Nothing like tonight.”
He walked as was his habit these days, with a clear goal in mind, always on the lookout but avoiding everyone’s gaze, always afraid anyone who met his eyes would be able to figure out his deepest, darkest secrets. He had so many of those these days, too many secrets creeping up on him from every angle, curling their tendrils around his limbs, entangling him, suffocating him — much like the vines of a lethal Devil’s Snare.
Then he feels it. A pulling sensation in his chest, like a rubber band constricting, urging him to get up, urging him towards…
“Well, I suppose if you’re counting the effort I put into discrediting you and accused you of lying to everyone… And let’s not forget the time when you were kindly helping me move all the firework equipment, and I showed my appreciation by insulting you. Or, maybe you’re talking about when I accused you of flirting with your neighbour and then proceeded to announce to all your friends and colleagues that you were pregnant?”
“Yeah.” Harry bit his lip, trying not to lose his train of thought as a fresh wave of heat pooled in the pit of his stomach. “You know, that day in Diagon Alley… I even had half a mind to cross that stage and sit down in your lap myself, just for one last chance to be close to you before you left.”
Regarding the conditions of your mother’s house arrest, I haven’t heard anything final from Shacklebolt yet, but I’ll be sure to let you know as soon as I do.
“Right.” Draco nods decidedly. “I… I’ll be back… I’ll just…” He motions with the flower before disappearing into the kitchen without another word.
When Harry eventually tuned in to the conversation again, he realised Teddy had started repeating himself in his sleepiness, no longer making much sense but blabbering on nonetheless.
Entering the hospital room again felt strange. After yesterday, when it had been filled to the brim with people, it just seemed…empty. The steady beeps from the monitoring charms comforted him, though, and Draco examined Charlie’s sleeping face.
I don’t have the first idea how to go about earning a house’s trust, though, so any helpful pointers you might have to offer this clueless friend of yours would be most appreciated. I still have a couple of weeks left here before I plan to take the erumpent by the horn, but with your reassurance that the miserable state of the place might not be permanent, I’m feeling a bit less reluctant to at least give it a try.
Harry stared a moment, taking that in, and then changed tactics. “What is Charlie’s favourite food?”
,” Draco groans, breathless, as Harry leaves a trail of kisses along his clean-shaven jaw, nipping, licking, sucking his way down the side of Draco’s neck. “Fuck, Harry, I…”
find this new, grown-up version of the guy disturbingly attractive too. So what? It wasn’t like it mattered or anything. No way could
Draco felt a fluttery warmth spread through his body, and he was grateful no one was there to witness the goofy grin overtaking his face. Before he had time to reply, another text popped up on the screen.
Draco moaned; a delicious sound that reverberated through Harry’s body like wildfire. Harry’s common sense was quickly crumbling to dust, and he knew that if he didn’t do something now, they’d be shagging openly right there in the kitchen within minutes.
Draco’s heart clenched with guilt as he recalled Wood’s comment about their arrangement and his assertion it’d be ending with Charlie’s marriage.
“It’s true,” she continued. “He jumped into the dragon paddock and pulled Charlie out. Got close enough to singe his own hair.” She had a proud smile on her face, as if Draco belonged to her in some way and she wanted everyone to know just how wonderful he was. Fucking Hufflepuffs.
And if it is, Hermione knows about it too. I’ve caught her shooting daggers at him several times already, ‘surreptitiously’ hinting in my direction as if she's urging him to tell me whatever it is. She thinks I don’t notice it, but I do. And frankly, it’s starting to freak me out a little bit. I’ve tried to come up with ideas for what it could possibly be, but I can’t think of anything, other than it must be something bad — otherwise, he wouldn’t hesitate to tell me, would he? I may just be overthinking it, but one thing I’ve learnt these past few years is that I should trust my gut and right now it’s hard to ignore.
“Ah, yeah, sorry.” Harry cleared his throat, regrettably banishing the sexy roughness from his voice. “We’re supposed to be able to name and locate all the muscles in a human body.”
He lets out a deep breath and wills himself to relax. "Okay, I'm ready. You can go on," he says, and his voice sounds weird — all rough and breathy.
Bill Weasley cleared his throat. “I think we’d all like to hear about that, actually. How did you and Charlie meet?”
They stumbled up the stairs, eager to reach their destination posthaste and yet unable to keep their hands off each other.
“I’m sure he won’t,” Draco assured him, to which Harry quirked an eyebrow in question. ”Because he knows he’ll have to answer to me if he does.”
I can easily see you in all the professions you mention, and I’m just as certain you’d excel at any of them as I am about me not doing so. I am
Thank Merlin Teddy had insisted on staying with him in London, or Harry would probably have spent Christmas evening sobbing pathetically into a pillow all by his lonesome.
Draco shook his head, but Sirius stepped forward and conjured a chair next to Molly. “Go on. What she’s not saying is that’ll do
” Ron’s squeak echoed Draco’s sentiment, sounding just as shocked as Draco felt. Everyone else started to chatter excitedly, and Molly’s voice rose above the rest.
But there were no Malfoys anymore. Just one Malfoy. Just him, alone in London at one in the morning on a Thursday night, impeccably dressed but with no one on his arm. Nobody to laugh with him, to share his joy.
Draco was once again thankful for his upbringing, the ability to hide his reactions second nature to him. Internally, though, he was reeling with the shock of seeing Potter —
Draco stood at the window, looking out over the rain-drenched mountains that surrounded the Reserve. It was cold, and wet, and miserable. And he was stuck here. Alone. On Christmas.
"Harry!" Harry feels Draco's balls grow firm under his hand, and he moans in anticipation. "I'm close, I— I'm gonna come."
Draco managed to stay not-at-all-intrigued for several hours, distracting himself with inventory and a very-much-needed deep clean of the espresso machine after closing time. (Well, the “very-much-needed” part may have referred more to Draco’s need to delay the inevitable than anything else — he’d gone through the bi-weekly cleaning routine just this past Sunday, after all — but, yeah. Very much needed.) He made it all the way to nine pm before he eventually caved.
Friday afternoons were never busy at the coffee shop. People had other things to worry about; family dinners, weekend trips, pub crawls, club night preparations… Not that Draco knew much about any of that, but he’d heard enough from his colleagues over the years to get the general picture. Sure, he was no stranger to the gay club scene, and he usually enjoyed it once he went out, but it wasn’t exactly a regular occurrence in his life or anything. The physical need for a hookup seldom overrode the comfort of a quiet evening at home, after all, and as for the rest, well, it wasn’t like Draco had anyone to experience any of that with, was there?
One final step, and then Potter took Draco in his arms, embracing him, and Draco’s entire world shattered. With his head on Potter’s shoulder, Draco let himself fall apart, wetting Potter’s shirt with his tears as he clung to Potter for dear life. Draco shook as months’, if not years’ worth of fear, angst, and desperation broke through the carefully constructed barriers he always worked so hard to keep up. He was a fucking mess, but Potter didn’t shy away. Instead, he held him, rubbing soothing circles over Draco’s back, stroking his hair, mumbling nonsense, and patiently calming him down.
“Yeah, I managed to fit it all into just the four boxes, so only one more.” They stepped down off the porch of the shed and back into the freezing rain. Harry peered into the darkness, scanning the grounds for Merlin knew what. A glimpse of a dragon perhaps, as if they weren’t fast asleep in their caves at this hour. “So what about you?” he asked without looking at Draco. “What made you work here at the Reserve? I would’ve imagined you’d be doing something…more.”
She fluttered her eyelashes and Draco wanted to grimace, but his manners won out. If only she realised that he was already hung up on someone else and that a cute fluttering of fake eyelashes wasn’t ever going to attract his interest.
“Yeah,” Harry wheezed through the last remnants of his laughter, “I’m really sorry about all that, though.” He paused for a moment and then grew more serious. “Listen, Draco. I really think you’re a great guy, and I’m glad you and Charlie found each other. Truly.”
Harry makes a decision then. His stomach churns just thinking about it, but if it can get Draco to drop the conversation, he might be willing to offer the man a tiny sliver of the mortifying truth. He can’t look at him, though, or there’d be a good chance Draco will be able to read the unspoken words in his eyes. Instead, he keeps his gaze in his lap, watching his knuckles whitening from the firm clutch on his mug as he speaks.
Draco glanced at the black box standing on the side table next to his untouched book. He’d broken about a dozen Ministry regulations by bringing it home from the Department of Mysteries tonight, but uncharacteristically enough, he hadn’t been thwarted by the risk of any possible repercussions this time. He’d always known he would do it once this day arrived. Always known this moment would eventually come.
Draco isn’t far behind, grunting out his orgasm just as Harry’s tense muscles begin to relax, post-coital bliss overtaking him and rendering him a boneless puddle of goo in Draco’s arms.
I still haven’t told anyone else, by the way, and I don’t even have any good arguments for holding off. At this point, I guess it’s mostly about the concern of their well-being since I can’t guarantee they won’t pop a vein or have a heart attack once I break the news. Merlin, I really should have told them from the start, shouldn’t I? So much for Gryffindor courage. Just keeping my fingers crossed Nott and Zabini will be able to keep their mouths shut until I get my thumb out of my arse; I don’t even want to think about what would happen if Ron and Hermione found out from them instead of me.
“And Potter?” Harry stopped halfway up the stairs and turned to seek out Zabini in the crowd. “Fetch Draco, will you?”
And no, you’re not going to go insane, Malfoy. You’re much too stubborn to let that happen, and you only have eight months left now; you can do it.
“And whyever not?” Draco was already irritated, but the fact that he had to tilt his head up just the slightest with Harry this close up was just infuriating.
"Well," Draco's voice whispers into Harry's ear. They are chest to chest, skin on skin, and Harry can feel the ebb and flow of Draco's breaths, each one even with Harry's own. Driven by want and curiosity, Harry tentatively releases a hand from around Draco's shoulders, smiling as he realises Draco's grasp is secure. He runs his fingers over Draco's jaw, down his neck, and finds a nipple surrounded by a light dusting of hair. Harry leans his head down, greedy for a taste, and flicks it with his tongue, making Draco's breath hitch.
“I don’t have anything to treat your condition for now, the bathroom cabinet is stocked with some essentials, don’t be sparse while using it on yourself or Draco, this curse is as painful as it gets, at least until the effects have somewhat worn off.” Severus presses another clean rag to Draco’s shoulder, pulling out a vial of Pain Reliever with his other hand, “You need to stay hydrated yourself, don’t handle heavy weight, and avoid highly stressful situations. Which you will have to anyway.” He spells the potion directly in Draco’s stomach before replacing the now bloody rag with another, this one soaked in some disinfectant.
“Right,” he mutters, wincing when the gauze sticks a little to his injury, which still has the annoying tendency of spontaneously oozing blood at random inconvenient moments.
“He is still a werewolf and I might be one too,” Draco’s voice is flat and not half as bad as he’d expected.
Harry reaches for Sirius, as illogical as that move proves to be, seeing as Sirius can't physically grab his hand and haul him back to safety. He scratches at the hand on his face, and drags his shoes in the sand.
Chapter warnings for; implied/referenced child abuse, torture, explicit language and disturbing imagery.
He wouldn't have thought twice about this if he were the Draco from before. But each step to the store's counter makes him feel as if his shoes are made of lead.
They had it coming, in all fairness. If anything, Evan personally thinks that an explosion was too much of a mercy. Too impersonal almost. But that was the way his Lord desired it to be done and Evan was in no place to argue.
Taking in a deep bracing breath, he looks down at the shell. The burning shell, a sensation he’s gotten used to over the last few minutes, dulled by the panic. Swallowing thickly, he enunciates the spell, unwilling to let the terror fuck the spell up.
"I'm really not," Harry is actually five minutes early because of the same shit Umbridge pulled yesterday. There's no way that he's late. Umbridge, as if waiting for him to say those exact words, gives him a Grinch-like smile and turns her golden desk clock for Harry to see, exactly five minutes past five.
"Oh no," he says again, like a fucking idiot, "This is not the kind I wanted. Sorry for bothering you."
He spots the shoe too late for his sharp, quick-witted instincts. It's half-buried in the sand, overturned and it's not Draco's.
Chapter warnings for; graphic imagery and disturbing themes, explicit language, panic attacks, drowning, graphic implied/referenced torture, descriptions of illness and injury, vomiting.
"Well,” Hermione bites her lips, wringing her hands and looking nervously from Ron to Sirius, “You don't have to say it to his face--"
"You're late," she says, her teaspoon annoyingly clinking against her china cup, Harry stitches his eyes to the clinking spoon and wishes it to combust in her hand, but then moves his gaze so as to not actually cause a debacle like that. He has a feeling that it won’t pass overlooked the same way as Aunt Marge’s incident had.
He shakes his head. Harry still hasn’t asked about how Draco found him. He doesn’t know how Harry will react to that breach in personal boundaries, whether he'll get rid of the shell necklace, forgets all about kissing Draco, leaves him to rot amongst muggles.
Remus opens his mouth to call out but is drowned out again by an agitated Molly Weasley shrieking louder than the screaming portrait. "Sirius, for the love of heavens above!" she cries. "Stop pacing!"
"You babble too much," Rosier rolls his own eyes. "You know...when I'm done with you, I'm not going to keep you in the same place as my uncle is resting." He rounds Harry like a predator circling its prey.
"My potion master, my precious double agent is also gone, so is a valuable flood of information that I was gathering of Albus Dumbledore and the boys you kidnapped," Evan cannot understand a thing he's hearing anymore.
"I know I'm counting right," he is. He was. He knows where he left off, he just- he has to just recall it right. There’s nothing wrong with his memory.
Severus doesn't do anything for a beat, and then he moves as if to take the vial but instead seizes Potter's wrist and pulls the whole boy forward as Harry squeaks in surprise.
John tries to keep his expression the same as it was before. "Vague reports thus far indicate a Death Eater attack in the muggle community occurring yesterday afternoon, taking the lives of ten muggles, three of which were relatives of the Boy-who-Lived, or they are claimed to be as such, do you confirm this statement?"
"I'm saying that Albus Dumbledore, while having the best intentions at heart, is using a child's severe traumatic experience in order to further his cause in the Ministry, John. I'm not sure you've met the boy yourself… a very fine lad. Too impressionable. As is the habit of children."
"They've been incorrigible lately," she tells him now, over her steaming cup of tea, Remus is gazing at the fogged window, raindrops patter against the glass, "I really can't afford them doing something foolish when I am not there to…"
"I would call it a careless bout of foolishness, John. This is clearly the work of a sole fanatic." Fudge discreetly reaches for another scone, and John watches, only watches for a moment before he can trust himself to speak.
We were so so excited for this chapter in particular, in fact we could barely wait for this update, it was so much fun to write! We sure had our fun exploring inside Harry’s head :)
He counts again as each sentence is scratched out, and somehow even his pain muddled brain is chastising him for expecting different results. It's always going to be five words, sixteen letters, six vowels, and ten consonants. It's not going to change, no matter how hard Harry wishes it to lessen.
"No. You're not coming," Aunt Petunia drops her rag with a curl of her lip. "You're staying here, boy,"
Mrs. Weasley smiles. "Great! I'll send you up a plate too, in case you felt like eating later. Ronnie does it all the time,"
He supposes he should be proud of himself for pulling the apparition off so smoothly, considering the most he’d done before had been from one end of the Manor to another. But the worry encompassing his mind is too great, and right now he’s only grateful he didn’t fuck up even this.
"I don't know about that," Bill replies as Harry rummages through the cupboards. "Mom sings his praises all the time. According to her, Harry's the best-behaved boy she knows."
the scathing remark, almost certainly something idiotic, forming in his head, so Severus cuts him off. "I have taught you for over four years now, Potter. I dealt with other teenagers for longer. So out with it already."
Draco didn't want him to think he's to blame. He needs Harry to know how much Draco wishes he was the one who killed his awful relatives. "No. Don't be sorry," he shuffles closer to Harry, "I just…." His teeth clatter, from the cold and the rage. "I'm just so fucking glad she's dead."
Draco can only recall two things off the top of his head. The first one is the fucking knife, and his shoulder. The second is Harry.
Remus barely nods and disappears from Harry's view as he quickly hurries up to his room, somewhat embarrassed that a total stranger can see the numerous locks bolted on his door. He ignores the locks and barges in his room, his eyes narrowed in concentration.
Because he will, of course Potter's going to tattle to Dumbledore, but Draco will be ready by then. Potter provoked him, Potter is asking for it, and Draco cannot wait to set the bastard back in his place.
Draco just sort of stares at Harry for a few seconds, trying to keep up with him. The scars as tiger stripes, well. That’s certainly nice imagery, and if only it had been true. And if Harry already thinks of them like that... "How do you think of this stuff? I don't mean it in a bad way, it's just… I never would have thought of that in a million years."
It wasn't just Evan. There had been others. Bella was the worst. She had absolutely mauled the Potter boy, oh Evan knew, the brat would never be the same again, Evan knows this, but he cannot say so, he cannot breath and he doesn't dare utter a word.
"Oh,” Harry flushes red, “Actually, that was... something. There was no second base. I don't know what was wrong with me. Sweetie?"
He walks, and just… keeps walking. With no particular destination in mind. It's quiet, and no neighbors, despite whatever Aunt Petunia might think, are peeking out their windows to stare at the 'unstable boy that the Dursleys were so gracious to take in'. Harry thinks that they're too busy living their lives to bother themselves with Aunt Petunia's words.
Evan doesn't care, he wants to die, he wants his voice back so he can pray to a god he doesn't believe in to save him, he wants his
The foot is suddenly lifted and Evan shudders, gasping and panting and sputtering for air. His throat is clogged with the same blood that pools in his mouth, partially closing his airway, but he doesn't care, he heaves and coughs, rolls on the floor and cries like a small child.
Of course he wouldn't. Psychological torture has already begun taking effect. A classic method too, Severus should have predicted this beforehand.
"You joined the forces," Harry gasps mockingly, scrunching up the empty bag of chips in his hands. A faint cramp runs through his palms.
Severus is more than sure that calling Minerva’s outburst simple ‘shouting’ is a grievous understatement. Both regarding her heart, and Severus’s now spilled tea.
"Where were you?!" Umbridge cries, finally standing over a stunned Potter, and Draco sighs. Rosier's eyes are still on him, before he throws an irritated glance at Umbridge. "You've wasted three full days, still unable to get the Dark Lord's work done, and then couldn't even come to aid me?"
"You're making a mistake," Rosier grits around her grip and the woman chuckles. She actually pats his ruined cheek. Harry watches through blurred gaze in morbid fascination. The edges of his vision have started darkening.
“But you couldn’t be worth more than a mudblood living in muck," he hisses, leaning closer to her than he ever wishes to be. “At least your mother knows exactly what role she serves. The Dark Lord’s Knight in his elaborate game of chess.” her breath hitches, and Draco carries on. “We're all just pawns to him. Me. You. Cedric Diggory. My mother.” He purses his lips, his jaw clenching to stop himself from giving anything away. Pansy doesn’t know. Nobody knows. Draco should be more careful.
Or maybe his mind is just that twisted enough to think of the spells, ones so fundamentally gut-wrenching that bile starts rising up in his throat again, he prays for that not to be the case, wishes that maybe he has read them somewhere and promptly forgotten about them because of how horrible they were.
He presses his fist tighter against his mouth, trying to repress the urge to vomit, burrowing himself further in the sweat-soaked covers, his other hand clutches his wand so tightly that his fingers cramp.
"And we just asked for your advice because we need new defensive spells and Hermione is running out of books."
"Don't say sorry. I'm not,” he lets go of Draco’s hand and stands up. “Let's go buy stuff in the snack booth."
"I think we should put a ration aside for them," Harry says, finally getting to his feet. The seagulls crowd the kitchen floor, screeching and rubbing themselves all over Potter.
"I told you," Draco cheeks, narrowing his eyes at Umbridge's flushed, enraged face. "You're nothing."
Their rhythm is abruptly disrupted when a male voice clears his throat, knocking on a nearby desk to get his attention. Tonks's, as it happens, the woman growls at the intruder.
“Draco,” Harry whispers, and his gaze is boring into Draco’s. The way it does, sometimes. As if he’s seeing right into him. He wants to bury his face into Harry’s neck and sob. Wonders if Harry will allow it or push him away because Draco’s getting too intimate.
We have to remember that Ron and Hermione are doing the best they can in the given circumstances; they are children, and not trained or exposed to deal with Trauma in other people their age, also the time period in which this story is set in, sadly lacks the widespread knowledge about mental health and proper treatment for them, and while Ron and Hermione's phrasing might come off as offensive they do care about Harry very much.
"Potter!" Severus’s slightly raised voice startles Draco from his pain hazed daze and he looked up to see Harry emerge from the kitchen.
Harry had cackled under his breath; he couldn't fathom why he would have, the scene before him was horrific, absolutely nauseating, and he was forced to watch every minute of it. It filled his chest with a clash of conflicting emotions, threatening to drown him under a wave of fear and despair. He didn't know Narcissa Malfoy and he didn't particularly like her son either… but he wouldn't wish such a horrible death on her either.
"Whiny little brat," Evan spits, presumably surveying the injuries Harry has inflicted during their trip. Harry fists his hands.
funny, though. Because one of Slytherin’s prominent qualities is self-preservation, and Draco is nothing if not a Slytherin.
He opens his mouth on impulse, almost asking 'was it quick? ' but then stops himself at the cusp of time as Harry picks up the steaming pot and rushes over to the sink, to drain the carrots. He and Severus watch Harry fumble with the hot pot.
The woman in mask strides closer, and Rosier raises Harry's wand but she's too quick. Harry isn't exactly sure what's going on, because one moment they're just standing, and the next Rosier is kneeling next to Harry clutching his hand and howling in pain.
Interlude Warnings for; explicit language, torture (hinted at), Umbridge, which should come with her own warning.
And when Draco acts as if he wants him, Harry feels sugar cubes melting in his chest. So even in sleep, in the calm lull of the moving train, when Draco holds him, Harry feels marginally calm.
"It wasn't as if we knew," Bill mumbles, being the first one who looks away from Harry's tense form.
' I don't know, Jamie Junior, ' the Sirius in his head starts, rather unhelpfully. ' I can see you pulling off the perfect crime. You won't even have to use your wand,'
His eyes go to the large clock hanging on the wall, ticking almost ominously, the pendulum below is swinging back and forth in a monotonous rhythm.
Merlin and Circe damn Greyback. Damn him to the nine depths of hell for doing this to Narcissa's son, to Severus'
"Harry is fine,” Remus says firmly, but he knows that he's trying to convince himself as much as Sirius. They’ve not received any correspondence. The only information they have has been via Snape and Moody. “Sirius we've talked about this, both Albus and Snape--"
"You should be thankful, that I'm sparing your life," his lord says before hissing another order at Nagini and miraculously enough, the giant reptile actually starts crawling away from him. "I'm granting you your life, for you to cherish and remember how merciful your Lord can be, even to worthless slugs like you."
"Moody! How long were you...?" Tonks says, her voice slightly alarmed as if she too, had been caught off guard by his sudden yell. There were very few who weren't.
Draco can honestly say that this is the most he’s ever walked in one go. The ache in his legs is almost starting to rival his shoulder. He glances at Harry and the other boy looks content as ever, not even breathing harder than before.
Harry swallows visibly, and makes no move to pull his hand away from Draco’s. Instead, he slips it down and intertwines his fingers with Draco’s. The grip is weak and shaky, but he holds his hand.
"Professor Umbridge," Harry says, trying to repress every ounce of hatred and foulness he would have liked to pour into those words. In Umbridge's place, in Harry’s head, sat the great pink toad, in her too-tight pink cardigan and shrieking voice. The cat adorned plates covering every inch of the circular office doesn't aid her image much either.
Harry winces, shoving his wand back in his jeans. His back aches, and there's a crick in his neck. His legs are prickling with the standard pins and needles sensation. He'd fallen asleep on the floor.
'Shut up, Sirius,' Harry snaps and holds his bleeding hand for inspection, trying not to hurl in disgust as her clammy hand clutches his and she hums. A carefully aimed
He's surprised by it but decides to embrace it like an old friend. It’s better than being a sitting duck and letting things happen to him.
Remus rubs his nose, "Exactly, Hermione. You two have done way worse, as an ex-teacher myself I'll admit that teaching a bunch of children isn't easy. Teaching them as children?" He sighs, "That's a whole other argument."
Harry pays the fair, even though it sounded a bit overpriced, gets the tickets, and rejoins Draco on the benches. Their bus should arrive in twenty minutes, and thankfully, the benches are empty enough. There's only a lady with her poodle, occupying the seats except for them.
"Traitors are to be punished with no deliberation." the man cuts in. "Dumbledore is as good as gone. We're taking the boy." he sneers at Draco over his shoulder, "And you,"
Harry grapples at the hands, the one blocking his mouth is hard enough to bruise, and his scalp prickles as Rosier starts pulling him backwards. Further away from the wards.
Severus barely manages not to startle as the floo flares up behind them. No one ever uses this floo. This is a safe house, only three people other than Albus and him know about it. He’s still surprised to hear his voice.
Harry laughs around the spoon in his mouth. "We don't need to,” he wheezes, “We just push them through the mail box slot in the street. It gets back to them from there."
And then he steps outside the compartment, slides the door close behind him. And it's just Harry, silently letting the tears fall in Draco's arms.
Kingsley passes them and dodges a low hanging paper plane before ducking into the cramped elevator, the golden gates closing the chaos before his eyes.
"Why waste anyway?" Draco rolls his eyes, slightly amused, "You promised me apple pie just yesterday, or were you fibbing?"
“Now, isn’t that tear jerking?” a foreign voice drawls. Rosier’s eyes are narrowed and his wand lazily points to Lucius as he leans against the fireplace, his other hand dusting off soot. It's because of years of experience as both a Death Eater and a spy that Severus keeps from letting out a litany of profanities from his mouth. Potter has no such reservations as he stumbles back, almost plopping to the floor before steadying himself against the wall.
When Harry is done he settles back on his heels, discarding the bloodied strip, and looks over at Draco, gaze settling on his blood soaked shirt.

It infuriates Draco to no end, but he doesn't say anything regarding Potter's haphazard lifestyle. At least he's not leaving wet towels all over the floor, and that's more than good enough for Draco at the moment.
"So this statement further confirms your last, regarding Harry Potter and Albus Dumbledore's claims… claims that indicated You-Know-Who has returned and was responsible for the death of a seventeen-year-old student, namely one Cedric Diggory?"
