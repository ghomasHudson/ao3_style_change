Malfoy refused to acknowledge his presence. Harry took his wrist and applied the salve gently covering the damaged skin. Malfoy held his breath. All this was too much. Too much of Potter, too much of rules and he still didn’t understand where he stood. What was the purpose? The fuck Potter wanted from him? He had too many questions and no answers. And at the moment he didn’t want to think. He was already tired from their small banter. He simply didn’t have any energy left.
His voice was trembling his eyes were looking at Potter searching, looking for his reaction and looking for the wand.
Some people were good for getting the job done where violence was a priority, but here he needed a person who knew what compassion meant. Brown was a perfect candidate for that but guess what, he had almost every bone in his body broken, a severe concussion and on top of that an unknown spell was cursed at him. Luck was not on his side and it looked like it wasn’t on Potter’s side either.
Potter helped him walk out of the cell shut the door and together they went back to the exit. Malfoy was walking slow but it was already good that he was walking at all. He was so cold and he looked horrible. His clothes were damaged, the hair was long but so dirty and it lost completely its color. His skin was grayish and felt clammy to the touch. He was so thin you could easily see the blue lines of veins on his hands.
“Mungo's happened. Brown will stay there for two more months, no less. Trying to parkour from the seventh floor while chasing a skilled dark art vigilant is not a good idea. Anyway, I am here to pick him up,” Harry handed him the paper.
Fuck. Of course. Potter. He should have connected the dots. Auror, green eyes and dark hair he remembered that. He closed his eyes with his hand. Fuck. Why him? Why this guy? His heart was accelerating. And Potter was the one who helped him. Helped him in the bathroom. Helped him heal his bruised ribs. His cheeks reddened.
He felt better for a while and he was taken to a chamber, corridors, mold and dripping water. And after that warm hands. Fuck. Where the hell was he and who brought him here. He didn’t know who, and he didn’t know what to expect from them.
He took the one from the top and scanned it through. A release paper from Azkaban for Draco Malfoy. He was surprised to see the familiar name. He looked through the papers. Malfoy was supposed to be released two days ago from Azkaban and was already supposed to be under Brown's parole. But Auror Brown was in Saint Mungo’s spell damage department. He was cursed badly and will be confined to bed for his stupidity no less than for two months.
“Hey, I want you to take a bath first, we need to get you clean, afterwards we’ll have dinner and you can go straight to bed. Alright?”
Draco woke up disoriented. The pillow was so soft, he actually slept in a cozy bed. He couldn’t remember when was the last time that happened to him. He still felt tired. His body was exhausted and his mind was jumbled. He spent six months in Azkaban but it felt like years. The cold of that place was imprinted in his bones in his core.
“Can’t say the same, Dallahad, I’d be so much happier if I didn’t see your ugly face at least for a month.”
Potter brought him upstairs opened one of the doors this was Regulus Black’s bedroom. It looked nice and clean everything was in green colors, it definitely suited Malfoy.
He didn’t have a chance to answer as Harry dragged him by the hand from the bed. He was done with all the banter. He put his hand around Malfoy’s waist and in ten steps they were near the bathroom door. Malfoy was breathing heavily barely moving his legs. He didn’t say anything during their small walk he gripped Potter with all his strength, trying to prove that he could actually walk and failed at it miserably. Potter didn’t say anything, thank Merlin. He helped him into the bathroom and gave Draco some privacy.
“Good. Listen, it doesn’t have to be this difficult, you just follow the rules, behave and that’s it, as simple as that. I am not going to hurt you in any way. Got it? I am not going to curse you or hit you.”
“All looks good boss, go on, I will open the wards for you in a minute. I must say the Malfoy guy is barely breathing, thought, they gave him the calming drought or something stronger, a bit overdid it to be honest.”
Harry took of his shoes, helped Malfoy do the same and unfastened the robe, taking it of Malfoy. He lead him straight to the bathroom.
“Malfoy, calm down. I get it, you’re not happy to see me at all.” Potter came closer to his bed and picked up the glass from the floor.
“Help yourself. If you need anything ask Kreacher. If it is an emergency ask him as well. Kreacher will get to me as soon as possible.”
Draco was confused. He tried to get away as far as possible from Potter pressing his back into the bed’s headboard. He didn’t have a wand. He was so weak he couldn’t defend himself in any possible way.
Somebody helped him, steadied him. Merlin somebody actually helped him bathe, that was so embarrassing. And somebody familiar. A man.
“Kreacher, make sure he’s alright. Let me know when he wakes up. Bring a glass of water and leave it on the bedside table. Thank you.”
Harry helped Draco up. They walked together to the steps that led upstairs. It was definitely hard for Malfoy to go up the stairs so there was no other choice. Harry picked him up and used a partial levitation charm to make him lighter.
He drained the water from the tub and turned on the shower, washing off the foam and dirt away. Next Potter spelled the scissors to cut the nails on both hands and feet. “Be careful with you fingers and toes, no unexpected movements, Ok?” He looked at Malfoy but didn’t get much of a reaction. After the bath and some good scrubbing he looked much better. His ribs were bruised though and he had some scratches over his body, his Dark Mark was covered with bruises and small cuts and scratches. Some of the skin looked badly inflamed. But other than that there wasn’t any serious damage done to his body. And that was good. Bruises and scratches can be dealt with.
Potter looked at his bathrobe. With only a wave of his hand it transfigured into a comfortable pajamas.
“Ok, all done! Let’s get some food in you.” Potter exhaled and dragged him out of the bathroom to the dining room. He helped him sit down. Kreacher has already served the table.
Today was difficult yes but that was only the beginning. Tomorrow it will be even worse. Malfoy is not a person who will play easily. Harry had to think it through and find the best way how to deal with him. But for now it was already time to go to bed. He still had to take a quick shower himself.
Harry opened the balm lid. It smelled good, like mint, freshly cut grass and herbs. The balm was cold to the touch. Harry unfastened Draco’s robe, dipped his fingers with the salve, and spread a general amount of it on his bruised ribs. His skin was so soft to the touch and no more freezingly cold.
“As a matter of fact, I couldn’t. Well, you were assigned to another Auror, I must say. But things turned out in a different way. Anyway we will discuss things later on. You are not in a condition for a proper talk right now. Malfoy, stop it.”
“Malfoy, I’m here to pick you up under the Minister’s order we signed you up for the recovery program, you were supposed to be on the Brown’s parole but things changed. From today you will be under my direct supervision. Malfoy, can you hear me? Do you understand what I’m saying?”
“See you in five. Send Casy to his work place for the personal belongings check out. Get the stuff ready.” Potter turned and went towards the corridor on the left side.
He could sign up Malcom for that or Ethan. Both were bad choices. Malcom didn’t give a shit about the new recovery program. Malfoy will end up back in Azkaban for another year with him just after a week. Ethan was a bulky guy that will beat the shit out of Malfoy, so he will probably end up dead or crippled for life with him.
Potter headed for the door not looking at Draco. The door closed and Malfoy could finally relax a bit. Potter had such a strong aura around him. The air was still electrified with his magic. And the git didn’t even have a wand on him.
The washing was done, Potter helped him get out of the bath, providing the support for his body and holding him tight, as both their hands were wet and slippery. His hands landed several times on his hips and his waist. He took one of the white towels and wrapped Malfoy up with the soft fabric.
Potter took the key out of his pocket and opened the cell. Malfoy didn’t move at all he didn't show any signs of recognition it looked like he didn't even see Potter. Harry came closer.
He didn’t even notice. His nails left red crescent marks and scratches on his forearm and some were starting to fill with blood.
Harry skipped lunch that day so he was very hungry and giving a bath to Malfoy was also a tiring process. He started eating but Malfoy couldn’t even pick up his spoon. Potter spelled the spoon to feed Draco. And the man started to slowly sip on the warm soup. Harry doubted that he had some food that day. And in Azkaban they definitely didn’t feed them well. He couldn’t give Malfoy some big amounts of food, it had to be something light and easy on the stomach.
Malfoy was looking at him with dazed gray eyes. After a moment it seemed like he understood him and nodded.
Today Jake Hauls was on parole. A tall lean man with short black hair and sharp eyes. He was sitting in front of a huge wall of screens drinking hot green tea, checking the footage and typing in some information.
“Listen, it might not look good from your point right now. But it could have been worse for starters.”
“Worse? Really? How the fuck can it be even worse? I am under one roof with my nemesis. I can barely stand for myself. And you can… you can basically do whatever you want to with me. You’re now what? Deputy Auror?”
“Yes, Kreacher, dinner in 20 minutes, something light, chicken soup will do. And get me a set of fresh towels, slippers and a bathrobe.”
“Listen, I am not going to guard you 24/7 in here. I have other important thins on my agenda. It’s very simple for now. Eat what you are given get your strength back. If you have some preferences in food let Kreacher know. You don’t look healthy and I want to change that.
It was a simple thing to do. But his feet were so weak and his body refused to listen to him. He flushed the toilet. Washed his hands and his face. Draco looked at his reflection in the mirror, he didn’t see himself what felt like for ages. He was too thin and too pale. His hair more gray than blond. He looked horrible. Draco sighed averted his eyes from his image. Washed his face and took a towel to dry the droplets off his face.
Bathing a grown up man wasn’t an easy task to do. Harry had to roll his sleeves up at the beginning of the ordeal but he still managed to get himself wet in the process. He also felt a bit uncomfortable. It’s not like you give a bath to a guy your own age every day. Of course he had to learn how to do that when Teddy was smaller. But that was long ago and that was different.
Weasley and Delaver were on a case. Malfoy would probably slit his wrists if he was given to a Weasley. And Ron is a good friend, yes, but he will drive Harry crazy with all the Malfoy whining problem.
The elevator brought him to the minus four floor. It was always cold in here. Small stuffy rooms, long corridors, dimmed shimmering lights the smell of mold that’s how it felt to be down here. Plus constant dripping of water from one of the cells. This was not a good place, a place where bad interrogations were held if needed be, a place that had constant twenty four hour security and best wards in the whole Auror Department.
Malfoy was pale as a ghost. Not only he had to suffer living under the same roof but he couldn’t do anything about it he couldn’t even end his own suffering. And his mom. Narcissa was alive. If Potter threatened him with her life that meant he knew her whereabouts, she was alive and one day he could probably see her.
“Open you mouth.” Harry ordered him and Malfoy simply obliged. Potter cast a spell for cleaning teeth, the one he usually did for Teddy. When he was done Draco spit the foam into the sink and Potter helped him rinse his mouth holding a cup of water to his chapped lips. After that he dried his hair with a wave of a hand, took the towel away and helped him put on a bath robe, fastening it in the front.
In front of them was a worn set of steps and a battered door with a silver knocker in the shape of a serpent. Harry reached out with his magic and the dark house recognized the owner and easily let them through the complicated set of wards. The door opened with a creak and they were finally home.
In other words the whole situation is a stalemate. Malfoy deserved a chance. Harry put the paper aside scanned and signed last reports, sign-ins for Level 1 and Level 2 Auror training and stamped them.
“Left wing, Potter, go straight ahead, cell number eight on your left. Here’s your key.” He through it towards Potter and the Auror caught it easily.
Potter dropped his wrist and stepped back. His eyes filled with anger. But he didn’t hit him, he didn’t curse him. Potter touched his cheek with the tips of his fingers, snorted and smiled. Malfoy was able to draw blood. His cheek was on fire and his fingers were stained with blood.
He didn’t answer. He didn’t even look at Potter. His gaze was blank. It looked like he was in his own world. God. That will be very difficult. Harry leaned towards him and waved his hand in front of his eyes. Nothing. Completely spaced out.
Draco was so pale he looked exhausted. Potter helped him wash the hair, scrubbing it good with the shampoo two times to get rid of all the dirt, it needed cutting but not today. He scrubbed his skin raw, neck, chest, arms and hands, his belly, and finishing with long skinny legs and feet. He gently washed his private parts, rough hands touching the soft skin of Malfoy’s dick and gently rubbing his asshole. All the time Potter was giving him small directions. “Close your eyes, chin up, give me your right hand, now left hand. Turn around. Good.”
The room was warm because of the fire in the fireplace and bright candles on the walls and on the table. There were several plates on the table with chicken soup and some vegetables and fried rice. There was also a jug of cold pumpkin juice on the table.
That meant that aforementioned Draco Malfoy was still downstairs in the cells of the Auror Department and of course nobody wanted to do anything with him.
Casey handed him a plastic bag. There wasn’t much inside: Malfoy's wand, his heirloom ring and his wizard ID.
He groaned. He had to get up and use the bathroom but his body refused to listen to his brain. Draco remembered somebody calling him by his name. He definitely took a shower his hair smelled so nicely. But there he wasn’t alone.
“Yes, Master. Glad to serve you and young Master Malfoy as well. Master Malfoy hasn’t been in this house for more than 20 years. I’m glad he’s back.”
Harry didn’t get any answer. Malfoy was actually standing though he definitely needed some effort to do that. Harry took off his robe and put it over Malfoy’s shoulders. He quickly fastened the laces around his neck, so it won’t fall down and would keep Malfoy warm.
Potter noticed that Malfoy looked defeated he was looking aside and his eyes were glistening with unshed tears.
“Great, just great. That’s even better. And as a Head Auror you couldn’t find some poor sod, who’d be in charge of, as you would say it, filth like me?”
Potter stepped closer to the bed and took Draco’s wrist in his own hand, tugging his fingers from the damaged skin of the dark mark. Draco reacted so fast he didn’t even think. He was trapped. Potter was holding his hand in a tight grip. But the other one was still free. Draco only needed a second to hit him full force with his palm. Potter was too close, his heart was beating so fast. He couldn’t even land a good blow. It was more of an awkward slap to Potter’s face but in the process he managed to scratch his cheek as well.
"Apparently," Neville explained with his eyes closed, presenting the picture of weary acceptance, "Malfoy,
Harry hugged Draco to his chest and felt a rush of fondness overtake his libido and turn everything on its head. How had they gone from sex to this level of affection so fast?
Malfoy sat down in the grass next to Harry, leaning back against the same tree trunk. Their shoulders brushed. It felt really nice. "So you've actually never had sex?" Malfoy tried to make it sound casual, but he was too obviously invested in the answer to manage.
Still, he thought it wasn't an accident that Malfoy chose that morning to fuzzily inform Harry that "The female imperial dragonfly eats the male after coupling, did you know that? Just tugs him close and then bites off his head." Having said that, Malfoy heartily bit into his breakfast of dried fish and berries.
It was a little gloomy in the library this late in the evening, but even so, Harry saw the colour quickly leave Neville's face. "N-nothing," he mumbled. "Nothing I would ever show to other people, anyway. No need to give away the fact I went illegally time-travelling, r-right?"
"They know of dinosaurs," Harry corrected. "But those are believed to be extinct. Otherwise, dragons only appear in fairy tales and fantastic novels."
He thought he also could have done without Malfoy's bumbling attempts at distancing himself from his father's ideology, occasionally going so far as to try to understand muggle culture and society. What he hated most about it was that Malfoy wasn't doing it with the goal of true understanding, but more in a "we need to know how the underclass thinks" way. Malfoy didn't want to accept muggleborns into wizarding society, he just didn't want to be seen as ignorant.
Holding up his now glass-free hand, Neville grinned at Hannah's embarrassed flush. He'd known he had found the right partner the first time they nerded out over the sensuality of a mimbulus mimbletonia's crooning sounds.
"Malfoy, Draco Malfoy," Malfoy looked surprised when Harry said his name, but he composed himself easily and held out his hand formally. He avoided rolling his eyes, responding to the greeting. When his hands released and Malfoy looked at him expecting something , Harry shifted uncomfortably on his feet. He looked at Ron, who was scowling at him, and thought ' to hell '. It has to start somewhere, right?
The stone traveled, revealing a small corridor and he walked through it. The decoration of his house had changed with the remodeling of the castle; while it retained its distinguished emerald green color, it looked less gloomy now with new leather chairs and freshly polished mahogany furniture. Plus some warm lights in the corners and silver decorations that sparkled.
He knew that his return to school would mean that now the victim would be him. Although he did not care, one way or another, he would access everything that others wanted to express about him. He deserved it.
He could feel the intense gaze of the Fucking Boy Who Lived piercing the back of his neck as soon as he was a little distracted; He could not know what was going through his mind, but he felt, at times, that he preferred the revulsion with which many pairs of eyes saw him than the uncertainty of the unknown emotion with which Harry was looking at him. And it was thanks to the constant presence of the other in his life, so close to him as to be able to breathe the natural scent of Potter, that he felt the whispers around him diminish considerably.
He reached the outskirts of the forbidden forest and paused for a moment, staring into the darkness of the landscape; he felt consumed by her, felt that he was welcoming him back to that place from which he should never have left. A feeling of loneliness filled his heart, and it did not surprise him, it was something inherent in his being.
"I don't think so much." Harry stopped playing with the bag of chips and sat across from Draco, being separated only by a couple of feet between their beds. I mean, of course you're a Slytherin, but I think now you've changed to how they knew you. I don't know what you were like before, but I definitely like the way you are now.
Was the universe wrong again? Because he really did not dedicate himself to investigate, he only saw that Hermione Granger did not greet him and ran to take refuge to the only place that felt a home.
Harry felt conflicted; although he was already determined to be frank, there was something that, even when he denied it, marked him too much. He was the Boy Who Lived and hero of the wizarding world and Draco Malfoy was a former - as far as he knew - Death Eater. That was not heard well anywhere; social opinion, appearances ... everything that was not relevant before, became essential at the moment of being seen in public.
He didn't want to see those green eyes full of vigor, worried about him; not when the reason for that discomfort was precisely the counterpart he detested so much. The Harry of his house had longed for him so fondly all this time that he didn't want to see him… disappointed .
Too far-fetched if you were asked, but everything was to return to the normality that he knew before that madness began.
When Harry entered the office, a leprechaun in a red suit sitting at a desk that looked like it was made of gold was grinning at him (Harry wonders if leprechauns can smile otherwise) and pointing to some chairs on the other side of the desk.
"You seem to have been thinking about it for too long," her aunt said, and Harry looked at her innocently. When do you want me to take you, then?
It passed faster than he thought, and he did not realize it until he was in Harry's large arms, who lifted him easily - even when he was a couple of centimeters ahead of him -, brushing his nose with his, smelling the scent of coffee and cookies that were freshly eaten. He was captivated by the beautiful green color of her eyes, the amount of feelings that were reflected in the brightness where it was reflected.
"I never felt smarter." And for the first time that night, the Slytherin Harry smiled genuinely excited; He quickly sat down in the chair in front of the desk and was very calm in that place.
Harry Slytherin looked at all the mess made by his magic and didn't look scared; perhaps because, unlike him, he was already very much in touch with that part of him, familiar with the idea of feeling those emotions and sensations that he had repressed so much.
The short answer was all they all needed to know that this was a sensitive topic, and that if they wanted to continue keeping the restored Hogwarts they had, they didn't have to talk about it again. At least not until everything was in order and in a controlled environment.
"Calling me Potter after the you of my world called me Harry for over seven years is… weirder," Harry said, holding the determined gaze. You only called me Potter when you were mad at me, which only happened twice.
"No," he answered as curtly as he could. The stupid fall hit your head more than you already had it.
"It was your questions, Mr. Potter." The goblin didn't seem to be mocking, but Harry still wanted to hide under the chair. Do you want the reading of the will right now? Or do you prefer to talk about your family vaults?
Without gauging his strength, he caught Draco's arm and pulled him into a hallway, behind a stone pillar thick enough for the two of them to remain unseen by anyone else. He recharged Draco's body less gently than he had thought and breathed in slowly, trying to control a feeling so archaic that it was harmless to the human race.
Although his red and yellow uniform could distinguish him and physically make a difference between his green and silver, he really wondered if the Harry of that world could not see that, little by little, the color of his heart was changing, or maybe it just went back to what it really always was. It was very obvious the change in attitudes that he had had throughout those weeks; He went from being a spectator, to someone who really cared about marking what he considered his ... in every possible way.
The entire course of the day was relative. Between ignoring the pang of despair that blossomed every time Draco pulled away from him and the need to cast a spell on the Harry of that world — who was grinning like a perfect asshole — the hours passed so quickly.
The three were silent when they finished recounting what happened that day. Harry took his hair and pulled it; He kept berating himself for all his faults, and trying to remember what happened when he tried to fight the other Harry. He seldom resorted to a bare-knuckle confrontation, at least not since he no longer attended classes in the Muggle world, and even did his best to avoid meeting his cousin and his friends - he knew he would be tempted to do so if he did. use his wand.
"Slytherin started leading the party," Hermione continued explaining. The other Harry was too good, the thugs couldn't do anything to knock him down or even scare him. He scored 70 points on his own and they barely had less than 20 minutes.
"That could be a trap, right?" Ron said looking at the Harry from his world and the other Harry; he looked more confident, daring, with total ambition and control of his emotions. All a perfect Slytherin like the colors of his tie.
Harry repeated the whole process of passing wand to wand until he could have his own, and when he finally got it and felt twice as powerful as without it, Harry simply paid for the seven galleons to Ollivander and said goodbye as formally as he could, gladly ignoring words about Voldemort's twin or shit he already knew, thank you very much.
Arriving at the entrance to the Slytherin common room, Harry stopped behind a post, waiting for Draco to mention the password for the week so that he could approach him inside his house; It would give him the advantage of engaging in conversation on his turf, but all on his terms. After all, he would facilitate that first contact.
. Harry shivered to and walked to Draco, taking his hand and pulling him inside, closing the door behind them.
He saw Ron's upset look but then turned to his new table and saw Draco smiling and clapping loudly. Harry let himself grin and hurry off to the Slytherin table, sitting next to Draco, who practically beamed at him.
This surprised Cedric. He asked a few questions Harry couldn't answer, and then Harry walked off, desperately wanting to retreat to the secure area of his four-poster, with the curtains drawn around him. However, of course, he was stopped by none other than Draco Malfoy.
they were, was back during the war. When they had saved each other's lives. When Harry looked into Draco's eyes just as he had done all those years ago and saw that there was still
Call it old magic, but Harry found his way to the correct cell purely based on his feelings. His gut led him in the right direction, right to Draco Malfoy. Or, what was left of him, at least. And call it boy-ish guilt, but Harry pulled his arm out of Ethan's grip when Draco raised his head to look at Harry.
Hence why he had struck up a relationship with his trainee. Seriously frowned upon, but he couldn't help himself. Ethan's brown wavy hair and electric blue eyes and his fit body from Hogwarts quidditch days had attracted Harry.
Draco looked down and immediately turned the same shade of red that the Gryffindor sweater was. Harry laughed a little and saw the corners of Draco's mouth twitch and thought that Ron might have lied about not being able to switch Harry's partner.
"Why did you do it?" Harry's voice broke as he finally looked at Draco. "Why did you care about me?"
"You'll soon find out that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there," Draco held out his hand to Harry.
Letting his head drop, a few tears fell from Draco's eyes and onto the hand that he was holding Harry's with. "Wake up," he whispered. "Please. I need you."
However, Harry's gaze was only met with one of stone and hurt and anger. "I don't feel anything." Draco said clearly, gazing into Harry's eyes and sticking out his chin.
This, of course, grabbed Hermione's attention, and she looked at Harry, who sat next to her. She gave him an inquisitive look which he ignored, and stormed out of the Great Hall. He wasn't surprised to see that Draco had followed him out. Harry grabbed the blond's arm and pull him around the corner, into a deserted hallway.
For a split second, Harry thought that he actually had seen hurt on Malfoy's face, but the next second it had been replaced by his usual scowl. Harry was about to turn and go, but he caught sight of the
Harry then realized it. Ron was angry. Ron was upset, just like everyone else, and Harry would not be finding the comfort he wanted in his best friend. "I didn't
And as for the third rule, he had been doing so good. He wasn't an emotionless bastard, per say, he just refused to love anyone or anything. He strongly liked and enjoyed things such as quidditch, Potions, and treacle tart, but he didn't love anything.
The blond blinked in surprise. Harry hadn't said it with menace or anything, just said it. "Potter..." He trailed off, looking at Harry suspiciously. "Forget who you're talking to? Bloody hell, Potter's gone mad already!"
He hadn't noticed Harry's entrance, so Harry quickly ducked behind a pile (well, more like tower) of books and watched Draco from behind. He was standing in front of a dark and sophisticated cabinet. Holding his want to the sealed doors, Draco muttered words Harry couldn't hear, and then opened the doors. He bent down and placed a bird inside.
When Harry got to the library, Draco was already there. Harry dropped his bag into the chair diagonal from Draco and sank himself into the one across from him. He then frown and rested his chin in his hand, staring out of the window they were sitting by.
Neither of them said anything, but they shivered as the brisk wind rattled them. After a quick glance around the area, Draco waved his wand and made a sweatshirt appear. He pulled it on, messing up his lightly gelled hair even more than the wind had. That's how Harry had always loved Draco's hair. Messy. Harry's eyes wandered down to Draco's sweatshirt and his heart almost stopped.
Draco wanted to say it back. And he would have, if his voice hadn't betrayed him and left. So, he did the next best thing.
He saw himself assuring Draco that he would be okay. That he wouldn't let anyone hurt him. He saw himself the night of Dumbledore's death being pulled aside by Draco, who kissed him, He saw himself shocked at first, but then kiss back with just as much force.
And, now, out of simple courtesy, Harry was on his way to the courtyards to look for Cedric and tell him about the dragons. It didn't take long, either, for he was surrounded by his fan club of Hufflepuffs. As he walked under the stone archways, students flashed their
Since the Dementors were the guards of the wizarding prison, Harry and Ethan had to make their way through the building (if that's why you would call it) alone. Which was fine- Harry wasn't planning on asking a Dementor for directions.
done countless of times before. But he was frozen. Frozen with guilt and shame and sorry and every horrible feeling as he stared through the open doorway into Harry's warm apartment.
, he really did truly love Harry Potter. And it wasn't anything sudden- what hurt the most was that deep down he knew he'd been falling deeper into love with the green eyed boy ever since that day in Madam Malkin's when Draco had uttered "Hullo".
. Harry always wanted the candles to smell partly like smoke. Draco hated it. But he loved Harry, so he dealt with it.
Pansy caught on when Draco was, for some reason, jealous when Weasley was Potter's special person and Potter had to save
They land on the Slytherin table. They land on the place where Draco Malfoy has sat for the past five and a half years. They land there and see that it's empty. Harry scowls and pulls out the all-too familiar parchment from his bag.
"Draco," Harry said quietly as they walked, and Draco noticed that Harry's voice was shaking. Draco immediately paused and looked at his best friend. "Why was everyone staring at me like that?"
." He dropped his head in his hands, seeing stars as he pressed his palms at his eyes, tossing his glasses onto the table.
Draco, who visited Harry in the hospital wing at an ungodly hour, but Harry was awake still because he knew his boyfriend would be visiting him. Draco, who stared at Harry for a moment, still, before climbing into the hospital bed next to him and letting his tears escape because when Harry returned from the maze, still and hurt and tear-tracked, Draco's heart had stopped, because for one (awful terrible sickening) moment he had thought
!" Hermione hissed, roughly shaking his arm and snapping him out of his thoughts and back to reality. Most of the eyes that had been scanning the room had found him, and he gulped nervously as he slowly raised from the bench.
They were memories of Draco and Harry's pointless bickering back in their years at Hogwarts. They were memories of watching Draco's name on the Marauder's Map and following him up until the day Draco caught him.
Harry turned away from Ron and his eyes landed on the pale blond boy from Diagon Alley. He wore a small grin that made Harry more curious about him. He'd seemed cold at the store in Diagon Alley, but here he seemed like any other kid in this crowd.
As Harry passed through the archway into the courtyard, he bumped into a taller figure. Ron, walking with Seamus. Harry glared at him and said, "You're a right foul git, you know that?"
"What happened today?" Harry asked gently, throwing his jacket onto the table and seeing Draco's solid figure. "What did that man say? We did background research, he's nobody important. Just some guy that works at Flourish and Blotts."
Draco had always gotten Harry. Harry had always chosen him. From the handshake in first year to the Yule Ball to even just partners in class, Harry had always chosen Draco. And Draco wouldn't even glance at anyone that wasn't Harry.
don't want eternal glory, I just want to be..." He let out a breath he didn't know he'd been holding. "Look, I don't know what happened tonight and I don't know why, it just
He looked straight ahead as he walked, wiping his shaky and sweaty hands on his trousers as he made his way closer to the High Table. After three years of being in the spotlight, he had learned one thing. Never show your nerves. It would only encourage everyone. So, he ignored the jeers and protests about him being "too young" and a "cheat", and looked Dumbledore square in the eye.
However, when fourth year rolled around and Potter's name was drawn from the Goblet of Fire and Draco knew what the tasks were because his father had told him, his blood froze. He watched Potter with wide eyes during the first task as he battled a dragon and winced when there were close calls that were a bit too close for Draco's liking.
The playful grin that had been on Draco's face had fallen the second Harry stepped towards the snake. They had been chosen to be paired for Lockhart's dueling club, and were having fun, until Draco shot out the snake. Snape had stepped forward to get rid of it, but it was too late.
Draco, who had been called to McGonagall's office and was told that he had to go into the Black Lake for the second task because he meant most to Harry, but he could
But, the stubborn prick that he is, Harry just scowled and stayed put. "No, Draco! Why do you keep shutting me out? I've got this heavy feeling I've been carrying around since you broke up with me and I think I at least deserve to know
-You are having fun? He asked feeling a lump in his throat, nervous about the answer the other might give him.
An indomitable feeling grew from that moment; slow but steady, especially when he saw his other self too close to Draco. And in an involuntary act, the moment he saw Draco all alone walking down the hall to the great dining room, he steeled himself and approached him rather hastily ... and for a moment, he wished he hadn't.
"Good night, Draco," Harry replied and watched him lie down. Through his voice he projected happiness. Rest well.
Harry frowned, did he really have to say he sucked himself? Well, only him had to happen that kind of thing. Seeing that the painting was closed again, he approached, with an enviable determination, until he was in front of the stone that gave access to the Slytherin house.
Draco fell silent at the accusations… the blatant accusations . He refused to answer anything that would incriminate him more, and from Hermione's sigh, he knew this was about to end.
Harry Potter's callused hand was masturbating him, touching such an intimate part, causing him a pleasure that he could not compare with any other; She would squeeze the base of his penis with the necessary force, and then she would caress the cleft of the glans, cleaning the pre-seminal liquid that came out due to the intensity of the caresses. And all of that, combined with Harry's warm tongue running down his neck ...
"Do you really belong to Slytherin?" Hermione asked really intrigued. It was hard for her to imagine Harry being… so like that.
He smiled when he saw that the other was completely silent. If he had learned anything from the pompous Gryffindors in his world — and in any other that has lasted more than a few days — it was how pretentious they were, donning a cape of heroes; each of them would want to take the title of whoever was the savior of the day, feeling that, without them, the team would not work.
Draco smirked a little. It was funny to imagine that Harry Potter with Slytherin bearing — defending him vociferously from all the clandestine and inquisitive gazes — excited for a couple of smuggled goodies. The smile on his face, with the dimple forming in the right corner of his face, was something he had only seen in the distance, hidden between sneaky glances.
"I must have known, you nearly scared me to death!" Draco claimed holding his wand in front of him and deflated his cheeks. I thought it was one of my ancestors upset with me!
He had been in that world for a month and a half, and perhaps things did not turn out as he expected at first, but without a doubt he was a very lucky boy, because everything was slowly settling in his favor. Last week, the school principal scolded her counterpart for the tantrum she was honored to witness in the second-floor men's restroom; In addition to the detention as punishment, he made him repair the damage and with all the pain in his heart — it was obvious that he adored the Gryffindor house — he subtracted points from the other Harry's house.
He was always in Draco's orbit. His limits reached to Quidditch practice, the library or the bedrooms; He could not protect him in those places, but he was sure that there he has his housemates, they could not treat him badly.
He got up from the lawn where he regularly lay, showing for the first time a smile. He would have to try hard, find the ideal that awaited him out there; maybe in a world where the Harry over there died.
"You know, before I got here, I was in other dimensions, and in one of them, you were a Draco Hufflepuff."
That is why he escaped from the celebration for a few moments - he had the advantage that everyone wanted to be with the hunter of his team, challenging him to drink glass after glass - and being stealthy, he walked through the corridors of the castle until he reached the corner near the infirmary. ; She arrived just as Ron and Hermione entered on Madam Pomfrey's directions. He released the air that left in his lungs for a few seconds and thought that it would be best to wait a bit.
-Please. How many times have you been told you should repeat that? ”Ron crossed his arms and looked at the blonde with a raised eyebrow, but Harry ignored Malfoy's answer, thinking of another question.
Actually, she knew he wasn't like that. He never thanked the other teams for a match, and showed no more than a banal interest in whether someone — other than a Slytherin — had an accident; usually it was Pansy or Blaise who brought him the news of what was happening with the other houses. But he was there, missing out on a celebration with his few companions, just to check on the Harry Potter that was causing him so much trouble.
He had the same arrogant look, with that unique glow that only caused him to surrender at his feet, how would it feel if he pronounced his name with that impetus that characterized him? What would it be like to submit to his whims again, to indulge that indomitable spirit that he loved so much?
"Malfoy, even with our discrepancies since we were eleven, I respect you, even the new you I like a bit," Hermione said as she closed and arranged the books that were scattered on the table. You did not deliver Harry to Voldemort at your mansion and that is something I will always thank you for. But I won't forgive you if you deliberately break the heart of Harry, my best friend, for not knowing what it is you want.
Eventually he returned to Hogwarts, very determined to, for once, be selfish and think of no one but himself; to break through and be direct with Draco, tell him that he saw him, that he felt something for him and wanted to know with him what it was about. But they barely got through the day of house selection and the whole school made a stir when they saw him walking through the halls.
-Understood. Enjoy your ride, Harry, ”she said, slowly approaching him and placing one of her bony hands on his shoulder. And I am so sorry that you did not find here what you were looking for.
"Good afternoon." Harry nodded in greeting, and suppressed an annoyed sigh as knowledge flashed in the old man's eyes. Truth be told, it was better than seeing him with the terror of Voldemort flooding him.
"Draco is my favorite person in the world." He said, as he looked at the middle school with an accusing glance, “It is evident that we all have the right to make bad decisions, and of course, we can regret them. Draco has shown to accept his mistakes with honor, who are you to judge him? "
"Well, I think this will be easier than going around the world looking for Horcruxes," Ron replied with a small smile. He more than anyone deserves to be happy.
The post-orgasmic reactions were the strangest, because there, feeling all the heat of the moment, unleashing his most recondite fantasies, he knelt on his knees and quickly unbuttoned Harry's pants, delighting in the thickness and hardness of the penis that It was perfectly marked on the boxer shorts.
"Harry, you gave us quite a scare." Hermione pulled away from him a bit and smiled with relief in her voice.
Just a little empathy for the person who had helped rid him and his parents of such a terrible place as Azkaban.
"I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings, partner ." He was back to that mischievous and carefree personality again. I thought Draco in this universe was your friend , you know, like in my world. And since I am you, I did not think it would affect you to share a little ...
Draco was so engrossed in feeling his heart fluttering in his chest, that he ignored the presence that was closely following his footsteps.
When he finished saying that, Hermione got up from her place and went to put the books on the shelf, getting lost in the corridors of the library.
"You see, you were very close to the snitch, but for some reason, you didn't see her, and Malfoy took advantage of that and started chasing her ..."
"I am the Harry who does belong to this world," he replied, straightening his body in a dueling posture.
"Didn't you say it already?" Draco just saw the Harry in front of him laugh in a very strange way. Almost manic.
His next stop was the apothecary, where he bought a potions kit for beginners and, having actually learned something in Snape's classes in addition to a variety of insults, he bought the same instruments but of better quality, choosing them separately. It assumes that the potions kit is primarily to help Muggle-borns who didn't know what to look for. Ignoring her curiosity to buy some ingredients, she paid for her things and asked if they could send them to her room in the Cauldron, just like she had asked with the books, and headed straight for the scroll shop across the street.
"Did you really think I was commendable enough to cross dimensions just for helping others?" Draco nodded a little, for he truly believed that. It's what the Harry of his world has done since he was eleven years old. No, Draco… I'm not stupid or a Gryffindor enough to risk my life for worlds other than my own.
And all those emotions led him to make the decision to tell Pansy everything that happened, so that she — in her infinite wisdom — could give him advice on where to look. He found himself in the need to relate every event of what had happened to him in recent months, and even go back much earlier, when he discovered that in fifth grade he began to feel a crush on San Potter.
I will answer the comments of the previous chapter shortly <3 I already saw that the Harry they prefer is the Slytherin, and well, I love it too, I ended up obsessing with him. Thank you very much for your comments, kudos, and favorites!
Harry felt sick in his throat and he pulled the covers that covered him very tightly. He felt really stupid for having fallen into the trap of accepting a bet made by the other, after all, why would the other place a bet that he would not be sure of winning? It was clear that his Slytherin counterpart knew he would win.
"So you are proposing we use the sacred ancient artefact of legends to call up Helga Hufflepuff from the grave in order to improve our grades?"
The first morning, Harry woke up and found he had migrated over from his side of the cave to wrap himself around Malfoy in his sleep.
His aching knees reminded Harry of the fact that they had yet to see any dinosaur kneel or crouch; were they physically incapable of bending their knees? And if so, how did the larger ones lay their eggs, what with their butts so far above ground?
They had no clue if the fish was at all edible, and one might have assumed that the man trying it first should get the bezoar in case he needed to fight food poisoning in a hurry. Instead, though, Harry charged ahead with true Gryffindor abandon, while Malfoy kept their means of salvation to himself, not trusting the other to take the remedy only in dire need.
"So, uh, back to the story. You know how Harry and Malfoy have been circling each other like courting coco rumsey catchers, right?"
They'd decided on a two hour safety period before Malfoy would attempt to eat. If Harry hadn't dropped dead by then, Malfoy would go ahead and try his luck. Maybe one hour had passed by now. Harry was feeling pleasantly full, but the scent of the grilled fish on the wind was still attractive to him. He had no idea how Malfoy was holding out on his empty stomach while smelling that.
After that, Harry made sure to avoid further awkward mornings by spelling Malfoy more deeply asleep once the other man had nodded off, making Harry always the first one to wake.
Snorting in mild disbelief at Draco's irritating poise and his own ridiculous envy, Harry wiped his sticky left hand off on Draco's thigh.
"Nobody really knows." Harry frowned, part of his brain dragging the knowledge from the older recesses of his memory while the larger part busily speculated on what really happened, since dragons
Harry leant back and took a moment to appreciate the picture Draco made, naked against the rough bark of the tree, hanging from his invisible bonds to lean in toward Harry, his eyes burning with arousal and an edge of pleading.
Looking back on their interactions over the past few days, Harry had to admit it really wasn't all that fast. Harry himself had been stealthily cuddling with Draco while the other man slept; and Draco, now that he thought about it, had been stealing touches right and left ever since they arrived in this age.
Chuckling, Harry finally moved both hands between Draco's legs. One of them lightly grasped the blond's erection. It felt good in his hand, a solid, smooth warmth. Harry allowed his left hand little movements up and down the shaft, the gesture stoking both Draco's pleasure and his own. His right hand, meanwhile, slid further down until it arrived behind Draco's ball sack.
When Harry had gotten up this morning, he seriously hadn't seen this coming. But he was ridiculously happy with where he was right now. Slowly, eager to please yet afraid of causing pain, Harry inched his finger into the tight opening.
Harry's head flew around to face Malfoy. Woah. How were their faces only two hands apart? Nearly close enough to kiss, if one were so inclined.
"No." Neville huffed an exasperated laugh. "Because when have you ever known things to simply work out for me? There's a reason I am known for being clumsy and accident-prone, and it's not all down to Uncle Algie, either."
Harry felt his prick pumping into Draco. Hot, tight, warm release. Overwhelmed, he lowered himself to lie down on top of Draco. No longer needing his arms to hold himself up, he buried one hand in Draco's hair, ruffling the sweaty blond locks affectionately. His other hand came to stretch out in the grass along their sides. A moment later, it was captured by one of Draco's. Their fingers linked and Draco gave Harry's hand a squeeze.
Harry re-sheathed his wand to free his hands, which he laid on Draco's knees and then pushed slowly up the blond man's equally blond thighs. They trembled under his touch like the legs of an ornithopod when faced with the serrated teeth of an allosaurus. Harry felt his heartbeat quicken. Draco must be feeling similarly excited, his breath coming in short, loud pants as he sat there, helplessly waiting for Harry to finally give him what they both wanted.
Even buried balls-deep in Draco, Harry had enough brain capacity left to find that odd. "But you've had sex…?"
At night, they made their beds in a small cave that they spelled shut with a large boulder before going to sleep. It was mildly claustrophobic, but, as Malfoy convinced Harry: safety first. Harry was pretty sure Malfoy had a skewed perspective, never having been made to sleep in a small, dusty cupboard beneath the stairs; but in this instance, he grudgingly conceded that Malfoy was right. So he kept his peace.
That was what Harry had been asking for; but it wasn't what he had furtively hoped to hear. It must have shown on his features, for Draco's own face scrunched up, obviously displeased. Harry felt even more foolish, now.
"It was actually Voldemort who found the Resurrection Stone; don't ask me where and how. Dumbledore found Voldemort's hiding place and took it, then later passed it on to me." Harry didn't go into the details. The less said about the second time he died and did a Frankenstein impression, the better.
Tom didn't seem very convinced, but as he nodded and smiled, Harry didn't care about the credibility of his story.
His mouth was parched. Thanks Merlin there was a glass of water on the bedside table. He gulped it in one go and started coughing. He was too greedy for the water, should have slowed down a bit. The glass fell on the floor.
Harry turned around and headed to the big steel door. The scanning wards let him through. The magic felt heavy and strong, an unwelcome touch of the low voltage electricity. His skin was prickling with it’s strength. Another long and gloomy corridor and at the end of it was Jake Dallahad, security level 2 Auror and his team.
Malfoy was sitting on a small bed in the corner like a statue, it was hard to say if he was breathing or not the boy was calm and silent he wasn't moving at all. The only light came from the corridor’s tiny lamp.
Finally, time to go home. Potter stood up, took his robe from the hanger, closed the drawers with a wave of a hand, he turned off the lights and left his office with the pile of documents and Malfoy’s paper on top. He left all of them except for the Malfoy's on Wendy’s table and headed through the long dark red corridor to the elevators. He still had one thing to deal with.
The house is wardered as is the fireplace. You are allowed to walk around. I doubt you can do that though for now, but f00eel free to explore. Some doors are closed for your safety. I’d say escaping is possible but I wouldn’t try it if I were you. Just rest for now. You will understand the rules along the way. It’s too much already for one day.”
He put his sleeve up next, to see the Dark Mark, and applied the salve to the inflamed cuts. Malfoy didn’t even flinch he was already asleep. Potter let the salve dry a bit and after that covered him with the bed sheets. Malfoy’s face was so peaceful. His hair was laying gently on the pillow.
“Ok, Malfoy, fine, nobody’s touching you. Calm the fuck down. Listen, I get it all this is tough for you and all. But there are some rules and you will follow them otherwise there will be consequences. First of, you will never do this again.”
Harry wasn’t sure how to do this. He helped Malfoy take off his ragged T-shirt, dirty trousers and underpants. He helped him step in the bathtub and helped him sit in the warm water already covered with white bubbles.
Ron looked nervously between Harry and Draco. "Er- yeah. Yeah, that's actually what Malfoy here came to talk about, too..."
Maybe before three weeks ago Harry would've expected a scowl paired with an insult. Maybe a week and a half ago he would've expected a shrug with a tease alongside it. What he expected now, he didn't know, but it definitely didn't include Draco smiling and saying "Yes, that I did."
, and only Neville and Hermione to keep him company. They weren't great options, either. Hermione, when she wasn't with Ginny and Ron, would just badger Harry about the Tournament. Neville only talked about Herbology and plants, which bored Harry to death.
It was Draco's turn to glare. "Why? You want to know why? Fine! Because even though the world around us is going to war, Harry, you still act as though we're the same innocent fourteen year olds we were when we fell in love."
For a moment that felt like an eternity, neither of them said anything. It had been a year since Draco's arrest, and it very clearly affected him. The sunken cheeks, hollow face, dull eyes, hair that brushed his nose, and ripped clothes, said so. But when Harry looked into Draco's eyes, he knew Draco was still there. Draco had not succumbed to the Dementor's evil, soulless, ways. He had held on, and he was alive. For now.
He just wanted this nightmare of a conversation to end. Hell, it wasn't even that. Harry hadn't said a word.
In the end, it was decided by Barty Crouch that Harry was to participate in the Triwizard Tournament. He was now binded into a magical contract that couldn't be broken and would be performing in three tasks over the course of the year.
Harry, against his own will, slowly smirked, letting his eyes flick down to Draco's chest. "Nothing. Just- nice sweatshirt."
Things were much simpler when he was eleven, or twelve, when Draco was too naive to realize what his feelings toward the Golden Boy. Back then, everything was easy. Back then, Draco's walls were built up high, his defenses were secured.
As quiet as he can possibly be, Harry pushes open the door and slips inside, closing it before anyone can catch him. When he faces the room, it's the standard Room of Requirement. Piles of, well,
Draco leaned forward and met Harry, sharing one last gentle kiss that was full of sorrow because they both knew it'd be the last. For a while at least.
Then again, Draco wasn't Ron. And what Harry had with Draco wasn't the same as what he had with Ron. He didn't know why, yet, but he'd get there.
And then his eyes cleared and he saw Draco again. Tall and skinny and sad, standing in front of him, blue-grey eyes focused on Harry and Ethan's linked hands. Harry reached out and took Draco's hand in his other. He whispered a small "Come on," and apparated the three of them far, far away from that prison.
She could not tell you that Draco had grown so distant that he was too far away to hear the sounds of Harry's heart breaking.
