but i almost lost all inspiration for this fanfic because i was like... fuck i am a Bad Writer and no-one cares if i post or not anyway and i overuse words entirely too much...
Harry mouthed back, hoping that Mrs. Weasley didn't notice. He and Ginny had developed a strange friendship that was filled with equal amounts of snark and respect and Harry didn't want anything to jeopardize that.
He had expected a little resistance, at least.
Harry guiltily took a peek at the time on their grandfather clock and was shocked to find out that it was already eleven. He, Ron, Hermione, Charlie, and the twins had all stayed up talking until Hermione and Ron had bid them goodnight at around ten, Harry too excited about the upcoming Quidditch match to even think much about sleeping.
I told you I'll get you to talk with Malfoy, didn't I?' With that, she strode out of the room, returning with Malfoy ten seconds later.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at her in amazement as she strode forward and took a seat as if she belonged there.
'It's not as if any of them have tried to prove otherwise,' Hermione piped up for the first time, and Harry resisted the urge to groan and bury his face in his hands. 'And you didn't try to stop Malfoy from calling me a mudblood, either.'
'Blaise, you're a half-blood, okay? Your life means more to me than any amount of pride you could get by staying here. Just.

Blaise smiled slightly at Draco as he sat down, and Draco inclined his head in return. Both Parkinson and Perera studiously ignored them, too wrapped up in their staring contest between Granger to pay any attention to him.

'I suppose you know why I'm here, Potter,' Malfoy finally said, breaking the thick, tense silence that had fallen over them.
They all turned around to glare at her, even Parkinson. 'What? It's true.'
All of them, even the twins, nodded their heads promptly. There were times when it was fun to cross Mrs. Weasley - or so everyone said, he still wasn't sure - but Harry knew, with absolute certainty, that this wasn't it.
Draco was taking a walk on the Quidditch grounds when he caught sight of the owl heading his way. With the other schools arriving yesterday, everyone from the fourth year and up had gotten a break on the following day to help the foreign students to 'assimilate better to their environment.'
'And it's not as if we don't trust Dumbledore but…' Parkinson trailed off. 'We
'Well, that would be, well...'
Neville, sitting on their table, was thoroughly absorbed in his favorite subject and didn't even look curious as to what they were talking about. Harry let the sound of Hermione answering his comment fade into the background, guiltily remembering Sirius's note that he got two days ago that was still in his pocket. It wasn't that he hadn't checked it - he'd checked it one time too many. Just the fact that someone cared about him, someone that felt like a

For someone who had pretended to be in love with Draco for three years,
'Yeah,' Harry said quickly. 'Didn't Parkinson say-'
'Besides...' Harry said slowly. He was sure he wasn't imagining it when Ron had looked over the person standing next to Malfoy with interest. Ron, apparently noticing his train of thought, groaned softly.
'Merlin helps me with Gryffindors and their foolish notions,' Draco muttered before sighing. He extended his hand. 'I accept.'

Before Draco could make a no doubt snappish reply, the doors to the Great Hall opened with a loud

'You can have it,' Harry said, nudging the dish towards the girl.
Harry rolled his eyes fondly at both of them.
The thing was, Draco, logically, knew that the Dark Lord's ideology was wrong. Blaise, more than anyone else, had made him open his eyes to the fact that the world wasn't as black and white, as pure-bloods vs. mud-muggle-borns, that his family had made it seem.
His reflection wrinkled its nose in disgust. 'Good morning to you too.'
The arrival of the Irish team's mascots was no less remarkable; Draco could see what had appeared to be a green-and-gold comet that had come zooming into the stadium, which did one circuit of the stadium and split into smaller parts to zoom towards the goal spots. A dazzling rainbow broke across the stadium; at the same moment, a shower of gold coins fell from a shamrock that the leprechauns had made.
'It's okay,' Hermione said, much more kindly than she would have had an hour before. Or five minutes ago, to be fair. 'I don't think any of us blames you for that.'
'What do you mean...' Harry started, then abruptly remembered a moment two days ago when Ginny had been about to say something about who she was interested in and then had broken off. 'Ah.'

'But you guys were there with me! I wasn't alone!' Harry protested, blushing.
He rushed into the Great Hall into his customary seat on the Slytherin table, narrowly missing the water balloon that Peeves had aimed his way. Blaise shot a smile at him from across him and Draco returned it begrudgingly.
'I didn't say anything,' Harry protested as he sat down gratefully onto a seat, glad that he was safe from the downpour. He didn't envy anyone who had to find a carriage after them.
Thankfully, Harry was saved from overthinking - well, more than he already had - by the quite literally explosive arrival of the Weasleys at his uncle's house, Harry unable to help but feel the stress from the last few days melting away through Mrs. Weasley's motherly hug and Mr. Weasley ruffling his hair fondly.

He took a deep breath and threw some Floo powder into the fireplace, waiting until the fire turned green before he stuck his head in, saying, 'Zabini Manor,' clearly.
That was all it took for Hermione to be wrapped up in a conversation with him, apparently forgetting her food in the process. Ron looked at them speculatively and exchanged a look with Harry.
Ron winced.
'Yeah, thanks for everything,' Harry added.
'Oh,' she said, abruptly breaking away from her conversation when she saw them approach her. Harry raised an eyebrow amusedly, glad that she wasn't livid any longer. Ron, however, was looking at Zabini and Hermione with an accusing look in his eyes and Harry restrained the urge to smack his head against his palm. This did

Malfoy, to Harry's surprise, gave a bitter smile at that. 'Saint Potter,' he sneered. 'And I'm sure you wanting to help has a lot of conditions? Me spying for you? Risking my life-'
Draco, clearly seeing Blaise's expression, continued haltingly: 'I'm sorry about treating anyone who wasn't a pureblood like scum, Blaise.
It took a while for them to clear their plates, Harry belatedly realizing that Mr. Weasley was missing from the table. Mrs. Weasley, noticing his unsubtle look at his customary chair, said, 'Oh, Arthur had to sort out some things for Mad-Eye - he probably won't be returning anytime soon.'
'Always knew Wales was the better team anyway,' Harry replied, pushing past his attraction to glance at Charlie laughingly, sure he wasn't fooling anyone, especially the Weasleys.

Ever since that conversation in the library, Ron and Blaise had steadily grown closer with each other, but they were nothing more than friends. Yet. If Blaise and Ron's sickening looks at each other was any indication. 'You know nothing untoward is going to happen. Malfoy, though...'
'I thought you couldn't use magic because you're underage?' Hermione piped up with interest, looking eager to digest all the new information she could. Harry, glancing at her, couldn't help but smile, feeling a surprising warmth in his chest as he looked at his best friend.

'And as for you, Potter,' Draco said, expression thoughtful. 'Most families probably left you their possessions out of a misguided sense of gratefulness - you might want to look into that.'
Didn't think Slytherins were into that sort of thing.'
He looked up as someone nudged his shoulder, seeing Neville's assessing glance on him. 'You okay, Harry?' he said quietly, not interrupting the animated conversation that Seamus, Dean, and Ron were having, Hermione, having thoroughly lost herself in her book at that point.
' Potter and Draco uttered, both in various stages of bafflement. Draco had stopped asking where Dobby was after his father lapsed into an intense fit of muttering about Potters and their audacity, but Draco had actually missed the quirky house elf that was willing to listen to anything he said about Potter and Hogwarts.
'That's a lot of character development for someone who didn't even know Blaise

Harry, laughing, followed after Ron as the train's whistle blew.

Andrei opened his mouth, no doubt to introduce his friends when Dumbledore stood up from his chair and a hushed silence descended upon the entirety of the Great Hall. Even the Beauxbatons students appeared interested.

Harry nodded, feeling the events of the day crashing on him. Telling his friends this had been nice - he knew he knew he

when Hermine, no doubt noticing his anxiety, elbowed him in the ribs. Harry shot her a grateful smile and continued:

'What, no words to say, Malfoy?' Weasley continued, still with that infuriating grin on his face. Draco had never wanted to punch someone as badly as he did, at that moment.
'Moving on from that incredibly awkward situation,' she said, nudging Hermione's shoulder and eliciting a reluctant smile from her. 'Granger, I admire your dedication to freeing house-elves and giving them wages, but I don't think they are
Harry didn't have to see Malfoy's face to know that an all too familiar sneer was curling up his usually attractive face.
He was shivering uncontrollably, clutching his cloak tightly to his chest as it fought against the rushing wind. He was in a thoroughly bad mood from having Crabbe and Goyle from following him around like the useless loons they were; the rain seemed almost as if it was mocking him.
'Well...' Harry said shiftily. 'I

Hermione's nostrils flared.
And Hermione, with her dark skin and first-hand accounts from her great-grandparents of how horrendous slavery was - knew better than most.

drew the line at Malfoy getting tortured by Voldemort - and then find out a way to talk Malfoy into joining their side.
Her words were drowned out by the abrupt opening of their carriage door to reveal one Pansy Parkinson, who wasn't flanked by Malfoy, for once. Her hair was bunched in a loose bun and, like Harry, she had chosen to forgo wearing her robes until the last moment. Harry couldn't help but think that Muggle clothing suited her, not managing to disguise his once over for what it was.
Parkinson turned around. 'Yes?'
'Good,' a baby's smile was expected to be happy, reassuring; a comfort to everyone surrounding it. This smile was nothing short of chilling, a dichotomy that didn't go unnoticed. 'Then we can commence on our plans to get the Potter boy at last.'
'Exploding Snap?' Harry suggested, trying desperately to not sound as if he was trying to change the subject. Hermione gave him a

'I don't think I'll be able to meet up much,' Draco said stiffly. He had stopped pacing, and was instead gazing miserably up at the ceiling, determinedly not making eye contact with any of them. 'Crabbe and Goyle's been suspicious of me ever since I told them to not follow me around

The thing was; there was a time when
Harry tried hard not to think about what he would do in Malfoy's situation, at what he would be forced to do, and was horrified to realize the spark of sympathy in his chest was growing stronger and stronger by the minute.
'Fine, I'll sign it,' Draco muttered, snatching the quill roughly from Perera and signing with a flourish. He could feel his heart hammering in his throat. Fuck covert rebellion, then.
Thankfully, they were spared from the further conversation - and god forbid,
Until Hermione broke the silence with: 'Did you get a letter back from Sirius yet, Harry?'
that was now the Dark Lord, going to cause grief and destruction to her family.
Mr. Weasley broke the moment by clapping his arms briskly together as he checked the time on his watch - which looked exactly like an ordinary watch except for nothing at all like one in Harry's eyes - signaling them all to follow him up the hill where they would meet their Portkey, along with the Diggorys.
'Just.. get to the forest, and go straight or take the left, okay? And stay there until I come to look for you.'
Ron threw up his hands in despair. 'There's no arguing with him, Hermione,' he said. 'It's not like he's going to listen to us.'
He didn't look like he was a human being but -
Harry threw a pleading look at Hermione, whose face clearly said,
'That's fine with us,' Granger, though from the looks of Potter and Weasley, they weren't as confident as her. Draco wondered absently where their Gryffindor bravado had disappeared. 'But first, I want you to sign this piece of parchment, just as a precaution.' She rummaged inside her bag and unearthed an obviously enchanted piece of parchment; most people couldn't recognize that it was a contract, but Draco saw the tell-tale gleam on its surface that normal parchments didn't contain.
'I'm Sri Lankan,' Perera said, smiling slightly at him. 'You're Indian, right, Harry?'

And try as he might, he couldn't stop thinking about Draco Malfoy - not the Draco Malfoy he saw in his third year, arrogant in his beliefs - the Malfoy he had seen in Voldemort's vision, if only for a moment; the face of someone who had thought what was right all their life had finally realized they were wrong all along.

'I hope you're happy now, Draco,' he panted, apparently unable to leave it
The boy across laughed. 'Andrei Dinev, at your service,' he offered his hand, and Harry automatically took it.

'Hello, Blaise,' Draco said smoothly, trying to keep his composure. The next thing he knew, he was being pulled up from the fireplace and facing the first person his age he saw this entire summer. It was depressing, to say the least.
He had always heard stories about the grandeur and glory that came with the Dark Lord's reign from his father, about a world without mudbloods, where purebloods were supreme.
'And I appreciate that, Potter,' she smiled. 'I just don't understand why I'm here.'
Harry, feeling sick, realized that the threat of Voldemort was at the forefront of their minds. At that moment, his lingering belief that his vision was just that - a

He and Hermione were the only ones present who even looked remotely ready; even Ginny, usually quite put together, was muttering and cursing as she looked for her belongings upstairs. Hermione caught his eyes and released an involuntary gasp of laughter which Harry joined in.
'I can do a levitation spell too, you know,' Ron grumbled. 'It's not my fault Mom doesn't allow us to use magic here.'
Ron was still red in the face. 'Did you - did you

'Not really, though,' Ron said hastily, no doubt also seeing the same gleam in her eyes. 'Didn't you hear? Mom doesn't allow us to use magic anyways. She says even the magic needs to rest once in a while so our core could develop.'

Draco took one last look at the Gryffindors before he exited the Room of Requirement with the other Slytherins, making it a point to say,

It was unnerving, and Draco had never felt like a pixie under scrutiny more than he did now.
He took a deep breath and tried to collect his thoughts, realizing that was the only thing he could do as he descended down the stairs.
The Dark Lord appeared not to notice, gesturing imperiously with his short, chubby hand for his servant to lay him down on a high backed chair, though Draco couldn't help but wonder how he was going to sit upright in his… current state.
Blaise, who had been quiet for most of the exchange and was appearing to observe the house-elves who were hard at work, spoke up for the first time. 'You managed to enchant this in a

It had been barely a week and Draco was looking forward to escaping the Malfoy Manor to see the Quidditch World Cup with more than his usual amount of fervor. The Dark Lord usually stayed shut in his father's study, the only sound coming from Lucius or occasionally Pettigrew entering and exiting the study.
'Unsavoury things?' Harry asked, brows furrowed.
'But then… why didn't I get Sirius's possessions?'

'But dumb luck's helped us a lot in the past, Mione,' Weasley said, looking longingly at the food that was laid on the other tables. 'Though that still doesn't explain why Per-Sathya's here, Pansy.'

It was the same gleam in her eyes that caused her to come up with the idea to Polyjuice themselves, after all.
Draco wanted to laugh.
Blaise had a half-smile on his face, though it was no less bitter than the look in his eyes. 'You can't just make an exception for me, Draco. You either admit that there's
'Cat got your tongue, Malfoy?' Perera inquired, and Draco realized that he had been staring at the head table for a long time, not even answering Perera's question. He flushed angrily and opened his mouth to respond, just when a smattering of applause broke from the Slytherin table at the first Slytherin that got Sorted.

the reason Sirius didn't tell Professor Dumbledore he was near Hogwarts,' Hermione finally said after a long silence. 'And why he went to Professor - Remus's. I thought Sirius had a problem with authority figures or something, I didn't think…' she bit her fingernails. Sathya reached over and gently pulled her hand away.
For some reason, Blaise's words kept echoing through his mind.
'Harry Potter's saving people thing strikes again!' Hermione said, exchanging one of
'You know what I think, Harry,' Ron said unexpectedly, angling his body in Harry's direction to make his point clear. Unfortunately - or fortunately, Harry didn't know - Harry was situated on a couch diagonally from Ron, causing him to lose his balance and land on an undignified heap on Blaise's lap. Blaise, though shocked, looked a little pleased as well, which Harry couldn't help but think was a little sweet of him.
from a magical family...'
Draco's mocking laughter was an answer as any.
'What does that have to do with-'
With that, he strode determinedly forward, leaving the disbelieving glances of the Golden Trio and one Blaise Zabini in his wake.
'I don't think half the Wizarding World does, Ron,' Harry said softly.
Voldemort lazily flicked his wand and the curse was suddenly ended. Draco heaved an inaudible sigh of relief.
'That's enough, you three,' Mrs. Weasley said sternly. 'Your father thinks very highly of him.'
Draco was just glad that the tension between them had abated enough for them to

Hermione was successfully distracted, for once. Before she could ask more questions about what Ron said - which even Harry was interested in hearing - Mrs. Weasley strode into the living room and took a look around, her eyebrows rising higher and higher as she saw that it only contained Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Charlie, who was drooping on his sofa.
'I feel bad so bad for the drivers,' Hermione whispered, clutching Crooshanks' cage to her chest as Mrs. Weasley paid the money. Harry felt certain that she had no idea
Before Harry could think better of it, he said: 'There's a house in London. It's called No. 12, Grimmauld Place, and it's the Black ancestral house. If you ever feel like you need to hide, it'll always be there.'
wasn't the only one who was surprised for a second time, either.
And, for the second time that day, Harry found himself relaying the events that had happened in the aftermath of the Quidditch World Cup.
Could he really call his father a hypocrite if he was about to become one himself?)
Potter woke up with a start, scar throbbing in pain.
His father; all contempt, rage, and dishonesty to those who were beneath him, kneeling to those who he truly believed in. His mother; calm, efficient, calculated, yet without the madness that lay within.

Hermione would have made a

The irony of Harry asking Draco to hang out with his friends when Draco had said,
'Don't think Malfoy is in any position to refuse your help, though, Harry,' Ron said, screwing his face up in concentration as he looked at his cards. 'He sounded desperate enough from the conversation between him and Blaise you overheard.' Ron's tone was disapproving and eerily reminiscent of Hermione when Ron and Harry did something she didn't approve of.
'I'm not betraying England,' Harry rolled his eyes, leaning back into his chair with a contented sigh. 'I'm just being

'I'm sorry -' Harry could hear the surprise in Malfoy's voice and edged closer, determined to not miss any moment of their conversation with each other. He had a feeling that this was important, and even the quick, short flash of guilt at deliberately eavesdropping on their conversation couldn't sate his curiosity.
were. 'We'll meet up here in two days, same time, if it's alright with you?'
'And the thing is, Potter,' she said, and all her bravado was gone, replaced with someone who had been forced to grow up too quick; too soon. 'The Dark Lord plans to return at the end of the year.'
Sathya shrugged. 'Seemed pretty appropriate. The only thing we're missing is a cape - we could dress up as Batman or something.' Turning to Pansy, she said: 'You would make an

that the Weasleys radiated every time it was time for them to get to the Hogwarts Express, but it always came as a surprise to him anyway.
'Sorry about them,' Charlie whispered, glaring at his brothers fondly. 'they have no sense of privacy. Or shame. Or anything, for that matter.'
'We house-elves call it the Come-and-Go Room,' Dobby said. 'But most who know call it the Room of Requirement. It's on the seventh floor, and the only way you can access it is by walking around it three times, thinking really hard about what you want.'
'Your mother is influential, I'm sure no-one would figure it out...'
Hermione and Ron exchanged a look of bemused affection behind his back.
Which Draco thought was a load of shit, but still. The break was nice.

'Cheer up,' Blaise said, apparently noticing his despondency. 'At least Flint won't be Quidditch Captain anymore, then.'

old as Dumbledore might have had when he realized Tom Riddle was truly Voldemort, after all.
(And Harry resisted saying that this was the first time anyone had ever told him that, unconditionally: their affection had always been conditional; the Dursleys, taking him in yet forcing him to do their work for him, Hogwarts, but fighting basilisks and werewolves in return, never staying for the summer.
'Parkinson, what are you doing - ' was all Malfoy had to get out before he caught sight of Harry and broke off. Pansy rolled her eyes and exited, giving Harry a look that plainly said,
Regarding Blaise knowing about Voldemort being in Draco's house: Lucius is many things, but he's really not subtle. This was the man who pretended he was Imperiused and got pardoned, but literally no-one believed him. And Voldemort probably wants to alert the Death Eaters that he's coming back so they'll be more prepared - but the thing is, that leaves them with time to prepare to work against Voldemort if they want to defect, too :)

Harry had seen the none too surreptitious glances Malfoy had kept shooting at Harry, almost as if daring Harry to ask what was wrong. Harry was surprised to find that they had barely exchanged two words this whole year; normally, Malfoy wouldn't hesitate to make a snide comment about Ron's, Hermione's, or Harry's families, or lack thereof, in Harry's case.

Zabini laughed loudly from beside her. Harry glared at him but he appeared entirely unbothered. Hermione, suddenly realizing who she was sitting with, went crimson on the face.

making Harry want to sink through the floor and die - and the twins, the gits, had way too much time on their hands if the kissy faces they made at Harry every time Charlie was near was any indication.

smiles with Ron, ones that made him feel as if they've talked about him when he wasn't there. He couldn't help but feel a twinge of fondness at them, for that.

Is this foreshadowing? Maybe.
'The short answer? We're tired, Potter,' Zabini said. 'Tired of being vilified because of our house, tired of being vilified for being a half-blood… you get the drift.'
'Yeah, I do - wait, how do you know that?'
Perera was one of the only openly half-bloods in Slytherin - and for that alone, Draco would have considered her a simpleton.
Harry couldn't help but notice how the light danced the second oldest Weasley's eyes, though he resolutely put those thoughts away for future consideration.

Parkinson laughed shortly. 'You've got that right,' she said.
'When I said Dumbledore was incompetent...' Pansy started, halting her words as she saw the blood drain out of both Hermione and Harry's faces realizing someone they had both respected had let them down. Quite acutely, in fact. Ron didn't look much better.
Ron made an undignified sound as Victor Krum sat across from him. Harry would go so far as to say that he
Mrs. Weasley had braved a muggle telephone to call for three Muggle taxis to take them to Kings Cross station, and Harry wasn't kidding when he said that it was the most uncomfortable taxi ride he'd had, with Crookshanks about to bite their legs any given moment, and Fred's trunk that shook every minute or so that the driver gave a wide birth to.
Hermione, too, had wanted to tell them about what had happened at Hogsmeade; more for the information that Slytherins could provide them with than anything else, and the parchment that she had made them sign that Harry now felt
'What happened?' Harry said, frowning slightly at missing everything interesting through his forced isolation from the magical world.

(Harry, though he would never admit it - or even believe it -was above all, a Good Person. He couldn't resist helping people than a teenager could resist skipping stones across the Black Lake.)
The thing was. Well. Draco had about one friend in total. It was an underestimation to say that he had grown up
'It's none of your business,' Harry muttered. They - Ron, Hermione, and Harry - had briefly explained what had happened at Hogsmeade to them; that Crouch was most definitely a Death Eater, but nothing else.
'It's still amazing,' Blaise said, not waiting for the others to react before signing his name on the parchment. Parkinson and Perera followed, and everyone's gaze fell on Draco, who still hadn't moved from his seat.
It was now that Draco realized that his father had never said at what cost. And, looking at how eager the Dark Lord was to
He caught only a glimpse of what appeared to be expensive furniture before he came face to face with the dark-skinned teenager. 'Zabini Resi-
The Great Hall was unusually silent as the hat finished its singing, the Draco knowing that the Slytherins, at least, realized what the underlying meaning was.

'I made an absolute fool of myself,' Ron bemoaned quietly as they manhandled their venomous tentacula into submission.

'Thank you, Harry dear,' she replied, rubbing a hand through his hair fondly. Ginny smirked at him fro across the table.
The rare moment of peace was broken by the loud sound of the bell going off, abruptly reminding them all that they had classes.
I don't think we have a choice,' Ron's smile took the sting out of the words, yet Harry couldn't help but wish that he was born an ordinary teenager - that he could, for once, be caught up in something that wasn't life-threatening.
He smiled grimly and raised his eyes to come face to face with Blaise. He had a proud gleam in his eyes, and Draco couldn't help but revel in it, knowing that one of his only friends, who knew how hard it was for him to do

Harry was grateful for all the friends he's made, yes, but he sometimes couldn't help but think longingly of when he was a First-Year with stars in his eyes, only conscious of the new world that had welcomed him with open arms before he realized how conditional it was.

It was at long last that Harry, Ron, and Hermione stepped into Platform Nine and Three Quarters, Harry feeling at peace for the first time in a long time as he looked at the steam engine that heralded his coming home.
Harry opened his mouth to protest, then once again realized the truth in her words. When had Dumbledore ever, truly said he cared for him rather than in relation to Lord Voldemort?
'Common decency, you mean?'
because i apparently can't keep to a concrete plot lmao (i might change the chapter count again - it'll probably increase by a couple, we'll have to wait and see)
'Malfoy,' Harry started. Then he didn't know how to continue. Malfoy too appeared at a loss for words, opening and closing his mouth slowly.
'Consider this my treat, Potter. We all owe you.'
Harry swallowed down his trepidation and began. 'You know how my scar kept hurting in the first year when Quirrel was near? Turns out that wasn't the only thing that it can do,' he smiled grimly, determined to not look at his friends as they swallowed that piece of information. The Weasley's clock was looking more and more interesting by the minute.
Harry felt a tired, hopeful smile, rise unbidden to his face along with a warmth in his chest that he, for once, embraced.

The day of the Quidditch World Cup dawned bright and full of possibilities for Draco. His parents had opted not to come, instead preferring to give their tickets to Mrs. Zabini and Blaise to go in their stead. Draco was just glad that he didn't have to deal with more awkward silences with his parents.
