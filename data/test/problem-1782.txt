“I wouldn’t have thought you would be friends with him.” A muscle near his mouth twitched in something that might have been irritation or mere curiosity.
“Back where?” Harry stood there, eyes following him through the room, trying to understand the situation. Was this one of those where the mad person ended up hexing everyone in sight or the kind where the mad person hexed themself?
“Aren’t you interested in a challenge?” Atkinson wasn’t smiling so much as baring his teeth, and he waved at the tea again, completely abandoning any pretense of subtlety.
And then Draco did something he never would have thought, he answered Harry’s question. “I didn’t want to be Draco Malfoy, former DeathEater, hated and reviled by all. And I didn’t want to be Draco Malfoy, head of the family and dutiful son. Don’t you ever want to get away from all those labels that people put on you and just be a man?”
Robards was in the middle of drinking his tea. He took a long sip and leaned back in his chair. “What?”
Henri shrugged and crossed his arms. “London is very good at filing their reports. Harry promised to send it along promptly this afternoon. No need for me.”
She stepped up beside Draco to wipe down the counter and said, “He’s the reason you’ve been so happy.”
Harry let him go, somehow understanding that Malfoy was going through something without any understanding of what he it was. Malfoy disappeared into the closet, closed the door behind him, and set about picking clothes in the dark.
The announcer was out on the field as soon as the players landed, next to Ginny asking, “How did you do it?”
“It’s softer, lighter somehow.” Malfoy held both his hands out over his face as if he could actually see the moon. “Doesn’t squeeze all of me out. Gentle and cool. Still full but soft.” His hands fell to his sides. He rolled onto his side. “Promise, fine tomorrow. Full, but fine.” He brought his hand back up to Harry’s face. “No worry.”
“Mix your things and mine, as if you know how to fold laundry.” He settled himself back in Harry’s arms.
Jude paused in scrapping his spoon along the side of his bowl for the very last of the dregs. “Whenever Sarah and I could scrape together some change, we’d share a pint.”
Harry made an uncomfortable expression, and Ron hurried over to say, sheepishly, something about the ring actually being for Hermione. And Harry escaped to make awkward small talk with Percy until it was time to step out onto the small platform outside. It was a large crowd, and Harry tried somewhat desperately to swallow his nerves. He cleared his throat, and then Shacklebolt cast a Sonorous charm on his voice.
Draco kept his eyes closed even as the two of them crossed the floor, as Teddy put his hand on Draco’s side, as the little girl put hers there too.
Hermione gave him a sidelong look. “Wish I did. It must be important, because Atkinson has been on a warpath all week. Filching things from different departments, demanding…”
Hermione knocked briskly on the holding cell door, and then, when no one answered, knocked again and said loudly, “May I come in?”
“Oh, splendid, an Unspeakable now, specialize in magical signatures. We’ll need to confiscate your wand for a few days.”
“I didn’t get a return portkey. I was, well, I was rather hoping you wouldn’t mind sharing drawers with me.”
And Harry felt like he was watching the whole scene from the overhead lamp, too bright and from the wrong angle. He crashed back into his body when Ron clapped him on the arm. “Robards wanted me to tell you that your report could wait until Monday, no need to go into the office over the weekend.”
And that warm feeling in Harry’s stomach turned to ice. He probably was flirting; he was always flirting with Tetchy Bloke.
Harry went back to the flat Sunday afternoon. Sundays were usually a day off for Ginny, unless there was a scrimmage, so she was lying on the sofa looking through a magazine. Usually they cleaned, but she had already done that, Harry could tell by the distinct lack of dishes on the kitchen counter.
Was that how it had been for Malfoy? If everyone hated him, and then one person showed the smallest bit of kindness, what did that do to a person? What would Harry have done in that situation? He’d loved going to Mrs. Figg’s house as a child because at least she hadn't hated him. What must it have been like to have the whole world hate you and only one kind person who wasn’t even that nice?
“Draco!” Two of the sisters stumbled down the stairs twittering at each other.  They were tall, like Roxi, but giggling and falling onto each other in their quest to get to the door. “AND HARRY!” they both shouted. “MOM! HARRY’S HERE!”
And Harry suddenly felt like laughing. “It’s a shit room. Let’s see if there is something better upstairs for you.”
She’d be a good influence on Jude too, and Harry felt vaguely optimistic for the first time in weeks. He watched as Hermione burst out of the compartment, the first of the students, and she launched herself at Ron who caught her. It was wonderful to watch, and Harry smiled even more.
“Everyone needs a place to go when they’ve nowhere else they can be themselves.” He wasn’t trying to sound petulant!
“Oh God,” Draco buried his face in his hands. Why couldn’t he just stop! Why did he have to keep asking, why did he think Draco had any answers about Harry’s behavior! Why couldn’t Harry just leave well enough alone!
“The Unspeables have asked me to create five computer stations and the Auror department wants three. I’ll have to build eight separate generators to power each of those computers. Out of these parts.”
Draco closed his eyes and weighed his options. He could tell Harry to fuck off, but past experience indicated that it would only pique Harry’s interest. He could explain the situation, and fifty-fifty Harry would go away or stalk him to the cafe. But fifty-fifty was better than nothing. “I’m off to meet with my tetchy ex.” He gave Harry a look. “It’s not been a great week for exes.” Which was meant to deter Harry from asking any other questions.
Hermione pushed Hugo through the door and was saying something back at Ron. “That’s not acceptable. There are no good reasons to bite anyone.” And then she turned to Hugo. “You cannot bite your sister, not even if she bites you first.”
And as Harry focused on this one thing, the subtle gasps and soft keening from Malfoy, let those noises drive out other thoughts. On his knees, Harry realized it was different than when he used his hands--the sounds Malfoy made this time were different, more desperate, higher in pitch, louder. And the feel of Malfoy’s hands in his hair, tugging and clawing, and he wiggled and strained while Harry just felt calm and in control. This Malfoy was wrecked completely, a writhing mess, and Harry was taking him apart at the seams. He was going to leave him absolutely
“Can’t go into Potter’s room.” Malfoy reached his free hand back into the light. “Can’t seem to keep away from him in Potter’s room.”
Draco looked good, Harry thought, loose and easy and smiling. And Harry wanted him. “Um, maybe at the counter?”
Molly and Arthur came up behind Harry and each took their turn hugging Ginny while Harry scanned the other students as they poured out the doors. Arthur took Ginny’s things, and she looped her arm through Harry’s, jerking his attention from the crowd and back to her.
Malfoy turned around then and looked at Harry, and he looked just as horrified as Harry felt. “I think this is supposed to be special time for you and-and Harry.” He stuttered over Harry’s name, and Harry realized that it was probably the first time Malfoy had ever called him Harry.
“It’s my fault he was there. This, this ruins everything. His mum, Robards, they’re all gonna know now.”
Standing in front of the mirror, Harry brushed and spit, and then told himself firmly. “I defeated Voldemort, I can take someone to buy school supplies. It’s really not that hard.” He bit his lip and then squared his shoulders. “I can.”
There was something nice about the way Draco could talk to people, about the way he listened to their responses before making his own, the way he smiled openly. It wasn’t something Harry had known Draco could do, and it was something he had forgotten how to do. Seeing someone else with such an appreciation for those small interactions, it was a pleasure to watch.
Savage looked back at the scene. “We need a retrieval unit.” She sighed loudly. “What a mess. And certainly nobody will talk to me once they all show up and start scouring the place. Come on, Potter.”
Draco opened his mouth, and Harry pushed forward, tongue licking, teeth teasing, sucking hard. He wrapped his hand in Draco’s shirt and yanked him close, pressed his leg against the bulge in Draco’s denims. Draco gasped and moaned and whined low in the back of his throat. He grabbed hold of Harry’s hips in a bruising vice, rutting feverishly against him. He pulled at Harry, desperate for more.
Harry looked around at the piles of papers, and the cardboard boxes stuffed with odds and ends, at the broken arm of the desk lamp no one had bothered to replace, at the scratched desk. And then he looked at Draco, at the shadows that had crept back underneath his eyes, and the wrinkles in his shirt and trousers, at the look of dejection on his face.
The only upside was large portraits meant large crates, and it was quick enough to make it through that half of the container. Which left the figurines.
And when they arrived at the Burrow just after 1pm. Hugo and Rose were running through the yard with no less than five of their cousins. “Looks like everyone is here today,” Harry told Malfoy. “No one will look twice at you with this many kids running around and screaming.”
He checked the time, there was still an hour before he and Ginny were supposed to have dinner. Plenty of time to get started.
Eventually, they all made it to the front door, with only one purple hairpin missing, and then Ron and Harry went off in one direction and Luna and Neville stood next to the pub talking entirely too seriously. Harry could hear Luna saying something about needing someone with a greater appreciation of the unseen, and Neville looked very confused.
“They bit a lot of muggles, Granger,” Draco said softly. “And we know of at least one wolf who used to carry silver and dittany, visit hospitals and the like the day after the full moon.”
Potter sighed loudly. “You know, he and Andromeda moved in because he’s such a handful. He was always getting into cupboards and drawers and throwing things around or eating them. He was in St. Mungo’s four times in one year for accidental ingestion. It just got to be too much, and I do what I can, but it’s hard with me working full time and nights at that.”
“You’re not the first person to get dumped.” Tilly rolled her eyes. “You’re not even the first person in this flat to get dumped.”
She nodded and picked up a different memo, one that had been in the middle of her desk rather than in the pile. “Yes, I heard. I’m sorry. Perhaps you should take the day off?”
Later, after the dishes had been cleaned up, and Grace had bid them both a good night, Malfoy was cleaning up the wine glasses. And Harry remembered the work drinks. “If you don’t mind, there’s a work thing next week, drinks at the end of the day. I thought I’d go.”
“Good,” Hermione said brightly. “Because Robards is not going to let you in the room, and I am going to have to pick my battles here.”
Ginny came home for Christmas Hols, and Ron would not stop talking about it. Of course, Ron wasn’t really talking about Ginny, he was talking about Hermione, and how Hermione planned to stay at the Burrow for a half the break, and he would stay with her and her parents for the other half. And how Neville wanted this big night out after they picked everyone up at the train. And how Ron still hadn’t decided when he wanted to propose, but Christmas morning seemed like a pretty good time.
With nothing left to distract Harry, his mind filled with Malfoy. How it must have felt to have been told by a bunch of people who were glad his father died. How upset Malfoy must have felt, how angry. Betrayed maybe. Harry had felt so angry with the Dursleys when he found out his parents hadn’t actually died in a car crash. Draco must have been utterly livid.
Hermione smiled. “Yes. it’s taken a long time, but I think we can finally start making some good changes.
Tilly put her hand over the skull and looked down at where the black ink peeked out from between her fingers. “I know you regret this.”
And then Teddy showed Harry each and every one of the drawings they had made over the afternoon, pointing out which were his and which were Malfoy’s (as if Harry could not tell). Every time Teddy mentioned Malfoy, Harry’s would glance up, sometimes at Malfoy’s face, sometimes at his chest, sometimes his arm. It was instinctive, and he tried not to think about it too much, or about the way Malfoy would flinch or scoot or move his legs.
What made it odd was the taxidermy. Spaced evenly along the walls were stuffed animal heads, zebras, gazelles, lions, tigers, cheetahs, there was even an entire stuffed bear upright in the corner. And for a long moment, Harry couldn’t help but stare at the nearest wall.
“Great.” Harry replied, his head rolling back on the sofa. “It would be better if you stayed out here.”
There wasn't a procedure for what to do with wolf remains. Human bodies were treated with respect, had carefully constructed containers, would be reassembled if possible-cremated if not-before returning to the family. But three pelts now would linger on the shelves in Evidence, unidentifiable, with no magical trace to indicate who had killed them or who they had been. And Robards had declared them evidence of vandalism; that was the screaming match that had gotten Harry moved to the night shift.
For a moment Harry was just glad she wasn’t clinging to him anymore. “Who cares. We know it’s wrong, so what does it matter.”
Rosie had balled up her hands over her eyes and was crying profusely while Draco had wrapped his tail about her waist to keep her from falling head first onto the floor. He looked briefly at Harry and then nosed gently at her shoulder while Hermione screamed all the louder. There was a thunder of footsteps on the stairs.
Draco looked at the photo again and wondered just why, in an article about arresting Death Eaters who had escaped capture after the battle, they included a picture of Potter in a bar. There was also a disturbing amount of speculation on how Potter’s parents might have reacted to the news of their darling son. And, okay, so Draco did roll his eyes at the word darling, the whole humble, contrition thing was a work in progress.
“Which makes this a case for the DMLE, which currently includes me. If you want to do something actually beneficial, you can march yourself over there, and be there for Jude whom you
“Weasley’s had me arrested. He keeps demanding to know how I poisoned you. Keeps asking all kinds of questions I don’t know how to answer.” Draco leaned back to look Harry in the eye. “I told Dean about Lily.”
“Ginny won’t have to worry about it getting damaged when she plays.” Ron agreed without really having an opinion.
“Oh, uh, yeah, I just, um--” Harry looked over at Ron for help, but he was busy listening to Fleur say something about the two year gestation Goblins endured.
Harry ran both his hands through his hair and across his face. “I need answers, Malfoy. I thought you were going to die.”
The loo was a complete disaster. Water spraying from faucets, stalls banging, and this girl seated in the middle of it all sobbing terribly. It was a miracle Draco recognized her at all, most people wouldn’t have, under the dirty hair and ill fitting clothes. But then, the last time Draco had seen her, she had been unwashed and in ill-fitting clothes sitting outside and lit only by flickering fire light. It wasn’t so different from this bathroom.
And Draco was panting and frantic too. “It’s just a nightmare. No one’s alive. He’s not here.” He yanked Harry close, pressed Harry’s head to his chest. “It’s okay. It’s okay.”
He ordered a tea, and then turned to lean against the counter while he waited for his paper cup. There was an empty table between Draco and the sugar/creamer station which made it ideal to walk past, to size up this other bloke. He was built the same as Draco, they could have shared clothes, and Harry didn’t like where that line of thinking was going. So he turned back around, just in time to accept his tea.
But Jude didn’t go right, he went left with the crowd head toward apparition. Harry kept up though. Maybe he could accidentally-on-purpose grab ahold of him at the right time? But even he recognized that was grasping at straws. Perhaps he could cast a tracking spell on his shoes? Harry almost lost him while trying to decide on which tracking spell to cast, because Jude didn’t go to the apparition point. He walked right by it out of the crowd and towards the toilets--the only other entrance into the Ministry, which Harry avoided like the plague.
Harry looked at his nearly empty glass. “Actually, I should probably get home.” There was going to be all kinds of fallout with Ginny tomorrow.
“Don’t move.” Andromeda rolled her eyes. “Scourgify.” It left his clothes feeling tacky and stiff, but at least he didn’t look like he’d just been murdered. “Now go.” She shooed him, but Harry didn’t leave until he saw her sitting down in the chair next to Draco.
He walked, needing the time and the space before facing anyone else. For years now he had lived on the hope that he would see Draco, the knowledge that Draco was there, that Draco understood, that he wasn’t alone in the world. And now he had to live in a world knowing that Draco was out there and Harry
Would it feel the same, that bloom of glorious pain? Or would it be faded, less than last time, cursed with diminishing returns? It had been less last time, but Savage had been there, pulling them apart before they’d even gotten started.
“I know I can be an unpleasant man, demanding and difficult to work with.” Atkinson tried again. “I was impressed at how you held your own against me, and how despite our differences, we were able to work together.”
Harry straightened in his chair and began to put his parchment and quills away. “She’s right ‘Mione. This is the third community forum we’ve held in the last three weeks and no one has come to a single one.”
And Hermione burst into giggles that nearly knocked her off her stool and Harry had to laugh at that too.
“I don’t know.” Ron said, a look of panic on his face. “What if she’s expecting something traditional?”
Harry couldn’t help but see the ring Neville had put on Hannah’s finger three weeks ago. It gleamed and winked from her finger, and he swallowed against the sight.
But Harry wasn’t listening to her. “Not make sense! What are you on about?” Harry shouted. “You don’t even know him! You don’t know what we’re like together! He’s never there!”
As they walked, Teddy pointed out different sights, his school, some flowers, the park Andromeda took him to in the afternoon. And Draco listened carefully, replied with the appropriate level of interest, smiled and asked questions. By the time they arrived at Grimmauld Place, Teddy was bubbly and happy with a wide smile splitting the bottom of his face. And Draco felt better too, Teddy’s touch and his attention as soothing a balm as the dittany Draco had finally stopped applying to his wounds.
Besides, Draco didn’t exactly play well with others, and Ginny could be just as stubborn. Things with Draco felt tenuous, like a thin cord frayed at one end and perpetually threatening to unravel. If things with Ginny didn’t go well, Harry knew that Draco would not be around as often, and Teddy would mope and whine and probably go off through the neighborhood to find him again.
He stepped into the Stubborn Goat without ever making a conscious decision to go, and his eyes immediately went to the barstool where Malfoy usually sat. Where he was in fact seated tonight, hunched over the top, a line of shots in front of him with a slice of lime resting over each glass. Malfoy wasn’t drinking them though, just staring down at the golden liquid while he twisted his fingers painfully in his lap.
“Oh sure, Mr. Hermit starts dating a guy and doesn’t think it’s a big deal.” Ginny crossed her arms and scowled in a perfect imitation of Molly.
“Wow, that’s really--” Ginny broke off suddenly, and looked straight at him. “Wait, what are we talking about?”
Was that what Draco was up to? Was he just going to go out and-and get a job and find a girlfriend, someone who would love him unconditionally and say yes when he bowed to pressure and asked her to marry him. And then they’d get pregnant and have a whole parcel of kids to fill that huge Manor. As if the war hadn’t happened? As if people hadn’t died?
“It’ll take more than that.” Harry punched the wall, and then Harry had a thought. “You got a mobile?”
“So, Muggles not being able to enter the Ministry is a problem. I can talk to Kingsley about that, perhaps we can come up with some sort of solution.” She scribbled on her paper, and then looked up. “I can’t make any promises, it’s a small number, but perhaps we can create some sort of portkey for them.”
“Alright folks! Give it up for our visiting team, the BallyCastle Bats!” The announcer called and a cheer went up through the stands.
“Oh,” Harry waved a hand dismissively. “Surviving. Could you escort Mr. Malfoy to an available room?”
Before Harry would have knocked again, knocked louder, perhaps even tried to force the door. But now he knew better, knew to wait patiently for Ajax to come to the door, which he did only a moment later, dressed in nothing but cargo shorts. “What?” he growled through a crack on the door which still had the chain on it.
“Thank you,” she said politely and then stepped into the room. “Would you like me to shut the door?” And then, when Draco failed to suck in another breath, “I can leave it open too. That’s perfectly fine.”
“Never mind.” Harry shook his head, finally having lost the last of his limited patience. “I’m leaving. I’ll be back later.”
Tilly rubbed tiredly at one eye, smudging her mascara a little. After eight months of working two jobs, both mostly at night, she still needed a caffeine infusion around 3am and was starting to think she’d never adjust to the schedule. She leaned against the wall and stared out the front door. It was really long past the time she started looking for another flatmate, one that might actually pay the bills this time, and then she could give up this second job.
“Am I under arrest?” Draco asked obnoxiously, but with some genuine concern. He had paid his reparations, committed no crimes, and not set foot in England in nearly fifteen years.
Potter’s eyes darted down, thinking and for a moment he said nothing. “You did this to him. He was fine before you showed up and now he thinks you’re family! Whatever it is you did, undo it!” he hissed, eyes narrowed, shoulders tense, finger pointing.
She just shrugged at him. “What? It’s not like you’re very good at hiding these things. Don’t look so sad, we’re all very happy for you. You’ve been mooning over him since he installed those computers for us, and that’s only gotten worse since--” She shrugged. “It was just a matter of time.”
Harry watched Malfoy pick at his food at dinner that evening. Teddy was babbling, perhaps having picked up on the somber mood and trying to compensate. It was strange to see Malfoy so quiet, no complaints or snarky comments on the décor or the quality of the food. He just sat there, painfully straight back, pushing peas around his plate with his fork.
Harry drank two more cocktails before it was his turn to speak, and thankfully he didn’t stumble on his way to the stage. “Every year we have this fundraiser for Hogwarts, for repairs, improvements, students. It’s important, an investment in the future.” Harry cast his gaze over the crowd and tried to find Draco. “It seems like forever ago that I was getting my letter, but I can still remember how much the Great Hall felt like home.” There he was, off to the right, holding a drink and looking wrong. “I think about my classmates, the friendships that I made there and how they shaped my life.” He caught Draco’s eye. “How even now, seeing certain people evokes feelings of home.” What drivel was coming out of his mouth? “I hope all of you remember what it was like to walk those halls, to soak in the magic.” God, could this speech get more melodramatic? “Let’s make sure Hogwarts continues to provide those same experiences for the future!”
It was the wrong line of conversation if she had been hoping to restore some sense of calm in Draco, because all he could think was how on earth did she know what his favorite dessert was. Which, of course, was a vaguely ridiculous thought. Obviously his mother had shared that tidbit. But it was infuriating to think she was talking to people about him, even if it was only something as mundane as food preferences. “I haven’t had treacle tart in ages. It’s not common in New York.” He tapped his fingers slowly and deliberately on his leg as they walked trying to regain control.
With that thought, Harry went down the stairs. He could hear Teddy squealing excitedly from the parlour anyway.
Harry woke up, Monday morning, to the smell of cheesy eggs. And whistling. Malfoy was whistling in the kitchen. That must mean he hadn’t died of blood loss in the middle of the night, that or ghosts could crack eggs and hold a skillet. Harry pulled back the blankets and went to see.
“Fair enough, I suppose.” Harry nodded at the bartender, who brought two drinks over. “How do you know about this place?”
“I am not taking you to bed.” Harry scowled. “For one thing, I am still not convinced I shouldn’t take you to St Mungo’s. You’ve lost a lot of blood.”
Ginny shifted nervously next to them, watching as Hermione made her way over to the door. The Auror’s dropped the barrier, and mist began leaking out from underneath the door at an alarming rate.
Malfoy set the plate down on the nightstand and then made his careful drunken way back to the kitchen for the maple syrup and a glass of orange juice.
Well, Harry could leave a rambly message that Draco could listen to in the morning, and that would fill a few minutes while he waited in line.
Harry leaned over and saw that Malfoy had taken off the shirt, but left on the joggers. His chest was smooth, just fine blond hair that turned nearly invisible against his pale skin. But it was the scars, long jagged lines that Harry had put there, that caught his attention. He’d never wondered if he had left scars that day, never thought about it at all really. Harry’s eyes traced down them, noting the extent of the damage he had caused. The scars had turned white with time and stretched out across his chest, with one particularly long and wide line that ran past his belly button. They were more interesting than regretful. Perhaps he should feel bad about them, but Harry didn’t. He barely glanced at the faded Dark Mark.
“No.” Draco tried to focus on breathing, to push out the familiar scent and the feel of Teddy. “Not like me.”
“You couldn't narrow it down any farther for me?” Harry gestured vaguely toward the thirty hours of memories it would take him no less than thirty hours to view.
He stood there, hands fisted, shoulders so tense they were nearly around his ears, even his arse seemed to be clenched tight. And it occurred to Harry that he really didn’t know what he wanted from Draco, that he hadn’t wanted anything, and now, all of a sudden he did. And that seemed like a canyon that he just couldn’t cross. “I should take a shower.”
“I remember you complaining about how your arse was going to go flat from all the sitting and your eyes were going to stop seeing from the faded ink.” Harry rolled his eyes. “You want the door or you want to look over there?”
Ron gulped as he wrote his Gringotts account number down on the form and authorized the transfer. She took the form and the ring to the back room, presumably for the shop owner's signature. “I don’t think I’ve ever spent that much money.”
There was a flash of bright white hair under a spotlight, and Harry’s stomach dropped to his feet. Draco.
Another sibling poked her head in the room, Baby Abe hanging off her hip. “Are we starting the drinking?” She crossed the room and immediately found a bottle of rum.
But he wasn’t, and Draco was pulling back, straightening up, stepping away. And the setting sun was glinting on his hair, and he looked just a little bit lost and just a little bit feral. Harry stood there as Draco walked back to the house, back impossibly straight and head impossibly high. And for the first time, Harry wished, desperately, that he could talk to Sawyer, that he could ask how Sawyer had managed to tame Draco?
Robards started the meeting. “As some of you are aware by now, another wolf pelt was found this morning.” There was a chorus of groans, not everyone agreed it should be considered vandalism. “None of that now!” he barked. “Val and Potter took the call this morning. Why don’t you share the details with everyone?”
He stepped into the water, let it beat down on his head and back, let the heat of it sink into him. Harry leaned back against the tile and closed his eyes, tried to clear his mind of difficult, complicated thoughts. He didn’t need to think about Ginny right now, didn’t need to worry about what would happen with Teddy because Ginny wasn’t going to move in during the next two weeks. And Draco wasn’t going to move out in that time frame either. And things would be different when she came back into town.
Tilly sat down on the edge of the desk and picked up the tickets to look at the dark ink and crest. “And?”
“Maybe I should start again,” Granger said. “This is a lovely bar, and Harry likes it a lot. I thought, since it seems important to Harry, that I should see it too.”
Still though, it got them out the door that much faster. The warm and humid air outside caused Draco’s long sleeved shirt to stick to him, and he undid another button. Hermione and Sophie had linked their arms and whispered loudly while Ron tried to ignore them. Evan and Draco talked about music, and Harry watched with a bright, bubbly feeling in his stomach as they walked the twenty minutes to Egg.
Harry could barely hear his words over the roaring in his ears. His heart pounded painfully in his chest, working overtime for each bit of oxygen. His arms and legs stumbled and stuttered their way after Draco, sluggish and heavy, almost drunken. Even his vision seemed blurred a bit at the corners. He swiped at his eyes.
“He knows because a spouse always knows. Just like she knows about me.” Draco sat up, elbows on his knees. “Well, she probably doesn’t know it’s me, and she also probably thinks she’s crazy most of the time because she can’t find any evidence that Harry has a lover, but she still knows.” And Draco could tell from Dean’s open expression that he was right.
Granger let out a sigh of relief, straightened her papers, and began to tuck them back into her bag as Draco crossed the room. She sighed again as he slid into the chair across from her. “It didn’t work. You’re the only one who showed up.” Her shoulders slumped down. “You realize this is the first thing I’ve ever failed at?”
They could have apparated, but there was just something so nice about holding Malfoy’s hand and walking down the street, so they took the long way. Their steps fell in sync, and Malfoy kept rubbing his thumb against Harry’s hand. And even though they were outside, Harry’s world shrank down to the touch of Malfoy’s shoulder when it bumped against his, the soft feel of his skin in his hand, the lightness of his breath, the sound of their footfalls on the stairs and in the hall.
“Potter!” Malfoy shouted back with the ghost of a smile on his face. He took another drink. “And what brings you to this fine establishment?”
Harry scoffed and set the paper aside. It was creeping closer and closer to time, and Harry wanted to make sure that Draco was settled in for the evening before anyone arrived and asked questions about what he was doing. Teddy ran down the stairs as Harry was going up so that they nearly collided in his quest to sneak a snack from Andromeda. Harry flattened himself against the wall at the last minute, having learned the hard way not to stand between Teddy and his snack.
Carefully, he nosed open the door where there was less of poison for the small insects and more of the sickening flower that was also poison. The smell was stale, but only by a few hours, Draco would catch them, sink his teeth into their flesh and tear.
Hermione was an Unspeakable, but she wore silver robes edged in blue as part of the theoretical division, studying things like the concept of time or love or whatever. This man wore silver and red, the highest division, the division where things disappeared, never to see the light of day again. There was a rumor around the ministry that Red level Unspeakables lived in their department.
She startled and spilled water onto the counter. “Oxytocin, and it doesn’t just disappear overnight.” She huffed.
“I’ll take Teddy this morning,” she said, picking up his fork and carrying the whole mess into the kitchen.
“Ah, the Claddagh.” The man nodded. “The heart symbolizes love, the hands friendship, and the crown loyalty. They’ve fallen out of fashion in most groups, but there is a certain set that favors the Claddagh.”
Oh Merlin, Harry couldn’t have this conversation. He turned to the sales clerk. “Excuse me, we have a question.”
“You’re family,” Teddy insisted, his eyes beaming out their need and pulling at Draco’s heart. “You said so.”
“Christ.” Draco ran his fingers over his lips. “What the fuck is wrong with you?” He looked at Harry, eyes blazing. “Aren’t you still with Ginny Weasley?”
Eventually, Dean and Seamus returned to the table to talk about textbooks and what Hermione thought this new Eighth year would be like. Neville and Luna drifted over, Neville having sweated through his shirt and Luna looking as fresh as a cool breeze. He handed Luna some pink cocktail with a flower in the glass, and Luna smiled happily at the flower before asking Ginny some nonsense question about divination. Harry had had just enough to drink to feel loose and easy with an arm looped around Ginny’s waist.
“You don’t know that,” she said just as angrily, just as loudly, not backing down a bit. “He spent his whole life hating halfbreeds. He did terrible things during the war, you don’t know that he isn’t doing it now.”
Jude tossed the magazine lightly on the table and swung his legs off the sofa. “Just breathe, she’s not gonna leave just because you left your dirty socks out.”
Draco shrugged. Probably only Harry could answer that question. Draco had never married, and really wasn’t good at maintaining a relationship that lasted longer than a few months. “She’s yours, you know.” Draco answered a different question. “That’s why Harry is always bringing in pictures to show you, inviting you to things like her birthday party. It isn’t because you’re such a good friend, it’s so you can see your daughter.”
Dr. Conners reached for his wand, but Harry was faster on the draw and not encumbered by mediocre tea. “Please, try me. It’s been a difficult week, and I have just the spell for someone resisting arrest.”
Draco’s shoulders sank, and Harry hadn't even realized they’d been up around his ears. “Yeah, that’s what I want, two exes sitting at the same table having a cuppa, probably comparing notes. That sounds great.” He rolled his eyes.
“Huh,” Harry said absently even though he was paying very close attention to Atkinson. “This place is pretty far from the Ministry. I wonder what Malfoy was doing here a month ago.”
Several members of the Wizengamot had the decency to look ashamed. Eamonn Williams stood up. “While it is regrettable that you are unable to comply with the letter of the law, we must think of the good of all our citizens, not just the few you represent. The safety of our children--”
“That’s rough. Well, Booking’s not really as exciting as patrolling probably is. We don’t see much of anything down here until after 1am, but then sometimes it gets real busy. It takes a minute to do all the paperwork, see, and especially at the full moon, there’s all kinds of Weres coming in as well as all the people too sloshed to make a good choice.”
“Excuse me,” Vale stepped up next to her, tucking Faye in underneath his shoulder and placing a hand on her stomach. “You’ll have to forgive her,” He said, all apologies and cheer. “She’s in a bit of a delicate situation and so forgetful with it.” He passed over his own wand. “I do hope this will do.”
But Draco wasn’t ready to go back there, couldn’t handle the cracks on his ceiling or the crackle of the floo. “I’ll show you disorderly!” And he swung wildly at Potter.
Draco could practically feel the sun going down, could feel the moon rising in power. He’d tried not to hope throughout the night and day he had been chained in the closet, tried not to think of Harry and home, but he had not been very successful. Now the sun was setting, and the shift was coming.
“Ow!” She cried, and Draco released his hold, rolling onto his back and gasping for air. His shoulder was most certainly heavily bruised and ached something fierce.
Harry went to the Stubborn Goat that night, didn’t know what else to do with himself. Malfoy was already there, seated in a stool at the end of the counter, leaning over it and flirting with the bartender. The same one from last time. He reminded Harry of a taller, better looking version of Goyle, all muscular and looming. That was probably what Malfoy liked about him, Harry decided. Malfoy must like it when they look like a thug.
“You know, one of these days you’re going to have to tell me just what he did to earn your eternal hatred.”
“What will you do when the Ministry ignores your data or declares it irrelevant or decides they don’t care?” Vale peered at Hermione closely
Val chuckled, threw an arm over his shoulders, “Oh to be young and dumb. Come on, lover boy. I know a Potioneer who opens up his shop at seven. We can stop by after we’re done with the patrol, see if he knows anyone brewing illegally. Nothing takes the mind off a wayward lover like a murder.” She laughed again, but it was warm and gentle and not at all mocking, and Harry let her steer him down the street.
Ginny stared at him. Could she sense his lack of enthusiasm or had he voiced it? “It’s not like it’s a secret. I just forgot to tell you.”
“Hey! Harry Potter!” The bouncer shouted loudly as Harry got closer to the front of the line. “Why are you in line?”
In the middle of November, Draco lounged on the sofa while Tilly and Sophie whispered in the kitchen. He had taken over the living room a bit, dirty clothes piled on the floor in the corner, his phone charger perpetually plugged into the outlet with the telly. He had his arm thrown over his eyes and his headphones over his ears listening to the dulcet tones of
“His teacher was very pleased,” she said. “Teddy did an excellent job sharing at school today.” And then it was a story about blocks and crayons that Teddy half told, and Andromeda actually smiled.
She stormed through the one bedroom, noticed the light on the dishwasher, the laundry folded in the basket but not yet put away, the neatly made bed. He had not been here all day. And it was ridiculous, but Roxi just remembered him in the diner looking small and lost, and oddly thin. It was how she always imagined he’d looked that horrible year he’d had to fix the Vanishing Cabinet.
“Oh, yes, that-that makes sense.” Harry nodded to himself, that still put her out of Robards’ reach for most of the week. “We can use this one, and I can make sure she gets breakfast and everything.” He started thinking through what it might be like. With Jude’s hours at the Port, he wouldn’t be able to help Sarah in the morning. Harry would spend the week at Grimmauld Place and return to the flat on the weekends. It would be a strain with Ginny, but someone needed to be here for Sarah.
“Granger’s right.” He whined again, shifting against Harry as if trying to stand, but Harry pulled his hands up higher, held tighter to his arms. “We’re too different.”
“Let?” Draco laughed again, harsh and angry. “And who’s to say I haven’t happened to you just as you happened to me?” He traced one of the long scars on his chest. “Cut open and bleeding out. Maybe that’s how it’s supposed to be. Maybe that’s why I am the way I am. Practice for the main event. I am the broken road, torn up, damaged, a target meant for nothing more than a lonely death in a girls bathroom.”
Harry wanted to call bullshit, but shoved his hands in his pockets and bit his tongue to keep the words in his mouth. After a minute he said, “You didn’t seem too willing in there.” He nodded towards the diner.
“I can do laundry while you go to the supermarket,” Malfoy said, and Harry took that as an agreement.
The meal began well enough, with light appetizers and cocktails in the parlour. Draco sipped lightly on his gimlet and made polite conversation about the weather while they all waited for Astoria to arrive.
Tilly sighed. “I’m sorry.” And unlike other times this happened, Tilly actually was sorry in this case. She even met Evan’s gaze, her eyes dropping to his mouth.
Harry held onto his hips, thumb rubbing gently over the scar while he smeared the remains of the dittany over his chest. Malfoy let out a sigh at the touch. “When did you get bit?” Harry asked quietly.
“Potter!” Robards shouted, and all of Harry’s attention flicked to him. “If you continue in this matter--”
Harry nodded gratefully. It was always better to go to Ginny’s matches with other people. With Hermione, Ron, George, and Jude, that should be enough of a buffer to keep the worst of the reporter’s questions at bay. And the game was in Dorset, away games helped too.
Draco closed his eyes to focus on that familiar thing, he could almost make it out, like a voice in the twittering. It was a voice, but it wasn’t words, he realized as he listened. Rather, it was a high pitched laugh. Draco immediately doubled over, dry heaving onto the parquet floors, a clammy sweat all over his skin, shivering uncontrollably.
“A safe place?” Draco repeated softly. He closed his eyes and breathed deep, counting slowly to ten, in and out, and he thought of a safe place. He thought of Harry’s bedroom, with their clothes strewn all over the floor, and the clean laundry piled haphazardly on top of the empty dresser, sheets pulling up at the corner of the bed. And Harry, pressed close behind him, arm draped over his waist, hand over his chest--over the scar, warm and strong. They were thick blunted fingers that splayed wide across his chest, holding him in.
Harry and Draco looked up. “Yes, they are nice.” And then Harry looked back at Draco. “I can’t tell you how glad I am that you're here.”
Emmerson clapped him on the shoulder. “Like I said, don’t let Robards know you did that.” And then he was stepping out of the room.
He’d been pretty messed up when he and his mother moved to France, but Draco had still had some control. When they received the news that his father had hanged himself in Azkaban, Draco went completely off the rails. Out at clubs all night, drinking and smoking (although, thankfully not snorting) but definitely blowing any guy who looked at him with half a smile.
Harry shook his head. It had been bad enough to have everyone asking what happened to Trevor, Harry hadn’t even thought about what he would say to Draco’s old friends. “There seems to be no trace of him since he was sentenced to probation.” He frowned. “And now the case has been closed without resolution.”
Val frowned, deep lines around her mouth, and Harry realized he was still covered in blood. “An audience with Shacklebolt.”
This wasn’t at all like the skirmish at the University, where there had been space to hide, chaos from the students running around, where Draco had the element of surprise on his side which he used to keep everyone safe. This was fast and brutal, well organized by people trained for exactly this sort of situation.
“Are we hurt?” Tilly demanded of Evan, and they both did a very quick inspection of themselves that did not reveal anything strange or bloody. “No, I don’t think we’re hurt.
Draco edged out around Tilly, Emma blocked the door out to the living room. He’d have to make it past her and through the living room to get out the front door. And who knew what George would do, or if Emma would curse him. He could see her grip tighten, knuckles going white around the handle.
“We now open the floor to questions.” The Scribe called, beginning the exhausting question and answer session. Most of the questions were directed at Shacklebolt until Faye broke into the proceedings.
Harry opened his mouth to argue, but the Minister interrupted. “I’ve been stuck in meetings all day, a bit of fresh air sounds wonderful.” And they all trouped through the house, Hermione with her hands on Draco’s arm while Harry got the tea.
Harry thought about Hermione giggling onto Ginny’s shoulder as they talked about going to that club where it would have been loud and sweaty and strangers would have recognized him. “I didn’t want to go there.”
Harry liked the touching, liked the press and slid of fingers and clothed knees. But he was afraid too, afraid to let his fingers trail along the inside of Draco’s wrist like he wanted, afraid to put his hand on Draco’s thigh, to tangle their fingers together like they used to.
His lips were soft and light, a tender lingering kiss that had Ginny whopping loudly enough for the whole bar to hear and Hermione grinned from ear to ear. And harry could feel that kiss warm him from the inside out. When Malfoy pulled back, Harry felt like he couldn’t breath and as if his chest had swelled up to three times its size.
Ajax flew off the sofa, straight to Draco’s face. He wasn’t as tall, but he was muscled. There was a set of weights in the corner of the room he used pretty much everyday to keep up the muscle mass. And he ran too, five kilometers a day. He was strong enough to put Draco out of commission, especially since Draco didn’t carry his wand regularly any more. “Why the fuck would you do that?”
Draco glared into a corner rather than confront Faye over her comment, and Harry tried to smooth over the moment by handing Draco a large cup of coffee. “We thought the best way to get everyone to the hearing this morning was to apparate in. Shacklebolt cleared it with Robards, so we can all apparate into the Auror department. We’ll do it one at a time, and I’ll take Draco first.”
Ron came back to the table with the first round of drinks. Neville and Dean hadn’t arrived yet. He set down the pints and watched Harry spin his phone again. “Just text him already.”
Tilly laughed. “No, it’s a girl thing. When you go in the loo, and there’s a girl sicking up you make sure she’s not going to get it in her hair. It’s a solidarity thing.”
Again, Ron went lightly, not wanting to spook Harry. “I know you’re--mates, but I was surprised last night.”
“You don’t like it when people get between you and your research.” Harry pointed out. “And you aren’t insanely rude all the time.”
Malfoy’s whole face went tight, his knuckles turned white around the skillet handle. And eventually he said, slowly, carefully, “I enjoy going out, bleeding across the entire city, coming back half-dead and passing out in your bathroom. I enjoy the-the drained and empty feeling all that bleeding leaves behind. I wish I could do that every day.”
She made a face at him. “And whose fault is that?” He grinned sheepishly back at her, and Harry laughed out loud.
“Aren’t you going to investigate?” Atkinson snarled, finally succumbing to Harry’s irritating antics.
Draco turned back to Harry, still crying fiercely. “You idiot, what did you do!” He pulled off the robes and pressed them to Harry’s stomach while Harry tried to pick up the tea cup.
Draco stared at the pitiful number of clothes hanging in his equally pitiful wardrobe. Three pairs of black trousers, three pairs of white button downs, one pair of denims folded on the shelf next to one black long sleeved shirt, also folded.
And then, Harry had a question. In the midst of reading the back of the box of tea bags he thought, when did Draco go crazy? He’d been working for the department for five years, but for the first three he met regularly with various Aurors for his probation. It would have been impossible to notice such a change in his behavior. Only in the last two years did those meetings stop, and then the reports were written entirely by Unspeakable A, which had to be Atkinson.
They both climbed off their stools and Harry made an awkward farewell before leaving. Tilly leaned over the counter near Draco. “Well, I’d say that went well.”
He stared at the base of his martini glass, running a finger up and down the stem, suddenly all nerves and uncertainty. Harry was silent as he sipped his beer, hand fussing with something in the pocket of his hoodie. And Draco didn’t know how to break this silence, didn’t really understand what this moment was about, hadn’t understood what Potter had been asking when he’d asked Draco here.
Teddy must have shouted something back, but Harry couldn’t hear from his seat in the dining room. He looked over the room. He really needed to get a smaller table, ten seats was really too much for the three of them, and maybe he could set out a table and a few chairs at the other end of the room to make a place to sit in the evenings, since the living room was almost always out of commission.
“And how is Mrs. Greengrass? Still involved in her charity projects?” He ignored her question and sat at the seat that had always been his as a child. The plates rearranged themselves, and his wine glass filled itself.
“What? He’s probably got a ring his mum set aside the day he was born just for him to use to propose. Hell, he’s probably got a whole set, no need to pick anything out.”
Harry kicked at the chair leg and missed. “Yeah, no, I get that. You-you have a life here, and it’s a good life. And I shouldn’t have asked you. I’m sorry.”
Draco lay in the puddle in shock and horror. He raised his gaze to Harry and said, in a very, very small voice. “I’m covered in Neo Death Eater.”
For a moment Potter flailed his arms to keep from falling, and then he was back at the wall. But Draco had already stepped out of reach. “And you know so much? You spent one night in my home and you think you're an expert!”
Draco shoved him off, and Ajax let himself be shoved. “It was Potter, alright. And Potter knows me, yeah, not likely to just let me go without a little chat.”
Jude just pointed at Harry, and Harry wasn’t sure if he was trying to warn her that Harry was in the room or blaming Harry.
Draco leaned back in his chair and gave her a considering look. “Oh, I wouldn’t say that.” He looked across the room and caught Florence’s eye. She’d found a seat at the bar and nodded at him over her cosmopolitan. Cade and Faye and Vale were grouped near her, arguing over how to split the bill for their drinks, but they stopped when Florence leaned over, nearly spilling her breasts in Cade’s ale.
“Maybe, you’re just burnt out.” Ginny said, “Maybe, in a few months, you’ll feel--better, and I’m sure Robards will give you your job back.” She reached across the table and took his hand. “It’s going to be fine. Just give it some time, and you’ll be better.”
“When I married Edward, I didn’t think I would ever be back in this house again, and now I’ve been back for three years.” She straightened her back. “I didn’t think I’d ever see my sisters either, and now I’ve met my nephew.”
“Who?” Harry asked, wiping his dirty hands on a rag and making a confused face. Nobody firecalled him this early in the day.
“Oh.” Harry swallowed and tried to think of some way, some defense he could mount, but there wasn’t any, not even something sad and pathetic. “I guess that's it then?”
And Tilly laughed, laughed hard until tears leaked from her eyes, and Draco couldn’t help but laugh too, clutching at her hand. It was hard, but Draco managed to get out, between nearly crippling bouts of laughter. “Tilly’s my friend, Mum. My best friend.”
“Really? I know you were all talking about me. Longbottom wasn’t exactly quiet when he said my name.”
“I didn’t stay,” Draco said suddenly. “I came home.” It seemed so important all of a sudden, to explain, to make Harry see how he felt, how he didn’t have expectations and how he could keep all those feelings to himself, and how it was okay if Harry wanted to marry Ginny and move her into his room next door. That Draco could be okay with whatever happened as long as he didn’t have to leave.
“Oh, uh, yeah, uh, Venti Blonde--blonde venti.” Harry stuttered and the cashier gave him a dubious look while Malfoy huffed a quiet laugh
am all that stands between you and my Pack! If your Aurors are unable to stop us, and they most certainly are, what do you think prevents the thousands of Weres in this city from overrunning you? You have no idea of our numbers, you have no idea of our abilities, magical or otherwise. You have created a system full of discrimination that does nothing but put you at risk, and we choose to keep you safe. Over and over and over, we make choices that keep you from harm. Even now, we make choices to protect rather than destroy!”
He apparated down the street to the corner, the opposite direction of the apparition point. No need to run into Potter and his friends, they’d made their point quite clear, thanks very much. He wasn’t welcome, wasn’t welcome at the Ministry, not at the Leaky Cauldron or anywhere in Diagon Alley. Not even at the place that was
Tears sneaked their way down Draco’s cheeks, and he hid his face in her shoulder choking back a cry. She held him, hands stroking calmly across his back and muttering soft, soothing words while Draco regained his composure. It had been so long since Draco had let himself feel this vulnerable that it was several long minutes before he could pull his head up and wipe carefully at his face. His eyes were still red and his cheeks shone with traces of tears, but he didn’t sniffle. And for the first time since he had returned, Draco felt calm and comforted.
Draco slipped out from underneath his arm, moved to the other corner. It lacked cover, if Weasley decided to open the door, he’d see Draco first. He’d
“Ginny!” Harry squeaked. Because if Harry had learned anything about Oliver in the last few months, it was that he didn’t back down from a challenge.
The sooner everyone else accepted that reality, the sooner Draco could move on with his life. Because he intended to show the world that the Malfoys had learned their lesson, for good this time. He had a whole list of ways he was going to prove this, and, sitting at the table trying desperately to not hear the conversation around him, Draco mentally recited the list.
Harry slammed his hands on the counter, some terrible combination of drunk and desperate. “Don’t lie! He brought me here one time. You knew him. You-you joked about porn!”
Ron proposed Christmas morning causing a near riot at the Burrow, a flurry of waved arms and exuberant kisses, of wild handshakes and back-thumping hugs. George ended up with an accidental black eye from Ginny when they collided in a mutual attempt to get to Ron first. And even then, George wouldn’t sit down to let Harry heal it properly until after he’d congratulated both of them.
“No,” Tilly said on a long exhale and then leaned over the counter that divided the living room from the kitchenette. “Emma’s going to be there, and she’s just going to talk about how great her job is and how much she loves her flat and this amazing place that she went with her friends. And I know she’s just excited and I should be excited for her, but it’s my birthday today and I just don’t want to. Why can’t it just be about me?”
Now Draco was pulling his hair and muttering. “Twilight. Everything is twilight. Grey and twisted, a perversion of what it is.” He pulled himself up off the floor and slammed his hands on the barrier. “You thought I would just fade away, an empty vessel for you to fill up as you pleased!” he screamed.
Resigned, Harry walked into his office and shut the door. “Take a seat, Potter.” Robards gestured across his desk, and this time Harry did sit. “I’ve rated you as Meets Expectations in all categories except one.” He handed a copy of the review to Harry, who quickly scanned it over for the Needs Improvement section which read Personal Interactions. “Your co-workers, with one exception, seem to find you difficult to work with. You’ve been described as terse, unpleasant, and uncommunicative. And those were the nicest words people used to describe their interactions with you.”
“I’m so sorry, love.” Harry pressed a kiss to the back of his neck. “Does it happen every time I leave?”
So Harry talked to Robards and owled McGonagall, filled out some paperwork, and by the end of the day everyone was in agreement. Jude would return to Hogwarts via a ministry floo at 9am on Wednesday morning and then spend the summer with Harry at Grimmauld Place. His return would be early compared to the other students who had chosen to go home for the Easter Holiday, but it would also give him time to settle in. And Robards gave Harry guardianship paperwork to fill out and all of Tuesday off to gather all the school supplies Jude would need. It took all day, but by the end of the day on Monday, Harry and Jude returned to Grimmauld Place.
It took twenty minutes to get the take-away, but Harry was glad of the extra time to enjoy being outside and alone. If he spent the entire day working cases, it would probably drive him insane. And despite Malfoy’s clear desire to help, he was almost as annoying as Atkinson.
Draco let his eyes scan over the article, not reading, just picking out words here and there. Cult like activities, all died by the same poison, ingestion, the authorities think, an isolated incident. It had to be a wolfsbane poisoning, but they had taken it before, Draco had personally observed three of them. And where was their Alpha? Why hadn’t she taken the potion and left the others to be?
“I thought you might like to watch the final casting.” Luis knelt down in front of him, the bowl back but filled with far more blood then what he had taken from Draco. “I wanted the Thunderbird wand for its mastery of transfiguration, the preemptive casting was an unexpected advantage. Would you like to watch?”
It was easier to think, without the Fwooper twittering, and Draco remembered--remembered that Luis had stolen him, brought him to Malfoy Manor, that Luis had plans. And Draco needed to find out what those plans were.
Harry left Val behind when he went to visit Malfoy. In truth, there wasn’t any question of bringing her, Malfoy had made that more than clear at the diner. And Harry needed answers. He went early Sunday afternoon, because he thought Malfoy would still be sleeping, and it didn’t surprise him at all when Malfoy didn’t answer the first time he buzzed on the intercom.
“My solution is in the best interest of everyone, no one goes to St. Mungo’s or Azkaban, and, perhaps I can calm Sarah down enough that she stops producing this mist.”
Draco clutched a hand to his mouth and tried to breath. Tried not to think of Harry or Teddy or Andromeda and instead thought of Sawyer. How Sawyer might have been in this very closet, might have felt this very fear, might have hoped and prayed for Draco to rescue him.
Jude wandered into the Port early on that particularly slow Tuesday afternoon. Draco had returned from his park excursion with Sophie and Lila, full of tangled thoughts, and Tilly was having some oddly wistful thoughts about Evan. Both Tilly and Draco were huddled around the counter, Tilly absently flipping through a magazine and Draco peering intently at his mobile. Jude took a seat at the counter next to Draco and looked at Tilly without saying anything.
It was the first time she had ever mentioned her son-in-law, and Draco was curious and ashamed for a moment. But then his stomach rolled a little, and he had to concentrate on the fresh air and the breeze through the leaves and wait for it to settle. It was peaceful in the garden, and the more time Draco spent out there, the more he liked it. He liked watching Teddy impale sticks in the dirt and then try to attach leaves to them like tiny flags, and he liked seeing the tiny purple flowers and the shade from the trees. There were places in London to find these things, but they didn’t seem quite so wild, not that this garden was wild, but it wasn’t the perfect manicure he saw so often in the city.
And Harry surged down, desperate suddenly. Where he had meant to tease Draco, to bring him to the edge over and over and over, to extract promises and declarations by any means necessary, now he needed. He needed Draco underneath him, around him, inside him, needed to press himself closer, so close that they were one.
Tilly made chamomile tea, and Draco sat on the sofa holding the steaming cup close to his body, soaking in the heat and smell of it more than anything else. When Both Tilly and Evan settled on either side of him, Draco spoke. “I don’t know where to start.”
Harry let him, uncertain what to do and then wandered off in the other direction. It had been ages since he’d been in the store, not being overly fond of reading, but wandering the stacks was better than lingering by the door. He stumbled into the potions section where someone had squatted down to look at books on the bottom shelf. The hair was dark and unfamiliar, but the slope of those shoulders and the waistcoat Harry definitely recognized.
Malfoy had been putting things in the sink, but paused when Harry asked the question. “Questions, Potter,” he said quietly to the sink.
“I know.” Malfoy straightened up a little. “I know I am difficult and that I can’t answer your questions. I know I’ve asked too much from you. I wish I could explain.” He paused, took a deep breath, and then, for the first time since Harry had arrived home, looked Harry in the eye. “But I drank the tea.” He said it slowly, deliberately, and Harry suddenly remembered Malfoy’s direction the other morning.
“Look farther.” Atkinson knelt down next to Harry and ran a fingernail along his face. “Such a gift. What shall I do with you?”
Luis held his wand over the Mark, and Draco saw the dry, pale wood, unlike any wand he had seen before. “Diffindo.” Luis drew a shallow cut up his arm and turned it so that the blood would fall into a small bowl.
She exhaled shakily, already seeing how this would go. They were going to end up with a squalling baby in that flat because Sophie was perpetually hopeless with money. “Dray,” Tilly said softly.
And then they all waited, Thompson and Aziz with held breath at the door, Harry breathing hard in the effort to stare him down and keep him pinned to the wall. And then, just when Harry thought Thompson would try to intervene again, the Were looked away, leaned his head slightly and said. “James. My name is James.”
Ron started off the interview when Draco had a mouthful of pastry and was clutching his tea concerned that the hot cup might suddenly disappear. “What did you say to Dean?”
Draco sucked in air through his nose and held it for a brief second. “Just because I did not seek medical attention does not mean I was not injured. I sustained several cuts and bruises to my back.”
“He’s doing well, loving school.” He leaned casually on the counter. “Can I have all three of the pelts? As well as 3 Identification forms?”
Harry didn’t bother with the steps, just leapt down from the front of the dais, and made straight for Draco at the back. There must have been something in his expression, because people parted until finally,
“Merlin!” Draco slammed his glass down on the coffee table. He’d not drunk enough of it, and the firewhiskey sloped out over the side. “It’s not your job to save everyone!” He started towards the fireplace, just to have something else to look at, but Harry must have thought he wanted to leave, because he reached out again and wrapped his hand around Draco’s left forearm too tightly. Draco hissed in pain and tried to pull his arm back.
“No, but definitely a tourist. I’ve got my coffee now, so that’s one disaster averted.” Harry took another sip and started down the pavement. It was crowded with pedestrians and he had to swerve to get around the slower ones. “We’ve been working this mind numbing case, looking for some illegal exports.”
Harry blinked rapidly and filled his lungs with air as he suddenly remembered to breathe. “You have a nightmare, and you come here to read about Muggle things?”
Harry walked straight into the room, but Draco stayed outside. He leaned his shoulder against the wall and waited for nearly ten minutes. A nurse came and went in that time, and then Harry stepped out in the hall.
Draco nosed his shoulder, and Teddy threw an arm around his neck, burying his face in the thick fur there. “It’s so soft.” He rubbed his face against Draco, and Draco made a low pleased murmur.
Harry threw open the door to Robards office and said loudly, “I’m taking Draco home now. If you need him, I’ll bring him back tomorrow.” His voice was steely and cut through the room.
But Harry never did hear the rest of what Teddy said. His ears roared and a sickening dread raced through his veins. It was but a moment to get out the door, and Harry took the stairs two at a time at a full sprint all the way to the third floor with Hermione close behind. The stairs had never seemed so long.
But Draco was already in the doorway, and his feet must have been visible, because then Hermione was saying, “Is that him? Please talk to me! I just want to apologize. It was inexcusable the way I reacted last night and I--”
Escorted like a dog, that’s what Malfoy had said. Harry had thought he simply found it demeaning to have to be walked back and forth. But it was more than that, he was being told when he could and couldn’t work. Access to materials indeed! Malfoy pressed his lips together in a fine line. “How much time do you usually spend in your lab?” Harry interrupted suddenly.
Teddy peered up at Draco with big, big eyes, and for a moment, Harry worried Teddy would be afraid. “That’s so cool,” he said in an awed voice. “What kind?”
Draco and Faye gave him a blank stare, and then Draco said more to himself then anyone else, “We’ve got to get a telly.”
Jenkins looked up from the reports she had been reviewing. “Have you tried that friend of his, the one in England? I told him he could take a few days, maybe he decided to go.”
“That must be Potter,” Draco said, and then decided to go and say hello. It was odd for Potter to be awake so early, and Draco had assumed that the reason he hadn’t seen him today was because he’d still been asleep.
Harry nodded. It was unlikely, but better than stewing in his own thoughts. “King’s Head is over there.” Harry pointed towards the left. “That’s popular with some of the Packs.”
“I am certain they would have told me.” She ducked her head and added very softly, “We’ve missed him.”
“I did,” Harry told him. “Nobody drops off the face of the Earth for five years for good reasons. I think he’s in trouble.”
It showed at work. He had an earlier shift upstairs, for the afterwork crowd, and Melanie poked him in the arm during the lull around 6pm. “What’s up with you, Mr. Smiley Face?”
He climbed out of the bed. “I hate everything. I hate this flat and I hate my job and I hate my life. I can’t live like this any more!” He shouted, kicking at the bed hard so that his toe throbbed. And it felt good. The pain grounded him enough that he could take a deep breath and actually see Ron and Hermione for the first time. “I don’t want to hate my life.”
In addition to his scars, there were a number of small, surgical scars scattered across his chest and arms,  and these held Harry’s attention. There must have been nearly two dozen across his chest and upper arms. Some long, some short, but all thin, as if made with a scalpel. Harry couldn’t remember anything from school or the war that would have done that to Malfoy. “What happened to you?”
“I know, ‘Mione.” Harry pushed his own chair back. “I know. But we can’t make them show up if they don’t want to.”
“I know.” Draco looked towards the door. He was going to have to figure out how to handle Harry when Harry came back.
If he was going to do this, then he wanted to talk to Evan. Maybe Evan knew of a better job? Maybe he’d let Draco crash on his sofa? Maybe he needed a roommate like Tilly had said. There were nine million people in the city of London, he could find other people.
Harry swallowed and tried to smooth the matted fur. The blood drained from his face, because Draco was a risk. “No.”
Harry could smell him, and his hair was in his face again. He was warm and fit inside Harry’s arms just perfectly. He moaned a little, and Harry realized his cock was in his hand, and Harry’s cock was pistoning happily against him. The friction from his boxers was compounded by Malfoy’s warmth, and Harry was so close to an orgasm. It had been so long, and he was so warm and making those soft mewling noises, and thrusting up into his fist and back against him. So close, and closer and then Harry was coming and so was Malfoy.
“Yes!” She sniffed loudly, and Harry got close enough to the bed to catch her, when Draco moved his tail. Rosie fell into his arms, just at the moment the door slammed open a second time.
Draco tried to wrap his hands around Potter’s neck, and Potter ducked down to ram himself into Draco’s stomach. Except she stood there still, now with her wand out conjuring a barrier between them, and yanking Draco’s arms behind him. “Now you’re under arrest for assaulting an Auror. Merlin, Malfoy, were you trying to spend the night in holding?”
She reached across the table and laid a hand on his. “I’m worried about you, Harry. Ron said you were like this before, a little bit, always off on your own, always busy. ”
“Oh, I don’t think--” and then Harry was cut off by Hugo screaming and launching himself at Harry and landing on Rose.
After she set the glasses on the table, Harry pulled her down to sit in his lap. She smelled sweet, like strawberry shampoo, and Harry closed his eyes and breathed it in for a minute before pressing a kiss to her shoulder.
Draco sniffed, but then let it go. “Shopping. We need citric acid, sugar, baking soda, and flavoring.”
“I guess a lot of brilliant people are complete wankers.” Harry shrugged. It had taken him some time to admit it, but Dumbledore had been kind of a wanker. That didn’t make him less important to Harry, didn’t make him a less brilliant wizard, it didn’t make the choices he made wrong. It was just one more part of his personality. He reached for his own naan.
Draco dragged his tray down the line, selecting a chicken caesar salad and water. “Yes. My mother and I are having our last dinner together this evening. Granger invited me to lunch tomorrow, but after that, I’ll leave.” He picked up a chocolate cookie and handed Harry an extra large serving of treacle tart.
Potter went still, eyes trailing first up and then down over Draco, lingering over his shoulders, his stomach, stopping entirely at his cock. And Draco felt too hot and too cold and shivery all over. “Yeah. We don’t have to talk about it.”
“I don’t understand why you are so insistent on a job. Your family hasn’t worked for a living in centuries, probably since the Norman invasion.”
“Well, we are sure as hell going to try.” Hermione replied, angry. “And I’d say, based on what we’ve done before, that’s worth quite a lot.”
“What did you tell them?” Draco wasn’t sure why he asked, except that he wanted to know and was desperately afraid to know.
The afternoon was only an improvement in that the three of them divided the six terminals between them, so Draco didn’t have to look at Luis’s pointy, ratfaced face for the few hours it took to go through four days worth of boat arrivals and their travel arrangements. He left the names of the four boats with the Dock Master and was about to call it a day when Roxi gave him a call.
“Thanks Dad!” Ron called from the door and then the painful crack of apparition. Harry laid down on the sofa because that was easier than sitting up.
Draco pulled out his wand, and apparated to the Crown and Wand in London. On the street outside, he hesitated for a moment and then cast a glamour; no sense being Draco Malfoy for a few hours. Not when he could be literally anyone else.
“Yeah, except for the part where he’s sleeping in my bed again. God, is this what it’s like to have children?” She looked up, panicked.
McGonagall turned a stern gaze on Harry. “In the interest of privacy, I will not be disclosing that information.”
Draco opened his mouth and tried to find the words to explain what happened, but he couldn’t. Instead he wrapped his hands around one of the empty mugs, to have something solid to hold on to, and then stared at the bottom with hunched shoulders.
“You’re a person of interest,” Weasley admitted, and Draco’s heart sank. There was only one reason he could possibly be a person of interest.
She nodded. “Yes, Sawyer used to bring his mate, Draco, around for dinner sometimes. And of course, there was Ajax.”
“Great.” He arbitrarily put this memo in a different pile and picked up the next despite having not read it.
“Alright everybody,” Robards shouted over the din. “It’s a warehouse stuffed full of merlin knows what, and we’re going in as teams of two. Potter, Simmons, Fredricks, and Weasley you’re the front line, stunning spells only. Simmons, try to avoid getting doused in something this time. Kenton and Smith, you are back up. Walker, Grey, and Cox are collecting evidence. I want this quick and clean, people.”
“I am working your stupid case, on my day off, and I am hungry. I am going back to my flat in London, and I will be happy to continue this fruitless endeavour tomorrow, after I’ve slept a reasonable number of hours and eaten.” At which point, Atkinson noted the resolve in Harry’s tone, and rather than engage in a loud verbal battle with the Boy Who Lived, backed off. Besides, as far as Harry could tell, all the actual leads were in his flat. They took the floo back to Auror headquarters, and Harry apparated home.
Quickly, Harry turned on one heel, and set him down in the kitchen, making sure to fill the doorway so that Teddy couldn’t run back out in the garden. He’d learned quite a few lessons about parenting Teddy in the three years they’d all lived together.
It was exhausting work, opening and searching the containers. And it didn’t help that all the muggles were grumbling about the lack of information, complaining that they wouldn’t be able to find anything if they didn’t know what they were looking for.
“Shut it!” Something smacked against the door of the closet and Draco startled farther into the corner.
“Yeah,” Harry nodded, a little furrow of confusion on his forehead. “You’re the one who has been talking to him about things that are his and things that belong to everyone and the difference between the two.”
That seemed to appease her, because then she broke into a tentative smile. “How’s work going? Crack open any exciting cases?”
Draco stood up and tried to dust off his pants. “Astoria and I were taking a ride around the pond.” He stiffened and looked at Hermione.
But it sort of was to Harry, he didn’t know why exactly, but he wanted Jude to have a good time at Hogwarts. It felt imperative that he have a good experience, that he make friends and sleep through classes and watch Quidditch.
; he’d have to have a plan first. What to tell his mother, a job, a place to live. He’d need to pack, and there were things he would have to figure out how to hide, like his wand and any owls his mother might send. And a busboy? That really wasn’t the type of job he’d had in mind. Draco clenched his hands and sucked in a deep breath, money was money, who cared where it came from as long as he could get out of the Manor.
Harry pulled his head from the pensieve disappointed, and quickly dismissed the other two vials from the eight am hour. He’d had quite a clear view of all three early morning patrons.
Why were bathrooms so comforting? Harry wondered as he stood in front of the sink, splashing cool water on his face and trying not to panic. Was there something innately comforting or did he have some sort of conditioned response now as a result of all the-the other experiences in loos?
“I can turn the light on. Or, you can go out onto the balcony, if you want, if you think that might help.” Harry’s mouth was dry.
She was dressed in an ice blue pants suit with a crisp white shirt and a glittering sapphire necklace that Tilly was suddenly afraid was real. And she looked between the two of them uncertainly until Draco finally spoke. “This is Tilly. Tilly, this is my mother.”
He pulled his hand back, cocked his head to the side, and then said brightly. “Cake! You need cake!” With one last bright smile, he dashed out the door and back down the stairs.
“I have to have hope,” she admitted. “I have to believe that good people will stand up and do the right thing.”
“Just, just make sure she has a good time.” Jude clapped him on the shoulder. “You know, cause if she’s feeling good then she’s more likely to want to do it again.”
“Okay.” Draco agreed. They sat together, in front of the till, while Harry talked and Draco listened. And Harry didn’t let his leg brush against Draco’s and he didn’t bump his elbow against him, and he didn’t reach over and take his hand. They talked for fifteen minutes, and Draco said, “Well, maybe she just doesn’t feel like she can trust any of you. After all, you are Harry Potter and there’s no telling with Sarah and biting.”
Draco stepped back from the door leaving it open, not in an invitation, but in resignation; it wasn’t what Harry wanted, but he would take what he could get. He stepped inside and closed the door behind him. “Are you coming home?”
He didn’t notice as the blond bloke trailed slowly after him down the hall. Some of the students poked their heads out of their rooms, the air crackled quite literally, and Harry gave them all a quick but thorough look over.
But that message didn’t seem to be getting through, because Draco very nearly talked over him, “Cause I am not ready to get married. I am not grown up enough for that.”
But Draco was tired of staying inside, and the house smelled very much of Draco right now, marking it as clearly his territory. Faye and Vale were used to it, but there was no sense asking for trouble. “Perhaps outside?” Draco suggested.
Ajax slammed his forearm against Draco’s neck, pinching out the air. He leaned in close, breathed hotly on Draco’s ear while Draco squirmed, lungs screaming. “Follow the rules. Because next time you break one, don’t come back.” He kept his arm up, kept squeezing out the air until Draco’s vision started to go grey and he tilted his head to the side, baring his neck in submission.
“I’ll explain Life of Brian to you.” She stepped closer into the room. “It’s got all kinds of religious stuff in it, probably take all night. We’ll probably fall asleep on the sofa before we make it to the end.”
After a moment, Neil finally spoke. “Well, I guess you can make it up to me later. Come sit down, we’re listening to covers and originals and deciding who did it better.” He scooted over and patted the small space between him and the arm rest.
The taller one grinned, and the younger one snatched at Harry’s arm. It was a brief tug-o-war that Draco won but had the two of them stopped halfway to the kitchen. “Which one of you is Lacy and which one Marie?” Harry asked.
Harry let it go, stepped back from the bar and watched the empty space fill quickly with the next patron. Val raised her eyes in a question, Harry nodded towards the staircase. He didn’t speak until they reached the relative quiet of upstairs. “He said to come back later, after close.”
Neil shrugged and flopped onto his bed. “It’s fun. Don’t you ever want to be the guy who just takes what he wants?”
He gathered his cloak from the back of the other chair, adjusted the silver clasp, very plain, and stepped into the fireplace to floo to the Atrium.
She apparently took it as blaming. “What the fuck, Potter? Do everyone a favor and kiss and make up. Whatever it is just tell him, he’ll apologize and we can all go back to our normal lives.”
Jude huffed a sad laugh and shook his head. “Here’s pretty good. Maybe you don’t know what it’s like to be cold and hungry and surrounded by people who couldn’t really give a shit about you.”
“You’ve been on nights for six years, you know Jenkins would switch you to days if you asked,” Harry pointed out.
Alice nodded gently. “We can sort of feel each other. It might not wake him up, but it will be comforting to Draco.”
Draco leaned back on his heels and stared at the near sparkling porcelain. “I just hear that laughter. Sometimes I think I hear it while I’m awake, and it’s worse when I’m--” He turned then and looked at Harry. “You’re leaving tomorrow.”
It was easier on the edge of the dance floor, the air moved more, and the stink of stale alcohol and sweat wasn’t as overpowering. It was closer to the bar, and Draco was on his third vodka tonic. He was relaxed, and the music pounded in a fierce beat that slammed at his ribs and through his veins and all that energy finally had an outlet. He pulled Sawyer close, thrust his thigh between his legs, and rode the high.
He looked over at the bed, at where her hair spilled over the pillow in blood red waves. Where Harry should be sleeping happily. He took a reassuring breath, and then went back to bed, curled on his side so that he could look at her. At the soft curve of her face and the paleness of her skin. Harry had always liked her skin, pale with bright flecks of color across her shoulders and cheeks. He liked the contrast, the way it was so starkly different but fit together so perfectly. It was probably his favorite thing about Ginny.
Robards nodded absently. “After she’s done here, have her stop by my office and I’ll collect her statement then.” he stepped over to the doorway, and then looked back at Harry who was setting the tea down on a table and pulling a chair closer to the bed. “I’ll expect your report by tomorrow morning.”
Draco immediately coughed on nothing at all, and Harry rushed over to pat him on the back. “Are you okay?”
They all knew what she was asking, the three of them, standing awkwardly in front of the table while a waiter watched from another doorway. Draco had been thinking hard about how to answer this question, and, after a long uncomfortable moment, said. “She’s not, and if that’s going to be a problem for you, then we are going to leave.”
It had barely shut before he vomited all over the Persian carpeting in the corridor. For several minutes, Draco knelt on the floor and dry heaved, the smell stinging his nose just as the bile ate away at his throat. No one came to check on him, not his mother, not the house elves, no one.
“Harry!” Ron called gratefully at the sight of him. “How are you mate?” He scooted around Hermione away from Lacy and Marie with a grimace. “Where can I get one of those?” He pointed at Harry’s glass.
“No I--” Harry cut himself off. “It’s just, really impressive. I mean you’re sort of brilliant to be able to do all that.”
They made up plates, Harry taking a bit of everything (except the aubergine), and Ginny loading up on noodles.
He sighed loudly in the empty room, suddenly overwhelmed with the idea of not finding Draco ever while Harry sat in the room that almost literally embodied Draco.
e put a hand on his left arm, felt the itch and the way he couldn’t fill his lungs. Draco ducked behind a large rubbish bin. He couldn’t go back to the Manor, not with his HMother always talking about this nice young witch with such good
And so Harry apparated out, appearing just outside the Leaky, which was lit up with Christmas decorations. It looked like half the department had arrived already, and Harry continued in his dithering outside the door for another minute.
And Jude looked at Draco uncertainly for a moment, not quite sure what to make of that statement. Every once in a while Harry said stuff like that. Like in the letter he had written Jude saying that Jude would be living at Grimmauld Place for the summer, like the way he had just marched up to the train to collect Jude, like the way he still sometimes stopped by the house with a pint of ice cream. Harry didn’t say it so much, but Jude felt the same way as he did now, as if there was a place for him. At least for a little while.
Greyson shrugged. “Probably in the library, but I doubt it. She and I used to talk about it, before Marie broke things off. She didn’t know anything then, I doubt she knows anything now.”
Their waiter brought out the food, steaming and delicious smelling. Harry stomach rumbled, but instead of digging right in, Harry waited for Hermione to start speaking again.
Malfoy gave one jerk of a nod, and Harry placed the tote gently on the table. “May I?” Malfoy asked, but didn’t wait for an answer before lifting the first pelt from the tote. He lifted it carefully, with his hands gently cupped around the head. It stretched out almost six feet and covered nearly the full length of the table. Malfoy ran his hands gently across the grey fur, along what would have been the sides and then starting at the top of the head and all the way down to the tail. He leaned down at the head, pressed his forehead down to the wolf’s forehead and said, “I am sorry, my brother.” And then he straightened. “I don’t know this one.”
Jude and Sarah took their tea to the sofa and curled around each other, Tilly and Evan lingered quietly in the kitchen. They’d each added a shot of rum to their now cooling cups on the counter. And Draco stared out the balcony door, as if he might be able to discern the events of the night from the cloudy sky, his wand still in his hand.
And Harry smiled a little as they climbed into the carriage. “I meant, just in the place, not at the table with you. I won’t talk to him or anything.”
“I’m not proposing!” Harry said, voice wild and panicky. Because even though he had bought the ring to propose, he’d sort of forgotten that people actually used Fede rings to propose and he hadn’t meant it that way at all, and now he was going to have to say something and he had no idea what to say.
A little over an hour later, the apartment was cleaner than it had been since Harry moved in. And even though it was time for the supermarket, Harry dithered, sorting the laundry into piles for washing and digging out the detergent. He wasn’t really thinking about laundry though. All week, Malfoy had been the one doing the cooking, but Malfoy didn’t leave the flat. Harry certainly didn’t want to do something with Malfoy, but should he ask what kind of groceries to buy?
“Sorry, I’ve got a really busy morning, but tomorrow, maybe you can give me an update. I’ll see you at noon for lunch.” And then she was disappearing back to her office.
“Wherever he lived while he was working at the Department.” Ron wasn’t shouting, but he wasn’t shouting in that way that said he really wanted to.
Finally, Draco had to admit this was not going to end the way he wanted. He pushed the man away gently. “I appreciate the offer, I do. But I don’t perform well with an audience.” His gaze flicked to Potter, and the man’s too. And then he was standing up, smiling a goodbye, and disappearing back onto the dance floor.
“We would know if Draco Malfoy was a Werewolf; he would be on the registry,” Robards interrupted again. “Potter, I understand that you are in a unique situation with your godson and Remus Lupin, but this kind of behavior--”
“Ah, you must be Auror Potter, please, come in.” He gestured to the two chairs in front of his desk and quickly put aside a long piece of parchment. “Forgive the mess, I’ve got a pile of essays to grade by five this evening. How can I help you?”
“He’s half, and I can smell that too. Maybe he’s never shifted, maybe he’ll never shift, but I can smell him, Potter, and he smells like me.”
Evan turned, a squirmy child in his arms trying to grab at Draco’s door knob. “Sometimes I can’t decide if she is the nicest person in the world or if she’s about to embark on a quest for world dominance.”
“I want to go out.” Neil grinned fiercely, in that way that reminded Draco of mischief and fun and being young.
At the end, Teddy gathered up his dishes and skipped them into the kitchen. “That’s all thanks to you, you know,” Harry said to Draco who looked up, startled, from his plate.
The floors still creaked, and the spokes on the banister were still broken, and they hadn't been able to do anything about the disturbing wallpaper in the parlour, but there were entire rooms in the house now that were pleasant for sitting in. But without Jude and his wry smiles and his eye rolling and his half shrugs, Harry just didn’t feel like trying to change the paint color in the kitchen or figure out how to repair the tile or move whatever was living under the stairs to the back garden.
So, I feel like a part of me wrote the entire first nine chapters just so that I could write the epilogue. It is far and beyond my favorite part of this story.
“As planned. I had hoped to get a little farther on the generators today, but some delays are to be expected, I suppose.” Draco gave a small shrug.
“Hm.” He made another mark. “We’ll be making our decision at the end of the week, and will inform all candidates. Have a good day.”
Malfoy left the door open and ambled back over to his mostly assembled generator. “I have a lot of work to do here.” He sat down and picked up the cover for the generator.
“Thanks,” and if the word came out a little gruffer then Jude had intended, that could easily be chalked up to him not sleeping as much as he should.
Draco smiled sadly and dug out a spoonful. “Yeah, but I’ll never make up for all the terrible things I did.”
Harry woke up because the bed next to him was empty. It was still warm, so Draco couldn’t have been gone long, and Harry lay quietly in the dark flat and listened for any sound of him. And there, he could hear Draco in the loo; it sounded like he was scrubbing.
When Harry’s alarm buzzed in the morning, the room was back to normal, the dishes and sofa not fixed but carefully arranged for a quick reparo.. Malfoy was sitting on the cement of the balcony, and Harry walked outside. “What was that last night? And don’t say puppies and rainbows.”
For a long moment they all just stood there, between the door and the stairs in some sort of strange standoff, until Potter said, “Help me get him inside.”
“Don’t care.” They stepped into his office and Jenkins snatched his coffee cup (a half litre monstrosity) that he gulped down. “I don’t like this business with the Weres. We have a crime half the department thinks isn’t a crime at all, the Weres all are itchin’ for a fight over it, and the one Auror I can count on to actually work the case well is out twice this week. I don’t like it at all, Potter.”
“Something about this doesn’t smell right,” Harry said loudly to everyone who could hear. “And I will get to the bottom of it.”
Draco returned to the Little Guest Room (the least offensive of all the bedrooms). But instead of putting on pajamas, he paced around the furniture, thoughts moving around and around as he walked from the door around the bed, to the wardrobe and back around to the desk before moving back to the door. Spinning in figure eights. A chance to rejoin wizarding society, to bring honor and glory to the Malfoy name, to become a wizard others looked up to in the English magical community.
Val opened her mouth to say something, probably about interfering with an investigation, but Harry nudged her leg with his. “How long were you and Sawyer together?”
It was like looking at a car wreck or a particularly strange crime scene; Harry should be angry, but instead felt a little bit impressed. “I’ll order some take away. Put the dirty dishes in the sink and the food in the trash,” Harry said, opening the nearest drawer and glancing through his takeaway menus. “Do you like Chinese?”
Lord either. He swallowed again and then continued very, very quietly, “Voldemort wanted to rid the world of people like you and your sister, and I did a lot of very bad things in his name.”
But it did. It lasted and lasted, and lasted. Until, somehow, Spring melted into summer and they were spending more nights together then not.
Lacy, Marie, Sophie, Mama Gigi, and another sister Harry hadn’t met yet all looked at Draco. And so Harry looked at Hermione for help.
“And he had broad shoulders, fit in the palm of my hand when I sank down on him.” Draco continued, hand and breath shaking.
Grace pushed her plate away. “Yeah, I don’t talk about him much. My parents were always upset with him, always fighting. He’d stay out late, they didn’t like his friends. He dropped out of college, and they hated that. It took me a long time to find out the truth. No one would tell me, even he wouldn’t talk to me about it. Draco reminds me of him.”
There wasn’t anything else, just the strong smell of iron, so Draco poured a small drop onto one of his slides and then got his microscope back out. Underneath the magnification, the liquid sparkled brightly, almost so brightly as to glow. Draco increased the magnification, to see between the sparkles, and then he could see the pattern in the flashes, the same pattern he saw in the wiggentree and the dragon liver. It had  the same red tint in the sparkle as the dragon liver too.
“It should be the day of the full moon,” Draco said suddenly. “If they view the memory, there will be questions about Pack and shifting and wolfsbane and hyssop. We can give a demonstration at sundown.”
Draco pulled things out and grouped them together according to how they would be assembled. “I am. I went into the Auror Academy with the designation, but there’s less call for that sort of thing in America. And when there is, it’s often potion based. I spend a lot of my time on research and development. Reverse Engineering dark potions and brewing up antidotes, that sort of thing. Although, lately I’ve been experimenting with protective gear.”
Draco opened his eyes to see Potter standing between him and the bar. Why did he have to be so fucking fit with his shoulders and his muscles? His hair was still awful, thick and curly and wild, and he was dressed in denims and a t shirt, presumably to fit in at the club. But he stood tall and distant, observing without partaking. On duty then.
Because that laugh had usually been accompanied by a flash of green light and the death of an innocent.
“I don’t have one for you.” Harry sighed. “Now, I’m going to make sure he is okay.” He didn’t wait for her answer before opening and just as quickly shutting the door.
Of course, someone had sabotaged his lab. And there were no guarantees here. In America he had already carved out a life, a good life with purpose and meaning. New York was safe, and what exactly had ambition gotten him or his father for that matter? Nothing good.
So, sending Val at all possible opportunities was going to be the best option then. Harry quickly took the hall on the left. It would add time to his walk, but it meant he didn’t have to deal with Jessica on her way to reception. He opened the door, “Sorry about the wait--Malfoy?”
“Fine. I’ll be working with an Unspeakable for the duration and outfitting all of their department as well as the Aurors. It seems as if we may work well together, although it’s hard to make a determination after only one day.” He sipped at his soup slowly.
“No, I will make that happen. The choice is this, do you want to be the person responsible for bringing Greyback in?”
Roxi has informed me that I did not actually say that I am sorry, but merely implied it. So, I’m sorry Potter. But seriously, did you go out and pull last night? Bored minds need to know. DM
“Um,” he started and tried to find the words. He took a deep breath, like his therapist said he should, and thought about the beginning like she said. He waited for the words to arrive, didn’t try to force them up, just breathed until he found them. “There’s some students at Hogwarts who are struggling, and McGonagall and I were discussing a sort of mentor group.”
And Harry grabbed the non-bruised shoulder, leaving behind five small purple marks in anger or desperation or something else entirely. “I told you to get out!” He yanked open the door so hard the handle broke through the plaster of the wall. And then he threw Draco out to stumble down the steps, naked.
When he opened them again, it was to stare straight into the wide eyes of one of the perps who was not nearly as quick on the draw as Harry. “Petrificus Totalus,” Harry whispered, and his whole body snapped together.
“Why mine?” Draco looked down at his arm, at where he had let Luis slice him open, remembered how the blood had welled up and dripped into the bowl. The same way the knowledge welled up inside him and dripped into his consciousness. Why him? Why Malfoy Manor? Why cut through the Dark Mark? “It’s because I’m evil,” he choked and dropped the tea, every bit of him trembling.
“No!” Harry said entirely too loudly. “No, Ginny’s planned this whole big party tonight, at the Tipsy Dragon.”
The Auror department was a very different place at 10 o’clock in the morning versus 10 at night. In the morning, Aurors were busy at their desks, writing reports, making appointments with suspects and victims, and reviewing evidence. They were walking briskly between the small kitchenette and the conference room for meetings and joking with their partners. Memos buzzed through the air as both internal and external communication.
“I don’t know,” Hermione said quietly because Harry was on the verge of a breakdown, the size of which she hadn’t thought possible.
The room was quiet, and Alice licked her lips slowly. “Do you know the story of Romulus and Remus?” she asked.
Draco closed his eyes and remembered being on the Tube with Evan and Tilly and thinking they were all about to be torn to shreds by Fenrir Greyback. How Evan had talked to him. He remembered months later, just before little Lila was born, when he’d woken Tilly with a nightmare, and they’d been up all night talking--about everything. And she’d suggested he try therapy, that her therapist had been a Squib, that maybe Draco could talk to her.
The retrieval unit was specially trained to gather and preserve evidence from all types of crime scenes. When they arrived, Harry was peering at the body, trying to see some sort of pattern to the mauling, trying to see the body as evidence rather than something that used to be human.
“Good morning,” Harry puffed up his chest. “We are here today in part to honor the sacrifices of those who gave their lives to defeat Voldemort and also to celebrate the new found unity in our community.” His hands were sweating, and Harry rubbed them uselessly against his robes. “Seventeen years ago, my parents gave their lives in a valiant effort to destroy Voldemort, and I stand here today because of their sacrifice. I am honored to represent them and pleased to announce the reopening of Fortescue’s Ice Cream Shoppe. This place will be a meeting place for witches and wizards everywhere, a place for families and friends, a place of hope for the future.”
He yanked open his wardrobe and riffled through the shirts and jumpers. Most of them were left over from Hogwarts or he’d worn them around the Manor while
Harry hesitated, these moments were often deeply personal for the families of victims and there were policies meant to offer respect to the dead. But these dead had not been offered that same respect, and Harry didn’t want to infringe on them any more than had already been done.
“One day, when they were both old enough, Remus and Romulus swore an oath to be forever loyal to each other for they were brothers forged in the wilderness. A city grew in the land they had always considered their own as they became young men. Young Remus fell in love with a beautiful witch who was tied to the land, and Romulus danced at their wedding. But there are those who claim that Romulus loved her just as Remus did, and never forgave his brother for being the man her affections fell upon.”’
Draco jerked back as if hit by the forcefulness of her tone. He was, of course, being childish and at twenty-eight there were many behaviors he should have put aside. But he still felt churlish and no longer interested in eating. “Of course, Mother. I do believe the international travel has tired me more than I expected. Please excuse me.” He stood up from the table and walked determinedly out of the room.
“Ate. Ate. He wants to know what I ate. Can I answer that? Can I tell him breakfast. What was breakfast? Toast? Eggs? Porridge? Can’t remember.” He continued to mutter about food, and Harry realized he hadn’t eaten anything.
There was a coffee pot on the counter, half full of old coffee; Draco couldn’t look away from the thick liquid “I don’t want to be that person any more.”
“I’m sure it went fine.” Harry abandoned the idea of finishing the report and tossed it on the corner of his desk. “These things always feel like they went bad.” Not that Harry would know, Robards hadn’t ever interviewed Harry, just mentioned there was a desk with his name on it at some event that Harry couldn’t even remember anymore.
“I don’t.” Malfoy dropped his hand. “If you won’t take me to bed, take me outside. I want to see the moon.”
Harry had already turned the final corner when he realized that Malfoy was no longer behind him. Quickly, Harry turned back and saw Malfoy at the door. All the color had drained from his face, and his chest was heaving up like he was gasping for breath. His hand was raised as if to touch the glass.
Andromeda bustled into the entryway then, digging around in her bag and not looking until she bumped into Harry. “Oh, good morning.”
“Okay, sorry,” Harry said, but Malfoy clearly couldn’t hear him. “You need a shower.” He sighed and walked over to the bathroom. Something was clearly not right in the Department of Ministries.
Draco jerked up and sniffed, and then buried his head in his hands again. Only a second knock roused him from the chair. “Just a minute!” He shouted, letting anger and tiredness color his tone, and Draco plucked his pants from the floor.
“Yeah.” Malfoy nodded. “Old bitey McBite Face wasn’t too picky about who he turned, as long as they were young. There’s a few muggle Weres now.”
For a moment longer Greyson stared at Harry. “You mean like two months ago? Merlin, that was like forever ago. She was seeing this guy, total arsehole, texted in the middle for the night, called the dorm room at all hours. Kept waking Jenna up, and she was pissed as all get out over it. And Marie was all messed up over it too, got real quiet and defensive. I talked to her about it, and a few days later she said she was all done with the guy.”
“He must suck cock like it’s water.” Ron scowled at his retreating back, and Harry saw the slight falter in Draco’s steps.
“I don’t want you to go.” Harry took Draco’s hand again, tugged until Draco looked at him. “You came to me for a reason. I know I can help you. Let’s talk to Hermione.”
“I gave you clean clothes to wear,” Harry said as he set the chicken on the counter and put away other items. He didn’t ask about the blood; he didn’t want to know.
Harry tucked the paper into a folder and glanced up at the clock. It was after ten. He stood up and looked out where Malfoy was still leaning on the rail and looking up at the stars. “I’m going to bed. I’ll put some blankets and pillows on the sofa for you.” Malfoy didn’t move, and Harry wasn’t sure if he could even hear him.
He watched for a moment, Malfoy on his knees, impossible to see his face, but impossible not to know what was going on. It wasn’t as if Harry hadn’t seen other patrons in the same position, but it was different to see Malfoy there, to know he sucked cock, and based on the expression on the other man’s face, to know he was good. It stirred up all sorts of feelings he had been working so hard not to feel.
It took three trips for Ron and Harry to get all six of the potioneers back to headquarters and into interrogation rooms. Miles and Garret were the pair in charge of this case and had the first potioneer, the youngest of the six crying in less than ten minutes.
“Yes.” Draco rolled his eyes. “Is this how you normally conduct interrogations? With well known facts and obvious statements? Perhaps you’d like to know when I stopped hating Harry.” Draco paused, remembering the moment he realized he no longer hated Harry. “Perhaps not, it might be too salacious for your delicate sensibilities.”
“Uh-huh,” Ginny leered at him. “The toilet. Well, you boys have fun!” She also got up. “I have an early practice tomorrow, so I’m calling it a night.” She stared pointedly at Harry.
That whole plan fell apart after Harry got up for the loo. He was standing in front of the urinal when the door slammed open, and Draco drawled, “Well, I certainly didn’t imagine seeing quite so many famous people in this lowly pub. One or two can be expected, but a whole table of war heroes, who knew?”
“Well,” Harry started to say, and then Draco was slipping an arm around his waist and leaning into him.
Ginny had planned Harry’s party perfectly. She’d rented out a corner of his favorite bar and invited all of his favorite people. She’d ordered two dozen cases of firewhiskey, a chocolate cake, and ice cream. And, alright, Harry would probably be disappointed that Jude had sent his regrets, but Hermione and Ron were going to be there, and Luna and Rolf, Neville and Hannah, George had promised to stop by after closing the shop. Dean and Seamus had come into town just for the night. It was going to be a hugely successful evening, she was just sure.
Draco tried again to speak, but his vision was going and it was hard to think now, sluggish and thick in his brain. He did have one last thought before passing out, that he needed to get home to Teddy because the full moon was in two days. He’d promised.
With the door shut, the airflow restricted, Draco couldn’t smell them, and he hoped furtively that they might stop at the second floor. Perhaps someone had their own sprog and Teddy was taking this other child up to his room to show off some toy or another? Draco clung to that hope as the footsteps continued up, and up, and up.
Jude looked at the counter and a little bit of ice cream dribbled to the floor. Harry thought about Hermione and sharing that tent with her, he thought about quiet evenings with hot cocoa and listening to the wireless, and how he wouldn’t have survived any of that without her. About how grateful he had been to see Ron.
Tilly slid an arm around his waist, and they both looked down at the little silky, cottony scraps of fabric. Better to be safe than sorry.
They were both busy watching the spell work when the door slammed open. “Expelliarmus!” Harry shouted.
He growled a little at the thought and knocked Malfoy’s hand away so that he could wrap both hands across his stomach and chest and feel the long line of the scar that had torn him apart, left him a puddle on the bathroom floor, and
Harry tapped his finger against his lip. It would be much harder to investigate Malfoy outside of Hogwarts; he’d have to be much sneakier. And he’d actually have to follow him around which would complicate things, what with work and Ron already knowing what Harry was going to do.
Jenkins put down her file, clasped her hands in front of her, and looked intently. “What are you not saying Roxi? Just spit it out.”
The waitress came over and took their orders. Hermione ordered curry, to no one’s surprise. Draco and Harry both ordered pad thai and Ron ordered some sort of soup dish. The conversation drifted a bit after the waitress left to Auror office politics which Draco didn’t know much of anything about. But he kept his hand on Harry’s knee, and at some point, Harry moved his hand over top, lacing their fingers together. It was, all in all, a shockingly pleasant lunch.
Jude got up from his desk and made for the main lobby, and Harry realized if Jude was going for the apparition point, then there was no way Harry would be able to follow him. But if Jude went right, towards the floos, then Harry would be able to at least listen in for a lead.
“Don’t be a baby.” Evan shook his head when Draco flinched at the sight of the blowtorch on the cedar chips. “It’s just a little fire.”
From his hiding spot around the corner, Draco listened to them walk from the dining room to the parlour. The nine circle of hell could reach out a fiery hand that would scorch Draco where he stood before he would dare walk into that room. As a child he’d longed to know what his parents talked about when they took guests in there, but whatever they discussed could not possibly block the memories Draco had of that room now, of kneeling on the floor, of gut wrenching pain, of that high piercing scream of a laugh.
Luckily Potter couldn’t hear it over the noise of the club. He asked, “What have you been doing?” as if there were two old acquaintances who just happened to run into each other and were catching up.
“I just have a lot of stuff to do.” He started, stopped, and then started again. “Actually, it’s just one thing, but it’s really frustrating.”
For a moment they stood that way, with Harry frozen and Jude’s shoulders trembling, and then Harry wrapped his arms around Jude and held him close.
Halliwell led the way to the lifts, the Healers and remaining spectators quickly parting to let them pass. It was silent in the lift, crowded with the four of them. Harry put his hand on the scruff at Draco’s neck, kept running his fingers through the fur and thinking, don’t die don’t die, over and over. Alice had her nostrils flared, trying to get a better idea of what was happening.
Draco shrugged again. “She’s family.” This conversation really wasn’t going in the direction Draco wanted. “Hey, so, you pull here, yeah?”
“Walking and talking.” Draco started back down to the tube station. He sighed loudly again. Today was a day for much sighing. “Neil might know something about where Sarah went.”
Draco pushed open the door and heard the jingle of the bell overhead. The tables were crowded with clusters of retirees socializing or mothers with young children standing on chairs. But no one stood in line at the counter.
“Thanks anyway.” Harry cast a quick tempus. He needed to get back to the office and work on Malfoy’s case before Atkinson stopped by again.
But he couldn’t. People like Hannah Abbott would never let him. And Harry, Harry could never give up Ginny Weasley--too many expectations. It wasn’t fair of Draco to hold that temptation in front of him; it wasn’t fair
Draco couldn’t face Evan after the fight with Potter. Longbottom’s voice really did carry through the room, and Evan had ears just as well as the next person. Draco hastily stood up, his legs shaking underneath him and he pulled his wand, beech with unicorn hair and a Ministry tracker. He’d probably get another outrageous fine, punishment for breaking the Statute of Secrecy this time, but he just couldn’t stay here any longer.
In what might have been a moment of brilliant insight into Malfoy, Harry offered,“We could stop by the kitchenette for tea. You seem like you need tea.”
“But I can.” Hermione raised her chin. “I’ll talk to her, but you’ll have to release her into Harry’s custody. That’s the only way Harry will leave.”
It was a long hour that required a lot of backtracking from that evening to the night at the University to the War. And by the time they had covered the entire thing, which included a brief interlude to discuss things Draco would have rather stabbed out his eyes than discuss, Draco was completely worn out. His head dropped to the side a bit as he said, for the third time, “Tilly and I are
Potter smiled then, the first genuine smile he had probably ever given Draco. “I never thought any of that.”
“I know. And we’re just worried now, with Trevor being gone, that you're going to pull away from us again.”
“Is there someone else there?” Harry asked. Because whoever Drace had brought home was neither subtle nor quiet.
His stomach clenched into a painful knot as he stepped up to the counter. “Hello, I’m investigating this transaction here.” He held out the parchment, Gringotts logo blazing from the top, the single transaction after months and months of nothing alone in the middle.
“Draco Malfoy is missing, kidnapped and we are going to find his remains in a few days if we don’t act now. We need everyone available to scour the city for him.” Harry repeated, feeling a bit like he was talking to Teddy about why it was important to knock before opening a door, exasperated with intentional stupidity.
Sophie ran her fingers through Draco’s hair, the soft gold strands. “You know, this would be pretty easy to dye. If you’re worried about being recognized.”
It was enough to give Harry pause, because these night usually went one of two ways: Harry started poking holes in the wards on the house itself and Pansy went a bit crazy trying to stop him until Draco appeared in the doorway or Harry started poking holes in the wards and Pansy ran into the house to shove Draco out the front door.
