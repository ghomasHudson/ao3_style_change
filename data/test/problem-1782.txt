Slowly turning around, he spotted the youngest Weasley-Granger hiding behind the doorframe of the living room. Narrowing his eyes, he replied on a whim, "No, I am a tooth fairy."
Chuckling at his Auror's bad conscience, the wizard shook his head. "No, but I had Vermilia look into it. According to her, no part of the young Malfoy's file refers to his wand."
"You could stay here, you know," Draco interrupted quietly. "Harry would invite you in a heartbeat. He has a 'saving people' thing."
Raising his eyebrows, Draco inquired, "What has you in such a good mood, Weasley?"
Harry could not tell if his best friend really believed in what he said, or if he merely tried to sooth his wife. But in the end, it did not matter, because their girl would not have it.
The Lady hesitated for a second, studying both Harry and then the cloak, but then followed after her husband's liege without a word. Some things were better left unknown.
"Draco," Harry sighed, gently touching the other's wrist, rubbing soothingly over the pulse points. "That is not on you."
"You!" The Minister tilted his head. "But not all of us were blessed with your genius for brewing. The majority have to make do with what they have."
Astoria was planning on doing something incredible for the Malfoy family. Something many witches and wizards undoubtedly thought they did not deserve. Lucius had made many mistakes and done unspeakable things he could never atone for. But he tried. Every day he went to the Ministry where he was treated like a bus-boy. 'File this.', 'Fetch that', 'Copy that', 'Scribe this interrogation', 'Go, get lunch'. It was demeaning, but now and then he was allowed to offer advice and the few times that happened made it all worth it in the former Lord's mind. At least that's what Lucius had told him all those months ago when he had started working with Hermione. Things had somehow gotten worse after the Sandorn trial. A few of Hermione's colleagues considered Lucius responsible for their friend losing his job, needling him with useless and debasing tasks he had to perform diligently, nevertheless. One evening, after a particular trying day, the pureblood had shared that a collection of funds had been set up, so Sandorn did not need to pay reparations from his own vaults. Harry had called Hermione immediately after dinner, but the witch had not wanted to talk about it. Ron had told him the next day that their library was - once again - sorted by genre rather than alphabetically.
is a lovely headline, don't you think?"
"Excuse me?"
Narcissa shook her head. "Not yet."
The Potion Master, however, was unwilling to change the subject. Furiously, he accused, "Harry risked everything for you! Do you really think it endeared him to the public that he spoke up for a former Death Eater? He could still lose his job if it's discovered that you betrayed him!"
"You are aware that you cannot keep it?" Lucius asked after a while. He had debated with himself to find a way for his son to enjoy the gift that seemed so precious to him but had found none. "The boy himself said that he had intended to give it to Potter."
“Alright, let’s see if I can calm Draco.”
Pressing her hands together, so her knuckles turned white, Narcissa shared, "Harry sent us home. He said this was a Ministry operation and that he can't have civilians in the field."
Lucius shudder was answer enough.
"That's right. I forgot …"
For the first time in six days, Harry was home in time for dinner. It might be Saturday, and one could argue that he should have been home anyway. But that did not bother the young Auror particularly. As far as he was concerned, his position had never been a nine−to−five job. Some days, he and Neville held elaborate discussions about the current style of dress−robes or the advantages of one fertiliser over the other. In short, they idled their days away with a minimum of paperwork and a maximum of relaxation. And then there were weeks like this, where weekends meant nothing, and sundown merely reminded them to cast Lumos.
"I have a godmother?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Kreacher?" Harry asked fondly when the elf turned away.
When the blond avoided his eyes, Harry pulled back. "Sorry. It's really none of my business. I shouldn't have asked."
Considering this to be a likely estimation, Ginny nodded. "I'll put it on the list. And about keeping him in bed ... I might be able to call in some reinforcements."
Stepping up to it, Charles Leewood made a few elaborate gestures, before he stated baffled, "Longbottom is right. Though these are the strongest, oldest concealment charms I have ever encountered. This is the beginning of a passage to Merlin knows where."
For a heartbeat, the other stiffened, but then Harry wove his hands into blond strands and pulled Draco even closer until they were fused, returning the kiss with desperate enthusiasm.
Blushing to his roots, so that it was visible even in the light of the few lanterns that illuminated the patio, the raven-haired immediately stammered through a protest. "Draco … he … I … he and I … we are not … we never have!"
"Are you sure this is a good idea?" The raven-haired doubted. "What you're explaining is pretty invasive. I don't want to damage them by accident."
After four hours of intense interrogation - you had to give it to these elves, they were exceedingly persistent - Harry called Emerald away from Ruby. The other elf seemed close to tears, anyway. Not that the raven-haired felt any compassion. In his mind, the tiny elf was the only obstacle between him and Draco. But Emerald was getting frustrated and seemed ready to tackle her to get some answers. However, from Harry and Neville's point of view, Ruby was incapable of answering their-slash-Emerald's questions. Every time the elven child insinuated that she was neglecting her duties, Ruby tried to bash her head against the table, yet still refused to reveal Draco's location. Upon Harry's request, Emerald hopped off the table, where she had towered over the other elf, but allowed herself one cutting, parting remark, "Ruby is being a bad elf, and Mistress will surely give her clothes for allowing harm to come to Master-Draco-Sir!"
Severus raised eyebrow conveyed the challenge, without a single word. 'Bring it on!'
"So, you don't want to go?"
--O-O--
"Whom do you want to prank?"
To avoid conflict, the young man had decided to make himself as sparse as possible. The more he hovered in the background, the better his chances of avoiding a confrontation.
"Bad enough. Fortunately, you have a sensible partner, who at least tries to keep you out of trouble."
The group, sans Lucius, chuckled because they all knew how much Harry aborted his social responsibilities. He enjoyed going out with his friends, but all the invitations he received just because the host or hostess wanted to parade around the ‘saviour of the wizarding world’ … well, he would gladly do without them.
"Out of what?"
On the inside, the tool-shed was oval-shaped, 10 feet in diameter and at least 15 lengthwise. Slightly off-centre was a ritual circle that seemed to be melted into the ground. The markings were made of a silvery substance that shimmered in all colours of the rainbow if the moonlight hit it just right. Looking up, Severus noticed that there was no roof, bathing the entire space in natural light. The moon was waxing, a few more days and it would be full. Crouching down, he reached out for the silver substance, but only touched it after Harry's encouraging nod. "It …" unsure of how to describe the sensation, he settled on, "it feels like me … like my magic."
So much for keeping his spying hidden.
"But you aren't brewing an antidote," the redhead mumbled.
--O-O--
"Understand what?"
"… governess," Harry finished, slowly catching up. Not that there was much to catch up to, seeing how the two witches were still standing arm in arm. An ebony-haired, slight pureblood beauty, next to a strawberry blond no-nonsense witch who reminded him of Hermione, not in appearance but definitely in mannerism, with her practical, sturdy robes and woven-back hair.
Trading a look with his colleague, the older wizard chose to reply. "To be completely honest, almost anything will do. With Hermione Granger-Weasley gone, the Ministry leaves a horrible impression on our security measures. The newspapers will say that we can't even protect our own. So how are we supposed to protect them?"
"Harry Potter!" The young witch hissed but was ignored for now.
Choosing a place beside his two best friends, Harry guided Draco along to stand between himself and Hermione.
Neville was the first to speak after the tale was finished. "But if you have all this knowledge at the tip of your fingers, why abduct the others?"
"Because the way people like the Durselys go about it always felt wrong to me. Like 'faith' was a coat you put on when it suited you and take off when it didn't. I can't imagine any god being okay with that. And since he's that all-powerful being … I just can't believe that he's real." Tousling his hear, he looked at his friend. "I'm sorry. I don't mean to offend."
Shaking his head, Hermione claimed a place behind her husband, putting a strong hand on his shoulders before she replied, "No, professor, we want you to make him understand that the war is over."
Back at the Ministry, Harry found Neville in their office, where the usually so compliant wizard sat at his desk, arms folded. The brunet did not say anything, but then, he did not need to. Nothing but complete and utter honesty would bring Neville around. Hence, Harry opened the locked compartment of his desk and pulled out Rosier's file. Wordlessly, he handed it over.
While Hermione nearly jumped in surprise, still a little dazed over what had happened, Ron gratefully accepted a clean pocket square their former professor and rolled up the three hairs; the unicorn had gifted them. Still, he asked, "Why did it do that?"
Anchanee
With a sigh, Robarts wanted to know, "Where is she waiting?"
--O-O--
"Go, pick up your baby-girl," Harry smiled, hugging Ron for a moment, before switching to Hermione. "Thank you, guys. I don't know what I would have done without you."
"Harry," Draco stated with forced calm. "You know who killed Rosier. You knew, three days ago. You just didn't allow yourself to think about it."
--O-O--
After a few minutes of tense silence, Snape instructed, "Leave, and think about what you could have done better!"
Or not. Unable to hold back any longer, Severus shouted at his opponent's' face, "You can't just shove a random potion down a hapless squib's throat, Draca! We haven't even yet determined what side-effects it might have!"
"That's a good idea." For now, he wanted his mother's journals close.
"You have felt like this before?" Pince scolded.
Drooping his head, because he had learned that Daphne was the kind of witch that always got her way, the Auror took a steeling breath before suggesting, "Do you want to come in?"
" he emphasized, "because her husband has been exceedingly helpful, and I expect nothing less from her. But one toe out of line, Mr Potter and your butt is toast! Understood?"
The sun was sinking, painting the vast, green hills a beautiful golden colour. Trading a determined look, Neville and Harry steeled themselves for the upcoming confrontation, though the image before them had their hearts sinking. It seemed that every witch and wizard associated with the Children of Hecate had joined this 'secret' ritual. The space between and around the monoliths of Stonehenge was filled with witches and wizards of all ages and sizes. Such a vast number would increase the strength considerably. Neville and Alexander Pince had convinced Head Auror Robarts to have every available Auror on stand-by, but now when the Cultists hae all gathered together, it was obviously carce: the Aurors were outnumbered five to one, three to one with reinforcements. Still, these were civilians for the most part. So …
proves that he will be a boy."
"Ruby, are you blind?"
After she was finished, he even got up and fetched tea for them. Decaffeinated for Hermione, of course.
"Who …?" He forced out through the wool that seemed to fill his mouth.
As you can understand there is a good chance that I won't be able to edit during the time of recovery. I'll certainly try my best, but my main focus will be elsewhere and I don't want to write this story with half a heart. Sententia deserves better than that.
'I'll try to come back tomorrow, and you can help me plan the lab.' Had he somehow been involved in the planning process? But that did not make any sense, as he had been in a coma. Someone had been concerned about poisons and love potions. The question was: who?
"We will get back to you, in case more questions come up."
Rubbing his hands before tousling up his hair, Harry had sighed, "They are sorry to have scared you."
The same evening, Harry took the opportunity to write to Headmistress McGonagall. There were Potion Masters in Britain, of course, there were. One of them was even working for the Ministry. But somehow, Harry doubted that it would be a smart idea to trust any of them with this secret. Draco, however … if he had Snape's journals, might be able to learn. And if − by any chance − he became good enough, there was the tiniest chance that he could find the potion they needed.
Surprised at the undoubtedly effective, but overly simple punishment, the raven-haired inquired, "And where is she now?"
They had waited for him by the door, the moment the sun had touched the horizon. And once the door had fallen shut, his two best friends in the world had taken his hands, and they had apparated to Godric's Hollow. The trio had not even let go upon their arrival, and Harry had been clinging to them pathetically. He had conquered the darkest wizard of all time. Why was this so hard; never getting any easier over the years?
Emilia brought them up to speed during breakfast, about what to expect from a former coma-patient. It seemed that their problems were all but beginning, with Snape opening his eyes. For now, he needed to be brought up to speed on what he had missed. Yet, at the same time, the medi-witch cautioned them against overwhelming him. Small and most of all selective doses of reality were to be laid out in front of him. Nothing too exciting. Nothing that would elicit too strong of a reaction.
it, but it certainly would help. The Auror Department is notoriously difficult when one tries to access files without offering a case-number."
Straightening her skirt, Narcissa admitted, "That might be the reason your father preferred the property in Godric's Hollow. He warded it from Merlin to Morgana and back again. Just to keep his family safe."
"Because the previous one was a jerk?" Harry half asked, half told, as if really not understanding why anybody would want to keep Auror Jenkins in charge of one's provisions, especially in his exhausted state. When he noticed the worry in the older wizard's eyes, he briefly touched his shoulder and nudged him towards the fireplace. "Don't worry, Lucius, everything is fine. Narcissa will explain. I'm just beat. But trust me, this is a good thing."
'Toujours pur' … 'Always pure' … What a stupid idea.
Looking up, offering a smile that was more a grimace, the 'chosen one' continued. "Voldemort didn't lie, you know; when he boasted about killing me the day of The Battle. He cast a killing curse that night in the forest, but I chose to come back, to fight and to save as many as I could." Tears gathered in Harry's eyes when they met George's. "And I am so sorry, so sorry that I could not save Fred. You have to believe me!"
After a few moments, Harry nodded decisively. "Yes, we would have done everything for our kid. But I still love her."
"No."
"Yes, Sir," the house−elf bowed subserviently.
Neville and Harry, however, did not have the same problem. Looking around … really looking instead of merely passing glances, they choked. "Excalibur …"
Harry glanced at his former professor, but the wizard merely shrugged. "Magic is all about intent. I highly doubt that you would want any harm to come to your parent's portrait. You merely want to include them in your home."
Rolling his eyes, clutching the jewellery so he would not lose it during the insane cart-ride to the surface, the young wizard merely replied, "You are far too bloodthirsty, Griphook. But if you absolutely need to know, I plan to enchant it with parsel-wards."
"What basic wards? There were probably dozens of people, who have cast wards for this house, included but not limited to Dumbledore, Severus, Hermione and me."
The young wizard could not help the glow on his cheeks and the tears in his eyes when his family smiled at him. However, he was surprised, when - instead of inviting him into the circle, the elderly wizard addressed the blond by his side. "Draco, where Harry's life was marked by difficult choices, sometimes it must have seemed that you were given none. Trapped by your upbringing and your father's … associates, you were forced onto a path of destruction that nearly destroyed you and your family. Yet, as I said before, it takes a lot to question the convictions and beliefs we were raised with, and in the end, you made the right decisions. Not easy ones mind you, but decisions, I am convinced will lead you and yours into a better future. So please, allow me to invite you to stand by Harry's side today and join our celebration."
Mute, the platinum-haired shook his head. No, he had never asked, since he had been all but convinced that he would not be able to live with the answer. Finding Potter in Draco's bed, his son defending the man's right to be there, had been his worst nightmare. Or so he had thought at the time. The truth was, he wished to know as little as possible about the 'deal' his only child had struck. The reality of the young wizards' interactions painted a gruesome enough picture as it was. His wife, however, was determined not to allow him the luxury of ignorance any longer.
"You could never have predicted him going after a half-blood over a pureblood. Not with the way he told us how insignificant half-bloods or muggleborn were." Lucius attempted to offer comfort.
Barely able to suppress a smile, Robarts tilted his head. "It is. I will make sure our files are updated. Get better soon, Harry." After a brief check of his injury-prone Auror's chart, and a wink to Harry, he left the room.
"Of course, Sir," the young wizard pacified, knowing perfectly well the torch the Head Auror carried for Vermilia Hoggins, the archivist of the Ministry.
Aware that his residence still was not public knowledge – and thank god for that – Harry wondered how his mean-spirited colleague would solve that particular problem. But after his petty cruelty against Draco and Narcissa, he had no intentions of making things easy.
"No …" Kreacher looked up hesitant.
"Who would need 22 pairs of cufflinks?" Ron had wondered. "Imagine going on so many balls and meetings to use them all."
"You give her a name of course." The pureblood explained easily.
Reluctantly, the blond rose and dragged himself up the stairs. By the time Draco reached Harry's room, he could hear the other already in the shower. Since he was still wearing his pyjamas, he crawled into bed, defeated. He was not a child who could only sleep in his parent's bed when anxious! However, his breath had evened out before Harry even returned from the bathroom.
"Of course not," Lucius confirmed, and Narcissa elaborated. "I'm afraid we will prove ourselves poor hosts, since we can't offer refreshments beyond water. Still, rest assured that no harm will come to you here."
A slow smile of understanding lit up Hermione's face when she picked up the train of thought. "So, if we manage to convince the parents, the Ministry won't even get involved, except if we request public funding."
"Belladonna," Draco admitted after a few moments. "Lemon balm and … and Skullcap," he added quietly.
Severus was just about to reply when a small hand forced him to turn, and he received a slap that made his ears ring. Apparently, Narcissa had gotten over her shock. Blazing blue eyes stared into his, as she demanded, "Severus Tobias Snape, you will explain yourself this instant!"
"Trust me," the young witch smiled, prompting her best friend to straighten again.
"How can he?" Lucius wanted to know. "I'm a convicted Death Eater. I supported the Dark Lord for years. That I had a change of heart when I realised You−know−who's plans would get my family killed his hardly relevant."
Fortunately, there was a knock on the door, a minute later. Narcissa was just emerging from the kitchen when Auror Jenkins entered the Manor. Used to the thinly veiled insults the man liked to throw at her and her son during his monthly visits, she steeled herself before approaching him. However, Harry cut in before she could even offer a greeting.
After having finished her first cup of tea, the witch wanted to know, "Alright, Harry, what was it you wanted to talk about?"
"Yea, …" Draco mumbled, snuggling into the armchair. After the evening he has had, he had no intentions of sleeping alone.
--O-O--
Lucius was trembling ever so slightly when he got up from the floor. "Hermione … Mrs Granger … I would never!" He implored, but she brushed away his half-finished apology. "I know, Lucius, I trust you. But we have to get to the bottom of this. This was no attempt on your life, otherwise your …" She gestured vaguely towards his cane, who had protected them before but now lay dormant. "There is something going on, and we have to get to the bottom of it." Turning towards the Auror, she requested, "Auror Goldsmith, could I bother you to join me, my assistant and my brother-in-law for a brief chat in one of your interrogation rooms?"
Realising that nothing he could say would be of any comfort, simply because Draco did not want to be comforted but sulk, Harry suggested, "Why don't you sketch up the basic construction you have in mind. Tomorrow, after you have tended to Inari, we will go to the hardware store and buy the necessary supplies. Also, some varnish, so it won't rain through it."
"No, Master. Kreacher does not
While their team-leader and analyst discussed the problem, Neville and Harry stepped forward. Studying his friend, Harry pondered, "You don't believe that the concealment can be broken. You're thinking Hogwarts."
"Two children," the young Lady injected, "Draco and I need to produce two heirs. After that, we are free to … be ourselves."
−−O−O−−
Chuckling, Neville stole the last muffin, before he reminded his friend, "What about Yule and Samhain? The circle of life, of power, accompanies us all through the year. We share these celebrations with an open heart, and our magic connects us. Not only hour home but to those around us and the earth, water, air and spirits. These days are not meant exclusively for the deity they are connected to. They are free for every witch and wizard to enjoy."
"I'll never be as good as him …"
A thousand emotions ran over Draco's face too fast for Lucius to identify. The last that would not be suppressed was a desperate relief. His boy fought for composure like Lucius would have expected of him once upon a time. But today, Draco's pain and joy could not be contained. Everything broke out of him when he sobbed a single word. "Father!"
"So, we have a little breathing room."
Flinching like Malfoy had just slapped him, when calling him ‘my Lord’, Harry reared back on the couch, until his brain caught up with this surreal situation. The blond, however, seemed to take the prolonged silence as rejection and sagged on his knees. The arms wrapped around his middle were barely enough to contain his trembling. When Harry touched his shoulder, he flinched until the raven’s words registered.
Once the second-eldest Weasley was gone, Harry's undivided attention returned to his vassal, who apprehensively straightened his shoulders do face his liege's wrath. Icily, the raven-haired demanded, "You were saying, Lucius?"
"We're there, whenever you need us, Harry. You know that. All you have to do is ask," Hermione assured him before flinching slightly, rubbing her belly. "Ouch. Easy, little fellow."
--O-O--
Once the door had fallen shut, Hermione turned towards Harry and … suggested, "There is no reason for you and your thrall to stay. Maybe you want to take Ron and George to the Leaky Cauldron? We can meet there later on. And tell George that his tabs are on me tonight."
Sputtering, Lucius demanded to know, “How can you be so casual about this? You’ve never shown any interest in … men, and now …”
Dinner that evening had Harry and Draco in high spirits. And though Snape insisted on eating alone … or more, alone, with but Emilia since he had not yet the fine motor control to care for his own meals, the raven-haired had insisted that Kreacher made his favourite. When inspecting the dinner preparations, he had not been able to keep in his amusement to himself. "Seriously? Snape's favourite is Sunday Roast with Yorkshire Pudding?"
--O-O--
When the Lady did not acknowledge his words, the young man started to shift nervously. "Mrs Malfoy, I …"
Grinding his teeth, the young man pocketed his wand again, still glaring at his team-leader.
After watching the little elf sneak out the door, Severus noticed that the young wizard had claimed a spot on his mattress. Having apparently seen his attempts to reach out, Harry tentatively reached for Severus' hand. After a heartbeat, where he seemed indecisive if he was allowed the contact, he mumbled embarrassed, "Or, maybe I should not sit here. I can take the armchair!" Hesitant, he pulled back.
Subsequently, Emilia shook her head. "So, it can't be the reason for his attack. There is no magic to it." With a sigh, she gestured for the door. "Leave."
Rubbing his neck to get rid of the lingering tension, Harry admitted, "She's a woman on a mission. I doubt that she will join us before nightfall."
Shaking his head, Harry replied quietly. "That's not what I was about to say."
Scandalised, James shook his head, "No, don't worry. We would never do that to ourselves. You're Frank and Alice's boy, Neville, right?"
(See the end of the chapter for

Somehow Harry could already see the headlines:
coffee, he picked up the tray and gestured for his best friends to precede him. Inari bounded up the stairs ahead of them.
"My Lord."
"Lily," he choked, finally approaching the picture, reaching out but not touching because … because it somehow felt inappropriate with James Potter there.
"Lady Malfoy, Mr Malfoy, Draco," demonstrating impeccable manners, Daphne entered the house, offering a courtesy worthy of her pureblood upbringing, before unceremoniously pushing a huge canister of milk at Harry. "I expect a cup with one spoon of sugar and two ounces of milk at nine, eleven and three o'clock."
Speeding up their steps, the Ron, Hermione, Harry and Draco burst into the kitchen, only to step back out and in again, making sure they had not entered an alternate reality.
"Ahead of you telling us why you need our help?" Ginny clarified.
"Yep," the pixie-haired Cynthia Belfast, the Curator of the British Museum, grinned, hopping up on the research table, swinging her legs. "This is considerably more interesting, and certainly more rewarding than convincing stuffy curators to lend you their stuff, only to show it to pawing people who can't distinguish between a Mesopotamian dagger and a roman short sword."
"The chicken in wine sauce, with the little potatoes you like is overcooking."
Eyes snapping up, the former Lord had expected to see her apologetic for her lack of attention. Instead, his wife's eyes burned with irritation. "Lucius Abraxas Malfoy, I swear to you, by Merlin and Morgana, if you do not sit down this instant, I will tie you up and leave you, until Harry is expecting us. Even if I have to use my drawstrings!"
Directing his assistant where to set up shop, Nott replied absent-minded, "Of course you do."
"Did you brew another potion that was meant to weaken or kill him?"
"So, you approve of my chosen punishment?"
Uncomfortable to be praised for achievements he had considered bare necessities, Snape mumbled, "I am a wizard. Doing magic is hardly a feat."
"Kreacher! Emerald!"
"Whenever he meets her. He is completely besotted with the girl."
"What? Why? No!" The young wizard protested.
At that, Harry went very still. "Draco, I think you should discuss these plans with your mother."
" … better safe than sorry." The young wizard finished. "Trouble usually finds me and - by proxy - those closest to me. Lucius has his cane. Draco does not go out alone and Narcissa … I would never forgive myself if she were not sufficiently protected."
The next day started nearly as unpleasant for Draco as the last one had ended. In the middle of breakfast, the Lady Blackwood entered, and Draco received a slash over his face because he had not risen fast enough to greet her. Well, to be completely honest, Draco had not planned to rise at all, determined to ignore his captor as long as possible. His bleeding cheek, however, now made that impossible. And while he pressed the napkin to his skin, glaring at her defiantly, she watched with barely concealed amusement. Very much like a dog-owner would look at his pup who was not house-broken yet.
Wordlessly, the two youngest Aurors communicated before Neville turned towards their colleagues. Yet, before he could give any kind of explanation, Snape pulled back the invisibility cloak and cautioned, "Two out of three, Mr Longbottom. Not here."
"Hardly," the blond sneered. As if
The pureblood was surprised when Potter's chuckle pulled him out of his thoughts. Still, he enjoyed the open smile the young man displayed after this sombre conversation. "I'll be grateful for all the help and knowledge you can give me. But, Lucius, I see the way you act around your family. The length you are willing to go to protect your son. That is all the proof I need. Above all else, be a loving husband and a caring father. That is enough confirmation for me to know that I have made the right decision."
"You are a smart girl, Rose," Hermione assured her daughter, rubbing her tiny hands. "You know that you must never do something like this outside of our home."
"Anyway, I'll try to sort this out, Neville. Roberts gave me the next week off, but I'll floo you, alright?"
Once the little boy was gone, she stepped in front of the fireplace. "This is Andromeda Tonks, how can I help you?"
After a moment of contemplation, Harry whispered. "Severus is … was … a Slytherin."
"Yes, when I force you."
Confused, Narcissa reached for the bigger, softer package and could hear her sister chuckle, when Andromeda ripped her own open. The moment she mirrored the gesture, a gorgeous off-white cashmere-jumper fell into her hands.
Gesturing towards the bowl, the horseman replied, "I came to return something to its rightful owner."
"You know, inject something like a pain reliever."
Harry was another matter entirely. However, he trusted his partner and allowed Draco to direct his every move, so they were able to follow the dance with minimal problems. Partners were switched several times, but of all the 'male' dancers, only Lucius was able to lead the young muggle-raised wizard as easily as his son. The traditional circle ended with the men kissing the 'women's'' fingers, and though Harry tried valiantly to suppress it, Ginny could spot the faint blush that coloured his cheeks, when Draco's lips actually brushed over the back of his hand. Passing George, on their way off the dance-floor, she high-fived her brother.
"You mean purebloods make a habit of cheating?"
Griphook, however, seemed to take offence at that comment. "You blackmailed me into taking over both of your accounts. What did you expect, me doing a poor job? Ha! Foolish wizards! I reorganised your entire portfolio. The Black accounts have gained 0,73% interest per year, and the Potters close to 1,75% since their rules of investments are far less strict."
To Draco's surprise, they entered the living−room. The floor was covered in cushions and blankets already. Apparently, the two women had moved to the rug in front of the fireplace at one point during the night and had built a nest for themselves. Smiling softly, Harry whispered, "Open the window a little. I'll get the fire started."
"Pince!" Harry replied equally exasperated. "Why don't you let me ask them, before you dismiss the idea outright?"
Laughing out loud, his little sister promised, "Oh, I will get you for that, do not doubt me, but no, this is not revenge. It is cheap because Harry went out of his way to contact a few acquaintances he made during his time in India. Several of them agreed to host you. The portkey will activate at 1 p.m. on the 31
When Harry dragged himself into the kitchen seven hours later, he heard from Kreacher that 'Master Draco' had not left the library today, but that he had consumed the lunch the elf had served. Kreacher had also served a meal to the Medi−witch, Harry had called on short notice. Despite the surveillance charms he had woven over his live−in−patient, he never felt particularly comfortable leaving him alone for an extended amount of time. Him being out in the field would have meant exactly that, and Harry was grateful that the woman was always available when he needed her.
Looking at the man, the Auror summed up after a few minutes of contemplation. “So, you tell me, after you violated the confidentiality of my work that you want to talk to the captive my partner and I detained a week ago. Alone, mind you, and that I should simply trust your word if I ought to charge him or let him go.”
"Yes," Kreacher decided sternly, setting her on the floor with care. "Emerald is to dismantle all the towers!" They were running out of cutlery again.
Laughing at the irritated look of his younger colleague, Spinnet revealed, "Alicia's my daughter."
day. Since Lucius is the head of his family, I believe that the help of his wife and son are implied in his pledge. Have a good day, Auror Jenkins, and thank you for your cooperation.”
--O-O--
They all sat together for breakfast the next morning and once Harry had sufficiently woken after a cup of coffee and porridge with fresh blackberries, Narcissa had placed before him, he pondered, "We'll start removing the dark artefacts today. Considering your families background, I doubt Tom's diary was the only one."
A part of the former Death Eater was reluctant to believe that his master would let him off the hook that easy. But since he had no way of predicting Potter’s actions, he complied. “As a future Lord, I have been trained from a very young age to be familiar with our laws. My father was steadfast in his belief that the leader of a family knows the base of our justice system, down to the last paragraph. That, combined with my personal experience in You-Know… Voldemort’s service grants me a unique insight into a dark wizard’s mind. If there is anything to this man’s claims of having been forced by a curse or potion, I might be able to find it. If not, I have the knowledge to help you build a case against him, so he will never set foot on the shores of Britain again.”
"I don't doubt her sincerity, it's just … she did not conceive for Rosier, so … ," sighing, the raven-haired scratched the back of his neck. "Maybe you should talk to Narcissa. She ran the diagnostic after all."
The presumed leader of the cult began wielding big words about the superiority of wizards and witches. How all magical beings were the next evolutionary step and how sacrificing one non-believer would show their goddess their determination to rid the British Isles of all vermin. Their curse would weaken and ultimately destroy all muggles, and Great Britain would be a paradise for all magical beeings. And so on and so forth. Had Harry not needed his entire concentration to cast a protective dome, he would have rolled his eyes. Still, he could not allow himself to become side-tracked. The last rays of sunlight were dying, indicating that the time of the sacrifice had nearly come.
"… ended the spell after I analysed it. It seemed to hurt Mr Malfoy the longer it was active. So, there won't be a lot to see, I'm afraid. Maybe a Prior Incantatem for Hermione's wand?" George shared.
"The survival of wizard-kind?" Harry pondered. At the doubtful looks of his colleagues, he groaned and lifted his fringe. "Come on, whenever I am involved, when is it ever anything less? A Dark Lord or the survival of our race. The fates hate me!" Despite the disbelieving stares of the other two Aurors, his partner shrugged.
patient?" The medi-witch, who had been responsible for Severus Snape's care for the last four years, asked from behind.
--O-O--
Yet a muffled voice from the fireplace egged him on. "This is the only way, and you know it! Harry is too stubborn for his own good and this way we can 'persuade' him to come around. Just bring the files, and I will take care to make the most out of them."
"No use in berating her. That was hours ago, and I already punished her for it."
When the parchment with the result of his diagnostics was handed over, Draco got very still since the person handing it over was Kingsley Shacklebolt, the Minister of Magic. In a childish attempt to hide, the delinquent pushed his wand up his sleeve, but of course none of them was under any illusion of the former Auror not having seen him use it.
Once the couple had left, Draco returned to the terrace to wheel Harry back inside. After dinner, they shared a quiet cup of tea in the living-room. Having pondered the conversation with William Weasley sufficiently, the blond remarked, "It seems that the Weasleys have adopted you into their family."
Taking the steps two at a time, the young Auror burst into his patient's room after but a perfunctory knock. "Is there a problem, Sir?" He was surprised to find Snape sitting upright, glaring at him as murderously as he had during first year.
"Are we doing a buffet?" Hermione asked eagerly, "I mean the cheese fondue last year was really fun, but the next day I found breadcrumbs and cheese strings in places they certainly don't belong."
−−O−O−−
Having taken the position of chief editor right out of school, Luna Lovegood had managed to triple the sales volume of the Quibbler within the first year. Harry had helped, by providing exclusive interviews every few weeks. The wizarding world felt like they had the right to know about every last detail of their saviour's life. So, instead of fending off reporters left and right, he and Luna had a business lunch every three to four Wednesdays where he told her about whatever he felt comfortable sharing with the world. With her, he could at least be sure that his words weren't twisted in his mouth and after the first six months, he had stopped reading the drafts she sent him. He trusted Luna with his public image and so far she had not disappointed him. He had even managed to get an invite for her to several social functions after she had accompanied him as his 'plus one' and written glorifying reviews of one party or the other.
George had offered Ron Fred’s part of the company within a year of him working there. But with the money he had received for his Order of Merlin – Second Class, the youngest male Weasley had bought a roomy house for Hermione and himself and was content with that. He accepted payment suitable for his efforts, even compensation for added hours or when he had to come in on weekends, but nothing beyond that.
– why you think it’s a good idea to put two Death Eaters into the same room. We want Lostrife locked up, not help him to forge escape plans with one of his former … business associates.” He spat out the last word, making it very clear what he thought of the pureblood at the back.
"Hey, come here," Harry whispered, gently pulling Draco close by his shoulder until the blond was fused to his side. "You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to. It's okay." A comforting hand ran over the blond's back, and he could give in to the illusion of this just being a bad dream Harry had pulled him out of. But it wasn't.
Folding his arms before his chest, Severus sneered, "To what moment are you referring to? The minute my godson stumbled into my room in the afternoon, distraught because he was convinced that he had angered you by allowing Astoria to invite herself to Grimmauld Place? Or maybe the hour he came for dinner, sharing that you still had not returned from wherever you had gone. Of course, you could also refer to the moment when Kreacher was forced to wake me from a rather amicable dream, since Ron and Hermione were waiting in the floo, because you had been in the air for hours and they needed to go to bed, since it's a Sunday, but didn't feel comfortable to leave you on your own."
Studying him, the witch frowned, "Are you alright, Harry?"
Nodding embarrassed, Harry brushed over his face. He was an Auror for heaven's sake, he should not be losing his composure that easily. Avoiding her eyes, he mumbled, "I'm sorry." What a brilliant impression. The man who was responsible for her family's well−being bawling his eyes out within an hour of meeting her.
Offering an absent-minded smile, Luna vanished.
Thank you all for reading and commenting but most importantly for sharing my joy in a piece of fanfic I really have fun working on.
The others had been caught up in recalling the many differences between the twins, reminding themselves that Fred and George had very much been their own person, despite their appearance and general interests. The surviving twin had stepped up to their mother, who had caressed his brother's sock. "Mum, I …"
Growing very still, Mdm Pince folded her arms as if she was trying to hug herself. "Once," she admitted. "But he only said that it was vital for the survival of our race. I never asked again." After a heartbeat, she looked up. "Will that be all, Auror Potter?"
"Fuck," Harry mumbled exhausted, sinking down on the sofa, closing his eyes.
"Harry," Hermione interrupted their squabble. "You're stalling."
"And so Death took the second brother for his own," the redhead finished for him. "You know the entire tale by heart, don't you?"
Smiling at his friend, because - as always - Neville knew what to say, Harry drained his cup. He winched when he scalded his tongue but readily took the suggestion. "Let's do that. Maybe we have been looking at this from the wrong angle, anyway. While it's important to find their suppliers, let's start at the beginning: Where in Albion do Unicorns live?"
Now it was Harry's turn to roll his eyes. Some things never changed, and Percy trying to educate people was one of these things. He would be a good head for a potential educational department that dealt with pre-school and any other form of learning ahead of Hogwarts. "Fine! Are they still at it, or can I take Snape to Gringotts?"
Rising from his armchair, the pureblood shook his head. He turned to look out of the window into the well-lit street. "It does not matter anyway," he admitted quietly after a few minutes. "It is not as if the Malfoy name has any chance of surviving this. We made a mistake, and our house will fall for it."
"Are you planning a party?"
Opening and closing his mouth, his superior watched his fish impression for a heartbeat, before gesturing, "Take him away, Longbottom."
Harry sighed because the blond's bad conscience was palpable and after what had happened in the morning, he knew he ought to take his time for this. So, the Auror stepped back and leaned against the desk, folding his arms so he would not be tempted to pet Draco again. He was relieved to notice the blond relaxing at the gesture. "Listen, I get this whole 'servant'−position you put yourself in. It's infinitely better than being locked up at the Manor, starving. But let's be honest, you merely had a choice between a rock and a hard place."
"Excuse me?" How had their topic turned around towards his liege all of a sudden? But then the former Lord went over what had just been said and had sunken back in his chair.
"I know, Hermione. And I don't want, in any way, to degrade your parents. They are amazing, kind, compassionate and highly intelligent people. But not even you can deny that, with but your wand, you are more powerful than them. You have survived things they never would, simply because you have magic."
--O-O--
Biting his tongue for a moment, Draco debated with himself, if it would be smart to make a request. In the end, his craving won out. "Would pancakes be too much of an effort?"
After a few moments of quiet contemplation, the blond burst out, "But she slept in your bed!"
"He does look a little … disconcerting. Are we sure he should be up already?"
"What flower?"
About ninety minutes later, Ron and Hermione were sitting outside of the vault. The redhead's feet were dangling over the edge of the cliff that seemed to surround all the great vaults, while Hermione lay curled up by his side, her head in his lap. Wards were securing them, though neither had any inclination of rolling off the edge. "Do you think Rose will be fine?"
"Teddy, …" the raven-haired started again, but Draco cut him off. "Edward, please, give us a minute. It seems that I really need to talk to your godfather."
"The Malfoys followed You-know-who!" Ron growled. "Voldemort! You know what I mean!" He corrected himself impatiently when his friend scowled.
He and Severus now stood perpendicular to the windows, both partially illuminated by the moonlight. Contrary to Harry's expectations, the older wizard's face was not cold or condescending, as he had gotten used to at Hogwarts, but warm and full of care. "I know that you value Draco. That you would never hurt him intentionally. But words spoken in anger or confusion can have the same effect as intentional cruelty. I need you to think before opening your mouth again. You will regret it otherwise."
"Well, after all the stunts Lucius' Junior has pulled at school, let us hope that he has some redeeming qualities."
The next morning, Harry found the papers in his office in disarray but thought none of it since he had never banned Kreacher from cleaning this room.
Relieved, the young man's shoulders sagged, and he inquired. "How do you feel?"
Lowering his eyes, ashamed once again, Draco mumbled, "It was the only thing I had left."
Furious, Harry hissed, "How can you justify his betrayal? He as good as killed you and mum!"
--O-O--
Comforting the little elf, Draco shook his head. "It's alright. Cupcakes are perfectly fine."
Sorry for the delay, but my husband and son attended a triathlon yesterday and we were out all day. It was an enjoyable day in the sun and both men did very good :).
Cursing, Harry hit his pillow to make it firmer, more supportive of his neck, but he gave up after ten more useless minutes of staring at the ceiling. Though he was mentally exhausted, he felt too wired to get any sleep. So, he gave in to the inevitable and rose. Slipping on his dressing gown, Harry gazed briefly at Snape's … Severus' door, before turning towards the stairs. He flinched when said door creaked open and the older wizard commanded, "Enter, Mr. ... Harry."
"Professor Snape, not dead I see."
Irma Pince stepping up to them, interrupted the question, "I do, but …"
"We don't either," Pince admitted with a shrug. "But we consider it better to be safe than sorry. And the Lady
"Narcissa! NO!" Harry shouted, but before he could intervene, the witch had closed her hand around the wand that had hurt her before. The smell of burning flesh filled the vault, sickening in its sweetness. But Narcissa was not letting go. Calmly, she watched the faint smoke that curled up from her hand, as if the appendix was not even her own. Still, her voice shook when she demanded, "You might as well give in now because I have no intention of
Maybe he should not have said anything? Should not have drawn attention towards the heinous crimes he had committed. Would Potter send him away now? He would be entirely justified to banish him, because, as things were, his life would only get worse with Lucius in it. After a few minutes, the raven−haired returned to his chair and rested his elbows on his knees. When he looked up, Lucius reclaimed his seat as well.
Colour draining off his own face, Harry looked down, "Kreacher, where are my Malfoys?"
Eyeing the files from work, the young man pushed them to the side and decided to find Narcissa, to discover the progress she had made.
"Anyway," Harry tried to stir the conversation back into the original direction. "Drake's a Rune-Master. He
Banishing the half-full cup, the little elf climbed down from the bed, right into the other's arms. Quietly she whispered, "Emerald is being punished?"
Harry returned their cups and plates to the kitchen, while Draco packed away their first-aid kit. He could not suppress a vicious smile when noticing that the bottle with the light-grey stopper had taken the white's place.
Indicating an upcoming headache, the Lady started to massage her temples. "Please, gentlemen, you are, of course, free to check my entire house. I would never dare to stand in the way of a Ministry investigation. But please, make him stop shouting."
Closing his eyes, enjoying the hot water, the Potion Master merely replied, "I imagine."
Puzzled, Harry shook his head. “Of course, I am. I’m Sirius Black’s godson. He even had a will deposited at Gringotts declaring me the sole heir of his assets. You know that the goblins would have never released his vault were there the slightest doubt about my claim.”
Draco gave Teddy a look that clearly said 'Told you so.' and received a small smile in return. "Who handled her case?"
Messing up his already tousled hair, the young man nodded. "A body can sustain only so much injury before it does not accept magical healing any longer. I know the Greengrasses are an old family, but Astoria won't be able to suffer such damage regularly without any lingering after-effects."
Nodding tiredly, Harry recited. "Meanwhile, the second brother journeyed to his own home, where he lived alone. Here he took out the stone that had the power to recall the dead and turned it thrice in his hand. To his amazement and his delight, the figure of the girl he had once hoped to marry before her untimely death, appeared at once before him. Yet she was sad and cold, separated from him as by a veil. Though she had returned to the mortal world, she did not truly belong there and suffered. Finally, the second brother, driven mad with hopeless longing, killed himself so as to truly join her."
the second librarian of the British Library; an institution that did not even have a magical section, as far as the Ministry was aware.
"It did," Draco admitted, "at the beginning. Then the rite came in. It made the wife receptive to her new husband's needs and moods. Since most people don't like feeling uncomfortable all the time, the couples had to make a conscious effort to make each other happy. Well, not really happy, but at least content."
"Exactly."
Ron looked over his shoulder, where he could see his best friend talking animatedly. "He can see us if he turns. Though, I just don't see him doing that any time soon."
"Come on, Neville. Let's get you a biscuit."
Once the elf was gone, the raven-haired made an inviting gesture, "After you, Inquisitor Greengrass."
After a wordless nod from Irma, Christopher looked at his colleague for a moment, obviously contemplating his words, he still then confirmed, "Yes, the four of you and Lady Malfoy. That should do." Rising, he added, "But now let's call it a night. We'll see each other tomorrow at lunchtime. Don't worry, cast a Disillusionment Charm on yourself, before walking through the barrier. The muggles won't notice a thing, and I have the security cameras covered."
Confused, Harry wanted to know, "If you're not expecting help … why pray at all?"
"Neville!" Harry breathed out in horror. "I could never hate your parents. The first time I came across them, I did not know how to react. I was a child! But I swear to you, I did not know. Had I known, I would have accompanied you to every visit, just to get to know them. Really! I did not know before mum told me."
"A few times, a shield flared up to protect my right. I assume, whosever wand he was carrying, worked for him."
The crowd around the bonfire was nothing the golden trio had ever seen. Thestrals nibbled on snacks, confusing some of the younger children who could not see them. A few pixies and fairies were taunting students with glamour and some weak form of allure until the professors put an end to it. A giant spider, that hovered just at the edge of the forest, scared most of the first and second-years back to their dormitories and around midnight, when the festivity started to wind down, a herd of unicorns emerged from the forest, sampling the remaining treats. They even allowed a selected few to pet them. A young one approached Hermione and nibbled on her cloak. Rubbing its mane over her stomach until it lost a few strands of hair before returning to its herd.
Wearing unusual threadbare trousers and boots, the Malfoy family was ready for departure. Having chosen jeans and Weasley sweaters for himself and Teddy, Harry pondered that nobody would consider his companions purebloods at first glance, though Narcissa's demeanour gave her noble heritage away. Despite the clothes, she still carried herself like a true Lady, so the raven−haired could not help but think it appropriate, when Neville bowed before her, offering his arm for the apparition. To Draco, he merely held out his hand. That left Harry with Teddy and Lucius and a somewhat embarrassing request, "Could you please hug Teddy and me?"
Smiling, Hermione gestured for him to help her to her feet and approached their new bed while pulling the slide out of her bun. "Well, in any case, let's make sure that you get the chance to spoil your future heir as you did your son."
"Andromeda, I …" But she interrupted him with but a simple gesture. "I want to be alone with my sister. Maybe you should introduce Teddy to his uncle Draco."
Taking a deep breath, Ron cut off his brother's rambling in a hoarse voice, "It's alright, Bill, thanks."
Draco had been on edge ever since his father had left. His mother had tried to ease his anxiety, but the commotion in the office and Lucius' untimely departure had indicated some kind of conflict between vassal and liege. After dinner had been well on its way, his mother had taken two half-finished portions and had taken her leave as well. Since Ginny Weasley was content to hustle and bustle around the kitchen, Draco had chosen a chair in the office to make himself available for Harry. Maybe Potter would not begrudge his father's mistake if the rest of the family showed themselves suitable subservient.
“Yes, Sir,” the raven confirmed when ushering Lucius out of the office.
," she emphasised, "is the only light-blue Aubusson carpet in the entire Manor. So, until our assets have been released and you can replace it, you will desist from ruining my fixtures, with your useless pacing!"
The wizard, however, merely shrugged, "There were the usual questions: where, when, who, and how? Nothing overly original. They thought me privy to information from the Auror Squad that investigates them.  Also, there seemed to be a witch, who has been admitted to St. Mungo. They wanted to know where she was picked up. They did not like my answers, and made their displeasure known."
--O-O--
"Of course," the young man nodded empathically. "With nobody hating them, witches like Hermione will have a real chance without fighting tooth and nail for it."
"But, Harry," Teddy protested weakly, slowly turning around, he added hesitantly. "The pretty flower …"
"As soon as he returned from the Manor. I might not be up to date on current … developments, but all this feels a little farfetched." The Potion Master confirmed.
Sighing, because this was most certainly not the ideal surroundings for such a deep conversation, especially not when working, Robarts led them to a small alcove. After casting some heavy privacy wards, he looked at his young, idealistic Auror, who tried so very hard to make Britain a better, and a safer place. Harry Potter had carried the weight of their world on his shoulders since he had been 15 months old. And instead of telling them all to 'shove it' after defeating You-know … Voldemort, he was still exhausting himself to safe wizarding Britain from itself. The sad truth was, he was the only wizard on the planet who
--O-O--
Horrified, Harry looked at his companion. "Do you really expect me to execute that power?"
Lucius groaned blissfully when the hot water loosened muscles that had been knotted for years. Potter had ordered him to follow Neville, while he was talking to one of his colleagues. Though the former Lord was miffed to be cast aside so easily, he had to admit that the first hot shower in nearly four years was unbelievably relaxing. Of course, he hated to be made a vassal, but at least this time his Lord was sane and not hell-bent on ruling the world. Surely Potter had no intentions of harming his family. However, he had boasted about Draco pledging his life to him, and he had taken obvious delight in sharing Narcissa’s fragile state of mind.
Turning away from the window, folding his slim arms before his chest, Severus Snape shot a glare at his nurse that would have had seventh years ducking for cover. Regrettably, Emilia Nightingale was not easily intimidated … or at all, as he had learned these past few months. Hence, he made an effort to repeat as composed as possible, though her persistent denial was driving him up the wall. "I am a
Big hands massaged her back, just below her breast-bone, inexplicably making her feel better almost instantly. The wizard's voice was thick and full of regret when he whispered, "I'm sorry."
Looking at the magnificent beasts, their Goblin-professor shrugged. "Who knows? Barely anyone understands the mindset of a unicorn. You could ask Hagrid, but I guess the only thing safe to say is that your little one will need it."
Aware that there was no choice but to comply, he summed up his last few years in a dry tone to get this over with, "Nagini bit me on Voldemort's command. Harry and his friends found me. I gave our 'Saviour' one last memory before I closed my eyes. Ms Granger, thinking fast on her feet as always, put me in stasis, saving my life. The trio, together with Minerva and Poppy, put me into a prolonged magical coma, winning time to research anti-venoms to cure me upon waking."
"Maybe," Hermione pondered, heading for an empty table to finish their discussion before joining their friends again. "But Thompson decided just last week that we should start thinking about a case against these 'Children of Hecate'. Sooner or later, the Aurors will catch them, and he wants us to get a head-start. It's not a pressing matter, but Lucius is extraordinarily helpful."
"And you're not taking me seriously!
Still, the blond stayed on alert until he heard the Auror go down to the kitchen and leave for work. For another thirty minutes, Draco worked diligently before exhaustion took over. Between one heartbeat and the next, he was passed out on his desk.
I'm posting a little early this weekend, since I'm currently wrapped up in another story, that simply won't let me go. And since I didn't want to forget about you, I'm posting on Friday, so you all can enjoy Snape being his grumpy self, and me not neglecting my duties to my cherished readers :). I wish all of you a brilliant weekend.
"And had he gone after Longbottom; I would not have cared. I think that says more about my character than my willingness to die for Lily's son. I am not a good person, Lucius. Nor am I the hero Potter tried to make me. Yet he makes me wanting to be better just by being around. I am selfish enough to accept that."
"And?" The former Lord asked, confused, "Surely breaking your soul into seven parts is enough. He was as close to immortal as one could get."
Snape avoided her gaze by looking out the window. "How can you be so sure?"
In the kitchen, the other wizard traded Emerald for a pot of stew with freshly baked bread and promptly started to wolf down his portion. Inevitably, his housemate asked himself if he had seen the other at breakfast but could not recall any interaction after the first meal yesterday morning. "How is your case going?"
"No, Master," the elf replied, somewhat confused.
Then he quietly left the room, specially adapted to the needs of a man who − against all expectations − had survived Nagini's bite. But as it was so often the case, Harry was not content with the people he cared about merely surviving. He wanted the man to live again. The problem was he didn't have the slightest clue how to achieve that.
"Kreacher is a house-elf for more than a century. Kreacher knows his plants and concoctions. All good house-elves do. We prepare the food. We have to be trusted!"
"Because this is wrong. You're not my slaves!"
“Oh, and let’s not forget about interior design. Let’s talk about bare necessities! Since we don’t have any money, we can’t even buy our own food without going through the ‘proper’ channels. If our gamekeeper considers something my mother requests a luxury, he simply removes it from the provision list without providing a substitute. We needed six bloody months to compose a list that got approved more often than not, though he still rejects random requests just for shit and giggles! We tried to grow our own food, but I’m shit at Herbology and mum’s barely better.
"Most handsome!" Lucius corrected them both indignantly. "I'm not a girl!"
"Exhausting," Harry mumbled around a piece of bread before forcing it down. "Sorry," he used the napkin – Narcissa would be so proud – before replying. "Neville and I were at the office until 3 a.m. Then we took a cat-nap on our couch. After tea and a biscuit, we started revising evidence from again at 8 a.m. Had Robarts not kicked us out an hour ago, we would still be at it."
--O-O--
Her voice was quiet and full of pain, more pain than he had ever heard, she whispered, "I am so sorry, Sev. Please, forgive me."
For Draco, however, this was about more than loyalty. Harry needed a friend tonight, and he would be damned if he allowed yet another Weasley to share the raven-haired's bed. Rising he requested, "Now, Hermine, Ron, please be so kind to leave and give me a few minutes, to make sure that your friend is halfway decent for Christmas Eve."
be like this! She was her own person, with ideas and convictions, born and raised to lead rather than to follow. She had been ready to meet him head-on, should he ever try to subdue her. Not only had Lucius accepted that he had fallen in love with the fierce and spirited middle daughter of the Black family, earning her respect in return. The day of her bonding, they had sworn to fight for their love and to support and cherish each other, all days of their life.
“Wha… excuse me?”
"I need to talk to Hermione."
"So mote it be."
"Wipe that grin off your face."
"Harry?" His father interrupted his self-recrimination. "How old were you?"
Since it obviously bothered Kreacher, Harry emptied his cup, cursing himself for not remembering that it was always topped off with
Looking from her patient to his caretaker and back again, the medi-witch wanted to know, "How are you, Mr Snape?"
"Requirement of what?" Charles asked confused, but Harry and Neville merely brushed the question aside and took up positions, closing their eyes.
--O-O--
"And that was a good thing too," James chuckled, lost in memories. "Because once she handed you over to Sirius, he did not let you go for a solid six hours."
"But?"
--O-O--
"At the beginning, yes, he was. He lost himself in the anger and pain of his upbringing and gave too much power to a prophecy he might as well have ignored. I don't know when he lost his sanity, but by then, most of us had already sold our souls for the chance of a better future and had no choice but to follow a madman."
"You're welcome, Harry."
"I tried to remind uncle Sev …"
Neither of them spoke, and Harry pretended not to notice Draco's clenched hands on the edge of the tub that were slowly turning bone-white from the pressure, nor the tears that started to leak out of his eyes. Once the face was bare again, Harry whispered, "Lean back." Before he washed the product out of the blond's hair, putting a warm towel over Draco's head, he let him towel it himself and then roughly scrub his face. Once he was finished, Draco seemed unable to meet Harry's eyes. So, they merely turned off the lights, bathing the room in darkness. "Come to bed."
was the one who shared the prophecy with our Lord."
That, however, was brushed aside with unexpected nonchalance. "Of course, they did. That's more or less expected at this point." Before Hermione could rear up, Lucius held up his hand. "They have, however, nothing on the Dark Lord. When he resided at the Manor as our guest, I've suffered worse, prior and certainly after your captivity. Also, they have to keep me alive until Thursday. So try not to think about it. You said it yourself, Harry will find us. I can hold out until then."
Closing his eyes in defeat, the former Death Eater shook his head. "What if I go about this all wrong? What if my potions aren't good enough? Uncle Sev had written his life away when he was barely older than me when took the mark. You are the only one, who has ever worked to give him a fair chance. What if I can't live up to that?"
--O-O--
One blink, but no squeeze, since Severus had no strength left.
She had no idea what spell the young man had put on the ring, but the way his shoulders sagged at that affirmation, she felt a little more self-assured.
"I was wondering how long it would take you, to return to that question."
This was wrong. This was wrong on so many levels that Harry did not even know which issue to address first. Draco, however, seemed to understand what was most important. Gently caressing the boy's head, he assured him, "Edward, we are happy when you are around."
Shrugging, Harry admitted, "To be honest, I have no clue, since we do not know how much venom we can extract from one dose."
Wringing her hands, the elf approached. "Sir is upset. Mistress is a good person! If Sir obeys, he will be happy here. All the others were happy too until … they went away."
"Yes … No … Bloody hell, hold still you little devil!" Charlie Weasley sputtered, before finally losing his grip on something white and furry that shot through the garden with excited yips, right into Draco's open arms. The little fox's attack unbalanced the wizard, so he landed on his backside, laughing carefree at her antics, while she gave him a tongue-bath.
"Yes, Master?"
With a small smile, his partner tilted his head, "And we intend to find our missing librarians, safe and unharmed."
Thinking about that, Harry nodded. He did trust Draco Malfoy, despite their somewhat turbulent past. Hermione and Ron were … just them, reliable beyond the shadow of a doubt. But Draco, despite the faith Harry placed in him, would not be able to help with this new political agenda since the Saviour of Wizarding Britain had other - equally important - plans for him.
After a while, Severus demanded, "Go on."
"But they are dead."
"Fred," Harry wailed, clutching the trinket in his hand, reaching out for the ghost. But in the end, he merely mirrored Fred's former gesture before letting his hand fall.
was definitely a step in the right direction."
"Thank you … for the porridge."
"Tea?" Snape stated drily.
When Harry nodded wordlessly, Ron inquired, "Do you have any idea how?"
"Maybe you can't. I do! I studied transformative spell-design for years and wrote my Master Thesis on Analytical and Layered Magic. While we can agree that
With a smile that could do a viper justice, Daphne agreed, "Oh yes, you do." Then she looked around. "Where is the party?"
Have a great weekend.
"I, …" Draco croaked, clearing his throat embarrassed. "I am not sure. Actually, Neville Longbottom is currently tied to his chair. Still, as far as I know, he is on top of the investigation." After a moment, he added hesitant, "Sorry, that I don't know more."
Instinctively James and Lily glanced at the sleeping baby, straightening the dark blue blanket that covered him. Harry was not entirely sure how this worked, he was not dead after all. Maybe this child was but a spelled image? No real personality, just … sleeping? He watched his parents and got lost in memories he had not even known he had had. Absent-minded, he whispered to himself. "A warm, cuddly night-sky … that blanket. I remember that blanket. It was in my bed."
"It's not okay to use Legilimency on your landlord," Harry mumbled, burrowing deeper into the armchair.
"Do you have a god in mind?"
"Don't you get it, Potter?" The other wizard snapped. "We could have woken him the day after Halloween! When you brought all of his stuff."
It being really early, and Snape being exhausted at that point, had made him stumble, just three steps away from the bottom. It could have been a nasty fall, but he had had worse over the years. What he had not expected, had been the railing rearing up and a decorative snake wrapping around his lower arm.
"Wise, ch… move."
need help!"
"Oaths from muggles?"
"Hey, …" Ron had soothed him, taking the book, carefully placing it back in the bag before zipping it closed. Then he had put his big, warm hand on Harry's shoulder, squeezing the muscles there soothingly. "It's okay. You can take it with you, look at it later. In a day, a week or a year. You have nothing to proove, Harry. It's just time for you to take this step. To use your parents' and Sirius' money in equal parts to build your future. That's why we're here. We've come a pretty long way already. It's alright to leave if you want."
"Would that make you feel better?" The younger wizard inquired, summoning a new glass, helping himself to another finger of whiskey. "Is it really Molly you want to scream at?"
"But never that long," the boy mumbled. "Draco's dad's hair is the prettiestest."
"The spell from the Atrium!" Leewood interrupted him with a snap.
Chuckling wetly, Hermione shook her head, safe in the comfortable embrace of her two best friends. "Definitely not."
Obviously not finished with her interrogation, the former Black matriarch held him back one last time, "Why the wand? He is still a convicted Death Eater! A group you are fighting so valiantly against. This would reflect badly on the family if it came out."
"Then do," the Lady advised, "Guide him. Advise him. Serve as his anchor when he drifts. We might not be Aurors, but we are far from useless. And when we find them, we will stand by Harry's side and may the gods have mercy on those who took them, because we will have none."

"What do you think is Uncle Harry doing with Nana?"
So, Severus was currently watching Emerald assemble a cheese-platter, under Kreacher's watchful eyes. The elf had insisted she had to learn. Currently, she was decorating it with fruit in - of course - the shape of flowers when he heard the floo flare to life and hastened footsteps entering Harry's office.
"He's going to kill you. These are his favourite!"
Finally opening his eyes, Roberts glared at him. “Bullshit! Though you might not have realised the troubles your actions would cause, you still would have seen them through.
"Talking, I guess. It's long overdue anyway." Nicking half a treat, much to his friend's dismay, Harry clutched his heart when a voice stated from behind him, "This is tiny and won't do!"
After three successful excursions to the kitchen, Severus had finally managed to convince Emilia Nightingale to let him leave the house for the first time since waking up in this new millennium. And if a tear was rolling down his cheek when he felt the sun on his face and the wind in his hair, with no fear about tomorrow, neither of them mentioned it. From this day forth, Snape started to research herbs and earth-compositions needed for a portioner's garden. After all, he was paying rent, surely one herbal patch or the other was included in that price.
"Officially," Narcissa added quietly.
Still, Snape preceded the young man into the kitchen and ordered Emerald to make tea. Petrifying Potter in retaliation for being lied to deserved some form of reward, though he would never admit that. As Emerald served, he studied the young Auror. Longbottom did not seem to wish to make this situation easier on him, and both knew the Auror had him at a disadvantage. One word from the young pureblood and Snape's secret would be out. Still, whenever his fingers so much as twitched towards his wand, the sharp eyes of the brunet warned him not to do anything stupid. He conceded to the unspoken counsel. Still, after a few minutes, he could not keep in the question that puzzled him the most, "How on earth did you manage to pass the potion's exams necess… necessary to become an Auror?" He clenched his fists under the table, angry at still stumbling over multi-sylable words, even after weeks of diligent training. He prepared himself for being smiled at like he was a child or worse an invalid; he had slighted the wizard facing him enough times, to warrant some payback.
"Why is Ruby sobbing?" Stabilising them both, the brunet listened with rapt attention as Harry shared Kreacher's insight. "We are idiots. We have used him often enough on assignments, and now … doesn't matter. Let's get back to Grimmauld Place and talk this through."
Stirring her tea, the older witch studied the young wizard before her for several moments, before revealing, "Nobody of course. Hogwarts sealed them off after Severus … left."
Jumping to the right conclusion, the Head Auror stated, "An item you can look for, given you know the right spell."
Harry could feel Ron starting to tremble all over in their shared embrace and could only laugh out loud when his best friend squeaked, "What?"
"Out with it!" His former professor challenged harshly.
"Sure," the librarian threw a kernel into the air, capturing it with his mouth. "You three are better than any soap opera."
All hell broke loose around six when the first guests arrived. The children seemed to instantly sniff out their little friend from Yule and gathered around Draco, with palpable fascination. Inari, however, seemed unsure of what to make of all the attention. Yes, she sniffed curiously at various hands, that reached out to pet her but only allowed the contact as long as she was secure in Draco's arms. The blond seemed content with that arrangement, able to feel his new friend tense when it became too much for her. After a good half hour, he shooed the kids away, fed her a few more bites before securing Inari in the conjured cage. He and Charlie had discovered that she would go into her laundry-box willingly if it carried some of Draco's scent. So, the blond was now one shirt short but had a happy fox.
"I can't hide forever."
A week had passed since her patient's change of demeanour and nobody could deny that his physical health, as well as his mental faculties, had improved greatly. As his first task, he had been set upon learning the spell that would empty his bladder and bowels as he was determined to never embarrass himself again. He was speaking in near full sentences, albeit short ones and even managed to feed himself two times out of three. In the evening he hardly managed, since he tended to overtax himself during the day until his body was shaking from exhaustion. However, despite the medi-witch's protests, the man was too stubborn to give in. Like now, when his only reply was, "No," before he started another set of sit-ups.
Astoria shook her head and pressed her lips together, though that had to hurt her split bottom lip. She actively avoided Harry's gaze, turning her black eye and most likely broken cheek away from the young Auror.
All in all, Sandorn got away with a slap on the wrist. The former lawyer was coming out of this as a hero for fighting the dark and from his smirk after hearing the verdict, well aware of it. Additionally, the Lady Talbot and Hermione shared later on, that the real chance of Sandorn ever paying a single sickle were slim to none. While some of his victims might not have deserved their harsh sentences, them being entirely innocent was unlikely. After all, the Wizengamot had learned from the so-called 'Sirius Black'-incident.
"I think so?" the blond replied, confused. But when nothing but a "Good," was added, the young wizard fled the room.
Whipping around from comforting his friend, Draco demanded to know. "You seriously think he will kill her; his own wife?"
Smiling proudly, Hermione kissed her daughter's head and rose from her crouch. "You know what, I think that's a wonderful idea, love. But now go and get dressed so we can have breakfast."
"That is not entirely correct," the Lady Malfoy interrupted. "I am reasonably sure, that they are studying the development of magical cores."
−−O−O−−
In an unexpected display of tact, Ron changed the subject and shared his and George's latest breakthrough with the Rainbow Rolls. Mayonnaise was responsible for the people hiccupping uncontrollably. Their friends congratulated them dutifully, and their recent acquaintances wanted to know what, in the name of Merlin, Rainbow Rolls were. Ever the businessmen George and Ron offered free samples so that everybody in attendance started to shimmer through all the colours of the rainbow on their way out.
"Harriette, Arlington Wainsworth the Third?" Daphne proposed in a straight tone.
Slowly, Narcissa shook her head. "I do not think so."
Ten minutes later, Harry was out like a light, while the blond was still elaborating his current approach. Chuckling under his breath, Draco called for Kreacher. When the elf popped in with his master's duvet, he spread it over his friend, before he started brewing some Pepper-Up potion. They would need it tomorrow.
"Indeed," the Lady Black confirmed, "Timotheus Black was a skilled parselmage, specialised in wards. Nothing that was cast after him was quite as effective. Though, I have to admit that your wards integrated more seamlessly into the grand design than those of any other witches or wizards before, including all members of my direct family."
"You hated him at Hogwarts!" the pureblood threw at him, rearing up at the unpleasant memories of potion classes through the years where Snape had done everything in his power to belittle Harry Potter and embarrass him in front of his peers.
Pressing his lips together, so he would not smile at his companion's haste to apologise with a contrite, "Sorry, Narcissa," Draco tilted his head and replied, "Apologies, mother, but Harry works at the Ministry, where you can find an entire department full of Potion Masters. I am not unfamiliar with the subject either. Maybe, I could get a copy about your thoughts on said potion?"
Irritated by Hermione's explanation and the heroics of a former, convicted(!) Death Eater, Head Auror Robarts growled, "Give me that!" When he reached for the cane, he barely made contact before flinching back, letting it fall to the floor. His hand was covered in blisters as if he had reached into a fire for several seconds. "Bloody hell, Malfoy!"
His godfather, in a patented manner he had perfected over the decades, merely glared him into submission and repeated in an icy tone, that allowed no argument, "Get me Harry Potter. Right now!" before he fell back into his pillows.
The young witch flinched when Harry reached out for her. Immediately, the Auror slid back and raised his hands in a placating gesture. "It's alright. I won't touch you without your permission. But we need to get you cleaned up and … and you need to apply the salve. Do you think you can do it yourself, or do you want me to wake Draco's mum?"
Slowly growing agitated at being shouted at by the one friend he had cared about the most and had mourned deeply, the pureblood shot back, "I would not have to go behind my liege's back if the boy was not so foolishly stubborn about everything that concerns his own wellbeing!"
Lunch was nearly finished, Draco was just stirring in a few more spices when the boy finally spoke. The two wizards had to stop their current tasks since the boy was talking barely above a whisper. "Don't you like me anymore, Uncle Harry?"
The most appalling thing for Harry had been the realisation that the demands of the desperate woman were entirely reasonable. She had wanted additional support for those children, who showed an inclination for magic, and the personnel and means to educate them. Sadly, the way she had gone about it had been all wrong. Threatening the kids she was supposed to protect … well, it hadn’t worked out.
"My Mistress and I share a similar taste and Draco here, would just be to our liking."
"Someone is in an excellent mood this morning," Neville commented as his partner entered their office, with a tray of Starbucks and an assortment of breakfast items, both savoury and sweet.
Looking up from his breakfast-bagel, Harry smiled overly bright, "Good morning, Neville. Oh, good morning, Harry. I see you've brought breakfast, how nice of you. Oh, bagels with cream cheese and salmon, my favourite. How considerate. Of course, Neville, only the best for my favourite partner. Please, help yourself. By the way, how was your weekend? My weekend was great, thanks for asking, Harry. How was yours?" He then pushed over the previously mentioned bagels. "
"Griphook," Ron bowed, as did his friends. "We were not planning ano… I mean
Neville and Harry were debating on how to dig into the earth with minimal consequences for both the roots that seemed to have claimed every corner of the garden and themselves since the ground was pretty much frozen solid. Wanting to do as little harm as possible, the raven-haired contemplated forgoing Luna's cave for now and create one above the ground until spring.
Closing and locking the door behind them, Harry shared, “Lucius has an idea.”
"And?" Knowing that tone, the raven-haired tried very hard not to smile.
Looking back, the Pendragon nodded. "You are right, of course. Lady Malfoy, gentlemen, would you please follow me?"
Turning towards Snape, Neville inquired, "Do you have any idea what's going on?"
was the one who transformed half a floor in his own home into an apartment for Severus' convenience. And
"I …"
Stepping up to the bed, yet holding back, since he as not sure if a tactile offer for comfort would be appreciated, Harry merely put his fingertips on the mattress, as close to his former professor's hand as he dared, without actually touching him. "Tom is responsible for Dumbledore's death, since he was the one who cursed the Gaunt ring. Dumbledore was responsible for his own death, because with his experience, he should have known better than to put on a ring of unknown origin. He was dying and you both knew it when you cast the spell. He could have jumped from the Astronomy tower that night. But it would have been agony to die that way. Having you cast the spell served his 'greater good' as well as assured a painless passing." Only when his tears wet their entwined fingers, did Harry realise that Snape had reached for him, not to take comfort, but to offer it. "In the end, you killed, and I died for his cause. But the war is over now, so I want it to end."
Since that was wide-spread knowledge, Severus nodded.
"Sure, why not? I mean our garden is not as big as this one, but with a few fence-spells easily secure enough for your Inari to play around." The raven-haired shrugged, obviously not seeing a problem with adopting another animal. "Not much is growing there right now, but maybe you could take a look around, Charlie, just to make sure that nothing poisonous is around. She should be fine. For the first few nights, we can put the laundry box up in your room, Draco. Just until she is comfortable enough in her new surroundings. Then … maybe a dog-bed? Do foxes use dog-beds?"
Admiring the black beauty, Narcissa admitted, "She allowed me to care for her, but has not approached me since."
"Can't you all just fucking stop?!" He had yelled at them. "No, Fred is not here, but you all bloody act as if he never existed in the first place!"
"Neville told me that Luna has started dying strands of spider's silk a forget-me-not-blue, last weekend. She plans on crocheting a throw-cover for a newborn's crib."
As a result of his years of service to the Dark Lord, the white−haired man did not even startle when setting down the cup. Only the slight trembling of his hands betrayed his distress when he tilted his head and stated, "Forgive me, my Lord."
Though there was nothing he wanted less than to discuss this particular matter, Severus heard himself asking, "You are speaking from experience?"
"… and prove that they defer to Harry, the Saviour of the Wizarding World, to put people's mind at ease." Neville finished. "We have already gotten Robarts' permission."
eat something! You're on your feet since six-thirty. So, you can at least take your time with dinner!"
"Harry, what …" But before Draco could finish the sentence, the Auror interrupted.
Yet, before Draco could defend his little she-devil, Harry's words were mirrored from the living-room. A moment later, Kingsley wandered into the kitchen, holding an excited Inari at the scruff of her neck. "This little beast tried to chew off my ear. Care to tell me what that's about?"
"How many?"
"Kreacher," commanding the elf's attention, Severus insisted, "has Draco eaten?"
"I'm aware of how hard this entire situation has to be for you. I made it even harder, by suggesting to put someone you love in further danger. I became a spy because I needed to protect your mother from a similar situation, and now I expect you to go through with this."
"Is that something you would want?" The pureblood wondered, "To prevent a pregnancy?"
Dragging his fingers through his hair, receiving a stinging hex for his troubles and a wave of magic that put his hairstyle back in place, Harry sighed. "I haven't thought of that."
The next evening, the Slytherin team-captain had risen during dinner and announced, "For saving our beaters, I award Antoine Thomson, Sandra Jenkins and Ian Glen one house-point each."
"He …"
One blink and a barely-there clenching of his fingers.
Dumbfounded, Harry looked at the leather bracelet. "I … don't know," he admitted, reaching but not touching until Severus gave a subtle nod. "I made this with you in mind; keyed it to your magical signature. That's why these artefacts take so long to create, compared to the cane or the ring Lucius and Narcissa carry. I would say the wards only work for the person they were made for. But to be completely honest, we've never tested it, so I can't say for sure."
yourself, not to speak of your personal hygiene?"
"And you simply thought it a clever idea, to let a former Death Eater get his hands on them?"
They all were, but Narcissa was grateful that her host refrained from pointing that out.
Deciding he was done with that. He had packed his bag, had hired a live-in-nurse and had entered Gringotts the next morning. One of Hermione’s charmed bags over his shoulder and his purse full off money, he had gone to Kings Cross and left the country the same day.
Rolling his eyes, the Potion Master shared, "Draco is engaged to Astoria Greengrass."
Looking at the Malfoys, who put a lot of effort into hiding behind their Slytherin masks, the head of the Weasley family took a deep breath. "No love is lost between the two of us, is it, Malfoy?" He had to admire the pure-blood, for his composure when facing the vast number of Weasleys scrutinising him. "It takes a strong child to question the teachings of his father, and an even stronger man to rethink his own convictions. Once, we debated our convictions of what counted as a disgrace to wizarding kind. We had to agree to disagree, … with flying fists," he added self-deprecating, before returning to the matter at hand. "However, things have changed. I think we can realise now, that we are more alike than we ever wanted to acknowledge. In the end, for both of us, all that we did was supposed to be in the best interest of our family. Therefore, I would like to invite you to stand by my side, on this hallowed night so our families can celebrate together."
responsibility. That that was the path fate had set him upon. And he had succeeded. Killed the bastard. Died for the cause. So why did he still feel responsible?
"Harry," she breathed, as if afraid to say it out loud. "Draco left the Manor Saturday, not long before midnight, citing that he would not find any rest there. He promised to return in the morning. When he didn't, I assumed that you had set him on a potion or a new research project. Something for one of your ongoing cases rather than the squib project."
Hovering protectively, the elf revealed. "At the place of the evil wizards, Kreacher was exploring, felt the dark magic. Her parents were weak. Dark Wizards had drained them. Kept her hidden, unbound but safe. They put Kreacher in the stove. Only room for two."
Another split-second hesitation, then Severus Snape tilted his head. "Thank you."
With an amused glint in his eyes, the shaggy-haired blond tilted his head and challenged. "If you're so savvy, you undoubtedly know where we are as well."
Hermione was looking at her husband in surprise, but Harry was already turning his head, requesting quietly, "Draco?"
Looking up at her pale friend who - despite all hardships still tried so hard to make their world a better, a safer place - the young witch smiled and promised. "Always."
"Say it!" The master of the house demanded.
Quietly, Astoria shared, "Apparently, they have upped their game."
"A few hours. It will be enough. We can rest once Hermione is safe again."
Kissing the snitch, Harry watched it open and let the stone fall into his hand. He expected to feel dread, fear, maybe longing, but there was only gratitude. George meanwhile had barged on, " Dumbledore's wand was powerful because its owner was a powerful wizard. But the Resurrection Stone … that's madness! Please, Harry, you have to see that!"
Though Draco made an acquiescent gesture, he stated, "You're stalling!"
When the boy in question thundered down the stairs, his godfather swept him up and, after bidding Draco goodbye, they flooed to the Burrow.
Chuckling, the librarians all claimed seats at the round table, looking quite at home there, inviting the Auror's to join them with a gesture.
Collecting a round of drinks, sighing at her pumpkin juice, Hermione shrugged when Harry asked. "It's Stephen Sandorn. He was on paternity leave for the last few months. His wife was injured during a raid, and his twins were born prematurely."
With a heartbroken expression, James inquired, "Did he hurt you?"
Knowing better than to dismiss Luna's casual remarks, Harry wanted to know, "Why?"
"Relocate from where?"
Sorry for being so short but I have just started my holiday in Styria and this day was packed with arriving, and swimming and sauna and a delicious dinner and a rainstorm after two weeks of unbearable heat in Vienna. All in all, I am beat! But I'm so happy that my vacation is finally starting.
"I need to know what kind of poison this is about," Draco stated one evening during dinner. It was one of the rare occasions that Harry had actually been on time for them to share the meal. Apparently, the week leading up to Yule was high time for smugglers, and the Auror Corp was working themselves to the bones.
Usually, they would have preferred to claim positions in the cellar, weaving the magic through the foundation of the building and upwards from there. However, since none of them were familiar with the layout beyond what could be found on the official website, they had only had the main and first story floorplans available to them. Though, Hermione had hinted that she was working on a spell to search hidden databases with magic. How that was supposed to work was beyond anybody.
His wand snapped into his hand with barely a thought of the Accio-spell, when the door snapped open, revealing a furious Lucius Malfoy, who took in the scene for a mere heartbeat, before he shouted, “How dare you, you ungrateful, little half-blood? I do everything in my power to help you, and in exchange, you molest my son? You should be ashamed of …”
A cold, deep voice had him pull his wand instinctively. "How dare you invade our dungeons, Gryffindor?"
Missing were the guardians of the books of the Magical Library under Westminster Abbey.
"Yes, Master?" The elf popping up startled a few of the Hufflepuffs closest to him, but after a brief, apologetic glance from Harry, they returned to their meals. "How did you know that I would be interested in Professor Snape's room. Did you read my mail?"
"And the other half was jealous." Harry finished from his place at the door.
With a soft smile; one the raven-haired hated her for since she never showed the same love when talking about her older son; the witch admitted, "Of course, I knew. This is my house after all. I was not aware of the location of Regulus' lab after he had guarded it with the help of the trice damned house-elf he had this unnatural fondness for. But I was aware that he was brewing in my house. He was not discreet enough when purchasing his ingredients."
"Of course, I can," Narcissa confirmed. "However, since I might be involved in something dangerous in the immediate future, I can't make any promises in cases of emergency. I'm through with being a victim."
Finally, he pulled out the platinum and emerald cufflinks, holding them out to Draco. "My dad obviously had a thing for such jewellery. He must have collected at least twenty pairs. Do you, … would you like to wear them?"
Lucius nearly tripped over his own feet in his haste to storm the kitchen where the Aurors were still discussing their lack of options over a late breakfast. "They are going to sacrifice him!"
"My hair is green!" The former Lord forced out exasperated.
"Why not take the book with you instead of going back and forth?"
Since his knees started to give out, despite leaning against the wall, Harry reluctantly returned to the chaise.
Harry noticed all three Malfoys flinching, yet this was something he insisted on, especially in his own home. "His name was Tom Riddle, or Voldemort if you prefer that. He is not some all−powerful wizard, any longer, who terrorises our world. I saw to that! So, as long as you are in this house, call him either by his given, or his chosen name."
"No, we pledged our allegiance to you in vows and words and deeds in exchange for your protection. And judging by what has just transpired, this deal seems to work entirely to our advantage."
"Maybe," his wife agreed, "But we have to go through this, nineteen more times. So, we should ask for all the help we can get."
Trying to tame his hair, he sighed resigned. At least she had not screeched from the top of her lungs. Still, this was unacceptable. “Lady Black, we have talked about this. You don’t verbally abuse me in my own home, and I don’t cover your portrait with pink spray-paint.”
“No one could survive on these rations, let alone two people!” Harry glared, snapping at the colleague who oversaw the Malfoy’s house arrest and the according to provisions.
With narrow eyes, Alexander Pince accused him quietly, "What is it, Potter? Did you think that I was raised in a barn? That I do not know how to treat a Lady? Aunt Irma would have had my head, had I not shown the appropriate manners in society. Now, instead of standing around, catching flies, I suggest you go and fetch the Lady some tea. Or do you suggest we put her on water and bread for the durations of this case?"
"Yes," Ron whispered, reaching out for his best friend, pulling him into a three-way-hug.
"Still," Severus forced out, "You … could … have lost … your … voice" Growing quieter towards the end, due to the strain talking this loudly put on his throat.
"Tell me about it."
Sneering the unwilling Death Eater challenged, "Who would care?"
"What did you do in retaliation?" Narcissa asked.
"Your, …" Ron choked, looking at his sister. "Alright, I get it. I'll keep his sorry arse glued to the sofa."
--O-O--
Harry nodded, deciding for all of them, "This ends tonight. Let's get these bastards!"
"Iridescent tea?"
"I should hope so. This one if for you, after all."
Oblivious to the drama that was playing out a few feet beneath him, Draco was staring at the calculations he had made on an old calk-board he had found in the attic. It was charmed in a way that would only allow the writer to read its content.
"You know," Neville pondered, out of the blue. "Muggles have already surpassed us in technological advancements, but sometimes I wonder who
"Exactly! They've found a loophole, so to speak, in your grandfather's disownment of your mother. If someone who has fought by your side, could vouch for your impeccable character and your best intentions for the wizarding world, you could be welcomed back into the family fold."
Mutinously, the older wizard averted his face and hissed, "I don't see why you … should have cared."
"No!" The young wizard protested, "I asked you not to buy me anything. You promised! This, right here, is all I ever wanted."
Like it had always been in the Great Hall, things just happened. The house elf had to be in a room with a near identical setup, because all of a sudden, the furni-ture was replaced. But not with new, shiny things. The four-poster-bed had clearly been in use before, as had the desk in the corner. The chair, in front of it, looked well loved, but what made Draco understand, where these things had come form, was the armchair that had replaced the one beside the bed. It was black, and the leather was buttery-soft and the blond would have recognised it anywhere, since he had used it countless times in the past.
"Language, Lord Potter-Black," she chuckled.
Covering his hand, Hermione reminded him. "You don't have to, Harry. But Lucius Malfoy is a grown man and short of wielding your power over him - as would be your right - you can only trust his judgement on his limits and that he will approach you if he reaches them."
With a grateful nod, Narcissa climbed the last steps and opened the door. "In that case, be welcome to Malfoy Manor."
After a quick shower, Draco could not afford to waste hot water, that would be unsuitable, he brushed back his hair and studied his reflection. Though in the past, he had given much thought to his appearance, over the last four years, he had gotten used to seeing a gaunt and grey face looking back at him. No wonder, since he had learned to function on about four hours of sleep each night. Nightmares as a bi−nightly occurrence did not make for restorative recovery.
"Narcissa," the raven-haired wizard interrupted gently. "Don't you think I know how many hours you have put into this? Don't you think that I am aware of the amount of needlework and blood you have given? I have been out of ideas of how to make this happen since before you came and now you have reached the same point. You need all the power you can get for this to work. This wand battled the Dark Lord the day of his resurrection and rose to the challenge. I even managed to repair it with the Elder Wand after it was broken. It's the best shot we've got and you know it!"
may your Spirit shine bright, this very night.
After wolfing down the first few bites, Harry explained, "We found our missing librarians today, and they are kind of residing at Malfoy Manor for the foreseeable future."
"Fuck."
Recalling the night Pince had caught him bringing in his family and friends to help with the ritual at the British Library, Harry knew the wizard understood. Still, he confirmed, "No, it isn't."
"It's alright, Sir. Everything is alright. You are safe now. Tom is dead. Voldemort, I mean. It's over."
"You could have just asked me to make some," his friend suggested, but the other wizard grinned and snatched away the last grilled tomato. "And where would be the fun in that?"
As it turned out, that was not an easy question. Though Bill offered more analytic spells, it needed both of their power and the help of all wards to discover the source.
"We'll make do," Harry nodded, unsure if he was trying to convince himself or his colleagues. "The others can erect anti-apparition wards, blanketing the area. You and I can cast a one-way shield, making it impossible for them to hit us full force."
Severus was an inch away from drawing his wand and hexing the stupid brat to kingdom come. But then he reminded himself that Harry was no longer his pupil and that he could only offer help when that idiot child was ready to accept it.
"Ready, mate?"
Clutching the stone so firmly that his knuckles shone white, Draco protested weakly, "But he gave it to me!"
--O-O--
"No."
"Harry," Neville reminded him, "You have some pretty radical ideas for the future of our people. And no matter how much we stand behind you, you will need a far bigger support group than us if you want to succeed."
"All would be best," Draco quipped up from the door, hesitant to enter as he waited for the inevitable explosion when his aunt realised what a big secret they had kept from her … from all of Britain in fact.
"You threatened Inari. That's basically the same."
And from her point of view, Neville guessed that actually made sense.
Beaming brightly, the boy bounced his head up and down. "Yes! He was proud 'n' strong 'n' fierce and really a good guard. But then Herculus came because some bloody bastard king wanted the apples and killed him dead." Starting to distribute yellow dots on his now blue paper, Teddy shook his head. "Poor dragon."
"Kreacher understands," the elf replied tonelessly.
"Draco, darling, you have to wake up."
"It seems that I have to impose on you, Miss Granger. If you show me your office, I will give you my word to stay out of your way."
Pressing his lips together, the blond nodded in understanding and looked down at his plate again, making no further inquiry.
succeed.
Folding her arms before her chest, the witch inquired, "How long?"
Gratefully accepting more water from the embarrassed blond, Harry looked around and noticed knitting needles, idling away in a chair, poking at each other. Against the wall stood a small, uncomfortable looking couch, covered with a colourful cushion and a threadbare blanket. "How long …?" He began when the voice of Molly Weasley was heard outside.
Swallowing at the implication that somehow, they were friends, Draco shook his head. "I still think it's reckless of you to let me read these books."
"We brought pizza," Hermione piped up from behind.
--O-O--
"Harry," the young man coughed, before shaking her hand. "Please, call me Harry."
Sinking back into his chair, Severus took a sip of his tea - a strange blend, yet not unpleasant; Emerald seemed to be experimenting again - before he admitted, "No, not at the beginning."
Harry could not even imagine how it had to be to live with such conviction. To never find rest, because your nightmares tainted your every waking moment, everything you loved and promised retribution with his dying breath. He had to prove to Draco once and for all that there was no chance in hell for Tom Marvollo Riddle to ever come back. But sadly, not every wizard was capable of Leglimency. A pensive was out as well because Harry didn't have one. There would be too many memories to sort through anyway. Rubbing his face, watching the distraught young man, who seemed eager to meld with the head−board, a thought occurred to him.
And George deflated like a balloon. Tonelessly he inquired, "How do you know that?"
When he had finally stood before her, eyes lined with black charcoal, skin porcelain smooth and lips the inviting colour of rose-pedals, she had nodded approvingly and Draco was ashamed to admit now, that he had been relieved. Without the thought of resistance, he had put on the clothes she had lain out for him with barely a minute to spare. He had hated himself for trembling ever so slightly, as he had stood before her, presenting himself. Even more so, when she had gestured at her feet, and he had kneeled, without so much as a thought about defiance.
Taking a deep breath, Lily recalled, "He was fascinated by you. He was around whenever he had the chance. However, he never dared to touch you; never carried you around. Instead, he help me in any way imaginable, did not even shy away from your dirty nappies. But … Peter never allowed himself to come close. It was as if you were too precious to touch."
The magic of all participants coursed through Harry's body, setting his blood on fire and he had to clench his teeth and work through the overload, before he could start his own chant to bind the spell to the very foundation of the building. They had discussed various anchors, but since the runes could be drawn and seep right into the stone, the tiles of the floor had been their best bet. Lightning raced over the marble, connecting their rune circles they had drawn to bind their individual powers, indicating that the magic was working as intended. What the raven-haired Auror at the centre had not been prepared for, was the amount of energy going out and returning to him using his body as a conduit, to reach the floor and from there on out through the entire building.
“May I come in?”
Everything was soft and warm and tender when Draco slowly woke. Moving a little, he absent−minded noticed something sticking to his cheek, but since the comfortable touch continued, he did not want to overthink it.
The goblin vanished through a small door at the side after grabbing it, leaving them to wait for an undetermined amount of time. Since both wizards were aware of that tactic, they just lingered.
"I could, but the answer would not change. I am an adult with enough knowledge of potions, full access to a functioning lab and a Lord who has given me free rein in it. So, until Harry tells me otherwise, this will be the research I put my time and effort into. If I'm at the end of my wit, I will come to you for advice. However, until then, I will explore every avenue to put the werewolf-gene that lies in my little cousin to sleep, so he can live a life free of his father's curse."
"That's impossible."
"What? No!" Harry interrupted forcefully. "I'm just on vacation and only for a week. Don't worry, Draco, everything is fine. Our boss just has a temper and needs to cool off, before I can come back in. It's going to be alright, don't worry."
"Maybe you should try standing on your head," a dreamy voice suggested from behind. "Things will be clearer then."
"Ours, actually."
With a concerned expression, Narcissa folded her napkin and rose from the table. “I better make sure he doesn’t break his neck on the way to the shower.” But Draco held her back.
"How dare you contradict me?" the librarian hissed. "I am Christopher Pendragon, guardian of the knowledge and treasures of Merlin's legacy!"
Baffled, Lily inquired, "He told you about that?"
"Because they are!" The Gryffindor replied easily, serving them both the stew Kreacher had prepared. With Emerald's help, it would seem, since a few edible flowers decorated the pot. After a few minutes, where he had had the time to think of his pureblood friend's words, he added softly, "That's how it should be, how I always wanted my relationships to be as well. Nobody comes out on top, and nobody stands at the bottom. Anything else only leads to heartache."
"I saw you casting. You're still not as fast as you used to be. So, why come at all?"
Shrugging, Severus suggested, "Start with what you don't … and go from there." Levitating the quilt from his bed to Harry, he then commanded. "For now, sleep."
Hiding his face, Draco choked, "I killed someone." Then he started trembling. He had not thought about it before. Had not let himself think about it. But here, in the darkness of Harry's bedroom, the implications of what had happened finally crashed over Draco, suffocating him until he felt like drowning. "By Merlin, I killed a man, and I am not even sorry. I'm a monster!"
"Harry, mostly," the older wizard sighed, standing ramrod straight at the end of the bed. This had the potential to become one big disaster. Still, poised and self-controlled, he suffered the witch's scrutiny. "Draco helped as well. It is thanks to him that they were able to wake me up and cure Nagini's poison."
Looking at the patient, who lay unmoving, Harry gave in to the illusion that he was listening attentively. So, he slipped from the windowsill and claimed his armchair. "Albion … Great Britain … it is as if the light magic permeates every living thing; every tree, every plant, every beast that calls the white isle his or her home. In India, you can taste the magic in the air. A snake I befriended, told me she could even feel it in her belly when she slithered over the earth. Magic wasn't dark there, but it wasn't light either. I could not put my finger on it, but it felt … kind of … reddish brown. Like the power came from the life that populates the land. Brazil …"
"Yes, Harry-Sir-Master? What can Emerald be doing for you?"
"Draco came to me!
"I didn't … worked well enough …"
"I won't even grace that question with an answer since you know perfectly well who I am talking about. But what I will do is offer an inquiry: If Harry or Draco were in your shoes, and you could help them, how would you feel if they just ignored you and went about their ways, possibly hurting themselves in the process?"
"If we manage to keep the conjuring of the trackers hidden!" Neville gave cause for concern.
Five to ten, they manoeuvred the cage Draco had built into the back garden. They would leave it to Inari to find a place for it and then put it there.
to take the risk of expanding beyond the channel.
A helpless outburst from Draco pulled him out of his musings. The blond's voice echoed through the garden. "For Merlin's sake, if it's dangerous for Inari it has to go!"
One, who only dealt in artefacts.
"Excuse me!" Harry bristled. He absolutely despised talking to reporters. Yet had done so for nearly half an hour without complaint. His partner had maybe said two sentences before they had left him be. Now he was getting praised for that? The Head Auror only offered a compliment if a member of his team had performed outstandingly!
Seeing his son pale, with sunken in eyes, sleeping fitfully on the couch, Lucius had frozen. Once again crushed by the visible evidence of his mistakes. All he had ever wanted was to help the Malfoy name to greatness, as his father had always expected of him. How could he have gone so wrong about that?
Both ignored the gasps from Pince and Leewood. The witch offered a tiny smile. "That's confidential, Auror Longbottom."
−−O−O−−
Whipping around, since his elf had popped up right behind him, Harry gripped his heart. "Could you stop doing that, for heaven's sake?!"
"Before his very eyes."
“Expelliarmus!”
Without consulting his brain, his body decided that sitting was an excellent idea. Clearly, his best friend had him well trained. When the floo flared up, however, he was on his feet in an instant. "Headmistress. Madame Pomfrey. Thank you for coming."
Once the raven-haired had left, Narcissa looked up at her friend. "You don't expect to be able to dismantle the wards."
"It doesn't matter." Wrapping his arms around her from behind, lacing their fingers in front of her stomach, Ron gingerly kissed his wife's hair. "We have done everything in our power to make sure that fighting like that won't ever be necessary again."
"Let's just say, we are even now. You've saved me by declaring me dead, making my victory over Tom possible in the first place."
"Did you, at any point during your last conversation with Astoria Rosier, offer advice on how she could kill her husband?"
Nodding absent-minded, the young man replied, "I understand. Thank you, Lucius."
With intuitive vision and beauty of sight.
That year, it had been quite a scene, because Ron had been so tired and furious with himself for everything he had not managed to achieve, and angry with the world at large to not be miraculously better, now that Voldemort was gone. Hermione and Harry had not tried to calm him or ease his pain. They had merely hugged him and stayed by his side, unbothered by their tears of sympathy and anger and grieving. At least anybody entering the cemetery that night had been smart enough not to bother them.
Laughing, Draco accused scandalised, "I started to count my toes after every apparition!"
When they lay in bed a few minutes later, the blond could still feel the tension in the other wizard's body. "You are aware that I was, in fact, the one who told Teddy that he could eat any berries he found?" Not that the berries had been what had made him sick, but they had undoubtedly drawn the child to the dangerous plant.
Nodding slowly, Harry looked from Snape to Draco. "Yes. Now all I need is a potioneer with enough heart for the craft to wake him up. Hermione succeeds at everything she sets her mind upon. Ron and George have become brilliant at brewing, but neither of the three has the heart of a true master. The question is, do you, Draco? Do you have enough heart and genius and compassion to save your godfather?"
Water
"Pot… I mean Harry told me to repair a perfectly functioning piece of magic and instructed me to catalogue his books if I couldn't. So, I started on a list." Gesturing towards the desk that sat in the centre of the room, and numerous scrolls that littered its surface. "Usually, when I'm through with a letter, I just double−check with the index, so I won't forget anything."
"Yes, Master."
of March at 6 p.m. sharp. For the entire month of February, you will be given a chance to explore the land and the culture. Your first host will have a list of temples of minor and major gods and goddesses in India, special emphasis on all the trickster gods." She wiggled her eyebrows suggestively, then squeaked when George and Angelina pounced on her, wrestling her to the floor.
They really had, and since everybody had promised to be back tomorrow, the lion's share of the work would be done when evening came around. "Thanks for your help."
Severus Snape decided that he enjoyed having his brain blown out. Though he preferred to eat and drink without an audience, especially without the little elven child gazing at him giddily. She had a strange, plastic cup with a disfigured mermaid at the side hovering before him. So, he made the conscious effort to reach for the straw and take a sip. It. Was. Divine! The taste of the creamy milk, the delicious chocolate that was just on the right side of sweet and sharp was amazing, and the bite of the alcohol was something he had sorely missed without even realising it.
"No, but you still took every chance to prove to Ron how inferior you thought him to be, at school."
Putting down her quill, Hermione looked at her friend and stated decisively, "I think this might be the only way to save Britain from another war. In the past, it was always 'us' muggleborn or half-bloods versus 'them', the pureblood elite. I think when our children understand that we are all the same, they can pull wizarding Britain into the 21
"Yea," the red-head nodded, grateful for the chance to flee this awkward scene. Though he did not know what was going on, the pale faces of the adult Malfoys and the way Lucius kept looking at Harry and his son spoke of a huge hippogriff in the room, he certainly did not want to poke with a stick. He briefly patted Harry on the back with a, "See you on Sunday," before departing.
Narcissa, however, had smiled when he had uttered that question in bewilderment, raising her hand at Neville, who had looked affronted on her behalf. "I think you misunderstand the value our society puts on its Ladies, Harry. A woman who marries and therefore leads the social life of her family has various duties. Not only is she responsible for the representation of her entire family - houses included - she cares for the relations to other houses, educates the offspring, organises events and evaluates charities. Her knowledge of history - not only that of her own house but all twenty-eight - the relations and relationships as well as the magic expected of her, has to be vast. Both my parents and Lucius' wanted a well-educated partner for the patriarchs of any family. So, tell me, Harry, which of these demands scream 'under-valuated' to you?"
Many of you might have noticed, that my posting schedule has changed. From once a week, I only post once in a fortnight. As much as it caught me by surprise, I'm nearly up to date with my writing and posting and that kind of stresses me out. I honestly try to write whenever inspiration strikes me, but since I've developed an interest in watercolours, my writing has slowed down. Please, don't worry. I still have a lot of ideas for Sententia and I WILL finish this with an appropriate happy ending. I might just need a while.
Outside, the pair met with George and Ron, who had stayed behind. While the later offered a candy-bar to Lucius, something the ravenous pureblood accepted gratefully after a confirming nod from his liege, the former wanted to know, "What about Hermione?"
"It is completely safe!" The blond insisted. "I did my research, just like you taught me. Nothing in there is even remotely toxic and the reciprocal effects between the ingredients are neglectable."
During their hunt, but especially after starting his life with Hermione, Ron had discovered, that he had a knack for cooking. Undoubtedly a skill inherited from his mother. He managed to put decent meals on the table with but a few flicks of his wand. Hermione had been quite reluctant at the beginning, afraid that Ron would 'bring work home' so to speak. However, she could not be prouder of her husband these days. His skills had significantly expanded, and the redhead thrived to put a new spin on old dishes, making them savoury but never too exotic.
"'ncle Harry!" Rose crooned, but one look at Harry's face told Ron that this was not a social visit. Harry was pale and jittery. So, the redhead picked up his daughter and instructed, "Brooms are in the shed. Yours too. Cast a disillusionment charm. The neighbour's kids are having a sweet sixteen party in their back garden and a broom would certainly draw unwanted attention."
"Make time!" the older wizard commanded, not even bothering to correct the hated abbreviation of his own name. "What could be so important that you neglect both yourself and your familiar? Inari is binding herself to you. That's a delicate time in her life and a gift, as you are undoubtedly aware of."
"George Weasley, Sir." With a smile, he shook the Auror's hand. "I once attended a guest lecture you gave on the W.U.L. (Wizards University London) on Transformative Spell-Design for Analytic Purpose. It was enlightening!"
>To George and Angelina, from Ginny and family<
"So, everything … all of his potions, his journals, his belongings … they could all be …"
"Danger as in 'not abducted' librarians messing around with a time-turner," Harry stated drily.
Instead of being miffed, Charles Leewood merely tilted his head, "So it seems."
"I was held hostage for three days. Then Severus came."
Distracted by the excited family, Harry shrugged, "About twenty months on and off. At first, Justin did not dare to ask her out. With Ginny being a famous Quidditch player and all. When she finally convinced him to give them a chance, he insisted on making the manager position at his company. He works somewhere where they deal with the import and export of dangerous and fragile goods. He was a travelling salesperson before but wanted them not starting their relationship without at least one of them remaining stationary. After his promotion, they put down the commission for a little house near Eton."
To that, Harry did not know how to reply.
But now, onwards. After all, there are nearly 60.000 words to enjoy in Sententia still to come.
Trading a glance with his wife, the two pure-bloods sighed a little. However, Narcissa chose to answer. "Had he been bolder and more outgoing, he might have had a chance. His genius with potions would have given him something to utilise. Slytherins respect talent and cunning. But if you don't display enough confidence in your abilities, nobody will look at you twice."
As always when giving Teddy his bath, Harry's dress-shirt was soaking wet afterwards. Since it was evening already, he just slipped on one of his old t−shirts. After putting his godson to bed, reading him two bedtime stories, he slipped into the second bedroom. He never worried about the child coming in, since Teddy was usually very well behaved, and Harry had explained to him, in no uncertain terms, that the man in the second bedroom was in an enchanted sleep and absolutely could not be disturbed. Also, it was their secret, one the boy could not even share with his grandmother, and while that had been uncomfortable in the beginning, Teddy had accepted it by now. After all, it had been like this his entire life.
After a brief dash into the kitchen, where the raven-haired spotted Emerald under the table, creating a somewhat unstable tower with their good silver, he merely traded a nod with Kreacher, before climbing the stairs up to the third floor. Entering Snape's room, he barely bothered with the sheet the assistant on night-duty had filled out. There never were any changes anyway.
Nudging him, Hermione recalled, "It's our family now as well because they've adopted us."
Faced with the blond's unease, the raven-haired sighed and messed up his hair. "Could we maybe talk in the kitchen? We haven't eaten since last night and I'm starving." Not that he had been able to stomach a lot, maybe the quarter of a pizza at most.
"You're welcome."
Sampling the wine, he had been served, finding it to his liking, Lucius took another sip, before joining the conversation. "Those were the only times you were allowed to use a goblet instead of your usual water-glass. You insisted since you were allowed a 'grown-up-drink' as well."
Once Harry and Lucius were alone, the young wizard reclaimed his seat and studied the gasping man. Apparently, the spell was meant to punish but not to harm, since the pureblood was still conscious. However, the former Lord seemed to be bound quite effectively, unable to defend himself, should his liege decide to retaliate for the attack. Recalling the details of what Hermione had told him about the Rite, Harry slowly raised his wand and brushed over his trembling vassal's neck. The magical choke-hold lessened gradually, allowing Lucius to breathe freely once again. The liege permitted the other to gather his composure and to think about what he had done. The platinum-haired seemed to curl into himself, until the invisible bindings seemed to be the only thing holding up his trembling body. After a while, he choked, "I am sorry, my Lord, I thought …"
Casting an absent-minded identification spell, Neville's mouth twitched, "Yes, Sir," before downing the potion.
"Narcissa, please," she interrupted him quietly, her voice thick with tears. "I think the saviour of my family has the right to call me by my name."
Studying him, probably seeing much more than Harry was comfortable with, Narcissa tilted her head and confirmed, "So mote it be, Lord Potter-Black."
"No," the pureblood insisted, "Why did you turn your back on us?"
Satisfied with the vixen's new home, the dragon-timer smiled. "Inari is difficult for everyone
"What is it? What is it? Let me see!" He insisted, climbing Harry like a tree.
"16 Years of Teaching at Hogwarts where you were housed and fed. One year with the salary of a headmaster. Oh, and let's not forget the Order of Merlin 2
"Do you think it will ever get any easier?" Harry asked after a while.
"It's willow and unicorn hair," Ron informed him, putting his wand into Draco's hand. "It is not yours, but for this one spell it will work because we both want it to."
"Thank you."
The boy seemed to ponder that revelation, watching the ground, deep in thought. After a minute, he inquired, "And what do you think is Nana doing?"
are the reason for him messing up. And, second, because his mistress is not at all happy with the situation. She spoke before the Wizengamot twice to save him. Sam, … you know, Samantha Greenberg from the Department of International Affairs, works in the same office. She told me that Lydia Blackwood is furious for losing her lackey."
"I see you chose to come yourself. Eager to help us along?" The raven-haired inquired with a raised eyebrow.
The third wand emitted weak sparkles, so he took it.
Concerned, Leewood inquired, "I know your parselmagic is impressive, but are you sure you can cover such a big area? And your little Malfoy will be right in the middle. What should keep them from sacrificing him anyway?"
"What are you doing, Potter?" The former teacher inquired sharply when he noticed that Harry was shedding his clothes, despite the cold spring weather.
"Gimme!" Ron demanded excitedly, throwing Draco the journal, before excitedly leafing through the book Harry offered. After but a minute, he shouted excitedly. "Ha! Knew it!" Placing the schoolbook on the table, Ron read out loud, "While there are many ways to stabilise volatile ingredients, Essence of Lacewing Fly is one of the most common, since it is non-toxic and can be ingested with minimal side-effects. For salves and poultices, the bark of Variegated Goton might be used, since the mild skin irritation it can cause, is neglectable, compared to the inflictions it might attempt to cure."
The Lady allowed herself to be manoeuvred into a conjured chair, while Drake stalked over to the Potion Master. Looking the man up and down, he stated drily. "Took you long enough. I was wondering when you would finally grace us with your presence, Master Snape."
Impatiently, the older wizard gestured and demanded in a harsh tone that reminded Harry too much of countless hours in the potion's labs of Hogwarts, "Sit!"
"You mean aside from your godson?"
The nefarious noise was back, and someone was shaking him. He wanted it to stop. The pain. The noise. The confusion. Severus felt like a lead-weight was sitting on his chest, and when he finally managed to pry his eyes open, enormous green eyes were looking at him. But those were the wrong eyes. Where was Lily? A sob silenced the noise and reality came crashing down. Lily was dead. His attempt to barter for a better position in the Dark Lord's inner circle had cost her, her life. The only thing that remained was her son, who was now leaning over Severus and attempted to soothe him.
class is."
"Please," it was now Harry's turn to roll his eyes, exaggeratedly. "You are stealing the filling of my mince-pie, washing it down with pineapple coke and chocolate milk, and obviously, plan on rounding that meal off with a meringue cake. If that's not weird, I don't know what is."
"Because I have a feeling that you are right. And if our victims really were taken to pick their brains, they are alive and well. Coerced, maybe, but unharmed and that gives us time to find them."
"I … she …," the raven-haired stammered. Until now, he had thought Astoria to be somehow infatuated with Draco. Otherwise, why would she propose such an arrangement? "So it really is all about power." Maybe Narcissa had been right all these weeks ago. Maybe for a pureblood witch, the prospect of gaining power was enough to go any length.
Pulling himself into a sitting position, winching ever so slightly, Harry inquired after a moment. "Why is the Minister of Magic sitting in my office?"
"Legilimens."
Slowly turning towards his brilliant wife, Ron's face lit up like a Christmas tree. "Hermione, you're a bloody genius!" Turning towards his best friend, he inquired, "Did Snape's journals, by any means, include the half-blood prince's potion's books?"
The blond approached and put a hand on Harry's shoulder. "Don't you think you have a better chance of solving any case if you are not exhausted?" He asked reasonably.
Looking at the centaur, the young wizard inquired, "Why did you come? You did not join the celebrations, only talked to me. Why are you here, if you don't mind me asking."
"Do you believe that it is nothing?"
"Like you?" He spat out. "You are merely …"
Never one to hide from her mistakes, Narcissa stepped forward, but when she opened her mouth, no sound came out. Meanwhile, Severus put his wand away and confronted the Minister, "That spell was of my making."
"Much appre …," Severus started, but stopped himself just in time. "dank you."
"Apple−tree." The toddler continued unfazed. "And he was the pet of this she−god Hora."
Frowning, the wizard looked up. "This is the drink you denied me before."
"Maybe I should call for Emilia …?"
The Malfoys were already sitting at the table, sharing a pot of aromatic tea, while trading the newspaper. When the others entered, Narcissa got up instantly, but Harry soothed her. "It's the weekend, please allow me."
"At 3:52 p.m. the Department of Magical Law Enforcement has registered the use of magic at Malfoy Manor. Since the local residents are either forbidden or not in possession of a wand, we can only conclude that a violation of the rules of Mistress Narcissa Malfoy's house−arrest has occurred. Hence, under paragraph …"
With a small smile, the young man looked at the former Slytherin. "That's not what I asked."
"Not him."
Looking between her husband and Snape for a moment, Hermione merely offered her forehead for a kiss before she rose from the armchair. "Sure, come on, Draco, you can show me where the good stuff is."
--O-O--
Afraid to ask, but too nosy not to, Harry inquired, "Where?"
interfere with her duties. Have I made myself clear?"
Rubbing her little fingers, she had whispered, "Emerald is not being allowed to touch the wizard's whiskey. So Emerald is filling up the glass. Is that good?"
"Yes, please go to the Manor and gather the necessities for our guests."
Tearing her eyes away from her baby−sister, the older woman instructed in a calm voice. "Yes, Harry. You can close the door on your way out."
"We started going over the Potter vaults at Gringotts." Harry shared, rubbing the back of his head nervously.
Severus felt like his head was filled with wool, and he could not fight the exhaustion that pulled him under, despite hating the idea of returning to sleep. He relaxed somewhat, when a soft voice promised, "Don't worry, I'll stay and wake you, should you have another nightmare."
Wands at the ready, the quartet started to wander down a slope. The walls were made of some ancient stones, dark grey and worn from the passage of time. While air would get damper the deeper underground you travelled, the opposite seemed to be true here. After about four or five stories, they finally came to a halt in front of a large door. The wood gave the impression of stone with hinges of brass that shone in the weak light the Aurors had conjured.
Now it was the 'Chosen One's' turn to snap. "And that living arrangement was preceded by a nice cup of tea where Tom and Narcissa discussed his choice of sleepwear. Do you really think she had a choice? She had a child to protect and an insane sister orbiting her."
However, all thoughts of his vassal's trust issues fled his mind when the older wizard was goaded into an attack by his heartless reply. In a last, desperate attempt to gain the upper hand, the former Lord did the unthinkable and picked up Harry's wand, pointing it at its master.
Well thought out. Nothing unreasonable. Yet one point was unacceptable. "No."
"All afternoon," Teddy shrugged. "They made my nose tingle. It felt funny."
we offer gratitude for all there was and is,
"Don't call me that!" Harry snapped. All of this, the house, this situation, the very air of the Manor was getting to him. So being called that particular honorific was just too much at the moment.
A moment of silence that had Lucius tense up again, before Harry and Neville replied, "Yes."
"I know," Ron placated, raising his hands placatingly. "But at the moment, you are just trying to stabilise a component."
--O-O--
"That I did. Very well. Robarts, you heard him. Send over your men. I'll go down to the Department of Mysteries and see if I can find Unspeakable Boleyn."
Then she released the spell, and despite Draco's breakdown, she chided, "On your feet! Try again, and don't make mistakes. As you've surely understood by now, the length of these training sessions is entirely up to you."
A hovering charm added to the long list of spells, Draco had done these past few days. "I did not know."
"Did Harry tell you that you could let go?"
--O-O--
"Sufficiently," Severus replied, closing a hand around his left wrist. "Now leave. I have to finish this potion. I will join you for dinner, so don't even think about skipping the meal."
Though the blond was certainly right, Harry had learned not to doubt Luna's predictions. Also, if all he did was sleep, he might as well do it at home. At least he felt more comfortable at Grimmauld Place than in a hospital. Therefore, he replied weakly, "I'll go home tomorrow."
"How?" Ron asked, confused by the logistics. His sister merely rolled her eyes at him. "All of us touching Harry brings us in close proximity anyway. We lose our shirts, our shoulders touch, that leaves our hands free to anchor Harry and the building together."
Breathing through his nose, Draco concentrated on not throwing up. He could not make a scene. This bastard would leave him alone soon enough. They were at the ministry. Everybody had seen him enter with Potter. In a minute, all this would be over. He could return to the other Slytherins, and at home he could take a shower, to scrub off this bastard touch. All he had to do, was to keep it together and not make a bloody scene!
Scrambling off Harry's lap, the young boy shared exited, "Hi, Neville. I saw a pretty flower today. One that looks like Luna's ear … ear …" Frustrated, he turned around, "Nana, wasit called, the thingies Luna has in her ears?" When his grandmother did not give him the desire attention, he shouted, "
Able to sense the meaning behind the questions, the blond offered comfort by replying easily, "Because so should he."
When Harry came back to himself, the stars were already up in the sky. He was clinging to his broom for dear life. He felt numb all over. His face was like ice, and when he tried to let go of the broom-handle, his fingers refused to cooperate. Blinking in confusion, wondering what had drawn his attention, as he still seemed to hover a hundred feet above the ground, he heard it again. A voice amplified by a 'Sonorus'.
"But …"
Having taken the occasional note until they were back in the cart and on their way to the surface, Griphook probed, "And the name and purpose of that business would be?"
"Oh, no, you don't!" Her partner insisted, pulling her into his lap, effectively keeping her from shielding him by trapping her arms. Then he looked encouragingly at Harry. "Go on, Potter. I've heard fantastic things about you in the locker room."
--O-O--
With a mild sigh, Hermione shook her head. "What part of 'Harry made it for Mr Malfoy.' did you not understand, Sir? What good would protection do that could be taken away at a moment's notice?"
Sweat covered the older wizard's forehead when he was finished. Even Harry was swaying slightly. However, they had been successful in containing the spell. Now it was up to the wards to be strong enough to dispel it.
Their family chuckled. "Actually, it was three-hundred-seventy-eight gallons in total."
Once the drama had played out, Draco went to search for Harry. As expected, he found him at the heart of a pile of children, who were wrestling their favourite uncle to the ground. Aiming to preserve at least a little of his dignity, the blond approached the shrieking and giggling heap and inquired, "I would very much like to freshen up and change. Could you point me to my bag?"
Opening the present, a silver-grey jumper, with an embroidered 'D' fell into the Slytherin's hands. Though he could not be sure, Draco thought it the same colour as his eyes. "She made this for me?"
Claiming the edge of an armchair, Harry messed up his hair, before straightening again. "No, I … I don't want to cause inconvenience, I just thought … after last month … I thought we need to talk."
Looking at his grandmother questioningly, Andromeda nodded. "Our dragon is right. Magic is all about intent. So, if you want it enough, these words will work just fine."
Alexander Pince did look positively murderous when Harry entered the office half an hour too late. Yet when the Auror held up the picknick basket Kreacher had pushed at him before flooing out, his team-leader's ire eased somewhat. When Harry presented overstuffed baguettes, container of hot tomato soup and an entire tray of blueberry muffins, his colleagues were quite excited, pondering if they should send him home for food more often. Harry sent a mental 'Thank you' to Draco, who had undoubtedly thought fast on his feet and helped to prepare lunch for the entire team. He then braved the chair beside his grumpy team-leader, who glared at him between spoons full of hot soup.
Stepping back, she looked up at her friend. "You are right, Harry is nothing but a boy, even younger than my son. So, let us go and tell him that we will take over. After all, between the two of us, I am sure we can find a way to discover the whereabouts of my husband and child."
"Roman?"
"Harry!" Neville called over the babbling. "Send Kreacher home. He's of no use to us at the moment."
"It's okay to be egoistical sometimes," Draco advised his godfather. "The Potters are dead, and I think Harry would like to see these pieces appreciated."
"Actually, Mr Potter," Severus set down his cutlery and entered 'teacher mode'. "A Fidelius is a rather complex ritual anchored to a specific object, meant to target all living things in the vicinity. It is, technically, mind-altering magic, as the charmed object is not physically displaced from this realm, but rather hidden from everyone's mind."
“No!” Narcissa hissed icily. “Walpurga is dead, and I will be damned before I let this witch stand in the way of your happiness. I am the guardian of your family-tree now. Its magic has recognised me already so I will find a way to make this work. Even without a wand. Please, excuse me, Harry.”
With an exhausted smile, Harry nodded at her gratefully. He mumbled a quiet, "Thanks," to Molly and Narcissa before he turned towards Draco and ordered with his last breath, "Eat! Sleep!" Then he drifted off again.
The Potion Master had been surprised to find Emerald still standing on his bed, wringing her little hands. After his first sip, he had sighed contently, before gazing at the elven child.
Harry's views on the divine, reflect in no way my own. Religion and beliefs are always a very sensitive topic that easily offends. That, however, is in no way my intention. Though I consider myself Catholic, I consider many forms of religions valid (no matter the name they give their deity, be it Buddha, Allah or anything else), as long as they intend people to be kind to each other and help those in need. I think that at times even the smallest things can help a person along, sometimes it only takes a smile, an open door, or bringing coffee to a colleague who is really stressed out. Whatever you believe in, I think it is perfectly right if it helps you to feel loved and protected, even (or especially) when you go through a hard time.
When no other reply was forthcoming, Pince turned towards his colleague, "And?"
"The young Master Malfoy has tried to sort through the library but fell asleep an hour into the task. Do you want him awake and put to work again?" The elf's dismissive tone made clear how little he thought of that idea, despite offering it.
His faint reply was drowned by the motherly redhead, berating Harry on his mealtime habits and within moments, the four sat at the kitchen table, to snack on cucumber-sandwiches and tea.
--O-O--
"Harriette?" The raven−haired Auror raised an eyebrow at her, but she just shrugged with a barely concealed grin.
"Why is that of any concern? It is not like the laws are at fault." Andromeda wanted to know, before reaching for her grandson to help him prick his crème brûlée. "Like that, love, just a brief tap!" She smiled when Teddy dug into his favourite dessert. Only when she looked up, did she realise that everybody was staring at her. "Yes?"
Draco swallowed another reply of her touching Harry but did not want to give away his spying. Hence, he merely nodded and stated quietly. "Thank you. I will keep that in mind."
A cold, deep voice had him pull his wand instinctively. "How dare you invade our dungeons, Gryffindor?"
"No church," Harry replied with a grin. "Maya priests from Brazil."
"Exactly. Everything was fine until Griphook opened mum and dad's personal vault. Then, I … I bailed," he admitted.
"I agree."
When he had been snatched out of the garden of Grimmauld Place, he had fought his captors tooth and nail. When they had first thrown him in here, he had taken great pleasure in ripping the sheets, bashing the windows and scratching the furniture. Then the Lady of the house had entered.
Looking at the man, Harry summed up after a few minutes of contemplation. “So, you tell me, after you violated the confidentiality of my work that you want to talk to the prisoner my partner and I have detained a week ago. Alone, mind you, and that I should simply trust your word if I ought to charge him or let him go.”
"I have never brewed it before. But for Teddy, I can learn. Just in case."
Since Severus was currently taking another sip, he merely gestured, and Harry called out, "Come in, Draco."
"Why?"
"I know," he soothed, rubbing her overarched back. "Just take it easy. Stress is not good for baby-Hugo."
Putting a comforting hand on his brother's shoulder, Bill pondered, "Wait a second …" Inspecting the whimpering Auror, the curse-breaker inquired sharply after a few moments, "Harry, where is the rune of deflection?"
"People might get ideas," Ron gave cause for concern.
"Slightly."
"Right now, my hands are tied."
Once they were more or less finished, the witch wanted to know, "By the way, will Lucius be back at the office tomorrow? I missed him today."
The raven-haired, however, met his gaze stoically, emphasising. "Now, please."
Trading a helpless look with her husband, who seemed as conflicted as her, the witch only continued after an encouraging nod from Harry. "Please, Hermione, if you have any ideas, tell us! We really are at the end of our tether."
Apparently able to read his patient's face, Harry chuckled. "Yes, … I know, stupid! But we had no chance of knowing that you've already made one. You really should consider labelling your potions, Sir. Anyway, long story short, we needed more than four years to finally find someone who had even the remotest chance of helping you. But once we have enlisted his help, he needed but a few short months to brew the antidote."
Shrugging defeated, Harry replied, "Yes, I absolutely realise that. Kreacher is a little bastard who lives to annoy me." He counted it as a win when the hint of a smile lit up her face.
Even Neville! Traitor!
"Is father gone?" Draco asked from the doorway after Severus had finally settled with some biscuits and a fresh cup of Earl Grey.
Pulling the boy into her arms, the Lady barely noticed Andromeda ushering everyone out. Gracefully, she sank to the floor, relaxing against the now mended carpet, holding Harry tight when he sobbed in her arms. Narcissa could not understand the babbling that was occasionally interrupted by hiccups. Yet she thought to recognise names like 'Sirius', 'Dumbledore', 'Snape' and 'mum and dad'. He talked about a cursed tree at Hogwarts and Peter Pettigrew; about prophecies and the grim, magic stones and trice damned stubborn house-elves. After a long while, Harry had slowly started to wind down and only breathed wetly on occasion, the air around them began to thicken again, seeping into Harry who got very still in her arms. Then, all of a sudden, every last snake embellishment, the Black family had seemed so fond of, reared its head and hissed.
Seeker reflexes helped him to catch the sleeper's hand when they took a swing at him with a barely suppressed shout. "Calm down, it's me, Harry."
It was strange … for both of them. And tough Snape was aware that Longbottom could betray him to the authorities, he was now convinced that the young Auror had no such intentions. After a few more minutes, where they polished off the biscuits, Neville rose and straightened his robe. "Now I have to go. Luna is expecting me for dinner."
"No, the green one," Draco corrected, clasping his hands in front of his body as to not fidget. "The white one is an antibiotic."
Only when the creature was out of sight, did Harry let go of his wards and turned towards the masses again. He took a breath or two to centre himself before searching for Dolohov's former mistress. A malicious fire was burning in Lady Blackwood's eyes. However, the young Auror would not let himself be goaded. Were that the case, he would not have made it through second year's potion class. He merely met her eyes and allowed himself the tiniest smile as she departed. Seconds later, he was swarmed by reporters. This time, he was very well prepared. Neville - and Robarts - had given him the run-down of the message the Auror Department wanted to express.
"Post-Traumatic-Stress-Disorder."
Gently, he shuffled the patient’s socked feet to the side, making room on the bottom of the bed. In the beginning, the man’s feet had been bare, his body only clad in black pyjamas, because – let’s be reasonable – no other colour would suffice. Yet on a particularly cold winter-day, Harry had noticed his feet to be ice-cold. Horrified, the young wizard had instantly bought a dozen soft wool socks, all black of course. Having lived most of his childhood with cold feet, because Dudley’s old shoes and Uncle Vernon’s hand-me-down socks had done little to keep them warm, he had not been able to stomach the idea of his patient being so neglected.
"Great, thanks for the compliment. It's not as if my wards aren't vain enough already. But back to business, tell me what in Merlin's name is wrong with them?!"
And suddenly Harry's face lit up. "But that's not what we want. Only what we do to achieve it!"
"Draca … that's old English for dragon."
Putting a comforting hand on Draco's knee, Harry reminded him, "Draco, … Hermione, Ron and I have worked on this for the last three years and have never gotten anywhere. Don't be too bothered about not succeeding after two mere days."
And, as if it was the most natural thing to do, the redheaded witch turned around and pulled Narcissa close as well. Not used to such tactile affection, the white-haired witch stiffed for a moment, before she returned the gesture tentatively. "Thank you," she whispered, and Molly replied equally quiet, "You are welcome. Don't worry, whatever this next year might bring, you are not alone anymore."
Tilting his head once more in gratitude, Lucius stepped back from Arthur before joining his liege. He managed to catch his son's confused question. "How should we hunt? The Weasleys don't have horses."
Once the door was closed, Kreacher got up from the floor hesitantly. “This room mustn’t be cleaned. Kreacher promised to obey. But Mistress has to be obeyed as well. Kreacher is going to iron his ears now, Sir. He … he is sorry.”
"I have learned to see the man you have become instead of a mirror image of your father I expected you to be."
"Oh, hey, Harry!" Charlie looked up after having finished his last charm to make the cage indestructible. "I'm sorry for having been so short with you, in the morning. But little Inari here ate very little since Yule. I was fresh out of ideas, and since she seemed to like Draco, I hoped that he could convince her."
Looking at the stars, his former professor pondered, "Around 1 a.m. I would say."
Knowing when he was beaten, Harry ate the last of his breakfast, before allowing Draco to help him to the office. After Ron had cleaned up the kitchen and forced the required potions down the raven-haired's throat, he sorted out Harry's desk and settled down with tea and a mountain of paperwork he produced from an innocent looking carrier bag. Undoubtedly Hermione's undetectable expansion charm at work.
Emerald eyes met silver-grey orbs that were filled with desperation. The young man noticed that the blond was trembling nearly imperceptibly, very much like the last time Harry had seen Malfoy in the great hall, after the battle. Fear was prominent in the young man's tone when words were spoken, the chosen one had never, ever imagined hearing from his former rival. “Please, help me.”
Shaking his head, the Potion Master emphasised, "My godson is a grown man who is perfectly capable of deciding if he wants food or not. Your cooking skills are not at fault, Kreacher."
"What an idiot!" Hermione remarked, before taking off her robe and hovering it towards the wardrobe. "Alright, let's see what we've got."
Irritated, the young wizard followed, but only managed to catch up at the bottom of the stairs. Harry reached for the pillow−case Kreacher wore and demanded, "I'm not in the mood for games. Either tell me what is wrong or sod off!"
With a sigh, Harry rubbed the bridge of his nose. "Kreacher?"
****************************************************************************************************
"It's Draco, isn't it?"
The Chief Warlock cast the spell to bind them together, and while Harry felt a little tingling, the way his vassal trembled under his fingers, pulse going erratic indicated that it was far from painless for him. Using his wand to tip up Lucius’ face, he saw the agony, fear and despondency in his eyes.
"Mr Potter?"
He could not see it. At night, his sleep was disturbed by nightmares. Of Voldemort killing him. Him seeing Death Eaters torturing innocent muggleborns. Being forced to watch Charity Burbage being murdered before his very eyes. But those were not even the most agonising memories that plagued him.
When they served her - Harry had even added a linen napkin to her place setting - the witch commented absent-minded, "My, my, don't you have your boy well trained."
"This is the second time you got injured this season," Ginny berated, supporting Harry to take the potions Draco had provided, before helping him undress to take a bath with herbal remedies that ought to soothe his body so he could sleep. "And it's the beginning of February!"
Suppressing a smile, since Harry was still hovering at the head of the table, like a scolded school-boy, Kingsley took Narcissa's hand and hinted a kiss. "The pleasure is all mine, Lady Malfoy." After greeting a much more reserved Lucius, he returned to his breakfast. After the second cup of coffee, he had to admit that he developed a liking for the spiced beverage.
But Harry merely shrugged, serving the rest of the breakfast. "It's not as if I can't afford it. And it's never more than one dish at a time she experiments on."
Smiling at their friend, Hermione nodded, "
That left the question of who had drawn his godson's ire and why. It had to be someone important if Draco was pondering hard to detect poisons.
Ignorant of his audience, Harry threw the elf through the door. “Stop lying to me! You never respected me! I have told you specifically to leave Walburga’s salon alone! She can have it back when I’ve managed to add Sirius to the family again, not one bloody minute earlier!” Kicking open the door that had tried to fall shut, he continued his rant, “You even put bees-wax on the fucking furniture! This place looks as good as new!”
"You are avoiding the question."
"Potter."
Confused, the young wizard inquired, "Why? I trusted Ginny, and she trusted me."
Lucius Malfoy was guiding Hermione Weasley. He cut an impressive figure in the high-collared, midnight-blue robes Theodore Nott had designed for him. The former Lord had forgone all embellishments save the heavy chain around his throat and the walking stick his liege had gifted him, the day of the Lostrife-trial.
“… idiots, the lot of them.” Relieved that his friend had relaxed, Harry mirrored his smile.
"Harry Potter!" The young wizard finally forced out.
He squeezed Hermione's hand. "Ready!"
"True," Harry conceded with a smile. "Arthur and Molly are but loving parents who had it rough all their lives and had little but morals and their devotion to their family. No matter how you look at it, they
"With mum's eyes, I know." Harry wanted to reach out but was afraid to wake the portrait. It was the only tangible connection he had to his family.
"No," the raven-haired shook his head, leaning over to catch his breath.
Have a great November. If you are participating in NaNoWriMo, I wish you the best of luck.
When the pureblood pointed out, that her 'fixtures' were the least of his worries, right now, she cut him off, commanding, "Sit!"
So now, Lucius was looking forward to spending a weekend with his radiant wife. Maybe even entice her to accompany him on a walk through their gardens and a picknick by the little lake his mother had loved. Just the two of them, away from prying eyes with but their slowly recovering white peacocks for company. The birds had been smart enough to flee when Voldemort had taken refuge at Malfoy Manor and - according to Narcissa - had only returned two years after the war - with some blue and green streaks in their feathers, it seemed that they had not bred only amongst themselves. However, for a carefree picknick to happen, he and Mrs Granger had to get through one last interview today. A muggleborn, associated with the Children of Hecate was in for questioning. Lucius did not have a lot of hope to gain new insight, but was determined to be as thorough as possible and exhaust all venues. After all, this group had harmed his liege!
