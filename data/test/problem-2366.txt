Also – trying to be honest here – I find myself much more motivated when I can do something for you rather than myself. Please don’t read too much into this. But the determination and professionalism you marvelled at when we went into the Room together for Occlumency? You were right on the wand in thinking that I wanted to teach you without any second thoughts. I know that you can master any magic there is. And if I can help you with that, I’d do anything to make it happen. Anything.
“When I realised that I couldn’t bear to have a day pass where I didn’t write in our diaries,” I answered, “and when time spent away from Draco felt wasted. That’s when I knew that we were right for each other.” I paused, wanting to get it right. “I knew when I realised that the pair of us were more, were better, when we were together.”
It took only a few minutes before we were at your bedside. The shock of the familiar was so powerful, Draco, love; despite it being in shades of green and silver, the look and sensation of being with you there, in a school dorm room felt very safe. You laughed, my darling, a small lustrous sound, as I hopped clumsily and pulled off my trainers.
I promise you, there isn’t a catch. Good or bad, these letters are exactly who I am. I’ve always kept my emotions close to the surface – it got me in trouble a lot in my younger years – and I never could resist wading in, my big feet first, always getting half the facts wrong. You wouldn’t have liked me very much. When I was younger, I could be a rather rash, hotheaded, young man and it got me a fair number of detentions along the way.
You surely know what happened then. He hummed and hawed and in the end told me to come and see him during office hours in a fortnight. He’s putting together some information about the legal boundaries – which potions one can brew and sell for a profit without breaking one or the other regulation, how and where to register such a business, the hygiene and safety requirements for the laboratory, and so on and so on.
The arsehole didn’t give me a chance to reply. Having fired his parting shot, Robards walked out of the door, slamming it behind him.
You were late to breakfast this morning. So I thought I’d prepare a few bagels for you which later proved to have been a splendid idea, given that you later devoured them like a starved hippogriff.
Money is important, but it won’t define us, Draco. I won’t let it. It won’t control us like it did your parents. Instead, we'll make it work for us. Remember when I told you about the Ministry awarding me all those Galleons after I completed the third Triwizard task?
I love that you look after me, Draco, and that you’ve made it alright not to have to be in control all of the time. Your care is like a warm jumper, supporting me and hiding me from the cold; you envelop me. Even when your actions are as simple as buttering my toast, or re-knotting my tie, I’m still infused with wonder. I can’t believe that somebody like you exists, and that you love me. So never change. You were the change in my life that’s made me fulfilled, the change that I didn’t even know that I needed.
Of course, my beloved, you were absolutely correct. Having met Narcissa only two days before I soon saw the similarities that you’d been talking about. Andi always dressed neatly, and held herself stiffly, and her words were always judiciously well chosen. I’d thought there were fragments of the witch that were unique to her alone, but I soon saw that they might be familiar to you.
“Thank Salazar,” Narcissa replied, dropping my hand. “Then I’ll tell you about France, though perhaps you might be dismayed by what you hear. Please bear in mind that I believed I had no choice in my actions, and Draco knew nothing of them.” At that, Narcissa slipped an understated gold ring from her index finger and placed it on the scratched wood of the table between us.
Still, whether Narcissa did for legitimate, patriotic reasons – or whether she did it to save her own skin – the result is the same. Your Mother is home, safe in Whitby with Glynnis and dangerous artefacts are off the streets at the very least. Personally, I don’t care. All that matters to me is your mental health, and that somebody whom you love is as free as their probation allows them to be.
Now I’ve thoroughly upended your Muggle Studies lesson, I’ll leave you be.
I’ve been thinking about you today, mon amour. That’s nothing new, really. But I’ve been thinking about your reply, of course, and about these gruesome memories that you so bravely shared with me.
A lot to take in, I reckon!
Robards looked like they might have lost his temper then, but then Atkinson and Waters returned to the room. “There’s nothing,” Waters said. “No Dark magic traces or evidence of much magical activity at all. Potter’s and Malfoy’s were the only magical signatures that we could track, other than the aged house-elf, who was a very unpleasant and rude specimen of a servant! Told us that the ‘Masters of Grimmauld Place scarcely had time for the old ways, as preoccupied as they were.’ I’d half a mind to take him into custody. He threatened to hex me!”
Circe, I can’t imagine Hermione as a Slytherin. But I see how we would have won more House Cups with her.
Then I thought of the seedling cupboard at the back of the Greenhouses? Plants… wood? Is that too much of a reach? Did you wank off surrounded by plant pots, literally fertilising the earth with your seed? Love, sorry. That’s an awful joke. Forgive me. I’m laughing hard and hoping you find me as funny as I hope I am.
“Draco,” I said, taking your mug from your trembling hand, and placing it carefully on the table. I took your hand in mine. “Talk to me love, please. Tell me if there’s anything I can do.”
All kidding aside. How does the ring feel so far, love? Have you cast something with it yet? But tell me all about it. Is it soothing? Does it feel like it would restrict your magic? Don’t listen to Mother about you being ignorant. She has no idea how very un-magical your upbringing really was, Harry.
This is what I reckon, Draco.
It was the only place that I could think of where we’d have some privacy. I needed a few minutes to get my thoughts organised, and into some kind of order. I’m fuming, I’m absolutely fucking fuming and I’m not even sure that I’m that safe to be around other wix at the moment. Ugh, my bloody magic. I can feel it pulsating and fizzing in my blood and across my skin. Even now this bloody quill is vibrating, and-
I know that is a thing, isn’t it, within Sacred Twenty-Eight families like your own? Having meticulous ancestry records and beautifully rendered family trees? Actually, there is one on the wall of my house, though, it’s going to need every bit of your charm work to get it looking beautiful once again, my darling. It’s very damaged, but I’d love to get it fixed as a tribute to my benefactor.
Narcissa does love you; I don’t believe for a moment that she wouldn’t have seen the happiness spread all across your face when I kissed you at the awards ceremony.
Harry would know, he remembered everything as if it were yesterday.
The room in which he stood was lit bright , if possible too bright infact it must be the only room in the entire place that was this heavily lit. All 5 of his trainers stood looking at him silently.
“Yes, and how’s that been going? Has prejudice against Muggleborns been decreasing, or just bubbling under the surface?”
"C'mere, I wan' tell you something." The words were out of Harry's mouth before he knew it, but he didn't regret them.
Kudos and comments make my heart sing!
For the microfic prompt: "cinderella"
Harry could've turned and walked away. He could've looked away from Malfoy's knowing gaze and left the bar. He could go back to his Audi and drive to
Lying in bed that evening, Harry remembered the image of Malfoy at the Black Lake with his head tipped back in the sunlight. He thought of the rare smile Malfoy'd had when he held his wand for the first time after his trial, and the feeling that had bubbled up in his own chest at the sight.
Prompt: a proposal
They called her Loony. They called her a nutter. They called her batty and quirky and strange. She didn’t mind it, really, or take it too personally. But while she could understand not seeing the Blibbering Humdingers or the Umgubular Slashkilters or the Dabberblimps, how could they talk of reform and the future when it was clear to see that the world hadn’t changed?
“I dare.”
And he walks away.
Draco turned to face him for the first time, his face stretched in his most wicked grin.
Slowly, Draco forced himself to look at Harry, opening his eyes to let the other man see the tears beginning to well.
After the war, Hermione asks him and Ron to accompany her to the tattoo parlor. Ron's face is pale as he holds her hand, watches her grit her teeth as the tattoo artist draws over the skin.
When he thought about it, Draco couldn't believe he'd been willing to disrupt all of that after three silly dates with Harry sodding Potter. To think he'd ever considered himself important enough to the Savior to merit more than three dinner engagements and one rather fantastic shag.
“Draco!” Pansy hissed.
"Potter, what the fuck?"
MAJOR CONTENT WARNINGS FOR THIS CHAPTER: being buried alive, zombies/living dead kinda? dark Harry.
“Yes, now that you’re awake, you can go home. I’ll monitor you from there.”
This is how I like you best, asleep on the couch. You told me to be quiet, or there'd be consequences. You told me not to leave my room; to make my footsteps into the weightless movement of a ghost. But this is how I want to remember you: gentle and warm and unguarded.
"I should hope not. Now, c'mere and let me teach you the spell."
“I was thinking...We have a list of people who were members and their known whereabouts, but...do you think you might be able to help me figure out where the missing ones might be?”
Lovegood smiled thoughtfully at him. “I pick truth.”
“So, do you know this show?” Potter asked as the two of them settled into their seats. Draco had to admit, Ginevra had picked well. Row A of the center mezzanine offered a great view
Malfoy, who now wanted to join him.
“What is the meaning of this?” Parchment crinkles in his tight fist. With his other hand, he brings a lit cigarette to his lips, letting the smoke curl in the air; mother must be out of the house.
“Maybe,” Harry shrugged. “Trouble is, I don’t care. Now, will you be here for a while, or are you coming home with me?”
“Yes!” Harry threw up his hands in exasperation. “I’ve been trying to tell you that!”
I rush home, my errand forgotten, and all but collapse onto the couch as I breathe deeply, as my Mind Healer taught me. There are times when it feels as if my chest is being squeezed in a vise; my heart is shedding its skin as it's forged in a crucible, the present reckoning with the past. In these moments, I try to center myself. I find my body's equilibrium. I grasp for the middle I know rather than sit on the edge of insanity, of oblivion.
After a moment, he nodded. "Yeah, I do."
"But I didn't! And the case is over now."
"Er, no. I also don't like marshmallows or--"
"Well, I for one am going to celebrate being alive with a nice, long shower." Draco walked away, turning his head back at Harry. "Coming, Potter?"
"Why?"
“Thank you,” Luna sighed. “Anyway, my father’s killer mentioned being friends with Lucius, so I thought I could get more information if I came here. I wasn’t going to kill Draco’s father.”
Moonlight glittered on the East River, reflecting on the side of the buildings and the trees surrounding it. The streets were empty, free of tourists and locals and others who might draw Draco from his thoughts.
Also find me on Tumblr!
Harry flushed, both from embarrassment and indignation. "The war's over! You deserve the same chance as everyone else."
POTTER!"
Harry saw Malfoy leaning on the bathroom sink for support, thick tears falling from his eyes.
“I said Hap–”
Tell me what’s mine.
“No, you see, I tried for a bit before I realized that nothing warms my bed like a good cock in my arse.”
And Mother, please
"Yes."
"At least the Dark Lord won't kill my parents if I'm successful. I'm fairly certain your side doesn't care whether we live or die."
Draco raised his eyebrows. "Wh...why?"
Kudos and comments make my heart sing!
Now, Harry could almost hear it; but to him, it sounded like tears, hot and grieving sobs that flowed of their own accord.
But here, in my bedroom, on this parchment, I can daydream about you bursting through the front door, wand blazing. You'd storm through the living room, up the stairs, throw open my bedroom door and say, "Malfoy, you're a git, but you don't belong here. Come with me."
"So, er," Draco coughed. "What happens now?"
"Yes, I am angry--and the reason for that is obvious if you merely look around the room and see if you can identify what might be bothering me."
These two men used as toys
Voldemort, often, called him by his first and last name. "Harry Potter," he'd say in his soft, almost hissing voice. Because with Voldemort, he was neither Harry nor Potter--he was Harry Potter. He was the enemy. The target. The child who wouldn't die at his hand, no matter how many times he tried.
"Harry are you al-"
I must not forget my mission
Harry's eyes widened comically. "Aycoh?"
Based on the Taylor Swift cover of the famous song "September"
"Sorry."
Yes, I referred to him as Harry. Don't worry, we still call him Potter when he being a particularly annoying prat. But our relationship now lacks the violence to which you're accustomed.
Draco hung up and canceled the spell. He walked quickly to the Apparition point. While grief still ached in his chest, he still felt the warmth of hope and relief spread throughout his body. He picked up the pace, not wanting to waste another second away from Harry when he pictured a night of pasta, cuddling, and slow, wine-scented kisses on the couch.
Harry gulped the last of his firewhiskey, letting the burn run down his throat and trying to elongate the length of his neck as he swallowed. He nearly smirked at the feel of gray eyes following the movement, but he knew outward cockiness wasn't what he needed--what they both needed--tonight.
He opened the window and rolled his eyes. Really, he should've known.
"What's chemistry?"
His friends grew more and more concerned, Hermione's face becoming increasingly pinched with worry. Harry knew that thread would snap eventually, but he'd just flash her a smile to show her all was well.
“But what if I...“
A prompt I submitted for Drarry microfics! Dust and Ashes, from Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812.
“Yes, but I live in the moment, Potter. And in this moment, the fork has stopped grinding enough that I’m ready to talk, if you are.”
And there'd been some nights, during a thunderstorm, when she'd whimper and shake with fear, waking Harry with her wet nose and scared cries. He'd hold her and pet her through it, comforting her as she'd done for him in the first few years after the war when nightmares ruined his sleep.
The person's worried frown deepened. "Aren't you that Draco Malfoy kid?"
So, he shrugged. “Alright, why not?” Draco took a seat among the other students and summoned the firewhiskey bottle and a glass from the middle of the circle, pouring himself a drink. Hopefully, the firewhiskey would make him too sleepy to participate.
Harry nodded slowly. "Yes, some. But I'll be fine, you should--" he broke off when he saw Draco look around the room, the other man's eyes widening slightly in realization.
Draco waited for Potter to take a cocky sip of wine. Then he let a slow smirk, tinged with meaning, spread across his face.
Cori looked at the other two queens, who grinned and nodded in agreement. Then they turned to Draco and gave him a soft smile. "Sure thing kid. Stick around after the show and we'll try it out."
The other man raised his hands in surrender, his eyebrows reaching his hairline as he backed away, giving Malfoy an apologetic glance.
"He is. He also defected to the Order and became a spy."
Harry looked out the window at the night sky and wondered if happiness would be a constant thrum under his skin, or if it could be found in stolen moments tucked into his heart. The stars glittered in silent answer, shining with anticipation.
None of the people around him notice you; it's better, this way. She can have him during the day; she can rest her red hair on his shoulder and even take him to her flat for an afternoon delight, which is probably as kinky as she gets.
The best way I can give that to you is by not being part of it.
Draco folded the parchment and left it in the middle of his desk. He got up from his desk chair and climbed into bed, the unhealed paper cuts on his hands forgotten.
"Er, Draco?"
His love for you can't take that from me.
Harry didn’t bother to clamp down the scream that rose up in his throat at the blinding pain. The spell ended, and he fell to his knees, panting and ignoring the titters from the surrounding Death Eaters.
“No! You came to me, remember? You told me, ‘Potter, I can’t do this, I’m desperate, you can trust me!’ But I’ve seen you sneaking into the Room of Requirement, constantly taking books from the restricted section. You were lying then and you’re lying now.”
Pansy snorted, the traitor. “Oh, please, as if you didn’t initiate every game of Truth or Dare in the Slytherin common room.”
Draco nodded. "Your parents, I'm almost certain. Minerva confirmed it as your mother's magical signature."
“Oh, yeah. She went on and on about wanting to see
“That one’s true. I’m actually not an Auror.”
His twin stumbled as the light dissipated, taking off his glasses to rub them on his fresh robes before placing them back on his nose.
His own words—written on the parchment he'd sent off with his owl before he could stop himself—were burned into his memory. He still remembered the searing pain in his chest as he promised the love of his life that what they'd had could be forgotten. In breaking Harry's heart, and in shattering his own, his only consolation was knowing that Harry would be happy eventually; that Harry would move on and find someone with the freedom to love him the way he deserved, someone who could offer the intangible riches in which Draco had always been impoverished.
It’s similar to magic. Magic cannot be created, nor destroyed. It is, after all, a form of energy. You can destroy magical objects—you know that better than perhaps anyone—but the magic within cannot cease to exist.
"Mr. Potter, to what do we owe the pleasure?" Narcissa Malfoy looks a little older through the green flames of the Floo.
“Two days. You were hit with a rare curse that caused an ever-bleeding wound in your side, and the healers had to put you in a magically induced coma to reverse it.”
"Okay," Harry said, his back now to Draco as he looked in the refrigerator. "Now we let it cook for about ten minutes. In the meantime, we have to consider the sauce. We can do marinara, pesto, or just put parmesan on it, really. I like it best with just garlic and parmesan, but you--"
Draco narrowed his eyes. "What do you mean?"
You don't know if she's aware of her boyfriend's nocturnal activities. Maybe theirs is a relationship that can handle the honesty of daylight without getting burned, unlike yours.
It was a game between them; Draco's threat was empty and they both knew it. This push and pull, tease and resist, it was part of the dance they'd always done together, except now they knew the choreography by heart.
Harry’s easy, blinding grin was worth it. “Welcome home, Athena.”
Draco cringed as memories from the previous night came in flashes. Being stood up by his blind date and going to the Leaky to drink his sorrows away. Running into Potter, who'd met his half-hearted insults with mirthful, bright green eyes and easy grins. Being persuaded into joining Potter at his table in the corner. Talking the evening away, trading light banter and stolen glances and tentative, friendly touches. Having too many shots of firewhiskey and Potter offering to see him home safely.
“Right. Well, as fascinating as that is, Potter, was there something you needed? Because I’d really like to go now, otherwise.”
Ginny nodded, nudging Pansy with her arm until Pansy grunted her assent, glaring half-heartedly at Ginny, who smiled and pecked her on the cheek. Pansy blushed.
But it hadn't just been the intoxicating pleasure; no, Draco made Harry's blood rush and his heart quicken in moments that Harry'd nearly forgotten about the sharp canines that were hidden beneath those wryly smirking lips.
"I hate the way you talk
“Okay, Potter, but do try and keep up. This city moves quickly, you know.”
Weasley gave Draco one last glare before he let Potter steer him away from Draco, who widened his smirk in satisfaction before letting the mask fall away once he was alone again. He sighed, tilting his head back as he let his breathing match the rhythm of the waves.
What if Potter didn't remember what happened? What if he thought Draco took advantage? What if--
"Draco I'm sorry--"
"Potter?"
How could he, when Draco was next to him, talking animatedly, his smile almost as bright as his eyes? How could he move an inch when Draco's hand was clasping his arm, warm and sure and
"I'm an adult. And you're not my father or my boyfriend, so back off."
This fic is inspired by the entire album "reputation" by Taylor Swift
“What?”
Harry’s eyebrows furrowed. “Really, you don’t have anyone who you could talk to, get them to give us a name?”
Dread rushes through my body, prickling my skin. “What do you mean?”
He made it to the elevator in just enough time before it closed, smiling apologetically at the crowd of people packed inside. He tapped his leg nervously as he watched the floor numbers get higher and higher until finally the car reached the 15th floor.
I don't have much time. But I'm not sure if I'll have a chance to do this when most people do. I also have no idea if I'm doing this right. My only experience with this was with Dumbledore, and to be honest I didn't pay much attention to the wording.
harry stands, his own cock straining in his jeans. He unzips harry's fly and takes him out of his pants, jerking him off quickly, mechanically.
He finally reached the bar and caught the bartender's attention long enough to order a shot of whiskey. While he waited, he turned to survey the crowd.
"You lied there."
"Sure."
Before the Sorting ceremony, Draco stood with his friends--well, more accurately, the children of his parents' friends. But, as his parents had informed him, social and political alliances could last just as long as feuds, which could endure for generations; essentially, Father explained, the Malfoys had been aligned with the Parkinsons and the Goyles for as long as they'd hated the Weasleys, and that's how it would always be. Continuous, unending.
And no one says "Potter" quite like Draco, spitting it from his mouth like it tastes foul. Now, Draco only calls him "Potter" when he's frustrated with Harry, but it usually doesn't pack quite the same punch. Harry loves trying to see if he can rile him up enough to say his last name like he used to, shooting from his lips like a bullet.
“Goodbye Potter,” Draco said to the other boy’s retreating back.
“Draco, come join us!” Granger’s brown eyes were piercing, even all the way from across the room.
Then I saw a man with long, bright blonde hair standing in the middle of a nearly empty field in Romania.
"Draco?"
“I know that. What, are you scared?”
He wove his fingers back into Potter’s hair, this time moving from the front, and pressed their lips together. Potter adjusted quickly to the kiss, wrapping his arms around Draco’s neck.
Harry clenched his jaw, ignoring the worried expression on Hermione's face and the stormy one on Ron's, turning to Malfoy with a dark glare. "You bumped into me, and you know it."
“They do appointments by Floo all the time.”
Draco steadied himself, trying to grasp at the copper-colored scales for some sort of leverage. Potter chuckled, looking over his shoulder at Draco.
"Anyone would seem like a stumbling erumpent next to me,"
She nodded. “I’m training to be a professional stylist, after all, and if I can tame your hair, I can tackle anything. Besides, I’m good. Really good.”
Wasn't done, no not yet
"POTTER!"
After it felt like hours had passed and every tear had been drained from his eyes, Harry stood, cleaning the smeared blood from his skin and clothes. He knew he should call for help, but for the moment he felt himself walk to the cabinet, running his fingers along the smooth wood.
“Honestly, Potter, we might as well resume our game from last night if you’re going to pester me with these questions.”
Dear Journal
Harry's eyes fluttered shut, focused on the wet heat of the mouth around him. Malfoy explored his cock eagerly, running his tongue over the shaft and nearly up to the base before coming back down to tease the slit, coaxing out more precome and lapping it up.
He sighed
Prompts: road trip, first kiss
Harry shrugged. "We don't have a choice, do we? You don't have a license--and why would you? Besides, you're great at looking after Teddy in the car. This set-up works, and it's for one more day."
touched down on the ground, kicking up red dust. Landing the ship used to be Harry's least favorite part of flying; at first, his instinct had been to fight against the pull of gravity, but Captain Lupin had taught him the art of using the force to his advantage, a guide to a smooth landing.
You like the wind in your hair, but I don't like your attention off of me.
(See the end of the chapter for
Smiling, she reached into her pocket and activated the Portkey, closing her eyes against the twisting world around her.
Narcissa liked to let her eyes go unfocused as she gazed longingly at the fireplace. Her mind was numb, hands folded neatly and heavily in her lap. Sometimes, when Lucius was asleep in the chair next to hers, she would let her lips part mindlessly and her limbs relaxed, like an antique marionette.
That left her twenty-two days to learn how to kill a wolf.
Steeling himself, he approached it and opened it slowly, filled with relief at the sight of his mother through the cracks.
Harry didn’t think beyond getting up from his seat and striding toward the bar, quickening his pace when he saw Draco’s eyes widen in panic. He barely registered the look of horror on the stranger’s face when he grabbed the hand gripping Draco’s thigh and pinned the man face-down on the bar.
Weasley glared at him. “Shut up, Malfoy. We didn’t see you, or we wouldn’t have come any closer in case being a prat is contagious.”
Malfoy wasn't fazed. "It really shouldn't surprise you that your two best friends since childhood would be concerned for your wellbeing, even if it has been three years since you left them behind without so much as a note. They've been helping me with the investigation."
Good. A father should scare his son.
Harry snorted. "I've no doubt about that. Now, are we ready?"
This time, it seems Voldemort had left Harry's subconscious to its own horny, teenaged devices--and it apparently had a twisted sense of humor.
Harry’s jaw tightened. “That’s because we don’t kill suspects on sight. We bring them in for questioning or let the court determine their fate.”
6. He loves the American Muggle film “Young Frankenstein.” He insisted on showing it to me one afternoon, and he spent the whole time patiently answering my questions about the plot and the characters and if anyone else showed it to me I’d think it was obnoxious. But with him, I loved it.
"I'm an adult man, Potter."
"A picnic?" Harry smiled.
"One more question, Malfoy."
“After eighth year, the Ministry gave me a list of organizations I could choose from. All of them were in London, except for one, here in New York.
Harry startled, not noticing that Malfoy had come up next to him, sat on the stool at the bar and rested his elbows on the table, chin resting in his palms.
Promising a future when they can’t predict the next hour. Promising that it’s real, that they’re alive and can’t lose what the others can’t see.
"I can definitely see it," Claire added with a smile.
I’m the only guy to get this done
Harry nodded. “Sure, Malfoy.”
Harry pursed his lips. “Not if I don’t have to. But I would.”
"Good for you."
"Day after tomorrow. Why?"
A warm hand caught his wrist.
Potter tilted his head slightly in thought for a moment; then, he smiled, eyes twinkling.
Harry had the decency to look sheepish. "Sorry."
Harry scoffed. “You’ve no grounds to question me. I’m not the one plotting, Malfoy.”
Harry growled. "Not a prude, Malfoy."
Harry stepped off the ship and relished the way his boot left a footprint. He smirked as he surveyed the area: empty and ripe with potential. To the untrained eye, the planet would look like a wasteland. But the greatest kingdoms could be built from nothing but rubble. The Minister would be pleased; with some charmwork, this would make for a great expansion site.
Draco disappeared from their shared home in a swirl of green flames, knowing that Harry would follow them soon after.
Just then, the woman came back into the office holding a bundle wrapped in a blue blanket, Draco knew his heart would never be his own again.
Suddenly, startled at the abrupt sound of chattering students exiting classrooms, he exhaled, deflating himself. The raindrops were heavy against his eyelids as he opened them to cast a
"I followed your magic."
"Your fiancée found you unconscious in your flat. We completed a blood test and couldn't match the substance to anything we know—"
"Darling, we think it's possible we've caught Harry Potter, but we want to be certain it's him before we call the Dark Lord. Could you identify him if you saw him?"
Still, locals say Draco Malfoy's ghost still wanders up and down the beach, leaving a trail in the sand. Some people claim to hear him calling his lover's name, his shouts whispered in the wind.
I thought for once I might just try.
Draco exhaled, shaking his hands at his sides to release some of the nervous energy coursing through his body, his blood. Harry took his hands in his own, squeezing them gently.
His face looked back at him in the mirror; he saw the same familiar collection of features. His father's hair and face, and his mother's eyes; none of it his own.
Harry blinked rapidly to make sure that the sight of tears welling in Draco's eyes was, in fact, real and not another strange dream.
"Of running away. Of living like this."
Harry turned around to see Malfoy approaching him in the otherwise empty corridor. He nearly sighed. He was so relieved to finally have some space to himself without having to hide under his invisibility cloak. And here Malfoy was, albeit unknowingly, disrupting his respite from the pestering fans.
“There’s nothing left for me there. Father’s in Azkaban where he belongs, and Mother’s in the south of France.”
CW: Dark
She walked through the graveyard, slowly moving her wand in the air over each mound of dirt, hoping to pick on any possible remnants of her father’s magical signature. But as she reached the last grave in the final row, she noticed the wetness of her cheeks, the skin tender from her tears. She wiped her eyes with the back of her wrist, hopelessness sinking into her chest.
“ Why did you kill him?” Harry asked, his voice grave sounded impatient.
“ hahahaha..” a diabolical laughter hit his ears and he was on the battlefield. Voldemort grinned fiendishly as emerald light sparked again, Just before it struck him however he heard the monster speak “ I see it, hahaha, I see it!!” then his adversity’s scream quaked the grounds and Harry awoke with a start.
The sod was always a coward.
He had so many questions, even after them “identifying” themselves he was still skeptical but then he decided he would never trust them anyway, side effects of the war so he decided fuck all , if they were trying to kill him , he would soon find that out anyway, worst comes to worst he might be killed but hey harry wasn’t scared of dying , after all he had never thought he would make out of the war alive.
And his job now, was to torture and retrieve Draco’s motive.
“P-Potter…..”
Harry was standing in the shadows; he looked around and knew immediately where he was. Hogwarts. The boy’s washroom.
“ If you’ll please” Harry followed the man into a dark room with only a few spots of white light. There he saw a group of 5 persons , 2 were women and 3 were men. None moved to greet him.
“ No”
“ Why did we have to get such a softie to train?!” Brady sighed dramatically. “ This will be a long one…”
“ Draco Malfoy.”
“why not?” Now Harry was very concerned , his hand moved a few inches towards his wand nestled in a holster attached to his jeans.
So, he said no and thought whatever will be will be.
“ Why would  G.W.O INTEL be concerned about Draco Malfoy’s case?” He asked Stacy, The only woman member in his training team other than Mila.
Draco still remained quiet even though he looked visibly provoked.
Harry was changing as the programme proceeded . What was a tingle became a flame and Harry learned the side of the light was more of a grey hue.
He felt the flame of power and he needed it to stay ablaze. He’d become a sick person but he wasn’t
“ Harry your task remains unfinished. As of now you have failed to retrieve the necessary information.” Charlie uttered then ,putting an end to further inquiries. Charlie had been the quiet one of all five. Harry must’ve exchanged a mere 20 sentences with the tall, lanky bald man till now whose curly moustache stuck out like a sore thumb and whose cold, silent demeanor showed through his beady, blue eyes.
Harry gulped. He had thought that the programme would pacify his lust for power but now he felt puzzled. How was torturing Draco Malfoy supposed to help Harry become stronger at all? But he couldn’t turn back now and not after how arduously he had made it through the excruciating phase 1 which had elapsed 3 years. Completion of said task meant phase 2 , so if Draco was to be the first sacrificial lamb in his endeavor to inch closure to the power he desires , then so be it.
Tom had given him the case file and everything seemed perfectly aligned when he had read it. Draco had recited how he had done the deed and all the evidence recovered corresponded  perfectly with the testimonies of the jailors and his. Apparently his confession was obtained after torture and under the influence of truth serum. This process seemed a little iffy but later Draco had confessed, in court under oath and no torture that he had indeed done it. Though, when asked why he had done it, he had not replied, even under torture and truth serum. Draco’s mother was interrogated and appeared indifferent to his plans and crime.
“why torture him?” Harry asked, regaining his composure and feigning nonchalance.
Stacy gestured her right hand in the glass’s direction and he stepped towards it and after a weird sensation entered the opposite side.
“ Who are you people?” Harry asked, from their demeanor so far none seemed threatening but things could change for the worst in a moment , so he still had his horns raised.
He sighed and collapsed on his mattress again. He needed to get some sleep. Tomorrow he had to go back to Malfoy’s annoying ass again. Lord, why does this prick keep popping up in his life again and again. What a bother.
“ This will eliminate your reticence that stops you from making necessary decisions on duty.” Tom stated, his face covered in shadows ,he looked less like the agent of light and more of a hooded death eater.
Fuck, He had nothing planned. He had thought about what to do for days but had come up empty handed everytime. Now that he was here, he was like a blind man walking through the busy streets.
“ From what I read, you gave him such a cruel death. Hours and hours on you tortured him before slicing his jugular by using a severing charm, right Here” He drew the death wound with his first two fingers on his own neck as he looked at the fallen figure shrouded in darkness.
The thrill that intoxicated him as he killed one after another , as he spattered blood, guts, and as he finally terminated the most powerful wizard of the world had stupefied him. The exhilaration as he witnessed bodies collapsing one after another , as he stood at the bloodied mess of the one who shall not be named terrified him. He felt mighty, he felt powerful and he knew he had left the war with a sick mind.
“ We are a step above Aurors. We are members of G.W.O INTEL ( Global Wizarding Order intel). The global organization which handles cases far worse than Voldemort. We are not affiliated with any country and are an autonomous International body with 162 countries as member states. Your training was requested by your Ministry and after several meetings we have agreed to take you under.” Tom swayed his hands and everyone extended their right arms which glowed blindingly in a form of an intricately designed emblem.
War was over.
“ He hasn’t confessed to his motive. I have the entire case prepared. There’s something not sliding in place and potter I want you to find that out. That’s your task. It is important that you comprehend that sometimes your duty will compel you to torture those who you might’ve known and even loved and you must not fail, for you have duty towards the people of this world, the people who love you.” Tom said, looking straight in his eyes, unflinching and daunting.
“Oh how the mighty has fallen” Harry said, smirking.
“ He was tried and convicted for killing his father who was awaiting his trial and was under judicial custody.”
Harry instantly knew something was amiss. Draco stayed still and kept looking at him, his hand not even inching to withdraw the wand. Then, a breathe escaped the blonde and a lone tear trailed down his cheek giving way to countless more and he started to heave again.
Harry might’ve changed and for the worse but he would never become
The side of the light really was a grey hue.
Mila felt herself sighing as well. Harry may be a softie for now but she knew there was more to the boy hero. She had seen his eyes. His eyes weren’t of a softie that was for sure and she had experience. She had seen those eyes many times and they were usually on not so good people. The boy hero was not as saintly or pure as others often perceived him to be. There lay underneath something, something she knew was anything but pure and soft and waiting to come out.
“Whatever methods you can utilize at your disposal.” The other replied, his face a blank canvass gave off no emotions as usual.
kind then harry doesn’t mind the sickness he had developed since.
Draco’s only reply was a glare clearly wishing for his demise. Letting go of his chin Harry shoved him forcibly which lead the other falling on his ass to the hard ground.
“ He loved you that was very clear too. It was written all over his obnoxious face.”
All extended their left arms instantly and harry sighed, relieved. They were not
“ That is for Harry to prove.” Tom said, his steely, unemotional tone echoed in the Chamber room.
Harry went up a couple of stairs, “I promise.”
The Minister nodded, “I imagine you’ll have a lot to say, seems everyone has something to say about the Malfoys. Heck, I’ve heard from everyone including the muggle MP and the French Ministry about the
Ben blinked. “You really were a death eater? Really? Like marked as one?”
Then Malfoy saw them. He threw up a hand and the table destroyed itself, shredding to nothing before it hit.
“I think she said, a week? So, we could get our stuff together and arrive early.” Harry nudged Draco, “right?”
“Mandy that’s not a part of our group.” Murphy interceded.
Moments later the wardrobe door flew open, letting the boy out followed by three girls. Harry studied the size of the wardrobe, there was no way. Unless there was hidden space, he raised his eyebrows at Draco, who scoffed, but gifted him with a brief smile.
Ben didn’t seem to know how to react, looking between them. “Oh, come on, I just want to know. Mandy says no one can hold the crucio that long.”
Mandy chuckled. “Ok, they’re,”
“Sounds like it to me.” Harry barked back.
Murphy smiled at them, although they were late due to Draco’s hair, now in a long braid, because Harry had learned how to do one for Hermione. Well he could’ve moved faster but he really liked Draco’s hair and had taken his time. Harry gave the man a small apologetic smile. Draco didn’t bother, but quietly slipped into his seat next to Harry.
“It doesn’t look like anything I’ve seen before.” Tawy offered.
“I got it Violet.”
She smiled, “It’s okay. It isn’t rude when I insist, so go ahead.” Draco watched her as he picked the marker back up, as if it was a trick or a quiz. She nodded and smiled, encouraging him. “Have you ever used markers before?”
“Merlin, we aren’t symbols,” Harry pulled Draco from his seat, hugging him all the tighter, “We aren’t heroes. We were so scared all the time.”
a war.”
He shrugged with a dip of his head, “Yeah, well,” he glanced back towards the burrow and turned back towards them, “see you later?”
Harry listened to the buzz of the reporters. The American one specially seemed excited. Titles of any kind seemed to bring it out in them.
“Mandy might be able to help with that.”
matter, consorting with Tom Riddle aka Voldemort,”
As soon as the Malfoy party reached their table, Lucius leaned into their solicitor. The man quickly nodded and then looked to the judge. “Your Honor, we seem to be missing,”
Neville rolled his eyes, “What was?”
Harry wished he’d asked the Healer more questions.
Murphy frowned, “Ah, I’m afraid I didn’t think your decision though.”
A loud thunderous crack erupted from the room and Murphy took off.
“Because you’re a bloody fool,” A woman announced as she stalked into the room.
“Let’s see,” Tawy whispered to herself, mentally running over everything she’d spoken with the Headmistress about. “Your bands will be reprogramed, but you’ll continue to wear them, so I can monitor you,” Harry frowned and Draco looked up to her, “I’m sorry but it’s non-negotiable. It’s for your own safety. There are still war criminals loose and other fanatics running about.” She wasn’t budging on that one. “I’ll still be your guardian. I’ve already approved Hogsmeade trips and while you won’t be on any official school teams. I think there’s some opportunity to help out with coaching.”
“Done?” Harry asked, Malfoy nodded, and Harry tapped the tray 3 times. Malfoy stood and Harry followed, saying to his back. “I, ah, have nightmares, um, so if I wake you, yeah, sorry. Just uh, ignore me, if you can.”
“Don’t say, just an article congratulating Malfoy on the commencement of his title. I’m not calling him Your Grace that’s for bloody sure.” Mandy wasn’t sure what she felt about Malfoy and Potter. On one hand, it was fantastic to have actual celebrities in the place. Pretty exciting to look up and see the people everyone was talking about a couple of tables over. On the other hand, they were freaky as hell. They were so powerful even when they didn’t have a wand between them. And their lives were one extreme to the next. They just had no concept of normal. She couldn’t put up with snooty air titles on top of it.
“That uh stuff you said today, you know, in group, was that like real?”
It took her a couple of seconds to process before she was able to say, “So you and Malfoy?”
“No, nor will you add them. She believes the 8
Harry looked between to two bags, they both looked fine to him. “Um the darker one.”
decide to say it to someone else.” He looked up to her then and she bit her cheek in the attempt not to react to the raw pain and misery.
“My goodness, you are a beautiful child.”
“He what?” Harry asked, it wasn’t a question so much as pained disappointment.
Harry opened his bag, “the black trousers and dark purple shirt is for the club.”
After the war it became ‘fashionable’ to have been involved in the war effort. Most pretended their involvement had been more than hiding in their home and hoping Harry Potter took care of it.
“Helen, leave him alone.” Tawy turned with a bundle, which she waved towards the cot. The material flew to the bed and wrapped around it in a flurry of activity that left the cot made with tight corners and a soft looking blanket at the end. She turned back to the armoire, grabbing another bundle.
“Not sure about the first one either.” Draco added, to which Harry nodded.
Harry recognized the giant of a wizard who followed Malfoy with a spread hand so large it made Malfoy look even more delicate. Vos seemed ready to catch the scion at the first sign of faltering. The huge wizard didn’t have to wait long, mid-way towards the front of the courtroom Malfoy miss-stepped, it was a tiny movement, but the courtroom went wild with whispers. Vos eased His Grace’s footing with a soft hand.
“Bout damn time,” Ron growled.
Harry Potter and
“Which Malfoy?” Hermione picked the pickle off her plate and put it onto Ron’s as she spoke.
Now that made sense, except, “how?”
“Umm,” Rey started, but paused as their attention turned his way. He turned nearly as dark red as his hair, before he started again, “I know where there’s a knife, but I don’t know if,”
“That’s not what the papers say.” Rey said as Mandy searched the papers on the tables.
Harry chuckled, “Ain’t that the truth.”
“No, just recently.”
“Sirius Black,” Harry offered, he glanced at Draco, “and Severus Snape.” Harry saw the names sparked recognition and uneasiness.
Mandy stomped her foot. “They can’t just rip shields apart with their bare hands. They had to have something.”
“I heard the observation room is booked solid during wand time, staff even coming in from their day off.” Ella remarked.
It had to be the most legalized, lengthy, and well covered document Molly had ever run across. It was insanity. It practically gave those boys to Robertoun with no by your leave or recourse and it allowed no room for wiggle or for Harry to be released until the Healer allowed it. She glared above the parchment. “This is preposterous. The Ministry cannot just give children to this woman! This isn’t custody –it’s ownership papers!”
“The manor is under watch. If there was a portkey or dark arts, they would have been alerted.” Pansy reminded her, even if she wasn’t too sure about it herself. “I’ll leave it for Draco to decide and if he decides he doesn’t want it then I’ll hand it off to someone else and it’ll go back to the manor.”
Charlie looked for something to break up the strong emotion and latched onto, “Ron you need a haircut,” he chuckled, as he tossed his own hair, “only one Weasley brother can pull off long hair.”
Mandy snarled. “Don’t what? Don’t question why they’re here? They’ve got money and power and they’re sitting here! Why? One of them is the fucking savior! The other a fucking death eater! Why are they in here with us?”
Harry regarded Draco and shrugged, “I don’t know, it’s there.”
“I was hoping you’d ask. Minimal stress, I don’t want them concerned about anything more than a test. Their schedules, need to be lax,” Tawy smiled at Minerva’s look, “I’m not suggesting they not attend classes. I’m suggesting that there be an understanding of their delicate mental state. And most importantly, I want them to play.”
“Play?” Minerva asked, unsure what Tawy meant but willing.
Molly bristled, “What do you mean unnecessary?”
Draco scoffed. “I don’t think so and maybe you’re right.”
“Alright.” Draco offered. He wasn’t sure what to say, usually breaking something was followed by a lot of promises to be careful and getting far away. Tawy wasn’t moving though and Draco didn’t think she’d take it well if he left, so he was at a loss.
“That’s fine Mandy. Anyone else?” There was silence as everyone delayed and hemmed their attention around. Murphy sighed, “Okay, let’s talk about things that calm us down after something upsets us. Ella?” He nodded to the girl who had shyly raised her hand.
Madame Tonks raised an eyebrow, “you
Harry swallowed. “We didn’t know,” he was pale, “we just wanted to be free.”
The only things Teddy had ever purchased were a couple of trading cards, one for Harry Potter and one for Draco Malfoy (they were easy to hide). He had studied the cards but could see very little of his brothers in the images. Maybe it was the changed hair colors or the missing sunglasses, which his brothers always wore out. Though Teddy thought it was mostly because Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy looked sad and larger than life, while Sev and Siri were his happy and goofy brothers. From what Teddy figured, they had finished their last year of school before the idea of them had spread. Teddy was glad. Neither liked to read anything about themselves and now there were whole classes dedicated to figuring them out. After they'd graduated, they had taken to traveling and while Teddy missed them, he loved the weird stuff they sent him. They also showed up for every holiday and his birthday, which meant they’d be here by dinner.
“I can’t rampage through his thoughts no.” Draco replied, distracted as he made a list of everything they had to do before returning to Hogwarts.
George’s felt the rightness of his choice as Neville and those around him straightened with readiness. Even the Slytherins in their group looked ready to fight again and George was so fucking grateful. There were several things he had to hand over, but he thought he’d start with the most pressing and the reason he’d come at all instead of letting Ronnikins handle it, “Hermione’s been arrested.”
“The new charges will be dealt with after the original have been handled.” Judge Fumeurs announced while pulling a pile of pages to the forefront, “in the 1
“I wasn’t aware it was a contest.” Draco leaned back, looking bored with the whole thing.
Draco folded the letter and looked around. It was a muggle room in a muggle house. He could leave, there were no wards to stop him. He had his wand. He could
Draco nodded, “All right Potter,” Harry raised an eyebrow to which Draco rolled his, “fine Harry, I trust you.”
“We’re a lot tougher than we look.” Draco winked.
Ella nodded, “Right. Everyone knows you didn’t win it off him, but what no one understands is, how did you use it?”
Draco coolly looked the boy over.
Charlie looked around the room with wide eyes. He hadn’t been around much recently. There was a lot to do in a postwar Wizarding world, even for a man who worked with dragons. Last, he’d seen Ron had been fine, but mum had said as time went on, he’d gotten worse. Like it had taken time for it to catch up with Ron what exactly he’d been through. Charlie felt guilty for not being around more, for only showing up now to see Harry. He thought this might be the first time the family had been together for more than a month. Still he couldn’t believe the changes in Ron, he looked haunted.
“So, what? You’re in each other’s heads now?” Mandy shivered. She couldn’t imagine anyone would want that. She couldn’t believe they’d done such a thing on purpose.
Tawy agreed, “through as we continue, you’ll get more time with your wands. We’ll work up to everyday. I imagine the accidental magic would get quite serious with you two if we don’t allow you some way to expend it.”
She was breathing harshly, having obviously run from where ever she’d been. “Harry,” she immediately made to start down the stairs, but was stopped by another girl, who grabbed the back of her shirt.
“Are they treating you well?” Lucius asked.
Blaise shrugged. “But she doesn’t kill me or put me in harm's way. When she heard about ‘his’ return, she took me to France.”
Harry glance away from Draco and towards Mandy’s voice at the doorway.
Molly quickly reread, to make sure she hadn’t misread. There was no mention of the Ministries Child Well-Care department anywhere on the document. They were the only department that took custody of children or even had the right to do so, she’d thought. Instead Kingsley and Tawy Robertoun were listed as soul guardians. An additional cavort; which read in part, that due to their health, neither boy could be released into his own care nor anyone else’s until so deemed competent by Robertoun, regardless of age.
Andromeda Tonks listened to her solicitor and wished she could claim she was the least surprised, but she wasn’t. She could allow this, or she could fight and be fighting for not only Draco but Teddy as well. She eyed the contract guaranteeing her guardianship of Teddy. She didn’t have a bigger fight within her right now. She’d given Draco a chance, saved him from a certain criminal sentence. She couldn’t face even the idea of losing Teddy. She hated it and knew she’d feel guilty for years to come, but she signed the paper giving her Teddy and giving up any claim to Draco.
Draco opened his eyes to see Helen had moved closer, looking at him in concern. He jerked back from her nearness and stumbled into the bed. He yelped and threw himself away from both, breathing harshly when his back hit the wall.
“So you didn’t use some kind of object?” Mandy tried one more time.
Harry sighed and dropped his head, though he didn’t let Draco go. “My mom sacrificed her life for me in one big save. But after her no one loved me again until Hermione and Ron. No one stood between the monsters and me. Maybe your mum worked on little saves because she was afraid if she gave you a big save, she’d never be able to save you again.”
(See the end of the chapter for
She quickly agreed, “yes, of course. You’ll hang onto them like any other student.”
The privacy shield was broken, and it wasn’t actually apart of the group privacy so Mandy could demand answers. There were so many times she had wanted to leave group, stomp out and she couldn’t. She wanted to know how they’d done it. “I want to know. I want them to tell me.”
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Near about. We retain the right to tell you to shove off.”
“It’s
Harry knew enough from the muggle world to know that the truly rich, those, like the Malfoy’s, who could afford a firm like Wolfram & Hart would get away without losing much. Harry was sure all their other enterprises would see them through without really losing a thing but regaining some of their public image. It also didn’t hurt that the Malfoy’s were a very attractive couple. Harry figured most of the public
“And my parents?”
The walk started off awkward and silent until Ben hung back, letting Rey lead. Ben fidgeted for a few minutes before laughing nervously. “So ah yeah, Mary J 101.”
Healer Tawy nodded absently and turned her eyes towards the door at the soft knock. “Come.”
“Yeah, I know.” Harry interrupted, not making Draco say the name, which just the thought of had sent a tremor though Draco. “Why?”
Draco chuckled, “I love you too Scar-head.”
“Harry,”
“Merlin.” Tawy breathed, they hadn’t even had a chance to duck.
Murphy took the necklace and looked at the key with confusion, “why aren’t their wands in the vault?”
“A little longer? Try a day, lads.” Tawy huffed, dropping to sit on the bed, “how are you feeling?”
Harry didn’t know what to think of that. He was too far past it to be angry. Dumbledore was dead after all, but it still hurt that the old man had thought he might need such potions and yet had never spoken to him about it. It also didn’t bode well for Malfoy that he had needed the same.
Harry shrugged. That hadn’t been the first time he’d heard people say the same. Even he’d been surprised the ability had remained after Voldemort’s death.
“Alright then, why don’t you take a seat on the bed and we’ll get underway.” She gestured towards the bed, standing back and offering him space.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Well knock yourself out until I can find someone resembling a licensed hairdresser to cut it off.”
“Trust me, Malfoy-Draco, please?”
Hermione reacted to the question as she would any questions asked of her, with an answer. “Someone licensed by the ministry to oversee the ritual, a witness, ah I think that’s it.”
HPHPHP
Mandy scowled, “Shut-up Ella.”
Harry snorted, “must be.” He was sitting in the dark, shoulder to shoulder with the guy and they were going to need each other, “Call me Harry.”
“Who does that?”
“Alright. What about a dreamless sleep? Could you do that?”
Draco glanced to Harry and then steeled his features and looked across to the others. “Well what else? Get it out of your systems.”
“Wouldn’t we feel that? Know it?” Harry pressed.
The solicitors, four in total, stopped a few feet from the bench.
Murphy gave her a look that shut her mouth but didn’t stop her from huffing and crossing her arms. Murphy sighed as he looked away from her. “Does anyone have anything else they’d like to talk about? Last time we spoke of the unforgivables. Does anyone have anything they’d like to add to that?”
Harry shuddered, if it was bad learning with Snape, he couldn’t imagine learning with Bellatrix.
Muggle music was fantastic. Draco loved Queen and everything else he’d heard so far too. He wasn’t sure about tv, most of it was rubbish, but he liked movies. Not the ones with magic, through the other kids at the hospital had a lot of fun tearing them apart. So far Die Hard was a favorite as was Men in Black. He’d hated the Titanic movie though. Recent experience had taught him, something told to be un-anything, would certainly befall whatever it was meant to be safe against.
Hphphp
Mandy shrugged with a scowl. “Oh come on. We didn’t even say anything that bad. Everyone feared them, that’s a fact. It’s my turn, I wanna know how you broke that privacy shield?”
Shacklebolt’s face turned thunderous, his veins throbbing, tightly he bit off, “may I use the court’s floo Your Honor.”
Harry really appreciated her, only Ben and Clara followed them. Harry felt like he was pulling apart at the seams. The more he tried to pull it back the worse it became. Draco’s gritted teeth said the same.
Harry tried to run interference. Ron and Hermione followed his lead and didn’t attack Malfoy. He’d tried talking to his house, Ron and Hermione silent but standing beside him, however none of them took it seriously. The only person he’d seen actually trying to stop the abuse was Neville. While Ron and Hermione had been silence, Neville had spoken up, which Harry appreciated, even if it hadn’t really done anything to stop the rest of the school.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I spoke with Andromeda. She told me of the bond. Can you tell me about it?”
Mandy lifted her head from her new stash of magazines and looked at the other girl. “Why?”
Harry scowled and looked to Draco, who rolled his eyes.
Harry stepped back from her, “We’ve both made some shit decisions Malfoy and I, but we had less choice than any of you want to believe. I had as much of a choice to kill that bastard as Malfoy had to serve him, which was less than none. It’s easy to blame him, but unless you were in his shoes, fuck off. You have no idea what he
“Why?”
“Harry,”
“Why did you play the game if you didn’t like it?”
Tawy nodded. “Alright, I understand. Though I think the trauma group would be productive and you should go, maybe just to shock them?”
“Me either,” Mandy reassured her, she turned to Harry, who shrugged as Draco went to meet the host.
“Draco!” Narcissa gushed as she moved around the table, her arms outstretched. Draco accepted the tight hug but didn’t reciprocate more than leaning into her. His arm stretched back to hold onto Harry. Lucius moved slower but he reached them before Narcissa let go and Draco felt his hand grip his shoulder tightly. He was the first to move back and thankfully his parents allowed it. His mother seemed tearful as they went back to the table. Narcissa gestured them to towards the chairs, “please, sit.”
“I would hope not.” Draco scowled.
Ella’s eyes widened, while Mandy whispered something to Ben, he nodded and leaned forward as if they had the wand on them.
“Hey Clara, that was ours. I don’t have much left.” Mandy gripped but didn’t try to take it from Harry.
“What if it’s true? What if that’s the reason he’s so very hurt. What will we do Lucius?”
Ron nodded at his brother’s question, “Yeah, fine, Charlie.”
She nodded, understanding coming to her. She paused thoughtfully for a moment. “Small spaces. He doesn’t like them. Lemon, the smell, the taste, upsets him greatly.”
Harry grinned.
She nodded, “good, now what’s next?”
“Nice tattoo,” On such a pretty boy the tattoo of nasty looking skull and snake really stood out. Put a little bad-boy on an otherwise too pretty for words canvas. She reached out to take a closer look.
Mandy shook her head. “I know what Ron Wesley looks like. I’ll grab them when I see them. I’m not dancing, and I can see the door. It’s fine, go.”
Violet was stunned, she couldn’t imagine such a sweet boy would want to kill anyone. “Draco was a part of that?”
Draco shrugged “might as well.”
Draco grabbed Harry’s hand and pulled him close. “You’re equal?” and Harry looked so earnest as he nodded, he really meant it. He saw them as equals, loved him. Draco kissed him, “Maybe I can take care of myself, but Potter you’ll always be my hero.”
So consumed with this, he hadn’t even begun the hunt for an heir, another other piece of necessity.
Thank you for reading. Your thoughts are appreciated.
They had tea and cakes. Harry ate the cakes with the hand not occupied holding Draco’s. He didn’t mind Narcissa so much. She attempted to include him some in the conversation, but didn’t seem to mind his near silence. He may have glanced towards Lucius once and that was about all the Lucius he needed to see. Draco squeezed his hand and Harry knew he was attempting to reassure him and it worked. Draco’s feelings washed over him and Harry didn’t care nearly as much that Lucius sat across the table, only that Draco sat next to him.
Violet sat next to them, where an attendant had set them out of the way with bottled water. She watched with wide eyes. “Look at them, jumping to for him. That boy is something else.”
Harry looked away from her and then back to the room at large, “no one then, all right that’s just us.” Harry looked around and tried to catch the eyes of students who’d lost parents in the war and softly, kindly asked, “is there anyone here who wouldn’t do anything to save their parents?” He looked to Hermione last, the girl who had erased herself from her parent’s minds to save them.
“Besides,” Harry curled an arm around Draco, “we have each other now”.
Molly had been unsure about having this woman in her home, but when the meeting at the doorway finally broke apart and Ron smiled. A true smile, one that actually reached his eyes, which hadn’t happened in so very long. Molly found herself uncaring a wit about whether the woman or the whole ministry showed themselves.
Siri shook his head earnest and thoughtful, “It wasn’t a mistake.”
“Thanks?” Harry replied. Harry glanced over his shoulder in time to see Draco nod and tried not to smirk at seeing Draco at his ice prince best.
Lucius leaned back from the floo. Sadly, he had little power these days, it had taken more money and favors than he was used to giving out to gain the information. It had been worth it. At least now he knew what was to come of Draco.
As if he had a choice, he nodded, and she didn’t say anything else until they reached the apparition point. “St. Mungo’s, 9
Draco brushed his cheek with his fingertips. “You have no idea Potter.” He kissed where his fingers had been. “Yes, of course braid.”
“Hermione,” Ron rolled his eyes, “how do you even? Don’t give information to stuff we really don’t need answered.”
Draco frowned, most powerful wizards in generations, where had that nonsense come from? It might be true of Potter. Likely Draco’s own addition was the creation of an overzealous reporter. He glanced at Potter, who looked confused. Draco sighed. He wasn’t charging that hill.
Harry looked the chain over as well. “Up to you Draco. I’m not going to tell you not to trust Lucius, you know him better than I do.”
“Do you remember what they did?” Harry whispered.
“Your son, what things have you noticed that panic him?”
Harry grinned and nudged Draco, “duel me.”
“Harry.”
George’s eyes hardened. “Unless he starts something with you, leave that kid be. It’s over. Let’s not start another war or make another Voldemort. Merlin Ronnikins that Malfoy kid is related to Lucius, Bellatrix, the Carrows, and hell probably Greyback and ol’ Volde himself. We should count ourselves lucky he wasn’t outright Avada Kedavraing people over the breakfast table.” He felt like he’d aged a hundred years and just wanted to live and let live. Make the world Fred had died for a little lighter, a little happier, as Fred would’ve wanted. “If Harry does come back mates with him you accept it and back Harry. I will and you’ll look a right arse if you don’t.”
“I expect so,” Director Tips replied, though he looked nearly relieved along with his guilt.
Draco sighed, giving up on sleep, “I suppose we should.” He pushed up, cursing when his ring caught a strand of his hair.
He shrugged, “no choice. Had to take something. I don’t wanna go to Azkaban,” he blinked tearful, “I’m trying to be good.”
When Hermione finally paused for breath, Pansy exhaled, “I didn’t know you had it in you Granger.”
“He was Voldemort’s torturer, the papers all said so.”
“He doesn’t ask for shit, all he wanted was that arse, should of just,” Ron pushed against the door, which wouldn’t give. He hit it with his palm, “Fuck,” he recognized Harry’s door lock charm, “we’ll be here for at least ten minutes.”
The room’s atmosphere changed as the sound of hundreds of people taking their seats replaced the sounds of talking. Harry looked to the front as the Judges of the Grand Wizengamot entered the room. He noticed Ron’s parents closer to the front and pointed them out to Ron with a nudge and a discrete point.
Tawy folded the parchment while speaking, “it was his magic trying to heal him which stopped things from getting dire. As you know he has been documented by Hogwarts’ testing,”
Tawy pulled her wand, trying a quick shielding charm, but it was coming, and she wasn’t sure. “Get down.”
Harry reached over and tapped Draco’s hand, coming back to himself, Draco ceased. “He’s no more a death eater than I am.” Harry didn’t care about what anyone else said if it made Draco stop looking like that.
“Proud?” Harry blinked in shocked surprise. People didn’t say that to him. Well Remus and Sirius had, but really, they were it and it hurt to remember how good it felt to hear it.
Harry snorted. “I’ve explained it and he’s tougher than he looks. A little coughing won’t bother him.”
Tawy waited until after their evening snack and just before lights out. She found them in their room, sitting on their beds, looking miserable. “I hear you two have had a productive day.”
Harry, who was enthralled by the whole thing, heard Ron mumble, “Damn straight”.
Harry looked up at the ceiling of their room, hands under his head, already missing his wand. Though now he was mostly tired and worn out in a relaxed way, “I think we broke their room.” He glanced to the next bed, where Draco appeared lax and nearly dozing.
“Well aren’t you going to say anything?” She looked between them, tense and gearing up for a fight.
Harry had an uneasy feeling about this. He glanced over and could see how still Draco had gotten, tilted slightly in his seat towards his mother.
Harry rolled his eyes.
“I told you.” Rey supplied.
Harry glanced round and figured the 60’s by the faded yellow posters. “I have a friend with a talent for making small things much bigger than they appear.”
Harry felt his breathing halt just as his heart thudded loudly in his ears.
Harry came into a stark white room and stopped short.
Voldemort was dead.
Harry was just puzzled at this moment. He had no plans whatsoever of how he would accomplish this task and none of his trainers were even giving him hints. He was supposed to torture and retrieve the information in any way possible that much tom had hinted at and he was even allowed the use of rather
“ I thought you loved him. However he was, whatever he was, he always had your back.” Harry said, as he strolled casually around the fallen figure.
Draco then finally withdrew the wand and harry had his pointed at his nemesis in an instant. The blonde then moved his wand and slowly aimed at his own head. Harry’s eyes widened and before he could disarm the other he saw the wicked emerald light blind him.
“ Any more questions ?”
Harry said nothing and stood right in front of Draco. He could see all the muscles in Draco’s body tighten up through his pale white clothes and his adam’s apple bobbed as he gulped loudly. Slowly he touched Draco’s blindfold which caused the latter to jerk at first and undid it.
needed to be earned.
“ So you did one good thing, Malfoy coz if you hadn’t I surely would’ve.”
Harry already irked roughly grabbed his chin and looked straight into his eyes. “Answer” He commanded.
“ I still remember you always running to him to save your ass. Him buying you all you wanted and coddling your skinny ass to the moon.”
But the war and
He concentrated and felt his magic flow through his body and abruptly raised his hand slamming the skinny figure hard against the bricked wall of the dark room.
“ Torture is the most efficient technique to drive out vital information , you know that very well Mila.” Tom’s face hardened , his tone expressed no tolerance for any further arguments.
There stood behind the see through glass which seemed to be weirdly moving a lone figure in an extremely dark room with little to no light. And so, Harry couldn’t see the person very well but he knew immediately who it was.
Next Ministry wanted to keep him around. The war was over but everyone knew the world borne greater evils and voldemort may be one but there still were others, far more sinister. So the Hero had to stay and harry was delighted to oblige.
Harry felt that tingle awaken as he looked at the sorrowful and broken figure of Malfoy on the ground. It gave him a sick heady feeling , looking at the pompous , villainous death eater who had pestered him all his childhood years looking so miserable.
“ Anything else ?” Tom asked smirking if possible even more.
The light was too low for him was the first thing he registered.
had changed Harry for the worse.
He could hear him sob, heave as the sink flooded with tap water. Harry treaded carefully and saw him washing his face repeatedly.
Draco blinked his eyes a few times  and suddenly Harry saw them enlarge.
Harry was getting really annoyed now, he had no time to waste on this twat, he needed to pass phase 1 so that he could enter phase 2. Clearly verbal stings were not doing the bid, meaning he had to intimidate with a show of strength. Harry felt himself smirk unknowingly, the past 3 years of training had been utter hell but he had unquestionably become stronger. He couldn’t wait to see the ferret grovel and piss his pants when Harry showed his developed robustness.
“ We can’t tell you.” Tom said, his expression unchanged.
“ Your training will be supervised by us” The same stern looking man Harry had followed said, “ Oh and I’m Tom”
Malfoy looked stunned, his eyes widened as his mouth hung open.
The test had commenced.
“ who is it?” Harry asked, concealing his excitement.
Wandless magic, that had been his training in phase 1. He still had a long way to go though as he could only do it 2 times in a day for a few minutes but this should be enough to scare the heebie jeebies out of the twat.
“ Y-you said it yourself…….” Draco raised his head slowly, the fringes and shadows hid most of his face but harry could still make out a lone tear that slipped down the former’s cheek. “ You would’ve done the same…” his lips trembled ever so slightly and harry saw him pushing his fingernails painfully into his palm.
“ He didn’t murder his father…”
“ Mr Malfoy’s demeanor changed swiftly when confronted by Mr Potter. According to the Auror Diaries he would exhibit no emotions and give no replies when questioned. When tortured he would reiterate the entire crime but never confess his motive.” Charlie quipped , drawing all ears towards him as he sipped his daily 5
He was lying on his straw mattress placed at the concrete floor and his torso, neck, forehead was covered in sweat. He flung away the shredded sheet that was his blanket and stood from the ground.
Malfoy looked at him through the mirror and slowly turned around. He stood facing him then, unmoving.
Malfoy. Draco fucking Malfoy.
That tingle had persisted after the battle and he had distanced himself from everyone.  Ron , Hermoine had repeatedly tried to get in touch but the ministry wanted their hero paraded everywhere and so he consented to the torture to distract his sickening mind. It didn’t work.
“What?! But wasn’t he exonerated on all charges as Ron weasely and Hermione granger had testified for his innocence not to mention even Harry had written a sworn statement vouching for his innocence ?!” Mila spouted all the questions flooding Harry’s mind as if reading it .
Lastly , they wanted him to get if possible even stronger and so the Hero was enrolled in a special programme, especially crafted for him. The programme began and Harry was exposed to secrets, techniques, curses that even Voldemort hadn’t been able to find.
Sensing something amiss a woman with short black hair in a blunt cut stepped towards him and smiled as she extended her hand out.
Malfoy’s body answered for him , especially when Harry did the asking.
“ This is not Hogwarts Mr Potter. This programme is specifically designed to make you stronger so that you can battle enemies far more sinister and mighty than Voldemort. We fear you might try to run and we can’t permit that. So the location would remain undisclosed until the last day of the programme.” Tom stated, his expression still grim as he folded his arms against his chest.
“ you must have a lot of questions, Please feel free to ask us” she said.
“ Whatever works.” Tom replied.
Harry had sighed and retrieved to his “room” which was a cemented, grey compartment poorly lit with one hanging yellow bulb with no furniture and just a straw mattress in one corner.
His trainers had been surprised at his conclusion save for Tom , who was always ten steps ahead of everyone at grasping a situation.
Just as he had spelled the curse and the emerald light had blinded his sight , he thought he had seen a sinister grin from his adversity , moments before his cry had deafened the battle declaring the victor. Maybe Voldemort knew what Harry felt , maybe he saw his tingle, maybe he saw his evil refracted and very much still alive.
“ How do you know for sure?” Mila had asked , “ I just know” He had replied.
cup of coffee.
“ Is the boy really innocent?” Mila had been shocked at what had happened during Harry’s test. She had before Harry, interrogated Draco Malfoy to ensure that the other would stay obstinate and not break easily under intense interrogation and torture. A subject who would break easily would not test the hero. They needed for Harry to advance to the next stage fast to make sure his training stayed on schedule but his test must be difficult enough to challenge him. Efficiency trumped all.
“ Mr Potter, welcome” A short but burly and stern looking man greeted him.
This wasn’t how it had transpired.
Harry was bewildered. He had asked Brady, a red head and a jolly member of his training team why motive was even necessary to find. The crime was proved and the punishment rendered , so why stay hung up on motive? Brady had smiled and said “ It’s your task Harry, figure it out yourself.”
Now onto pressing matters ,Draco hadn’t murdered his father. How did he know? Just like how he knew back then what Malfoy had done.
What a bizarre nightmare.
“I don’t hate it though..” This made the other look at him. “ I don’t hate it all , the world without Lucius fuckin Malfoy. With that bastard buried the world is surely a much better place.”  Harry clearly hit a nerve as he saw the blonde’s jaw tighten and his shackled hands bawling into fists.
She would even go so far as to say that Draco did better than Potter at her interrogation. Potter had caved rather easily to her disappointment and she had even noticed something uncanny about the boy hero but she could not pin down specifically what it was.
“ What methods do I use?” He asked looking unblinkingly at tom.
“ Malfoy you’ve been an utter failure at everything. At being a good person, at being a revered wizard, at being brave ,at being a son and the only thing you’ve succeeded at is forever tarnishing the name of your pure blood, upper-class ,Aristocratic family of Malfoy.” He felt a thrill as he uttered those words.
“Why did you murder your father?” Harry asked bluntly and Draco’s eyes immediately hardened. He looked away tightening his lips implying his unwillingness to answer.
Draco smiled. "Breakfast sounds great."
But then Harry was at his side, rubbing comforting circles into Draco’s back and pulling him into strong, firm arms.
“Why are you here?” Draco cringed internally at the breathy quality to his voice.
I loved you in our youth
.....
Hermione chuckled. "No, Ron, I think they're just getting started."
Lovegood tilted her head. “Let’s see. I’d kill Filch, shag Slughorn, and marry Flitwick.”
It made Harry want to laugh; he wasn't sure if he should dismiss the theory that Draco had some clone of himself made for the sole purpose of attending these events and putting on a show of blissful, perfect domesticity while his real self scowled and sniped at Harry.
Draco froze, the mobile he held next to his ear nearly slipping from his fingers in surprise. He was jostled by the crowd in Diagon Alley passing around him where he was stopped in the middle of a busy walkway.
It’s gone too far, I can’t stop now
“Now that you mention it, your having a pet snake would not surprise me in the least. The way you asked questions of the server last night tells me you know your way around a kitchen. So that leaves the last statement as the most likely lie—which means…” Draco trailed off, his throat suddenly dry.
Malfoy, who didn't want him to die.
freedom."
Potter rubbed the back of his neck. “No? I mean Ginny sort of had it all planned out. I never looked at the map.”
Harry looked away. “Didn’t say that,” he mumbled. “Just got tired of it.”
It wasn't a smile; it was a grin.
Harry shook his head. “You lost that right. You said you were done! You said you weren’t taking the Mark, that you were leaving and going to Dumbledore. You’re not my friend; you’ve burned that bridge. You’re no longer Draco to me.”
He looked down to see Draco's soft smile. "Of course. Happy Birthday, Harry."
Potter’s blush returned to his cheeks with a vengeance. “Thanks, Luna,” he mumbled into his drink as he lifted it to his lips before taking a sip.
Draco held out his arms. “Up.”
"Friends? Is that what we are?" Draco's tone was dry, but his eyes held a flicker of anxiety.
, blink my hopeful eyes.
“Or it could be a case like the fake one with Bellatrix, where someone’s getting some kind of revenge against the others, maybe for not appreciating them? Was there anyone, in any of your memories from Voldemort, where someone was a punching bag?”
I’ll admit—you’ve managed to outsmart my former colleagues, not that many of them were very bright, to begin with. I was always the real brains of the operation, not that any of them listened to me.
“Your server will be right with you, but if you need anything, don’t hesitate.”
“Yes.”
“I think we said something wrong.” Harry said softly. Their friends looked upset and Harry couldn’t understand why unless it was something they said.
“You’re ridiculous,” But Draco bit back the smile as he said it, “Fine Potter, we’ll give them a show.” He pushed away from the wall.
“We’re here! We’re here!” Pansy Parkinson ran up to them. Blaise Zabini behind her, “sorry, sorry. Where’s Draco?”
“I think your accounts would say otherwise.” Blaise chimed in. She nudged him painfully.
“Oh, that’s awful. I think one could even argue the way he was raised was abusive.”
Tawy smiled. “Just let me know if something comes up, alright?”
“Close enough,” Harry joined him at the table and picked up a banana crisp.
“So, I’m yours?” Draco couldn't think of much else beyond Harry's claim over him.
The judge waved his wand and the collected the documents.
“Wow, you know they ask her all the time if she’s heard from you, she always says no.”
“Here.” Mandy threw a paper towards them.
Minerva nodded but felt compelled to add, “you would of course have unrestricted access to see them, whenever.”
The cabbie gave them a few wondering looks. Mandy leaned forward, “he’s been in a coma, forgot a lot.” The cabbie nodded as if that was normal and put his attention onto traffic.
Draco smiled sadly at him and then looked to her, “They documented my birth, going to school, and every other moment they could use to sell a story. They’ve called me a monster, a murder, and a torturer. Last week, they said my father used illegal potions on me and this week they say my uncle raped me. They take every moment of my life and broadcast it. I knew they’d have this sooner or later.”
“I think you’ll both be just fine gentlemen,” She stood. She wanted to give them time to talk as she was sure there was an iceberg of emotions they didn’t feel they could show her. “The practice room is open if either of you have need, anytime.” She turned back towards them, “Also I can try to keep this out of here.” She patted her pocket where the paper was.
“Okay then, let’s try this," he paced the table, stepping over the mashed potatoes, "who here has learned Occlumency by being mind-raped by Snape and Bellatrix until you can stop them? Having to work 24 hours a day to keep Dumbledore and Voldemort out of your head, because they try to sneak into every single fucking thought you have.” He rubbed the side of head, “they’re all dead and my head still hurts,” he chuckled. He looked around at the horrified faces, some shaking their heads and looking to their friends. “Oh come on, that can’t be just me and Malfoy again, can it?” He looked around but no raised a hand or even met his eyes, “Well just us again then.”
Tawy sighed, “Very much so.”
“The hell you say.” He kicked it harder. “How? Potter.”
Mandy curled her lip, “near about.”
She nodded, afraid to even break his attention.
Harry nodded to Draco, “Huh, that’s interesting, thanks.”
Affronted, Molly huffed, “What, we’d do no harm to the child. Just show him some kindness. That woman! Merlin’s beard, she burns me up. Not allowed to visit the only decent home he’s known. It’s an outrage!”
Tawy nodded, “alright. Did you talk about last night?
Mandy leaned back with a smile that lit up her face. “Violet, I’m so glad to see you.”
before you spend the rest of your career handing out broom tickets.”
“I think I’ll be the judge of that.” The Healer said and while her Scottish burr was soft and even, Draco knew he’d see nothing but contempt on her face. He forced himself to look anyway. He’d have to get used to it. After all it was how everyone looked at them now. Except the dark glares she’d been throwing around melted off her face when she met his gaze and into something softer which was even more disturbing. He quickly looked away.
Tawy tapped her chair and it moved to the front of the couch. “I promise it is not nearly as horrible as you seem to imagine. How about this, what if,” she waved her wand and held out her hand as a basket flew into her grasp. “How about if you both stay in here? You can take turns under a privacy bubble with me and then we switch. Can we try that? I even have something fun I think you’ll like to work on.” She pulled out two tiny little pads, which grew to huge sizes when she tapped them and then two boxes she enlarged as well.
“If you say so Draco. I just think they should pay.” Pansy wasn’t used to a Draco that didn’t want payback but, as he smiled towards Potter, she thought maybe he had other things on his mind.
“No, he couldn’t have known,” someone exclaimed and several variances of the same rose around the room.
“You aren’t going to pilfer through more of his memories, are you?” Lucius moved closer to them.
Mandy looked between them, looking for something. “Oh, like you’ve been through so much worse, huh?”
HDHDHD
“With their hands! Tawy bare hands! They tore it open, like a door. I don’t even understand how they did it.” Healer Kelly was obviously distressed.
“Draco then,” her smile warmed, “in return call me Molly. Please everyone,” she turned toward the living room with a wide wave, “come in.”
Harry narrowed his eyes, “they did nothing but use us.”
They whispered, hidden in a muggle bed, buffered by soft blankets. Someone understood and between them, a closeness formed, they became a knot that would never untangle again.
The Healer, now at the open armoire, turned towards him with surprise. “Never, not even when you were small? That can’t be right, are you sure?”
Draco turned his hand and griped Harry’s. He felt something, a shock, something falling into place. Draco wasn’t sure what it was, but whatever it was, it tied him closer to Harry and that was alright.
Harry looked away from the window. “I bet she is. I trust her.”
“Can’t say I blame them.” Ella added, “but still,” she glanced to Mandy.
She nodded.
“Then who the fuck,” the boy flipped over aggressively on his bed. Ben waved a hand towards them. Harry smiled and waved. Draco raised an eyebrow. The boy swallowed. “No fucking way, I mean,” he jumped up, “yeah, yeah, hold on then.” He ran to his wardrobe, opened it and climbed in, closing the door behind himself.
Rey swallowed, “you really were hit with the Avada Kedavra?”
“Add Gringotts,” Harry tapped the parchment, and leaned back, he paused before taking up Draco’s hair again to look at Mandy, “the most we can do is send a message to each other, it’s not really words though.” He scratched his head, “I mean, it’s just, I don’t know how to explain it.”
Draco raised an eyebrow. Harry ignored her and looked between them, “who?”
Once out their room it became a question of where to find Mandy.
“Me too,” Hermione answered. Ron’s mouth was too full for his reply to be really made out, but the other two gathered it was an agreement of the same.
Draco blinked back his pain enough to look to Harry, who had a tight grip on him. He recognized Harry’s pain, understood the fury in his eyes, but it wasn’t until Harry’s eyes widened, did he realize the trouble they were in.
“What does that mean?” Draco asked, “My parents,”
Draco felt his mother at his side and leaned her way as he glanced at the Healer’s face. She was giving him that look again, and it was uncomfortable. He would have understood distain. He didn’t know what to do with whatever this was. He looked to his side and saw his father’s slight nod. His mother brushed the hair from his face. “And you will return him here when you have completed your exam?”
Tawy set her tea aside and grasped his hand. “Don’t try, you can’t, no one can, but we can listen and we can help. They’re never had adults that acted like it. Never had adults they could trust to help them. We need to show them that we’re worthy of trust. It’s going to take time.”
Tawy nodded. “Fine. Alright fine. Mandy go ahead, they’ll meet you at the muggle entrance.”
Harry flopped down on the beanbag. “Like this.”
They looked confused. Teddy took pity and pulled the cards from his back pocket. “You look better than you did on these. He handed Harry the Harry card and Draco his. They looked for a moment then switched cards.
Draco scowled. “Potter one of these times you’re going to realize you can’t always save me.”
Shacklebolt leaned towards an Auror, whispered a few words and the man took off for the court’s floo. Not even 5 minutes later, the man was back with a small older man, who Shacklebolt introduced with a wave of his hand. “Director Tips, head of the Child Well-Care department.” He turned to the man, who was running nervous fingers through what little hair he had. “We would like to discuss the Malfoy boy, Director Tips.”
“Do your best,” She smiled. She waited a few moments, commented on what they were drawing, before moving onto the next topic, “I think we should talk about last night.”
Harry shrugged. “He’ll get mine. He’ll do better than I would.”
Harry chuckled.
Mandy scowled. Ella glanced at her with ire before looking to him. “We thought of something, the magazines said, um, you said, he gave you,” her eyes quickly darted towards Draco, “his wand,” and Harry chuckled again.
“Damn straight I am.”
Ron looked at her with panic but sighed and didn’t say anything about being left alone with the Slytherin trio.
“About two hours ago now.”
“Good Afternoon Gentlemen, I’m Healer Kelly. I’m really glad you’re both here.”
“Me too.” Ron announced.
Ron leaned across Harry to Hermione. “Did you know he was a Marquis? That’s the same as a British Marquess right?” Ron mangled the French words so badly that even Harry flinched.
“Yeah, see I worked it all out with Tawy. Those of us with guardians get out once a month to spend the weekend with them. I asked my sister and she said it was ok. She, my sister, she’s a muggle right and she doesn’t even know who you guys are really. Once I got her permission, I worked on Tawy, she was against it, but she finally agreed to one night.”
“She might be able to see Draco!”
Hermione and Ron had a routine by now. They flagged Harry and quickly directed him to an apparition point. Harry didn’t even know where they were going until Ron whispered, “my house.”
She smiled though it was one of the hardest things she’d ever done. It just hurt her heart how they tried to reassure her that being treated like less than human was alright, what they expected. “I’m glad you have each other. I hope you can share with each other the things you can’t share with me or anyone else.”
“Do you really think this is the answer?”
The Healer bit her lip in thought, “what about during primary?”
Harry wanted to ask, looking around he could see the question on everyone’s face, but he didn’t, “Yes, that will work.”
Draco nodded, “Yeah. It was just the once, but yeah.”
She dropped her head onto his shoulders. He could feel her retaking her strength and as her tears dried, Lucius froze his rage into ice he could use.
HPHPHP
The tube widened, “Siphoning is when, within that time of expansion, someone gave you both a potion.” She conjured a straw and inserted it into the tube. “So every time you used your magic,” She showed them the light shining through both the tube and straw. She drew out her wand, showing the light inside the straw being led away. “As you had no idea how much your magic had grown you wouldn’t have any indication something was wrong. Any tests measuring your levels would have measured the tube and missed the straw. However, when I gave you the cure,” She removed the straw and waved it away, “things went back to how they’re supposed to be. Now it might take some time but you will learn how your magic feels now and nothing like that will ever work again. Now is that clearer?”
“Anytime,” Harry chuckled.
Teddy was actually worried until Harry smiled. “We’ll be fine Teddy.”
“Draco’s parents gave him over to the cause. I don’t know much, but the papers said the evil manic liked the idea of death and pain being delivered by lovely face. Draco was the Dark Lord’s torturer.”
“He was here,” Harry offered.
Violet glanced to see Mandy had spotted them as well. Violet wave it off to her and went back to the other side of the bar.
“No, they’re muggle.”
Harry raised an eyebrow. He wasn’t sure why she was attacking them. Like she wanted them to try and top her pain.
Harry rolled his eyes. “I don’t know how to explain it. Dumbledore taught me.” He glanced to Draco, figuring Dumbledore had taught him as well, but unsure till Draco nodded to him.
Pansy shared a look with Blaise and started to back what she and Blaise were saying.
Today he felt kind-a numb, and had Tawy asked, he might have vetoed them seeing anyone other than Ron and Hermione. It was the knowledge that they were here which kept him from just walking away. He glanced towards Tawy, who nodded at him. He looked to Draco, who squeezed his hand and with a small smirk, raised his other hand and knocked.
The Healer stood, “boys,”
Ron, having vast experience with the levels of Hermione fury, sat back and let her at it. Though even he was impressed by her imagination.
Siri and Sev didn’t talk about their past and they had never mentioned going back to Britain. Hence, as much as he wanted to go Hogwarts, he would never hurt them as so many had. So Teddy put the letter aside, resigning himself to attending another school.
“Thank you for killing him.”
Harry nodded. “Yeah. I think it’s always been you. Even when you made me so angry, I couldn’t see straight. I wanted you. Sometimes it made me really hate myself, wanting you, when you…yeah it was hard.”
“No,” Ron coughed, “too young to get married.” He’d been working on accepting the idea of Harry and Draco together, so he was kind-a ready for that, but marriage.
Draco glanced at a clock, he hadn’t even noticed and Harry looked just as clueless, “Our apologizes,” he managed to sound if he hadn’t just sprinted up.
“My parents, as everyone knows, are dead. My other family hated me, apart from my god-father and Remus and they, of course, are dead. The rest were using me.” Harry wasn’t saying anything else on the matter. Molly had let him come here after all. As far he was concerned this was just a place to put him when he wasn’t needed anymore.
Harry nodded. “We need to send a lot, the minute we’re out of here. We send owls to our friends, see if they can meet us.”
At this moment, he wasn’t angry with Molly. That might change though. Tawy said he was getting better, but he’d never felt so out of control. Sometimes he was numb and other times overwhelmed with rage, about nothing and everything. He tried to put certain emotions where he thought they should go…but it didn’t always work or even stay as he thought it should. Somethings he knew he should angry about and he just wasn’t, even when he told himself to be and other things, little things, just set him off. Some days he craved the numbness.
She could hear hearts breaking already. “Well boys ready for the tour?”
As they started talking, Draco listened without allowing himself to really hear what they were talking about. He stiffened when one of girls, Ella, he thought her name was, mentioned being threatened with cruciatus. Then something odd happened, Potter pressed his leg against his. Draco glanced but it looked all the world like Potter was innocently listening. Except Potter’s leg didn’t move away, just rested against his. Normally Draco felt his skin crawl with any touch, but this didn’t bother him, so he didn’t move away either.
“They don’t even have their wands! What the hell? Healer Kelly how are they doing that?”
Violet jerked back at the unexpected reaction. She watched as Draco rolled his sleeves down, scratching at his arm as he did, violent hard scratches. His face a mask of disgust and pain. Mandy’s face pale and sick. Harry’s pale and determined.
TBC- Thank you for reading. :)
of the war, escaped with a suspended parole.
Harry glanced back to where Tawy was, obviously headed their way but had been delayed by the door opening and the group that now surrounded her, speaking in a crescendo of half sentences. Harry couldn’t hear what they were saying, but they did seem excited.
“Potter, I always want you, but I’m not much of a fighter. I’ve always just done the least painful choice or what my parents demanded. I’ve had to face some nasty truths about myself and I’m not sure if I know how to be strong.”
Charlie gave them until he heard mum coming out of the kitchen. When he rounded the corner, mum was talking to a woman he’d never seen before, but both women were looking away from the scene at the door.
“That’s what the rags
Harry chuckled, “We’re not hiding really. We’re just getting away and this was the only place I could think of that didn’t involve seeing other people.” Harry glanced around the small dark room of their wardrove. They had just enough room for the both of them to sit together in a corner.
HDHDHDHD
Then there was parlay that had been reached with the French government, a reprise of all punishments whenever they visited. Harry thought they’d probably move to France.
Harry didn’t know what else to do so he withdrew.
Harry scoffed, “Ginny, Draco, her name is Ginny. We’re friends and that’s it. If I had felt about her even half of what I feel for you, I’d never been able to let her go. We broke up and I wasn’t even really upset.”
“Just when I thought you couldn’t possibly get more Gryffindor,” Draco smirked at the deep red stone surrounded by dark yellow gold. The Potter signet ring was something to behold, it was very Potter.
Draco made a choking noise. “What?”
Harry shrugged with a grin and took Draco’s hand. "Let's go meet the masses."
Draco slumped against Harry. They were thoughtful for several minutes, finally Draco shifted, “alright, when do we go?”
Harry nearly laughed at the warning and incredibility in Draco’s voice.
Harry nodded. “Alright. How long does it take to work?”
Judge Fumeurs sighed deeply, “Your sentiment is heard Healer, if you would please.”
Harry opened the door. There were 3 people in the room, two boys, one reading a book with hair darker red than Ron’s, the other a big tall bloke with brown hair and a small blonde girl. The girl didn’t look up from the ends of her long hair. The redheaded boy looked up from his book but then back down. The large boy stood. “Holy shite,” He stared at them. “Clara, Rey, look who the fuck has graced us. The freaks of wizarding youth.”
Malfoy shrugged, “I may still be locked away here when it starts and if not, I don’t know if I could go back there. I don’t think France has changed its age of maturity. My parents may want to move there.”
Mandy’s eyes widened. “But,”
Draco frowned thoughtfully. He hadn’t really considered it before. It was just something that happened. Yet he never let anyone else touch his wand, would have never left it on the potion desk next to anyone else’s, for them to pick up. He couldn’t share a civil word with the bloke but had never had a problem just grabbing Potter’s wand and using it. Criminy they were messed in the head.
