Harry laughed at his graceful words, and they walked back to their friends as he recounted all the boggarts from their DADA class to Draco, while he offered his own, but neither of them mentioned their own fears.
"Pansy I'll kill you in your sleep" Blaise growls at her friend. Terry is comforted by Vincent with a very indignant Ginny growling at Ron. Everyone walks in the direction of the lake while trying to keep voices to a minimum, if a teacher found out what they are about to do they would take at least twenty points from each house.
He tasted with delight the dishes of French origin that the elves seemed to have prepared especially for him. In his old school, he had the statues and elves wrapped around his finger and they made it easy for him to do some daily tasks, and with a little kindness, now the portraits and elves at Hogwarts were also very attached to him.
Headmaster Dumbledore clapped his hands, returning the audience's attention. "Welcome to another year at Hogwarts!" Behind him, in the large window, thunder illuminated the great hall, contrasting its white light against that of the floating candles. "Now, before we proceed to devour the banquet, I would like to add a few things, this year, we are honored to host Professor R.J Lupin, who will be teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts. Good luck Professor." everyone applauded. "I would also like to announce that the magical creature care position will be filled by our beloved Rubeus Hagrid, replacing the former professor who decided to retire with his remaining members."
Immediately the stairs moved in that direction, with the others running anxiously around the painting of grazing elephants. Again, an eager circle of students formed, and Dumbledore pleased them all.
His laugh felt a pit of madness, hot tears were running down his face, his wand was on the ground, just like him.
"A chance to make a bet, I wouldn't miss it for nothing" Pansy laughs as she rubs her hands together, looking like a very successful villain.
Ron is by her side. "She would have been amused to have been here." Harry looks at his best friend, his gaze is far away, and it takes him three horrible seconds to remember who he means. Harry nods. “I mean, a part of me reminds me that she would have been angry for coming to play while we could have been studying, and she would have been more angry doing the lake thing, but… in the end I'm sure she would have laughed with us. "
“He was the one who gave Ginny the diary, we know that! Dumbledore called him at the end of the year to confront him. "Hermione crossed her arms in satisfaction, and Ron looked hurt, with the eyes of a scared niffler." If your father did something like that, who tells us he didn't put his son in to finish the job?"
"I agree, I find it adorable that he did his first baking job for you." Luna swung his wand over his ear.
"Oh, poor Granger." Susan denies. “It's true that it was unbearable until your Draco arrived. She was always chattering in class and interrupting the teachers, the Ravenclaws were even upset about all that, the Slytherins weren't any better, she was always rubbing her first place on everyone. But look at her now, she looks like a neglected ghost, even headless Nick doesn't look that bad.
"No, not yet. Maybe the train broke down." There were more shakes, and sounds of metal, the air began to cool drastically, and as Draco's eyes widened in alarm, the lights finally went out, leaving even more uncertainty in. the environment.
Hermione had taken it far, very far away. Draco felt his hand itch, whether to curse her or to give her a very dignified slap, he didn't know, but she did overdo it. The courtyard was silent, the witch had used that tone of voice, full of smugness and gradually increasing, that Draco thought it was a little funny, because she did it when she was talking about something she read in a book, but this time it only caused to him a very bitter stab of annoyance.
Lupin nodded heavily. "Dementors, very horrifying creatures, are known for the feeling of sadness, fear and desolation they cause, they can take your soul out." Lupine reached into the pockets of his robe as he spoke, pulled out a sealed bar of chocolate, and handed Harry a piece of three squares. "Here Mr. Potter, the experiences with dementors are traumatic and exhausting. You too sir…" He handed the rest of the chocolate to Draco.
"Bibble is going to do her task!" The elf nods and disappears with a Pop. Four seconds later, the pop returns and Bibble does too. "Bibble has successfully completed the task Master Draco has given her!" in her hands were five sachets of something called canine duck pate. The blonde did not know that there was pate especially for dogs. "Bibble delivers the order!"
But now it seemed determined. "Very good, but if this is something like the talk of bees and flowers I will hit you and run away"
"Well, were they really like two things I wanted to ask you?" Harry didn't look at him "It's, well, why doesn't anyone say your last name, not even in class? and uh, would you share one of your candies with me? "
Draco smiled at his friend in red-trimmed robes. "Are you coming to accompany me to my class, or do you need something?" The blonde knew he was a topic of conversation between the trio, he wasn't quite sure if it was about Hermione, or something else, but the looks they gave him in the hallways and in the dining room were certainly not subtle. He wasn't worried, because his intentions weren't hostile so far, it was more of an active curiosity.
"Alright Bibble, make sure no photos get damaged or lost" the elf nods three times and then disappears.
Draco wished he had a fear as simple as a muggle machine, or a fish that he would never see in his life, but instead, he had memories of a cold hospital, an uncomfortable bed where he was forced to sleep, his mother's tears, and his father's unkempt hair. There was also the stench of humidity in that dungeon, the sensation of the crystal ball reciting the family curse, and there was the moon… there was always the moon.
Professor Lupin put a hand on his shoulder again, but this time it only caused repulsion. He managed to get to his feet, his wand still in his hand, and before he could say anything, he ran off. Once again with tears shining.
"Bah" Ron rolled his eyes "I am not despising Hagrid's effort, but what I am saying is that the food should be all edible"
Draco heads to his bathroom to remove the mask, underneath the magic mixture there are small light brown dots swirling over the bridge of his nose and under his eyes, disappearing when they reach his cheekbones. There are days when he thinks they are not so bad, but he have never dared to let someone other than his mother or father see him that way. Insecurity is not typical of a Black or a Malfoy, so Draco simply glamorizes his face while he dusts the paste on his face.
“It's something I do to avoid a bad mood. Angry expression lines are very easy to mark. " The blond wrinkled his nose. "I don't want to have to be one of those wizards who has to use potions to preserve their good looks."
But he instantly regrets it, the fucking lake is more than frozen, he feels like any part of his body that touches the water is being poked by millions of tiny needles.
For the rest of the trip they talked briefly about Quidditch, the fact that Lupine was a teacher, his classes, and the Dementors. Completely overlooking the lack of space between Draco and Harry, and how they never moved from their place, just chatting away unaware of the worries in each other's heads.
His words were recorded with more success than in English, and after a few minutes they just sat on the dirty and damp tiles of the greenhouse, eating sweets that originally were for another friend. But Draco tried to suppress the past events. At least now he was sure he had a person on his side, no matter what last name he was using.
Neville found it under the mandrake pots, an unworthy, tearful mess. The smell of Harry's soap was still on his cape, with the smell of molasses cake, which was somehow comforting and soothing. Draco desperately wanted to regain his composure and pretend nothing had happened, but Neville, horrible and wonderful Neville, went and gave him a hug. His eyes were already sore from subsequent tears, but the contact only revived them.
The professor flees with surprising agility for someone who always looks so tired. Draco has been tempted to slip in a revitalizing potion several times, just so the professor can keep those horrible dark circles off his face. He may not be more than thirty-five years old, but with fatigue always hanging from his limbs he always seems older.
The sight of his first language makes his morning instantly better, no matter that he receive letters from his mother every two days, seeing his beloved language on the expensive parchment makes he miss his old residence a little less. He still exchanges letters with all his friends in Beaubaxon, but even the wide view of the school's wild grounds doesn't make up for the back gardens of his first school.
"I hope you are awake for this class, because today I have brought you the surprise that I told you about last week" The teacher extends an arm towards the closet that suddenly shakes, causing the closest students to stand back in surprise . "We read about this particular creature, would anyone want to try to guess what it is?"
“We have plenty of time to unravel the mysteries James hides. Don't you want to finally try my French chocolates?
“Holy…” Harry trailed off, he could see Hermione in a tight ball underneath the sinks as the troll was advancing on her. “Confuse it.” Draco kicked into action and picked up the plywood that was just thrown at them and a piece of metal plumbing and waved them around, hitting them into stuff and yelling.
harry was entered in the tournament and draco, sirius and remus aren’t happy about it. draco’s powers have really developed but harry is still having trouble getting his to work. if you’ve forgotten anything that’s happened before, just ask me in the comments and i’ll get to you asap
“Okay…” she didn’t seem very interested, instead paying more attention to her nail beds, which Draco had mentioned were terrible, and hardly looked up to survey the newcomer.
They shared a long look and Sirius nodded. Remus knew better than anyone what it felt like to be different from your peers, to have a magical weight on your shoulders. He couldn’t do it to his son, or James and Lily’s for that matter.
Still, Draco seemed to have brushed the whole thing off in favour of his studies. Or perhaps in favour of the new Defense teacher,
“Remus, you know you can tell us anything.” James said. It wasn’t often that Remus saw them like this. Peter had stopped trying to swallow that stupid amount of food, James was calm, and Sirius was quiet. It was unnerving. He wished that they would all just cut the crap and shame him for his disease already.
Harry and Draco were obliged to leave early, however, as they had lunch plans with Sirius and Remus, so they bid Ron and Hermione their farewells and set off.
Moony opened his mouth in protest and looked around incredulously. “B - but I can’t! I’d be putting the students in danger!”
“Where’s my wand?” Harry whispered as he patted down his pockets, but Draco looked up to see it being twirled with Riddle’s long, slender fingers. “Shit.”
Sirius stood up shakily and looked her dead in the eye, ignoring the small stinging of impending tears in the corner of his eye.
Today, however, he was in charge of the music. And the cake, and the decorations. He was even asked what he wanted, which was such a strange question to be asked he burst into tears and had to be taken off on a walk by Draco, where he finally recounted some of his stories.
“We know all this, Dumbledore, get on with it.” The man was not put out in the slightest by Sirius’s interruption, instead seemed to have expected it.
“I don’t really know. Maybe if Draco had a place he could go to when he needs to let off some steam?”
“We searched the whole village but didn’t find anyone who looked like him. He doesn’t have a wand but he could have apparated, they don’t have a way to keep tabs on that.” He sighed and tossed his head back like he did when he was frustrated. “I just really want to find him, I want him to be stupid enough to come to Hogwarts or something so we can get him.” he growled.
The girl was exceedingly strange, and it wasn’t surprising that she was known as Moaning Myrtle. She wailed and cried unendingly, always upset about something. Today, it was that someone had thrown a book at her.
“Well, I suppose that’s only fair.” he leaned back in his chair with his classic ‘I’m about to tell a story’ sigh. “You guys remember how Pads spent four years in Azkaban, don’t you?” The boys nodded, looking quickly to Sirius, sympathetically. “Well, he was in Azkaban because Wormtail or, rather, Peter Pettigrew, framed him for his murder, and the murder of twelve muggles.” Harry and Draco gasped, but Remus ploughed on. “Peter Pettigrew is dead, as far as we know, although Sirius seems to think otherwise-”
“I actually do, hold on.” With that, he conveniently pulled out a stack of shiny cards and spilled them on the library table. He plucked out the Dumbledore card with practised ease and presented it to Draco, who, in turn, read from it aloud.
I think I'd want to go to Beauxbatons because its so very elegant and the uniforms are gorgeous, but Hogwarts is too awesome to ignore. Maybe I'd spend the first few years at Hogwarts and then be the glamorous, mysterious, Slytherin exchange student from England, that would be very cool.
“Sure.” The boy looked nervous, probably anticipated some kind of scolding, Sirius realised with a pang, so he quickly clarified and took a seat next to Harry on the sofa.
The tap glowed with a blinding white light and started to spin, soon after that started, the sink itself began to sink further and further into the ground until it was completely out of sight, leaving a large pipe exposed, looking like the entrance of a sinister slide.
As did Remus, it seemed, for he ushered the lot of them a few feet away, leaving Harry behind, transfixed on the stone. Draco noticed that Sirius’s usually clear and bright, silvery eyes shone like the moon with unshed tears. He took his hand and squeezed. Sirius looked down at him before engulfing him in a tight hug.
“Well, Harry, he’s dead now, and I like to think it’s more difficult to hate someone if they’re dead. Sirius disagrees. He did something truly awful. Maybe it’s a story for another time.” He shook his head and plastered on his happy face. “This is supposed to be a lovely atmosphere filled with good memories, isn’t it. Here, I'll demonstrate.”
“Uncle Vernon sounds like a prick.” Harry giggled, then snorted, which turned into a fit of sheepish laughter, clearly not accustomed to hearing people badmouth his uncle, or such language.
Draco, in turn, was thrilled with his gift from Harry, too. It was a small Muggle instrument. A harm-on-ee-car, Harry had said. It was pocket sized and rectangular with an engraving on the side of the ‘Draco’ constellation. When Harry demonstrated how to use it, it created a lovely, warm sound that touched something inside of Draco. It took him a little while to get the hang of it, but soon he could play tunes. It came in a velvet box, in which Draco stored it with meticulous care whenever he wasn’t playing with it or admiring the engraving.
Harry was researching the Chamber of Secrets again, he told Draco that he wouldn’t, but he couldn’t help it. He had little bits of information that floated around his head, but they didn’t match up. Riddle’s diary and the memory, the fact that he could speak Parseltongue, the Chamber being built by Slytherin, himself being the heir of Slytherin. It all seemed to add up but nobody seemed to be doing anything. Also, it had become common knowledge that the gameskeeper, Hagrid, had mysteriously disappeared from school grounds. Nobody had seen him and all of the Professors avoided all questions. It all seemed strange to Harry but he held himself back, not wanting to alarm Draco again, especially after that spectacular kiss on the Quidditch field.
Excitement was bubbling in the air on Thursday morning and spirits were high. All anybody could talk about was Professor Lupin-Black and his amazing classes, and finally Draco could see his father in action.
“Yeah, I did. Look, don’t let it get to you, nobody likes a Slytherin. I bet they just didn’t expect you, of all people, to be one. You know, your parents were Gryffindors.”
“Yeah! No shit!” He was panting, desperately trying to keep his eyes on the path ahead. “Harry! This was such a bad idea. Why did we think this was a good idea?” Both boys were still screaming over the noise of the engine.
“Four years later, you, Sirius, had been released from Azkaban and young Mr Malfoy found himself in a similar position to the one Harry had found himself in. Without parents. Now, as you know, the House of Black has always been quite a toxic environment for a child to grow up in, and the Malfoys are no different. And with Draco’s, shall we say, unusual, powers, I felt it best that he grew up in a home that wouldn’t exploit them, hence my putting him in your care. Now, I had thought that, perhaps, I should release Harry from the Dursley’s care and bring him here to live with you, his other legal guardian, but, when I reached Privet Drive, I noticed him sitting, alone in the back garden, showing off some skills that, perhaps would be at odds with Draco’s.” A chill ran down Remus’s spine.
“I’m just glad that ol’ Dumby got me out.” said Sirius with a weak attempt at a smile. “I managed to keep my sanity in that hellhole because I knew I was innocent, but I don’t know how much longer I would have lasted.”
“I suppose we have to catch one.” Draco shrugged and walked towards the broomsticks that were leaning towards the wall. “What kind are we looking for?”
“Yes. But you don’t have to tell me anything if you don’t want to. But, if you did want to, I’m here.” The dark-haired boy seemingly shrank. “Alright, lets try something else. What about, you come and stay here over Easter, and even the Summer holidays, if you want? Would you like that?” Sirius had clearly said the right thing because Harry perked up and grinned.
“Yes. I have some Moon Frog Juice on the stove if you want to come in for a cup? It should really help with the Nargles.”
They chattered amiably about sweets for hours, unaware of the time that was passing. They each tried a Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Bean, with Draco getting tar and Harry getting ‘old shoe’.
Harry waited anxiously as Dobby opened the bag. “Master has given Dobby a sock, master gave it to Dobby.” The elf held the slimy thing as though it were some priceless treasure.
The group bundled into the house where they enjoyed a wonderful Summer lunch, afterwards, Draco showed Harry the broom that he had gotten for his birthday, a Nimbus 2000, and they took it in turns playing with it in the garden until they were called in for dinner. At dinner, Remus and Sirius spoke to both Harry and Draco about the plans from then on.
They talked about what could have hurt Mrs Norris, which Harry didn’t really care about. He was more focused on whatever the hell the Chamber of Secrets was and why he was hearing whispers through the wall.
After the game, they had a big picnic, with food made by Molly and the House Elves, and a giant cake, with so many candles that Harry managed to blow them all out only after five tries.
“That man is thoroughly incompetent!” he exclaimed. “Aside from the fact that he must have tried to attack my son, Draco wouldn’t lie, he was a completely useless teacher! Surely you know about that, Dumbledore!”
thank you to anyone still reading, it really means a lot to me that you still care about this silly little story, which i do still fully intend to finish, i’m really proud of the final ending i came up with so i do really want to get there and write it
Thanks for all the comments recently!! Also can I just apologise, I feel like Draco is smarter than Ron, no offence to Ron, I love him, but I feel like he would spot some of the obvious things about the chamber quicker? If that makes sense? My point is, they find it in a slightly different way to how they do in canon, I didn't want to force all of the scenes that happened in the book to happen in this because it felt unnatural (???). Sorry, I'm super new at this whole fan fiction thing, but I'm having a lot of fun with it!
“Draco! You did it!” Harry cried before removing his wand from the creature’s nose, but Draco shot him a silencing glare.
Draco bit his lip and looked at his father sceptically. “I’m thirteen, dad. I care about Harry deeply, because he is my best friend, but I’m still a child. I don’t know what I want, and I don’t know what I’m going to want in the future. Neither does Harry. I don’t think I’d be offended if it turned out that our relationship in the romantic sense isn’t made to last.”
Harry wasted no time checking the headline, which was, as expected, about the breakout. He had never seen Lucius Malfoy before and was stunned by the resemblance he had to his son. No, he wasn’t beautiful like Draco, but you could see that beauty maybe once resided in his features, but that Voldemort ripped it from him. His face was contorted into a grim snarl as he glared daggers at the camera, Draco had never made that face. Harry didn’t think that Draco was capable.
Draco paused and mulled this question over. “Not angry. They were both in Gryffindor and Gryffindors are meant to be the good guys. I just don’t think I’m brave enough. Maybe I’ll be in Ravenclaw, Moony says I’m very smart!” The boy brightened at this.
The complication over who Harry would be staying with over that period of time became a lot more complicated after the whole ‘Heir of Slytherin’ debacle. Nobody seemed to want to take on the young Parseltongue, even if it was only for five weeks of the year. It was going to be the Finnigan’s, but they backed out, and the Thomas’s were a no-go once the Finnigan’s didn’t want to. Remus was actually going to firecall Molly Weasley and try to convice her, but it was a longshot.
“FIFTY POINTS FROM SLYTHERIN NOW ARE YOU QUITE FINISHED, MR MALFOY?” Snape roared. Draco snapped his mouth shut and glared at him.
“No, they need to take care of all of us! We should go find her and tell her to go to Gryffindor Tower.”
The pair had eloped five days before the tragic deaths of Lily and James Potter, knowing in their hearts that it may be their final opportunity. But during the few months they had to get back on their feet, Dumbledore was back at the Ministry, fighting for Draco Malfoy to be removed from his mother’s custody. Once the papers were signed, Narcissa was admitted to St. Mungos and young Draco was left mother and fatherless. Still, Dumbledore wasn’t done, for he knew a couple who could raise the child with the right intent. With Malfoy blood in him, the child was bound to be a powerful wizard, and they couldn’t risk him getting into the wrong hands. And so, on the evening of the 3rd August 1984, the Lupin-Blacks found a typically unperturbed Dumbledore, with a sleeping child in his arms,  and a stern looking Minerva McGonagall on their doorstep.
Harry tore the paper away and gasped. It was the new Firebolt, the one that Draco had gotten for his birthday a few weeks ago that Harry had been coveting. He couldn’t speak for a full ten seconds, which may have given the wrong message.
Slowly, it started to tiptoe over to him. It really was a gruesome looking thing. Hair was missing in some places and it had a mouth like an ass.
The next morning at breakfast, a red envelope was deposited into Draco’s scrambled eggs and his blood ran cold.
Sirius practically heaved at that. James took note and looked more panicked. “But she did! In the end! And Moony
Draco was beginning to get frustrated. If this person was going to kill them, why hadn't they done it already? It seemed a little ridiculous that he was dragging it out so much.
Harry felt like a clamp was closing around his neck, but Draco paid him no attention. His eyes were seemingly glued to McGonagall, but Harry could see that they were actually glazed over and glassy.
“It just looks like a diary, to me.” he said with a shrug as he grabbed it. The date on the cover told him that it was fifty years old, and the smudged name on the first page told him that it belonged to someone called T.M. Riddle.
Remus checked that Harry and Draco were asleep before firecalling Dumbledore. He and Sirius had been keeping in touch with the older wizard with weekly meetings. The man stepped into their sitting room, found a seat on the armchair nearest the fireplace and turned to Remus and Sirius, who were on the adjacent sofa, with expectant looks.
Remus watched on sympathetically. “It’s annoying, I know, but at least we have the map. We know he’s still alive.”
Harry sighed and rolled his eyes, as though he could have explained it any better than he did. “You have to drink the tea, silly.”
“Just the Daily Prophet, that’s the main wizard newspaper.” Draco opened up the paper only to find his own name glaring back at him at the headline underneath the article about a break-in at Gringotts. Ignoring the shocking news, Draco circled in on his own name and read the headline, blood going cold.
When he was finished, Harry had to admit, he was slightly turned on, but it didn’t matter, because Draco lay limp against a tree, coated in frost. Tears were streaming down his face but he seemed unaware of them.
“I know it's Christmas, and I don’t want to get too morbid, but I just want you to know how much you mean to me.” There was something about Sirius’s expression that unnerved Draco, but he didn’t press it, knowing that he would be told eventually. The older man shivered, even though Draco had never felt toastier in his life, and suggested that they go in and check on Remus and Harry. When they entered the kitchen, it was alive with the Christmas spirit. From the comforting warmth of the room to the mouth-watering smell of the food, everything was screaming love and happiness. Harry was in the corner, chopping carrots. “Oh, come on, Moons! What have you got the kid cooking for?” Harry blushed a soft pink and kept his head firmly down.
I hope you enjoy, and I forgot to say that I hope this is proving a good enough quarantine distraction as it is for me haha <3
“My uncle used to say that too, but I don’t think it’s true. I don’t really see what the problem is with it, to be honest.”
“We’ll leave you to it, then, Gilderoy,” said McGonagall “Tonight will be an excellent time to do it. We’ll make sure everyone’s out of your way. You’ll be able to tackle the monster all by yourself. A free rein at last.” Harry could hear the challenge dripping from her tone and smiled slightly, she was a badass.
“Silly Perseus. What did he bring you?” Harry was good with names, Draco concluded, he had a wonderful memory and tried really hard to pronounce each one right. Draco had told him the name of his owl the night before when Harry had mentioned his trip to Diagon Alley with Hagrid, and Draco had explained that Perseus was a constellation, just like his own name was.
“Excuse me, sir, I think you dropped this.” He held out the purse to the stockier man and smiled innocently.
“I don’t know… maybe a dog print, to celebrate our recent accomplishment?” That suggestion raised a series of cheers and clinking of glasses. Truly, becoming animagi was the hardest thing the boys had ever had to do, but it was completely worth it to see the look of pure relief on Remus’s face when they stayed with him after a transformation, or to see him calmer at the prospect of a full moon. It didn’t even make much of a difference that Sirius was in love with him, he probably would have done the same thing even if he wasn’t.
“Yes, Harry, that probably is what it was, now can we please just go to sleep now?” Harry sighed. “Fine. How about I write to my dads tomorrow, I’ll tell them that old Dumby is keeping a three headed dog as a pet, they’ll ask Dumbledore why, we’ll get an answer.”
“I don’t know.” He immediately felt sick. “We should get out of here.” But, before they could, a crowd of people gathered around them and gasped at the message. Argus Filch shoved through the crowd and started screaming about them murdering his cat, fellow Slytherins yelled profanities, and Dumbledore simply stood there in thought, gazing at the wall. He came to his senses soon enough, though, and carefully detached the cat from it’s hanging.
If any of you live in the UK also, I hope you aren't going crazy after being put in another lockdown. It's kind of scary but we're all in it together.
He and Draco kept a tight hold on each other’s hands throughout the meeting, until their names were mentioned.
“It’s fine, I just hate thinking about it.” The werewolf hid his head in his hands. “I love that kid so much and I don’t want to see him go and fight in a war.” Sirius moved over to sit next to him, and held his head in a loose, comforting embrace.
I just realised how bloody long this is going to be. It's already the length of the first one and they aren't even at Hogwarts yet lol
“MOONY!! PADS!! IT’S CHRISTMAS!!” Draco yelled, running into their room. “WAKE UP, WAKE UP, WAKE UUUUP!!”
The end of the Christmas holidays came too soon for Harry. The family atmosphere filled him with such a feeling of longing that it hurt just a little. But he could see better days on the horizon, especially now that he would be staying with the Lupin-Blacks over Easter and perhaps even over the Summer holidays. Still, it felt good to return to Hogwarts. It was the first place that had ever felt like home to him and would always hold a special place in his heart. The first night back, Harry and Draco huddled together on Draco’s bed and pored over Harry’s new book. He waved his wand over it, whispering the name Nicolas Flamel and black text bled onto the page. It wasn’t as much as their previous searches had provided them with (Jokey things like ‘Quidditch Fails’ and ‘Celestia Warbeck’), but it was still more than they had before. It told them, aside from useless information about his height and age, which was an astounding 653, that he was the only known maker of the Philosopher’s Stone. It did not say what the Philosopher’s Stone was, but it must be valuable.
“We matched up the days you left to the dates of the full moon, we looked up werewolves in the restricted section, and we came here today just to check on you, we hadn’t meant to scare you or let you know that we knew anything, we’re sorry.” he rambled, eyes fixed on the ground. It was so strange, James never looked guilty.
He wrote to Draco every day, multiple times a day, but still felt the boy’s loss bitterly. He hadn’t realised quite how much he depended on Draco’s company. Not even because he had nobody else to hang out with, because he did, Blaise Zabini and Pansy Parkinson had stayed for the holiday, and they were nice enough, but he missed his friend’s ridiculous giggle that took over his whole body when somebody told a dirty joke, or his witty but insanely accurate comments about people, even the lectures about grades. Still, he was content to enjoy Easter as well as he could, and he did.
Draco wasn’t struggling with his Patronus, at all. He never struggled with anything. That was the beauty of being good at everything you attempted. So he would never admit that he was envious of Harry for casting a corporeal one before him, because he wasn’t. Envy was a childish emotion. As was frustration, which was why he was most definitely not feeling it as he was trying to cast the spell.
PS. If you see any spelling or punctuation errors, I will not be offended if you tell me, I wrote this when I was really tired and just wanted to get the chapter up haha
He was truly exhausted. It didn’t help that he spent the night in the Hospital Wing and had to wake up early in order to return to his dorm unsuspected. There was a moment when he returned where he felt sure that Sirius had seen him, but if he had he’d done a great job at pretending he hadn’t all day.
“I was just really immersed in the book?” he offered, to no avail. If it weren’t for the three sleeping boys in the room, Draco would have been having a hissy fit. He cast a silencing charm over the bed and clambered in, drawing the curtains behind him. He then let it rip.
Remus seemed to pause to think for a moment. “You don’t mind if I keep the map, do you, Harry?” Harry grimaced slightly. “You know I can’t let you keep it.” The corners of his mouth turned up a little in fond exasperation. “And anyway, I need it if I’m going to find Peter!”
The pair stopped when they reached the end of the tunnel and marvelled at the spectacle before them. The wall was engraved with two snakes, intertwined, each having an emerald glinting as it’s eye.
“THREE” They both yelled as they ran for the wall, only to find themselves sprawled on the floor, sporting nose injuries from their faces colliding with the stone. Draco held up his hand and gingerly touched his nose, before holding it out for inspection.
Shits about to get pretty angsty so enjoy this little bit of fluffy shmoopy shmoop with a little dusting of context driven angst...
They lifted off and the balls were released, but one bludger came flying directly at Harry’s head. He swiftly dodged it and Bole smacked it over towards Alicia Spinnet, but it flew back to Harry again. By now, Derrick had joined them and whacked the ball over towards Wood, but it still boomeranged back to Harry.
Riddle started hissing and speaking to something that Draco couldn’t see and the sinking feeling in his stomach grew. Harry’s face was as pale as death but they held onto each other’s hands with an iron grip. They both turned their heads up, however, to see the face of the statue moving, opening its mouth wider and wider. They both backed up until their backs hit the wall and Fawkes flew away to somewhere Draco couldn’t see, Harry had his eyes closed so he followed suit, realising how stupid he was to have kept them open for so long. There was a thud as something big hit the floor of the Chamber: the Basilisk had arrived.
Remus lifted his brows in light surprise. “Right, yes, you never got a go, did you? Do you think it might be… Voldemort?”
“You’re beautiful.” Harry whispered, as though it was a secret only they knew. Draco pressed their foreheads together and focused on their stilted breathing, to calm his pounding heart. It was such a strange sensation, to feel in love. A sensation that Draco never thought he would feel. Sure, his parents were in love, but he always just thought that it was such a rare thing that he would never have it. But he knew then that he could never feel about anyone the way that he felt about Harry in that moment.
His eyes were dark and stormy, terrifying, actually. “I’ve already lost both of my parents, I won’t lose you too. We leave now.”
It wasn’t the first full moon that had happened at Hogwarts, but it was the first that fell on an actual weekday, so Professor Lupin-Black’s defense class had a substitute teacher, Professor Snape.
“Keep my voice down? He turned me into a ferret and smashed me into the ground! I’m pretty sure I have bruises!” Draco could feel the ice thrumming through his fingertips, itching to be used against Moody. He could just picture what he would do as revenge but his thoughts were interrupted by McGonagall and Harry each taking an arm and dragging him out of the way.
Harry noticed a box of matches near his foot and got an idea. He took one out of the box and lit it, before holding it up to the palm of his hand. Still, nothing happened.
They all had concerned expressions on their faces as Sirius continued to rub circles on his back and shoulder. He didn’t understand why they weren’t angry. Or at least scared. But they all seemed to only care about him in a kind way, which was confusing and overwhelming but also comforting and he didn’t know what to feel.
Sirius pinched the bridge of his nose, a habit he picked up with every letter Draco sent. “Shouldn’t we tell them? Maybe it’s time.”
Draco knew what Harry could do. He could talk to snakes. He knew it was horrible, supposedly. But that knowledge didn’t stop him from liking it so much. The same way he liked Gilderoy Lockhart, even though he was an idiot, only more. It was strange. It made him feel things he had never felt before. He didn’t tell Harry this. He didn’t tell anyone. He would just keep it a secret. Because the whole school was either terrified of Harry, or desperate for his attention. Their group of Slytherin cronies definitely were. With the rumours that Harry was the Heir of Slytherin going around, he was a very good alliance to have. But Ron and Hermione had basically ditched them. And whenever the two walked side-by-side down a corridor, students would scream and run the other way, or tremble, paralysed with fear. It was nice, actually, not being the only one that people were afraid of, but he could tell that Harry didn’t like it. Even when he suggested that they take advantage of it and sit on thrones that would be lifted in the air by their cohorts, there was still a bitterness to his laugh.
“Better now that he’s not living with those disgusting people you put him with, Dumbledore.” Sirius growled, glaring daggers at the man.
times he had to come in and issue a verbal beating to the old wizard for countless things. It was relieving to know that it wasn’t exactly Dumbledore’s fault this time.
Draco stopped and stared at Harry as though he were looking at a different person. “Who told you about that?”
“Come on, mate, the only thing creepier than basically stalking a girl and asking her out every day, even though she repeatedly has said no, is to then get a tattoo in her honor.”
They continued giggling until they finally got to Herbology, for which they were severely late for, but McGonagall had sorted out everything so it wasn’t an issue, but they were given extra homework to catch up.
The blond grimaced and looked down to see ‘XXX’ in bold letters next to the words ‘Highly Dangerous - Avoid at all costs’. He didn’t say anything.
When he finally made it to the end, Minnie kissed him on both cheeks and placed him in his spot to await Remus, who glided into the room only seconds after.
“Haven’t you guessed yet?” He lifted his wand and traced it through the air, leaving behind three shimmering words.
Gilderoy then stammered out some kind of nonsense about getting ready in his office and departed, so Harry and Draco waited until all the other teachers did the same before rushing after him.
Harry too rumpled his brow and peered down at the bottom of the cup, and then consulted his book. “It could be a… oh, Draco, I think you’ve got the Grim too!” he exclaimed, looking closer at his subjects.
“Why is there a house elf in here?” Sirius exclaimed, running forward to pick it up and hoist it into his arms. “Who are you?”
PS. I know it’s kinda boring at this point, sorry! I have exciting things planned for the final part of PoA and I’m in the midst of writing it and the GoF should be pretty busy so just hang in there lol
Draco hadn’t seen the dementors. Nobody had. Although his focus was almost exclusively on the Quaffle, so he probably wouldn’t have noticed them anyway, but he was always fine-tuned to the wellbeing of Harry Potter, and seeing him fall from the sky like he was falling from heaven itself, did definitely turn his head.
“Sorry?” Remus asked incredulously. “Why are you sorry? I’ve tricked you guys, you’ve been living with a monster for two years, you should be furious!” He was gasping for air now, his lungs twinging slightly at the lack of air being transferred into them. In his peripheral vision, Remus could see Sirius pouring a glass of water and passing it to him, which he gratefully accepted and then chugged down. He felt physically better, but his mind still felt like someone was blasting sixty different songs at full volume and was shouting along to the lyrics.
His friend shook his head once more. “When I know what I want to get a tattoo of, then I will get one. Until then, I don’t see any reason to scar my body any more than it already is.”
When he pulled back, his eyes were red and he glared down at the ground, willing his heartbeat to slow. He turned to Sirius and engulfed him in a hug also.
“Sorry, Rem.” he whispered. “We woke you up, didn’t we?” Remus tentatively sat up, trying to avoid his wounds and rubbed his eyes clear of groggy sleep-dust, as his mother used to call it.
I know it's been a while, and I'm sorry. It's been kind of an awful week, but I only have one left before half-term and I'll be writing a lot more then. How have you guys been? Also, question of the chapter, what are some of your favourite Drarry fics? I've been running low recently and could use some recommendations <3
“What’re you freaking out about, mate?” he scoffed. “I’m the one who has to make the big speech, you can just take it easy!”
“Thank you.” He didn’t have time, however, to revel in Harry because his distraction caused him to sink closer to the rails. There was a rumbling behind them, which they soon determined to be the Hogwarts Express, hot on their heels.
“Seeing as Mr Potter is in my house, I will see to it that he is punished accordingly.” he practically growled. “Twenty points from Slytherin, for being out of bed, and another ten for being in possession of a suspicious item.”
Fred and George were hilarious, hurling endless pranks at their brothers, there was even a moment where Harry was sure that McGonagall had helped them with a discreet flick of her wrist.
Remus and Sirius left him with a quick ruffle of the hair and, just like that, he was alone. Waiting for a mass murderer in a deserted hallway.
Draco found himself partnered up with a bushy haired girl who introduced herself as Hermione, and Harry was left with the redhead they met in the entrance hall, Randy or something. It turned out that the Hermione girl was actually very smart. Draco had always thought that she was somewhat of a know-it-all but she was a lot better to work with than Harry, who constantly needed his precise guidance. While they were working, the pair found themselves having pleasant conversations. They both had a love of Astronomy, a topic they started when Hermione pointed out that his name was a constellation, they loved books, Hermione introduced Draco to some Muggle literature, and Draco got to introduce Hermione to Muggle Rock, something the Sirius was ever-so fond of. In the end, their potion was as close to perfect as it could have been and Snape was begrudgingly impressed, awarding 15 points to Slytherin and 10 to Gryffindor, convinced that Hermione must have been slacking off.
Without second thought, Draco plunged the fang deep into the cover of the book, where it seemed to bleed ink. Riddle screamed so he dug it in deeper, and deeper until there was a hole in the centre. He looked up to see Harry, healthy and miraculously alive, and the man who had tormented them all year, gone in a piercing scream.
He was just about to call Harry in to look at it, when he heard the other boy shriek from his bedroom.
Remus tried to put this out of his mind, however. Instead of stressing over anything, like he always did, he was going to let nature take it’s course. There was a prophecy once told about all of this. And nothing he did would prevent that from happening, so why should be bother?
“What is it? What do you know?” Even Ron had abandoned his former stony silence in favour of curiosity.
Sirius kicked a wall and growled, low and loud. Minerva would do the same if it weren’t for her dignity.
Harry shook his head in disbelief and blinked away the tears that had just invaded his eyes. “This is too much, I can’t accept this!”
There was a long silence where neither of them knew what to say, until Draco simply started cleaning up and Harry started talking about how hilarious it was to see Crabbe and Goyle make that Hippogriff so angry. Draco tried to laugh along with his friend, but it was difficult. He didn’t like the new feeling of dread that was pooling into his stomach like a sick weight, the fear that Divination may not be so stupid as he’d made it out to be.
One specific report, Rita Skeeter, had it in for Draco. She repeatedly brought up his lineage, Remus’ lycanthropy, and called his powers unnatural and dangerous. She claimed that Harry was being brainwashed by Draco and his family to one day team up with You-Know-Who.
“I’m so sorry, dad. I just didn’t feel hungry. I would rather be doing so many other things.” Draco was speaking in a tight, strained voice and was hiding ducking his head into his chest, a coping mechanism that he developed before he was adopted because it made him feel safer not to let his emotions show. Remus reached out and grasped his shoulder.
“I’m not dead. I’m right here.” The other boy finally pulled away and looked down on him with wet eyes.
“Well, it sounds quite scary, but all you need to do is walk straight at the bit of the wall. Actually, it’s best to do it at a bit of a run. Sirius, why don’t you demonstrate?” Sirius took a moment to pull himself together, and ran his hands through Draco’s hair a few times while taking deep, calming breaths to do it.
"Very well. Now, I'm going to put you into pairs, and I don't care about your friends and your wishes, so save me from your complaints."
"Kiss each other..." snickered Blaise, and the whole table erupted in laughter. After a moment, Harry joined them, enjoying the friendly bickering, knowing none of them intended to offend them.
"And? I thought you liked them, that's all you ever talk about," mumbled Blaise and Harry had to agree with him. Nearly every day the blond loved to remind them how good he is at flying, and what a wonderful Quidditch player he is.
Their trunks had already been brought up, and too tired to talk much, they pulled out their pajamas and fell into bed.
Is this what the hat meant? Is this what he could learn here? To stand up for himself? He admits, he really needs to grow a spine, and finally be treated as he deserves, but getting revenge? He doesn't want to hurt others, even if they hurt him first... He knows the feeling of being bullied, and he doesn't want to become someone like Dudley and his gang...
"It's not like they want to be friends either," Millicent shrugged her shoulders, "They don't approach us, so why would we do that?"
Thank you for reading my story! If you want, leave a comment with your opinion and ideas about the story. In the beginning the story will more or less be similar to the books, and then gradually turn into my own take on the Potterverse. I can't promise a regular updating schedule, but I try to post at least once a week. If you like the story so far, please leave some kudos :)
- if you keep up with the attitude you'll end up just like your parents. But don't worry, I'll make sure you catch on soon enough. And since I'm so
Harry wants to know whether he can maintain a friendship with Ron or not, meets his head of the House and has tea with Hagrid.
Then Dumbledore stood up, beaming at the students, his arms opened wide like it's the best thing in the world to have a school full of students.
"What's up?" asked Hagrid, "You look like a kicked puppy," he frowned. "and no puppy should be kicked."
When he finally arrived at the table, a few people shook his hands, congratulated and patted him on the back.
"I asked Snape, he allowed us to have lunch on the grounds, and not only that, he will make sure we got a house-elf with us." smiled Malfoy smugly.
"You think I have to gain anything from befriending you, other than the fact I would enjoy it?" Harry asked with a hurt expression. "And I'm only with them, because we're roommates, and the upperclassmen said it's better if we stick together," he explained.
"No," was his response, and the blond averted his gaze, "But it's because I've never got along with my aunt and family. It's better here for me, here I can... be myself."
Ron started coughing, suspiciously sounding like he wanted to cover his laugh with it. Draco's gaze snapped toward him.
"Theo can be super grumpy in the morning, but after breakfast, he becomes more active," he took a sip of his tea, "Blaise can be really blunt sometimes, and I'm not sure if I like or hate that. Tracey is nice to talk to, she's kind but she's a very private person, I don't know much of her..."
His eye shifted to the man at the center of the table - Albus Dumbledore. He sat in a large gold chair, his silver hair shining. Harry also spotted Professor Quirrell, the nervous man from the Leaky Cauldron.
Ron just stood for a moment, and when Harry was ready to leave the awkward situation, he finally nodded towards his friends, as to say he will join them later.
Others will attack them? Just because where they got sorted? He was sure, that there was something more to it, but he could also imagine it to be true. He heard others talk bad about the House and seen the look on their faces.
"Erm... it's nothing serious. It's just..." he sighed. "It's just that... Could you tell me what's Slytherin and the other Houses?"
Snape will still hate Harry but he will avoid taking points from him because he is a Slytherin. He threathens Harry to not be like his father, because then he would have to interact with him regularly. I will eventually make him a more decent person, because even though in the end he ended up being good, I'm still mad at him for bullying innocent kids like Neville, and taking out all his anger on Harry for being rejected by his mother and choosing his "enemy" instead. This is my personal opinion, I don't want to insult anyone with it, so if you like Snape I respect that.
"Well that's something a Slytherin would do," smiled the girl. "Getting revenge on someone who hurt you..."
"Good. I think only people with magical families should be allowed to join the school and the wizarding society. The others, they are worthless." he stated coldly. " Anyways, my name is Draco. Draco Malfoy. What's yours?"
"Erm... okay," he mumbled, still puzzled by this whole conversation. Why did they have to talk so weirdly? Sometimes they are so blunt, ignorant of others and their feelings, and then they start sharing some fascinating information, just to suddenly clam up. "I still don't get why you guys think so badly of Gryffindors though. I've never even seen you trying to talk to one of them."
So when he noticed a redhead walking towards the Great Hall, he happily waved at him. This caused Ron and his housemates - Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan- to stop in front of him.
"Eh, that's bollocks! Muggleborns are just as good as anyone else! And to answer yer question, Slytherin is a House in Hogwarts. There is Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Lot says Hufflepuff are weak, but I -"
"Now listen to me carefully," said Seth. "You can only enter the dungeon with a password, which you can't let any other House to find out. Currently, the password is Aconite, which is another name for wolfsbane. Got it?"
But the hat said, Slytherin is not equal with evil, right? And the witch also described it as ambitious and proud, not only as cunning.
"Welcome to Hogwarts," said a stern-looking witch. "The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before that, you will be sorted into your Houses. It's an important ceremony because while you are here, your House will become your family. The four Houses are Gryffindor, the House of the brave, bold and chivalrous, Hufflepuff, the loyal, patient and hard-working, Ravenclaw, the intelligent, wise and witty, and Slytherin, the cunning, ambitious and proud."
The class everyone was looking for the most was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell's lessons turned out to be ridiculous. The classroom and the professor smelled of garlic, and they didn't do anything exciting. Whenever Quirell looked at Harry he started to stutter more and become even more nervous than he already was - Harry could only wonder the reason behind it.
"They are entitled idiots who think yelling and doing dumb things means being brave," huffed Blaise, "there are also a bunch of muggle-borns with them, like the Granger girl who acts like she's better than us."
Once again, Harry couldn't comprehend the situation. But, with a sigh, he complied with the other boy's wishes, walked to him, and asked, "Can I come in?"
For any normal person, this statement would have sounded crazy. It would have made them stare in disbelief at the giant, who not too long ago literally bursted into his life. Any normal person would come to the conclusion, that this man is insane, speaking gibberish and threatening his family. But Harry wasn't normal, and even though he knew that it's dangerous to not only believe, but willingly go with the man, he still did that.
Ron didn't trust him. He didn't trust him, because he was believed to be a deceiving, vile person, so Harry turned on his heels and left.
"Every bad and dark witch and wizard once was in Slytherin. That's the House of the evil, the House of You-Know-Who."
"I guess it must be weird for you then. But it's okay. Because you're strong and wonderful..." he started which had the other groan.
So far Harry enjoyed his classes. On Wednesday nights, they studied the sky, learned about constellations and the movements of the planets. Three times a week they went into a greenhouse where they learned Herbology, and even if Harry wasn't particularly interested in plants, he still enjoyed taking part in the lessons. The most boring class was deemed to be History of Magic, which was taught by a ghost, who seemingly didn't develop his technique in the centuries since he worked there.
"Well, I'm honored to meet someone so fascinating like yourself, young Harry." she said, "Let me elaborate my peers and fellow housemates confusion - plenty of us think, or at least our families teach us, that pure-bloods are the most powerful people, including You-Know-Who. So now they are a little confused on how could a not pure-blood defeat him."
- and they cheerily waved back. He was sure neither of them fancied his placement, but the little gesture filled his heart with hope.
The weather was sunny and warm, sometimes a light breeze running through their hair, and they were sitting near the lake, on many soft, dark green blankets with weaved silver patterns in it. In addition, they also sat on green velvet pillows - because Malfoy and Pansy claimed they were too superior to sit on the ground - and they had a low-rise round table in the middle.
Harry still didn't know many things. But he knew one thing for sure: Draco Malfoy is going to be a problem.
It seemingly had the same effect on the others too - they all had calm, satisfied expressions. The atmosphere turned tranquil and dream-like until a certain blond decided to disturb it with his dramatic behaviour.
The said boy loved the attention, and Harry didn't know if that was the reason why he basically stalked him everywhere or had another motive which he didn't know of.
The snakelets have a picnic, Harry finds out more about the wizarding world, then awakes at night to the sound of sniffling.
They were in the dungeons, waiting for Potions, and Harry was curious to meet the man, who seemed to dislike him at the opening banquet.
"Back, Fang! Back!" opened Hagrid the door while holding onto the dog's collar. "Come in, make yerself at home."
It calmed him somewhat, but Harry wasn't an idiot. He knew Hagrid won't look at him the same anymore, and he could only hope that he will stay in his life.
So that's what he did. He started munching on some chocolate while he looked at the card which showed an older man's face, and underneath it was the name Albus Dumbledore. He was reading the card's description when a teary-eyed boy and a bushy-haired girl slid open their compartment door.
Then, he saw the approaching figures of three boys, two bulky ones on the side, end on the middle, a posh one with slicked-back hair.
"Harry," he said quietly, but before he could finish, Madam Malkin finished his robes, giving him a chance to escape the conversation.
When everyone finished with the song, Dumbledore started wiping his eyes, as if tears were in them, and Harry had to agree with the blond's statement.
He enjoyed the other boy's company, and the way they were able to maintain a light conversation, even if sometimes he stares a little too long at him, and visibly holds himself back from asking certain questions. But he doesn't blame Ron, since who wouldn't be curious about his situation?
His was at the end of the room, and to his annoyance next to Malfoy's. Harry draw in his curtains, but before that, his gaze connected with the blond's for the last time for the day.
It was the scariest one he could see in the whole hall - his body was pearly white, but his eyes were black, his robes were bloodstained and he was covered in chains.
Heads turned in his direction, questions and opinions were whispered in his presence and walking in packs like they were told to certainly didn't help his case since his pack so far consisted of a blond narcissist and his bodyguards.
"Well, someone has to spark up a conversation, why shouldn't it be us?" at his question, Malfoy just sighed, then drank the remainder of his butterbeer.
"Or it's just a trap to take more points from us, and that's why you stayed behind with Snape!" spat Seamus.
As Harry walked back to the castle for dinner - his pockets full of Hagrid's cakes that were more like rocks, but he didn't want to hurt the man's feelings - he thought about his week, and what's about to come.
"Of course I am, I'm always fine. Malfoy's are well-respected individuals, who others constantly envy because of their perfection."
"Erm... Well, I think I am a half-blood too," he started, which caused many around him to open and close their mouth like they couldn't find any words.
If his heart is brave or whatever, shouldn't he go there then? And why can he only explore his potential in the latter?
She was around two feet tall, had spindly limbs, and a head so big Harry wasn't sure how her neck could support it. Her round, watery blue eyes constantly shifted around the table, and her bat-like ears kept twitching at the smallest sound - she was alarmed. She didn't look exactly terrified of them, more afraid of the possibility of disappointing them.
Snape just shook his head and called them idiots before he decided to take 5 points from Gryffindor for their recklessness. Then he gave 5 points to Malfoy, for being such a great student.
"After you... after you became a hero, they sent you to muggles?!" the blond was severely confused, because if Harry Potter is so amazing, why did he have to be sent to those inferior creatures?
In this chapter I planned to show that Ron how easily could change his opinion on Harry. I'm not bashing him, but even in the books he turned against Harry a couple of times out of jealousy (like in Goblet of Fire), and their relationship is very fragile.
One of the ghosts passed Harry and stopped next to Malfoy, who didn't look pleased by the new company.
We've reached the end of chapter 1. I hope you liked it. This chapter is a lot like the book, and I obviously skipped many scenes (like the wand shop) assuming you've read the books or saw the movies. I wanted the main focus to be on have "bad" Slytherin is, and show his initial reaction to Draco, the "epitome of Slytherin". I also wanted to include him appreciating Ron and his family, even if they have barely met. From now on, canon divergence will take place, since Harry got sorted into Slytherin.
Neville ended up by the wall, with Blaise in front of him, both guarding the Gryffindor herbology books. Susan, Hannah, Pansy and Luna had made their own circle guarded by themselves, all with their heads in the center, Goyle, Crabbe and Millicent laid in line, leaving Draco, Ron and Harry in the center of their friends.
"Yes, really. Today we had an incredible DADA class and then I was going to invite you to Quidditch practice, Luna missed you too and Susan and Pansy said that without you their homework wouldn't have enough points. " Harry pulled away enough to see his face, he still looked very tired. "Why didn't you come back?"
, I can't wait to see your bare bottom" Draco is next to him, the wind drowns his voice very well, so Harry knows that no one else will hear what the blond said, but he listens very well, and he feels the broom slip off his legs, so he wobbles as he puts both hands on the wood to steady himself. And in just three seconds Draco holds the snitch.
"Same here, I don't know if I can stay on a broom without repeating the fiasco of first year." Neville's face was a little green at the memory of his injury two years ago. Blaise rubbed his shoulder.
Harry didn't see the point of anything, for him having a sleeping bag was an advantage that he hadn't had on summer nights when Uncle Vernon left him in the yard to sleep, sometimes he would wake up with sore bones and skin wet with dew. In his opinion, having to sleep with all his friends on the floor of the great hall was no big deal.
"Oh oui, I see that more people arrived in my absence." His voice was soft, graceful in a natural way. Not caring much about the new intruders, he sat next to Harry, while leaving the doors open behind him. "Je suis Draco, I just transferred from beauxbatons." The blonde smiled at the trio and it seemed like the heavy atmosphere never existed. Hermione looked quickly intrigued, with that look in her eyes that said how interested she was at new information.
The boggart was getting closer, but Draco could only focus on the white noise flooding his ears. His fear raised his wand, but before he uttered any spells, Professor Lupin stood in front of him, causing the crazed Draco to transform into the moon. The professor spoke the incantation, but Draco couldn't hear it, all he could process was the voice of himself going berserk.
All Hogwarts seemed outraged, and so began the most bizarre thing Harry had ever seen: the unity of houses.
"Wow, that was a very advanced incantation young man." An unknown voice surprised them from their reverie. The previously asleep man now seemed very awake. He had dark circles under his eyes, his honey-colored hair was slightly disheveled, but he seemed very interested in the two children in front of him. "May I know what year you are?" The man asked him.
The blue and gold tinted windows created little colored dots in the room as the sun rose, it was a very beautiful sight. Books were scattered on the plush floor, the walls were covered with astronomy scrolls with the black ink still fresh. The desks have enchanted drawers where Draco was able to miraculously store his supplies and clothes.
Unfortunately there was no food inside, but he found a thermos full of tea to reduce stress. He consider it for a few moments, but the dog's scared posture hadn't relaxed and it looked like it desperately needed sleep.
The field is empty except for them, but still the echo of laughter and screams is enough to create the feeling of fullness in Harry's chest, not all of them have played in an official school game, so there are some moves strangers that aren't quite legal, but nobody bothers to point it out. The snitch is still missing, but that only gives Harry a chance to hover alongside Draco while they distract each other. For a second Harry sees a figure on the awnings of the bleachers, but before he stops his broom a golden flash shines at the edge of his vision, it is the snitch, and Draco is behind it.
"Hermione! what is your problem?!" Harry stood in front of Draco "If even his father was that, he is his own person, just beating you in class doesn't mean he's evil!"
Harry was sure that the blonde and the redhead were pretending to sleep just like him, but the stillness was hard to break, especially with the prefects walking between them every two minutes and the magical echo of the dining room getting more noticeable than usual.
“Umm, I think that part depends on each case, because I found it to be a duel with all the rival suitors, but, I think that was discontinued thirty years ago. Well we can skip that part, next on the list is meeting both of their dads ... I mean, you'll have to meet Draco's dads, and if you can survive those two months of courtship and date with the approval of his parents, you are free to consummate your established courtship. " Ron finished with a smile.
"I need to tell you something," the tousled one spoke up before his friends started arguing again. Sometimes he didn't understand why they fought so much, it was funny sometimes, but with the prisoner of Azkaban on his mind, he felt an annoying oppression that prevented him from enjoying the return to the only place where he considered it home.
, what are you doing? The door is bewitched. " Uhm, he had missed his voice, and seeing him up close too.
" From his wand a scorching light came out, but not in an overwhelming way, it felt like a cool and safe retreat, the light momentarily blinded his eyes, but when it dimmed, the sight of a dragon with sharp wings made by light that eventually faded, greeted him.
“MISS GRANGER! You want in the name of Merlin, to explain why you are accusing a student of such a heinous crime! " Professor McGonagall had arrived, along with Uncle Sev behind her, looking more libido than the day Draco had used a month-long settlement potion on a peacock.
Ron snorts "You're right mate, anyway you enjoyed your friendship with a certain Ravenclaw long before everyone else"
"Uff, look, don't make this harder for me, buddy, I'm only doing this because it would be physically painful to see you embarrass yourself with Draco."
Harry rests a hand on his friend's shoulder. “I know, just, we will have to wait. Hopefully she sees the reason, but that doesn't stop us from enjoying our new friendships. " The green-eyed boy smiles tentatively at his friend, hoping to cheer him up.
"Terry, you don't have to if you're really scared." Luna's voice cuts through Theo's laugh, but he stands up straight and inhales deeply.
"I don't know dude, lately I think we never met the real Hermione. I never imagined that she could say all those things just because she was jealous. She was supposed to be the logic in our group. "
Dean and Seamus were explaining to Draco in detail what had happened to the portrait of the Fat Lady, to try to fill the anxious wait. "Why do you call her in such a degrading way?" The blonde wrinkled his button nose.
The room turned worried, everyone with questions about the killer and the dementors, Harry felt the weight of problems on him again. Annoyed that there seemed to be no break from danger, Harry just wanted to have a normal year, he turned back to the Ravenclaw table, making quick contact with silver eyes. The owner of those eyes smiled reassuringly at him, and Harry couldn't help but forget the killer. After all… they were safe at Hogwarts, there should be nothing else to worry about.
"I can understand why you wouldn't want us to know your last name, certainly people wouldn't have reacted well to that." Harry looks at his blond friend, his silver curls still looking unnaturally curved, in an always charming way. "But, even if your father were a Death Eater, Voldemort is dead and you are not your father."
"Right? She was lucky that Harry and Ron put up with her so much. She brings nothing but laziness… ”Professor Lupin arrives in the classroom and immediately claps his hands for attention, cutting off Susan.
“Very good, it won't affect your grades, only if you face it now. There is no one else to see it, and I'm afraid I have to be present to avoid accidents. "
s, where the boy about whom he listened to bedtime stories, whom healers whispered about when they wanted to be nice, and who he heard from his
“Very good, as you have proclaimed me the best friend of all. It's time for the serious talk. " Ron slumped against the wall, still scattered with the scrolls.
"Nah, don't worry, with lots of food and sweets you can afford it." Ron shrugged and smiled back. "We'd better hurry to the dining room, it's been three hours since I last ate and I already feel like my stomach is eating itself."
Harry didn't want to be mad at Hermione, but she made it difficult. She hadn't apologized to Ron for her opinion about purebloods, until Ron yelled in the middle of the common room that he was a pureblood and that if she was going to call him Death Eater then they couldn't be friends anymore. The black-haired boy was afraid of being between Ron and Hermione, but since she had detention every weekend in the morning with Professor Snape, scrubbing the cauldrons that were probably older than Dumbledore. She also had detentions during the week, after classes with Professor McGonagall, writing lines and repairing books that were about to go to dust. Harry didn't see Hermione much, and it also seemed like she was doing her best to hide from everyone.
Draco quickly stood out as he walked gracefully towards the bench, it was more than obvious that the blonde was not a freshman, all eyes were on him, curious, either for the name without a surname, for the strange aura that his person seemed distill, or its appearance.
Ron, James" And Draco went to hide in the greenhouses. But no one had to know about the tears of frustration that streamed down his pale skin. Just like he didn't know that his green-eyed friend was following him, only to be stopped by his red-haired friend. Both worried but divided.
It is four in the afternoon when everyone finally returns to the castle, everyone is still in a good mood, even those who took a bath in the icy water. Draco laughs at something Neville said while Luna walks with her binoculars on and Pansy makes sure she doesn't fall as they walk through the grass.
The others turn around as Harry's team goes behind a small hill by the lake to remove their robes. Firmly, no one is looking at anyone, although Harry turns to his left to see Ginny turning her body quickly away from him. The green-eyed man is surprised, but he quickly finishes and runs to jump into the lake, although the censorship spell continues, the wind still caresses him where there were clothes before, so he hurries.
They bend over to pick up the scattered tubers, but Draco waves his wand and those closest to him come immediately, they're dirty and wet, he doesn't want to get his hands dirty. Harry gives him a smile, but they are distracted by the half-giant's talk as they help him collect, when Hagrid invites them to eat fresh mashed potatoes, everyone agrees, eager to come in and ask their own questions.
Dumbledore from the teachers' table seemed to radiate pride as he ate sweets and not real food while talking to Hagrid, Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Snape, both in good spirits, so much so that it took Harry a while to process the sight of a Snape from other than indifferent or jaded.
Draco opens all the envelopes and stacks the pate on the lid, Quaffle is practically vibrating inside his bubble. He released a quick tempus, noticing that breakfast was almost finished, and more than one person would be concerned about his disappearance.
Harry knocked on the door, summoning all his Gryffindor-ish bravery. There were chances that Professor Snape was already up for dinner, but Harry had to try.
“I know, I'm still mad at all the things he said. I don't know if I'll be able to look at her again if she really meant that. Maybe… she already thought that, and Draco was just something that filled her glass and couldn't go on? " Involuntarily Harry stroked his untied tie. “All of that felt too long, like she'd been thinking about it for a long time.
His words took him on a tangent, one where his crazy aunt Bella's face was smiling at him. Even though Draco had never met her, he suddenly felt worse, because of Neville's parents, the war, the Muggles, and the dark lord's monstrosities.
The blonde felt the weight of the stares, he did not know what type they were, but he would never be degraded by a witch and less by one who lost her quills inside his hair and ended up bathed in ink all over his face.
"It's written there Ronald" The girl pointed to the plates "Honestly, it wouldn't kill you to be more observant."
"Ron challenges us to a game of Quidditch." Harry handed the note to Pansy, with Neville reading behind his shoulder. "Who's coming?"
"I don't know much about them. I know there are four, l'aigle, le serpent, le lion, and le blaireau." The blond numbered with his fingers, "Mother mentioned that le lion represents bravery, l'aigle intelligence, Le serpent cunning, and Le blaireau loyalty. My relatives who have attended Hogwarts have always been in Le serpent, they said the bedrooms were in the dungeons, so I don't know if I'd like to rank there because of that, it didn't open up much of a view. " As Draco spoke, Harry paid special attention to his accent when speaking in what he assumed was French, and was better able to see his eyes, which were a striking mercury color, with some ocean stains in them.
"Bien sûr, I was offered promotion to fifth year, but I decline." Draco waved his left curl with his wand, and Harry noted that it was very pretty, with the handle wrapped in a shiny silver thread, and a natural-looking rock of a semi transparent blue color. "J'ai confiance that my studies advance with the third year classes and with my own self-learning, if I accepted to skip so many years it would be a problem in the social aspect."
Sadly, he learned all of this from Neville, who learned from Draco. He still hadn't spoken properly to the Ravenclaw since that day, and although he didn't avoid it, Harry had stopped hearing his name from his lips, or any phrase that exceeded twelve words. But he could not fix it as quickly as he wanted, since there was a commotion through all the corridors of the school.
It never occurs to anyone that it might be a bad idea because of the supposed giant squid, or because of the cold Scottish air. Everyone nods, hoping to win and mock the losers.
Thanks to the excitement, no one realized that he stayed next to the wall and that he did not even go on to face the boggart. They were leaving the classroom and Draco was convinced that he had gotten away with it when the teacher called him.
"Draco, there's no need to be ashamed of something that scares us, that's why this exercise focuses on trying to laugh at what scares us." Teacher Lupin puts a hand on his shoulder, and it feels warm, unnaturally warm for a person.
Unfortunately for them, only one car was similar to what they were looking for, there were already two suitcases stored there, but only one person was inside, and they seemed too deep in the world of dreams to be able to hear them.
"Oh no, but I already look like a first year" Terry strokes his cheeks "at this rate my friends will never stop calling me baby badger" Everyone explodes in awws very touched.
… ”Draco hides his hands behind his robes. “I've been avoiding you because I was embarrassed by my father. Not everything Hermione said was entirely exaggerated. " The blonde has a frown, and rosy cheeks, but it's not such a satisfying sight because he feels uncomfortable.
?" Harry couldn't help but think about all the comments his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon used to make in room number four. As some people were mentally ill and that caused deviant behavior, which was illegal and wrong and they would go to hell ...
"Well Harry is the boy who lived, I read in the papers that your father is a Death Eater, so it's obvious that your family is trying to do work for the must-not-be-named."
"How thoughtful of you." Draco closed the door behind him. "In that case it is better that we leave so that we can have a good time when eating."
"Bibble, how did the task I gave you go?" After the reconciliation, Harry and he had talked about so many things that they had somehow ended up on the subject of gifts. His friend hadn't said anything explicitly, but Draco had a suspicion that something was wrong at his house. That was how the Christmas present for Harry had come to Draco.
Quidditch practice was always so strenuous that it made Harry want to merge with his bed, but it was hard to get discouraged if he eventually did something he loved like flying. Oliver always squeezed them until their legs buckled with exhaustion, although that was part of the charm. Normally the practice left him dry to the head, but this time even though his body demanded to collapse limp on the ground, his mind couldn't take a break.
"No um, I meant you know, if it's ..." Harry waved his hands "natural, um no, that sounds really bad, but you know, is it ...
His words quickly caught the attention and concern of his friends. "What's wrong Harry? Does this have to do with…" Hermione paused, as if to say Voldemort's name "Sirius Black?"
"What rehearsal will you decorate? I can't believe you decorate your homework for fun and I can barely complete it. ”The brunet pouts, and Draco smirks at how adorable the one in glasses looks.
"Sleep here? I thought we were students, not prisoners, these bags are not at the height of my bed. " Blaise reneged
Neville was the first. The next day after the incident, he went and sat next to Draco as if he had never had breakfast elsewhere, and for dinner, Millicent Bulstrode, with Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle were at the Gryffindor table competing against Ron to see who ate rolls of cinnamon faster.
"What? No, I'm actually grateful for what you two did. " Now Harry was the one trying to ignore the red color on his face. “You always find ways to distract me from my explosive thing, buddy. Great"
It frustrated him that even at Hogwarts, where they couldn't go even if they wanted to, they still haunted him in his mind.
Potter put a quick kiss on Draco muzzle, before putting him down. Draco rub his nose with both of his paws, his heart racing in his chest. Potter laughed a last time and left Draco alone. The last stayed dumbly there, on the carpet, trying to process what just happened. A part of him wondered if Potter was talking about him, well the human him, and that he unconsciously recognized him under all this white fur. But the other part, the more realistic one, doubted that he was speaking about him, and he really didn’t want to think about every single soul that crossed Potter and was undoubtedly worthier than Draco. But it wasn’t a big deal, right ?
He could see the cat eyes of Malfoy suddenly glowing in the dark, staring at him. Harry was laying on his back and Malfoy just inches away from his head. He knew he startled the cat, and now, he had to keep going.
A cry woke up Draco in a jolt. Confused at first, he tried to remembered where he was when an another cry, a louder one, shrilled. Totally awaken now, he realized that the cries where coming from Potter. He was agitated, and Draco had to jump on the side to avoid a kick. Without thinking, he went toward Potter and ,after a particularly hard jolt, started to meow, loudly. But he was covered but Potter screams now, and in the panic, Draco licked Potter’s face, his cheeks, his nose, his lips, anything to wake him up. Eventually, Potter seemed to be calmer, if not awaken. Draco saw the tears rolling down his cheeks, and he couldn’t come to terms to let Potter. So, he climbed on his chest, licking the tears. Once done, he started purring, knowing that he could be relaxing to human, and when he felt Potter’s heart getting back to a more normal rhythm, he knew it was the good thing to do. Draco purred so hard, that he was vibrating. Eventually, he felt falling asleep,
“Are you okay ? You look paler than usual.” He said as he cupped Malfoy’s face, searching for something, but all he saw was under-eye bags.
Harry did as told, and his jaw dropped a little. The pyjamas he gave Malfoy was a bit too large, Harry didn’t like sleeping in tight clothes, and his shoulder was exposed as well as his collarbones and the top of his chest. Like this, even with Malfoy trying to fix the top, Harry was able to see the faint of the old scar, light pink on his milky skin.
Opening his eyes, he found Potter’s face very close to his own, too close. He couldn’t help but notice how relaxed his figures were, how handsome his figures were.
Draco turned his look to Potter who was indeed staring at him, before realizing that the professor just talked about him.
Under his fingerprints, he was feeling a scar, a really nasty scar. As he travelled along it, stroking it so lightly he was barely touching it, he noticed that the scar started from the upper right side of the chest to the left side of the hip. Harry gulped. It couldn’t be, right ? It couldn’t be Malfoy. Of course, he didn’t know if Malfoy had the scar anyway, the scar Harry inflicted himself one and a half year ago. Snape healed it, he said he healed it and that it shouldn’t leave any scar. But the shape reminded him the trail of blood on Malfoy shirt, he couldn’t stop thinking about it. What if… what if he was stroking at the precise scar he gave to Malfoy.
But all young Malfoy saw, that if he helped with the reconstruction, maybe it will be the amend for Potter. Because, yes, Potter saved his life, thousand times, he saved him from prison and even saved his mother. So maybe, just maybe, Draco would be able to show him his gratitude, by rebuilding the only home Potter even claimed to be.
Draco heard Potter coughed, clearly embarrassed and the slytherin couldn’t hear more, he didn’t want to. He silently sneaked out of the common room and went to upstairs, and without thinking, he found himself in Potter’s room. What a mistake ! He didn’t want it, no he wanted to go to Luna’s room and maybe cried on her shoulder, or at least slept peacefully on her armchair.
“Here is Ma… Gnolia, Miss Granger.” The headmistress answered with a scowl toward the feline, who yawned. “He is, hum, a cat giving to me from a relative for … a couple of months.”
“We don’t have any news from him since a month, Potter.” Blaise answered eventually, pinching hip his lips.
how they were close, but to be honest, he just knew that they were waiting for the good time to ask this kind of questions.
Hermione glared at him, then left the common room, without a look for Harry. He though he should talk to her later, because he knew perfectly that when Hermione went to her dormitory, she just wanted to be alone. And he could relate because he started to feel a bit tired, and he had a feeling that Dean, Seamus and Neville would have too much questions to him that he would be able to answer.
His voice startled the white cat, who jumped, looking at Harry as he flattened his ears on his skull.
“What a lovely Kitty.” Harry whispered, feeling his heart in his throat. “You know, I would take care of you whatever will happen.”
“Ahah funny.” Potter grumbled, scowling at the cat on his chest before throwing his arms around him, trapping the cat. “Caught
“I never meant to fool you.” Potter whispered, getting closer to Draco. “I kinda felt guilty, because even knowing it was you, I couldn’t stop wanting to pet you and all. Worse, I-… I wanted to be more around you and hug you, and not only because I had less nightmares since we sleep together.”
Before leaving the 8th year common room, he said a word to Hermione, saying he would go seeing McGonagall because the headmistress asked him to.
“Alright, see you then, Harry and don’t forget, we have charms first this morning.” She gave him a smile, before returning to her book.
"Yeah, we could do that!" agreed Ron casually, which made Harry smile. "I don't know when though... erm we have classes together, we could collate our schedules... Oh, we have double potions together right?"
At first, Harry thought Ron and Hagrid just overreacted, that they were biased by their own beliefs, but the more he heard about Slytherin, the less chance he saw at being any good in there. But surely, he won't be placed there, since he wasn't an arrogant, vile person, and only the evil goes there.
The blond narrowed his eyes at him, then continued with an impatient tone. "They say Harry Potter is in this compartment. Well, are you him?" He had an expectant look on his face, demanding Harry to answer instantly.
"Yes, but are you really that dumb? You knew I was not okay, I'm still not okay! You should have asked me once more then tell me it's okay if I'm not fine, but tomorrow it will be different because I'm strong and wonderful..." he sniffed once more, then retracted to his bed.
"Well, we better go to breakfast," he looked at Malfoy whose eyes were narrowed, " and then we will meet up sometime again, right?"
"Are you kidding me?" he whined. Harry squinted, but couldn't see anything other than the boy's form in the dark.
Then, they went to Transfiguration, where Professor McGonagall proved herself to be the strictest teacher so far, and Harry has only seen her display a small smile when at the end of the class Blaise managed to be the only one with a successful transfiguration.
Harry tentatively looked at him, looking for a sign of an ulterior motive, but he couldn't see anything other than the boy's calm expression.
"Whether you did or not, it happened. If you don't want to, you don't have to get revenge, but don't let yourself get pushed around."
"Yes, you are snakelets! Little, cute but fierce baby snakes!" she exclaimed cheerily. "This is how we refer to our first years." but before she could go into more details, Seth interrupted her.
Harry was sitting on the Hogwarts Express, chatting away with his new acquaintance, when a smiling woman slid back their door and asked if they want to buy any snacks. He noticed the longing gaze Ron shot towards the cart, and he quickly understood what it meant. From their earlier conversation, he found out that the boy's family wasn't exactly rich, meaning he couldn't afford any sweets. Since Harry himself just recently came into his inheritance, he knew exactly how the ginger felt, and he wanted to change that.
If these elves could do magic and were capable, intelligent creatures, why did they only work as slaves? Surely, there were other jobs they could have done. But Blaise said it's their life goal? Harry himself had to do the chores at the Dursleys, and he wouldn't want to do that for the rest of his life and view it as the biggest honor in the world.
"Oh no, it's their life goal to serve until they die," he tried assuring Harry, not succeeding at it. "They think it's an honor. Most pureblood and wealthy families have them, they are handy creatures."
Malfoy’s cat ears flustered, but he didn’t move and started purring again. How cute, Harry couldn’t believe how cute Malfoy was. Eventually, he felt himself falling asleep, two last thoughts crossed his mind. First, he was happy that Malfoy was here, meaning he didn’t hate him at last, and second, he could be used to call him Kitty and that was cheesy as hell.
“Don’t worry Harry, I think he kinda likes you, right ?” Luna asked Draco with a particularly good scratch, which made him almost purr, almost.
McGonagall nodded back and took a simp of her tea. Harry left quickly and checked the time, he had still the time to go to the Great Hall and have a quick breakfast.
“As if.” Draco answered with a snicker. “You’ll hear it from me, I promise.” He added with a soften voice.
“I heard that a former Death Eater was with them.” Seamus suddenly appeared, offloaded of his own bag, Dean just behind him.
He was, as usual now, awake way before Potter, spreading out on the whole width of the bed. He rubbed his back against the sheets. Not in satin, he noticed.
The second surprise welcomed in the 8th common room, situated in the Astronomy Tower, them with a indignant meow. On a pile of cushions spreading on one of the couch where a white cat with shirt fur and bright grey eyes, visibly bothered by the sudden apparition of a bunch of young people.
Potter opened his arms in a row and Draco jumped. He tried to get up but his legs got tangled with the sheets and he lost his balance, falling on the floor, head first.
He was getting closer and, his hand brushed against Draco long fingers. Draco was sure his heart was about to jump out of his chest and ran away. He never felt so furiously flustered, happy and shy at the same time. Sodd it, he never felt shy since he was like four.
Harry kept eyeing at the cat, who was looking at him with so much disdain that Harry found it surprisingly funny.
However, nobody came for Draco, surprisingly. And when he heard steps of several people in the stairs, he just turned into a cat and went under the couch. He would not ease their job, but a the first students flowed inside the common room, he realized he had been dumb. If ever professor McGonagall asked him to get out, everyone would see him crawling out from under the sofa and it would be so humiliating, especially in front of Potter. Moreover, Pansy and Blaise would never let him live after that.
Draco was using way too much energy this morning and he was starting to get hungry. He went down to the kitchen, sneaking in and stole some fish, okay the house-elves
Suddenly, Draco felt tired, so much tired. A lot of things happened in a short amount of time, a lot more that he was used to for the past three months if he was honest, and he was still in his cat mind sometimes, he just wanted to nap.
“ I’m glad you feel better Draco.” She said with a smile. “We are going for a butterbeer at Hogsmeade, do you want to come ?” She asked then Potter, unless it was directed to both, but Draco wasn’t sure with Luna.
The beginning of the summer was so chaotic - with the trials and the inheritance of 12 Grimmauld Place - that he realized only recently that his attraction for the youngest Weasley had faded. After some awkward kisses and long even more awkward silences, he was relieved when she started to avoid him most of the time. Eventually, one evening after dinner, they agreed about that they shouldn’t go back together. Their relationship had stayed at
Draco meowed happily, Luna always was so kind, even when she was prisoner in his dungeon, she was trying to comfort him, when he was supposed to be the one doing it, by reading her books and bringing her clean water. As he took place in the cushions, Luna took her stuff and, just before she went to the bathroom, she turned toward the white cat.
But Draco didn’t move, maybe he should juste go back to Luna’s room. Yeah, he should definitely do that. There was absolutely no way that Potter needed some stupid cat because he had some nightmares, he was the Savior, he needed no one. As he was about to turn around, the door opened behind him.
"You even sit together in Potions, I bet you asked Snape to have Harry as your partner for the whole year," teased Blaise.
A full chapter! This will remain similar to the book, canon divergence appears after this, so bear with me until then.
He talked about his lesson - acting like everyone's life depended on it - and Harry just couldn't understand what was this man's problem.
"I've read a lot about you, you know I bought extra books for background reading, and you're in many of them, like the Modern Magical History...." she continued with her speech, unconsciously making the atmosphere tense. ..." anyway, you two had better change, I expect we'll be there soon." And with that, she grabbed the shy boys arm, whose tears stopped the moment he heard Harry's name and could do nothing else than stare at him, and they left together.
Yes, Hermione was a know-it-all, and sometimes her eagerness towards learning was outright obsessive, and she loved to correct others, but Harry didn't think she was terrible. She had good intentions, and during Potions, he heard her help other students, which prevented even more catastrophe than what already happened. Overall, Harry found her okay, sometimes even entertaining.
"Not only did you leave alone, which we were told not to, you also met up with Weasley? Planning this behind our back, sneaking out, while we were just waking up?"
No one dared to say a word, and the Gryffindors looked annoyed, but a few Slytherins - including Malfoy - just smiled and waited patiently.
Harry looked at the blond. His eyes were puffy and red, his lashes wet and cheeks rosy and tear-stained. Yep, he definitely cried.
As it turned out, Malfoy was actually surprisingly good in Potions, in fact, Snape told everyone to look at his perfect technique.
"Now, what's important is," spoke up Gemma, "that Slytherin's have a reputation, and you have to keep that up. We have to stick together, even if some conflict happens between us, even if that's a rare thing. If you have some problem with each other, you have to handle it in the privacy of the dorms, and not in front of the others." she looked over them with a stern look. "We don't want points taken because of a silly argument, and we have to show how loyal we are to each other. As first years, you also need to note, that the others are often prejudiced against us. They think we are nothing more than liars, but it's not true."
"Well, yeah. I'm not used to sharing a room with a bunch of people and I've never really been away from my parents."
She then went on with all the details, how are they going to live, the point system, and the House Cup. During this, Harry became more and more anxious. Where will he be sorted into? Hufflepuff sounds nice, but Harry isn't really patient or hard-working. He had pretty good grades in his muggle school, but is he clever enough for Ravenclaw? Gryffindor seems to be the best, and he doesn't think of himself as a coward, but would he fit in there? And Slytherin, cunning, ambitious, and proud? He tricked his cousin a few times, but would that count as being cunning? He also doesn't really have any ambitions other than move out from the Dursleys as soon as possible and make ends meet. And he's not a prideful person, since there isn't much for him to be proud of. Sure, people say he defeated some Dark Lord as an infant, but it's not like he remembers it or intentionally did it.
"Now, we need to set a few rules before you enter your dormitories." started Seth, "First, the head of our House is Snape. As Slytherin, you have no reason to be afraid of him, "he smirked. "But it's still better to not play with fire, okay? He is a strict man, and he usually doesn't take points from his own House, but let's not play with our luck."
In this chapter I wanted the snakelets to have some fun, and Harry to ask logical questions, like why would they need servants if they can do everything with magic, or hate the Gryffindors even though they never talked to them. The answer is simple: that's what they were taught. And why would an 11 year old question anything their lovely parents told them?
Harry looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was peacefully drinking from his cup. The witch- Professor McGonagall he learned - was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Quirell, in his purple turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, and sallow skin.
"Moody, are we?" grinned the blond boy. "You know, after the train I thought you are going to be just some stuck-up, arrogant little
On top of it were many dishes, from roasted duck and smoked salmon to rice pudding and cakes, all served by their assigned house-elf, Solly.
"He has to be mad," whispered Malfoy. "There is no other reasonable explanation for this." and his comment, almost, just almost made Harry's lip quirk up at the ends.
"Simply that you're obsessed with him," rolled his eyes Theo, "You're with him all the time, breathing down his neck and acting as you own him."
"Okay, well we could talk or whatever I guess," Harry's eyes lit up as Ron mumbled the last sentence.
So that's how he ended up at Diagon Alley, in Madam Malkin's Robes shop, standing on a stool next to a pale, blond boy.
He ended up buying some of everything, returning to his seat where Ron stared at him with a shocked expression. He visibly swallowed, then blushed and started to unwrap his sandwiches.
Said man entered the room, his hair still greasy, and immediately started taking attendance. When he got to Harry's name, he looked up - his gaze dark, which made Harry feel uneasy, and he knew, the man didn't dislike him. He straight up loathed him.
"You think... you think you are a half-blood?" asked a pug-faced girl, who had some weird name like Penny? Paisley? No, something like Pantsy...
Draco stared at him dumbfounded, clearly surprised that somebody rejected him and his stupid handshake. His eyes were wide, and a pink tinge appeared on his pale cheeks. Some moments passed until Ron's quiet laugh brought him back to reality, and he clenched his fists at his sides.
"Hmm," said a small voice in his ear. "Difficult, aren't we? Plenty of courage, and not a bad mind either. You clearly have a talent, and oh, "it stopped for a second, " you would like to prove your worth and potential, wouldn't you? You aren't overconfident, but you know that you are better than how you've been treated so far. Interesting... where shall I place you?"
"Oh, this is Crabbe," Draco pointed to his left, " and this one is Goyle. And I'm Draco Malfoy, but you already know that." he finished with a smirk.
Don't take it the wrong way, Vince and Greg turned out to be quite nice people, who Harry could easily chat with. They were a little slow, but so far the only problem with them was supporting Malfoy's stupidity.
"Potter, you might be friends or whatever with the Weasel," Malfoy mocked, "but Gryffindors and Slytherins are enemies. That's how things work."
"Yes, but my mother is many of the few, who got sorted into Slytherin as a muggle-born. That's how my parents met," she replied quickly like she tried to justify herself, for no reason.
"I would never," he said. "And I can see why you don't like Slytherin. At first, I didn't understand why did I got placed there... and I still don't. The hat said, that I have the heart of a Gryffindor, but I have potential in Slytherin." Hagrid hummed in response. "Some of the students live up to the bad reputation, "he remembers when he heard a fifth-year girl planning to blackmail a Hufflepuff to do her homework the whole year," but there are actually kind ones. Gemma is a prefect, and she helps a lot, and always makes sure we have everything we need... but Snape completely fits the stereotypical Slytherin." he then told about his encounter with him.
Many Slytherin's hands shot up, but the only Gryffindor student who seemed to know the answer was Hermione.
"Gryffindor, everyone in my family belonged there so far. Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff would be fine too I guess, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin." he visibly cringed.
They entered the Great Hall, and to avoid the stares of the older students - he had enough ogling since he arrived at the wizarding world - he chose to look at his shoes.
"Evil?" huffed the hat. "They tend to be little tricksters, yes, and plenty of them have choosen a dark path... but being a Slytherin is not equal with being bad. They are so much more than that. Joining the House doesn't mean you are going to be mean, and cruel. Would you let them influence you badly?" he asked.
"Well, that's what I planned..." mumbled Harry. Was this easy for Ron to view him differently, just because some talking hat didn't place them together?
After each shout, applause filled the hall, until a girl named Millicent Bulstrode got placed in Slytherin.
Harry frowned at him. "Well if I sit at the table consisting only of the best, then I don't know what are you doing here." he said.
"We know things she could only dream of," Malfoy smirked. "Spells, which are not even taught at Hogwarts..."
Between the classes and getting settled in the new world, Harry barely had time to talk to Ron. So on Friday, he went to breakfast a little bit earlier, leaving his companions behind, in hope to talk to him.
"Yeah, I get it." Harry didn't get it. He never had a mother or a parent figure in his life. Sure, he saw how aunt Petunia looked at Dudley, and how she acted around him, but he didn't know how would it feel he would get that kind of attention. He didn't know the feel of a mother tucking you in at night, making you your favourite breakfast at your birthday, taking care of you when you are sick. No one ever showed up at mother's day for him, even though he always made a little present for Petunia.
So far it seemed only the blond boy, what was his name? Oh yes, the blond boy Draco seemed so far to be the only one who didn't despise said House, moreover he wanted to be placed in it.
"Well don't you want to be appreciated? For your current abilities and achievement even if they happened in the muggle world?"
"Is he..." he wasn't sure how to put it nicely, "Is he perhaps short of a marble?" he asked uncertainly.
