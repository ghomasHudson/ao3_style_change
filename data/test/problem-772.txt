Draco wrinkled his nose. ‘You can answer those four thousand questions.’
‘Blimey, look at you.’
‘He must be a very good curse breaker,’ Hermione murmured, sounding impressed.
Draco scrunched up his nose. ‘I’m not setting foot in that atrocity of a tea house.’ But he got to his feet all the same, taking an apple with him.
‘Should be easy enough to counter if the base of the spellwork is still the same,’ she went on.
‘You were thinking it!’
And he had told Hermione that – more than once. Two months after it had all blown up, Harry had come to accept that Ron had said and done some horrible things to him, and he had accepted that it was perfectly okay to not want anything to do with his ex-best friend right now. He’d always known why Ron had said and done what he did, he’d been friends with the man for years and lived through this sort of thing before – though not to this extent – and he understood that the vitriol had been aimed solely at Harry (well and Draco) just to hurt. Harry was well-versed in Ron’s need to lash out when he was hurt and angry and this time Harry had the capacity to stand back and be objective and feel the hurt Ron was inflicting and recognise that he didn’t need that in his life.
‘Oh, we can,’ Harry assured the junior auror – Draco was starting to think his name might have been Mullens? Madigan? Merry? Eh, it wasn’t like it mattered. Draco was sure if he ever did need to know he could just find out from Harry who, because he would be sitting the new and revised auror exams come June, would likely end up outranking the junior auror from the get-go.
He wasn’t disappointed.
Harry glanced down at the page and Draco saw the moment he realised there was no way he’d be able to make the potion with his (no longer totally) abysmal knowledge at Potions. Harry’s shoulders slumped and he dropped his head to bang it on the desk. He might have improved greatly over the summer with private lessons with his mother, but Harry still struggled with a lot of the basic concepts. The detriment of five years of antagonism between Harry Potter and Severus Snape was going to take more than two months’ worth of private tutoring with Narcissa Malfoy to overcome.
‘Try again,’ Marigold snapped.
Harry nodded. ‘She’s actually not so bad.’
The chintzy mug had been Harry’s idea, explained away as a muggle thing that he knew Andromeda would appreciate.
Fred was laughing and joking even as the wall blew in and –
Harry nodded. ‘Bill was first to bring it up but Robards and Kingsley pushed for it. If Draco sits the exams it’s another thing to show that he’s working hard to shed the title of Death Eater and that he’s earned his place working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.’
It wouldn’t last long but he didn’t need it to. He just needed time to get the debris off her and whisk her away to the Hospital Wing and Madam Pomfrey.
‘Why?’ Hermione questioned, sounding intrigued.
She couldn’t hurt Harry though. She held her tongue when the hatred boiled inside her and she played nice, and she was nice because there were moments when she saw Draco for what he really was and that wasn’t the boy she’d known.
When Harry finally returned, she thought she understood what it was she was missing. She didn’t realise it would only leave her sure she was missing more.
He gave Draco a gentle nudge with a socked foot. ‘Come on, I know you’ve noticed.’
Draco frowned and then glanced across the Great Hall to the Gryffindor table. Luna was seated with her back to him but when she felt his eyes on her, she glanced over her shoulder and looked at him questioningly. He shook his head and dropped his gaze back to the note, stuffing the letter back into the envelope before slipping it into his bag with the care package from his mother.
‘You asked Pansy Parkinson for advice on what to get Malfoy for Christmas?’ Ron sounded incredulous and Harry glanced up to see his eyes were wide with surprise. ‘What the bloody hell for? Just get him some fancy chocolate or something.’
Another voice cut in before she could scold him further. Snape’s drawl was just as scathing as Draco’s when he said, ‘I assure you, Draco, it would never have come to that.’
Harry, Hermione and Weasley skidded to a halt at the end of the corridor, beating McGonagall who was only moments behind – though she arrived at the other end from Harry and with Professor Sinistra at her side.
Hermione gave him a wry smile but contradicted him when she told him, ‘Harry’s actually rather good at it now. He’s been seeing a mind healer for months. Draco helps too.’ She’d added that last bit out of spite because she was mad that Draco was invading her thoughts and knew that Ron wouldn’t take the mention well.
He winces as soon as he says the words, but Ginny takes great pleasure in snarling, ‘We got very drunk at George’s birthday party and had sex in the bath.’
He shook his head. ‘It would be better if you weren’t here when he wakes up.’
He’d never realised Hermione had it in her to be so ruthless. He probably should have.
‘Uh…hi?’ he ventured, frowning at her when she dropped enthusiastically into the chair opposite him and then just looked at him.
‘Oi!’
Joseph nodded and there was something about the way he was looking at Harry that suggested this was exactly the kind of moment he was looking for. He and Harry hadn’t been paying any attention to the lesson at all, Draco hadn’t heard more than a handful of words about the shield charm they would be using – he doubted Harry had either. Joseph was counting on it, Draco concluded. He was counting on the fact that Harry hadn’t been listening, he was hoping to use this moment as an opportunity to knock Harry down a peg or two and get him to listen in class while cementing the other students’ respect.
Well, and Harry. That was a friendship he hadn’t seen coming but definitely supported. Much like Harry supported any friendly and positive interaction between him and Hermione. Which was why Draco hadn’t stood up and walked away now that Astoria was gone, and he was woefully aware he would soon be missing dinner. Not that he thought Harry and Luna would leave without him until they knew for sure he wasn’t coming to meet them. He actually suspected Harry would come looking for him shortly if he didn’t turn up and he contemplated sending a patronus, but he wanted to go out and eat and he did not want to be stuck in the library discussing his skills as a student or teacher with Hermione Granger.
And Draco had smiled. He’d felt much more like himself, much more in control. Enough so that he’d managed to say, ‘Thank you.’ Although, he wasn’t sure how much of himself he’d recovered because he’d also offered an olive branch in the form of, ‘Sorry Harry was an atrocious boyfriend.’
This was a very dark chapter to write and, weirdly enough, one of the easiest to write. There are things implied here (and implicitly stated) about Ron that form a small part of a larger picture so don't give up on him just yet. I love Ron, but he has his moments and breaking his friendship with Harry is really important to me because sometimes you need to break things before you can build them back stronger.
‘Did you believe her?’
It was easier now that they’d broken up and he was with Draco to be honest with Ginny about what he was feeling, easier to explain something without the feeling that he was disappointing her. He disappointed Draco sometimes, of course he did, but it never left a heavy feeling of dread hanging over him, and it was happening less and less as they learned to be a couple. Honesty was a big part of that; they had no secrets and because they had no secrets, Harry could talk freely with Draco. Draco had seen him at his absolute worst and at his best. He’d seen the scrawny kid in too big clothes who had no idea what he was doing, and he’d seen the soon-to-be-fully-qualified auror confidently commanding respect and battling dark wizards.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘My parents know,’ Draco added softly, noting the way this definitely surprised Granger.
His father had looked long and hard at the large dog stalking the edges of his cell and nodded just once, as though he too understood what he was seeing. At the time, Draco hadn’t paid much attention to the reaction because Harry had stepped through the cell door moments later and his father had looked just once between the two of them before he’d sighed deeply. It had sounded so much like exasperation that, in his confusion, he’d almost missed his father’s annoyed words entirely.
Hermione made it a point now to hug him every time she left, which he thought meant she understood and supported him but didn’t know how to help, which was weird, but he wasn’t about to turn down a nice hug. He needed more hugs, more positive touches in his life and he thought it was time he let Hermione be one, when she truly had been by his side for all the good and the bad. He thought it was time to let her in because she had been there, and he was becoming more and more aware that the changes he’d made to his own life over the months she was in Australia had left her feeling adrift from his life.
Draco gave a tiny nod and felt the sob rising up in his throat. Once he would have held it back, once he would have been horrified by the weakness. Instead, he turned in Harry’s arm and buried himself against his boyfriend’s chest and just let the tears come.
Draco conceded the point. ‘McGonagall?’
‘Hermione!’ Draco tried to sound betrayed, but he was laughing. He was laughing with Hermione Granger and Ginny Weasley over a breakfast that he knew he’d have paid for even without Ginny declaring he owed her. It was truly astonishing how much his life had changed (for the better) in the last eight months.
‘Honestly, Ron!’ she snapped.
‘He never once beat you to the snitch, Harry,’ Ron pointed out as though that made his point.
Draco nodded, expression not changing even if he was feeling a little alarmed at the idea that they only had eight months to put together some sort of plan. At least with Burbage Hall he had a full year on top of that to sort out the finer details. There were a lot of things he’d need to look into, a lot of things he knew Hermione would want to research, and he thought he might want to draw Andromeda and his mother in for help, he imagined a lot of what they were doing for Burbage Hall could be applied to Hogwarts as well.
People had died because of him. Some of them by his own hand, some because of actions he took or didn’t take. This was where he belonged, in this cell for the rest of his life, the guilt of his actions fuelling his thoughts and his soul, slowly draining him to madness until eventually there was nothing left. Until eventually, sleep would claim him, and he would simply not wake.
So she watched and watched, and she saw the way Malfoy looked at Harry and she thought maybe she understood why he was trying so hard to pretend he had changed but she didn’t, and she missed it completely – much like she thought Harry had missed it because even in his obsession he could be oblivious. Only she’d stumbled across them kissing so tenderly in the entrance hall and it had taken her so completely by surprise because she’d suspected Malfoy’s interest, but Harry’s had completely escaped her.
Harry glared at Draco in the mirror. ‘I know, the man never met a problem he couldn’t solve by throwing money at it.’
He was a pureblood. He was a Malfoy and a Black and the blood that ran in his veins was deeply magical, centuries upon centuries of power coursed through his veins and of course that made him better than people like Granger. How could it not? How could all those centuries of proper breeding and education and carefully cultivated magic and connections not stand up against someone as common as Granger and her vapid thirst for knowledge stolen from books?
Harry read the question there and answered as if Draco had spoken. ‘The whole of wizarding society is built on nepotism,’ he stated. ‘I don’t think it really occurred to me until just now but back before fourth year, before I really knew anything about the Ministry or how our government functions – which it doesn’t, but also why weren’t we taught that? – it didn’t occur to me that Arthur knew practically everyone in the Ministry – and they all seemed to owe him bloody favours.’
And then Draco smirked, a private look meant solely for Harry. ‘It’s him.’
‘Harry,’ Ginny’s voice was quiet but sharp, her touch gentle but unforgiving. ‘You need to stop.’
Draco nodded. ‘Give me your hand. I think if I use you to boost the spell I can send it through the entire corridor.’
Draco didn’t know what to think. He and Astoria had never talked much before, she was two years below him and as such he knew her as well as he knew every other pureblood family. There’d been no reason for her to seek him out, no reason for her to smile at him when she caught him looking at her over breakfast.
He’d barely even noticed when they arrived at the little dock. Barely noticed the way his legs shook beneath him or the way he’d brushed off the proffered hand and sympathetic smiles of the guards. He’d just had to get away. He’d apparated without any clear understanding of where he was going – which was terribly dangerous in its own way – but he hadn’t been able to clear that terrifying sickness that had come with the realisation that to Albus Dumbledore, Draco hadn’t meant enough to save him, not until the very end, not until it no longer mattered. He couldn’t shake the disgusting feeling that he’d been just as much a pawn to Dumbledore as Draco had been to Voldemort.
And it was easier to focus on the idea of paying Draco back in the form of an extravagant gift than it was to focus on the ever-growing feeling that what belonged to him belonged to Draco and vice versa. It all just hit a little too close to that whole marriage thing and the one time Narcissa bought that up, he and Draco had had to go and spend a few hours apart until the panic had subsided. Luna found the whole incident hilarious, she still enjoyed bringing it up when they got too sappy but Narcissa had only rolled her eyes. She did continue to talk about him as her son-in-law but strangely that didn’t set either him or Draco off.
It took everything he had not to simply slide into bed and hide away from the world. But he refused to allow them to take away his life with their harsh words and their jinxes and curses. He’d paid his dues, done his time, was slowly but surely working toward making up for all the wrongs he’d committed. Hiding away from the world in his dormitory wouldn’t make the hate go away, it would just let them win.
To Harry, it would never be enough. It was just unfortunate that, what it came down to, what he knew deep down was necessary, was that Draco needed to be punished for his crimes. Even if only to show the wizarding world that the new Ministry Kingsley was trying to build took a firm stance on Death Eaters and Dark Wizards. Compared to all the other Death Eaters and supporters the Ministry had captured (although could you call it a capture when the Malfoys had all willingly surrendered?), Draco did have it easy.
It certainly felt like his own would never stop.
He crowded closer to the Ravenclaw, herding him back against the stone wall beside the door to the classroom, scattering the students who’d been leaning there. Harry didn’t stop until the boy’s back hit the wall. He didn’t smile at the pained yelp he made as the welts from Harry’s hex hit the stone, but he knew if he glanced over his shoulder, he’d see Draco’s lips tic up in the beginnings of a satisfied smile. Harry took no satisfaction from the boy’s pain, he just wanted him to understand how serious this was.
‘It would mean a lot to Mother,’ Draco murmured.
‘Yes,’ she answered.
Over Granger’s unruly hair, Harry mouthed, ‘Common room?’
Draco cut him off before he started asking questions and getting angry on his behalf. ‘Not now.’
him. Surely you know that.’ He spoke calmly in a low tone so as not to be overheard but he took a moment to cast a quick privacy charm too. He wanted to convey just how serious he was about this and didn’t want to worry that he was betraying Harry to random strangers. It was bad enough he was attempting to explain things to Hermione and Ginny, although he knew Harry wouldn’t mind.
Confused, Hermione looked between them before asking what they were talking about. Harry tried to explain about their game of “what-if” but the more he said the deeper Hermione’s amusement got until she was giggling uncontrollably, and he trailed off in embarrassment. It had been a lot easier telling Ginny who, while amused, had also quite enjoyed offering up her own suggestions – most of which were horrifyingly real possibilities.
Weasley gaped unattractively at them and it seemed as though he was about to stomp off to the Gryffindor table alone when Granger arched a brow and he seemed to deflate. He sank down onto the bench beside his girlfriend and although he shot a glare at Malfoy, he didn’t speak another word about the morning’s seating arrangements.
He should have known Harry wouldn’t let him get out of lunch
Again, probably shouldn’t enjoy that so much but Harry oozing power and being destructively protective ticked all of Draco’s boxes. If he wasn’t so tired and sore from sitting in the cold, he might have shown Harry just how much when they got home. But he was really tired and stiff, and the best Harry was likely to get was a good cuddle and some half-hearted groping. Although Draco didn’t imagine Harry would be in much of a mood for sex either, given all the spellwork he’d been doing had probably left him feeling a bit drained.
Hermione opened her mouth to protest, to ask just what on earth Hannah had meant by that – or where she’d even gotten such a thing – but she didn’t know what to say. It had nothing to do with that (it did, though, in ways she wasn’t sure they were ready to confront), but she couldn’t because maybe Hannah was right, that it could just be as straight froward and succinct as that.
‘Like what you see?’ Draco drawled.
? Hermione didn’t know what she was supposed to do with this information because that definitely didn’t fit with the Malfoy she knew.
Ron’s awkwardness over Harry’s wealth was probably the only reason he didn’t think it was weird Harry was talking about his and Draco’s plans for their money together. Though, he probably didn’t even realise that’s what Harry was doing. He probably just thought two wealthy heirs were griping about having too much money in too many places.
It hadn’t been the first time he’d found himself eating at the table with Molly and Arthur without any of the other Weasley children as a buffer. Before that morning, grief had hung so heavy over the table that Harry had always found excuses to leave and scurry up to his room. Over the weeks and months, as he’d spent more and more time with them, he’d grown comfortable with the idea that they really did consider him family and with Ron off in Australia, George finally starting to spend time at the shop with the gentle encouragement and support of his friends, and Ginny off at a quidditch training camp (trying to make a name for herself before the scouts came looking), Harry had found himself as the only one home for breakfast that morning.
Draco gave him a dry look. ‘I do so love how you made that sound like it will be you in those vaults sorting through paperwork and having artefacts evaluated.’
Draco shrugged. ‘Fifth year when Umbridge was compiling evidence against both Harry and Trelawney.’ After a moment of consideration Draco shuddered and said, ‘I hated that awful toad, but I hate that she didn’t have it all completely wrong.’
‘Yep.’
Harry stood on the garden path, just inside the gate, muggle pants, dragon-hide boots and a simple t-shirt. His hair was a mess (as usual), his wand held in a loose grip by his side. He had a grin on his face, carefree, somewhat bemused. He looked happy. Draco stood before him, in his own muggle pants (the snug dark jeans), heavily spelled dragon-hide boots, a jumper he realised he’d stolen from Harry (one of the new ones he’d bought him) with his wand clenched in his teeth. He had one hand pressed against Harry’s chin, tilting his head to the side, while the other painted blood runes on his neck.
And then Draco could wait no longer. He held tightly to Harry’s shoulder and let the pull carry them both away. He had no idea where they were going, Hermione could very well have been right – in all likelihood she was right – but Draco had no choice but to follow the summons. The last glimpse he had of the warmth of the Burrow’s kitchen showed worried Weasleys and the shiny brightness of a patronus.
‘I’m glad you gave up on me,’ he told her. ‘Either I would have succeeded, and Voldemort would have breached the wards to get into a Hogwarts where I’d murdered Dumbledore, or I’d have failed and Voldemort would have killed me and my parents.’
‘Now shut the fuck up and go to sleep.’
‘There’s a garden here,’ Draco answered. ‘Not as big obviously,’ he added at the same time Harry said, ‘What?’
‘I did think about it,’ Draco informed him rather tersely, ‘and that’s why I’m telling you it’s a bloody stupid idea.’
He’d stayed with Draco until the sobs had trailed off into sleep – not a restful one because sleep in Azkaban was never restful – and then he’d called for the guard and slipped out of the cell.
Draco’s outrage tried to pull a smile out of Harry, but it was hard because he really didn’t understand how he’d so completely misjudged Ron, how any of them had. ‘I wish I’d been there to see Molly jinx his mouth shut.’
Smothered in a tight motherly embrace, he’d only been able to squint at Arthur over her shoulder, his nose squished into the knot of her apron string. Arthur had still looked a bit stunned, but he’d managed to pull it together long enough to offer Harry a soft smile.
‘We might need to hire someone to kill off whatever that is,’ Draco mused, unperturbed.
Hogwarts needs healing.
He had to give Robards some credit, though, the man didn’t cower, although he did ease back, sliding his chair away from the desk to put as much extra space between him and the heat coming off Harry as he could.
Ron snorted, looking somewhat relieved, even if he still seemed confused. ‘Malfoy’s a crap player, why didn’t she just ask one of us?’
Harry didn’t bother with a chair, instead he climbed up onto the end of the bed, carefully lifting Draco’s damaged foot into his lap. Only it wasn’t damaged anymore, rather it was completely healed. And Hermione had been in class. The sun was up, and it had stopped raining.
He didn’t even try to supress his smirk on Monday morning when he and Luna finally emerged from his dormitory. He hadn’t planned the timing, but he and Luna stepped out just as Weasley and Longbottom emerged from the room they’d share with Harry and the look of surprise (and confused horror) on their faces was well worth it.
Harry shrugged, unrepentant. His reasons for keeping this from her hadn’t changed. They didn’t know Draco, not this Draco, and Harry hadn’t wanted to risk losing them because he loved Draco.
Like tracking down the only remaining portrait of Harry’s grandfather and pages full of anecdotes just to give Harry some connection to the family he would never have the chance to know.
‘Git.’ Harry playfully shoved him.
‘Speak for yourself,’ Ginny grumbled. ‘I’m flat broke but you owe me for putting up with my brother after you apparated out of the kitchen with Harry yesterday.’
He’d told Harry all the things he thought he’d never have, and Harry had shared his own. How he wanted a wife and kids, how he wanted a warm home with mess and chaos like the Weasley’s. How he wanted the kind of life he’d never had growing up.
Harry grimaced. ‘Do I want to know why?’
Ginny shrugged. ‘I’m a Weasley, I can always eat.’
‘Oh, Draco,’ Hermione sounded unfairly impressed with his gift to Harry, but he didn’t have long to dwell on it before she was asking him questions in a rapid-fire fashion.
Mustafa merely nodded when Harry called back their findings and instead of sending the team out in a line behind them, he set them all up along the boundary (with a sizeable gap between each team – nobody needed to blow anybody else up) and they started in on a long sweep.
It was unfortunate that Herbology and Charms were the only two classes he could count on the professors to treat him fairly. Although, he thought the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher was at least attempting to remain impartial, Draco could see his resolve slowly being chipped away by the rumours and comments he heard cast Draco’s way. Professor Joseph might be qualified to teach at any number of magical schools, but Draco didn’t think he was qualified to teach at Hogwarts where all but the first and second years had fought in the last battle. He’d been safely tucked away in the mountains in India researching something Draco hadn’t cared enough to learn about. Tucked away as he was, he hadn’t felt the effects of the war. By all accounts, he’d come back to England after ten years, surprised to find out how bad things had gotten.
And that was a conversation he didn’t look forward to. He wondered if Kingsley’s offer of her own Wizengamot seat would soften the blow when Hermione realised that in order to bring the wizarding world into the future, they were actually taking a bit of a step back and bringing in some of the old laws that had been overturned after Grindelwald came to power.
She gave him what was probably supposed to be a wry smile but was all grimace instead. ‘Some of it is.’
Harry nodded. ‘She said she could see it.’
Ginny had snorted. ‘Yeah, that sounds like you.’
Draco made a soft sound of disagreement. ‘You can’t stop everyone from hating me, Harry.’
Harry laughed softly at the way he stood straighter, sticking his chest out when he spoke. ‘Yep.’ He held out a gloved hand for the boy to shake. ‘What’s your name?’
If Draco were there, he’d have raised an eyebrow and asked when exactly Harry had ever concentrated on his homework. Harry tried his best to ignore the deep ache of worry and concern and focused on the cards, lest Draco return to find Harry sans eyebrows. The arse would likely refuse to be seen with him until they grew back. It would be like the Great Wardrobe Argument of mid-August.
Salazar, hadn’t Weasley and the twins once had to rescue him from a locked and barred room? How were these things taken so easily in stride?
At this Harry nodded. ‘You really do.’
‘No,’ Harry informed her. ‘I don’t blame you for trying to save yourself and the other students.’
. She’d stuck a muggle post-it to the cover directing him to what she felt were the interesting bits.
‘I got an owl from the healer assigned to my parents last night.’
Mustafa gave him another nod and turned his attention to McGonagall as she began to speak. Draco glanced at Bill and Fleur and was amused when they both winked at him. He rolled his eyes, but he knew his lips had curved into a smirk when he glanced back toward the Slytherin table to find Harry grinning at him with a stupidly proud look on his face. Luna was pressed against his side giving Draco a look that suggested pride, fondness and oddly enough (though it was Luna) a sense of exasperation that it had taken people so long to see Draco’s worth.
‘I told you how I’d never had friends before Ron.’ Harry was staring up at the ceiling, but his murmured words were for Draco rather than himself. ‘By fourth year I had Hermione and I guess Sirius, but I was still so alone. Losing Ron then was like losing the only family I had and in some ways it was the same last year. I had Hermione but half my family had just walked away and I didn’t know if I was ever going to see him again.’
‘What does Malfoy have to do with your clothes?’
The way the two were smiling and sitting up so straight made Draco think of an eager puppy waiting on its owner. It wasn’t an especially nice thought, but it was accurate. Draco at least had the decorum and self-respect to not show just how happy he was to see Harry back at Hogwarts.
‘But that’s what makes it so fascinating!’ Hermione declared enthusiastically, adding sugar to her tea. ‘I’m assuming there isn’t any spellwork in place to connect Harry’s tattoo of Sirius to the Dark Mark.’
Draco pulled a face. Not at Longbottom or even Harry’s advice but at the mention of the Three Broomsticks. He still owed Madam Rosmerta an apology, one he wasn’t all that confident in giving and one he knew for certain would be poorly received. He’d be steering clear of the Three Broomsticks for the foreseeable future. His plans to meet up with a visiting Pansy were to be at the Hog’s Head. At least he was sure of his welcome there.
‘I don’t think this is because of the war,’ Draco replied. ‘At least not because of this one.’
Draco watched as Harry’s eyes turned milky white and started to smoke before they cleared up and were once more the beautiful green he was known for. Harry shook his head and pulled a face.
‘Malfoy,’ Mendenhall greeted, voice deep and husky from decades spent smoking. ‘Time to go.’
It was the pastel pink hair and (highly fashionable) muggle clothes that threw her.
‘Okay,’ Harry says, taking a deep breath. ‘I get it, I’m sorry.’
‘Salazar you’re serious,’ Pansy said when the silence stretched and he didn’t crack a smile and laugh it off.
Harry considered this but it was Luna who provided the answer. ‘I think that’s probably because she’s the only one who hasn’t been in a position to see you work – or watch you lecture Harry,’ she added, amused.
One of Draco’s legs had been bent on an angle that might have hurt terribly if he was in any shape to feel it. His hair was thick with blood, his jaw bruised and obviously dislocated. His clothes were wrinkled and damaged, his feet were bare. Most of the fingers Harry could see, hanging down off the bed, were broken and bloody.
, standing on Platform 9 ¾ and Ron wasn’t even there. It had been a massive mix-up with the delivery of their items via international portkey being delayed and then Hugo had gotten sick and instead of them having a nice family breakfast to celebrate Rose going off to school, there’d been a kiss and a hug at the door, Hugo looking green and here she was, standing on the Platform looking around at all the other parents and trying to put on a brave encouraging face for Rose who was so nervous and doing a marvellous job of hiding it.
‘Never,’ she snarled. ‘Never, in all my time at Hogwarts…’ her anger had her trailing off, struggling to find the words she was looking for because this had been happening in her time at Hogwarts and Draco could see how hard she struggled with that knowledge. ‘Get rid of this spell,’ she ordered, rather unnecessarily. ‘I want this floor thoroughly cleared of any spell work that is not of the castle, I want everything that is not of the castle cleared,’ her words were an angry hiss as she lunged forward, falling gracefully to the floor in cat form. She shot them both a final sharp look before she sprinted away.
With trepidation she followed Malfoy through the house and into the kitchen where there was a tall, broad shouldered man with black messy hair standing in front of the sink washing glassware by hand. He was wearing grey joggers, his feet jammed into worn looking Ugg slippers and a black t-shirt with, she saw, when he turned around, the logo for a Quidditch team.
Draco’s mouth stretched wide into a smirk. ‘When did she say that?’ he asked again, prodding a finger into Harry’s ribs.
‘I’m pregnant, Harry,’ Ginny whispers and for the first time since he stepped through the floo he realises Ginny is scared. She’s twenty-four years old. She’s at the top of her Quidditch game, in the midst of a truly spectacular career, being pregnant, being a mum could ruin that.
By the time they walked away from the stall, Harry was left considering that even with his muggle education prior to attending Hogwarts, the children in that man’s family were far better educated than Harry and possibly even Draco, who had been getting some extra tutelage prior to Voldemort’s return.
‘Yes,’ she murmured in return, ‘I’m beginning to see that.’ She pushed to her feet then, a determined look on her face. ‘Come on then, let’s go back upstairs and get ready for breakfast.’
‘That’s not the point, Draco,’ Hermione rebuked sharply. The look she gave him was a curious mix of regret and something that he though was loathing but he didn’t think it was directed at him. he hoped it wasn’t. ‘I know we all expected him to be upset that it’s you but it’s not up to him to decide who Harry wants to be with. And it’s certainly not up to him to decide the gender of that person. As long as Harry is safe and happy what should it matter?’
Nobody needed to be flushed and a little turned on while lying about trying to finish homework. Strange to think accidentally reading porn while sitting around with his friends was preferable to the other book he had stashed away in his bag – another book retrieved from the Lestrange vault that liked to burn the hands of anyone not allowed to read it. He made a concerted effort to keep those books away from Hermione, knowing how much she’d hate knowing there were books she couldn’t read.
‘Nah,’ Harry mumbled into his pillow. ‘Keep drawing.’
Granger scowled at him. ‘I did this to protect them from Voldemort,’ she told him shortly. ‘He’s dead, the war is over. They can come back now.’
too long, everything is sort of dulled from the hip down, but his toes are almost completely numb. He gets sort of pins and needles sometimes but not much else.’
Harry hadn’t disagreed. He also hadn’t really talked about the words the Weasel had thrown at him, choosing to focus on the feeling of abandonment over the concern he didn’t really know his friend if he could spout such awful hate. Privately, while Draco had never expected the Weasel to shout homophobic slurs at his best friend, he’d had seven years of Weasley matching his hateful words with hate of his own, so he couldn’t exactly say he didn’t know Weasley had it in him, just that he’d never expected that hate to be aimed at his best friend.
(A small part of Draco acknowledged they’d brought this on themselves by disrespecting Joseph, but he couldn’t quite work up the energy to be guilty.)
Hermione burst out laughing while Harry managed an offended, ‘Hey!’
‘Trust me, Granger,’ Draco said coldly locking eyes with Dumbledore’s hideously smiling portrait. ‘I would have no trouble killing Dumbledore now.’
But Harry wasn’t quite ready to leave yet. ‘I’ll be going with him any time he goes out,’ he informed Robards. ‘You do still want the man who killed Voldemort working
It was a horrible feeling to realise that after four months of missing his friends, he wished they’d never come back.
‘Fuck! Fuck. Fuck,’ Harry hissed. ‘Merlin, it’s cold. Shove over.’
There’d been something in that moment, though, something in the easy way Molly and Arthur included him in their family that had brought the words bubbling up out of him and he’d just sort of blurted it all out.
Harry had dealt with that revelation the same way he dealt with everything he didn’t know how to comprehend and simply pretended it never happened. Draco supposed that revelation had probably made it easier for Harry to be the bold Gryffindor and finally make a move when he realised he wasn’t as straight as he’d always imagined, but that had been months later.
That had been the start.
‘I want to include housing for students who don’t have safe homes to return to,’ Draco told him softly. ‘I don’t think what happened to you should happen to anyone else either.’
‘Yes,’ Weasley snapped sharply, almost possessively.
‘But don’t think for one moment,’ he went on fiercely, ‘that any of that changes how much I love Harry. I never once asked him for forgiveness because I don’t deserve it – I don’t know that I’ll ever deserve it but the choices I’m making now, they’ve made me someone Harry has come to love and I’m going to fight every day not to lose that. I’m going to fight every day to be the man that went against everything he once believed in to earn Luna’s love and Ginny’s friendship and if you’ll let me, I’ll fight every day to be the kind of man you can call friend.’
How strange now to realise how few that actually was.
‘Doesn’t it?’
Draco looked around and noticed for the first time they weren’t alone. A dozen members of the DMLE were ranged around the cottage just beyond the limits of the wards. They all had their wands in hand and were waiting on Mendenhall to give them the go ahead. Mendenhall for his part, was waiting on Draco.
‘This is much more impressive now I’m not half dead in Azkaban,’ he slurred. He didn’t know how much of that Harry even understood but the soft puff of air that hit the top of his head might have been a laugh. He wouldn’t know. Nose pressed into the delightfully soft skin of Harry’s neck he finally let go and allowed his body the dark emptiness it had been craving.
Hogwarts was over a thousand years old. She had magic of her own that was woven carefully and lovingly into her very walls and floors and they found evidence of that everywhere they went on the fifth floor. Several times, Draco got distracted by the spellwork, Harry another couple. It took them hours to carefully sweep through the corridors and classrooms of the fifth floor, marking spells and enchantments they would need to come back to undo. They didn’t find any more lust spells, thank Merlin, but they did find a boggart lurking in a dusty cabinet in what, judging by the motif painted on the walls, had once been an astronomy classroom.
Maybe Ron wasn’t the only one who needed the mind healer.
Because what did you buy the super-rich posh git who had everything (material) money could buy?
Azkaban had wrought Draco bare. It had stripped him of his control over a lot of his emotions, taken away the masks and barriers he’d always hidden behind, the ones that came from his father and the arrogance he’d always been told would give him the power he needed. Without those masks, without that control, Draco had cried. A great weight had lifted from his chest and his heaving sobs had brought tears to Harry’s eyes.
‘Yes, you did,’ Hermione reminded him – he’d said so not minutes ago.
‘We’re going to come over for Christmas dinner.’ He cleared his throat. ‘We promised your mum, you know she’d kill us if we didn’t at least come for that.’
‘Anyway, by the time he got out of Azkaban the Ministry had found a way he could work off that last part of his sentence. There are a lot of things Voldemort and his Death Eaters left behind. Cursed houses, objects, places, all sorts of things, some of them dating back to the first war. Draco’s the only Death Eater they can control who isn’t locked up or dead. He knows a lot about the Dark Arts, and he’s got the Mark on his arm that lets him just walk through a lot of Voldemort’s wards. When they find something really dark or that they think is too dangerous for the Ministry curse breakers, they take Draco.’
‘He always was rather good at Potions,’ Hermione agreed, eyeing Harry with a look that suggested she would like to use this as an opening to ask more important, leading questions.
‘For a long time, Hermione,’ Draco explained patiently, ‘you and the Weasel were Harry’s entire support system. You were all he had in the world for
At which point Carter managed to demand an explanation in the form of, ‘But he’s Draco Malfoy!’ while his sister was nodding in wide-eyed agreement at Harry and their father was finally taking notice of the meeting taking place practically beneath his table.
Harry nodded. ‘It’s not the first time.’
After some careful probing and some unsuccessful spellwork, Draco was left with little choice but to perform a controlled break of the wards.
The knowledge that Percy very likely had ulterior motives regarding prisoner rights and a better and fairer Ministry, had soothed the blow to his ego somewhat.
Harry grinned. ‘I’ve never seen Percy look so annoyed.’ He sobered. ‘He’s the only reason you got a trial so quickly.’
‘Well, that’s one more that I didn’t know,’ said Bill, looking at the positive. He glanced back at his brother and Marigold before he asked, ‘Any chance there’s a doorway in the wards you can let Charlie through?’
Draco was impressed he even managed to keep his footing.
Comically, she almost collided with Madam Pomfrey, as they tried to take the corner at the same time. Pomfrey only offered a vague apology as she scuttled around the headmistress to get to the gaping hole and her buried patients.
As far as the wizarding world will ever know, it started months before that, in a bathroom at Hogwarts. There was blood spilled, curses thrown, and a ghost screaming murder. The story they’ll tell will point to this moment. It’ll twist details and paint an interesting version of events that others will question but accept.
‘We’ll know,’ Harry assured him. ‘There’s no way Hermione won’t come right to us demanding an explanation for why she’s suddenly being asked to sit on the bloody Wizengamot and make decisions for the rest of the wizarding world.’
They’d live in the Manor for the year while they made the final preparations before all three of them moved into Grimmauld Place where they’d begin the entire process anew. Mother seemed rather enamoured with the idea of renovating a Black home and had hinted that perhaps she might like to stay there when they’d finished clearing out anything Dark and dangerous and – because Draco had been there, and it was horrible – brightening the place up a bit.
He still fell asleep, wand in hand, as he protected Draco. This time at least, when he woke, it was to the familiar smell of the Hospital Wing and soft fingers trailing through his hair.
‘Athena is leaving Master Harry’s dinner alone,’ he snapped.
‘I need to talk to Draco,’ she demanded and swept around him.
‘Thank you, Kreacher, I’m starving.’
Something about the way he’d said it, about the clear way the simple fact of his feelings (and who they were directed at) annoyed him, caused Arthur to chuckle and Molly had finally released him to smooth back his hair and brush some imaginary lint from the shoulders of the old t-shirt he’d been sleeping in.
But she’d been there when he faced fiendfyre to save him in the battle.
He’d be meeting the terms of his parole, yes, but he’d also be gaining skills to be used once his parole was over. Robards was suggesting he had a proper – paid – place for Draco within the Department of Magical Law Enforcement at the end of his release. And if Robards was suggesting it then Kingsley no doubt knew about it.
Harry grinned. Draco felt the way his lips tugged up into a smile where they were pressed against his bare shoulder, just above the tattoo of the stag and Luna’s moons.
It was a sobering thought. He remembered another moment in a robe shop when he’d so desperately wanted to impress a messy-haired boy in too-big clothing and promptly screwed it up spectacularly by letting his own embarrassment and hurt get in the way.
‘Magic is always full of surprises,’ Draco reminded Harry. ‘But yes, I think that giving students a place to learn about magic from a young age will mean that muggle raised wizards like you don’t feel like an idiot for not knowing the plant life might eat you.’
Draco loved Harry now. He’d had time to change and learn, but the Draco from just a few years past with the opportunity to have his parents safe and whole and those pureblood ideals? He knew himself and his love for his family well enough to know just how differently he would have turned out. Take away all the blood and death and meaningless torture and he’d have stood by them, he’d have seen no reason not to reconcile his past beliefs until he was toeing that pureblood line again.
Either way, Harry looked to be ready to tear the poor junior auror to pieces for not being able to release him and Draco honestly just wanted to go home. He tuned out their conversation (if you could call Harry’s vicious dressing down a conversation) and concentrated on the cuffs behind his back. He was familiar with their design, both as a prisoner of the DMLE and as (in the loosest definition of the word) an employee. He knew exactly what runes had been used to build them, exactly what made them impervious to magic and consequently, exactly how to unmake them.
Luna had slipped down onto the bench beside her and started up a conversation quickly, introducing herself and explaining she would be happy to talk any time Astoria needed to speak to someone and didn’t want the bother of writing it down.
Draco followed his gaze and could only stare in confusion at the tattoo of Sirius. The giant dog stood, hackles raised, and muzzle pulled back in a deep warning snarl. No sound issued from the ink on Harry’s arm but both he and Harry had heard it all the same. Harry looked up and they shared a bewildered look before Draco’s entire left arm burned hot and he couldn’t control the agonised cry that escaped him. The pain drove tears to his eyes, and he stumbled back from the table, almost knocking Molly off her feet and very nearly tripping over the chair legs as the chair toppled backward in his haste. He clutched his arm to his chest, trying not to shriek at the unexpected searing agony.
She got her wish a week into their return and it was everything she’d viciously hoped and completely horrible and she wasn’t that person. She wanted to put the war behind her, and she wanted him punished but this – this pain and blood and the completely unprovoked nature of the attack didn’t sit right.
When he’d pointed that out to Robards, the gruff head auror scowled at him and snapped, ‘I know Potter. Why do you think I assigned Winthrop and Mendenhall?’
Draco rolled his eyes and pocketed the wand, suitably unimpressed. ‘Good luck with that.’
And, fuck, he’s about to be even more of an asshole, he thinks, but he needs to do this, and he needs to say this, and this isn’t at all what he planned when he came through the floo. It isn’t at all how he thought this conversation would go and he needs to talk to Draco about it, can’t go making life changing plans without including the man that is his life, but it could work.
‘Pomfrey said you’re healing well, even with all the damage those jobs for the Ministry cause you,’ Harry murmured, voice suddenly sober.
‘Because I want to spend Christmas with my boyfriend.’ He watched his words register with Ron, watched as he recoiled as though Harry had struck him. His whole face turned red, the colour sweeping up his neck, ears burning, and he took a deep breath, opened his mouth, no doubt to start yelling, and Harry was braced for it, but it never came.
After a long tense moment, Molly eased herself completely into her chair and Arthur put his paper down. They exchanged a look, heavy with meaning and unspoken words, and Harry had been just seconds from bolting out of the house and never coming back when Arthur had cleared his throat and broken the silence.
Bill might have volunteered to train Draco up as a curse breaker because he was important to
Malfoy looked at Granger and his smile was full of amusement this time, like he had a huge secret that he was bursting to share but this one needed the right kind of moment to share. ‘What do you say, Granger? Up for some tea with an old friend?’
But that didn’t mean she didn’t wish she could still hate him. That she didn’t wish she could pretend he was still the boy who had put Katie Bell in St Mungo’s for months.
‘No,’ answered Draco distractedly, he’d gotten his boot lodged in what he was dearly hoping wasn’t anything worse than a rusty old muggle animal trap. About the only thing coming between him and a severed ankle was the truly remarkable spellwork on his boots. ‘Remind me to invest more money in George’s shop.’
and the end of a war.
And now, here she was, cornering him in the library, spelling them into privacy and demanding explanations he wasn’t even sure he owed her.
‘Obviously.’
He’d known before he even set foot on Platform 9 ¾ that coming back to Hogwarts would be hard. He’d known that so many of the things he’d done and was doing to redeem his name would go unnoticed by most of the wizarding world and he was okay with that. The choices he made now weren’t about anyone other than himself. They weren’t about living up to what his father expected of him or the things his mother had always wanted for him. He was no longer making choices based around the Malfoy name or what it meant to be a pureblood wizard.
‘I would never have thought otherwise,’ Draco assured him, trying to not to grin at the annoyance on Harry’s face now that he’d realised Draco had been attempting to soften the blow with talk of his plans for the Manor.
‘Is that really necessary?’ McGonagall demanded. ‘He’s cooperating.’
‘You should go on a date with Ron,’ Harry told her, not so much because he wanted to encourage any sort of happiness for Ron as he wanted Hermione to be happy and he could admit there was a part of Harry that got the feeling once Hermione and Ron actually started to communicate as a couple that they’d realise what a disaster it all was.
‘What?’
Draco had met the Dark Lord before the school year began and finally there was someone who could and would stand up and fight for pureblood rights. Who understood the rightful place of those with ancient blood and power and prepared to forcibly take control. Those thoughts aligned perfectly with Umbridge and her control over the school, with the way she displaced that old fool Dumbledore and punished Harry like no other teacher had ever punished him – even when Harry had earned those punishments.
‘At least I’ve had a relationship,’ Harry pointed out.
Thankfully, Draco was quick on his feet and not pathetic at lying to Harry’s friends (or anyone for that matter). His, ‘Harry was suggesting blackmailing the goblins at Gringotts into letting him access his money,’ was a lot more believable when stated clearly in his matter of fact arrogant tone.
‘Bloody hell, I’m in the kitchen,’ the other voice called back with exasperation. This voice sounded familiar too, but Hermione couldn’t place it.
There was a darkness creeping over the Manor, the feeling of the house magics was changing and the way the house elves were acting… There were tiny little niggling thoughts that meant nothing to Draco because he was a Malfoy and his parents loved him and his Dark Lord was powerful and he didn’t need those doubts or uncertainties because how could his father be wrong? His mother?
‘Of course,’ Hermione startled. ‘That’s actually a brilliant idea.’
‘I can do that.’
‘Can you save it?’ Winthrop asked, her voice a horrified whisper. Harry had once seen her deal with a body in pieces that were somehow still alive but seeing the dragon like this seemed to have hit her much harder than anything else she’d seen.
‘But he’s not just Harry anymore,’ Hannah pointed out to Hermione quietly when she found herself talking the whole thing through with the Hufflepuff after Ron had left her by the fire and gone up to his room. ‘He’s Harry Potter, Boy Who Lived, Chosen One, Saviour of the Wizarding World. He’s living up to the hype that’s always surrounded his name and instead of quietly stepping out of the limelight and completing the sweet little fairy tale picture of living happily ever after with his best friend’s little sister, he’s living the dark and gritty, sexy tale of enemies to lovers with Draco Malfoy, ex-Death Eater.’
‘I am mad and hurt it’s Draco.’ He hesitated before he said, ‘It took me by surprise – Harry liking blokes – and I didn’t handle it well, but I never meant for him to think I hated that he was bisexual. I never meant for it to become this big messy thing. But I hate Malfoy, Hermione, I don’t think I’ll ever be able to forgive him, and I don’t understand how you have.’
Draco didn’t much care if the first person creeping out of the dormitories at the crack of dawn saw them, he had nothing to hide. Harry wasn’t ashamed of him and he wasn’t ashamed of Harry. He loved Harry and it didn’t matter if whoever it was thought he didn’t deserve it or considered it to be a spell or potion, it wasn’t any of their business.
And that didn’t even touch on the whole bisexual thing. Harry had no idea where Ron stood on that. It wasn’t something they’d ever really talked about. No one they knew growing up in Gryffindor was gay (and Harry was perfectly aware this was on them and not an accurate take on the Hogwarts student population) and so it had just never been something talked about. Dean and Seamus had been the first to chime in talking girls, Neville always shy but willing to offer an opinion and Ron torn between being horrified by Dean’s relationship with his sister and the desire to proudly boast about his relationship with Lavender. Harry had been oblivious to his own desires, so he’d been just as willing – if terribly awkward – about talking about girls.
Ron had still said the words. He’d meant them in the moment he’d said them and that was enough for Harry. It had been a bit of a wakeup call and now that it was edging into February, now that he’d spent over a month without Ron in his life the truth of the matter was, Harry didn’t
She snapped her mouth closed and instead of asking him about it, gave him an approving look. Which turned into a sharp look of disapproval when her gaze met Ron’s again. ‘See, if Harry’s managed to get all his homework done around all of his other commitments, you can certainly get yours done when you’ve nothing else to worry about.’
‘You did choose him over me.’ Ron sounded defeated again and Hermione wanted to roll her eyes all the while she wanted to reach across the table and take his hands and reassure him that she’d never choose Draco Malfoy over him.
Harry hummed disbelievingly but he didn’t argue. Draco glanced down at him to see he’d closed his eyes and looked to be drifting off. He was wondering if he should get up and run, leave Harry to sleep, when he noticed the runes were standing out clearly on Harry’s skin. Which was odd because they hadn’t been there when they went to bed. They hadn’t even been there by the time they returned to Hogwarts. Draco had assumed Harry had washed the off with a quick charm before anyone could see them.
‘I don’t know,’ Harry answered honestly. There was no trace of pain in Harry’s words, only a soft sadness that seemed well on the way to healing. ‘I want to say it matters but I don’t think it does.’
Draco tried knocking Harry off his feet again but the Gryffindor took control of the movement, seizing his chance to tangle their feet and drag Draco down with him. There was a brief fight to gain the upper hand which ended with both of them lying on the floor in a tangle of limbs, each with a wand held at the throat of the other.
On his bad days, Draco didn’t think he’d been punished enough. Today was a bad day. Draco would take risks and push himself further today, feeling that the punishment was deserved. The fear that Draco would push himself too hard and too far out of guilt and regret was terrifying. The fact there was little Harry could do about it was so much worse. He just had to hope that Draco came home and that whatever abuse he’d take on this job for the Ministry, that it wasn’t more than could be healed. At least physically. Mentally and emotionally, Draco had such a long way to go. His recovery was much slower than Harry’s, the guilt and remorse he felt weighed so much heavier than Harry’s own regrets did.
He underestimated her. Because of course he did.
Granger looked at Draco steadily, a strange quirk to her lips as she said, ‘Not your type?’
At 7am on a Saturday morning the Great Hall should be quiet, the only people up so early the unfortunate quidditch team who drew the early morning training slot or some of the OWL and NEWT students already beginning to stress. Instead, every prefect, all the eighth years and teachers were gathered together. The restoration team had joined them, and Draco was unsurprised to find he recognised none of them. There were a dozen house-elves as well.
Ron’s, ‘I’m surprised the ferret could keep up with you,’ had been only a brief observation before he’d scowled and answered his own supposition with, ‘Suppose he learnt those spells being a Death Eater.’
‘Well, they’re not wrong,’ Hermione murmured.
‘Take them off,’ Harry ordered. ‘Now.’
Draco gave Harry a wry look, letting him know just how stupid a thing that was to say. They both knew that nightmares could be terrible. How many times had Draco woken Harry with screams and tears? How many times had it been the other way around?
‘He went with Dad to the Ministry this morning,’ Ginny informed him. She gave her attention to the new card castle she was building for a long moment before she turned to look at him, expression light. ‘Let’s go get breakfast and you can tell us what happened before you have to go and give your statement – Harry didn’t say much before he left with Dad this morning.’
Harry, idiotic and susceptible to guilt that he was, looked briefly sheepish before he rallied and gave her a shrug. ‘I didn’t know I was going to go until about five minutes before we left.’
Draco didn’t mind. He’d come a long way from the hesitant way he’d first held Teddy, all caution and fear that he would drop him or break him. Now he was perfectly at ease manhandling the baby just as Harry did and well-practiced at quickly stabilising him. Balance was not something Teddy really had a grasp of yet, but he’d recently started to get good at shimmying his body along the floors in a pre-cursor to crawling that had poor Andromeda scrambling to baby-proof her small house.
‘I just never even realised this kind of magic existed,’ Hermione went on, ostensibly ignoring Ginny. ‘I just thought it was all fairy tales and people being poetic.’
Sixth year was one of them.
That didn’t sound right, how could they have only had thirty-nine if there were almost four hundred? Four hundred... ‘Merlin, that’s more students than Hogwarts has had in total each year since we started,’ Harry blurted out, eyes widening as he looked to Draco for confirmation.
‘When did she say that?’
Eleven-year-old Draco did not need eleven-year-old Harry Potter with his ugly clothes and his stupid scar and the way he gloried in his fame and got the teachers fawning all over him. Draco was smart, he was rich, and one day he would be just as famous as Harry so there was no need for a friend like Harry Potter. He had the right sort in Crabbe and Goyle, he had the power and influence in Slytherin already because of his name and that was exactly what a Malfoy should want.
‘We’ll split the floors,’ Mustafa declared, watching McGonagall dispatch teams throughout the castle – though not before she checked that they had a firm grasp on the detection spells they would need. ‘Weasley, you’re used to working in dark tombs – you and the missus can take the dungeon to start. Sweep them, map them, and move on up to the ground floor.’
Ginny could only shrug. ‘I wouldn’t say he was atrocious. But looking back I’m pretty sure there were a few times he was thinking about you while we were snogging.’
She was even more terrifying than Mad-Eye Moody (whom she’d helped train) had ever been and consensus in the DMLE was that a great many people had only survived the war because of her. She reminded Harry a lot of Neville’s grandmother (a close friend, he’d been unsurprised to learn), though he wasn’t sure if that was a good thing.
‘In all its arrogance and cruelty,’ Draco murmured bitterly, raising his glass in mock salute.
happy. He was content. Here on a lane (in what he could actually only assume was still a part of England) in the cold, wearing a pair of fancy spelled wellies Draco had handed him for the occasion, Harry could see the rest of his life spreading out before him, Draco a shining star to follow or lead (depending on the occasion) and it didn’t matter what they were doing because they’d be together and anything that happened, they would face together.
Draco didn’t need Hermione in his life and given just how well Harry had functioned those four months she was in Australia, Draco knew Harry didn’t need her either. It was a uniquely freeing feeling acknowledging that Hermione’s role in Harry’s life was optional – so different to the role she’d once played in which she was half of Harry’s support system and one of the only things keeping him tied to… Draco didn’t want to say life, but he didn’t know how else to put it.
Hermione knew she was gaping, but she didn’t know how to stop. She knew people changed but this – this wasn’t change this was something else entirely. He looked amused and attractive and she was horrendously aware all the sudden that she was creeping up on forty, was starting to get a little soft in the middle (she’d had two kids, alright?) and her clothes were boring and functional and – honestly this was Malfoy, what difference did that make?
She didn’t. Didn’t offer them much more than a tight look as they guided Luna out of her office, but Draco felt the power of that look burning disapproval into his back and vowed promptly never to try that again.
He’d had Harry Potter by his side, it had been hard but not impossible.
Harry attempted to look over his shoulder but obviously couldn’t see what Draco was talking about, so he wandered back into the bathroom to get a look in the mirror and put some pants on without scarring Hermione. ‘Huh,’ he said, voice issuing through the open do once he’d gotten a look at the small golden ball with delicate wings displayed on his shoulder.
Draco had scars and stories of his own. Like Harry, the war had changed him, broken him and rebuilt him in ways not many people could understand. He understood Harry in a way Ron and Hermione never would and he in turn could understand Draco in a way Pansy never could.
Harry knew he wasn’t being fair, he’d paced agitated circles around her office while she had the politically polite, adult version, of a shouting match with Kingsley through the floo, after all. That didn’t stop him from being angry that she’d allowed two aurors into Hogwarts and just stood there with lips pursed as they whisked Draco away via portkey. It wasn’t Kingsley’s fault either, but Harry had already tried arguing with Robards and that hadn’t gotten him anywhere, which was when McGonagall had taken over and demanded to speak to Kingsley.
‘Third year?’ Harry wondered.
This is when things changed.
Harry huffed a laugh of his own. ‘Not a chance.’
‘That was impressive work you did on Thursday,’ Mustafa informed him. ‘That was a nasty blood curse and not one person was hit with it.’
‘The Carrow family has owned this property for centuries,’ Draco explained. ‘Haven’t you noticed how much older the magic is the closer to the house we get?’ He waited while Harry shook his head. ‘I don’t think this was just the work of the last war, I think this has been centuries of psychotic Carrows branching further and further out to protect their land.’ Voicing aloud the next part was mostly so that someone else could share his worries and not because he thought it would do him any good. ‘I think there are going to be Dark spells closer to the farmhouse that have been lying in wait for centuries – I’m not sure we’ll even recognise some of them.’
‘I still think blood magic is terribly dangerous,’ Granger sternly informed them, as though neither of them had quite worked it out for themselves already. As though she hadn’t been dogging Harry with questions about his blasé attitude to Draco’s Dark Arts use for weeks, constantly attempting to call him on his easy forgiveness of a man who still saw nothing wrong with using terrible
Draco wrinkled his nose but inclined his head, ‘Hermione.’
‘We were going to have such a nice day,’ Harry bemoaned.
And maybe he’d been scared that she would make him choose, that he would lay it all out for her and she’d be horrified and disappointed in him and make him choose. Because he’d choose Draco, he knew that, and he thought she might know that too and that made it worse. Because she didn’t understand how he could. Didn’t understand how something so fundamental had changed between them.
He just wanted to fall into the chair beside Draco and watch him sleep until he was strong enough to open his eyes. He didn’t want to deal with his friends and their questions and the strange mix of pity and resentment they felt when they looked to Draco and saw a man who had been hurt, yes, but a man they (on some level) thought deserved what he got.
Harry cleared his throat. ‘You could talk to Draco.’
‘No,’ Harry said firmly, grabbing hold of Draco’s arm to still him and staring hard at McGonagall. ‘He can’t.’
He yelped and tried to shake it off but, when that didn’t work, he resorted to stroking the spout which seemed to soothe it enough to let him go. Thank Merlin, he actually listened when Luna talked to him about temperamental family heirlooms. He shot it a reproachful glare which it couldn’t see because it was a teapot and had no eyes and turned his full attention back to Ron who was looking at him with wide eyes, raised half off the loveseat as though he’d been about to come to the rescue.
Barrier spell in place and with a sense of calm washing over the injured muggles, Harry skirted around the fallen muggles to climb onto the small stage at the end of the square. As Draco watched, the familiar white stag swept from the square to deliver a message to the Weasleys, Draco sent his own enormous dog off to the Ministry and then set off a beacon spell because he still didn’t have any idea where he was. Then he sent another call off for emergency medical aide because even just a quick glance told Draco there were some muggles set to spend at least the night in St Mungo’s secure muggle treatment ward.
Draco Malfoy on the platform waiting to return to Hogwarts. Draco Malfoy, a Death Eater, standing amongst people he’d hurt and tortured –
And all because his best friend turned out to be a homophobic prick who left whenever things got hard.
They’re silent, its uncomfortable and Harry has to resist the urge to fidget but he has no idea what he’s supposed to say. It’s true, he’s always wanted to be a father but now when he thinks about being a father there’s no Ginny in the picture. He and Draco haven’t talked specifics but there’s always been that underlying feeling in their exchanges that they’ll find a surrogate, do it that way. Harry would have been fine with adoption once upon a time but now he wants that feeling of his blood surviving, loathe though he is to give Lucius Malfoy the satisfaction, but Narcissa, her eyes would light up and he knows how much the idea would mean to her.
But Harry wouldn’t do that to Draco. He couldn’t. Coming back to Hogwarts was always going to be hard and Harry refused to make that harder on Draco than it had to be by denying him the friendship that had sustained him during his stay in Azkaban and that had flourished into something so much deeper and stronger that Harry still had trouble wrapping his head around.
I made. Because they were my choices. I
‘Yeah, but you’re warm.’
‘I lived in a house with Voldemort,’ Draco replied, ignoring Pansy’s flinch at his use of the name. ‘I was tortured and broken. I spent three months in Azkaban. Of course, I’ve changed.’
There’d been so many people clambering for his attention and so much homework to catch up on having missed almost two full weeks, that he’d managed to go two whole days without having to have
While Harry set about putting up wards around the area and carefully noting his surroundings for possible memory review later, Draco grabbed the frozen witch by the hood of her robe and began to drag her along the ground until he could chain her to the lamp post beside Harry’s catch. Only once she was secure did he cast the counter curse and a quick diagnostic charm showed she was now suffering the early stages of hypothermia. He wasn’t remotely sorry.
The disorientation slowed down Snape’s arrival and Draco now bore the scars of Harry’s thoughtless spell choice. He didn’t mind, really, they were a testament to what he’d been through and he much preferred being marked by Harry than Voldemort. Harry, after an ill-timed but exquisitely satisfying fuck against the wall in Myrtle’s bathroom (just moments after a trip into the Chamber of Secrets) admitted that he liked knowing he’d marked Draco.
And he remembered waking up to the sight of a messy head of hair and angry green eyes and he’d felt safe for the first time in a long time.
‘I think you give me too much,’ Draco countered.
photographer had chosen the least incriminating photo intentionally. This one was soft and intimate, true, but it didn’t make the focus of the photo their relationship, rather it made it about Harry’s loss and the grief of living through a war, grief that would hopefully begin to heal now that Voldemort was gone.
They were back to working quietly when Hermione returned again. Ron struggling through his essay while Harry had set aside his novel in favour of the other thing Pansy had sent him which was the latest copy of
Hermione had been quick to assure him that it wasn’t his fault, that she didn’t know if she could be with someone who chose to use words to hurt for the sake of hurting. She was firm in her resolve to break things off until he’d come to see why what he’d done had been wrong and hurt, not just Harry, but all of them.
hurt a lot of people with our obsession.’ He mulled the words over in his mind, teased out new and fresh details of the what-if scenario Harry had painted.
Best to avoid the whole topic entirely with, ‘How do we go about fixing this?’
The stag over Draco’s left pectoral – over his heart, they both knew it – was missing the tip of an antler but stood proud and strong. It might have been a representation of Harry and the way he’d helped shape so many of Draco’s choices but it was Draco too, in the way it stood amongst those it loved, shielding and protecting the flowers that were his mother even as it hovered in their warm embrace. The way Luna’s moons watched over him as she was doing in life now for both of them.
But that was future Draco’s problem, present Draco quite happily could have passed out. The flow of magic from the broken ward stopped just as suddenly as it had started, the burning sensation crawling up his arm didn’t, of course. That would have been far too easy. There weren’t any outward signs of damage to his arm and he could still move all his fingers and joints as they were supposed to, so he hoped he’d caused no more lasting damage than if he’d dismantled it slowly and safely.
That was what the stag represented to Draco. It was what the dragon constellation meant to Harry. Who would they be without those things?
‘Of course, we’re going to tell her. Can you imagine what she’d do if we didn’t and she found out?’
Ginny’s glare falters in the face of such unexpected softness but its back in full force when she turns to Harry and says sharply, ‘You can tell mum and dad.’
to change his beliefs – and it had been painful and a slow process (it was still a process) but he’d made those changes because they were the right thing. Knowing that there’d been a violent catalyst to start those changes didn’t, as far as Harry was concerned, negate the fact that he made them.
‘Shall I tease you with a hint before our full day of classes?’ Draco asked but he didn’t wait for a response because he quite liked the idea of torturing her throughout the day. ‘Our magic and blood are all bound together, resting in protection runes absorbed into his very skin.’
He and Draco had both killed people, they’d tortured people and used spells they weren’t proud of, making the best decisions they could in the middle of a war. Harry understood Draco in ways he’d never understood Ginny and in turn Draco understood him in ways he never
This did not deter the Gryffindor at all, she just sat quietly and listened as he gave Astoria advice on visualisation for her spellwork and helped correct her wand movements where needed. By the time they were done, Astoria was flushed pink and a little sweaty, but she had the spell down and was more than happy to leave him alone at the table with Hermione in favour of seeking out her bed and a nap.
Fenrir Greyback.
Honestly, at least when he came with Draco there was respect buried in the hatred. Draco was a blatant reminder that wizards banked a lot of gold and valuables with the goblins. Something about the way he carried himself and spoke knowledgably about his own investments resonated with the goblins and although they never showed any particular liking for any human, Draco didn’t annoy them as much as everyone else seemed to. Besides, Draco liked to claim that they were properly aware that pissing off the man the wizarding world’s saviour loved was likely to end badly for them if they wanted to continue doing business with wizards.
‘There are so many things
‘We can ask her tomorrow.’
‘It’s early, Longbottom,’ Draco grumped as he tugged the door open. ‘What do you want?’
Luna shook her head again before explaining all about her NEWT project for Care of Magical Creatures. She tapered off a bit in the middle when her words started to slur and that was enough for Draco and Ginny who gave Draco a pleading look which he didn’t need because he was already adjusting his grip on Luna to slide her into his arms where he cradled her against his chest before he stood up. Harry placed a steadying hand on his hips as he stepped over the bench.
‘Good,’ he and Ginny both replied without hesitation. Although Ginny followed it up with, ‘He needs to realise what a git he’s being,’ when he would have simply left it at that because now he knew they were going to have to talk about Weasley, and Draco had very much been enjoying not having to think about the prat.
Draco shrugged. ‘You had a lot going on,’ he conceded. ‘That doesn’t mean the fact you can’t even identify the four other prefects in your own house doesn’t baffle me.’ He gave a shudder. ‘I couldn’t forget any of them after the sexual education fiasco that came about in third year.’
Harry’s rolled eyes and the indulgent, ‘You idiot. If that was all this was, I’d go shag Zabini,’ that followed had hardly been the most romantic declaration of feelings.
Harry made it sound so easy. As though sneaking into Hogwarts was simple. As though breaking into a heavily warded room with just the aid of Harry’s invisibility cloak, so that he could take the place of one of Harry’s Weasleys in a horrendously complex ritual that was the Order’s last-ditch effort to defeat Voldemort, was as simple as a casual stroll in the park.
‘Did you bring the Map?’ Draco asked.
He was just as bad as Draco. He might not remember much of that moment, might not grasp how truly close to death he’d come, but he’d lost something in that moment, something he hadn’t even been aware of. There’d been an innocence there, hidden away deep in his mind, a hopeful innocence that everything would be okay because his parents loved him and he was the right sort of wizard and even with Voldemort and all the wrong (
Draco shrugged. ‘A year?’
The fact that he knew that, the fact that Harry could even say that instead of getting angry and defensive – Draco had never had proper friends before Harry and Luna but he thought he was coming to understand just how much of a struggle this was for Hermione and that while this was about him and his past it was about Hermione too. It was about the girl who erased her parents’ memories and sent them to the other side of the world just to protect them. It was about the girl who had missed so much of her best friend’s life and that she’d learned about it from Draco of all people.
‘Really?’ Harry asked, sharing a fond smile with Draco over Luna’s head. ‘What are they, then?’
Harry, apparently feeling the need for sarcasm said, ‘That went well.’
This time, Draco gave him such a pitying look, one that suggested his fondness somehow encompassed Harry in all his completely stupid glory. For some reason the look made Harry grin goofily which had Draco raising a sharp brow before turning his attention back to Longbottom who seemed to be watching them with poorly disguised longing.
Draco smirked. ‘I’m about to spend the day playing with piles of gold – it’s going to be a lovely day.’
With his wand still gripped in his hand, he reached down and pulled up the sleeve of his jumper, baring the Dark Mark for all to see. In the split second all eyes darted down to look, Draco saw the flicker of fear and uncertainty in the eyes of the three witches and that quiver of fear told him he’d been right to think none of them bore the Mark. They might have been followers of Voldemort – must have been to be in a house guarded by such wards – but they weren’t Death Eaters and that made things more interesting.
Harry had his own tattoo over his heart, because of course he did. He’d had it done during those two weeks Draco was at Hogwarts without him. The simple display of stars forming Draco’s constellation because he was exactly that much of a sap and he was okay with it.
And then there was Harry, shutting the door and grinning at him and looking fit and young and tanned and Ron was the one who’d been in a sunny warm country why did he feel like a pasty blob?
Harry shook his head. ‘Hermione, it’s not a secret. All the Weasleys know, some of the teachers too. Neville knows, Kingsley and Robards know.’
Harry – the bastard – grinned. ‘It’s been a long fucking time, Ron.’
Draco took this to mean that Molly had finally told Ginny off for hexing him, not that she’d actually released the jinx keeping his mouth shut. She seemed adamant in  forcing him to communicate through writing and therefore to actually think about the words he was saying.
Harry didn’t. Instead he turned and frowned at Slughorn for a moment before rolling his eyes again at the man and purposefully stalking across the room to drop into the available chair beside Draco. In the stunned silence that followed there was no doubt everyone heard Harry’s muttered “arsehole” though whether they realised it was directed at Slughorn, Draco couldn’t tell.
‘They do,’ Draco said, ‘Father checked.’
Pansy nodded. She looked between them once more and the soft expression she’d held since taking a good look at him, slipped into a devilish smirk. ‘I don’t think fifteen-year-old me, listening to all your Potter fantasies, ever thought we’d wind up here.’
Draco slid his textbook across the desk, ignoring the way everyone in the room had to be staring at them.
They weren’t talking, just sitting in comfortable silence while Draco tried not to panic over his upcoming reunion with his – well he didn’t know what Pansy was. He’d once called her a friend, but he didn’t think that was ever really true. Harry did his best to comfort him despite both of them knowing he was being ridiculous. Pansy wouldn’t have asked for this meeting if she didn’t want to reach out to Draco, if she weren’t at least willing to listen to his explanations. If she wasn’t at least somewhat willing to repair or even build their friendship.
Pansy to see that. They might not be close but he was beginning to think that was on him, that he’d been so driven to be the spitting image of his father that he hadn’t realised how little he knew about being a good friend.
If Harry hadn’t continued talking, explaining about Fleur dismantling the blood curse and the subsequent request for a Ministry investigation, Draco might have drifted right back off to sleep. Which would have been a pity because he would have missed the look on Weasley’s face when he noticed his best friend absently stroking his bare feet.
The following article had been about the Wizengamot’s decision to give proper trials to all captured Death Eaters. He’d made an appearance in that article, as had his mother and father. What had been most interesting about the article was that it had drawn on evidence from Death Eater “trials” from the previous war, citing the complete farce that had been a number of the trials (Sirius had been mentioned here too for the astounding lack of a trial he’d received). Again, the
Harry nodded. ‘And Draco checked over it, so I know I didn’t miss anything,’ Harry assured Hermione with a knowing look.
Draco knew everything about Harry, what he didn’t know from observing him at school, he knew from their talks in his cell. He knew Harry inside and out and Harry knew him too. He knew exactly what had driven Draco to take the Mark, knew exactly when his thoughts on blood status had changed.
‘I’ll let you write your own paper,’ Draco offered bitingly, ‘if you can tell me everything you know about how the Dark Mark functions.’
Such a small change and yet things remained remarkably the same. There was a funeral, words exchanged with the Minister and plans made with Ron and Hermione. He didn’t have to break up with Ginny.
has been running on your work with the Ministry.’ He offered them an awkward look of apology as though confessing that his wife once read Skeeter (she’d since been relegated to the
‘I need time to process this,’ Hermione murmured. She started to gather her things; the napkins she’d scribbled her notes on and the muggle pen went into her handbag and she stood from the table abruptly. ‘I just – I need to think.’
Draco winked.
‘Yeah,’ Ron agreed softly, not sounding too sure about that.
The rusty metal trap gave a whine and the sound reminded Draco of Fang which then gave him a truly horrible idea. ‘Oh for – pet it,’ he told Harry. ‘I bet you it’s sad and lonely.’
I'd love to here your thoughts! Please leave me a comment.
He didn’t envy Winthrop trying to clear it on her own and hoped she’d taken the advice he’d passed on from Draco not to touch anything she wasn’t one hundred percent sure about.
And he had a lot of power.
‘He was proud of it, Harry! Proud to wear the Mark and be selected by Voldemort for his task. He’s arrogant and bigoted and the type of blood someone has matters to him. He was taught for
Draco did smile at that. Just because they were dangerous and Dark and likely to cause all sorts of problems definitely did not mean he wasn’t (just a tiny bit) looking forward to studying them. But Harry knew him well enough that he already knew that.
‘I didn’t see that one,’ Ron frowned.
If he was lucky, Bill would come up with the answers they needed and Hermione could finally turn her attention back to something worth breaking apart into quantifiable pieces. Like the Arithmancy homework that was currently causing him a tiny bit of consternation. Tiny. Hardly worth mentioning unless Hermione brought it up first and happened to know exactly how he was supposed to be getting from this one step to the next because his numbers weren’t quite adding up. It was why he’d been finishing off his Potions essay even though it wasn’t due for another week. That he knew he’d gotten as close to perfect as it was possible to get.
‘Godric’s Hollow,’ Draco replied promptly. ‘Let’s get dinner and we can visit your parents and I can see this memorial.’
Harry felt like a bit of a dick and he seriously wished he’d bought Pansy along. She wouldn’t have batted an eye at all the talk of money and fancy heirlooms. She might have tried to take a few, citing he still owed her a Christmas gift – he didn’t. He and Draco were going about Christmas in the manner of most established couples and were buying gifts together – and Draco had had Pansy’s gift ordered before November was even half done.
Bill snorted at the suggestion the Hogwarts dungeons were anything like the tombs he’d frequently explored during his time in Egypt, but he didn’t argue with the task, striding off with Fleur by his side, head bent as the pair worked over a strategy.
Ron shrugged, offering her a small, pleased smile and changed the subject. ‘Still want to take on the Ministry?’
The war for him had been an extremely different experience. His whole life until Voldemort finally died had been so different and he didn’t know how to tell Hermione and Ron that without having to tell them all the things they thought they already knew. He didn’t want to sit down and tell them about his childhood at length, about the things he’d felt and experienced growing up in that cupboard under the stairs.
But he was done dealing with a Ministry who claimed to be different and then made the same bad choices it had always done. If that meant he had to show off his power, make threats and demands, then so be it. Hopefully, he wouldn’t have to do it again. Hopefully, he’d never have to follow through on his threats. Although, he didn’t necessarily hate the idea of taking Draco somewhere far away where the Ministry could never find them. Harry was done fighting other people’s wars and if this administration wasn’t careful, there’d be another one.
There were so many things he’d experienced that they had no hope of understanding. They didn’t know what it was like to be hated and abused by the only family they had; they didn’t know what it was like to be constantly teetering on the brink. To be hovering over the edge, terrified it would all be taken away with the simple snap of a lock or bars on his window. He didn’t know how to talk to them about it without being angry at them for not asking questions before.
