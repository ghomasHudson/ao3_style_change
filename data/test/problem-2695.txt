The hand moves from his shoulder blade, is tracing circles up and down his back and this is what finally breaks him. Because suddenly they’re Frieda’s hands, pressing soothing circles into Mike’s back, until they’d taken his body and worked it and worked it until there was nothing left.
Pansy snorts into her cocoa. “He hasn’t shut up about it. Weeks, Potter. I’ve had to listen to him moaning on about you for weeks.”
“Mother!”
,” Harry’d said, from one knee a week later, because it was as true as it was forever.
“Fuck!” Draco’s head hit the wall with a dull thud.
Draco raises one eyebrow, and Harry briefly wonders if this is a skill that's innate or requires practice. He wouldn’t put it past Draco to spend long hours staring into a mirror, wiggling his blond brows trying to look sinister.
“Look,” Harry said, and Draco watched that chin slot into place, jutting forward Draco knew that Potter had made a decision that he planned to see through.
“Yes,” Draco says into his mouth and Harry gasps as those lovely hands—strong hands—grab his shoulders and push him onto his back. For a flash, Harry’s eyes snap open, and he’s sure that the world is unravelling. Because Draco Malfoy is above him, knees on either side of his hips, holding him down. He’s panting and looking at Harry like…
“I’ll bring him home,” he thinks he says.
have any physical attributes—fear shouldn’t weigh heavy on the soul and shame shouldn’t have the pigment to leave a stain.
Harry jumps from the couch, sending Bella plunging to the floor. She yowls in protest as he sprints towards the front door, but he doesn’t have time to apologize because Malfoy is about to break into his home and the wards will not respond well to an intruder.
“Wanted to send all the witnesses out, did you?” Draco tries for anger, but his composure is a loose hangnail and he’s pulling. The pain is ready to unzip his skin and let the hopelessness come gushing. They’re both going to leave this bloody.
“Yeah, I’m a bit shit at this,” Harry says, staring at the collection of coffee rings next to Malfoy’s mouse pad. “But I wanted to see you?”
“No.”
Draco is leaning against the wall across from him, looking at Harry as if he’s a wild animal that’s escaped the zoo. “What are you doing here?”
Harry sheds his insecurities like a second skin. It’s always been this way; he’s always worked better in a crisis.
* * *
. The multiverse is not a wheel, and the idea that he could be at the centre of anything is a joke.
Harry had rolled over and opened one bleary eye. “Not depressed,” he’d said, throwing an arm over his face and trying to blot out all of the noise his two best friends had brought into his home.
“You’re being glib,” Draco says.
Granger doesn’t speak until the end. “That won’t fix anything internal. You should go to St. Mungo’s when you’re finished whatever you came here to do.” Granger lowers her wand and reaches out her hand—to help him up, Draco thinks, but can’t shake the feeling that this gesture means a little bit more.
“You did?”
Pansy treads into no man’s land on her toes and sets the shopping down on their kitchen table. “Did the date really go that bad?”
“All by myself!” The notes are impossible to hit if you’re not Celine, but he doesn’t care. “Don’t wanna be ALL BY MYSELF!”
“Agree with you there, Parkinson,” Ron says.
For years—ever since that horrible night in the forest—Harry had clutched his magic tight, fought with the frantic moments when it surged close to the skin.
* * *
“Hey,” Harry says, and Draco’s not sure exactly who he’s talking to.
“You know that I’m not at liberty—”
John still doesn’t say anything.
“That little card game they play has all kinds of spells, Pans,” Draco says, and watches her shoulders relax. “Besides, it’s less of a spell and more of a curse, as it turns out.”
“I wish I could change—” Draco’s not sure why he’s talking. “I would do anything to go back and just shake myself.”
, Draco thinks but doesn’t say. No reason for pointless dramatics, his mother would say, and
“You’ve heard the rumours,” Draco says, trying to fend off his embarrassment. “And mother confirmed it. He died Pansy. He walked into a forest knowing he was going to die.”
Draco thinks, and realizes that he hadn’t expected the day to end this way.
“Malfoy.” Harry tries for anger, but it won’t come. The name stutters out, strangled and sad.
,” and then, voice hoarse but magnified a thousand times, “POTTER!” Longing and something softer twists Harry’s intestines into knots.
“We figure Draco cast the spell in the library or on the balcony overlooking the gardens,” Hermione says, throwing an approving look at Pansy.
Harry was still there at the end of it all, still wearing his mother’s dried blood.
The headlines narrated the story of a world in chaos. It was almost as if, after the external threat of Voldemort was defeated, everyone forgot how to live with each other.
“Something about…tread softly? Because these are my dreams.” Harry pauses and Draco’s grateful because the Boy Who Lived is misquoting
“I think Muggles call it The Rap,” Draco says, shimmying his shoulders. “I like it.”
When Dark-Haired-Not-Potter had slipped up behind him, Draco had taken one look at his face and known what the stranger wanted. Understood it in a way that was so much simpler than everything else in his stupid life.
Draco thinks, and feels his rage fizzle to nothing. Of course Potter doesn’t want to be seen with him. Doesn’t want any of Draco’s shame to get on his horrible shoes. Somehow, the idea of Harry being embarrassed of him hurts more than anything else in this horrible day.
“Do you get some sick pleasure, seeing me like this?”
The melancholy creeps like black mould. Draco knows he should fight it off—scrub his internal machinations with positivity or optimism—but he just can’t muster the energy.
“Just tell us what happened,” Ron says, his grin all self-satisfaction.
The tempo is picking up. Celine is letting the tension build and build and he can feel the release.
Harry is pining in 2003, Draco has decided to emulate Harry's stalker-esque behaviours (I know, right? Bad form, Draco) and everything comes to a head after a late shift in Emergency...
It’s with a grin as wide as a watermelon that Harry turns towards Room 5—one of the few places in the department with a door.
His first instinct is to dial Hermione, and he has her number half-programmed into his mobile before he thinks better of it. Whatever thing had happened between him and Malfoy, Harry’s not ready to put it to words, and so he tries to drown the gaping chasm of
And what fury. Draco’s swallowed Fiendfyre whole. It roars inside of him, an urgent need to raze the entire universe to the ground, to set this string of fate alight and watch it burn.
For a moment, Draco stands in the streets of Diagon, a brass key heavy in his hand, a locking spell fresh off his lips, confused and lost.
Harry shakes his head, takes one step towards him.
“You’re doing a shit job.”
Harry finds Draco sitting atop a stool in the office, legs pointing long lines.
What he wasn’t enjoying was the enormous cash register as it leered at him from its spot on the countertop, refusing to open. “You will not defeat me,” Draco says, sneering back at the mass of metal. “You are an inanimate object and I am a wizard.”
business.
“Why would you do that?”
“We’ve got an ambulance on the way—”
“It’s…a bit shit,” Draco says, weakly.
“It’s bizarre really,” Draco says. “He’s a muggle. There’s no reason that he should be able to just spread his wings and
“Perhaps you should spend more time fraternizing with Muggles and less time wallowing.”
“Touch morbid,” Draco says.
“Yes.”
Now that he’s closer to her, Harry notices how exhausted she looks—her dark hair is greasy and pulled into a high ponytail and her face looks strained, as if something dreadful has taken her by the seams and just stretched her like cellophane. Harry wonders if they’re still close, Draco and Pansy. They live together, so it seems likely.
They’re all tempting options. But as Draco flicks through his ever-expanding CD collection, he realizes that there was only ever one person who could capture his mood in this moment.
This space is nothing what Harry had expected but is all so
John nods. He has a thick head of brown hair and an enviable hairline. “Here to try and figure out if you’re safe to leave or if you’re gonna try and die again.”
The confidence of his friends feels tender. If Harry can just sit Draco down and try and explain the thorny mess of feelings growing in his chest, then everything will be alright.  Buffeted by the certainties of the two best people Harry knows, the green magic of the floo roars to life and whisks him away.
Pansy shudders. “If you start talking about invisible money again, I will sew your lips shut.”
he’d said after disappearing from Emma’s party.
“The trouble won’t be the spell. It will be…” Hermione pauses, searching for the simplest explanation. “It will be knowing where to aim the spell. The multi-verse is a fairly big place.”
“Can I?” Draco asks,
Draco remembers the street sign.
* * *
“Of course I did.” Harry’s not sure what game Malfoy is playing.
“Don’t be ashamed, Harry. It is the heart that drives all the best stories.”
The stranger does not look fine. “My friend is trying to teach me how to be more…outgoing? I’m fucking awful at it.”
The anger is back in Potter’s eyes, green as a killing curse. He strides towards them, red Auror robes flapping and Draco suddenly understands how this boy could have been the sigil of righteousness for an entire generation.
“I was freaking out. Because I—I could,” he whispers. “That’s the part that scared me, I think. That I could,”
“Are you…” Harry looks up from his hands to meet Malfoy’s eyes.
And there’s only Potter
“Draco and I have been completing our Muggle education,” Pansy said, licking the top of her hand and sprinkling it with some salt.
she says, and they’re gone.
Robertson had winked at him. “Of course you can work here!” he bellowed—with stomach and gusto and Draco had nearly fallen over. “It will add some variety to the mundanity of my every day, if nothing else.”
“I found Draco!” Harry blurts.
“Come back with me.” Harry’s creeping forward, and Draco remembers St. Mungo’s and how Harry had walked into his violence then too. “You don’t belong here.”
she asks.
“No,” Hermione said, her words long and thoughtful. “He’s not. Harry, I think you may need to make a statement.”
They had cut into each other and the blood spatter did not divine a happy future.
Harry doesn’t understand the hows of this request. The parameters of this ancient morality curse are indiscernible and it was all Harry can do to listen to her voice. His magic is warm, humming and itchy, as his skin shifts as the power bursts through. “Home,” he says through a mouthful of stars.
But Malfoy was true to his word. He hadn’t attended any of the fancy pure blood fundraisers. He never came back to the club where his father and his father’s father had stirred their money into magical society and watched it simmer.
“Young people are not familiar with the bard. It’s criminal! But tell me,” Robertson says, grin violent. “How long did it take for this feud to mature into something more romantic?”
“Draco?” Harry says, rolling out of the ridiculously soft sheets. Harry needs a set of these and resolves to ask Draco once he finds him. Because he can’t be far.
“NOTHING!” Pansy roars. Legit roars. The windows shake beneath her rage and they’ve got three panes of glass. “You had the shit kicked out of you by a literal mob!”
The silence ripples as Malfoy scratches a few lines onto Lucy’s chart. “There. Dr. Mikhail will be in touch for a telehealth session later this evening.”
“—Draco!”
A man in a blue uniform slams the driver’s side door and begins to close the distance. Draco wonders if this is the Muggle Aurors, but that wouldn’t make sense, because he wasn’t doing anything illegal.
“You’re a child,” says Draco. “Now give me back my wine bottle if you’re not going to drink it.”
“Potter? Is that you, lurking outside my office?”
“Is it?”
“Narcissa,” Pansy says, this one word saturated with an old grief.
Draco squishes that nasty little thought, because it’s not possible and Potter wouldn’t.
Harry thinks, pushing the nausea back down. It’s only a memory. It can’t hurt him.
, and wasn’t that strange?—looked upset. The idea of it, of Harry’s mouth twisted in that frown that’s more disappointment than anything else, was painful.
Fingers slip between his and squeeze. It’s a kind gesture, soft and well-intended.
to go to Azkaban?”
Harry rolls his eyes, but his brain has stopped itching for the first time since that impossible moment on the terrace. “Sometimes, I just want to just cast one or two spells. For the cancers they’ve not got figured out yet. Or to regrow organs and save someone months of dialysis. I feel like a failure, like I’m keeping lifesaving treatment from a whole group of people who deserve to be saved.”
“You should really attempt to woo him in several languages.”
“I dunno,” Harry says, realizing how little information he’s gleaned from his time with Malfoy and making a mental note to pay more attention to questions and less to the lips answering them.
“So that means that there must be something wrong with this version of me. Because Potter is good, he’s the poster boy for goodness, and he can’t love me. And so it follows—”
“What is he doing here?” Pansy says from her position next to Hermione. “Like, what is he contributing?”
“I don’t…I didn’t...” He’s not at all sure where he should start. “How much do you know?”
“You mean when you told me about your crush?” Hermione says and Pansy snorts. “Oh Harry, that was ages ago—”
Harry looks at him, and it’s not indifference or embarrassment, and Draco wonders if maybe he’d misunderstood, all those years ago.
“It’s for Harry!”
“On if you’re single.”
“Touché mental heath worker.” Something companionable settles between them, which is a miraculous development given the context.
Horrifically, Draco realizes he’s going to cry. He bites the inside of his cheek to stop the assault, but he’s too late.
The hospital is a dizzy labyrinth of linoleum and synthetic light. Healers rush up and down, in that awful lime green that Pansy had once used to paint her toes. Every door looks the same and Draco allows himself to be tugged along, in a universe he’s no longer sure he wants to exist in.
“I bought it at an Electronics Shop.” He says the last two words slowly, determined not to botch the pronunciation.
“Moral support!” Ron roars, his hunger getting the better of him. “Don’t mess with the system, Parkinson. You’re the new element here. We’ve been solving mysteries together since we were eleven!”
“That’s what you want to know?” Malfoy pushes at his sleeves. “You want to know what I miss?”
“Internalized homophobia?” she says and Draco elbows her.
Draco shakes his head. “Who would’ve thought. A green suit.”
“Are you okay?”
* * *
“She took your hand?” Draco’s disbelief is squirming, refusing to be suspended.
“You’re not a villain.”
The streets sway around him like a slow dance. Soft light filters through the leaves of the trees and Harry realizes that it’s early afternoon. The sky is overcast and Harry breathes in the moisture, chases the sounds of cars down the street.
“Was he?” Ron says, rolling his eyes.
“Malfoys walking free in Diagon,” says someone else. A fuller person, someone who’s cheeks aren’t sunken but who carries sadness between his shoulders. Atlas, balancing his tragedy on the knobs of his spine. “It’s wrong.”
And those long fingers take him by the chin. The touch is gentle against his stubble.
“Nice?” White curls of frost scratched at the pane and the wind howled across the waste.
With the small flick of his wand, the letter split into two copies. One addressed to Pansy and the other to Pawk. They were the only people he could trust to do the things he did. He wanted them to know the full truth and to continue what he started. Maybe he was manipulating politics but he was done putting so much thought into morals. He spent so much time tearing himself apart for not feeling remorse, feeling bad for being remorseless, wanting to care, getting over that he didn't care, and thinking it was all done only to be sucked back into the cycle over and over again. He knew it wasn't something any rational person would do, but no rational person experienced what he had.
Harry put on a shocked expression. He wasn't entirely sure if he was being hit on or not.
Harry bit his lip. "Oh, I could stare at that face all day."
“Is it alright if I move?”
He was mewling for his orgasm as he felt the pleasure in his hips reaching out for it. When he finally grasped it a low groan was all he could manage. His hips jerked and his thighs shook. He writhed and gasped as relief flooded his body. Soft noises left him, curses, gasps, whines, whimpers, and unfortunately, Harry’s name.
Draco smirked, “When you aren’t used to it, it can be quite tiring.”
Harry looked up from his charms homework and nodded, “I meant every word of it. I mean what I write and I write what I mean.”
Draco's spent enough time around the elite fakes to know when someone is too busy inside of their own head to pay attention to the real world. "What are you thinking about?"
His eyes widened and he looked away, clearly embarrassed. Especially since he was wearing Draco’s jumper at the moment. “Merlin.” He mumbled.
Draco shook his head and beamed. "You're absolutely insane."
His pace was slow as first, but soon enough, he was moving fairly quick and letting his tongue roam around Harry’s length. He could feel the muscles in Harry’s hips and thighs spasming and quaking.
After class, Harry went to Hogsmeade. There was something he needed to get done.
“What’s that one?” He asked softly, wanting something to take his mind off the day. He was tired and found himself threatening to space out, but he didn’t want to. He sat down and listened to Draco’s response.
The secretary greeted him with a smile and he gave her a nod as he entered, seeing Greenwood looking over a few files on his desk. "Potter, good to see you again. Take a lunch in your Wizengamot uniform?"
Draco blinked in surprise and nodded. “Yea.” He didn’t think Harry would actually remember. “Right, and the fourth is, uh. It’s erotica, honestly. It’s just a big collection of erotica. Judge me if you wish, but I’ve no shame.”
Draco sat up and sprang out of bed, rushing into the bathroom. He looked at himself and his jaw dropped. There were small and light hickies littered across his neck. “I’m gonna kick your arse, Potter!”
They also realized it was well past sundown and they were probably going to be in trouble if they got caught.
They spent the next while fantasizing aloud about what it would be like to work together.
Draco complied and slowly sank his hips in the rest of the way. He was buzzing with excitement from being surrounded by Harry. He was entirely overwhelmed. He was in awe that he was inside someone as lovely as Harry. It was warm, wet, and it was all his. His back was arched and he was softly panting from the squeeze alone. He’d almost forgotten how good it felt to be inside of someone else. Still, he’d always have a preference for being the one taking it.
“Merry Cismas Arry, merry Cismas Dayco.” Teddy greeted them when they arrived with three fingers in his mouth, drooling a little bit.
Draco gave a small smile and shifted a bit, scooting away from Harry. He was feeling sentimental and needed to be able to hold his husband. “Come here. Lay with me. I promise I won’t do or say anything dirty.”
“You could try to come to mine, but I doubt my parents would be happy about that.”
He went down the hall and saw Draco’s door was shut. He stood outside, hesitating for a few seconds, before giving the door a few soft knocks. He immediately regretted when he did and began internally panicking. Had he knocked too loud? Too much? Did he interrupt something? He’d been quite anxious all day, and now that he was going to try and talk to Draco, it got so much worse.
She turned to Harry and seemed to have lost her breath as her breath had picked up. Her tone somewhat frantic tone displayed just how panicked she had become. "Get a nurse, she's moving!"
Draco let out a laugh. “I don’t even like Quidditch. I hated it. I only did it because my father made me. I don’t care.”
Harry managed to get about halfway down before he started to bob his head. He pressed his tongue to the underside and let it rub against the length in his mouth with each bob. After only a moment, his neck and jaw began to ache. He decided he needed a bit more practice. Perhaps he should do this more often.
Draco, on the other hand, was starting to get a bit anxious about his future. He recently revived a letter from home. His father had been released from custody since he gave up so many names, but there were other stipulations with his release. The only one that effected Draco was that he couldn’t return to the Manor until he inherited it from his parents. Although it held some bad memories, it was still his home, and he was pissed. It wasn't that he was eager to go back, but it was still important to him. It's where his ancestors lived and died, it had all his childhood relics, his mother, his flowers, his room, and it was his birthright to own it one day, now they want to interdict him from entering. It angered him quite a bit.
It was so comfy and cozy. His body was completely relaxed from the massage yet still buzzing from his orgasm and the attention.
The house was by no means a Manor, but it was large enough to house about twenty people. He knew that inside there was only an old woman and her grandson.
Harry made a habit of making Draco’s bed for him and regularly getting him flowers. First the azalea, then a few bluebells, a couple different roses, once he even handed Draco an entire chrysanthemum.
That’s how the rest of the sorting went, every student was encouraged. No matter what house they went in to.
While his mother took a moment to herself, attempting to pull herself together, he wrote a letter. He addressed it to Pansy and it described everything that had just happened to him. She already knew Lucius was out seeking revenge, but like Draco, she was under the impression that it was almost over. They were both wrong.
Draco propped himself up on an elbow and he cupped Harry’s hand with his own, bringing it closer. Words couldn’t describe how sexy he found Harry’s innocence to be. He wrapped Harry’s hand around his length and the warmth made him let out a soft sigh. It felt nice.
“I’m not, I’m offering.”
He also came across an article about Hermione that Harry had very angrily addressed when he got home that day. It dragged her for being friends with Crow long before the woman had turned her attitude around. Harry told him that Hermione said she didn’t mind since her name had been through much worse, but Harry was determined to get to the bottom on who had exposed their friendship to begin with. Draco hadn’t even known about it until then, and it made him curious.
Ruth nodded. “It’s the truth. I can’t wait until I meet him.”
At least that was what the last two had been.
Draco smirked at how quickly Harry was moving to undress for him, how eager he was to be a good boy for him. “Come on, pick up the pace,” he taunted as if Harry could go any faster.
“You and your timers,” Harry nodded after a particularly-big swallow. Draco tried not to stare too obviously at his neck. “I like it.”
“I know, I know!” Draco said as he opened their front door so that his parents could step out into the warm summer air. “You have nothing to worry about, by the way. I am an adult.”
Harry jumped, cock straining against his pants all the while.
“I have,” Draco said, smoothing his hands down his chest and to his hips. “No idea what you’re talking about, dear.” He moved back and squeezed the globes of Harry’s arse with a happy sigh.
Harry swallowed his bread. “Well. I don’t want to spring another surprise on you,” he said carefully once the waitress was gone.
It was safe there. He could lie without anyone seeing it on his face and he could ‘accidentally log off’ whenever he wanted. Harry stopped and started his adventures online in his own time and could predict most of the things that happened.
“You see, it’s funny that you would use that wording—“
“It does,” Harry agreed, moving his hand to Draco’s thigh. The urge to kiss him grew like vines in his chest all over his lungs and heart, squeezing them in urgency. Harry moved his head to the side to find Draco already leaning in, and the two connected their lips.
“No, that’s not what I meant.”
“I need time to adjust to this,” said Alvaro as he tried to maintain a clear head. Draco could see him trying to be logical, trying to be rational in the face of something so emotionally tumultuous. “But… It doesn’t change the way I feel for you. I hope you know that.”
The corners of Draco’s lips tugged up. “You’re foxed,” he decided. Harry was likely a lightweight from lack of experience and his size.
“Is there a problem here, Severus?” Dumbledore’s voice rang calmly and clearly. He’d seen the commotion on the floor from where he’d perched to observe the students with his stalwart friend Minerva McGonagall and perhaps exchange gossip. The topic they’d been discussing before Severus had trudged into teenage wasteland was coincidentally centered on Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy.
Harry let out a little whine and tried to pull at the ropes as if he were really considering making an escape. He liked the struggle, especially with the knowledge that Draco would never be so merciful as to let him out of this easily.
“Ron,” Harry said, needing something to distract him from the sinking feeling in his stomach. “How’s Rosie doing?”
“But I haven’t even touched your cock,” Draco grinned, swapping kisses with the other man between words. In order to amend that previous statement, he reached down in between them to find Harry leaking precome.
“What?” Draco asked, frowning and confused by what was being asked of him.
“Aw,” Remus cooed. “You’re annoying, too.”
“Just because the child won’t have your genes doesn’t mean they can’t be a suitable heir,” Harry snarled before Draco could even speak.
Harry’s earlier apologies didn’t do much to alleviate her scowl. “Right before the credits? God, Kingsley can be so demanding.” She took the flash drive anyway. “Tell him I’ll handle it.”
There was something stirring in the hearts of the students Draco spoke to. This was Slytherin at its finest, a rallying cry of those who wished for more. More power, more knowledge, more popularity—whatever the heart desired the principles of Slytherin informed how they’d take it as their own.
Maybe she could go to the restaurant with Remus and Sirius and see Alex there and the world wouldn’t end. Maybe, she could have a party and invite him and all her friends and nothing would break and she would have a great time.
Draco let out a hiss of air, undoing his top shirt buttons and stretching his neck for a beat. “Hey now, pain is for tomorrow. Tonight I need to open you up again carefully, painslut. Moan about it all you like, but we’ll get to punishments for your impudence soon enough. Today you were good in heels—as graceful as you could be. Tonight you get rewarded with one eventual orgasm after I’ve mounted you to my heart’s content.”
Draco chuckled, “Do tell if you need any help. Their pining is already driving me insane.” He said as they watched the two practically snuggling together.
Harry hasn’t seen Narcissa since Wizengamot.
He didn’t necessarily picture marrying a woman and having children. He was also quite interested in men, though he’s never dated one. He’d even come to the conclusion that he might as well try, just to see what it was like. In fact, he’d met a werewolf in Wizengamot who was only two years older than him that he was quite interested in.
Harry looked away and crossed his arms. “You only figured it out because I figured yours out.” He defended playfully. “You’re just upset I’m a better lover.”
“Only because you did.” Draco said, a bit exasperated. “Don’t listen to him Teddy, let me tell you what really happened. I gently climbed on top of him and tried to wake him up, then he pulls me down and gets me to fall asleep. He woke me up and then made a comment about my sexuality, so I bashed him with a book, then he insulted me, so I insulted him back, and then we came here. My hair and skin routine isn’t ridiculous! It’s good hygiene, something Harry would know nothing about. He’s what we call, a filthy peasant.”
“My arse.” Harry got a dollop of icing on his fingers and smeared it on Draco’s cheek. He shocked himself a bit by his own actions. He had done it on a whim as a result of a shitty idea, but now, now he was actually acting on his shitty idea. Now he felt like he had to commit to it.
It was in the way they cooked together. It was in the way he could share his books and ideas. It was in the way that they were both encouraged and supported. Draco felt loved.
He received a letter back only a few hours later.
“Sorry, I just remembered your face when Harry sent you that Howler. He hardly bat an eye when you sent one to him, but all it took was one little Howler from Harry and suddenly your so embarrassed that you don’t even try to bite back. I know you’re good now, but I didn’t realize Harry has you whipped.” She explained with a playful smirk.
Harry furrowed his eyebrows. “Why not?”
He knew that Harry was originally going to be put in Slytherin, but that he convinced the hat to put him in Gryffindor. Now he completely understood that the boy between his legs, was in fact, an absolute snake.
Harry paused a moment and looked up at Draco. “Did you just call my mother beautiful?”
Everyone greeted him, but Draco still felt a bit uncomfortable.
Draco was a bit uncomfortable discussing it because it wasn’t as simple as him being willing to do chores. He was used to doing them. He was forced to. He was treated like a slave.
“Ah, I remember now. You were whimpering and whining like a scared kitten.”
What are Harry’s plans for the future? To become the next Defense Against the Dark Arts professor at Hogwarts.
His eyes widened and his lips parted as a loud and unfiltered groan rolled from his throat. There was a constant pleasure in his pants, buzzing around, unceasing. It only got stronger and stronger.
"I've slept with around six Hufflepuff boys, which was really most of their Quidditch team and a few others. I also started on the Ravenclaw team, but I only ever got two."
Eventually, it did fade. But the internal effect never will.
But Draco and Harry weren’t the only ones of their old class present that day. By then, Neville had moved up to Herbology Professor as Sprout had retired.
The blonde wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist and smiled. “I like you near me, too.”
Part of him was shocked that Draco seemed to understand to a certain extent. It was as if Draco understood exactly what Harry was trying to say but also pushed the idea that Harry's current domestic life is vastly different from his previous one. He made it clear that Harry was no reason to be sorry for anything, yet he was strangely compassionate as well.
This sent a shiver up Draco’s spine and he relented, laying back against Harry’s chest. “Fine. But I’m still going to go after your neck, every time.”
That was one of the most horrifying things Draco has ever been told. The more he thought about the journey Harry went through, the worse he felt about his side of the war. “I’m so sorry for everything I put you through.”
Draco frowned. “Maybe.” He didn't realize how predictable the characters were until now.
“I’m leaving now. Expect Narcissa to stick around for a while.”
After discussing Neville’s Herbology ambitions, it went around the booth, everyone discussing their dreams. Ron wanted to be an Auror and Hermione wanted to be Minister for Magic. The position was currently held by Kingsley Shacklebolt, who was pioneering the arrests of dark wizards. He’s likely gonna have his job for another decade or so, which gave Hermione plenty of time to gain support and rise through the ranks.
“Oh? Well I can’t help but to notice you’ve cut out a picture of us dancing.” He said as he saw the photo that once graced the cover of The Daily Prophet, sitting on his nightstand. “Bit sentimental for something that apparently has no appeal.” He leaned down and rested his chin on Harry’s side. “I’m willing to bet you also like the fact that I’m taller than you. I really do think you’re the little spoon.”
Draco took Harry’s lip biting as a challenge. He sucked harder and took his time enjoying the way Harry responded.
“I died too once, but then I came back.” Harry found a way to relate to the three and he went for it. Still, he wasn’t entirely comfortable with the conversation at hand. He wasn’t even sure why he was being so revealing to complete strangers.
“About a thousand Galleons. I have no impulse control and I want to give Teddy the world.”
“Well I could always give you another massage.”
He let out a noise like an injured animal as he struggled to breathe. Choked sobs worked their way out of his mouth as he tried to cry through his inability to breathe. But he couldn’t even hear himself, much less feel the way his body moved to let out those noises.
“I keep yours in the front pocket of my bag.”
He didn’t know why he was so anxious and doubtful, but he was. He was worried that he wouldn’t have any part in Teddy’s life. Perhaps he was worried Teddy would turn out like him, alone and yearning for love. Worried that Teddy would grow up miserable and unhappy like he did. But he had to remember that Teddy isn’t like him, and Andromeda isn’t like the Dursley’s.
Surprisingly, Hermione loved that Harry chose Greenwood and she was overjoyed that he took the cost to get the department off the ground. Harry somehow didn’t expect Hermione to agree with his choice of lawyer, but perhaps she recognized Greenwood's ability to get difficult tasks done, as he did with the Death Eaters. Nevertheless, they were in agreement and Hermione appreciated what Harry had done.
He stuck a cooled brownie into his mouth and realized he'd nearly finished his first batch. He chewed and felt a tear roll down his cheek. Part of him felt stupid for being so upset. But something about this cut him deeper than any insult that had ever been thrown his way.
Harry blinked a few times. “I feel like I should have been taking notes.”
"So," Now that he had Draco all flustered, he decided he might as well keep it up, "I believe in the hospital we agreed we were going to discuss finally having sex?"
"Can't believe what has come to what?"
He gulped and wrapped a hand around himself. He moaned softly and started moving his hand back and forth, the callous on his thumb making his hips jerk each time he touched his own tip.
Harry nodded and rushed towards the door, glancing around and seeing a nurse standing down the hall. He hurried over to the man and made it halfway there before he was noticed. "Daphne said Astoria Greengrass is moving."
the furniture that Harry acquired from your other properties.” She knew that Harry was uncomfortable with the idea of keeping house elves. Ever since Dobby, he saw them as his equals, and it was hard for him to hold someone in servitude given his childhood.
She was cut off by a male voice, Lucius, who had just entered the room. “He hasn't tried to relieve his stress with you, has he? I can think of quite a few ways that could be accomplished. But given your lack of bruises, I suppose it's safe to say he's yet to try anything violent. Doesn't narrow down the list completely, though.” He commended, finally vocalizing Narcissa's concern.
Harry took a deep breath and seemed to think over it a moment before answering. "I think so. I was thinking we explain the department outline in layman terms for the preliminary vote, and whenever Greenwood finishes the associated laws, we'll have him come in and speak at the secondary vote." The first vote was to introduce the department and see if everyone agreed with it's purpose, functions, and abilities. If they did, it moved on to it's second and final vote. He wasn't worried about it because public support was so high that there was almost no room for opposition. "I'm more worried for Pawk's bill."
They were both drained and their eyes were closed. Sleep crept and stole them away. Neither knew when they fell asleep but it took them over completely. Time went on as their eyes occasionally fluttered open but never for long. They stayed in each others arms, tangled on the sofa, wrestling sleep and consciousness until the evening fell to night. For one lucid moment, Harry was so incredibly aware. His eyes peeked open and he was struck by the heart-wrenching realization that everything that's happened to him, and everything he had ever done, lead to this one moment of peace. Despite it all, he wouldn't change a thing. If he could choose, he knew he would choose this moment, he would choose Draco, every single time. That's how he knew he was falling in love. It was insane to him how he could look up at the sleeping blonde and not see him the same way he did only yesterday, or even a few hours ago. Everything was different now and he couldn't go back. He didn't want to go back. The past had lost all meaning and he only knew now.
Teddy stuck half his hand in his mouth and hummed happily. He then picked up one toy and handed it to Harry.
The next day, Harry and Draco made the cover of The Daily Prophet, as promised. Harry actually cut out a picture of them dancing and put it beside his bed. Of course, Draco noticed the newspaper missing it’s photo when he saw it in the bin, but he didn’t say anything. He was quite flattered by it and thought it was incredibly sweet of him. As time went on, they came to make the cover of The Daily Prophet four days in a row. The stories about them were wild as they had nothing but a dance to go off of. Witches Weekly believed that the two were in a relationship, The Quibbler tried to stay unbiased and only reported on what could be observed, but The Daily Prophet went wild each day. On the first day, they reported the dance, then it became a story of Draco having Harry under Amortentia, then it was the other way around, and by day four it was about Harry using Draco as some sort of political plot to further his own agenda. But somehow, neither cared, and actually found it to be quite hilarious.
“That’s it. I already said I was going to get you for teasing me, but now, it’ll be even worse.”
Harry knew he couldn't possibly be easy to live with, especially given the circumstances, but he didn't think it had been that troublesome. It wasn't as if he was requiring Draco to make serious changes to accommodate for his mental health. He had asked nothing of Draco. He just didn't understand why it even had to be brought up. Of all the insults, of all the quips, why did he have to say
The two spent the next twenty minutes looking over the language, with Draco explaining what things meant and helping him edit anything that wasn’t to his liking.
Narcissa finally divorced Lucius. She’d also gotten him into a bit of trouble. He’d been tried for his crimes as a dark wizard, but his blackmailing, slander, and threats had gone unchecked. She sent an anonymous letter to Wizengamot, detailing and giving evidence of all the smaller crimes Lucius had gotten away with. It was enough to have him convicted once more. With him away, she filed for divorced, and became a free woman.
Hermione and Ron told Harry that he and Draco were becoming like Dean and Seamus. Neville told Harry he needed to go ahead and confess his feelings to Draco because it was obvious that Draco felt the same way. Dean and Seamus immediately began shipping Harry and Draco.
Harry was in the restricted section, halfway into S and swapping out one book for another when Draco came storming through. He walked right in to the restricted section and grabbed Harry’s wrist when he set his book down.
The entire table saw the way Draco displayed his jealousy and were immediately drawn in by all it implied. It implied that Draco had some sort of pre-established claim over Harry that went beyond a loveless marriage contract.
Harry sat up and immediately felt panicked. His first thought being that either Draco was hurt or someone had broken in. “What?” He had pushed himself back into his knees.
“Those are worth more than your life.” Harry mocked, that being what Draco said when Harry had done the same to him a few weeks ago. He still wasn’t over it.
“Perhaps.” She said, looking him up and down. She seemed to be mulling something over in her head. Eventually, she came to a decision. “You have my support, Potter. In your department and Pawk’s bill.”
"Of course, your highness." Harry mumbled as he started pulling out different bells and baubles for the tree. Eventually, he handed Draco one bag while he kept the other and they decorated the tree together. Though Draco did make him move a few ornaments around, Harry didn't mind. He saw the blonde's passion for the holidays, and he didn't know much about decorating himself, so he was fine with letting Draco create his vision of the perfect holiday scenery.
“So what were you saying about my thighs?” That part stuck out to him.
Part of him felt ridiculous and girlish for putting such an importance on a ring and a wedding. But after seeing his friends get married in front of everyone they loved, it made him realize that he wanted that as well. He didn’t want to keep calling Draco his “boyfriend”, and he didn’t want them to just decide to change the word to “husband” without it really meaning anything.
Dean and Seamus exchanged a look, knowing they had probably been worse.
He messed his hair up a bit again, and then decided to put his hair back in it’s usual formal style. He decided it was best that way.
Narcissa raised an eyebrow. “He doesn't make you cook or clean?”
Teddy blew raspberries at Harry.
Draco slid beside Harry and felt the other wrapping his arms around him. “Better?”
Harry seemed to live in his own little world and Draco felt that he could only admire from a distance, never having, only pining. A pained and frustrated expression took over his face as he saw Harry hadn’t even noticed him. He shifted a bit, hoping the movement would catch his eye, but it didn’t. He picked up his journal and pen, doing a bit of writing. Though it wasn’t time yet, he decided to go ahead and write out a scene in which the lawyer would pine for the photographer. Though he tried to focus on the reflective scene, he kept looking up at Harry, waiting to be seen. If they were together it would be different. If they were together, Draco would have no qualms in straddling Harry’s lap and kissing him for attention. But he couldn’t do that. His heart lurched forward like a stray animal to a warm soul, what his body wished it could do. He wrote as quickly as he could, letting all of his feelings out.
When he entered, Seamus stood to greet him and Draco made his way over to the little table in the corner. He sat down with a soft smile as the scent of coffee beans hit him from the other’s cup. Although he wasn't a huge fan of coffee, he liked the smell and didn't mind kissing the flavor off of a man's lips, as he did to a coy Hufflepuff in year five.
“I’ll see you tomorrow then?”
Harry got up and spread the word, he went to every table and told them that this year we’re cheering for Slytherins too.
Harry smirked to himself and immediately decided that when everyone comes back, it was gonna be Draco covered in marks and not him.
Harry ignored the little shake in his hands along the keys of the keyboard and kept typing.
“That old coot? I hate that you have to take orders from him. You’re a better Healer than him, and he knows it,” Pansy scoffed.
“No, not until I say,” Draco pushed back. His own thighs were trembling from the effort and he was just about ready to let go—but he held on to give Harry the longest session he could. “You’d think by now you’d have learned a little patience, but no. I’m going to have to keep teaching you this same lesson forever, aren’t I?”
His eyes stayed glued to Malfoy—was that a new shirt? Of course it was, it was after Christmas and it clung to him so well—as he stood up with a half-eaten plate of Thai food and tossed it into the trash. Ron let out a shocked whimper.
Draco on the other hand had seen all this before, and was completely nonplussed. “Madam, Mistress,” he greeted the two women fondly. “You’ve thrown quite the party. Anyone of interest show up before us?”
“Oh, Draco,” Narcissa remembered. “The lawyers are on the case of whoever leaked your letters and say they are close to something. Have you been able to find anything out? It could help them greatly.”
“I’ve done it!” Finally, Remus had tied his shoes. The knots were childishly large and loose, but he’d done it. “I’m a genius. I should go to muggle university.”
“I can’t sleep,” Harry admitted. “I slept on the plane and now I’m awake while being tired all at once.”
“What? What’s not gay about how I dress?” Ron asked, offended. He looked down to his black Auror robes in disappointment. He’d thought the gay from Harry would rub off on him at some point, since Harry had been too respectful to actually rub off on him back in school.
They’d both had a hard time getting to sleep. Draco tried everything from warm milk to back rubs on the both of them but nothing had soothed their mutual anxiety. “Everything is stupid,” Harry grumbled into his husband’s skin.
And finally: Holy shit, he’d sexted Draco Malfoy.
A few thrusts later and Draco was done in as well, filling the cavern with his seed as he’d promised he would. He rode out the sensation until he couldn’t anymore, release bringing a prick of tears to the corners of his eyes. Sensation still swept all over his body, aftershocks riding the last of his pleasure and sapping him of all the energy he’d used at once.
“How did you meet Chris?” Draco questioned.
Draco smirked, quite pleased with himself. Perversely, he thought of how proud his younger self would be of him, pinning The Great Harry Potter to a bed and making him whine like a girl with a few touches.
Woo! This took 5ever for me to get onto paper, but I really like the way this is shaping up. Thanks again, guys! This one is for Marco, because he’s my little babby.
This would be the first time he was allowed to be inside of Draco, and the thought alone excited Harry so much he was almost shaking under Draco’s molten kisses.
Harry was sure Draco would do something annoying and dick-esque that would make him forget it soon enough anyway.
As for the rest of Harry’s mess his cute little costume was all sullied. Draco looked up from between his legs with complete satisfaction about this. “That’s my boy,” he breathed, still trying to catch his own breath. “But don’t go thinking you can relax now. I promised you much more tonight.”
Harry shook his head. “None yet. They’ll come,” he murmured. “But, until then… I’m really happy you have this job, and proud of you for how many people you’ve helped—saved even. I’ll be here for you when you get back, Daddy.”
Draco didn’t even reply. He dropped to his knees and yanked down Harry’s black trousers and pants to get to him. Shocked, all Harry had to do was press the ‘enter’ button before the microwave roared to life.
“What?”
“Uh,” Harry began. Damn that blonde and his penchant for seeing Harry flustered. “Well. There’s a crack on one of the vertebrae, which means…”
“Draco, have you lost your—“
“I’ll go first, bring the cloak,” Draco ordered in almost eerily-calm and analytical way. His fight-or-flight-or-freeze instinct had settled on rage, rage against the hand he’d been dealt. Having his unconventional sex life used for the commercial gain of some conservative rag? It lit a fire in his lizard brain. Having his parents read said article? No, that wasn’t happening. “France Estate!” he shouted after grabbing a handful of Floo power, not looking back and trusting that Harry would follow.
“Fuck you, ‘I’m angry’. How could I not be angry?” she demanded. “One out of every three women will be raped in her life. Hate crimes happen every day, and politicians try and take the rights of the oppressed away. Open your eyes, Zeke! Look all around you! Look at the poverty, look at the disease, and look at the way people wage war on one another! People keep dying, and my mother and father were just bricks in the wall.
"Right, so that's why you took a job as the host of an MTV show," Draco snorted right back. "Excellent planning."
“This is a joke, fuck, it has to be,” he tried. “Fuck, fuck, god damn shit mother
“Good.”
“Consider me warned.”
Lucius Malfoy and Marcus Nott had grown up in a different world from the world their sons were in. They ruled with money—and with tyranny. From embezzling to ‘taking care’ of business competition, they used to think themselves above the law. Lucius eventually got over that and rose to a job in the government where he would only break minor laws, but Theo’s father never did.
Once again, Hermione Weasley née Granger found herself on a patient’s slab at St. Mungo’s.
Grace nodded. She winced when Narcissa dragged the brush through a particularly thick knot. “Ow.”
Quicksand around his ankles, a plastic bag over his head—Harry fought to break free.
Remus tried to think of a time other than the making of the Marauders Map where Padfoot exercised cartography and failed to find any memories. “Sure. Anyway, in fourth year he sent us on a buried treasure hunt after having stolen some of our favorite things,” he went on. “He kidnapped my Fitzgerald books, James’ glasses, and Wormtail’s shoe. It was cruel that way, since he only had one shoe to run around in.”
Harry shook his head. “No, uh. I got you something.” He reached under his bed and pulled out the bouquet. “I uh, it’s for Valentine’s Day.” He said softly, giving Draco the flowers.
Half of Harry’s brain is screaming
“Were you not listening?” Draco says, looking down his nose at this oversized ball of muscle. “I’m just fine up here. In no need of assistance. And you are not adding much to the quality of the conversation, so if you could go away, I’d very much appreciate it.”
“So easy,” Harry whispers to the sloshing reheated sludge in his cup. “I wouldn’t even need a wand.” These days, Harry could manage most of his healing spells wandless.
“You look better,” Draco says when Harry pads down the hall to find him. It’s late, Harry realizes, too late for visitors, but Draco’d asked him over, had said it was okay. He’s sitting right there on the couch, a mug pressed to his lips.
“Somewhere quiet,” Malfoy calls over his shoulder. “To drink this, I think,” and Harry remembers the wine in his other hand.
“Are you not familiar with Shakespeare? My my, you must have been quite preoccupied with your criminal activities before landing in my shop.”
Harry can feel Draco nodding, but can’t look at him. “He wasn’t even important. Not really. I didn’t know him, he wasn’t a regular patient. He wasn’t a friend. He was just a nice man who died.”
“It’s nice,” Harry says. He has no control of what tumbles out of him now. Impulse has conducted a hostile takeover of his vocal chords. “Seeing you like this.”
These days, he doesn’t even try. “Menace,” he growls and magics the shards of glass into the bin.
“You’re the actual worst, Potter,” Pansy says, a bit manic but less angry than before. “You’re stale laundry and an unnecessary movie sequel. You’re all of the bad things.”
Malfoy could do whatever he pleased, whether that involved Harry or not. Whether it involved kissing Harry, or not, on a balcony, with the taste of smoke and lemon lingering on his lips.
“Draco?” Pansy prompts. “What happened?”
“Waiting will not improve the situation,” his mother says beside him. People have already noticed them. The news of Draco and Narcissa Malfoy is a flock of birds taking off, as the word seems to spread.
“Fuck off, Malfoy,” Potter says, tucking that brutal face behind a mask of confidence. He strides away with the same easy confidence the real Potter had always managed, the wind making his robes dramatic.
“That’s not!— I didn’t!” Harry is shouting now, but not in complete sentences.
“You?” Harry says to the traffic. “Worried about me?”
“Right,” Granger says, striding down Diagon with the confidence of someone who has saved the world. “Follow me, then.”
Harry blinks once, twice, trying to fend off the hurricane of exhaustion with a tiny paddle.
“Don’t stop. Please—”
The bag of vomit drops to the floor as Mike collapses, limp and vacant. The heart monitor starts to scream and Harry feels his world shift. “Okay, everyone away from the bed!” he says, loud. Rita’s hand stills and falls away.
“And you’re only coming to Granger now? Really, you’ve saved the world several times over in much more efficient fashion. I’m beginning to think that it was Granger who did the heavy lifting. She’s certainly the one doing it now.”
he thinks.
Reflex nearly blurts,
It’s his last night as a free man and, while he will never tell her, there is no one he’d rather spend it with than Pansy Parkinson.
Harry stands in the entranceway until his toes get cold. A part of him hopes that Draco will come back, that Harry will throw the door open and press that lovely blond head tight against his chest, and that everything will be forgiven.
he realizes and what a concept that is—to live a life free from wartime ideology and the pressures of life and death. Seventeen-year-old shoulders were never meant to carry something so heavy, and it’s nice to see a version of himself smiling across the cab of an old truck—even if the American accent makes his skin crawl.
“I love you too,” Draco whispers, when he thinks no one’s watching. And this is his Draco, Harry remembers. “I love you too,” Draco says again, and Harry believes him.
“You’re upset. No, don’t argue with me,” Hermione says, cutting Harry off before the words have formed on his lips. “Stop pretending. It’s really quite pointless.”
* * *
“Uh. Was s’posed to be off twenty minutes ago,” Harry says. “But I’ve got charting. My nemesis.”
A strong hand latches onto his calf, stubby fingernails digging into his flesh. “What the fuck—” Draco starts, but then he falls, and he’s not sure which way the scales of fate have tipped when the back of his head cracks against the pavement and the world goes black.
Harry’s not ready for him to disappear again, and so pushes through the door and collapses into another chair. The cheap plastic wheels scrape the tile.
The angst was always going to come in twos. Two chapters, one past and one present, where the story dips low. Hold on, friends <3
“That the entire wizarding world would forgive my sins? That I would settle into high society and rule the world from the various important boards I would inevitably find myself sitting on?”
“You’re deflecting and in an act so gracious that you will never truly deserve me, I’m going to let this one slide.” Pansy’s fingers combs through damp tangles.
“I suppose we are,” she says, breathy. “Now, pull yourself together. It’s far too cold to be weeping in the middle of the lane.”
“Since that night at the pub.”
Harry thought. Neither man seemed to know that Harry was there, tucked away next to the lonely plant. Malfoy’s eyes were closed, his head pressed back against the damp brick, his neck stretched long.
“Shhh,” Draco says. “I’ve got you.”
“Does this have anything to do with Potter?”
“And music,” he says, once he’s emptied a full bottle of red. “I need music.”
“Yes.” Potter’s always been hopelessly earnest.
Ron pushes his way into their circle of scheming—not one to be left out—to peer at the page. “Wait. That’s not—” He gives Hermione a skeptical look. “That’s not how summoning charms usually work, Mione. Harry struggled to summon his broom from across Hogwarts. How is he going to pull someone out of another fucking universe?”
Harry thinks, mourning the loss of his favourite tumbler.
No answer.
“What night?” Harry says, helping Ron collect his mass of case notes and settle them into piles.
“Hey!” Harry shouts, knowing enough to realize that this wasn’t flattering.
“You’re just jealous that you’ve never gotten to make that kind of entrance,” Pansy says.
“Don’t tell me what I deserve!” Draco’s shoulders are heaving, his breaths coming in painful gasps.
Draco wobbles across the room and collapses into the cushions of his sectional. “I’m never doing that again.”
Draco thinks.
The crowd ignores it, someone kicks him in the spine, his mother is crying…
Draco goes missing, Harry goes a bit mad, and breaking and entering really isn’t all that bad—not when it’s done in the public interest. Right? (No Harry. Just no.)
Draco sobs, buries his face in Harry’s chest, but Harry is enraptured, presses Draco’s forearm to his lips and just holds it there. “Beautiful,” Harry mumbles against the skin. “So beautiful.”
Jet black hair is stark against the white light. Draco’s still fixed on Potter, on the way Harry bows his head, as if in prayer.
“It’s probably your subconscious latching onto your suppressed adolescent urges,” Hermione has said once Harry had gotten the words out.
“Anything.” Books collapse, pages spilling, spines leaning, stories splayed open. The living room spins.
“Bella,” Harry says, trying to infuse his words with the assertiveness of an apex predator.
“We sacrificed so much. It seems stupid to tear ourselves apart now,” Potter says, letting out a breath he must’ve been holding. “It’s over. Just let it be over.” Draco can hear all of Potter’s bruises in this final line; he sounds so tired.
“Are we going to talk about it?” she says, eventually.
The mania in those lovely grey eyes stretches wide. “I didn’t want to leave,” Draco says, still in his coat, still in his shoes. “It wasn’t on purpose.”
“Okay. How did you end up as a counsellor?”
That, more than anything else, had been the problem with Daniel. He represented possibility. The possibility that someone could look at him with affection rather than loathing, that he could be loved.
Harry had said a hundred times.
,” Harry had said, time and time again. “
“I heard you, son. Come down so that I can speak with you.”
Strings of light exploded from his wand, plain and colourless and Harry waited. The air smelled of iron and frost and Harry blinked over and over—tried to banish the red spots from his vision.
, Draco realizes.
The foot on his neck presses harder, and Draco chokes. A puff of dust explodes around his mouth, into his eyes. “Hurry! It’s Malfoy. He’s here!”
The stone lip of the pensive curls up at him in disdain.
“Yes, that was rather hasty,” Hermione adds, and Harry sinks glumly into the couch cushions, the exhaustion inflating behind his eyes and just pushing. “We’re not sixteen anymore Harry. I thought you knew better.”
But Pansy isn’t cleaning. She’s gathering all of the little vials, setting each of them back into the box. “What are those?” Harry asks, because there must be dozens.
, Draco thinks. It can’t be, because it’s a memory. Draco remembers this night after Potter had cut him open. It had stretched long and lonely, the despair dark as Potter's horrible hair, because Draco now knew the  price for the crimes he’d planned to carry out. The cost of standing against the Boy Who Lived.
“You’re not?” Draco asked, because in what universe could they ever be friends?
“Who you got there?” asks a girl with a fringe cut high on her forehead. There’s two red spots on her cheeks.
“I died,” Harry whispers. Draco probably knows this—rumours of something close to the truth had made it to the biographers, who’d picked over his life story like carrion crows and published the scraps for the world to see. “Sometimes, I feel like I’m a corpse who puts a body on every day.”
“Mine,” Harry says against Draco’s lips, into his mouth, out of his mind. “Mine.”
While Draco is gallivanting across the universes, he discovers that one good turn probably deserves another.
Draco types a message. Deletes it. Types again. Deletes.
For a moment, all of Harry’s focus is pared down to the single point where green eyes meet grey. It’s intense, so intense that it hurts. And it’s
“I think you have an unhealthy tendency to put Potter on a pedestal,” Pansy says, and she sounds so fucking mature about it Draco wants to flick a peanut at her.
“Everything, I think,” Pansy says. “The curse, the words, the location where Draco found the stupid thing—”
Somewhere, Harry is sure that the rest of the patrons are moaning their disapproval, but the glint in Draco’s eye is every good thing distilled to a single moment. “You’re the one who exposed me to these spicey ladies.”
“He wasn’t ever wrong,” Harry says, anger hot in his chest as he remembers Pansy’s face when she’d said, “he thought there was something wrong with him. Was obsessed with being better. With being good enough for this universe.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I was high as a kite and a bit emotionally compromised when a Muggle police officer found me,” says Draco, grimacing. The memory is not a pleasant one.
“Send her to the ballroom,” Draco says. “I’ll be down shortly.”
“Turn around,” Harry says and there’s really no questioning it now.
“I…” Harry almost loses his nerve. But the words were poison and they needed to come out. “Malfoy,” he says, lowering his eyes. “I think I might fancy Malfoy.”
“Proceed with your concerns,” Draco says, folding the piece of paper and carefully and putting it in his pocket.
“I’m gonna—please—I’m—”
“Is that you Drac—oh no. No, you don’t!” Harry hears…
The ancient register is sticking again. Robertson insists on using an outdated metal contraption that could be confused with a torture device and whose handle refuses to budge on the regular. “Robertson,” Draco shouts in a vague direction—there’s really no telling from where the man will emerge. “The register is being contrary again. I need you to do whatever it is that you do and make it open.”
Draco sob in the floor’s general direction. “What an astute assessment.”
“I can’t believe Potter!” Pansy greets him with a shout, tapping her acrylic nails on the tabletop. Pansy chatters non-stop about how horrible the Muggle world is, how slow and dirty and inconvenient. And then she turns up with fake nails and, today, with frosted tips.
“I suppose, given your sordid history, you may not know that force is not the only way into the interior of very ancient cash registers,” Robertson says, looking down at Draco’s sprawling form on the floor.
Viola Pinkerton’s body is convulsing on the floor.
After an hour passes, though, Harry thanks Emma and shows himself out. He definitely doesn’t spend five minutes scrutinizing the pile of shoes, nor does he notice that Malfoy’s lovely leather boots are no longer there.
business—may even be starting to
“I’m not just going to forget about you. Like, I’m not a complete arsehole.”
“I do,” Draco says, knowing it’s an empty promise—the chances of Robertson running into Potter are miniscule, even without considering Potter’s aversion to the written word—but taking him up on the offer anyways. Robertson means well, even in his eccentricities. “Ensure that he’s equipped to woo me properly, will you?”
“I thought I was your nemesis.” Malfoy almost looks offended.
“Right,” Hermione says, voice brittle with confidence. “Harry, you stay there. I’m going to cast a gentle sleeping charm. Just enough to put you just beneath the surface.”
Harry can’t even be bothered to defend himself when Hermione says, “Oh yes. If not by Devil’s Snare, then definitely a slow death by poison.”
Tightrope walking, Draco thinks. That’s all this is. Tightrope walking without a net.
For those of you who
“Speak? At his trial?”
“When are you off?”
Harry tried to shuffle, quietly, behind the minimal leafy plumage.
“Well, Potter is Jesus,” Draco says, impatiently. “Obviously.”
“In this universe?” Pansy keeps prodding, as if testing his structural integrity.
The tears are red hot under his eyelids and Draco looks up at into the horrible florescence to keep the damn from bursting. “I’m also hopelessly in love with someone who will never want me back. Although that issue is currently a close second to the whole my-poor-choices-have-come-back-and-wrecked-vicious-vengeance thing I mentioned earlier.”
“Aren’t there assessments?” Draco waves his hand, as if conjuring the paperwork he’d expected to see. “
“We think that the your dreams will establish a connection. Think about this collection of universes less as a list and more as a wheel,” Hermione says, gesturing absently at an image in one of the books on the floor. “You’re at the centre, Harry.”
They are clinging together when the curse comes for them. They tip over the edge of the world, tumbling through a yellow ocean and a light at the top of the stair, across fields of snow and a tightrope between life and death.
“Yeah,” Harry said, following his gaze.
A bald head spins around, and the expression on the face attached is rouge. “Got a problem?” he asks, lips smacking on each syllable.
“You mean that you were riding Granger’s coattails while she did all the work?” Ron chokes, but Pansy’s relentless. “I think I’ve got the dynamic figured out.”
Draco had whispered. His Draco. His.
“Thanks?” Draco takes the paper.
Slowly, Draco lowers his hand from the fist-clenched position.
“She never licks my fingers,” Harry muttered, glaring at his stupid cat. “I can’t believe you convinced me to get a pet.”
“Where are you headed?” Granger asks. “I’ll take you.”
and a
“Or are you a hopeless flaneur, traipsing the cityscape and making it your own?”
Fucking Malfoy, who always knew how to get under his skin and just stay there. Who hadn’t said thank you, who had fled the Ministry after his trial and hadn’t looked back. Until that awful night at St. Mungo’s, when everything had gone wrong—
It feels intrusive, somehow, as he watches himself pull Draco tight against his chest, press his nose to Draco’s neck, breathe in the smell of him and shudder against the swell of Draco’s breathing. “I love you,” this Harry says, lips against the knob in his spine. And again, “I love you,” into white blond hair.
The words are a tether, a germ around which he can remember what it feels like to stand. Harry blinks, realizes he has eyes, and then looks around, realizes there is something to look at.
Eventually, Potter starts to monologue. It’s with less bluster than usual, so Draco knows he must’ve practiced. Which means that this intervention on his behalf was planned in advance.
Harry kept stealing glances, flashing over when he thought Draco was dozing or staring out the window. He’d lingered.
read it, I hope you enjoyed the reference to the 2002 Renault Mégane coupé.
“I can’t believe I’m doing this with a death eater,” and Draco had started to understand. Had known that he was a thrill and not a person. But Draco had shut Not-Potter up with his mouth and chased the stranger’s release to its peak.
“Please don’t make it a thing.”
“How about
Draco flinches. “Stop it.”
Five years ago, in those days and weeks after the war that had wept like an open wound, Harry’d had no idea what he wanted to do with his life. A year of chasing and being chased by a sadist megalomaniac had really put him off magical law enforcement. Ron began Auror training and Harry did not.
“Potter! Have you been to see the kid in trauma bay 4?” Dr. Horwood says from somewhere, and Harry cranes his neck trying to find her.
“Hang on, I’ll help.”
“What did you expect? A dungeon?”
“I know it’s a bit weird,” Harry tried again, feeling sheepish. “But I’m not trying to be. Weird, that is.”
“Oh, I don’t know,” Pansy says. “Perhaps it was the phrase ALL BY MYSELF, booming over and over so loudly that I could hear you from the street?”
, they said.
“I’m so sorry.”
“Handover—” Harry tries to say. “Have to go—”
Even with the night dark outside the windows, the room is still bright.
“At the end, I asked for a look,” Draco says, much more quietly. “Up until that point, I think he found my naivete charming rather than manic.”
“Oh, aren’t you the pinnacle of wit. What a brilliant comeback, Potter. Have you always been this clever?”
“After you,” Ron finishes for her. Hermione blushes, but carries on.
“I’m telling the truth!”
Everything is quiet, the calm after the chaos, until—
“He’s said he had to fix something,” Pansy gasps from her spot on the floor amongst all of Hermione’s papers and theories. “What if it was Potter?”
Harry scowls. “It shouldn’t be, should it?”
Harry think, as he lifts his hand to knock anyway. Self-preservation had always fled the stage whenever Malfoy was due to feature.
“I had no idea recreational gaming could be so—” Hermione slides into the booth. “Intense?”
“Why can’t we just…just stop…”
The music was softer outside, muted like the sound waves were travelling underwater. A remix of fucking Celestina Warbeck’s
Harry opens his mouth to protest, to say that he was supposed to be updating Hermione and not some Slytherin-turned-Muggle fanatic, but Pansy beats him to it.
hands that are shaking. The soft brush of silk drifts across his skin as Draco folds the tie into a clean Half Windsor. Draco lets his pinky finger drift across Harry’s neck and feels him shudder.
“You’ll need to control that temper, Mr. Potter,” Dr. Horwood says after the balding security guard deposits Harry into the arms of his supervisor. “The sick leave of a fellow hospital employee should not elicit such a reaction.”
“This is nice,” Harry says, letting his eyes move over Malfoy’s Adam’s apple, up his chin, over his closed eyelids.
Muggle music knocks around the empty walls, the sultry tones of Will Smith bouncing off vaulted ceilings.
“There is more than one crisis worker,” she finally says, as if this should be obvious. “Which one are you looking for?”
“Mione, c’mon!” Ron hollers, but he needn’t have bothered. Hermione is stomping down the stairs, her feet heavy with sleep, hair a wild halo around her face.
“Regardless! Nearing the end of the play, Hamlet finds himself in a graveyard. Surrounded by,” Robertson lowers his voice ominously, “bodies.”
“I’ll help you.” Hermione had smiled then, and for a second, the world flickered into colour. “He called me a Mud—a nasty slur and he stomped on your face and he poisoned Ron.”
Not easy.
“That’s unnecessary.”
Draco though and Harry answered. With his mouth.
Grey eyes rove over his face, catalogue his reactions. “Would you like to?”
It’s a good thing, too.
“Wow,” Harry breathes, overwhelmed with the intensity of the place. “Just…wow.” Careful not to tread on the pages, Harry wanders the maze, breathing. Just breathing.
The fast-talking man is replaced with something much more soothing. “Oh! This is by Lenny Kravitz."
Potter—no,
Harry handles him with care. It’s hard to know how long. The grief is timeless.
He’d known that the wards would prevent him from apparating straight to Malfoy Manor proper and so Harry had come as close as he could, landing at the top of the drive. He hadn’t thought about the hows of getting past the fence or what he would say if he had to explain. Foresight had never been his strong suit.
There’s a light at the top of the stairs, and Draco sees the shadows first. Dark blunted angles, of hair that refuses to sit flat. The light hits his face and Draco really should have known.
The fire burns soft in the grate, embers crackling into the silence. Draco pulls at the sleeve of his shirt.
pulsed behind the metal doors and Harry hated that song almost as much as he hated the panic attacks. The night air was tinged with an edge of cigarette smoke and Harry felt his heart start to slow. “Not dying,” he whispered, and looked around.
Nothing.
“Was. And he was acquitted, or have you already forgotten.”
For the first time in years, Harry calls in. He expects a stern lecture about the importance of dependability and taking his training seriously, but Dr. Horwood gives the auditory equivalent of a shrug on the phone and wishes him a speedy recovery.
“I just, I never thought I’d see you again—”
Her search of the room complete, Pansy steps towards Harry and presses the box into his arms. “Of you,” she says. “They’re all of you.”
* * *
“We’ll be admitting your daughter,” Harry says, over his shoulder. “For monitoring and bloodwork.”
“S’let me get this straight?” Ron had said, and then cackled into his cup. “You’re dreaming about domestic bliss with Malfoy?”
A match lights in Harry’s heart. “Weeks?”
“—the way he’d seemed to…” Pansy bites her lip; it’s painted bright red. “Fade. He was fading. I didn’t notice him half the time, even when he must’ve been home in the flat. Usually his voice could bring me back, and I’d remember, but it was getting worse.”
“—seriously Draco, this is a fucking problem.”
Pansy looks up, sees him, and Draco can breathe again. “Oh?” says Pansy, “look at you, waxing philosophical.”
“You okay? Do you need me to get the nurse?”
“Took you long enough, honestly,” Ron says as Hermione puts the kettle on. “I’ve known you fancied him for years.”
* * *
“That’s it. That simple?”
“Absolutely not,” she says, poking at the pills with his pinky finger. “We will sort out whatever that stupid curse means by
“You’re clearly going through something.”
“Unlike some common criminals, I have good manners,” Pansy says on her way into the kitchen, shouting, “Don’t touch anything else!” as she goes.
“Are you sure?” Draco whispers.
“Books!” Ron shrieks, gesticulating around the living room wildly. “As if we needed more of those!”
The Muggle Auror glowers. “There’s two ways this night ends,” he shouts over the sirens, which are still bellowing their displeasure into the night. “With you nice and safe in your bed or with you in a cell. So just step off the fucking ledge.”
He hasn’t been listening.
, Draco’d said a lifetime ago. Sorrys would send them stumbling down a cliff of regret that only turned their past into a bottomless pit. It was pointless. “I’m sorry,” Harry finishes anyway.
Until Draco looks up from his knees.
He’d wanted to wait him out at first. Draco had to come home sometime. It was his flat. But frustration quickly mellowed to shame. If Draco didn’t want him, if he was so averse to the idea of what they’d done that he’d left his own flat rather than face it, well…
“I’m sorry, but you’re trying to squeeze water out of a rock, Draco,” a woman says. Harry’s hand freezes.
If Harry’s heart rate increases when he sees Malfoy’s office door open, it’s the brusqueness of his pace.
Draco sniffs. His nose is running but he’s not got the energy for embarrassment just now. John hands him a small tissue box.
Draco’s mouth is dry. “I won’t leave.”
A part of him yearns for a hint of half-moon spectacles and a simpler ending. Cleaner. More finite. Where the corpse inside of him can rest. Harry gulps. Squeezes back. “No. Let’s go.”
“It wasn’t
“And you’re a villain,” she says, collapsing onto the couch. Draco knows he’ll find her there, mascara smudged, the sparkles of her eyeshadow dusting her cheeks, beautiful in that fallen-angel sort of way that Pansy is so good at.
Like everything with them, it isn’t easy. Draco is pricklier than razer wire and more potent than undiluted bobtuber puss. He spends far too much time on his facial routine and sings Muggle pop songs loud enough to wake the neighbours. He has an unhealthy relationship with house his plants—which Bella loathes on principle and maims in protest. The screaming matches between man and feline are battles for the ages. Sometimes, on bad days, Draco insists on searching Harry’s face, holding him still and running his long fingers over skin and bone, looking for something that only he can see.
(a brilliant fic that I love more than Pansy loves nail varnish). It's a wonderful read, if you've not experienced it already <3
They had done some recognizance since the first glimpse—that’s what Draco’s started to call them.
Two words slot into place. “Another universe?”
, Harry thinks, much later, as he straddles Draco’s hips and the pretences of a universe they both yearned for but never expected to have fade away. “Every single one,” Harry breathes, and lowers himself down, revels in the fullness of it, the way Draco’s eyes flutter closed. There is bliss in the sweat and soft sounds and Draco’s thumbs clinging to his pulse point. Harry lifts his chin to the ceiling, lolls his head back and breathes. The promise turns to air, slipping into his lungs and drowning him in a certainty he’s never known.
* * *
he thinks, and they lift her together.
“I really fucked this one,” Harry says to his knees.
“In the med office. Away from…I mean, can we talk in the office!”
Draco looks up at Harry.
Because dream Malfoy and real Malfoy aren’t the same and he doesn’t care anyways. Because he’s not supposed to want this and Malfoy can leave if he wants to.
“It was scribbled in a margin. Anima Revelare.” Draco whispers the name of the curse.
“Right,” Draco says, every shade of bewildered. “See you around?”
“Of course not,” he snaps, and the fury is back. Does his own mother think so little of him? That he would beg for the saviour’s help? But then he remembers Potter, shoulders squared against the public who loathed Draco and the Wizengamot who wanted to make an example of him. Remembers Potter’s voice—low and even—when he’d said, “
“Are you planning on assessing that patient?” Horwood had gestured at the room where Malfoy was and Harry knew that he
It chimes again, and Bella starts to howl in protest.
“Not obviously,” Potter said and he was blushing. Harry Potter. Blushing. “You glare, mostly.”
The shift hadn’t been linear. There was no slow build towards compassion. No steely decision to lock every death eater up and throw away the key. No one could agree, and so the people pushed and pulled and tore each other apart.
“What are you on about?”
“What the fuck are you doing here?” Ron explodes onto the scene a few hours later, covered in dirt and someone else’s blood. At some point during the morning, Hermione had sent a Patronus with the address and a short explanation that Ron was currently calling, “Needlessly cryptic, Mione!”
Grudgingly, despairing of his head strong tendencies and refusal to listen to his mother, Narcissa had relented. If they were going to take their first step back into a public space, they would do it together.
“Uh? Draco Malfoy?” Harry says, rubbing the back of his neck. This was a terrible idea. It would probably be better to just run now and—
“Draco!” Harry recognizes one of the paramedics, who’s got his head in the lap of a very pretty blonde girl.
Understanding had roared through him, then. Eventually, this spell would kill him—peel him away until there wasn’t anything left.
“Where are we going to get
“Oh.”
the curse says. But Draco can’t. Not yet. Not until he’s fixed this. Until he’s taken this ragged draft of a man and redrawn his lines.
“What? Oh, no.”
Draco’s tucked into a couch cushion, and Harry sits on the other end. There’s a cup of something waiting for him. The steam fogs his glasses.
“Come closer.”
Pansy drags him to the bar, her eyes all pupil, giggling uncontrollably. “Six shots of Jäger!” she shouts the order at the bartender, fighting with the music and a hundred other crushed bodies for his attention.
“You didn’t tell me,” Draco says, glancing at his mother’s kindness, which is now splayed across the end table in close ups of hardwood floors and breezy windows.
“It’s so obvious in retrospect,” Pansy is saying as Harry lays down, head settling into the cushions, and loses his grip on the world. “He would’ve died first year without you, wouldn’t he?”
Granger nods, but she’s still looking at Draco. Bushy hair shades him from the sun and he can’t place what he sees in his face.
Draco had thought.
“Bella, no,” Harry says, holding her gaze. She does not respond well to weakness.
“He’s probably just gone out for coffee,” Harry says, glancing at the clock on the bedside table for the first time. 4:37 am.
The single white eye blinks and this world bleeds into the next and the next. Everything smudges into shaking fists pounding Harry’s body, a firm hand on his chin, smoke and the soft brush of lips.
Silence.
Harry had hovered, a spectre at the back of the room, silent as his horrific magic was set to rights.
“If you didn’t have hangover potion, you’d understand why no one else drinks those awful things,” Hermione says.
“No,” Draco says, slowly, because who did this man think he was, telling Draco what to do? “I don’t think I will.”
He didn’t have a job or live at the manor. The troop of Slytherins he’d left behind were a united front of silence, each one ridiculously tight lipped and, allegedly, completely clueless.
“If you spoke at his trial, I think it would go a long way in swaying the Wizengamont.”
He didn’t know what to say. He knew there wasn’t anything that would made it better. Not now. “I’m so sorry.”
He headed back home, nearly speed-walking, to avoid any attention. Especially from journalists. When he arrived home he found another letter waiting for him and two more Daily Prophets, each covering updates in the case against Louis Luther.
Sorting began, Ravenclaw gained fifteen new members in a row, and they were going crazy. Seven students in and they started chanting “One more! One more! One more!” It was mad.
Harry whined but relented, turning on the radio and setting it to a station he liked.
Harry breathed in as Draco slid his fingers in. They made it halfway before they met resistance.
Everyone noticed, but no one as much as Draco. Draco stared at his boyfriend in amazement because he could tell that Harry truly didn’t care.
Draco noticed it too. He noticed those little comments and it struck him in the very core of his being. These confessions were something he would never forget. How could he? Here his lover was, presenting himself for his sins and yet he shows no guilt. In a strange way it was almost impressive.
The Auror almost looked embarrassed before confessing, “Technically, yes. But none of us really think it was you, and I don’t believe you’ll try to hurt me or escape, so no.”
“Harry, you slut! What have I done to you?!” Draco exclaimed, intentionally overdramatic. “You wank one time and now you’re addicted.” He huffed.
"I might let you, if you can convince me." He teased.
“It isn’t that. It’s Draco. He had to choose between marrying me or a stranger, he has to leave his home and his mother! Merlin, he’s probably so scared. I can’t believe this happened to us!”
“What is it?”
Draco chuckled at the familiar noises, but decided not to comment on it. “Relaxed?”
"I did warn that I wouldn't go easy on you." The blonde reminded as he picked up his fork and began to eat. He was so smug about it, but not annoyingly so. Only smug enough to make Harry a bit more flustered about the way he was responding to being flirted with. "I really can't believe you don't get hit on more often. You're gorgeous, did you know that?"
Draco smirked, “See, told you. He’s already realizing I’m better than you.”
They made it to the Ministry and stepped out. Everyone coming in through the Floos headed to a large hall where the ball was being held. The two followed the crowd and without thinking, Harry took a light hold of Draco’s wrist. The blonde raised an eyebrow at the contact, but chose to say nothing. He didn’t want to ruin the moment and make Harry pull away. He knew there was no ulterior motive or intention behind the contact other than preventing them from getting separated. It was a bit sweet, in it’s own way.
Pawk stood on as Greenwood took center-stage at Wizengamot's for the second time that month. He explained the legal side of the bill and that sparked some resistance. It was quickly quelled when the opposition realized just how unpopular their side was. It was mostly a matter of appearance. They didn't want word of their arguments breaking out and making them look bad. Harry thought it pathetic. Perhaps he wouldn't leave if Wizengamot had been run by more people who didn't think making discrimination a crime was a problem. But he'd already made his decision.
Colin rolled his eyes. “That is such a lie. You’re a horndog.” Finally, the shirt pushed down over his golden locks.
“Here!” Ruth handed it over with the utmost confidence that every lead and loose end would check out. “Everything Mr. Shacklebolt asked for in his email. Hey, I also have those forms he wanted me to print out and sign about being on TV…”
Draco pulled him off, tilting his head up to look him in the eye through lopsided glasses, giving him a wink before pulling him back onto his dick. Harry made his throat relax again and took the full length of it, sucking down as best he could.
“The Dursleys never really understood the gravity of the situation with Riddle until I phrased it plainly: all muggles made to serve or die, the battle deciding that coming up right now. Self-preservation took over. Needless to say I don’t talk to any of them much anymore,” Harry finished on his sad tales of abuse at Privet Drive. It was a downer, and he didn’t want to kill the mood.
“Then that’s his problem.”
Harry shook his head. “Something in the middle. A name that is interesting and singular enough to be unique, but nothing pretentious. Maybe… Aiden, or Matthew.”
“If anyone so much as teases them for that, I swear—“
Lucius wasn’t at all pleased with Draco’s choice of a mother, but that was admittedly reassuring. His granddaughter was all his. In writing.
While Harry had presumably taken the day off to yell at some Malfoys, it left Ron to stew alone on the case. It took him three full minutes to realize he was scratching his head in confusion with the tip of his quill.
Harry looked up with raw, red eyes to see Draco’s were the same. Harry reached up with the hand that wasn’t pressed to Draco’s precious heart, catching a tear on his thumb. “I can feel it,” Harry murmured, voice unsteady as his shuddery breathing began to subside.
“Draco!” he laughed.
Draco snickered and started on Harry’s trousers next, finding him similarly disposed. “Cheeky,” he accused, sliding them down and off his legs. He gave Harry’s arse cheek a clap through his red panties because he could, getting a satisfying squeak out of him. “Now take off my pants and open me up already.”
The air smelled of fresh roses and oils Harry couldn’t quite identify, this place was as imperial as it promised to be. There was a sharply-dressed attendant behind a marble counter with the name of the spa carved in gold. Pillars around the room went with the theme of looking like some kind of royal palace with ethereal, charmed fabric floating between the stone columns.
“…we do not like this in the slightest!” an older man said. Grace figured it was Lucius. “And your other candidate isn’t much better! Some drop-out who got pregnant while drunk? How do you know she won’t drink with your child in her?”
“Then you don’t have to, I’ll explain to you both later. But Ron, I really, really need you to leave.” With his free hand Harry searched for thick hair on his head and pulled it out to some relief.
“How could someone so snooty be so goddamn gross—“
Even with all that being said and done, Draco still had some pent-up anger to take out on some unsuspecting member of the opposite faction.
“What did his ad say?” asked Blaise.
“What?”
“Draco, can I tell you something? And you can’t—you can’t say I’m just saying it because we’re drinking,” Harry insisted.
“Back!” Narcissa announced in an uncouth way that would make her pureblood mother roll over in her grave. In one hand, she held a plate with two massive biscuits on top. “Here, Anne. Have a biscuit.”
He forgot things like that a lot. He’d roll his eyes when someone said they weren’t going to college because of money reasons without thinking that there really was no funding for them. Draco laughed at people whose credit cards got declined in stores he was shopping at. He was, essentially, a rich bitch.
Draco gave Harry a kiss and closed the door behind him.
“Just reminding you that you’re outside,” Narcissa said airily. In one hand, she perked a pink flower up with just a touch. “Where there are no walls, ceilings, silencing charms…”
Harry was driven mad beyond words, green eyes looking up pleadingly at Draco’s.
“Are you—“ Harry was going to ask if Draco was expecting anyone when he saw a flash out of the corner of his eye in the window. It was enough to be a shadow, a phantasm of black and a sort of blue in the large, empty front yard.
The second he started walking towards the table Ruth started shaking her head. “No, no, no. That can’t be him. Turn around, please turn around. Please, let him be going somewhere else but here.”
“You--! Fuck you,” Harry said and bit back a laugh of his own. “You had me worried.”
Draco grabbed Harry’s jaw and planted a kiss on his lips. Harry probably should have expected it, but he was too often too naïve. But if that really was what Draco needed from him…
Harry was so tempted to look at his phone that his hands actually itched for it. No, no, he had to let this play out naturally. Why had Draco been so kind and gotten his expectations so high? That was never good. He sipped more tea but couldn’t sit back. “Thank you for showing me this place, really. And this suit—I mean, I don’t think I’ve ever looked better and you have to know how rare it is for me to compliment myself like that.”
“I saw you dancing tonight and I couldn’t get enough.” Draco loved weaving stories. “Shaking your whore arse around and flirting with every man with a pulse. I took it upon myself to bring you here to show you what a real man is like, and to show you what happens to boys who act naughtily.”
“I think you’ll find a way,” Hermione said. “Make an honest man out of Harry, would you?”
This time around, Ron went even further with suggestions of turning to Remus for help. Harry would hear none of it.
Harry shivered with excitement. Not all days, but maybe one day he’d like that. “I wouldn’t
“In here, Liv,” Sirius called eagerly, lighting up immediately that his daughter-thing and his soulmate-thing were in the same room at the same time. Padfoot was an easily-pleased man.
“Um,” Harry made like he was about to start some big, heartfelt speech. “I—“
“Aw.” That was cute.
Harry put his pen down for a moment, sure that Draco wouldn’t check up on his progress since the esters were done. If anything, Harry was glad they wouldn’t have to meet up over the weekend. A Friday afternoon was all Harry could take of him.
“I don’t hear you denying it.”
Time would only tell what their ratings and viewership would be, though. Draco and Harry had agreed that they didn’t really care about that, and that the finished product of their weird adventure was reward enough, but both hoped for a renewal of the show without getting their hopes up too high.
Colin’s next smile was all teeth before he crushed their lips together. “Yes. Yes, of course.”
Harry ran into the interrogation room to furiously cast some cleaning spells while Draco made dinner plans for the following evening with Lucius and Narcissa.
“Good, good…” Draco kissed the back of Harry’s neck. “Such a good boy.”
“It’s not so bad,” Charlie shrugged, answering the question that Lucius had never asked. “We only have to do it once a month.”
Harry grabbed the opportunity for all it was worth. He leaned across the metal table that Marcus was chained to so he was close enough to intimidate.
A warm glow came over Harry and it was hardly the water’s fault. “Here I am,” Harry confirmed. “All yours.”
It was safe to say that Theo’s taste in friends and in boyfriends was vastly different; no matter how many times Draco accused him of having a thing for blondes.
Before Sirius could berate his cousin-in-law for being a priss, Remus stepped in.
He reached behind the couch cushion to grab the bottle of lubricant they’d stuck there from the last time they’d shagged in the living room. Soon, their new home would become like their old flat: littered with stray sex toys, lost and half-empty bottles of massage oil, and enough lubricant to coat all of London in a goopy mess of flavors and sensations.
Draco turned to Harry and searched his features, smiling. “I think that will impress my friends even more than your identity. I haven’t had anything serious in years, and I was beginning to wonder if I’d become allergic to it.” Draco pretended to sneeze just to be an arse.
“He can,” Draco defended. “But we wanted to move in together.”
“Where is it to be held?” Draco asked conversationally.
,” announced one child who was laying on the ground ripping up grass.
They told her ‘do whatever you want’, and most likely meant it, but she was still wary. Olivia cleaned up after her every move, just in case. She’d even pretended to like Sirius’ goopy casserole that his own husband had turned down.
doing?” Draco countered, unable to help himself in the heat of their bickering. His need to be right and get the last word was overpowering.
By mistake, Grace had made a person.
“I’m not going to be my mother and forbid them from seeing one another. He’s an alright kid, they have adult supervision, and he’s tiny enough for me to hit.”
“Somewhere. We’d find a place for you somewhere,” Draco finished. “Now, about prenatal regiments…”
Draco closed the door almost all the way, leaving a crack. The magical nightlight on the dresser he’d purchased on a whim a few years ago would do Harry well if he wanted it, and Harry had been shown how to use it to project different shapes and colors.
“Do you really want to know?” Theo asked. “This involves the underground secret society.”
“Bah, ‘Mione’s beast, rest her fuzzy soul, was just a half-Kneazle. You’d have more trouble dealing with a grown Crup on a mission I’d say,” Hagrid responded, measured but clearly a bit disappointed he’d been outvoted by an interloper Slytherin.
Draco wanted this more than he cared to admit. He wanted to be there for someone, and to provide for them, and help them achieve whatever dreams they had, too. Being a Daddy obviously involved a sexual component he enjoyed to no end, but beyond having some blokes call him by that title while getting spanked he’d never really, actually
“That was seven years ago,” Remus reminded Narcissa.
xxxxXXXXxxxx
Draco was about to finish himself off when Harry found the strength to roll them both over so he was on top. “Wait,” he rasped, glasses askew and hair a complete mess.
“Don’t you dare,” Harry responded. “I need you.”
“Sure.”
“You’re at war with the truth,” Hermione decided with a chuckle. She could have sworn her baby agreed with her in her little mumbles and giggles.
As if summoned by praise, Pansy appeared next to Ginny and not even Harry’s poor sight could make him miss the bright pink and sheer bodysuit and lingerie she had on. In her hand was… two whips? Wait, no, they were leashes.
Draco and Harry shook her hand before entering the home. It made sense to have a roommate not only for the extra cash but for company. Draco never had a sibling so he imagined what fun it would be to live with someone like Pansy all the time—though there would be ups and downs—and Harry knew what it was like to live with Dudley so he shied from the idea.
Draco held a stoic, unaffected face to all this. More than once he could feel Potter glancing over at him like he wanted to say something, but nothing was said.
“Who knows?” Harry shrugged. “Maybe you’ll be in the same adoption boat as me one day. With less judgment and more understanding in-laws, of course.”
So finally Lucius deigned to look at Harry Potter. It was as if arithmancy maths were flying around Lucius’ head trying to calculate just why Draco had to have chosen
Draco had no idea what to do with his hands or his body as if it all suddenly wasn’t his own. He was in a stranger’s skin and he had no idea how to operate this odd new vehicle.
Draco rolled his eyes. “You wish you could mess with me.”
Draco grinned. “So considerate.” He wished Sirius would do the repairs with magic, but once Sirius Lupin had an idea, it was damn near impossible to change his mind.
“Thank you.”
Harry knew he would be on board with that. When he saw his little baby gurgle in his arms and reach up for Papa, there would be no holding back on Harry’s lavish and unending attention. “I guess you’re right.”
“You don’t get to ask that question!” Harry flipped. He let out a horrible growl, finally putting away his wand only when he saw Draco standing and safe. “What the fuck is wrong with you, Ron? Have you lost your mind? Do you even have a warrant?”
Head Boy Arnold Falmer took up the rear of the group and the red-cloaked wizards made their way up the ever-shifting stairs.
“Ah, the adoring fans,” Theo snarked. Being known as the son of a murderous psychopath had its perks.
Theo nodded. “She seemed nice.”
“…Very well,” Lucius sighed. “You may capture this ‘video’ and we will view it.”
“I’m meeting your parents?” It sounded strange to say out loud since they had met many times before and had consistently sour encounters. Harry went on anyway.
“Since, uh, you’re clearly the woman in the relationship—“
After that, Harry was putty in Draco’s hands. Draco busied himself with unbuttoning every last facet of that bothersome uniform Harry had on before lifting his undershirt off over his head. Harry’s glasses got snagged in the process, but Draco centered them again. “Want you to see this,” he told him throatily.
With an encouraging mewl, Harry nudged their hips together. This was going much better than he could have imagined when he had fretted over introducing his cousin to his husband. At least the next time (if there was a next time, Harry wasn’t really sure he even wanted Dudley around no matter how sorry he was) the boundaries would be clearer.
"He..." Harry realized in comparison to all the things Alvaro had mentioned that this would sound utterly lame. "He was mean to me in high school. And to my friends. He was mean to me and my friends."
“Shut up. You don’t know anything about Sirius, or Regulus, or even Remus for that matter,” he barreled on. “And this isn’t about them.”
At least she commanded the attention of the students. “I shall place the Sorting Hat on your head, and you shall be sorted into your houses,” Sinistra announced. “Erica Adams.”
“I think I remember some cleaning spells from Hogwarts,” Narcissa tried, nudging Lucius to encourage him.
“I want to help the Slytherins,” Harry went on, beginning to get fired up like he always did for the kids under his care. “I was almost sorted into Slytherin, did I ever tell you that? I begged the hat not to.”
“Oh, I’m sorry, I couldn’t hear that,” Draco lied, working his finger in and out so he could always end up against that same bundle of nerves. “You’ll have to speak up, dearie. Daddy wants to know every thought in that pretty head of yours.”
There was a click on the other end signaling someone had answered the phone.
Harry’s other hand kept him anchored on the counter, his back arching upwards. “Draco,” he gasped. He tried to line up his strokes with his thrusts.
“Shut up,” said Draco. He opened his eyes for a moment to squint them and saw something in the distance. “Shit.” He pressed the ‘record’ button on his camera and motioned to the crew on top of the sand dunes to their left. “I think this is it.”
Fire burned in her eyes. “I am not an animal, Draco,” she growled.
Pansy gave him a quick kiss on the cheek. “Take care of my Dray-Dray,” she told him with such a serious tone and a drunken intonation that Harry immediately laughed away any doubt as to their sincerity.
“Harry, when have you ever cared about my being okay with something?” Lucius asked, cutting the bullshit. Draco’s marriage to the Gryffindor had allowed Lucius to see Harry as a nonthreatening entity, allowing him to both assimilate Harry into the family and lower his protective walls, but boundaries had to exist.
“You’re horrible. See, this is why you don’t know anything in this class—spending the whole time feeling me up.”
“I swear to god, I swear if you’re lying right now—“ Kennedy started, finger pointed at Brooke accusingly.
Maybe it was the exhaustion, maybe it was the emotional stress about someone else’s online relationship, maybe it was general unfurling of Harry’s senses, but he laughed without any real malice towards Draco. It was strange, they had been arguing just hours ago and there Harry was, laughing with him.
That only confused Fred more, in all honesty. “But they got married, and when you get married, you get pregnant with babies. I don’t get it.”
Donning his immaculate white robes Draco left a sleepy Harry in bed for the apparation trip to the Hospital, arriving in the foyer as several other witches and wizards did.
“It’s a pity. He’s a looker.” Draco continued to walk, which confused Harry enough to follow him.
“Perfect! You’ll love mother, she always fawns over Pansy when she stays over. I think she would have preferred a daughter,” Draco grinned, looking plainly evil in his sharp clothes and clearly malicious aura. It radiated off of him like people said pregnant women radiated beauty.
to be rewarded.
“Harsh,” Harry snorted. Given a task Draco was really animated, now, speaking with his hands and giving every emotion away on his face. Yes, this was the Draco Malfoy he’d seen recounting grandiose stories at the Slytherin table in their early years, indicating the size and ferocity of the creatures he described with great pomp.
Sirius quickly responded with a ‘YOU ARE A BIGGER PONCE THAN REMUS AND I COULD EVER BE’ in his signature black ink. Peter had circled it with his pencil for emphasis. He always used to side with Sirius in fake spats because he liked to see James all flustered.
Ron used his wand to snip away at the blood red flowers blocking their path. They had some bugs on them that were about the size of Ron’s hand, and he really didn’t want to fuck with them. “As I expected,” Ron chuckled. “Hey, are these begonias?”
“Says the bloke whose main character on World of Warcraft is only one letter away from ‘orgasm’.” Draco rested his back confidently against the building they’d happened upon. It was some closed Real Estate place with brick walls that were cold to the touch even with Draco’s many layers of clothes on. “And for your information, I think about many things aside from sex.”
Anyone else would have thought that Draco had just misspoken. But Harry knew. He knew the word choice was entirely intentional.
Draco raised an eyebrow, “Embarrassed, Potter? I know with your fame and status, you think yourself too refined to have such carnal desires. But if I remember correctly, I didn’t even have my hands on you five minutes and you were a horny wreck.”
“Fine.” He wrapped his hand around Harry, making the boy’s jaw drop.
She set a hand on his shoulder and smiled at him. Her eyes sparkling with pride for what he’s done. “I know you won’t. I know you’ll do good things. I’m so proud of you, Draco. Before you leave at the end of the year, stop by the hospital wing. I have a book I’ve been writing. It’s all my medical knowledge in one mostly organized journal. I want you to have it. You’ll need to study it if you want to run the hospital wing one day.”
The blonde pulled him through the shack and into the small bedroom. With a gentle shove, Harry found himself falling onto his own bed, everything below his knees dangling off the side.
"Oh I wish I had done that. I ended up pouncing on Dean at first chance." Seamus confessed with a laugh. "But he enjoyed himself and I wouldn't change anything."
And so it was settled.
Harry took care of the other vegetables and heated up a pan with olive oil. When it was time, he had Draco stir while he added the vegetables and herbs. He then boiled water for the noodles while Draco silently tended to the sauce.
They hugged and parted ways. Draco thanked McGonagall for giving him the chance to talk to his mother, but it was obvious his head was clouded over by bad news.
Harry nodded coyly.
“That ..... That is an excellent point.”
“Because I’m a slut, remember?”
“I might be a ghost.”
Harry took the silence as a sigh to take it further. “Then I’ll occupy my hands some other way.” He commented as his hand drifted up to toy with the blonde’s nipple.
He sent off a letter, practically begging Blaise to let him come over in a few days, and hoped for the best.
“I wonder how they’ll feel about you taking care of them every time they do something stupid and get hurt.”
Draco couldn't take it anymore. He stood up from his seat and he called out. “What's this about? Is it because I wasn't a good Death Eater, because mum lied to Voldemort to make sure I was okay, because Harry ended the war?! What did we do to make you so furious that you would go off and do something like this?”
- - - - -
Harry couldn’t believe this. He looked at Draco with a baffled expression. “You too?”
He stripped himself and stood in the mirror, examining his body. He already knew that no amount of worry about stop him from sleeping with Draco, but he still found himself nervous.
“I’m inclined to agree.” Lucius concluded with a nod.
“Are you okay?” Harry spoke in a small voice. Slamming doors, anger, and balled fists. He didn’t want to be scared, but he was. Of course he was confident he could take Draco in a fight, it wasn’t about that. He hated how he felt, but he knew he couldn’t do much to stop it.
Draco opened his eyes and gave Harry a lazy glare. “Unfortunately, you would be dumb enough to do it. So I can’t take any chances.” The blonde sat up and then sighed, still tired. “Come on then. Put your clothes on.” He went to the bathroom to freshen up.
Harry somehow felt guilty, wishing he was smaller and easier for Draco. “Sorry.” He whispered. That was all he could do to hold back the satisfaction in his voice. The warm and wet grip around him made him want to call out and writhe, but he didn’t. He only wanted to show his love for Draco. Though he tried to stay strong and solid, he couldn’t stop the trembling in his thighs.
Harry’s cheeks went dark red and he looked away. “U-Uh, we’re going to be late. We ought to get going.”
They slowly got up and got ready for the day.
Draco nodded at Pomfrey and then approached Neville. “What the hell did that bloody idiot do this time?”
He wanted to feel bad. He wanted to feel remorse, he yearned for any semblance of regret, he needed to know the ache of contrition, but he didn’t. He didn’t feel good about it, but he didn’t feel bad either. It was as meaningful to him as stepping on a flower. You don’t think about it, you don’t notice it, the damage is done, and it makes no difference to you. Killing Voldemort meant absolutely nothing to him. There was neither qualm nor glory. Just another thoughtless action. That was all.
“Because you’ve been a little shit since you were a babe.” Narcissa answered, “But Harry, Harry’s an angel.”
Slytherins are known for being sly, cunning, ambitious, and charming. It's really the ambition that gets students sorted into Slytherin. Their ambition truly is something else. It's strong and unrelenting, so much so that they develop a sly and cunning nature in order to get what they want. Sometimes what they want is power, other times it's world peace. Slytherin aren't bad, just willing to do whatever it takes to get what they want, regardless of consequences or repercussions. The charm of Slytherin comes with their sly and cunning nature. They learn that charming others is just as good as manipulating them.
With his mother, he felt like he had that again. They were off eating at nice restaurants all day and shopping around. It was wonderful and relaxing. Draco indulged himself in charmeuse, suede, silk, chiffon, lace, and satin. He had an obvious preference for sheer and light fabrics, but he’ll always have a weak spot for suede. He looked like an elf prince from a fantasy movie, but he didn’t know that.
“Can’t tell him if you’re dead.” Harry threw back.
Draco rolled his eyes and planted a kiss on Harry’s cheek, giving him a surprised expression and red cheeks. He chuckled and took a seat on the sofa. “I’m putting that in my book.”
Draco slowly caught his breath and softly asked, “D-Did you, did you swallow that?”
A grin spread across Lucius' face, as if he had been hoping someone would point that out. "Actually, I looked into your family lineage and you'll never believe what I discovered. Your family are the descendants of Linfred of Stinchcombe, whose nickname was 'the Potterer'. His eldest son was the first recorded Potter, Hardin Potter. Your line continues to marry other witches and wizards, with the occasional muggle, but no significant number. Your great-grandfather, Henry Potter, was quite outspoken on behalf of muggles. That and your muggle-sounding surname are the only reasons your family was excluded from the Sacred Twenty-Eight." He let out a soft chuckle as if he had won a game of chess. "Even your mother's unfortunate blood-status can be overlooked. You're practically pureblood, Harry."
“Lay down with me.”
The boy behind him froze and nearly choked on his own breath. “P-Pardon?”
“I never had birthday or Christmas presents. For the longest time I didn’t know when my birthday was. I kept track of my age depending on what year I was in at school." He paused as his brain finally found a more specific topic to latch on to. "I hated school. I didn’t have friends because my cousin bullied everyone into staying away from me. I was isolated for my first eleven years of life. All I had was the Dursley’s. They belittled me, humiliated me, and any attempt at trying to be good was ignored.” He didn't even notice the way his hand slowed and the jabbing gradually stopped. Harry found himself making a bit of a connection which he revealed after a deep breath. “I suppose that’s why I always seem confused when you flirt with me. I guess I’m not used to someone wanting me and I don’t know what to do. I used to confuse kindness for sarcasm and wait for someone to laugh at me, but they never did. Even when I made friends in Hogwarts, I was underdeveloped. I spent years trying to catch up. There were so many things I didn’t get; jokes, social cues, double meanings. I never understood. Sometimes there are still things I'll miss. I think that’s why others think I’m sassy. I’m not really. I’m just direct.“
Harry removed Draco’s underwear, and discarded it on the floor just to be a dick. He could see Draco biting back a complaint.
Harry looked up and seemed utterly floored. He didn't expect Draco to speak, let alone say something as profound as that. Of course, Draco didn't say that he liked being there, only that he liked the place, which Harry made sure to pick up on. “You do?”
Remus beamed. His lower lip trembled and he had never felt so happy in his life. He didn’t know Teddy would shift to match his hair and eye color. He felt like even though Teddy didn’t know him, Teddy somehow loved him in his own way.
“Harry, I’m so sorry. I wish I could’ve done more.” Molly said as she wrapped her arms around the boy.
It’s one of the things that no one talks about, no one questions, but everyone is thankful.
While Harry went on about his excitement, Greenwood couldn't tell if he was about to throw up or jump for joy. Either way, something overpowering was bubbling up inside of him. He felt as if he had finally been freed from his cycle but he could also tell that this was all leading up to Harry calling in one last favored. His only fear was that this would be the biggest favor yet.
“I’m going to pretend I don’t hear you.” He was willing to humor the conversation earlier, but honestly he had no real evidence to prove what his role in sex would be, so he figured it was better to deflect the conversation than admit he had no argument.
He pulled out the next as Harry finished cutting up the fruit. “This one is about two friends in the Ministry who uncover a scandal about the Minister for Magic, and they have to very carefully foil all her plots without giving away that it’s them and that they know she’s evil. It’s so cute, I think it’s suppose to be like a comedy. It’s called A Scandal in Bavaria, which is where the story takes place.”
Harry let out a laugh at the brash comment. It certainly explained Sirius. Not to say he was a slut, but he was.
Sure enough, the woman had an unpleasant look on her face and she was slowly turning her head and wrists, as if slowly struggling against something.
“I’m used to lots of balls, being drunk nearly every night in December, and lots of food. But I don’t expect any of that this year. I’m used to a big Christmas tree with lots of decorations and a nice skirt, poinsettias, mistletoe, garland, holiday lights, playing Christmas music all day, gingerbread houses, Christmas biscuits, opening a single present on Christmas Eve, hot chocolate in the morning, and Christmas crackers.”
“It was great! I spent the afternoon with Hagrid. He spends a surprising amount of time looking around the black market for rare animals. He often buys them so he can save them and give them better homes. Today, he got himself a Hippogriff. I got to name her! Her name is Blue and I love her. I gave her a bath, I fed her, she loves me, we wrestled, and then I helped Hagrid take her to his friend’s place in Ireland where she’ll live on this big ranch. It was so cool!”
“Really? Never? Your relationships must have been boring.” Draco teased with a small smirk.
Harry glanced at the time and rolled his eyes, flopping back down on the bed. “It’s six in the morning.”
Harry looked up, “What?”
“We’ll have to figure that out together. Come on.” Draco found a piece of parchment and one of Harry’s pens that wrote like a quill. He sat down at the table. “We ought to start from the beginning, withe the wine.”
There was the distant sound of cameras flashing, but it all felt so far away. The only thing they were aware of beyond the way they were flooded by the presence of the other was the music that swirled around the room and came to envelop them in an intimate atmosphere. There were no eggshells to walk on or boundaries to mind. Nothing mattered anymore and their previous arrangement was forgotten.
After their classes, Hermione approached Draco with a large bag full of candies. “Here you go, all Harry’s favorites.”
Harry handed over the scroll. "Luther, the man I had you build up, it's time to take him down. I have evidence linking him to three acts of magical violence against Muggles but he was never investigated or convicted, because the crimes were committed Voldemort-era."
Harry's cheeks went pink and he cracked a nervous smile. "Oh, yes, it's good."
Draco reported his findings to the group that night and there was no doubt that Dean and Seamus were still completely infatuated with each other, even after four years of nothing.
“I don’t mind at all.” He assured, setting the book down by Harry.
“My excuse was that he was going to use physical violence of his own will, when he was technically only allowed to use magic against students that teachers sent him to.” Draco explained, “Haven’t spoken to him since, good riddance.” There was a nuance of superiority to his words, as if the roles had changed and it was now Goyle who was below him, which is exactly what had happened. Draco saw Goyle as absolutely nothing, below dirt. He'd always known Goyle wasn't the best person, but now he knows how bad he really is.
She hated that. She hated everything about it. But she knew how important this was to him and she went with it.
Harry awkwardly stepped forward when he saw the luggage that Pansy and Draco held. “The uhm, the master bedroom is this way,” He began to walk towards the hall, “you can set your suitcases down and unpack in there.”
Harry took a deep breath. In that moment, he made a decision. He might be married, perhaps his love life would have to be non-existent, but he still had so many other things he could do with himself. Maybe he didn't lose his fire, but rather, he lost the war that once fueled it. Now, he had other, better things to live for. He didn't quite know who he was, but he decided that was okay. He had the rest of his life to figure it out, and that's what he decided he would do.
“You were abused?” Neville asked. That part was the only part that really stuck out to him. Harry being abused was certainly news to him. He never would have suspected it, but perhaps, that was the point. If Harry was being abused bad enough to be scared for his life, then it only makes sense that Harry wouldn’t make his situation known.
Hannah looked at him suspiciously, still unsure about him. Of course, she knew he came through in the end, but she still wasn't sure about him. He was a Slytherin after all. “Why would you help us out? Out of the kindness of your heart?”
“I bet I’ll become your favorite patient.”
It was then that Harry remembered he’s a virgin. His jaw dropped. “You did that on purpose. You sly bastard.” He was more impressed by Draco’s plan than anything.
For the second time in a row, Harry went to the bathroom after leaving Greenwood's office. But instead of having a breakdown, he only washed his hands and left.
Draco was regularly studying plants with Neville and brewing potions for the hospital wing. This also caused him to get close to Professor’s Sprout and Slughorn. Madam Pomfrey let him handle minor illnesses all by himself, everything from diagnosis to caring for the patients. He spent his weekends running around the hospital wing, assisting Pomfrey and caring for patients. Word got around that Draco was helping out in there and suddenly everyone was referring to him as “Nurse Malfoy”. He didn’t mind it, he actually seemed to like it. Pomfrey had also started throwing out comments about how she was getting old, though she was only in her mid-sixties, and that she needed someone she could trust to take over when she’s gone. She made these comments to both Draco and McGonagall.
He handed over the bag of candy and Harry dug in.
He ended up scrambling to sit against the wall, turned to the side so he didn’t have to face anyone. He panted for air and felt his heart thub in his ears. His chest ached and he felt like he was choking. He felt himself sweating as tears fell from his eyes. He hated being like this, especially in front of others. He tried to calm himself down, but the moment he stopped panting, a pained whine slipped from his throat. He shivered and stared at the ground, feeling just as helpless as he did when he walked out into the woods to die.
“I’m related to him.” Draco decides to mentioned to, he thought it was a bit interesting.
He spent the morning worrying to Harry, expressing his concerns and anxieties. Harry succeeded in convincing Draco that he would be alright no matter what happened.
His hips began to shift and his back softly arched. He whined and decided that the feeling rushing through his body was much more important to him than his pride. He let his hips sink down onto Draco, before pulling back. He moved in time to the thrusts and found himself taking Draco in even faster than before. He let out a loud moan and his jaw dropped. “More, I want more!”
Harry couldn't not answer the question. As much as he wanted to just leave it alone, he had to tell the truth. But the truth isn't what anyone wanted to hear. They all wanted this trial to be clean and quick. Those who blamed him were now aware that he wasn't at fault, and wanted to leave. Those who knew he was innocent felt that they had wasted enough of their time. But it was only going to get more convoluted from there because he knew that no matter what he did, so long as he was dealing with Wizengamot, he would get fucked. They fucked Sirius, they fucked him when he fought off a Dementor, and now they were fucking him all over again. It was yet another reminder that Harry needed to keep his optimism in check. Really he ought to be more optimistic, but he only saw the ways his optimism failed him. He saw this as a chance to change society for the better, but look at where he is now.
Harry tries to banish the memory, shudders as a fresh wave of guilt rises like bile. “Uh—Okay. Something else.”
The universes were bizarre and addictive, dazzling in their unpredictability and glistening in their variation. There were worlds where wings sprouted from his back on the full moon, where Draco transformed the old Black home into a museum, where slow acting death curses flew in the air. And yet, as the threads of the multiverse wove the lines of fate into the fabric of his body, magic stitched to vein, Harry Potter was forever constant.
spending the best years of your life in wizard prison is a pretty big deal.”
“Well,” Draco says, brushing the dirt from his knees and massaging his throat. “This world is going to be interesting.”
“Because she’s an evil bitch,” Harry had grumbled.
The upward inflection marked this as a question, and Harry mouths a reply, but the words still won’t come.
The clerk’s eyes narrow. “I’m sorry to disturb your—” Harry looks at the pointy metal sticks and gulps.
“You’re mine,” Draco presses the confession into Harry with his tongue. He feels the moment when Harry gives himself up, body going soft.
—and that’s offensive, isn’t it?
In another world, Harry reaches out. In another universe, he makes words that stitch rather than tear.  Here, though, as Draco walks out of his life, Harry watches him go.
It’s a plea and a prayer that builds until Harry is begging and Draco is moving and their bodies stop fighting and surrender to a tandem that ruins them both.
“But I’ve lost him,” Harry says, forgetting where he is and that it is a stranger in front of him. “Draco might be gone forever and it’s my fault.”
“Bye then,” Harry huffs abruptly, because he can’t do this. He can’t. Harry turns to flee.
. The foregone conclusion barrels forward and it does not appear to give a fuck about Draco’s preferences.
,” he had said when Harry’s temper raged in Draco’s small office, and Draco’d been sure that this was how he died, burnt alive in a fit of Harry’s wild magic, it was so hot on his skin.
