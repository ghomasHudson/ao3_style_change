Harry would never give Draco the satisfaction of knowing just how much that thrilled him to hear those words. He couldn't let the blonde become too egotistical after-all. Instead, he just smiled mischievously to himself and pressed a kiss to his partner's chest and said; "Of course. Anything you say, love."
They stopped walking and Draco bent to his knees and called out Seeker's name. The soggy bundle of blonde hair pivoted and bounded towards them, long pink tongue lolling out of its mouth. When the dog pounced upon Draco, the blond man was forced onto his back into the damp sand, a yell of surprise piercing the air. Harry was too busy laughing to call of the dog who was more than happy to lick Draco's features with its hot, flat tongue. "S-Seeker!" Harry choked out between hysterics, "come on down boy, you know Draco doesn't like getting dirty."
Harry shrugged, his mouth twitching into a sly grin. "I figured you wouldn't remember."
That was all the persuasion that Draco needed.
He ran a hand through his wind-tussled hair and dragged them down his face, cupping them around his mouth and nose. He could feel the hot throb of tears itching to bead out onto his eyelashes. He inhaled deeply, the stench of disinfectant still lingering heavily on his palms. He would need to wash it off –soon, but not now. Right now his throat was craving the soothing burn of red wine. How he needed the intoxicating flavor to fill his empty stomach.
And for the first time in his life, he was grateful for it.
Draco didn't answer straight away. Instead he turned his head to the side so that he could watch Harry's profile glow softly in the dying light, the breeze tousling his hair. "I've known that you come here for a while," he admitted with an air of confidence that made the brunette's stomach jolt just a little. "But I thought I'd let you have your privacy for a little while."
Harry stuck his tongue out childishly, a full-blown grin painted on his blossom-pink mouth. He leaned sideways and nuzzled Draco's chest with his head, "I've missed listening to your heartbeat."
He just needed to get out.
"True," Draco snorted dryly.
Severus regarded him coolly, "After what happened in the lake, I have every right to do as I see fit to make sure you are no longer a harm to yourself or those around you. You are not well, Harry, but I believe you can be with some therapy, a strict regime and time away from work. You have been running yourself to the bone and I think you hit a wall."
He wanted to gasp out in shock as the cold water soaked through into his clothes and closed over his head, swallowing him down into the blinding grey-blue depths. The weight of his clothes made him sink lower, the bubbles fizzing and hissing in his ears like vicious snakes. It took a little while for his eyes to adjust and he silently cursed himself from leaving his wand stashed away in the drawer in his bedchamber. He looked around, using his arms to force himself lower, further from the air and sunlight overhead and closer towards the weeds wafting up from the lakebed. The weeds tangled around his ankles as he kicked his leaden legs through the water, fighting his way lower still until he saw something pale and shimmering in the filtered rays of sunlight that spliced through the murkiness.
He touched a hand up to his lips, tracing a line over them, his eyes glistening with a hot torrent of tears that he would not -could not shed. He could not let himself cry.
He loathed the feeling.
"I'm not going back there, Hermione. Not unless I have to."
Lucius chuckled dryly to himself, "On the contrary I found myself intrigued to meet you when he returned home in such a state. It seems he hung onto your every word and was quite interested." He turned to look down at Harry, "I pray to Merlin that you were not giving my son false hope, Mister Potter. If there is a way to cure my son or at the very least ease his discomfort, then I would be grateful in more ways than one. He is my only child after all."
"I love you," he gasped out as he felt Harry's fingers stroke over his tight balls. "Oh, Merlin!"
"Only about an hour," Harry stated calmly as he dotted the end of a sentence and then leaned back in his chair to observe Draco. "You're looking better already. Baths and cooling charms do often work wonders when it comes to bringing down a fever. I would normally use magic but I want your body to build up its natural defences for next time this happens." He placed his journal to one side and stood up to hook his arms underneath Draco's armpits and haul him upright against his pillows. "I've ordered some breakfast to be brought up for us. And then you are going to take some potions I brought you, alright?"
"Here you go, love," he smiled softly as he bent to lower the tray onto Harry's lap. Harry smiled up at him with a timid 'thanks'. Draco pressed a kiss to the cotton hat still adorning his lover's head, "do you want to watch a movie or plain old T.V.?"
"They can only be seen by people who've killed," Luna said shocking Harry. He knew that he'd killed, but Harry never guessed she could have done that.
So here Harry was, standing on an almost deserted railway station not knowing what he was supposed to do. Harry heard the opening of the dinner's door. "Hello. What yah doooing?" A waitress asked him. A hint of mischief in her eyes.
He was avoiding Potter so much now that it was impossible for him not to notice. He just couldn't stand watching the man he so deeply loved, ignoring him, being flirted too, talking with other people…
Harry swallowed down the lump in his throat. Feeling awfully uncomfortable as sweat came pouring out of him. He felt
When everyone was out of the way Ron swang his wand yelling; "Stupefy!" Hermione though had already moved before Ron uttered the spell and had already taken Rons' hand, turning it so that the end of the wand was pointing towards Ron. He looked wide-eyed and shrieked as he was blown backward.
"I- uhm don't know how to answer that," Harry said, feeling his shoulders tensing up. He really wanted to have a change of subject,
But he was, and it was a ridiculous amount of distraction. Ugh, he could still hear himself in front of the mirror, fussing about how everything needed to be perfect. That he needed to look good for Harry. Picking up and throwing away thousands of clothes of all shapes and sizes; robes, shirts, trousers, jeans, ties, blouses, wristwatches, shoes, vests, sweaters, u-necks, v-necks, buttons, no-buttons, pockets, no-pockets, tight, loose, black, blue, green white, grey, etcetera. In the end, Draco had found himself knees deep in his wardrobe. He'd clapped his hands in a thank you when he'd finally found the foolproof pairs. He'd decided on a well-polished look. Wearing a grey sweater vest with a white blouse underneath, a pair of dark slim fit trousers accompanied by a green belt and his custom-made leather shoes. He'd settled against a green tie and his great-great grandfather's silver watch, he didn't want to come through as formal, and the tie would probably come off as his house colors and all that shit. Besides, he was sure that he wouldn't be able to stop fidgetting with one of them during the date, he knew he beforehand that he would keep checking the time with all of the nerves going through his body and he didn't want to seem like he wasn't enjoying their time together.
"Oh, you'll just need to sort that out together," Slughorn said while walking away.
"Oh sure. His brother Charlie helped bring him over from Romania. Didn't Ron tell you that?"
"On if you want to go on a date with me,"
"Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a curse when I see one. I've read all about them. You have to keep eye contact. And Snape wasn't blinking." Hermione said.
Potter bowed his head again, before moving to stand up. "Okay, I understand," Potter said dejectedly. And Draco noticed something he hadn't noticed before, and before he could take control of his mouth he blubbered out.
"WHAT! I heard you the first time!" Draco yelled as he turned to look at the slightly irritated brown-haired girl. Hermione gave an exasperated sigh before shaking her head in fondness.
"Ouch!" Harry heard as someone stumbled through the dorm. He lifted his head to the sudden noise with a look of confusion. Staring at the clock beside his bed he frowned. Dinner had just started and knowing his roommates, none of them would skip on pizza night.
"Mnn Ron~" Hermione moaned, sniffing the neck of Ron's green shirt desperately. It had been three days into heat, three days of scenting and wearing the shirt she had sneaked out of the boys' dorm after she'd deduced the symptoms of an upcoming heat.
"No! It's there, so I'm going to find it!"
The rest of the night they proceeded to ask each other questions like that, after some they would go on and started telling about it in more detail, or start laughing, or go into detail than start laughing at that. Sometimes they got surprised at some of the answers, and sometimes they would rub it in each other's faces. All-in-all Draco found himself really enjoying it, finding Harry's answers and great gestures very amusing. He found himself getting closer and closer to Harry…not only mentally but psychically wise too…quite literally, he was almost sitting in the vampire's lap.
Harry could almost see the anger that was steaming off of his two companions.
Then Albus put a letter on the blanket and said, "Good luck Harry Potter."
"I'll figure it out," Harry said, shrugging his shoulders.
She cleared her throat, "So, I think I owe you an apology,"
is turning him into a completely different person, and not making him happy at all. You know I heard he even helped a first-year to her dorm, despicable isn't it."
He started drumming his pensile impatiently on the desk, wanting to start this already he glared at his teacher for dragging out Draco's precious time. He looked around himself and saw that no one was giving the man any attention, some had even started with their potions already. Well, everyone except Hermione. Who was practically hanging on every syllable the man muttered out, writing down everything she ought to be important.
smell.
"You…you bloody- mother- what the hell is wrong with you! It's Malfoy for Christ's sake! And you waited this long to tell me! Probably would've waited a whole lot longer than that if I hadn't find out! You're seriously in a relationship, with
Blinking through his tears he watched as a bright and of glimmering white-gold was slipped onto his ring-finger and Draco's breath-taking smile. It was all so perfect. He sniffed through his on smile as Draco bent at the waist and drew his chin up and pressed their mouths together. Draco's hand brushed down Harry's tear-stained cheek as they broke their kiss. "I love you," Draco breathed as he kissed Harry's wet cheek.
Draco smiled to himself as he mounted the stairs with the small suitcase in his hand as he followed Cass up to the second floor. Harry had opted to stay on the small benched out front with Seeker, claiming he wanted to spend as much time in the sun as possible. Draco did not mind. It gave him time to sort the room out; when Cass left him at the door with the keys dangling in the lock and a bright grin, Draco sighed happily and walked into the room with both bags in hand. The decor was bold; white bed, sheets and pillow cases and walls and furniture; however the carpet, wall opposite the door, and the coverlet on the bed where the deepest shade of ruby red he could ever have imagined. He doubted that Gryffindor tower ever had this shade of red within it. He removed his wand from his sleeve and flicked it wordlessly; the suitcases unpacked themselves and he watched with a smile as their shoes aligned beneath the radiator, the shirts and trousers hung up in the wardrobe and the jumpers and underwear were folded and neatly placed in the three small drawers.
A shiver ran through him as Draco stirred and finally cracked his eyes open and frowned heavily as he focused on Harry in the wicker chair. "Harry?" he rasped, his voice slurred and thick from sleep, "Mmmm what time is it?"
The first incident had happened on the third of December about two weeks after Potter had blatantly stalked him to the Room of Requirement. He hadn't been sleeping too well in the last couple of days and his shower had been jinxed to spray him with a strange sort of liquid that made him stink of burnt fish to the point he hadn't washed properly in several days. He'd used charms and glamour's and an old bottle of his father's after-shave to conceal the obviousness of it, but he hadn't done too well a job, it would seem.
He didn't want to be around for Valentines Day though. He could only imagine how much rubbish Harry would get through the post from his numerous admirers.
Every available surface was decorated with candles -thick ones, thin ones, even some vanilla scented ones -bathing the room in a sultry, golden glow.
about time away with one another. He stabbed at his fruit and ripped it off his fork with his teeth. He didn't even look up at Harry sitting across from him. He couldn't. He was scared that if he did, his heart would stop in his chest and break. Harry was the one who spoke up in answer to Narcissa, "Unfortunately, I don't think I will be able to make it. August it an active time for children and there seems to be more crimes. I have a feeling that I'd be stuck in at the hospital all month."
Draco smirked as he held onto Harry's body. He sneered over at the nurse, "I suggest you go and fetch a wheelchair, it's protocol after-all for all departing patients." The nurse threw Draco the dirtiest look she could master before stalking off down the corridor. Draco turned back to Harry who had collapsed into one of the plastic chairs dotted around in the waiting area opposite the desk. A few people gave him sympathetic looks as how thin he was and the bald, shadow-less head. Draco walked over, offering similar smiles to the on-lookers, before easing himself down beside Harry, a hand running up and down his lover's cold, exposed back. "You shouldn't exert yourself, love. Energy is a precious gift for you at the moment."
Twisting his mouth in concentration he flicked his wand in the direction of their bedroom. "Accio pen and paper." A notepad and a muggle Biro came floating out of the bedroom. Replacing his wand with the Biro, as awkward as it felt in his fingers, he began doodling on the notepad, waiting for something remotely interesting -a way to start-to pop into his head.
They stood in silence for a little while before Draco spoke up, "Well there is something that might be able to help. If you're willing to help." He spoke low, and softly, his voice making Harry shiver with both relief and trepidation.
Blaise had been reading by the light of a 'Lumos' charm when Draco drifted into the dormitories. He had the largest, soppiest grin on his face that Blaise cringed a little when he saw it. He watched from his best as the blonde shucked out of his clothes and into pyjamas in a matter of seconds, before collapsing backwards onto his bed with a large, contented sigh. His hair was an utter mess. He looked thoroughly fucked.
Harry swallowed before nodding his head, "Of course ... I'll just use the port-key you gave me."
He tried to sleep without the oil but some days it became difficult. He used the prefect's bathroom a few other times in the space of ten days, a little excessive, but most times it was only the showers. In that time he had started feeling like he had a little more energy, a little more drive to go to classes and do the best he could.
Draco chose that moment to walk fully into the room, his hands reaching out to rest on Harry's thighs, the strong thighs that had now whittled away to almost nothing, except skin and bone. It felt like something out of a horror-movie to him, but he was more focused on the glistening tear-tracks running down Harry's pink flushed cheeks. It was a sad sight, seeing Harry cry. He rarely cried in front of him, and complained that it was a sign of his own weaknesses. Draco knew Harry had his faults. He would be lying if he said his lover was perfect, but then again neither was he. He still had the ugly scar on his left forearm that no amount of potions or spells could mask. He sat back on his hunches in front of Harry, his thumb stroking circles into the bony knee beneath his palm. "Harry?"
Cass merely smiled, "you're welcome. Make sure to stop by and say goodbye tomorrow before you leave."
Potter turned on his heel and led the way up to the fifth floor corridor and into an empty classroom. They spelled the door locked and cast silencing charms around to keep anyone from over-hearing. As soon as the charms were in place, Draco turned to Potter with a hungry look in his eyes and smirked at him, "Wanna make the Shrieking Shack really worthy of its name?"
Draco narrowed his eyes. "Well if it makes you feel any better, I'm not saying I hate it." A muscle twitched in Harry's jaw. "However, it is incredibly messy."
Harry smiled softly and then looked over into the fire without really seeing it, "I know what you mean. The tone of your letters was more open after that letter I sent to you. It was like you were opening up to me again. It made me feel so much happier for the first time in months."
Draco slowly eased Harry into his arms and cuddled him lightly, pressing his lips to the shell of Harry's ear, "I'll stay with you until you fall asleep, okay?"
"A couple of
With a glance over his shoulder, he gave a flick of his wand, and then closed the door behind him.
He blinked in surprised when a disheveled Draco -with a visible hickey on his neck -reached up to tug his bed hangings closed around him. Reaching down and under his bed he opened his potions textbooks to the page he needed. He never bothered with the introduction to potions, but this time, he took his time reading it over and over again until he could comprehend the printed words.
Harry shrugged, "it might do, but it'll also be less messy."
!" he rasped painfully, wincing as his tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth. He didn't believe his own words but he wasn't simply going to lie there and be insulted.
?" Severus spat out, making Draco flinch at the rage smothered in his voice. "It's no wonder either of you are looking as though you're suffering an illness. You both look like you haven't eaten or slept properly in weeks." He sighed and ground his teeth together, "I am not taking no for an answer from either of you two. A couple of weeks away are going to do you both a world of good. And at least I will be there to make sure that you are both eating and sleeping properly. Now, before tonight, I want you to write down a list of all of the things that you both haven't been doing in the last couple of months. I mean everything, even if it makes you feel guilty, like skipping out on your potions one evening just because you felt rebellious. I need you to do it for Harry as well because somehow I don't believe he would be honest with me right now."
"Dismally boring," Draco huffed, "But go ahead if you must. Just let me know when I have to have my stupid bath," the blonde groused as he folded his arms back over his chest.
"Well ... You know the resurrection stone?" Draco nodded. "Well -Dumbledore had it in his office. I found it in the snitch he left me in his last will and testament." Swallowing thickly, he forced his voice to work, "And it ... It showed me my parents. Brought them back for that brief moment. They said that they were so proud of me and that they loved me. They wouldn't leave me at all, even if the plan went ahead."
Draco waited a full thirty seconds before following.
have gotten it sooner. I'm going to stay with my parents and I don't know if I'll want to see you after the six months are up. I have a lot to think through and a lot to sort out. My things have already been sent for and that," he nodded his head towards an envelope in his bedside table, "is for you. You are not to open until you go home and are alone."
"Honestly? I'm not entirely sure. Whoever treated you before left some very indecipherable notes so I've opted to start from scratch. I hope you don't mind," he added in a cautious voice, his bright green eyes landing on Draco's face and the blonde man found himself shaking his head and swallowing thickly.
Harry felt a shiver run through him as he looked up at Draco with wide clear eyes for the first time all evening. He licked his lips nervously, not trusting himself to speak. It was very rare in their relationship, before and definitely after that summer, for Draco to relinquish any form of control in their love-making. So rare, Harry almost never anticipated it. And every time Draco asked for it, it made Harry's heart flutter anxiously in his chest. He swallowed thickly, "Are –are you sure, Draco?" his voice wavered awkwardly as he peered into the silvery grey eyes of his lover.
"Then why in Merlin's name have you stopped touching me?!" Draco hissed.
The sound that ripped out of his throat would have scared wolves into running away. He hollered out nothing but pure, raw anguish as he looked over the pier as the lifeless blonde man dripping water. His throat was rough and scratchy as he banged his head back over and over on the planks, kicking his legs and pummelling his fists over and over until he wasn't sure if it was water running out of his fists or blood. He felt hands patting at his back and trying to force the rest of the greasy water up but it didn't ease the agony he felt tearing his heart and soul apart as Narcissa screamed out from the grassy banks, her hands coming up to her mouth as she collapsed to her knees and sobbed, clutching onto the narrow wooden railing for support as Lucius tried to pull her back up to her feet to no avail. She didn't have the energy to push him away. He watched as though he had floated out of his own body and observing as Draco's pale, blue tinted body was lifted away from the sodden planks and levitated back to Severus' house so that they could take him to the nearest hospital.
.' He watched as the words danced and then vanished, before more words reappeared. '
Without another word Draco stood up from the bed and extended his pale hand to Harry, "Come over here." Harry wanted to object but instead slipped his hand into Draco's and felt himself gasp as a jolt that felt like lightning zipped up his arm and straight to the back of his skull. His eyes flickered open to drink Draco in for the first time in ages. He shuddered as Draco led him over to the bed, their eyes expressing more than their words ever could. Draco slipped in among the bed sheets and gently tugged Harry down beside him, nudged him over on his other side and draped the blankets back over them. Harry felt tense and awkward having spent so much time avoiding Draco's touch. He licked his lips and waited for the familiarity to creep back into their touch but it wasn't happening. He felt almost numb as Draco curled his arms around the younger man and rested his head back against the pillow. They lay that way for a while before Draco's soft voice murmured, "Just relax, Harry," his breath tickled at Harry's ear. It took a while but soon Harry felt the tug of sleep and he finally relaxed in Draco's arms, the nostalgic feelings giving way to a momentary contentment that felt so much like bliss, that he didn't realise he had slipped into his nightmare before it was too late.
," she stressed the word, "were whispering behind his back and charming his ink well to spray all over his work and his shirt! They even spelled 'HEX ME' to weave into the wool of his jumper! It won't come off! I tried countering it for him but he just told me to leave it alone and stalked out of the lesson early. Honestly, I thought after what had happened everyone would be a little more mature about this."
Hermione felt her tears prick with tears and her chest constrict sharply with the flurry of emotions within her. She rubbed a hand over her chest and gave the blond a small smile, though he was back to staring at the blank television screen. "That sounds lovely" she breathed before stepping into the floo and departing for The Burrow.
Blaise wanted his old friend back.
"I'm glad you're enjoying it," Draco beamed as Harry licked the last droplet of chocolate sauce off of his fork and sighed contently. Draco signaled for the waitress to bring their bill over so that they could pay and leave. The waitress came over and took the money Draco handed her -it was not so that he looked like a big-shot but it was because Draco had never gotten used to those muggle contraptions that Harry had called 'pin-machines' for 'credit cards'. Harry smiled, the same thought clearly running through his mind as the waitress printed them off a receipt and a copy of their bill, before flushing gratefully at the large tip that Draco handed over to her.
Harry felt his cheeks heat up as he read the words printed on the paper. His hands trembled a little as his mind turned the words over and constructed images to go along with them.
They kept the dinner conversation light, not veering onto anything too heavy like why this was the earliest Harry had been home in the last month. For his part, Draco couldn't risk himself looking too disheartened. He was relieved when Harry had promised him early that morning that he would be home at a reasonable time for dinner. More reasonable than it had been recently anyway. The food was good, thank goodness, because if Draco had unintentionally gave Harry food-poisoning after a long month of late shifts and running himself into the ground, he didn't think he could forgive himself. Draco didn't know what was bothering his lover –could he still call him that? –but whatever it was it was making the younger man look older than his thirty-two years. Draco already knew he was beginning to age with his receding hairline and weakening muscles but he still made an effort to take a stroll around central Paris with his mother and a few friends from his University days. He needed to keep himself occupied outside of his business with Harry, although, now even that was difficult now that he had to work in the shop day-in and day-out.
Draco wrapped his arm around Harry's shoulders, "well it's a little holiday, isn't it? One of us has to think of something to do each minute of the day."
Made it! Very proud of myself for this had a very busy week as well as weekend and almost didn't make it. I'm sorry but I wasn't able to write the next chapter but that will automatically be up next week!
"There isn't a creature or monster who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin," Ron whispered to Harry.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Do it again," Ron looked at her incredulously. Something she didn't have the time nor the patience for, the wondrous itch already starting to creep back up again and now that she had a taste of what the relief of it felt like, she wanted more. "It's good, really good. Please?"
"Alright since this is your first lesson we're starting easy. I want you all to climb until the middle of the wall. You'll all take turns." Hooch said. "Let's see who will go first. Ahh, why not, Harry Potter let's see how you'll do."
'Ooooh,' Harry thought while putting his hair up so Ron could see the scar.
. Hagrid told Harry.
He was kissing Harry Potter, the boy who lived, the chosen one, the boy he was completely and helplessly in love with. Hope started blooming in his chest, hope that had never existed there before.
"I didn't make the cut for the Slug Club. It's okay. He's got Belby handing out towels in the loo." Neville explained himself.
"Harry, Harry, Harry. There was work involved. I had to track these people down and ask them exactly how they managed to do what they did. No, it's not all book signings and publicity photos. You want fame, you have to be prepared for a long, hard slog." Lockhart said with an innocent tone.
Harry stayed there for a while, as he decided that the next time he saw Hermione he wasn't taking no for an answer.
Besides, when he tried it with Ron it tasted just as horrible as it did out of the bag. So what was the point? Only because Dumbledore said he probably liked it more that way he shouldn't try it on every person he met and see if they somehow tasted better. He shouldn't have tried it with Ron in the first place but at least he knew now.
The consequence of not following Harry's command was immediate, and Draco wailed out loud as he felt the heavy pressure against his balls.
'This whole scene is making me angry. Why can't he just leave the poor soul alone!' Harry thought.
Draco hadn't had the time to finish his thought before Potter said, "I think I can tell for myself, thanks." In a bitter tone.
"Christ Ron…"
"Ehm… no one." Draco answered, not comfortable with lying to his mother, who looked at him with a look that made Draco want to shrink in himself, the look that said, "
Draco walked from behind his teammates and looked over at Potter. Feeling quite smug that he made Harry's eyes bulge out as much as they were now.
The whole crowd cheered as the heavy doors opened. People scrambling forward as music and lights filled the corridor in a blue glow. Slowly the cluster drained into the large room, leaving the hallway empty and forsaken as screams of
upon awakening to a sleeping Potter right in front of him, eyes closed and all! He had almost fallen of off the couch in his haste to put some space in between them –not that he would ever admit it- if it hadn't been for Harry's strong arm draped across his waist, holding him back, he would have. It also managed to make him shiver uncontrollably, the feeling of those muscles as they flexed against him, trying to close the tiny bit of space Draco had managed to create after waking up. He even thought he heard an annoyed grumble coming from Harry, but Draco had been to busy focusing on getting his mind back on track that he couldn't be to sure.
"Draco…" He said, "I don't think this is going to…"
No! Not again!
jawline that could cut you when you touched it, and his eyes! Ooh, those perfect forest green eyes! Even though they hadn't changed at all Draco didn't care because he could never get bored of those magnificent eyes.
"That what?" Harry said ignoring his first question.
"Think my name's funny, do you?" Draco said. "No need to ask yours. Redhair and a hand me down robe? You must be a Weasley." Draco snapped.
"Yes! My supernatural mate,
The snake seemed to wink at Harry.
Draco felt irritation bubbling up inside him at the mocking tone. It wasn't something new though, and sometimes he enjoyed the humiliation and bold moves his imagination made Harry do...but only a little! It didn't turn him into a wanting, needy moaning mess, maybe it did before but now he definitely passed that awkward stage in his puberty…yep, he'd definitely passed that.
"I can't stop myself! Every time I see him I just, I just, I just can't meet his eyes, or even stand by his side! It just makes me all warm and fuzzy inside that I almost can't stop myself to take a deep breath and breath in that amazing smell, I tell you it's a crisis." Hermione said guiltily but serious.
"There you go," Draco said, raising his glass and opening his mouth to say something but stopping before he could, seeming to hesitate. Harry frowned a moment, looking over at his glass before deciding to raise his as well.
He sneakily grabbed his bag and placed it between his thighs. He looked around to see if anyone was paying him any mind but saw nobody looking at him. He slowly grabbed a couple of apples and put them in his bag, looking around searching for something Draco would like.
He stared at it for a while, stroking the small bundles of tiny petals carefully. It was beautiful. The way it shone like a silver coin but the way it touched the light clearly showing it's layers and layers of blossoms. The green of the stalk strongly contrasting with the silver coating, making the flowers stand out.
Harry looked back at the cup. 'Why not, I am supposed to eat this after my 18th birthday, best to start now.' He thought, and he picked up the cup and brought it to his lips. He sipped some of the blood.
When she finally realized what she'd done, she groaned out: "Dammit Ron!"
But of course, like always, Draco went too far and threw the ball away. The minute he realized he did it he was regretting it.
"Hey, guys." She said as they took the offered seats in front of her, Ron quickly picking a loaf of bread and eating it before the clock would chime and they needed to go to the pitch. "Listen, I want to apologize. It wasn't fair of me to just act that way towards you two."
"Aren't they for teeth?" Draco asked before he let out a hiss, as she put the needle into his skin. She smiled at him, and Draco just thanked his fast healing powers. When she was done, Draco rubbed the spot and waited for it to heal completely before starting to move towards the Great Hall.
"What if I kill him?" Harry asked, too worried of hurting his friend the way he hurt Draco.
"Codswallop. Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher, he wouldn't do that." Hagrid said.
Without him noticing it Harry's eyes turned into black, lucky for him nobody else noticed it either… well, everyone except Malfoy who turned pale on seeing Harry's stark black eyes. But Harry didn't notice that either, he was to busy being mesmerized by the howl that Draco made, it was just 'Wow' Harry didn't know Malfoy could make such a howl identic to that of a wolf.
But as Harry's eyes traveled over his body, Draco found himself growing impatient. Desire addling his mind as he let out a whimpering,
When he heard a cracking sound his eyes shot open, turning his head so that he could see his nightstand, he saw the ruins of his once alarm clock that he'd just broke by simply trying to turn it off.
who have forgotten how to listen…" Dumbledore said squeezing Rons' foot on which he let out a couple of whimpers.
Draco let out a whine when Harry momentarily pushed him away. His back propped up against the wall. He shrieked when Harry pushed himself in between his legs, picking them up with almost no effort as he started to nuzzle his neck. His mouth trailing down in soft, feather-like kisses. As if not wanting to break him. Showing Draco how precious he was to him.
"Hmmm…let's see, I already know what's your favorite subject, that's obvious you wouldn't actually teach something, with a risk of being expelled, without liking it now, would we? But I need to say I'm curious. Who is your favorite teacher?" Draco said, narrowing his eyes on the raven-haired boy as if it held all the answers to the universe.
Okay, maybe she was exaggerating a bit. But just to be sure she decided to tell him after the N.E.S.T.s. To avoid at least that.
"As you can see, the heir of Slytherin has left another message. Our worst fear has been realized. A student has been taken by the monster. Into the chamber itself. I'm afraid we shall have to send the students home. I'm afraid... this is the end of Hogwarts." McGonagall said.
Swallowing, Harry shook himself out of it. And tried distracting himself by crushing the bean in front of him. Seeing the red juice coming out of it he instantly put it into the cauldron. He closed his eyes breathing in and out trying not to look at Malfoy's' finger.
"W-wait, can I come see you tomorrow?" Ron asked not quick enough to stop himself from asking.
addicting, he couldn't possibly move away.
He looked back down at Draco's mouth, tempted. But still a bit hesitant.
Harry couldn't help the foolish grin that spread across his face. The first thing that came to mind was 'bloody fantastic', but he knew Ron would only stare at him like he'd grown two-heads if he said that.
"Here, let me help," Draco advanced with the piece of bedding, scrunching up his face as he tried to clean up every single drop of blood off of his lover's chin, ignoring Harry's watchful gaze.
To the ones I haven't commented yet, I will do so tomorrow :P
"Guys stop being such chickens. There's nothing to worry about." Hermione said, rolling her eyes.
"Excuse me, what?" Draco asked, swallowing in an attempt to moisten his now dry throat.
Ron closed the fridge and made his way to his bag, grabbing a chocolate frog out of it. He walked back and sat on the chair he'd placed there before, handing her the bottle and frog.
Harry sighed, taking his necklace from under his shirt as he started fumbling with it, holding it between thumb and forefinger. He smiled a bit when the wings unfolded themselves and forward to flap up and down, wanting to be released. He hadn't taken it off for even one second after Draco gave it to him. It was a token of his affection for Harry and the thing that was giving him, the slightest reassurance that Draco did have feelings for him and that he wasn't imagining it.
"Oh, like you did this time? Alright, I play along. Suppose you have come up with this
He frowned.
"I just want to make sure you're not biting off too much then you can chew here," He said, putting his hand up when he thought she was going to interject, "And I know you want to get the highest score on your N.E.S.T.s and that you're really trying to get everything in order and all but it shouldn't be at the expense of yourself, you know? I've been thinking about this a lot and these talks with Neville really helped me out to see this…and I'm worried about you." He put his hand on his heart, making a relieved face while Hermione listened; not really understanding what was happening but feeling touched all the same. She gave him a small smile wanting to thank him but was silenced when he grabbed her shoulders.
He turned back around to see Harry's eyes had opened, his back arched off the ground and his chest going up and down in a steady rhythm.
"I know, I know. But it really depends, and the way it's going I really don't know," she shrugged.
"GUYS!" Granger yelled and he and Potter fell mute not wanting to anger her even more.
Harry noticed this but didn't want to comment on it.
How could he have let this happen? How?!
Harry thought back at what had happened, and he didn't understand why Ron was so mad at Malfoy when he called Hermione a mudblood, sure Harry had absolutely no idea what it meant but he was sure that Malfoy called them worse.
"Draco! Don't just throw your apple away on school grounds!" Hermione said with a disapproving look in her eyes and moved to step in front of him. He simply rolled his eyes making her huff, but despite that, she still decided to pick it up and throw it in a bin. "Really Draco," She mumbled before taking a deep breath and going back to smiling at him.
After the shopping Draco and his mother were walking back home, on the way they saw some little kids playing with each other, they were having lots of fun. Draco looked at it with envy.
"You know, George, I've always felt our futures lay outside the world of academic achievement," Fred said with the usual hint of mischief, and Harry found himself smiling again.
It was more difficult for Draco, however, to show that kind of want yet. He wasn't sure what to do with himself -mostly because he never had a relationship of his own- and had never experienced any of it before. That's why he'd been so happy about Harry taking the lead (among other reasons), because…Harry
Then Draco blacked out.
'What does he want with me?' Harry thought.
"I…I'm…I'm not Harry." Dudley stammered in fright.
"I…" Harry stared dully at Draco's wrist, licking his lips. "I…"
kind of way. It was pretty funny and managed to be so every single time.
," He winced, looking over at Draco who gave him a look of 'Oh really? You don't say.' "But Lupin he has of, all of those things just enough, you know? He tried to help me with my dementorfobia. Actually gave me chocolate, even though I gave it to Ron, it's the thought that counts. And apparently, he used to be friends with my dad, told me a lot about him and my mom,"
When he put them on he sighed and walked over to the fridge. He opened it, he hadn't noticed it yesterday when he was in his clouded mind, but the only things that were in it were a couple of bottles of water and some energy bars, which Draco looked at with disgust. But took one anyway, not expecting anyone knocking on his door yelling: "Room service!" anytime soon.
"Tss, I'm not afraid of you and it's not my fault that Weasley here can't handle a little joke," Draco tried to play it off bravely.
The vampire made an approved rumble, pace of his thrusts consistent as he continued to suck.
…not the potion, of course, he would probably be better off doing it alone. But that didn't change the fact that he needed him.
"Ooh," Draco wailed, unable to stop himself as he started to grasp for Harry's hair. Pulling at it as the pleasure became unbearable. Only it had the opposite effect, it only seemed to spur Harry on. Even letting out a rumble of contentment that vibrated all the way to his cock.
Harry hissed to the snake in Parseltongue. On which the circular group of sinks opens and a large, open pipe was exposed.
"Alright, alright," Harry chuckled, rubbing his nose in an effort to gain his boyfriend's sympathy –not that it had actually hurt. "What? No kiss to make it better?"
'I'll ask tonight when we're having dinner.' He thought excited for the first Christmas in years.
The moment he walked into the secret base his eyes fell on the boy standing in the middle of the room, his blonde hair glistening in the small amount of moonlight that seeped into the room as he turned to look at Harry with an almost hopeful expression. Grey eyes shining brightly as a small smile of relief slowly formed onto his face, probably being afraid it had been someone else before noticing it was Harry who had walked into the room.
"This isn't about that, this is about you not backing me up because you've suddenly gone buddy-buddy with
He was
When he looked around he saw McGonagall face lit with joy and people trying to copy him. He accidentally smiled when he saw Potters' eyes almost bulge out of their sockets. But as soon it was on his face as fast it was off of it. Relieved when he noticed nobody saw him smile nor who he was smiling at.
Staring at the obvious bulge in his pajama pants.
"I've got interesting news," Lucius announced. "I've heard that the boy Harry Potter is coming back to the supernatural world."
"Not much, just the usual stuff. Threw some snowballs, wore warm sweaters, got in some trouble with McGonagall, opened a few gifts, ate, studied and slept." Harry shrugged, feeling a tingle around his neck. Smiling into the distance at the memory of Draco and a cocoa mustache, Draco smiling at him with tiny snowflakes dangling off of his hair, Draco reading a book, Draco giving him his necklace…
"Aww, come on!" They heard another voice cry, making both of them turn their gazes from a Ron having a mental breakdown to a Hermione looking very frustrated and ready to punch something, which –hopefully- wasn't them.
"Didn't think you mom and dad would leave you with nothing now did you?" Hagrid said.
"Jesus Christ Dudley, you smell horrible! What the fuck is that?!" He asked, his hand immediately trying to cover his mouth and nose from the horrible scent.
"Granger," Draco said not wanting to step out of line and say her first name.
He walked straight ahead, not looking back when he heard the chime of the restaurant as the door opened. Not turning around as his name was repeatedly being called, pleaded.
"…Ginny…"
"Yeah, and you tell me a little more than I need to know,"
There. Update. On. Time. People!
"Hey, Malfoy!" Harry said happily with a small smile on his face, but Draco only stared at him for a second before turning away again. Harry's heart sank a little bit at the action.
"What do you mean 'act like I've eaten something awful?" He said indignantly. "I am the one who has been feeding on you for all this time without knowing! You're the one who should be upset!"
Ron's eyes widened, his face becoming as red as Hermione's as the words slowly sunk in.
"Relax, dear boy. The stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around." Dumbledore answered.
It gave her a sense of relief she never thought she was capable of. She hadn't known how much it had bothered her that her mate –
He picked up some silver colored pants but hesitated as he looked at the supporting button-down shirt. He snuck a quick glance at Harry's red shirt, which lay on top of one of the chairs, and he had kept there after the talk with Hermione. He had watched it many times, stared at it, but never daring to pick it up again. It hadn't felt right to pick it up again, he should have never used it for such scandalous activities.
"No! Please, sir, Harry can sit with me!"
"No. Can you introduce me?" Ron asked, happy and smiling again.
Till now he hadn't found a way to avoid it.
Draco was right, being able to clearly see all the sea creatures through the ice had been absolutely magnificent. He watched as some merpeople waved at him, as a sea serpent eyed them strangely and the giant squid stuck his tentacles against the ice.
Now though… he was alone. His curtains were closed, his roommates had gone to first period and his cock didn't seem opposed to it if the tent in his pants were any indication.
"Nothing, just…are you sure you're fine?" He asked turning his gaze back to her's with concern written plainly in them. "Because I know you said you
He felt like a kicked puppy. He'd tried so hard to get Malfoy's attention and he'd just outright ignored him, instead of giving him tasks and avoiding his gazes.
Ron sat back and shook his friend even when Harry's eyes were locked on the doors of the Great Hall with a spark of frustration in them.
"Hey! For your information a lot of women want a piece of this," Ron pointed to himself.
Harry gave him a helpless look, begging Ron to believe him when he squeaked, "But I don't!"
And even when he'd, at last, did it. His look perfect and complete…His nerves won over. He'd spent approximately forty-five minutes in front of the mirror encouraging himself, telling that it would all be fine. That he was going to enjoy this. That Harry was going to enjoy this. That he looked very handsome and that Harry was going to swoon as soon as he saw him. That maybe this was going to be it. That Harry would want to take a step forward at last. That he was finally going to show those dark pupils full of lust and want.
Harry turned his face so he could follow Ron's gaze, seeing Hermione sitting… AT THE SLYTHERIN TABLE?!
"But- Harry said but was cut off.
P.s Also, I hadn't got time these past few weeks but I'm still planning to post the non-grammar faulty chapters one of these days.
"Thank you for trying to cheer me up. I'm off to bed." Ron said, his tone depressed as he lifted himself up and walked out of the room.
"Wait, what do you mean months? Are you telling me this has been going on for a while now?! For how long?! Why didn't you say so?! How did I not notice?! Ron! Haven't you paid attention to him while I was away?!" Hermione babbled furiously.
"Tell me what?" Harry asked now really feeling nervous. What weren't they telling?
Before his mother walked out to get him some breakfast.
Draco started opening his presents. And of course, they were all the things he asked for. It wasn't all that sad, he saw a toy he had asked for 7 months ago, so he could see they at least cared.
working. And almost ending up with the redhead walking against the door post in the progress.
"You wanna try a little drop of brandy? A little drop of brandy-brandy windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?" Marge said letting her dog drink from her wine glass. Harry was looking at the scene before him, not able to stop the smirk that was painted on his face. Because, really, that was just disgusting.
Draco huffed as he imagined it. Hurrying his pace, he kept looking around, trying to scent if Harry was already there or had left. He knew he should have watched the time more closely, looking at the clock now Draco felt himself go crazier by the minute.
To let words come out of her mouth.
"I-I'm sorry- I didn't- I thought-" Draco quickly said as panic blazed through him. He quickly moved to pick up his stuff, planning to run away as quickly as he could. He could feel unshed tears prickling in his eyes.
Hermione groaned out a noise of frustration, her forehead sweaty and flushed and her fingers coated in her own juices deep inside her as she wasn't able to get off. Mentally berating herself for not having picked up the damn dildo.
And he is even more scared to have it in the future.
"Now why would you think that?" Hermione questioned. "Of course he's attracted to you."
Not able to help himself as Draco occupied almost all of his attention. The blond-haired boy almost fell off one of the pillars, making Harry want to run towards him and completely ignoring the snitch that was flying right beside him. Felt himself slowing down as he watched Draco's backside muscles move in certain ways that made his head spin. Tripping as Draco smiled at him, his cheeks pink and rosy from running which made for the most captivating-"
"So, I see you've survived your heat." She said with a mischievous glint in her eye. Which Draco thought was highly inappropriate as well as a little disturbing.
She let out a shuddering breath, looking at the people around them and pressing her lips together. "Maybe we can get somewhere more private so we can-"
"Eighty-six. Eighty-seven,"
'And all those rules! They are unbelievable, that woman really despises children!' Draco thought, turning another corridor but came to a halt when he heard voices and saw a door he knew for certain never was there before.
"Skin? You're saying Dean's dating my sister because of her skin?" Ron said with a frown, not understanding what his friend was talking about.
When all was drank till the very last drop, Harry felt Draco slumping down and quickly stood up to keep the werewolf from falling over.
"But when she's like, talking to someone else, especially guy's, that harmless twist in my gut turns lethal. And I just get so angry. So when I saw her with Krum-
"Wha-?"
"No, I don't. How about you, Ferret? Still got a life outside sucking my best friend's dick?"
Ron grabbed his wand remembering why they were here. But he couldn't do that! He couldn't even turn his rat yellow! He looked at Hermione.
"Enemies of the heir, beware," Draco said looking over at Hermione.
Missing.
"Actually, I was going to ask you," Hermione said, a bit unsure as to why he sounded so harsh.
"Hermione, Weasley," Draco greeted his friends, although he greeted Ron with a more irritated face before settling himself to look up at Harry.
"What's she doing here?" Lavender huffed, glaring at Hermione, and Harry could already feel hell break loose.
Harry didn't understand why he couldn't just read one. Finally someone paid attention to him but of course, the Dursleys just wanted him to stay miserable.
"So tell us, Harry, what have you been up to?" Ron asked, smiling at him with curiosity. He felt Hermione's hair brush against his arm as she came into step with them. He didn't look at her, afraid that she would see right through him with that calculating gaze of hers.
gave him an explanation of their wide variety of blood supplies, saying he could even select the preferred gender and hair color. He found himself slowly getting a little uncomfortable but let it pass.
(See the end of the chapter for
(See the end of the chapter for
Still, sometimes like moments like this, Draco wanted to do nothing more but to yell at his stupid wolf to sit down and shut its face.
"I just…don't understand it. I mean, I've lost count on how many times we've told each other how much we loathe the guy, especially you! Do you have any idea how much Hermione and I needed to stop you from attacking him in fear that you would be expelled? You hated his guts and then… you guys turned all buddy-buddy and now you're even dating this guy? It's just unbelievable!" Ron rambled, making insane hand movements with the bottle still in hand to get his point across. Something told Harry that his friend was most likely already tipsy, aka they should probably take a break.
Potter though didn't look at him as he said: "Yeah, sure, I-I'll get it."
"It's true then what they're saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts." Draco said. This is Crabbe, and Goyle they are chupacabras…and I'm Draco Malfoy, I'm a werewolf."
"You're amazing," Hermione whimpered at that, pushing herself up to kiss him. "'Doing so good, you're better than I could've ever imagined."
He waved when some of them nodded to him, a smile on their faces as they noticed him.
"Oh?" Harry frowned before the realization hit him. "
"I don't come here often, so please don't mind if it's a little dusty." She said from behind him, closing the door.
Harry's eyes widened, completely caught off guard by Draco's…vulgar! "For Christ sake. Yes Draco, I am,"
"And whose hair are you ripping out?" Ron asked, letting the previous horror go.
"I suppose…you're right. Hm, never really thought about that." A corner of his mouth pulling up a bit, a look of curiousness passing on his face. "How do you want to do this? Twenty questions style, or do want this to turn into some sort of truth or dare?"
"I will murder you for this,"
"Okay, good," Harry said.
Draco looked from Harry's face down to the ground and back again, biting his lip as he felt all of his nerves fly back at him from his earlier breakdown. He nodded, waiting until Harry turned him with his back against the wall. He wasn't at all happy when instead of an expression very much like his own he saw an emotionless void, not giving anything away of how his lover really felt about this.
"Whoa. Harry, you never told me your father was a Seeker, too." Ron said in awe.
Harry sighed as he looked into Ron's pleading eyes, asking for permission.
"Welcome to your first P.E lesson, today we are going to climb," Hooch said.
Made it on time, bitches.
After a minute or so, Draco felt himself go weak, his strength slowly leaving him. When it became too much that Draco started seeing spots he tried to pull Harry away from his neck, But Harry didn't budge, still drinking and moaning.
She frowned, thinking about it. "I don't know if it works like that."
Draco didn't even bother to answer, he just wanted to get this over with.
He looked back at his half hard cock.
"You have no idea how much- how much I wanted you as you sat there all hot and bothered, looking so thoroughly flustered...you were driving me nuts!" Harry shouted as he felt his balls grow heavier.
"…I understand, I really do, it isn't easy. I know that, I've seen a ton of people going through what you're going through now." Draco said and took a step closer to Harry, bringing his hands up to cup his face as he saw tears dripping down the side of Harry's cheeks. "But you shouldn't let it consume you. You should accept it, as a part of you. And I can imagine how it seems impossible to do so, but you must. The reason why it's so terrifying, why you don't understand it, is because you don't accept it. And it will make you uncertain and confused, even angry because you can't control it. It will calm down, you will be able to control it once you've let it in and not be afraid of it. And you listen very carefully Harry James Potter,
"Yes,

can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light."
"Is there something wrong," Harry asked sounding a bit concerned.
"Don't you dare to bail on me, Potter," He mumbled out, making sure to keep his voice low. He kept glaring at the door, waiting for his 'lab partner' -as Harry would have called it- to come into class. He was a little confused, seeing as the lesson had already started; Slughorn having made an attempt at silencing the class before explaining the potion they had been working on for the past few lessons.
Hermione asked, squinting her eyes as if she was trying to remember it.
"Headmaster, you've got to stop them. They've got the wrong man!" Hermione said dashing towards Dumbledore.
And more than a little alarming.
She didn't know what to do. She just stood there, seeing one of her best friends snogging with a stupid bimbo while he could get so much better. She clenched her fists and started walking through the crowd towards the portrait hole.
"What are you smirking at?" Harry said, tone layering with playful suspicion. Draco thanking every single being out there as Harry stopped the insistent pounding in return for a more leisurely pace. Hearing Harry's question though brought another kind of smile to his lips.
She bit her lip, "Ah, which one? I didn't know you've been practising without me," She playfully bumped him on the shoulder in an effort to make him smile. Unfortunately, it didn't seem to lift the redhead from his sour mood. Her wolf starting to pace around her mind, whining. Begging to know what was wrong with their mate.
He stared at it with confusion, moving his gaze up at Harry, only to see him avoiding his glance. He seemed excited about something, biting his lip as if in anticipation and looking at him out of the corner of his eye. Draco again studied the note and decided to carefully pick it up, making sure no one else saw it. When he unfolded it he couldn't help but let a massive grin make its way across his face. He scribbled something on it before sneakily handing it over to Harry under the table.
Hope you enjoy.
But after a while, Potter turned around a bit, right when Draco had snuck a glance at him again.
"I said disarm only!" Lockhart said.
Harry nodded, biting the inside of his cheek.
'Redheaded, walking in worn-out clothes, must be a Weasley again.' Draco thought jealousy taking over him (not that he would ever admit he was jealous).
A few seconds ago, he couldn't believe his luck. He had felt a thrill going through his body as he walked inside his room with Harry in tow. He could hear his heart beating, feel his nails itching, feel his mouth run dry as he looked out of the window; down at the castle's grounds. His wolf was running circles in his head, barking victoriously while swinging its tail from left to right. Butterflies swarming inside his stomach as he kept repeating the news in his head.
"…I like…" Harry said, halting a bit when he couldn't find the right words to describe it, and instead of seriously contemplating it, Harry just said the first thing that came to mind."…his skin!"
"…You could say I have,"
"NO! Soft puppy, and smells nice." Ron mumbled, refusing to let go. Harry rolled his eyes and tried not to laugh at Rons' drunken talk. Hermione huffed and moved her shoulders and back.
"You see Harry, there are some creatures, like the Malfoy's family, who think they are better than everyone else because they're what people call pure-blood," Hagrid said.
Harry felt his hackles rise, shocked but not that surprised by Ron's outburst. He knew how much Ron hated the Slytherin, didn't understand how Hermione and he had found friendship with the blonde werewolf. And he understood his friend's reasoning, but it took great effort not to growl at him for the remark on his boyfriend. And try even harder not to just outright show his fangs to the redheaded teen.
He wanted to see Draco. Every part of him, every piece of pale skin he could get, every thought inside Draco's head, every smile, every look, every emotion, every pleasurable spot.
'Come on Harry, hang on a little longer, and you'll be in Hogwarts in no time.' Harry encouraged himself. He was sitting in his room well dressed, or at least with the clothing, the Dursleys gave him. Dreading the moment he needed to come down, open the door and welcome uncle Vernons' horrible sister, Marge. He was walking down the stairs when the doorbell rang.
"Promise?"
Some maids trailed into the room with fresh tablecloths and gasped when they saw the two young men ringing wet and shuddering slightly. "Master Draco! We must get you into a hot bath right away!" one of them chimed and started to usher the blonde man out towards the grand staircase, quickly followed by another maid ushering Harry out and chattering about getting him a bath as well. Harry couldn't complain but he didn't like the sight of Draco being taken away and 'looked after' out of his line of vision. How did they know what to do for him and what about his potions? If they didn't apply them then he could suffer a severe set-back. If not, as soon as he was dressed he would need to get back in to the blonde's bedchamber and rub one of his salves onto the blonde's chest to ease his breathing.
"Ahh, that feels strange!" he croaked out as Harry smoothed his hands up the planes of the pale stomach and rocked his hips gently until he was fully sheathed.
!" Draco barked as loudly as he could, which was quite a strain considering how strained and tight his voice felt in his throat, as he threw his breakfast bowl over at the maid who had refused to leave him alone. She had insisted on trying to feed him but he hadn't been in the mood to be fed. He hadn't even been hungry, so why hadn't she listened to him? He was fed up with no one listening to him especially whenever he fell ill.
"You've had that look on your face for a while. Something's been on your mind and people crowding around you isn't about to help the problem, is it?"
The list went on with other similar things and just after Draco had written about the last time he had been happy in –even remotely happy –down at the very bottom of the parchment, he went back up to the bullet points, the nib of his quill hovering in his quaking hand before he finally wrote down what he could never voice out loud.
With that he was gone.
Draco watched from the bed as Harry's lithe figure hobbled out of the bedroom, his limbs stiff from being cooped up in a bed for months, and a slight limp in his left leg. Seeker padded after him, his tail wagging from side-to-side. When Harry's shadow was lost from view Draco returned his attention to the jumpers and, with a sigh, resumed packing.
He spared a glance over at Harry and felt a sympathetic smile crawl onto his mouth; Harry was wearing a purple t-shirt and threadbare jeans with a pair of worn converses and a black skull-cap on his head. Draco had to admit, he missed Harry's ambush of untamable raven locks. They were feather soft to the touch, but you would never think that upon first glance.
The scent that clung to Harry's skin was always like a kick to his senses.
Draco did not mind, he still had his Harry with him to hold and love and wipe tears away from blindly green eyes. But it hurt him so much that the man who was once the hero of the wizarding world was reduced to something akin to a shell of his former self; thin and bald and eating less almost every day. It made him physically sick to even think of the 'what if's' that Hermione adored to bring up, almost like she could not wait for Harry to d- NO! He would not think of it! Harry was strong, he would not die, he knew he wouldn't.
"Better?" Harry's soft soothing voice asked. Wincing slightly, Draco nodded in response. "Good," with a final lingering kiss on Draco's buttocks, he retreated back to place the salve back in the cabinet before reaching for his wand and removing the filthy, sweaty sheet on the bed. He couldn't help but chuckle as Draco was rolled over onto one side because of it. He didn't bother putting fresh sheets on the bed. He merely went around tucking the smooth blankets in underneath and then grabbed a thick, duck feather stuffed duvet from inside the wardrobe. Once down he collapsed into the feathery softness beside his husband and peered up at him. "Feeling any better?"
Draco squirmed a little underneath him, feeling both crushed and a little gross as the cum dribbled out of his arsehole and down onto the bed and around his buttocks. He felt so sticky and grimy but as soon as Harry rolled off of him and he straightened his legs down he winced at the fierce burn spreading up from his rectum. "Merlin, Harry! You've ripped me in two!" he wailed as he rolled onto his front and tried to clench his cheeks together.
Draco snorted, not drawing his eyes away from the page he was reading from. "Well it doesn't hurt to be prepared, Harry," he replied smoothly.
"Because I want to. For months now, almost a year, people have been trying to tell me what to do; you, Ron, Molly and all those damned Healers. The only person who hasn't is Draco. And if Draco wants me to go with his for some sun and descent food -I'm taking that chance before someone else can ruin it for me!"
It had been on one of overly busy days at the shop and Draco had been left to his own devices to help everyone as Harry had been called out to an emergency in the hospital of an auror having gotten attacked. He'd dashed out as quickly as possible with only a chaste kiss to the lips as Draco watched his lover disappear out of the door. He only spoke throughout the rest of the day when dealing with customers. There had been a bunch of people putting down their names and payments for the new ointment that would help men grow their facial hair out. It had been increasingly popular as a cosmetic sort of treatment, however Harry's report on the psychological aspects could greatly improve the mental stability of most men suffering from low self-esteem and fewer lives would be lost due to depression. As soon as that exert alone had been printed in the local newspaper many women flocked to Brittany to pre-order the ointment that would be available right before the Christmas holidays.
Draco glared down at him and then softened his gaze, "Don't be idiotic, Harry, it doesn't become you. And no, what I meant was that those letters reminded me that I needed to give once in a while and you needed to take. I love you more than I could ever love anyone or anything. Now please," he reached over and ran his fingertips down Harry's face, "Stop punishing yourself."
"Draco I went to the hospital. They're keeping him comatose until his immune system is strong enough. I told you you shouldn't have taken him away."
Harry shook his damp black hair, "No, I took the next week off. I want to spend some time with you for a little while. I have missed you and I want to be there for you. I know losing your father was difficult on you even though it was predated. It's never easy to watch someone you love … slip away from you."
Over the coming months Harry noticed that he was getting premature silvery threads throughout his black hair and it worried him even further when he realised just how unbelievably stressed that he was becoming, and it was only the end of April. He still had two full months of studying before his exams. He needn't be so worried and yet he couldn't convince his mind to shut down and relax each night before he went to sleep. The only things that had been breaking his studying up throughout the last two weeks were the letters he had received from Draco throughout their mutual correspondence. It was harder to bicker through letters so Harry felt that they had a stroke of luck in this means of communication. Anything else and he would have feared that his friendship with Draco would have hit a wrong note and been terminated before it had even properly begun. Alas, that was not the case.
Draco smiled at the dog snuggled up under a small blanket, presumably one of the children's, and a chew-toy resting beside his head. Turning to Cass, Draco gestured to his dog, "is it alright if I leave him down here for the night? He won't be a bother, I promise."
With a heavy sigh he stood up from the warmth of the armchair and dragged himself over to the stairwell, opened the window and let the owl and a gust of frosty air inside. He shivered and drew his hoodie tighter around him as he unfolded the envelope, the owl hooting and disappearing back through the window without waiting for food or payment of any kind. Odd. He unfolded the little scrap of paper and held it over to the light so that he could read it properly.
The sun was warm on his face as he stepped outside to find Harry leaning against the front wall with Seeker tugging at his lead eagerly. Draco glanced at his watch -it was late afternoon and he was starving. "Fancy something to eat?" he asked as they walked out of the white iron gate and down the street.
"Don't look at me, Draco…" came the cracked voice from the bent face. Draco could not suppress the sad smile that crawled on to his mouth. Harry's fringe used to always mask his face and his tears when he bowed his head -but now there was no unruly mop to hide the droplets.
"It's no trouble," Draco breathed as his tender hands slipped down to the brunette's shoulders and kneaded the tense muscles. Harry felt himself a little shaking breath before closing his eyes and allowing his lovers touch spread warmth and relaxation into his muscles. Why had he been avoiding this man's touches these last few weeks, when they felt so beautiful even through clothes? What had he been so afraid of returning home for? Why did he always take a glass of whiskey before he got on the train home every night?
He sighed, a ringing starting up in his ears from nowhere, and winced as the cool band around his ring finger swiped across his nose. He lowered his hand and glanced down at the plain gold band gleaming in the low light of his room. He'd been given it about four years ago, when Harry was finally comfortable with their relationship to go out and buy two plain gold bands and a pair of gold chains. The memory of that day was always fresh in his mind whenever he drew the ring off the chain around his neck and slipped it onto his finger so he could feel it imprint in his skin whilst he slept. It was too much of a risk for either of them to wear their rings out publically. It would raise too much suspicion especially when there would be no woman present around either of them long enough to even be considered their better half. He pressed his lips to the ring and then ran his forefinger over the precious metal. He needed to see Harry, he needed to talk to him and see if he was alright. He knew the younger man hadn't been sleeping a lot lately, late nights and early mornings weren't a good combination especially over a long period of time.
Draco smiled as he tore his eyes away from the tree to see the content expression on Harry's face. He felt much the same way, "Happy first Christmas Harry." He raised his goblet and they clinked them together.
They cuddled up on the sofa, side-by-side, their shoes cast aside at the foot of the sofa, and their plates balanced on their laps. Harry was not very hungry, but he didn't want to waste Draco's money, so he ate slowly and enjoyed the movie, unaware that Draco kept casting him glances out of the corner of his silver eyes.
He suddenly felt every muscle in his body shaking as he snapped back to reality and stared down at the pillow clutched tightly between his hands in his lap.
He did his utmost best to ignore the catcalls from the other houses when they welcomed their new members. He tried not to let his eyes run over the Golden Trio sitting there, looking a little haggard at best, but still together and sharing in everyone else's enjoyment. He hated how easy it was for them, even the weaslette was getting it easy, being the hero-worshiper she blatantly was, was lapping up the attention that rebounded off of her brother and Potter and onto her.
Removing his hand from Potter's jeans, Draco grimaced at he slick, sticky mess coating his hand. He pulled out his actual wand and vanished the mess before turning to a red-cheeked, panting Potter. It really was a delicious sight. "See you around then, Potter," he smirked as he straightened his robes and swiftly left the library.
Draco watched as Harry worked himself into a frenzy. His face got a little redder and a vein in his neck throbbed. It took all of his willpower not to just tackle the brunette to the floor and take him by surprised to shut up. Instead he reached out and gripped his shoulder tightly and forced the younger boy to look at him. "Harry, Harry, Harry just calm down!"
Draco was left alone with his thoughts, his wand twirling between his fingers underneath the blanket that was draped around his body. The chilled air began skirting it's way over the wooden floorboards and chilled his bare feet. He started thinking about what to write. It was Harry's life, should he not be the one to do it? But then Harry had asked him to do it. He clenched his wand with both hands and tried vainly to bend it, however as his wand was so unbearably flexible it merely curved under the pressure and eased back into its original posture once he released one end of it.
Harry blinking before giving a lopsided smile and crawling up the length of Draco's body. They were both hot and damp, hovering on their high as he planted a series of kisses along the blonde's pale throat. Strong arms wrapped around his waist, pulling him deep and tight. "Careful," he grunted in Draco's ear. "Or I'll finish in you before I get to make you come."
"You needed to die," Draco repeated slowly.
Draco tilted his chin up and pressed a firm, loving kiss to the brunette's mouth, "I do love you. So much. God! I literally couldn't hold the words in anymore. It's like I finally got some fucking courage to tell you!" Harry grinned up at him like an idiot as he stepped out of his trousers and started pushing the brunette back, grabbing at his robes and slipping his hand under his waistband and squeezing his arse tightly.
He focused on listening to Harry's breathing in case he fell too ill. He didn't want Harry to relapse, not now. Not after such a lovely weekend with just the two of them and no one else -besides Seeker -to worry about. He slid up onto the bed and gently unbuttoned Harry's beautiful shirt and slipped it off of his thin body -the ribs and hipbones sticking up through his skin.
He seemed polite enough if even a little on the haughty side, but it was that smirk that enticed Harry to continue the conversation and slip his hand into the blonde man's hand and shook it firmly. "Harold Potter, but please just call me Harry. This is my first night in Paris and I'm not entirely sure where I should be or if there is anyone that I should be specifically talking to."
"Act as though you doubt that I wanted to repair this relationship because of how I felt for you instead of not wanting it to be for naught." He shot an exasperated look at the brunette across from him, his thick dark hair tinged with greying threads at the temples gleaming in the firelight. He leaned forward in his chair, "I decided that I saw the man I fell in love with once again. I saw the man I love coming back to me where he belongs. I saw you getting better and getting the best possible care in the world and that made me think just how serious you were about everything we discussed in those letters. How almost losing me must have scared you that much to catapult you out of your insufferable denial. I'm not making excuses for you and we both know that, but I'm
It was almost too true to state that by the time the Second Task had rolled around both Draco and Harry were actually looking forward to their cheesy chat-up line moments between classes and after meals.
"Maybe you should do that."
He had been torn from his comfy little bed in DENIAL.
He pit down on his lip and placed the egg over on his nightstand. He'd deal with it in the morning.
"Where to Mister Malfoy?" the elderly driver called down through the narrow windows.
Theo hummed in thought before shrugging, "Then we must have missed something vital whilst brewing it."
Draco shrugged, "we might as well try somewhere new, and the beaches appear far sandier than the ones down in Brighton."
"Taste me then," came the hushed reply as fingers threaded through his blonde hair. He tilted his head back and groaned out loud as he felt the velvety wet warmth of Draco's mouth enveloping his erection. A shiver ran through him as he thrust his hips lightly.
Harry chuckled brightly, "you really do think of everything, don't you?"
Harry was starting to see a bitter side of Ginny that he didn't really like. Not that it would have changed much between them if she hadn't been bitter. He sighed and blinked in surprise that he had come further than he'd thought.
Merlin be damned if the bastard wasn't vague enough to pique Harry's interest.
Draco started to stroke his hair, his fingers twitching every now and then. "What made you want to do it this way?"
Draco laid back down, but couldn't deny that he was a little less relaxed than he had been a moment ago. '
Draco turned away from the small window, leaning slightly on his cane and smirked at Harry. "I felt as though you were avoiding me so I thought I'd come and see what the problem was. Congratulations by the way, I told you that you'd pass."
As he accepted a flute of champagne and watched his companions drift away in the rest of the milling crowd, he surveyed the room to see if there was anyone he could talk with tonight. He felt a little discredited as he looked around the room and didn't see the shock of white-blonde hair that would have indicated the presence of Draco Malfoy. He felt a weight settle on his shoulders at the thought of having aggravated the blonde beyond belief so he wouldn't return the following evening. Perhaps he was only interested enough in dipping his toe into that specific social spectrum didn't like what he saw and simply opted to go to the opera or something else. Many suggestions were plausible. He was grateful that he was snapped out of his imaginings by Snape coming up to him and placing a hand on his elbow, "Harold I have someone here who wishes to meet the young man who spoke with his son the previous evening. Apparently you said a few things about our business that attracted his attention and he wishes to meet the person who managed to captivate his sons' interest on the subject."
Draco knelt up on his knees and stroked a tear away with the pad of his thumb, "Harry you can cry. I will love you no matter what emotion you're showing. Nothing is going to change how I feel for you," he breathed the words against Harry's cheek before pressing small, butterfly kisses against the cool skin of his cheek, chin and throat. He felt his stomach unclench as Harry leaned into the kisses and the feather-soft touches he was stroking up and down the bare skin beneath the thick, white towels.
Thankfully, Draco just settled beside him with a cool, calm patience that Harry truly admired about him, especially after everything he'd been through.
Nor had he expected to wake up to the piercing wail that alerted him to the arrival of emergency services from St. Mungo's.
He barely broke stride as he walked around the perimeter of the courtyard. Potter didn't look up, but he could tell by the hunch in his shoulders that he knew he wasn't alone. Smirking to himself, he said loudly, "Hey Potter, want to Slytherin my bed tonight?"
There was a shift in weight, ever so slight, and soon Harry's left arm was coming up to rub weakly at his naked eyes. He blinked at the white blur around him and then dropped his gaze down. When he noticed Draco he jerked in surprise, his tired green eyes widening slightly. Draco felt his heart lurch as a ghost of a smile pulled at Harry's mouth. "You c-came," he rasped out.
"And you promised me that we'd do what every year on this day, since I had to suffer that VERY awkward morning coming down in rumpled clothes, your underwear in my pocket, and being grilled by your father over breakfast?"
"I'll go and talk to her," he stated, barely even looking at the red-haired girl as he hurried after Hermione. He gave Ron a reassuring smile and clap on the shoulder before jogging to keep up with Hermione. "Hermione!" he called out as he followed her out of the Entrance Hall and onto the lawns. "Hermione wait!"
But what had Draco wished for Harry?
Satisfied, he turned and left the room.
"You're too cute," Draco breathed with a smile, before he removed himself from on top of Harry, went to grab the two steaming mugs hot chocolate and snuggled down into the warm bed, handing a cup to Harry. As they sipped their drinks in a warm, cozy silence, Draco flicked his wand murmuring 'nox' at the light before flicking it again so that the T.V. started playing. They were going to watch a sweet little movie that Hermione had tearfully rambled on about, a year or so ago.
"So you want to be my friend so I protect you?"
He snapped the water off and stepped out onto the linoleum floor, wrapped a towel around his waist and then towel-dried his blond hair before wrapping the towel about his shoulders. Upon stepping out of the bathroom he saw Harry almost completely dressed in a dark indigo shirt and dark blue jeans, polished black shoes rested at the foot of the bed as the bald man wrestled with a pair of socks. Draco smiled softly and walked to the wardrobe and opened the door, peering inside at its contents. He finally chose a pair of dark jeans that hugged his figure comfortably and a white collared shirt.
"Harry Potter -will you marry me?"
Draco pushed him up against the bedroom door and placed both of his arms on either side of Harry's head, "I beg to differ," he breathed, rubbing the ends of their noses together. Harry was about to push him away and protest when suddenly his arms were pinned over his head and his mouth was silenced by Draco's tongue forcing its way between his lips. He couldn't deny his blatant excitement pushing up through his robes, and gasped when Draco pressed up against him, their hips rutting together through the coarse cloth.
Harry looked into those silvery eyes and felt his heart jolt. Swallowing thickly, he shook his head. "No, I suppose it doesn't."
"You had no right," he ground out, his voice hoarse to his ears.
He'd always prefer the train.
With a sigh he pushed his plate away, not that he was eating much anyway, and stood up from the Slytherin table. As he straightened his robes with a flourish, he glared down at his friends. "I hate you all for giving a shit," he snapped before briskly walking away. His heart drummed loudly in his ears as he crossed the Great Hall, noting the numerous pairs of eyes turning to watch him.
"Well we can test it out on you and Theo and see if it works properly?" he replied darkly.
"What do you mean?" Draco asked as a faint frown creased his brow.
They settled in a comfortable silence -or as comfortable as they could get at this point -for a little while before Draco sighed and stood up to stretch his legs, "We can't stay in here all night. The room took a lot out of itself protecting you."
been making more of an effort to force himself to leave the hospital before the night staff came on duty, but it was difficult. He didn't know why –if he did he would fix it –but it was so difficult to find his home and Draco alluring when something in his mind was forcing himself to think of work nonstop.
Harry sighed and then pinched the bridge of his nose, "I know I'm sorry," he breathed, "It's just so suffocating being trapped in this room all the time. You got better a week ago I just don't understand why we can't even go out in the manor gardens and walk about in the fresh air. You need fresh air, as much as you can get of it before the winter months set in."
He confronted Draco later that afternoon right after they'd all accompanied Narcissa outside once again for a two hour long lunch, talking mindlessly about the latest things that had been reported in the news, how Lucius had to travel to London, of all places, in September but how excited she was that she would get to breathe some different air for a time. They'd all nodded along as she more or less chatted to herself, before they all went their separate ways inside the manor. It was back in the drawing room where Draco was spending his time reading up on the latest medical journals; he enjoyed the reading even though the voice in his head was nowhere as nice as when Harry had read to him all those years ago. He used to have such passion in his voice but recently he had lacked everything that made him 'Harry' or even human for that matter. He had his finger pressed underneath his bottom lip, his brow furrowed in concentration as he read the words before him, soaking only half of it in, when the door creaked open and slammed shut behind his godfather's presence. "Draco may I have a word with you?" he asked curtly, striding over and seating himself across the hearth in an identical armchair. He crossed one leg over the other and steeped his fingers before him, elbows propped up on the arms.
"Even so, now that the majority of the danger has passed, I feel like I don't know what to do with myself. Everything is tedious and boring and miserable!"
headquarters for the better part of a year. Even school wasn't a safe haven anymore, like it should have been." He looked into Harry's eyes with such an intense look that the brunette felt shivers running through him. "Only a world were there was no 'you' and he was the only one who ruled? Everyone would suffer like I had, maybe even more. So many people would have died. The worlds population would have diminished to at least a quarter of what it is now." He dipped his head so that blonde hair fell in front of his eyes making him appear both parts vulnerable and defensive. "So yes, I do know what it's like to not want to live in the world anymore. Because sometimes this world ... just isn't worth hanging onto."
Draco nodded, "You managed to hold my interest for two whole hours straight whilst teaching me about the internal organs of the human body, so yes even if it's a tedious day for you I am sure it would interest me greatly."
With a sigh he hurried up to the dorms and grabbed his trainers before hurrying back out of Gryffindor Tower, the note burning a hole through his pocket as he made his way along the corridors. The castle was eerie at night, so quiet and empty. He froze as soon as he came face-to-face with the door to the Room of Requirement. He was scared of what lay on the other side of that door. What if it was another difficult duel that left him feeling invaded every which way? What he left feeling like shit and never wanting to see -or follow -the blonde again?
It took Harry a few minutes of standing dumbly at he top of the staircase, trying to remember how to breathe, before he turned and made his way back up to Gryffindor Tower.
"Maybe that's what you should use the next few months to do. Find out what you want to do, make it a project or something. Do your research. If you want get your friends to help too. Look, even if you don't want to tell them everything, you don't have to. Just say that you've thought about it a lot recently and you think you need to do something outside of the ministry and the niche life you've lived up until now."
"I'll see you tomorrow morning at breakfast, okay?" Draco breathed as he stroked his thumb over Harry's soft tanned skin.
He found it strange and eerie and his palms got clammy just thinking about he. He honestly didn't know what he felt when he thought about it all. He just knew that he needed to confront whoever it was before it got out of hand and someone else other than himself found out about it all. He was no one's pet project.
Harry shifted and felt the heat through the duvet covers under his thighs and hummed in pleasure, "oh that feels like Heaven -Ooh!"
"Of course sweetheart," he breathed softly, "what do you want me to do?"
Draco reached underneath his chair and pulled his satchel out and handed Harry the small wad of already opened letters. "I was reading a bunch of them on the train home. You know how that journey can be. I needed a distraction. It did remind me of that summer a year after it had happened –You'd looked like a changed man. Almost happy, almost at peace with yourself," he commented with a twinkle in his silver eyes.
She frowned at his words. "Write -what exactly?"
It had been a long day bent over several cauldrons, completing orders for the Ministry and restocking the supply cabinet for local small malady healers. It wasn't always steady money but it helped him break even with the bills, and that was all his pride needed. Groaning, he rubbed his forehead. He had been feeling jittery all day and inhaling noxious fumes all day had only heightened that itchiness.
Severus inclined his head, "See that it doesn't Harry. You're a smart boy and I'd hate to see you suffer like that again. Especially if you can help it. Now go, you have a lot of work to do this morning," he stated as he waved Harry off, dismissing him as he returned his attention to the work splayed across his desk.
Draco nodded and rolled his eyes. He knew all too well what the redhead in question was like.
Oh, how he wished he could have had another little weekend away at the coast.
He was now the lowest of the low; an outcast among the outcasts.
"What for?" Draco asked his tone a little tight and wary.
Back in the Great Hall a lot of the Gryffindors were still murmuring, some about what had happened including the former rival, and the rest about what else was going on in their lives. Unfortunately Theo, Pansy and Blaise were three of the few discussing the unlikely pair. "What were you thinking?" Pansy hissed across the table at Blaise, "Now the whole school is going to hop onto the Slytherin's-cursed-Potter band-wagon."
It wouldn't be the same without Snape. Nothing had been the same for the Slytherin's since the man's death.
"What potions?" Draco asked sceptically.
Panic was boiling in his head as he struggled to claw his way to the surface. Air had never seemed so far away. He was sure that the lake hadn't been that deep in that particular area –a long way down perhaps –but not too deep that he couldn't get out. He was desperate for air and could feel his lungs screaming in his chest, begging him for oxygen. He wanted to cry out but refused to let the last of his air escape. He pushed his body onwards, one arm stretched out towards the sunshine filtering down into his eyes. He kicked his legs in a frenzied manner as fast as he could, his muscles burning with the effort of moving through water, something he wasn't accustomed to.
The following night they met in the empty classroom and instead of raw, hard fucking, they made slow, sweet burning love that made every moment of their lives prior to that evening a faded, grey haze at the back of their minds. Draco was so relieved that Harry was even alive that he couldn't wait to get his clothes off and commit every hair of his body to memory.
Draco hadn't pushed the matter but instead he kept receiving secret letters from Harry. For the most part they were general anecdotes about a new thing Severus was letting him do each week, even if it was to help Slughorn in the office for one hour an afternoon, it seemed to bring back a childlike enthusiasm to Harry's words that Draco hadn't realised he'd missed so much until he'd read the letter sent to him at the very end of January.
"Like fuck it isn't!"
Draco's health had been taken out of his hands and he'd been placed into Severus' care for the time being. The healer had said that it was impossible to guarantee Draco's continued good health when his own healer was incapable of looking after himself. Harry had ground his teeth at that comment but hadn't put up a fight, simply handing over Draco's medical records that he kept a cop of at home, and left it at that. If Draco agreed to it then who was he to object? He just knew that he –personally –was not ill and he was sick and tired of everyone treating him like he was. He missed being at the hospital and dealing with incessant patients and incompetent nursing staff because he kept him busy and by the end of the day he was so exhausted he didn't have the energy to do anything, not even indulge the nightmares that hounded him through every shadow. He cracked his neck muscles, trying not to think about the nightmares. That definitely wouldn't do him any good at that moment. Maybe he would take some dreamless sleep and have a little nap, perhaps? Just to shut Severus up and give his mind a few blissful hours of emptiness.
Draco turned with surprised raised eyebrows for a moment before he schooled his features into his previous smirking mask, "Oh? And how are you a small person in the eyes of society, young Harold?"
Every nerve ending was on fire as Harry picked up his pace. With Draco half on his side, with one leg clasped to Harry's chest the pleasure just crashed down on him like wave after hard, earth-shattering wave.
"Please let's not be formal, Harry. Call me Draco, unless I am royally frustrating you in which case call me whatever you like."
He shrugged a bony shoulder. He had heard the argument, he was not deaf, and he hated how Hermione was looking down at him, as though she was his mother. "I wanted to lay-in a little while longer," he gave her a meek smile as Draco placed a light-weight purple t-shirt into his lap, his hand brushing over as much of Harry's skin as he could with the simple action.
Harry's smile did not fade, "how is Seeker? I miss him."
"Well everyone knows about my childhood and defeating the dark lord and winning the war and everything. All those books have been published and only one of them was actually written by me." Draco chuckled softly at this, "What I would like you to do, is write OUR story. Of how we met after the war. How we came to be together. Up to this holiday and whatever happens after."
"Yes, didn't you know. I'm now Harry Potter's official life coach. I hear it pays very well."
That was when he had started noticing some strange things happening, and he wasn't entirely sure if it was part of a prank or not. He still needed to decide how to approach it, if at all.
"Tell me what you want, Harry," Draco growled low in his throat, his hands simply itching to tug at the robes on the brunette's body and to touch his skin again. He wanted to feel Harry pressed down on top of him and to feel himself pressed against his leg. Not that he couldn't deny Harry's obvious arousal straining between them. "Tell me. What you. Want!" he ground out so forcefully and thrust against the brunette before Harry bumped his head back against the door and moaned out loud as his hands sprung up and clutched at Draco's robes.
Potter smirked, "Interested in making some magic together? My wand is at the ready."
Draco rolled his eyes with a soft smirk, "I don't think so. Severus did explain about how the boundaries could easily be blurred to either one of us and we needed to take precautions to keep them in place. Although I don't mind when you do take care of me for silly little things like a fever or something. I like that you're attentive when I'm ill."
Harry let his hands drop away, "Untie your nightshirt and open it up for me. I need to run some diagnostic spells on you to see where the pains are in your chest and work from there. Is that alright?"
Marry?
Draco nodded his head slowly as though mulling the answer over. Eventually, he hummed to himself and leaned a little closer, "I can understand that."
"If you need help all you have to do is ask me."
That night they had all been allowed enough time to bathe themselves and have an early dinner so that they could be ready for the long walk to the hotel. The walk was to mentally prepare themselves for when they met the people congregating at the hotel; there were to be a lot of head aurors and professors, even some people who worked for the Paris Ministry of Magical Defence and various high-up pureblood families, even a few who had come from Germany and Italy. Harry had felt a little queasy at the thought of being around so many socialites and wealthy people, including prospective medical students and other people who were on a small break from neighbouring universities. It made him feel a little on edge but he had been psyching himself up all night to get ready for the long weekend. They had three nights of this and he was determined to do it.
"Draco, I know that the two of you are hardly seeing eye-to-eye at the moment, but if he is going to get back to interacting properly with people then he needs to start somewhere. You're the only person he is close to and I'd advise you to stop scowling. You'll ruin your face looking like that." He'd stated the irritability clear in his voice despite how controlled he kept it.
Harry nodded his head and then looked up when a couple of young men in grubby clothes carried a large tin tub into the bedroom, water sloshing weakly just over the sides and onto the marble floor. A young maid hurried behind and mopped the floor dry. They set the bath down and Harry thanked them and then dismissed them all with a polite smile. As soon as Draco was stripped down, his face aflame as he tensed up as Harry lifted him up and out of his bed before he lowered the blonde man into the warm soapy water. As Draco sank down so that his chin was resting on the water, Harry fumbled around rolling his sleeves up and then dribbling a phial of pale pink liquid into the bath. Immediately, Draco felt his legs strengthen a little in their resolve, having felt as weak as spaghetti not seconds beforehand. He felt like he had more energy. He hadn't felt so relieved in ages. He hummed as he soaked in the bath, oblivious to the made stripping the bed of his silk bed sheets. He didn't register Harry telling them to have basic cotton sheets, silk would do nothing for his fever and they weren't to ever use it again when he was ill or on the verge of getting ill. They'd nodded and took the ruined sheets down to the furnace.
"As funny as that would be in the moment, Andromeda wouldn't like me setting that example. Besides, I don't think I want everyone seeing my dick, thanks."
Hermione's mouth snapped shut and Draco felt a wave or superiority over-come him. She knew he was right -everyone who had been in their generation at Hogwarts knew he was right. Hermione's cheeks flared pink as she struggled to find a retort against his thinking. Draco smirked darkly at her. She glowered at him, her fingers curled into fists, "Take him back there, Draco! Or I swear to Merlin I will take you to court!"
"Down London," Draco was grateful as Cass came and hauled one of the cases, which was literally a large duffel bag, over his shoulder and beckoned for them to follow him.
Lucius and Narcissa went off where they instantly caught sight of Severus and began talking to him off to one side. Draco and Harry were left to their own devices, so as soon as Harry grasped two champagne flutes for the both of them, silently grateful for the rich food that was settling his stomach, and handed one to the blonde man beside him. Draco turned to him with a lazy smirk, "Come on, how about we go and have a stroll in the gardens and enjoy the summer night." It wasn't a request but more of a statement as to what was going to happen whether Harry wanted it to or not. He didn't protest though. He rather liked the hotel gardens. As they strolled along the stone pathways Draco smiled genuinely for the first time, "I have to admit Harry that you are good company. I haven't heard such riveting passion from anyone in such a long time. I understand it that this is your last night in Paris, correct?"
Draco shook his head, "If you don't want to I won't force you."
to live if Draco wasn't there. If he could go back and drag Draco back into the boat, he wouldn't hesitate to do so. As long as he could step back into the lake right after, and hold himself underneath the boat until he blacked out.
He turned onto his back, staring up at the blank canvas of his ceiling, trying to figure out what life will be like in the months to come, his left hand draped over Seeker's warm body.
"FUCK! HARRY JUST CO-O-OH!"
Those were the sounds of the rail that his train carriage was being pulled along on. It rocked from side to side through the gloom of the heavy twilight, the damp clinging to the paving stones as they passed from station to station, and the swollen black clouds made it appear much later than the time present on his muggle pocket watch. Cracking open his bleary eyes he felt a chill run through him and drew his arms tighter around his stomach. Another half an hour and he'd be walking up the narrow alleyway towards his large flat above the apothecary. He had finally worked up to being a full-fledged Healer, degree, certificates and everything. He had been so proud and excited when he'd gotten the news from Severus that he would be relieving some of his own duties on to Harry. It had taken the better part of six years, but along with Draco's inheritance –his mother had decided that if her grandchildren were not going to get it then Draco should invest it however he saw fit –they managed to buy an old apothecary from an elderly man who had wanted to retire. They got the building fairly cheap, but winning over the business partners were another matter entirely.
Draco growled and nodded as he clutched Harry's hair tightly in his hand. "I said for you to take me to bed and make love to me!" he snarled low in his throat, the sound running straight down to his own growing arousal and making him tremble as he stood up and snatched Draco's hand and leaned up towards him.
Draco looked into Harry's eyes and smiled softly, "Don't be silly, love. You're not a baby," he leaned over and pressed a kiss to Harry's forehead, "Now why don't you go in the living room and rest whilst I finish this and take it down to the car?"
"You've practically ignored me all day, I just want to know if I've done something to upset you," Draco state as though it wasn't really a big deal with a shrug.
"And you haven't been sleeping. Harry definitely hasn't, for quite a long time I believe. I want to know what the problem is. Have you two been fighting with one another?"
"Oof!" Draco winced, the slippery, slimy weight making him squirm. "
"Because he's my boyfriend," came a rasping voice from behind them both. They both turned with widened eyes.
Severus regarded his godson coolly, "I know what he did was wrong, and even being ill doesn't excuse him, but honestly, Draco, he wouldn't have come back if he didn't regret his actions. I'm surprised he's even fighting to get better as it is."
"Mhm" came the sleepy response from the bald man as he nodded his head against the headrest, his eyes closed.
The blonde hasn't heard him though. He had already sunk into his first blissful sleep in weeks.
"Really?"
"Oh? So ... What did you have in mind?" Harry asked. He really had no idea what the blonde man was thinking. Despite the orgasms, his opinion on the sex itself could be completely negative.
As he navigated the corridors, he replayed the conversation he'd had the other day at lunch time when he'd arrived late in the Great Hall after confronting Malfoy in the girls' bathroom. He had looked absolutely miserable and defeated. The look in his eyes had made him act on impulse and when he'd said this to his friends he was met with mixed responses; Hermione had stroked his hand and smiled, telling him that he was so much more grown up then she expected and that Malfoy needed a friend, or at the very least some compassion now that the war was over, Ron had forced himself to smile and returned to his food and Ginny and snorted at Hermione's statement, saying that people like Draco didn't deserve what they couldn't give others. She would have had a point, but then they had all been through a war and it changed people.
Harry nodded weakly, "probably as much as I miss you -but at least you've got seeker. I have no one."
"I love watching you squirm, darling," Harry quipped. "However, for now I just want you to lie back and enjoy yourself."
His mother and father had simply been delighted to know that he seemed to be getting better, although they were warned by Severus that they were still a long way off from finding a lasting cure.
, stop trying to make me admit that I am only here because of how inconvenient it would be for me to be elsewhere, because that is never going to happen, Harry."
"No mister Weasley, go on," Lupin said.
And as he looked at Draco, right now, seeing those tears traveling down those rosy cheeks, his pain making Harry's heartache… didn't it make that chance so much bigger? And besides…
"That bad at it, are you?" Ron said jokingly.
Draco was of course immediately interested in what was going on, his mother always told him he was a very curious child, so he walked to the door looking through the keyhole.
It was a trap! A manipulative technique Harry had mastered pretty quickly. One that had Draco fallen for it every time before he found out what his lover had been doing.
It had been a week since their fight, and Hermione still felt extremely guilty towards Ron. She shouldn't have protested against him, done the things she did. Now she was sure her clumsy mate hated her.
"C-cumming!" Draco yelled, feeling his entire body tightening up as his cock throbbed, pulsing out robes of cum inside his pants. Heavy panting breaths came out as he felt his body relax. As he opened his eyes –not having noticed they had closed in the first place- he was welcomed with his empty dark room. No Harry in sight.
Update!!!! And the longest one at that. Hope you liked it!
"Of course. But you're not leaving, are you?" Slughorn asked sounding a bit alarmed.
Harry had been reading non stop about all the students' creatures and how they operated. He really wanted to help them and become a better teacher than Umbridge at least. He wanted to know what they could do and how to strengthen that. He was lucky to have Hermione, without her he would be at totally lost, thanks to her love for books she already knew the best ones where Harry could read from. She also offered to help the magical students, since she had the most knowledge of magic even more than Fred and George who were 7th years. They were also participating.
"Can we please just stop talking about this?" Harry asked desperately, this was awkward for both of them. He sighed, trying to will away the flush but not really succeeding. "And how is she handling it?"
Harry slowly opened his eyes to see who made him awake from his wonderful slumber.
Draco frowned at her. "Because they're stronger than us." He answered on which she shook her head.
"Not your fault," Harry said, giving his friend a reassuring smile. "Let's just hope Hermione thing she can't tell me works," Harry said bitterly.
He looked away. "Even that's better than to have your boyfriend wanting to drink everyone's blood but yours."
Harry walked away, back to the train door where Hermione and Ron were waiting.
Harry was confused and pretty horrified by his thoughts. IT WAS BLOODY DRACO! His friend, why would he even think of questions like that? He was supposed to be disgusted picturing Draco like that, like he would when picturing Ron and Hermione like that. He was supposed to think of him as a sibling or something like that! But instead, he found himself thinking of Draco like, like…
of that! The bloody images that were now stuck in her head. She clearly had a too wide range of imagination. "I think…I'm going to make myself a cup of tea,"
"But, but you're a vampire! Vampires can't eat muggle food… can they?" Ron asked himself.
"You were there! You heard me!" Harry said.
"Mom, stop making excuses. I know how much you want to go to that convention of mystical art, you've been talking about it ever since you came home from the last one. And I'm sure Holly wouldn't mind, and yes, it's really boring here but I need to catch up with my studies anyway after my heat." Draco said. It was true that he missed Holly, but he just really wanted his mother to have this one thing.
"So you are alright with this?" She spun her hand between them, "Spending the rest of your life with me?"
"And we also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogating Malfoy," Hermione said, not giving Harry
Harry stared at the empty doorway as Dobby's painful squeals echo from the corridor.
"I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle, but if you ever wanted a different home-
"We should get dressed," Draco mumbled against his lips.
When he walked back outside he heard Malfoy calling him out. It took him by surprise, so he turned his head. Malfoy hadn't even looked at Harry these first few weeks, Harry hoped it'd be a bit longer but that was clearly not an option anymore.
A tap and another curl of his finger had her crying out. His movement repeating, twisting, thrusting.
Harry blinked a couple of times, then reached out to pick up his glasses and experimentally, put them on. Making everything go blurry. He put them off, again blinking for a few seconds and then repeating putting the glasses on and off, on and off, on and off.
Harry was walking further until he saw a woman, daughter and four boys walk by pushing carts with same stuff as Harry's.
She nervously looked between the three of them, "I can explain!"
"Shut up Harry," Ron complained getting up again.
Harry laid his book down, sitting straight. And took a deep breath.
He pictured pulling Draco out of those hungry claws of Pansy, pulling him against his chest and telling him how he was his, no one else's.
"Blood of the enemy forcibly taken," Wormtail said smiling in a devilish way and walked over to Harry.
"Draco." She said with a serious expression on her face.
Her nose twitched, as it moved upwards towards his chin, the slight stubble that was situated there scratching against it. Their eyes met and her breath hitched. "Sorry,"
"Weapons ready! When I count to three, walk towards your opponent to disarm him, only to disarm. We don't want any accidents. One, two- Lockhart said but was interrupted by Malfoy walking toward Harry giving him a blow with his ax that made Harry fall on the ground.
The door of the antechamber behind the teachers' table opened. Revealing the irritated shape of Severus Snape.
"What did you get Draco!" He yelled at her. The sudden approach making Hermione tense and frown.
"Guys, guys, stop," Harry said, when he had everyone's attention he began explaining that what they were doing wouldn't help them in a real fight and tried showing how they were supposed to do it. But it was hard, most were still not understanding what he was saying and he began running out of ideas. Maybe he could show them with Hermione but she was busy helping the other students.
Draco smelled the air and smelled an intoxicating smell. But he realized all too soon that it must be Potter.
"Well, I was five at the time. And even though I think muggles are pretty stupid, I need to give it to them, they do make the best chips." Draco nodded as he stared into space before putting another hand in his mouth. He looked out of the window towards the dark sky, seeing the moon almost at its peak.
Only for all of that to change in one night felt a little like cheating –It was also very good on his self-esteem, just great!- and now that he got it, the body he'd always wanted…it just…it didn't feel like
"Shit,
But since Harry's powers were on full alert, he should have been able to detect Neville, but he hadn't. And when he looked over at Hermione he saw the shock in her eyes too.
Hermione was in heat. Hermione was a werewolf. Werewolves got into heat. All werewolves ran that day out of the Great Hall. Draco ran out of the Great Hall. Draco was a werewolf…
Hellooooo :P
"You wouldn't be able to comprehend,"
Harry could do nothing more than…than stare! What else was he supposed to do when Draco was looking at him like a man dying of thirst?! No, but honestly. He was looking at Harry like he was a four-course meal! With dipping sauce! Seeing him like that, with his hair all ruffled and his lips shining so brightly…
Draco wasn't ashamed of this, of course, he was good at dancing, his parents sent him to dancing class before he could walk! And these Gryffindors where probably more humiliated by him seeing their attempt at dancing than anything else. But he didn't like where this was going.
" Harry grunted, practically melting against the werewolf –who was starting to lick the outer shell in an almost ridiculously sensual way. "You want to get me killed?"
"Here you go, Harry needs at least one filled goblet per day with it. That poor thing, how could I forget something so important?! You need to go, he's probably starving right now." Hermione said, her body filling with guilt and the knowledge she failed Harry. She handed the blood bag at Ron and hushed him away.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry turned and tried to run.
'O GOD PLEASE DON'T.' Harry thought.
"Don't worry Harry, I'll go talk to him," She said before stepping closer, fixing her gaze on Draco who looked unimpressed.
"Alastor!" McGonagall shouted. "We never use our abilities as a punishment, surely Dumbledore told you that." She said disapprovingly.
"We could go to Hogsmeade tonight, I don't think McGonagall would mind since I'm capable to defend us if needed to be." Harry proposed.
occasions. How much he had wanted to just throw those damn covers away and give her a helping hand, how much he yearned to lick that body from top to bottom.
Hermione bit back a moan, her body trembling as she stopped herself from grabbing the redhead, pushing him on the bed and ride him till there was nothing left. She bit her lip and shoved the curtain open, far enough so he could see her flushed face as she huffed out little breaths.
"The blood, does it taste good?"
Ron couldn't help but look at her fondly, thanking every part of the universe for not making things awkward between them. He frowned, however, when he heard her take a sharp intake of breath as she suddenly sat up.
Harry watched with a satisfied smirk as Draco's eyelashes fluttered closed. Satisfied because he was the one who made Draco this relaxed, that he was the one who brought him pleasure like that, that he would be the only one who could do that to Draco.
They broke away, a harsh breath coming from both of their lungs as they stared at each other.
"Brilliant. That makes me feel loads better." Harry said still scowling and looking Ron dead in the eye as if to say; "Don't put the blame on somebody else"
Thanks for the kudos and reading this story ;)
"You do know what you're doing right?" Draco asked worriedly.
Before again attempting to walk away.
"Oookay, I guess I'll go answer that."
"Mhmm" Harry encouraged Ron, but already thought to know what this was about.
They were adults now, they could do whatever they wanted to do. He had heard that people had asked permission to go to Hogsmeade since they were adults now, and they were allowed if the head of their house allowed it. He only had to ask McGonagall.
"I don't really mind, just give me the same as yours," Harry said, hearing Draco take to glasses out of one of the cupboards before he heard a clanking sound from what Harry expected was a bottle. He then heard some crunching sound and next thing he knew a bag of crispy bacon chips was thrown on his lap. He stared at it in surprise before Draco walked out of the kitchen with a large bottle of champagne and two crystal glasses in hand.
"You coming Hermione?!" Harry yelled up at the girls' dormitories. He was standing in the Gryffindor common room with his brown jacket slung over his shoulder as he waited for Hermione.
For Christ's sake! Ron had told Harry the second he knew, that he was in love with Hermione. Hadn't even doubted Harry's reaction and just outright said it!
Dinner party's where not something to be taken lightly in Draco's opinion. He had been to his fair share when he was a boy and could still remember the delicious smell of shrimp tartlets and devilled eggs on serving trades, Holly sneaking him some salmon pinwheels while no one was looking.
It was quiet for a moment before Harry asked; "Since when did you become so mature?" Ron got a look of annoyance on his face before he threw a pillow at Harry, who laughed at the childlike display.
still his friend- would even ask him that. He wasn't going to chase the guy out of his own room!
Then, out of nowhere, the white wolf stood before him, as if he was trying to defend him. The brown wolf stopped growling and looked at the wolf and then at Harry. And then something seemed to click.
"Right then! First years! This way, please! Come on, now don't be shy! Come on now, hurry up!" Hagrid said.
Ron moved his way next to the bed, grabbing one of the chairs and setting it next to the bed. He heard Hermione groan, and immediately thought it was one out of pain. Concern gripped him as he called her name.
"Alright class, please finish up your assignments and clear your desks, I'm looking at you, Mr Mills. The rest of you can go and have a fine afternoon, see you tomorrow!" Professor Slughorn said. The man's usual smile plastered on his face as he saw to everyone, standing in front of his blackboard. He moved towards his own desk and started scribbling something down on his papers, mumbling to himself.
They were walking until Fang stopped and started to growl.
NO, Harry, you're imagining it!
"Harry, how do you feel?" Hermione asked after a moment. And when Harry looked at her, he noticed she had sat back down looking at him concerned as well as Ron. He gave them a calm smile as he said.
"Of course, sorry." He apologised again, head as red as a tomato. He shook himself out of it though, setting a slow pace as he slid his erection in and out. As he noticed Hermione start loosening around him -careful not to dwell on that thought- he brought his hand down between her folds again.
had tackled the other boy down onto the bed and not the other way around. No, it was more his nerves wreaking havoc than anything else. Because he knew where this was going.
This! This exactly had Draco lashing out on Harry in the first place! Making frustration and exhaustion boil from deep within him. Because he loved him. He really did and for that matter; wanted to make him happy no matter what.
Had Harry hated him that much?
The three were walking up a staircase.
He stared at it, his hand lingering before picking it up. It was a green piece of cloth -if you could still call it that. The poor thing was filled with so many holes and scratch marks he wasn't even sure that it qualified as a rag. It was as if the fabric had lived through a whole massacre, abused and beaten without a second glance. He never would have thought he could ever feel pity for a lifeless object but here he was. "Jesus, Hermione! What the bloody happened to this?"
"When I call your name, you will come forth, I shall place the sorting hat on your head, and you will be sorted into your houses. Hermione Granger." The lady said.
Harry huffed and shook his head at Draco, knowing damn well he was deflecting the question but not caring as much to point it out.
"You know exactly what I'm talking about! You've been acting strange this whole year don't you dare to deny it!" Harry yelled. Draco panicked a bit, and it was probably showing on his face because Potter squinted his eyes.
"I deserve to be angry. I can't insult somebody, who has insulted me far worse, as well as you two, just because you became buddies with him?" He asked, looking at them both.
No longer giving him angry or grumpy looks instead, giving him a look of indifference.
Draco just answered with: "I'm fine, is none of your business, nothing." And so on.
"He's not Fred I am!" The other twin said.
"Probably full of Nargles, though." Harry tried to joke, trying to lighten up the mood and stumping his nerves down.
She was too surprised to react at first, the warm blanket soothing her anger somewhat as she blushed by Ron's sudden appearance of manners. They always seemed to come out at times she really wasn't expecting them and thus catching her completely off guard. The rest of his fussing not even registering as she felt adoration for the redhead spreading even further and enveloping her completely. She could feel her wolf wag it's tail, sniffing the air in need to be closer to its mate who had provided it with warmth and care that it so desperately craved. The happiness it felt by Ron's actions, the way he wanted to look out for her.
"H-heat?" Ron stammered again. Hermione let her head fall back on her pillow, as another moan escaped her.
"Scar?" Ron whispered.
"He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die." Dumbledore said.
…Wait a minute.
Harry sat upright in an instance, "What?!"
Draco fought another ear-piercing moan that wanted to escape his throat. Harry not stopping the arousing -but at the same time leading to no actual relief- act. It made him close his eyes, trying to lean back against a body that wasn't there, to begin with. With a voice in his head asking him to say please~please~please!
Suddenly Draco moved a bit to the other side and picked up something out of the picknick basket he'd brought with them. Harry tried to look at what Draco was hiding behind his back, his eyes a bit glazed over from staring too long into the fire. When Draco moved it in front of him, Harry noticed him looking at it with some uncertainty. When he was finally able to focus on it, however, he was more than a little surprised.
Only…what if she couldn't tell Ron, because it was about Ron…
"Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the Hat."
"Please! Please! Please!"
Ron groaned from annoyance. Rolling his eyes; he should've expected this.
There was a moment of silence before Harry heard something move around frantically inside.
Draco kept replaying that to try and calm his wolf, striding into the Great Hall. It being stuffed with all kinds of people, with all kinds of scents, and coming from all kinds of houses.
"Is it alright if I suck you now?" He finally asked, his face immediately erasing all previous indications of arousal he clearly had shown, settling for an emotionless devoid of indifference instead as he waited for Draco's answer.
Draco growled low in his throat. But Blaze didn't seem to catch on.
When he looked at Ron however, his face had transformed into one of disgust.
"Nothing, just…Uhg!" She said trying to sound innocent but stopped the act after seeing Draco's cocked eyebrow. She stepped towards him and leaned against the spot next to him on the wall. "I'm getting sick and tired of myself Draco." She groaned.
"…Draco," He swallowed, leaning his body away from his boyfriend in an effort to stay out of reach. Fuck, it smelled good. He could already feel his gums itching, his eyes changing colour and his stomach growling. It appeared that Draco had paid close attention -despite the werewolf's distaste of his meals- he hadn't eaten for over two days.
Draco let out a loud gasp as Harry gripped his arse, growling and grunting like he was some sort of wild animal while he massaged the piece of flesh. Making Draco whimper and a surge of blood flow through his vanes. He was certain that he was blushing like crazy, but he didn't pay any mind to it. Instead, he started gripping Harry's robes. Trying to pull him closer even though both of them knew they were as close as they could get.
"How does it taste? Good?" Draco asked after a moment, curious. He had watched Harry drink blood before, knowing the expression he always seemed to make as he did so by heart. But he never really dared to ask his lover, scared about how he would answer as well as not wanting to make his partner uncomfortable. He didn't know why he was asking now, what gave him the courage to do so, but he was glad for it since he was finally able to see Harry sputter and blushing like he had wanted to all evening.
Harry could already imagine the bruises that would imprint on Malfoy's skin and strangely enough, Harry didn't like any of it.
"But maybe -" 'Oh no.' "-you can-" 'nope, nope, nope.' "-show them."
"Can you hear me?" He asked. Which was answered by the snake when he started nodding. Alright, now Harry was really freaked out, but at the same time curious.
"Hear what?" Ron asked.
With fumbling arms he cursed at himself for leaving them open the night before, eventually falling back on his pillow as he sighed in relief when he actually managed to draw them enough so his face wasn't in the center of the yellow ball of heat.
"Um, what do they do exactly?" Harry asked confused.
Harry stood there feeling a bit uncomfortable as everyone was still staring at him.
It was dangerous, stupid and…
"What?! No, no no no! I don't even know her!" Harry tried to explain hastily. It was just, after Hermione's explanation Harry had also noticed he was very picky. Every girl that he thought was interesting in 'that' way he found he would lose interest in them rather quickly. It where mostly little things, he eventually didn't like how they talked, smelled, acted, looked, wrote (yes even that!). Or they were just boring.
"Hm," He said, trying to hide his disappointment as he sat down on the carpet, "I suppose it'd be an added bonus."
"But… my wounds should've healed already by then." Draco told his mother matter of factly. She turned around with one eyebrow raised, daring to defy her.
"B-but…" Draco stammered, really not wanting to do this.
"I really don't know what you're talking-"
Elliot put a hand over his chest. "I am deeply hurt by that, Ron. I would never-"
"Thinking about the Quidditch?" She asked, a small smile tucking at her face. Draco frowned as he looked at her with confusion before she explained, "Harry looks that way too before a match, not being able to answer my questions as he's too engrossed in thinking what he should and shouldn't do." She got a thoughtful expression on her face as she stared into space. "Ron however always worries himself into pieces before a match."
"Granger, sir." Granger said and walked towards the cauldrons pointing at one."That one there is Veritaserum. And that would be Polyjuice Potion. And that"
"I was really, really nervous you know-I mean, I honestly thought I was going to have a panic attack- I wanted to do this right, to make sure you were enjoying yourself! You know- wanting my beloved boyfriend to have the perfect night without anything standing in the way! To have you enjoying yourself- it certainly helped with that right? I mean you seem to be enjoying yourself, I'm enjoying myself, everything is great!"
Harry stared perplexed at Draco.
"You have thirty minutes. And start…now! "Tut, tut. Hardly any of you remembered my favorite color is lilac. But Miss Hermione Granger knew that my secret ambition is to rid the world of evil and market my own range of hair care potions. Good girl." Lockhart said. "Now... be warned! It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind! You may find yourself facing your own worst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here." Lockhart said and he walked over to a cage with a blanket on top. "I must ask you not to scream. It might provoke them." Lockhart said.
Just when he started getting a little light-headed the vampire stopped, blinking at him with a dazed expression before moving away from the bloodied wrist. Draco nodded to this, rubbing the drying blood off on the quilt.
The girl gave them a curious look and couldn't help but ask, "What did I miss." And sat down on the couch in front of them.
Draco watched as Harry shoved the plate with delicious things towards him. He heard his stomach growling as he smelt the different scents of meat, fruit, chocolate, and
But those were all-in-good-fun, as a tease! He hadn't outright flirted with him before…right?
He coughed as he was finally pulled out by small, but strong hands, looking around he smiled as he saw his sisters' familiar face looking up at him to make sure he was okay, she was just like their mother.
Draco was in heat!
"You better take this," Oliver said while handing Harry a small bat.
"Speak for yourself. All right there, Harry?" Ron asked with concern.
"Ooh, so you're finally going to ask Cho out, huh," Ron said when he finally understood.
"DON'T YOU DARE, You know exactly why I'm here! You fucking know that you aren't supposed to be in the forbidden forest on a FULL MOON! Did you know what could go wrong if I wasn't there! Not only would Lupin break all your stupid vampire bones, but you'd also be eaten by Granger!"
He called her a
'Great, just great.' Harry thought bitterly.
"I don't really understand how, or when it happened either! The only thing I know is
Draco was sitting on the train looking at the scenery outside, he was thinking about what Hagrid said, "Rotten to the core, the whole family…
"Sluggle's having a Christmas do, you know. And we're meant to bring someone..." Hermione said suddenly nervous. But why would she be?! She was just going to ask him as a friend, nothing wrong with that!
As Harry watched those glazy wanting eyes take in his cock, as he felt Draco lick the small vane on the side of his shaft. The way he looked up at Harry with so much passion and dedication –the only thing he could think was,
"And you…" Harry went on, noticing the awkward atmosphere they had found themselves in.
in check, not with all those jittery feelings darting through him. It was like a button that when pressed, lunged Draco into space. And with Harry continuously hitting against it he couldn't help but become a twitching, begging mess.
"Who could possibly figure that out? That's completely mental." Harry said shaking his head in fondness and trying not to smile at him but failing miserably.
"Haha. Bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry, would you like to see your mother and father again? Together, we can bring them back. All I ask for is something in return." Voldemort said and Harry took the stone from his pocket. "That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil. There is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do extraordinary things. Just give me the stone!"
"But they're so annoying," Draco complained. "They're stupid, keep asking me questions about what I like and what I don't like, I'd even play with a mudblood if they wouldn't-
She'd said, picking the flower up from the glass vase before walking back to the counter, placing a small tie on it. Giving Harry a big smile as he paid for the flower.
"Neither was I wagging my tail!"
He sat up again, bending his knees so they lay cross-legged and picked up a pillow, hugging it against his chest as he felt his face heat up against it. Of course he'd expected his first kiss wouldn't be that wonderful as some described it to be, knowing that if he thought about it realistically; it would just be two people touching another body part, and that, of course, it could be enjoyable- because why would they do it otherwise- but it would just be like holding hands… Alright, that was a terrible example, but how would he know? To him, it was just something people who loved each other did, and even when he felt the obvious yearning to kiss Potter's face off, he knew that it was just the imagination that made it such a turn on, the real deal would probably be a huge disappointment.
"Good, good. I need to tell you guys something." Harry said as he pulled a seat next to Ron. They both looked at him curiously, waiting for him to tell them what was going on.
"Uh...we were just..." Hermione stammered.
"…Harry, you're sounding like a girl-OUCH! What?! It's true," Ron defended, rubbing the spot Hermione had pinched while staring at her accusingly. She shook her head at the pouting boy, a clear sign that it wasn't the time. This, however, Harry didn't notice as he was turned with his back towards them, his hands pulling at his black strands.
"I've got it all worked out. I've filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. Simple, but powerful." Hermione explained ignoring Rons' comment.
"So tell me, why are you here?" Draco asked timidly. Harry picked up one of the chairs and put it down in front of Draco. He hesitated a moment before picking up the table as well and putting it between them. He watched as Draco frowned for a bit before answering.
"Thanks," she said back. And headed back to search for the toad.
"Sorry, could you repeat that?" Snape asked, clearly to annoy Malfoy further. And hearing Malfoy sigh, it seemed it had worked.
"I have strength enough for this." The voice said.
Once everyone had passed there was still silence hanging in the air.
He was getting fed up with this, especially when he saw the satisfied smirk Harry wore before he quickly hid it.
"Hungry. I hope there's pudding." Luna said, and Harry couldn't help but smile.
That's when he bumped into someone.
"Come here, you little git!" Harry yelled as Draco continued to move around the tree as Harry desperately tried to catch him.
"Come on, don't be shy. Come on. Come on. Hello. Neville, what frightens you most of all?"
Draco looked up from his menu, shifting his gaze to the waitress as he made his order before she took the order back into the kitchen. Harry had apparently ordered earlier, not that he had many options to choose from. After another couple of minutes, a waiter came to bring them their drinks…or food in Harry's case.
While Draco was having his internal crisis, Harry moved his other hand from where he had hidden it inside his coat.
"Well, white moves first, and then...we play," Ron said and a pawn from the other side moved forward.
When Harry looked at Hagrid he noticed how nervous he was, and not only that…
"You're probably just practicing for your next interview I expect." Ron spat back.
When Harry thought his face had finally colored to its usual color, he found himself again flushed pink.
"Look at that. Have you ever seen spiders act like that? Ron?" Hermione asked.
'And how problematic they were…' Harry thought as his eyes travelled down the expanse of Draco's throat. Bloody hell.
"DON'T TOUCH HIM," Harry said while struggling, even more, to get free, to get away, to bring Cedric's body back.
"You'll pay for that one, Malfoy!" Ron said and took out his broken wand and said, " Eat slugs!"
Suddenly there was a bludger that almost landed on his face.
"Can you walk?" Ron heard her say softly, her fingers tracing circles onto his arm. Probably unconsciously.
"They're gonna kill him?" Harry asked in complete shock. 'No, no, no this can't be happening!' Harry started standing up looking for his glasses.
Harry's hands where cupping Draco's cheek, his body pressed firmly against him. Draco was in a complete blissful daze while Harry was kissing Draco's lips while Draco was eagerly meeting his. Draco felt an unknown tingling from his body and felt himself heat up when Harry intensified the pressure on their lips moving one of his hands onto Draco's hip. Harry licked Draco's bottom lip and Draco opened his mouth in surprise, but doing that only resulted in Harry sliding his tongue into Draco's mouth making Draco squeak. Draco had never felt so breathless and lightheaded in his life! Never expected a kiss could be like…that! Harry pulled himself back a little, the need for air was too much, he was looking into Draco's eyes. Draco whimpered shocking himself with the ridiculous sound he just made and opened his eyes noticing in the mirror right behind Harry that his eyes had turned entirely yellow and that his hands had slipped into Harry's messy raven hair, claws extended.
"And you haven't? A moment ago you were trying to convince him you found a rare plant, which doesn't even exist!"
"Did you hear me?" He asked as the stomped towards the bathroom. Why did he have to do this every time? Seriously, he would eat a shoe if the vampire was on time for a change. He recalled the dirty glares at Cho's baby shower all too well and didn't need another repeat of that.
Draco's eyes snapped open as he heard Harry chuckle. Wanting to ask in an incredulous tone
on his skin. His fingers dancing in between his thighs as the vampire brought him into a whole new world of euphoria.
what she was talking about.
"So when do you want to go?" Harry asked, taking another sip of his blood. He silently moaned at the flavor.
Draco couldn't help it, everytime someone insulted him, Draco would have the perfect retort that no one was able to recover from. Even if he tried so very hard, he couldn't stop the words that would come out of his mouth.
What if Draco wasn't alone? Harry growled as the thought crossed his mind. Why? He didn't know. He should be happy if Draco found someone to spend his heat with… unless it was Pansy. No! He should be happy with however Draco had decided to sleep with. And it wasn't like he had any say in the matter.
"What?" Harry said, frowning at his friend.
And that's how it got to this. Draco had already lost some of the shame of thinking about Harry while masturbating months ago. And even when part of him was ashamed of it that didn't stop his mind from coming up with all those juicy fantasies.
Harry felt like throwing up at what Ron was suggesting. Not because it seemed horrible in general to date one of his 'secret admirers'. Some of them actually seemed to be very kind and would probably turn out to be great partners, and to them, in particular, he tried to explain as carefully as he could that he didn't like them back. It just felt so disgusting because he already
"We're gonna kick your asses!" Katie Bell yelled, on which Harry wanted to facepalm himself.
"Why aren't you with him then?" Draco asked, curiously as he saw her worried but also guilty stance.
he quickly found himself in a less comfortable position. Yeah…yeah you could say that. And yeah, it was mortifying –thanks for asking!
He was relieved when Potter walked away and entered the Great Hall, but not less annoyed.
Harry froze for a moment but quickly recovered, leaning his own head against Draco as he stared into the fire with him.
"Thank you," Harry answered, hoping he would finally stop filling his overfull glass. He could already smell the tastelessness of the drink and wasn't looking forward to actually taste it. When he picked it up, he grimaced as he felt that the blood wasn't even warm the way he liked it. He was barely keeping himself from crying out loud as he lifted the glass to his lips taking a large gulp of it.
WE'LL SEE.
Normally Potter would have a say in it too, but it was like he was taking every moment he could to avoid speaking to Draco.
And then they were alone. "Tell me mister Malfoy why you had the audacity to interrupt my lesson." Lupin started.
"Should I just go?" He asked, unsure. His hand scratching the top of his head, while the other was stuck in one of his jean pockets. Harry frowned at him, not understanding why his friend –at least
She was probably on the plan too! That would explain Harry's utter disgust at seeing her together with Malfoy, the scowl he put on every time she swang her arms around him. The nagging urge to bury her alive where no one would ever find her…
Draco carefully stuck out his head from around the big oak tree but quickly retracted it as he saw a ball coming his way. He laughed again, amused by Harry's difficulty to throw a snowball at him.
Thanks for the kudos and for reading!
"Most noble of you, Harry, to shield me, but as has been pointed out the parchment clearly says Dumbledore's Army, not Potter's. I instructed Harry to form this organization. And I, and I alone, am responsible for its activities." Dumbledore said loud and clearly.
Draco letting his hands travel in return, ruffling up Harry's hair even further, pulling on it as the kiss grew more and more greedy. Running his long fingers down Harry's spine. Moaning as he felt the way Harry's back shivered under his hands. He could feel the beating of Harry's heart against his own chest, steady and firm.
; the flow of the chocolate fountain being disturbed as people stuck their heads in it; whispers travelling all around the room from person to person.
time falling asleep…literaly.
"Hey, Dracie-poo! How are you doing?" She said, sounding a bit desperate. And Draco knew why.
"Neither should you! You're sneaking out again, aren't you!" Neville said standing up from the chair.
"Oh, okay. That's good- I mean not that you're tired just that, you know. Anyway, why are you tired? Are you having trouble sleeping? Is something upsetting you?" Hermione rambled, worry instantly covering her tone as she started asking questions.
(See the end of the chapter for
So that's why Harry watched as Draco slowly traced his hands down Harry's stomach, moving himself down to the ground along the way. A wicked glint in the blonde's eyes as he sat himself down on his knees. Watching Harry carefully.
individuals. What a day indeed.
"Hang on a minute. We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard who can rank out Voldemort, and the one he has always feared?" Hermione said.
"And with Dumbledore gone- Hermione began but stopped when Snape suddenly appeared behind them.
"It will be fine Ron," Harry said looking over at Ron, but Harry noticed a tiny movement from the Slytherin table. When he looked towards it he saw Malfoy packing his stuff and walking out of the Great Hall.
"I thought you were to be riding with Father and me to the hotel tonight?" Draco asked, frowning a little and looking a little peaky. So much so that Harry was tempted to reach over and check his temperature.
Draco continued his stroking motions along Harry's naked arms and shrugged slightly against the pillows, "Not sure. It's something called 'How I met Your Mother' it sounds horribly cliché, but I've already watched an episode and it wasn't half bad," Harry chuckled but made no further comment as they both settled down to watch the upcoming episode.
"What? Why?" Hermione screeched, balling her fingers into tight fists. She huffed and stalked across the wooden floorboards, Seeker bounding about her, his ears peaked at a curious level. She waved him away with a non-playful push against his head as she focused her glare upon the tense blond man as he bent over the bed and touched his forehead against Harry's own, hairless one, seeming like a father consoling a child. She bristled at the sight; Harry was not a baby that needed to be coddled, he needed strict, grown-up, medical attention. She cleared her throat, "Harry, how are you feeling this morning?" she asked as calmly as she could possibly manage.
A firm hand grasped on Harry's shoulder and the warm weight was comforting in a strange sort of way, "I'll tell him, Harry. He does too, you know," he murmured softly before he released his grip on his protégées shoulder and then drifted out of the room.
"Oh, then that settles the matter!" she exclaimed as she reached out to grasp Harry's end, "The hospital will survive without you for a fortnight, Harry. If Draco is ill it may be because of the pressure on his mind. You taught me that stress can weaken the psyche and make it so that some people are easier to succumb to illnesses! You are both coming to Severus' house with me and Lucius and that settles matters. Severus," she turned her attention to her friend, "I'm sure you can find some competent to help out whilst Harry is away, can you not?"
He just sat there, watching as the anguished bubbles began to fizzle out before his eyes. . His heart drummed in his ears and his stomach knotting over and over inside him making him feel sick and yet he still couldn't find the will power to loosen his grip on the oars and do something –anything –other than sitting in horrified stillness as the boat bobbed and swayed on the ripples. Would there be any real benefit from risking his own life in those deep cold depths to rescue Draco? Would there really be any real love lost between them since it had pretty much evaporated between them over the last six months? Unless … Had there about been about to be a breakthrough between them? Would they have been able to salvage something between them and make it grow? Cold dread sank down into his stomach and started to spread outwards until he was sure that his skin had turned to ice on his bones. He gripped the oars tightly and felt his eyes burn hot and deep inside his skull.
The lake lapped gently as the shore as they settled down on a grassy knoll and looked across the expanse of the glossy grey surface. They remained silent as they both collected their thoughts and tried to ease the tension twisting around in their stomachs.
Draco nodded his head as he slipped a leather bookmark in between the pages and placed the book to one side. "What is it Severus? You seem quite agitated."
"I can dry my own shirt, thank you," he snapped, the bitterness seeping into every syllable. He turned his back to Potter and went about spelling the stupid garment dry, despite how rough it now felt under his fingertips.
When Draco drew in a deep breath and lightly touched his lips against Harry's, it was such a feather light touch that Harry almost wasn't sure it had happened at all. He opened his eyes and watched as Draco waited for his reaction. He couldn't think of anything except how he wanted to feel those lips pressed firmer against his own. Sucking on his bottom lip, he leaned over and tentatively pressed his lips against Draco's and was surprised when he felt the warm pressure against his own. His eyes widened in surprise as he felt Draco's fingers creep around the nape of his neck. He shivered at the touch and gasped lightly, his eyes springing open when he felt Draco's warm wet tongue slip between his lips and touching lightly at his own. He leaned a little closer and hesitated before resting his own hand on Draco's hip through his nightshirt. They kissed lazily for a while, tasting one another gently, hands rarely drifting over muscles even through the nightshirt, and their bodies inching closer together on top of the mattress.
Harry hummed, "But it's not fair leaving you alone."
Harry let his tense expression soften a little as he pushed the phial across the table, "I'm sorry," he murmured gently, "I know I need to try a little harder. Just take your tonic, would you?" he smiled a little brighter as he took a gulp of his butterbeer.
"It's just ... soothing," Harry murmured with a shrug of his shoulders. A small yawn punctured the comfortable silence, "Draco?"
Harry grabbed at Draco's face, his expression determined and flushed, "Just take me, Draco before I
Harry felt flustered at the thought of wearing Draco's clothes, especially when he would never be able to afford something so finely cut even if he did manage to become a high ranking healer such as Snape. Draco beckoned him over as he moved towards the door, "Come on let's not waste time. If one of them fits you almost perfectly I'll have one of the maids shorten it and it'll be ready for tonight. You can keep it."
Seconds later Pansy sat down and huffed in agitation, "Whatever happened with that potion, it's making him into one soppy little bastard," she sneered, her lips curling.
With a weary sigh, Draco turned off into their bedroom, ready to kick his shoes off, and stopped dead.
"Y-your next course of treatment is-"
Draco didn't miss the latch in Harry's voice. Even after all these years the guilt could still assault him in raw, hungry waves and it made his heart ache to watch his companion suffer.
Harry closed his eyes and revelled as the information sluiced over him like soft, warm water. His lips twitched a little and he felt a single tear run down into his ear, "He's alive." It wasn't a question; it was merely saying the words aloud and making them twice as real as when Severus had said it. He felt the weight lift from his body and suddenly the world righted itself and the sun shone softly through the balcony windows and he could breathe a little easier.
to touch him, and hold him and caress him must mean something surely? He really hoped that it did.
Pansy watched him for a moment or two before nodding her head and turning her attention back to her own dinner.
He patted his pockets down and then widened his eyes mockingly, "Oh no! Would you believe it? I've only gone and lost him again."
The blond man collapsed onto the mattress beside his lover. He felt as though his heart was on every drug known to the world, it was beating so fast.
Draco sorted the problem out for him; he nodded his head and turned on his heel before walking along to the staircase to make his way back down to the dungeons. Before he reached the stairwell, however, an idea struck Harry. "Wait!" he hurried after Draco, his legs still feeling a little shaky as he went. The blonde stopped and turned to face him with a raised eyebrow. "If you want, we can meet up and duel during the evenings?"
He forced himself up from the wicker chair, his muscles stiff and sore from being sat in the same position for almost two hours, and went to the small drawer in one of the cupboard in his bedchamber. The small phials glinted in the sunlight that was pouring in through the balcony windows and he sighed as he uncorked one and shuffled over to the bed with it clutched between his fingers. The mattress sank underneath him and he raised the glass to his lips and tipped the contents back, the bitter taste hitting his taste buds sharply. Wincing and sucking on his tongue, he tossed the phial carelessly to one side and shifted down to lay on his side, watching the lake glitter in the afternoon sunlight through the balcony before his mind started to cloud over and he succumbed himself to sleep.
Draco had wanted to say the words that had bloomed in his brain less than a week ago and he had rushed to Calais as soon as Severus' invite had arrived. He promised not to rush Harry and he always kept his promises.
"I didn't come to gloat," the brunette boy insisted before softening his voice, "Do you want a dry shirt?" he asked.
He blinked the voice aside and refocused his attention –providing he was awake of course –on the sleeping blonde, his arms curled underneath the pillow, his lips parted slightly as he breathed deeply. It really would be easy, he realised, to follow through with all those times he'd watched Draco sleep and had the dark thoughts, that he could simply lean over his sleeping body and grab the neglected pillow on the other side of the bed. He could stroke it in his hands as though it was made of fine Italian silk –knowing Severus and the Malfoy's it
Maybe he did need to make the first move and reach out to his friend.
Blaise shrugged as he checked the list in his hand and held his wand a little higher, the bleak light from the tip of his wand making the labels glow. He needed the ingredients or the first steps before they were to leave the potion to sit and stew for about a week. It may not be worth it in the long run, but to see the blonde's old obsession reawaken if only for a short period of time would make it all feel like the good old days; before the war, before the bloodshed ... Before the beginning of the nightmares. There was a lot that could go wrong, he knew that, but he reasoned that it was worth a shot.
And then it happened.
At the end of a couple of hours Harry closed his second journal and placed it to one side, "If I've bored you into a coma you need only say and we can discuss something else, if you wish."
"Not to mention that the teachers aren't doing anything about it. As far as they're concerned there might as well be no Slytherin's in the school right now," Harry muttered dryly as he fell into step beside Hermione as they wandered over towards the lake. "Try not to take it so hard," Harry found himself saying.
"Potter," she said just as tightly. "Isn't Draco with you? I thought you were spending the day together?"
Severus would have been able to help him or at least talk him around into thinking it wasn't all that bad. Just someone messing about.
"A puppy?" he had asked her incredulously, almost as though she had lost her mind. She was supposed to be the smart one out of the Golden trio.
Saturday morning dawned through the curtain-less window. Harry tried to stay in bed for a little longer but he couldn't ignore the butterflies in his stomach or the fact that he had a huge throbbing hard-on that he took an especially long shower to get rid of before the others had even stirred in their beds. He spent the rest of the morning before breakfast doing some of his homework in the common room much to Hermione's surprise when she came down and saw that he was already awake and dressed. She smiled knowingly and even chuckled softly when he told her just how nervous he was feeling. She dropped a lucky kiss to his cheek just as Ron trotted down the stairs and asked if they were ready for breakfast.
The hairs on the back of his neck stood up on end and he didn't know how he should feel. He felt violated at being so vulnerable and for clearly needing someone to look out for him, but he felt really unnerved and freaked out that someone was watching him so closely and carefully all the damned time. He would have been tempted to tell someone, but he knew that most of them would simply cluck their tongues and tell him that not everything was about him like he wanted it to be. He found his heart sinking as Severus flashed in his mind.
"There's nothing to sort out, Potter," Draco retorted darkly, his voice low as he held his wand between his fingertips. The firelight caught on his hair and skin and made him look a little softer around the edges of his sharp features and hunched shoulders. "Just go and stop bothering me, okay?"
He put the pen to paper and wrote.
Harry had silently promised Hermione via the owl she had sent him, which he wouldn't spend too long looking at the map that night, but there was a small part of himself that couldn't resist the temptation. Over the last month of so he and Hermione and Ron, on occasion, had helped him out to keeping the brunt of the student body away from Draco and a few of the other Slytherin's as well, but mostly Draco. He liked to make some time and keep a track of the blonde's movements and force himself to remember whether the blonde stayed in one place too long or if he didn't make it to the Great Hall for certain meals.
They had shared many laughs even as they'd strolled along the sea-front, skimming their cloaks along the damp sand and getting the froth of the waves hitting against their shoes before the sand soaked it up again.
Draco frowned. "What-?"
Just in case.
There really wasn't much else he could possibly say against something as monumental as that, so he had let his wand-arm drop down to his side and breathed deeply, as what he had just said sank in through the angry haze inside Harry's head. He had tried to edge across the room, as though he were approaching an easily spooked unicorn. Harry had bolted anyway, muttering apologies and having tears running down his face that was white with shock. He had fled the room before Draco even had a chance to say anything to him.
The last thing he did was remove the small, translucent orange tube of pills that were Harry's to take, twice a day. He swallowed thickly and went to place them on the bathroom counter next to their toothbrushes by the sink.
Then came the sound that was so familiar to him; the panting of a lolling pink tongue, and the tapping of clawed feet trotting down the wooden floorboards that decorated their living room and hallway.
Harry."
He felt his heartbeat racing in his chest as he turned the doorknob and pushed the door open. As usual the room that greeted him was small, quaint and had nothing in it but an armchair, and a small side table facing a cosy fireplace. The blonde looked around in the armchair and smiled when he saw Harry. "Hey," he smiled as he scooted over a little on the armchair. The given space wasn't much, but Harry didn't mind. It would mean getting to touch the blonde a little more. He settled down and curled his legs up before glancing over the blonde's shoulder, "Potions again? I'd think you'd know the syllabus back to front by now."
"Are you ready?" Harry's throaty whisper flooded his sense. Draco looked up at his lover, a tan God with flushed cheeks and messy, sweaty hair. He gave a shaky nod. Harry smiled breathlessly before bending down to press a hot kiss to the blonde's mouth. He then stretched out his arm and swiped a small foil packet of the bedside table.
Draco still looked a little unsure. He sank back onto the bench and started wringing his hands in his lap. He could easily go over there like he'd done the other week. Sure, the rumor mill had churned up their names once or twice, but it hadn't been too bad. He rubbed at his knuckles once again and bit down on his bottom lip. He could do it. Sure the timing would spark rumors, but other than that would it really harm his already microscopic reputation? He swallowed thickly before nodding, "Okay ... I'll try and catch a spare moment after dinner."
"What do you fancy doing this morning?" Harry asked softly, as he swung their hands between them, a sea-gull cawing overhead.
"Didn't think of that," the blonde mused to himself before coming to his sense. "So, is there anything you've always wanted to do?"
A devilish smirk crawled onto Draco's mouth as he looped his arms around Harry's neck, his stomach flipping when he saw the excitable gleam in those green eyes. "Maybe. Would you like that?"
"I already told you 'no' Mr. Malfoy" she hissed lethally, clutching her clipboard to her stomach. "He needs to be kept in for observation."
"As long as I remain yours then it shouldn't matter, should it?" he asked softly, his heart hammering in his ears as he voiced the words into the still air. "And as long as we're discreet as possible."
"Okay -Okay -hold on."
Healer Snape led them through a series of wide, brightly lit hallways until he came to a huge set of double door that were opened for them once they'd presented their invitations. The large ballroom was a bright array of smooth woods and gold and peach glazed walls and gold trimming everywhere. It all looked so beautiful that Harry just wanted to stand and stare at it for the entire night, but he knew he couldn't. They were there to work, the beautiful of the place was merely an added bonus to soak up as he trailed to one end of the room a few paces behind his classmate –Ronald, was it? –and took a glass of fizzing champagne from the gleaming wooden bar and turned to face the room, using his analytical mind to draw out any people he could talk to and try and engage them in a conversation on the medical sciences associated to being a healer and how even a degree in potions alone could enable you to gain an apprenticeship with Healer Snape.
Harry shook his head and came around to the side of the bed, leaning close to Draco and reaching for his hand. The pale hand shifted away and was tucked underneath his arm. Harry's hand froze in mid-air and he could feel his heart crack down the middle. He held Draco's gaze for a moment, feeling all the pent up emotion from the last few months boil inside him, before he lowered his hand to his side. "Is that really how you feel?" he muttered gently.
The panting was by his knee now, their dog's head resting on his lap. It was a comfortable, familiar weight but it was not the one he wanted.
Another squeeze to his wrist drew his eyes up to meet Draco's own. "Sometimes you need to confront your fears. Do you know how scared I was seeing your dead body their in Hagrid's arms, thinking that
"'Aco?" came Harry's scratched voice from his throat. He winced at how awful it sounded to his own ears as he squinted around the bleary room and saw his blonde lover finishing with the buttons on his pajama jacket. "Hmmm what time is it?" he groaned, using the heel of his hand to rub the soreness from his eyes.
They were perched on the stone steps over-looking the sandy beach as the tide glistened in the afternoon sun some hundred yards away. A thin blanket was hanging over their shoulders as the soft breeze in the air made Harry shiver violently. Draco had insisted that some fresh air and sunlight would do him good. He had been woken up at 3:54am to the sound of Harry vomiting heavily in the toilet. He had rushed in to his fiancé's side, and massaged his shoulders that were slick with cold sweat. When Harry had finally finished emptying his stomach, Draco had helped him to rinse his mouth out over the sink.
"Yes it is," he affirmed quietly, reclining completely into the sofa, his right hand twisting the silvery band on his left ring-finger. Hermione watched his actions, trying to figure out how she had missed the promise ring.
It was when Hermione was on her third cup of coffee –he had not thought it was healthy but what did he know? He wasn't married to her –when her bright eyes lit up like two sparkling jewels. If Harry was broody then the next best thing to a baby was –
Draco's soft smile was almost blinding as he leaned in for another kiss.
Within twenty minutes they were home.
Harry peeked up through the duvet, "It's really that easy for you? To forgive what I did?"
"Weasley is just as stubborn as Draco is," Blaise stated dryly, "And from what I heard, it took a very basic one from Romilda Vane to get to him."
As he stepped into the foyer of the hotel behind Head Healer Snape and the few other medical students who had agreed to come along to the trip, Harry couldn't help but express his wonder at how beautiful the glittering décor of the high walls and the chandeliers hanging overhead were. It had taken his breath away as soon as he'd seen them. He fixed his glasses on the end of his nose and followed his fellow companions over to a small place where he handed his travelling cloak to a tall, gloomy looking man in a dark suit.
Harry had the good grace to blush as he stroked the ring and then stood up, offering Draco his hand to be led back to the bed, "So do you think you can survive another ten years with me Draco?" he breathed. Both men knew it was more than just an innocent question and even though Harry knew what Draco's answer would be, he needed to hear it said out loud. He needed it to be said out loud so that the whole universe would know that it was true.
Harry took a step forward and Draco reached out to smooth his hands over the firm thighs, tracing the muscles with his palms. He shifted to the edge of the bed and pressed warm kisses down along the firm muscles. "Let me taste you, Harry," he growled low in his throat as he grazed his teeth along the snail trail running down between his lover's legs.
"It's a tonic for his headache. He's been getting them a lot in the last couples of days. Too much stress. His mother sent that this morning, but the owl came late."
Harry's lips gave a weak twitch, "but Drake, I'm only human."
It was the first time, in any of the letters, that Harry had signed his full name. It was also the last letter that Draco had received that year. He refused to admit, even at that point, that he had been worried and fretted over Harry's well-being and sanity, especially when he didn't write to even complain about miniscule things. It had niggled at the back of his mind but he had refused to actually write to the young brunette man. He didn't actually get a chance to talk to Harry until in late July when he and his parents travelled the arduous journey along to the Lake District. Once they had settled into Severus' manor and taken a late afternoon nap to gather themselves, they went along to the conservatory and found Severus, Horace and a straight-laced, clean-cut young gentleman with his back to the three of them.
," a haughty voice ordered as something cool tapped him sharply on the cheek.
Harry blinked in surprise and hesitated a moment before licking his lips, "A boat ride?" he repeated, confusion lacing his words.
Harry twitched his mouth. "I know these last few months have been tough for you, Draco, and I love you so much for staying with me through everything but-"
The blonde man scowled as he had shifted in the chaise lounge he was in, "I'm not in the mood to talk to him, Severus. I can't forgive him for what he's done."
"Ah, Draco!" he moaned out as the blonde pushed another finger into his arse. It hurt a little, but having his cock sliding down a tight, wet throat was enough to make him dizzy with pleasure.
Hermione had offered to go with him to the hospital that afternoon, but he had declined with a small, sorrowful shake of his head. He did not want any sympathy. If he was going to continue living this way then he would need to be prepared for the worst. He'd hung up without a second thought.
"Not at all. I trust your judgement." It had been an odd thing to say but after weeks of correspondence and weekend visits he honestly did trust the brunette man before him. Besides, he couldn't lie to Draco worth a damn. Then again, he was cunning in that sense; always being honest with those around still left people questioning him though they had no proof against him. "You're going to make a wonderful healer one day, Harry. I can literally tell you right here and now that you will be a world class healer but the time you're my age."
No, he had decided there and then that he was not having children anytime soon. However, at this announcement, Harry had not necessarily been thrilled about it. In fact, he had to admit that the brunette man had become even more broody. The smile on his face was beautiful as he held one of Hermione's babies –he had not smiled that way in a while. Not to him, at least. Everyone else got to see that beautiful smile, but when they returned home it vanished into nothing but a neutral expression.
"Why, because we're gay?" Harry had asked waspishly.
He tugged the boxers down off of Harry's narrow hips and continued to lick and caress with his lips and tongue until his lover was exposed underneath him. He leaned back and was surprised at Harry's large member sitting erect against his navel, the once nest of dark curls was now replaced with hairless, unspoiled skin. It was a tortured delight for him to kiss. Harry was beautiful as he arched against Draco's mouth, the tip of his cock brushing against Draco's hot, wet lips. Draco took Harry's penis in his mouth and sucked on the head, teasing the slit with his tongue and massaging Harry's hot balls with his hand.
As he made his way out of the hotel and towards the parking lot, he felt a small twisting nagging thought jab at his subconscious. Harry had made a wish that would not only help to clear Draco's name, but disperse of all the rumors that had encircled them for the last several years.
They had gotten the name for their puppy for his amazing ability to find either one of them whilst playing hide-and-seek.
Harry nodded, "Alright then, well I'm sorry I didn't stay around for too long to see if you were alright."
Harry bit him lip before closing his eyes. "I just ... I've always wondered what I ended up missing out on, growing up as a wizard." He felt the Slytherin stiffen under his head. "Not that being a wizard is bad, you know I love magic!" He drew in a deep breath and felt his chest tighten. "I just -a lot of things with magic is almost too easy, minimal effort required. I never had the messy, slippery, fiddly sex that muggles have. I know it's a stupid thing to want but -well, we did it so ... that's that."
