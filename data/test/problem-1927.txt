He thinks Zabini would stay away now, and he does, but only when there are other people around. The Slytherin has somehow found out Draco’s routes around the castle—to use when people are looking too much—and has taken to walking with him as and when. Draco figures it’s because the bloke doesn’t need to put up his meek charade with him; he doesn’t mind the company, especially since Zabini’s true self is nasty enough to be a delightful challenge.
One, he sees in the mirror that the woman, Sirius’ cousin, is not offended by his rudeness; in fact, she’s smiling. She’s pleased to have been even addressed by Sirius.
There was a distant shout. Everything was becoming distant at this point – Theo, the room, Draco’s own body. But that shout was
‘It’s only because it’s different for us, isn’t it?’ Harry retorts, flushing. ‘I mean, we hated each other. This –’ he gestures between the two of them – ‘is new, it’s weird. So I have to know. Are we friends?’
He storms off, the portrait hole door swinging shut behind him. Harry stares at Neville, who shrugs and says: ‘I have to agree with him.’ He groans, hiding his face in his hands. They are playing Exploding Snap in a corner of the common room, which is noisy enough with the after-dinner crowd that nobody notices their argument. Hermione is studying in the library, and Ron is for some reason, with Lavender Brown.
Accidentally stepping on Potter’s fingers, he strode out of the compartment and closed the door with a hard
The streets were still fairly crowded with students bogged down with school supplies and shepherding parents. Draco kept his head down, hoping that he wouldn’t bump into anyone he knew.
Eltanin is abruptly awake, opening his eyes to a full moon, his room silvered in moonlight. His heart is pounding a deep drumbeat in the still, queer silence, his thoughts slipping out of his grasp.

left, but a drowned, wasted mind. Harry didn’t know—or didn’t want to know—how bleeding stupid it was to entangle himself with Voldemort, but after he had apologised, he had continued the Occlumency lessons with Snape.
Harry grimaces, and tells them about walking in on Draco. Sirius hoots with laughter, slapping the table top.
‘Are you all right, Harry?’ the white-haired wizard asks, stooping down next to Harry on the floor. ‘You have seen something terrible.’
And Harry told him. He told him of sleeping in a spider-infested cupboard under the stairs. He told him of miserable birthdays with nothing better than hand-me-down clothes to mark the occasion. He told him of being locked up and denied food simply for being Harry, and how the smell of cooking bacon was torture.
The blonde extended his hand. Harry tied the cord off, making sure it wasn’t too snug, and turned the bracelet around so the bead was on top. Satisfied, he looked up to see the rawness of Draco’s expression. He sighed, closing his fingers around Draco’s thin wrist.
the pranks they pulled last year. You hated Umbridge,’ his friend shot back. ‘You called her a pathetic sad little gremlin who gets off on hurting people.’
‘Come, Bennet, you are not allowed to languish on the sides like some wallflower,’ Fred Weasley declares, taking Harry’s hand. ‘You will dance with us!’
was, after all, what everyone expected of Harry Potter. He finished the last of his beer, and tried to imagine if he had quit the Aurors and failed utterly. What else was there for him?
‘I wouldn’t finish it all,’ Harry protests. ‘We haven’t started on pudding yet, sir! So, you are just in time.’
‘It was … a terrible time.’ Mathis falls silent, his expression immeasurably bleak, but he doesn’t need to say it for Draco to hear it.
to yourself, you stupid little shit? If I am all of that, what do you think it says that I chose to break all these things I supposedly don’t do for
They were sitting at the bottom of the stairwell, leaning against the wall next to each other, arms pressed against each other, the half-empty bottle of Butterbeer Draco had brought sitting between them. The sounds of Hogwarts – chatter, shuffling feet, suits of armour creaking – filtered down to them, the soft sounds of an ordinary school day. Draco was dozing lightly; he had slept only three hours this morning. He opened his eyes, blinking blearily.
He had gotten what he wanted in the end though, didn’t he? Potter paid attention to no one but him. Except Draco knew what it was like to taste Potter’s laughter on his lips and to feel Potter’s smile in his chest, and Potter’s attention now felt like hemlock poison searing against his skin. More than once, he wished Potter could just kill him.
He could just see the Weasleys from here; they were half-blocked by a crowd of Hufflepuffs. He was searching for Potter before he even realised he was. Potter stood a distance away, talking at the Weasley patriarch. Weasley was nodding slowly, Potter looking increasingly frustrated as he went on.
‘Why do you still call me Malfoy then?’ he asks bitterly. ‘What does it take for me to be enough of a friend for you to call me by my first name? You certainly have no problem calling Parkinson Pansy, and Zabini Blaise the past few months. Why do you still call me Malfoy? I am not my father, Harry!’
They are at Malfoy Manor, along with most of the Order. It is the most natural choice, considering the estate’s expansiveness and strong defences, which were enhanced by the vigorously paranoid Mad-Eye Moody. Hogwarts had closed with Dumbledore’s death, but a few of the professors—McGonagall, Flitwick, Sprout—chose to stay on. The latest owl informs them that there are over fifty people seeking protection at the school now.
The dinners and parties continue. For all the present curtailment of his enjoyment in such occasions, Harry undertakes with seriousness his duty in smoothening the road for his sister’s happy romance. When they meet, Bingley expresses with frequent and genuine regret that Malfoy, Zabini and Parkinson must leave their party so abruptly on account of urgent business in Wiltshire, where Malfoy’s estate lies. He speaks of how the trio brings such laughter to Netherfield Park, a sentiment Darcy surprisingly expresses sharing.
me,’ Dumbledore’s voice broke. ‘It’s ridiculous because I know now that he was destructive and … terrible. Brilliant, but so terrible. He’s the reason I know to spot the signs in Voldemort,’ he said, abruptly conversational. ‘He’s Gellert Grindelwald.’
He removes his claws, shaking off the blood, and holding Zabini in place, heals the wound. It goes slower than when he heals Harry, but still faster than a spell. The pain lines on Zabini’s face disappears, the tension leaving his body. When Draco releases him, he remains frozen, staring at Draco with an unreadable expression.

They fall silent, and in the silence, Draco hears his heartbeat pulsing at his temples. His muscles are trembling at the effort of keeping him in place, and he is frozen to the bone; there is only so much longer even his Veela body can bear to cling to the outside of buildings in icy weather.
Mr. Dennis Creevey glances at the half-drunk cup of tea on the table, and returns his gaze questioningly to Harry, who blushes and says, ‘Well, I was here rather earlier than I expected, and was rather thirsty. What would you like to drink, Mr. Creevey? They do serve cakes here as well, if you would like some. My sisters tell me with some authority that they are very good.’
. The warmth of Malfoy’s skin, the softness of his lips, the pressure of Malfoy’s arms twining around his neck. His chest is tight with delight, his stomach clenching. He drinks in the taste of Malfoy in his mouth, dizziness overwhelming his mind. He sinks into Malfoy’s touch, melting with the other man’s warmth. He wants to stay here forever.
Blinking away tears of pain, Eltanin breathes in his mother's familiar omega-mother scent of milk and blankets and freshly-brewed tea, and some of that suffocating
Harry did not dare go in the first night he visited. He watched through the bars large enough for a dog to slip through, previously guarded by a mind’s own hopelessness, now fortified by spells. Malfoy did not move for the entire night Harry spent there, crouched on the other side of the bars.
He waves off the man who offers to hail him a hackney, and begins the long, cold walk home. He needs to think. He needs to be
Mrs. Bennet gawps after her second daughter, and glances at Mr. Bennet, who merely sighs and pats her hand. ‘It appears, my dear, that our daughter likes the Bingley fellow a little more than she likes to admit,’ he says.
, and not one of his assistants, this is extremely old—and valuable. His pearl pieces are said to cast a very powerful Shield Charm on its wearer, making one invulnerable to most hexes, jinxes and curses. There aren’t more than fifty pieces left in the world! Your mother must have sent me the wrong one.’
‘Good-bye,’ she said mournfully, glowing pearlescent in the dimming light; the lights in Hogwarts extinguished automatically in the absence of a living being.
Love was a temporary affliction; everyone knew that. This was merely a residual delusion from the newness of his Veela body, and once he was used to being a Veela, he would get over it. He had managed to do it all those years ago, and he could do it again. He was not about to let Potter ruin his life all over again, five years after the war.
‘It is strange how manners can be so different in another part of the country,’ Malfoy says, his tone dry.
But there is no point taking it slow when Draco knows that he will never want to kiss Nolan, despite his French accent and cute smiles. So, he tells Nolan he would rather be friends, and spends enough time with the Beauxbatons students for people to think they
‘Want to have a drink before we join them?’ Luc asked, grinning mischievously and waving a bottle of Ogden’s Old Firewhiskey.
The other man’s face falls. Draco’s stomach twists. He feels just a bit nauseous for causing Potter to look as if Draco had ripped apart his favourite Pygmy Puff.
She takes him into her arms, holding him tightly. Draco squeezes his eyes shut briefly, clinging to the warmth of his mother’s embrace, but he keeps his hands tightly clasped behind his back. He doesn’t reach out for her. She pulls back, her brows creased.
His mother is first to recover. ‘Of course,’ she says with a gracious smile, rising to her feet. ‘There is plenty of space.’
He didn’t think it would be this difficult, saying good-bye to his parents, the sound of his heartbeat drowning out the
Harry steps out of the shower, shivering, as he wraps a towel around him. The doorbell rings, yanking him from his thoughts. He frowns, picking up his wand from the bedside table, and casts a surveillance spell. A wizard; a persistent one who jabs at the doorbell, holding on until the pealing becomes a long, constant whine.
Harry hadn’t imagined that this was possible: his friends mingling with the Slytherins without any lines drawn between Houses, all of them drawn together by the desire to make their world just a little better. It was almost too easy to get his friends to agree to his scheme, once he had brought Luc, Zabini, Parkinson and Goyle to a Dumbledore’s Army drinking session and explained what he had learned in the past two weeks. It seemed most of them had already realised that something was wrong – Harry was ashamed it had taken him so long.
stories of romance to be told on their part, and turns the conversation adriotly to her four children, the oldest of which will be starting Hogwarts this year.
‘This is the danger of meeting one’s mate so young,’ the older Veela sighs. ‘You could not know who you are before tying your fate with someone else, so you believe you are nothing without your mate. Myself, I met mine when I was grown.’
She levelled him with a stare of hard incredulity. ‘Stop taking the piss, you ponce! You’re planning something – aren’t you? What are you planning, Draco?’
‘Are you weeping for your tart of a boyfriend, Potter?’ Yaxley had screamed at him. The Death Eater was struggling against the chains that held him to the iron chair in the centre of the courtroom. The man looked utterly wretched, his matted, stringy hair hanging in his skull-like face. ‘We all know how you spread your legs for a
He swallows his mouthful of dry bread and salty ham, and nods and smiles. He’s fine. Sirius calls him the most prepared eight-year-old in Britain, and he will be. He must be stronger, smarter, less of a cry-baby, so that—like Dumbledore tells him—nobody must ever find out that he is omega.
Potter kept his head down, his face and body angled away from Draco. After a few long minutes of this, he realised that bloody Potter was determined to ignore him for the rest of the night. Draco made a disparaging sound; Potter stiffened, his hand pausing briefly. Oh, as if he was going to make tonight easy for Potter. Not when he had him alone for the whole night like this.
The tunnels are made of smooth black stone, fetid water trickling down the middle. They twist away into many different directions, dark and endless as the ancient serpent they hide. The air is cold and dead, stirred only by the frantic beating of Draco’s wings. He doesn’t need to watch where he is going: an invisible rope leads him to Harry as surely as a leash looped around his neck.
Draco shrugged and made a non-committal sound. Ollivander came in at the point, and began talking to Draco about a new model of wand he was experimenting with. Potter retreated to the background, and thankfully, the conversation was left behind.
There is no more of the unnatural restraint of the past year, and Draco doesn’t flinch when Harry brushes past him; he smiles and leans into Harry’s touch, like he has missed it. Harry cannot tell how much of it is merely Draco’s alpha reacting to an omega, but he wouldn’t jeopardise it. He tells himself that he would take Draco’s hand if he offers, and he mustn’t reach out when Draco doesn’t.
The words steal the breath from Harry’s lungs, claws digging into his throat. He opens his mouth, but he cannot breathe to force the denial out. Any protests now come too late, and would sound false no matter what Harry says. He can only stare, horror-struck, at Draco.
Draco wraps his arms around Harry without hesitation, his eyes fluttering shut, pressing his face as close as he can get, Harry’s glasses cold and hard against his cheek. Harry kisses him just as hungrily, his mouth opening and his tongue darting out. Draco smells it now: Harry’s intoxicating scent of orange blossoms and chocolate cake. Merlin, Draco can
Harry is bewildered at first, unable to comprehend his sex is not inherently a hindrance. Then he fills with rage, flames sweeping across a parched plain: Dumbledore had to know this, just like how he knew Harry had to die. The old man
It is much later when Draco finds himself alone with Harry—or as alone as they can be in the quiet hospital wing, with Ron, Neville and Ginny dead asleep around them. The adults were looking for them after all, McGonagall absolutely irate. She raged at them for hours: Lockhart had to be evacuated to St Mungo’s hospital, and they are uncertain if he would recover, no matter that he is a thieving arsehole.
He accompanied Dumbledore to visit an old, fat professor, Horace Slughorn, to retrieve a memory the poor man was reluctant to give up. ‘Horcruxes,’ Dumbledore said grimly later. ‘He has split his soul into fragments and put them into objects. So long as the objects exist, so does that piece of his soul. Theoretically, he can live forever.’
Hermione had looked uncertain, and would have said something if Weasley hadn’t shook his head and muttered something to her about
This time, the kiss was rougher and more desperate. Harry seemed eager to devour him. Their lips mashed together, tongues slipping and sliding. Harry’s hands dragged him in close until they were pressed up chest to chest.
He is Draco Malfoy. He is a Veela, better, faster, stronger than any wizard. Not to him, this cannot happen to
His godfather – Dumbledore’s killer – kept his iron grip on Draco’s upper arm, hauling him down the stairs. Behind them, the other Death Eaters hooted and clamoured, their grotesque cries echoing through the tower.
The least of his pains: his wrists and ankles, thick with scar tissue, where the shackles cut repeatedly into his skin. On the bad days, he can still feel the cold, heavy irons pulling him back into the darkness and he feels like he might suffocate.
‘Were you not insulted by my presumption?’ Malfoy’s voice is quiet and placid. ‘Were you not furious that I dared equate my experiences during the war to yours?’
‘Does not it worry you, having as many pretty sisters as you do?’ Malfoy starts the conversation in a desultory fashion. They are seated on a couch by the roaring fireplace.
Well, he wouldn’t have to snoop, if his parents were not always hiding things from him, purportedly for his own
Harry scoffs. ‘Bollocks. You said you know what society says about omegas. You’re an alpha! Why did you go along then, if you knew what I am, when I asked to be friends? Did you—did you pity me?’ That is worse,
Laughter wheezed out of Draco. He couldn’t help it; it was all so ridiculous. He tapped the Marauders’ Map with his wand, intoning, ‘I solemnly swear I am up to no good!’
Zabini slammed his hands into Draco’s chest, driving him backwards. The door swung shut behind him. Draco staggered back, hitting a desk.
With the whole world set against him, there was no way in Armand Malfoy’s name was he going to let anyone – besides Healer Mitra, who seemed to have the integrity to keep it to himself – know Draco Malfoy was
!’ Harry shouts at him, struggling futilely against Draco’s hold. ‘Why are you holding me back? Let me go! If you won’t go, I will go alone! Let—me—
Harry shrugs, making a face. ‘I don’t know. I think he’s said once before that it feels too … personal, bringing them into his room. He told Ron. I wouldn’t ask him about such things. I don’t want to know.’
‘It’s Veritaserum, a colourless, odourless potion that forces the drinker to tell the truth,’ Granger said of the clear potion near the Slytherins’ table.
Draco missed everything that transpired between his parents and his mother’s cousin, because the rest of the world had disappeared. He was only aware of the small, dark-haired boy standing behind him. He felt his wings unfurling, struggling to tear through his human skin, and it took all of his consciousness to cling on to control. For a truly incomprehensible moment, he
Lupin’s eyes immediately darken, jumping from Draco to Potter. He opens his mouth, but the conductor is striding down the platform, bellowing for
He knows people would find him unsavoury company—not only for his family name, but his inhumanity too.
‘Appeared out of nowhere,’ Harry says, squinting behind his smudged glasses. ‘Dumbledore must have sent him ahead. The adults are probably trying to find us. That’s Salazar, you know,’ he gestures to the statue, ‘what a prick. Built a Chamber of Secrets to put a huge statue of himself in here.’
Draco thinks of the piles of dead Death Eaters and magical creatures, broken-necked and bleeding. ‘Even in times of war?’ The blood from the rabbit he caught is still warm on his claws, the raw pink meat glistening in the sunlight, the matted, torn pelt tossed aside.
Because opening himself up these intrusions meant allowing himself to remember that Draco Malfoy was dead. It only took one wrong step and Harry would be slipping into despair, wretched in his agony for his loss.
The prince spins around in front of the fireplace, his fantastically orange robes flaring out dramatically. He runs both his hands through his hair, detangling his braid. ‘It’s because I’m omega. I must want attention, mustn’t I? I must seek out a mate, so that I can bear him a hundred fucking babies. That is what I’m good for, that is what I’m made for. I am not meant to be king! Do you think I am blind and deaf to the criticisms and whispers?’
’ll get myself off then. You can just watch – that’s what you like to do, isn’t it?’ He was pulling his robes up to his waist, hand fumbling beneath to undo the front of his trousers.
It isn’t hard to convince the Gryffindors that something needs to be done about the encroaching threat of the Dark Lord. The adults are out there, doing what they can, but
He returned to Britain because … well, this is still home, isn’t it, and Mother said she wanted to be buried with the rest of the Malfoys. Narcissa Malfoy was safely interned in the ground next to her husband and three months later, Draco is still in the United Kingdom.
Draco stared down at his sandwich, twisting his napkin in his fingers. He wanted to glare Potter down. What was he going on about? Did he think just because they had managed to spend the past few days together without killing each other that they were
She gripped the table’s edge, staring at the wizard with bright, green eyes. ‘Albus …’ she whispered hoarsely, and stopped, shaking her head. Without another word, she swept out of the kitchen, all the glasses in the room shattering in her wake. Harry ducked, throwing his arms around his head. When the clinking stopped, he lowered his arms and stared wide-eyed at Dumbledore, who was looking after Minnie.
This last word rings out across the Great Hall, silencing any voice. When Draco slowly raises the brim of the hat, he sees hundreds of faces slack and gormless with astonishment. Draco himself feels as if he has hit by a Bludger, the sheer force of the Hat’s revelation knocking the wind out of him. A soul-bond is rare enough; for Draco to have actually met his soulmate in this vast world of strangers,
‘Yes, for fuck’s sake, Draco, fuck me – fuck me hard.’ Harry hooks his hands around his knees, opening himself up for Draco. His green eyes are dark and heavy-lidded with lust, his breathing loud and heavy. ‘I want you so fucking bad.’
Draco’s friends are surprised, because it has been a few months since he dated, and he has publicly sworn off romance in a rather dramatic fashion. Harry doesn’t ask, but he hardly does when it comes to Draco’s boyfriends. Neville is the one who makes a fuss, taking Draco aside to tell him with uncharacteristic anger that he shouldn’t fool around with Zabini.
He is thrown onto his side on a hard, wooden floor. Frozen, he can only watch as the big man crouches down before him. The man is sweating, a great dirty leer stretched across his face.
Harry gave a low, rumbling laugh. “Well, I figured the only way I can get you to open up to me is if
Draco smiled broadly. Potter looked ridiculous, his legs curled up in foetal position, his face wearing a nicer expression than he ever had in Draco’s presence. Draco clicked his tongue, shaking his head in mocking disappointment.
Draco snarled, taking a step forward but tripping over the hem of his robe. Weasley gave a shout of mocking laughter.
s of the doors slamming shut by magic; the scream of the train’s horn; and the screech of wheels against the track. He waves at them furiously through the window, as the train starts moving. Potter is sticking his head out of the window, yelling his goodbyes at his godfathers, who are jogging alongside the train, waving to him.
‘No, you can’t. But even people who do the work for work, they have some other aspect of life they enjoy, some other passion they work hard for. Harry, you’re working all the time and I don’t see you taking a break or –’ she broke off with a shrug, looking frustrated. ‘Oh, I don’t know how to say it.’
The worst part was knowing that Malfoy hadn’t been taking any love potion. He had been perfectly lucid every moment he spent together with Harry. He didn’t have to tell Harry all those things he did, telling him about his childhood, about how much he loved his parents, about the secret rooms he would hide in to avoid a caning. He didn’t have to hold Harry as tightly as he did while Harry was telling him about the cupboard under the stairs. He didn’t have to look at Harry with those
Draco looked at him coolly and lifted his shoulder up in a half-shrug. ‘What map?’ he asked, continuing to pack.
The shell that was Draco’s father crumbled to the ground, an empty home, its owner fled to join the numberless stars in the sky. Narcissa Malfoy’s mouth opened, curled out the words:
Minnie nodded, her face hardening with anger. ‘We will not let them hurt you, and we will prepare you if they should ever dare come after you.’
‘Pans and Greg aren’t even here yet,’ Draco points out, shrugging off his cloak and taking his seat. ‘Besides, we’re not late, you’re simply early.’
three months back, he went into blind rage ripping the paper up and setting it on fire. Hermione had to Stun him to stop him from setting the house on fire.
‘Mother’s still ordering Father and the house elves around,’ Draco says; Narcissa Malfoy’s distinct voice floats down the stairs, an imperious tone that reminds Harry of Mrs Weasley. ‘I reckon Sirius and Remus are staying well out of her way.’
Harry sniggers, and something loosens on Draco’s face, his smile widening, as he peers up at Harry cautiously—and Harry cannot help but think how beautiful Draco is. Dismayed, he pushes these traitorous thoughts aside. It’s more important to decide what he must do now that someone knows his secret.
It was damn unfair how Draco could moon for Potter like centaurs on a full moon night, while Potter swanned around, perfectly unaware of Draco’s existence. Not to mention the fact that Potter had a
His defences – admittedly flimsy as they are – shatter the moment he sees a blonde head across the room and his excitement falters when he realises it is a stranger. He spends the rest of his night standing by the side of the room, unable to introduce himself to anyone or for anyone to introduce themselves to him, for he is a stranger to most of the society in the room. He leaves early, thoroughly disgusted with himself, for he must now admit that his desire to see Bingley is entirely selfishly motivated.
Harry’s face hardens, and he turns around fully, holding Draco away at arm’s length. ‘I’m sorry,’ he says, contrite.
“Could have fooled me,” Weasley snorted. “From what I hear from ‘Mione, Harry is being a bigger sop than you are, groaning and moaning all over the place about what an
‘I received a letter from our cousins in France,’ Mother said. ‘Aunt Melinda, do you remember her? We stayed in her villa when you were ten and you had so much fun playing with her three children, Victor, David and Elizabeth.’
Lupin turns, his face grey and hard. ‘Harry, go get Dumbledore. Use the Floo,’ he snaps, the command clear in his voice.
Harry can only blink, taken aback. Chuckling, Sirius says: ‘Hullo, Mr Ollivander. It is good to see that you haven’t changed a bit.’
He raises a trembling hand to his hurting ear. He had cast a rudimentary healing spell, but the explosion has ripped it open again. ‘
Draco laughed, nudging him a little in the stomach. ‘Well, you could have said the same about us, and look where we are now. Are you going to start snogging Snape too?’
‘I didn’t want to tell the Order what was only a suspicion,’ he said. ‘But I am afraid that after my years of research … I must conclude that Voldemort is still alive in some form somewhere.’
Harry tugged Draco in by his wrist. He wrapped his arms loosely around Draco’s waist, leaning his forehead against his, their noses brushing. He stared into Draco’s eyes that made him of thunderheads, dark and volatile.
“Don’t worry,” Potter repeated, a forbidding cold look on his face. “We wouldn’t want it to be known that pureblood wizard Draco Malfoy is now a pureblood Veela, would we?”
? Slowly, he raises his wand again, focusing the incandescent light on the intruder. Draco stops, a muscle pulsing along his jawline.
, behind him, and feels something small, hard and hot strike him on his back. He topples to the ground, unable to move a single muscle.
, Harry thinks viciously, dumping his things on the floor and throwing himself onto his bed. He squeezes his eyes shut, balling his fists. It’s wrong – he knows it’s wrong – for him to be so angry. He’s being unfair. Draco is his best friend, but just because Harry isn’t having any sex himself, he can’t expect Draco to do the same. That’s just bloody mad – and unreasonable, since as a Veela, Draco thrives on sexual energy.
It was Draco’s first time in contact with Muggles, and he had found them no different from any proud but overwhelmed parents of a precocious child. His own mother had often worn the same “That’s wonderful, dear” expression the Muggle woman had.
‘No,’ Harry says, now looking at a photo Draco took in Mother’s last month; he doesn’t turn around, but Draco can hear the eye-roll in Harry’s voice. ‘Of course I’m surprised. You never said anything about photography. I’d be surprised too if Pans came and told me she’s an pro tennis player.’
Ron handed it over, making a face. ‘I reckon we need a new face for the movement against Slytherin discrimination.’
‘Mr Ollivander?’ Sirius calls, as they walk up to the counter in the middle, glancing around for the salesperson.
“It must have been difficult to convince Teddy to stop transforming constantly in kindergarten,” Draco said to distract himself from Potter’s Potterishness.
Draco was determined not to, especially after Potter had made it clear this afternoon he had not wanted Draco there. But then Granger looked at Draco with her most tenacious expression, and he knew there was no point trying to persuade her otherwise.
It’s close to impossible for Draco to avoid him, what with Potter being friends with most of Slytherin House. Also, Pansy and Greg work with him at Potter Employment: the company Potter set up to help witches and wizards find work in both the wizarding and Muggle worlds.
Potter was frowning heavily, obviously unable to make out the reason for Draco’s overt belligerence. In the end, he decided to respond with similar hostility.
Harry stood up, and began packing his things to leave. The beady-eyed woman paused in her spiel, and asked him in a sickly sweet voice where he thought he was going. ‘I won’t be wasting my time in a class that won’t teach me anything about defeating Voldemort,’ he replied, shouldering his satchel.
Wesley stood tall and straight, looking elegant and immaculate in his fitted maroon robes, dark hair carefully combed and parted down the middle. He gave off an air of efficiency and trustworthiness. Harry had checked up on his background; the man was a pureblood with a healthy Gringotts vault.
‘Maybe,’ Draco replies, a little breathless—Harry’s mouth is close enough for their breaths to mingle—and he reduces the distance between them to nothing, and presses his lips to Harry’s.
And when the Muggle-born child had touched the correct wand and a warm light glowed from his hand, his joy and certainty had been the same Draco felt when he first got his wand.
It is too late to think of an excuse not to go, and Mother is too happy to see him invited to her cousin’s home for him to bear disappointing her. He arrives at Number 12 Grimmauld Place with his stomach cramping, clutching the expensive box of chocolates Mother made him bring. Laughing at his expression, Harry presses the doorbell.
Potter’s hand tightened around Draco’s to the point of hurting. Draco frowned, jerking his hand back, but Potter wouldn’t let go.
‘What happened?’ he demands and his eyes land on Draco’s bloodied fist. ‘You’re hurt! Who hurt you?’ He rushes in, dropping to his knees by Draco’s feet.
Draco gave a dismissive snort. ‘Being a Prefect is more trouble than it’s worth. I don’t want to spend my morning cooped with
There were holes up and down the street, as if entire shops had been scooped out and tossed aside. Bits of masonry and brick littered the narrow street, larger blocks shoved to the side. Every single glass window had been shattered, shards glittering in the murky light that reached here. Shop fronts were scorched; extremely strong
Harry’s books also say Veelas have another form: big, ugly birds the size of humans, with dirty wings and steel beaks. He flinches at the drawings that flexed and crawled across the pages; he finds it impossible to imagine Draco Malfoy as such a deformed beast.
, no longer a wizard even if his wand still worked. Generations of Malfoys must be turning over in their crypts. How his enemies would crow to see a Death Eater turned into nothing better than a beast.
‘Severus …’ the old man said again. Snape stared at him, eyes black as stone in the cold, cold night.
let him go too – do you see that, Bennet? Do you see how I thought – how I believe for so long that I was the reason Colin is gone? I should have said something, I should have stopped him, I
‘I understand from Malfoy that you and your sisters were educated at the same school as he, Zabini and Parkinson,' Darcy says to Lizzy. 'What subjects did you read? It is most admirable the dedication your family has to your education. I am considering myself the option of sending my younger sister to finishing school, so that perhaps she might become an adept and well-versed housekeeper for when she enters into matrimony.’
. Why are you asking, Harry? Don’t tell me there’s someone at school you have your eye on. What do you know about it, Draco?’
Before Harry could process his disbelief, Luc pulled away. ‘You have tea down your front, did you know?’ he asked, voice cold and snobbish.
Draco sets the seedling down, and reaches out. Zabini frowns, thinking he is reaching for the worksheet. Draco’s fingers elongate into claws sharp as a dagger, and he stabs through Zabini’s palm into the workbench below. Draco’s other hand whips around to grab Zabini’s face, muffling the scream, as he forces the other boy backwards behind the fronds of a palm tree.
The tableau broke apart slowly at first, and then completely. Death Eaters fled, Aurors chasing after them, casting
He was screaming; he didn’t even know what he was saying. There was only bone-deep aching pleasure and he was coming and coming and he didn’t think he could stop coming. Malfoy’s mouth was hot and wet, and he was grinding his fingers against that spot in Harry. Harry was seeing stars and he had no idea he had passed out until he came to, drooling from the corner of his mouth.
Harry has assumed that with the Knights vanquished and peace restored to the realm, he would not have to suffer Malfoy’s society unnecessarily. Yet, here he is. Harry doubts Malfoy and his friends are here to cause any real mischief. The influence of the Knights and their pureblood supporters is much diminished in these post-war days; no one would dare claim subscription to their club any longer. Harry thinks of his glimpses of Malfoy during the war and the boy who took off his chains with trembling hands in the dungeon courtroom; these do not indicate an individual eager to stir up the old antipathy between them. But it is also true that while Parkinson and Zabini are still active in wizarding society, albeit in a reduced capacity, no one has heard of Malfoy since the end of the war.
Draco forced himself to step away from her, feeling as if he might choke on the fragments of his heart. Mother fell to the ground, Bellatrix abusing her filthily as she wept. Draco followed Jackson out of the room, the sound of his mother’s wails wrapped around his throat, sharp as thorns.
Potter was staring at him, eyes intent. He was leaning forward, his legs drawn up, fists clenched on his knees. ‘I don’t understand what we’re doing here.’
The meeting with Zabini goes well enough. The tall, dark man proves to be as knowledgeable about their products as his mother, and he is terrifyingly charming. Harry doesn’t know much about Zabini, other than the fact that he’s a Slytherin and a friend of that unpleasant bint Pansy Parkinson. Draco remarked once that if he had been sorted into Slytherin, he would undoubtedly get along with Zabini. Harry can see why: both men have similarly large egos, albeit with enough charisma to convince everyone else of their superiority.
Harry was licking stripes up the shaft to the engorged head, fondling Malfoy’s balls as he went. He slid his tongue into the slit and without warning, because Malfoy was biting down hard on his bottom lip, Malfoy was coming, his scrunched-up face falling apart in complete release and Harry understood a little of what Malfoy meant by “the way you look”. There was warm spunk all over Harry’s face, some even landing in his hair. Malfoy exhaled breathily and swore colourfully enough to make a sailor blush.
It was only later, when Draco found Harry sitting by the bathroom door waiting for him to finish, that he admitted in a brittle voice: ‘I don’t like it when people look at me too much.’ And Harry wondered how he could protect this boy who shines so brightly he could burn himself.
‘Yeah, if she can look at my face without wanting to punch it,’ Draco said drolly. ‘My turn, Potter. What do you do in Dumbledore’s office for so many hours?’
are not bound by the silly social rules the Muggles regard as sacred,’ Lizzy remarks. ‘For Lydia does enjoy her lovemaking.’
As time goes on, Ollivander gets more and more excited, dancing around his shop and rummaging deep into his shelves to yank out boxes coated in a thick layer of dust. Abruptly, he gives a wordless yell and disappears down the dark hallway behind the counter. Harry looks over his shoulder at Minnie and Moony, baffled and worried. He flexes his sore fingers, surrounded by little mountains of discarded boxes.
The best thing Healer Mitra had done so far was to refuse to tell Potter why Draco seemed so unnaturally opposed to his presence. The Healer had muttered, “That is a matter Mr Malfoy must tell you himself,” before hastily excusing himself. It certainly riled Potter up.
‘I do not think we will ever truly understand our mothers,’ Harry says, glancing over at Mrs. Bennet to see her regarding him with a furrowed brow and a pursed mouth.
"Careful, Potter," he smirks. "Is this impression you would like to make with your future mother-in-law? Look how you have scandalised us! But I suppose this is the best way the barbarians of Gryffindor can think to propose to princes of non-existent kingdoms. It is not very becoming to gloat, you know."
. Green eyes – fierce and wild and alive – flashed behind his lids and Draco came with an embarrassing yelp, his spunk spurting out over his hand, over his belly. His cry echoed off the walls of the silent bathroom, nearly covering Potter’s gasp.
Draco wiped his watering eyes and stared into Harry Potter’s horrified green eyes. The other boy’s face was horribly swollen – probably the result of a Stinging Hex – but those eyes, oh, those eyes Draco would know anywhere. He glanced at the other two and knew Granger and Weasley knew he recognised them. He looked back at Potter.
‘Because they’re inferior. Because they’re not our sort. Muggle-borns aren’t proper wizards and witches. They come here and they muck up our world.’ Stock phrases, standard phrases.
lunged forwards,’ Draco interrupts, a fierce frown on his face. ‘I wanted to provoke you. I didn’t expect you to kiss back. You were supposed to be straight.’
His mother merely stared at him. Her face was pale but her eyes were bright and shining, the blue of deep, dark ice. She didn’t say a word, only turned her palm over and held his hand tightly. They sat there for a while, not speaking, the breakfast going cold between them.
Narcissa, exhausted by the journey, sinks to her knees on the edge of the grove. Lucius immediately drops to the ground next to her, wrapping his arm around her shoulders, his pale face pinched with similar fatigue and anxiety. They cannot fly in this part of the forest, where the trees and their branches are too close; the Fae would not allow them so easy a journey for the bequeath they are seeking here.
Malfoy pales, if it is possible for his fair skin to bleach further of colour. He turns his face away briefly, and shakes his head.
‘It follows that he must find Harry some sort of threat,’ Moony continues. ‘Journalists don’t need to know there
It dawned on Draco that Potter was stalling. Potter ran a hand through his impossibly messy hair, green eyes on the chair in front of him.
Draco paused, clenching his fists. Mother looked grey and washed-out. She sensed his presence and looked over at him. Her face cleared, the lines softening. She set her cup down and indicated for him to join her on the settee.
‘Certainly, unless he is as handsome as Fred and George describe him to be,’ their youngest sister retorts, tossing her curls over her shoulder. ‘Be a kind sister and do not spoil my fun, Lizzy! It is so tiresome when society is as unchanging as it is here. Allow me this one instance of excitement over a new gentleman in the county.’
Draco’s ears are ringing. Someone is shouting his name, shaking his shoulder and sending spikes of pain through his head. It’s a familiar voice—
Harry rubs the front of his chest, baffled and a little aggrieved. All of his friends reacted with astonishment when he first showed them what he could do, but this is the first time someone has responded with such fury.
Malfoy stared at him, face gaunt, fingers white around his dark wand. His silver eyes were luminous in the darkness. ‘You are a fool, Bennet. If we are all to stay in here, we will not even have the chance to attempt to kill each other
He moans, as if in pain, and bends over, lowering his face into his hands. ‘In my defence, Potter,’ he says, voice muffled, ‘I didn’t know my heat would be early that month—and I certainly didn’t know that it made no difference that I was the one fucking you. One night was all it took. I’m … sorry.’
Potter says: ‘For the past five years you were in France, she sent me regular reports on how you’ve been doing. I wrote to her first, because I knew what happened to you and I wanted … I wanted to help. She told me how you refused to come back, to claim me as yours even though you’ll die if you don’t, you stupid berk. It took your mother’s death to bring you back – how can you be so stupid?
He is still screaming, yes, but he is screaming in protest, in fury, in defiance. The man is lowering his pants, and Draco is so repulsed, he feels his disgust exploding out of him in an uncontrollable wave.
sister, Harry answers on Lizzy’s behalf. ‘We took the same subjects, Darcy. While they could certainly be applied to housekeeping, they are meant to prepare us for other aspects of life as well.’
‘Good evening,’ Dumbledore says pleasantly, holding up a box wrapped in glittering, red paper. ‘Happy birthday, Harry. I do apologise for being late.’
‘You are a fucking liar, Potter. You haven’t saved the world yet. I told Draco to stay away from you, but he wouldn’t listen; he was so fucking in love with you.
The pounding has not ceased, now joined by the baying and screeching of creatures thirsty for blood. Voldemort has successfully recruited werewolves and giants and hags and other Dark beings. They don’t care about the politics; they are only eager for the chance to hurt the human wizards they see as oppressors.
It was like a dam that burst in Draco’s chest and he was drowning in warm, golden light that swept aside his disbelief, his anxiety. There were only Potter’s soft lips against his, Potter’s warm face against his, Potter’s hard hands digging into his shoulders. Potter’s mouth opened and he was forcing his tongue into Draco’s mouth. Draco let his mouth fall open willingly and Potter was kissing him as if Draco was everything he could ever want to taste.
He looks up, meets her familiar blue eyes, and abruptly, everything is a blur, like peering up at the sky through murky lake water. The nothingness in his chest stirs: something, not nothing. His face is wet, his wounds stinging where the tears touch, and there is a sound, a wretched wail that feels like the world is ending. It comes from him.
‘Malfoy,’ Potter hissed, surging to his feet and grabbing Draco’s arm. ‘Don’t goad her! She punched you, remember?’
need not know, but I will tell you this: there is something you can do that will please the Dark Lord very much.’
over the past few years, but … I can’t remember them now. I’ve heard from Hermione and Ron the work you’ve been doing. It’s—it’s brilliant, I—I’m so proud of you.’ He looks up cautiously.
They told their parents, of course, and Draco had to endure another hour of his mother’s censure, coldly and effectively delivered. Not even Harry was spared: Black and Lupin were united in their disapproval of his rash foolishness. But Ron got the worst of it from Mrs Weasley, strident and implacable in her fury. They crawl into bed, cold, miserable and sore. Ron and Neville fall off to sleep quickly, but Draco finds himself awake, staring up at the grey pre-dawn light already stealing into the room. He is thinking about Voldemort bearing down on him and choking on dirty water.
. He probably has done loads of Dark Magic experiments—that’s why he has been able to come back to life, innit?’
He was back to Auror mode, eyes cool and professional, standing tall and straight. So Draco had only imagined Potter being embarrassed about telling him how he remembered little things about Draco. He sighed.
Draco cast a non-verbal Disarming Spell and was surprised when he succeeded; Dumbledore and Potter’s wands sailed to the other end of the ramparts, clattering against the stones. Potter shouted in dismay. Draco stepped out of the shadows, his palms damp and sweaty, and raised his wand to point at Dumbledore.
‘He left me. He destroyed my family, but what I couldn’t – what I can never forgive him for is that he
How can Draco explain it? It is the scent of the other alpha on Harry’s skin, heavy and acrid, as if Harry had bathed in the other man’s pheromones. Draco couldn’t hold his Veela side back from ripping through his human façade like paper: his wings, his beak, and his claws. There was only madness on his mind, dark, roiling, implacable. It was Harry’s eyes – wide and pleading – and Harry’s pain coursing through Draco that broke the spell of violence.
. You are stronger than any of them could have imagined—what you have endured and survived is greater than any of what those indolent creatures know.’
Lizzy comes to see the efforts he has taken to address the serious vices she accused him of. He is perfectly civil and genuinely interested in Mrs. Fancourt’s affairs, whose parents were servants. She told Lizzy of her surprise when the gentleman engaged her in a lengthyconversation for the first time since she came to live in the neighbourhood. Darcy is known for his meticulous responsibility as the owner of Pemberley and its surrounding lands. He is well-liked by his tenants and respected by his servants. However, Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy is not known for his social skills – until recently, when the gentleman has come to enquire with genuine curiosity about more personal matters.
‘Oh …’ Harry, taken aback by the thrust Draco chooses, tries to remember the last time he handled Draco’s wand. ‘I didn’t use it at all once I managed to fix my old wand, but … it felt fine. It still felt like a wand, if that makes sense.’
It was like reaching out to embrace a vast, cloudless night sky dusted with thick swaths of stars, knowing that he had the secrets to the universe in his arms, but being denied that one taste of pure starlight, the ineffable knowledge of what everything meant.
!’ The others snigger. Harry grins to see Ron and Hermione getting along better than ever. He reckons that Ginny is right: it’s easier when the two of them have decided that they would only ever be friends, and see other people. Hermione has been going out with Fred for nearly a year.
Potter snorted. ‘You’re trying to make me with one little cute anecdote that the Malfoy family isn’t rotten through and through when your father tried to kill me last year?’
to check the time. Draco stands in the shadows near the pub’s entrance, cold hands shoved deep into his pockets. The sight of Potter is like the soothing whisper of storm-cooled air at the end of a muggy afternoon.
Potter smiles uncertainly. ‘It’s all right really, you don’t have to stay. It’s not like – well, we don’t any time alone just the two of us, have we?’
He lifted his head to see Malfoy sitting at the foot of the bed, looking at him with a satisfied, soppy smile. ‘Come here,’ he growled, reaching out to pull Malfoy down onto the bed next to him.
He opened his eyes, looking instead at the Dark Mark. His thumbnail dug into the lines, the parted flesh weeping drops of dark blood. Elsewhere in the Great Hall, Potter’s family and friends were crying tears of salt. Draco – he knew he was only good enough to bleed for it where he trembled in the corner.
‘I am sorry for my disgraceful behaviour at our last meeting,’ he says quietly. ‘I was thoughtless and most uncivil with my words. You should not have had to bear it.’
He cocks his head, blinking his bird eyes at Harry, appearing for all like an inhuman beast. Harry holds his gaze, regarding him steadily, unflinchingly. Draco takes a step closer, filling the space between them with the dusty smell of wings and the musk of a predator. Harry tilts his head back, exposing his neck, his jaw set stubbornly.
Draco blinked. Something within him shifted, settling into place, and the knot in his stomach eased. He smiled back involuntarily, knowing in the joy humming in his blood that he was home.
Malfoy looks at him with incredulity, a sardonic twist to his lips. ‘And yet, Bennet, you could not have looked at me with more loathing on the first night we reunited.’ He waves a hand, dismissing Harry’s protests. ‘Oh, I am not accusing you of prejudice. I am merely stating a fact. After all, I have made terrible mistakes.’
Draco rests his elbows on his knees, cocking his head and looking up at Harry. The sliver of a smile on his face is mocking.
The dark-haired man breaks into a brilliant grin, raising a hand in welcome. Draco’s heart stutters. The pain beneath his skin sears, rendering him insensible for a few seconds. He takes a deep breath, choking back the emotions clawing up his throat, and walks over.
Draco no longer reaches out to grab Harry’s hand to pull him into the seat next to him. No longer rests his arm around Harry’s shoulder as they walk to their next class. No longer sneaks into Harry’s bed after the others are asleep, kicking his cold bony feet against Harry’s legs, telling him to make room, so that they might talk about Draco’s latest epiphany until they fall asleep.
He jumps, his head snapping backwards. An old wizard is stepping out onto a ladder from the paper-thin gap between two shelves. He peers down at the group of them, blinking owlishly from behind thick glasses.
me?’ And Harry cannot tell which is worse: to be faced with that monstrously cruel child, or this wraith of a man making demands on memories Harry does not want to face.
He would have to go about this carefully. If he buggered this … Draco shook his head, not wanting to face that possibility. He looked at Weasley with affection, wanting to thank him somehow but found words utterly inadequate as usual.
‘People do not expect it of me, judging from my appearance,’ he says with a self-deprecating grin that immediately endears him to Harry, ‘but that is the very objective, of course. It suits me, the work there, and I enjoy it well enough. It is quite intellectually stimulating. That is what most of us would like of our work, I should think! You have been to the Department of Mysteries, I understand? Quite an eerie place, is not it? We would like to redecorate it, if we could, but that is very much under the Minister’s purview, unfortunately.’
The window to his father’s study is closed against the cold, but there is no Anti-Eavesdropper Jinx on the window at least. Draco, bringing his head a little above the sill, could listen well enough. He looks ridiculous, of course; people coming to the house will see an overgrown pigeon-boy clinging on the outside walls of Malfoy Manor. But since hardly anybody has paid them a visit in the past two years, he reckons his chances of getting caught are close to none.
The corpses are everywhere: some mangled and crushed by stones or giants, and worse still, those fell by the Killing Curse, pale and still as in sleep. Friends, allies, enemies—death looks the same on everyone. The only difference is how the bodies are treated by the victors: Minnie and Kingsley are quick to put a stop to any desecration of dead Death Eaters.
‘Why not?’ the last man grunts. ‘He’s going to hunt us down, if he’s alive. We need to kill him first—he’s killed the Dark Lord! We don’t know what he can do.’
Narcissa looked at him, chips of cloudless sky set in a worn face. She managed to smile, squeezing his fingers, before she looked away. There was no need for words. Draco sat with his mother in silence, once again lost in his thoughts of potion brewing. Tonight, he would test the seventy-fifth batch of the binding potion. He had made it in a pewter cauldron this time – it
when errant branches catch his robes. Harry leads the way, trying to ignore his grumbling. He feels the other man’s gaze like
He presses a hand against Harry’s bare chest, and Harry is moving before the thought even completes in his mind:
Mrs. Bennet blushes with pleasure at the compliment paid to her daughters, and is hence, secure in the courtesy she pays to the other ladies of the neighbourhood, all of which clumsily functions to flatter her own daughters. Lydia looks increasingly amused as the conversation flows on. Harry is too distracted to attend to it. He is searching for their moving ottoman, which has a pesky tendency to hide itself somewhere in the house. The Bennets have a ward surrounding their estate that warns them when a Muggle enters, but Harry did not have much time to hide the magical items of the house before Lydia let Bingley in.
Ron shrugged, going behind the counter. He took a moment to survey the shop and the well-stocked shelves reaching up to the ceiling. Satisfied, he flicked his wand and the sign at the door flipped over to “Open”. ‘He might just be one of those blokes with intimidating faces.’
Draco shudders, sliding his hand up, along Harry’s neck, thumb pressing into the soft corner of Harry’s lips. The dark-haired man shivers, eyes half-lidded, darkened with longing.
There was a moment of conflict in Luc’s – Malfoy’s – eyes, but then Harry licked his lips, and Malfoy released a shaky breath and nodded. Harry took him in his arms and continued kissing him. Clutching at each other, desperate hands fumbling, they staggered their way out of the kitchen and into the main room. His hands tight on Harry’s hips, Malfoy manoeuvred them towards the beds in the corner.
‘Then we have to kill him now,’ the woman is suggesting. ‘Potter is a liability. We don’t need him to ransom the prince.’
‘Have you been much engaged elsewhere? We have not had the pleasure of the company of the Netherfield party for a while. Bingley dined with us two nights ago, and he informed us that you were away in London for business,’ says Harry.
‘Good afternoon,’ she says in the poshest voice Harry has heard outside of the telly. ‘It has been a while since we last met, cousin.’
‘Very good,’ Ollivander says quietly. ‘I am very excited to see the magic you will create with that wand, Mr Potter. This will certainly be an interesting journey.’
be impossible to prevail on her to marry, until she declares herself quite nauseous with the topic. She drapes herself dramatically over the fainting couch, holding a hand to her forehead.
Draco had ripped aside the curtains, and was trying to undo the catch. The sound of the bustling street of Muggles below was muffled by the warding spells.
the alpha?’ Draco asks. ‘He’s one of the strongest I’ve scented—besides Dumbledore and myself, of course.’
With a sigh, Potter retreated behind the glowing yellow line Draco had conjured between them. Draco took steady, shallow breaths, focusing on the air entering and leaving his lungs. Theo, who was sitting in the chair next to him, watched them with bemusement.
They continued onto Twilfitt and Tatting’s. The robes they eventually bought were even more expensive than the ones at Madam Malkin’s. Mother refused to pay any attention to Draco’s protests. How would it look, she wanted to know, if he
He has dinner with Minnie and Hagrid at the groundskeeper’s hut, laughing at Minnie’s patented exasperation with Hagrid for his smuggling of exotic magical creatures onto Hogwarts grounds. ‘She is a wee beastie, Minerva,’ Hagrid keeps saying. ‘Wouldn’t hurt a fly. You should see her, a wee beastie!’
Draco hesitated then shook his head. ‘No. I can’t tonight. I’m busy. Don’t you have Slughorn’s Christmas party tonight?’
Zabini raised his eyebrows. Goyle and Crabbe exchanged disbelieving looks. Pansy was frowning at him.
, Zabini was wrong, Luna and Luc were wrong. Harry had saved the world, hadn’t he? He was one of the
’—her grin tells him she’s teasing—‘but fate and all that, eh? Can I … have a hug?’ This is the only moment Ginny’s composure falters.
‘No, it’s fine,’ Draco waves him away; it’s far more likely Neville will take his head off in this state. ‘I’m already healing. I have to go after Harry.’
Between a noisy lunch—the girl, Hermione Granger, redeems herself by being a font of knowledge on the intriguing history of Hogwarts; and the boy, Ron Weasley, comes from an enormous family with six other siblings, leading to fascinated questions from the rest, who are the only child in their families—and a tiresome search for Longbottom’s silly toad, they arrive at Hogwarts Station.
Harry ventures to halt his mother’s tirade, when Jane slaps her fork down on the table top and the windows behind her shatter, shards scattering outwards. The entire room falls silent, and Mr. Bennet slowly lowers his book. Every eye is trained upon Jane, whose head is slightly bowed, her fists clenched on her lap.
Minnie ignores his pleading look, turning away to smile at a middle-aged couple that greeted her excitedly in the middle of the street.
Such as now, Draco’s relief, lapping in waves: he is happy to be here with Harry, their hands clasped together, like how they used to when they were younger. Draco’s looks have changed as they grew older: more masculine in the planes of his face, the taper of his wide shoulders to narrow waist, and the strength of his hands. He may wear his blond hair long and flowing, but there is no denying the man he is becoming.
‘I love your father,’ she said. ‘But it is a love borne out of the years we spent together. I was never in love with him and I never will be, so I cannot say I understand the kind of pain you are going through. What I can say is this: forget it. Forget him.
‘I don’t know. It’s hard when you keep me up half the night,’ Draco replied, closing his eyes and leaning into Potter’s hand.
It’s different, walking down Diagon Alley, now that he has a wand in his pocket. The hard little ball of worry in his chest has loosened—just a little bit—and he enjoys his dark-chocolate-and-caramel ice cream happily.
The castle is hectic when Harry and Draco arrive with Narcissa and his godfathers. The last of the evacuees housed here are leaving through the Floo specially opened into the Ministry. People are dashing about, bellowing about fallen walls. The Hogwarts ghosts are adding to the confusion, some of them brandishing bloodied swords.
are told to stay in school. So, they would make sure that school remains the safest place it can be, and if—or when—the attack comes, Hogwarts and its denizens are ready. ‘That means we need to train ourselves too,’ Hermione says determinedly. ‘I’m not good enough at duelling magic. Harry,
"Ginny," another redhead—clearly her brother, also an alpha; Eltanin suspects them to be the infamous Weasleys—snaps. "Some tact would be nice."
but Draco doesn’t know what Harry is begging for, when he is the one who walked away, who decided he does not want a monster for a soulmate after all—even though he
The prophecy ends with a death, and the seer didn’t spare foresight into what comes after. Harry watches Voldemort fall, crumbling into dust, and he doesn’t know how he must feel. Regret must be the wrong emotion here—no one sane regrets that evil has been extinguished—but he regrets the end of the fighting.
These were only social games, he told himself, and his mother had raised him on a diet of meaningless social niceties and searing snubs at her breast. He, the Malfoy heir, could – and would – weather this.
a lot, you know. You are kind and strong and smart. It’s fun playing Quidditch with you. I reckon it would have been fun dating a
‘There!’ Zabini exclaimed, pointing a triumphant finger at Draco. ‘You’re jealous of him because he’s Potter’s friend.’
Harry is not sure how much time has passed in the flurry of wands Ollivander thrusts into his hand—and in some cases, snatches away before he can even give it a wave—but when he looks up in a moment of stillness, he realises that Sirius has gone, and Minnie and Moony are sitting in the corner, drinking tea. They look like they have been sitting there for a while.
—they don’t care what kind of person I am, as long as I look pretty. Sodding hell, I don’t think Robert is even gay!’
Potter was frowning, looking down as he straightened his robes, wiped his mouth. Draco felt a splinter of icy terror. The golden haze of a good snogging session was rapidly receding. Of course: what was he thinking? That Potter was going to continue this after tonight? Potter didn’t want to kiss him in the first place.
Later, with the house quiet in sleep around them, Harry lies in the darkness next to Draco, and asks: ‘Were you scared?’
“And one day, he slipped up. He probably didn’t even notice. He told a particular seller he had learned how to brew the potion out of a book. There aren’t many books with that particular potion recipe. In fact, the only one selling it in London is Flourish & Blotts. And when I went to ask about it today, they couldn’t find it. Theo pretended not to have heard of it, but he was too … too uninterested I suppose.
He cupped Draco’s face, running his thumb over Draco’s cheekbone. ‘Merlin, you look like hippogriff vomit.’
So he had to leave. He had to. It would have to be Draco’s choice. Whatever happens next, Harry wants it to be Draco’s choice.
Draco must have looked offended, because the other boy hastens to add: ‘I don’t mean it in a bad way! You are very …’ He bites his bottom lip, not wanting to offend, but also too shy to say what he means.
He was cowering behind a table turned on its side, the floor beneath it scattered with dented silverware. Voldemort and little Flitwick turned a lethal dance of lurid red and green jets of light in the middle of the hall. Around them, the other dancers eddied, screams and cries echoing off the unseen ceiling and sounding eerily like ecstasy.
son will. If Snape won’t help us …’ She groans, and Draco hears footsteps run across the room, and back again; his mother paces when she is upset. ‘Salazar, will we have to send him to Beauxbatons? I don’t want him so far from us, Lucius!’
Draco straightens, looking at Harry—Wormtail was the man who sold his parents out, and gave his flesh to revive Voldemort—but the dark-haired boy is laughing.
‘We don’t have any omegas in our year, do we?’ Seamus asks, glancing down the Gryffindor table. ‘I hear there’s an omega in Hufflepuff, a second-year.’
There is a hidden alcove behind it, and three people very much engaged in each other’s bodies. One of them—male—moans, ‘Oh, fuck, Zabini, you tart.’ Another voice—female this time—demands, ‘My turn!’
Potter looked ashen. He stared at the Headmaster as if he could not decide to vomit or scream. Draco felt numb, his disbelief lapping at his ice-cold skin. Dumbledore smiled at their reactions.
‘Sit,’ Harry orders, passing a hand over his eyes, wresting control over his emotions. ‘Tell me why you have asked for this meeting.’
‘Another glass of wine for you?’ he asked Hermione. Seeing the reluctant look on her face, he added, ‘Oh, come on. We’re supposed to be celebrating me starting a new journey in life or something like that. It’s still early, the others aren’t even here yet.’
Sarah’s smile dimmed, but didn’t falter. ‘Her name was Danielle, but we usually called her Dani. She was my stepsister – my father, pureblood, married her Muggle mother. Dad was a facilitator for a Ministry-run support group for the parents of Muggle-borns whose magic manifested early – that’s how they met. Dani and I didn’t get along at first; she was very competitive and incredibly brave. But she didn’t stand a chance … she had been on the run with two other Muggle-borns, and she gave up her life to save theirs.’
‘He told me to give you this,’ Snape says curtly, and dumps a vial of swirling memories, a broken locket, and a note into Harry’s hands. He strides away, smelling of fetid lake water and rotting flesh.
The gardens are pretty enough: fat-petaled roses shimmering red, white and champagne against dark green leaves, Flutterby bushes charmed to quiver with pinpricks of gold light, Obcinina flowers humming cheerfully. Draco compliments the gardens, thinking to please Pansy and draw her into a conversation, but she walks silently next to him, her face turned away.
. There are things that I no longer believe in – that I cannot – and that changes the way I behave. And I thought that you saw that – that you
She looked up then and Draco’s breath stopped in his throat. Her eyes were deep and wild with despair. The raw expression on his mother’s face tore a hole in Draco’s chest, ragged and bleeding.
Sirius is sprawled across the floor, his head in Moony’s lap. Moony has a hand on Sirius’s forehead, his back straight and stiff, as he runs his wand up and down Sirius’ body, murmuring a steady stream of spells. Harry stops by the grandfather clock, uncertain. Sirius is groaning. Moony moves a little to the left, and Harry has a clear view of how Sirius looks.
Draco must have looked hurt, because Harry smiled wryly and pressed his lips against Draco’s forehead, a hand on the back of Draco’s head. ‘Don’t pout,’ he said teasingly. ‘I’m saying we should do this properly, with a wedding or a party or something.’ And Draco relented, tilting his head back for a proper kiss.
He paused for a moment outside the Great Hall, listening to the bustle and chatter. Light spilled through the open doorway to the Entrance Hall, where Draco stood in the darkness. The candles in the Entrance Hall weren’t lighting up for him.
He catches Malfoy’s right hand, and presses it between his. Malfoy gasps, and takes half a step back. Harry does not let go. There is heat growing between their palms, and heat in their direct gazes. The other gentleman’s mask slips, and Harry sees the apprehension and disbelief naked on his face.
‘Can’t our hero hold his liquor?’ Luc teased, languidly sipping his drink. His tongue darted out and ran along his lower lip, leaving it shiny in the bright kitchen lights.
‘I—I don’t know. I hope so. I—I died so that the Horcrux in me would too,’ Harry looks down, distressed. ‘But there is another Horcrux, and Voldemort himself. Draco
This last word rings out across the Great Hall, silencing any chatter. When Draco slowly raises the brim of the hat, he sees hundreds of faces slack and gormless with astonishment. Draco himself feels as if he has hit by a Bludger, the sheer force of the Hat’s revelation knocking the wind out of him.
They did nothing but stare at each other for a few long moments. Somewhere, Draco registered that this was wrong. He should never have allowed himself to drink with Potter, and to drink so much. But now it was too late.
Potter made a dissatisfied noise when he finished the article, and stepped away, much to Draco’s relief and disappointment.
‘Your mother is stronger than you think,’ Father says lightly, coming up from behind and placing a large warm hand on Draco’s head. ‘You can embrace as you usually do, my boy.’
They go into the living room, Draco switching the lights on as he went. The lights flicker a bit because Harry is here and the Saviour is, of course, a supremely powerful source of magic.
He glanced at Potter to see how he was taking this. His heart stopped for a moment because Potter was looking straight at Draco, his face raw with fear and disbelief. Draco was abruptly afraid, hands flying to his face. Had he lost an ear?
.’ The yellow light glints on a slim silver crown, set with a sapphire that under his wand flares with blue flame.
All he has left is this dilapidated manor tucked in a forsaken corner of the former kingdom, the seat of a branch of the Black family that died out, half torn down by storms and thieves. He is no longer the alpha prince who took an omega stranger fervently in the darkness like a wretched animal—he has no desire to be.
Moony nods at Harry, telling him to go on. He whispers into Sirius’ ear something Harry doesn’t catch, but causes Sirius to scowl and mutter a curse. Harry trails behind the seamstress, half-aware of her easy prattle, wincing at the heat from his wand. His godfathers follow, Sirius with great reluctance; Minnie is drawn into conversation by a portly wizard.
Harry blanches, Draco’s feelings reaching across their bond. ‘What have I done?’ he whispers, and sees the carnage around them for the first time: the broken dead. ‘
A heavy silence blankets the cottage as the last of the mother’s anguished screams fades. Then: the baby’s piercing cry. In the sitting room downstairs, James Potter leaps to his feet, a half-crazed expression of fear, excitement and apprehension on his face. He glances quickly at the white-haired wizard in the armchair next to him.
to ask you what you were doing with Madam Rosmerta,’ Pansy snapped. ‘You were holed up in the back room with her for ages.’ The Three Broomsticks were their last stop – and where Draco had carried out the most crucial part of his plan successfully.
Those glass-green eyes stared at him. ‘The Dark Lord give me you, I give him the – the – yes, information!’
The pain was dazzling. Draco could not breathe, his mind whited out: the entirety of his being reduced to the searing on his left forearm. As swiftly as the pain seized him, it dissipated into a dull throbbing as the Dark Lord lifted his wand.
Harry scowls, shaking his head. ‘Shut up. I saved us the long trek, didn’t I? I should have just done that from the start. I usually like the walk back, so I didn’t think of it at first – sorry, my bad.’
of course, just herbs they grow themselves, those that are hard to find. That’s why she’s so brilliant at Herbology, always helping me at school.’
The Christmas Ball planning committee were clustered at the end of the Gryffindor table, most of them turning to look when Hagrid and Harry walked in. Harry returned Luna’s welcoming smile before glancing over the rest of the crowd. There were all the professors, of course, including a McGonagall, who was looking particularly forbidding. Out of the students, he only knew Luna, Zabini and Parkinson.
‘Draco knows,’ Ron says, spearing a potato on the end of his fork. ‘He doesn’t care. Rather thinks he likes it. Keeps people away, he said.’
have the choice.’ Ollivander gestures to the two wands on the counter. ‘Which will it be, dear boy? Choose wisely, for I have a feeling it will determine the course of your future.’
Harry does not how much time passes in their corner, but when they finally let go, he is lighter than he has felt in years. He feels as he might flying his broom on a moonless night, the world quiet, and he turns his face towards the stars and feels at peace.
is lost in the ruckus of Neville dashing up the stairs, breathlessly yelling, ‘It’s the snake! Snape sent a Patronus—the last Horcrux is Voldemort’s snake Nagini! We’ve
‘We were trying for the fifth time to find a way out of the castle, to break the siege, for our supplies were desperately low, and there were so many of us sick or injured … The Knights came upon us before we knew it, and Colin was one of the first to fall. I … I knew it was fatal – I was right beside him. He …’ Harry swallows; he cannot falter now. ‘He begged me to save him. He told me not to leave him, because he will be killed, but I … I had to go. I could not … I could not …’
Narcissa had followed him out of the drawing room. He straightened up immediately, turning around to face her. Her face was porcelain-white and taut with concern. She touched his face briefly with her fingertips.
Zabini stood with his wand pointed straight at Draco. His face was hard and expressionless. ‘Tell me,’ he grinded out, ‘you aren’t responsible for Katie Bell’s curse.’
‘Tell anyone,’ Draco said in a quiet, silky voice he learned from his father, ‘and there will be retribution. You know Fenrir Greyback?’ – speaking with the blind bravado his mother taught him – ‘he’s a family friend, he’ll be dropping in from time to time to make sure you’re giving the problem your full attention.’
Disoriented, Draco sat quickly and smashed his head on the bench above. He swore, rubbing the top of his head, scrambling for thought and sense. Potter took a step back and the shadows swept over him. He kept silent, waiting for Draco’s response.
Draco paused, feeling a crack in his heart. He was washing up in Myrtle’s bathroom. He deserved a spot of dinner, he had thought. He stood still and closed his eyes, feeling the warm water gush over his hands. His chest hurt; Salazar, when had it ever stopped hurting since Potter found out he had been drugging him?
Draco froze, wondering if he could just duck into the Room. He realised that would reveal the Room’s location to Filch and sighed deeply. Filch was already pelting up the corridor to him, accompanied by Mrs Norris as always.
Mrs. Bennet is so distressed by Bingley’s departure, her husband dryly comments that it appears it was
whenever they passed him in the corridors of his own manor. Draco told himself he didn’t care, especially when his cock was deep in Jonas’s tight heat and he was coming so hard his mind went blank.
Draco shrugged. He did find Dolores Umbridge a loathsome little troll. The worst thing about her was that she wasn’t breaking any rules and laws, the way she went about tearing Hogwarts down; it was all perfectly legal. Something about the way Umbridge actually enjoyed whatever she had done last year reminded him of Lord Voldemort.
‘What a lovely sentiment,’ Malfoy says. ‘You talk so much about your sisters’ likelihood of marriage, and neglect the commonly held declaration that Mr. Henry Bennet is one of the most eligible bachelors in society.’
Narcissa’s sitting room reflected her personality precisely: creamy white walls with sky-blue floor-length curtains, blue-topped end tables with ornately carved gilded legs, regal armchairs charmed with Cushioning Spells. The paintings were landscapes by a seventeenth-century master – Black heirlooms her parents had given as part of her dowry.
Harry scoffs, but holding his lighted wand in his mouth, begins to climb the rocky slope. The land has been going upwards for a while now. Draco scrambles up easily on all fours, carelessly ripping his robes on branches and rocks. When they emerge at the top in the midst of dense bushes, Harry’s palms are covered in scratches and he has torn a hole in his trousers.
really entails. They had blundered through the encounter with Quirrell and the Philosopher’s Stone somehow; if Harry is meant to kill Voldemort, it’s obvious the people around him will be dragged into worse in the future. One day, he might even have to decide if he can keep his friends.
think, you bloody idiot? It makes me fucking horny and wet and ready to be fucked. Once a month, I lie in bed, too hot beneath the blanket, yearning for my mate, yearning for a hard cock between my legs, but fuck, I only have my hands, and three fingers are not nearly wide enough. What do you
‘Kitty dear, we are very much in the fashion of snagging Muggle husbands in this household these days,’ Lydia says primly, without so much a glance in Jane’s direction.
Draco had only gotten Harry back two years ago. He doesn’t think he can take having Harry so far away, like when he was in France for his Master in Potions. If Harry does want to go away again … Draco wonders how much of himself he will reveal by begging Harry to take him along. Draco will put up with anything for the opportunity to stay by Harry’s side.
Harry watches Draco’s face, whose eyes are closing; Draco has brought his hand up to his cheek, pressing it against his pillow-warm skin.
‘If you don’t hate me, you are going to hate me anyway,’ Malfoy spits out, and he is running towards Harry.
Potter swallowed, the sound audible in the silent room. ‘Hermione. Calm down. Put your wand away. I can explain.’
‘You met Ron and Hermione?’ Harry demands, and then shakes his head. ‘No, that doesn’t matter now. Stop! You are about to collapse, for Godric’s sake – look at you, you berk! You shouldn’t have come after me like this into the forest. Why didn’t you just wait at Hogwarts? I would have come sooner or later.’
Rather pathetic as insults went, but his friends – sans Zabini – laughed dutifully. Weasley went away after sputtering some nonsense, Granger yanking him along.
‘Oh! No, Lizzy is at home. I am with Jane and Kitty – they are no Gryffindors, I am afraid, but every bit as courageous as only a Bennet can be,’ Harry grins. ‘Why, I believe Kitty is
‘Good morning,’ Harry says, stopping at the doorway and rubbing his eyes. ‘Oh, you’ve already made the pancakes.’
He lands a distance in front of her, gripping the broom hard in his hand, staring down. The grass is tufty between his sneakers, and it makes him think of the dead grass on Privet Drive when summer is hottest. Of the taste of scratchy grass and dirt in his mouth, when Dudley and his friends shove him down on the ground. And he is filled with icy-cold fear and certainty that Minnie will send him back now, because Elphie is gone, and she is sad, and Harry has done nothing, but make her angry. His knees nearly buckle beneath him, and he holds on tighter to the broom to remain standing.
‘Oh no, you don’t. You say you are heading for the party? All right, we will check with Professor Slughorn together! Come with me, you little brat.’
‘You have been such a good and obedient boy, I forget that you are only six,’ she says, her voice wavering. ‘I’m sorry, Harry. I will do better from now on. You will never have to fear
Harry closes his eyes, drawing in a deep shuddery breath. ‘Why,’ he asks, ‘are you apologising to me?’ He doesn’t open his eyes, certain he cannot look one more second at Draco’s face without going raving mad.
‘He is here for the diadem, of course,’ Minnie says, when they find her in the middle of the maelstrom in the Great Hall. She holds herself erect, face stern and calm, but her eyes are anxious when she looks at him. ‘We must find it first.’
‘What the fuck?’ the dark-haired boy shouts, twisting his face away, slamming his palms into Draco’s chest. ‘What are you playing at, Malfoy?’
He suppressed a sigh, opening his eyes and returning to a mortifying reality. Jonas reached up and pulled Draco down, murmuring nonsense as he wrapped his arms and legs tightly around Draco. He unfortunately liked to cuddle. Draco lay there, waiting for the German to let go and idly wondering what the man was doing here in Malfoy Manor in the first place, what his business with Lord Voldemort was.
It doesn’t take long for the fire to reignite within him, within them. Harry presses Malfoy into the bed, trailing his lips down the blond’s chest and reducing him to wordless gasps, until the other man swears, he believes that Harry wants him. Harry grins wickedly, and rolls them over, so that Malfoy is on top of him. Placing a hand on the back of his mate’s head, he says, ‘Didn’t you say you are going to help me with this curse, Draco?’
Malfoy wrapped an arm around Harry’s shoulders, twining his legs between Harry’s. ‘Is this what you want?’ he asked, voice hoarse.
When he finished speaking, Draco looked at Harry, realising towards the end that this father he was speaking so glowingly of was, after all, a Death Eater. A murderer who had fled the country rather than deal with the aftermath of their wrong choices. He pulled back a little, waiting for condemnation, holding his breath, suspending hope.
that this man wouldn’t look at you! Are you interested in him? Strange, I thought you like blondes.’ He caught himself, a look of guilt flashing across his face. ‘Bollocks, sorry, Harry, I wasn’t thinking.’
‘I thought you declared yourself incapable of loving a Muggle,’ Lizzy says to Lydia at breakfast the morning after Harry’s visit to Bingley.
She looks up to see the entire common room staring at her in pin-drop silence, and blinks uncertainly, pushing hair out of her face. ‘Do you reckon it’s too much, breaking her quill?’
Draco stands before him, naked and shaking. He is staring down at his bloodied hands. ‘I hurt you,’ he whispers. ‘I hurt
His godfathers and Minnie insist upon Harry go to school. ‘You will complete your education, while you still can,’ Minnie commands. ‘A war doesn’t end in a month—what do you reckon you can for the Order when you are not of age? No, Harry, you will go to school.’
McGonagall had come up to them in the library, while Harry was elsewhere, asking if Ron and Hermione might like to take part in the Second Task. Ron was surprised to be asked to be Harry’s hostage, flicking a look at Draco. McGonagall pretended not to notice, although Draco thought he saw a message in her glance:
The dull pain of casual bullying; the blows Aunt Bellatrix and the other Death Eaters’ would rain down on his body.
“What?” Potter had walked over to pick up the chair, and Draco kept his eyes determinedly away from Potter’s arse.
Harry is staring down at his hand. After a beat, he balls it into a fist and looks up, his eyes sparking with emerald fire. ‘Draco, I’m omega.’
He peers at Eltanin from under his lashes, and what he sees must have assured him, because he manages a small smile, before dropping his gaze. "You think me ugly, don't you? I am not pristine."
There was a war that lasted twenty years: the kingdom of Slytherin marched to establish their dominance over the other kingdoms and principalities in the realm. "
Granger and Weasley were yelling. There were other voices in the corridor now. Hands grabbed Draco, hauling him back. He blinked through his sweaty fringe, staring across the no-man’s land at Potter, who was swearing angrily, struggling to break free of Weasley and Finnigan’s hands.
‘All right, all right,’ he says desperately, ‘if you will go, at least let me stay with you until the Dark Lord has been killed. Let me protect you for the time being. Let me do this one thing—please, I’m begging you. You
Potter returned his grin and began to undress, flinging his robes and shirt off without pausing. Draco drank in the sight of Potter’s lean Seeker body, his long, strong arms, his lightly sculpted chest. Potter visibly shuddered when he caught the look on Draco’s face.
True enough, the rest of Dumbledore’s Army – including a stiff Ginny – filed into the Hog’s Head, forcing some of her shadowy patrons to flee at the sight of so many of the war’s heroes in one place. Amidst the happy ‘I haven’t seen you in
Yaxley, Greyback and the Carrows tumbled out behind Snape. Yaxley seized Draco immediately. He shook him roughly, sending Draco’s teeth clacking in his head.
Harry doesn’t resist. He pushes the plates between them aside, shifts over and wraps his arms around Draco. Draco gasps audibly, his head turning slightly and stopping just before he looks at Harry straight to the face. Harry exhales. So this is what it feels like to hold Draco, to feel his body thin and warm and trembling against his chest. To have elation swooping through him and terror cramping his stomach at the same time, because he mustn’t –
Harry has never seen Dumbledore look so uncomfortable – or abashed. The old wizard stands in the doorway to the kitchen, his face deeply creased with worry lines. Harry, Sirius and Moony turn as one to look at Minnie, who has paused in the midst of putting a piece of potato in her mouth.
A heavy silence blankets the cottage as the last of the mother’s anguished screams fades. Then: the baby’s piercing cry. In the sitting room downstairs, James Potter leaps to his feet, with a half-crazed expression of fear and exhilaration. He shoots a look at the white-haired wizard in the armchair.
‘Ah! Ah, what’s this? Merlin, yes, you are a Veela, aren’t you? Well, your mind isn’t so different from a wizard’s, you know. Ah, and this soul-bond of yours –’
“Granger, I am very sorry for the things I’ve called you. You are a brilliant witch, the cleverest in our year, and you are more talented than the rest of us put together. You are a better witch than I could ever be – and –” Draco stopped abruptly because he
‘Well, we would not know, would we?’ Jane says gently. ‘I have noticed that the gentleman is close-lipped of his achievements, which is quite proper.’
She looks at him with some surprise. ‘I thank you for sharing your opinion, Mr. Darcy,’ she says, and firmly turns back to Zabini, who is hiding a smirk behind his napkin.
‘How do you pull successfully,’ he says musingly. ‘It’s all about confidence, isn’t it? You’re quite good-looking yourself, Potter, even if you don’t realise it. Why do you think Malfoy didn’t care to deny the rumours of you two being a couple?’
“Yes,” Harry looked miserable, his hands dropped to his side. “I’ll – I’ll floo Ron. Have him take over.”
as good as the day you were turned into a ferret,” he chuckled. “Malfoy, the past is past. If I had continued to hold our Hogwarts days against you, I would not have agreed to take on your case, no matter how many biscuits Harry tried to bribe me with.”
‘Marking you,’ the dark man says calmly, looking down at his thumb. ‘Hmm … that was an interesting reaction. You felt that too, didn’t you?’
He brushes Draco’s tears away with his thumbs, and presses his lips against Draco’s. They are warm and soft and ignite a frisson of heat in Harry’s chest. He shivers, pulling away. Draco smirks, and slips his arms around Harry’s waist, pulling him flush against his chest.
‘No, wait, it couldn’t have been Draco,’ Hermione hisses. ‘Don’t you see—he was protecting Harry! They were all trying to attack him. Harry!
A rather tensed silence settles in their compartment. Harry, for his part, is examining Draco as closely. Neville is looking nervously between the two of them. They can hear movement and laughter in the other compartments. Other students are walking down the corridor outside, a few looking in curiously, taking double takes when they catch sight of Draco.
Harry looked up and smirked to see the need written clear across Malfoy’s borrowed face. ‘No need to be so rude.’ Without further warning, he dipped his head and wrapped his mouth around the head.
. He is glaring at Harry, eyes so full of animosity and resentment that Harry feels it like a punch to his guts.
Potter dropped his hand in disgust. He shook his head. ‘I’m only trying to help you, Malfoy. If you would just tell me that you are a Death Eater, what you’re doing, I could –’
Draco turned the corner and Potter was there. The dark-haired boy strode up to him, eyes hard and gleaming as emeralds, seized him by his wrist and yanked him behind a tapestry. They went through the wall and into a dark stairwell. Potter shoved Draco against the wall and kissed him hungrily. Draco dropped his things and wrapped his arms around Potter, pressing back against Potter just as roughly.
Weasley gawped at him, looking so familiarly gormless Draco was tempted to snip out an insult. Then he gave Draco a surprising grin.
Snape declares that Voldemort’s grime has been removed from Harry, and leaves when he sees he is no longer required. McGonagall stays with them in the common room, Hermione and the others dropping into the armchairs around where Draco and Harry are huddled on a couch. Dumbledore is already gone.
Lucas Norton looked as if he could hear the shrieks of a thousand Augureys. He took a half step back from Harry, face pale and drawn. Behind him, Zabini was incensed. He was about to move forward when Goyle grabbed his arm and shook his head. Harry couldn’t decipher the expression on the flat, broad face.
He glances up from his mug. The other man is studying his mug, turning it around and around in his hands. Well, he is clearly not planning to make it easy for Harry. Harry opens his mouth – to make a desultory comment about the cold weather, to ask if Draco is warm enough; but Draco gets to the Snitch before him.
‘Yeah, like you’d dare do magic out of school,’ Draco sneered. ‘Who blacked your eye, Granger? I want to send them flowers.’
A laughable sentiment, when he sits here in the hospital wing, skinny arms wrapped around knobbly knees. Draco is fidgeting, glancing over his shoulder at Madam Pomfrey’s office. Finally, he seems to decide to stay, dropping heavily into the chair by Harry’s bed.
It soon comes to the ball at Netherfield Park Bingley has long promised to hold. Lydia had accousted him with the notion a month ago, and the gentleman readily agreed, no doubt persuaded by Jane’s gaze upon him. The neighbourhood speaks of nothing else for the week prior to the ball, and the shops enjoy a healthy patronage. Harry is driven nearly to madness by his sisters’ – including Jane and Lizzy – fussing over their attire, and seeks refuge with Ron and Hermione, who laugh at his predicament.
Minnie inhales sharply. She stands before him, a towering, silent figure. He keeps his eyes to the ground, the hairs on the back of his neck prickling. His eyes are burning, but he mustn’t blink. She finally speaks, her voice taut.
“We were there, you know,” she said. “We saw how you didn’t give Harry up. You were just as much as a scared child as the rest of us, and you dealt with it the way you had been raised to. After the childhood you had … it is infinitely more difficult to change yourself than to stick to what you know … You are forgiven, Malfoy.”
‘You’ve brought me back from the dead, Malfoy,’ Potter says in a low voice, the words flaying Draco open. ‘And you are going to pay for it.’
Stupid question; he knows the answer to that. In the rise and fall of kingdoms, the only certainty is the eradication of all threats, hinted or otherwise. In his panic, he thought the Gryffindors were here to use his omega against him. He wants to laugh at how wrong he was: the omega is here to use his army against him. Gryffindor is an unforgiving nemesis.
The wandmaker reappears with two wand boxes. He hesitates for a moment, glancing between the two boxes, before handing Harry the left one. ‘Go on. Try that one. Give it a wave,’ he urges.
‘I’m doing great,’ he announced, the alcohol buzzing hot in his blood, the thrum of his heartbeat loud in his ears. ‘You’re looking bloody fantastic, Luna!’
When he had regained his composure, Draco straightened up and said to the silent, impassive man, “We should go. I wouldn’t want to keep my aunt waiting.”
As if it isn’t unfair enough that alphas are usually more powerful and stronger than betas or omegas, alphas exude pheromones that unwittingly draw people towards them. Voldemort was an alpha who took clear advantage of his powers. Harry doesn’t feel the effects thanks to the suppression potion, which not only masks his omega nature, but also deadens his awareness of other genders.
“Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,” Draco was muttering, rubbing his hands over his face and feeling utterly wretched because his mouth tasted foul, and he had
Draco must have seen it on his face after all. He knows Harry thinks him beautiful—like everyone who meets him, like the lust-addled sods desperate to impress the Veela mascots of the Bulgarian National Team. But Harry doesn’t want Draco like
, Draco thinks fiercely. No one will take Harry Potter, when Draco Malfoy is next to him. And when he kills Voldemort so that he wouldn’t hurt Harry, Draco would also savour the sweetness of vengeance for Father’s death.
Madam Malkin, caught in the middle, retreated to the familiar territory of being a saleswoman. She bent over Draco’s left arm, murmuring, ‘I think this left sleeve could come up a little bit more, dear, let me just –’
Salazar, capital city of Slytherin, was by the sea: white-walled, blue dome-roofed houses terraced into the rolling brown hills, clustered around mosaic-floored courtyards with fountains glittering in the sun. Eltanin watched the city—and the palace built by his ancestors rising like gilded clouds at the top of the hill—burn down at the hands of Gryffindor soldiers.
Halfway through their journey, they are joined by a Muggle-born first-year with bushy brown hair and an overbearing bossy demeanour. She is dragging two boys – an apologetic-looking plump boy and a bewildered redhead – with her, saying that they are looking for Neville’s – the plump boy’s – lost toad. Draco is inclined to ignore her, but Potter is absurdly kind.
‘This is the danger of loving heroes,’ Draco declares, his face serious. ‘Your kind is always apt to believe you must save everyone – and continue saving them. I will tell you now that your work saving
‘Look at me, Malfoy! At least have the decency to look at me as you reject me!’ Potter’s voice cracks. ‘You push me away even if you know you’d die. You hate the idea of being with me forever that much, Draco?’
‘He was human, married to a beta woman. They had a child together.’ Mathis’s words are clinical, cold now. ‘He loved them, and he was happy with them, but once we met … well, you know the pull of a soulmate. He
to school to learn those then?’ Sirius laughed, ruffling Harry’s hair. ‘Moony, this is entirely your influence. I take no responsibility for the scholar our boy has become.’
‘Stop it,’ Draco’s voice came out sharper than he intended. ‘I promise you, Potter, that you cannot help me.’
What thoughts was he trying to conceal from the Dark Lord? Oh, if Snape only knew, the truth would destroy him and Draco would laugh to see it. He couldn’t figure out why Dumbledore trusted him. Just look at the bloke; every inch of him screamed
Draco was sitting on the edge of his bed, his arms wrapped tightly around himself. He jerked when his aunt entered his room. Mother came in behind her, her regal face pale and drawn. Their eyes met and Draco felt her despair reach for him across the room, cold and clammy.
The other boy pauses in the middle of his story about a lemon meringue tart his mother used to make for his birthdays, and looks at him, a little surprised. ‘You are not going to ask me if you can interrupt me, are you? Because I would hex you.’
They fled through never-ending corridors and down endless flights of stairs. Screams and shouts echoed through the school. Draco struggled to breathe through burning lungs, praying that he wouldn’t trip, pleading for everything to
Harry stands by the stove, hands threaded behind his back. He stiffens when Draco returns his gaze to him. He could never have imagined this: Draco in his cottage, clutching around him Harry’s thick, red blanket. The scenario where Draco is with him outside of Azkaban – that could only have been a daydream. Harry refused to dream for such impossible things.
If Filch was Dumbledore’s hire, the Headmaster was kind to the point of cruelty. It would have been so much better to turn Filch away, to force him into the Muggle world, where he might be happier – or no, that might be a cruelty as well, being forced out of the world he was born into. Draco shuddered, grateful for a moment to be a proper pureblood wizard.
A hole opened up in his chest and he felt he was being eaten up alive. Fantasies, fucking stupid, fucking hopeless fantasies, because magic couldn’t solve all the problems in the world, not even a wizard as great as Dumbledore. Voldemort had bound Draco up in his servitude so securely that he knew there was no escape but death – and Draco wanted to live, desperately.
‘Draco,’ the high, cold voice said and Draco’s mingled fear and exhaustion and rage and disappointment tangled and snapped, leaving him empty and frozen.
Ron groaned, and chucked a cushion at Harry. ‘Bloody hell, Harry! I bet that you would make the first move. Why in Merlin’s pants were you dragging your feet for?’
‘Oh, it does, of course, it does, sir,’ Borgin said quickly, attracted by the scent of a potential sale. ‘And as a working Cabinet, it will not be cheap, oh no, it won’t, but of course, for
She lets go of him, and begins running down the path, her footsteps thudding in the abrupt silence that falls in their part of the gardens. Draco should be able to catch up to her in no time, because he can run faster – and is stronger – than any human child can hope to be, but he hears the words,
The first-years gather in front of the teachers’ table, huddled around a stool topped with a worn, rumpled wizard’s hat. Draco finds himself right next to Potter, close enough for their sleeves to brush, which is why he is the only one who notices when Potter grimaces, his hand flying to his temple. The dark-haired boy looks up sharply, his troubled eyes scanning the teachers’ table and stopping on a skinny man with straggly greasy hair. Draco can guess who that professor is – Snape, the ingrate who turned his back on Draco’s parents.
Draco crossed his legs, tapping his fingers on the cover of his book. ‘I don’t understand. Was that supposed to be insulting? At least Potter’s cock is clean and big and tastes good. More than I can say about
Light was a cooling balm all over him, waves and waves of icy comfort. He scrabbled at his face, and tore away the blanket; he drew a deep breath of air that rattled his lungs.
‘Yes, Professor, but I would like to have a little more time to mentally prepare myself for the experience,’ Draco says very seriously; that is a silly excuse no one will believe, but how can Draco explain his certainty that he must go after Potter, because he must make certain that they are in the same House?
What better evidence, Harry wanted to scream at them, than Cedric Diggory’s dead body? Than his parents’ howl of despair at the sight of his broken son? Minnie told him to be patient, even though she would very much like to hex the living daylights out of their chief interrogator, a woman named Umbridge who isn’t even an Auror. Sirius said she is the Minister for Magic’s stooge, that it doesn’t matter, because enough people high in the Ministry are paying attention to Dumbledore.
‘I’m afraid our conversation does not interest the children,’ Mother says to the other ladies, nodding at Draco and Pansy with a benevolent smile. ‘Rose, what do you say to Pansy taking Draco on a tour of your lovely gardens? I think there would be enough there to entertain the children and keep them out of our hair.’
Harry takes a step back, his legs hitting the stool, and he collapses into a slump, holding back the hysterical laughter bubbling at his lips. He raises a shaking hand to his eyes. ‘
, and how little he deserved any of it. He was simply unable to express it in an appropriate manner that did not involve declaring his undying love.
Draco steps forward, snapping his wings open, claws extended. The Death Eaters raise their wands as one, and Harry grabs his arm. Voldemort grins with genuine amusement now, glancing around at his silent audience—even the beasts are listening with open mouths.
“No, I’m sure she would rather not have me,” he said. “My mother had, after all, completely cut her off, and the Second War did not made a difference.”
Potter sighed. ‘Bloody hell, you’re not allowed to hold anything I say against me, all right? Yes, yes, I miss playing against you. It’s so much more fun when I win against you and see that look on your face. It’s so
‘I’m not smirking,’ Harry replies mildly, pursing his lips; he must have smiled unconsciously, thinking that Malfoy looks rather lovely really, with his eyes sparking with anger and his cheeks flushed.
‘I am sure she would not mind at all,’ Harry says with no certainty that is the case. ‘She does like to be consulted, our Mary.’
Zabini found him in the Southern Courtyard, where Draco liked to go when it weren’t so crowded like today, when most of Hogwarts were down in Hogsmeade. A branch cracked above his head, tumbling to the ground and sending leaves scattering across his homework. Calmly, he brushed the desiccated leaves off his parchment and looked up.
Draco laughs and Harry turns. Harry is grinning, his eyes avid on Draco’s face, lingering on his mouth. As Draco’s laughter fades away, the silence gains strength, a storm gathering breath.
Regulus turns to him, glancing over his shoulder nervously. ‘I brought us into another underworld. It’s only temporary before someone comes and kicks us out; the other one isn’t full yet, you see.
Harry stares, and he smiles with overt relief, the ice in his mind thawing just a little. ‘I know. I love you too. Now and forever, I reckon, mate.’
‘It is good that you wizards are so eager to raise our children,’ his mate says, not unkindly. ‘To be sure, some Veelas take very well to child-rearing, but … this child will not be easy to raise. He is an alpha, and alpha Veelas nearly always have a soulmate. That hardly bodes well for Veelas.’
worse now. He clenches his teeth, taking shallow breaths through his nose, but Salazar, he can still taste it: teeth-achingly sweet caramel oozing down his throat.
Draco doesn’t want to date Harry, doesn’t think about kissing him—or, Merlin forbid, mating with him—because it disgusts him. It feels like a betrayal to reduce their friendship to carnal desires and actions. He would not do it, would not corrupt the trust and affection between them with sexual desire. So, they mustn’t talk about being bonded, even if they think the other does know.
It was only once he was in the living room, comfortably ensconced at one end of an old sofa, that he remembered the near-kiss this evening. Being alone with Potter under the influence of alcohol was a
He focusses on the Triwizard Tournament, on perfecting his potion, on any news about Death Eaters and Voldemort. After all, the prophecy tells him the greatest task in his life is to slay the Dark Lord; it doesn’t say he has any business falling in love.
Draco had insisted on having one of his friends present during the interview, because he knew he would rather die under the Cruciatus Curse than have one of them see him throw himself at Potter. He had also insisted Potter stayed a minimum of three meters away. He had wanted ten meters, but Healer Mitra’s office wasn’t big.
Potter sat at the head of the table, eyeing him. Weasley was sitting to his left, happily munching on a plate of biscuits. Granger set down her cup of tea, and smiled blandly at Draco.
! Harry cannot tell how Regulus knows to stop, but when he does, they are alone on the beach, and people have vanished along the bend. He feels that they ought to be catching their breaths, but there is no difference from standing or running in this place.
‘I’m sorry,’ Draco finally blurts. ‘Ginny’s scent is still all around you, and I only saw the top of Ron’s head, so I thought—I made an assumption. I’m sorry. I know you wouldn’t—’ He stops, frowning uncertainly.
Veelas have the ability to heal without the need for spells or potions. Draco found out about this very early on, because Harry has the unfortunate habit of getting himself hurt – and it was during the war that Draco realised that his healing magic always works best on Harry. For once, this is an effect of their bond that he is grateful for. Harry heals more quickly than Draco expected; perhaps it’s the result of what Draco has set in motion with the kiss.
Eltanin closes a hand around a strong wrist, the skin warm to the touch, and his palm tingles, a sense of
After she had gone, he lay in bed, drowsy but determined to cling onto wakefulness if just for a little while more. He would come, wouldn’t he? He would … Draco saw again Potter’s face, devastated by the truth of what he had done, and he forced himself awake.
That is the only warning they receive. Nagini lunges at Draco, her thick black body spiralling through the air. He instinctively raises his hand, crying out when her fangs sink into his arm. Harry twists, wand raised, but Voldemort leaps forward, and Harry is forced to cast a Shield around himself instead.
‘No! No, I didn’t. I don’t,’ Draco says hotly. ‘I wanted to be friends, that’s why I said yes. And I want to help you because we’re
So he’s said it. He didn’t think he would say it quite like this. He had imagined a quiet night in the kitchens, and he would ask the elves to prepare Draco’s favourite dishes – toad-in-a-hole, shepherd’s pie, and of course, apple cake – and he would set the table with a fancy tablecloth and a candle, and he would finally ask the right question – the one he should have asked months ago.
Harry doesn’t tell them that it’s the other way round for Malfoy and him, because well, they don’t know about the night of last year’s Anniversary Ball at the palace. He doesn't think about the night much really—except when he happens to read the gossip rags that like to carry news on the Crown Prince’s dating exploits every other day. He doesn’t tell his best mates too, that they needn’t worry about his sleeping with Malfoy; Malfoy seems to like his men tall, elegant and of noble blood.
Draco paused in the midst of unpacking his pyjamas. ‘What do you want, Zabini?’ he asked wearily. ‘Can this wait? I’m knackered.’
‘The point is … The point is that I deserved what came to me, I deserved everything I got because the things I thought, the – the ideology I supported – it’s evil and
The pitying look the Veela gave him told him that he was a Veela now, and Veelas could not choose their Heart’s Desires. Besides, he knew he had made the choice to love Potter long before this disaster happened.
When Harry looks at Malfoy, he has to clench his fists to resist the urge to touch him. He wants to, badly, but he mustn’t, because there is a part of Malfoy who still doesn’t want to be touched by him. He’s trying his best, until he simply doesn’t know what to do anymore – and he snapped. He wishes he hadn’t, that he could have held the words back – be a better person than he really is. He wonders if Malfoy might like him better then.
‘What –’ he is cut off when the Apparition takes hold of them, and they are knocking into each other, bodies stretching and twisting through the squeeze of magical teleportation.
‘Such a pretty little boy,’ a man’s guttural whisper pushes against his ear, his breath carrying the stench of onions. ‘I’m going to take you.’
Harry looked up in alarm at her words, more struck by her tone—which usually meant he was in trouble—than what she was saying.
Potter cleared his throat and took out his wand. Draco whipped around, wand held at the ready. The other boy ignored him, moving past him to the closest stack of desks. He levitated a few desks down to the ground and began murmuring cleaning and repairing spells. Draco didn’t move, watching Potter warily.
Potter must have perceived Draco’s insanity the way a prey instinctively knows a predator because he jerked away, eyes now filled with a different kind of terror. A knife twisted in Draco’s chest, driven in by this act of rejection. He didn’t want Potter scared of him.
Nobody answered him. Everybody was watching as Dumbledore’s body was blasted clear over the ramparts, sailing through the air and disappearing into the darkness beyond. Draco had seen the dead blue eyes, no longer twinkling like the stars above. For a desperate moment, he hoped that the tales of a soul being a star upon death were true so at least, Dumbledore – the great man that he was, quite annoying, but great nonetheless – was on his way to somewhere beautiful.
So his plan to kill Dumbledore with a cursed necklace had failed. Morgana’s tits, after he had taken all the trouble to buy the dratted thing too. It was unfortunate about Bell and that Potter had seen it happen.
All this while, Potter stared intensely at Draco. The feel of his eyes crawled over Draco’s skin, as tangible as Potter’s fingers on him. Draco clenched his fists, and was about to tell him to stop it when Potter blurted, “What about me?”
Draco recoils, smarting from Harry’s stinging words—the injustice, the assumptions—and the words tumble uncontrollably out of his mouth. ‘People will think
Draco opened his eyes a crack. He loved watching Potter dress, loved the way his back muscles slid and flexed under his smooth skin. He reached out, pressing a hand against Potter’s back. Potter looked over his shoulder and grinned cheekily. He bent over to drop a quick kiss on Draco’s lips.
Any attention Draco will get for his family’s poor reputation pales in comparison to the maelstrom awaiting Harry Potter’s re-entry into the wizarding world – Draco supposes he should thank Harry Potter for that.
Albus Dumbledore tilts his head, listening, and soon enough, they hear Lily Potter’s laughter and the midwife’s soft murmuring response. Albus nods, and James flies across the small room and thunders up the stairs. The sound of the young father’s joyful and effusive greeting echoes throughout the house, joined by his wife’s teasing admonishment to
Harry smiles weakly; Merlin, how are his friends so good at reading him even across the distance? He nods. ‘All right … but …’ He hesitates, wondering what right he has to dare
“Your assailant threw a modified Angel’s Trumpet Draught onto you. You know what it does? Yes. When imbibed, it leads to a painful but swift death. The one thrown at you was modified to be effective upon contact on skin. When Mr Potter brought you to St Mungo’s, much of your skin and bones had been dissolved. In effect, your body was destroyed.”
Draco straightens hopefully, and beams at Mrs Parkinson when she glances at him. She agrees immediately, a little dazzled, and tells her sulky daughter to be a good host to Draco. Draco jumps to his feet, smirking at his mother, who tells him to
Slowly, slowly, it looks up at Draco. There is awareness in those green eyes, and a dawning horror creasing its soil-encrusted face.
When he painted the last rune in blood, the world exploded with a wave of black light that blasted Draco into the arms of his statue saviour. He would be dead if it weren’t for the ancients’ ostentatious use of magic to honour their deceased.
‘Mother’s being presumptuous,’ Draco says hastily, grabbing the ring and stuffing it into his pocket. ‘It’s only effective if you enter your name in the family registry, so this is merely a token. You don’t need to think too much about it.’
‘You don’t have to apologise,’ Harry forced a grin. ‘I do like blondes. I should go. Saturdays are your busiest days, aren’t they? Say hi to George and Kate for me.’
Nothing moves. Those that could has already crawled from the carnage, and whimpers of pain grow fainter as the dying fade away. Draco doesn’t sense anymore enemies. He falls to his knees, wiping his bloodied claws best as he can on the ground, but everywhere is soaked with gore anyway.
Over the next few days, Draco’s life with Potter settled into a strangely comfortable rhythm. They would have breakfast together in the morning with careful conversation. After that first night, Potter avoided personal topics, and stuck to polite questions about how Draco liked his food and Ollivander’s.
During lunch one day, Theo looked at him with a knowing expression that sent dread twisting in Draco’s guts.
A slight movement caught Draco’s eye and he saw Potter, Weasley and Granger reflected in the mirror. Weasley was wearing his usual gormless look, face screwed up in distaste. Granger grimaced slightly, glancing at Potter. She had a black eye and looked utterly absurd.
‘I know that, you git. I mean, what does that have to do with dating, since people believe you’re beta anyway?’
Weasley shrugged. “More like it doesn’t matter anymore. It has been five years. I don’t need extra bullshit in my life, mate. I’d rather forget it.”
Draco shakes his head, amused. ‘No, Mother doesn’t make mistakes like that. You could write her to ask, but she might take it as an insult. It’s not like we can’t afford to give it to you.’
The other man leans in close, a dark scowl on his face. He is so close that every word he speaks pushes out against Draco’s lips as a breath. ‘Do you mean to say that you are pushing me away because you’ve put me on a pedestal? Because somehow, you fucking think that I’m what,
He was vaguely aware of collapsing to the ground, of a high-pitched keening from his mouth. The unnatural silence that had clamped down on Diagon Alley imploded, and people were panicking.
Harry is thoroughly robbed of words. He furiously berates himself for once more displaying ghastly thoughtlessness. Now that he knows Malfoy a little better and discovers to his surprise that the gentleman could be cordial, he is genuine in his desire not to offend, especially when they have inadvertently been thrown together as frequently as they have been. It is naturally easy enough for Harry to be pleasant to Malfoy, when they determinedly keep away from all topics that could lead to mention of the war. Harry has quite shattered the fragile peace between them.
Stretching, rubbing his sore neck, he cast a quick Tempus spell. 10pm, so Potter would still be at Slughorn’s party. Draco’s stomach rumbled. A quick bite, and he could be back here in half an hour. Perhaps if he finished early, Potter could still be waiting for him.
‘Mr. Darcy, I hope you will not be disappointed to find that I might just be a bigger minx than Lydia,’ she says mischievously.
Seeing the strained look on Luc’s face, Harry rather suspected she had similarly coerced him into coming.
Malfoy stomps his foot down on the ottoman, attracting the attention of the entire room. ‘My legs are quite exhausted. Would you be so kind as to grant me the liberty of lifting my legs, Mrs. Bennet?’ he asks with nary a change in his cool, blank façade.
Sirius is sprawled across the floor, his head in Moony’s lap. Moony has a hand on Sirius’s forehead, his back straight and stiff, as he runs his wand up and down Sirius’ body, murmuring a steady stream of spells. Harry stops by the grandfather clock, uncertain. Sirius is groaning. Moony moves a little to the left, and Harry has a clear view of how Sirius looks.
‘I’m afraid you must make the choice, Harry,’ he says gently. ‘But it will be the right choice, no matter what.’
His shoulders. Draco feels it as well, the sharp pain stabbing his shoulders. He looks down, and realises that the shoulders of Harry’s blue sweater are dark with blood. He has never hated himself more than this moment; he feels as if he may just vomit. He swallows.
Somehow, he found himself back in his seat, listening to Granger talk about her work as Potter walked around in the background, an appallingly stained apron tied around his waist. Despite Draco’s efforts in learning about Granger’s work for the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, the sight of Potter in jeans distracted him.
Harry returns his nod, abruptly uneasy with Zabini’s smile. Still, the other gentleman does not appear deigned to approach him, and Harry leaves the shop. He Disapparates back to the Gardiners’ house to see Jane alone in the drawing room. She looks up from the potted plant she is pruning when he enters, a smile ready on her face. Her smile disappears when she takes in his swollen, reddened eyes.
The other boys wake, lights snapping on, sleepy voices calling out, ‘Sirius? What’s happened to Sirius?’
Draco suppressed a grimace. Merlin, what a waste of a night. Snape was frowning at him; Draco had managed so well to avoid him for so long. The only upside to this was perhaps Potter might be amenable to sneaking out early.
He sat down next to her, feeling extraordinarily grateful. As Granger asked him about his work, he told her willingly about the wandlore he was learning. She probably already knew all about the historical use of a favourite pet’s hair for a wand core, but she listened obligingly. Weasley chipped in with a story about an uncle with a wand core he had insisted was troll nose hair.
He leaned back in his seat, drinking his beer slowly, listening to Ron and Hermione chatter as they waited for the rest to arrive. Around them, the Hog’s Head was quiet, Aberforth somewhere in the back rooms. Harry ignored the furtive activity in the shadows. He wasn’t an Auror at the moment; just a regular bloke meeting old schoolmates for a catch-up.
She closed her eyes, smiling. ‘When you were seven. Your father was furious. You threw tantrums for a week, demanding a dragon for a pet.’
Harry shakes his head, laughing. It seems that Zabini speaks more often in jest than not, a manner that is amusing enough when one has the appetite to encourage him. As is proper, they take no more than two dances, and step aside to pursue their conversation further. With great flair and dramatics, Zabini tells Harry about the commissions he has been sent on by his mother. Lady Zabini is a famed portrait artist constantly in search for interesting individuals to sit for her.
‘It’s about the Dark Lord,’ the other boy whispers, eyes hardening into stone. He nods decisively, and pulls his chair closer, their hands still clasped together on the bed by Harry’s hip. ‘Tell me everything.’
‘Great!’ Potter breaks into a sudden grin, one of those blindingly genuine grins that cut Draco like a knife.
. The lights are flickering on throughout the cottage, small and cosy with dark wood furniture and embroidered upholstery—and Harry’s warm caramel scent. The omega stops in the sitting room, a fire flickering in the hearth, and turns to face Draco. There is a hint of sour embarrassment on his scent now. Draco frowns, cocking his head.
“I might have agreed, you know,” Draco informed primly, moving behind the counter to tidy up the records.
‘Yes, well, as you can see, you have nothing to worry about,’ Jackson chided; he sounded petulant. ‘You really needn’t go to the Dark Lord for this. Now you can tell him there is nothing to worry about and the experiments are going well.’
Harry was on his broom before he realised that there would be consequences, but he thought of Malfoy standing in the middle of the courtroom, face pale and desperate and terrified, like the reflection Harry saw in the boys’ bathroom in sixth year. He flew on: over the black waves frothing against black rocks and through the wards erected around the prison island, safely concealed by his Invisibility Cloak. Aurors guarded Azkaban now, after Kingsley’s reforms, but spells would not work on Harry’s cloak.
Draco’s voice is pitched lower than usual, and rougher, like Firewhiskey and smoke. Harry thinks of oak, screeching and splitting in the roar of all-consuming Fiendfyre – and thin arms desperately wrapped around him, hot breath rasping in his ear, lips grazing his neck.
; she cannot bear to take her eyes off him for a second. Tears spill down her cheeks, her chest tight with immense amazement and bewilderment.
Reluctantly, Zabini let it go, although the glare he shot Draco promised further interrogation. Pansy took a look at Draco’s closed-off face and sighed, knowing that she would get nowhere with him. She dropped his hand to reach up for her trunk.
‘You always put it so crudely, like it’s all about sex, but it isn’t … the thing between us … it isn’t, is it?’
The loss of his mate is inconsequential, compared to Voldemort ripping the throne from under him; Voldemort marching Slytherin to war, first against their traditional enemies the Gryffindors, and then to the rest of the realm; Voldemort wasting lives in the war, laying the kingdom to waste.
in his eyes, that look of stupid worship, and Harry was only too willing to let Malfoy take him all the way.
Slightly more bearable: spiralling out, down his arms and legs, scratches he inflicted on himself in his sleep, trying to get at the constant
– at the end of the lessons, it was Potter who won it. His jaw clenched so tightly it hurt, Draco watched a smug Potter took the little bottle of liquid luck.
‘Assembly rooms. Dinner parties. Balls,’ Harry pauses, and takes an exaggerated glance around the quiet room. ‘Drawing rooms.’
‘I heard what you did—we are naturally interested in all news about our kind. They call you a hero and monster in the same breath …’ Mathis is still speaking carefully. ‘But it makes sense, when we see you: you have a mate. It is Harry Potter, is it not? He almost died in the war. A threat to one’s mate would drive any Veela mad, especially an alpha like you.’
Potter; wanted to claim him for its own; wanted to devour him whole, rip into his skin and flesh, crack his bones and suck the marrow. Draco craved to possess Harry Potter and if he couldn’t have him, no one else should.
"Pristine?" Eltanin echoes. The flash of his anger shocks him: he feels his sanity and reason unravelling with fury, his control fraying at the edges. There is a fog drawing close around his mind; nearly the same from that night under the stars, except this time, he is misty with rage.
‘She was one of the smartest in our year,’ he says. ‘I have wondered how she was doing. She is living in London as well, is she? Would she consider it impertinent if I would like to call on her one day? It will be lovely to hear her views on an experiment I am thinking of.’
Ignoring that last muttered remark, Granger asked, “So what are the two main ingredients used in the potion?”
‘Luc is the name he prefers to go by at the meantime. I’m afraid you would have to ask him what his full name is,’ Luna said, looking up at him, her pale eyes filled with sympathy for a reason obvious only to her.
On the second morning, Draco skipped right past the main pages to the entertainment section; he did not wanted to be caught reading Potter news. He was halfway through the gossip column (by Rita Skeeter, of course) before he realised it was about Potter.
After they found him in the dead man’s house two years ago, his parents’ friends sent less dinner and party invites and in turn, accepted less of the Malfoys’ invitations. Father is rather sanguine about it.
A long night of experiments that failed, the potion destabilising no matter how Harry adjusted the amount of yarrowroot. Tears of frustration at the corners of his eyes, he flopped to the floor, thrusting his hands through his unruly hair, his mouth tasting the muddy bitterness of yarrowroot—and he felt … at home. These failures were
society pages?’ Sirius retorted, mock scandalised. ‘Ah, yes, the Veela child. Might to stay away from him, Harry. I heard he killed a man with his bare hands when he was only eight.’
– and the green fire fizzles, dying away. It takes him another three times, before he finally gets through to Dumbledore, half in tears with frustration.
Draco closed the door, and leaned against it. He closed his eyes, and took deep calming breaths, trying to will away the tugging at his heart. Eventually his pounding heart slowed down, and his overheated skin cooled. Merlin, if this was what living with Potter was going to be like, Draco hoped his assassin would reach him before the week was over.
,’ Mother was crushing him to her, her icy façade broken into shards, tears slipping down her cheeks. ‘My son, my son, my
Hermione clears a path with her wand, hauling Ron to his feet when he falls; Neville follows, his wand held limply by his side now. The three of them stand before Draco, staring up at him like supplicants before the unmoving statue of a far-off god. He opens his beak, but the only sounds that emerge are broken squawks:
There is a vaguely circular shape to the explosion, with Draco and the enormous stone cauldron in the very centre of it. He looks at the cauldron, taking in the runes carved into the grey surface, nearly unreadable in places where time smoothened the stone. The summoning runes are daubed in thestral blood, streaks running down the sides, trickling onto the dead brown grass below.
, Draco decides, is the word to describe him. He cannot tell if Zabini is the alpha, so he starts sitting with the Slytherin for every Herbology class—noticeable enough for Parkinson to leer, ‘Ooh, watch out, Zabini, looks like Malfoy has decided you will be his next boyfriend. Lucky thing you like it rough in bed!’
After a while, Albus hears footsteps on the stairs. He looks from the cold cup of tea he has been rotating in his hands. The look of Poppy Pomfrey’s face confirms the fear curdling bitter and sour as wormwood in his stomach. The portly woman sits down heavily on the armchair across from him, taking off her white cap.
be true.’ Her tone is admiring, and it’s hard to tell through the green tinge of Floo, but Harry thinks he sees her cheeks darken.
The air inside the shop is still and tight. Chairs scrape against the floor as Minnie and Moony rise to their feet, white-faced and tensed. Harry takes a step back, dropping the holly wand with a loud clatter. ‘Voldemort’s wand?’
The Martyrs are rounded and chucked into Azkaban, and Harry gets his wand back, but he isn’t in any state to hex the living hell out of those fuckers, because he is cooped up at home, sweaty and trembling, waiting for the curse to run its course. It is a heat-inducement curse, meant to make an omega horny as hell and desperate to mate. Used on an unwilling party, and it is sexual assault.
Harry has also realised that Sirius and Moony are drawing attention of their own. He supposes that their lives must be unusual enough even within the wizarding community to attract gossip, especially since Sirius is a Black. After all, how many alphas out there are also werewolves? And how many of them are soul-bonded to an omega disowned by his bigoted pureblood family? They are pretending not to notice the occasional whisper, asking Harry instead where he might like to go for tea.
Those words so casually uttered have the Veela in him convinced that his mate loves him and now, Potter is bound to him.
‘It’s frankly insulting that you think we wouldn’t, since the two of you are not subtle at all,’ Neville says dryly. ‘I’m right, aren’t I? About the connection.’
‘Your father is a murdering Death Eater,’ Potter continued, green eyes aflame with frustration. ‘And he’s right where he belongs!’
“No,” Draco said shortly. “Anyway, you were telling us about the report from the Investigation Department.”
Draco stepped into the loo and, after a few long minutes, walked out. Without looking at his mother’s table, he headed straight for the back door. The alley smelled of wet tealeaves and spoiled milk. He burrowed into his cloak and hurried along.
The wandmaker reappears with two wand boxes. He hesitates for a moment, glancing between the two boxes, before handing Harry the left one. ‘Go on. Try that one. Give it a wave,’ he urges.
Eventually, the Hat slides over his head, blocking out the intrusive stares of the other students. He heard the swell of chatter, until the Hat speaks and drowns everything else out. He squeezes his eyes shut, and hopes fervently for Gryffindor.
The clouds shift across the flat dark sky. The moonlight undulates across the ancient bone yard and illuminates the devastation. Headstones are broken and jagged like teeth in a chain smoker’s mouth. Statues are toppled and blackened, some of them still moving with the old magic imbued into their stone; it is a macabre puppet show.
‘You go ahead. I think I’ll take a bath at the Prefects’ Bathroom,’ Draco said to Zabini, who – in a mark of his annoyance with Draco – nodded curtly and went down the passageway.
But he has not considered the consequences of using weapons. Because Neville is right: what he does to himself, he inevitably does to Draco. His awareness of Draco, beating in time with his heart, tells him so. He has not thought of this as a responsibility, until now.
. Dumbledore said that it was a group of former Death Eaters, the old loyalty stirred up by such a large gathering of wizards, that it didn’t mean Voldemort was back in yet another form.
‘We are almost there, don’t be a whinger,’ Draco says over his shoulder. ‘Watch your feet. The rock’s a bit crumbly there.’
The only option was to dig out the Marauder’s Map. Harry grimaced, as he unfolded the thick parchment, remembering how the last time he followed Malfoy around ended in disaster. It was different this time, because he wasn’t trying to prove that Malfoy was a Death Eater; he only wanted to find out where he went during mealtimes, when most of the school was gathered in the Great Hall and the rest of the castle empty. It made Harry a little uneasy, not having Malfoy where he could watch him.
because I want to at the same time—is there any point thinking, “Oh, if he weren’t my soulmate, he wouldn’t do this,” when we
’re fucking insane! I don’t know what you think Potter and I were doing, but we’re not fucking snogging. We were serving our detention all right? Filch gave us extra for breaking all those desks that night.’
‘Okay. All right,’ Potter looked down at his hands, his glasses sliding down his nose. ‘Dumbledore is giving me private lessons on Voldemort. They are … they are supposed to help me … survive, you know, when he … when he comes for me.’
A sob tears through his chest, heavy and true like an iron-tipped spear, and he wraps his arms around Harry, sinking to his knees on the ground.
Malfoy sits next to him on the cold stone floor, delicately picking at the strange platter of roast beef and slices of Brie and Camembert cheese he asked from the kitchen. He’s clearly intent on pretending their earlier conversation didn’t happen; that Harry didn’t lose his patience and snap, ‘What are you trying to hide, Malfoy? Why wouldn’t you tell me what happened to you?’ Malfoy blanched and looked away, his lips pressed tightly together, leaving Harry to fume silently.
He picked up his Charms textbook. There was a piece of old parchment beneath it, made of thick yellow stock like the kind they used to make in the seventies and heavily creased with folds.
Draco stared at Harry for a long time, devouring the sight of that beloved face. He had thought he would never see this face again. To be granted this second chance … Draco shuddered. No, he couldn’t be too happy. Unhappiness would only follow.
‘I do not want your gratitude,’ Harry says without thinking; Lizzy’s grip tightens around his hand. He does not look at her, fixated as he is by the spectacle before him.
He hastily yanks on sweatpants, and hurries out. Malfoy stands on the doorstep, meticulously dressed in well-cut navy-blue robes, swathed in a dark cloak. He appears far too pale in contrast with his dark clothes, his braid white-blonde draped over a shoulder. He raises his head, brows tightly furrowed. Harry opens his mouth, and his knees nearly buckle from the strength of desire that suffuses him.
He raises his wand. Harry tenses, flicking his wand towards it, but Draco holds it limply, and his expression is grim.
," the omega breathes, hands on either side of Eltanin's neck, eyes jewel-bright. He is speaking Parseltongue, language of Slytherin. "I have found you, alpha."
‘It’s okay. I shagged the bastard last night, I know it’s him,’ Harry interrupted with a smile. ‘Sorry, Goyle, can’t stay for breakfast. There was some balls I need to crush.’ Then with a grin at Blaise and Greg’s gawping faces, Harry turned on his heel and walked out.
Zabini was smirking at him, all sculpted planes and sharp angles. ‘You Sacred Twenty-Eight lot are disgustingly incestuous. Cousins marrying cousins … with all the inbreeding, it’s no wonder Slytherins end up with winners like Flint.’ Marcus Flint, a hard, nasty bastard Draco wouldn’t put up with if the bugger weren’t Quidditch captain.
Draco gazed at him steadily, trying to ignore the stirring in his groin, the delicious pooling of heat between his legs. His hand stole up to tangle in Harry’s hair, his body craving the touch even as he fought it.
Draco looked away, feeling the ghost of the ache in his arm where Potter had broken it. Potter hadn’t looked human when he was rearing over Draco, spewing insults and screaming vulgarities, spittle flying from his mouth as he stamped down on Draco’s left forearm again and again and again. Snape had come to Draco’s rescue, Stunning Potter and taking Draco away to be healed before he could be brought to Pomfrey.
Harry cannot get the front door open, not when he’s pressed against it, so he fires a Stunner straight at Draco’s stomach, which only serves to knock the breath out of him as much as a punch from a boy would, but distracts Draco enough for Harry to slide downwards against the door and pull himself free. Harry scrambles to his feet, throwing himself up, ignoring the blood pouring from the wounds in his shoulders. He ducks into the living room, where there are windows and enough space for Harry to whirl around, pointing his wand warningly at the advancing Veela.
‘You have done all you can,’ she continued. ‘But … your mother …’ She trailed off, not wanting to say it.
Draco slipped a hand to the back of his head, kissing Potter deeply, biting on Potter’s bottom lip before pulling away. Potter grinned, scrambling to his feet.
‘I turned him down,’ Lizzy tells Harry and Jane, still pale with shock. ‘I do not think he took it well.’
Minnie snorts, and says irritably: ‘Oh, sit down, Albus,’ before continuing to eat. Harry grins at Dumbledore, who looks visibly relieved. As they pass the old wizard the dishes, the kitchen settles in their usual easy, cheerful atmosphere.
A week later, the neighbourhood is alive with news that Bingley has left Netherfield for the foreseeable future. He has returned to York.
. He doesn’t trust himself around him, doesn’t want to know what he might do. Better to be somewhere else than hurt Draco in his rage. He must leave.
The Great Hall is buzzing with chatter; nearly the entire Slytherin table is goggling at him. Harry looks at him quizzically, but Draco simply shakes his head. The group of first-years slowly whittles down, and finally, it is Harry’s turn. The Hat takes longer than anybody else—longer than Granger or Longbottom—long enough for McGonagall to frown a little. Until, finally, the Hat announces, ‘
The thing in the shadows makes a sudden sharp movement – the raising of a head – and green eyes, hard and shiny as emeralds, are staring straight at Draco. They look at each other, the summoner and the summoned. The green eyes are wide and vacant; Draco cannot read them.
The first day of term went disastrously, starting with Snape’s non-verbal Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson (why the git Potter always insisted on having a pissing contest he could not win against Snape, Draco couldn’t understand) and ending with Slughorn’s rigged Potion-brewing contest.
He nods, dropping his hands, and asks falteringly: ‘Would you … that is, do you think you might—’ he cuts himself off with a groan, an angry twist to his mouth.
,’ Narcissa hissed. ‘You are my –’ She couldn’t say anything further, merely pressed her lips together to swallow the ugly emotions.
‘Malfoy—’ Harry starts to say, not sure what he wants to say, but knows that the other man is about to do something he doesn’t want to, and fuck if Harry lets that happen on his account.
The entire House is swept up into Fred’s plot to steal Umbridge’s quill. The new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor has done nothing to endear herself to the students of Hogwarts. She was clearly inserted by Minister Fudge to keep an eye on Dumbledore. In her first lesson with the Gryffindor fifth-years, she insinuated Harry—and Dumbledore for abetting him—was a liar, and insisted on calling Cedric Diggory’s death nothing more than a
Harry whips around, his eyes wide behind his glasses. He opens his mouth, but pauses; something in his eyes shifts, and Draco feels a veil drawn across their bond, like a mooncalf shying away from exposure. He swallows his alarm. Harry is intertwining his fingers with Draco’s, his face impassive.
His face is so red, it reaches the tips of his ears. Draco pushes himself up into a sitting position, shaking his head, as Harry’s words slowly permeate through his bewilderment.
Potter paused, eyes scouring Draco’s face. ‘I saw the bandage in the Prefects’ bathroom. How exactly is your left forearm hurt, Malfoy?’
him … didn’t he? They had been getting along so well lately … but didn’t they say there was a thin line between hate and love? Draco’s dastardly Veela attraction must have confused him. Potter would never –
Sirius was attacked by killers sent by his family—or what remains of it after the war. Harry knows that Sirius’s family, the Blacks, were bad people: Dark wizards who supported Voldemort, the man who killed Harry’s parents and waged a war on the wizarding world that lasted eleven years. This, he heard in little by little, whenever Minnie or Moony mentioned it in the passing. They don’t talk about it, because Sirius doesn’t like to.
It is so easy to change, slipping off his human skin and sinking into his Veela form: his muscles twisting and growing, bones piercing through feather-covered skin, forming great, dirty grey wings that drag on his shoulders. His hands and feet curl with claws, black and hooked. He takes a moment to adjust to the new weight of his head, heavy with his steel-grey beak.
‘Why the fuck not, Potter?’ he snarled, stepping in close to Potter. ‘You’re fit and I like looking at you, all right? Are you bloody satisfied now? Is that what you want to know? I wank to you every night – happy?’
Nor out in the corridors, where he had grabbed Malfoy, pushed him against the wall in an alcove and snogged him long and deep until they were both aching and hard in their pants.
sorry that you have been bearing this guilt for so long. It is not yours to bear, as it is not mine. It is not our fault Colin is dead.
‘You found it!’ he crows. ‘Sirius and Remus told me all about it—the map they made of the school when they were kids! They thought it was destroyed, so it was with Filch the whole time. Bloody hell, take it out!’
‘One day, Eliza, you will meet a person who will give you cause to regret your words,’ Jane says in gently chastising tones.
Draco must have been in his other form for a while. There were leaves and branches in his wings and matted hair, dried blood on his beak, and dirt encrusted on his claws. What remained of his robes were filthy and stained. He cried out when he saw Harry, deep and throaty, and launched himself towards him.
‘Busy,’ Potter replies with a distracted air. ‘We’re in talks with the Ministry to provide Muggle job training to agencies like the Aurors and Muggle Liaison – you know, those who would come into contact with Muggles the most.’ Potter is tearing the label into shreds.
Draco began laughing again because that was the only thing he could do as agony ripped into his chest and tore his heart apart.
He is barely aware of where he is walking, beating a path by instinct; he knows these trees after the months spent amongst them.
He jumps, his head snapping backwards. An old wizard is stepping out onto a ladder from the paper-thin gap between two shelves. He peers down at the group of them, blinking owlishly from behind thick glasses.
As he falls, he sees Pansy spinning around, her face slack with shock. There is a rustle of leaves showering down on him on the ground, and a hand seizes his upper arm.
They made desultory conversation about the weather, and the latest Quidditch matches. Draco would rather go into his room, and sleep the time away until he could see Harry again. Theo was not boring exactly; he simply wasn’t an inspiring conversationalist. Harry, on the other hand, Draco could never run of things to talk to about.
‘Are you going to tell me what you’re doing?’ Zabini asked, even though he knew it was pointless to try.
Draco makes a startled noise. Harry quickly summons a ball of light, and pins it in the air above their heads. The warm light splashes over the tangled undergrowth and against thick, straight trees. Draco flicks his eyes up at the light and back to Harry. How many times have Harry used this nifty little trick in front of him?
Draco burst into laughter. Potter hiked himself up onto his elbows, frowning mutinously. His laugher subsiding, Draco shook his head.
They dropped the topic only because Zabini had to go off to Slughorn’s compartment. Draco shook his head after Zabini was gone.
‘And thus, we lose the battle against silliness for dominance over her mind,’ Lizzy whispers to Harry, who chuckles.
Draco wants to look away but Potter’s eyes are impossible to turn from. They are molten and intense, heated with an emotion Draco must be imagining. It is unreal. How can Potter be saying such things?
However, Fate connives to make a mess of their affairs. Mrs. Maeve Fancourt, Lizzy friend from Derbyshire, writes to ask Lizzy to come visit her new baby boy, and Lizzy is quite unequal to refusing her dear friend once again. At Derbyshire, Lizzy is perturbed to find out that Mr. Fancourt, a Muggle-born, is a boyhood friend of Darcy’s. By this point, Harry and Jane are no longer surprised to learn that Lizzy and the Fancourts dine frequently with Darcy and his charmingly shy younger sister, Georgiana.
Draco thought of his mother – of strong, beautiful, flawless Narcissa Malfoy – in pain and screaming, writhing on the floor like an augurey which wings were being slowly ripped off, and the pain he thought he was used to, that he could no longer feel flared up, blinding and breath-taking.
Draco thinks, irritated. He leans back in his seat, folding his arms across his chest. They can hear movement and laughter in the other compartments. Other students are moving down the corridor outside, a few looking in curiously.
‘Don’t be so barbaric, Potter, relying on violence to get your way,’ he snarls. ‘Let me go. You clearly don’t want me here. You weren’t thinking at all of looking me up, were you? They
He senses Harry immediately: rage howling and clawing, pinpricks of pain where Harry has been cut. They are in a graveyard—that is the only thing Draco makes out before he leaps into the air, releasing Dumbledore and McGonagall. ‘Draco!’ McGonagall shouts, but he is already winging through the darkness to the glow at the other end.
to hear from Bingley in the first place? His thoughts are all a muddle, and he does not know how to move forward.
‘Certainly wish I could have,’ Draco agrees enthusiastically, his eyes shining with joy. ‘Hermione got detention for
‘A few times,’ Nev replies. ‘He’s all right those times. He isn’t nasty like Parkinson, or bullies like Crabbe and Goyle. Keeps to himself, I reckon.’
Draco’s head is spinning. He has never experienced such a thing, the sensation as if the very earth is sliding beneath his feet. People are saying such things about him and his family? He clasps his hands together to steady himself, focussing his mind on the heat between his palms. ‘Of course I’m real,’ he blurts unthinkingly.
Except the weight pinning him to the ground is like a mountain falling across his back: earth and rock and the darkness it holds pressing him into the water, howling in his ear that he is weak and helpless and he cannot escape. He struggles like a fly beating against the window, sinking under the humiliation of failure. How stupid to have sworn his strength in Harry’s protection, only to die at twelve, drowning in piss and shit.
He lands a distance in front of her, gripping the broom hard in his hand, looking down. The grass is tufty between his sneakers, and it makes him think of the dead grass on Privet Drive when summer is hottest. Of the taste of scratchy grass and dirt in his mouth, when Dudley and his friends shove him down on the ground.
Behind him, his godfathers are clambering down to the platform, cheerfully bickering about the best way to organise two trunks in the space. They fall silent, when they see the Malfoys. Harry starts marching over, before his godfathers can stop him.
Harry snorts. ‘Well, you are right in that. Both you and my mother need not fear for my sisters. They are particular about marriage – and rightly so – and I believe that if they should descend into the dreaded spinsterhood, they will do so with grace and aplomp. In any case, I will support them.’
‘Yeah, but we’re just friends!’ Harry yelps, his face suffused with itchy heat. ‘Merlin. Have people been saying this all along?’
The Death Eaters—that’s what they surely are—are turning, raising their wands, and Draco grabs a man from the air and hurls him down at his compatriots. Whirling around in mid-air to avoid the jets of light, he kicks over a statue of an avenging angel, and it falls across the Death Eaters, their screams shrill in the dead air.
‘Never thought of you as a ponce, Potter,’ he said. ‘You like taking it up the arse too, Potter? Would you like me to fuck you?’
Draco frowned. Potter was always doing that; if things weren’t done the Gryffindor way, it was wrong and should be changed. ‘Aren’t you friends with Weasley and Granger because they have something to offer you that you lack? Weasley gives you his family and you give him the distinction of being the Boy Who Lived’s best mate. Granger helps you in school and you give her friendship because you are far too kind to push another lonely person away.’
decency, that there were certain levels you would never stoop to. Morgana’s sagging tits, Malfoy, I thought there was hope for you.’
Since Potter could not leave his side, he had taken to having lunch with Theo and Draco. Theo had stopped by every day this week, which was fairly unusual. He was probably morbidly fascinated – as Blaise was when he heard the news – by Draco Malfoy being watched over by his former rival.
Snape turned to him, his wand raised. His face was fixed in a rictus of agony, his mouth stretched open into a hideous grimace, his eyes an impenetrable inky darkness. Draco’s heartbeat was thunderous in his ears, his mouth wet with hot blood. He closed his eyes in anticipation. Instead, at the murmur of a spell, the chains lashed themselves back to the wall, tightening, pulling Draco back.
Pomfrey returned with the potions and insisted Draco spend a night in the hospital wing for observation. Exhausted, Draco gave in. He hoped she would prescribe him a Sleeping Potion; it would be strong enough to keep the nightmares away. She gave him fresh robes and when he changed, he took care of his left arm.
She cups his face between her hands, brushing his tears away. Harry sniffs, and Minnie envelops him in her arms. He buries his damp face in her shoulder, relieved and grateful. It’s okay; he won’t be going back to the Dursleys. Minnie said she would protect him.
‘Who took these photos?’ Harry asks, examining the blown-up Muggle prints of the photographs Draco took that he likes best.
When Hermione is this determined, there is no point disagreeing with her. She is more than capable of badgering people to give in to her tireless persuasion. Ron is terrible at knowing when to shut up; another reason they would never have worked out as a couple. His comment had only set her off, and the rest of them had to bear Hermione’s lecture for the rest of dinner. Draco ignored Ron’s request to pass the roast beef as punishment.
Potter inhaled sharply, as if he had just realised something. Dumbledore didn’t look at him, didn’t look at either of them. He was gazing out into the star-strewn sky, eyes shining with unshed tears.
is to be witnessed before us.’ He winks roguishly at Harry, nodding none too subtly across the room, where Jane stands in conversation with Bingley and Malfoy.
‘You certainly are something, Potter,’ Zabini interjected, voice smooth as glass, frosty as Freezing Charm. His dark eyes were glittering with malice. ‘I have always known there was something wrong with you. There you are, spouting lines about House unity and the wizarding world coming together as one, and here you are, throwing hatred and prejudice in the face of a sincere apology.
!’ the madman screeches—a blinding green light—the sound of rushing darkness. And Harry collapses like a marionette with its strings cut, the light gone from his eyes, and Draco feels himself wrenched apart into two.
When he asked Ron and Hermione if they noticed something strange about Malfoy, they exchanged glances and shrugged.
The omega was peering into the darkened greenhouse, his back to Eltanin. He turned, hearing or sensing Eltanin's approach, and his mouth opened, perhaps to explain why he was here, but there was no time for speaking, because Eltanin had pushed him against the glass wall, hands on his shoulders, mouth on his mouth.
‘You’re an idiot,’ Draco finally says, and Harry feels Draco’s body relenting, leaning into his embrace.
‘Oh, the Malfoys have a well-recorded history of dalliances with prominent Muggles – nobility even. I would imagine that Bingley and Darcy are certainly rich enough to be useful for our pureblood friends. But you are right to suppose that Zabini and Parkinson have no such connections.’
As the dark, squeezed feeling of Apparition took over, Draco wondered if Potter could hate him as much as he hated himself. He rather doubted it was possible.
He has asked himself this question before, many times. And the answer – the irrefutable answer – is always the same: because Harry wants Draco for himself. He cannot tell when his feelings crossed the line from friendship to this selfish, warped desperation to possess Draco Malfoy for his own, but it is too late for reversal.
He continued washing up. Dinner had started half an hour ago. He had taken to coming to dinner later these days. It was awkward sitting there, being blatantly ignored by Pansy and Zabini. The other Slytherins in their year clearly felt awkward, especially when Draco joined a conversation and Zabini would overtly cut him.
Crouched on the chest of his dead prey, red, pulsing flesh in his beak and blood dripping from his claws, Draco throws back his head and crows triumphantly, his body warm with heat and his veins flowing with liquid joy. He is
Potter gave a shout of laughter, genuine mirthful laughter. Draco couldn’t help but smile in response. The first time Draco had heard Potter laugh, it was like having a shot of Invigoration Draught straight into his veins. It made Draco warm and happy and scared all at once.
. It is indisputably foolish for him to hang around Potter when Potter is the greatest threat to his
“No,” Draco interrupted, knowing he needed more time to plan this reconciliation. “No, it’s fine. Look, it’s been two weeks, and the attacker hasn’t done
Harry snorts, tightening his hold around Draco, dropping his head so that his cheek presses against Draco’s neck. ‘I would have asked you even if you hadn’t.’
Draco strode past dusty, dead shops. He didn’t hesitate before pushing open the door of Borgin and Burkes. The bell tinkled above his head and Borgin, who was peering down at a display case of precious stones, looked up. He blanched when he saw Draco.
There was a battle between them – of course there was; Malfoy is evenly matched in ability and tenacity with Harry. Harry prevailed, but in the end, he could not hold on to his dominance over the other wizard, for Malfoy supplicated himself before Harry, and Harry was so horrified by the sight of Malfoy weeping, he let him go. Harry was right in the end that Hogwarts was the safer bet, for the next time they met, Malfoy was a prisoner in chains.
‘Why?’ The blond throws himself into the chair across the kitchen table, leaning back with a groan. ‘Bloody hell, I’m knackered.’
‘People will know eventually,’ Harry says, and catching the look on Draco’s face, continues: ‘Well, I don’t intend to keep on pretending to be beta, once there’s no need for me to. Once … I defeat Voldemort. Sirius says that we feel ashamed for being omega, because we let society make us think we should. I don’t want to keep taking suppressants, or feeling weak, or hiding such a core part of who I am. It’s exhausting.’
They continued in this vein for a while, batting questions about favourite colours and childhood dreams until Draco was lulled into a doze, his eyes drifting close. Potter’s arms were warm and the pillows were soft.
Harry’s mistake is kissing Draco’s hands—and once that intimate line has been crossed, Draco hasn’t been shy to exert his physical affection in front of others. Sirius and Moony are at first aggrieved—
‘Ah,’ he says blankly. ‘Well, the truth is never pleasant to hear. Fine. I am very sorry to have taken up your time, Potter. Point me towards Hogsmeade, and I will leave you alone.’
They turned to him in surprise. To Draco’s delight, Potter turned bright red, and nervously pushed his glasses up his nose. He looked so deliciously adorable; Draco wanted to drop kisses all over that reddened face.
‘But that looks dangerous,’ Potter was glaring at him stubbornly. ‘What if it makes you sick? Is that why you’ve been looking so shitty lately?’
Figures cloaked in black surround a huge cauldron, a man sobbing at its base. Harry is tied to a crumbling gravestone, thrashing against the ropes, his raised hand bleeding at the wrist. His head snaps up, and he is shouting: ‘Draco,
Kissing Harry is like flying into the sun: Draco is blinded and completely destroyed. His heartbeat pulses in his throat, its beat thrumming through Draco’s entire being.
He opens his eyes, and Draco is looking at him with an open, clear gaze.He lowers his eyes, shame-faced. ‘You must think me an abject hypocrite for accusing
Harry took his time to rise. It didn’t matter where Malfoy went for the moment; Harry knew there was no way Malfoy would leave him now. He cleaned the dried come off his face and hair, dressed in the clothes scattered around the bed, walked over to the newspaper Malfoy had dropped, and, upon reading the first article, very calmly crumpled the papers up and lit it on fire. He dropped the fireball to the ground, turning to face Zabini, who was looking miserable.
Behind Potter, Weasley made a noise of protest, raising his wand. Granger grabbed him, hissing at him, ‘
don’t want you to go. Pans and Greg and everybody else, including – including Seamus, you know, you know he’s taken a liking to you – oh, not
Potter draws a deep shuddery breath. ‘Liar,’ he rasps and his wand tip lights up, flooding the tiny space with harsh white light.
The piles of rubbish are close around them, the air dusty and tepid: row after row of cupboards missing doors and badly scratched desks and tilting chairs. Draco dashes perspiration from his eyes, glaring at the endless mess. The noises of Voldemort’s forces are closer: the attackers must be in the castle, baying for blood.
Heat and friction grow between them, gasps and moans breathed softly against skin. At some point, Harry loses his glasses, and Draco is showering kisses upon Harry’s face: his closed eyes, his nose, his cheeks, his chin, causing Harry to chuckle. The laughter turns into a hiss when Draco presses his lips against Harry’s neck and nips at his skin.
was frustrated that she was angry. They both knew he hadn’t a choice and over his (soon-to-be) dead body was he going to involve her in a plan doomed to fail.
Draco is back now; the relief is sobering. Harry hadn’t realised how heavy the days were hanging on his shoulders. But it doesn’t change that Draco had left and Harry couldn’t find him. It also doesn’t change that his father is dead, because Harry let Voldemort into his head. Draco had been so angry with him before, telling him he mustn’t encourage the “visions”, but Harry was too weak—
The Galleons could be better spent bribing the Azkaban guards, those who were wizards, to secretly give thicker blankets and clean robes to Lucius Malfoy. After receiving his lord’s punishment, Father had been sent back to suffer the rest of his Azkaban sentence; the wizard prison was the first institution to fall to Lord Voldemort.
‘Welcome, Mr and Mrs Malfoy,’ the male Veela greets them, his voice a deep melodious baritone that makes Narcissa blush.
‘You don’t have to go, mate,’ Ron said worriedly. ‘It won’t get busy for a few hours yet and –’ He was interrupted by the tinkling of the bell as a family of young children rushed into the shop.
Outside the castle walls, an ominous booming echoes across the grounds: Voldemort’s forces are pounding on the magical ward that surrounds Hogwarts.
Potter was closing his eyes, tilting his head up, lips slightly parted, and they were moving closer. The heat of Potter’s body caressed Draco’s skin. Draco was drinking in Potter’s face, feeling as if he could not look at this boy enough. His face was hot, his heartbeat pulsing in his neck. He was closing his eyes, his lips were tingling.
‘Yes, I knew we were meant to be from the time I was a wee lad,’ his godfather replies, raising his eyebrows at his partner.
Draco growls, his muscles trembling from the effort to hold himself back. Harry shifts next to him, and Draco feels the smooth ivory of a fang pressed into his palm. ‘Snake,’ he whispers.
Draco stared at him. How did they go from forsworn enemies to secret lovers rendezvousing in hidden cupboards? Draco couldn’t figure it out. Looking at Potter’s face now, he only felt that it must have been inevitable, the two of them.
‘Harry,’ Moony says with absurd gentleness. ‘Why do you think it affects you so much, knowing that Draco has romantic and sexual relationships?’
Draco blinks, and opens his mouth. He sees something on Harry’s face, and pales, dropping his eyes. ‘You are very angry with me,’ he says with exaggerated care, like Harry is a tetchy Graphorn prone to rampage, ‘I should have come earlier, but there were things I needed to discuss with Mother. I should have sent a note or something—I’m sorry, that was remiss of me. You—and everyone—must have been so worried. I’m sorry, Harry, I really am. Please say you’ll forgive me.’
The Veela jerked her head towards the door, where Potter was waiting outside of, and a conspiratorial smile spread over her face.
Draco stared at him. There was a flinty mercilessness in Potter’s eyes. He had seen the damage the Dark artefact had done to his teammate, to his friend, and he
,’ Pansy mutters, screwing her face up in distaste. ‘He’s just a temporary gardener. I don’t like him. Let’s walk faster.’
Draco ushers Harry into the flat, a hand on the small of Harry’s back, a casually possessive gesture that sends a thrill down Draco’s spine. Harry looks around curiously, but the flat is still in its sterile and inoffensively pleasant state; he didn’t plan on staying long enough to mark his personality on the place.
He put his head in his hands, blood smearing into his tears, salt and metal mingling in his mouth. He doesn’t know what he regrets, only tasting the bitterness, the wretchedness carved into his flesh by a dull knife—not a pain that flares bright, but one that slices open the same spot over and over again, endless, maddening. A sob wrenches from his chest.
Draco sniffed, tucking his head beneath Potter’s chin. ‘I’m a dragon, thank you very much. Bloody hell, get
The blonde wizard snorts, examining the amber liquid in his glass. ‘I dare not claim any intimate knowledge of the worthy Bennet family. After all, most of society have not had the pleasure of knowing many Bennets – you are hardly in London. Every season, we hear surprise that the Bennet children remain quite single.’
“I’m sorry,” he blurted. “I know you’re together with Parkinson. I really shouldn’t have kissed you. You were so close, and you smelled so good, and you were saying my name – “
,’ Draco says triumphantly. ‘You are the single most powerful creature—human or otherwise—in this entire fucking world. You are
The reminder that Draco had killed Theo caused him to sit up. He was back in the ward where he had found out he was now a Veela, albeit with a bigger bed and Harry lying next to him. The room was hushed and darkened, the night sky grey and heavy outside.
People roared, surging forwards, and Harry pressed himself against the wall, flabbergasted at the intensity of the outrage for the besmirching of his name. Plainclothes Aurors jumped out of the crowd and began shouting for calm and order. Harry took the chance to dive into the crowd, elbowing his way to the exit.
Draco grits his teeth, hiding his fists in his sleeves. The attention comes whenever he is amongst people, and he loathes it. He must get used to it, now that he will be going to Hogwarts in no less than a month. He and his parents are in Diagon Alley for the very purpose of collecting the rest of his things for school, including his wand.
Draco took a deep breath, and said, “I would like to say something if you would give me the chance.”
Harry heard from Hermione, who asked Draco separately, that he had gone to Hogsmeade with Nolan for their date. ‘He said he had fun,’ Hermione told him, eying him warily. ‘I hardly think it’s anything serious. It’s only one date. Oh, won’t you make up with him, Harry? You know you are the only one who can ever force him to say what he really means.’
He shook his head, bewildered. He looked down at his short, skinny frame, all elbows and knees despite having at least two servings every meal. He has read the histories of the greatest wizarding heroes: Merlin, the four founders of Hogwarts, Hengist of Woodcroft, and Newt Scamander. Even Dumbledore himself, who defeated the Dark wizard Grindelwald. Harry wanted to laugh at the idea of
Draco watched with satisfaction as Potter paced and muttered curses beneath his breath. Recognising his schoolyard jealousy of Potter was vastly different relinquishing it. There was something exciting about getting under Potter’s skin, and watching him squirm.
He takes a step towards the omega. Potter flicks a cautious gaze up—and blanches at the look on Eltanin's face. Eltanin is sure his face must be ugly, fixed in that rictus of demented anger.
? He opened his mouth to disabuse Zabini of the notion that taking the Dark Mark was nothing more than an arrogant schoolboy’s vanity. But he saw the raw fear thrumming under Zabini’s polished mask of scorn – and stopped.
He turns his face away, fists clenched by his side, perspiration dripping down his back, as the seamstress makes this and that adjustment to the heavy robes. Father murmured there might be trouble, but he only meant that Mother’s rebel cousin—the only Black on the
‘Why do you always think that everything must be your fault?’ Draco sighs, taking Harry’s hands by the wrists. ‘Don’t be a wanker. It was worse for you, wasn’t it?’
