Draco sat up abruptly and stared at Pansy as though she had just declared undying love for Ronald Weasley, ‘What do you mean?’
Harry nodded, releasing his grip on Severus’s arms. A slow smile spread across his face as he looked up in to the dark eyes, filled with ill-concealed shock above him. He nodded once more to emphasise his point. ‘Does it bother you?’ Before the elder of the two could reply, a large oak door to Harry’s right was pulled open and Remus entered the room followed by a billowing cloud of steam. He was rubbing vigorously at his head with a towel and missed the presence of his’ pup’ (his little wolf joke). ‘Hey babe I thought you were going to join me?’  Harry smirked as the snarly Slytherin before him coloured a very interesting shade of pink, he snorted at Severus’s steely glare causing Remus to pull the damp towel from his head. ‘Hey pup,’ he smiled, not a trace of embarrassment evident as he stretched over with one arm to ruffle Harry’s already untidy hair, ‘to what do we owe this pleasure?’ Harry looked up at Severus with a small, shy smile, ‘Well Father and I …’ Harry was cut off, mid-sentence, by a soft gasp from Severus and a strangled sob from Remus. Harry’s eyes flicked between the two, he waited anxiously between the two, hoping desperately that he had not overstepped the mark.
‘ I will be fine,’ Harry chuckled, ‘The Dursley’s have no idea that I cannot use magic at home.’ He said as a huge grin crossed his face, ‘It’s going to be a fun summer.’
Harry woke early on the Saturday morning and lay for a while, thinking about the coming Quidditch match. He was nervous, he had never wanted to win so much, he had never wanted to beat Slytherin  so badly, he was looking forward to racing against Draco, to fly side by side with him, in competition with Draco to see who could get the snitch first, it was exciting  but he did not want to look stupid in front the Slytherin. Harry looked across the dorm at the slumbering form of Ron and sighed, they had not spoken a word to each other since that night in the common room and, despite everything Harry missed him. Harry had spent the last few weeks discussing the possibility of The Chamber of Secrets and it’s possible location with Hermione and Draco, occasionally bringing Blaise and Neville in to the mix, they had not got very far, but even so he still missed Ron’s input. Harry stopped himself and frowned as he realised that it had been Ron’s somewhat unwanted input that had caused their fight in the first place, Harry huffed , jumped up and got dressed, he headed to the Great Hall without a backwards glance to join the rest of the Gryffindor team around the table.
Harry stared at the floor but he knew Ron was right, he knew Draco would follow him if he went, and he wasn’t sure if he wanted to drag Draco in to more trouble than he already had, ‘But it’s for Hermione,’he tried one more time.
Harry eyes had widened during Ginny’s tirade taking in what was being said, ‘shit Gin what have I done?’ It came out in almost a whisper and Ginny relented.  Her eyes softened as she took in the pain etched across her best friend’s face, he looked crestfallen, ‘Harry, he’s still here, go after him,’ she reached out placing a gentle hand to the skin she had slapped before.
‘We’ll talk later and you can tell me about all the times that you were staring at me in Potions.’ He smirked.
Harry looked from one friend to the other as though considering what to say next, then casting a glance around the common room he started to speak in a quiet voice barely above a whisper, ‘ I need you to understand, to  understand that i’m just so happy to have him back. He’s mine, not like I own him, but I can call him mine. I have never had someone that was mine before, I mean don’t get  me wrong I know have you guys and Nev, but this is different, you guys will all go off and be with other people, I mean Nev already has, and you guys, well it will probably be each other,’ he added with a knowing smile as Hermione blushed and Ron suddenly needed to clear his throat, ‘Anyway, I don’t want to lose him, not over something so silly’ Harry finished simply, looking at his friends expectantly.
Harry turned once more to look in to his boyfriends steely grey eyes, he reached up and placed a hand on the pale cheek, Draco’s gaze dropped to meet his, ‘Who cares at the minute though, we are just kids and are you not having fun now?’
After the return of Sirius and the unearthing of many truths, he had rekindled his relationship with Remus, one that had ended far too quickly during its early months at Hogwarts because of secrets, lies and deceptions and Harry had been part of the package. First, an uneasy truce had formed between the two, mainly for the benefit of the fragile werewolf, followed by a grudging mutual respect. The relationship had steadily grown in to a deep affection which, safe to say, had taken them all by surprise, none more so than Remus who had gone to great pains to ensure the happiness of both his partner and the boy he now called son.
'Nev it's ok, it's...' Neville wrenched himself from Blaise's grip causing Blaise to lose his balance and fall to his knees. Neville rounded on his boyfriend and hissed through gritted teeth, 'How is this ok? How is this ever ok'
Harry kept his head down as he walked a bit further down the table sitting that he and Neville could look over at the Slytherin table across the Great Halll, he was happy to find that Draco and Blaise had decided to do the same. At that moment Draco looked up and steely grey eyes met his own, Harry felt reassured as they shared a small smile before tucking in to their breakfasts noticing Neville and Blaise do the same.
‘Oh wait, it gets better,’ and with that he leaned over , picked up Draco’s pendant and touched it to his own, Draco gasped , before his eyes the snake started to move, while he watched the serpent protectively wrapped itself around  the sword, finally laying its head on the hilt of the sword. Draco’ mouth dropped open.
Snape’s eyebrows rose although the rest of face remained unmoved . Hearing his Godson calling Potter Harry had surprised him even more than finding him beneath the third floor with the three Gryffindors. He had questions but, seeing the look on his Godson’s face he decided to put the boy out of his misery first,
Draco stared at Harry for a few seconds before he realised why the boy was suddenly shouting at him;
As he watched he noticed Harry silently mouthing something under his breath, then a long pause as the hold school seemed to collectively hold it’s breath ...
‘In your dreams Weasel,’ he yelled back, ‘bet you dream about me a lot don’t you,’ he smirked, sneaking a look at Harry as he did this, he needed to get to him soon. Ron was as red as his hair, he jumped out of his seat and glared at Draco;
Over the next few weeks everything seemingly continued as normal. Hermione and Draco took their usual turns at getting Harry to study for his exams. Harry, however was becoming increasingly distracted by the thought of The Philosopher’s Stone. His scar had been aching constantly since the night  in the forest and as the weeks had gone by the pain had slowly began to increase.
The booming voice of Hagrid filled the air and broke the tension with an almost audible snap. The class mumbled amongst themselves unsure about what they had just witnessed, Theo Nott  was rubbing his elbow and muttering mutinously under his breath and Hermione and Pansy were, to Ron’s  shock, exchanging amused glances.
As if by magic Neville sat up, rubbing his eyes sleepily, and nodded. ‘Traitor,’ Blaise grumbled good naturedly, wrapping a long arm around Neville’s waist and pulling him back down on to the bed. ‘Sleep now, presents later yeah,’ Blaise sleepily mumbled. Draco had had enough, he got out of bed and stomped over towards the sleepy pair, he grabbed hold of their blankets and in one swift tug had pulled them off the bed and on to the floor. Before Draco had time to take a step backwards Blaise jumped up and threw himself at Draco narrowly missing the blonde, who squeaked indignantly and ran to hide behind his boyfriend who had just climbed from the bed and was currently laughing loudly at the two Slytherins, ‘Malfoy, I swear to god.’ Blaise seethed under his breath. Harry valiantly stood his ground between the two boys causing Draco to smirk at his friend over the Gryffindor’s shoulder. Blaise growled and made another lunge at Draco when Neville spoke from behind him, ‘We are up now Blaise we should just do presents.’ At hearing Neville’s voice Blaise stopped trying to get at Draco and with a final growl in his direction he turned and followed the small boy over to the Christmas tree. Draco chuckled, ‘Big Blaisey tamed by an ickle Gryffindor who would have guessed.’ Harry gave Draco a warning glare as they walked over to the tree, Draco promptly stopped speaking but the irony was not lost on anyone.
year Draco had kept himself to himself, wandering from lesson to lesson with his head down. He just wanted to get his qualifications and move on. That was until he had laid eyes on him.
Draco felt himself tense at the admission, looking away quickly to cover his shock, had he heard correctly? He felt the flutter of hope from earlier steadily making its way back up, ‘Gay?’ he repeated almost as a question, Harry nodded, ‘Gay as the day is long, Draco wished he had a drink of something as suddenly his mouth had gone very dry. The silence hung for a minute between the two of them creating a thick tension in the air, Draco needed to break it, he turned once more to Harry ‘So, do you still want to see it?’
Harry sat up with a start, he turned his head to glare at the blond at is side ‘C’mon Drake you know full well that he does he can’t stand the sight of me.’ Harry huffed and crossed his arms across his chest as though in an act of defiance, Draco smirked and reached out with his left hand and pulled Harry back in to his arms by his collar, he wrapped his arm around the smaller boy pulling him back against his chest;  ‘Behave Potter, you are not a child.’ This caused Harry to huff and stick out his bottom lip, ‘actually Drake I think you’ll find I am,’ Draco laughed at the petulant display, after a second or two Harry relented and gave Draco a little dig with his elbow before continuing; ‘ seriously though I grew up as a muggle, I have no bloody idea what these subjects are, Divination, what the hell is that?’
‘Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?’ said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl. ‘Never thought you’d like fat little cry babies, Parvati.’
That bumbling idiot Longbottom had fallen off his broom and by the looks of it broken his arm, ‘wonderful’ thought Draco sarcastically, cut our lesson with Harry short, I will never forgive you for this he thought as he watched Neville being taken to the Hospital Wing through narrowed eyes.
‘I don’t know, because I’m telling the truth, because I love you, you love me.’ Harry took another tentative step forward and this time Draco allowed it. ‘Drake, tell me what’s happened please, who has said something, what has made you think this?’
‘Anything for Master Malfoy of the noble house of Black,’ came the reply along with another deep bow., ‘and for Master Harry?’
Blaise raised an eyebrow across the dorm at Draco as if seeking permission to reply, Draco inclined his head slightly and Blaise spelled out the word
Draco was sat waiting for Harry with his back pressed against the cold stone wall of the Trophy room, legs bent at the knees and elbows resting on them as he traced the arc of his pendant as it moved across the floor following Harry’s movements throughout the castle. He had been watching it’s movements for a few minutes when, suddenly the pendant stood on end and Draco jumped to his feet, grabbing the pendant as he did so eyes darting all around but not finding Harry, ‘Harry are you here?’
Hermione rolled her eyes, ‘Malfoy is not the heir of Slytherin Ronald.’ Ron’s jaw dropped: ‘ You too, has he cursed you both?’
Hermione noticed the change in her friend’s demeanour almost immediately. The haunted look he seemed to favour was gone; in its place were bright, wide eyes and an inviting smile. She looked up at him, ‘You seem chirpier,’ a hint of inquisitiveness in her voice.  Harry smiled as he sat down to her left, Ron leaned forward around his girlfriend, toast in mouth, to see what she was talking about, eyes widening at the blinding smile Harry offered him.  He nodded in acknowledgement, leant back and continued his mastication, seemingly nonplussed by the changes. Hermione rolled her eyes and turned to face Harry once more as he replied, ‘ I’ve decided to have a positive outlook on it, it will happen,’ he looked searchingly around the room, ‘somewhere in here could be the person that makes me as happy as you make Ron.’  Hermione couldn’t help but beam at that as tears filled her hazel eyes.
Before Ron could reply Hermione stormed down the stairs from her dorm in to the common room, ‘What the hell is going on?’ she demanded
Harry stared for a second before putting his head back down and mumbling ‘I’m fine in to his pillow.’
‘Oh do we quiet Weasley there are more important things going on here, Harry is there anything missing.’
Draco lay on his bed listening to the horrific sounds of snoring coming from the bed next to him. For Christ’s sake he thought ‘I’ll be seeing Father about this, I’m Draco Fucking Malfoy I shouldn’t have to share with these bloody buffoons. Ugh he’d have to remember to send an owl to his father in the morning, but for now, he had something else to think about, he was getting to spend some time with Harry, some time where he could just be himself and he couldn’t wait.
Harry blinked, ‘Erm does someone want to tell me what on earth is going on?’ Hermione sat up and wiped her eyes with the back of one of her hands . ‘Oh Harry, it’s amazing, you’ve found your song, I thought you’d missed it, but you’ve not, you’ve found it,’ Harry’s eyebrows rose at Hermione’s unusual ramblings, ‘Mione I love you but you need to explain to me what exactly it is you are going on about?’ In the blink of an eye, as though a switch had been flicked, Hermione was back to her usual studious mode. ‘Oh, I’m so sorry Harry , I totally forgot you’d have no idea, it’s not something people ever talk about really, it can be a touchy subject, it’s not considered polite really in case someone was missed, obviously being brought up by Muggles didn’t help the matter.’ Whilst Hermione had been talking she had been rummaging around in her ever present school bag, ‘ Here,’ she said removing one of the oldest and dustiest books Harry had ever seen and, being best friends with Hermione meant that he had seen more than his fair share of old, dusty books. Hermione flicked through the pages until she found what she was looking for, ‘Here,’ she repeated, passing him the tome, ‘read this.’ She tapped her finger on the page, pointing out the relevant passage. Harry looked at Ron who simply nodded, so Harry read:
Ron’s head snapped round as he glared at Zabini, who simply gazed levelly at him until he turned his head.
Draco had closed his eyes as Harry’s fingers continued to trace across his skin, it felt like he was being hit repeatedly with a Rennervate, each touch like a renewed charge of energy, he had never felt so alive, without thinking her took a step closer finding himself nestled in the ‘V’ of Harry’s legs,  he didn’t think the situation could get any better but then Harry had spoken. The words, hissed in Parseltounge, had wrapped themselves around Draco like a warming charm, heating every part of his skin that it touched, prickling and almost sizzling with heat; he wanted more, much more, ‘Say it again please.’ Draco felt as though he was almost begging as Harry looked up at him.
Ron was paired with Hermione who had left him with strict instructions on how to prepare the ingredients while she made the potion. He glared at the spiders legs in front of them as though they had personally offended him and stabbed at them with his knife. Suddenly, right before his eyes two of the spiders legs jumped up and started dancing across the desk, the seemed to be marching to and fro, throwing in the occasional high kick for good measure. Ron was frozen in fear, he quickly glanced around the room and noticed that Malfoy was staring right at him, he knew it, he knew this was to do with him, the foul git he would get him for this. Whilst he was glaring at Draco he noticed the Slytherin incline his head back towards his desk, Ron whipped his head back around and screamed with fear as he jumped out of his stool, the spider’s legs were all moving towards him, creeping slowly across the desk as though converging on him, he needed to move, to get away, he ran from the classroom, shoving Hermione to the floor in his haste to leave the room. Red faced Ron ran from the classroom leaving behind a room of very confused but highly amused students.
Draco saw Ron’s red hair before he saw Harry, he hurried in their direction relived when he finally lay eyes on his boyfriend, he took a minute to admire Harry from behind, he couldn’t help but notice how nicely he had filled out over summer, even though he was skin and bones Draco could still see the fine figure of a man Harry was becoming.
They talked well past curfew and in to the night, backs against the wall, Harry’s head resting on Draco’s shoulder. They began to grow tired and eventually Harry began to yawn.
Harry nodded silently, ‘I can help you,’ Neville stated and before Harry could say anything Neville was up and across the room at his own bed pulling what looked like an old piece of parchment and a quill from beneath his pillow. He returned to Harry, ‘Budge over,’ he said, Harry shuffled over to allow Neville to sit next to him, both boys were now sat cross legged leaning against Harry’s headboard. Harry looked at the parchment in Neville’s lap and raised a confused eyebrow, ‘Watch,’ Neville instructed. With that instruction he drew his knees up in front of him to allow him to lean on them as he began to write on the parchment in front of him:
‘Thinks he’s something does old scarhead, but fighting a troll jeez he’s gonna get flattened.’ Laughed a curly haired girl.
Harry had never believed he would meet a boy that confused him as much as Draco Malfoy. First year Gryffindor’s only had Potions with the Slytherins, deep down Harry secretly thought that they didn’t get to see them enough. Just then something caught his eye. There was a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room. Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be together.
Ron had filled his parchment with tiny doodles of snitches and Chudley Canon logos when he felt the tickling begin on his shin, absent-mindedly he began to rub his shin with the toes of the other foot but the tickling increased and soon it had spread to the other shin, glancing down Ron’s heart stopped. Due to the warmer weather Ron had forgone his robes so had a clear view of his shoes and climbing over his shoes were eight tiny spiders that were crawling up his socks and up the legs of his trousers, Ron was terrified. He shoved his chair back so hard he slammed in to Harry’s table behind him winding the raven-haired boy, Ron jumped to his feet and began jumping up and down, whimpers were escaping from his lips as McGonagol turned to see what the commotion was about;
‘A muggle game?’ Draco asked sounding only slightly affronted that he had been asked to play a muggle game.
‘Dray, thank God I was so worried,’ Harry threw himself  in to his boyfriend’s arms, he wrapped his arms around the thin shoulders and hugged Draco close to him as though he was finding comfort from feeling the blond’s heart beating against his chest. Draco returned the hug for a moment relishing in the heat resonating from Harry’s body before lightly pushing Harry away. ‘Me too,’ he whispered placing a light kiss to the other boys lips,’ but I’m glad we are all here safe, and we have so much to talk about, so much to figure out, we need to help Hermione.’ Harry nodded and opened his mouth as if to say something but was interrupted by a sound from behind them;
The blond head shot up in response; ‘what, no of course not, you deserve every happiness, the life and family you have now could not go to a more deserving person.’
Draco witnessed the interchange and he too felt a warm sensation, this boy, Harry, had been upset about a remark made against him. Wow! He thought.  Goyle shifted bu his side and Draco came to his senses, the red head had laughed at him , his friends stood anxiously waiting. He had a show to put on.
Harry followed Neville in to the spacious room that had just appeared from nowhere and looked around. They had walked in to a large well lit room decorated in neutral colours, various tones of beiges, browns and subtle gold’s threaded throughout. On one wall there was a large fire place surrounded by a huge ornate mantle, there was currently a brilliant fire burning in the grate throwing shadows across the walls around them. In front of the fire was a luxurious cream woollen rug that looked comfortable enough to lie on. On either side of the rug stood two overly large brown sofas littered with plump cushions, they looked ridiculously comfortable and Harry just wanted to try them out. The room was elegant and yet comfortable at the same time. But Harry’s wide eyes were drawn to the corner of the large room, there, reaching up to the ceiling was a beautiful Christmas Tree, its base as wide as its height, it was shimmering and glittering with fairy lights and candles, gold, red, green and silver baubles filled every available space as if the tree was making a nod to their house colours. Harry stood in awe, where had Neville found this place? As if reading his find he heard Draco clear his throat;
The snake was only shaded in black and grey but somehow that made it look alive, standing out in stark contrast against Draco’s pale skin. Without stopping to think about what he was doing Harry reached out to touch, startled to feel the smooth skin beneath his fingertips, as though almost expecting to feel the smooth scales of the snake.
Sitting against his headboard, knees pulled up, reading his Charms textbook was the student who was fast becoming the bane of his life, Theodore Nott. Theo chose that moment to look up and the two boys locked eyes. Draco offered a curt nod, which was returned with a smirk, before he walked over to his bed. Pulling his curtains round him Draco opened the parchment and attempted to dampen the panic that began to rise within him as he read the untidy scrawl before him. Not even his boyfriend could get in to that much trouble alone in the castle for a few hours surely.
Harry’s face lit up, ‘You sure?  That’s great.’ Harry said with a smile as he walked over and slid down the wall to sit next to Draco.
‘It worked,’ Harry confirmed.  Harry lifted his head up and carefully pressed his own lips to Draco’s cheek. A pink tinge rose to meet them causing Harry to chuckle.
It was a magnificent  mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet . There was an inscription cared around the top:
‘and me’ interrupted Blaise Zabini who was sitting across from them and apparently had heard every word. ‘Okay,’  he said after a moment, ‘but not here though.’
Harry smiled, ‘I know Ginny, I love you too you know.’ He leaned over and pressed a light kiss to her cheek, ‘Do you want another drink?’
Draco approached the lake and spotted the blanket laid out at the side of it, in the centre was a small black jewellery box, he knelt on the blanket and picked up the box after a while he opened it and gasped at what it contained. The box held a dazzling pendant on a silver chain, a silver dragon curled protectively around an emerald , the emerald shone brightly in the morning sun,making the beautiful green shine brightly in his eyes. Draco thought it was beautiful and wanted to put it on right away but the folded parchment beneath it caught his eye:
The rain was now falling so thickly it looked like sheets falling from the sky and Draco’s nerves were in shreds, the players were racing around the sky with abandon colliding in midair more than was usual, he could only begin to imagine the injuries that were being sustained. Draco watched his boyfriend, who was merely a blur in the distance, narrowly avoid injury and felt his last nerve fray. Before it could snap entirely a time out was called and the Gryffindor team landed on the pitch. Draco had absolutely no idea what the score was and frankly didn’t care as long as Harry was ok.
‘I really did die that night, that night you all thought me dead but one of the things that brought me back, that made the decision easy was the thought of seeing you again, ‘
Harry smiled at his friend and nodded, well used to the red-head’s behaviour regarding food, ‘Yeah mate, all good.’ Ron grinned around his fork and continued on with his meal. Once again left to his own thoughts Harry wondered how he was going to find his soul mate. Somewhere out there was the other half of him; the person who would make his whole, perhaps even fill the void that had been a gaping hole in his chest for as long as he could remember. Harry sighed again; he really needed someone to talk to.
Draco sniffed at the eloquence not moving from his relaxed position, arms crossed loosely across his chest, but he felt anything but, the flitter of a million snitches filled his stomach as he watched the man in front of him try and compose himself. Draco was unsure what he was doing here, why Potter had come over but it was what he had wanted after all. He sure as Salazar wasn’t going to turn him away.
Draco rolled his eyes, ‘Of course we are you idiot but I swear to all that is magical if that ginger bint ever so much as looks in your direction I will not be held .........
Draco smirked again, so the only thing Harry was upset about was being called Potter, not the kiss comment, that was good to know, ‘ Sorry Harry I’ll behave.’
Draco silently seethed. What the fuck as wrong with him? He was one boy, one skinny boy, why the hell did he care if one skinny kid didn’t want to be his friend???
If it wasn't for the look of pure fear on Harry's face Draco would have laughed, stopping was the furthest thing from his mind, along with hating Harry. He reached out a hand and took hold of Harry's chin gently tilting it so that he could see the boy's face, 'SSh no it's ok, I don't want you to get off, I mean...' Suddenly Draco found himself at a loss for words he really didn't know what to say,' I mean... it's ok if you want to,' he tried again '.. move I mean... I mean get off.' Draco had never felt so flustered in his whole life, this was ridiculous, he knew what he wanted, what he wanted to say but he didn't want to scare Harry.
Harry’s grip on Draco’s hand tightened  as he looked in to Draco’s silver eyes he was trying to say that he understood, he understood so much more then the Slytherin could know. Draco felt Harry’s hand squeeze and was immediately glad he had shared. He squeezed back as he looked in to Harry’s eyes, unknown to the small boy he had seen his bruises and he knew that Harry understood.
‘Listen mate are you sure about this, I mean are you sure you have not been cursed or something, I mean I’m sure Hermione will check one last time.’
Draco very nearly hugged the girl there and then but caught himself just in time, there was, however, the suggestion of a smile on his face.
Draco stopped in front of the first greenhouse feeling slightly stupid, there were several large greenhouses and he had no idea where to start, he crossed his arms across his chest and pouted, causing the Gryfinddor hidden nearby to stifle a chuckle. Draco was intelligent Harry knew he would get it, so he waited. He watched as the Slytherin tapped his foot seemingly impatient with himself, suddenly his head snapped up and there was a triumphant gleam in his eye and he stalked of in the direction of the second greenhouse.
Draco groaned and ran his hand over his face, he did not like that Harry’s fate was in the hands of the Weasel and the clones, but, he conceded that anything was better than his relatives. Draco handed the parchment to Blaise who read it with a raised eyebrow, he handed the note to Pansy and watched as her expression mirrored his own. Pansy sighed and looked at Blaise, ‘Sleepover?’ she asked
Harry noticed Draco going slightly pink and chuckling to himself, quickly changed the subject. ‘Oh wait there is something else.’  Harry went to move, then realised he was still attached to Draco.
Draco stared at Harry, what was this about? Does Harry hate him now? Then he caught the twinkle in those green eyes, what was he up to now?
Harry did not want this to end in a fight and turned to look at Oliver who was slowly turning red, ‘Let them have the pitch , I want breakfast and obviously they need the practice more than us,’ he said with a small smile.
Harry groaned and banged his head on the table. Hermione stifled a giggle and Draco raised an eyebrow.
The two boys sat in silence for what seemed like an eternity. The silence was comfortable and neither felt the need to break it. The room grew warm around them as they each contemplated what their next move might be.
As Hagrid led the Hippogriff over by his chain, Draco literally had to bite his tongue in order to stop himself shouting out. Seeing the creature so close to Harry was giving him palpitations. What in Merlin’s  name made his volunteer? Draco was sure it was out of some misguided affection for the half-giant.
Suddenly and without warning, Hermione leapt at them both wrapping an arm around each one of their necks. Draco stiffened further as the muggle-born hugged him, he could hear his father’s voice in his head, he would be so angry if he could see this. Draco was glad it was so dark.
Seamus licked his lips and tasted the salt of the sweat that lined his top lip. He pushed a hand roughly through his dark hair, damp from exertion, and let out a growl that curled up right from the pit of his stomach.  He slid his hand up the slick back beneath him and wrapped his fist tightly in the nest of dark hair, ‘fuck,’ he whispered and thrust forward in to the pliant body beneath him, ‘you’re fucking perfect.’ The Gryffindor beneath him let out a low whine and pushed back, ‘you’re not so bad yourself Shay.
Professor Snape began writing the days ingredients on the board when he heard a whimper come from a table behind him, he slowly turned his head and raised his head at the Gryffindor responsible for the noise, ‘Is there a problem Weasley?’
Draco and Ron watched from a distance, neither were sure what to do, neither had seen Neville like this before, they didn't understand what was happening but knew they should stay out of the way for now.
Draco shook his head and sank in to the arm chair opposite his godfather, all of the etiquette of his upbringing left him as he bodily deflated, as though he no longer had the strength to hold himself upright. He buried his head in his hands as silent tears began to fall. He had never been more grateful to have Severus so close at hand, the man had not seen him cry since he was a child but he just couldn’t help himself.
‘Morning,’ Blaise mouthed back, still staring back at Draco as though challenging him to comment on his unusual sleeping position.Draco winked and inclined his head slightly towards Harry, ‘should we wake them?’ he mouthed.
The sight that greeted them sucked the air out of their lungs. There, on the floor of the dark forest was the gleaming white body of a dead unicorn. Harry had never seen anything so sad and so beautiful. Harry had taken a step towards it when a slithering sound made him freeze, tightening his grip on Draco.
‘But I got him in to trouble, I don’t want him to hate me, but I know he will.’ Harry whined.  Hermione looked to her friend and noted the anguish on his face. She took pity on him and wrapped her arm around his shoulders.
Draco threw his arms out again and spun on one foot, he heard the tinkle of a bottle rolling away from him and a smash as it hit the wall. He felt as though he could feel every shard of glass, a metaphor for his life, breaking in to a million tiny pieces whilst people around him carried on without a care in the world. He opened his eyes and looked around him, the party was winding down and he was one of the only few people still dancing, he never wanted to stop; he enjoyed feeling his life blood pounding through his veins this way. He spread his arms out and spun around, kicking a stray stiletto from his path as he went; if this was as good as it got he would have to take it.
The music had now been turned off and a few party goers had started to stumble back to their respective dorms but the night was still young, there were people still scattered around laughing and joking, sitting or lying over various miscellaneous pieces of furniture. Harry looked around and sighed, this really wasn’t working for him.
Draco was just about to hand the diary back over dismissing it as rubbish when he noticed something that made his heart drop in to his stomach. Ginny Weasley was staring at the diary he held in his hand, her gaze occasionally flicking back to Harry and she looked absolutely terrified. Draco felt sick, he didn’t know what to think, in his hand he held a diary that he knew nothing about, a secret Harry had kept from him, something that possibly contained Harry’s inner most thoughts and feelings and the She Weasel was looking at it with absolute fear in her eyes. She looked as though she was terrified that a massive secret was about to be revealed, a secret to do with the diary, Harry’s diary. Draco looked at the diary in his hand, it felt heavy all of a sudden like it had suddenly turned to lead. He glanced at Ginny who, in turn was looking at Harry, he bristled internally and turned to look at his boyfriend who was now standing staring expectantly at him, hand out waiting for the diary. Draco caught Harry’s eye and noticed the slight fear in those too. Draco felt sick, it was obvious Harry was hiding something, something that the She Weasel knew all about, he had trusted Harry, more than anyone ever and it looked as though the She Weasel had managed to steal him. He desperately wanted to read the diary, to read what these two so obviously wanted to hide from him. He needed to see it with his own eyes, see the betrayal in black and white.
Draco was in the middle of a deep conversation with Moaning Myrtle, buttering her up enough to convince her to share the details of her death, she was just pointing out the exact sink where it happened when Harry burst in to the bathroom followed by Ron and Neville, who, inexplicably, were dragging Professor Lockheart between them.
The four boys met in the Trophy Room and before Neville could speak Draco snapped, ‘Well what is it?’
‘Draco,’ Harry said, as he stopped laughing, ‘ They all knew I was in your bed already, they watched me get in.’ Harry said to the astonished Slytherin.
‘Weasley did this?’ Draco seethed. Harry nodded and Draco fought to keep in his rage under control knowing it would do Harry know favours right now. ‘ Why?’ he hissed.
Draco sighed and, once again  traced an invisible line across the table top in front of him. ‘Thing is Pans, he looks happy.’
‘Wonder what Potter’s written in this?’ he said quietly as he laid his hand on the cover as though to open it. He caught Harry’s eyes and watched them widen in disbelief that Draco would do that. Draco really didn’t want to but he felt so utterly betrayed and devastated that his rules when it came to Harry had flown out of the window. He could not seem to think straight and it was almost a relief when Percy Weasley spoke to him ordering him to hand the diary back. Draco didn’t want to, he refused, he wanted to read the diary so badly.
‘It’s in my trunk,’ he hissed again at Blaise, ‘Give me yours,’ Draco thrust his hand out expectantly.
‘ I can talk to him at Christmas,’ as Draco spoke he noticed a look of sorrow crossing Harry’s face, ‘You ok?’
He jumped up and strode over to Harry, he was there in a second, he looked down at him slumped over the desk;
Draco huffed and shifted the strap of his bag further up his shoulder, Pansy was at his side wittering on and on about her summer, he wasn’t really listening, preferring instead to let his mind wander and his eyes rove as he looked for the dark head of his boyfriend. He was trying to be a good friend but she had been going on since before they left the castle and showed no signs of letting up and, if he didn’t know any better he would have sworn he heard Weasley’s  name more than once.
He had just given up looking and was about to engage in conversation with Pansy when he spotted Harry, just one look at the boy and his mouth went dry, that hair would be his undoing he could feel it, t was wild and unruly  and all Draco wanted to do was tangle his fingers in it, pull Harry close and kiss him until they gasped for breath. He needed to be careful, his body was beginning to stir at the thought of having the smaller boy pressed tightly against him, he watched as Harry walked towards the group, laughing carelessly at something Hermione was saying, his school shirt pulled tight across his body and Draco  longed to see, to feel what was hiding underneath. He knew himself what a Seeker’s  body looked like and he wanted to see Harry’s.  He knew Harry wasn’t ready yet but it didn’t stop him dreaming,  imagining  running his hands all over that....
‘Well, not only did it appear in my tea leaves in Divination,’ he swallowed, ‘ I have seen it in real life, more than once,’ Harry studied Draco’s face for any reaction or signs of disbelief, when he saw none he continued, ‘ each time, as soon as I saw it, something really bad happened to me, like I saw it the other day just before I fell from the broom.’ Harry sighed and leaned his head back against the wall behind him, ‘Do you think I am doomed? Do you think it will follow me around until the day I die?’
Harry smiled and lay back down, he was lucky to have Ron, and well, knowing Hermione she already knew too and he didn’t care what anyone else thought, well, no that was a lie, there was a certain blonde haired Slytherin who’s reaction mattered very much to him.
Ron rolled his eyes at the Harry dreamy tone catching a glimpse of Pansy as he did, she’d  changed a lot over summer, losing some of the roundness from her face and slowly gaining the body of a woman. They’d  exchanged a few friendly owls over the summer but Ron was looking forward to talking to her again, he became aware of Hermione watching him with a raised eyebrow, he cleared his throat and sent his girlfriend  a warm smile, she smiled back watching Ron turn away before she sent a questioning look over her shoulder towards the Slytherin table.
When Harry finally spotted Hermione she was staring in disgust at the pile of books in front of her. Harry took this to mean that she had still had no luck in finding out any useful information. He slumped down opposite her, groaning as he put his head in his arms on the table, he dropped his bag and gave it a good kick for good measure.
They fell backwards – Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran as fast as they could. They didn’t stop running until they reached the staircase that separated the Gryffindor tower and the Slytherin dungeons. They stopped and finally let go of one another’s hands, neither wanted to leave.
Before anyone could answer, a burst of golden light filled the tunnel, momentarily blinding its occupants, when they looked again the rock wall was gone, They leapt to their feet and rushed forward in to the light.
‘Hey scarhead why are you hitting yourself,’ he sneered across the Great Hall. Harry stared at him and Draco noticed the pleading look in his eyes, he needed him, Draco needed a way to get to Harry.
Harry caught Neville’s eye a second before they both looked over to where Ron’s bed stood empty. The glaring orange blanket untouched as Ron’s heroics had landed him an overnight stay in the hospital wing. Thinking back over the past few months, certain moments stood out, clear as day, looks exchanged, sudden and unexplained blushing. Then there was yesterday, the look in Ron’s eyes as the Hippogriff had reared towards Pansy, the fear and protection he saw there was something he understood all too well, he had seen the look in Draco’s eyes, directed at himself,  on more than one occasion.
The blond carded his hands through his hair with a sigh, ‘I found my soul song.’ The hurt and desperation evident in the younger man’s tone momentarily confused Severus, surely this was a happy occasion? He looked over at his young charge and voiced this thougth; ‘My apologies Draco but I always assumed that this was a happy event.’
As Draco woke he noticed Harry’s arm wrapped tightly around him. Harry was in his bed, when did that happen? His curtains were open, had he not closed them? He looked at the room around him from his vantage point in the corner. The others were beginning to stir and Draco began to panic, he felt his heart racing and his hands grew clammy as he struggled to catch his breath. What would they say if they saw Harry? He dreaded to think what Harry’s friends would say, what the hell would Blaise think? He looked over and saw Weasley looking at him from his bed, he looked concerned, he was for it now. Draco’s panic attack began to worsen, ‘Harry!’ Weasley shouted, Draco flinched, this would not be good, he heard Harry grumble behind him, ‘Harry!’ Ron shouted again more urgently as he jumped from his bed. Draco was slowly losing the ability to breathe and he panicked more and more, the lions around him were rising, he was dead, what had Harry been thinking?, ‘Harry!’ Ron almost screamed again, Harry shot up, ‘Now he’ll see ,’ thought Draco, ’he’ll be mortified,’ was the blondes last thought as he began to hyperventilate. ‘What Ron?’ Harry asked grumpily.
Severus steepled his fingers, resting his elbows on the arm of the chair, his fingertips meeting at his chin, but still he did not speak knowing that Draco would in his own time. He was concerned when he realised his godson was crying but knew not to push the young man before him. Draco swallowed and sat up a little straighter in an effort to compose himself, ‘Can I ask a personal question?’
Harry sighed and stepped closer to Draco who stiffened at the movement causing Harry to stop in his tracks ; ‘Why do you think I am cheating?’
Draco took Harry’s hand, neither boy having to think about it and stepped around the large tree that was in front of them.
Harry chuckled as Draco continued, ‘I’ll be going up against you, I can’t wait to beat you to the snitch.’
Draco felt that his brain had short-circuited, he moved his hands experimentally and was rewarded by Harry moaning into his mouth. The sound alone shot electric current throughout his entire body, this was pure bliss, he lowered his hands more given them freedom to explore an area previously untouched thanking every deity he knew and then some that Harry had decided not to wear jeans today. The tension inside him was building as he gave in to instinct and pulled Harry towards him lifting himself up to join him as he did so. The sensation shot straight to his groin and he repeated to movement over and over again. The two boys eventually found a rhythm as they moved together. Draco knew it wasn’t going to last much longer but the night was young as so were they.
‘Listen Potter,’ Malfoy began, he was running his fingers nervously around the side of his tea-cup, not quite looking at Harry, ‘I just wanted to well, I just wanted to apologise, for everything, you know.’
Harry sat back on his knees, still keeping a tight hold of Draco’s hand. He watched Draco intently as he replied, ‘Not a lot if I’m honest, I’d never even heard of him until this summer, but what I do know is that he is after me, he’s trying to kill me.’
‘Harry, they saw you, in my bed, Weasley saw you with your arms around me, he was screaming at you, he’s going to kill you.’ Draco said quietly, he didn’t want to Harry to lose his friends. To his surprise Harry started laughing.
‘I am fully aware of the consequences of my actions should they be discovered, however, they will not, and you should know that I am fully aware of your quite obvious dislike of Harry and your attempts to harm him’ Draco said as he looked directly in to the eyes of his Godfather.
Harry took a moment before replying, 'it felt nice, different, but nice, that's what made me do it again.' Draco nodded, again he was unsure of what to say that would not break the charged moment they were both sharing.  During the conversation the hardness in his trousers had almost gone but then Harry moved again, that one tiny movement sent a spark straight to the tip. It was not lost of Draco that he was rock hard and his dick was pressed against the firm buttocks of his boyfriend. He knew if Harry continued this would only end one way, 'Harry, if you carry on, there is a chance I might, you know?' It took Harry a second and Draco saw the moment that it hit him, the look of realisation and even a little fear crossed Harry's face. 'Ok, so erm,' Harry looked down at his fingers, 'so do you want me to stop?' Draco shook his head and took hold of Harry's hands, he swallowed hard and looked Harry in the eye, 'if it's ok with you it's ok with me?'
‘Where the hell are we?’ Pansy was stood, just beyond the threshold of the room and her question had been barely louder than a whisper.
So Harry filled Ron in (carefully omitting Draco’s part) on the three-headed dog and about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.
‘Oh, so you wandered around the grounds, I mean I can see why you did but I’m not sure that it was such a good idea on your own, what is the Dementors had been around? You really ought to be more careful Harry.’
They sprinted down the long gallery swinging around a doorstop and galloped down one corridor then another. Just then Peeves the pesky school ghost appeared in front of them, if he saw them they were done for. Harry dropped Draco’s hand knowing that the blonde boy would never live it down if he was seen. Draco felt the absence in his warm palm and it made him sad, god knows why but now was not the time to wonder what the hell that was all about. He grabbed Harry’s hand again and ran in a different direction. The two boys ran for their lives, straight in to a locked door.
At this Draco’s head snapped up, ‘ That was something I’ve been meaning to mention, I did not know that muggles had house elves, and why on earth was it stealing your post?’
A million thoughts raced through Draco’s mind crashing together in confusion as the blonde boy tried his best to make sense of them. ‘Had Harry regretted his kiss? Worse, does he regret the friendship? Was he laughing with his friends now knowing that Draco was waiting for him? Was he being ridiculous? Had Harry been caught? Was he in trouble? No, he had his cloak back, he could not have been caught.’
Harry turned slightly to his side so that he could see Draco’s face better, his fringe was falling across his face and into his eyes. Without thinking Harry reached out and brushed the blond hair back from Draco’s face.
Harry loved coming to the kitchens, it was his escape, the warm comfort it brought reminded him of the Weasley’s kitchen, somewhere he felt safe and secure. He began to walk over to the table when there was a loud pop and Kreacher appeared before him.  ‘What can Kreacher do for Master?’ the elf asked, bowing so low his long nose scraped the floor.
'Prefects to me' Professor Snape snapped in clipped tones. The two seventh years crossed the room and were at his side in seconds, a hushed but hurried conversation ensued which cumulated in the entirety of Slytherin house exiting the common room and walking single file through the dungeons towards the Great Hall.
Draco felt the music change, a song he knew, one he loved in fact. The fire of the whiskey, pumped in his veins, he had nothing left to lose. He had nothing left, no reputation, and no home.
Flint was currently arguing  with the Gryffindor team captain and waving around a piece of parchment that Snape had signed allowing them use of the pitch. Before he knew it  Draco was being pushed to the front of the team to be shown off as the new Slytherin seeker. He met his own Gryffindor’s eyes and they shared a small smile before becoming aware of the chaos around them. Harry flinched as Draco’s father was brought in to the conversation and watched as a dark look crossed his friends eyes reminding him of gathering storm clouds. Before anyone else could speak Ron barrelled his way across the pitch, ‘ What’s happening? Why aren’t you playing? What’s he doing here??’ Ron spluttered as he stared red faced at Draco, Harry rolled his eyes, ‘ He’s the new Slytherin Seeker.’
At his outburst Hermione had turned to look at him feeling slightly offended and a little upset, Ron met her eyes and winced, he was such an idiot sometimes.
The world was ringed with a fuzzy edge, everything he looked at was slightly blurred and out of focus and he loved it, his head felt free, his mind too blurred to concentrate on his messed up life any more. He risked another glance at Potter, returning, like a dutiful boyfriend, with a new drink for the Weaselette. A worthy adversary indeed, he mock bowed in her direction, his drink swilling and slopping over on to the floor at his feet. He began to move his hips in time with the music, he closed his eyes and imagined Potter was watching him, wanting him and he began to dance properly, letting the music take over, throwing his head back and running his hands down his chest, he felt sensual and, for the first time in a long time he felt alive. The beat filled his head and he moved in time, he gave his everything; it was all he had left to give.
He was rewarded with a shove in the shoulder, ‘ Hey don’t call me Potter, you sound evil when you say that, Potter is for in front of people
He stood up, eyes blazing with barely surpressed fury, 'His life is over, everything he is and was, gone in a second, how is that ok?' He advanced on his unmoving boyfriend, 'His memories Blaise, his family, his parents, does he have children? Will he remember their faces? Will he remember kissing them goodnight?' Neville's shoulders were heaving with exhaustion, Blaise remained unmoving at his feet.
The tension between the two grew as nobody moved to break the prolonged eye contact and Draco began to react to his boyfriend sitting in his lap, Draco saw the moment that Harry noticed what was happening and watched the boy intently to see how he would react.
The whispering grew louder as Ron drew closer to Pansy, it felt as though every eye in the hall was on him in fact, he reasoned, it probably was . As he drew nearer he could see nervousness tinged with something else in Pansy’s eyes but she didn't turn away.  He came to a stop in front of her and drew in a breath for courage, “hey" Ron heard several audible gasps from behind him at just that one word. He swallowed hard and drew up all his Gryffindor courage as Pansy turned to Draco in a silent pleas for support. The blond Slytherin merely shrugged and turned away in a show if indifference that belied his inner turmoil, if Weasley  had approached in public it must be bad.
Ok so I have a favour to ask. Who remembers Harry’s Christmas gift to Draco; a snow-white lion cub? Well he’s going to feature quite a bit in POA and perhaps from then on and he needs a name, so I have decided to ask my readers for ideas? What do you think I should name him?
Harry sat up, crossing his legs in front of him as he did, staring in the general direction of Ron’s bed.
Draco lay on his bed, arms behind his head wishing he could see Harry tonight, but, as always, he had put the Gryffindor first, Harry needed his sleep so he didn’t  fall off his broom tomorrow. Draco chuckled to himself, he couldn’t wait to see Harry in action.
Harry had felt Draco freeze at his side as the tall, imposing figure of Lucius entered Hagrid’s cabin. He carefully reached back to give Draco’s hand a supportive squeeze and was relieved to feel a squeeze in return. He could not imagine how Draco felt being this close to his abusive father, he leaned back against Draco and felt the Slytherin place his forehead to the nape of Harry’s neck. It was almost as though Draco did not want to see his father, but he could hear him and is fist clenched in Harry’s as he realised what Lucius was there for. The fist did not unclench until Dumbledore has left his parting message and vanished in to thin air.
Ron had not even noticed how close they were sitting to Draco until Draco accidently knocked the back of his head. Both boys were tense as they waited to see Harry and as Ron’s head whipped around Draco said,’ Oh sorry Weasley didn’t see you there,’ Draco had spoken without thinking and tensed waiting to see if Ron had noticed how genuinely he had said it. Ron, thinking that it was all an elaborate ploy gave him a dirty look and turned back around to concentrate on the game. Neither boy had time for the other as they both sat staring with the same concerned expression for their mutual friend.
Severus Snape was just placing his China tea cup down on the potion stained sideboard when he heard a knock at the door of his rooms. It was well after the evening meal so Severus knew it could only be one of two students appearing at his door, or, indeed maybe even another member of staff. Pulling open the heavy wooden door he raised an inquiring eyebrow at the young man beyond.
With a start Harry realised he had just been reading the conversation and had not even acknowledged his presence, hurriedly he turned on to his stomach and scrawled his reply of,
year had spent the summer at the castle they were already there when the other students arrived at the castle. Once the sorting and the feast were over the 8
Draco looked down in to those wonderful emerald eyes and leaned forward to touch his forehead against the Gryffindor’s  ‘ we shall see,’ he stated with a glint of challenge in his eyes.
Harry sighed and once again repeated the line he had recited over and over for the entire week previously;
The Slytherin's were still none the wiser as they arrived at the Great Hall, in fact it wasn't until the Ravenclaws began descending the staircase behind them that some light was shed on the subject.
Ron Weasley considering himself Harry’s best friend and mulled this over as he watched his friend fall apart over his breakfast. He studied the smaller boys red rimmed eyes and the deep circles beneath them and knew that that slimy Slytherin had something to do with it. He knew Malfoy was to blame and he had told Hermione on more than ten occasions that Harry would end up hurt, he glared across the hall at the icey blond and stopped in his tracks, Malfoy was clearly as distressed as Harry if not more, he could see pain glazing the silver eyes  and vowed to get to the bottom of it, he just had no idea how to, his usual bullish manner would not work here but fortunately for him he was quite friendly with the brightest witch of their age.
Draco dropped his hand and stared at Harry before he stomped out of the compartment. Shit! He thought shit, shit, shit.
‘I don’t understand,’ said Blaise looking genuinely confused, ‘You can get Treacle Tart any time you want, for free, from school.’
‘I wasn’t alone Draco,’ then a realisation hit Harry, Draco was worried about him. He walked across the room and placed a hand on the other boys shoulder.
‘Seriuosly though Harry I wouldn’t tell anyone anything you didn’t want me to, you can trust me.’ And Draco for once in his life meant every word.
As eleven o’clock approached the whole school started to make its way down to the Quidditch stadium.
It took a moment before Harry and Draco stepped away from each other, so caught up as they were. Harry’s  hormones were going wild, the mere smell of Draco had sent heat rushing straight to his groin, luckily for him, he was pretty sure that no one had noticed but he was pretty sure that somehow Draco had just known.
'What help is that?' snapped Draco 'Get over here and move some rocks you great Lummox, we need to get at them, we need to help.'
The four students who thought of this room as their own walked over to the usual plush sofas they frequented, Pansy followed, chosing a place next to Neville and Blaise, which left Ron, through no choice of his own, sitting with Harry and Draco on the opposite sofa.
‘Draco’ he said holding his hand out to Harry. Harry’s smile returned as he held  his hand out to take the blonde boy’s.
There were hushed whispers all around The Great Hall as Percy and the other prefects plunged it in to darkness. ‘Do you think Black is still here?’ Hermione whispered from next to Harry’s head, Harry was in two minds about this, on one hand he wanted Sirius Black to still be in the castle, there was increased chance of seeing him, of letting him know that he knows he’s not the bad guy, of finding out what happened really, also there was a relief of knowing where Sirius was, that he was safe inside somewhere, however Sirius wasn’t really safe here, no one but him and his friends knew that he wasn’t the mass murderer they thought him to be.
Draco closed his eyes as their voiced washed over him. He ran the words of his, now fully formed song, through his mind. He could do this, he had to do this.
‘What did you write?’ muttered Draco from behind the arm he had thrown across his face, Blaise looked at his friend with a look of sympathy in his eyes, it was obvious to anyone with half a brain that Draco cared deeply for the Gryffindor. Blaise went to sit down next to Draco and placed a hand on the blonde’s shoulder, ‘ I just asked if there was anything we can do,’ Draco surprised Blaise by laughing, ‘We are just kids what can we do?’
Pansy felt her cheeks flush as the groans of climax could be heard on the other side of the door, she was pretty sure that she didn’t have to stay right to the end, but for some reason she just couldn’t tear herself away. Before she could compose herself and walk away, the voices started once again from the behind the door and Pansy was very glad she had stayed until the end;
Harry was hidden beneath his cloak with Neville, listening in silence as the adults around him discussed Sirius Black. It was nice for Harry to hear that they all, except Fudge of course, still had trouble believing that Sirius had taken the turn towards the dark and gone over to Voldemort’s side. It brought a lump to Harry’s throat when he heard how close Sirius was to his dad, like brothers, it sounded just like him and Draco. Well it would be if they weren’t boyfriends and they were allowed to show their closeness out in public but that was just semantics.
Seamus chuckled and stood up ‘Yes sir, I won’t be long.’ Seamus stopped for a minute to let his eyes rove over Harry’s body, ‘You could always join me you know.’
‘She won’t tell Draco, I know she won’t she promised, she even let me come tonight provided I didn’t lose any more house points.’ Harry said with a small smile looking up at the other boy. Draco felt the weight and warmth of the hand on his shoulder and returned the smile, if Harry could trust the nosey bugger then he guessed he could to. He shrugged and said;
Harry turned away again, this was somehow easier to discuss when he didn’t have to look in to those earnest eyes, ‘We’ve done some stuff, you know,’ Harry swallowed, ‘mild, over the clothes stuff.’
Harry sighed and looked down at the parchment that was resting on his knee, he wriggled down further on his bed wondering what to say.
Before Harry could reply Neville spoke up, ‘Of course it’s not your fault Malfoy, Ron is an idiot plain and simple, Harry did the right thing defending you.’
Anyway it's been too long, I'll shut up we need to see how Draco is faring being stuck on the other side of the rock fall.
Remus was the first to recover, he reached down and pulled Harry up in to a bone-crunching hug, wrapping two strong arms round his shoulders he buried his head in to the messy raven locks. Harry brought his hands up to rest on the Defence Professor’s shoulder blades. He stood like that before he realised Remus was trembling in his arms, ‘Pops,’ he said gently, ‘Are you ok? Did I do something wrong? Was it too much?’ He turned worried eyes to Severus and was surprised to find tear-filled dark eyes meet his own. Remus lifted his head and placed a hand on each of Harry’s shoulders, stepping back so that he could take a good look at Harry. After a moment he glanced at Severus, Harry missed whatever passed between the two but suddenly he found himself enveloped in another pair of strong arms. ‘Harry,’ whispered Severus,’ Thank you for accepting me, it will be an honour to be called father by you.’
Harry’s heart dropped, all the excitement and stir of emotions he had felt upon seeing the blonde boy evaporated at the taller boys tone. Why wasn’t Draco happy to see him? He turned green eyes up to silver questioningly, unable to hide the hurt within. Draco softened as their eyes met, ‘It’s not safe here Harry, I’m just concerned and ...’ Draco took a step back and his nose scrunched a little, ‘Why are you such a mess?
Harry looked at Draco, ‘Why are you here then?’  Draco inclined his head slightly towards the back of the shop and Harry’s eyes fell on a very tall, very handsome blonde wizard. The almost white hair, the regal air in which he held himself and the silver eyes that flashed as he spoke to the small man in front of him told Harry that this man had to be Draco’s father. Harry’s eyes roved over the older wizards face following every defined and structured line, Harry’s mouth went dry as he realised that it was extremely possible that Draco would grow to look just like this wizard, Harry felt a strange little knot form in his stomach, as he caught Draco’s eyes once more, he hoped with all his heart that that was where the similarities ended. Draco’s father may be stunningly beautiful from the outside but Harry knew he was extremely ugly from the inside. Draco had watched as Harry had regarded his father with wide, curious eyes  and wondered what he was thinking. Before he could ask he heard his name called , he looked at Harry, ‘ I have to go Harry please stay safe.’
Pansy blinked at him, ‘Right,’ she stated, ‘that is what I will tell them, ‘gesturing to the rest of the table, ‘but, Draco I want the truth.’
Harry and Draco had worked throughout the remaining months of the summer, silently side by side, each found reassurance and renewed strength in the other. This had not gone unnoticed by the other helpers at the castle, each student and teacher had an opinion although not all were brave enough to voice it. The whispers had increased, especially when Harry had put his wand away to help Draco manually move the rubble. People watched in fascination as the two boys worked silently, their company obviously enough for each other.
Then as if Ron could hear his thoughts he suddenly barged in to the hospital room, closely followed by the other Gryffindor’s, Blaise and Luna.
At eleven o’clock that night Harry and Hermione said goodbye to Ron and went down to the entrance hall together.
Draco’s eyes snapped open and met startled green ones, Harry had obviously thought him asleep when he had confessed his love for someone. Draco’s stomach was churning, he felt sick, he had to swallow to stop the bile from rising, the last thing he had wanted to hear, on Christmas Eve, cuddled up in bed with Harry was that he loved someone else. He was young, he knew that, but he understood what love was, he had heard Pansy whimper on about it enough, she had explained how it felt from Veela romance novels she had read and all the girly magazines that he had stolen and read in secret, he wanted Harry to feel that for him and not for some other boy. He swallowed hard and decided that he needed to know, hoping that Harry wasn’t talking about Weasley or even that Creevey kid, ‘Who?’ he asked, wincing as his voice cracked slightly.
years would all share. This is how Draco found himself sharing a room with the Gryffindor’s and Blaise. He was not surprised that no other Slytherin’s had returned but was secretly very glad about this. The dorms looked just like their house dorms, the seven beds spaced evenly around the room, each with their own pale blue curtains, the house colours of their two houses were intertwined in pastels in little touches throughout the room. Draco settled for a bed in the corner of the room across form Harry’s and began to unpack his trunk. Since the majority of the 8
‘It’s one of the very first books ever published about Herbology, first edition and..oh my, signed by the author. Harry this is too much, where on earth did you get this?’
Harry steeled himself, it was now or never. ‘Have you and Blaise, you know, done things?’ Harry felt that the atmosphere in the room doubled in thickness. The room was filled with silence for so long the Harry thought he had overstepped, he turned to look at Neville to reassure him that he didn't need to answer him, but what he saw him stopped him in his tracks. Neville's face was covered with the dopiest look Harry had ever seen on the boy, his eyes were glazed over, clearly lost in some memory or other and his grin was so wide it was almost splitting his face in two. ‘Nev’ Harry prompted, Neville blinked slowly and turned to aim his grin at Harry, ‘I guess I have my answer then,’ Harry snorted, ‘Are you ok discussing this or would you like to keep it between the two of you?’ Neville nodded, ‘Obviously there are some things I’d like to keep to myself,’ Harry nodded, ‘But I don’t mind discussing this with you at all. Why are you asking? Have you and Draco?’
Draco could not hide his smug smile as he realised what Harry had just said, this was something that only he could help Harry with.
Harry wished he could capture those words forever. For some reason those words meant so much to him, they filled him with a warm sensation that he never wanted to lose. He decided to let Draco off the hook.
The walk to the Room of Requirement had never felt so long. It had probably only been about half an hour since Draco had left his dorm, but it felt like hours to Harry and he was in a desperate rush to get to Draco and explain what had happened to him.
Draco was wondering this himself just as the morning’s post arrived. As the owls flooded in to the Great Hall as usual, everyone’s attention was caught at once by a long thin package carried by six large screech owls. Draco was just as interested as everyone else although his face was a mask of complete indifference.  However, he could not hide his amazement when the owls soared and dropped the package right in front of his Gryffindor friend. Draco had to stifle a chuckle as Harry’s bacon flew everywhere with one piece hitting him squarely in the face, just then, another owl dropped a letter in to Harry’s lap. Draco watched as Harry opened the letter with interest. Harry’s smile covered his face, his green eyes glittered like emeralds in the morning sun.  Draco’s eyes narrowed as Harry passed the letter to Ron, ‘git’ he muttered as Ron’s mouth hung open, ‘didn’t he realise how idiotic he looked.
‘Potter?’ Draco questioned in a hushed tome, Harry ran his fingers down the snakes head never taking his eyes off it, ‘it’s beautiful’, he whispered in awe as he  felt Draco’s skin dimple beneath his fingertips,
Ginny laughed at Harry’s distracted response, ‘Harry, where are you, you look a thousand miles away?’
Harry slowly began to fill her in, her eyes widened with every word he spoke. As Hagrid heard what had happened he walked the group to the edge of the forest and after a short goodbye left to find the body of the Unicorn.
Draco paced the dungeon, a look of concern on his face, shooting an icey glare at anyone who dared to come anywhere near him or had the audacity to speak to him. He was scared for Harry, he had just heard that Snape was going to be refereeing  Harry’s next Quidditch match, he wouldn’t have believed it if he had not seen it for himself, but, for some reason his Godfather had decided to try and hurt Harry, he couldn’t challenge him about it knowing full well that his father would find out, so for now he would have to do whatever he could to protect Harry. He was so frustrated , he couldn’t go to Harry, just walk up to him in the corridors, imagine, and he had told Harry long ago, in no uncertain terms that he would not be responsible for him being up all night before a game so they had agreed not to meet when Harry had a game.
He turned his broomstick to face Draco mid – air. He was surprised to find a smile on the boy’s face. Harry shyly smiled back.
‘Draco Malfoy saved my life, then his mother saved my life, there are no words that I can say that can thank them for that, but I will protect them both until my last breath and I PROMISE that.’
The door in front of Draco stood slightly ajar, Draco could just make out the shape of the three headed dog moving around in the room behind the door, he noticed the difference between the room now and the way it was when he had first seen it all those months ago, the trapdoor was open. Draco only just managed to stop himself crying out, he had done it, Harry had gone through the trapdoor. Draco did not know whether to be more angry or scared, he did not know what to do.
‘Ordinarily I would refuse to answer such an impertinent question, however, I know you and I know that you wouldn’t ask it unless knowing the answer would help you in some way. So in that case, and, with the assurance of your secrecy,’ Draco nodded.’ ‘Yes, Professor Lupin is indeed my Soulmate. Now it is my turn to ask a question. Why do you ask?’
‘Yes, about that, that is an interesting couple of pieces of parchment  you and Blaise have,may I ask where you got them from?’
‘Well erm...’ started Draco, using his free hand to rub the back of his neck. Harry chuckled at how uncomfortable Draco appeared to be. Harry rose on his toes and placed a delicate kiss, this time on the Slytherin’s lips.
Draco was lay curled on his bed sobbing, being in the dungeons there were no windows so it was an enchanted sunrise that washed over his face. Draco sniffed and sat up, every available surface around him was littered with presents wrapped immaculately in silver and green. Draco didn’t want presents he just wanted his mother, but, just then he spotted a present that was not like the others  on his side table, buried under a pile of other presents was a very messily wrapped present in blue paper covered in jolly snowmen wearing top hats. Draco hurried over and grabbed the present causing a cascade of presents to fall from the table, he didn’t even wince as he heard the shattering of glass. Draco jumped back on his bed, all tears forgotten, he crossed his legs beneath him and stared at the badly wrapped present on his lap. He was eager to know who the present was from and turned over the label, which simply said;
The sun was shining brightly in the sky as the three Slytherin’s made their way to breakfast feeling quite happy and with themselves and a little smug which was evident on all of their faces. After weeks of planning and debating and some insightful input from Neville (without his knowledge) they had figured out how to exact their revenge and now felt that the time was right to set their plan in motion and then sit back and enjoy the show. They had spent many nights sitting by themselves in the Slytherin common room trying to decide how best to exact the revenge when Blaise recounted a story Neville had told him and their minds were made up. Each Slytherin was talented in their own way and had skills in specific subjects although Draco was generally skilled in all things he tried his hands at so they were strong in their belief that they could not fail, after all they were Slytherins known to achieve their end by any means. They had waited a while, believing strongly that revenge was a dish served ice cold and they wanted Ron to be off his guard, completely unsuspecting. They had chosen today as it was a full day of Slytherin and Gryffindor classes so they had front row seats to what was to happen.
Harry could tell that Draco was holding himself back for some reason, he really didn’t want him to, he wanted his boyfriend to enjoy this as much as he was. Without stopping to think of the consequences he placed his hands over Draco's and removed them from his waist. Draco broke the kiss in confusion. Without breaking eye contact and face flushing scarlet, Harry lowered Draco's hands and placed them well below his waistline pushing hard as he did hoping that Draco understood what he meant. There was a brief moment of nothing causing Harry to panic that he had pushed Draco too far too soon but then Draco gave an experimental squeeze causing, what felt like a bolt of lightning, to shoot through Harry. The smaller of the two smiled at the sensation and lifted his hand to cup his boyfriend’s cheek, and then he leaned down to kiss Draco once more.
I am so so so sorry for the delay. This story has not been abandoned I'm just crazy busy !! Enjoy :D
Draco looked at her as the memory of the morning came back to him. He could not tell her what had made him panic, he just couldn’t;
Draco looked at the small boy in front of him, he knew him, how the hell? Harry could see something in him that no one else could, in fact, he could not always see it in himself. He looked in to those green eyes, he had heard people say how special this boy was and he was now beginning to see it for himself. Draco felt a now familiar warmth creeping through his body, he had to keep this boy in his life.
Harry sat back in his chair with a thump.  He felt empty, as though all emotion had left him, like the aftermath of a Dementor’s  kiss. He felt tears stinging the corner of his eyes and brought his hand so his face pressing his the heels to his eyes in an attempt to stem the flow. He felt humiliated, it didn’t cross his mind to think that Draco was lying, as he had looked in to those grey eyes, burning with pain and indignation for him, and he had believed every word. He felt Draco lay a reassuring hand on his forearm and dropped his hands, attempting a reassuring smile that he didn’t really feel not quite sure why he had felt the urge to reassure the blond before him. Draco had leaned forward and was watching him with concern etched on to every bit of his face.
Draco lifted his hand off the table and turned it so it was palm up, he flexed his fingers and sighed once more, ‘I can hardly believe it myself.’
All four of the boys turned to look in the direction of the noise and, as one, their mouths dropped open. Sitting against the wall, hunched down, knees pulled up to his chest, was Professor Lockheart, he was moving a  rock around him with his arm extended, like a toy aeroplane, the noises were his sound effects. Neville scrambled to his feet and dashed to the Professors side, 'Professor?'
‘It was my father’s ‘ shrugged Harry not knowing what else to say. ‘ I got it for Christmas but i don’t know who sent it.’
Harry lifted his eyes from the book he was pretending to read and looked up into the steely grey ones of his newest friend.
Draco had arrived to the Trophy Room early as usual, he was eager to find out what on earth had been going on with Harry over the summer, and also what had happened to close the platform barrier, what on earth had been going on in Harry Potter’s life since they had last been able to spend time together? Draco had that many questions racing through his mind that he had been sorely tempted to write them down, he had almost given in but then remembered that he was a Malfoy and had an impeccable memory. He laced his fingers behind his back and paced the floor as he waited for Harry, it was not lost on him how much he looked like his father at that moment.
Draco sighed and wrapped his arm around the smaller boy’s shoulders pulling him tightly to his side. ‘All my life I have heard tales about the Grim, the symbol of death, personally I feel like it was just a story made up to make young children behave. As far as I know there has never actually been a confirmed sighting of a real life Grim.
No there was not one Gryffindor that would speak to him, he had hurt Lavender and Hermione just a few weeks after hurting Harry and clearly had made a complete show of himself, thoroughly embarrassing his family members, Percy could not even look at him after hearing that he was pant less in front of Professor McGonagol. As Ron sat down to dinner people physically moved away from him, Ron ate quickly and stormed from the Great Hall not noticing the group of Slytherin’s that got up to follow him.
Over the summer Pansy had come to mean so much to Ron, even before then he had started noticing her more and more. In the chamber he had worried for her just as much as for Harry, more if he cared to admit it. He had no idea what this all meant, Ron adored Hermione, he liked her as much as he always had but there was just something about Pansy, something he had been willing to let go, despite throwing himself in front of an angry Hippogriff to protect her. But now, now he knew she felt the same, he could hear it in her voice how much he meant to her, the mere fact that she had crept through the castle after hours to see him risking detention or maybe even expulsion and not only that, had dragged her friends along with her spoke volumes to him. As much as he cared for Hermione how on earth was he supposed to let it go now?
Draco seized Harry’s shoulders and bodily heaved him from the memory, he had been trying since he had witnessed his idiotic boyfriend stumbling quite literally head first in to the unknown, obviously the memory was over as he was able to remove Harry.
Draco could not answer for a moment, The heir of Slytherin, were they insane, parseltounge was unusual , ok so it was rare, very rare,  but these people were clearly insane , before he could reply Blaise wandered in to the common room, he caught the Italian’s eyes and glanced down at the parchment on his lap in what he hoped was a meaningful way, Blaise nodded in acknowledgment and climbed on his bed pulling his own parchment from beneath his pillow. Within a minute Blaise’s elegant cursive had appeared at the parchment.
Pansy immediately perked up at this, ‘ooooh sounds fun,’ she said gleefully as she followed the boys out of the hall.
‘she’s in the portrait that guards our common room, she wasn’t there because her portrait had been slashed to pieces,’ at this statement Draco and Blaise gave up all pretence of disinterest and joined Pansy, flanking her on either side, Ron gave them a cursory glance before continuing ‘we found her eventually, she was distraught and inconsolable, she was eventually able to tell us what had happened, she had been attacked by someone who wanted to get in to our common room,’ here Ron paused for affect as he was well aware that at this point most of the school were listening, ‘she was attacked by Sirius Black.”
Draco felt like he was being tortured, everywhere he went he could hear whispers about Harry bloody Potter.
‘Unfortunately Mr Potter is not currently receiving visitors, however, it is probably unwise of you to visit seeing as you wish to keep the friendship a secret do you not think Draco?’
Draco dragged himself from breakfast and back down to the dungeons for double potions with the Gryffindors, he would have skipped any other class just to avoid Harry but knew Snape would not stand for it so he strode meaningfully in to the classroom and took a desk right at the front dragging Pansy with him, doing this meant that he didn’t have to look at anyone else in the classroom but unfortunately meant he missed the scheming happening all around him.
‘Yes Drake,’ Harry said with a sigh, ‘Just hear me out, ok, so we each take turns asking another person whether they want a truth or a dare, then you either ask them a question they can’t lie to or they have to do whatever you tell them.’
‘Forgive me Potter but I was pretty sure that that was what we were doing,’ Draco fought back a small smile as he noticed a blush start to creep up Harry’s neck. The man in question looked down at his feet then, after seeming to steel himself, looked up and locked eyes with Draco, ‘I know, I just, I mean somewhere quiet, you know, just us.’
He turned to Blaise and caught his eye, it was clear his friend had heard the same two words. This was not good, not good at all. Before anyone could speak again they were ushered in through the doors and Draco was startled to realise that the Gryffindors were already in attendance. His eyes swept them in an appraising manner searching for injury or maiming but, overall they looked ok if not a little spooked. The lower years were wide eyed and seemed to be buzzing with some sort if fearful excitement, whereas the upper years were huddled together and whispering furiously back and forth. Draco's eyes roved over the crowd in front of him, he could not see the messy head of hair that he sought out  , he couldn't even see Ron, Hermione or Neville, the calm that had entered him upon seeing the Gryffindors slowly began to leave his body, if there was trouble those four were bound to find themselves in the centre of it.
He strode out of the compartment and walked with a purpose down the train. Crabbe and Goyle looked at each other and shrugged.
‘It was me and Hedwig, the Dursley’s  locked us up, Hedwig was confined to her cage and I was locked in my room, , food was pushed through a hole in the door when they remembered and my school stuff was locked away in my old cupboard, and then , well something happened so they decided to put bars on my windows.’ Harry shrugged, unable to read the expression on Draco’s face, the hand that was not joined with Harry’s was balled in to a fist. Draco decided that if there was one thing he was going to achieve in his life he was going to make those muggles pay, one way or another. He took a deep breath and looked in to Harry’s eyes, Harry was looking worriedly at him.
‘Well according to my sources the entrance to the platform had sealed itself shut behind her trapping Potter and Weasley on the other side,  there was no possible way that they could get through.’
By the time Draco finished Ron’s mouth was hanging open, ‘That has to be what it is, it explains so much, from Hagrid’s roosters to Hermione carrying a mirror but if that’s true how has it been getting from place to place? Someone would notice a great bloody snake roaming the halls I’m sure.’
‘Where were you both?’ Pansy hissed across the table as she sat down across from her two best friends who seemed to be resolutely ignoring her.
The six students were sitting cross legged on the floor of the classroom in a small circle, Ron was sitting across from Harry with Hermione on one side and Neville on the other, Harry was opposite Blaise sitting between him and Neville and Draco between him and Hermione, the atmosphere could hardly be called jolly;
But that wasn’t the real reason Draco hadn’t wanted to come, he’d heard rumours of course but nothing had prepared him for the sight of the awful truth. Another long drink distracted him from the sight for a moment, he was torturing himself he knew that but he just couldn’t look away. No matter how many times he closed his eyes they always fell back on the couple secreted away across the room from him, it was morbid curiosity and it was tearing him apart.
McGonagol strode over towards the discarded clothing silencing the laughing students around her with her stern glare. With the flick of a wrist she levitated Ron’s school trousers and shook them lightly, nothing happened expect a few pieces of crumpled white paper falling to the floor.
Harry stared at the kneeling form in front of him, he spotted the moment that it clicked with the Slytherin. The blonde’s back straightened and tensed and the hands holding the parchment trembled. Harry removed the cloak and held his breath and just as he was about to give up Draco turned his head.
‘Say that again,’ Draco breathed gazing down at the top of Harry’s head. Harry looked up as though in a daze, he felt as though he was in a dream, he couldn’t figure out how this had happened, a dream come true, he had somehow found himself in a confined space with the man of his dreams literally at his fingertips, ‘What?’ he asked, not quite sure what Draco has just said.
As the curtains were drawn around Dean’s bed Harry realised with a start that somewhere in the not too distant future there was a very real possibility that he would be able to have something just like that.
Exams were done, there were only a couple of days left of term so it was to Snape’s office that Draco headed after lunch was over. However, the man in question was also out looking for his godson and on seeing him in the corridor and on seeing him placed a firm hand on his shoulder and led him to the empty Potion’s classroom.
As Ron continued Harry felt like smacking Ron around the head with the broomstick , he glanced at the reddening face of Draco as he tried to catch his eye.
As Harry was lost in these thoughts, Draco came to a sudden halt. He had seen a puddle of silvery liquid glinting in the sparse moonlight that had managed to filter through the knotted together tree branches. He had known what it was immediately, Hagrid had told them what to look for, it was unicorn blood.
With that Harry’s head snapped up, Hermione had said Draco , Draco not Malfoy, he had to be dreaming.
Luckily Harry had chosen that moment to once again turn and look at his friend or he would have missed the way his face turned a very fetching shade of scarlet. ‘No way’ Harry gasped sitting up and turning to face Neville, crossing his legs in front of him as he did so, ‘seriously?’ Neville sat up so that he was facing Harry, ‘Yep’ he nodded as his face, once again, split in two with the biggest grin he had ever seen on his friend’s face.
Draco was amazed, there was no way he could not meet this person now after all this, he needed to know who knew him so well, he knew who he wanted it to be and smiled softly at the thought but shook it off, he knew there was no way it could be the person he longed for, the gods had no reason to be that kind, so, slowly he turned his thoughts to who it might be as he began his journey to the lake. His gift giver was obviously his year or perhaps a seventh year to be able to see him in class like that, his mind raced through the names of all the boys he could think of but he had no idea who would pay him this much attention, he needed to know, if he didn’t like it at least he could thank them, he would, of course, not be returning the gifts. He thought back to the request to see his drawing and thought of the sketch book that he carried in his bag, always on his person and wondered if he would ever share it with anyone, perhaps not this particular one, but he had others.
Ron spluttered indignantly and turned an interesting shade of post box red and, before he could stop himself he answered, ‘No.. what? .. I mean, of course I don’t it’s Mione.’
Harry and Draco had finally managed to find some time together after everything that had gone on. Once again, they found themselves in the same dark corner of the Trophy Room as Blaise and Neville were taking their turn in the Room of Requirement. Since his conversation with Neville, Harry had found himself wondering what exactly his two friends were getting up to, he found that if he thought too much about it he started getting jealous of their closeness, wanting that with his own boyfriend but not knowing how to step forward in to that part of their relationship. That being said, he was full of a nervous excitement of the thought of being alone with Draco, but he had other things on his mind which took precedent.
Draco snorted, ‘What did he do? As if you all don’t know, as if you all have not been laughing at me tucked up in your common room.’
Pansy wrinkled her nose at the damp slimy walls around them, ‘Hmm I’d have to agree,’ she said, wiping her hands gracefully on her top.
‘Anytime,’ said Pansy as she sauntered back the way she came as the eyes of most of the Gryffindor’s including Ron followed her. Hermione promptly smacked the back of his head.
Draco swallowed the lump that was beginning to form in his throat. He turned and glared at Pansy, ‘I don’t know what you mean.’
After a second Harry broke the kiss and shoved Seamus playfully, ‘Shower you, you’re distracting me.’
He ran to cut them off and snatched the parcel from Harry. He would have to apologise later. He felt the package as a look of realisation crossed his face. ‘That’s a broomstick,’ he said chucking it back at Harry. Draco’s head was a mixture of emotions, he was jealous, of course he was, he was also really happy for his friend but the most confusing and the strongest emotion was that of worry for his friend;
Harry followed Draco over to the lake, his palms were growing sweaty, he was about to reveal himself and he was getting nervous about it, could he do this? Well he couldn’t back out now, he couldn’t do that to Draco, with renewed determination he strode forward to the final part of the gift.
‘Oh for...’ Fred rolled his eyes and leant over and flicked the spider from Ron’s hand before turning and striding out of the Great Hall to catch up with his twin. Trembling, Ron slowly lowered his hand and stared wide eyed around the Great Hall, all eyes were on him, every pair on the Gryffindor table were narrowed in annoyance especially those near by that had been showered in Pumpkin Juice. The looks around the Great Hall varied from surprise to amusement but those of a certain blonde haired Slytherin were glistening with glee, when Ron met his eyes, Draco lifted his goblet as though to toast him and sneered across the top. Ron glared in his direction this had to be his doing, he just knew it.
The booth was small but not too small for them to both sit comfortably side by side on the small white bench that ran along one end of the booth, Draco sat and stretched out his long legs in front of him, Harry watched in awe as Draco’s feet brushed against the opposite wall, he didn’t even attempt the same knowing his own legs will fall far shorter. Draco shifted slightly appearing to be seeking comfort and Harry swallowed as he felt the blonde’s firm thigh pressed up against his own, he could feel the heat through his jeans and imagined what it would be like to be at the mercy of those strong thighs. . ‘So’ Draco started, pulling Harry from his fantasies, ‘You want to talk?’ Harry swallowed, his earlier bravado leaving him in one breath, ‘tattoo,’ he mumbled inwardly berating himself at the randomness, ‘Pardon?’ Draco asked, turning his head slightly so he could get a better look at the man at his side, Harry swallowed and looked back, ‘ I noticed it when you were dancing, I mean not that I was looking, I mean obviously I was, I couldn’t help notice, I mean…’ Draco took pity on Harry and put an end to his rambling, ‘Ok, so I have a tattoo, what of it?’ Harry rubbed his damp palms down his thighs, ‘Can I see it?’
Laughter littered the Potion’s classroom and Draco stared at Seamus. That had bothered him, bothered him more than he cared to admit, he didn’t know why, he just knew that he could quite happily thump Seamus’s smug face right about now.
‘They’re not leaving,’ Draco said, sounding scared. ‘How can we get you out?’ Draco’s eyes widened with fear.
‘Anyway,’ said Draco, turning his head to break the intense eye contact. ‘We should maybe try and figure out why my house elf was trying to stop you.....’
Hermione gave a small chuckle, she was finally getting to see the other side of this friendship and by the pink tinge slowly creeping up Draco’s neck she felt she was justified in her thoughts on it.
‘Ok,’ Blaise nodded and looked at each of the students around him, ‘now who to choose as my victim,’ he caught Draco’s eye and smirked , ‘Harry’ he said, ‘truth or dare?’
Warning: Very OOC Snape. I'd like to think love and family mellowed him quite a bit, well behind closed doors anyway.
Harry thought for a moment then explained about the cover story Draco had come up with, ‘then’ he said ‘ I can tell him everything else without the need to mention Draco.’
Draco remembered the relief he had felt as he had seen Harry walk in to the trophy room that night. He had not even thought twice about hugging him and he had not even been embarrassed about it, he didn’t acre he just wanted Harry to know he’d been scared. He’d not let Harry know he’d run to the bathrooms, that was the only thing that embarrassed him, he had just acted instinctively, luckily his fellow Slytherin’s had assumed he was just going to have a good laugh at the unlucky Gryffindor’s.
Draco Malfoy was sat at the Slytherin table, the end housing the older students was sparse, very few had returned to complete their education after the war, his one remaining close friend sat steadfastly at his side as usual. Blaise Zabini had never left his side throughout everything, the only friend he had that had not turned his back when Draco turned his back on his family at the final battle. Draco had broken when he had seen Harry Potter lying, assumed dead in Hagrid’s arms, the pleas of his parents to cross the courtyard and join them had fallen on deaf ears, his eyes never left the unmoving form of Harry, his parents had not seemed important. He had stood shoulder to shoulder with Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley and wept for the fallen hero. His Mother’s screams had echoed through his mind but his gaze had not faltered. The memory of Harry jumping from Hagrid’s arms was the one he fell asleep to every single night since the war, he had been so happy, he had run without thought straight for Harry, screaming out to him, throwing his wand, The Boy Who Lived had lived again.
Before he could answer Harry spotted the snitch behind Draco’s head, he waited a split second too long while he decided on the best course of action, WHAM, before he knew what had happened the bludger had smacked in to his elbow. Draco looked at Harry in concern and Harry knew he was close to trying to stop the match so before Draco could utter a word he raced after the snitch and exhaled in relief as Draco gave chase, although Harry was not sure whether Draco was chasing the snitch or him.
Draco reached out and clasped Harry’s free hand, noticing how clammy it felt; the group walked on in silence.
...............................................................................................................................................................
Draco felt the heat rising in his cheeks, so, Harry had realised that he was protective, wonderful! Ge thought sarcastically.
‘Yes,’ Harry said patiently in a way that suggested he was about to explain something very complicated to somebody very stupid. ‘but that is ordinary Treacle Tart, this is the best Treacle Tart ever, in the whole world ever, it’s exquisite, homemade, mouth watering, to die for...’
‘Hermione that is barbaric.’ Said Draco from her side, visibly paling at the thought. A slow smile spread across Hermione’s face, ‘so don’t lie.’ She said sweetly.
They didn’t know how long they had sat talking but they began to get a bit uncomfortable. Draco started fidgeting, Harry chuckled, ‘Numb bum?’ he asked. ‘Yup,’ he said and stood up.
Draco kept eye contact and shrugged, ‘for Harry,’ he said simply, hoping that Crabbe and Goyle would just go with it, he could answer questions later.
The three had spent an emotional few minutes cementing their new bond as a family. Harry relaxed in the presence of his ‘parents’ and smiled contentedly. He knew James and Lily would always be his parents and a huge part of his life, but he knew they would be happy that he was as safe and loved as he was right now and would be accepting of the fact that Remus and Severus had well and truly earned the title of ‘parents.’ He smiled as he watched the two men sink, side by side, on to the sofa before him.
birthday, he had known the Dursley’s would forget he would have put money on it, but his friends, Draco? He just didn’t understand, had he done something wrong?
Draco was secretly pleased, although would never admit as much, that the girl cared for him in this way.
‘Yea and no’ said Dumbledore. ‘It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest desire of our hearts. The mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that. Now, why don’t you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?
year. That castle had been horrible to live in, each day had brought her closer to death, fighting to survive wherever they turned but it also brought her closer to Neville. She had fallen in love with the strong Gryffindor boy and felt keenly that she had betrayed Harry. Watching him follow Neville through the portrait had been so fantastic and yet so painful, she had known she had to say something but it really wasn’t the right time.
During her speech Harry had arrived in the common room and was stood silently in the corner hoping not to interrupt, it had broken his heart to hear Hermione so sad, but deep down he knew she was right.
There was a long pause , it went on for so long that Harry began to think Draco had stopped speaking to him.
Harry felt a familiar heat rising in his cheeks, his head sunk down to his chest as he looked up at Draco through his untidy fringe.
That was the last straw, losing his head, Harry tried to make a run for it , but the dwarf seized him around the knees and brought him crashing to the floor.
Neville took a deep breath and wiped his suddenly sweating palms down his pyjama legs; ‘Ok well I’m trusting you to keep this secret, but, well I overheard that conversation that night with Ron,’ Harry felt his cheeks burning as he realised which conversation Neville was referring to, Neville noticed his friends red face and continued, ‘don’t worry,’ he reassured him, ‘that is what I am trying to tell you, I like boys too, that’s my secret, do what you want with it.’ Harry stared at the boy in front of him with wide eyes.
The young man finally looked at the older man before him, he straighter himself up and quickly wiped his hands across his cheeks, he was only betrayed by his red-rimmed eyes and the blond hair that was standing on end from having hands carded through it. ‘ Do you really think so?’
Summer had been  lovely but Draco knew it was a lost cause, Harry was dating Ginny, or well he had been, but he had talked to Draco about making it work, about building bridges after the war, Draco had sat nodding wisely and listened, all the while crumbling a little inside, he knew Harry liked girls, was making headway with Ginny and that was ok, he had accepted he would never be with Harry for these reasons and was learning to live with that, but now this, this changed everything.
‘Well why on earth did she not help you in the Great hall?’ Draco asked while secretly he knew that if he had seen that he may have very well marched over there and ripped her head off her shoulders.
The five boys worked in silence to restore the room to it’s former self, the silence punctuated occasionally with muttering from a certain blond haired Slytherin who was plotting the downfall of the person who had dared to do this to Harry’s things.
Without knowing why Harry reached out and placed a hand on Malfoy’s shoulder, Malfoy finally looked up at the contact and Harry’s world stopped turning. A haze fell over everything but Malfoy and his features came in to sharp contrast, Harry could hear his heart beat in his ears as he watched the man opposite open his mouth:
Blaise growled lowly and stole a glance at Neville who simply smiled sweetly at him, Blaise sighed resignedly ,’Snape,’ he said in a low voice as he felt heat rising in his cheeks, ‘as well you know Draco.’
Draco’s smile almost touched the tip of his ears as he slowly and carefully unwrapped the present wanting to savour every minute.
Draco leaned back and steepled his fingers under his chin, immediately stopping when he realised where he had learned that particular habit, and hummed quietly to himself for a moment. ‘Hmm, well it was what you said about the mirror. It got me thinking about something I read.’
Draco had indeed known and that knowledge had created similar stirrings in himself seemingly moments after he had calmed himself down. The joy of hormones, luckily the class had been too tense waiting for them to fight to notice anything else amiss.
Draco was cut off as a set of warm lips covered his own. The familiar sensations flooded his system and he felt amazing and he did not want the feeling to end, wrapping his arms around Harry’s waist and stepping further in to the ‘v’ of his legs, slowly and not quite sure whether he was doing it right or not Draco tilted his head and parted his lips slightly hoping he wasn’t pushing Harry to far. Draco was relieved when, after a split second Harry mirrored his gesture and suddenly, he could feel the heat of Harry’s breath tingling on his lips and flooding his mouth, where previously there had only been his own two breaths mingled and shared the space, their mouths moved together,  as pent up worry, frustration and anger manifested itself in to a tentative but heated kiss each boy desperate to make their feelings known. Draco pushed further in to Harry feeling the need to be as close as possible as he felt the other boys hands rest on his shoulders, the finger tips digging in ever so slightly as Harry attempted to pull him closer still.
Draco’s eyes snapped open, that’s it he said, ‘ I know what to do,’ with that he stood and strode out of the common room followed by the wide eyes of his two best friends.
Draco was currently wearing a hole in his very expensive carpet and shooting daggers with his eyes at his two friends who had fallen asleep curled up at either end of a long black sofa that dominated one wall of his bedroom. He was about to call a house elf to dump ice cold water on the sleeping pair when a familiar snowy owl flew in through the open window that he had refused to close just in case. Draco felt his heartbeat quicken with excitement and anticipation as he untied the roll of parchment from Hedwig’s leg. He absently scratched the owl on top of its head and retrieved an owl treat from a drawer in his desk. He unravelled the parchment and smiled at the sight of the familiar untidy scrawl;
..... from that moment Hermione Granger became both of their friends. There are some things you can’t share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.
The two men left the pensive memory and wrapped themselves in each other’s arms. This was their all time favourite memory and it had been viewed many times over fast becoming tradition to watch it on the anniversary of it happening. With a smile Harry turned to the beautiful blonde at his side he now called husband and whispered;
‘Oh Draco,’ the girl simpered, ‘ Harry bloody Potter, the boy who lived, is about to get flattened by a mountain troll, he’s only gone off to bloody fight it to save the mudblood Granger,’ she scoffed.  It had taken Draco a matter of seconds to run from the Slytherin dungeon and he had found himself hurtling along the corridors, racing to get to the second floor girls bathrooms. He had no idea what he was going to do when he got there he just needed to get to Harry, to know that he was okay and he needed to know now. Draco threw himself around a corner and stopped himself just before he crashed straight into the back of Professor McGonagall. Luckily they didn’t notice him due to the commotion in the bathroom that they were running towards. Draco crept back around the corner, took a deep breath and waited. As Draco listened he saw Harry and his two friends being escorted past, presumably back to their dormitories. Draco breathed a sigh of relief and slumped back against the wall, maybe the rumours weren’t true , he’s have to ask Harry when he saw him later.
What felt like a few minutes passed and Ron was trembling with exertion, his power was being drained as it took on the strain, 'Come on Weasley, you can do this.' urged Draco. Ron wasn't so sure, he'd never had to do this for so long before now, but, just as he thought all hope was lost, there was a groan from Blaise and his eyes fluttered open, Neville leaped in to his arms, 'Oh my god Blaise, how are you feeling? Are you ok?'
Hermione felt the seat next to her sag and sighed in resignation, she turned her head to look at Ron, his shoulders were slumped and he was leaning forward, elbows resting on his long legs and hands clasped before him, no matter how hard she tried she couldn’t bring herself to hate him, tears filled her eyes as she spoke, ‘We’re over aren’t we?’ Ron’s head snapped round, ‘Mione?’ she held her hand up to stop him, ‘ Ron listen, let me finish.’ She paused and when Ron remained silent continued, ‘I can see it you know, the way you look at her,’ she raised a hand again when Ron looked like he was about to protest, ‘It’s true, how can I compete with her, you threw yourself in front of a hippogriff for her without a second thought, what kind of person would I be if I stood in the way of that?’ Hermione tucked a loose curl behind her ear and went to stand, she could feel the tears falling and wanted to be alone before she completely lost her composure.
.’ Then from where he head his head buried in his sketch pad, without any acknowledgment that he had heard or, even a glance in their direction, Dean sang his own words in reply to Seamus, ‘
Harry nodded and smiled brightly at the blonde. The blonde boy looked startled at the genuine smile that crossed the other boys face. He felt a warm feeling inside and smiled back, he immediately regretted this, imagine if his father had seen.
years were few and far between, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were joined by Neville, Seamus and Dean and Draco was joined by Blaise. There were a few returning Ravenclaw’s and Hufflepuff’s  too. The house dorms were now full so McGonagal  had decided the 8
Ron’s heart broke as he heard a soft sob from above him and felt the warm drop of a tear fall on to his forearm.  He was so close to speaking out, the only thing that stopped him was he had no idea what to say, he had never been so confused in his whole life. How was it possible to feel so strongly for two people, for two completely different people?  All thoughts left his head completely in an instant as he felt a hand softly land on his head, the touch was so soft and tender that it brought a lump to his head and then, before he could register what was happening a feather light kiss was placed on his temple. He was so screwed.
Harry smiled, 'so you thought the best way to not draw attention to yourself was to storm out of the dorm muttering under your breath about some boy being the death of you,’
Draco’s heart was in his mouth as he fell and was extremely grateful when he landed in something soft and squishy. Draco lay still for a moment collecting his thoughts, he had no idea why he had just done what he had done, well he did, yet again he had acted without thinking because of Harry. Harry!! Draco jumped up and began to scrambled across the soft floor that he had landed on. Almost immediately he felt his arms and legs wrapped with strong vines and suddenly he could hardly move a muscle. Draco began to thrash widely in an attempt to loosen himself, unfortunately  this caused the vines to tighten further around him, Draco began to panic and a small whimper escaped from his lips then he heard a sickening snap as his wrist was broken, he fought the darkness that was threatening to take hold of him. Suddenly a jet of bright blue flames burst across his vision and he was dropped, unceremoniously on to the stone floor beneath him.
‘ I think you should wake Mr Potter now he will be eager to see you’re ok.’ Draco looked at her confusedly and she inclined her head in the direction of Draco’s left shoulder. Draco turned and was faced with the messy brown hair of Harry. Harry had his arms folded beneath his head and was asleep, still wearing his glasses although they were slightly askew. Draco turned back to Madam Pomfry,
‘Draco,’ he said as he greeted him with a warm smile, ‘Draco thank you so much for my present I...I...I love it,’ and with that he flung the arm not holding the chess set around Draco’s shoulder, Harry instantly regretted this as Draco had flinched at the contact. Harry tentatively removed his arm and stared at Draco, he was hurt and very confused, they hugged each other all the time since Halloween, what has happened? What was different? What had he done? Harry looked at Draco waiting for an explanation, but the hurt was evident on his face.
Harry was worried as he approached the trophy room that night.  He opened the door and looked at where Draco was sat. The blonde was sat with his back to a wall, shirt sleeves rolled up to his elbows and he was surrounded by books . Harry rolled his eyes, ‘Seriously?’ he thought, if it wasn’t Hermione it was Draco, revision notes were coming out of his ears.
The next night, and the one after that Harry went back to the mirror, eager to see his family again.
Just then Professor Flitwick appeared, Harry tried not to laugh at the look of horror on Draco’s  face when Professor Flitwick’s eye fell on Harry’s broom. ‘Yes,yes that’s right,’ said the Professor, ‘What model is it?’
Draco’s head jerked back in surprise, his cool demeanour shattering in an instance ‘Harry’s devastated ? Surely he is just upset that he’s been caught out?’
Draco shook his head in shock, ‘I don’t believe it, imagine, imagine if it hadn’t let you decide, just imagine where we’d be now.’
‘You were brave enough to go to Dumbledore and put things right, even when he offered me help to my face I couldn’t.’
‘Drake I know, you know now, we can move on, but I really can’t let you do this to me again.’ Harry turned and threw his leg over Draco so that he was straddling his thighs, ‘One more chance mister, don’t screw it up.’ He tilted his head and leaned towards his boyfriend, lips parted in anticipation, Draco tilted his head to mirror Harry, placing his hands on the brunette’s hips and pulling him more snugly against his front. Lips met and bodies were filled with a searing warmth, Harry’s hands clasped at Draco’s shoulders as though he never wanted to let go. Draco’s hands snaked around Harry’s waist pulling him in to a tight embrace flush against his chest. Eventually, and with much regret  the kiss broke and Draco rested his head on Harry’s shoulder, ‘I am so sorry Harry.’
‘You did what? Draco I can’t believe you, why can’t you let yourself be happy?’ Pansy sat heavily down on the green, high- backed sofa next to Draco.
Some hints of sexy times right at the beginning. If this isn't for you start reading after the first cut :)
Draco heard the chair next to him scrape across the stone floor and Pansy lowered herself in to it crossing one long leg across the other as she did so.
Harry sagged further in to the sofa with a groan, ‘I feel humiliated, hurt, disappointed, I guess I’m just glad I never slept with him.’
Harry swallowed the quickly reappearing lump in his suddenly very dry throat, he thought about what Ron was asking. Ron had asked a simple question suddenly giving voice to all those feelings that had confused him so much. Harry struggled to formulate an answer, not wanting to lie to his friend but unsure whether he wanted to voice his feelings so soon.
‘See you tomorrow Draco,’ said Hermione, then looking at Harry she smiled, ‘ Meet you in the common room,’ and with that she skipped off up the stairs. The two boys stood and watched her go then turned to each other.
Hermione whirled round to face Ron stopping him in his tracks, ‘I am fully aware of what he said Ronald, I was there remember, sat right there, next to you.’
Draco re-read the odd looking piece of lined parchment that Hermione had sent, he closed his eyes and sat back with a groan, ‘Draco?’ Pansy asked, without a word he passed her the parchment. Pansy’s eyes widened as she read the note, ‘Oh Draco,’ she said, ‘I’m sure he’s fine,’ Draco turned his head away from her and stared unseeingly out of the window, desperately holding back his tears that threatened to spill. Merlin only knew what Harry had gone through this summer, it killed him to think of Harry in pain.
‘Guys I don’t mean to be rude,’ Neville interrupted quietly, heat rising a little in his cheeks as though he was embarrassed at his own outburst  ‘but can we fill her in later, we kind of have some important business to discuss.’ Blaise stood at his side with a hand on the small of his back in a silent show of support and nodded his agreement.
‘Oh god Drake I’m so sorry I didn’t think, ‘Harry removed his arms from around Draco, ‘ I just saw you and wanted to help, I knew this would help,’ he said gesturing to the salve. Harry was surprised to see a smirk on Draco’s face, Draco raised an eyebrow; ‘Drake?’ he asked.
Harry sighed, ‘ Not now Colin.’ The small blonde boy looked up at Harry with an adoring smile and said dreamily, ‘Okay Harry, anything for you Harry.’
At this the grey eyes filled with fear and Severus just made out the whispered words ‘what have I done?’
When the voices had retreated in to the distance, Harry turned to Draco and tilted his head up kissing him on the lips again for the briefest moment.
‘I know Blaise, but there’s just something about him, I feel drawn to him, I don’t want to hurt anyone, I don’t want to take him away from Granger but what about me? I was so happy over summer, every owl I got made my heart leap at  just even the thought that it was from him, and when it was, well I can’t begin to explain, my Mother thought I was losing it, smiling all the time like that, in fact I’m sure I was one Owl away from being committed to St Mungo’s. Why does he have to have a girlfriend? Why does it hurt so much?’
Draco had overheard two Gryffindor  girls talking about Hermione and knew that Harry would be worried.
Draco was not happy at all. The dark was not his friend, the dark was a place of nightmares, every sound made him twitch nervously , at least in the light you could see danger coming and prepare for it. If he was honest he was terrified. He watched Harry from the corner of his eye, he seemed almost peaceful. Suddenly Harry’s fingers touched his own, he breathed in sharply at the contact but did not move his hand. He did not want to, he welcomed the contact and wanted it back. Just as suddenly he felt the smaller hand creep in to his, fingers lacing in between his own. Draco suddenly felt warm, very warm, but in a good day, like basking in the sun on a warm summers day. He liked the feeling although could not explain it. The hand fit in his, it did not feel strange or alien, it belonged, it was where it was supposed to be. Draco felt his hand being squeezed , Harry was letting him know he was there for him, Draco squeezed back, letting Harry know he was there for him to.
Carefully Draco removed the sketch pad that was his most closely guarded secret and handed it to Harry almost shyly as a pink tinge crossed his cheeks.
Harry was snapped out of his thoughts by Neville, ‘We shouldn’t just leave him here though, what if The Basilisk comes ?’ Draco lifted one should in an elegant half shrug and turned back to Lockheart, ‘You are capable of shutting your eyes yes?’ Gilderoy nodded once, seemingly rendered mute by the mere thought of the Basilisk. ‘Good, that settles it, let’s go.’
‘Draco, I love it,’ Harry said as he jumped up, wrapping his arms around the Slytherin’s neck and knocking him down onto the bed, ‘umpf’ was the noise Draco made as he had the wind knocked out of him. Harry laughed and braced himself on his arms to allow Draco to breathe. Draco looked up in to smiling eyes, ‘Well I’m glad you like it.’
Harry stared as the words formed on his parchment, wonderful he thought  just what he needed, he sighed and penned his reply leaning back against the wall in the quiet corner of the Trophy room.
Harry pulled away from the embrace and looked up in to his boyfriend’s eyes, ‘Draco, I need to tell you something.’ Draco noted a hint of anxiety in Harry’s words and looked down in concern; he lifted a hand to brush through the boy’s unruly hair, ‘What is it?’ Harry swallowed and laced his fingers with Draco’s free hand, ‘Let’s sit,’ he said.
‘Right,’ Blaise said, ‘ I need to finish packing, join me, both of you,’ pointedly looking at Draco.
Harry smiled at the blond, ‘I know and I’m grateful nut I’ve definitely done enough killing for a lifetime,’ Harry continued before  Draco could react to that,’ I wouldn’t be averse to some good old Slytherin plotting and  revenge though if you’re up for it? I was almost sorted in to Slytherin you know.’
Draco looked at Harry, ‘Yes’ he said slowly, inclining his head in the direction of the sofa where Ginny was sat seemingly watching their every move, ‘Weasley, the female one, over there. What on earth would she say if she saw you sneaking off somewhere with me? Wouldn’t want to give her the wrong impression now would we?’
Harry stood up and walked across the compartment and sat down next to Ron placing a supportive hand on his shoulder.
Harry entered Madam Malkin’s shop alone and feeling nervous. Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.
At this Draco smiled and thought to himself for a minute before turning to look in to those big green eyes and saying, ‘it’s okay, you trusted me twice already tonight , I think I can return the favour, I have never actually used that spell before but..’ Draco thought about how to continue, ‘...well I get locked in my room a lot at home and that is the spell Father uses when he’s ready to let me out.’
years retired to their shared common room. They were joined by Luna, it was an unspoken agreement that she was officially one of them, she had fought side by side with them and earned her place in their hearts. Luna was given the password to the common room and told to treat it as her own. The blonde girl smiled dreamily at this and hoped the Nargles would not mind so much.  Taking her place on the knee of her boyfriend she fitted in completely. Seeing Luna there reminded Harry of another younger student that had also fought beside them.
Pansy had been standing back watching the altercation with tears silently making their way down her face. She remembered vaguely questioning the relationship Draco had with Potter but looking at her friend now there was no way this was anything but genuine. She had never seen Draco like this before, he very rarely lost composure and never to this degree, the Draco she knew bottled his feelings up tightly no what. To see him this way was frankly terrifying. She stepped forward, unwilling to let Blaise bear the brunt of his anger, the moment she moved Draco’s head snapped around and his fierce glare was directed straight at her, ‘and you, ‘he accused pointing a finger in her face. ‘Tell me, tell me you wouldn't if it was Weasel, tell me and I’ll stop.’ Pansy couldn’t tell him that, ‘I did though didn’t I? I did exactly what you want to do, but the difference is that I went when I wouldn’t set a thousand tongues wagging. What exactly do you think will happen if you go marching in to the hospital wing now in this temper and demand to see Harry Potter? I’ll tell you what, you’d get bloody lynched that’s what.’ pansy saw the moment that Draco stilled, the moment the look of recognition passed across his face. He sat down with a thump and dropped his head in his hands with a whimper. Blaise dropped to a crouch in front of him, ‘I’ve spoken to Nev and Weasley has taken Harry his parchment so you can contact him, where’s yours?’ Draco lifted his head slowly, ‘It’s in the dorm, I didn’t want to take it out of the castle in this weather and risk it getting ruined.’ he stood up abruptly once more, ’I need to go back and get it.’ Blaise exchanged a wary look with Pansy which Draco caught, he threw his hands up in a s how of submission. ‘Look, I get it, I’ve been a git, but I heard what you said, even if I went to the Hospital Wing there’s no way I’d be allowed to see him, going back to the dorm is my best chance of speaking to him, I promise I won’t do anything ridiculous,’ with one more look the trio left the room and headed towards the Slytherin common room.
Draco had successfully managed to sneak Harry in to the Slytherin dungeon and now that sat crossed legged facing each other on Draco’s bed with Harry’s chess set in between them, the concentration on Harry’s face was evident as the tip of his tounge stuck out of the side of his mouth.
Draco smiled at Harry’s nickname for him for him, bloody hell this boy never ceased to amaze him. He hugged Harry, burying his head in his shoulder, Harry smiled, ‘idiot,’ he chuckled.
The dormitory was dark and quiet when Harry burst through the door. Seamus and Dean were already asleep but Neville witnessed the distraught boy throwing himself on his bed and heard him sobbing quietly in the dark. It took him a few seconds of indecision before he made his mind up and made his way across the room to Harry.
A few minutes went by where Harry could picture a very stubborn Draco Malfoy being bribed and quite possibly blackmailed in to talking to Neville. Harry’s heart sped up as wonderfully familiar handwriting appeared before them;
He risked a glance to his left at the blond beside him and suppressed a sigh. How things could have been different, had he been brave enough, had he known Draco was gay he may never have gone anywhere near Seamus in the first place and where would they be now? Certainly not here. Harry shook himself internally, there was no point dwelling on that now and anyway, there was no way someone like Draco would look twice at him, he was a mere speck next to the tall Slytherin, the thought itself is laughable. If only there was a way that he could have just a small amount of attention from the boy beside him he knew he would be happy.
‘Well no one really knows until they get there, but I know i’ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been.’ Was it Harry’s imagination or did he catch a small sigh escaping Draco’s lips?
Harry felt as though he had to almost creep into the room so as not to disturb the peace. He could not take his eyes from Draco's face. Draco seemed lost in his own world, so Harry took this rare opportunity to look his fill. His eyes roved over every inch in the boy in front of him lingering at the pale lips that were settled in to a natural pout, Harry fought the sudden urge to just grab Draco and kiss him senseless. He knew that before he could do that, he needed to fill him in about the day’s events.
Draco begrudgingly agreed and after saying goodbye to Snape he left the dungeons, at least he knew Harry was going to be ok.
Draco was so annoyed and frustrated. Bloody Flint. He’d feigned some form of wrist injury so the Quidditch fixtures had had to be changed meaning they would not be playing today. The only upside as far as Draco could see was that they would not have to play in the torrential rain storm that was currently enveloping the castle grounds. However, he would still much rather by flying up there with Harry rather than huddled under an umbrella with Blaise and Pansy. To top it off the visibility was so low he could barely see a thing, he had already confiscated a set of binoculars from an unwitting first year but the difference that made was marginal.
A hooded figure came crawling along the ground towards the unicorn like a hunter stalking its prey. The boys stood in a trance as the figure bent over the unicorn and began to drink its blood. Instinctively Draco dragged Harry behind him just as the boy was knocked to the ground by the searing pain that was slicing through his head.  The hooded figure raised his head and looked straight at Harry.
Harry pulled back from the Pensive and looked in shock at his best friend, ‘Thanks for sharing that mate,’ he said quietly, still in awe of what he had seen. Ron merely shrugged seemingly too caught up in the memory to speak for the moment.
Harry inwardly groaned as he was disturbed from his own very interesting thoughts, it crossed his mind to pretend to be asleep, but then a conversation with Ron might help pass the time.
Harry smiled at this as he remembered what had happened but then he filled Ron in on the stry that Draco had come up with.
It just wasn’t possible, Harry had checked, and checked again, then once more just to be sure but no, Draco Malfoy was nowhere to be seen on the map. Harry was starting to panic, where could Draco have disappeared to. Just then Harry heard someone moving around in the dorm room and whipped his curtains open to see Neville on the other side of the room about to change into his pyjamas. ‘Nev’ he hissed loudly across the room making the small boy, who had thought he was alone, jump from shock. Neville span around quickly to see where the noise had come from and spotted Harry’s head peering at him from around his curtains. ‘Nev, come here,’ Harry hissed again sticking a hand out to beckon his friend. Neville placed his pyjamas back down on his bed and walked over to Harry, Neville let out a yelp as, once he was close enough, Harry’s hand had shot out and pulled him on to the bed beside him  drawing the curtains closed once more.
Draco smiled as he replied, ‘I’m here, you have no idea how could it feels to finally hear from you,’ Draco physically felt the tension drain from his body as he settled more in to his bed.
Harry’s had snapped around, ‘Mione, I can’t believe that you’d ask that we have only been together a week it’s still early days.’
‘I’m lost, I have no idea where I am, I am supposed to be shopping for school supplies with the Weasley’s and meeting Hermione, and, well, apparently floo travel does not suit me.’ Harry said looking down at himself. Draco pressed a hand to his own face and sighed, with his hand still covering his eyes he asked,
Draco folded the parchment with a smile and placed it carefully in to the pocket of his robes, he looked up and gave an almost imperceptible nod to the green-eyed Gryffindor who was watching him intently. They really were going to have to talk about subtlety.
‘Pans..’ Draco spoke softly in the quiet of the Hospital wing. ‘ He did an amazing thing for you today, something that none of us are ever going to be able to thank him enough for, but you need to let this go, even if he did feel the same he would never hurt Hermione this way, you have to see that.’
Without another word Harry began to move once more, the movements were small and stilted as Harry nervously watched for Draco's every reaction, he could not deny how nice this felt or the pleasure that was coursing through his veins at that very moment, each press against the hardness in his boyfriend's trousers sent shivers up his spine, feeling it hard against his buttocks was undeniably amazing, and if this felt this good then he could only imagine how good other things would feel, as his thoughts gave way to all the things that they might do in the future his movements unconsciously sped up, he knew this was where they were headed and was determined to enjoy every second.
‘Mmm’ Harry mumbled as though he was half asleep, ‘Yeah, yeah of course.’ Draco smiled down at the small boy, ‘what that’s settled, we should stay in here.’
Harry soon came to an abrupt halt under the stern glare of Madame Pomfrey, Harry, for once, had the grace to look ashamed and cast his eyes downward as he made his way towards Ron. With a sinking feeling Ron spotted a tight black bundle shoved tightly under Harry’s left arm, without a doubt they were his fresh clothes and robe for the day, lovingly creased and crumpled in Harry’s usually rushed morning routine, Ron sighed inwardly, he supposed he should just be grateful that Harry has brought him his robes at all. He was being allowed to leave the Hospital wing and Harry had agreed to bring a change of clothes so that he could head straight down to The Great Hall for breakfast. His back had been healed but Madame Pomfrey has said it would take around a week for the twinges of pain to leave him completely.  With a grateful smile to Harry Ron began to change.
Harry looked back at the snake, it truly was beautiful, Harry was mesmerised by it, it looked so real, and he felt as though it could slide right off Draco’s skin. ‘You’re beautiful,’ he hissed at it, he saw the sharp intake of breath as Draco’s stomach contracted and his mind flooded with images of the perfect blond above him, he continued to whisper to the snake, knowing he wasn’t talking to it anymore; ‘You’re beautiful, look at you just stood there in touching distance I could just reach out and hold you, tell you how much I want you, if I only I could tell you how I feel, tell you that I’m in love with you…’ before Harry could get another word out he was hauled to his feet, the startled sound escaping from his lips was blocked as soft lips were pressed against his own with an urgency Harry had never felt before.
Draco slowly lowered his head at the sound. There, stood barely a foot away was Potter. He seemed to be twitching nervously but Draco didn’t care the man was gorgeous. The emerald green shirt he wore pulled tight in all the right places, it fitted in such a way that Draco could see every line in the fit seekers body, the short sleeves pulled tight across his biceps as Harry nervously dug his hands in to the pockets of his tight jeans.  Draco tried to remain calm at the sight and merely raised a perfectly shaped eyebrow in response. He watched as Harry lifted a hand to the back of his neck as if to rub at the muscles there.
‘Come sit down.’ Harry motioned Draco to their spot by the wall and sat down, sliding his back down the wall as he did so. Harry looked at his boyfriend and saw fear clouding his grey eyes, he reached out and took his hand , giving it a quick squeeze, ‘Don’t worry, I just need to tell you some things.’
The moonlight left striped bars across the stone castle floors, Draco chose to step around these to lessen the chance of being caught. So far the pendant had not moved, Draco had not expected it to, not until he would need to turn to climb the stairs to the seventh floor. Eventually, Draco reached the foot of these stairs and looked expectantly at the pendant waiting for it to turn. The pendant remained stubbornly pointing forwards. For a second he thought that the pendant was broken, Draco turned on the spot so that he was facing back towards the way he had just come, slowly the pendant turned around so that it was now pointing right through him. Draco turned on the spot again and again the pendant turned in its spot on his hand. What on earth was Harry doing?  For a moment Draco was annoyed , so Harry was up and about  he just hadn’t felt the need to see Draco. Forgetting about being caught Draco purposely strode forward , he felt anger and upset bubbling inside him, he would find Harry and demand an explanation, he felt he was owed one.
Harry put his whole body in to the kiss pulling himself as close to Draco as possible. This movement shot amazing sensations through Harry’s body, so he did it again and then again. He soon discovered that moving on top of Draco like this while they were kissing was the most amazing feeling, he never wanted it to end. He could tell that Draco was feeling something similar judging by the fingertips that were currently digging into his sides, he wondered briefly whether they would leave marks but then promptly decided he didn’t care as he moved against Draco once more.
Severus inclined his head after a moments thought, ‘You may ask but that does not guarantee an answer, that all depends on what it is you ask?’
‘Did you see his face, the great lump?’  Draco muttered this out loud and instantly regretted it as he realised his fellow Slytherin’s had heard him. Had Harry? Please, had Harry? His eyes searched the crowd of red and gold in front of him, no he didn’t think he had, thank goodness.
Harry met Ron’s eye, ‘Is anything missing?’ the red-headed boy asked, Harry shrugged, ‘Let’s look, Dean, Seamus could you go and ask around , only a Gryffindor could have gotten in and done this.’ Dean and Seamus shared a looked and left the dorm with a nod to Harry. ‘Ron,’ whispered Harry, ‘ Shut and lock the door will you,’ Ron looked at his friend in askance but did what had been requested of him, no sooner than he had turned the key he heard a rustle of material, as he turned he was greeted by the two Slytherin’s that had been hidden, until then, from sight, ‘Bloody hell,’ Ron said, ‘a bit of warning next time yeah.’
Ron raised terrified eyes to Professor Snape and gulped as he pushed his stool back from his desk and slowly made his way to the ingredient store.
‘K Drake, I’m coming.’ Harry mumbled as he struggled to his feet, Draco chuckled and helped his friend, tucking him under his arm just as Blaise had done with Neville, he led Harry to their bad and sat him down on the edge, turning the bed covers back as he did so. Harry smiled sleepily up at him and Draco felt his hurt flutter, what was it about this boy? Draco dreaded to think what his Father would say if he could see him now, he shook his head almost imperceptibly trying to banish any thoughts of Lucius and climbed in beside Harry.
Draco faltered when he realised he still had Harry in his arms, bloody hell, he thought, the only person he had ever held like this was his mother after another of his father’s drunken outburst. He slowly removed his arms , ‘so... erm... yeah... I’m made up for you I really am and don’t worry friends don’t tell.’
Just then Harry stirred at his side. ‘Draco you’re awake, are you ok? Madam Pomfrey is he ok? What happened?’ these words tumbled out of Harry’s mouth as he tried to ask all the questions at once.
Hermione looked a little flustered at Blaise’s confession but decided to move on with the game and cleared her throat, ‘so Blaise, your turn.’
Harry sat wide-eyed in his friends embrace, he was quite happy there, although he had been shocked at first. He actually found himself not wanting to move.
The comment, coupled with the tremor in Harry’s voice made Neville raise an inquisitive brow. He placed the shears down on the window ledge and turned to face his friend whilst he walked his hands on the seat of his trousers. ‘ Sure’ he said, looking at Harry with concern as he closed the gap between them, ‘what’s wrong?’ As Neville watched a pink tinge crept slowly up Harry’s neck, Neville was shocked to realise that Harry was blushing.
Soon enough it was there turn to bow to the Hippogriffs. It was going so well, well until Pansy turned to him, completely innocently and said ‘oh Draco aren’t they ugly.’ Before he could formulate a response, the beast before them reared up on to it’s  hind legs.  Before Draco had time to react a streak of red flashed across his vision. It all seemed to happen so quickly, the Hippogriff took a swipe at Pansy with its huge talons, but somehow Ron had got there first. He pushed the girl to the floor, covering her slight body with his. Ron roared with pain as the talons landed on his back carving out a huge gouge in the flesh. Blood spurted   from the wound, someone screamed and Harry raced to his friends side. Hermione was stood still, face ashen in shock, taking in the scene before her. Draco could clearly see Pansy, still lying beneath her saviour, tears were string down her face as she reached forward to wipe a tear from Ron’s face. The class were whispering around them , completely confused by what they had just witnessed.
The cries of shock and outrage from around him were nothing compared to the looks of confusion that crossed the three usually stoic faces in front if him. They knew the truth about Black so why the hell was he running round breaking in to the castle and attacking portraits ?
'Blaise?' asked Draco cautiously. Blaise turned to meet his friends eye, 'Another time Draco.' As curious as he was Draco merely nodded in reply.
‘No, it’s ok, you’re already doing everything you can, it’s up to me now isn’t it? Only I can sort this out.’ Harry brought his drink up to his lips, relishing the ice cold feeling on his tongue.
Draco smiled as he pushed the parchment back under his pillow, it had been a good day all round and he had some funny memories of Weasle to keep him going for a while.
Draco swore at that moment that he forgot how to breathe; the warmth of the room was clearly getting to him. There was no way on earth he had heard what he thought he had heard., he was definitely hallucinating. There was no other way to explain it. He took and deep breath, swallowed hard and turned to face Harry.
Harry noticed that Draco had picked up Riddle’s diary and his heart sank. He had not had chance to tell his boyfriend about this particular find, and, if he was completely honest he wanted to keep it to himself just a little longer, he had been planning to show him that night and now Draco knew he had hidden something from him. Harry realised suddenly that he was still being watched and thought what he must look like kneeling on the floor silently watching Draco Malfoy examining one of his possessions;
Before he could stop himself Harry found himself shouting, ‘because he’s my friend,’ right in to Ron’s very red face. Ron swung his fist and it connected with Harry’s jaw knocking Harry off his feet. The two boys stared at each other as Harry brought his hand up to rest on his jaw.
Ron threw him an evil glare and pushed himself up from the floor, 'Is there a reason you think I need reminding of that you prat? My sister and best friend are in there, and Pansy too'.
‘Urgh!’ he groaned and flopped down on the sofa snatching a chocolate frog from Goyle’s hand as he did.
Ron pulled on his trousers after giving them another vigorous shake and dared to glance around at his class mates, it was obvious that they were all wanting to laugh and only their stern teacher was preventing them. Ron felt the heat flare in his cheeks as their colour rivalled that of his hair, he was never going to live this down, at least he had decided against his Willy the Whizz boxers at the last minute.
years had been back at school for two months now and things had changed drastically for Draco. Over the summer he had connected with his Aunt Andromeda who had willingly invited him in to her home and he had stayed with her refusing to return to the Manor he had once called home. His Mother and Father struggled with the decision and once his Father had been hauled off to Azkaban his Mother had retired to the South of France and he had not seen her since. Draco’s life now revolved around the small child that was his cousin Teddy and he was fine with that, it worked, well it had until Teddy’s Godfather had come to visit and over weeks of stilted conversation and caring for Teddy Draco had fallen in love. Draco felt like he had been hit by the Knight Bus when he realised what the strange feeling building within him was. He had no idea he even liked boys and here he was watching Harry bloody Potter’s every move with wide eyes, he knew it was love because he couldn’t describe how he felt. Harry’s smile was the brightest thing that he had ever seen seemingly lighting up their surroundings at a moment’s notice, on more than one occasion Draco had had to stop himself reaching out and touching Harry, nothing sexual, just touching his arm or shoulder, any contact would have done. Draco had found himself doing anything to make Harry smile even if it required making a fool of himself, blowing raspberries on Teddy’s stomach or making animal noises for the infants entertainment, anything to see those brilliant green eyes light up, he really cared what Harry thought of him.
‘Charming!’ said Harry as he propped himself up on his elbows.  Draco’s head snapped round, he had not even realised Harry was on his bed with him. ‘Sorry Harry...’ before he could continue he noticed the damp patch of drool on Harry’s t-shirt. Three things happened at once, Draco went bright pink, let out a load groan and buried his head in his hands.’ Harry stared at him, confused and if he was honest with himself a little concerned, what was wrong? He then realised where Draco had been looking and stared down at his chest. Harry laughed out loud which caused Draco to groan louder;
The first whistle of the Hogwarts express pierced the air, children and families were milling around, hurried hugs were given, luggage and pets changed hands, barked instructions and warnings to behave, like any other time, but something was wrong. Draco could feel it in the air, something not quite right, something missing, he just could not say what. His sharp eyes narrowed as they moved across the platform around him, taking in the usual sights, nervous first years up to  calm and collected seventh years but he could not stop the feeling of unease that was growing inside him. His eyes fell on a family of red heads a little further down the platform to his right, his eyes became dangerous slits as they landed on the small ginger Weaslette, her big stupid eyes wide as she started dumbstruck at her mother. There was no way she was competition, Draco simply would not allow it, Harry was his that was the beginning and end of it all, she would learn one way or the other. His attention was drawn to the older female Weasley and immediately realised that something was wrong, her eyes were wide and the look of panic was etched on to her face, fear evident on those bright eyes. Her husband was talking loudly with the conductor, arms thrashing around him in wild gesture, his face as red as the hair of his many children. Draco took in each Weasley’s face in turn trying to work out what was going on, not that he cared, the oldest Weasley child was wearing an impassive expression although his lips were pinched firmly together, the clones were whispering feverishly together, gesturing with their hands. A crowd was starting to form around them, but it wasn’t until Draco saw Hermione making her way dutifully towards the red-headed family that Draco realised what was wrong with the picture in front of him, there was one Weasley too few, and, his eyes widened at the realisation, there was a distinct lack of Potter. His eyes quickly danced back across the platform in case he had somehow missed the two boys, he did not see them anywhere. As his eyes once again fell to the Weasley’s he watched in shock as Mr Weasley began pounding on the brick wall that was supposedly the way back to King’s Cross Station, except that it wasn’t, right at that moment it was a solid brick wall. Two witches surrounding a now frantic Mrs Weasley and gathered her in to their arms as witch after wizard fired spell after spell at the solid brink wall, nothing had any effect. Suddenly the second whistle of the train pierced the air, the students needed to be on board, the train was preparing to leave, a few uncaring students clambered aboard without ever looking back. Mrs Weasley was attempting to convince her four children and Hermione to get on the train, in the end she barked out an order that silenced the entire platform and the five students climbed sullenly on to the train. Draco watched them, he hated not knowing what was going on, he wanted to know where Harry was, what had happened? He wanted to go over and ask, he knew he couldn’t, he knew he never would be able to and that thought hurt. There was a small cough from behind Draco and he turned to look in to the steely grey eyes of his father who was blinking at him expectantly,
‘You did all that for me, the details, the things you noticed...’ Draco’s voice trailed off as his breath caught.
The red-head  ran a hand through his shoulder length hair, ‘Mate, Hermione told you, no one else can hear it the first time and plus’, he said with another shrug, ‘we were so stressed, there was so much going on we didn’t even kiss until, well you know.’
Ron stood solidly as the girl he loved beat savagely at his chest. He took it; he knew he deserved it, for leaving them, for leaving her. He watched as Harry walked away, giving them a moment alone. His heart ached as he looked at the pain etched on her beautiful face, it was soul destroying to know he had been the cause of it. She looked up, tears staining her deep hazel eyes, clearly desperate to say something and then it happened, the air filled with the glorious sound of Hermione’s voice ‘You're breaking my heart if you leave me now, don't want to wait forever’ Ron watched the hazel eyes widen  in shock as she realised what had just happened, but, without missing a beat, the song, that had been raging around in Ron’s head for well over a year, came pouring out in response; ‘Baby it's all or nothing now, don't want to run and I can't walk out’.
Ron had appeared for breakfast and sat in his usual seat across from Harry and Hermione, all his favourites piled high on the plate before him, he picked up his fork and pierced a sausage before risking a glance at Hermione. The girl in question looked tired, her eyes ringed with dark circles, Ron knew without asking that it was because of him, there was no coming back from what he had done for Pansy yesterday, he could argue that he would have done the same for anyone but Hermione would know, she would know it was a lie, she knew him like that. Hermione was clever, really clever, there was no point trying to lie, to talk his way out of it. He doubted she would even talk to him, but he needed to try. ‘Mione’, he said quietly across the table, just loud enough to get her attention. Her eyes snapped up to him glaring at his audacity to actually speak to her, he watched her knuckles grow white as her hand tightened around the fork in her hand. Ron opened his mouth as if to speak again and Hermione slammed her fork down, grabbed her bag and stormed from the Great Hall. Ron’s eyes dropped to his unfinished breakfast, he couldn’t leave this any longer. With a sigh he put down his fork and made to follow her.
It was the welcome feast  and whilst the Greta Hall was still buzzing with talk of the Dementors Draco was watching the staff table and quietly observing Professor Snape, he was absolutely fascinated with the Potions Professors behaviour,  he had known the man all of his life and had never seen him behave the way he was now, Snape was staring intently down at the dinner plate in front of him as though hoping to bore a hole in it, but, every thirty seconds or so his eyes would flick to the side, quickly glancing at the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor before snapping back to the untouched food in front of him, if Draco didn’t know better he would have sworn that the tips of the man’s ears were turning pink.
Draco stretched further and reached his long legs out to place on the walnut coffee table in front of him. He was just contemplating going to have a nice relaxing bubble bath that he was so partial to, when he felt the parchment in his back pocket vibrate. Instantly a feeling of guilt flooded him, why hadn’t he done that? Why hadn’t he sent a message to his boyfriend as soon as he could?  He stood up and nodded good night to the few students who remained littered around the common room and walked briskly to his room.
Draco swallowed, and reached up to take Harry’s hand, ‘I know,’ turning the hand so that he could press a kiss to it. ‘ I listened to the song I heard you, I did this to show you I had heard, the song told me I would have to make you sit up and pay attention, especially after what I did. I’m so sorry Harry, I thought it was some sick joke.’ Harry closed his eyes and felt tears begin to form, he could have this, he could be happy. He smiled slowly realising that it was his, it was finally here. He moved his hand so that it rested on the back of Draco’s head, he threaded his hands in to the fine blond hair and pulled Draco forward in to a fierce, burning kiss. The hall erupted in to wolf whistles and cat-calls as he melted in to the kiss. Harry vaguely heard McGonagoll trying to restore some form of order as he pulled away, he rested his forehead against Draco’s, ‘We can really do this can’t we.’ Draco nodded a small smile ghosting his lips, ‘We can, as the song says, you’ll never give up’. Harry smirked and dropped his hand to hold Draco’s, ‘You’re damn right I won’t, now come on’, he said, ‘let’s go someone more private; I want to discuss the next lines of the song.’
The kiss seemed to go on forever, neither boy wanting it to end, until the need to breathe forced them apart. Red-faced and glossy eyed the two boys looked at each other in amazement, each one’s eyes lingering on the others swollen lips as they relived the last few minutes. Harry slowly lifted his fingers to touch his lips; ‘Wow,’ he breathed, then after a beat,‘we are so doing that again.’
‘Weasley has had a bit of a spider issue today Professor,’ came the cool drawl of Blaise Zabini, ‘So I think the prospect of spider’s legs has terrified him.’
‘Draco, last night you woke the whole dorm screaming, you were having a nightmare, I wanted to help you so I got in your bed to hold you and help you. They watched me do it and no one said a word against me, not even Blaise, they just turned and went back to sleep.’
The blond man looked up at him questioningly , with wide, almost innocent, blue eyes, 'That's a funny name, is that my name?' The others watched in shock as Neville dropped to his knees, his hands flew to his face and, within seconds the tunnel was filled with the sound of sobbing. Blaise struggled to stand and made his way over to Neville, 'Nev?' he said cautiously, 'Nev?' he crouched gently next to Neville and placed an arm around the smaller boy.
Ron nodded solemly still holding the other boys hand, 'How did you know what to do?' asked Draco, unable to hold back the question any longer. He had been dying to know but had held back from asking when Ron was concentrating on Blaise, Ron turned to the blond with a small smile, 'Being one of seven, six boys and one Ginny, you get in to some scrapes, there are only so many times that you can come home injured before you start learning to fix them.' Draco smiled and sent a small nod in Ron's direction, wondering what on earth it was that large families got up to that led children to teach themselves healing spells.
Harry was fighting back the tears as he threw himself on his bed, why was Draco such an idiot? He didn’t understand, he knew Draco was different but sometimes the Malfoy that prowled the school corridors showed his face and Harry wished he would stop it he really did. Whilst Harry was lost in his musings he noticed his pillow had begun to vibrate, sighing with resignation he turned and pulled the parchment from its hiding place.
Harry leaned back, ‘Yeah Seamus is the same, he’s so understanding.’ A small smile crept on to Harry’s face, ‘Speaking of Seamus I wonder where he is?’
The three Slytherin’s sat in tense but companionable silence waiting for the return of Hermes. They waited for about an hour before the bird soared in through the open window and landed in front of Draco, he took the parchment from him and fed the black owl a treat from a bowl on his left and unrolled the note:
Draco felt the change in Harry's movements and bit down hard on his bottom lip. The pressure was building up, he knew he didn't have long left no matter how much he wanted this incredible feeling to continue. Draco took a chance and looked up at his boyfriend and this was his undoing the look of pure pleasure on the other boy's face lit a fire within him, he felt his toes curl as he cried out. It was with Harry's name on his lips that Draco came hard into his best trousers.
Draco was lay on his bed arms crossed behind his head and legs crossed at the ankles, his eyes were closed and he was replaying the events of the day, well more specifically the events on the duelling club and the way Harry’s words had made him feel, no matter which way round he looked at it he couldn’t understand it. He had felt as though he was in a bath, the words flowing over him like warm water lulling him to relax. Suddenly  Draco was rudely disturbed from his thoughts as felt his head vibrating in the pattern allocated for a four way chat,  with a deep sigh and without opening his eyes Draco pulled the parchment from beneath his pillow, he inhaled deeply and slowly opened his eyes to read Neville’s untidy message;
‘Oh Hermione wait till I tell you.’ With that he ran to sit beside her on the comfy sofa in front of the fire that she had kept going. He proceeded to tell her what had happened, he had left out the secrets that they had shared but did let her know that Draco was aware that she knew. Hermione was shocked at this, nut with a small, knowing smile let the boy continue. Harry was just telling Hermione about the dog when he realised something,
