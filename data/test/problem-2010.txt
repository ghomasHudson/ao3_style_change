It had been an accident, was the thing. Draco had finished with the first floor elective wing and sat at its crumbling edge, coaxing rubble out of the way, when he noticed the figure cutting across the rolling hills in the bright moonlight.
How his father strode into the Manor as if the world had not been upended, and the remaining Snatchers and Death Eaters gravitated towards him like pixies to a flame. How his mother smoothly, sweetly cajoled them into staying and closed all the exits. How they moved the prisoners, who were surly and suspicious and flinched when Draco took them to be healed by his mother.
“Oh,” said Draco, although he rather felt he would have to. It seemed like the sort of thing he wouldn’t have a choice in, given that it was his recklessness that was the reason Professor Sinistra was starting this crusade in the first place. Like another probationary measure, tacked onto the end of a long, impossible list. “But I can.”
Draco’s head snapped up, all else shoved aside in the face of a dozen puzzles coming together with this revelation. “How long have you had this? How does this
He was still anxious that he’d somehow misheard the Headmistress when she’d told him that, in light of the extensive repairs he’d done, she would happily sign off on those as additional community service hours.
telling me?” Greg’s grumble of irritation was reminiscent of sixth year, and Draco found himself growing irate despite himself.
Here is a list of things that used to be on the list Harry doesn’t like to think about: becoming quidditch captain. Getting a kiss that doesn’t make him uncomfortable. Touching someone, just—once, for long enough that he might even be able to relax into it. Having sex.
They sit in the quiet for several minutes, until their breathing evens out; it’s the sort of quiet that means it’s okay for Harry to burrow into Malfoy’s side, seeking the scent that will follow him long after they’ve parted, for Malfoy to run his fingers through Harry’s curls, detangling the knots in an absent sort of way. These are fragile silences.
Potter snarled, and turned his head sharply away from Draco, towards the window, where the pitch and the forest were lit by the glaring sun. “Give that back.”
Draco stared at her uncomprehendingly. He was quite certain he would have noticed if Zeller had been resorted in the middle of the school year.
aunt,” Malfoy corrects, his arms holding Harry in place when he tries to squirm out of his grip. “Andromeda Tonks.”
Harry stopped next to him, their arms brushing briefly. "Me neither," Harry offered, unnecessarily.
There is a way to explain that he knows Malfoy is a Death Eater without starting by the inexplicable crush of their mouths, without putting words to precisely how he came to see the unsettling blackness of the Dark Mark against achingly soft skin. Harry just hasn’t figured it out yet. All logical and non-incriminating explanations scatter as soon as Harry opens his mouth, reduced to the certainty he’d known, instinctively, that day in Diagon Alley.
Astoria, matching him, asked, “Do you mean it, about Baddock?”
Baddock brightened at the mention, but it was a nervous sort of brightness. “We’ve not participated in a proper tournament since, well, you know. But our team was really quite good before the, um.”
Malfoy’s white-blond head is bowed over a desk on one side of the room when Harry arrives, half-folded origami and loose parchment haphazardly stacked at his elbow, his inkpot perched improbably atop it. The classroom’s built-in
Draco nodded mutely, sullen and ashamed that he could not be trusted with even that. But he stepped into the green flames and waited, like a child on his first floo trip, for her to call out the address of the Supervision and Adjudication Division of the Ministry’s justice department. It was a blur of being checked for potions, his wand and magic inspected, and then another stretch of time of sitting opposite Officer Abbott-Jones as she ran through a list of questions about Draco’s behaviour.
“Are you thinking about killing yourself, Draco?”
Usually that was Madam Pomfrey, coming to him with another assignment. Draco was spending more and more time at the Hospital Wing as term went on, filling his empty hours with the sort of work he’d never once imagined himself doing. Madam Pomfrey had him stripping beds and washing the bedding while her students diagrammed body parts, arteries, veins. Draco could recite some of them, too, because Bellatrix liked to point out which arteries she was severing when the Dark Lord left someone for her to dispose of; and Draco would wash the sheets twice in a row, remembering, unwilling, how quickly blood would pump out of a person, regardless of their magical ability. You’d think having magic would help stem the flow, but it didn’t; it didn’t, and Draco knew, because he had six scars, abdomen to jaw, that proved it.
He'd taken his glasses off, but they were close enough that Harry could still make out the general shape of the sneer Malfoy shot at him.
Two nights became three became six, and before he knew it, Harry had snuck out of the castle with Malfoy nearly the entire week. Mostly, they didn't say anything as they wandered the school and its dark grounds, except to whisper a few heated barbs at each other.
"Okay," Potter said, as if that was reasonable.
Professor McGonagall gave a long speech about decorum, and her high expectations for both houses, but Harry mostly didn't hear her over the blood rushing in his ears. It felt like a very bad joke, that the Slytherins who hated him were going to be living with him now.
No. It was simply not to be done, surviving that just to have Potter shove him off a ledge. Potter probably wouldn’t even mean to do it, was the horrible thing. He’d just trip over one of those awful, unlaced shoes and bump into Draco, no thought at all, and Draco would be dead at the base of the west tower before Potter could figure out the syllables for the word
Draco gave him a dirty look but did not contradict him. Loathe as he was to admit it, the work did go faster with the help of Shardlow, Zeller, and her friends carefully unearthing more and more of the remaining stonework. Hogwarts was reacting to it, too, her magic rippling across them like a relieved sigh as Granger directed the team on the crumbling staircase, siphoning the dregs of dark magic from the steps, while Weasley and Astoria caught the debris with quick charms.
It was a penance for the vanishing cabinet, when he sat himself neatly on the cold, dirty floor and began the tedious work of undoing the spell damage. Hogwarts was old, centuries of students and professors and visitors having left their tiny imprints, so the resulting magical index was eye-watering and confusing.
He padded back to the bed, holding the jumper out with a stiff hand. It felt less like offering a jumper and more like he was holding out a question whose answer could hurt him deeply.
Malfoy stays where he is, hand outstretched. Harry isn’t sure what expression he’s wearing, but it makes the ghost of a grin appear on Malfoy’s face. He says, “People will notice it. I made it too high.”
“Yes, I
"In sixth year," Potter started, very slowly. Draco stiffened, moving away instinctively. But Potter reached out and caught his wrist, frowning mightily. He said, more forcefully, "In sixth year, when I was trying to figure out what you were doing, I tried to get into the Room while you were there."
The universe condensed into a single
Madam Pomfrey, with equal poise, responded, “That must have been very distressing. Would you like to tell me what happened?”
“I don’t,” Potter said, but he took a step back. Color crept into his face. Suspicious, Draco kicked up a leg, throwing Potter off balance, then stood and shot forward, catching Potter by the front of his Muggle jumper. There was a strange pocket in the front, and Draco wasn’t
But the courtyard was empty when Draco rounded the corner; sunlight glinted off the sculptural top of the memorial, highlighted the hedges and ivy at the corners of the space, crawling onto the columns. Draco stopped and stared, unimpeded, at the memorial for the first time since getting to Hogwarts.
Harry tried to speak with McGonagall already.
"I should
Potter had asked once.
okay, so Malfoy would appear appropriately abashed.
to not argue with you again.”
Harry watches the way Malfoy wrinkles his reddened nose at the wind, the way his hair sweeps against his brow, and has to forcibly pull his gaze away to focus on the letter before Malfoy notices his staring.
It wasn’t until Baddock pinned him with a slightly disappointed look that Draco remembered about his promise to try and convince Greg to join the gobstones team. He cleared his throat. “I’ve been very busy,” he tried, though when he tried to recall his days, they were mostly filled with him staring at his bed curtains or blank parchment. “I have to head to the Hospital Wing, in any case.”
“Astoria said she told you about the letter-writing campaign, but you never showed up. Where were you?” Zeller asked. She’d put a bright yellow ribbon in her hair, the bow almost obnoxiously perky given the time of day.
Draco’s breath whistled out of him, fury cresting at the same moment. His face felt blotchy and red when he spat out, “And you’ve never had enough fucking brains to do anything without being told!”
Draco did not acknowledge this statement, though it penetrated his haze. Potter had pulled Draco from a fire. Potter had emerged dead from the forest. Already it felt like eons ago. But it hadn’t been. It still wasn’t.
A smile flashed across the thin sliver of Potter’s face that Draco could make out. “Then maybe we both did it for the same reason,” he said, which was a horrible, cryptic thing to say just as Professor Flitwick came out of his office and headed towards the front of the room. With an irritated flick, Draco undid the silencing charm, wanting desperately to nag Potter about the statement.
Gut sinking, Draco flicked his gaze over to find a veritable wall of crimson and gold filling the seats. Even with the seventh year Slytherins and Draco in attendance, there were at least double the number of Gryffindors in the class, and every single one of them was staring at him.
Harry tilts his head, but doesn’t quite look at Malfoy. “I didn’t mean it,” he says quietly. “I would—I would—”
“Morning, Malfoy,” Officer Abbott-Jones said, putting her teacup down before addressing Headmistress McGonagall with a friendly smile. “I’ll have him back in half an hour.”
“Keep them,” Draco said, that warmth lifting through his chest and making his voice soft and light. He pressed his smiling face against the curve of Potter’s cheek, and thought about kissing him again, thought about the fact that Potter would let him. It was overwhelming in the very best way.
Harry doesn’t feel freezing; his whole body is alight as Malfoy’s cold hands disappear under Harry’s borrowed cloak to ruck up Harry’s shirt and tease the skin above his trousers before slipping deftly lower. Harry rocks his hips forward, groaning low in his throat at the lazy way Malfoy touches him through his pants.
Harry shuts his mouth, but it’s not an acquiescence.
Potter blinked rapidly, surprise morphing into something genuinely upset, which barely crossed his face before settling on anger. His shoulders hitched upwards, the way they did when Draco was trying to hurt him, only Draco hadn’t been trying to. He had just felt exposed, and still did, standing there with the certainty that he should say more but not knowing what it was that needed to be said.
Unrepentant, Hermione says, “I think we should wait outside, Ron.”
Harry doesn’t know which of them will end up dust, once that flame runs out. Maybe it’s both of them. It’s poetic, if it’s both.
And in fact, Potter’s proposition appeared not twenty minutes later, her red hair done in twin braids down each side of her head and dressed in her full quidditch kit.
The pitch was black, the empty stands ominous and foreboding. Even still, Harry felt a familiar swoop that he associated with game day in his stomach. He picked a spot in the middle of the pitch and laid on his back, the grass damp through his robes. After a moment, Malfoy laid down next to him, close enough for their hands to touch.
She asked it with the exact same briskness that she would use if Draco appeared with a broken arm. Something terribly close to gratitude took hold of Draco’s throat and caused a burr in his voice when he said, “I don’t know.”
It infuriated him now, too; a similar sort of helplessness strangled his throat, as well, made hot, angry tears pulse at the back of his eyes.
," Draco continued, barely hearing him.
He was still puzzling this out halfway down the staircase, aiming for the chilly dungeons and their dark corridors, when he remembered that he needed to head to Professor Sinistra’s office. Unlike her Head of House quarters, which were in the same wing as the rest of Slytherin, her office was up by the base of the astronomy tower on the third floor.
Harry felt this was a merciful policy, as he could privately add his own, intensely embarrassing items under this list and then not speak about them, ever, to anyone, and especially not to Malfoy. It was an especially helpful policy to keep in mind when Hermione, looking tired but unharmed, asked in an undertone how their night had gone as they escaped the common room to head to breakfast.
Recently, though, the house in Harry’s imagination is low lit, curtains half-open so only a strip of sunlight spills over folded bits of parchment and crowded side tables and soft, discarded jumpers. The echo of worn arguments fades against the soft murmur of music and the sharp scent of cologne lingers in the air. This home is tender like a bruise or something else once painful. Dream knowledge. They weren’t always together, but they ended up that way. Dream knowledge. They have known each other since the beginning.
He means to shout the last bit like a curse, but it comes out wrong. Raw and wet; gorey, like flinging out his still-beating heart. Harry feels shaky and light-headed, putting his hands on Malfoy’s chests and shoving, hard enough to unbalance the both of them.
, who lived in his
"I think I'm gonna go for a walk," Harry said, a little desperately. He wasn't sure he could stand the anxious way his brain was running around itself.
before he could think twice. He didn’t know the charm Malfoy used to have it fly over to him, but that was easily solved by tossing it at Malfoy’s head as he passed by.
“Not a good one,” Draco said, intrigued. “Worried about what I’d find, Potter?”
of them would know what we’re talking about.”
“Shardlow is a budding prodigy, and I am out of practice,” Draco lied, through his teeth. “Why did you really come here, anyways? Are you stalking me again?”
Whatever Greg said to him next—that would be the truth, irrevocably. Greg understood what the others didn’t, or refused to: Greg had been there for every step of Draco’s bigotry and cruelty and disregard, knew that Draco chose, over and over again, to be unkind and selfish towards even those he considered friends. Greg knew that Draco was a terrible person and that he had encouraged it in others, in a way the others couldn’t because they’d never been close enough to see. Greg knew that it hadn’t been the entry of the Dark Lord into the Manor that made Draco that way. It hadn’t been. It was just Draco. It was just how he was.
Dennis Creevey was the younger brother of a dead boy Draco remembered as a tiny figure behind an upraised camera, which he only remembered because drawing attention to him had been a good way to piss off Potter. He was also the driving force behind the petitions Draco kept seeing; the loss of Colin Creevey had evidently lit some determined flame in the lanky sixth year.
Potter gave up and let half the books spill on top of the table. “I’m trying to figure out what I like.”
Draco’s chest pulsed painfully and he didn’t understand why. He couldn’t answer; his throat was still too dry, and his heartbeat was still too loud, and Potter was still entirely too close.
, Harry would hex their mouths shut.
“Do you think he’ll make you—?” Harry begins, uncertain.
tucked neatly at the end of the long list of prohibitions Draco was meant to memorize. It jolted him from his daze, enough for him to say
"You don't have to come with me!" Harry said in a quick, panicked whisper.
numbness, Draco got up, stretching his shaky legs. Something big and restless circled through his chest, and he found himself walking quickly away from the memorial until he was heading down the staircase towards the dungeons. He took the large, flat steps two at a time, coming to a stop at the bottom and just staying there, at the juncture where one would have to turn to get to the Slytherin common room.
It was horrid, how Draco could still see the tiny second year that Baddock had been superimposed over the burly fifth year he now was. It was horrid, how Draco could remember Greg’s fierce look of concentration while Vince laughed at his side. “I’ll ask,” Draco said.
And before he could open his mouth, the sky exploded into color. A gasp got stuck in Harry’s throat as indistinct splashes of color popped into the air, casting them in sudden light. When Harry sat up, he realized that he could see the wisps of color around the castle, too, high in the sky near the towers.
could have killed the Dark Lord, then!” and Potter got a shifty look and said, “Well there was kind of, I mean there was some other stuff that had to be done, it’s a bit of a long story, honestly—” and barreled towards the lake with his shoulder up by his ears—with Draco’s mounting, horrifying realization that magical Britain could have been destroyed had Potter not been so conveniently fucking
that disappeared before Draco could read the description Officer Abbott-Jones had penned. But it was already written, and that fact alone soured Draco’s stomach.
“She couldn’t have been
? Oh, you’re a complete bastard, Potter.”
They would not be deterred, though Draco was successful in sending Shardlow back to bed and Zeller back to the Hufflepuff common room. The two girls shared a look, but looked properly abashed once Draco glared them down.
But of course Potter heard. “‘S’okay,” he said, stepping closer to speak over the squeal of the train coming to a stop. “Wasn’t expecting anything, really.”
But it was Baddock who spoke next, his voice very blunt. “Terrified. Like the rest of us.”
about it.
The castle unveiled itself across the worn parchment, a magic so neat and intricate that Draco wanted to see the strands of magic that wove it together, the mechanism behind its working. It was a rare want; mostly, it reminded him of the vanishing cabinet, and that soured him on everything else to do with intricate spellwork.
Harry shook his head. He'd scrubbed his face with water, hoping it would wake him from what
Well, Draco thought with a tinge of hysteria, at least the Headmistress couldn’t get mad at him for missing class today.
—until finally, fed up, Draco announced that he was leaving, that they could all figure it out without him, and that obviously they should get to the Hospital Wing, was that not obvious?
So maybe that was why, Draco reasoned. It burned, because there were people who were willing to use what they learned to help complete strangers. It burned, because when Draco had the option, he’d simply turned away or, worse, cast
This is the quietest nightmare Harry has: there is a pool, and he is drowning. The pool is as deep and dark as the Great Lake, though it didn’t seem that way when Harry first had the nightmare. That came later.
Draco reflected on the inevitability of this during his morning ablutions, reviewing his sins as a reminder that he was not and had never been the sort of person Potter would willingly interact with. Whatever impulse had led Potter to the small kindness of returning Draco his wand, of his near friendliness since that day in the Owlery, was only an extension of Potter’s inherent goodness. Potter may still wish Draco dead for any manner of things, may still have hold of the animosity Draco himself could no longer muster; and it may only have been Draco’s baseless expectations that had convinced him, briefly, that it was possible to move on from such immovable fixtures in his life as Potter and his hatred towards him.
Draco’s mouth twisted into an unpleasant smile. “And yet here I am,” he said, with more confidence than he properly felt.
Potter said, “No.”
The common room was quickly divided in half, the prefects a wary line of peace between the borders of the room until night fell and everyone began heading to bed.
Harry fell fast in love with everything he saw on that first gilded day in Diagon Alley, the store displays and impossible doorways and the pale, pointy boy, looking right at him, messy hair and broken glasses and all, who said
“Kid,” she said, which made Draco bristle. “Everyone hates their PO. It’s nothing personal.”
For a long moment, the sounds of working prevailed; Draco’s hand shook as he labelled and stocked the potions in the storeroom. It was quiet. It was so quiet, and Draco had never been particularly fond of the quiet.
“I still love them,” Malfoy points out, and it’s sad and it’s angry and it’s bitter.
Professor Sprout had returned, her normally jovial expression gone a bit hard. It was unclear exactly how much of this conversation she’d overhead, but she nodded at Zeller’s prompting.
. When he was just a pale, pointy boy next to Harry in a robe shop, before he’d opened his mouth and ruined everything before it even started.
When he returned, he found his mother waiting for him, her hair in a simple plait that was startling for its plainness. The tension around her mouth disappeared as he stepped through the doorway, his cloak flapping behind him.
There was a sharpness to her tone that surprised Draco, as if she expected him to argue with her about it.
No, Draco realized, with fatal certainty. Officer Abbott-Jones wouldn’t have to be a Legilimens.
were,” Draco corrected as they reached the common room entrance, which slid away at their proximity to reveal the dim corridor beyond it.
Baddock cleared his throat. Bizarrely, he seemed to take more confidence from Draco’s comment. “Before the war. Before I had to leave Hogwarts, unless I wanted to get my wand snapped or—or worse,” Baddock continued. He was very brave, even if he was mostly speaking into his tea by the end. “We were—we were very good, before that.”
He stood at Draco’s elbow with a pile of books in his arms. The light streaming hazily through the window painted long swatches of gold across the uneven grain of their shared table, across Draco’s hands, to land at Potter’s scuffed trainers.
, Harry thinks impotently.
“Well, someone did something,” Draco said darkly, remembering the Dark Mark across the signature page. The Headmistress had looked tight-lipped when he brought the copy, but the half-dozen defenses Draco had formulated for why he was appearing with it withered away on his tongue when she simply thanked him for reporting the defacement. If she made any announcement about it, it must have been during mealtime, when Draco hadn’t been there.
“What is it?” Potter asked, arms crossed against his chest. He wasn’t looking at Draco, was glaring rather determinedly at the grass. His breath came out in a puff of white, and Draco cast a warming charm over the two of them instinctively.
“My countenance,” Draco repeated dumbly, “about the war.”
An old impatience rose in Draco’s chest the moment he let himself into his mother’s flat with the key she owled him the week before. He closed the thin door to the small bedroom she’d made for him and barely noticed its furnishing. He opened the gift immediately, pushing aside his trunk and feeling his heart kick about in anticipation. He found, even before he finished ripping the paper off the box, that it would not matter whether Potter’s gift was a good one. Perhaps Potter would be bad at gifts, or perhaps Draco would be impermissibly picky. It wouldn’t matter because that part of Draco that had always wished to have attention, to have Potter’s attention, was already ecstatic over the existence of a gift with his name in Potter’s tiny script.
“Without telling anyone?” Potter asked. The peculiarity of the question was abruptly overshadowed by the way it rankled at Draco.
The other two officers grew taller, more alert, the longer Draco failed to answer; both had their wands out, casual and at the ready, while Officer Abbott-Jones’s face, which Draco had never thought of as friendly, seemed to ice over entirely.
want?” Malfoy says snidely, and Harry remembers why he hated this boy so fiercely for so long. Harry puts his hands over his face and makes a garbled, helpless noise of irritation, the words muffled by his hands.
Draco didn’t know the answer to that.
“Wanted to find you first,” Potter answered, an unsure smile crossing his face.
Draco made a very faint noise of disbelief. “No,” he said. He’d gotten very good at ensuring that he and Greg were not alone together, and Draco’s increasingly frequent nightmares ensured that he was often up well before Greg was. By the time Draco went to bed, Greg was usually already asleep, curtains drawn tightly around his bed.
Harry laughs humorlessly. “When did you figure
The letters are few but lengthy, and by the time November is settling into December, Harry is writing to ask if they could meet in person on the last Hogsmeade weekend before term ends.
“You’re telling
, Hermione’s voice says, from very far away. Harry ignores it.
Harry leaves the office with his teeth clenched so tightly, his jaw trembles. The feeling follows him throughout the rest of the day, making his magic unpredictable and his classmates wary and silent.
They’ve done this enough, by now. Maybe not as often as some dark, unexplored part of Harry would like, but enough that anticipation coils fierce and liquid in his gut when Malfoy sits him on the desk, hands already working at undoing Harry’s trousers.
come, won’t you?”
And then they stood in silence, watching the water ripple with the wind, since anything left between them was Not Worth Speaking About.
It was only Friday, the first week back finally coming to a close, and Draco could see the miserable path the year would take: already, his housemates were shifting awkwardly away from him; already, his classmates were shooting him dark looks and whispering the headlines that had run endless circles in his brain those endless hours in his cell, the days into weeks into three months and four days.
Potter, stepping up next to Draco and absolutely covered in dust, except for where his face was protected with an impervious charm, said, “Well, we do need help clearing the rubble. You don’t need much more than a good levitation charm for that.”
So wrapped up was he in this reminder, that he almost failed to notice the stand-off that met him as he walked into the common room.
Quickly, desperately, Draco wheezed out, “I—I forgot, I swear,” which was evidently the wrong thing to say. Not five minutes later, wand seized and dragged into a tiny interrogation room, Draco found himself attempting to relate how he got his hawthorn wand back in increasingly stumbling, shallow-breathed bursts.
“I know,” Draco said, lips thinned. He was still thinking about Potter’s hand in his, and the pull of the forest, of the sky. “But he’s still just Potter.”
. He hadn’t considered what came after that.
“Why the Owlery?” Potter shot back, abruptly angry. Draco was still too shocked to be taken aback by his tone, but it did shake him out of his head. Draco crossed his arms and did a slow spin, considering the area. You could see the castle from here, the high spire of the Owlery at one end and the Gryffindor and Ravenclaw towers at the other. You could see the line of the Forbidden Forest, beyond the stands but somehow very close and pressing ever closer. You could see the sky in a single unbroken stroke overhead. You could even hear the lake, if you listened hard enough.
A reserved sort of panic burst in Draco’s throat. It felt, suddenly, that once this moment slipped away, so too would Potter, and that Draco would never get it—him—back. The desire to step forward immobilized him, and as did the fear of what would happen if he didn’t.
stamped on each edge and began throwing its contents back inside it: the parchments with which he’d taken notes, Draco’s history of magical signature and potions checks, a glaringly orange sheet labeled
—chance I have to find time to speak with her freely. There is no point to any of this if the Dark Lord kills my mother.
Baddock blanched. He looked abruptly like he always did in Draco’s memory, twelve-years-old and lost, nervously shuffling towards his friends. “That’s not true,” he said, and he sounded twelve, too; voice thin and breaking.
But Potter smiled. It was a small smile. He said, “Alright, Malfoy,” and nodded, and left. He rejoined Granger and Weasley, who were giving him truly bewildered looks as he fell into the space they instinctively left for him.
He wasn’t, was the thing. Draco still felt that skitter of fear in his chest, that uncertainty. But it was as if he’d found solid footing underneath it, some truths he could clutch to his chest, heavy and precious stones in a sweaty hand. That this was not a figment of his imagination. That this feeling would not go away, and that it would only grow as it had been since the beginning of the year. That Draco was the only one who could decide, for himself, what it all meant.
“Of course I am,” Malfoy says, with a hint of the haughty tones that have mostly abandoned him since the start of the year. His fingers are gentle when they run over the kissmark. Like this, Harry can almost believe all the things he pretends about the two of them. He closes his eyes. His skin prickles.
“Yeah?” Harry asks, face hot with fury. The tables and bookshelves in the room shake with the force of it. “And what if she
“How’d you find me?” Harry asks, after a few silent seconds of staring at each other, his hand falling away. The cloud of his breath eclipses Malfoy’s face for a moment, a wispy cloud across a heartbreaking sky.
Potter spent his days bracketed between Granger and Weasley, as he’d always done, looking worn and disheveled, his eyes in a constant state of roving, wary alertness. Draco tried not to notice this, the way he tried not to notice many other things: the memorial constructed in the castle’s southern cloister, always teeming with students; the gaps in the portraits lining the halls, charred frames and torn canvas hanging limply; the way grief grabbed hold of students at seemingly innocuous moments and came pouring heedlessly out.
Potter’s fingers twitched; they were paler in the moonlight. “I haven’t flown since,” he started, trailing off.
Draco stayed quiet, his pulse beating very close to the surface of his skin. Potter's hand tightened, but not painfully; the grip was a reassurance, though Draco wasn't sure if it was meant to reassure him or Draco.
Draco didn’t allow himself to question the sudden influx of time he was spending with Potter. It was a focused inattention, because Draco knew that once he’d caught the tail of a single question—why him, for example, or why now, or why did it feel so natural, as much as it felt impossible—then the thought would circle hungrily around his brain. It would plague him the way everything else did.
“—shouldn’t be doing that anyways, there wasn’t a need—”
It sounded stupid when he said it aloud though, and he could feel several pairs of dubious eyes upon him.
“Is that why you sent the letter?”
“There you are,” says Ron’s voice, unexpectedly close. Harry jerks his head up to find Ron giving him a funny look from the foot of his bed. “Thought you might have gone to bed already.”
“Alright?” Potter asked, quietly and without moving away.
“Tergeo,” he muttered, pointing his wand at his hair and siphoning the disgusting liquid from his hair. Someone—probably Baddock—had lovingly draped the Hogwarts Gobstones Team banner, starched and mended, from the top benches. Draco batted the edges away before he could actually sit.
anything," Malfoy answered. He lifted one pale hand and traced the wisping colors swirling through the night sky. "It
“If you enjoy gobstones, you should be able to remain on the team.” She said it firmly, finally, with a look that cowed Draco.
Harry forces his tongue to unstick from the roof of his mouth, his own blood pressure rising in response to Malfoy’s distress. He says, “Malfoy, don’t—”
“Ah.” Draco considered this, feeling very stupid. “The Manor’s magic went a bit—wild.”
An exhale shuddered out of him. Everything felt too big and too bright, like that first day out of Azkaban, when Draco had been captivated and repulsed by the trees lining the Manor’s estate, and the feeling of fine cutlery in his hands, and the wealth of options to clothe himself. He’d spent three months in Azkaban and was staring down a year and a half of probation, and everything that wasn’t the straight, clear fall from a height seemed overwhelming and forbidden. Especially this, a Potter who stood close and quiet and waiting.
“I’m good at gobstones,” Draco said, because surely it couldn’t be that hard.
, Draco wanted to tell him, but of course it had. Magic was another casualty of the war. It had gone, and needed to be coaxed back, forever changed, but Draco didn’t tell Potter this. He simply thought of bells, cascading around them, and conjured more birds, more bubbles of light, more colorful sparks, until Potter opened his eyes again to watch, until the moon lit them silver, until, until, until.
want to join you?”
He was still considering the merits of staying on the ledge when Harry Potter came through the doorway. He had the unhappy look of someone already deeply irritated, his uniform rumpled, and under-eyes smudged with sleeplessness. He stopped in the doorway but did not look surprised to see Draco there. Looked, in fact, like he anticipated that Draco would be here. It was a far cry from that first uncomprehending look in the Great Hall, and though Draco was still not entirely sure what to make of this Potter, who stared unsettlingly into the forbidden forest, it seemed that Potter, whose whole face was alert and tense, had already decided what he thought of Draco.
his eyes seemed to ask.
There was something about the tone of his voice that had Draco looking up sharply. “What do you mean?” he asked, a touch more aggressively than he meant to be.
On Monday evening, Khan found Draco as he was coming out of the Hospital Wing, evidently as she was about to begin rounds with one of the Gryffindor prefects.
The last day of break found Draco tucked at one end of the plush couch in the sitting room that was also the parlour that was also the kitchen, unless one counted the half-wall as a divider, which Draco did not. His mother had left for groceries, passing a hand through Draco’s hair before she left as she’d started doing since the previous night. It was nice, and a little strange, but not moreso than everything else since the war. And certainly not moreso than the letter from Potter that Draco held in one hand.
Baddock grew tense next to Draco but did not move from his side. It was clear that he expected a fight of some sort, and with Potter just standing there without saying anything, Draco could hardly blame him.
?” Draco echoed, in disgust, even though he had. He’d lifted the second page of the petition to find that someone had scribbled
“Well what?” Potter’s voice came out hoarse, as if he hadn’t used it in several days, or weeks. It was possible he hadn’t; Draco was no longer in the habit of listening for Potter’s voice in the halls, primarily because he was no longer in the habit of wandering the halls at the same time as other students.
. But—isn’t it different now?”
,” said the Headmistress, face white with fury.
Bitterly, Draco ate his biscuit and started on his third cup of tea. She did this sometimes, as if she thought it would reignite some hidden desire to attend classes with students who ignored him at best and hated him with reason.
“I solemnly swear that I am up to no good,” he said, after casting a silencing charm around himself. The words left his lips buzzing.
“Then where…?” Potter began, but the bell startled them both away from each other.
“Then what are you
, the stealing of food from a meagre plate, the stinging finality of another person’s disbelief. Quieter violences.
Malfoy's eyes were very bright in the moonlight filtering through the window. He took the jumper, his fingers brushing against Harry's briefly. It felt like a burn, running up Harry's arm and into his face. It was an answer, but Harry was still figuring out the question. He just knew it was important, from the way Malfoy was looking at him.
Harry’s time is up the moment the words
Draco’s skin crawled at the word
"What are we saying, precisely?" Granger asked waspishly.
, he says, and it sounds like
to Potter, often, inexhaustibly.
“I could what?” Potter asked, voice rasping.
The morning after their sixth night of sneaking out of the castle, Dumbledore announced that the castle had nearly finished repairing the Slytherin common room, and that the Slytherins should expect to be back in their house tomorrow night.
He sounds so hopeful. All that guilt Harry has been avoiding rises up at once.
“Yes,” Draco agreed, anger snapping out of him. “I was. A Death Eater.”
“It’s not
Professor Applesnap leaned forward, her voice very low and acidic. “You don’t deserve to be. After everything you did, you don’t deserve—”
pass through his lips.
“You’re welcome,” Astoria answered with full sincerity, then laughed when Draco jabbed the edge of his quill into her side. As she swatted it away, she said, “Zeller is hosting a letter writing campaign in the common room later this week. Will you be coming to that?”
He lifts the glasses from Harry’s face instead, because he’s a fucking prick. “What are you telling them?”
Draco kept having to pause in his work on the corridor leading into the tower to answer questions—
Draco pulled his knees to his chest, crushing the book between his body. He still didn’t look at Potter. That panicked confusion was rising again.
Draco came to the shocking realization that Potter might be
Draco blinked at him, nonplussed. “Why don’t you ask him,” he thought he answered. His ears were roaring. He hadn’t talked to Greg since immediately before their trials, when Greg, thinner and angrier than he’d ever been, said,
, if he can just figure out the right combination of words to get there.
It was a generous characterization of that particular conversation. Mostly when they spoke, it was about safe, unhurt topics like Quidditch and classwork. Once—late, as ever, the two of them haunting the Owlery in their sleeplessness—they discussed the future, or at least Potter did, ceaseless and worrying, and since all Draco could imagine of his was the slow drip of his probation and the ever-present risk of Azkaban just beyond it, he’d finally snapped out that perhaps Potter had never had brains enough to just sit and think about his interests, if he had any.
Officer Abbott-Jones noted his lack of attendance in Draco’s file, and said,
Draco stayed in that crouch for long enough that his calves began to cramp. He shifted, sitting right on the stone floor in a manner that would have made his younger self cringe, until his arse went completely numb. When it began to veer into
Or perhaps it was just him. He was full of baseless assumptions, after all.
“I’m upset, too,” Harry continues, the statement a revelation on his tongue. He bites on the inside of his lip, to stop his face from crumpling.
She gave Draco a look that he couldn’t decipher, and Draco swallowed, clutching his bag tighter.
“I’m aware.” Draco watched Potter shake his head at something Weasley said and began walking, a touch quicker than the other two.
“I’m,” Draco started, but could not fathom an end to the sentence. He tried, “He’s,” but that, too, was mired with more than he knew how to explain. He wanted to explain about the cloak pin, and his letter, and his cloying certainty that he was going to fuck this up, too, the way he had everything else in his life.
“Nng,” said Draco, a vice taking slow hold of his lungs. He wasn’t carrying the wand he’d registered with SAD at the beginning of his probation. He was carrying
Dream knowledge: Harry isn’t allowed to get closer himself. He has to wait for them to get close first.
“Did I
“Who are you even writing them to?” Malfoy asks, crowded close and looking put out that Harry managed to
Draco, in the middle of casting a freshening charm on himself, stopped mid-motion. “I suppose,” he said slowly. He was still doing what he could to help Hogwarts’ magic get back to her natural state so that she could repair herself. The battle had raged over every inch of it, making worse the dark magic that was cast daily during his seventh year, in endless repetitions; and Draco was only a drop in its endless well. The columns in the west cloisters were still smashed on one side. The interior garden was still in ruins. If it was a conversation, Draco was not good at keeping it going forward.
Today, though, Draco had a tidbit to write about. The broken lines of Potter’s map—one that his father and his friends made while they were at Hogwarts, Potter explained as they sat together in that sun-drenched window seat, the Marauder’s map—had pulled endlessly at Draco’s brain in the days following Halloween.
Draco hesitated, abruptly unsure if he should continue his thought. Potter seemed so odd for a moment. But he was looking at Draco so fully now, green eyes intent, and Draco had always been a weak-willed person. “You could just visit them tonight. You can Apparate, can’t you?”
Harry thinks about it. “Yes,” he says, surprising himself. He’s sore, but that’s—he’s never minded that part. And he slept
A slow smile was spreading across Malfoy's face, which told Harry—too late—that he'd been staring.
"It's magic," Ron said bracingly as they followed a few steps behind them, so as to not make it so obvious that they didn't trust the Slytherins to be alone in their dormitory. "The castle can whip up a few new beds, right?"
Baddock said something about Greg being
Draco hadn’t gone. Obviously. He stayed late in the library, watching the Lumos charms run lower and lower, until five minutes before curfew, then spent the rest of the evening on the first floor, scrubbing curse magic from the portraits caught in the spellfire. The wall sconces had been so dim, barely producing any light, that even the flashes of Draco’s magic seemed to get eaten up by shadow.
Three chairs scraped backwards next to him. Draco nearly broke his quill. Heat was building in his face again, unbearably. He didn’t look up, though he knew the person that had scooted too close was Potter even before Potter’s tumble of black curls and his warm brown face, his shocking eyes, came into Draco’s sightline.
But Astoria was more headstrong than Daphne, who would undoubtedly have made a fuss if Draco had done the same thing. She reappeared at Draco’s side a moment later, her mouth a moue of vague disappointment. “You were the first Slytherin to sign the form.”
Harry couldn't help but glance up towards the Slytherin table, though, eyes finding Malfoy immediately. Malfoy, too, seemed to be looking for him. They stared at each other for a moment, before Malfoy turned determinedly away, his mouth almost a frown.
—asked after he'd finished brushing his teeth. He was looking exceptionally pale underneath his freckles.
“Hogwarts,” Draco said, barely noticing the derision in Creevey’s voice. The noise in his head was subsiding, but he didn’t feel any closer to understanding. He wondered if he ever would. He only had this single thought, this sole offering: “You haven’t asked Hogwarts if she would do it for you.”
the attention he was getting
A little thrill of fear shot down Draco’s spine at that. “Well,
, so Malfoy does it again and again and again until Harry is gasping nonsense into the air, hips and cock begging upwards, and then Malfoy pulls away to say,
Draco took two neat steps back, adrenaline hitting him at once and making his body shake. He took another step back, too big, and crashed into a person, which turned out to be Potter. He’d moved up so close behind Draco that when he turned, they were practically nose to nose.
“I am certain they think that,” Draco said blandly.
And no, Harry had agreed, thinking of Hermione’s frostiness towards Lavender and how even
Draco barked out an incredulous laugh, his body loosened by the sheer gall of Potter. Potter, who felt perfectly fucking entitled to interrogating Draco about—about things Draco didn’t care to elaborate on, but who couldn’t stand Draco’s own inquiries. Who kept—kept
Once, crouched by the garden behind greenhouse number 3, Malfoy spent nearly fifteen minutes talking about the plants growing there, even though they hadn’t covered them yet in Herbology. He’d flushed when he realized his ramblings, but Harry, enraptured by the sure sound of Malfoy’s voice, had only said, “I used to help out in my aunt's garden," and waited for Malfoy to keep talking.
much.
But then Potter would put his head down and reach for Draco—the bend of Draco’s knee, or the dry skin of the back of Draco’s hand, or the ladder of Draco’s ribs, Potter’s knuckles pressed against them as he fisted Draco’s jumper in his hand, keeping him in place—because he was stubborn, because he’d kept the letter, because he’d sent the cloak pin; and because Draco had written the letter, because he wore the cloak pin, because he was equally as stubborn as Potter, Draco reached back, fingers dragging across the short curls at the base of Potter’s neck, or his palm flat against the jut of Potter’s spine, or his forehead pressed to the swell of Potter’s shoulder, listening to the cadence of Potter’s voice, unhurried and unhurt, and think perhaps it was worth the trying. Draco would hold onto this thought as he fell slowly, gently into sleep; and it would greet him when he woke, neck cricked from sleeping on Potter’s shoulder, Potter himself having barely shifted, his breathing even and peaceful.
“Oh, there he is,” said Creevey, pulling chalk from the teacher’s desk and setting it against the blackboard to take notes as he spoke. Without pause, he continued, “Malfoy’s the one who came up with the idea Hermione and I were talking about.”
Zeller’s voice broke through quiet, causing both of them to jolt. “You should
It gnawed at Harry’s chest, a memory of something he’d never had but could almost reach. His inhale was shaky when he pulled his hand away and reached, instinctively, for Malfoy.
Potter, evidently employing Legilimency, said in a clumsy voice, “I haven’t been checking the map since we—fought.” Draco’s sneer fell off in surprise. “I realized it might be a bit, uh, hypocritical of me to check it after I got so—angry, about being—about thinking you might have been following me—” Potter’s eyes dashed briefly towards Weasley and Granger, and with a mute sort of despair, Draco realized Potter must have talked about it with them, that Potter might have been talking about Draco
“No,” Potter agreed. Sunlight was beginning to creep onto his thighs, leaving Draco in shadows; Draco watched the incremental progression of it with a twist of his mouth. “Can we get back inside now?”
“But we can still help,” Zeller said plaintively, her yellow barrettes sparkling from the Lumos bubble floating overhead. “It’s our school, too.”
She’d just been to interview Potter.
Draco shoved his elbow into Potter’s sternum at that last one, and Potter only laughed, stumbling closer instead of away. He rested his forehead on Draco’s shoulder, very briefly, and said, to Ginny, “Do you think it’s safe to do the repairs while the rest of us are inside?”
She sounded as Baddock had, expecting a fight to break out; and Draco looked away from Potter, feeling himself flush.
upset; he’s upset that nobody will take him seriously. He resents the quiet dismissal of his concerns. He hates how powerless he feels to do the one thing Malfoy’s asked of him.
Potter’s most recent letter said only
“Vince,” he said, and found that it hurt to say. He cleared his throat, tried again, “Vince. Hello. I didn’t know you were here.”
“Because,” Draco said, very slowly, “it was a requirement of my parole that I complete my N.E.W.T.s at Hogwarts. I didn’t have a choice.”
Draco didn’t bother responding; his hands were becoming increasingly sweaty the closer to the classroom they got. The thing was that Astoria was right; he could have gone. The same thing that stopped him from doing so at the beginning of the year was the same thing that made him pause three doors down from the specified classroom.
just trying to talk to him.”
Malfoy’s skin is cold, but his pulse hammers under Harry’s fingers. He looks resigned to having Harry’s hand there, at his neck; Harry thinks, with disquieting certainty, that he could hurt Malfoy. That Malfoy might not stop him.
, and Malfoy, in tones of deep offense, answers
Draco frowned. He found it specifically impossible to believe that Granger herself did not object to him being the one to provide that summary and said as much.
He wondered, abruptly, where Granger and Weasley were and whether they knew where
As October blew through the highlands, Draco also noticed that Potter’s eyes stopped roving when they landed upon Draco. This was difficult to ascertain at first, given that Draco so rarely ventured into the open spaces where other students might catch sight of him.
Harry, personally, hadn't read it since the summer before he started at Hogwarts, and even then had skipped all the boring bits about the school.
with the sort of cool, clear-headedness that he associates with withheld meals and the sound of his cupboard under the stairs locking.
“Oh,” she cooed, her eerie, unmistakable voice sounding from overhead. Draco looked up to find her perched, cross-legged, on the stall divider, her face scrunched up in sympathy—and not a little bit of glee. She was a horrid gossip. “Draco, what
“Salazar prohibit the exactitude of a schedule,” Malfoy scoffs. He sticks something into his book to mark his place, then packs his bag with sharp, agitated movements. “Surely an estimate of the length of your lessons would not be remiss. What sort of a professor, even a former one, isn’t able to judge the length of a lesson? Honestly, you’d think—”
“It hurt. It—I know it doesn’t matter,” Malfoy adds, with a blazing sort of defensiveness, “But it did. I didn’t think something spoke about with such honor—” The word spits itself out of his mouth, the admission Harry has been waiting for. “—would be so painful. And after, he—”
“Oh,” Potter said, frowning. His glasses were askew from the way he was sitting, but he didn’t move to fix them. Draco’s fingers twitched.
In any case, he could help the castle, so he did; Draco filled up a full page to describe the damage, and another to detail the repairs that he had completed. He felt brighter, almost, by the time he was drying the ink and slipping into his emerald-lined robes.
Greg snorted in obvious disbelief, hunching deeper into his comforter. Draco hadn’t even realized that he’d relaxed until he was all scrunched up again, scowling slightly in that manner that always made people afraid of him. “’S’not true,” he said.
to spill over.
“Malfoy,” he answers coolly, as people disappear further down the train and into the remaining compartments, the first warning whistle at their heels.
This was how Draco felt about the Potter situation. He was certain something was going to break, and when it did, Draco would drown in the influx, suffocate under the weight. This letter, simple and straightforward, felt like the last flicker of unbreakable charms buckling under gravity.
The thing is, magic was
She had been very enthused with the dark magic cleansing and the restoration magics, but Draco was remembering the rumor that Granger had cracked in Divination in third year. She was already disinclined to believe that magic of this type would be this simple, and Draco, though it had been his idea, found himself at a loss for how to explain it. He simply listened to the magic and did as it bid.
She smiled when she saw where he was looking. “We’re not allowed to have house specific memorabilia unless we’re a Head of House,” she explained. “It’s rather nice to have the reminder up again.”
“Not this again, Harry!” Her voice is despairing, stealing the rest of Harry’s words from his mouth. Except he has proof, this time. He
"Oh, Harry," she said. "That's amazing! It takes an incredible amount of magic for those to appear."
—and Draco realized he could not stand Potter.
Conversation with Potter sometimes felt as if it occupied a thin beam that Draco was constantly at risk of toppling from. There were too many things that could undo the careful balance Draco struck, and he was hyper aware when that beam seemed to sway.
Potter did not think of it as a day of memorial, or of celebration, at least before the Dark Lord rose again; and he certainly did not think about how it might mean even more, now, after the infant son bested death twice.
Potter’s voice was idle, his steps easy as he headed towards Draco, ignoring the cheer that went up near Queensbury’s game. “This was fun, actually. I didn’t know you liked gobstones.”
A detached sense of wonder came over Draco. Watching Potter speak was fascinating in the way mid-air collisions were.
“There were people in the dungeons when I got home for the summer. Muggles, mostly. Some—muggleborns. Aunt Bellatrix fetched me in the middle of the night. Midnight. New moon. Ritualistic rot. I already knew what was going to happen, obviously.”
“Magic,” Potter said. His eyes were still closed. The sun was bidding them a slow goodbye, the suspended Lumos brighter and warmer in its absence.
“I—have you been?” Draco asked. A nervous flush was rising into his neck.
He was comforted by the fact that they looked just as miserable as Harry felt.
Even from the alleyway to its side, Madam Puddifoot's cafe manages to exude a nauseous, cramped frilliness. Harry would rather not step inside until he absolutely has to, as even this proximity has him remembering confetti in his tea and ill-advised dates with girls he doesn’t think he properly fancied after all.
A cheer went up from the other side of the hall, where Bastien Queensbury was clearly on the verge of winning a contentious match. Zeller and Shardlow hurried over, breathless with excitement, while Draco pinched the bridge of his nose and went towards the benches in the opposite direction.
(See the end of the chapter for
The following Monday, Draco met with Madam Pomfrey. He had a bit over 200 hours of community service bundled with his probationary sentence, and Office Abbott-Jones had encouraged him to find a way to make those hours while still at school.
Greg frowned; it was an expression that always took up the entirety of his face. “No?”
“Nothing,” she said quickly. She used to be a better liar. Probably he used to be, too, and the skill died with the Dark Lord. “I simply wanted to see you.”
It is familiar, though, this cold clear thing that sometimes settles in Harry’s chest and refuses to thaw. Having Hermione on one side and Ron on the other will lessen its grip; Quidditch practice will do it, too. Gentle warmths, easing away some of the chill.
There’s always a struggle, and there’s always a victor. That’s what they’ve always been barrelling towards, this ever-present dichotomous swing: kiss or kill, fuck or fight, start a war or end one. The stakes always feel that high, where Draco Malfoy is involved.
Ron coughs. His face is a splotchy red. “Does this mean we’re at least over your Malfoy’s-a-Death-Eater theory?”
When Headmistress McGonagall was done doling out detentions like sweets, the sky was pink and orange with burgeoning sunrise. She stood with her hands on her hips, having listened with grave attention to the earnest, often overlapping explanations of Creevey, Granger, and Astoria. She was silent for a long time, but hadn’t yet dismissed them, so they all waited restlessly.

, Harry doesn’t say, because he
. Draco wanted to chuck it into the fire. Not because of its brevity—Potter’s messages had been uniformly short, a line or two of interest—but because it made Draco want to sink into the cushions and press it to his face. His chest hurt. It
He gave each of them a silver chain, thick and heavy, when he went back for seventh year, because Greyback lived in the Manor; and they’d cried, and he hadn’t known how to help them, and at the end of it all, he still hadn’t figured out how to help them. The Aurors had taken them away, too, and sometimes Draco couldn’t sleep for wondering where they were, or who ended up housing them.
“Will you be going to the meeting?” she asked politely, cutting him off when he tried to sidestep her.
It feels like it should mean something, is all. It sits there, a waiting confession.
. It helps to point to something tangible and name the fear of it when people don’t—don’t understand.”
Harry sits up and says, before he can lose his nerve, “I need to talk to you about something.”
“Oh, next week will be fine,” Astoria said happily, sunny. “Creevey just has to submit it a day before.”
“What do you mean,” Potter began, warily, which meant it fell upon Draco to explain it all. By the time he was done, the wall sconce to their side had dimmed—curfew in fifteen—and Potter’s face had closed off completely, an unsettling blankness that Draco had never seen before.
Draco’s throat went dry. He fastened the cloak closed and took a step back, his heartbeat thunderous in his ears. “Yes,” he managed, though he no longer remembered the question. He curled his hands into fists and tucked them against the small of his back, sure that if he didn’t, he would do something unforgivable like reach out to rest his fingers against the curve of Potter’s Adam’s apple just to feel that movement again. Alarm rose at the thought, rose and rose, as the air between them remained heavy and loaded and quiet.
Part of his morning ablutions included this reminder, amongst others. The list of affirmations he went through changed daily, but involved at least one reminder that he was Death Eater scum—or whatever headline he remembered from the days leading up to his trial, which were many—before dovetailing into exaltations on the nature of his many character deficits (
It occurred to Draco that Astoria was sixteen now. He felt abruptly ancient.
“—not as if they weren’t
Draco wasn’t the only one to notice; Baddock, closest to the wall, let out a startled yelp as the rubble he’d levitated outside was pulled back towards the jagged edges of stone and stacked themselves painstakingly against each other. It quickly turned into a cheer that was echoed by everyone else.
“Oh,” said Greg, his face lit warmly by the fire. He’d tugged his comforter off the bed; it was wrapped around his shoulders, his bare feet sunk into the dark rug he was sitting on. He was so thin, and so sad, and sitting too close to the fire, a jolt of panic jumping sharply into Draco’s bloodstream at the sight. Instinctive.
She scrunched her nose. “I thought you didn’t go to class anymore. You
And still Draco’s heart thumped in his throat, nerves an unending Tarantallegra, hands untrustworthy.
“Nothing,” Potter said, suddenly furious. That, too, was familiar. “Wouldn’t you want them to come?”
Magic was real, and it was
Draco opened his mouth to say that no, he did not, and never had, and who did Potter think Draco was—
“Ginny said it’s safe now. Come on,” Potter said, taking a groggy Draco by the hand and leading him back into the tower. As they walked closer, magic flickered along the pointed top of the tower, sliding across the walls.
“You can’t change it.” Malfoy’s voice is clinical, like he’s run diagnostics and is just informing Harry of the results. It’s at odds with the tension wound through Malfoy, a thrum that Harry can feel alongside his own rage and incomprehension.
Malfoy hums noncommittally. “The perils of looking precisely like disfavored family members, I suppose.”
different from us. You believed it all, too.”
“You ran through the snow like a troll in an antiques shop. It wasn’t difficult,” Malfoy answers. “May I sit?”
Harry knows this, even if Malfoy might not, because Harry’s body is well-acquainted with not fitting within his skin and his hands are familiar with becoming clumsy. Malfoy does not have clumsy hands. Malfoy’s hands are beautiful, long and sure and strong, painting pictures in the air and across the expanse of Harry’s body like the universe itself wanted for a masterpiece and found it in the angle of his wrists and the crook of his fingers.
So he said nothing, and kept Malfoy’s hand firmly in his.
"It's going to be cold again," Malfoy complained after a moment. Harry looked at him; he was still in bed, still frowning hard.
doing the same to Muggleborns when they captured us, following the Ministry’s orders and—”
, it isn’t,” Greg countered, voice rising.
Potter closed his eyes, backlight and impossible. “I miss that.”

Draco had never experienced a Christmas break quite as bizarre as this one. His nightmares, which had abated slightly, returned vengefully while he was holed in his tiny, alien bedroom in his mother’s flat. He found himself stuck in loops of his misdeeds after waking dry-mouthed and fearful, clawing at the phantom pain flaring from his faded Mark. Sometimes he walked into the kitchen and found the strangely tiled floor superimposed with images of blood, found himself thinking of Vince, and of fire, and of the view of the ground from the Owlery, from the Astronomy Tower.
A hush fell at his entry nevertheless. The abrupt quiet made Draco’s skin prickle as he stalked to a table at the back, whispers starting up in his wake. He focused entirely on getting out his materials, chest drowned with something like misery and something like anger. He flicked his eyes upwards, to see what Professor Flitwick had on the board, and was caught immediately by the sight of his housemates, sitting in two neat rows, clumped by year.
“I don’t think it should be that easy,” Draco confessed. His heart was a mess.
and just—wonder.
The laughter slid off Potter's face. Draco's chest hitched, a faint echo of the panic he'd felt months ago, when he'd been with Greg and Vince, prowling the corridors with the Dark Lord's edicts in his ears. They'd seen Granger, Potter, and Weasley disappear around the seventh floor corridor, and been confronted with the empty stone wall that haunted Draco's dreams even after he'd fled with Snape. And Draco—Draco, who still retched after one of Nagini's feedings; Draco, whose Crucios were still weak; Draco, who carried extra water to the prisoners; Draco, who could have killed but didn't, would never be able to—thought only, desperately, that he only needed to be sure that Potter wasn't dead.
“I want,” Harry repeats through clenched teeth, his whole body shaking, “to hold your hand, Malfoy. You berk. You—you
Potter’s mouth twitched. He seemed calmer, almost. “You don’t care, do you?”
. Coming out from the Forbidden Forest, of all places, and striding across the grounds.
“Of course,” Draco said, faintly, and then couldn’t retain anything else. She asked questions, and he answered, and the buzzing in his chest grew into his limbs, his ears, the roof of his mouth.
The second problem: Draco Malfoy is a Death Eater, and he has to kill Dumbledore.
is not on either of those lists.
Professor Sprout came down from the High Table during this speech, though Draco couldn’t say at what point; only that in short order, their gazes had broken, and the Hufflepuff was being led quietly, miserably out of the hall, and then the Headmistress stood and settled herself behind the podium to make a speech that Draco couldn’t hear over the roar of his heart in his ears. His whole body was so upright and rigid that it ached, his jaw so tight he could feel a headache building in response.
Draco ran a frustrated hand through his hair, tangled from sweat-soaked sleep and entirely too fucking long. He wanted to shake Greg. “Yes, it
But it was brightest around him and Malfoy, turning the quidditch pitch gold as the wisps coalesced into orb-like shapes, floating around them. There were other colors, too, lavender and green and blue and silver, but the gold was the brightest, a near blinding yellow at its center.
Draco hadn’t considered the possibility of being
Narcissa passed a hand through his hair, peering carefully at his face in the dim light. Draco stilled, feeling his hair settle at his nape. She said, slow and thoughtful, “I see.”
“That’s not bad,” Potter said, sounding truly upset. The blurry, sleepless expression was being replaced with a fire that Draco had once made it his mission to inspire in Potter. “I always—”
It was that card that Draco was remembering now, the postscript that had so infuriated him:
the tosser,” Draco said, stepping into Potter’s space and managing to grab the edge of the pocket again, bodies knocking briefly. “A normal person would just ask after another’s plans for the weekend.”
Potter’s shoulders stiffened. He said, without even turning, “Malfoy.”
He cast a freshening charm as he did so and, as she had since she first happened upon Draco after one of his cries in sixth year, Myrtle floated over to assess him, narrow-eyed. Her expression melted into something coy as Draco redid his tie.
Harry wonders if he has nightmares. It’s another thing they probably have in common that they don’t talk about.
Draco had to work very hard to keep his expression level, suppressing the snort that wanted to rise at her blatant lie.
His days were cracked open with time as a result. Draco feared this would leave him as Azkaban did, listless and wan and prone to remembering the horrors of the Manor with every slow blink of his eyes. But with access to the library, and the grounds, and the empty classrooms and alcoves and corridors throughout the castle, Draco instead found himself ravenous for movement and knowledge and actions, as if rediscovering hungers he’d forgotten existed.
Potter became very interested in refilling his ink pot. Beneath the fall of his curls, his ears were turning a brilliant crimson. “
Draco inhaled sharply in surprise; his chest, which had constricted without his noticing, struggled to contain the sudden rush of air. “I—yes.”
Draco folded his hands in his lap and said nothing. The Headmistress peered at him closely, then said, “I approved Professor Sinistra’s sessions.”
A paper crane floated over to him a few minutes later. Harry snatched it out of the air before Ron or Hermione could notice, unfolding it to find the words, in tiny, slanting scrawl,
. The words were unfamiliar. Draco wrapped his arms around his knees as the fire finally gave way to embers.
Headmistress McGonagall’s face was troubled. “Mr. Malfoy,” she began, in a kinder tone than Draco had ever heard her use.
with the next flick of his wand. Instead, the names circled each other dizzyingly, until they came to a neat stop in the air, a Gryffindor name next to a Slytherin name.
But then Harry pictures what Ron’s face would look like if any variation of the words
He said, again, “Can we get back inside now?”
He faltered as Potter turned his head, blinking a little more rapidly. He was properly looking at Draco, though he wore the befuddled look of someone yanked right out of a slumber and adjusting to the waking world.
He pulled the scroll towards him with a sniff, said, “I don’t suppose there’s a deadline for this, then?”
Malfoy’s eyes fell to the jumper, his mouth smoothing out of his frown and into something softer, surprised. His cheeks were a faint pink. Harry couldn’t stop staring at him.
“Harry!” called the unmistakable tone of Granger, on the heels of Weasley’s, “Mate, the Great Hall’s the other way.”
The moment was ruined rather spectacularly when Malfoy shook out the jumper, saw the large H emblazoned on the front, and promptly smothered a laugh into the crook of his elbow.
There’s something in the catch of his voice that doesn’t square with the Malfoy that Harry knows. Something self-loathing and anxious, his long fingers unnervingly still despite their bloodless grip on his trousers.

And of course Draco hadn’t submitted the assignment, lost points to boot, and skipped the detention besides, because there was a cabinet that determined whether his family lived or died and its repair was as equal a noose as its disrepair.
There are easy violences. A fist to the sternum, a broken nose, knuckles scraped along cheekbones and jaws. Simple violences.
There’s a blot of ink right at the beginning of the sentence. It feels like a truth, to leave it there.
into a funeral march.
It was quiet except for a few hoots from the owls behind them and birdsong from the forest ahead of them. If Draco closed his eyes, he could almost hear Madame Hooch, stood at the pitch just visible ahead of them, instructing the first years on proper broom-riding technique.
The scent of snow is on the air, when Harry leans half out of the window with Hedwig on his arm and Malfoy’s arms tight around his waist.
A detached, untouchable calm punched through the rising dread. It was a crystalline calm, the sort that enabled Draco to spend evenings melting silverware into heavy links to keep Greyback from the children in the Manor and set bonfires for bodies. A moment where his brain fizzled right through anxiety and into analytics, cold assessment of the situation in front of him, even though his heart was rattling his bones with its frenzied pace.
“Malfoy,” Astoria said lowly, though her expression didn’t falter.
Malfoy made a noise that could almost be a snort before climbing into his side—his side! Of
under heel and his own worth inflated and revered, and had never spared a thought for the course of flight that would lead to this. This was his first transgression: the eagerness with which he’d extended his left arm and
"We should start asking, I think," Lovegood said from where she had been carefully tending to the underside of the spiral staircase. "She's listening, isn't she?"
“Yes,” said Narcissa. Her eyes were blue and unwavering. “He said Draco was alive.”
“Okay,” Harry says instead. Outside the windows set high in the wall, October continues its quiet march towards November.
Draco’s fingers spasmed. “Hate you.”
This, too, Draco had to add to his list of affirmations—cruel, which he’d always been and would always be, and unkind, for this intrinsic need to come up with cruelties to attribute to others—but by the evening he’d forgotten almost all of them, exhaustion from his rare snatches of sleep leaving his head too heavy to hold a single thought and Potter at his side, saying something inane like, “I need to check these out.”
, as if it was a word with any meaning, as if he hadn’t learned to say it entirely too late.
and Ron might not even hear it. Maybe.
The fist to the face doesn’t surprise either of them, not really. The knee to the gut, the elbow between ribs; the blinds shake where Malfoy’s back hits the door and the seat cushion leaves a welt along Harry’s arm when he falls. Harry’s body burns every place Malfoy touches.
It didn’t take very much time for them to coax the last few students out of the tower, half of them on shield-charm duty and the rest recasting warming charms over each other and the food. Draco kept quiet and close, watching Potter the whole while.
Draco nodded, beginning to get anxious. It was different when he'd been working on his own. Now, the hum of Hogwarts’ magic was scattered around several dozen students in various places, interrupted by the students’ magic still permeating the air.
, nearly on top of each other and not a drop of blood between them. About the simple intensity of Potter’s gaze, and the easy betrayal of Draco’s hands. The red underlying Potter’s dark cheeks. Somewhere in Godric’s Hollow, Harry Potter was wearing Draco Malfoy’s robes. It all felt quietly wrong and wholly taboo, and Draco selfishly wanted to pry meaning from it.
“I don’t know how to not fight with you,” Potter said finally, firmly; he was quoting Draco’s letter back at him, but it sounded different in Potter’s sure voice, less desperate and defensive than it felt when Draco was scrawling it out against a wall of the Owlery, “but we were doing okay before I fucked it up, so I’m willing to learn if you are.”
“Contest them!” Professor Applesnap reared back as if Baddock had drawn his wand. “A team comprised of criminals shouldn’t even be competing!”
“And that would have worked, would it?” Potter twisted to the side, shoving an elbow into Draco’s sternum. But Draco had suffered worse, by Potter even, and was unmoved, his hand slipping out of Potter’s grip to dart into the pocket.

Ten minutes later found them in the Entrance Hall, Potter saying, “You don’t think it’s mad, do you,” to which Draco replied, “Of course it’s mad, but that’s hardly ever stopped you before.” He had half of Potter’s books still in his hands and was irritated beyond all belief about it, had half a mind to just chuck them all to the floor, except Potter was—and there was no denying this—Potter was

Learned knowledge: if he tries to get close, they’ll dunk his head under the water and hold him there.
Baddock had been on the run for the past year with his muggle family members. Draco didn’t know why the thought came to him. He’d known this. Baddock had been on the run for the past year with his muggle family members. Baddock had been on the run for the past year because of his muggle family members. Baddock had been on the run for the past year because he was from a muggle family. Baddock had been on the run for the past year because he was in danger because he came from a non-magical family. Baddock was in danger for the past year because he came from a non-magical family. Baddock’s family was in danger for the past year because they were non-magical, but Baddock
Draco’s whole body broke out into a terrified sweat, his stomach vigorously attempting to eat itself. He was breaking the terms of his probation. With a clarity he hadn’t retained at the time, he recalled Officer Abbott-Jones’ voice reciting the terms of his probation during that visit before he was released to Hogwarts, and, more importantly, the ramifications if he failed to abide by those terms: a return to Azkaban.
A consensus was hardly likely, and after a few moments, Draco sat back and wondered, quietly, at the table of students in front of him, passionate and well-versed and unafraid despite all the very good reason to be so.
Officer Abbott-Jones’ smile slid off her face. “Okay, okay,” she said, in a placating manner that was only half-joking. She opened the door and cocked her hip to one side. “You took longer to admit you hated me than most parolees.”

Harry jerks back, his face flushing.
quitting,” Zeller said, firmly. “Tell him, Professor.”
Unfortunately, by the time dinner came to a close, it was made readily apparent that the Slytherin dormitory had not miraculously repaired itself days before schedule. It was with Professor McGonagall's stern gaze at their backs that the Gryffindors returned to the common room with the Slytherins at their heels.

Draco came to an abrupt stop. He stared.

, Draco thought, but could not move for several trembling moments. The sun beat against his face. The wind caught the tatters of his robes. Exhaustion gnawed at his limbs, the soles of his feet, the stretch of his lungs.
“Why didn’t you heal it?” he asks, as the paste forces Malfoy's skin to bloom purple then fade, in increments, to blue-green-yellow-pink. Malfoy’s gotten paler, and thinner, but Harry’s eyes still can’t help but linger along the panes of his face.
“Because—” Draco bit back his instinctive desire to say
and a crude dark mark over the entire signature page, hiding the few signatures from sight. The petition had clearly been charmed to reflect updates across the houses, because Draco could make out non-Slytherin names beneath the damage. It took him five seconds to make a copy of the defaced page, to give to the Headmistress as proof, and two minutes to vanish the charmed ink, but ten more to charm the parchment against anything that wasn’t someone’s name.
They sat in the Hufflepuff stands, because it was the closest. The wooden beams creaked tiredly as they walked up and up to the very top of the stands. The moon was still out, as were all her stars, and the castle seemed ethereal and unhurt across the hills. The Forbidden Forest was very close, and the sky was very far, and Potter kept hold of one of Draco’s hands, hard and unyielding, the whole way up, as if they were still caught in a fire, desperate to escape.
, he thought nonsensically. He’d forgotten the last time he did one of those necessary affirmations, that recitation that settled misery heavy over his shoulders. He’d forgotten. He forgot. Potter had made him forget.
Malfoy didn’t have much faith in Dumbledore’s ability to be helpful—it’s part of his adamant refusal to go with Harry to speak with Dumbledore in the first place—but there’s a difference between saying that and actually being faced with the stone wall of indifference.

At the front of the classroom, chalk squeaking underneath his words, Creevey said, “So we’re gonna see if Hogwarts will let us undo the wards.”

when or how Sirius learned to detangle himself from the teachings of his family. He just knows that it ended with Sirius hating them. Saying he hated them.
With a sniff, Draco added, “Zeller is already causing a minor riot by breaking the line. You lot may well cause a full one.”
The ensuing captures were the only reason Draco was not still rotting in a cell alongside MacNair, and his father, and the Carrows until he died, or the important bits of him did. The world may have ruptured, but the Ministry and the Wizengamot had always operated upon favors and politics: a cache of easy captures, of rescues attributed to the Auror Corps, and the veneer of competence in the chaos following the fall of the Dark Lord, exchanged for mercy for Draco, only Draco. Lucius had seen to it, the way he had always seen to everything, though it left a sour taste in Draco’s mouth to recognize this. Draco had been granted a light sentence for ensuring friends and family of his classmates remained in Azkaban or Ministry holding cells, and he was ashamed of feeling ashamed for it.
But Draco pushed aside this concern, focusing instead on Potter. He raised an eyebrow. “Weren’t
—said unconvincingly. "They wouldn't hex us with everyone present, right?"
The kept their conversation light and inconsequential like their interactions never were, and Harry was certain they were both ignoring the weight of all those things Not Worth Talking About pressing down on them.
Madam Pomfrey gave him a very critical look, as if she knew he was inventing the excuse on the spot. After a moment, she gestured to a pair of boxes left near the floo, a familiar logo of Magical Medical Equipment stamped on each side. “It’s for the best, I suppose. We’ve inventory today.”
“You were a Slytherin?” Draco asked, feeling immediately foolish and ignorant. From her accent, he assumed that she went to Uagadou, or perhaps one of the numerous, renowned local schools scattered across Middle and Western Africa. His ears flamed. “Sorry.”
“He killed You-Know-Who.”
Harry doesn’t know how to do comfort. His mouth is almost as discomfited as his body, which simultaneously wants to pull Malfoy closer and also keep him far, far away. He thinks both options would be a mistake, so instead he says, the words falling flat, “I’ll think of something else.”
“What—?” Harry started, breath still caught in his throat.
He delved into the dustiest, unused parts of the library—abandoned sections for classes no longer taught and back-issues of the Prophet so old the preservation charms had faded—and gingerly sought out the grassy hills and sandy edges of the lake, surprised still by the sky overhead, and spent a long afternoon at his desk in the dormitories, staring into the swell of dark water on the other side of the cold glass and failing to write to his mother.
a Death—”
“Merlin,” he breathes, as the pair disappears inside, “She must get into all sorts of uncomfortable arguments because of it.”
Malfoy is quiet while Harry ties the letter to Hedwig’s leg, wincing slightly when she insists on stepping onto his arm—her talons are sharp enough to feel through his layers—rather than taking flight directly from the perch.
Harry stays with his back pressed against the snow for so long that he has to recast the warming charm twice, the stars and moon and clouds distant, blurry points of white overhead. The air stings his throat and lungs, but he revels in every distracting inhale.
Here is a list that Harry doesn’t like to think about: getting drunk at a pub. A birthday after the war. Finishing school. Buying a house, the kind that has enough guest rooms for all of his friends to stay if they needed to. Learning to drive a car. Learning to drive a motorbike. Getting out of Britain. Gardening, for fun. Cooking, for fun. Seeing his parent’s grave. Having a family. Figuring out what to do with his hands and their wants.
, he thought, bittersweet, because others hadn’t. Draco wasn’t sure he had.
As one, they turned to the end of the hall, where the Headmistress was framed in the corridor that led into the tower. The silence grew abruptly guilty. Draco, for his part, was rapidly running through his probationary prohibitions and wondering just how many he might be breaking at the moment and whether he would be able to lie about any of them.
But then, this year has been full of surprises.
Draco readied himself for a reprimand, or a comment about the memory that he left. Instead, Baddock asked, “Have you spoken with Goyle?”
Draco pressed his face into his hands and let out a muffled string of curses before turning sharply and heading up the staircase.
Draco did know that. The Greengrasses may not have been involved with the war, but they still expected both Daphne and Astoria to make “proper” associations that would one day lead to “proper” marriages. Baddock spent the war on the run with the Muggle side of his family.
Draco blinked at her. “Fuck,” he said. Her words only served to make him feel worse. “I can find someone else to take my spot.”
Malfoy's mouth dropped open. "You have an
“Don’t fucking call me that.” An angry flush is starting under Harry’s collar, creeping into his throat. “Don’t
Astoria, in a move that was somehow both aggressively forward and clearly familiar, reached across the table to squeeze Baddock’s arm lightly. And Draco found that the events of the evening before were perched tentatively on his tongue at the sight: the wand, and the interview, and the hollow of time in the Hospital Wing. He was struck by the thought that they would listen. It seemed so obvious, in retrospect, that he had people who might listen. That he did not have to tell them everything, as he had done with Madam Pomfrey. That he could
“We will have it checked,” snapped Professor Applesnap, the opposing team’s advisor. Her face was pinched into dislike as she argued with Baddock. “To bother with cheating—”
Harry didn't want that. He wasn't sure what he wanted, except for Malfoy to take the bloody jumper and sneak out of the castle with him again.
It was funny, was the thought Draco usually had after these meetings. Sometimes, right after he exited the Headmistress’ office, he would head up to the Astronomy tower. Remembering that final conversation with Headmaster Dumbledore helped to clear his head, and being at the exact same spot that it occurred allowed it to echo more vividly than anything else in his life. He could recall with painful clarity that he had been very clever, despite it all, and very stupid, obviously, and very useless, inevitably.
It took Draco two tries to get the next words out. “Are you leaving?”
. Unfortunately, that was the only thing he could think to say for several long seconds. It wasn’t fair of him, so he said nothing.
. And his parole officer—Officer Abbott-Jones, her fringe overlong and a ponytail flipped over one shoulder—had just looked at him for a long, hard moment.
Potter, however, stopped and nodded, opening his mouth and then shutting it just as quickly. He was staring very hard at Draco; Draco could still feel the dry warmth of Potter’s palm against his own and curled his hand into a loose fist in an attempt to push the memory away. He had a thought, indistinct, that they had unknowingly placed themselves on a precipice, and that whatever Potter did next would cement their slide into indifference or—whatever it was that existed on the other side of that.
Thinking about it made his whole body vibrate with a deep, incomprehensible pain. Draco pressed his hand into Vince’ stone, wondering whose decision it had been, to include him in this memorial, and whether they would ever know how desperately thankful Draco was to see it there, impossible to ignore: proof, that Vince had been here, even if no one else was mourning him.
This new worry bloomed a potent anxiety that obscured the words he’d half-prepared as he walked up here in the first place. He forgot what he’d meant to say, forgot anything other than Potter’s name, which slipped awkwardly out of his mouth: “Potter.”
“Well, but
This is the other option they claw out of what’s available to two boys nobody wants to believe are already soldiers: a war cannot be won without its soldiers, so get rid of the soldiers and the stronghold. A vanishing cabinet is an easy loophole through unknowing wards, once fixed; a pensieve can store the layout of a manor overrun with Death Eaters, and the location of every prisoner besides; the only thing they need are forces, and a Slytherin aunt with an auror daughter involved in the secretive Order of the Phoenix could solve that problem neatly.
“I have it on very good authority that it was mostly accidental,” Draco told him gravely.
Malfoy understands. Malfoy doesn’t trust adults either, or at least not anymore. Not after the adults in his life led him to the service of a madman by the force of their own adamant adherence to their prejudices.
Draco eyed the books. “And these will help?”
“I fucking hate you,” Malfoy whispers, with feeling.
“Are we done here then?” Draco asked, his voice colder than he ever allowed it to be since the war.
Potter watched Draco falter. Then he nodded once, as if to himself.
Potter gave him a funny look. “Uh, yes?”
"Right," Malfoy said decisively, "I'll take this side."
Baddock trailed off, pale skin coloring with embarrassment. Draco couldn’t blame him; Draco didn’t want to be associated with the Gobstones Team, but he at least had the appearance of piety to hide behind. Baddock actually liked the game, and was captain of the team, since all the sixth and seventh years had abandoned the club or refused to come back to Hogwarts. The remaining members seemed averse to associating with a club that had a Slytherin at the head, nevermind that Baddock had spent the previous, lost year on the run with the Muggle side of his family.
He found Granger on the first floor, at a long table set against the wall so that one could stare at either the stone wall or, if the seats were open, the panelled windows that looked over the greenhouses. His bag hit the seat next to her, in front of the window, with a dramatic bang.
Harry, needing to offset the feeling that was threatening to unbalance him, said, “Old magic that only shows up when two blokes lay in the middle of the quidditch pitch at night?”
“I’m surprised they even let any of you come back here,” Professor Applesnap was saying, her gaze finally moving past Baddock and landing on Zeller and her yellow clips and neat grey-and-yellow sweater with the Hufflepuff emblem on its chest. “Doesn’t it worry you, having them here?”
He stood quickly, his whole body sore and protesting, and spoke over whatever she wanted to say. “I’ll be heading to my dorm. Thank you.”
“I only found it today,” Draco admitted, speaking mostly to the ground.
The points shouldn’t affect his probation, but the detention might. It was terrifying that it wasn’t up to him to decide, and even the Headmistress’ assurances that she would write to Officer Abbott-Jones hadn’t abated that terror. Draco suspected that it was something that would plague him even after his probation finished, that it was something he was always going to live with.
Potter smiled, but it looked uncertain. “No,” he said. “I imagine it won’t be.”
, and Draco tugged the woven throw at the back of the couch over his body, as if hiding would help.
, but he hates those titles and Malfoy knows that, doesn’t he? Malfoy always knows the things that Harry hates, and what Harry hates with a special sort of fury is when Malfoy takes his name away from him, when he’s reduced from

“I thought perhaps the train was late,” she said, and stood from the table that held a grocer’s bag, yet unpacked.
Draco was no longer attending classes, but he
For all his bravado, though, there’s a slight tremor working through him that Harry can feel through their joined hands. He shifts closer, feeling an unwarranted shyness, before giving up pretense entirely and nudging Malfoy’s legs apart to seat himself in the space between his long legs. Harry’s knees fall on either side of Malfoy’s torso, Malfoy’s hand still in his grip.
“What?” Draco abruptly felt about twelve steps behind the conversation. “No, I—what?”
And underfoot, in the twist of the air, they could feel Hogwarts reaching for them. Draco, who already knew what this felt like, did not react outwardly, but there were startled shouts as others experienced it for the first time.
“Are you coming to classes again?” Potter asked. He wasn’t even whispering, though to be fair, it was unlikely that anyone heard him given the immediate outbreak of noise that accompanied him sitting at Draco’s side.
“I meant to give it back to you sooner,” Potter was saying, like he’d been preparing the words for a long while and was determined to get them out, nevermind whatever else Draco had to say. “During the trials, I wanted to, but then I—and then you were—and I had my trial, too—” Draco had already been in Azkaban at that point, but he’d heard about it, the bizarre combination of fear and celebration that pervaded what amounted to a formality recognizing that murder and Unforgiveables were acceptable if you were the victor. “—and after, I wasn’t really, I mean I couldn’t really—and then you weren’t anywhere, when we got back to school, so I’m only able to do it now.”
, and Draco was fascinated despite himself.
? All the beds in the dormitories are warded against transfiguration and other modifying magics."
Potter looked at him for another moment. “
“Right,” Potter said, as Draco shoved his supplies blindly into his bag, face hot and unbearable. “That’d be—I mean, it’s—could be, nice—”
“It’s not,” Malfoy says barely a heartbeat later. Harry doesn’t quite register that the words are meant for him until he feels the invisible hand on his wrist, stilling its course to where his wand is sheathed. “That’s—mother always said Aunt Andromeda and Aunt Bellatrix looked the most alike.”
“Alright, let’s go,” said Officer Abbott-Jones, his file in her hand and Officer Evergreen nowhere to be seen. Draco couldn’t even find it in himself to mind the brisk, careless tone she was using. He simply stood, following her blindly through the hallway and down another hall.
Draco exhaled, face tightening. He was being made fun of. Obviously. He’d spent his childhood being told that his emotions were transparent, and it felt impossible that no one had picked up on ones as irrepressible as this.
As if summoned by his words, Hogwarts’ magic shimmered into sight, like ethereal dust motes in the moonlight, and slammed outwards. They all flinced, Draco instinctively bringing an arm up to cover his face, his shoulder hitting the wall hard. The force of its light, bright and blue, seared the backs of his eyelids; students shouted in surprise and not a little fear. Magic coiled thickly in the air, the stones at Draco’s side vibrating with the pressure of it. Draco could
“I heard about the pensieve,” Professor Sinistra began. Draco sloshed half his cup into his lap. Oh, but he was in trouble. “Explain your reasoning.”
Harry mechanically got in next to Malfoy. The room slowly filled with snores and deep breathing, but Harry stayed staring hard at the ceiling, unable to sleep. Maybe he never would again. It seemed safer, what with the Harry-inclined murderers on the loose and Malfoy in his bed.
“No,” Potter said, though he didn’t meet Draco’s eyes for the rest of the evening. That, too, was another strange thing: Potter never upped and left, as Draco might have expected him to, but instead idled in their shared space. Doubling back in corridors to greet him; scooting over, wordless, to carve a space on the stone ledge for Draco to join him; fingers trailing over book spines, while Draco studied at a table wedged under a window with a faulty lock, the library stacks on either side of them, cocooning them from the rest of the school.
The Battle was always frightfully easy to recall, and so this memory was summoned effortlessly as well. Vince and Greg on either side of him, following him because he’d said he could find Potter. He could always find Potter.
Potter’s breath left him in a short, sharp punch. “I didn’t—” The frantic color in his face was leaving quickly, alarmingly, and Draco watched with a detached sense of rightness. It was not comforting, but like his morning ablutions, it provided him with a certain kind of clearheadedness.
There were no initials on the bottom of the note, but Harry didn't need them. He didn’t look up, instead folding the note into a tiny square and clearing his throat awkwardly.
They are, of course, the same boy. It’s just easier, if Harry pretends they’re not. If he puts up a screen between the conversations he has with the first Malfoy, and the fumbles he has with the second Malfoy. If he pretends—well. If he pretends.
,” Draco snapped, grabbing half the pile and stalking over to Madam Pince’s desk.
. So this was what the Headmistress had been talking about.
Draco startled badly. He’d forgotten, somehow, where they were. It seemed Potter had, too; he whipped around, immediately embarrassed. But of course none of the few spectators were looking their way. All attention was focused on the last game, which must have just concluded. As Draco paid attention, his heart rate slowing, he realized the sounds were not cheers. It was an argument, growing louder by the second.
Only an idiot, he decided. Only the worst kind of idiot.
Ron interrupts with a frustrated breath. “Just because he’s not bothering you as much this year doesn’t mean he’s in league with You-Know-Who, Harry.”
And Draco, clouds parting, smiles.
Malfoy’s mouth twitched. “You’re unbelievable. Aren’t you the least bit curious?”
There wasn’t even idle gossip to spread. Draco had never realized how breakable those carefully crafted friendships between him and his housemates were until now, with Pansy and Daphne not speaking to him, and Greg a carefully avoided presence, his broken promise to ask him to join the gobstones team long forgotten. Theo had spoken to Draco only once since their return. A brief moment on the train, his narrow face a little harder, his mouth a little sadder.
Malfoy lifts his head, at that; tilts it up towards the sky and the stars as he says to the moon, “You’ve done more than you think, Potter.”
“Why?” Potter sat next to Draco, his back to the stone so he was able to look Draco full in the face.
to say what happened was fucked up, Malfoy. It just was. And it’s not even about you, really.”
Officer Evergreen turned back to Draco, nearly amused. “Harry Potter?” he said again. Like Draco thought him a fool for even entertaining the idea.
me to,” Draco snapped.
Draco made a vaguely distressed noise that was almost, bizarrely, a laugh. “I—panicked, in the Headmistress’ office. I’ve been having them since the beginning of the year. I’m not—I’m not—”
that?”
magical.
They walked in uneasy silence, Harry trailing after Malfoy like an afterthought. It was a nice night, all gentle winds and bright moon, but Harry's thoughts kept returning to the figure of Malfoy ahead of him, pale hair glinting in the moonlight.
“Right,” Malfoy said, after a long moment. Their hands were quite close now, the tips of their fingers hooked slightly around each other. “I suppose this is it, then?”
Draco scoffed. "Of course it was. Most people don't—didn't—even realize what the room was, did they? You only had to ask for the right thing."
Harry tuned out the rest of the conversation in favor of staring morosely at his bed, finding fault with it the longer he stared at it. It hardly seemed bigger than his cot under the staircase, now that he was
So Harry says, “I don’t know,” because he doesn’t know how to say that soulmates may not be real, but a hundred years from now, Malfoy still will be.
The swivel of two dozen heads in his direction, however, Draco did notice. The heavy, echoing quiet of an argument interrupted hung in the air.
Time stretched, and stretched, and with it came all those morning ablutions, but with a watery, impartial distance. They were horrors, and he was culpable, and yet he would be thrown back into a cell for selfishly taking back a wand that had chosen him when he’d been small, and stupid, and perhaps not blameless, but certainly more innocent than he was now.
It was inevitable, really, that Malfoy would lean forward and press their lips together. Inevitable that Harry would kiss him back, his spine tingling with the feeling.
“You’re not,” Potter said dismissively, attempting to balance the stack of books under his arms as if he wasn’t perfectly capable of charming them to float obediently next to him. Perhaps he wasn’t, now that Draco thought about it.
was that?”
Harry says, “You have to tell me everything, first.”
The castle, too, had her scars, and Draco was tending to those wounds on the long, lonely evenings that he didn’t go to the library. The electives wing was reassembling itself slowly, stone by stone, now that the dark magic was no longer hindering its growth Each repair was in precisely in the right place, but wrong in inexplicable ways: the grey stone gave way to random spots of sand-blasted whites with colorful speckles and layered red-browns. Draco came back one night to find two classrooms reformed, and when he peeked inside, not expecting much—the castle could repair its walls and doorways, but not its furnishings—he found the shape was completely different. In one, stone risers sloped along a third of the room, as if for a choir, and a ceiling vaulted higher than was possible for a room on the ground floor. In the other, the middle of the room was depressed several steps down before leveling out into a wide semi-circle. It wasn’t until Draco had hopped to the bottom and looked up that he realized it was the same shape as the courtrooms in the Ministry, but for the windows set high in each wall, streaming sunlight downwards.
His mother had assured him that her current lodgings were adequate, but Draco knew she was searching for a home or flat large enough to house both of them, and that Draco’s probationary terms regarding his housing post-Hogwarts—no Fidelius charms, anti-apparition wards required, restricted private floo service—made this task significantly more difficult. It would be too much to be kicked out now, when he had no idea whether his mother would be able to take him just yet.
, so he said, "If I give you a jumper, will you go?"
“Oh,” Harry says, something twisting in his chest. But Malfoy still doesn’t seem mad at him for it.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” he’d answered, while she gently shoved him to the side and removed a pale green self-inking quill from her bag. Hers was the first Slytherin name on the parchment, and they both stared, quiet. Then she handed him the quill and Draco pushed it aside with a curled lip, because he was not signing a petition with
Draco’s chest heaved and he knew Potter could feel it, because Draco could feel the rise of Potter’s chest, too. And with the space of those breaths came creeping, quieting awareness. The grin slipped incrementally from his face. Draco couldn’t remember the last time he’d been this close to anyone, let alone Potter. They were close enough that Draco felt Potter’s breath hitch, the tiny sound of it reverberating like heels on a marble floor, or shackles closing around thin wrists. The precursor to some terrible harm he was bringing upon himself.
Potter raised his eyebrows, and Draco mimicked the expression. Astoria, looking at where he was staring, said sharply, “Do
He was very nearly convinced that Potter was not actually planning to kill him as some protracted form of vengeance. This only left a few dozen possibilities for what, exactly, Potter was playing at, though the list grew longer with every morning ablution—coward and Death Eater and unimportant—and with each reminder, new reasons for Potter’s behaviour, crueler with each panicked turn of his thoughts, were conjured in the empty spaces of Draco’s mind.
Which, okay. Harry stares at the deep red bed hangings overhead and thinks:
Madam Pomfrey waited, undemanding and patient. After a time, she suggested, “You could start by telling me what happened today.”
Each letter Harry pens to Andromeda is looked over with brutal precision by Malfoy before being sent off. Her replies are filled with subdued but pointed questions about the mysterious Slytherin he’d like her to speak with, and the plan Harry is working on with him.
By this point, Draco would have eaten at least two biscuits and drank his first cup of tea, nodding like a puppet on a string whenever the Headmistress paused. It was funny, to have these conversations now, because when he first started skipping classes and missing assignments during that slow strangulation of sixth year, the Headmistress had not been nearly so concerned; it was hard to remember through the haze of panic that existed over the memories of that year, but Draco was certain that she’d only had the one conversation with him, after his first missed Transfiguration assignment. Pursed lips, voice clipped, as if she’d never had a student miss an assignment before:
Clearly sensing something in the way Draco’s face tightened, Queensbury hurried on, “She, ah, had us do a test run with some of the other houses last week. Zeller was there for some of it—” He cast a quick, apologetic look at Zeller. “—and we used, uh, you know. The memories, again. As a sort of starting point? It went well,” Queensbury continued, nearly hopeful, “But we talked a little bit about, um. You. Since we could tell you were kind of, um…”
in a fit of mortification and childishness that involved throwing his wand away from him. It clattered towards the doorway to the dormitories, where a pale Baddock stood with a slim, battered case and several magazines clutched to his chest. He looked to Draco and then to Draco’s wand, which had landed near Baddock’s slippered feet, and then back to Draco.
The stony silence that followed indicated that none of the parties involved felt there would be a good way to decide this. Harry personally felt like choosing would be worse than doing it randomly—there wasn't a Slytherin he would
“Does it upset you when that happens?” She was still speaking in that clinical voice, and it was so much easier to breathe when she did. Madam Pomfrey had never pretended to care about Draco in particular, but neither had she failed to help when he came to her. She had cleaned his wound in third year and clicked her tongue when she heard it was done by a Hippogriff. She gave him headache potions when it was close to exams. She soaked his bandages in dittany and forced blood replenishing potion down his throat while Professor Snape closed the deep gashes across Draco’s torso and neck and chest.
“Malfoy,” said Potter, warning, but Draco ignored him. He stopped right between Professor Applesnap and Baddock, his spine rigid.
It was clear that the group was led by Gryffindors, as the nearly unanimous decision was to attempt the repairs that very night.
Parchment crinkled under his hand. Potter kicked him, hard, but Draco was already letting out a noise of triumph. Ignoring all propriety, he stuck his hand into the pocket to fetch the map.
“Charmed,” Astoria said, with a pretty smile. “Malfoy was telling me about your dedication to ensuring a Hogwarts victory for the gobstones team.”
said all of you had to be locked away during the battle,” said another student, speaking right over Baddock. “Because you were going to help You-Know-Who.”
. Her voice was very calm. “When you took down the Manor wards, what happened?”
“What,” Draco started to ask, distracted immediately by Potter’s other hand sliding up and into his hair, Potter’s mouth catching his again.
“Yes,” Draco said. Bribing the judicial system with most of the Malfoy vaults: acceptable. Public acknowledgment of affection: incomprehensible. “It was bad enough that Mother sent me sweets every week.”
Draco gave her a severe look, feeling his face heat up with preemptive humiliation. Recently, how he felt for Potter seemed too obvious, as easily broadcast across his face as his hatred had once been. It was easily ignored when it was just him and Potter, but a paranoid flush ran up Draco’s neck whenever he spoke to Potter in classes, the echo of Theo’s voice in his ear. Perhaps more worryingly, Draco was certain Potter himself would bring it up, would turn to him as they headed out of the library and ask, with those clear, green eyes,
Harry was about to point out that surely the others were used to him disappearing at odd hours of the night, but that probably wasn't helpful. And Malfoy was already at the door, mouth an impatient line as Harry dithered by the bedside.
see the ones on the insides of his thighs, dark and tender distractions from the burn of Malfoy’s fingers working him open. Harry’s fingers itch to press down on them.
“No.” He didn’t even have to think about it. “Father would have thought it weak.”
A little agitated, Draco continued, “Or, I don’t know. Don’t you have an invisibility cloak? You could—I don’t suppose many people will be lurking about tonight. You could—you could—”
It’s worse, almost, than being called
“I fucking hate you,” Harry says instead, to the ceiling. His throat hurts, and not from the sorts of things he dreams about. Harry is laying on his back on the stone floor, Malfoy a huddled form at his peripheral.
Finally, quietly, Malfoy says, “It’s still hard, Potter. You can’t change that, either.”
They didn't speak much as they made their way out of the castle, their hands brushing with increasing frequency. Harry's neck prickled with heat, and he was thankful for the cool breeze that greeted them when they made it outside. His face felt like it was on fire.
His mother had never been the type to offer words of comfort, and she hadn’t become such overnight. But she scooted closer, pulling Draco’s head towards her shoulder.
“And do begin attending your classes,” she added, as Draco reached the door. “Whatever else is going on, this is still a school.”
Daggers would be less painful than the force of Malfoy’s glare. “
Harry isn’t a particularly good actor.
For the first time, the full force of the impossibility of what they’re doing hits Harry. Malfoy is a
It takes another blink before Harry relaxes and actually
Draco traced a finger along the lines of the castle walls, hovering at the Astronomy Tower, then dropping to press against the hilly grounds he ran across with Professor Snape on the worst day of his life; he swiped the pads of his fingers against the western wing, still under construction, and the lower towers with their broken lines, both casualties from the Battle at Hogwarts.
Malfoy opens his eyes slowly. His eyelashes are very long, but Harry already knew that. He knew that even before he was close enough to touch Malfoy. “Couldn’t be bothered. It isn’t like I saw much of anyone after.”
?” Malfoy spits the words out, voice thin, his face alight with something that looks far too breakable to be fury. It’s not fury, but his hands seem to think it is. They’ve curled into tight fists.
"Trying to set it afire?" Malfoy's voice was unexpectedly close, and Harry jumped at the sound. He turned to find Malfoy, arms crossed tightly across his chest, barefoot next to him. He looked weird in normal sleepwear, with his hair clearly free of product. He almost looked like a regular person, instead of the bane of Harry's existence. The sour look he wore as he glared at the duvet, however, was refreshingly familiar.
There’s a shiver in Harry’s chest; an old wound, reopening. An

He wondered if the same was true for Potter.
a dream. Perhaps Draco had not left his bed at all today, as sometimes occurred, and his mind was conjuring up a world in which Draco ranted, loud and endless, and Potter listened, quiet and drowsing, and neither of them addressed the clear fallacy of the situation.
“Asking was all we had to do to get into the Room of Requirement,” Creevey pointed out. They’d migrated to one of the classrooms on the ground floor, Draco tapping the frames of the windows so they would creak open and let the brisk air in.
you’re not loyal to him—”
When they broke apart, Potter was grinning again, looking very satisfied. “Yes,” he said again, “I did.”
“Yes,” Malfoy says now, a touch harried. Like it’s another question.
the parchment before he could see it.
been, to wonder how, exactly, he’s meant to get a man to open up about the thing he’s most ashamed of.
Before Draco’s return to Hogwarts, he’d considered—awkward, uncertain—sending letters to his father, too. But Officer Abbott-Jones informed Draco that his probation forbade him contact with current inmates, and this knowledge sharpened the eighteen months of his sentence into painful, unyielding clarity, pressing hard against his breastbone. Draco had clutched Officer Abbott-Jones’ letter in a pale fist and sat on the edge of the Manor’s roof, blank-faced for several hours until his mother called him in for dinner.
Worse, people kept
There had been a mad dash of violence in the hours and days following the Dark Lord’s defeat. While the winners rejoiced and grieved, the Death Eaters and their supporters fled, the auror forces too thin and the fighters briefly negligent in facilitating their capture.
Potter grabbed at Draco’s wrist, pushing them away from him, but he was laughing when he said, “You fucking
Voice shaking, Baddock said, “Malfoy is still a student, and there’s nothing in the rules—”
At the beginning of sixth year, before he’d successfully ostracized his classmates, before Potter tried to kill him, Pansy had dragged him to the Hospital Wing for extra-strength Pepper-up, convinced he was ill. Madam Pomfrey had given him a bed to rest in and said, in that way of hers,
Draco stoked the embers, carefully. They flickered, just enough to catch weakly. He said, “Greg,” but had nothing to follow it up with. Those two words,
Professor Sinistra had stopped speaking.
“Draco,” called Astoria, from where she was standing next to a chalkboard that read, through the many, many rewrites,
Draco swiftly learned that he was perhaps not meant for teaching. Although there was something very satisfying about the general awed attention he was graced with when he brought up Hogwarts’ magical index and demonstrated the charmwork, Draco was also impatient and disliked having to repeat himself. So far, only Granger had mastered pulling up the magical index
This argument took the better part of the next twenty minutes, until it was unhappily decided that each Gryffindor would be paired with a Slytherin in the name of fairness, but mostly because none of them were willing to give up their beds so the Slytherins could sleep two-to-two.
This is the quietest dream Harry has: he knows what to do with his hands. Draco kisses him good morning in full view of everyone in the Great Hall. The world doesn’t end. If there is water, there is also a pale hand, plunging after him to pull him up. Catastrophe is averted. Somewhere, light streams through open windows.
known. It was a frighteningly depressing thought.
Officer Abbott-Jones flipped her ponytail over her other shoulder, and beckoned Draco over to the fireplace. “I’ll have to call the floo address for you,” she said, “Standard, you know.”
It was empty except for Madam Pomfrey. She stood at the countertop outside of the potions storeroom, a hovering cart stopped at her side. Her head came up from where she was filling individual doses of anti-nausea potion—Draco had brewed it just this week—and she carefully, decisively put her ladle back down.
“No, it’s—” Baddock cleared his throat. “Professor Sinistra said we shouldn’t downplay what happened.”
Harry pauses with his quill hovering over the bottom of the parchment. There are more questions Malfoy wants to ask Andromeda, ones he won’t put to paper for fear of being discovered. This sounds like one of them.
“Merlin no,” Potter said, then, sounding far more alarmed than Draco, “Are
. It was almost irritated, this thought, impatient for its meaning to sink in.
Harry’s heartbeat is loud in his ears, his throat constricted around bile. “You shouldn’t have,” he says, before he can stop himself.
She was several arm-lengths away now, and nearly at the door. She looked away from him, and didn’t wait for him to answer. “Because sometimes, Draco, you have to actually take part in the world you want to see. I’ll save you a seat.”
Harry forced his gaze back to the colors, already beginning to fade. “Whose wishes?” he asked, though he had a feeling he knew the answer.
“Oh,” said Baddock in a carefully neutral tone. A few more students trickled into the common room, in various states of wakefulness; the looks sent towards Draco were more considering than they’d been before. Still a far cry from when Draco could comfortably rely on polite friendliness and automatic inclusion, but Draco relieving in its own was.
It’s not something Harry has even considered, for either of them, and now, anxious, he says, “I don’t—I mean, there isn’t—but if you, erm, do you—?”
“Right,” Draco said, very slowly putting his quill down. “You can’t actually want me to go.”
Blessedly, Hermione didn’t seem to need additional information. She sat up straight, looking incredibly excited.
“That third year got more points than you,” Potter said, vanishing the liquid and making a face at Draco. “
There’s the body and then there’s the startled heart, and Harry knows both enough, now, to say, “You aren't anything like your father,” and mean it. If his hands were free, if they weren’t hidden in an alleyway under a cloak, he would map out the differences with his fingers, every dip and valley that he knows to be Draco and Draco alone. He would point out where Draco’s fingernails bite into the flesh of his palm when he’s frustrated, and the spot on his thigh where he’ll tap out a nervous rhythm when Harry lays out the harms he caused when they were younger, and the hollows between each finger where his hands suffocate each other when Draco is haltingly questioning what used to be a truth to him. Learned knowledge, the kind you can only get by paying attention. Harry has been paying attention. He’s always been.
Draco had a little breakdown in the loo in the long-empty Languages wing. It was better, because fewer people wandered there; it was worse, because Moaning Myrtle tended to.
Then he was running, careless of the other students in the corridors or the single, familiar shout of
The realization leaves him shaken. He doesn’t know how to do that, to say what he’s feeling. He can tell for other people, has

dinner, and the only times Harry has seen him at breakfast is when Parkinson or Goyle appears to drag him into the hall behind them.
"A walk?" Malfoy repeated in a scathing whisper. "In the middle of the night?"
,” Draco said, though he was also unmotivated, and he’d always been weak to the full force of Potter’s attention on him. He was getting so much of it recently, and the desire for it was only growing. He looked up.
“Sorry?” said Draco.
"Well, get to bed whenever you're up for it, Potter," he said, unconcerned. "Just don't wake me."
"I say we leave it to chance, eh?" Zabini spoke with a lightness that didn't match the strained line of his mouth.
Baddock took a deep breath. “Look, I know you only signed up so we’d have enough numbers to stay an active team,” he began, in a great, tripping rush, “But the Headmistress says we can’t compete unless
“Baddock,” greeted Draco, nodding at him politely.
But then Draco would catch a glimpse of
“How would I know?” Khan asked, very mildly, “Or do you regularly open the scrolls your Head of House asks you to deliver,” and the Gryffindor prefect quieted.
And when Malfoy answered, “I wonder,” it sounded like he knew the answer, too.
“Yes, yes,” Professor Flitwick said happily, taking down the shield charms he’d put up to contain the weather. “But I always hoped you would take a Charms concentration, you know. The elemental charms were intended for the end of term exam, and you’ve nearly mastered them only already!”
Astoria, at least, was pleased about this. “You should have been going since the beginning,” she was saying as they took the stairs to the fourth floor after dinner.
Outside one high window, a flash of red twin plaits and the sound of Creevey’s laughter as the tower’s roof constructed itself overhead. Halfway up the staircase, a platform and balcony swelled outwards, overlooking the sloping path towards the Hogwarts gates, a dark smudge in the distance.
There was a collective groan as everyone read the name of their bedmate, but Harry felt he had the most reason to be filled with dread.
"It's not even locked," Malfoy said, in some outrage. He cast a
“Excuse me?” Draco asked, incredulous. He finally lifted his gaze from the parchment to glare at Potter, not caring that his voice had risen slightly. “Am I supposed to spend the rest of the night watching for you on this fucking
Draco bit on his tongue until he felt certain he wouldn’t say something flippant like
Draco did not care for this particular reminder. “Why not ask Baddock to go with you?”
Draco closed his eyes for a moment, to process that Potter
“You’re sure?” Potter’s breath gusted across Draco’s face, his face tilted upwards, his eyes intent.
Draco made a noise of assent in the back of his throat, carefully placing the cup on the edge of her desk. That was a lie, but a kind one. He rushed through the end-of-meeting niceties, feeling displaced from his body. It was a familiar feeling. He spent most of the war in this way, only occasionally jarred back into it: Nagini curled around his ankles; his mother brushing his hair back;
It’s not the rage that surfaces in his words, though it’s still
It turned out that there was a record for most consecutive house points lost in a single evening, and that the combination of over thirty students from various houses losing two hundred points a piece neatly smashed that record. It also led to most of the houses being so deep in the negatives that it was quite possible that the House Cup would go by default to whichever house managed to get closest to zero.
“Oh, fuck you.” Harry presses his nose into Malfoy’s skin and scowls. It’s warm, here; warmer still, when Harry hooks his arms around Malfoy’s thin shoulders. Then his legs, too, until he’s as wrapped up around Malfoy as he can be while still fully clothed. The prickling under his skin quiets and then fades, as they stay like that.
"We don't want to get rid of all the wards, do we?" asked Baddock, sounding alarmed. "Just the ones pushing away non-magical people."
“Is Khan in herbology with you?” he asked, refusing to stop. The corridor was crowded, and the other students seemed to press closer as they continued to spill out of the Great Hall.
A month into the new term, Astoria found Draco in the common room and perched a thick scroll of parchment atop Draco’s study materials, smiling beatifically. Suspicious, Draco unfurled it and immediately made a face at her. Six years of glaring at Granger’s notes and essays whenever he was near enough meant that Draco was certain of the author behind this letter.
A faint smile lit Potter’s face. “Merlin forbid.”
Draco tilted his head. “Did you truly think I wanted to be back?”
“Do all Muggle tales end like that?” Draco asked, because the text on the page was clearly the end of a story. “‘And they lived happily ever after’? What bollocks.”
. “How could you
,” Draco practically snarled, taken aback by the force of his own reaction. He took a large, steadying breath, clutching the back of a nearby armchair. He refused to be hurt; Greg was right to assume so, because that had been how the world operated until recently. But his voice still had a bite to it when he said, “That’s up to Baddock.”
Her voice carried clear and ringing across the hall and struck Draco like a stunner. It was his fault. Of course it was. His heart pounded in his ears. Potter started towards the argument like the bull-headed hero he’d always been, and Draco stood with his hands resting at his neck, nails digging into his spine, which had always been composed of paper.
Harry unfolded the parchment as soon as Hermione turned back to her work, writing out
So, the sky.
The new room she showed him to was brighter, though not much bigger, and an enchanted clock cheerily informed them it was half past noon. Draco had been here for roughly two and a half hours.
Draco took a moment to digest this, shook his head, and said, “I shudder to think what a Hufflepuff invasion looks like.”
It had always been the question, whether Draco was eleven or seventeen, hating Potter or—something worse. It was a question that hurt, a chronic pain that flared and dulled in a pattern Draco had never been able to discern.
He lifts his face and twists so he can look at Malfoy, who’s staring at him with his hair still a mess. “What about you?” Harry asks, carefully.
“Maybe she’ll hate me anyways,” Draco says, staring at Harry’s nose. “Maybe she’ll hate me on my own merit.”
The look is gone a second later; Malfoy sneers, a familiar expression on unfamiliar ground. “To keep my family safe. Not that you would know anything about that, Potter.”
Malfoy’s reddens further, and someone—Ron, maybe—tries to interject. But something in Harry’s chest has boiled over and snapped, so he continues, voice rising impossibly louder, “What the fuck are you thinking? He’s going to
, and ignores Malfoy’s complaints that he shouldn’t be so forthright.
“Very handsome,” she declared, and Draco, despite himself, smiled.
“Really?” Baddock put down his newest
“In the mornings,” Draco started, voice all wrong. He tried to clear his throat, but it didn’t help. “In the mornings I have to, to remind myself of the—things I did at Manor, and during the Battle—”
Seeing his confusion, Astoria explained, “The Hufflepuffs have begun a campaign to invade the other common rooms to foster inter-house unity.”
Malfoy's expression shifted quickly into a scowl, and Harry stifled a laugh before throwing the cloak over the two of them and heading out.
“You were going to fly?” Potter sounded less angry.
Theo turned slightly, to catch Draco’s eye and nudge his head in the direction of the other side of the room. His expression was hard.
, he doesn't say, because that's unfair. Harry doesn't
But it wasn’t, because Professor Sinistra frowned. “You of course do not have to participate, should we continue this either within the house, or outside of it.”
“Perhaps not with me,” she said next, and Draco bit on the inside of his lip to stop a sneer from rising. “We’ve contacted a number of—”
Astoria tolerated this for about thirty seconds before she put a hand on his arm and said, rather forcefully, “We’re going to be late.”
When Flitwick looked away, Potter’s hand slid over the tight curl of Draco’s finger, forcing them, patiently, to unclench; and Draco let it happen, let his fingers be pried apart until Potter’s hand was flat against his own, the crumpled parchment caught between their sweaty palms.
He said, in what Draco would later recognize as an attempt to tactfully move past Draco’s obvious fit of madness, “Um, did you still need to get a gobstones set from the clubroom? For the tournament?”
“What are
“Perhaps you are,” Astoria said, her steps growing steadily farther away.
And yet the nightmares were still preferable to facing an obstinate Harry Potter, holding out Draco’s hawthorn wand as if Draco wanted it back.
. Or, even worse,
“I’d say you’ve figured out how to do my prick, actually. What else could you

“Of course you do,” Harry mimics snidely, holding Malfoy’s gaze.
Malfoy looks angry. He looks so, so angry as he stares down at Harry, his pale hair in disarray and his mouth pink and twisting. Like he would destroy a dozen golden trinkets in a fit of fury if given half the chance. Like he’s looking to start a war. Like he’s looking to end one.
“It’s
Draco made a noncommittal noise, pointedly flipping open his runes dictionary. In truth, he felt vaguely ashamed. Not just about the defacement, which was almost certainly from one of the quietly vocal supporters that still lingered in the Slytherin common room and probably others, but about how nobody had seen fit to do anything about it. How many students had looked and then, just as immediately, looked away?
“How does it work? The magic?” Harry finally thought to ask, when they were nearly at the portrait hole. Their steps had slowed slightly, just enough to show some reluctance to arrive at their destination.
noticed Draco’s presence at all. She was frowning, her hand finishing a word even as she lifted her head. She didn’t say anything, but there was an undeniable jut of her chin that spoke of distrust.
“Thank you, sir,” Harry says as he leaves, when what he really wants to say is,
So Harry writes,
, Draco would think,
Potter didn’t move away, nor did he drop Draco’s hands.
He didn’t look up, but Draco had the sudden feeling that Officer Abbott-Jones was staring at him. Like how sometimes the mood in the Manor would shift so suddenly and completely at a single word, emotions so dense one could open their mouth and feel it sizzle along their tongue. It was like that, only instead of terror, Draco suspected he would taste deep, unmoving sadness in the air.
“Hullo,” Draco said, bewildered by the strangeness of Potter asleep on the pitch in the middle of the night and the ghost touch of his cold hand at Draco’s cheek. He shifted away from Potter, barely aware of the twinge in his knee as he stood or the sting of his palms where he wiped them against his robes. Everything still felt removed, dream-like; the day in the classroom seemed like months ago. “What on earth are you doing?”
Harry keeps thinking of the graveyard, and the torture Voldemort inflicted on Avery, after throwing himself at his feet. Keeps thinking about the way a body contorts under the cruciatus. Keeps thinking about the deceptively gentle flutter of the Veil.
Malfoy is in the Slytherin dormitory, two dots labelled ‘Gregory Goyle’ and ‘Vincent Crabbe’ on either side of the room. Harry’s shoulders relax.
bed was recently engulfed by flames, and I'm feeling ever so sensitive about it. Surely you understand my need for some control, in this situation."
And then Draco’s voice died in his throat, because he was abruptly very close to Potter, the sound of the cloak snapping in the air louder than anything. Potter looked nearly as startled as Draco felt, green eyes wide and bright in the moonlight as the transfigured cloak settled across his shoulders. Draco could almost feel the movement of Potter’s swallow, intimate and uncertain, against his knuckles, frozen where Draco had the cloak’s clasp in either hand. A thin strip of light from the Entrance Hall split them half in light, shadows pronounced and growing where they cast them.
Madam Pomfrey nodded, never stopping in her motions. Ladle the potion; empty it into a vial; hand it to Draco to label. It was very efficient, and proper, and Draco felt as if he would unravel if she so much as looked up at him.
Draco’s fingers twitched. He wasn’t sure which of them eventually shifted their hand over just enough to drop their fingers into the delicate hollow between each digit, or which of them pulled away first. He just knew that Potter ended up with the letter and Draco ended up with the seared heat of Potter’s hand curled against his.
“Because you already have that covered, of course,” Draco answered, trying for a dry tone that would cover his surprise. Hogsmeade station was crowded with students waiting for the Hogwarts Express, a bustle of bodies that pushed Draco and Potter to one side of the platform, half-hidden by a stone pillar. Not an arm’s length away, Granger and Weasley were doing a poor job of surreptitiously observing them.
Harry groans, unable to help it; a helpless sort of laugh follows after. “
?” Draco hissed, only barely containing the urge to Incendio the parchment.
There was the unexpected gift delivered by Astoria’s owl the day after Christmas, and the takeaway Narcissa ordered, and the muggle shops they wandered through, Draco trailing behind his mother and thinking of Potter, who he still owed a gift to. A thought occasionally came to Draco during these times, one much delayed, that he was no longer living in the nightmare. That time had continued its march forward, heedless of him. Sometimes the thought came to him at the heels of a sleepless night or a sound that sent him still and useless:
Halfway down the corridor, several paces behind the tiny troop of second and third years loudly hurrying towards breakfast, Baddock cleared his throat. He said, “I didn’t know.”
The Gryffindor prefect made a distasteful little noise, then looked pointedly away when he stopped in front of them.
Malfoy.”
"Well, no one died yet," Ron said, "Mind, I did wake with Zabini's pointy elbow in my bloody ribs."
, Draco wanted to say, but he was thinking of Potter, and of Astoria, and of Baddock; he was thinking of his meeting with Professor Sinistra. He was thinking of the things he deserved, and the things that he had, and how difficult it was to ascertain for himself how much more blame he was supposed to shoulder.
“Do you know how many places we couldn’t take our dad to, even though he was allowed to know about magic because of us?”
Malfoy’s mouth turns unhappy. “I’m actually
He burst into the Hospital Wing at nearly a sprint.
,” Harry says, squeezing back much harder.
So overwhelmed were the lot of them that no one realized they had another addition until the crisp voice of Headmistress McGonagall sliced through the silence to say, “What in Merlin’s name is going on?”
The sneer is quickly replaced with the smirk that has continually proven to be Harry’s downfall. Without looking away from Harry, Draco flips a golden galleon with a gloved hand—Harry’s gift to him—and catches it deftly before knocking deliberately into Harry’s shoulder and continuing his trek to his own compartment. Harry tries to push aside the errant, unwanted thought of impending danger as he watches Draco walk away.
The doorknob rattled and turned with an audible click. Draco blinked at it, the action taking all of his effort. He had no idea how long he’d been here, and it occurred to him as the door swung inwards that he’d just wasted the last however-long of his freedom frozen when he should have been—he didn’t know. Savoring the stuffy air, the existence of a chair and table, neither of which he’d had in Azkaban.
circle Draco’s chair at mealtimes—
This is why Harry picks his head up from where it was tucked against Malfoy’s neck, and asks, “Why are you upset?”
“Tests in the Great Hall?” Baddock guessed. He was stabbing at his fried tomatoes and appeared unlikely to stop for long enough to actually eat them. “Or the Ministry practice sessions? The governors said that temporary, isolated disabling of the wards isn’t
“No,” Draco said hastily, on the edge of a strained laugh. “No, I’ve my-my service hours to do with Madam Pomfrey.”
“As in the old days,” Astoria agreed solemnly. Then, a bit more seriously, “You
Silence stretched between them. Draco, always weak to it, asked, “Did—did you get back alright?”
Malfoy’s nostrils flare, his eyes darting away.
“Surely someone else is available for this?”
Draco’s pulse beat at the base of his throat, vibrating loudly throughout the rest of his body. He couldn’t do this. How was anyone meant to start over with anyone else? He stood, crushing the quill in his hand, mouth down turned severely when he said, “Well,” like it was a full statement, then again, “Well.”
change you. Will make you think of all the other places a mouth can be, and how startlingly warm another person’s body is. Some people you will kiss, and you will suddenly
Harry lifts his head, glasses smudged. Malfoy’s face is very close and Harry tilts his chin towards him, instinctively. “What?”
“Welcome back, Mr. Malfoy,” he heard Headmistress McGonagall say, but it was as if she were speaking through layers and layers of heavy fabric pressed against Draco’s ears.
. Draco wanted to press his hands to his ears until it went away. He wanted to be a child again, a proper one, and then realized he never wanted to be the child he had once been ever again; he was longing for a past that never existed, for a blamelessness that would never be attributed to him, only he’d forgotten that. Momentarily he’d forgotten, but of course, such things were infectious; he’d ruined his teammates for his thoughtlessness.
, then shut it. He walked to the floo room with his head down and threw the floo powder into the flames almost at the same time he walked into the fire.
was. Draco inhaled shakily and barely resisted the impulse to plant his palms into his sockets and push down until the world made sense again.
The conversation—argument, if that was what it was, which Draco wasn’t sure about—put Draco in a black mood for the rest of the day. He studied angrily and ate angrily and had a miserable hour curled up in his bed, buried under the covers, wondering if he would ever stop being the kind of person who hurt other people on purpose, if he would ever stop being cruel, if he would ever stop wanting Potter’s attention, if he would ever just fucking
It was unfair, really, that Malfoy looked
What was there to say to her, the only person left who would bother to hear him talk, who he’d left alone?
And it won’t be until evening has come and gone again that Harry will realize he said
Astoria gave his arm a sympathetic pat before going back to her frankly alarming stack of fried eggs and tomatoes. “It’s only that you never talk about it,” she said wisely. “We’ve avoided mentioning it.”
The night lost its dream-like edge. It was dark, and damp, and cold without the sun.
Draco waited until she was bounding towards Creevey, talking about stealing brooms from the quidditch shed, to round on Potter. “You talked to her about me?”
Draco hands twitched. He shut the heavy oak doors with a bang that probably sounded through the castle, rattling the stone walls.
bastard. You’re the worst boyfriend I’ve ever had.”
Here is a second secret: Harry is beginning to cling to the idea that he
Harry rolled the tip of his quill between his fingers, feeling his ears flame. "Erm, what d'you mean?"
If pressed, Harry could admit that he spent more years of his life pretending to be living a different one than paying attention to his actual one. His most consistent daydream—his most elaborate—featured Lily and James Potter, alive and loving and warm. In his mind, their home—
Draco looked to the fire, which was going so low it would soon be embers. “I don’t either.”
, he thought.
So he did; Draco had visited Myrtle the first, awful week back and declared the same in between splashing cold, metallic water on his face. “The Headmistress said I must,” he told her now.
not the one with a jumper with my name on the front, Potter."
Greg said, voice rough with disuse, “You played in the gobstones tournament over the weekend.”
“Then,” Draco began, without knowing where the statement was headed. Panic pulsed in his throat, across the top of his skin. “Then—”
The second thing he knows is this: his very existence is greedy, which is why he is fundamentally unlovable. Being greedy makes you ungrateful; being ungrateful means you’ll never earn affection, and never earning affection means you should just do your best impersonation of a plaster wall until you get so good at the impersonation that you won’t even question why you live in a cupboard anymore.
Potter was in the Owlery when Draco made his way up, sitting on one of the window ledges with his back against the arcing stone. He looked over at Draco’s entry, the closed off look on his face lightening with such speed that Draco stumbled, caught off guard.
He doesn’t want to think of what choice Malfoy will make if his mother disagrees with him, and he certainly doesn’t want to think of what will happen if Malfoy never returns from the Manor. Harry’s chest burns at the thought; he presses his hands against his closed eyelids, shoving his glasses awkwardly atop his head with the movement, and applies pressure until color bursts.
it, that low buzz that accompanied great magic and set the little hairs at his nape standing straight.
Potter’s gaze hardened, eyes boring into Draco’s with that bullheaded determination that Draco only ever saw from afar, for things that mattered.
Draco knew why he hadn’t mentioned the war or the years before: because none of this would continue if he did. It would remind Potter that before the war, Draco was one of the worst things to happen to him. It was selfish; Draco rolled the word on his tongue, as a reminder.
staring.
Potter took another step forwards, surer than his first.
Draco no longer took the Prophet, but he’d seen the folded over copies his housemates left on the end tables in the common room. Godric’s Hollow was hosting a celebration, from the break of morning until well into the evening, to unveil a new memorial in honor of Potter, and—Potter probably didn’t take the Prophet either, did he?
Draco looked back at the trio’s retreating forms and said, with a levity he didn’t truly feel, “We were only ever students. Everything else was just an interruption.”
But Draco was not trying to undo old magic, just scrub the newer, poisonous ones, and Hogwarts, the tired old thing, knew it. She nudged him close, directed his attention with a slanted floor or quivering wall. It was easier, in any case, to pull apart magic than put it back together; and perhaps that made sense, in a twisted way. It had taken Draco most of the year to get the vanishing cabinet to work, to be clever and determined enough to thread the magic precisely how it needed to be threaded, but after only a few hours, he cleared nearly half the stones on the ground floor.
Harry spits out, indignant and wounded, “
Potter was quiet and watchful as the silence grew heavier, but Draco knew enough, now, to recognize when a scared thing was getting ready to bite.
Draco waved a hand vaguely, then immediately put it back down, gut swooping at the sensation of being unbalanced. Personally, he felt it was quite obvious what Potter wanted to do, what with the sharp, unmoving way he stared at Draco. Potter had always been firmly in the ‘punch Draco in the face, or something worse’ camp.
This early, the common room was mostly deserted, the water from the lake dappling soft, wavering shadows along the tabletops and window seats. Baddock was sitting at the table that held Khan’s pensieve the night before, which she’d taken up to her room sometime before Draco dragged himself back to the castle last night. His memory was still in there, but retrieving it felt distant and unimportant. It was almost a relief to no longer have it in his head.
“Did she,” Draco said sourly, dropping the bacon directly into his mouth. Professor Sinistra had been good on her word. Just a week after their conversation, she posted a glowing notice with the date of a house meeting—the first Draco could remember since before the war, the welcome meeting notwithstanding—to the notice board.
It was Nott who spoke first, his voice incredulous. "They can't seriously expect us all to sleep here. What are we supposed to do? Take two to a bed?"
Harry Potter thought of it as the day his parents died.
When Malfoy says stuff like that, Harry needs to be able to see his face. He fumbles for the loose end of the invisibility cloak.
“Yes.” Draco’s voice was rising. “Because you were always good at gobstones, and he remembered that!”
himself, when Draco wasn’t—when Draco wasn’t—
section of the library, kept dusty on the second floor. Potter would open to the middle of a book, or sometimes the end, and make a face before either putting it under his arm or back on the shelf. He still had about half the stack of folklore books to work through, by Draco’s estimation, but that didn’t seem to stop him from amassing another unwieldy stack.
, short and sharp. It was all so bizarre.
“Then why do you want him to join?”
“Untrue,” Malfoy says. Harry fights down a frankly astonishing wave of jealousy. “I’ve been seeing this utter prat since September, you know, but I assumed we were over when he said he wouldn’t care if I never came back from my family’s evil lair.”
“Are you coming to classes again?” Potter repeated.
Ginny Weasley looked entirely too awake for nearly three in the morning, her smile blinding when she craned her head upwards to assess the damage and said, “And here I thought you were doing some normal rule-breaking, Harry. Have you lot been at this all night?”
Potter was outright grinning, now. “Sure, Malfoy.”
“—galling, actually,” Draco found himself saying, agitated energy causing him to pace in a narrow ellipse in front of the large tree Potter eventually sat under. “The Dark Lord killed a half-dozen wandmakers when it was
“Don’t fall,” Potter warned, a hand catching Draco’s outstretched knee, steadying him; Draco felt the heat of Potter’s palm through his trousers like Fiendfyre seeking something to destroy, when he said, “I won’t.”
, Draco thought, chest twisting up terribly. He knocked into his bed post as he scrambled out of his sheets, freezing when Theo, already up and dressed, gave him a suspicious look as he swept out of the dorm.
“You know we’re not done, right?” Creevey shot back, hanging over the side of the spiraling staircase in a manner that was going to give him head trauma. But he was grinning, and with a start, Draco realized that it was the first time he’d seen Creevey smile since they met.
Baddock appeared to realize this at the same moment, because he cast a narrow look over his shoulder. Being on the run had given his previously nervous visage a hardness that few people knew how to deal with, and this combined with his burlier form—possibly related to being on the run, possibly a side-effect of puberty—meant that those onlookers were soon directing their attention elsewhere.
On the ground in front of him, he’d placed Draco’s hawthorn wand. Draco sank into a sprawl opposite Potter, the wand between them.
Draco didn’t waste his breath denying it. He said only, “I don’t have a blood tie to the Hogwarts wards, you know,” to which Astoria gave a little frown and said, in tones of deep, theatrical disappointment, “Not even one? What is even the point of being one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight then, Draco?”
Potter looked shocked. “To see their son at school?”
Malfoy tilts his head slightly, jaw tightening. Grey eyes and pale lashes and a red mark at the side of his jaw from Harry’s teeth. His gaze prickles along Harry’s skin in a way that echoes that strange interlude where their mouths had come together mid-argument, that sudden, inevitable collision. The scrape of teeth along the column of a pale neck, blunt nails across bare skin, bitten lips moving in tandem. Harry’s mouth is still hot from it.
Already Draco was breaking his word, falling back into that old, worn pattern: he was being weird about Potter. Worse than before, quieter and more painfully, nights consumed by it. And he certainly wasn’t about to tell his mother about that, or even about the fact that he
He uncurled from his position on the armchair a few moments later, with a vague thought about a letter, or a script to follow when he inevitably encountered Potter; but the thought made his head pound relentlessly. Possibly it was stress. Possibly it was because it was half past two in the morning. Possibly Draco was dehydrated.
