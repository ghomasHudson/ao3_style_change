The second tattoo he gave was to George, about a month after the war.  Then, matching ones for Ron and Hermione; an entire mural on Luna’s back; a sleeve for Dean, and one for Seamus; one of Lavender’s shoulder blades; and Charlie, and Bill, and eventually there were enough people interested to warrant opening a small shop and studio in Diagon Alley.
Draco was excited to explore Killarney for the afternoon, as the castle and boat ride were the only excursions for the day.
Draco couldn’t get comfortable.

to Draco and his senses. He had never really given it much thought, honestly.)
He really shouldn’t have worried about it.
But Draco just shook his head, smile exasperated, and huffed a little laugh. Harry felt immensely pleased with himself, even though he tried to tell himself he didn’t.
It is not Voldemort he remembers in the Great Hall, after everything has ended; it is the Malfoys.  Without hesitation he draws them, achingly awkward and so grateful to have survived, to be together.  He draws the Weasleys as they mourn Fred, draws the still faces of Tonks and Remus through his tears, sketches the scenes of life and death that litter the Great Hall in the aftermath, the little tableaux each family creates.
Cardiff Castle was a bit of a disappointment, if Draco were being honest, but most Muggle castles were, after having spent his formative years in both Malfoy Manor and Hogwarts. Even Harry had seemed a bit blasé about the whole thing, although he became animated when they reached the library, for reasons Draco couldn’t quite understand beyond it being the set of some Muggle programme or another.
else.
before said trip. “We should head to Cardiff after work on Friday, experience some Muggle nightlife, visit Cardiff Castle or something on the Saturday. You know, a nice little mini-vacation before our trip!”
Draco would admit to himself, that he holds some small,
“We’ll grab pasties for breakfast once we get to the pick-up point,” Harry explained, as the cab sped through central Cardiff. “There’ll probably be a Gregg’s nearby. There’s one around every corner here, from the looks of it.” Harry hesitated. “We need to be at the pick-up point by eight a.m., and I thought we should be early—the company said they wait if they arrive early, but if they don’t have to wait for us, we can be on the road faster, right?”

“Don’t forget that we’ve got a day in Waterford on our way back.”
to all these people he didn’t know.
Rather than attempt to find other attractions in Cardiff, Harry suggested a train trip to Bath (“Muggle trip,” he’d said when Draco had asked why they couldn’t simply apparate; what a prat).
They moved into a cozy flat not too far from St. Mungo’s, where Harry was due to start a year of full-time placement, but still within a comfortable apparition for Draco, who was continuing on with his specialization in Mind Healing. It’s on the third floor of a somewhat small apartment complex, has an en suite off the master bedroom, a second bedroom, a second toilet with a shower, and an open concept kitchen-living-dining space.
The women seated next to them on the coach almost certainly noticed the difficulty Draco had sitting, but they did nothing but wink and giggle. Draco responded with a smug smirk while Harry tried not to blush. This was worse than being teased about concierge condoms.
. Like, not to put too fine a point on it, but he and Harry were the youngest there by a solid 40 years, at the least.

Eventually the coach pulled into a small park with an overlook. There was another coach parked nearby, and a bus-load of tourists were already spread about the area, taking photos and pointing out different views. Draco immediately pulled Harry away from the rest of their group, heading to explore as much as possible during their twenty-minute stop.
One week vacation with Draco, Muggle-style.
Draco patted Harry’s shoulder consolingly, trying not to laugh at his boyfriend.
Draco was grateful. His ass needed the rest.
Harry smiled at Draco while Maude and Elin laughed at them again.
“Yes, yes,” Draco shooed him away. “If you don’t hurry up you won’t reach your kissing stone before we have to go.”
Once their group had looked its fill, and the time they’d been given was up, their driver led them to a hired boat for the main excursion of the morning—a tour of the lake by boat, passing by Innisfallen Island and its ruined abbey, as well as the other islands.
Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter, the two youngest passengers on this bus, the couple celebrating their anniversary, were going to bed before midnight and had not had sex once since their vacation began.
“We’re here, love,” Harry murmured, as though Draco couldn’t see everyone getting off the coach and collecting their luggage from the driver. What a dope. Draco loved him.
“Call the front desk and see if they sell any. They sell toothbrushes, they should sell condoms. We can even have them charged to the room and settle it tomorrow.”
There wasn’t a Gregg’s, but there was a Costa, so Draco was able to get his caffeine fix and breakfast. Harry also bought a few odds and ends from the pastry display, claiming that they were “for the road,” even as he promised that there would likely be a stop before they left Wales.
HPDMHPDMHPDMHPDM
Harry was right about there being a stop before too long.
“As if,” Draco snorted and Harry made an indignant noise. “Potter here fell asleep before we could do much more than undress.”
“—Because you are the only swot I know who prefers green highlighters.”
,” Draco mused as they departed the castle.
After the Death Eater trials, where he had spoken for and against various Death Eaters, where he had testified for Draco and Narcissa Malfoy, where he had testified against Snatchers and Ministry Officials, and Dolores Umbridge and Crabbes and Goyles and Notts and Lestranges; where he had talked and talked and

“And, a few years later, when I saw him at school again after a long break, I realised that he was funny and I wanted to snog him.  When I told my best friend, she told me that she was ‘glad I finally realised I was a huge bisexual disaster and
Draco rolled his eyes, harrumphing. “Sap,” he sneered.

In fifth year, all Harry’s drawings were in shades of black, from the dark greys of thunderstorm clouds to the deepest black of moonless midnights.  There was no light that year, no colour—not even the burnt russet of dried blood or the shocking vibrancy of fresh blood.  Despite the lack of colour, there was no lack of experimentation—Harry tried to capture the magic around him in quill-strokes and charm work, bringing sections of the castle alive on his parchment, capturing the movements of the stars above the astronomy tower, the clouds shifting over the Quidditch pitch, the tentacles of the Giant Squid waving from the depths of the Black Lake.

Potter did not bother to respond, but he did make a point of taking Draco to an ‘M&S’ (a shop of some sort that sold both produce and clothing, with a big, green

“It really is spectacular, isn’t it, Harry?” Draco’s voice was awed.
“It won’t work for other EU countries, but because of how magical Ireland is, there’s documentation I can get you to show at the border so they let you back in. I’ve picked your destination for you; you need to sort out the rest yourself.” And she sounds just like she did back at Hogwarts, when she wouldn’t let him and Ron copy her homework, but would do all their corrections on their drafts.

be the complete pillock Draco knows him to be. But Draco would never, ever, say anything of the sort out loud.
The last thing they did before taking the train back to Cardiff was to explore the Royal Crescent. While Draco wasn’t overwhelmed by the size or age of the buildings, there was something to be said for the way they sat imposingly on the hill, and the way they formed the crescent they were named for.

“No, Malfoy,

The people around them cheer—then begin hooting and hollering when Draco yanks Harry up into a quick, but passionate, snog.
They each had a scoop of Irish Cream gelato after dinner and picked up some supplies from the chemist.
“There’s no need, and there isn’t really much that can be done, anyway. With a circle as stable as this one, attempting anything may actually cause harm—wizards are only meant to harness the wild magic of a stone circle when in dire need or when the magic needs to be released and rebalanced. That’s why there are so many in Ireland, you know. It isn’t simply because there's more magic on the island; it's because there have been many times of great need.”

His first tattoo, the first one he gets, the first one he gives, is one and the same.  The pain is more than the scraping of quill on flesh, less than the drawn out pain of a Blood Quill, less by far than the
“How long have you two been married?” asks one of the older gentleman that Harry doesn’t know very well.  His name might be Brian?
For Muggles, it probably wasn’t much—a feat of engineering, another thing to discuss in a history class or as proof of alien or divine intervention. But for Harry and Draco, for those who used magic or felt magic or
magic, the circle was alive. The air vibrated with wild magic, the earth lusher, the sky clearer, the stones stronger. It wasn’t a ley line, and it wasn’t Stonehenge, but it was, in many ways, better. Practically untouched when compared to more famous stone circles, the wild magic was peaceful and stable (as much as wild magic could be), likely protecting much of the area in undefinable ways.
, after all. “I’m not Draco,” he muttered to himself, “so I shouldn’t be fucking swearing in front of adults who are older than me.” Joyce and Dhillon burst out laughing.
“John and I weren’t really that young when we had Philip, you know. But he was certainly young when sweet Sara next door got pregnant. He never said he did it, of course, and I’m certain he didn’t—he’s always been gayer than a mayflower, you know, a mother can
It was during the summer following his fourth year at Hogwarts that magic started to bleed into Harry’s art.  The nightmares that kept him awake or screaming also found their way into his landscapes of Little Whining, images of darkness and masked figures and Voldemort and Cedric and gravestones and cauldrons and blackness and blood swirling through the fields and parks and cul-de-sacs.  Then came the dementor attack and the trial—and Harry was locked up in his room, drawing for hours and days and not sleeping and hardly eating, trying to get the images out of his head, to escape from this new reality, more terrifying than anything he had ever even imagined.
Draco made an affronted sound. Harry prepared himself for the now-memorised rant about how green highlighters are under-appreciated and neon yellow is not, under any circumstances, to be used to signify anything important in life—unless the only other option is neon orange, because neon orange can go fuck itself,

Draco jolted when they arrived in Waterford—he had spent the entire morning dozing and had fallen asleep just after they started through Tipperary. Harry nudged him as he shifted to allow Elin and Maude into the aisle.
It was their first excursion of the trip—Blarney Castle.
Harry could only sigh, because that was his birthday last year—they'd be celebrating their one-year anniversary in a month and Harry hadn’t even been certain they were dating.
“We're only here for an hour, and you want to spend the whole time in line behind a gaggle of Muggle tourists.” Draco sighed, exasperated. “Whatever, it’s your trip, too. I will explore the gardens and the rest of the castle while you have your fun tonguing a rock.”
or anything else he has suffered.  It is a small golden snitch on the inside of his wrist that flutters up and down his forearm and darts around his wrist, trailing stars and moons behind it.  His experience of drawing on himself allows him to capture it, display it, present it, as he wanted to.  The charms used to create its tail of stars, and to bring it to life, had tickled.
was what you called your preferred stationery store in the first place). “Never mind, that was a dumb question—”
Draco ignored him.
” card. There is simply no speeding up some forms of bureaucracy (and creating a real person from magic is one that tends to drag).
“Don’t worry, Draco! No rock will ever be able to kiss as well as you—or ever bring me as much luck.”
It isn’t until they are on the coach for the Ring of Kerry excursion that they realise it.
Draco actually managed to forget that he had been worried about this trip in the first place.
There is death, everywhere, and curses and blood and children.  Harry wants to capture the colours and sounds of the curses, simply so that they cannot hurt anyone else; he wants to lock them in parchment and ink and save everyone.
“M’kay,” Draco mumbled drowsily as he lurched into the aisle and toward the front of the coach. “Potter,” he began, as his lower back twinged with every step forward. “Next time I tell you to ‘fuck me until I can’t stand it anymore,’ please remember that I still need to be able to move again the next day. This has been hell, and I don’t know how I’ll feel tomorrow when the muscle pain really kicks in. I need to start exercising again—I used to be able to do squats for hours without feeling anything; now I can’t even ride your cock for twenty minutes without feeling the thigh burn for days. Is this what getting old is like?”
Harry begged Draco to deign to attend the evening’s performance, some sort of Spanish guitar
“Can’t argue with that.”
Harry isn’t sure if they were dating before they moved into a flat together after their training was done.
Potter quickly put paid to the idea when he admitted that, while he knew
Draco ensures that both he and Harry have the right week off work, and that is where his involvement in the trip planning ends.
That peace didn’t last long.
Really, there wasn’t any particular reason to be suspicious, Draco knew, except
“—magic, Harry, you fuckwit, it’s magic in the air, we talked about it earlier at the circle.”
So, Harry decides, they will do a coach trip, and it doesn’t even matter where it departs from. As long as they can get two seats and a double bed, they are set, as far as Harry is concerned.
“It was a bit of an awakening, actually,” she told Harry (and Draco, who was paying rapt attention even as he looked out the window).  “I had never seen sexuality and sensuality displayed like that before.  I was raised in a time and with a family where you didn’t talk, or even really think, about sex.  You had children and they helped on the farm.  That was that.
The check-in procedure wasn’t actually very difficult, and they were spending an evening in a small, historic hotel, so they didn’t have to compete with any other tour groups for service.
A brewery tour and tasting before dinner might not have been the responsible choice, but Harry stood by their decision. Besides, they ate enough at dinner, joining another pair from their group, Joyce and Dhillon, to make up for any real drunkenness.
This was all Potter’s fault.
DMHPDMHPDMHPDMHP
“I’m not getting condoms from a hotel front desk! And I don’t want to be seen by any of the old ladies when I pick them up there or settle the tab tomorrow.”
They arrived in Killarney by mid-afternoon and checked into their hotel. This hotel, unlike the historic one in Waterford, was bustling with people and they easily spotted three other coaches in the lot.
“It is,” Harry agreed.
“Yeah, alright, you posh wanker, you don’t snore. But what about the gills?” And Harry, unlike Draco, can’t get the words out without bursting into raucous laughter, joined by the women at the table with them.
“Draco, love, I promised you a big thing six years ago, and I swear to you, I will do it.”
Their room once again had twin beds.
“This year, since the Eighth Year students have the ability and the right to leave Hogwarts grounds at their own discretion, our main assignment of this course will be that you and your partner explore Muggle culture and history by completing practical research. Each pair is required to complete two trips per term to different Muggle areas, and submit papers (not two feet of parchment, as Draco was used to, but, five to ten Muggle A4 sheets) detailing the experience. Each partner is required to select one destination per term and write up a proposal for myself, and their partner, for
This was entirely Potter’s fault. Merlin save him from speccy gits.
Draco actually found Bath to be enchanting, and not only because he led Harry to the Wizarding baths and marketplace. There was something about being somewhere both historic and intrinsically magical. (Whether the Muggles were right about the healing properties of the baths, any location where humans believed that fiercely in its inherent magic seemed to
Rather than the double or king he’d been expecting, Harry opened the door to a room with two small twin beds, separated by a hardwood nightstand.
Harry chuckled, nodding to Draco seriously despite his amusement. “Should we do anything while we’re here?” It was Harry’s first time being this close to a stone circle, or at least one like this. Their whole Muggle Studies class in Eighth Year had been asked to meet at Stonehenge for the Summer Solstice, to watch the spectacle, even though they would have already completed the term. Almost all of them had been there.
“How does that all fit in there?” She muttered to herself. “Dobby, give me my mail.”
"Second—to Miss Hermione Granger...for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.”
Fascinated, she stroked the owl’s feathers and it hooted happily, nibbling her fingers lightly before flying out the window. She watched it go, mesmerized. Like her, it was affectionate with food.
“George!” She whispered into the older boy’s ear. It was not surprise that he was sleeping in the spare bed in the dorm room
“Are you still dying of hypothermia or…?” Ben asked from the desk. He was staring out the window anxiously and periodicially checking on her and his watch.
Malfoy—Draco Malfoy, of Slytherin house, of the platinum blonde—was a violent shade of redhead.
He whimpered, but followed, unable to think of any way he could get out of this.
He nodded, “Yes. We were…friends…”
She decided to get out of there as soon as possible.
"Yes, Neville, go to Professor McGonagall!" Hermione urged Neville. "Report him!"
That was the first unbelievable thing that had happened that summer. It led to Mary walking her through the workings of a bank, which were much more complex than the wizarding banks. She walked her through how to withdraw, and how to make cards and handle such things. She had to explain several different times but Persephone thought she got it by the fourth time.
Persephone sputtered, “But your hair…”
“Breath taking?” He tried to joke, making a delicate gesture with his hands. It dropped halfway through it, as if he were too weak to go through with whatever stupid thing he had tried. “Thank you.”
“You are an actress! Act happy!” He told her. “Don’t make the audience believe it! Make yourself believe it! Deep breath and restart.”
Persephone had been in the Restricted Section before, both with permission and without. She hadn’t gotten too deep either times, knowing the rumours that circulated about going in too deep. There was no age line keeping underage students from entering the section, so really, it was the school’s fault for any student that went in without permission.
“Like a nightingale,” She smirked.
“Merry Christmas,” He mumbled, getting up.
Susan giggled suddenly, “Oh, he’s such an amazing wizard! I cannot believe you haven’t ever heard of him!”
“I seriously haven’t slept in so long,” Susan said. “And I’m barely in the play. It’s so stressful.”
It was true—Malfoy was the biggest talked of all the first years. He often complained loudly about first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping non-magical people in helicopters. He was very disappointed with the rule placed that no first years were allowed their own broomsticks—apparently the rule was fairly new, barely three decades old. But, then again, he wasn't the only one who thought the rule was unfair: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he'd spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who'd listen about the time he'd almost hit a hang glider on Charlie's old broom.
The second to last was two sweaters, one in burgundy with the letter ‘P’ on it, and another green one, with the letter ‘L’ on it. With it came a large box of fudge. Confused, but overjoyed, she took the sweaters and fudge and the last gift, a very light one, to go to Ron. She wanted to be there when he opened her gift from her. She was sure he was not up yet, and she was right.
"The forest?" he repeated, and he didn't sound quite as cool as usual. "We can't go in there at night—there's all sorts of things in there—werewolves, I heard."
Persephone nodded, “I just hope I’m not in the class with the Slytherins.” She grimaced. “Humiliating myself, being sweaty and clumsy in one class for the next five years with either Draco or Pansy—or worse, both—would be the worst case scenario.”
“Oh please, don’t be self-centered,” He said but she could tell there was a nervous edge to his tone.
“Signed photos? You’re giving out signed photos, Potter?”
"Do you not see that unicorn?" Firenze bellowed at Bane. "Do you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must."
“What people?”
Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind her.
“It’s not much,” Ron said as they all got out, a slight undertone of embarrassment in his voice.
They were alone—and he was standing closer than usual. And the hammering in her chest wasn’t all due to fear, she didn’t think. She didn’t like the feeling.
“What is that?” One of the twins asked, while pointing at Persephone’s lightning scar that was clearly visible now.
She came upon a corner and looked up at the streets signs—she was in what was called Knockturn Alley.
"Weird!" he said, “What a shape! This is money?"
cute,
Diana handed him her phone and he frantically typed something in. Diana and Persephone stared at each other with questioning eyes, before he groaned, “Nooooo!” He looked up and looked at Persephone. “Percy Jackson isn’t playing anymore in London!”
"Well, I don' s'pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that...let's see...he borrowed Fluffy from me...then some o' the teachers did enchantments...Professor Sprout—Professor Flitwick—Professor McGonagall—" he ticked them off on his fingers, "Professor Quirrell—” Persephone perked up and shot Ron a look. “an' Dumbledore himself did somethin', o' course. Hang on, I've forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor Snape."
, she thought.
On Friday, during their ten minute break, she, Hermione and Ron took an impulsively regrettable walk out on in the courtyard. It was freezing and she yet to get herself a new scarf, as her original scarf had been burnt in the bathroom. Persephone held up an empty jar jam and Hermione conjured some blue fire in it. They shuddered in relief at the warmth.
There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. She bit back a smile as she complied. Ron muttered, “If you were in Slytherin, he’d give you fifty points, probably.” She nodded seriously.
"Found the perfect place!" he said. "Come on! Everyone out!"
Ben's eyes widened, “Sounds…like it should be a Weasley special.”
Everyone was situated in the car—Fred, Percy, Ron, Persephone and George all in the back, in that order. Persephone sat next to George, laying her head on his shoulder almost immediately—she was ready to pass out from her sleepless night. She’d been worrying all night about Hades or Ben or Obi-Wan or whatever.
"Er, no, Sephie, ye’ll come with me an Hermione.” Persephone clenched her jaw. She would find the boy in the forest, alone or not, and she would have him to herself no matter what Hagrid or anyone said. “Draco, Neville and Fang’ll go one way and we’ll do the other. Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we'll send up green sparks, right? Get yer wands out an' practice now—that's it—an' if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an' we'll all come an' find yeh—so, be careful—let's go."
“Huh…”Ron squinted at them, before his mouth popped open, “They look—yeah! They’re keys! Winged keys, you see?” He pointed.
Hades Black looked at her only for a millisecond but his eyes begged her not to say anything so she nodded in his direction, but couldn’t help saying, “Nephew?”
“She was a Roman goddess of wisdom and warfare,” Persephone said on cue. The three boys looked at her while the cat struggled against the collar. “She was an Olympian,”
It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout.
Climbing quite like an expert, the cat clawed her way over onto her shoulder, around her neck, and Persephone looked at the boy in help.  “No! No, Minnie, no!” The boy gasped, “Oh my god, oh my god, okay, hold on—MINERVA!” The cat didn’t seem to care, still being on Persephone’s back.
Cedric Diggory, another full moon, Diagon Alley and a strange encounter with a strange piece of jewelry...
She jumped at the loud sound but then jumped up, trying to shush the owl by hand gestures. She looked around, seeing no was around and when she looked back to the owl she gasped. The one owl had now two companions, all holding the same envelope in the same manner.
The boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose. Persephone bit back an embarrassed smile for him. How sweet.
“The water wasn’t there because…I was supposed to use the solidification spell, wasn’t I?” She nodded to herself, flushing. “And I will probably be losing marks, right?”
“Wonder what that was about?” Lavender raised a brow at Persephone. She shrugged. “Is that a letter from a secret admirer, Lily?”
It was all coincidences. Simple as that. He was looking for connections—and he found simple ones. And who was to say he wasn’t lying about the wand core story? When would he have even gotten a strand of her hair anyway? It was completely insane. It made no sense to even entertain the thought.
“Oh.”
"Well, why not?"
“Okay, this doesn’t really count because we didn’t enchant it and we’re borrowing it, so.” He said quickly. “But doing magic in front of those Muggles you live with—”
"Of course," Quirrell said coolly. "And he was furious for it, too. ‘
"Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn't see you there."
Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his, obviously not expecting this to have happened.
“Not going,” He grumbled.
She needed to get some food that she made herself but she had no idea where the kitchens were. She asked Ron, who shrugged, and she decided against asking the twins. She didn’t want to cash in her favor just yet. She sought out Susan Bones, her Hufflepuff friend, and Susan was happy to help.
“Hermione…?”
“Come on now—round them up, round them up, they’re only pixies,” Lockhart shouted, as he inched away, towards the back door.
"True, I haven't introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts." Before thinking twice, she choked—the magician’s school? Was this what this was—he certainly did not look like a magician… He held out an enormous hand and she checked it for a wand. She raised a brow, offering her own hand and he just about shook her arm out of its socket. "What about that tea then, eh?" he said, rubbing his hands together. "I'd not say no ter summat stronger if yeh've got it, mind."
“That’s terrible! Are there no dragon abuse laws?” Persephone inquired. Ron gave her a side glance.
She frowned into his shoulder, “That was fast—were-wolf speed?”
“Now, now,” He said, reaching out to grasp her shoulder. She looked down at it, thinking about whether or not biting it off her was such a good idea.
“We’ll have to buy some more today, Arthur,” Mrs. Weasley sighed, peering down into the flowerpot she had took off the kitchen mantelpiece. “Guests first! After you, Persephone!”
“Who cares?! Renee’s birthday is tomorrow, at exactly eleven am, and we are staying up!” Parvati exclaimed.
“The feather has already chosen you so no, no other wand,” Ben said blankly, shrugging.
Now having stood, she saw a clear point of the lake. Something small was sliding on it. She squinted, moving to the side to see before suddenly, George tackled her to the floor as several snowballs passed over their shelter.
“Alright!” She raised her fist just as the door opened. Filch was standing on the other side and behind him, Snape was flinching, holding his robes over his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Snape had bandages in his hands, muttering something about, “…you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads…”
“Like me?” She said out dumbly.
She scoffed, “Unfortunately,” She shook her head, “Twice, just earlier. And a few girls too. I’ll be lucky I don’t ever meet him again—whatever house he’s in, I won’t be happy to be in it.”
“Well, how well has that panned out for you now?”
Finally, when she was called in, she took a deep breath and checked her watch.
She didn’t know why Daphne had a crush on Hades, honestly. He was so annoying. He didn’t deserve to be tall, it only made him more annoying and smug. It probably fueled his ego too. And had he ever heard of a comb?
“Right,” He sounded like he was holding laughter. She bit back her smile.
She turned, her pointed witch’s hat on full display, and started to walk farther into the castle. The first years made no mistake in immediately following, obviously having acquired the same vibe off her as Persephone had.
“What
“Nosy, nosy, nosy…” He muttered in great disdain. “Have you not grasped it yet? That Lord Voldemort is the most powerful wizard of all? He needs not a wand—”
Ah! So much to unpack in this chapter! Let me know what you think!
“I’m starving,” She complained to Cedric while they were on break while Flitwick talked to the stage manager about the background lights.
Persephone gaped at her, “But—”
“I…don’t understand.” She stared at the seeds. “Do I plant them? What about my wand core?”
"Don' mention it," said Hagrid gruffly. "Don' expect you've had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now—only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand."
Suddenly, he writhed against the chains and sucking in air as if he were in pain. “Agh! God, holy moly of god!” He hissed. “Okay—so your name is Persephone. What’s up with that?”
“Busy time at the Ministry, I hear,” Mr. Malfoy said. She backed away quickly, not taking her eyes of Hades. “Certainly keeping you busy, with all those raids…I do hope they are paying you overtime.” He smirked knowingly and Persephone felt her hand ball into a fist.
"Kept outta trouble, though, that's somethin'," said Hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Lily.
Persephone heard a wave of hushed chatter as she stepped forward.
“I hope not,” She said, placing her hands out in front of her, leaning on them.
Persephone paled.
“Yes, I do!” She snapped, turning and continuing. Thankfully, he thought better than to follow.
“Oh, no, you don’t have to—”
He stared at her openly, “And your worst day was the twenty-second, right? The night of the full moon.”
She seethed to herself, fuming. She was sure there was steam coming out of her ears she was so annoyed.
. “Ugh, it’s not working!”
He was prepared, “A favor.”
"Now, there's another player on each side who's called the Keeper—I'm Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring."
As she worried about this, a familiar name was called, “Weasley, Gareth!”
boy—she could find a different way to grow her stupid wand. Maybe she could just ask Hagrid about it—she was very sure that his umbrella is a wand rebuilt so why not?
Persephone noticed that Susan was in some ways like Neville—terrified of a specific Slytherin. Susan was not so much terrified as she was unwilling to put Pansy in her place. Persephone knew it was wrong to do so, but she stood with Susan.
Hermione hesitated, before she stepped forward, crouching with Persephone. She tore a piece of parchment from her roll and, using a pen, she wrote down the name, Marie. “We’re not supposed to have pens,” Persephone commented.
She thought about waking Ron and the twins up—who better than to share this first planned act of breaking rules than her best friend and the best rule-breakers in all of Hogwarts?—but then again, she was under her
Persephone jumped, looking at Ron. He shrugged, “Gary. Youngest brother. He’s been talking about you all summer.”
But it was easy—she was sure it would be easy without the robes, but it was liberating to be up in the air, on the broom. She could feel her hair move with her, as if it were floating too. As she rose higher, higher than even Malfoy, she could hear the gasps and screams from the girls below and one long whoop from Ron.
It was a clear morning. The short carriage ride would take them to Hogsmeade, where they would head into the Hogsmeade Post Office. It was a building that housed at least two-hundred to three-hundred owls, ranging from Great Grey Owls to tiny Scops, the latter for local deliveries only. They were all nestled on colour-coded shelves, the colour based on how quickly they will arrive to where they needed to go. In the back of the shop, in the privacy of a back room, there were several fireplaces connected to the Floo Network.
“I’m the student representation of the hospital wing,” He showed her a pin stuck to his robes in hands. It had a little Hermes staff on it. “How do you not know this? I was the one who took care of those wounds last year?”
“Oh, no, no, no! Don’t chicken out now because you’re the siren!” George called out, wiping hair out of his face.
"Load of old tosh," said Uncle Vernon. Persephone barely registered his voice as her heart sunk—her parents, just like her, who never abandoned her but only—but were murdered instead. She stared into the air, unable to do much but pull in breaths.
She jumped up picking Minnie up and placing her in between her legs as she crossed them. She sorted through them, surprised to find some presents from some of the Slytherin girls she was friends with—she was glad she thought to get them presents as well, though she wasn’t surprised to find no present from Pansy.
“Excellent!” Fred and George said together.
"Don' you worry, Sephie. You'll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you'll be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it's hard. Yeh've been singled out, an' that's always hard. But yeh'll have a great time at Hogwarts—I did—still do, 'smatter of fact."
"Famous witches and wizards. I've got about five hundred, but I haven't got Agrippa or Ptolemy." He leaned in to look at her card. “Who’d you get?”
She narrowed her eyes, “Oh, then I suppose we are headed the same direction.”
her!”
She would never say it out loud for fear that Oliver Wood would feel someone saying something remotely negative about Quidditch and hunt her down, foaming at the mouth—but she was almost glad Quidditch for the Gryffindor team was done for the year. They would play after the winter holidays and for this, Oliver let them off. She had to assume it was because he had OWLS to study for.
“As much as I know, sorry,” He said, staring at her. Annoyance overcame her and a feral instinct moved her to twist his hand, which was still in hers, to pull him close where she lifted her leg up and around his neck, pulling him down into the water. She pushed his head down for half a second until he overpowered her by raising them both up out of the water, her on his back. Before she could try again, he had already rushed them away from the shore and onto the grass.
“Fine,” She told him. “Now, can you help?”
This is what she told herself every time she saw Ben—she knew he wouldn’t talk to her about this around others so she made it her goal to keep herself around Cedric. He didn’t mind, more so he seemed relieved she wasn’t upset over his assumptions.
Persephone Potter?"
She felt her heart lighten. That was good, right? That he was asking her questions rather than shutting her down immediately. “In Slytherin. I believe that I belong in Slytherin house. The sorting hat nearly put me in it—”
Persephone thought that the older girls were probably to move on to the next and final round, as they had more experience. Then it was only a question of which of the three second year girls would move on.
"Oh, right!" Hermione gasped and she did a quick job of bringing her wand out, waving it with the words Persephone could not hear but could see its effect of bluebell flames she had used on Snape, this time directed to the plant. This with the fire that was simmering from Persephone skin managed to have the plant unravel itself from the redheads.
He was thoughtful, “Do you truly believe that?” She was silent. She shrugged. He nodded thoughtfully. “Now, the happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is.”
"Thirty-nine, sweetums," Aunt Petunia said quickly.
“We did.”
She sighed, opening her eyes as she sat on the bench and immediately, she spotted two enormous green eyes staring at her. She gasped.
Persephone, now having just been trapped into a stranger girl’s compartment, tried to say something but the girl had closed the compartment door.
“None? That’s what we thought.” Fred closed off.
"I—don't—want—” Percy tried to say thickly, but the twins forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew.
“…right…” He nodded.
“I would be careful, Miss Potter,” He said lowly, making her look at him in surprise. “Who you make such loyal ties with.” He said nothing more, sweeping away into his classroom.
"And that's where..."
“Did you really?” Mr. Weasley asked eagerly, “Tell me—are there escapators down there? Tell me precisely—”
“Right, okay,” He nodded. “Gryffindors are rule-breakers, you know.”
"You do it, then, if you're so clever," Ron snarled.
Persephone, too, would be attending a school away. From Dudley, at least. For the first time in her life, she wouldn't be in classes with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon's old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Persephone, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny, taunting her with the promises of having her head down a toilet faster than she could walk into her first class. She’d been quick to reply that the toilet would already be flooded with his fat head and she ran away.
“I barely read the first part—my head’s killing me.” He groaned. “Do what you want with it.”
She had no real reason to know of the potion—not really. She was simply intrigued by potion making—the perfumes of the possible outcomes intoxicated Persephone in a way no other magic could. It was so fascinating—perhaps it was because there was barely any wand magic involved, which served her purpose well, but it was fascinating. The simplest of mistakes could cause fatal results. The idea excited her.
“Er, you know Fred and George?” He asked. She nodded. “We…talk.”
"How about a demonstration, boy? When I blow my whistle, you will kick off from the ground, hard," Madam Hooch said, nodding at him. He trembled—in
“We’ll be voting for him in a few years,” Ron said. “For when he decides to run for Minister of Magic.”
“Well hurry!” Ron snarled, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck. He tried reaching for Persephone, who was trying hard to find some sort of way to bite the plant off her to scream to Hermione that she just needed light, dammit.
She glared up at him and he pursed his lips, “Fish legs.”
Hagrid's chest swelled at these last words. Persephone and Ron beamed at Hermione.
“Lily,” Two voices behind them said. “A seeker!”
She tossed the book aside. No. No it was
They looked at each other, the girl hummed, smiling like she was coming from a faraway dream. Persephone tried speaking, “Do you want your blanket back?”
“Does Dumbledore know?”
“Get on!?” He was scandalized. “And what? Break the rules? Break my neck? No, that would be terribly irresponsible behavior from a prefect!”
The Weasley twins were back in the action of it and quickly declared snow war on the other students in the lawns who were enjoying the fresh snow. They quickly found Persephone while Susan ran for Hannah, as it seemed that the teams were separated by house. Persephone had to remove her mittens to make snowballs as the Weasley twins started digging, creating a little nook for them to take cover in as the Slytherin started firing at the Ravenclaws. Several older Gryffindor came to their assistance, taking cover and massacring more of the Slytherins than any other house.
The pain worsened and it felt very realistically like her eyeballs were being tugged out of her head. They felt so hot right now—she would start crying if she could. It was dark—black. She couldn’t open her eyes, everything stung her eyes. Even the air!
“Ah,” Daphne laughed, “Of course. That makes sense.”
"Not if you don't give us away, Peeves, please."
“Mind escorting our dear Lily to the Gryffindor common room then?” Fred asked and George shot him a look that Persephone missed. “We would but we’re meeting Lee and we’re already late.”
"I bet I’m a Hufflepuff…”
"Peeves," Percy whispered to the first years. "A poltergeist." He raised his voice, "Peeves—show yourself."
They ate Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns. They changed out of their robes and Persephone pulled on one of her new sundresses. It made her look nice, the green sundress against the red of her hair.
Then she pulled out the diadem.
The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.
"Help yourself," She told him, still tilting the card back and forward. "In the non-magical world, photos are, you know, still and…non-moving. And just a picture.”
He nodded enthusiastically, “I know. Last one ended up lasting five days. America participated with Brankovitch the third as their captain, which he is known to be the best in American history, right? But they didn’t make it close to getting into the finals—Canada ended up beating Scotland 270 to 240. It was…incredible.” He flushed once more and cringed, “Sorry, I’m…I’m rambling.”
“I’m with the Weasleys until school. We got separated—Floo powder,” Persephone explained, looking around. “I ought to go find them. We’re meeting Hermione here as well.”
“Oh, hey!” Cedric called, waving at her before immediately being hit by the Quaffle. Poor Cedric. “Lily, good morning!”
“Only American in Hogwarts, mate,” George sighed, leaning against the wall, his hands on his knees as he recovered. “Haven’t seen you in class though.”
His twin took a seat on her other side, “Persephone’s a no brainer.”
"No!" Hermione Granger shouted. "Madam Hooch told us not to move—you'll get us all into trouble. Besides, you don’t even know how to fly! You saw what happened to Neville, you won’t last five seconds!"
He raised both eyebrows at her sudden emotional outburst, and responded with a calmer voice, “Ancient magic is uncontrollable, unpredictable and has a history of killing its practitioners.”
“Look who’s talking,” She exclaimed, gesturing to the car.
She started to seriously feel her shoulders crumple and unbelieving weight on her chest, as if something had tightened around her heart and made it impossible for her to breathe—she started shaking, biting on her lip, hoping to God she wouldn’t cry when—“Pardon me, dear, are you having trouble getting onto the platform?”
Persephone smiled nervously, passing her in smiles. Mrs. Weasley patted her hair once before turning to her sons once more, “So.”
"An' here's our young Effie!" said the giant. Persephone looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile. She probably should have been scared but no one had ever called her by that sort of variation of her name, so she stared up at him, stunned. "Las' time I saw you, you was only a baby," the giant exclaimed. "Don’t mind that I call yeh Effie, do ya’? Could go fer Percy (Persie?), yer already know Persephone’s such a mouthful. Yeh look just like yer mum, but you got both yer dad’s and mum’s eyes too."
"Lily!"
He was silent for a long time that she thought he had disappeared again. When he spoke, she was surprised, “If…if you wanna know more…about it, the war…maybe you can meet my foster mom? She fought in it—both my foster parents did…maybe it would help you with…whatever you’re going through…” He was uncertain with his words, wondering if she could hear them.
She was still glaring at Malfoy, who’d stared around the compartment—his friends were puffing their chests out, ready for when he’d make a call for them to throw a punch, and the tall boy followed her gaze, “Oh, hey, yeah sorry ‘bout that, mate.” He grinned, offering Malfoy his hand but Malfoy ignored it, getting up and glaring at Persephone.
They shared a look. She waited and George said, “I don’t know think she’s ready just yet Freddie.”
ballet clothes. The other part of their relationship was saying that she needed a better haircut. Unbeknownst to her aunt, whenever she wanted it to, her hair grew longer after a haircut she didn’t particularly enjoy. It was one way she lived up to her what her namesakes symbolized—rebellion.
She walked to her bed and examined her legs. “You should go see Madame Pomfrey about this.” Hermione said, coming and sitting next to her.
“No—distracting?”
Persephone had completely forgotten the detention—the way she was being treated by most of the students truly felt like the worst of the situation. The worst of the situation was the detention, or this was as it felt.
“Well…I’m sure Slytherin aren’t all bad…” She muttered, looking away and gasping, “Oh Hagrid, can we go in there!” She pointed to what looked like a cosmetics and hair salon.
“Yes, like you are good at distracting, have you not noticed?” He asked. He wasn’t looking at her, “What about any lake or natural body of water?”
Snape looked up, his eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had none of Hagrid's warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.
He didn’t need to stare at her pleading face too long to finally allow her to go, with the promise of him staying on the spot. She took off happily, into the shop.
When they were far from him, they watched him stride off in the direction of the staffroom.
for something
“Not now, Arthur,” Mrs. Weasley interrupted. “Now, dear, it’s quite faster to travel by Floo powder but perhaps we should find—”
"What's the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?" Persephone asked.
She took a seat near the back, where the old computers were, right up against the air conditioners. She unpacked her laptop and set it up, waiting impatiently for it to start up. It wasn’t the fastest but it worked nicely enough.
“Find a magic mirror.” Persephone said, picking herself up from the floor.
“Oh my g—Persephone. Can you be cool? Just this once? Just be cool? Just this once?” He asked and Persephone laughed.
“You must not know. Snape was friends with your mother and I daresay the image you have haunts him guilty. A carbon copy of Lily Evans lurking in his classroom must have pushed him.”
Everyone was put into different groups and played out a scene and then was picked out of each group. Persephone was the Dorothy to Cedric Diggory’s
Ron believed her crazy when she told him she was skipping dinner to go back to the library that evening. He simply could not understand how someone could bare to be in such a quiet environment for so long.
“Oh,” She thought about that for a moment, remembering one of her original questions. “So—where
"Now what?" Aunt Petunia asked. Persephone was not ashamed in hoping that she would be left home alone. While she had very little books to read, all of which being textbooks on school subjects and how to repair things, Aunt Petunia had three bookshelves full of books of stories rather than informative books that she had quite literally forbad Persephone from even looking at. The only books that had stories written in them were the American story books of Percy Jackson that Diana let her read.
Persephone stiffened, “I—did I ki—”
He straightened, “Oh—oh okay, sorry—I just…he said he wanted to talk to you alone and I just thought…since you were joking when Patrick asked about who you like…”
Where to go? She stopped, thinking. Where could she go now that she couldn’t in the daylight, without the cloak? Hmm…
“No, its okay, I didn’t really know him…but the funeral is this Friday and I want you to come with me.” He raised a brow at her questioningly and feigned to lose eye contact with her.
Persephone, now crouching on her knees, looked up, her vision doubled, “I’m—I’m not a—Slytherin!” She gasped out.
"Never liked the name but only because of Luke from Percy Jackson."
A treasure that was never yours,
really helpful,” She smiled once more. “Kleptomaniac. Are you a kleptomaniac, Draco? Oh, or are you very forgetful?”
“Isn’t that…disrespectful?” She asked.
“But won’t they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door?”
“Aaaawww!” The girls all harmonized. “Lily’s got a crush!”
She stopped dead in her tracks when she noticed someone waiting for her. He was standing leaning against the shed, wearing a dark coat with a mauve scarf, staring over at her. When he caught her eye, he lifted his hand and waved a little Gryffindor flag. When she finally snickered, he smiled.
“Persephone?” Someone called, making her jump and the light in her fingers went out.
"We saw her scar! It’s really like lightning, mum! She even said so herself that she was, didn’t she?"
“Let me—”
“Ron,” Persephone smiled gently, putting her hand on his arm. “You’re my best friend.” She didn’t realize how much the words meant to her until she said them out loud. “You really are—and you’re much better a best friend than I could have ever hoped to have. You were never required to look passed my scar and history but you did and I will be forever grateful—and it means a lot more than you might think.” She coughed, trying not to get choked up. Gosh, when had she become such an emotional person? “And besides, I’m started to get very invested in the team and would like for you to help me master one of theirs moves—George is getting too big a head at practice so I need to beat him in that move.” She smiled before shaking him playfully, “Seriously Ron, your friendship means more to me than some present!”
Even more confused, she looked at him in question but then glanced down to find the dishes in front of her were now piled with food. She had never seen so many things to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, mashed potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.
Professor McGonagall started to quicken—she was sweeping along without even looking at her. She had to now jog to keep up, up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, without either of them saying a thing. She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Persephone trotting miserably behind her.
Maybe this helped, or maybe he wanted to help, but it did help.
Persephone ignored him, “Firenze saved me but he should not have done so because he interfered with my being killed by Voldemort—it must be written in the stars that I will be murdered by Voldemort. I escaped him once but the stars are there—and MARS IS BRIGHT WHICH MEANS WAR OR SOMETHING RIGHT!?”
It wasn’t a perfect façade of pretending she didn’t exist—Dudley was now so scared of Persephone, he’d taken to quite literally exiting the room in record times each time she walked into the room. She didn’t care much for it—she kept herself busy in her bedroom.
“Nothing, just didn’t know…”
Mrs. Weasley came right up to them, staring up at the boys with her hands on her hips, staring at each of their guilty faces. A wand stuck out of her flowered apron.
She snorted, “Vampires probably can read minds, he’d pick it out of my head in seconds.” She perked up. “This theory is becoming more realistic—”
“You know he was nearly pronounced a Squib?” Daphne asked. “What a terrible fate, don’t you agree?”
Persephone shook her head. She understood the game but now only could hope she could understand it on the field.
"Flew," Hagrid said as he tipped the boat back onto the water. "But we'll go back in this. Not s'pposed ter use magic now I've got yeh."
She felt a sudden satisfaction when she reached the water, feeling as though a layer of her skin fell off. She was ready to dive in when someone looped their hand around her arm, holding back. She hissed back at him and then covered her mouth, “Sorry!”
to get Snape’s attention—” Hermione’s tone suddenly became bitter.
“They can’t get back! That must be it!” Ron said finally, thirty minutes later. He had chewed on a candy Fred had left behind and that seemed to calm his nerves but when he had eaten it, he was panicked once more. “And if they had, Mum would have made dad leave the car! How are supposed to get to school? They don’t know we didn’t make it on!”
"I shall return when we are ready for you," Professor McGonagall said. "Please wait quietly."
Persephone listened to the conversation as she started piling dishes away in the sink, and carefully managing several things at once. Though magic was not allowed, technically, this was non-wand magic she was doing, so it didn’t really count. She made coffee while she carefully lowered the dessert from down on top of the fridge when she heard the crack. She nearly dropped the plate of dessert and only managed to slide it back onto the fridge.
She couldn’t explain the emotion she’d been feeling—she’d had it for years, every time she got less than what she expected to get on a test, or every time she couldn’t figure out a math problem, even after re-reading the instructions. When she forgot a name of the planets, or when she couldn’t for the life of her spell a word. It took a long moment, because she’d just had the best birthday in her life, but she felt it so dearly, that emotion, that sucking feeling.
"Good luck, Persephone Potter," Firenze said. "The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times."
Hermione nodded in agreement, before looking back down to the little alter. “What sort of shape is that sugar cookie?” She meant the snitch shaped sugar cookie.
“No, Cedric Diggory, of course!” Susan smiled dreamily. “Unless there is something going on with one of the twins?”
“Say the words I want to hear and the antidote is yours.”
“Er—hi…there,” Persephone said nervously, closing the door behind her.
She must have actually dozed off at some point, as it was much too warm and homey not to, because at some point, Ron shook her shoulder to wake her, "Nearly half-past eleven," Ron muttered, "we'd better go."
The club flew suddenly out of the troll's hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over—and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner's head. The troll swayed on the spot and before it could fall on Persephone, George was there, his hands hooked under her arms and he dragged her away, tripping but dragging her along, away from the spot she would have been killed upon. She’d fallen onto him, watching in horror as the troll fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.
“Anyway, Percy wouldn’t lend because apparently he’s got so many new friends to write to,” George said sarcastically. “Been acting very oddly all summer, hasn’t he? Sending lots of letters, never coming out of his room…I mean, there’s only so many times one can polish a prefect badge without breaking their hand off—you’re driving too far west, Fred,” he added, pointing at a compass on the dashboard. Fred twiddled the steering wheel.
"Stop putting words in his mouth, Ronald!" Hermione admonished her husband. "Ginny's got every right to do what she wants, especially since she's been working so hard for it!"
"I'm trying to find a compliment in there," Potter pouted, before he joined in the laughter. "But you're right, it'll be hilarious trying to dissect my mind, considering that I invented the entire process and I'm pretty much the poster boy for everything unusual."
Harry helped Hermione to put away the dishes after the early dinner (Ron had convinced her to take the Shepherd's Pie right back out), and being the opportunistic Auror that he was, he saw the opening to talk to her in private when her husband had to answer a Floo call.
"So?"
"I was the one who told her to go."
"Helen thinks... the pregnancy might be too unstable at this point, and that Ginny might go into labor any time soon. No guarantee yet of what that might mean..."
: Sorry, but did you just say spew?
"I don't get it," Potter said, frowning. "Nothing has changed since the day I invoked
"Funny you're acting this way, actually," he mused in a curious tone. "Considering you've had a child before already. Surely you know what to expect by now?"
"Oh, we have a pretty good idea," Ron interjected, shaking his head. "Never going back down there, never again, I tell you."
Harry couldn't help but let out a long-held breath. He really owed Helen for that. Big time. St. Mungo's was a stickler for rules and regulations, and being allowed access to Ginny's medical status was something of a privilege, even for the Savior.
Draco let out a breath of relief. "Let me call her."
It was a new experience for Draco, having to get up in the middle of the night to settle Scorpius down, but he found it somewhat enjoyable, as well as eye opening. While he and Astoria handled Scorpius themselves during the day, they slept uninterrupted thanks to the nurse elves stationed in the nursery. Thankfully, his son hadn't made a mess (yet) so Draco was able to get to sleep once Scorpius had settled down again.
"Well, Harry... Harry came to me one day and told me about how he thought I'd been pushing myself too much mentally and emotionally that it was affecting my physical well-being. Sounded like a load of waffle at the time..." she laughed weakly.
Harry had learned early on to take each day as it came, so he didn't experience sudden life changes like everyone else. Growing up with Dursleys, who were quite quick to change moods for almost no reason at all, he had learned to deal with anything without question. When he learned he was a wizard, he was surprised but obediently followed a gigantic stranger to unknown parts of London. When he found out that some crazed criminal was his godfather, and not quite a crazy criminal after all, he had taken it in stride. When he found out he was a fucking Horcrux, well, he had willingly walked to his own death. Even when he found out about Ginny's pregnancy, he had seen it as just another surprise to accept into his life with open arms. On the contrary, he could see that Ginny dealt with change a little differently. She had barely spoken to him just because she found out he was the Boy Who Lived. It took her another three years just to get over that and finally become comfortable in Harry's presence.
Ron perused the letter, crossing out the corresponding ingredients on the list he had. "Clever prat," he muttered, his tone full of admiration. Harry knew that even Ron admitted how much Malfoy was helping this particular case. In fact, he had only been working on the formula for only three weeks, and so much information had already been narrowed down despite the large margin for speculation. After weeks of feeling stagnant, Harry was beginning to an end to their previously lost cause. And Malfoy had a lot to do with it, which meant he owed the blonde. A lot.
The laughter reflected in Harry's eyes, his mood definitely better. He and Ron would definitely need tonight to unwind after the last month, and he was quite curious to hear what Draco had to say about his first few weeks as a dad-to-be. He had a feeling that tomorrow was going to be a big day, what with Ginny's return home, so he wanted tonight to rest and recharge. He and Ron had at least agreed that Malfoy was an excellent drinking companion, and they were both looking forward to their night out with the Ferret.
"You know what hurt even more, Harry?" she sniffed, interrupting him. "That Malfoy was here, obviously not on purpose, and yet he still fit in more than I did. Fucking Malfoy, Harry! And why is he suddenly part of our wards! What made you suddenly decide that he should be aware of James! James is ours, Harry, he's our baby!"
Astoria gave a small sniffle, but remained taciturn, still shaking while hugging herself. Draco moved to sit next to her, and took one of her hands for comfort.
Draco felt no pang of insult, however, despite the obvious snub. He had known Daphne from Hogwarts after all, and they had merely been yearmates in school. Not even a friendship had blossomed over the years, and Draco couldn't care less. He had always gotten along better with Pansy anyway. Daphne had been quite the cold bitch, if he could remember.
"Just go and talk with your mum," Harry said gently. "You're absolutely lucky that you've got her to talk about your own childhood," he said with a sad smile. "I'm sure she would just love to tell you all sorts of embarrassing stories of your spoiled little arse."
ward around his relationship with Ginevra, Astoria had joined the gossip bandwagon while Draco remained uninterested in such matters - he did not see any use or advantage - and so he did not care.
"Yeah, so think of two families brokering an alliance between their children. It all comes down to the contract, if the families do decide to wed. They have stipulations and everything on the contract, to ensure a good relationship between the two parties."
Harry frowned. Both of them had noticed that James took to his father much better than to his mum. Despite all the alternate hours they had set up with the boys, Ginny couldn't seem to offer the kind of comfort that their eldest found in Harry. It was both warming and disheartening at the same time.
"What?!" To Harry, it was an incredulous concept.
Malfoy sniggered. "Baby steps, Potter," he said. "We can worry about taking over the world some other time."
It was Narcissa.
"I try."
"I'm not!" Ron said crossly. "I'm trying to look at this as objectively as possible, Harry. C'mon! She's related to me but I feel like you're getting the shorter end of the deal, here. Doesn't that tell you that something is off? I mean, look at me and Herm! We've had to go through a huge readjustment just to compromise and adjust to each other. It wasn't easy-"
"In any case," Narcissa went on as if he hadn't interrupted, "I've noticed that you have become more withdrawn in the last few days."
When Harry gave her a smug look, Ginny grumbled some more. "At least I can fly for the rest of Montreal," she said consolingly to herself.
As if on cue, Draco's brain was jolted at the mention of the child. Automatically, he looked around for the boy, and the Auror laughed.
To be fair, he had never imagined he would be in such a situation, at least not so soon. Things had been going great after the ward release, more than a year ago, and he and Ginny had fallen into the kind of comfortable companionship that they'd always looked for in each other. They'd given each other so much space to grow, and they both enjoyed the amazing experience of being by each other's sides during every accomplishment they had. Ginny had decided to move in with Harry to spend more time with him and offset her constant training with the Harpies, and they had both felt quite giddy at the idea of living together.
"And I want you to follow it," Rosewood said sternly, glaring a bit at Ginny. "I was far lenient for your first child, Ginny, but now that you have almost the same risks and circumstances as Hermione's pregnancy with Hugo, I'm placing you in similar restrictions."
experiences were nothing minor when it came to underage magic.
Perhaps as a child, discovering magic for the first time and wanting to explore it, the sense of adventure and proximity to danger was cause for excitement, and he was always ready to rush into anything that came his way. After the war though, a part of him realized that he was tired of adventure. Sure, he was still the first to jump into action when facing off dangerous opponents on the field. But after James, he had also begun to crave for a nice talk with friends over a pint.
Draco nodded dazedly. He made no move, not knowing what exactly to do next, until a Mediwitch transferred the bundled infant into his arms. As the weight settled, so did Draco's heart, and he felt his soul flutter in utmost happiness at the first real feel of Scorpius, his son, so close to himself.
It was very serious magic and one couldn't spread it too thinly. Theoretically, the possibilities were limitless, no matter the number of people and distance. But realistically, very few people ever had a strong enough magical core and personal intent to empower and maintain any more than a handful of loved ones.
"Malfoy?!" he cried, surprise evident on his face.
This information was new to Draco. "Potter? I assumed Weasley would have been more concerned."
Harry waved his hand to allow passage, and to his immense shock, out came Teddy.
Secretly, Draco wished wholeheartedly that she could really appreciate him as he was despite his absence in their social circle. While she was busy keeping up their proper pureblood manner, Draco was technically breaking tradition by choosing not to do so. He was sure that Astoria had to do a lot of clever sidewinding when explaining his sudden desire to stay out of the limelight (probably along the lines of 'Oh, he's just focusing on this new potion that he's developing from an old Malfoy text'), and he kept promising himself that he would make it up to her however he could.
Draco remained silent, but against his will, he tried remembering what had happened the day he met Astoria. He'd always felt that he was flying on Felix whenever he recounted to anyone who asked - it was too good to be true that he'd met his perfect match in such a way.
"What?" Ron asked concernedly.
Draco had politely pointed out that most of those things were already accomplished, but he was surprised when Potter had deflated and sunk even lower into his chair, gulping down more drink and becoming slightly slurred in speech.
Harry dropped his drink in surprise. "Astoria's away?"
"Well, first of all, the
Teddy scrunched his nose in childish disgust - apparently he had an inkling of what dirty diapers meant.
"You look like shit. My house elves dress better than that, and they have no clothes. Go freshen up before you join me for breakfast. Robes are in the left hand side of the closet."
"Hey, hey, just relax," Harry said, slightly going back into panic mode at the sight of Ron breaking down. He knew how much this meant to Ron, but also aware of how much more level-headed Hermione was, and that there was likely more to this than what he got so far. "What exactly did she say?" he asked.
"Good afternoon, Mother," he said brightly. When Narcissa gave him a look, he asked, "What?"
filling in his words at the end. "Speaking of...may we talk privately, Mother?"
Of course, Draco was only trying to reach Potter the only way he knew how - by verbal fencing. And to the surprise of the Weasel and the Mudblood, Potter gave out a barking laugh.
"I think I may actually believe that," Harry said quietly. James was now struggling in his arms, babbling nonsense and trying to move away from his dad.
Ginny looked at him thoughtfully. "If you mean for a courtship, are you ready?"
"It doesn't really mean much though, not if she hasn't shown the slightest interest in moving forward with me. It's not exactly reassuring that both Ginny and I are actually fine being apart.
Out of all of Draco's childhood friends, acquaintances, colleagues and associates, the Chosen One was the only wizard he could think of that could probably understand how his inner fears ate away at him and rendered him helpless. They had both survived the war under the shadow of a madman, and both within the manipulative machinations of controlling men. His enemy, Draco had belatedly realized, was perhaps the only one who could ever truly sympathize.
At his words, Narcissa's lip quirked up a bit. "I have told you before that I have no intention of meddling in your private affairs, Draco, but something like this must be addressed soon. Your pairing is of great significance to the new world order, and it unfortunately puts you in the scrutinizing eye of the magical public. Your actions speak louder than words, and if they see that there is even a scruple of discord in your relationship..."
"You seriously want to do this? Are you
"I'm Teddy," the boy answered, his hair turning the same shade of silver as the man's before him. Malfoy took a step back in surprise, which made Harry's lips turn up at the corners.
"You will. You're Harry Potter. You're destined for great things, it's just who you are. I bet you, you'll find her in the most unlikely of places. Then you'll eat your words."
"Sorry, I shouldn't have said anything. I wasn't thinking when-"
"They're alright. Mum's just nagging Ginny about the baby, but that's been going on for the last two hours anyway so it's getting annoying."
"I mean, of course we had an arrangement for her strict training schedule, but we hadn't exactly expected to have a child at this point, not when we both knew that she had to away for so long each time."
"I'm glad you got what you wanted, and I'm glad that you were able to experience it," Harry said seriously. "When you'd introduced him the first time, I knew how much of a big deal it was for him to have that name after you'd mentioned it to me. I'm really happy for you."
"So, Mione," he began nervously. He didn't want to set her off in any way. "I've been meaning to talk to you alone for a while, you know, just to talk." He went for light and casual, but Hermione rolled her eyes at him and sighed dramatically.
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean it that way," Harry said immediately, voice softening. James was almost awake now, stretching his tiny little arms and yawning. "Look, I don't know why, Malfoy, okay? But I think I trust you. After working with you for the last couple months, it's like, I don't know, I feel like telling you all this stuff, even things that I can't tell my best mates."
Harry used his consoling tone of voice in order to soothe his friend's nerves a bit. "Don't worry about it, we'll put it together at the MMI. This is still a fairly standard pattern for threats. Your continued exposure to the public as well as your apparent disregard for the threats to your life are probably causing them to feel dissatisfied. They'll be wanting to cause a reaction in you. It'll be an insult to them that you don't care, and it'll come to a head. That's when we can catch them."
"I - I see," Draco stammered, brow scrunching in apprehension. "And why are they necessary?"
"I think it's pretty clear with our established schedule so far that you'll be spending much more time away from here than me," he continued.
Perhaps Malfoy expected him to take the mickey, but Harry actually paused to think about the choice. "Scorpius..." he whispered, as if tasting it on his tongue. "That actually sounds... well, it's as odd as any wizarding name, as pretentious as a Malfoy, and as uniquely memorable as Draco... not as sinister as Lucius, which is a plus..."
"But Mother!" Draco cried, unable to sound level-headed in teh face of a medical crisis. "She's been in there for almost half an hour and I've not been allowed to see her! It's unbelievable!"
, he thought sleepily,
"You're disgusting," Harry laughed. "You know what I meant."
He couldn't tell that to Narcissa, though.
Draco felt like laughing at his mother's good mood. Freedom suited her, as well as being away from the poisonous world that used to be dominated by the Dark Lord. She looked positively radiant, and Draco almost felt bad about having missed her obvious reintegration into society.
"Will that be all then?" he asked, unsure. When Hermione nodded morosely, Draco sighed. "Alright. Glad to have been of use. Have a good day."
Ron sighed. "Yeah, sure, mate, s'long as you're really alright with it."
"But…" Draco felt his brows furrow as he gathered his thoughts, "I thought that the message was only sent there because Astoria and I were scheduled to be there…this means…"
Draco had no idea where this was going, but his worry prompted him to listen quietly.
, it being an old and ancient invocation and thus rooted in traditional magical bindings. Surely, no one here is in denial of the fact that his very involvement was the key to defeating Voldemort." Many representatives nodded in assent, just to show the Minister that they agreed. That was always important, naturally.
"Before I go, there are some important matters I would like to address." He surveyed the audience before him, and pushed himself to go through with his plan. "I am well known to you all, who have been told all about me even for the first eleven years when I didn't even know myself." At this, a few tsks could be heard, punctuated by sad sighs. Harry ignored them.
Ginny sighed, and settled onto the couch. Harry remained standing, now with his arms crossed. He had no idea where this conversation was headed, and he felt there were other, more pressing matters, that they had to resolve.
"We elves has tested the letter, but magic is not allowing us to open the seal." the elf explained nervously. "We is not sending it up to Master's room without Master's permission."
"He couldn't have, could he?" Ginny said thoughtfully. "
: (drops parchments) That- what?
Harry shook his head, still smiling. "Only as busy as Teddy will make me. Come on through."
Despite Harry's worries after the odd Floo Call, Malfoy seemed oblivious to how close he had come to unravelling his biggest secret, and he was grateful. The two of them had now gotten more used to having to work around each other, either by Floo or owl post. Meeting in person was still too risky for either of them, though Ron had pointed out that Grimmauld Place would be sufficiently private enough for them to converse in person should the need arise. Harry agreed, but so far, the fire calls and the owls were working well enough as a means of communication.
"Well bully for those stupid fuckers, because they're not worth your time or attention if they can't get it around their heads just how great you are! I'm surprised this is even a problem, since we pretty much broke apart the old Ministry before putting it back together the right way." Harry swallowed, as everything seemed to click into place in his head. He was sure that Kingsley had pretty much gotten rid of the prejudice within the Ministry since he came into power. After seven years, Harry hadn't come across any hint of the old bigotry in the Ministry except among the Dark wizards they captured. Then he thought about Hermione's tendency to be highly pessimistic. Could she possibly be causing her own grief by unwittingly projecting her own personal doubts on the people around her?
"Don't you run out though?" Harry asked. "I mean, I remember Astronomy with Professor Sinistra, and there are only a handful of star names that actually sound decent."
Ron had immediately reverted to his Auror mode upon returning, and fell back into stride with the Malfoy case. Harry still only spent alternating half days at the Ministry, working from home on the off days. Draco continued his charade of normal life, albeit under Harry's personal bindings.
: That's wonderful news. I'm sure with all of you grown up, there was a need for them to help out with the grandchildren.
"What?" he asked, alarmed. She was scary when she scrutinized things like that and he had no idea what she was thinking. Especially now that she was scrutinizing
"Let's hope so, Harry. But our problem now is figuring out how this is relevant to our current case or not."
"I shall Floo Potter as soon as you end this call," he continued. "But in the meantime..."
Despite the Auror Corps' silence about how the case was cracked, Draco was surprised that he had been treated as a celebrated figure within the walls of Potter and Weasley's workplace for at least a month. His unprecedented Potions expertise had successfully led the MMI to the mysterious Persephone's Poison, which, as Draco had unerringly suggested, was the brainchild of Swedish brothers Edvard and Gøran Eilert. The potion, which had been created by their great-great-grandfather, was a potent means of spiriting away unwilling persons from their own homes. Its effects were similar to the combined symptoms of the Imperius and Amortentia, which rendered the victim highly suggestible and vulnerable to the one who administered the potion, this being highly dangerous as it kept the victim with complete confidence that they were only acting out of their own will, and not the suggestions of the poisoner. After only one dose, it left no room for doubt - the victim would always think and act according to the desires of the poisoner, and they would believe that they were doing it of their own free will.
Narcissa cleared her throat a bit guiltily, he noticed. "I may have been slightly more persuasive when I spoke with her."
His private study was as immaculately maintained as himself. Nary a book was out of its proper place, and god forbid if a house elf left a speck of dust anywhere within the room. Sinking into an armchair by the fire, Draco instinctively thought of Flooing Blaise, but then realized the ungodly hour and reminded himself to do so much later. The chair was cozy, and his mind drifted off to those days right after the war when his life had changed course. No doubt that another upheaval was coming his way... but Draco decided not to think about the upcoming trial until the very last moment.
Hermione, as always, was first to react. "I still think we need to find empirical data before we conclude that the emotional... imbalance... is the root cause of the failed wards."
"How do you even get that idea from such a stupid letter?" Astoria asked after she had read it. The words had sounded dissonant, as if they didn't even go together. Draco waved his hand impatiently.
"I did invite you over," Malfoy reminded him. "I only hope to Merlin that you're not secretly a vampire as well."
The trainees groaned but did as they were told, running around the field at full sprint, while the intimidating Auror Philius Stone took notes on their progress. After the lap, the trainees were close to collapsing, and it was obvious that most of them were fighting away the fatigue in order to prove their resilience in the face of such torture.
"What is it?" he demanded. "What does it say!"
"Come inside," his mother said brusquely. "There is something I wish to talk to you about."
"Well in that case, you know the drill," she said, handing him over a shrunken trunk filled with all the things Harry needed to care for Teddy. "I've packed more clothes for him, since he went through almost an entire wardrobe the last time he stayed here, all that chocolate syrup on the shirts..." She raised one eyebrow at Harry, and he realized she knew about his bribing him with ice cream. He smiled sheepishly, but Andromeda's smile seemed to hint that it was okay. " I've included some of his favorite books and toys, since he now loves being read to before bed..."
The elf blinked at him.
"Well.…we fight. We make up. We compromise a lot. We're not exactly going by the book, so we're kind of… making it up as we go along."
"I've been - I've been thinking about it, and it all adds up! This man - he - he used to court me - that was b-before we - he was always so aggressive and I dismissed the courtship from him and - oh I don't know, I'm afraid to tell you but I'm sick of hiding, and I'm scared of what he might resort to just to get revenge!"
Harry laughed. He checked on Ron first to make sure he was still breathing, then went to the kitchen to fetch glasses of water and potions for both him and Malfoy.
"You've got such a bad case of savior's complex, you know that?"
Harry sighed and leaned back. He had thought that having this conversation in the dining room might help, but he thought all of them needed the warmth and comfort offered by the sitting room.
To his relief, Ron seemed to pick up on his line of thought. "Since we caught the Eilerts and confiscated all the new batches of Persephone's Poison? Nothing too major, I reckon. He's a bit nicer, of course," he added with a smirk. "Still smug, but nice. Have you noticed anything yourself?"
"Well, when you put it that way- but I do feel -"
, he thought acidly.
: No, it wasn't. And neither was the information about Sirius Black. (clenches fists) In his case, there were witnesses, and there was Pettigrew's finger for evidence. No one even thought to look further, no one focused on hearing out Sirius' story. He was just dismissed and carted off to Azkaban. If the Aurors then had questioned Sirius more thoroughly, they would have understood the real intent, the betrayal of Pettigrew, and the innocence of my godfather.
First of all, Potter had taken all the legal steps to ensure his complete privacy and independence from the Ministry. That had taken the whole wizarding world by storm, causing all sorts of wonder and outrage from all sides. Then there was his defense of Draco and Narcissa. What was that about? Draco thought angrily.
"I told you NEVER to bother me while I'm working!" Draco bellowed, quite unbecoming of a Malfoy, but at that moment, he didn't even care who was outside the double doors. He had been in the middle of a complicated brainstorming and was so close to filling in one piece of the missing puzzle when he was rudely interrupted. Whatever epiphany he was close to achieving, it all dissolved as soon as his concentration was broken.
And he’s back with me again. I blink up at him and smile shyly. He’s so confusing. I ask a question that’s been bugging me.
Oh. That was an unexpected answer. Another first? Does he mean the sleeping arrangements, perhaps?
“How was Blaise when you went to the bar with him on Friday?”
“Well I’m not. We will go home and get both the boys' coats. Then go to the flower park.” He says with his chin held high.
I run down the corridor and then suddenly I can't breathe. I lean against the wall and put my head in my hands. What the hell was I thinking?! Unwelcome, my eyes start to water. Why am I crying?! I sink to the floor and pull my hair in anger. I draw my knees up and fold in on myself, trying to make myself as small as possible. Maybe the pain will shrink as I do. I let the tears come, even though they are for the loss of something I never had. Mourning something that never was — my dashed hopes, my dashed dreams, and my soured expectations. I have never been on the receiving end of rejection.
“I know you love it.” He tells me while getting up off the examination bed.
“What’s she doing?! She can’t just leave!” I’m about to go after her when Hermione pulls me back.
“Draco Malfoy.” He rolls his eyes.
“Yes.” I simply say, because yes yes yes yes yes!
I step out and grab a towel. I quickly dry my body and then rub my hair. I don’t rub it hard enough and it’s still dripping but I don’t care. I put the towel around my waist and head for the bag of clothes.
Soon enough me and Luna arrive at the doorstep of grimmauld. I closed the floo down the last time I came. I go to open the door but find I can’t bring myself to do it.  This is probably the last time for years to come that I’ll get to enter this place. The place where Sirius hid out with Buckbeak. The place I was going to live with him before he died. The place where the order met to have secret meetings. The place where me, Ron, and Hermione decided we would sleep better on a couch and the floor all together rather than in separate bedrooms, when we were on the run. And where I stayed hidden after the war. This is the place where Teddy had his first sleepover. Where he learnt to crawl and listened to stories about his parents. This is where me and Draco had so many firsts. How could I leave this place?
As I stand and wait for our row to disperse, Pansy calls to me. She’s heading my way from the back door.
“Right, close your eyes and slowly go up the stairs.” I tell her and go behind her in case she falls, while Draco takes the front. We all get to the door and stop.
“Hey dray? How do you feel if we make one of these bedrooms for Nia? I hate thinking of her out there in an old barn. And she’s helped us loads with the house. And she’s trying really hard in lessons. And-“ he turns around and kisses me, presumably to shut me up.
His bedroom is vast. The windows are ceiling-height and look out across London, and there is a balcony attached. The walls are white, and the furnishings are oak. The enormous bed matches the furnishings and has four posts but no canopy. On the wall above it is a stunning painting of a quidditch match; the snitch flies past with two players following and then all of them out of sight, then it starts again.
Hermione.
October 28th
Resolving there and then not to ask him for them and not give him satisfaction, I shall go meet his parents without my underwear. I almost hug myself with glee because I know this will drive him crazy.
“I see.” Is all he says and I think I see a hint of a smile on his face but can’t be sure. “Would you like to sit?” He asks again and waves me over to a white leather couch.
“I know. I just wanted to help.” He gets up by himself and huffs at me.
His lip quirks up at me, and he shakes his head.
“See he likes you, I think this will be good bonding for the both of you.” Ron’s behind her trying not to laugh at me.
Draco Malfoy
“If you have willing volunteers, then why am I here?”
“Why yes we can. We have some exciting news to tell you both.” Draco tells Teddy and ruffles his hair, which then turns white blonde.
“Well lets hope. Would you like a cup of tea Harry?” She asks heading for the kitchen.
“You are welcome to borrow any books.” I say and startle him.
“Bye Harry, Thank you for coming. Tonight has been lovely.”
“No, well yes. But not like that. I just asked her if you had anything planned for next Friday so I could invite you to Molly and Arthurs.”
“Everyone back in there. There’s more room and then everyone can see him.” She announces and everyone goes back from where they came. We follow and see that the whole family is here.
“Fine, if you don’t want my help you should just say.”
“I’m not sure actually sir. I told her I would be popping in, but not specifically today.” I look at him sheepishly.
“Right that’s it! Come here.” I ran for him but he screamed and scattered. I cornered him and lifted him up over my shoulder. He was laughing and hitting my back playfully.
“He was with me when you phoned.” Potter answers my unasked question.
“O course ‘arry! Come in!”
“Like him enough to….?”
“Well, I’m around. Tomorrow maybe….”
Ethan has his arm around my waist when I look up into the frosty green eyes of Harry Potter. Pansy is beside him.
Christmas morning comes and goes and everyone has opened their presents. Ophelia is on my knee with her new pet pygmy puff. She decided to call it Elsa after her favourite Disney princess.
“Hey Hermione, can I hold Rosie.” I ask after a few minutes of quiet chatting. She nods and passes her over.
His mouth is slightly open, and his breathing is harsh. He’s sweating slightly and he groans.
He purses his lips. “I need to know that you’re not hungry.”
“Guys, I really need you right now. Please stay.” That seems to cool them both down and they turn to me with worried looks.
Ginny comes into the room now with the whiteboard from the baby shower.
I flush and glance nervously at Weasley, who remains impassive, eyes on the road.
“No no, I don’t speak to them.” She shakes her head smiling.
“You did well boys, he’s gorgeous.” Andy says then. “How long was the labour Draco? Not long I hope.”
“I’m soooo sorry Harry. I thought you and Draco could do it up to how you want it exactly. I thought it would be a fresh start for both of you. I thought you’d like it. I really didn’t mean anything bad by it. I just thought that you’d get to spend more time together, like we did when we were doing up grimmauld place, i know how much you enjoyed doing it. And I thought you’d get to talk more and laugh more and think about family more because i know how much you both want a family. I thought you could build it while building a life together. I really thought you’d like it Harry.” She sobbed. Great, I had Draco in tears at one end of the front yard and Hermione in tears at this end. She had nothing to be upset about, this was her fault! All though thinking about what she said, that kind of makes sense, and annoyingly it sounded fun. I did really enjoy doing grimmauld place up, and here we can start from total scratch.
“I thought you didn't make love. I thought you fucked hard.” I swallow, my mouth suddenly dry.
“Why don’t you get the table and I’ll get the drinks? What would you like?” He asks me, polite as always.
“How are you getting back?”
Me, defying him….how?
“Yeah it was.” I kiss him quickly and drag him outside.
No acts involving children or animals.
“I’m not having either crew put at risk. No, cancel….We’ll air-drop instead…..Good.” He hangs up. The warmth in his eyes has disappeared. He looks forbidding, and with one quick glance at me, he apparates out, then is back a moment later.
“Ha, I doubt that. He practically offered you a job.” She says and looks up at me. I blush again and get up and practically run to the kitchen to get away.
Leaving Harry with them, I go in search of Severus.
“Shit! It’s my mother.”
“You, fascinated by a guy? That’s a first.” She snorts.
“Yeah, just carry on.” He says through clenched teeth. When I’m pressed up against his arse I stop for a minute to let him recover a bit.
This chapter carries on from the last chapter.
“No I’ve been… well, ill really. I nearly killed myself.” I don’t know why I tell him this but it seems right and I’m not ashamed. “Andy?” I say then, referring to my question. Draco is just staring at me now with a look of shock and confusion. Then he stutters out “kitchen.” And that’s where I head.
“Well?”
“Hey cub. Wakey wakey.” He stirs and parts his eyes.
“I’m a very private person, Mr Malfoy. I go a long way to protect my privacy. I don’t often give wizarding interviews….”
“Are you going in the sea? Can I come too?” Teddy stands up and runs to us.
“Will do, darling. Goodbye.”
15.14: The rules. More on those later.
“Oh, fuck the paperwork.” He growls, and lunges at me. He pushes me up against the elevator and pins my hands above my head with one hand, while pining my to the wall with his hips. Holy shit! His other hand grabs my hair and yanks it down. It's only just not painful. It brings my face up and then his lips are on mine. I moan and this gives his tongue an opening into my mouth. He takes full advantage and expertly explores every inch of my mouth. I have never been kissed like this before. I melt into him. My tongue joins his and they mouth together all touch and sensation. He brings his hand from my hair down to my neck and then back up to my chin where he grips it. I am helpless, with my hands pinned, my face held, and his hips restraining me. He grinds against me and that's when I feel it. His erection against my hip. I’m sure he can feel mine against his leg and I moan again. He wants me! Harry Potter, Greek god, powerful wizard, wants me! And I definitely want him, right now, in this elevator.
We give her our order and she wanders over to the kitchen.
“Well next time he gets out of line, someone should teach him some manners.”
“We’re not done here, Andrew. Please cancel my next meeting.”
“Slowly.” He says, sounding very tired.
“I can't stay long today Andy sorry. Draco’s not feeling very well so I’m taking him to see a mediwitch later, but i want to get back to be there for him.”
“Did you have fun today?”
“No it definitely was not. Wait and see.” Then Draco turns and spots me. “Oh Harry! Come watch me beat weasels arse at chess.” I go over to him and sit on the arm of the chair and wrap my arm around his shoulders.
“Hmm, I don’t know how many Draco wants, but I want at least 4.”
“She’ll love it, I’m sure.” I squeeze his hand and we finish our breakfast.
“Wow...good play Malfoy.” He says and shakes Draco’s hand. Maybe he won’t be bothered about the baby thing.
(See the end of the chapter for
I can’t help but grin.
“Dray, can I floo call Hermione and Ron?” I plead and he just laughs and nods.
“Harry.” I reply, and at that moment the doors close. Thank fuck.
“Important details.”
“You like him, then?”
“Thanks for showing us the house Harry, it really is lovely. We best be getting off so I can feed this little monster.” She kissed Rose’s head and collected her things. “Call us as soon as anything happens.” She goes over to Harry and gives him a half hug, with the side she isn’t holding the baby, and then kisses his head like she did Rosies.  Then she does the same to Draco and whispers ‘good luck’ to him. She smiles at her and we say our goodbyes.
I chuckle.
“Four years.” I mutter. “Would you like anything else?” My voice comes out husky and breathy and his eyes widen slightly.
After another half an hour of chatting and people saying congratulations, people start leaving. Soon enough me, Draco, Teddy and Andy are the only ones left. Me and Draco are lounging on the couch, with him between my legs and my hands all over his belly. Andy is in her arm chair and Teddy’s almost asleep next to the fire.
“Don’t be stupid Harry. I was only joking. Of course you didn’t know.”
“I want to deserve to possess them, but yes, bottom line, I do.”
“No, that's because he isn’t himself at the moment. He just needs time. Come on, let's leave him to sleep.” They shut the door and I instantly fall back to sleep.
“Harry…” I hear him whisper but it’s too late, I don’t look back and go through the floo home.
“I..I’m … I’m so sorry.” He says and turns to leave.
“Molly, these are beautiful. Thank you so much.” Draco says and holds the little jumper to his belly.
“What is it, Draco?” he asks, as we are waiting for Weasley to fetch the car. How does he know I’m chewing something over in my mind? Is he a legilimens? He reaches up and pulls my chin.
“Well that’s stupid.” Teddy says which makes me smirk. Which is when we arrive at the door.
“Don’t move your hands, or we just have to start all over again.” he scolds me mildly. Oh, he’s such a tease.
The following day, I fire-call my mother after I get home from work. It’s been a relatively peaceful day at The Hogs Head, allowing me far too much time to think. I’m restless, nervous about my showdown with Mr Control Freak tomorrow, and at the back of my mind, I’m worried that perhaps I’ve been too negative in my response to the contract. Perhaps he’ll call the whole thing off.
“Where are we going? Can’t we just admire the view from here?”
“Do you wanna try have a nap while they are still far apart?” I ask him. He nods and I kiss his forehead. “Okay, I’m going to shut the floo and lock the door. Then I’m going to get some toast, shall I bring you something up?” He’s got his eyes closed by now but shakes his head.
It’s been exactly a week since me and Draco had that fight and Ron’s party was tomorrow. I hadn’t heard off Draco since and I have just been throwing myself into work. I've not told anyone what happened really, just that me and Draco might be taking a break for a little while. I’m not going to tell them that Draco is embarrassed to be seen with them, it would just make them upset as well as me. And I don’t want to upset them, I love them. Hermione is utterly confused and wants to know what really happened but I just can’t tell her.
“Dray, are you okay? I thought you took the potion?” I say while rubbing his back. He straightens up then and takes a breath.
“What is it?” he asks, cocking his head to one side.
“Very nice.” he whispers appreciatively, and my nipples harden even more.
“Just how sore are you?” he asks as he sits down next to me. I blush. Why does he ask such personal questions?
“Thanks mate. Merlin, we haven’t even thought about the wedding yet, I think we are going to wait until after the baby.” He snorts and we are silent for a minute, then I just blurt out calmly;
Then the day after was Draco’s 20 week scan. We could find out the gender at this scan, but instead we were having a joint gender reveal party with Ron and Hermione.  They changed their minds about not wanting to know last month. So we (Hermione) planned a whole party around it. It isn’t really mine or Draco’s thing but it could be fun. George is the one that is going to know because he is putting the reveal into fireworks, of course.
“Don’t worry mate, this is definitely real. I don’t think you’re clever enough to dream all this anyway.” He snorts and gets another whack off Hermione but I laugh.
I head through the crowd and know I am going to throw up at some point in the next ten minutes. I don’t feel steady on my feet and my head spins. I make it outside and take a big breath of cool air. My vision is fucked up and I’m seeing double of everything. I feel so sick. Why did I do this to myself?
I stare down at my hands, as I knot my fingers together. Suddenly I feel emotional. He’s leaving. Reaching over, he takes one of my hands and slowly pulls it to his mouth, tenderly kissing the back of my hand, such an old-fashioned, sweet gesture. My heart leaps into my mouth.
“Of course Harry, I told you anytime.”
“Guess it’s us.” She says and I go over to Draco. I sit on the steps next to him and put my arm over his shoulder, to which he leans in and takes my other hand.
“Well...well because of our past, or maybe because we are both men, or maybe because they don’t think I deserve uncle Harry.” Draco tells him with a twinge of sadness in his voice.
“Yes.”
Teddy looks shocked for about half a second and then runs into the room and chases the firework horses and streamers around the room laughing. Everyone greets him and wishes him a happy birthday. Andy flicks on the wireless and the party starts.
“No, saying I didn't want to see him anymore.”
“After you’ve taken so much trouble to set up the recorder, you ask me now?”
Draco Malfoy
“Of course, go ahead.” I go over to him on the floor and pick him up. He wakes up a bit then.
“Ow! Harry, what was that for?!” She cried and sits down on the grass clutching her thigh.
“I am so sorry.”
“I am so sorry. It’s um...written here.” I point at the parchment, while also being distracted by my first name on his lips. My heart starts pumping faster and I blush again. I squirm again and run a hadn through my hair nervously.
I purse my lips at him.
The following Friday I start Nia’s lessons and Teddy also comes to help with the house. Nia’s books came yesterday and we walked through what we would start with. I’ve been teaching her magic 101 of things she needs to know, since we found out. But now her books are here, we can finally start practicing magic.
“I don't need to know any more. So you won’t suspend me then?”
We were walking home from the worst date in the history of dates. And to top it off, it was pouring down with rain, and we only had one umbrella which only covered half of both of us. There wasn’t much talking going on and I didn’t blame him, both our moods were low after tonight. We were nearly back at mine so he could use the floo to get home, and I hadn’t even had a chance to kiss him yet. Not that he’d want a kiss after tonight, maybe I should just leave it tonight and see if he even wants to see me again. Not likely if I’m honest, and if he does then he's either mad or he likes me as much as I like him.
“Tit for tat is not my usual style, Mr Malfoy.” he whispers as he gently blows up and down my cock. “But you’ve pleased me today, and you should be rewarded.” I hear the wicked grin in his voice, and while my body is singing from his words, his tongue starts to slowly circle the head of my cock as one of his hands holds the bottom of it and the other hand holds my hip down.
“How are you feeling?” he asks when we are back in the room. He switches on a side light.
“How old were you when you were adopted?” I ask him because now my interest is piqued and I want to know more.
“Yeah I must admit it's cute.”
“Why would I do that?”
“More?” he says again softly. Testing the word - a small, simple word, but so full of promise. His thumb traces my lower lip. “You want hearts and flowers.”
The only way I ever have any chance to see what he’s thinking. Actually, who am I kidding? I never know what he’s thinking, but I like looking into his eyes. He has beautiful eyes - captivating, intelligent, deep, and dark, dark with dominant secrets. I recall his burning smoky gaze and try to ignore the twitch of my cock.
My face is on fire and my blood is pumping faster than I would like. I cannot believe...well…. any of that. I step out of the elevator in a haze and hand my pass back to reception and sign out. As I step outside the rain hits me and it’s like I’ve run into a brick wall. What was I thinking? I close my eyes and take a deep breath. The rain cools my skin.
She nods and picks up two more books to pack.
“Of course you didn’t know! Because you and your Gryffindor brain never think! I should have known something like this would happen.” He sounded so broken in that last sentence that I just had to take his hand to try and comfort him in any way I could. “I thought you said Hermione had looked at this place?” He asked. Ahh yes Hermione, well now Draco will blame her too, ha! Serves her right. Does she think this is a prank or something. Is this because of the so-called pregnancy brain George was telling us about, or wrackspurts according to Luna. Maybe they really did affect her brain and now she’s gone crazy and thinks words mean the opposite to what they do. But she’s so clever, she must have a reason for this.
I can’t bring myself to even consider the food list. I swallow hard, my mouth dry, and read it again.
“So the photographer called?”
“What do you mean you don’t know?”
“Because we're having another baby.” He says with a smile towards me. The whole garden erupts in cheers and laughter and happiness. Yet, I’m sat still in shock. Then Draco hands me a scan photo and I jump up. I grab him around the waist and lift him up while swinging him around. He holds on to me and buries his face in my shoulder while laughing.
No acts involving breath control.
“No, but if they see it I’m not going to deny it.” He smiles at me and I take his hand.
“You silly boy. What would I do if you weren’t here? Teddy wouldn’t have a godfather then. That’s someone else he would grow up without.” She says and takes my hand.
“What’s so funny?” He asks, but I just shake my head quickly. No way am I upsetting him more. I swallow my last bit of pancake and look at him. He’s still staring at me.
“I won’t disagree with you there.” I say and take his hand while he’s still laughing. He won’t be laughing soon, he’ll probably be being sick in about 5 seconds. 5....4….3….2….1. And off we go.
“Harry-“ He whispers and collapses against me. I manage to catch him after he had fallen to his knees.
“Fine, but don’t say I never do anything for you.” I crossed my arms and looked at her. She jumped up and down clapping her hands then. She looked so young and energetic. Not like she had been through a war and been working hard in the ministry for the past 4 years. I couldn’t help but smile with her.
After I’ve sat Draco down in the front room with a cup of tea, we go to leave. Then Ron stops and looks at Draco and then Rose.
“I want it here, just us, and I want to try the birthing pool. I want the pain relief spell because Hermione has already lectured me on the harmful muggle stuff. You are going to cut the cord. I will deliver the placenta and then get into our comfy bed with my baby. Okay?” He looks embarrassed and tilts his head down,so I lean over and kiss him.
“I could say the same to you.” I whisper back.
“Thank you, did your anniversary go as planned?” Me and Draco look at each other and try not to remember. It wasn’t awful, shall we say but it did not go as planned. While looking at each other we sort of agree to not tell anyone what happened.
“I need to be alone.” And left, presumably to go back to the barn. Draco got up and went to go after her but I held him back.
She had given us some clothes and nappies and the dragon teddy which is about a metre tall.
“I suspended him from my playroom ceiling. In fact, that’s one of your questions. Suspension - that’s what the carabiners are for in the playroom. Rope play. One of the ropes was tied too tightly.”
“....and Theo called to say you were around - I haven’t seen you for two weeks, darling.”
“Nothing! Can you stop asking me that! I’m allowed to be upset that my son is getting older.”
“You stupid stupid man!” I shout through the rain to him. He opens his mouth to speak but I don’t let him and carry on. “I have told you a million times that what happened in the war was not your fault. Draco, you were a child for fucks sake! You were threatened with your mother and fathers lives! And yes good people died, but that wasn’t your fault. That was Voldemort! He did that, not you. If you hadn’t let them in then he would have found another way and Bill might have died then. But he survived and now he has two beautiful daughters. You couldn’t kill anyone Draco, you're not a killer. And you lost family too. It may have been after the war, but your father wouldn’t have been in Azkaban if it wasn’t for the war, and he wouldn’t have died. So yes, I’ve been asking you to come because everyone has forgiven you Draco, a long time ago. They just want you to join in with our family. Be happy and make me happy, like you were doing.” He was shaking his head but as I went on he had stopped. We both leaned forward and our lips met. It was a slow soft kiss, a kiss full of apologises.
The waitress arrives with our glass of wine, and I immediately take a quick sip. Is he opening up or just making a casual observation?
“More?” he whispers.
“No. I wondered if we should continue your basic training.”
“Shall we get a dog?” I ask Draco after seeing the kids with her otter. “Kids love pets.” He just looks up at me and raises his eyebrow.
“Draco come on, let me in.” All I can hear is him throwing up and I just want to comfort him.
“Oh yes please uncle Harry! But is uncle Draco allowed to ride a broom while pregnant?”
I’m overwhelmed with love right now. He thought of this house as our home and heart even way back then. I kiss him with passion then and things are started to get heated, not that we can have sex in Draco’s condition, when we hear a subtle cough behind us and we pull apart. Standing there is an exhausted looking Ron and Hermione with baby rose is Ron’s arms. I jump up and rush over, then turn back and help Draco up. He’s massive now and can’t do much without help.
Me and Neville agreed he should probably wait until after we finish Nia’s room to come round. He said he would get the plants ordered and find some more books for Nia to look at. Then he left through the floo and I went to find Draco.
I find a couple of plates and place them under the warming charm with the pancakes. Harry reaches into a cupboard and pulls out my favourite tea. I purse my lips.
“Soooo….what did you actually think of him?” She asks me after turning down the music. Damn her and her inquisitive self.
He strokes his chin with his long fingers and looks to be contemplating my answer. Maybe he’s bored and is just playing it cool.
My mother is oozing contradiction, desperately sorry not to make my graduation. Father has some illness or another, there’s always something with him. Honestly, I don’t think I’ve been in the same room as him for at least 2 years. My mother rattles on about him making a full recovery, but in the meantime he’s resting up, and my mother has to wait on him hand and foot. I don't know why she still puts up with this bullshit. I suppose she loves him - Merlin knows why.
“Forget this! I’m going back to my quiet bed.” He says and then leaves the room. Me and Draco burst out laughing and I pick Leo up to stop him crying.
“It requires control and concentration….how could I not love it?” He laughs. “Although brooms are my favourite.”
“Wow! Aunt andromeda you didn’t have to get us this.” Draco says and stands up to inspect the pram.
“You don't know much,” he murmurs.
“What? It’s not a deathtrap. It’s fine. Blaise regularly checks it for me.”
“Then what the hell Draco?!” I hadn’t even realised I’d stepped outside until I could feel the rain on my shirtless body.
“Draco, there's something about him.” She says in warning. “He’s gorgeous, I totally agree, but I think he’s dangerous. Especially for someone like you.”
The healer casually walks in a second later while Hermione is nearly screaming in pain.
“But you spent the night with him.”
Draco is lying with his head on my shoulder later that night and rubbing his belly.
“How was dinner?”
When we step into the elevator it is empty. We’re alone. Suddenly the atmosphere around us is charged. It may be the close proximity and the enclosed space but it feels exhilarating. My heart races and my breathing increases. He is fully gazing at me now and his pupils have grown dark. I stop breathing and bit my lip.
“Leo. Leo James Potter.” Draco says quietly, still looking at our son. Then he looks up at me, smiles and starts crying again. I hug him close while crying a bit myself.
“What?” I have his full, undivided attention. I swallow.
“You’ve not eaten very much.”
I am only at that moment aware I was even biting my lip and I gasp softly, releasing it. That has to be the sexiest thing anyone has ever said to me! My heart beat starts thumping, my pants get tighter, and I’m pretty sure I’m panting. Fuck. I am a mess with just a few words. He hasn’t even touched me and I squirm in my seat.
Taking a deep breath, he kisses my forehead and leaves. He strolls purposefully down the hallway as he runs his hand through his hair. Glancing back before he turns the corner, he smiles his breathtaking smile. My answering smile is weak, completely dazzled by him, and I’m reminded once more of Icarus soaring too close to the sun. I close the door after he turns the corner, out of view. I have an overwhelming urge to cry; a sad and lonely melancholy grips and tightens around my heart. Dashing back to my bedroom, I close the door and lean against it, trying to rationalise my feelings. I can’t. Sliding to the floor, I put my head in my hands as my tears begin to flow.
“My lips are sealed! I won't tell anyone.” Nia says and smiles wide, showing a lot of white beautiful teeth. Nia was a very beautiful girl and didn’t really belong in a small country town like this. I wonder where she grew up?
“My father made me learn.” He says then and gets up. “Right, let's get to work then.” He changes the subject and accio’s the cleaning things from the other room.
“I’ve got to head to the shops for nappies and things, do you guys want anything?” Ron asks them, still standing.
“I- I thought I was the only one to have those..those episodes.” He puts his hands up to cover his face and starts crying much more. Me and Hermione share a look and I carefully get up while she leads him to the sofa.
“Where you keep leaving them! In the middle of the kitchen!” He shouts down.
We get to Andy’s, and Teddy is as excited as ever to see us. He’s practically jumping off the walls when we tell him we can take him to the park today. His hair is changing all sorts of colours and he’s jumping up and down clapping. Andromeda silently mouths a ‘thank you’ to us and goes to get his coat. When he’s calmed down a bit his hair stops changing colour and goes back to the blue he likes so much, thanks to Ginny and Luna.
Oh shit. What is that all about? I pick up my fork and eat slowly, trying to chew. I must remember not to put so much on my plate if he’s going to be weird about food. His expression softens as I carefully make my way through my breakfast. I note that he cleans his plate.
“What?” he asks.
“It’s a laptop from Harry.”
I’m in my bedroom alone. How? Why? I sit bolt upright, shocked…..wow. I cast a scourgify at my cum stained boxers and then cast a tempus. It’s eight in the morning. I put my head in my hands. Maybe it was those oysters and my internet research manifesting itself into my dreams. It’s bewildering. I’m too old for this. Wet dreams are for teenagers.
Oh….this is beyond weird. Luna claps her hands.
“Thank you.” He rolls his eyes at me.
We apparate there and once again Draco is sick. He comes back over when he's done and looks awful.
“Draco, it's okay. Just breath. Feel my hand? I’m here. Everything’s okay.” Katie must pick up on what’s happening because she jumps into action.
“Yes, please. If you have some.”
“Sorry grandma!” He says looking guilty behind him, then he looks at us. “Thank you so much uncle Harry! And thank you so much Uncle Draco!” Then he turns around and runs to Andy to show her his new broom.
“I don’t know. Just holding Lucy has brought all these questions to my mind.” He’s calmed down enough now to sound normal ish but he is still crying.
“Well this muggle woman asked if the kids were adopted or surrogate. And I said surrogate. I couldn’t tell her you had them, but I didn’t want to say they weren’t ours at all with adoption.” He shuts me up with another kiss and then chuckles.
“I love you to Dray.”
“Anyway, I’m angry at you!” I tell her and cross my arms over my chest to make a point.
“Fancy going to see Andromeda and Teddy?” Draco asks as he’s packing up the last of the things.
Bloody hell….why is he so worried about my broom? It has given me 10 years of loyal service, and Blaise has always been on hand to maintain it for me. Harry’s next email is from today.
This house just seemed empty and hollow now after imagining a life with Draco and our family. I didn’t even make it to the couch before i started crying again, I really don’t know what I’d do if this was it for us. I love that man so goddamn much! Maybe I have been working too much and spending too much time with friends rather than see him. But then again, he goes to see his friends when we could be spending time together, plus I’m allowed friends! He can't stop me from seeing then. But he hasn’t asked me to stop seeing them either. This is all my fault isn’t it? I need to give that house back and then go to Draco’s and tell him how sorry I am and how wrong I was to buy this house without asking him first. I was so wrapped up crying and arguing in my head that I didn’t realise how tired i was, and lying on the couch didn’t help that either. I was soon asleep in the living room, having not eaten since lunch and not feeling hungry in the slightest. I didn't even know what time it was but I guessed it must have been about 8pm.
“No I am not. How dare you say I’m lying.” He turns to face me with a hard face, totally closed off and the opposite of before. He’s still shaking slightly but maybe it’s from anger. I stand up to face him too.
“Three days, three hours. I get the impression you’re going to keep me exercised when I’m here.”
“No! It’s more likely to happen to me, you know, with all this muscle.” I joked and winked at him. I could tell he was trying not to laugh and so he turned round and crossed his arms.
“Harry, you really scared me. It’s been so long since you had one I didn’t know what to do.”
“Well, how was it? I couldn't stop thinking about you, after Theo left, that is.” She grins mischievously.
“I needed to discuss something with professor McGonagall and I thought I would drop in on you too. Hope that's okay?” I ask him and stroke fang. He’s gotten old and doesn’t jump up at me anymore.
“He’s sent me out here,” she continues.
20     The Safeword “Red” will be used to bring to the attention of the Dominant that the Submissive cannot tolerate any further demands. When this word is said, the Dominant’s actions will cease completely with immediate effect.
“Nine.”
I run into the bathroom and grab a very quick, very cold shower. Great, I’m going to look like a bloody mess with no sleep. That will for sure put Potter off me, if he even liked me to begin with.
“Yep but it won’t be for a few months yet, you can even ride them if you want.”
“Did you have similar discussions with, um…..the fifteen?”
15    The following service provisions have been discussed and agreed and will be adhered to by both parties during the Term. Both parties accept that certain matters may arise that are not covered by the terms of this contract or the service provisions, or that certain matters may be renegotiated. In such circumstances, further clauses may be proposed by way of amendment. Any further clauses or amendments must be agreed, documented, and signed by both parties and shall be subject to the fundamental terms set out under clauses 2-5 above.
I look at his hand and then at him and wow he is so young and attractive, very attractive. He is tall, with an unruly mess of black hair, and bright green eyes. He is very smartly dressed in a fine grey suit, white shirt, and a black tie. His eyes look at me and it takes me a moment to find my voice.
“Well sort off, she has her own floor in the house so she doesn’t have to be around us all the time.” I say to him and we both chuckle.
I let go of Teddy’s hand and open the door for him to go in first.
“May I sit?” he asks, his eyes now dancing with humour -
“Fly safely,” he says quietly.
Does the Submissive consent to:
Chapter 3 -past
“Teddy, do you want a glass of juice, water, or milk?” I ask him and head for the door.
“Let’s just say it's another grimmauld place and Draco’s not happy.”
“Yep. All by myself.” He says and gives the biggest smile. I remember his face back in the park and I smile sadly. Draco looks over and seems to sense I’m feeling low because he grabs my hand and squeezes lightly. I smile at him and between us we have a silent conversation saying that we will talk later about it.
Harry Potter
“Mr Goyle.” Potter offers his hand.
She raises her eyebrows.
“Yeah, my godson has gotten a degree. I am proud of you, Draco.” he says slowly in his deep voice.
May 26 17:22
2 days later and I’m lying on my couch drinking a bottle of fire whiskey. I don’t know what time it is and I don’t care to find out. Draco locked his floo and warded me from entering the manor. He won't answer any of my calls or texts or even owls. I may have lost him for good this time, so the only thing left to do is drink. I can hear a banging and distant shouting but I ignore it and turn the wireless up. Next thing, I hear the front door fly open and bang against the wall. Ron and Hermione run round the corner and skid to a halt. I just look at them and take another sip from the bottle.
“What is it?” he asks.
ignoring my emails?”
“Would you like a drink?” I blink at him. After last night? Is he trying to be funny? For a moment I think about asking for a margarita but I lose my nerve.
“No! Definitely not!” He says. I go downstairs to the floo.
Okay, I’ve seen enough.
“I have a family. I have a brother and a sister and two loving parents. I’m not interested in extending my family beyond that.”
“Relationship!” I squeal in a too high voice. I look around, slightly embarrassed but nobody is around. “Pansy! I barely know the guy.”
“Someone so...innocent, Draco. You know what I mean.” She says a little irritated. I flush at this.
“How did you find me?”
“Potter.” He snaps again. It must be habit.
After 2 hours at the park with Teddy and Draco we are finally back at ours. Andromeda offered to have us over for tea but she’s been having us over so much lately that we felt rather bad. So we decided to come back to grimmauld and spend some time relaxing. Which meant sitting on the sofa, watching soaps, and eating junk food.
“Never?” He whispers. I shake my head.
He smiles. “Squeamish?”
“For what?” He frowns. He still hasn’t taken his hands off me.
I eventually straighten up but don’t stop the tears from falling. I bend over and kiss Leo, then place my hand on the gravestone.
Fuck…. This sounds like it will be time consuming, humiliating, and painful.
“First for me, too,” he whispers, then smiles wickedly. “Bet you wish you were wearing your boxers right now,” he teases.
“What do you mean?” Realisation dawns. “You are
“Well I must be off now, got to go pack.”
“Do I have to?”
“Draco.” He muses. I lift my eyebrow in curiosity. “What happened in the elevator - it won’t happen again, well, not unless premeditated.”
“He came here to fuck me, that’s all.”
I stare at him. This man - sexually abused as an adolescent - his tone is so threatening.
We apparated in so we could surprise Teddy with his present. We have bought him his first broom. He always talks about brooms and how much he wants to ride one. I was going to buy him one last year but the guy in the shop said the children had to be 6, so I’ve waited all year to get him this.
I get furious all of a sudden and get up. I grab his coat and throw it in his face. Then I go over to the floo and shout my address. Andy tries saying something but I don’t hear it. I’m already home.
He looks down at the phone and smirks. He then puts it on speaker and sends a small smile my way.
“And a nice young man hasn’t swept you off your feet? I just don’t understand. You’re twenty-one, nearly twenty-two. You’re beautiful.” He runs his hand through his hair again.
His expression hardens. “Eat.” he says quietly, too quietly.
“Yes sure. I’ve heard a lot about you too.” Nia pulls back then and gets back to cleaning.
“She’s gone down to the great hall. She’s giving a speech, so she has to be there early.”
“Pans will be delighted - if we can find a photographer.” I smile broadly at him, so happy that Pansy will be happy. His lips part, almost like he’s taking a sharp intake of breath. He blinks at me and looks sort of lost. Shit….Harry Potter’s lost look.
“Yes oww!” I said while holding my head and trying to squint my eyes open. “It wasn’t my fault someone scared me awake, Hermione.” I grimaced at the pain then as I tried to scowl at her.
“What, Harry?” I snap at him as he continues not saying anything. I just want to go.
Harry Potter
“No….I don’t think I could ever get bored of this.” I murmur as we fly over a loch. After another minute he answers my question.
“What house were you in, Draco?” Luna asks innocently, distracting me from my jealous reverie.
Dear Mr Malfoy,
14    The Submissive will make himself available during the Allotted Times and agreed additional times at locations to be determined by the Dominant. The Dominant will ensure that all travel costs incurred by the Submissive for that purpose are met by the Dominant.
“I could hear you guys, that’s why I came down.” She says and huffs.
I am so proud of her at that moment, my errant thoughts of Harry pushed to one side. Even though I have heard her speech before, I listen carefully. She commands the room and takes her audience with her.
“I really wish you had worn a shirt, you're putting me off.” I huff and turn to go back inside. “No wait Harry please.”
He looks quizzically at me. “Why would you think that?” And immediately understands. “You think she traumatised me?”
“Yes.”
“Yes of course we do.” I tell her, because we do. Me and Draco are both off work for a couple of weeks and we don’t need to be anywhere. Nia signs and looks out the window.
“Pleaseee Harry. He doesn’t hate you, he just likes acting up for you specifically. You’re the only person I trust to look after crookshanks. Besides, Draco loves him, so just let him stay over and help.”
He blows very gently on one of them as his hand moves to the other, and his thumb slowly rolls the end of my nipple, elongating it. I groan, feeling the sweet sensation all the way to my groin and I thrust my hips. I can feel my boxers wet with precum. Oh, please, I beg internally as my fingers clasp the sheet tighter. His lips close around my other nipple, and when he tugs, I nearly cum.
“Baby’s looking very healthy, Draco. You’ve got nothing to worry about.” Katie said to Draco after finishing with the examination. We had seen another scan and Katie said she would print more pictures for us. “How are you feeling now?”
We have been walking for a bit and we come to an opening. In the middle is an old, but clean, looking motorbike. It's big and black and I don’t understand. This isn’t flying. It will take us all night to get to London on that thing.
“You, defying me.” He reaches down and cups my chin and plants a swift, sweet kiss on my lips as Weasley pulls up. He grabs my hand and leads me to the car.
“Anytime Harry, and you too Draco. Teddy would love to see you more often.”
I grab the box and the mail and head for the door. I turn the last of the lights out and say one last goodbye. To the house and to the ghosts who live there now. Then I close the door to my past and head to my future.
A little later on I go outside to check my greenhouse. As I’m coming back inside I hear a smash. I run into the kitchen and Hermione is holding her back. Then I see the smashed cup on the ground and spilt tea.
“That’s what you fly?” He’s appalled. Taking my hand, he leads me around the corner. “Is it flyable?” He’s glaring at me now.
“Did you undress me?” My cheeks heat. I don’t know where my jeans, socks, shoes, or jacket are.
“Promise you won't leave?” He pauses and asks.
“I heard he was gay,” I mutter.
“Hey little cherry. Your papa isn’t really dying but he would appreciate it if you stopped making him poorly. We both love you very much.” I lift his shirt and kiss his almost flat stomach. Draco smiles down to me and gives me a hand up.
“Ohhh.” She says as everything clicks. “Oh Harry I’m sorry. Why did he leave? He can't possibly think it's your fault?”
“Good. Email it to me. Anything to add?”
“So...what now Draco?” Blaise shouts over the noise.
“Can you just bare with me tonight?” He asks gently then, having calmed down. I nod my head. “Let’s just get through tonight please, I’m really sorry.” He genuinely sounds it and so I forget it all and we go back to the party.
I go straight to the manor but Draco has locked me out of his floo so I land in the sitting area. I give Narcissa quite a fright.
“Wow - Ethan! How lovely to see you. Severus, this is Ethan, Pansy’s brother. Ethan, this is my godfather, Severus Snape.” They shake hands, Severus coolly assessing Ethan.
“I’m sorry for shoving you Harry. This just really hurts.” She says as fast as she can through the pain.
“Dammit!” He swore while wiping his face again. “I don’t know why I’m crying, I don’t expect you to be here anymore. So why the hell am i crying! I just thought that today maybe you’d come straight from work because I called your office to tell you what i was making for tea and what time it’d be on the table,  but Ron said you’d already left. So i thought maybe you’d come straight here.” Draco sneered, although it was more of a sad sneer. I hugged him again and got down on my knees in front of him.
To the right of the door is a mahogany chest of drawers, drawers slimmer than normal as if to hold specimens in an old museum. It takes my attention for a moment and I wonder what is actually contained in them. Do I even want to know? On the opposite wall is a rack that holds canes of varying lengths and widths.
“Good day, sir.” It says and disappears.
What…..oh fuck…..but…..I was…..that’s not fair.
“Hey” I said gently so as not to startle him. It didn’t work though and he jumped. “Draco she doesn’t hate you, and I’m still upset you’d think that.”
“Various things, but it boils down to…” He pauses, struggling to find the words I think. “Incompatibility.” He shrugs,
We had almost finished the first room now and only had a last coat of paint to do. We decided to do everything white until we have furniture and know what colours we are going with. I was on the ladder doing the ceiling and Draco was doing wherever he could reach. I could tell Draco was getting tired and bored, so I turned the wireless on that we had brought from home. A weird sisters song came on and I could tell that Draco was dying to sing along. So I started singing (off key of course) in hopes he would join in. He didn’t but he started swaying his hips a bit. I got down off the ladder with my paint brush and pulled him close.
“We’re seeing a mediwitch at 10 past 4. It's going to be okay.” He just smiles sadly and returns to staring at the sky.
“oh , baby. I love that you stretch so well for me.”
“Yesss!” Just then, Andy comes in with the tea tray.
“The nitty-gritty.” I take another large sip of wine. It really is delicious. Harry Potter does know his wine well. I remember the last sip of wine he gave me, in my bed. I blush at the intrusive thought.
“But-“
“Don’t tell me, you’ve managed to not get kicked out for another week.” I joke and he scowls playfully at me.
“More drinks!” Pansy shouts and gets a roar from the crowd.
“Let me go get the camera.” Draco whispers and heads for the pram.
“Finally got me where you want me then?” I laughed some more and he made a surprised laugh sort of noise.
“The pleasure has been all mine.” He says, making sure to stay polite.
The waiter comes to the door, and Harry subtly nods, permitting the waiter to clear our table.
The elevator stops and the business men get out but we still have one floor to go.
“Thank you uncle Harry, thank you Draco!” He jumps up and down and grabs our hands to try to pull us inside. “Come on, come on. I wanna show you what grandma got me!” He says, but we stand still and eventually he turns around.
Feeling better about myself, I tie my hair up in a bun and head for the door. I take a deep breath and open it, ready to face Mr Confusing. To my relief he isn’t in the bedroom. I look around for my jacket but can’t find it. I hope he didn’t vanish that too. I take another deep breath and go into the living room. It is huge and is overflowing with wealth.
We go through Hermione and Ron’s presents then and they get a lot of the same stuff but in girly colours.
“Hey Draco, how you feeling?” Ginny asks and sits on the end of the bed. He glares at her before speaking.

I apparate to Grimmauld because I don’t know what else to do. He must have gone back to the manor, and I haven’t been there yet, not since the war. We haven’t tried again since my panic attack in the kitchen. But I need to see Draco right now and tell him I love him too. Otherwise he’s going to be overthinking things and he’s going to get embarrassed and never want to see me again. Or he might not have even meant what he said and now he thinks that I think he loves me when….Okay maybe I was over thinking now. Still, I need to go get him. I need to go to Malfoy manor. Okay, I can do this. I’m Harry Potter, the boy who lived twice, the saviour of the wizarding world, blah blah blah. I’m still just a person, I can’t do this.
“Yeah sounds good. Now we just have to choose which bedroom is which.” He says and stops at the top of the stairs.
“Weasley.” He calls, making me jump slightly. Weasley comes back up the corridor. “Can you help Mr Malfoy's friends pack their equipment away and inform them that he is coming for coffee with me.”
Later that night we tuck Teddy in bed after giving him a bath with bubble horses. Then Draco goes to feed Leo and I read Teddy a story.
When we got to the cafe, I opened the door for Draco to go in first. To which he just laughed and shoved me through. We sat at the same table we sat at last time by the window. I looked over and saw Nia chatting with another customer. Good, she was here and by the way she was smiling at us she didn’t have a clue we were on to her. After the customer had left Nia came over to us.
He sighs heavily, sadly.
15.5: This whole discipline clause. I’m not sure I want to be whipped, flogged, or corporally punished. I am sure this would be in breach of clauses 2 - 5. And also “for any other reason.” That’s just mean - and you told me you weren’t a sadist.
“I’m a…. hufflepuff!” She shouts and once again everyone cheers.
The rest of the night is spent relaxing on the sofa just the two of us without a care in the world about what crookshanks was destroying.
“Why have you never had vanilla sex before? Have you always done...erm, what you’ve done?” I ask, intrigued.
Fine.
“Great thanks.” She smiles.
“They have an excellent wine cellar here,” he says. Putting his elbows on the table, he steeples his fingers in front of his mouth, his eyes alive with some unreadable emotion. And there it is…. that familiar pull and charge of magic. I shift uncomfortably under his scrutiny, my heart palpitating. I must keep my cool.
It’s been 2 months since the end of the war. People are grieving for their lost loved ones. Shopkeepers are having to start from scratch with their businesses. Hogwarts is trying to be rebuilt. And children are learning to grow up without their parents. This includes my 3 month old godson Teddy Lupin.
“Now we have.” Seamus says while not taking his eyes off Dean. Hermione sits down at the end of the table next to Ron and turns to me. Everyone has again taken up their conversations but I look back at Hermione.
Mr Malfoy,
“It’s big.” He agrees, and his eyes seem to glow with amusement. I take a gulp of wine.
I move my hand up and down with a firm grip. He closes his eyes again, and his breath hitches in his throat. When he opens them again, his gaze is scorching green.
“Hmmm” is all he can manage. I accio the lube wandless and wordlessly and cover my fingers. By the time I had all three fingers in, Draco was a mess underneath me, moaning and wreathing about.
“Yeah sure. You’ll have to put a glamour on though.” I tell him and he nods in agreement.
“Of course I have!” I try my best to look affronted. Okay….maybe twice.
“I can tell.” He laughs a little. I pull back a bit, embarrassed but he reaches for my face and brings it back down to his. The kiss is nice and gets heated rather quickly. After a couple of minutes we are rubbing up against each other and moaning. We’re breathing heavily and take a breath from kissing.
“Okay.” Think of them as uniform.
“Discipline. There’s a very fine line between pleasure and pain, Draco. They are two sides of the same coin, one not existing without the other. I can show you how pleasurable pain can be. You don't believe me now, but this is what I mean about trust. There will be pain, but nothing that you can’t handle. Again, it comes down to trust.
“Eat!”
Draco Malfoy
He just shrugs noncommittally.
“They live in Wiltshire.” I simply say.
“Three months?” I’m feeling railroaded. I take another large sip of wine and treat myself to another oyster. I could learn to like these.
“Mrs Robinson was fond of dancing.”
“Pansy, how could you out me to Severus?” I hiss at the first opportunity we won’t be overheard.
“Merlin, yes please.”
“You are just…. the best!” We laugh and go to get ready for our first outing with Leo.
The power of speech has deserted me. I want the ground to swallow me up. Harry puts his arm around me, his thumb skimming up under my untucked shirt and caressing my hip, before his hand clasps my shoulder.
“That’s a lovely thing to do Harry and Draco.” Andy says and smiles at us.
We keep walking and by the time I look back up, we are back near the castle. Well our time together is almost up and I have completely blown it. I wonder if he has someone already.
“Let’s see if we can make you come like this.” he whispers, continuing his slow, sensual assault. My nipples bear the delicious brunt of his deft fingers and lips, setting alight every single nerve ending so that my whole body sings with sweet agony. He just doesn't stop.
“Three oysters, four bites of cod, and one asparagus stalk, no potatoes, no nuts, no olives, and you’ve not eaten all day. You said I could trust you.”
“Well she shouldn’t have said it. It’s a naughty word. Don’t let your grandma hear you say that.”
“What? What’s up there?”
Thank Merlin I didn’t have an early shift at the pub because I’m pretty sure I was still drunk when I woke up this morning and Blaise had taken my last sobering potion because he did have an early shift. Instead, I took a shower and drank about 3 cups of coffee.
“You look stunning.” he murmurs as he leans down to briefly kiss my cheek. “Plum, Mr Malfoy. I approve” Taking my arm, he leads me to a secluded booth and signals for the waiter.
“Bye uncle Hawwy. Bye Dwaco.” He runs over to Draco and gives him a hug too. The next thing to happen is just the cutest and my heart nearly explodes. Teddy’s hair starts to turn the whitish blond of Draco’s. Draco smiles down at Teddy and scrubs his hair.
“Sure. I'm at work. Can you make it here for, say, twelve?”
“Yes I do.” He says and winks at me. I laugh and move the ladders so I can start painting the ceiling.
He motions for the waitress and asks for the check. Once he’s paid, he stands and holds out his hand.
“Of course you do. Is there anything you can’t do?”
Severus walks besides me as we head down to the great hall. We follow the stream of wizards and witches gowned in their black robes.
“If you would all like to look up, the fireworks will start any minute. Hermione, Draco, who wants to go first?” Draco just shakes his head and Hermione giggles and grabs Ron's hand.
“What? Why?!” She sulks and sits down next to me on our sofa.
“Nia!” He runs and hugs her while me and Andy stare on in amazement.
“Can I modify to say that you will eat at least three meals a day?”
“We’re both a mess. I just had a panic attack because you walked out our front door.” I smirk at him and try to get him to crack a smile. He almost did but then his face went serious and he looked down at our untwined hands.
I shake my head...not for food anyway. “It’s a very big place you have here.”
“It was good, Pans. very good, I think.” I say quietly, trying to hide my embarrassed tell-all smile.
“What are you doing? I need that to go home.” He smirked and turned around to face me. I think he realised then how close I’d gotten and blushed slightly.
I frown. Does he want me to stay another night?
“I didn't want to. She was all I wanted, needed. And besides, she’d have beaten the shit out of me.” He smiles fondly at the memory.
His words are my undoing, tipping me over the precipice. Cumming untouched, my body convulses around him, and loudly call out a garbled version of his name into the mattress. Harry follows with two sharp thrusts, and he freezes, pouring himself into me as he finds his release. He collapses on top of me, his face in my hair.
“Merlin.” he groans, and closes his eyes again.
“Oh yes,” I respond sweetly.
“Would you now, Mr Malfoy?” he murmurs dryly. He leans down and kisses me very gently at the corner of my mouth. “Demanding little thing, aren’t you? Turn on your front.”
“Well, we’ll speak to her then. And see what she’s up to.” I roll my eyes.
“I don’t think we are telling anyone yet and I don’t mind it being our secret.”
“No you won't be able to. chéri is only small, I can just feel sort of a fluttering inside. Merlin Harry, this is amazing.” I smile down at him and can see it’s making him happy so I carry on rubbing. “I think she knows it’s you, somehow.”
He removes my shoes and my socks efficiently and slowly peels off my joggers. Oh -
He shakes his head in irritation and takes off his jacket.
“I’m always good!” He huffs and turns his back to me. I chuckle and grab hold of him. Then I start tickling him again and he breaks out in hysterics.
Half an hour later we are all back at Andromeda’s having a cup of tea while I’m waiting for Draco to arrive. Hermione went home about 10 minutes ago so she could do some reading before Ron got home from work. She rarely gets days to herself lately, with working so hard at the ministry. She’s going to be a great minister of magic some day. She works so hard and tries to include everyone in everything and promote fairness. She’s already working on proper work contracts for house elf’s and equality for all magical creatures. She really is amazing.
“Yeah I’m fine. Floo is better than apparation but still bad.” He half heartedly chuckles. I pull him into a hug.
“What if he doesn’t make it?” She looks like she’s about to cry so I grab her face and speak slowly to her.
She sits, as does the audience, and McGonagall rises and introduces Harry ….
“Yes, come in.” I hear her voice say. So I open the door and walk into her office.
“Fuck off, Pansy. You know I blush all the time. It’s an occupational hazard with me. Now stop being so ridiculous.” I turn and snap at her. She blinks at me and looks surprised. I rarely speak like that to Pansy. “He’s just so...intimating, that’s all.”
His hand moves down, skimming my waist, over my hip, and down my thigh to the back of my knee. He pushes my knees up higher, and my breath hitches…..what’s he doing now? He shifts so he’s between my legs, pressed against my back, and his hand travels up my thigh to my arse. He caresses my cheek slowly, and then trails his finger down between my cheeks.
He carries on speaking but I zone out. Did he just say all night?!
“You are a lifesaver Draco! Thank you so much. Here.” She passes me some parchment and quill. “These are my questions and all you have to do is read them out to him. Maybe jot some notes down but make sure to record it anyway.” She says while wiping her nose on the back of her hand and passing me the recorder thing. It’s muggle and Pansy swears by it; she says it’s saved her life more times than she can count and that we wizards should really start looking more highly on muggle technology.
“You could be dessert,” he murmurs suggestively.
e strokes my cock with his other hand and spreads the precum. "See how much your body likes this, Draco. You’re so hard just for me.”  There is awe in his voice. He moves his fingers in and out in quick succession.
Sometimes I think maybe there is something wrong with me. Maybe I’ve spent too long reading romance novels and now my ideals and expectations are far too high for any guy to overcome. Nobody has made it so far.
Pansy’s phone rings. It’s Theo. pansy winks at me and skips off to her bedroom like she’s fourteen. I know that she should be writing her valedictorian speech, but it seems Theo is more important. What is it about the Potter men? What is it that makes them totally distracting, all-consuming, and irresistible? I take another slug of wine.
Sev raises his eyebrows ever so slightly and the corner of his lip quirks up  - and off they go, talking potions. In fact, I soon feel surplus to requirements. He’s charming the pants off my godfather. His power knows no bounds. I excuse myself to go and find Pansy.
Always start with Wikipedia.
“You’re very young to have achieved such an empire both in the muggle and wizarding worlds. To what do you owe your success?” I look back up at him and he looked a bit disappointed but smiles anyway, although it doesn’t reach his eyes.
“Well, when you’ve had sex, was there anything that you didn’t like doing?”
“What happened?” Should I tell her? Can I tell her? Would Draco mind? But Draco isn’t here and I need Hermione to help me.
“Yeah I suppose that's what your family does. Fine, you can tell Ron. But I want to wait till next week to tell everyone else okay?” He pleads to me.
“Draco?! What’s wrong? Are you okay? Is the baby okay?” I ask him in quick succession. He just nods though and keeps crying. I get down on my knees in front of him and put my hand on his shoulder. “Dray?”
“Hermione, what’s the issue?” he snaps. He listens, watching me, eyes speculative, as I stand in the middle of the huge room wondering what to do with myself, feeling extraordinarily self-conscious and out of place.
“Your next point I mentioned earlier. You can walk away any time, Draco. I won’t stop you. If you go, however - that’s it. Just so you know.”
“Just a local quidditch pitch I know for us non professional types.”
“Okay.” Is all I say and he smiles at me because he knows that he doesn’t need to make an argument. He knows I want to know just as much as him.
“Potter.” He snaps.
“Did you apply to my company like I suggested?”
Sorry again guys, I know it's late. Hope you enjoy it anyway and thank you for all the kudos and comments! x
“Yes.” It’s a plea.
“What are you so excited about?” She asked Teddy while pouring our drinks.
Just then, something Sirius said comes to me. ‘We’ve all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on.’ And he was right. Malfoy clearly had good in him, he was feeding Teddy and helping Andy. Maybe he was changing.
“Because you aren’t a child, just put your things away!” He huffs and finishes putting Leo in his pram. “Did you get the wipes?” I sigh and head back upstairs for the wipes.
Weasley, or Ron as Mrs Potter called him, appears from….where?
“Of course!”
“Pansy.” Harry says and gives her a polite nod and then glares at Theo. Theo grins back and gets up to give me a hug.
My mouth drops open.
idea of a joke?”
“I'll forgive you if you forgive me.” I joke with him and give him a tiny smirk.
“These are the rules. They may be subject to change. They form part of the contract, which you can also have. Read these rules and let’s discuss.”
Here is my list of issues. I look forward to discussing them more fully at dinner on Wednesday.
“Nia darling, would you sit with us a minute?”  He asked in his nicest voice.
Weasley is hovering in the background.
“You still need to speak with McGonagall.” Draco says to me and smirks. Dammit, I forgot about that.
The photo shoot starts and my dreams come true. I get to stand and watch Potter from a distance and not in a creepy way because I’m supposed to be here. This goes on for about 20 minutes and our eyes keep making contact. Each time I blush and tear my gaze away….for about 20 seconds before I end up looking back up.
We are all sat down in the front room now, Draco having finished his sandwich and me having got everyone a drink.
20 minutes later a grey looking Draco comes out of the room, arms filled with potions and pamphlets, followed by Katie.
“I can’t wait.”
“So? Have you told him yet?” Hermione asks me from where she’s sitting on the bench. She had a day off and decided to come with me and Teddy to the park. Currently I was pushing Teddy on the baby swing. Teddy was 2 and a half already and looking more and more like his parents everyday. It still hurt a bit to look at him but everyday it got a bit better.
“Please don't be mad at me,” I whisper.
“It’s a long story, but I’m willing to tell you if you have the time.”
“I want to touch you.” I breathe.
“You got lucky.” Draco says to her.
“Oh?” I don’t understand.
“James was your daddy’s name.” Teddy says and sits on my knee. I smile and nod at him.
I go to my desk and pour some of the potion I’ve been working on into a vial. I hand it to her and a glass of water and she smiles at me, the best she can in her situation, and willingly swallows the potion down.
I frown, not understanding.
“Hello Draco, how are you dear?” Andromeda says as soon as she spots Draco.
“I’m sure he’ll be better when we tell him about those horses we are going to get.” I say cheerfully trying to get a smile out of him.
Today was going to be another hard day. We still had to finish the dining room and talk to Nia, if she would let us, and get started on the next room. Draco’s feeling quite tired still, so has promised to take it easy today and no heavy magic.
“It may take a moment for the results. If your stomach glows yellow, it means you are pregnant. If it glows purple it could mean something serious and more spells would need to be performed. If it glows green, then nothing is wrong there.”
“Not me, that’s for bloody sure.” I chuckle.
“Yes to our agreement. To being mine. Please, Draco.” he whispers pleading, emphasising the last word and my name. He kisses me again, sweetly, passionately, before he stands back and stares at me, blinking slightly. He takes my hand and leads me back to his bedroom, leaving me reeling, so I follow meekly. Stunned. He really wants this.
“How do you know he broke things off? Did he tell you?” Hermione questions him. I hadn’t told him so how the hell did he know.
“I need to tell Pans.”
“That was a bad move malfoy.” Ron was saying.
“That was…” I couldn’t even finish that sentence and just rubbed the back of my neck in embarrassment.
I frown as he hands me my degree.
“I miss you guys everyday, and I wish you were here to meet Leo.” I hiccup from crying and put my head down with my hand still on the stone. “I hope you're proud.” I whisper. Draco places his hand on my back and then whispers to me.
“Well we were trying to be quiet for the new baby, well done mum. Made him cry already.” George says coming in with Freddie on his shoulders again.
"It is not
That hadn't been too bad of a conversation between them, so he felt rather good about it. He couldn't get over Potter's arms though! One thing he hated was not being able to make sense of something. He truly despised being ignorant. Especially where the speccy git was concerned.
: Well, George stays at the shop in Diagon Alley, or sometimes he stays at the one in Hogsmeade. Percy's got a flat somewhere in London. Charlie decided to go back to Romania, says he's a man of habit and doesn't like change much. Ginny stays over more at (incoherent language)
Draco let out a breath he didn't know he'd been holding. He really wished Harry could be here. At least the man could put things in perspective and at least calm Draco's nerves.
but she and Draco ended up together. Either way, they would both have been given the poison."
For a second, Harry saw something spark in his friend's eye. He realized it was gratitude.
. Could it be? Could Potter be hiding much more than himself behind his wards?
Harry knew why Ron was so worried about his wife. After all, no one was likely to forget the difficult delivery of their son, who had come out prematurely after only six months. The Healers had told Ron that the early labor had been a common occurrence for first timers, but they did warn them against unnecessary levels of stress in case they wanted to try for another child in the future. Hermione had then been showered with much care and attention from all around, and her husband had nursed her back to health. In no time, she was back on her feet, and back to scaring half the members of the Legislative Council into thinking straight.
. My magical intent has been the same, and everyone else's wards have remained consistent. We checked," he added with a wry smile. "Ginny has been away for long periods of time for the last few years, so why should her privacy wards fail only now?"
Harry let the change of topic go. Ginny had always thought that he would want to be in charge of his life the moment things settled after the War. To be honest, though, Harry had wanted stability. He wanted a home. He wanted something permanent and reliable. The
"Okay," the Auror said cheerfully, putting James down into his pen and then rushing to the fire. "Remember to keep your voice down, alright?" he called behind him, "I’ll be back real quick!"
"You could take a turn at melancholy, too."
Harry interrupted. "I'm used to you calling at midnight, as I'm sure you're quite used to me returning the favor. Why should early mornings be any different? Now, spill."
Harry had just settled down into his most worn-down couch with book in hand when the Floo went off. Groaning with frustration, he waved his hand to allow the call, and quite appropriately sputtered when he saw the blond in his fire.
“Oohhh Harry! Draco, hello dears. I’m so sorry! Draco, well done sweetie! Congratulations. Let’s have a look at him then.” She says and comes over, stroking Teddy on the cheek.
“....your body gives you away. You are fidgeting, you’re flushed, and your breathing has changed.”
“Well, I thought I should come and remind you how nice it was knowing me.”
Almost instantaneously there is a response.
“That’s what I was thinking.” I tell her and look to Luna for an input.
“Thank you Luna, I’m sorry for freaking out.” I let her go and she just shrugs and smiles.
“Eat, Draco. You didn't eat last night.”
“Great, come on through.”
“Fank you hermy.” He says grabbing the food and toddling over to the duck. I quickly keep to his side to make sure he doesn’t fall. He stops close to them and sprinkles some food onto the grass. They gladly eat it and wait for more. Hermione comes over and puts her arm through mine and I sign deeply knowing what’s coming.
Shit. My cheeks heat once more and I try to change the subject.

The Three Broomsticks is packed with students who have just finished their exams. It is loud and hectic. Blaise joins us but he doesn’t graduate till next year. He’s always in the mood for a party though and keeps buying pitchers of margaritas for us all. I keep thinking I shouldn’t have my next drink, but then have it anyway. What the hell, it’s a celebration.
“I’m going to start on the music room.” He shouts from the hall. “Harry, tell Nia the good news.” She turns around and her face lights up then.
“Pancakes, bacon, and eggs?”
“Thanks! Hermione dropped some extra books off a few days ago and I’ve been reading up on how to correctly cast spells and charms, among other things.”
When I arrive back at the castle I ring Blaise on my way back to the room and explain the situation.
I shrug apologetically.
“Yes.” He says, his face impassive as always.
“Yes ma’am.” I say and give her a hug.
Another week, another chapter.
Harry presses his mouth into a thin line but doesn’t say anything more about it.
“Probably not what he was thinking. But all I could hear was fat, and ugly, and…. different. I don’t want to be the one that people stare at again. It just took me back to the war, and I don’t want to go back there.” He is crying now, so I wrap my arm around him and pull him close.
I feign innocence. “I’m just finishing my food, Mr Potter.”
It’s dark outside by now so the first thing I see are the fairy lights hanging everywhere. The back garden is huge, it has a patio of about 15 metres out though and then grass. The patio is completely clean now, the outdoor furniture has been put up. Which includes an outdoor table and chairs, just outside the doors. A double swing chair closer to the grass and the shed in the corner. And 4 sunbeds with an umbrella in the middle of then, which are lined against the grass to the left. I look over to the two nearest trees and see a hammock attached too. Then immediately to my right I see a built in floor level fireplace with built in seats. I look at Nia with amazement and she points over to the grass. We go over and exactly in the middle close to the patio is a little apple tree with bricks surrounding it. And engraved in them is ‘Norte coeur’.
May 24 00:07
“That’s if you want to, I mean, I don't want to push my luck.”
“Merlin Harry, why didn’t you tell us!” Angelina says and lets go of Draco so he can eat.
“Not at all Harry, come in.” Hermione says as she gets up to clear the dishes.
“So Draco, you may start getting back ache more often, you may get pains in your stomach, headaches, nosebleeds, sore breasts, dizziness, feeling hot, and leg cramps. I'll give you a leaflet and if you are worried about anything then just call in and see me anytime.” She hands him some papers and then jumps, “oh! I almost forgot. Do you guys want to hear the baby’s heartbeat?” We both nod with wide eyes and Draco lies back down. Katie points her wand and mumbles a quick spell and then suddenly there is a thumping noise all around.
