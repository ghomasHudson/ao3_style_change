Harry gave him a confused look and tilted his head to the side. Draco could see the moment he got the joke, as Harry turned bright red, and Draco prepared for the telling off he was about to receive. But as he watched, Potter’s face lit up, he opened his mouth and let out the biggest and best belly laugh Draco had ever heard. Potter beamed at him, and Draco beamed back, it was kind of spectacular... then Draco remembered where he was and suddenly became aware of time.
Harry just whimpered and buried his head back into his arms.  Both his face and bottom had a beautiful flush, and he was panting in little, quick shallow breaths.
There wrapped around Harrys tiny limp cock (he was a grower not a shower ok) was a bright pink silicone cock cage, with a cute but sturdy gold padlock hanging from the top. The cock ring portion was tight and held Harry’s testicles firmly against the little cock cage, inside of the cage Harrys cock gave a little twitch of exasperation. There was a long oval opening at the tip which Harry surmised let him pee out of the cage, but other wise it seemed pretty secure.
MANCUSA had put a magic block over all gambling areas in the US as far back as the 1920’s, because gambling and magic just didn’t mix. Let’s just say, the odds just didn’t go the right way when wizards were involved. This was the reason why Harry had chosen Vegas for his vacation:  wizards and witches avoided Las Vegas, and Harry wanted to avoid witches and wizards. It was a no brainer.
He quickly peaked out the peephole, but there was no one there. Shit, he had no magic and a fluffy robe was the only thing he was wearing. He pulled a hanger out of the closet for protection and opened the door slowly. There, sprawled on the floor, surrounded by fries and two hamburger buns, was Draco Malfoy in a Wynn Resort uniform.  His blond hair was cut short, and he still was thin but looked much healthier than he did when Harry spoke at his trial. At the moment he looked pale, a lump swelling on his forehead, but he still had a bit of a golden tan. Yup, Draco Malfoy, all long and lean, still elegant even in his faint.
“Shit, I have to get back downstairs, my shift is probably over. I need to punch out or I’ll get into trouble,” Draco said as he struggled to his feet.
“What the fuck!” Harry exclaimed struggling off of Draco”s lap to land in a heap on the floor, his legs spread wide so he could see his precious privates.
Harry gasped when he saw the room. It was huge, bigger, brighter and cleaner than than any room in Number 12 Grimmauld Place. It had floor to ceiling windows across one wall that looked out onto the city. All neon and plastic, Las Vegas seemed to stretch out flat until it ran into a rim crusty brown mountains. There were palm trees and plants between buildings, but as you looked out to where the buildings ended, everything beyond was baked and brown. The heat shimmered off the tops of the buildings, and everything looked impossibly bright, as though the sun had come too close to the earth.
Harry groaned low and long and tried to push his bottom up to make Draco’s fingers drive deeper.  Draco held Harry’s hips still with one arm and started to pump his fingers in and out, first slow and steady, but then he became quicker, and he added one more finger. With each in and out he bumped over that pleasure spot deep inside Harry.  When Harry started humping in earnest against Draco’s thighs,  Draco just clucked his tongue disapprovingly and spread his legs apart to take the friction away.  Harry continued to hump, but there was only air to hump against.
Harry froze for a second, shocked,  his legs tightened and then relaxed, he gave a little whimper…”please Daddy”
Draco felt Harrys muscles let go of some tension, but he continued with his explanation, “And Harry darling, think how pretty you will look in panties without that swollen cock in the way.” That last statement sealing the deal, Harry gave a sigh of resignation.
Harry’s mouth opened and closed wordlessly, blushing to his toes he just stared at Draco who was suddenly so concerned he had broken Harry, he pulled him into his lap and tucked his head under Dracos chin.
“ I know you will be after this”  Draco replied, and picking up the small paddle off the table and continued to spank.
Draco stomped over, and took the phone from Harry, glancing at the photo of the blond man on the phone. He glared at Harry for a second, that Malfoy eyebrow in a menacing arch, then dropped the phone into his pocket.
“Be still Harry”, Draco said sternly, “you deserve this” continuing with the fast sharp spanks till Harry was squeaking, and gasping with the heat,
Draco looked at the floor, and a little feeling of deja-vu swept over him. He let out a giggle and a rather unbecoming snort; the more he tried to hold it back, the more he snorted.
Draco walked past Harry and disappeared into the sitting room down the hall from he kitchen. Harry could hear him moving about and also the soft thuds of him setting something down on a table. Soon he came back to Harry, bent down and brushed the hair off of his forehead, Harry leaned into his touch.
Harry stood up and put his hands out as if to spot Draco in case he went tumbling back to the floor. Trying to master some dignity, Draco paused,  straightened out his clothes, and handed the flannel back.
He didn’t raise his voice, but Harry knew he was in trouble and quickly stripped off his shorts, pants and t-shirt, and dropped to his knees right there on the kitchen floor, his eyes on the ground in shame.  Now Harry might of felt sorry about disobeying and a little fearful of what was coming next, but his cock who was always brave and bold, was excited, it grew even harder, the head became tight like a shiny mushroom, and then a single drop of precum slid out of its little mouth and dripped down it’s length and dropped on the floor.
The sharp tone was gone, and he quietly brushed Harrys bottom lip with his thumb and asked “Harry what rules did you break?”
“Ahh there’s the Malfoy I know and, I mean…ummm sure...” Harry stuttered and blushed…. Adorable, thought Draco and then shook his head a little at the thought, which sent him reeling and clutching at his head again as he stumbled out the door with a hamburger patty squished in the treads of his shoe.
There was no discussion before the first slap, and Harry jerked in surprise.  Draco determined to make a point continued to spank Harry’s butt with steady, heavy slaps to the bottom of each cheek, first five to one side, then five to the next side.  They weren’t unbearably hard, but soon Harry was squirming from the sting, wincing and gripping Draco’s leg tight. Eventually Draco stopped and rested for a second. His hand rubbing the red that he had caused to Harry’s behind.
“Thank you, Potter,” he said in a stilted voice and started towards the door, a little dizzy but feeling more in control. He spotted the empty plate and the lid filled with ruined food. “I’ll bring you back some dinner after I punch out, and you can tell me why the most powerful wizard in the world would come to a magicless desert for vacation, okay? “ He asked, looking Potter full in the face for the first time and giving him the Malfoy smirk.
Harry gasped again as  Draco twisted his fingers and sought out that swollen pillow of pleasure inside Harry.  Then a determined Draco wanting to hear that “Daddy” again, a word that Harry only used when he was slipping into that perfect sub space, began to really put some focus on that spot.
“You sure do keep your room neat for a guy,” Bryan pointed out, and Harry was surprised to notice he was blushing.
“I should have told Teddy to get an extra blanket for you. Maybe the Medi-witch has some. I wonder where I could find her?”
“I appreciate the offer, Millie, and I do wish I could have worked with you. But potions isn’t my calling. It never has been.”
“Puzzles have always been Ron’s strong suit,” Hermione said fondly. “Though he’s not patient like you.”
“Does that mean you want to have another date?” Harry asked, his heart pounding in anticipation. Malfoy seemed to relax again, and gave Harry a soft smile.
“I think that’s really great,” Harry said gently. “I find people tend to take their parents for granted.”
I’d say I’m worried about going too far, but I don’t think I have. This feels right to me. I hope you feel the same.
“As if you would know what being married is like,” Agent Phi grumbled, putting an arm around Agent Eta’s waist. Agent Eta smiled at Agent Phi, and the display of affection made Agent Delta’s heart swell. They couldn’t begin to describe the feeling of relief now that they were free to do the same.
She smiled at that, and he gestured to the ground next to him. She sat down and started rummaging through her bag, before pulling out a small box of pastries.
Wallackson court was an old wizarding community, full of beautiful homes. They weren’t quite as large as the Manor his family had used to own—he’d seen many pictures of it—but they were still grand, and probably worth a small fortune. Many of his colleagues joked that these days, homes like that were unaffordable to young professionals, and that the only way they’d ever own one was by inheriting the house or the money for the house. Scorpius often laughed along with them, feeling a little guilty that he had more than a sizable inheritance, seeing as his dad had no one else to leave the Potter fortune too. Teddy was set to receive the Black fortune when he turned 30—they had all decided it was easiest, since he was the oldest Black heir, and the magic around that vault and the house that came with it was finicky—and thus Scorpius would get the Potter vault, also when he turned 30. It seemed like forever to wait before he could call himself a millionaire (Merlin, was his dad really a millionaire?) but he knew most people didn’t get that much money over the course of a lifetime, and that he should be grateful for the opportunity.
“You’re welcome to leave a note for him if you want?” she suggested. “I can give it to his department.”
“It only needs one wing, Harry,” Scorpius sighed, as if this was common knowledge. “Two wings just makes it faster, but sometimes it’s okay not to be the fastest.”
It was a long drive to get there. While Harry did fall asleep for a lot of it, Hassan did manage to explain to him that this festival was a part of the culture for the Wodabbe Fula people. Harry listened attentively as Hassan explained their history, and how the tribes often migrated based on the changing climate zones around the country.
“Have a safe trip, Draco,” she said as she released him and offered the urn of floo powder to him. “Make sure you write often.”
He broke off as someone cleared their throat. Scorpius and Smith both turned to find Harry Potter standing there, looking angrier than Scorpius had seen him in ages.
As the evening went on, Harry enjoyed himself more and more, though he had to admit that the friends and family were all getting rather rowdy, considering how much they'd been drinking all day. They were still celebrating by dinner time, though the restaurant owners had opened out the large patio doors, allowing some cool fresh air in. By the time dinner was over, Harry found himself yawning—he really had been woken up early. Camilla picked up on it right away, dragging him up and out the back door, as if they couldn't be seen leaving.
“Because he was mistried. They found new evidence that proves he was blackmailed into doing what he did, and—”
“I’ll want that spell,” Andromeda said lightly. “If it can get rid of red wine, it can get rid of anything, and you won’t believe the messes Teddy tends to get himself into.”
home. It made sense to him. Harry had been angry, and even if he hadn’t, it had been 15 years. The place was bound to get updated eventually.
"For example, we still play sports with them. Many witches and wizards in Chad enjoy football and traditional wrestling. The confederation of wizards told youngsters not to participate in the sports with moldus, because they worried that they would cheat with magic. But it is commonly accepted that magic is not to be used while playing games here. The only magical game is duelling, but it is not popular."
“I’m serious Harry, you need to let go of this. Forget Malfoy, forget the Department of Mysteries, and for fuck’s sake stop bringing your cloak to work! Might I remind you that there’s an audit of Quodpot Little League grants that you need to finish before you leave tonight?”
"I... I guess I never thought of it that way," he said slowly. "People are always fawning over me, acting as if I'm some kind of god when really I was just a kid who got lucky, and it gets pretty fucking annoying, so I usually try to avoid being recognised for that."
"Do you mind if we use your room to get changed?" Draco asked softly. "I'd rather not portkey back across the Atlantic in nothing but swim trunks."
Teddy squinted at him for a moment, before apparently deciding a break was just what he needed. He hauled himself out of his chair and grabbed his cloak from behind the door.
Harry was sure that once his anger wore off, he’d agree with Teddy that it had been quick thinking on Draco’s part. But as Teddy babbled on about Salamander blood and lacewing flies, Harry felt his anger surging again as he was reminded that the Minster had died thinking it was Harry who had killed him. They’d used
"Nydelig!" she suggested, and even though Harry had no idea whether it was the right word or not, he agreed. It seemed to be correct though, because she looked very pleased with herself and settled down next to him, helping herself to a krumkake as well.
McGonagall seemed saddened at the mention of her former Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor, but her resolve didn’t waver. “I wish she could have stayed. She was an excellent teacher. Just as I’m sure you’re an excellent Healer. Which is why I’m curious about what you might need my help with.”
“Harry,” Bryan interrupted. “I saw the way you were looking at him, and talking to him. You’re not the most subtle guy around.”
The ribbing and teasing continued throughout the night, but it was just good natured fun. At one point Ron started a trend of calling a toast for Harry and Draco every time a new round was bought (his favourite was “To Draco finally catching the Snitch for once in his life!”, which had caused Draco to pretend to pout for a few minutes), and it wasn’t long before the toasts started becoming increasingly ridiculous. Harry was used to such an atmosphere, however, and Draco seemed to be enjoying himself. Harry felt a sense of calm wash over him as he realised that everything was going his way. It felt
“Well, you can ask as many questions as you want while watching the Telly,” Harry explained. “And the people on the Telly can’t hear you, only the people you’re watching with can.”
“Ah, yes. Those blasted busybodies. Well, come in boy, come in. I don’t know why those idiots think I’m dying, or being robbed every night, but…”
works beautifully. Though I can’t help thinking, surely a man as accomplished as you must already know that. It made me wonder if maybe all those crossed out phrases weren’t meant to be hidden after all. So to answer your question, yes. That’s what a relationship is supposed to feel like. Like you’re breathless with laughter, dancing safe in someone’s arms. Like there is no one you want to be with more in the world. Two people in a relationship should get lost in each others’ eyes, melt into each others’ lips, and feel so alive when they touch that they could never imagine living without each other again.
"I don't understand your language," he replied, trying to remain calm. He knew from experience that yelling was not going to help. "You didn't say it in English. I'm sorry, I didn't know!"
Harry continued to dwell on his fears as the afternoon wore on. They visited the rest of the museum after an “eat-like-a-dragon!” buffet lunch, and before long Scorpius was complaining that his feet hurt, so they piled into a taxi to head back to the hotel.
"Wash," he said, pointing at Harry's towel. Taking it to mean that he needed to shower, Harry sighed, grabbing his things and slouching into the washroom. As he was showering, he realised that his host had probably brought the formal robes for him, which mean they were taking him to some kind of formal event. With a sigh, he shot a shaving charm at his face, before returning to his room. Camilla's father was sitting on his bed next to the robes, humming happily to himself.
“Yeah,” Scorpius nodded frantically, crouching down next to him. “Congratulations Papa. You’re finally free.”
“Should we join them?” Bryan asked casually. Harry stared carefully out at the crowd. While he usually avoided crowds like the plague, no one knew him here, and he could be as anonymous as he wanted. He turned back to Bryan, only to find his friend standing next to him with his hand held out.
"It's a competition between men. Mostly to be the most beautiful, but they also sing and dance, and do lots of other small competitions like camel racing. You want to participate?"
Draco turned to face Alfred Pertinger, 4th seat of Yorkshire in the Wizengamot, and his wife, who had rushed over to him as soon as he’d emerged from their daughter’s room.
“I… I can’t. My life’s ambition is to be a Healer. The only way I can do that is as the Unspeakable Liaison at St Mungo’s.”
“Hey Harry, sorry to bother you, but I was wondering if you could check on Draco at lunch again today? I just got another request for a potion that has to be watched all day, and Scorp is on emergency duty again.”
“I’d like to invite you to apply for the position.” Well, McGonagall was nothing if not straightforward. Though if Draco was being fair, they both knew that there was no way he’d turn the offer down.
As attractive as he was, the fact remained that Draco Malfoy was up to something, and Harry needed to figure out what. He should ask something about Draco’s work, but he’d barely understood what he’d said about it last week. Perhaps clarification on what his job actually was would be a good place to start.
“I will. Harassing an Auror is a serious offence,” she said pointedly. “Also, I didn’t realise Merle has spattergroit. Is she okay?”
Not willing to look too closely at this reluctance, Harry turned his attention back to the Department of Mysteries and what they could be doing with Malfoy. He didn’t trust Unspeakables as far as he could throw them; they always acted so superior, as if nothing outside of their offices was worth their consideration. With all of Hermione’s reprimands, he’d started to relent a bit and not focus so much on what they might be hiding. But seeing Malfoy go into the department had put a niggling idea into his head that something was going wrong at St Mungo’s. He couldn’t shake the idea that they might be experimenting on patients. It was an awful thought. But how would he ever find out if they were?
“I… yes, I’d be honoured! What do you need from me? A resume? Statement of intent? References? We can schedule a formal interview at your convenience as well.”
Harry wasn't sure what time it was, but he was certain of one thing; it was too goddamn early to be awake. So why on earth was Camilla's father knocking on the door and calling out to him? Bleary eyed, Harry rolled out of bed and shuffled toward the door, wondering what he could possibly want.
Bryan was silent for just long enough that Harry felt guilty for putting a damper on what was supposed to be a fun afternoon. Then, the arm on his shoulder tightened, and pulled him into a sideways hug.
small,” Harry chuckled. “But yes, I don’t think a little-league pitch would quite suit our needs, as adorable as it is to watch the little ones zipping about.”
“I was talking to Hermione yesterday, and she mentioned your, erm, discussion. She’s been giving a lot of thought to what you said. Apparently Harry’s unhappy because he can’t go to a burger joint with Teddy?” she sounded equally confused and annoyed, but Draco didn’t back down this time.
Draco frowned. “One of the basic principles of Healing is that you cannot Transfigure an unhealthy body into a healthy one. Most individual organs, yes, but not the whole body.”
“Confused and overwhelmed,” he confirmed. “There’s a lot of reading here, and it’s not all adding up.”
“What nonsense, Penelope, of course he doesn’t want an emergency shift. If someone called in sick, you should fire them because it’s obviously an excuse to take an extra long weekend, and then fill the shift yourself. That
“I’ve put together a few papers for you,” Hassan said, handing Harry a folder. “I put my contact information and the information I have about the Wodaabe tribe in there, it might help you and your lawyer. I’m guessing you do not want to stay married?”
"Well we used a combination of magic and muggle excavation techniques. There's a game area down the hall where you can try it, and then put a dragon skeleton together with the bones you find."
“Because, in their culture, when she picked me as her favourite contestant, that somehow married us. Everyone was surprised that she picked me at all because I don’t fit a lot of their beauty standards, but my host, Hassan, said he had thought it was just for fun.”
Harry spent another few days observing the beauty and culture of Nordland, and enjoying the hearty food, before he ran into Camilla again. If pressed, he might admit that he had been thinking about her for the past few days, and had purposely made his way back to the market, but when she asked, he insisted that he was here to buy bread, and what a lovely surprise it was to run into her again. He wasn't sure how he felt about the knowing glint in her eye, but pressed on anyways, asking her to join him for dinner at a beautiful lakeside restaurant he'd found during his adventures the day before. Thankfully she'd accepted, shooing him away from her stall when she started to notice other customers hovering unsurely behind Harry.
Head Auror Clearwater nodded, her face set. “No, we can’t. I think we can reopen the case on the grounds that Draco didn’t have legal representation the first time around, and that there was uncataloged evidence. But you’re going to have to prove that he actively worked to thwart the criminals he was working with.”
“Harry! Thank you for the kite!” Scorpius called as Harry walked into the waiting room. Harry’s mood instantly brightened at the sight of him.
Draco didn’t respond right away, and Harry worried for a moment that he may have upset him with talk of their school days. Suddenly, Draco leaned back in his chair crossed his arms comfortably and smirked.
“Oh, you’re more than welcome to stay and finish your tea, play with Help for a while if you’d like.”
He brought everything out to the hall and was surprised to find that he already had replies to all his letters. The girls had all replied to his message, and his express owl had returned as well. Glancing at the clock, he realised he had about an hour before he was due at lunch. He grabbed the transfer form and signed it quickly before stepping into the floo and vanishing.
“I know, which is why I didn’t make a big deal of it. Though you won’t believe the story he made up,” Agent Delta added with a laugh of their own. Agent Delta watched as agent Eta blew a large pink bubble. Agent Delta no longer resented their partner for that particular ability, though if they practiced in private in the hopes of one day doing it, that was no one’s business but their own.
“25,” Harry replied carefully. He glanced around to find all his new friends staring at him with wide eyes.
Harry nodded, sitting down as Draco left again with a swish of his robes. He heard a door close somewhere else in the flat, making him wonder about the layout of the place. Were there many rooms? Did they look like this one? It occurred to him that this might be the perfect time to uncover some information about Draco. That had been his goal, after all, when he’d agreed to their first date. If Draco was in the loo for long enough, perhaps Harry could take a peek around—this flat looked posh enough to have a home office. Someone as neat as Draco would definitely keep files about secret dealings with the Unspeakables in a home office.
And that was when it hit Harry. These two snarky, playful, kind-hearted blonds meant the world to him. He didn’t know what he’d do if he couldn’t see them regularly, if he couldn’t spend the rest of his life taking care of them and making them happy. He
He felt the tiniest sense of relief at the realisation that the article hadn't included him at all. If Harry could bear having such slander written about him, surely Draco could bear having the world find out he had been a sex worker (the use of the past tense filled him with an incredible sense of glee). He preferred not to though. It was a secret he hoped to keep from Andromeda and Teddy, and he was sure Millicent could do without the publicity of hiring a prostitute as well. Though now that he thought about it, he wasn't going to be working for Millicent.
The receptionist tapped a large leather-bound log book with his wand, and Harry watched as it flipped through what looked like hundreds of appointments. It finally stopped on a set of blank pages.
“You’re so beautiful” Harry whispered, leaning down to kiss Draco again. Draco melted, wrapping his arms around Harry to hold him close because even if he thought Harry was being delusional and he was horrible at accepting love and affection, this feeling of stillness, of peace of
to be inside Draco, the desire to bury himself over and over. Draco’s head pushed back into the door, his eyes shut tight as he was pounded into over and over again. “I love you” Draco gasped, his hands gripping into Harry’s hair.
“Possessive git,” Draco murmured but almost melted in relief. They were kissing again, as boldly and needy as before. Harry wrapped Draco’s legs around his waist and picked him up. “Hold the cloak” He murmured in between kisses. His hands secured around Draco’s waist. As they began to walk,
And with that, Harry turned back to Draco and started walking towards him. For a brief, horrendous but incredible moment Draco thought he was going to kiss him right there but Harry just nodded forward, a motion to walk. Draco followed, pulling his sleeve down.
Draco was a planner, this entire escapade had been planned out meticulously if not stupidly. However, it was pure instinct that made Draco reach down and start to roughly stroke himself in his pants. He couldn’t
Eventually Draco pulled back and opening his eyes he saw...the look in Potter’s eyes mixed with the flush in his cheeks made Draco’s cock twitch, the desire to pull him in again too strong. His hands were shaking with want, so he clasped them behind his back, already morning the loss of Harry underneath his hands.
“I suppose this is the reason you disappeared?” Granger asked Harry, eyes looking directly into his. Harry nodded, looing so casual, damn him. How was he so composed? Granger was easily the most powerful witch Draco knew. Potter included. He should be bloody
Harry starred at Draco as though he were crazy which only made Draco more frustrated. “Because you don’t deserve that, Malfoy.”
“Just good?” Taunted Draco but there was not much heat in it. He used the hand he had in Harry’s hair to tug his head up, “no marks” Draco whispered, before kissing Harry hard. Harry responded immediately, pressing into Draco’s mouth with his tongue, reveling in the way Draco’s mouth moved against his.
Draco shook his head, smiling sadly, “no one wants me there. I’ll just ruin your fun. Thanks for the invite though.”
Harry bellowed, an intense hatred mixed with a shameful bit of fear thrumming through his veins. His eyes were locked on Malfoy, the pathetic, bareboned creature who stood before him as the curse crackled through the air, striking Malfoy dead on in the chest. Adrenaline still pounding through Harry, he felt a breath of relief start as Malfoy flew back, the start of the Cruciatus curse still ringing in his ears as he watches Malfoy fall.
“What was your greatest regret?” Draco asked, alcohol making him cut through everyone, probably the most he’d spoken all night. Some people looked at him a bit odd, most of all Harry who looked at Draco quite...somberly. Harry reached up his hand and gently trailed his fingers down his own face, exactly where Draco’s scars were.
Draco was. While Harry floundered, looking through his lacking notes for what on Earth an anti-flammatory potion was, Draco rolled up his sleeves, lit a flame under their caldron and gave Harry was very precise, if not very limited set of instructions probably for the better.
“Finger yourself” Harry corrected and held his breath. This was straying even further into unknown territory. He was afraid Draco might run. He wouldn’t blame him.
“I meant it...” Harry whispered in between kisses, “that I don’t want this to be...purely-“ Draco bit at his bottom lip. “Physical” Harry whispered, tightening his hold on Draco’s waist. “And I don’t...” Harry broke away from Draco’s lips, pressing a deep kiss right behind his jaw, below Draco’s ear. “You know I want to fuck you more than anything.” He felt Draco’s grin vibrate through his skin.
Weasel had seen the two of them stop and called, “oy, you two. Come on, we’re about to begin.” Potter started walking over, Draco flying right behind him.
Harry kissed back just as hard, moving his hands to bracket either side of Draco, to support his weight. He nipped at the bottom of Draco’s lip, smiling when Draco let out a small moan that Harry happily swallowed up. Draco tugged more, costing Harry his balance so he landed fully ontop of Draco.
“Any...all of them” Draco whispered back because he had no shame apparently and there was a very good chance that Harry would never speak to him again so he was going to make losing the lov- this worth it. Draco dipped his fingers underneath Harry’s waistline, palming his cock his no pretense.
“There’s so many things I want to do to you Malfoy...for so long” Harry whispered, his fingers slipping under Draco’s waistband, fingers ghosting over his ass, which made Draco shudder.
This spurred Harry on, after giving Draco a little time to get used to the stretch, started to pulse in and out. With each pulse, Draco felt himself get harder and harder. No one had done this to him before, for him.  And here was Potter, face buried between Draco’s legs, tongue fucking him with such enthusiasm that Draco almost felt bad.
“Two months is nothing. Not to mention the war, and- there’s a lot to process. Don’t...you can’t beat yourself up for not healing fast enough.”
The three laughed, Barren taking another step closer so they were toe to toe. “I don’t need your words, rat. I don’t need your act.”
Everyone had a reaction to that, Draco’s eyes flew to his dorm door. He could escape...but then his eyes landed on Harry. And the selfish, drunk part of him needed to any information Harry may volunteer during this game.
“They think I’m going to try and poison you in your sleep or something.” Draco explained, trying to dismiss it. Trying to make it sound like a joke because he so desperately wished it was. It would be so much easier to laugh than to face the reality that on his first day back, just as he feared, no one would accept him.
Draco felt his ankle being elevated, Harry propping it up on two pillows. When Harry stood next to Draco, it occurred to him that this was the first time they’ve been alone since last night. Gently, Draco reached up, reaching for Harry’s hand which Harry immediately took.
Potter raised his eye brow and stood up, immediately in Malfoy’s space. They met eyes, Potter’s expression unreadable to Malfoy.

Draco decided it was best to stay in his room until the feast. The only people he could talk to were Pansy and Blaise and they were off somewhere together. Plus Pansy would know in a

. They both thought, minds blurry from desire and pleasure. Gently, and carefully Harry turned and laid Draco on the bed.
Harry thought, before being flung to the side by the professor, before quickly murmuring some healing spells Harry definitely should have thought of over Draco’s paling body.
Draco didn’t even know what to think. Thinking seemed too far fetch at the moment, only truly aware of his physical senses. The sticky wetness of his shirt, the adrenaline that pumped through his body, and the
Draco looked up at him, the words so sincere that made Draco feel the need to jump because he couldn’t stand hearing his fear was validated, that he’s deserves to want to live. Not that he particularly wants to recently. Especially not now.
“Please” Draco whispered, fingers gripping his arm painfully strong. Harry shut up, returning to rubbing small circles into the small of Draco’s back.
Harry considered protesting against Draco but decided to just enjoy the peace.  “Goodnight, Draco.” Harry whispered, kissing Draco’s temple.
to Hogwarts. I hope you all see this as a privilege, as I do, to continue our normal routines from before. Normal, as I’m sure you’re all quite aware, has been in flux for quite a while. It is a privilege, a right, to continue your education” McGonagall begun, students murmuring in agreement. “Wonderful, I’m glad you all feel that way so when NEWTs come along, or a rather long potions essay, you will remember it’s a
a hero, Harry. That’s a fact. But that doesn’t make you less of anything else. It doesn’t make you less human, less emotional, less of a prat, less deserving. I know you have your fan club but, Harry,
. Almost worst than Azkaban itself. The Professor was insufferable, Draco hadn’t even managed to catch his name it was so dull. He sat in the back, alone, as no other student would care to sit near him. Even his fellow Slytherins, of which there were quite a few in this class, didn’t dare. Class unity yada yada.
cared if I was hurt or...I’m not used to kindness.” Draco summarized, feeling Harry’s hands ground him.
Harry glowered down at Barren daring him to get up. “Have you gone mental? What are you?  A Death Eater now-“
. Draco thought just five minutes later. He was sat in one of the arm chairs, subconsciously ripping at the skin around his nails as was his nervous habit, with just about everyone he hoped to never see again surrounding him. Granger and Weasley were squashed together on an arm chair,
Draco shut his eyes, feeling very conflicted but also painfully turned on. Harry’s hands teased a bit more before unbuttoning Draco’s shirt, carefully, one by one. Halfway Harry stopped, kissing Draco once and whispered, “open your eyes” against Draco’s lips.
The said skeleton finally stepped out of the archway, and turned to the right, where the Slytherin common room was. Only, mid turn he changed his mind, pivoting left so quickly Harry didn’t have the chance to move, and crashed into Harry, sending both tumbling back, the invisibility cloak sliding off.
As they walked down the stairs, Draco saw Weaslette already waiting for him. Great. Without a word, Draco exited the common room. Which just left Harry and Ginny. Harry descended the lasts of the steps and stood before Ginny who was standing near the fire place.
Draco’s vison had become narrow, focused only on the pounding between his legs. Of Harry pounding into him. Distantly, Draco was aware that he was mumbling, maybe screaming, Harry’s name. That Harry was pounding into him so hard, Draco could hear the bed frame slap against the wall. The pound of the bed frame mixed with the sinful sound of skin on skin, combined with the fast, hard thrusts Draco felt pound into him where too much.
Draco, meanwhile, had forgone breakfast as it was his mission to avoid the dining hall, at least at popular hours, to try and make his life a bit easier. With the new ‘eighth year house’ came a new Quidditch team. The 8
Potter shook his head, beginning to kiss down Draco’s chest. “I’ve been thinking about it all day...and admittedly a little jealous. Plus,” Harry reasoned, face teasingly close to Draco’s crotch. So close that Draco could feel Potter’s breath skim his cock. “Plus, I hate seeing people degrade you” he whispered, suddenly a lot more serious. “They’re all idiots.”
The rest of potions proceeded without any explosions, emotional or actual ones which counted as a win in Harry’s book. Though he couldn’t help but notice how much Draco dulled himself in class. Almost like he had the power to turn himself two dimensional. Harry supposed it was a defense mechanism, both to protect himself but also spare those around him. Those Draco had inevitably hurt.
Draco’s shirt was fully unbuttoned and Harry was staring at the scars that ran all across his torso. The worst one being a jagged one that almost followed along his v-line on the left before jetting into his stomach.
Harry nodded, eyes scanning Draco’s eyes for any signs of hesitation as Harry reached between Draco’s legs, fingers circling his hole. Draco gasped, pulling Harry up to kiss him, hungrily. Between their lips, Harry muttered the lubrication spell and a moment later Draco felt the first finger push in. He couldn’t help the whine that escaped him, it had certainly been a little while. Harry stilled, pulling back slightly to watch Draco for signs of pain.
Draco sat up, straddling Harry, and swatted at his chest. “I didn’t know you were such an exhibitionist.”
“I believe you promised something else for tonight” Potter pointed out, crawling back between Draco’s legs and kissing him hard. Draco responded enthusiastically, rolling his hips up to meet Potter’s. Harry had always been a passionate person, and especially in the last twenty-four hours, Draco thought he had truly discovered how passionate Potter could be. But this, clearly jealous, possessive, wound up Potter? Breath taking. Draco could only react to whatever Potter had planned and he had no complaints.
Harry groaned at the contact, rolling his hips forward into Draco’s. When Draco rolled his back, Harry growled into Draco’s mouth, putting a hand between Draco’s head and the door before kissing him harder than before.
“Rules are simple. You pick truth or dare, if you don’t answer you drink if you don’t do the dare you drink. And these-“ he waved his wand, each of their cups glowing, “are now enchanted so they’ll know the truth and know if you did the dares. Another rule, is that if you take too long to decide....you play your own round of spin the bottle.” Dean finished with a mischievous grin.
Harry sighed, curling in on himself a little. Draco gently ran his hand over Harry’s chest, waiting patiently for him to speak. After a moment, Harry whispered, “when I walk around here...all I see are the people I couldn’t save.”
Draco was about to mutter something about torture when he heard Harry mutter something else and Draco felt the inside of him magiced clean. Oh
There were more murmurs about this, specifically in the eighth year table. Harry sat at the very end, closest to the door, with Ron and Hermione flanking him of course.
Life, it seemed, had other plans. Or specifically, Luna Lovegood did. There was a knock on the door, which Draco ignored, followed by three more. By the third one, Draco had pulled his wand out, ready for whoever was waiting to edge on the ex-Death Eater.
“Don’t be a prat” Draco moaned, reaching down to stroke himself to completion if the brunette idiot wouldn’t do it himself. But Harry caught Draco’s wrist, pressing a kiss to the inside of it before pushing it away.
with what he hoped was a look of nonchalance. “Didn’t think I’d see you” Harry commented quietly, with a smile.
Harry had one hand cupping Draco’s face, the other winding around Draco’s waist as he pulled the blonde closer. Draco went willingly, all his consciousness focused at the points where Harry was touching him.
“Not at all” laughed Ron. “Once, the psychopaths wouldn’t let him out of the house, ya know to come here, and Fred, George....we had to rip metal bars off his window. Rotten luck all that, did you know, they used to make him sleep in a
“Harry” Draco responded, saturating the sound of Harry’s name in way that was definitely flirtatious, even if he didn’t mean it to be so consciously. He did enjoy the look Harry gave him, the look of surprise and...the same thing he had after they had kissed.
Harry’s punch landed before Barren could even finish his sentence. Turns out, the guy was really bark no bite as he fell pretty hard, head smacking against the pavement. The students around them gasped, some turning to leave least they get in trouble others starting to chant ‘fight!’
Draco raised an eyebrow at Harry, suddenly aware of the fact that although they were both fully clothed, Draco felt horribly, horribly exposed. Harry seemed to sense that discomfort, leaning down to kiss Draco who responded willingly. After a moment, Harry pulled back again. “Let me make you feel good.” He whispered again and this time Draco just nodded, not sure exactly what he was agreeing to but it felt bigger than just a sexual act.
“Not bloody likely” Draco rolled his eyes, but there was no bite. Really he didn’t know what he was saying, he was pretty sure he was delirious at this point.  Somehow he had kissed his crush of multiple years, almost had sex with him, confessed his deepest insecurities,
Barren was not laughing. He stepped even closer so Draco could only smell his repugnant breath. “You may have him fooled, but I know a rat when I see one. Even with your fancy toys-“ Barren reached for Draco’s broom. Instinctively, Draco grabbed his wrist. The broom was the last thing his father had given to him before being locked away in Azkaban, nothing must happen to it. Barren sneered, as if waiting for Draco to fight back, and with one big hand against Draco’s chest, shoved him onto the ground. Draco’s wrists cracking with catching his swift fall and his head banging hard on the floor.
Everything was more sensitive. With each thrust down, Draco felt himself grow needier. He ground himself down onto Harry, the sensation of being full, being fucked addictive. Draco was breathing heavily, moving in time with Harry and he felt each thrust up radiate up into his whole body.
“Kiss me first” Draco whispered, not even realizing he had really said it. But Harry responded immediately, pushing himself up Draco’s body and kissed Draco fiercely.
“Try it” prompted Harry, laying a hand on Draco’s back, holding his shirt slightly so he didn’t fall forward. Draco did absolutely not blush. He didn’t. Except he did. Ah well, at least neither would topple off. Or they both would. Oh well.
“No wonder you guys are so pale,” Harry teased. He was glad to see Draco smile at that, though it didn’t last long.
"Sorry. American law is very different from British law, it's going to take me a little while to figure out what you guys did and how to reverse it."
“Yeah, I’ll do that.” Scorpius glanced at his watch and was surprised to see that his break was almost over. They settled their bill and packed their leftovers in silence. It wasn’t until they were back in the Atrium that Teddy spoke to him again.
“If you really must know… it was a letter from my mom. Happy? I’m 21, and I still get mail from my parents, checking on me while I travel the country.” He seemed embarrassed about his admission, but Harry didn’t see anything wrong with that. He would
“But I don’t want to go into the sand,” Scorpius pointed out. Harry nodded and toed off his shoes before swooping Scorpius up and settling him on his back.
He was done with marriage anyways. Part of the reason he'd decided to go travelling was to get away from the media storm back home. When Harry had finally reached his limit and demanded a divorce from Laura, she had run straight to the Prophet about it, trying to spin the story so that it made her look like a jilted lover, and like Harry had never really cared. It hadn't been long before he'd been forced to retaliate, giving the Prophet, the Quibbler, Witch Weekly and Quidditch Quarterly in-depth interviews about how they were no longer in love. He'd tried his best to avoid smearing her name, despite everything she'd done to him, but when Draco had started the divorce process for him, he'd written the reason as infidelity. No one was quite sure how the Prophet had gotten ahold of those papers, but when they did, things had really escalated. Everyone had spent about two weeks speculating who had been unfaithful, before Laura's secret boyfriend had decided that he wanted a piece of the attention too and proposed to her, right in the middle of Diagon Alley. When she'd rejected him, playing it off as some random stranger who just wanted a famous wife, he'd retaliated by giving Skeeter an exclusive interview about every single time they'd had sex behind Harry's back. It had enraged Harry even more to see exactly how long she'd been cheating, but not as much as it had hurt to see himself described as an oblivious loser who couldn't even satisfy his own wife. Draco had tried to console him, insisting that this made it easier to prove her fault and therefore prevent her taking all his money, but Harry didn't care about the money. It was the betrayal that had really hurt; he had genuinely thought he loved her, and that she loved him.
Thankfully, the server chose that very moment to arrive with the food, and the prospect of dinner seemed to shatter the awkward silence. Camilla's father started explaining to Harry what each thing was, with his daughter translating dutifully, and her mother kept placing more food on his plate. Happily reminded of Molly, Harry let her serve him a little bit of everything, and ate it all without fuss. He wasn't surprised to find that the food was delicious. Camilla's parents were also wonderful company, once they opened up to him. They told him happy stories about their life in the village, and by the end of the night, he almost felt like he had grown up with this family and their adventures.
Draco nodded, though he still looked unsure about something. Unsure why he was being so shy, he turned back to the witch behind the counter, whose cheerful expression had suddenly melted away.
As he Summoned a sheet of parchment to reply to Harry’s letter, he couldn’t help lamenting the fact that being an Unspeakable was lonely business.
After the church let out, they made their way to a nearby restaurant, where a good chunk of the community that had been at the church followed them. Lunch (had they really been in the church that long?) was a rowdy affair, with people singing and dancing and toasting all over the place. Camilla, for her part, never left his side, though there always seemed to be someone wanting her attention, and preventing Harry from asking what all the celebration was for. Soon enough, she pulled him into the ruckus to dance as well. Harry rather enjoyed himself, though he was incredibly surprised when she kissed him, right there on the dance floor.  He glanced around nervously, but no one seemed at all bothered by the sight, despite the fact that barely two weeks ago, Camilla's parents had given them pointed coughs when they so much as hugged each other.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said softly. Draco barely heard it, but Harry continued talking. “I should have fought for you, all those years ago. It’s been eating me up inside. I should have trusted that you weren’t evil, that you were in trouble, that you needed my help. I was so blinded by my anger that I didn’t stop to consider how you were feeling. I can’t help thinking that maybe if I’d said something… maybe if I’d gotten you a lawyer, or spoken at your trial… that something might have helped. I could have done something to make sure I didn’t lose you. I loved you… and I still do.” Those last few words were much softer than the rest, but it still warmed Draco to hear them. “But I did a piss poor job of showing it.”
what you signed up for, so I swear on my honour as a gentleman if you find time this afternoon to accompany me to lunch, I will refrain from assaulting you.
Harry pushed his plate away, no longer in the mood to eat (not that the broccoli casserole was very appetizing to start with). He stared at the wooden grain of the island, unsure how to continue what he’d wanted to say. He heard Draco’s plate scrape against the wood too, and a moment later, Draco’s frail hand covered his. Taking comfort in the small gesture, Harry started to speak again.
“Curiosity always leads to trouble,” she said easily. “You’ve always been fascinated by Draco. You used to follow him around at school, remember?”
“It’s not quite that far back. I don’t know how to describe it.” Harry was hoping that a confusing description would make it harder for Malfoy to see right through his lie, but he was starting to get the feeling that he hadn’t quite thought this through. It was just starting to occur to him that he would probably have to show Malfoy his arse if he didn’t want to admit that this was all a farce. Merlin, he was an idiot. Why couldn’t he have listened to Hermione?
"Um, people who don't know magic," Harry explained, realising they must have a different word for them here.
Draco dragged himself away from the direction his thoughts were taking and tried to focus on what Harry was saying. Clearly he’d been asked a question that he had no answer to.
Please tell me I'm right. I hate these things. And not just because the press seems to have a sixth sense for when
"I sure did," Harry said, producing the gift bag with the toy inside. Scorpius opened it excitedly, pulling out the plush reindeer and hugging it close.
“Are you here with anyone?” Draco asked. He probably shouldn’t monopolise Harry’s time, even though he wanted to. Thankfully, Harry shook his head.
“Why are you so insistent on cooking for us?” Harry was surprised by Scorpius’ defensive tone. “You know I have to be careful about what Papa eats! Even the soup you brought us had a lot of salt and garlic, those aren’t good for him!”
“Yes, sir!” Harry called, grinning as he started tugging the floatie along again. Scorpius turned to watch in anticipation as his father dove under the floatie, reappearing on different sides each time and reaching up to tickle his son. To retaliate, Harry kept tugging the float in different directions, making Scorpius squeal each time they made a sharp turn.
“I, uh... well, I’ve been feeling a little itchy… um, down there,” Harry mumbled. He’d rehearsed the lie in his head while waiting in line downstairs and decided that sounding hesitant would make it more convincing.
"Goodnight Camilla," he said, giving her a gentle smile as she stood up. He watched as she disappeared down the walkway towards the small village beyond, turning her very sudden question over and over in his head. With a shrug he pushed it out of his mind, and turned his attention back to the lake.
“Um, I thought we should wait for your Papa to board before we continue,” he said, pointing at Draco, who was now wading toward them.
“Well, dragons are very big. It might be too heavy for me to carry. But I promise I’ll try,” Harry vowed, placing his hand over his heart to show the boy how serious he was.
He opened it and read the header “Goat under citizen’s arrest, suspected unregistered Animagus and attempted robbery plot,” and closed it with a groan. Verifying whether or not the goat actually was an Animagus was a routine spell, albeit a little difficult since they so rarely got to use it, but the people who had “apprehended” the goat were likely to be full of conspiracy theories and paranoid about every blade of grass they walked on. From his experience, those people often liked to talk a lot, especially to authority figures like an Auror. In fact, it might be easier if this actually was an unregistered Animagus, because then he could arrest the person and bring them back to the Ministry for questioning. But if it turned out to be a regular old goat, he could potentially spend hours convincing these people to let it go.
A little thrown off by Scorpius’ outburst, Harry didn’t respond right away. The guilt that he’d felt seeing that old photograph on Scorpius’ fridge was back in full force. He really hadn’t supported Scorpius properly when they’d lost Draco, and clearly it had taken more of a toll on his son than he thought.
“I’ve always loved a challenge. Figuring out puzzles was my favourite pastime. As I got older, the challenge of understanding the complexities of the human body really started to draw me in. I spent hours during my seventh year researching how potions interact with human organs, how spells can alter genes, how easily a person’s magical core can repair torn limbs.”
"It looks great!" Harry said, grinning at Draco over Scorpius' head. "I especially love that everything is orange and lime green."
“Harry-train sounds silly!” he giggled. He was still laughing as they approached Draco, who looked up at the familiar sound in surprise.
as an option, chuckling at the memory of Ron getting flustered in her presence. He remembered not liking the dish, though he wasn’t sure if that was just due to his limited palate at fourteen. He spared a moment to wonder if Malfoy would call him tacky for ordering a burger at such an upscale establishment, before chiding himself for worrying about what Malfoy would think. This wasn’t even a real date after all.
“He used to brew illegal polyjuice potion before you were born. He couldn’t get a job after the war, but he needed to make money somehow. He gave it all up though, to keep you safe. Finally got a job in a shop, and when you both moved in with me, I promised him he’d never have to work a day in his life if that was what he wanted, that I’d keep both of you safe and happy. He still kept working—I think he liked to be able to contribute
Harry nodded, shoving his hands in his pocket, where he felt something odd. With a start, he realised it was the kite he’d brought for Scorpius. He’d shrunken it and put it in his pocket, but since Scorpius wasn’t in the office today, he’d completely forgotten about it until now.
The more he thought about it, the more it made sense. Harry had said that Draco was withdrawn in the weeks before he’d been arrested—he must have been nervous about modifying the potion, and worried for Scorpius’ life.
was a very elegant-looking establishment. Malfoy was already sitting at a table when he arrived, dressed as posh as ever in a tailored navy blue suit and reading the contents of a green folder. Harry was just wondering if he might get a chance to peek at the folder, when the hostess approached him. He waved her away, hoping to be able to sneak up behind Malfoy. Unfortunately, Malfoy noticed him walking over and slipped the folder into his robe pocket, which must have had an Undetectable Extension Charm on it. He was surprised to see Malfoy stand up at his arrival, though that was nothing compared to him pulling out his chair for him. Harry had thought that was only a gesture made in movies and felt oddly flattered as he sat down.
"We should be sleeping, must be awake early tomorrow," she explained. Harry nodded; they were usually up early anyway, so he wasn't sure what the sudden warning was for. Feeling like he was ready for bed though, he followed her up the stairs, her mother trailing behind them for some reason. Figuring the whole family was tired, he bid them goodnight and closed his door.
“Oh, it’s you,” Draco sighed, barely glancing up at Harry. “Have a seat, we’ll go over the final documents in a moment.”
The sun was rising by the time Draco was certain he’d done enough to, at the very least, keep the patient stable for a few hours. He cast a fresh Stasis Charm over the sleeping girl and double checked the Monitoring Charms around the room. With a flick of his wand, the chart updated itself to show that he was now the primary Healer on the case and that no spells were to be cast on her until his return.
“The second idea,” Harry continued, “is that there are a bunch of shops inside an old chocolate factory that we could go see.”
After leaving the girls, Draco made his way back to his apartment, where he took no small pleasure in telling his shady landlord that he was moving out, effective immediately. Millie, ever the rational thinker, had convinced him that he should stay at the Humdinger tonight. It didn’t make sense to take everything back to Knockturn Alley for one night, only to have to get out of there first thing in the morning. He packed up the ragged blankets, the worn out clothes, and the few meagre belongings he had, and promptly dropped them in a community donation bin out on Diagon Alley. He didn’t need them anymore.
“So, does this mean you’re going to start taking me on dates to Hogsmeade?” Harry asked shyly, once again pulling Draco out of his thoughts. “I’ve always thought it was a beautiful village.”
“I tried,” he finally replied. “Clearly didn’t succeed though,” he muttered under his breath, pushing around a piece of broccoli. He wasn’t as quiet as he thought, if Draco’s sudden laughter was any indication. Harry hadn’t heard Draco laugh in so long that he couldn’t help staring. It had once been one of his favourite sounds.
“So as I was saying, I live alone. I have one daughter, but she moved out to America years back with her own daughter and husband. Landed a great contract for inventing charms and is doing very well for herself, bless her. Her mother, my wife, passed on a few years ago, and neither of us had any other family here, so now it’s just me.”
“Those are some thick files,” Head Auror Clearwater commented as he sat down at his desk again. He hadn’t even noticed her watching him.
“I may as well try Scorpius’ cooking, since I’m here,” he said casually. He turned to take the casserole out of the oven, and soon he was sitting across from Draco, eating the most bland casserole he’d ever had the misfortune of tasting in his life. He tried to glance around covertly, wondering where he might find salt and pepper, or some type of sauce to liven up what was clearly boiled broccoli baked in a flavourless bechamel sauce.
Feeling much better, Draco tucked into his breakfast, dreaming about all the improvements he was going to make to his life now that he had a bit of money and a steady income to rely on. Unable to hold off, he pulled the transfer form out of the envelope. He was sure Harry would be fair to him, but he wanted to see with his own eyes that he was owed 300 Galleons. He flipped the sheet open as he put a forkful of strawberries into his mouth and promptly started choking.
"Don't get married by accident," Draco added under his breath. Harry sighed, but smiled all the same. He was sure that this trip would be perfectly normal.
Draco grinned as he turned to face Harry, who was offering him a champagne flute. They weren’t attending the St Mungo’s Charity Gala together, but it had come up during their last date that they would both be in attendance, and Draco had been thrilled at the thought that there would be someone he could talk to here. His work didn’t exactly allow him to make many friends in the healing community, and most of the politicians who attended these events were unbearably boring.
Harry sighed as he realised that Bryan was absolutely right. As soon as Draco and Scorpius had arrived, Harry’s attention had been focused almost entirely on them.
"Scorpius, that's a very personal question," Draco said patiently. He turned to look apologetically at Harry, who shrugged.
His suspicions confirmed, Harry took a deep breath and said the words he’d been mulling over all night.
Bryan merely shrugged. Harry couldn't help wondering why he was being so quiet all of a sudden. Still pondering the question, he gave Draco his plate and then sat down next to him. He was still a little sore from the night before, having forgotten to cast a healing charm after his shower, and winced lightly. Thankfully Scorpius was too engrossed with his sandwich to notice, but Draco picked up on it right away.
“Who’s a good boy?” Scorpius cooed, scratching the grey crup behind the ears. It was still quite small, and must be fairly young.
“Well, I mentioned that I was seeing someone who I wanted to introduce tonight,” Harry said sheepishly. In hindsight, he really should have told everyone that it was Draco he was seeing.
Malfoy looked well. A little tired, sure, but he seemed strong and healthy. Harry didn’t usually notice things like that about other people, but it was a stark contrast to the Malfoy he remembered from the war.
divorced. They already thought he was old. At least he hadn’t told him that it had happened three times.
“So you became an Auror, and reopened my case?” his papa said, in a clear bid to change the topic. Scorpius nodded, gesturing to his cloak.
"I don't think I would win any beauty competitions," he sighed. "I've always been a very scruffy kind of guy."
Harry's eyes widened. "But she said that we were married! They had a huge party—it lasted a whole day!"
“Together or separate?” she asked, moving towards the register. Draco slid two Galleons over to her without saying anything—more than enough to cover both their meals—but rather than waiting for the change, he leaned forward to try to pick up the precarious bowl. Draco pulled his hand back suddenly—the bowl must have been very hot.
Ron snorted. “You can easily contact anyone we went to school with and ask them out on a date if you’re interested. So why haven’t you?”
"So, um, while I was away... I may have... um, accidenallygotmarried?" he mumbled, scrubbing his hand across his mouth.
Luna’s head snapped up at the mention of animals. She often spent their pub nights knitting rather than participating in the conversation, but creatures usually snagged her attention pretty effectively.
“You know I could technically refuse you both entry,” Agent Delta mumbled, unlocking the office door and letting them both in. Agent Phi snorted as the pair settled on the couch, while Agent Delta took a seat at their desk.
I finally manage to get him out of a wrongful conviction only to find that his health is awful! I spent years begging for closure, or reassurance, and I got
Draco read the letter over twice more, wondering why he felt so sad at the thought that Harry was gone. He chalked it up to the thought of being sad that this week was over. He couldn't believe how much had happened in the last seven days. He'd been wary about this at first, but despite the few rough days, he had to admit that he was in a much better place than when he'd started. Sure, he still had to go back to his horrible apartment, but now that he would be working for Millicent, it wouldn't be long before he could afford a better place. And if he was going to get a wand, it would go a long way toward making the place liveable until he could leave.
“Fine. Follow me.” Relieved that his plan seemed to be working, Harry followed Malfoy up to the third floor. He wasn’t at all surprised to see the plaque pointing out the Potions and Plant Poisoning ward—Malfoy had always been skilled at potions. What did surprise him, however, was that they didn’t stop at the ward, but kept walking in another direction. There were no signs indicating what the rooms in this corridor were for, and they only passed one person before Malfoy led him into a small examination room. Harry tried not to let his disappointment show—he’d been hoping they would go to Malfoy’s office, but he figured an examination room made sense.
Harry also found himself drawn to the beautiful textiles in the market. He found himself purchasing many brightly coloured scarves for all his friends, and a beautiful beaded purse for Hermione. While Harry was happy to pay full price for everything, Hassan proved to be a big help in haggling with the vendors, especially since Harry found himself buying so many things.
Checking his watch, Harry was delighted to notice that he was early. He selected a table right in the middle of the cafeteria, hoping to encourage more people to stop and chat.
"Is this really important right now?" Harry asked weakly. "Draco said he'd be here in an hour or so, maybe we can get dressed and try to find some food before he comes."
“You thought the first victim might have been a case of revenge, right? Since she was the daughter of a Wizengamot member?”
“They’re beautiful pictures.” Harry jumped at the sound of Draco’s voice, and turned to see him leaning on the doorway. He nodded at the comment, glancing back at the collection of photographs before opening the door and pulling out a small casserole wrapped in foil. He carried it over to the oven and set it to heat. A quick peek under the foil told him it was precooked, so it really just had to be warmed up.
“Mostly normal. Secrecy has a new intern who messed up the spells on my office, and someone came looking for me.”
Harry thought he heard a little snort from Draco. He was definitely sugar coating how his marriage had ended. In actuality, Laura was a terrible woman who had only pretended to love Harry in an attempt to benefit from his fame and his money. Barely a week after they'd returned from their honeymoon, she'd started acting quite indifferent to him, eventually turning quite nasty any time he so much as tried to talk to her. She had been spending exorbitant amounts of (his) money, and didn't agree with anything Harry wanted. They hadn't even lasted a year before Harry had found another man in their bed with her, and marched straight over to Draco's office to start the divorce process.
Draco nodded, barely paying attention as she disappeared. He sat down at the table, contemplating the envelope. It was rather thick, which told him there must be multiple sheets of parchment in it. He ripped it open as a large stack of pancakes, topped with strawberries and clotted cream, appeared in front of him.
“I don’t know how you deal with puzzles like that,” Neville mused. “That’s why I like plants. They’re simple and straightforward.”
“I was,” he said proudly. “I’m sure if I had stayed, I would have been head by now, probably would have trained you myself! But alas, they needed me in Games and Sports, and I must say Penelope is a great second choice!”
Harry had seemed quite charmed by their first date, however. Draco had done his best to remain charming and confident, a strategy that had clearly worked very well if Harry’s blush at the end of the night was any indication. A small part of him dared to hope that he might actually be able to charm Harry Potter, but he squashed the thought immediately. He simply had to convince Harry that there was nothing to be suspicious about. Once he was sure Harry trusted him, he’d make some excuse and end their relationship.
“It’s alright,” Luna said kindly. “They’re already dispersing. Clearly everyone can already see that you’re a good match.”
Draco was hard put to keep from laughing. As if anyone in this blasted hospital would make him a supervisor. Though when he really thought about it, he was
“I’ll have to head out soon,” Draco whispered to Harry, ignoring Longbottom’s description of one of his exotic new plants. “I have to be at the hospital tonight.”
Scorpius wasn’t paying much attention to the cross-examination, but from the satisfied expression on Harrison’s face, he gathered that his father’s story matched the evidence. He was just wondering how much longer the proceedings might last when the Chief Warlock stood up.
“Thank you for your outrage, Harry,” Draco said once they were seated again. “It’s rare that people are on my side in this situation. But please don’t worry about me, I’m used to it. The important thing is that I’m here to help my patients, and that alone brings me enough joy to ignore the rest.”
Harry nearly spilled coffee all over himself when Scorpius’ head popped into the floo. Now that he no longer had Scorpius bustling around in the mornings while getting ready for work, Harry had been getting used to his mornings being slow and quiet.
“Are you okay, Scorp?” he asked, holding the small boy close and patting his back. Scorpius coughed a few more ties before pulling back and nodding happily.
Harry cut him off with a gentle wave of his hand. As nice as he had been, Harry didn’t plan on remaining in contact with Hassan. He didn’t really mind what the man thought of him.
“Lunch first,” Head Auror Clearwater said sternly. “Stretch your legs and get something to eat, and then you’ll have the whole afternoon to read. I’ll cover the floo until you get back.”
Scorpius laughed. “You know he’s happy to cook for you regardless of your health status. But yeah, I can floo call and tell him I’m sending you over for some TLC.”
When visiting hours ended, and Adella kicked them out, Scorpius and Teddy left together. They had just reached the floos, when Teddy spoke up.
After closing the shop, the two of them would make their way back to the house, where invariably some relative or family friend would be visiting. For some odd reason, they all seemed thrilled to meet Harry. He would usually spend the afternoon with them, Camilla stepping in to translate. When he noticed her mother slipping away to prepare dinner, he would usually follow, opting to watch her cook and hoping he could pick up some recipes. She seemed delighted to teach him—apparently Camilla wasn't a huge fan of cooking, but her mum had always wanted to pass on her recipes. Of course, Camilla ended up learning everything he learned anyway, simply because she had to explain whatever her mother was lecturing them about.
Bryan was silent for a moment, but Harry decided to wait him out. He was rewarded a few minutes later, when Bryan finally spoke.
Draco couldn’t help smiling as he thought about their dinner a few nights prior. It had been fairly obvious that Harry was suspicious of him, especially considering how many questions he had asked about Draco’s work. He’d spent most of the evening talking in circles around his profession, hoping to misdirect Harry’s attention. He’d done his best not to lie directly to his date; as natural as it was for him sometimes, Draco wasn’t a fan of lying. It
Draco stretched his neck as he let go of the Portkey and handed it to the station attendant. Hitching his bag back up onto his shoulder, he made his way out into the waiting area, looking around for a hint of the jet black bird's nest that had taken over his dreams the past few days. He was expecting Harry to be standing around reading something or the other for work, maybe a hoodie over his head to avoid the press, as he usually was when he came to pick Draco up. What he wasn't expecting was to see Harry in a beautifully cut suit, holding a giant bouquet of red roses and a Muggle helium balloon that said “Congratulations” on it. He broke into a wide smile as he noticed Draco and waved him over. It was then that it finally hit Draco that he'd never have to know the feeling of missing Harry again. This wonderful man was his, and the thought sent his heart soaring. Unable to contain the laughter that bubbled out of his throat or the tears in his eyes, Draco ran over to Harry's waiting arms.
“Dad?” Scorpius inquired, unable to tell if the man was awake or not. Harry didn’t really acknowledge him, but he did shift a bit, which told Scorpius he was at least listening.
“No one asked you,” Bryan mumbled, turning to the counter and slamming his key down. Harry frowned at that.
“Lunch?” Harry called back, confused. It was early morning, why would everyone be going for lunch. With a groan, he groped around on the bedside table for his watch, only to gasp in shock as he realised that Bryan was actually making sense. It was almost 1:00 PM. Merlin, how had he slept so late?
“Harry, shut up,” she groaned. “Maybe he was visiting a friend who works there, or maybe they’re researching something that has perfectly legal medical applications. Either way, it’s
“I thought we could visit the American Museum of Dragonology and Creature Heritage. They supposedly have a dragon reserve somewhere up in the state of Washington, but I figured just the museum might be enough for us.”
They found Harry’s friends at their usual table. He received a couple of raised eyebrows and confused stares—he’d only told Hermione and Ron that he was seeing Draco, after they’d interrogated him about why they’d danced together at the Gala. He’d warned the others that he was bringing someone he’d been seeing, but obviously none of them had expected
Harrison approached the evidence bench and handed the duty Auror a plastic sleeve containing the two pictures found in the journal. Scorpius watched anxiously as the Auror projected an image of each side of the sleeve, so that the entire Wizengamot could see it at once. Scorpius normally felt proud whenever he saw evidence he’d collected being displayed like this, knowing that he was contributing to justice. But all he could feel in the moment was the worry clawing at his heart.
“The two friends were so happy to see each other again, that they decided they would spend the rest of their lives together. They loved each other, and once dragons find their true loves, they never leave them again. So Harry and Draco lived happily ever after. The end!”
“It’s more common than you’d think,” Draco said, offering him a silk handkerchief. “And that’s not a bad thing. We’re all human, and we’re allowed to feel strong emotions, especially when we’ve suffered.”
Agent Delta stopped to collect their thoughts before stepping into the Floo. They had to remember that they were once an intern as well, and that everyone had to start somewhere. There were worse things than having to commute between offices because the charm linking them had failed.
McGonagall looked like she wanted to say something, but at that moment, the server returned with their drinks. Once she was gone, Draco gestured for McGonagall to continue, but she merely shrugged.
Scorpius’ eyes lit up at the mention of chocolate, and Harry wasn’t surprised to see that Draco’s did too. Before long, they were on their way to Ghirardelli Square. The thought of riding a cable car seemed forgotten in their taxi—Harry had failed to remember that even a normal car would be a new experience for his travel companions.
“I love you too,” Draco replied. As they lay there in each others’ arms, drifting slowly to sleep, Draco had no doubt that Harry was right. They just had to keep moving forward together, and everything would be alright.
It seemed Scorpius had stopped listening once he’d heard Harry’s name though, because he started knocking incessantly and calling out “Harry! Harry, I’m here! Let me in, Harry!”
The next few days continued much in the same way. They would spend most of the day wandering the city, exploring new cuisines and historical sites. Having a five-year-old in tow was quite an experience for Harry. He’d never considered how different a child’s needs could be. Scorpius often got tired from lots of walking, and was never shy about asking for souvenirs or snacks that caught his eye. By their third day, Harry found that he and Draco were able to communicate just from looking at each other, deciding in a split second glance who would deal with Scorpius’ next tantrum or indulge his next whim. He was also surprised to find that the city looked very different from a child’s perspective.
Harry turned to stare down the hall at the collection of identical doors, wondering which one might be an office. It was probably a very risky move to be snooping around in Draco’s flat, especially since he’d only said he was going to the washroom—that wouldn’t take very long. Though he wasn’t a Gryffindor for nothing.
“Unfortunately no. The victim is always alone when it happens, and neither of them remember anything. It’s definitely someone who knows a lot about creatures though.”
“Well, I had two ideas. Maybe you can help me pick?” When Scorpius nodded eagerly, Harry continued. “My first idea was that we could go for a ride on a cable car. It’s like a small train that muggles built to take them around the city.”
"Just a little.. ah, sore," he mumbled. Bryan also blushed at that, and Draco's confused expression twisted into one of horror.
“It doesn’t seem to have been affected at all. I can still feel my power through my wand, and not a single spell has failed so far.”
“I wonder why the attacker is Transfiguring people into animals. It seems a weird way to get revenge on someone.”
“Well, if you’re confident you can visualise a whole and healthy child, I’m sure you could Transfigure her incomplete body into a whole and functioning one.”
Draco flapped his wings and ran to join Harry in the middle of the stage. Harry felt surprisingly reassured that Draco was back by his side.
There was a pause, during which neither of them knew what to do. Harry was sure that people in romantic relationships usually had some kind of affectionate gesture when they parted ways—Hemione and Ron always gave each other a kiss, but that seemed a bit much for him.
Draco nodded as he swallowed a mouthful of soup. Harry could only hope it tasted better than whatever was in his sandwich.
“Man, you are old,” Jackie chuckled, causing everyone else to laugh. “Why did we all think you were 23?”
Draco took his pyjamas and shuffled into the washroom to get ready for bed, the silence weighing heavily. Once he’d put his things away and the time came to actually get into bed, however, things started to feel more natural. Without having to talk about it, they both got in from their own sides of the bed, Harry tossing an extra throw blanket over Draco for warmth, before Draco spelled the lights out. They lay there in silence, listening to each others’ breathing, and Draco thought he could almost be lulled to sleep by the familiar sound, if it wasn’t for everything that was racing through his brain.
“You’re still an open book,” Draco added apologetically. “I could tell from your face that you were wondering. I can’t quite balance a plate on my lap, so sitting on the sofa doesn’t work.” He reached the island as he said all this. Leaning up against it with one arm, he pulled his wand out of his pocket, and with a wide flourish, dishes flew out of the various cupboards and drawers until two places were set at the island.
“I’m thinking about how much of a loss the restaurant must be going into if it feeds people like you every day,” Harry sighed.
Scorpius wrinkled his nose. "I don't really like sand. It got in my shoes when we were at the beach and it was all itchy."
“You two left together last night, didn’t you?” Joel said slyly. Harry blushed at that, but at that moment Bryan himself showed up, rucksack slung over his back as well.
“Scorpius…” Head Auror Clearwater seemed hesitant about what she was going to say, but Scorpius watched her patiently, waiting eagerly for her next suggestion. A sense of relief was flooding through him—he’d been right! His father wasn’t a criminal!
“We do have ethical overview,” Draco explained. “The Department of Mysteries isn’t running completely unchecked. It just doesn’t go through your office.”
day off, and everything goes to shit,” Teddy complained. He was clearly gearing up for a rant, but Scorpius cut him off immediately, knowing his time was limited.
“Draco, that’s amazing,” Pansy said, handing the letter back. “It doesn’t give us a lot of time for goodbyes, though, if you start in two days.”
“I wish I could have seen that. If he was as good as Dad, their games must have been thrilling to watch.”
“Harry, how is it that wherever you travel, you manage to get married! That’s what you’re here for, isn’t it?”
“But I can’t—oh.” Draco was so absorbed in his thoughts about the case that it took him a moment to realise McGonagall was right—the patient’s magical core hadn’t caused the issue, so theoretically, Transfiguring her should work.
“Daneri says you already have very good eyebrows,” Hassan pointed out. Harry felt a sense of relief at that. Back home, he’d always been conscious of his noticeably bushy eyebrows—it was nice to have them to be considered favourable for once.
Malfoy shrugged. “I was wondering if it could be revenge. The first patient was the daughter of a Wizengamot member. But the second patient had nothing to do with either of them. His brother is an advocate for magical heritage who’s won some high profile cases to protect magical nature reserves, but that’s the only time anyone from their family has interacted with the Wizengamot.”
First off, thanks for the hangover potion. I was barely able to get out of bed this morning to let your owl in. If I never have to see a shot again in my life, I’ll be a happy man.
Harry snorted. “I don’t think Malfoy’s capable of friendship,” he mumbled. “Anyways, I’ve never seen Unspeakables bring friends into the department. It’s always just them.”
“Oh, have you finally registered with a General Healer?” Hermione asked curiously. “I’ve been reminding you to do that for years.”
“Where have you been?” Carol demanded. “We were looking everywhere! We couldn’t find you or Bryan all night!”
"Harry, that's an amazing accomplishment. You should be proud of yourself! You helped so many people, and you did it so selflessly."
The conversation continued to flow as their food arrived. The ravioli was delicious, and Malfoy somehow managed to make eating a cheeseburger look graceful. He even offered Harry a few of his chips, which were coated in some fancy seasoning but tasted incredible.
I'm about to trip in the middle of a dance. Oh Merlin, you're going to want me to dance, aren't you?
There was a retort ready on his lips, but Malfoy’s smile made it clear that he was the one who was teasing here. Harry chuckled, letting it go as he turned the conversation back on Malfoy.
If there was one certainty in the world, it was that Draco hated reading Ministry documents. They were usually tedious and full of unnecessary information. Thankfully they had adopted the use of Handwriting Charms on their quills a few years ago—certain reports had been completely illegible before that change. Not that Healers had any better penmanship than anyone at the Ministry, but at least the hospital had adopted Handwriting Charms well before Draco had arrived.
“Nonsense! If I’m being honest, I’m a little worried you’ll splinch yourself getting back with how distracted you are.”
“The court calls to order Day 2 of the appeal hearing for Draco Lucius Malfoy. Today’s meeting should be short, I would simply like to confirm with Mr. Malfoy what actually happened 15 years ago. Head Auror Clearwater, can we bring the defendant in please?”
As Potter opened the door and stuck his head out nervously, it suddenly struck him that he was about to look at Potter’s arse. There was a time when young Draco would have been thrilled to see Potter with his bare arse up in a Healer’s office, but humiliating his rival no longer had any appeal. Especially since said rival possessed a rather nice arse. Taking a deep breath, Draco reminded himself that he was a professional and stepped into the room.
After reassuring his dad he’d be home in time for dinner and seeing him out to the elevator, Scorpius turned back to the folders on his desk. His first order of priority was to read the transcripts from the trials and the various interrogations with Silverthorn. Contrary to his father, Silverthorn had had an army of lawyers defending him, and the trial had dragged on forever. There had been multiple Aurors and prosecutors involved, and he’d also had many more charges brought up against him. Thankfully that bit helped him filter what to read. His father hadn’t been involved in the potions smuggling, fraud or corruption, which eliminated 2 of the folders. Unfortunately for Scorpius, the crime of murdering the Minister for Magic was complex, especially since the prosecutors had pushed for a charge of terrorism, which usually involved the input of the International Confederation of Wizards.
Agent Delta shrugged. “We had dinner last night. I think it went well enough that we’ll do it again.”
Scorpius shook his head. “No, I’m quite sure we haven’t. My name is Scorpius Greengrass. But you may have known my birth parents, Draco and Astoria Malfoy.”
Out of all the eventualities he had prepared for, having the door open to reveal a stern looking elderly man yelling at him in a language he didn't understand was not one of them. He thought for a moment that he'd gotten the wrong house, but then Camilla appeared in the hall, dressed in a beautiful green dress and looking at Harry apologetically.
“He does cook other things,” Draco told him. “Especially in the evenings, he’ll usually grill some chicken or fish. He just leaves casseroles whenever you’re coming, because he wants something you can easily heat up. He keeps saying he doesn’t want to bother you.”
Harry shrugged. “I didn’t necessarily mean I wanted to date someone from school. I just… it doesn’t quite feel right to start a relationship like that.”
"Um, my parents left me enough when they died." He didn't want to reveal that he was rather wealthy quite yet—he found people always treated him differently for it. Her eyes went wide at his statement however, and he realised with a start that while he may have made peace with the fact that his parents were gone many years ago, it was still jarring for strangers when he told them about it.
“Why don’t you finish dessert while I go settle this,” Malfoy suggested, already getting up from his chair.
Draco gave him a knowing smile, understanding immediately why the country would appeal to Harry so much. There was no way he could accidentally get married in a country where the customs were so similar to theirs, and where everyone spoke English. Scorpius, not knowing that Harry had been married and divorced three times now, didn’t get the joke, though.
Harry nodded. He summoned a flyer he’d picked up while they were in the wizarding sector earlier that day.
“Take care Harry. I’m sorry there was so much confusion at the end of your trip, but I hope you enjoyed the rest of it.”
He had actually been keeping an eye on Draco all afternoon, but in a more literal sense. The man was very fit, and his arse looked fantastic on a broom. Harry had lost more than one round of catch-the-Snitch because he hadn’t been able to stop staring. It wasn’t just his body, either. Draco had a confident smile that made Harry pause every time he saw it. It was nothing like the malicious smirk he’d often received in school—rather than make him angry and agitated, it set him at ease for reasons he couldn’t quite explain.
Before he knew it, dinner was over, the kitchen was clean, Teddy was in bed, and he found himself sitting in the living room with his aunt, sipping on the wine he’d bought.
“But you both have to tell me exactly where to look. It’s going to be awkward if I’m the only parent in there and you’re not even giving me directions.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “I can’t imagine where he gets it from,” he groused. Draco smiled at that, and the sight made Harry’s heart ache for the years they could have had. Not wanting to dwell on the what-ifs, he turned back to the main room. He made his way over to the fridge, and was surprised to find that it was now covered in photographs. Pictures of Scorpius and Teddy racing on their brooms, opening presents on Christmas morning, each of their graduations, Scorpius’ first day as an Auror—all the special memories of the last 15 years had found their way onto the fridge. Harry couldn’t help smiling at the collection of memories, the sight of Teddy and Scorpius waving happily at the camera in every one.
He’d have Stibbons fired for this—the incompetent troll had somehow messed up countless parts of the body when Transfiguring the patient back into a human. The Diagnostic Spells kept coming back inconclusive, so here Draco was, systematically casting Projection Spells on every single body part he could think of with multiple anatomy textbooks lying all over at three o’clock in the morning. His patient had already gone blue in the face from not being able to breath since there had been so few alveoli in her lungs, and then suffered sepsis because she had no glomeruli.
Though Harry didn’t have a hope in the world of being able to follow the chanting, he mimicked the movements and facial expressions of the others. He’d been instructed to smile widely to show off his teeth. While it was awkward and a little tiring to hold his mouth open for so long, Harry found that the constant smiling was boosting his mood. It felt a little silly, but it was also fun and happy, and just made him want to smile even more.
“I did,” Harry assured him. “I’m definitely going back as a changed man.” He grinned at Hassan, and was relieved when his host laughed at the joke. A changed man was definitely one way to put it.
People in romantic relationships knew all kinds of things about each other. They usually spent lots of time together, and even visited each others’ homes. Surely getting close to him would be a perfect way to figure out what Malfoy really
The determination in Draco’s voice went a long way towards making Harry feel a bit better. He wiped his face again, casting a quick cleaning charm over the handkerchief before handing it back to Draco with a mumbled thanks.
“Oh, that’s good,” Harry admitted. Pleased, Bryan kept offering him bites of it in between inhaling all the ice cream he’d selected. Harry couldn’t help noticing that it was a rather intimate thing to do, but considering how delicious the cake was, he couldn’t be arsed. The kids probably didn’t care anyway; he’d seen them offering each other bites of their food throughout his trip, as if it was a totally normal thing to do between friends. After all, what did he know about being normal?
It was partly the department’s fault too. Who in their right mind would put an intern in charge of Alternate Entrance Management with no direct supervision? Those were complicated spells for even the most brilliant Charms scholars—nothing a child should be trifling with.
“They did,” Eta pointed out. “But they couldn’t match it to any records, so the only thing it’ll tell you is that you’re looking at the same assailant in both cases.”
He opened his mouth to argue, but at that moment his foot landed in the grate and he was swept into the flames. He emerged in the hotel lobby, coughing up a mouthful of ash. Thankfully, there was no one around to see his less than dignified entrance, but as he made his way upstairs and bid John goodnight, he couldn’t help thinking that his aunt really was a rather clever woman.
Harry soon noticed that they were drawing the attention of other families in the area, but since Scorpius didn’t seem to mind, neither did he. He watched happily as Scorpius called instructions to Draco, who was looking highly annoyed with all the sand, but even more determined to make his son happy. Every time he looked up and acknowledged Scorpius’ instructions, he made sure to have a big smile on his face, and would follow the directions without hesitating, even if they were clearly sending him astray. Harry couldn’t help wondering how few people ever got to see this loving and caring side of Draco, the one that cherished his son so much that he’d put aside his comfort and his dignity just to make him smile. Feeling privileged to be allowed to witness it, Harry smiled along as well.
"Are those meeting rooms available?" he asked, pointing at the glass panelled rooms just off the lobby.
Malfoy nodded. “A Healer’s job is always interesting. The human body can be very complex. Healing and caring for it even more so.”
“That’s why you’ve been coming to help me, isn’t it? Because Scorpius asked you?” Draco asked softly. Harry gave him a confused look.
Harry sat down in the soft leather chair in front of Draco’s desk, watching as the man sighed heavily at the papers he was holding, and slipped them into a drawer next to him.
Since staying out all day took quite a lot out of Scorpius, they usually found themselves back in the hotel by dinner time, ordering room service or pizza and relaxing in front of the TV. Tonight was no exception, and as usual, Scorpius was snoring loudly on his father’s lap by the time the credits rolled.
You didn’t assault me last night. You breathed life into me, and dammit Draco, I really like you. I didn’t think, a week ago, that I would. But seemingly against all odds, I do. As the bard said, “
Teddy sighed and sank down onto the couch, gesturing for Harry to do the same. Ignoring him, Harry continued to pace. If he stopped moving, he was bound to explode.
The next week was incredibly busy, but also a lot of fun. Harry woke up early with the rest of the family every day and had breakfast with them. He and Camilla would then go into her father's workshop and load up the toys he'd made the previous day, before carrying them over to the shop and opening for the day. He spent most of the day with her in the shop, helping her clean and playing with the children who visited.
," he moaned, watching all the other children running around in a giant sandpit, most of them barefoot with the cuffs of their trousers rolled up.
He turned to her father, wondering if the man might give him any hint, but he was simply sitting there, staring curiously at Harry. Harry smiled at him, glancing again at Camilla before looking at the man again, who suddenly seemed to be quite happy too.
“You’re still quite young,” Mr. Taber said, peering closely at Scorpius. “You must have many friends and family members still. It’s hard to understand this kind of loneliness until you’re in it.”
Once he'd been deemed ready to go, Camilla's father led him out of the house and down the walkway into the village. It wasn't long before Harry realised they were headed to the church. Everyone else walking up the drive seemed to be dressed rather nicely too, and Harry assumed they were taking him for some kind of prayer. He wasn't in the least bit religious, but it was touching that they'd thought to include him in what was obviously an important morning for them.
“This isn’t properly filled,” Harry said, feeling more and more annoyed with every moment. He’d been leaning over to ask if she had anything to wipe the side of the bowl with, when he’d noticed that she hadn’t even given Draco a full serving. The man worked long and hard hours—a half bowl of soup wasn’t going to be enough to sustain him.
“The dragons had other friends too, but they liked to hang out with each other the most. One day, Harry had to go away on a migration with his family, and had to leave Draco behind.”
Scorpius barely even heard the gavel bang, or the chatter of the Wizengamot members filing out of the courtroom. He turned to look at his father, who was still staring up at the Chief Warlock as if he couldn’t believe what was happening. Harrison looked like she was about to say something to him, but she suddenly straightened up and waved Scorpius over. Not needing to be told twice, he raced down to where they were seated, Teddy close behind him.
“Do you want him in Azkaban because of his crimes, or because he hurt you?” Teddy asked. There was no malice in his tone, but Harry still felt as if Teddy had crucioed him.
"Draco. You've been portkeying all over the world for me, to deal with my mistakes. You literally dropped everything to come here right away. The least I could do was watch your son. Anyway, he wasn't a handful, I had fun today."
“I thought it might be nice to celebrate your new job,” Harry said, leading Draco over to the group. They were greeted by a chorus of congratulations and well wishes.
“Harry was telling me about Selpie tonight, and I pieced the clues together. I don’t think he realises yet that Selpie was the culprit. He was wracked with guilt over the fact that his review led to budget cuts and job reassignments.”
went a step too far, I’ve already had my solicitor send them an owl addressing it. You shouldn’t be harangued for attending an event with friends with assumptions and claims such as those.
As a consolation for the fact that this was his last day in the beautiful apartment, Draco let himself have a bit of a lie in, which led to him falling right back to sleep. When he woke up again, he was shocked to find that it was almost 10:30. He rolled out of bed and padded into the bathroom to get dressed, making it out to the hall in record time. There was an apology ready on his lips for Harry, but the man was nowhere to be found.
Scorpius was delighted to see his dad’s lips twitch, as if he was fighting back a smile. His expression quickly turned morose again.
“Well they’d realised she was missing by the time we got there. I took charge handling the Hippogriff since I have experience from dealing with Buckbeak, and everyone else spread out to look for the girl. The Hippogriff didn’t bow back, however, and just went over to the mantle and started pecking at all the pictures of the girl. It didn’t take long to put two and two together.”
Malfoy gave him a small smile. “Exciting isn’t necessarily better,” he pointed out. “Surely you of all people know that.”
It still felt a little disconcerting, however, as Harry led him into the unfamiliar kitchen and put the kettle on for tea. He looked around, soaking in all the details that made this place home for Harry and Scorpius. He smiled at the adorable snitch-shaped salt and pepper shakers, and the Hogwarts-house aprons hanging on the pantry door. There was a collection of photographs on the fridge, and while Draco recognised some from Scorpius’ flat, there were others that he’d never seen before, and he was excited to hear the stories behind them.
“What’s all that?” Draco asked, making his way over to the kitchen island. Their lunches were still a little awkward at times, but they had gotten better at navigating conversations with each other, talking mostly about Scorpius and Teddy. Draco never seemed to tire of hearing about the boys, and Harry was only too happy to indulge in trips down memory lane.
I have some shocking news for you this morning about our beloved Saviour. More recently, you may recognise him as the biggest business tycoon in Europe. So many of us feel safe buying from and investing with him, thinking that we can trust the man who saved our world from the forces of darkness, against all odds. But can we?
Draco agreed, but as their conversation moved on, Scorpius kept focusing on what he’d said. “Things worked out in the end.” As Teddy returned with the most garish clothes possible, and they laughed and chatted their way through the evening, Scorpius started to feel more at ease about the daunting task that lay ahead of him—caring for his ill father.
“Potter,” Draco said, stepping out from around the corner. “We’ve made it clear that I don’t take general appointments. Why do you insist on pestering the poor reception staff?”
“I will, don’t worry,” Teddy said casually. His expression then turned serious. “Are you doing okay?” he asked.
"Wear," he said, pointing at the robes. Harry tried slipping his trousers on under his towel, feeling a little self conscious in front of his host, who didn't seem to think it was necessary to give Harry any privacy. It only just worked, and he continued to get dressed quickly. He was surprised to find that the robes were fairly comfortable, and looked rather smart. He was still admiring his reflection in the mirror when Camilla's father came up behind him and started playing with his hair. He was just wondering how to tell the man that it was hopeless, when his hair actually flattened out. Harry was sure it had been a spell—he was just annoyed that he didn't know
Harry looked up at Draco in concern. Harry had flown in a plane as well, since there was a ban on portkeys in the region, but it hadn’t affected him at all—he’d simply slept through the entire trip. He felt terrible that Draco had suffered through that for him.
“So the only way to make sure she’s okay is what I just did? To go over everything in her body and make sure it’s all in place?”
“I wrote to the hospital last night requesting an appointment with Healer Malfoy, but I got a reply that he’s not taking patients right now. I was wondering if it was at all possible to make an exception?”
Harry got off the train and made it to his hotel in record time, stopping only to wash his face, put on a fresh pair of clothes, and grab one of the spoons from his suitcase, before racing into the village towards Camilla’s home. He paused outside the oor to catch his breath for a moment, and then knocked cheerfully. The door swung open to reveal her mother in a beautifully embroidered apron.
Hassan sat down next to him. "I think you look very good," he said reassuringly. "You are tall, and have very white teeth. Those are very important here. But anyway, it is fun, even if you are not the most beautiful man there."
Harry nodded, still chuckling. Meeting at dinner would give him time to go back to the hostel and grab his stuff, too. He watched Draco and Scorpius disappear down the hall, before making his way up to his own room. He changed quickly and disapparated back to the hostel. Thankfully, all his stuff was mostly packed, so he was able to just grab his rucksack and go. He was just checking out at the front desk when he heard a familiar voice behind him.
“I’m glad you’re standing up for your teammates, but Penelope can take care of herself, she’s Head Auror for a reason.”
He had just taken off his shoes and taken in the beautiful suite, when he heard Scorpius’ voice from the other side of the wall.
After a sleepless night, Harry was nursing a cup of coffee in front of the floo, hoping that Scorpius would call. He startled when the flames flashed green, and for the first time in his life, he was disappointed to see Teddy’s face.
