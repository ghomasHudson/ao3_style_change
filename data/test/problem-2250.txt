Suddenly, Pansy reached out and grabbed Draco’s arm. “Draco. Draco, I want you to do something for me.”
“How so? I mean, he let Remus attend school here and even gave him a job and most of the wizarding world is prejudice against werewolves,” Harry said.
gay, Remy,” Harry said and then he told the werewolf what had happened over the past week. He even gave Remus all of his real reasons for the choices he had made. Harry was a little nervous about how Remus would take hearing about his Slytherin tendencies, but Remus was as understanding as always.
Harry sat between Ginny and Neville at dinner. Ron and Hermione sat across from him, but said nothing to him during the meal. Ginny kept up a steady stream of chatter, going out of her way to try to make Harry laugh. Harry managed to relax, even with Ron and Hermione’s silent presence sitting across from him.
“What?” Ginny asked, confused. “But I thought you were gay?”
Harry sighed again. “There’s actually one more thing I should probably tell you.”
Harry nodded slowly. He couldn’t imagine what Lucius Malfoy wanted to discuss with him, but he would talk with the man. Harry only hoped he could get him to agree to switch sides.
Pansy started to cry softly. “I know. But…I just…I wanted a family. Someone who would love me,” she said softly. “My parents…they treat me like a possession, a commodity. I didn’t have the decency to be a boy so the only way I can be useful to them is by marrying into a pureblood wizard family with money and status…money and status that they would get a part of by marrying me off.”
love with her. I never was, even when we were dating.”
“No buts, Harry! You can’t avoid it forever.”
“You would really marry me?” Pansy asked.
Ginny threw herself into Harry’s arms, being careful of Vi. “Oh, Harry!” she wailed.
Snape inclined his head. “Unless you were just talking when you said you would go against the Headmaster himself if the need arose?”
Harry shrugged. “I never leave anything here that matters.”
“Yeah?” Harry called out.
Harry grimaced. “Yeah, Madam Pomfrey showed us.” His grin returned. “You should have seen the faces Draco made!”
Pansy sat up straight and held her head up proudly. “Yes, Granger, he did.” She held out her hand and smiled. “Isn’t it beautiful?”
Harry snorted. “She didn’t even ask did she?”
Harry and Ginny shuffled over to the light by Harry’s bed. A few minutes later there was a knock on Harry’s bedroom door.
“About?” Snape asked, setting aside the quill he had been writing with.
Harry left the infirmary and found Snape waiting for him in the corridor.
It was eleven in the morning on a Saturday so Harry knew that all three of his muggle relatives were probably home. They tried to save up all of their outings for the summer so that they could avoid him. That and Dudley liked to sleep in on the weekends.
Harry watched as Madam Pomfrey shooed them out of the room. When the door closed behind them, he groaned and ran a hand through his hair.
Pansy suddenly tensed and leaned closer as if to protect her baby. “I don’t think so, Granger.”
“I have a difficult time believing that, given our history, you would suggest that I am not only quite intelligent, but also extremely powerful, much less that you would suggest I am somehow either Albus’ or the Dark Lord’s equal,” Snape said.
Harry stared at the older man in shock.
Harry sighed again as the door closed behind them. The two Slytherins were still staring at Harry.
The Headmaster raised his wand and performed a short spell. As he did, a blue light appeared and connected Parkinson with the baby in her arms. A red light appeared and connected Harry to the baby, which was now surrounded by a light purple aura.
Harry rolled his eyes back. “I have to write to Remus anyway.” He walked over to the small desk in the corner of the living room and took a pen, an envelope and some paper, ignoring his aunt’s outraged gasp and his uncle’s blustering. Then he went into the kitchen to sit at the kitchen table to write his letter.
“Yes, Granger. Of everything that’s wrong with this picture, worry about Pansy’s jewelry,” Draco sneered.
Just then, they heard a loud commotion outside the room. Dumbledore frowned and removed the wards to look out. As soon as the wards fell, they heard Madam Pomfrey say, “You can’t go in there!“ and then several people spilled into the room.
Pansy and Ginny both looked uncertain, but Snape reached out and gently pulled Ginny’s hand towards Pansy until Pansy could see the matching gold band in the box for Harry. Harry’s band was thicker and lacked the pansies etched on Pansy’s ring, making it much more masculine. Pansy took the ring out of the box and slipped it onto the finger Harry held out for her.
“Obviously you were not quite as gay as you thought,” Snape said.
Of course, now that there was no real malice behind their sniping at one another they found they both went further in their…teasing. To outsiders, it looked like things had suddenly gotten much, much worse between them after the lesson in which Harry saw Snape’s memories. At one point, even Dumbledore had sat them down to talk about their interactions with each other. Snape had been surprised when he noticed Harry was just as amused as he was by the lecture they received.
As soon as Harry had Vi in the living room, Pansy’s door shut behind him and he felt a silencing charm go up. He looked down at Violet, who was blinking sleepily up at him, and said, “I wonder if your mother is telling your godfather about us. Her and me, I mean.” Harry smiled at his daughter. “Draco already knows about you. And,” Harry looked to the closed bedroom door and dropped his voice to a whisper, “I think he’s already fallen in love with you too. But let’s not tell anyone, hmm? He’s a Malfoy.” Harry opened his eyes comically wide and then he smiled when his daughter responded with a gurgle.
Harry took a deep breath. “Yes.”
Ginny sighed. “Hermione, I was cheating on Harry the entire time we were together. And Harry found out about it and never said anything. I could hardly be upset with him.”
Dumbledore’s bushy white brows rose. “Remus? I must admit I had thought you would want Molly’s help. I had been in the middle of writing the letter asking her-”
Severus stared at Harry. “I can see you put a lot of thought into this,” he finally said.
Ginny blushed. “Well, it’s just…Ever since you and Ron became friends and because of the crush I used to have on you…well, everyone in the family thinks we are ‘meant to be’ and they keep hinting that they expect us to get back together and…I know they mean well, but the pressure is really intense, Harry. And I don’t want Luna to meet my family and think they are disappointed because they don’t like her.”
Severus went through a door Harry had always wondered about. Apparently, Snape’s office was connected to his private quarters.
“What about ‘Violet?’ And we can call her ‘Vi.’ You know, like boys will
“Daughter?” Draco asked.
Draco ignored her. When Vi looked at him again, he smiled.
Dumbledore had sent Remus out on one last assignment. Since Remus couldn’t touch Vi until after the ceremony naming Draco her godfather, there wasn’t much he could do to help Pansy and Harry at the moment and he was an important member of the Order. He would be back in time for the ceremony.
Harry stared at the old man. While he could understand why Snape, as her Head of House, would need to know this he had no idea what he was doing there. Surely the poor girl deserved better than to have a guy she hates see her like that.
“Minerva, Harry. What a surprise. What can I do for you?” Dumbledore asked.
Draco frowned. He shouldn’t ask, but again he couldn’t stop himself. “Then why did you date her for so long?”
“I thought I’d take Vi for a while. Let you two talk freely for a bit,” Harry suggested with a shrug.
“Thank you, Narcissa,” Harry said, smirking at the stunned Draco Malfoy sitting across from him.
“Pansy, you gave me a daughter. And, like you, I know just how precious a gift that is,” Harry said, stroking his daughter’s cheek again. “We may have had our differences in the past, but…if the only thing I can do for you is to help free you from your parents, I’m going to do it.”
Narcissa’s frown eased. “Still, Lucius. I want to start making plans. I want to see Draco married soon. Who have you chosen?”
Ginny blinked up at Harry, looked around the room in confusion and then turned a sheepish, apologetic smile to Harry. “Sorry.”
“Pansy…she’s
Harry walked over and stood where is was told. He looked over at Parkinson and noticed she refused to look at him. He turned back to the Headmaster and the Potions professor.
“Harry-” Pansy started.
Harry moaned and removed his hand from over his eyes. Ginny had her back to him and she was holding her dress up with one hand and her hair with the other. Harry fumbled with the zipper for a while and then said, “Here, let’s move over here to the light.”
“Well, until the ceremony naming you Vi’s godfather, no one else can touch her. However, all three of us have class. We can’t switch off. Someone would notice. I thought Pansy had the best excuse to miss class. You could bring her her classwork and you and I could watch Vi after classes and during the weekends to give Pansy a chance to rest.” Harry shrugged. It was the only thing he could think of to solve the dilemma.
“Don’t be, Gin. If I hadn’t seen you and Luna kissing, I might still be in denial about being gay myself.”
“Well, Minerva. I fear the only solution is to give Harry a private room. He will have to keep the location a secret, obviously,” Dumbledore said, “but I shouldn’t think that will be a problem for him.”
“When it’s all over, I want you to be there, Draco. I want you to be there for my daughter,” Pansy said.
“Lucius, I was thinking we could have the Parkinsons over soon. We haven’t had them over for dinner in several months,” Narcissa said to her husband at dinner.
Before she could ask any more questions Harry had dispelled the privacy charm and was standing. “I’ll wait in the corridor.”
Draco stared, wide-eyed, at the little girl in his arms as Harry walked out.
Ginny gasped in horror.
“What?!” Snape and Harry yelled in unison.
Harry rubbed her shoulder soothingly and murmured nonsense words, waiting for Ginny to calm down a bit. Finally, she sat up a bit and wiped her eyes. “Ginny, let me talk to Luna. I can explain some things to her. I’m sure she’ll understand.”
“Fine,” Ron said. He turned and stormed out of the room. Hermione looked torn for a moment, but then she followed after her boyfriend.
Harry blinked. “You mean that Lucius Malfoy is already on our side? That he’s been helping you all of these years?” Harry rolled his eyes when he saw that Snape seemed surprised that he had caught on so quickly. “It wasn’t that hard to figure out when we were talking about him before you went off on this tangent.”
“Pansy, what the hell is going on?” Draco asked.
“Uh, no actually. They don’t know about this yet. They were upset that I decided that Draco would be Violet’s godfather,” Harry said.
Harry rolled his eyes. Since beginning these training sessions with Snape in his fifth year, they had managed to form a truce of sorts. Of course, they only managed this after some of the worse fights they had ever had. The one that occur after Harry had looked at Snape’s memories in the pensieve was particularly spectacular. It was also the reason behind their current truce.
By the time she reached the suite all she wanted was to lay down in bed. But when she walked in she stopped and stared.
“So, Harry,” Hermione said, “have you guys talked yet about who you are going to name Violet’s godfather or godmother? I read last night that there’s a ceremony when a child is three weeks old where the parents officially name the godmother or godfather.”
and put the fire out. “Harry, are you okay?”
“I swear. You know I can keep a secret.”
************************************
Harry gave her a weak smile. “Uh, I decided to name Draco as Violet’s godfather.”
’?” Ron asked in a strangled whisper.
Without asking, Harry pulled Draco’s book towards him. He’d noticed Draco was working on the assignment for DADA and since Harry had finished that assignment already he may as well help. He ignored Draco’s glare and said, “This one’s easier to figure out if you look at the chart in the next chapter.”
“You really have thought about this quite a lot,” Severus said thoughtfully. “You have known less than twenty-four hours that you have a daughter and you have thought through all of that.” He shook his head. “You would have done well in Slytherin.”
That night, the occupants of the suite settled into their new home. Harry and Pansy both had a baby bed in their room for Violet and they agreed to take turns getting up with her in the night.
, the Headmaster and Snape obviously saw something to worry about.
Snape raised an eyebrow. Harry just shrugged again. Snape rolled his eyes and said, “Go look anyway.”
************************************
Harry glared and shrugged. “I tried to tell you, but you both refused to listen to anything I had to say. You were too busy giving me the cold shoulder to come to my wedding so I had it without you.”
“Promise me, Draco,” Pansy said firmly.
Severus raised an eyebrow. “I take it that is the reason for Mr. Weasley’s little tantrum earlier? I saw him and Miss Granger leave before I arrived.”
Remus and Harry were laughing when the door opened. Pansy came in with Violet in her arms and Draco walked in behind her. Both Slytherins stopped when they saw Remus. Harry and Remus stood.
************************************
“Something like that.”
Harry didn’t even notice. He looked between Parkinson and the Headmaster. “What? That’s not possible!”
Snape surprised Harry by rolling his eyes in return. “Indeed.”
Harry shrugged again. “I freaked out a little bit. I’m certainly never going to be able to sleep again without performing a full check of my bedroom and my bed.” Harry shuddered in disgust. “I was pretty angry for a while as you can see, but then I thought about it and I can’t really think of anything worse than slowly dying and knowing it was your parents who were the ones who killed you.”
Draco nodded and sat on the sofa. Harry carefully handed Vi to him, making sure to keep the bottle in her mouth. Once Draco was settled on the sofa with the little girl, Harry stood and took his book to his room.
When he and Snape finally made it to the lobby of the bank, Harry followed Snape when the man walked to a shadowy corner of the lobby.
Sunday, after breakfast with Pansy, Violet and Remus, Harry headed down to the dungeons. He was a little early, but he wanted to talk with Snape about some things.
“In such a situation it is common for a witch or wizard to be chosen to enforce the clause of the will. Who would you like to empower to enforce your wishes?” Thornspur asked.
“What are you talking about, Hermione?” Harry said. “Of course not! The fewer people who know the longer we can keep this-”
Harry sobered. “I know you have a lot going on right now, but is there anyway you could help Draco convince his parents to change sides? I know you are friends with Draco’s father.”
“What did Madam Pomfrey find?” Harry whispered.
Professor McGonagall might be Harry’s Head of House, but she did not yet know about Violet and Harry wasn’t about to tell her. The Headmaster could deal with that situation when the time came.
“You’ve met the Dark Lord and survived each time. Whether that was luck or power or whatever…I wanted my baby to have it. I-I knew my baby wouldn’t be safe in a world run by the Dark Lord. I never wanted anything to do with him.”
Harry suppressed the semi-hysterical urge to laugh at the shock on the faces of the pureblood students. He gave Pansy’s hands a reassuring squeeze and leaned in. She hesitated for a moment and then lifted her chin and held still. Harry pressed his lips to Pansy’s in a short, chaste kiss. Pansy was blushing when he pulled back.
Draco was almost free when suddenly he lost his balance and fell to the floor. He froze, but Harry didn’t react. When Draco stood he felt another wave of panic wash over him and he frantically looked around the room for Violet. Seeing one of Pansy’s books, Draco rushed to Pansy’s room hoping she’d come back and had Vi.
“What about Ron and Hermione?”
Remus looked at him blankly. “Pansy? You mean Pansy Parkinson?”
Harry gave her a sad look and shook his head.
“Hello,” Draco said a bit stiffly. “Where’s Pansy?”
“Well, my boy,” Dumbledore said, popping a lemon drop into his mouth. “It seems you have saved me the trouble of coming up with an excuse for you to be given your own room.”
“You’ll have to wait until after the ceremony, Granger, since you aren’t the one that was chosen for her godparent,” Draco said.
Harry shrugged and removed the cloak. He and Snape sat down across the desk from the goblin.
“As charming as ever, ‘Tuney,’” Snape drawled mockingly.
Harry just held her and let her cry. When she finally stopped, Harry looked down to see that she had fallen asleep. He looked down at Vi and saw she was asleep too. He smiled and settled more comfortably on the sofa, letting his mind drift. He thought of what to tell Luna and how to help fix things between her and Ginny.
“Harry?” Ginny asked curiously. “How did they find out you cheated on me? And why now?”
Harry nodded. “When she brought Vi to me last night the first time she woke I noticed Pansy was exhausted. I figure since she gets to spend all day with Vi that she wouldn’t mind if I kept her in my room all night. Pansy could use the sleep and I could spend a little more time with Vi.”
“Remus,” Harry whispered. “Do you know a spell to test for Polyjuice?”
Hermione looked at the two pureblood boys. “That’s an
“I agree,” Dumbledore said, nodding. “Tell me, Harry. Do you know why you are here?”
Harry smiled and pushed the ring into place. It fit perfectly.
Ginny shook her head angrily. “Yes, Ron, I had a crush on him when I was younger, but I was never really in love with him. I mean, yes, I’ve come to love him, but not like a boyfriend. I think of him like a brother. And I really wish everyone would stop trying to force us to be together! We aren’t interested in each other, we never will be and I’m sick of people pushing us together! It’s not going to happen!”
Panic flared in the woman’s eyes and she quickly ushered them into the house.
Harry grinned at the Slytherins over Ginny’s shoulder. “Yeah. Hey, Gin, you mind being my best woman?”
Harry had no idea how long he had been sitting there holding two sleeping girls when the door to Pansy’s room opened and Draco came out into the living room. He saw the blond freeze at the sight of him holding Ginny.
Harry nodded. “You see…Ron and Hermione are mad at me because they think I cheated on you. They want me to admit to you what I did and I guess they want me to suffer whatever punishment you see fit to inflict on me.”
Harry moved his arm from around Pansy’s shoulders and held the lemon drop in one hand and pointed his wand at it with the other. The Headmaster and Pansy watched as the lemon drop changed into a gold ring, the clear wrapper becoming a brilliant diamond. Harry put his wand away and then grabbed Pansy’s left hand, grateful she was holding Violet with the other arm.
“Oh,” Ginny said, understanding.
“Apparently, her family
“Albus-” Snape began.
“Well,” Dumbledore said. “I believe I do have a suite available that will meet your needs. I will just write-”
“My parents didn’t even know I was pregnant at the time, but fortunately the way the spell works kept it from harming my baby,” Pansy said.
The change had driven home the difference in Snape’s behavior towards him since their truce began. Slowly, Snape had seemed less and less like a bastard to him. Harry had thought that it was because they weren’t constantly at each other’s throats any more, but now he realized it was actually a change in the way Snape treated him. In private, they actually got along quite well anymore.
*************************************
“Severus,” Remus said with a small smile.
“Your uniform will be suitable. Just take off the robes and we will be ready to go,” Severus said.
“You can’t do that?” Ron asked.
“Harry, you are lucky I thought to bring my make-up with me!” Ginny yelled through the door.
“I was hoping to talk to you before we go to Gringotts,” Harry said.
“You wanna do this, Draco? And I’ve told you to stop calling me by my last name. Especially in front of Violet. Tell your Uncle Draco to stop being so mean,” Harry said. He smiled again when Vi gurgled and waved her arms. “See Draco, Vi said you should stop being so mean.”
The next day was Saturday. After breakfast, Harry went to the infirmary to see Pansy and Violet. Pansy was still in the private room and Madam Pomfrey quickly ushered him into the room before leaving to give them privacy.
“What does it matter?” Ginny said with another toss of her hair. “Come on, Harry! It’s been too long since we’ve sat down and talked. You can sit with me at dinner.”
about Pansy and Violet.
Hermione and Ron’s eyes went wide and Ron’s mouth opened and closed, making him look like a fish. “You cheated on Harry? Why?” Ron asked, bewildered. “You’ve been in love with him for forever!”
“In preparation for this, I have a list of all of your assets here,” the goblin said. Harry noticed it was much more polite than the other goblins he had dealt with. Perhaps that was why he was chosen for this type of work. “Both the Potter and the Black estates, in their entirety, are yours. Also you have a private vault which you do not yet have access too, but which you will need to take into consideration when writing your will. There is-”
Friday Harry was in the living room of his suite waiting for Pansy and Violet when Remus walked in.
Pansy smiled and blinked back tears. She covered her mouth and muffled her teary laugh as Harry and Draco continued to trade quips while trying to change Violet’s diaper.
Harry nodded. “Well, first thing then is if I die before April 16
Four days before the ceremony naming Draco Violet’s godfather, Harry was cornered by Ron and Hermione. He was on his way to dinner in the Great Hall after he noticed his absence was being commented on by his fellow Gryffindors when Ron and Hermione dragged him off to one side of the hallway to talk.
“Smile, Draco. Madam Pomfrey told me that babies like to look at people’s faces. You don’t want her to think you don’t like her,” Pansy said.
Because Hermione and Ron were not talking to him, Harry hadn’t shown them to his suite yet. He got lonely in the evenings and he found himself in Snape’s office of all places.
for her attention?” Pansy asked and then blushed as she realized what she had said.
*************************************
“Hermione, what’s the big deal about the ring?” Ron asked in confusion.
Harry shook his head. “Don’t worry about it. I’ll talk to Ginny and if she can forgive me, then those two won’t have a reason to stay angry with me.” Suddenly, he grinned.
Sunday, just as he had the day before, Harry rushed straight to the infirmary to see Pansy and Violet. This time when he arrived, Draco was already there. When Harry walked into the room, Draco was sitting in the same position Harry had sat in the previous two days. He was on the bed next to Pansy and he was holding Vi.
, I want it clear that I want Draco Malfoy to be my daughter’s godfather and I want the ceremony to take place without any delays.”
Ginny tossed her hair and looked Ron right in the face. “Luna.”
Pansy closed her eyes. “My parents cursed me. It is a subtle curse. I-I only have a few months left. I was lucky. Because of the way the curse works it didn’t affect Vi. But it’s gone too far. There’s nothing anyone can do now. I-” Pansy took another deep breath. “I only have a few months left. I might just barely make it to the beginning of summer break.”
“Are you sure, Pansy? That there’s nothing that can be done?” Harry asked quietly.
“Lupin,” Snape said politely. For him at least. It was only a little sneer.
“Try again, Harry,” Ginny said. “All week Ron and Hermione have acted funny whenever your name is mentioned. They wouldn’t even tell me if you were okay after the attack! Every time I asked, Ron would get all mad and storm off and Hermione would give me this guilty, pitying look. What’s going on, Harry?”
“We won’t be able to hide Violet forever, especially if we are going to give her my last name,” Harry said.
“Vi, tell your Uncle Draco your daddy knows what he’s doing,” Harry said, smiling down at his little girl while trying to change her diaper. Her wiggling was making it difficult for him and Draco was trying to distract her with a toy.
“Thank you,” Dumbledore said. He then used his wand and removed the Disillusionment charm on the bed.
“You are looking forward to telling Weaselette that you cheated on her?” Draco asked with a raised brow.
She looked at him, startled. After searching his face for any sign that he was lying, she suddenly turned her head and pressed her face against his shoulder and started sobbing. Harry just held her and let her cry.
Narcissa gave him a pleased smile and Harry rose and left the room. As he stepped into the hallway, Harry wore a predatory smile. Now that they were formally engaged, Harry was ready to move beyond the light teasing and flirting he had been doing.
“Pansy? Could I hold her?” He shifted on the bed.
When Draco felt Potter’s foot slowly trail up his calf and then start up his thigh, he gave an undignified squeak and bolted from the table.
He suddenly threw himself to the side as yet another curse came in his direction.
Dumbledore waved his wand over their joined hands and a golden halo briefly surrounded their hands before seeming to be absorbed into their wedding bands. “I now pronounce you man and wife. You may,” Dumbledore coughed. “You may kiss the bride.”
Harry looked at her for a moment and then stood with Violet still in his arms. He walked around the bed and put Violet into Draco’s arms. “Here, Draco.  Get to know your goddaughter.”
Even before Draco finished Harry was shaking his head. “I’ll be fine. Besides I have to read the chapter for Charms.” He pulled out his textbook and set it in his lap. Instead of opening the book, Harry looked back down at Violet and stroked her hair. “Your parents will be here in a few days for the ceremony. I’m still not sure where we should have the ceremony. The dungeons are too cold and damp. Even with magic, I don’t want to risk Violet getting sick. Same problem with having the ceremony outside since the ceremony takes place at dawn. And obviously it will have to take place somewhere no one will notice or accidentally stumble upon…” Harry trailed off as he yawned again.
“Malfoy?” Ron asked in disbelief. “You are naming
All three men stared at her blankly.
Harry shook his head and rubbed her shoulder. “Just tell me what’s wrong.”
Draco jerked. “What?”
, Harry thought, semi-hysterically) looked down at the baby in her arms.
Draco Malfoy be named godfather to your daughter, Violet Delphine Potter, in the traditional wizarding ceremony. Severus Snape, with the full backing of the law and Gringotts bank, will ensure that this is done.” He looked up at the two wizards sitting across from him and waited.
“Come on! I hadn’t realized I was gone so long,” Harry said.
Violet started to cry. Draco cuddled her close and managed to quiet her just before the door opened.
“Not without putting you at risk,” Harry said. Draco turned his glare on Harry. Harry shrugged. “She cares about you.”
Harry nodded and cleared his throat. “Uh, more like, Pansy just
“Oh,” Ginny said softly.
After dropping Ginny off at the Tower and then hunting down and talking to Luna, Harry headed back to the suite.
On the way back to his suite after dinner, Harry turned when he heard his name called. He was surprised to see Snape walk out of the shadows. At a gesture from the man, Harry turned and walked with him.
The feel of Harry’s arm brushing against his chest, of Harry’s hand unintentionally caressing down his stomach almost caused Draco to groan. It was only the feel of Violet in his arms, reminding him of Pansy that stopped Draco from doing something stupid. Without the shield of insults and arrogance to protect himself with, Draco knew he was in danger of Harry finding out about how Draco felt about him.
Snape turned and both his brows lifted as he caught sight of the damaged and the decimated targets at the far end of the room. He turned back to Harry.
“Of course.”
After a while, Ron got bored again. He especially couldn’t take any more of Harry and ‘
Narcissa frowned at her husband. “Well, yes. I’ve known that for years, Lucius.”
Harry’s smiled turned into a frown when he caught sight of an envelope with his name on it lying on top of the book he had left out. Holding Vi with one hand, Harry picked the envelope up. It was Remus’ handwriting. Harry continued to frown as he struggled to open the letter while holding Vi. His frown deepened as he read the letter.
Pansy headed straight for the library to work on an essay for Transfiguration. She didn’t really care about her grades, it’s not like she was going to graduate in any case, but she was tired of being cooped up. As much as she loved her daughter and Draco and as nice as Harry had been, she was feeling confined and could use sometime to wander around freely.
Harry shrugged. “I thought so. Well, I have to go give the Headmaster my letter to Remy.”
Pansy looked at the ring curiously. “Yes, Harry. I’ll marry you.”
Draco sneered. “You can’t have two godparents, Granger. Not unless the people chosen are a married couple.”
Snape just stared at Harry for a moment. “And?”
Harry winced. “Sorry,” he muttered.
Violet’s godfather?” Hermione asked, sounding hurt.
“Harry, my zipper’s stuck. Can you get it?” Ginny asked.
He apologized to Pansy for not asking her opinion, but she seemed too relieved that he had chosen someone other than Mrs. Weasley to mind. Since she and Draco couldn’t come up with anyone else anyway, it was agreed that Remus would be a suitable babysitter especially when Harry assured them that Remus had somewhere to go on the nights of the full moon.
Without looking away from them, Pansy picked her camera up off the coffee table and snapped picture after picture. She paused for a moment as the moved, but they only settled more comfortably together-which involved what looked suspiciously like a great deal of snuggling. She snapped several more pictures before smiling and leaving them like that.
Harry heard the older man come in and he went and sat down on the sofa set to one side of the room. He and Snape sometimes talked before or after their training sessions and the area had been set up with protections around it so it wasn’t damaged during training.
Thornspur didn’t even blink at the news that Harry had a daughter. He merely began taking notes. “Your daughter’s name?”
“When they get married, their magic combines to mark the connection and the woman transitions into the wizard’s family. That means that all family wards and such will recognize her. The physical representation of the marriage could be anything really, but it almost always has the family crest on it in some way,” Pansy finished.
“You did?” Draco gasped.
months for a baby to be born!”
“Did you get-?” Harry asked.
It was dark by the time Harry and Snape left the bank. Harry felt drained, but he was pleased with what he had accomplished for the day. As Harry followed Snape down the sidewalk, he asked, “Are you still going to visit Draco’s parents?”
***********************************
Harry nodded. “We will be keeping Violet with us,” Harry said firmly. His stomach churned as he waited for the Headmaster’s reply.
“Yes, I was crying, Hermione. Because the person I cheated on Harry with, the person I am completely head over heels in love with thought I was ashamed of us and thought I was getting back together with Harry and broke up with me! It was only Harry talking to-it was only because Harry helped explained the situation that things are starting to work out between us.” Ginny glared at Hermione during her little rant.
Harry nodded. “Thank you, Headmaster.”
Just before the silence could get awkward the door opened again and Snape walked in. He stopped at the sight of Remus standing next to Harry.
“Gin, what’s wrong? What’s happened?” Harry asked softly.
“And what about me?” Ron asked indignantly.
“You are having him come here just so that you can tell him-?”
“Oh,” Pansy looked at her ring with new appreciation. Using a muggle symbol meant that their classmates wouldn’t find out about them. At least right away. Someone was bound to eventually find out. “Well, when a witch gets engaged she wears her hair up. She uses the clip the wizard gives her when he proposed or the engagement contract was signed. The clip has a symbol of the wizard’s family on it, announcing to everyone not only that the witch is engaged, but also who she is going to be marrying.
and Pansy’s daughter,” Harry said, equally quiet. “And just in case it doesn’t…I’m going to have a will made as soon as Pansy and I are married. I’m going to write a letter, to be delivered to Draco immediately upon my death should the Dark Lord still be alive. I’m going to ask him to do a blood adoption so that even if someone performed a paternity spell it would show that Draco is her father.”
“If I die, it will mean that Voldemort has probably won. In that case, if anyone can do it, then I’m sure the Malfoys will be able to hide the fact that Violet is my daughter. I’m sure it would occur to them to suggest that she is
Draco just sat there and stared at Harry for a long time. A soft gurgle from the child in his arms finally drew his attention away from the Gryffindor pressed up against him. “Well,” he said softly to Violet, “at least your father doesn’t snore.” Draco settled himself more comfortably, slipping some pillows under Violet to support her weight so that his arm wouldn’t get tired.
“Not the way someone who has been her friend since childhood can,” Harry snapped. “Look, I’m sorry, but unless Pansy or Draco disagrees, Draco is going to be Violet’s godfather.”
Harry frowned and started to ask what they were waiting for when a goblin came up to Snape and said, “Mr. Snape? This way.”
Harry tried to give her a reassuring smile. “Sorry.” He ran a hand through his hair, trying to think of what to say to her. Finally he sighed. “Look, Ginny. I’m about to tell you something you can’t tell anyone else. Before I say anything, I need you to swear you won’t tell anyone.”
“Can I hold her, Parkinson?” Hermione asked. She and Ron had gotten much closer when they had noticed that the baby was awake, though Ron was still hanging back a bit.
Snape frowned at the note in his hand. “It seems the Headmaster wants us to come to the infirmary.”
Ginny just stared at him for a long moment. Then she blinked. “Oh! So is that the ‘illness’ that the Headmaster was talking about?”
“Cissy, Draco’s gay,” Lucius said to his wife.
Harry shook his head. “No. I’ll do it if it comes down to that. Nothing is more important to me than family.” Harry frowned. “And my muggle relatives don’t count.” He shook his head. “What does that have to do with convincing Lucius Malfoy to join our side, though?”
Remus set his hands on Harry’s shoulders. “Harry, whatever it is, you can tell me.”
“Um, he’s telling the truth, Professor,” Parkinson said in a small voice. “The baby is his, but, ah, we never…we never had sex.”
“So, when’s the wedding? I mean, if she is suffering from the Fading curse…” Ginny trailed off.
The next week past quickly for Harry.
Snape stared at the younger man for a moment and then shook his head. “Obviously the shock you have been through has affected you more than I had thought,” Snape muttered.
“He should be here just after lunch.”
“Come on, let’s get you back to Gryffindor Tower,” Harry said.
Harry grinned again. “What makes you think there’s anything more?”
Harry followed as the goblin led Snape to a private room. When the three of them were inside the room and the door shut and warded, the goblin said, “Mr. Potter?”
Even after seeing Harry with Vi over the past week Draco was still surprised at what he saw on the Gryffindor’s face when he looked at his daughter. Draco stared at Harry as Harry looked at Vi. Draco wondered if Harry even realized that he briefly turned that smile on
Petunia’s head jerked around so fast Harry half expected her to fall over. “What? Who-? How dare you!”
Harry looked at the older man in shock. First a compliment and now a joke?! “Are you feeling okay, Professor?”
“Hey, Vi. How are you and your mum doing today?” Harry asked.
The conversation was ended when Ginny started snuggling up to Harry. Harry sighed. “I can’t let her return to Gryffindor Tower alone like this. Is Pansy…?”
Harry laughed quietly. “Fine, I promise.” He shook his head.
Madam Pomfrey nearly fell into the room as Ron, Hermione and Draco Malfoy pushed past her.
Harry thought a moment. “Well…will you marry me, then?”
Draco shot a glare at Pansy’s bedroom door. “She knew she could have come to me.”
Harry, Ron and Hermione turned to see Ginny standing next to them with her hands on her hips, frowning.
When Harry was ready he knocked on the bathroom door. “Ginny? Are you ready yet?”
The Gryffindors were surprised to be allowed to see Draco Malfoy so vulnerable, but they supposed news that your best friend since childhood was dying would be hard on anyone. Ron and Hermione walked over and stood next to Harry.
Harry nodded. “And she said they have some kind of guardianship over her and the only way she can be free of them is to get married. So…” Harry shrugged uncomfortably. “It was the only thing she wanted and I could give her that. She gave me Violet and…I figure I could do that for her.”
Harry and Severus arrived in Little Whinging at the edge of a park between some tall shrubs and the side of a building. Severus put the glove into his pocket and stepped out into the park. Harry followed.
Harry grinned at the look of shock that crossed Snape’s face and he waited for the man to ask.
Harry rolled his eyes. “I have plenty of experience in not telling the Headmaster things. Whatever you tell me, he won’t learn from me.”
Harry gave her a small smile. “A couple of reasons I guess. It made me feel a little less guilty. I mean, I cared for you, but I wasn’t in love with you and you didn’t deserve me leading you on. It didn’t take me long to figure out we weren’t going to work out, Ginny. I probably knew even before we ever got together. Seeing you with someone else, someone you really love…it freed me to break up with you. I don’t think I was the only one relieved when it was over either.”
“Harry, go get your things from your room,” Snape said.
“If you can’t be quite, you won’t be allowed back in,” Harry said fiercely. The argument ended immediately. “Now, Pansy and I have not yet had a chance to talk about who we are going to name Violet’s godfather or godmother. I’m not sure about Pansy, but it is something I’ve thought about.” Harry took a deep breath. “And I think there’s really only one choice. I’m fairly sure Pansy will agree with me.”
“I’m engaged to
Harry shrugged and turned back to his textbook. Several minutes passed, silent except for Draco’s sighs. Violet fell asleep and Harry carefully stood and put her in her bassinet set to one side of the living room. When he returned to the coffee table, he sat beside Draco rather than across from him.
“Oh my god!” Hermione said again. She just looked at Harry, stunned.
Ginny gave him a sad smile. “No. I was cheating on you from the first. I have no right to be upset about something like that.”
“Promise me, Po-Harry. Promise me, Harry,” Pansy said, turning to him. “Promise me you’ll take care of Vi. Promise me you’ll keep her safe and love her. You have to kill that bastard and you have to survive this stupid war so you can take care of our daughter.”
a father. Violet is my daughter and
Dumbledore nodded. “Of course,” he said solemnly. “I had been trying to think of what to do while the two of you are in class. The fewer people that know about this the better. Obviously, other students or any of the professors are not an option as they would be missed. Madam Pomfrey needs to be available to the students, so she would also not be available.”
Draco Malfoy was lying on the sofa, rumpled and fast asleep, with Harry’s sleeping little girl lying on his chest. Harry’s breath caught at the sight of Draco’s messy hair, his missing outer robes and his bare feet. Harry stared for a moment as he took in the fact that Draco wasn’t even wearing socks then he jerked his eyes up to Draco’s face. The blond’s face was so relaxed in sleep. And the way he held little Vi against his chest…!
Harry shrugged again. “Just tell my aunt that by signing the papers I never have to come back to her house and you won’t even have to tell her what she is signing. And the protections would have only worked for part of the summer anyway so it’s not like I didn’t already have to start thinking of where to go when the wards stopped working. I don’t see the problem.”
“Right. Thanks for everything,” Harry said.
“And where are Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger?” Snape asked.
********************************
“Yeah, but my parents have this guardianship thing. A lot of old wizard families use it for daughters. I’m under their ‘protection’ until I turn twenty-three or until I marry. It had to do with muggles hunting witches or something centuries ago,” Pansy said.
Draco kept his face expressionless as he watched Harry take Violet. His heart clenched as he saw the awe and love on the Gryffindor’s face. Harry’s touch was reverent as he stroked a finger down the little girl’s cheek.
“That would be more believable if you had not gotten her pregnant, Potter,” Snape said.
Harry nodded and smiled brightly. “Violet Delphine Potter was a week old yesterday.”
The Headmaster looked around the room solemnly. “We are gathered here for a very special occasion. Today, Miss Pansy Parkinson will be marrying Mr. Harry Potter. They have chosen to use muggle traditions to celebrate their union and in respect to that, this ceremony will be held accordingly.”
“Well, as I told Miss Parkinson,” Dumbledore said solemnly, “there is one simple way to tell. If you don’t mind, Harry?” He motioned for Harry to stand beside the bed.
“Perfect. Do you think you could run up and grab it and meet me out in the corridor without anyone seeing it?” Harry asked.
“No, I’m not seeing anyone. And yes, I am very serious. I’m sure between the Headmaster and Snape and us we can do it quietly,” Harry replied.
Harry sighed and sat down beside Remus. If there was one person he could trust with this knowledge it was Remy. He was too worried about Ron or Hermione accidentally telling someone so he let them believe he and Pansy had been lovers. Draco was Pansy’s business.
Soon Draco was blinking sleepily, lulled by Harry’s deep even breathing. Slowly, his eyes slid closed and he drifted off as well.
“Yes.” Harry hesitated for a moment and then shrugged. “Given her parents, Vi could very well end up being sorted into Slytherin. I mean, not only is Pansy in Slytherin, but Slytherin was the Sorting Hat’s first choice for me. I’ve noticed that Slytherins with Slytherin parents seem to…I don’t know, have an easier time I guess. In being a Slytherin I mean.
“Ah, of course, my boy,” Dumbledore said, startled to suddenly be included in the conversation.
“Miss Parkinson was at first extremely reluctant to tell us the name of the child’s father. However, when she learned…certain facts she named Harry Potter as the child’s father,” Dumbledore said.
Harry glared over his shoulder at his best friend. “Ron, whether you like it or not, Draco is going to be in
“No offense, Hermione,” Harry said, “but I couldn’t name you Vi’s godmother. Like me, you were raised by muggles and there are plenty of things you and I just won’t be able to teach her. No matter how much you could get from books, there are some things we just won’t know we didn’t know.”
“I’ve never heard about that and I’ve read up on the ceremony quite a bit,” Hermione said suspiciously.
They seemed to have nothing to say to that. After a short pause, Hermione turned to Ginny. “But how could you have forgiven him enough to be his best woman when he was marrying the girl he cheated on you with?”
“Generally, when a wizard comes in to make a will we start with the items they feel to be of the most importance and any special instructions. Later, I will fit everything into the appropriate format and then go over everything with you,” Thornspur said. “Everything is, of course, completely confidential.”
“But-but,” Pansy said.
“And why ever would he do that?” Draco sneered. “It’s not like you could take care of Vi if anything happened-”
Harry sighed and nodded. “And several things actually. If I’m still alive, my friends will be around my daughter because they will be around me. By making Draco Violet’s godfather he knows he will always have a place in her life. Also, I thought that knowing that might make it easier for him to switch sides. I thought it would make it clear to him that I was serious in my offer of welcoming him on my side in this war.”
When Draco glared at him, Harry said, “The person Ginny was seeing broke up with her. Apparently, rumors started that Ginny and I were getting back together and when she came to the wedding people thought the two of us had gone off somewhere to ‘make-up.’ Since Ginny promised not to tell anyone about the wedding she couldn’t say where she had really been and since I was the only one who knew she was seeing…who she was seeing, she came to talk to me.”
“Because she had your baby. Harry, you are both only going to be miserable if you marry without loving each other,” Ginny said.
Harry gaped as Pansy Parkinson was revealed. She looked awful. She was sweaty and obviously exhausted. She was also…holding a baby.
The two pureblood boys looked at her in confusion.
Pansy and Draco glared at each other for a moment before Pansy turned to Violet’s bed. “That would actually be great, Harry.” Pansy picked Violet up and handed her to Harry.
The bathroom door opened. Harry sighed in relief before he caught sight of Ginny and he quickly slapped a hand over his eyes. “Ginny, you were supposed to finish dressing before you came out!”
Obviously Snape had been having similar thoughts. “And why is Potter here? I would think this is a matter that would be best handled privately for the time being.”
Harry looked at the bed guiltily as Parkinson flinched and the baby gave a small cry.
“What, are you going to make me promise?” Harry asked, teasing, remembering the promises she had exacted from him and Draco the night before.
Harry swore under his breath as he quickly dodged a man that reminded him of his Uncle Vernon-big, beefy and loud. Harry was using his invisibility cloak to get to Gringotts unnoticed. Unfortunately, the problem with people not noticing him was that he had to make sure no one stepped on him or ran into him.
Hermione gasped. “Oh my god! Pansy, did Harry give you that ring?!”
Harry didn’t even flinch at the hard tone she used. “I agree. I would never let people like that near my daughter,” he whispered.
“Come on, Hermione,” Ron said excited, “I’m Harry’s best mate! He’s gonna ask me. Right, Harry?”
“Did you break up with her so you could be with Parkinson?” Ron asked, getting louder.
“Now, you are certain that this means that boy will no longer have to come back here?” Vernon asked.
Apparently, the person at the door took that as permission to enter. The door swung open and Draco came in. “Potter, are you ready yet?” Draco stopped as he caught sight of Ginny, half dressed. “What the hell is going on in here?” he asked coldly.
Neville rushed to open the windows. He had just opened the last one when the other boys came into the room.
Snape was gone several minutes. Harry started wandering around looking at things. He was trying to read the faded title of a book on the corner of Snape’s desk when he heard the door open. He looked up and just stared.
Snape sat down across from Harry as usual. He looked at the younger man and lifted an eyebrow. “I would never have expected you to accept this situation so easily, Potter. Certainly, I never expected to return to have the Headmaster ask me to help plan a wedding between you and Miss Parkinson.”
Draco sighed in defeat. “I promise, Pans.”
“I’m sorry, Harry,” Pansy said quietly.
Pansy didn’t answer. She looked down at her daughter and lifted her free hand to push her hair behind her ear.
Remus grinned. “Do either of you know how to change diapers?”
before. There was still a slightly dreamy quality to her gaze and voice, but for once she seemed more in the real world (for lack of a better description) than in that world only she could see. Harry had thought long and hard about what to tell Luna when he found her. He had no doubt that she could keep a secret or three, but he really didn’t want to go around telling
“Ron, keep your voice down!” Harry said, “And it’s not-”
Ginny blinked at the non sequitur. “Um, yes. After the Yule Ball, Mum made sure I brought one with me to school.”
“And have you thought of what would happen if you didn’t manage to survive this war?” Severus asked quietly.
Harry frowned. “Are you seeing someone? I just assumed you weren’t.”
A thoughtful look came to Harry’s face. “Actually, you’re probably more powerful. They are decades older than you and have had much, much more time to study various aspects of magic. Not to mention they never spent the time on Potions that you have…” Harry trailed off.
Pansy eyed the werewolf for a moment and then nodded. “This is Violet Delphine Potter.”
Parkinson (
Harry wearily walked up the stairs to Gryffindor Tower. He was feeling emotionally drained after the shock of finding out about Violet and then dealing with the anger and disgust he felt over what Pansy had done.
Remus walked over and leaned down to look at the little girl. “She’s as adorable as Harry said.” He noticed that Pansy and Draco both seemed tense, but he made no move to touch the baby. He was a pureblood and familiar with the superstition. He turned to Draco. “Harry was telling me you are going to be her godfather. Congratulations.”
“I thought my baby deserved to be with her father,” Pansy said, drawing everyone’s attention to the bundle in her arms.
Harry’s brows rose. “Well, yeah.”
“We were studying together. She just went up to get a book. You can talk to her when she comes back down.”
Snape ignored Harry and led the way to the infirmary. It did not escape Harry’s notice that he took a route that insured they would remain unseen.
Severus narrowed his eyes at the younger man. “There is something else.”
Harry snorted in amusement. “It was the Sorting Hat’s first choice for me.” Harry grinned at the brief bug-eyed expression of shock that crossed the Potions Master’s face before he put his mask back into place.
Harry stared for a long time, not really any thoughts in his head, just the feeling of almost awe at the beauty of the sight before him. Harry suddenly flushed with embarrassment at being caught staring as Draco’s eyes fluttered open and a slight frown came to the blond’s face.
Harry took a deep breath. Hermione was right about one thing. He might as well get this over with now. “Ginny, could we talk?”
Draco sneered at him. “I’m ‘welcome,’ Potter?”
Dumbledore nodded to let Madam Pomfrey know it was okay. When she left, he shut the door behind the three stunned students and replaced the wards.
Harry frowned and thought for a moment. “Severus Snape.” Harry saw Snape raise an eyebrow at that. Harry shrugged. “You’re probably the only person I could trust to make sure my wishes are followed. You aren’t prejudiced against Slytherins so I know you won’t try to find a way around what I want. I suppose I could have named Remy, but it would be too easy for someone to use the prejudices against werewolves to have him considered inappropriate or something.” Harry shrugged. “Besides, you are stubborn enough that you won’t let anyone talk you out of following my wishes.”
“Is Pansy still sleeping?” Harry asked, looking up at Draco.
as your daughter’s godfather?!” His face started turning red and his hands curled into fists.
Pansy was teary as she took a shaky breath and began her vows. “I have no regrets either, Harry. I know that-I know that isn’t fair of me, but like you I know our daughter for the treasure she is. I owe you more than I can ever repay, Harry.” Pansy took inhaled deeply and held her head up proudly. “I promise, Harry, to give you my full and unwavering support. I promise to remain completely faithful to you. I promise to love our daughter with all my heart and to always choose what I feel is best for her.”
Harry stepped into the Gryffindor common room and was grateful for the good weather that had most of the students outside. He saw Hermione and Ron sitting on a sofa and hurried over.
“Severus, you need to go to the Parkinson’s house and get that book. I also need you to start looking into a way to prevent something like this from happening again,” Dumbledore said.
“Pansy,” Harry said, “given our situation, it is difficult to find vows that suit us. I can only speak honestly. I told you I had no regrets and I meant it. You have given me a beautiful daughter and I appreciate her for the priceless treasure that she is. No words can adequately describe how grateful I am for her. The best I can do is to promise to protect you and to take care of you for whatever time we have left and to always love and care for our daughter.” Harry took a deep breath and looked at Pansy steadily. “And that I promise, Pansy.”
Harry shrugged. “He’s going to be my daughter’s godfather.”
Back in Snape’s office, Harry stumbled and would have fallen on his face if Snape hadn’t reached out and grabbed his arm.
Harry looked at her a moment and then turned to the Headmaster. “Headmaster? Can I have a lemon drop?”
“Yes. Sunday morning you will come to my office at ten to discuss the other matter,” Snape said.
“Asleep,” Draco said. He face was emotionless as he said, “Madam Pomfrey said she could expect to have periods of lethargy and need a lot of rest.”
Snape shook his head. “I only joined the Dark Lord to provide information about his plans. However, what even Albus doesn’t know…” Snape trailed off and gave Harry a significant look.
**************************************
“I present to you, Mr. and Mrs. Potter,” Dumbledore said.
“You know I never wanted to support that madman. Can you really give your loyalty to a man who would murder my baby?”
Harry sat down on the bed next to Pansy and put an arm around her shoulders. “I know just what you mean,” he whispered. “I was raised by muggle relatives who hate magic.”
“The only thing I really want now is to be free of my parents. I guess I’ll get that wish in a few months, though,” Pansy said.
It was almost a half hour later when Pansy returned to the living room to get her camera. Once more she was struck by the scene she discovered. In her and Vi’s absence, the two men had somehow managed to stretch out on the sofa together.
“There you are, Harry!” Hermione said. “You never came back last night! I was so worried about you!”
The Headmaster had made an announcement about Pansy’s illness and Harry’s attack and told the other students that they would both be getting private rooms. There was very little complaining since everyone knew that the situations must be extremely serious for the Headmaster to take that action.
Draco turned a little green. “Pansy-”
“So what can you two tell me about this ceremony to name a child’s godparent?” Harry asked. “I was raised by muggles so I’ve never heard of it before.”
Ginny shook her head and took a deep breath. “I’m sorry, Harry.”
“I just…you’re a really powerful wizard, you know? Everyone at school knows that you and Draco are the most powerful wizards in the school,” Pansy said.
Harry took both of Pansy’s hands in one of his and reached out towards Ginny. She quickly opened the box and held it out to Harry. Harry reached in and pulled out a band of gold. It was delicate and feminine and had pansies etched around the band. He slipped the ring onto Pansy’s left ring finger.
An annoyed look came to Harry’s face. “Well, I was trying to tell them, but they wouldn’t listen to anything I had to say until I had talked to you. When I kept trying to tell them, they walked away.”
Narcissa frowned even more fiercely. Before she could say anything, Lucius continued.
“Actually,” Snape said, “it is probably what you said just now that will convince Lucius.”
“More likely she was telling you to hurry up,
“But you’re seventeen, right?” Harry asked in confusion. “I thought wizards and witches were considered adults at seventeen.”
“What is going on in here?” Madam Pomfrey asked, keeping her voice low. She took in the scene in one glance. Harry was sitting on the bed with Pansy and Draco while Ron and Hermione stood at the end of the bed glaring at their friend. “That’s it! Miss Granger, Mr. Weasley, you will not be allowed in this room again! You will have to wait until I’ve released Miss Parkinson and her child to see the child again.”
********************************
“Yeah,” Harry said.
“Of course. After that surprise Yule Ball in fourth year I don’t know any girl that hasn’t made sure to bring at least one formal gown with her to school.”
Pansy continued. “Well, apparently my parents decided if I wasn’t not going to be a good little piece of property,” she said bitterly, “then I was of no use to them.”
Ginny’s eyes widened. “Honestly! What is wrong with you two! And if I were still angry with Harry I hardly would have gone to his wedding and been his best woman!”
Harry looked at her for a moment. “Um, there’s…one more thing.”
“Pansy-” Draco said, torn.
“You don’t love Pansy either.” It was a statement, not a question. “She told me you only married her because you got her pregnant.”
“Ah,” Dumbledore said. “Perhaps you could explain, Miss Parkinson?”
“Potter?” Harry asked. “You don’t want both our-?”
“How about a flower name? Your name and my mum’s name are both names of flowers,” Harry said.
After seeing Snape’s memories, in their next Occlumency lesson Harry let Snape see some of his worst memories of Dudley and other…unpleasant memories from living at Privet Drive. Anything less and Harry knew the man would only have sneered at his apology. Afterwards Snape looked at him for a long time without saying anything. In the end, they never did say anything explicit about the truce that formed between them.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What about Remus? I heard that you were going to ask him back as the DADA professor next year. Are there any suites with three bedrooms? It’s only a few months until the end of term. I’m sure he could stay with us and not be noticed during that time,” Harry said.
“Harry?” Pansy asked once they were alone.
“Harry, why would you name
“What? Why?” Harry asked.
“Oh, so it’s like a graduation gift?” Harry asked with a frown. “What happens if I die before I gain access to the vault?”
Harry rolled his eyes. “First of all, I’m seventeen. Any time I had sex would have been memorable for the simple fact that is was happening at all. Second, I definitely would have remembered if I had been with Parkinson. Not only does she hate me, but I happen to be gay.”
Snape narrowed his eyes at Harry and frowned. “You are lying.”
The next week was more of the same. Pansy watched Violet while Draco and Harry had class and took a nap when they arrived after their classes. After her nap she usually went to the library to work on homework and sometimes talk with the other Slytherin girls while Harry and Draco watched Vi. She usually returned to find Harry and Draco working on homework together or playing with Vi.
Draco closed his eyes and let that voice sooth him. If he could talk, then he really was okay.
“How can you be so nice to me?”
“I want to be with him. I do. But I can’t handle this. Someone else has touched him. Someone else has felt his body against theirs. I’ve dreamed about being with him for so long. I wanted us to be each others first.”
“Agreed.”
The school nurse smiled softly and put her hand over Draco’s. “If you didn’t want to end up here, you wouldn’t have gone to the bathroom closest to the hospital wing. I appreciate that you heeded the advice I gave you last time this happened and did so.”
Draco blinked and tried to focus. His mind was fogged and he couldn’t quite concentrate. “I don’t know. It doesn’t really feel like a dream. But it has to be. This couldn’t actually be happening to me.”
Draco was frustrated. He was beyond frustrated. He raked his long fingers through his pale blonde hair as he passed the fire place in the Slytherin common room again. He had been pacing the room for over an hour now and still couldn’t think of a solution to his problems.
“Yes.” He relaxed back into Harry’s arms, his head back on his shoulder, and let his voice sooth him.
“Why would I be angry? I said I love you, and I mean it. If all I wanted from you was sex, I wouldn’t be in love with you. I’ll wait until you’re ready.”
Draco closed his eyes and turned his head away from Dumbledore. “I just want to be left alone.”
“Come over here. Let me take a look at you.”
“He hates me. And I don’t even really know why. I try to be nice to everyone. No one understands how much it hurts, that people hate me when I have done nothing to deserve it. Malfoy especially. I can think of no other reason for his spite other then the fact that I am friends with Ron and Hermione. His father hates Ron’s father and thus Malfoy hates Ron and all his siblings. Hermione is muggle born so of course he hates her. It could be that I’m the one that made Voldemort disappear. According to Ron, most of those that had been followers of Voldemort had been Slytherin’s. I just don’t know.”
“It is what it is. I can’t change my family anymore then the muggle borns can change theirs.”
“That is what you say to him. But you say it in a way that lets him know how happy you are to finally be with him. Don’t let him feel that it is his fault that you were with those other boys. Because he is blaming himself.”
“What you feel?”
Draco swallowed hard and shifted, trying to relieve the ache in his groin caused by his pants cutting into him. “We can’t do this here.”
“Why did you do that, Harry?” As much as he hated to do it, Draco pulled back, letting the hands fall away from his face.
“I can’t let it go. He says that he loves me, that he has been attracted to me since he first saw me, just as I was with him. How could he say he has loved me when he has let someone else touch him during that time?”
“I understand. But loneliness isn’t a very good reason to be intimate with someone, Harry. It may feel good, and ease the loneliness for a time. But afterwards, it will always leave you feeling empty.”
“You dying wouldn’t help me. It would only make what I feel that much worse.”
“He is just fine, Draco.”
“Because I have no reason to be otherwise. Now are you going to keep talking?”
“Don’t.”
Now he was frustrated. All he wanted to do was to run to him. To make sure he was okay. To make sure he wasn’t badly injured. ……To hold him. That was what he truly wanted. To hold him and make sure he was really still alive. Watching him come so close to death had shaken him badly.
Draco clawed at the bandage covering the cuts on his arm. He peeled it off and dug his thumb into one of the cuts. When he felt the warm flow of blood trickle down his arm, he shivered from the physical pain and closed his eyes again.
Harry shook his head and set his tea down. “I care because you’re a person. If you’re sick, we should call Professor Dumbledore back and have this wait until you feel better. I have been wanting to talk to you, but it can wait if you aren’t feeling well.”
“Then you have two choices.” Harry kissed Draco’s ear and brushed his lips down the other boy’s neck.
Draco moaned softly as he sped up is strokes. His fantasies were always vivid. The ones he enjoyed most were the ones where he was the one on his back, his legs wrapped around his wrist. The thought of his body moving against his drove him mad with desire.
The last thing Draco heard before he let go of the light was his footsteps leaving the room.
Harry shook his head. “Not straight out. Just certain things he said during our conversation. The way he would look at me for part of what he said and avoid looking into my eyes for another. He said in there that there is one person in particular who he hates hurting. I just figured it was me with other things he had said.”
As the shirt was tossed to the floor, Harry bent his head and started to kiss his way down Draco’s body. He was even thinner then he had though. But he didn’t care. He was finally touching him. He finally had the love of his life under him. Harry licked one of Draco’s nipples and he moaned loudly. Harry felt his body respond to the sounds Draco was making. He was getting hard and he could feel Draco’s body responding the same way under his.
Dumbledore looked up at the portrait that spoke to him and nodded as he stood from his chair. “Thank you.” He turned to Harry, who had also stood at the portraits words. “You should go to bed Harry. Come back tomorrow after lunch. I should have him ready to speak to you by then.” Dumbledore walked around the desk and laid his hands on Harry’s shoulders. “Go to bed. Get some sleep. Tomorrow I want you to think carefully about how to tell Draco everything you have just told me. I will make sure he is ready to listen to you.”
“Is that a problem?” He leaned forward to kiss Draco again but he pulled away sharply. Harry watched as pain and disbelief filled his eyes and overflowed as tears. “Oh, Draco. I’m so sorry. If I had known how you really feel about me I would have done things differently. Can you honestly tell me you didn’t expect that I had been with someone? What about you? I’ve seen some of the people who hang on you like you’re their god.”
“I do. But you go first. Ask what you want to know.”
“You haven’t found a way to hurt yourself again, have you?”
Draco could feel his brain turning fuzzy again. He had reopened all four of the cuts on his arm and could feel the pool of blood seeping around the side of his body. He was hoping he would bleed to death before he left and Madam Pomfrey came to check on him. He hated himself more then he ever had at that moment. He had been causing him pain with the things he did.
Snape approached Dumbledore and bent to speak into his ear. “If this doesn’t stop, Albus, we will need to contact his father.”
“Because you need to hear it from him. And he needs to explain it to you in his own words.”
“You’re bleeding.”
“I don’t much care right now.”
Draco flinched. “I stole it.”
Draco sighed in relief and leaned against Harry again. “Will you still meet with me alone a couple times a week?”
“I didn’t know it would matter so much. I honestly believed that he had been with someone else, too. Why wouldn’t he have? He’s beautiful, he’s popular, he has people that follow him around like he is god.”
“Good, good.” Dumbledore turned to Draco. “Where did you get the blade this time?”
“How are you feeling, Draco?”
“It’s not alright. It’s not alright. Nothing will even be alright again.” He tried to pull away but the man held him tightly and refused to let him go.
“I don’t remember.”
But this. This was worse. He had heard the stories about past Tri-Wizard contestants being seriously injured or even killed. But that was before Dumbledore was headmaster. He thought that with such a powerful man as headmaster of Hogwart’s, that he would be safe. But he wasn’t. That day, just that morning, he had sat in the stands, cheering along with his friends as they watched the three other contestants get past the dragons. And then it was his turn.
For over three years he had pretended to hate him. He had been awful to him, rude, and just plain mean. It was how he should feel. How his father had told him to feel after learning that he was at Hogwart’s at the same time as Draco, but not in Slytherin. It was how his friends felt, especially the ones who had parents, like his, who were former Death Eaters.
“Think about it from his eye, Draco. He was attracted to you, had feelings for you. But how have you acted towards him? He had no way of knowing that what he felt for you was returned. So he sought feeling with someone else. If he cared for whoever it was he was with, he wouldn’t have told you he loves you.”
Harry turned him around and took his face in his hands. “Does this feel like a dream?” He pressed his lips to the other boys again and kissed him passionately. This wasn’t the almost chaste touching of lips that he had given him before. This was passionate, and it made Draco’s knees go weak. Harry put his arms around him and held him close, their bodies pressed tightly together. He pulled away slowly and looked down into cloudy blue eyes. “Does it?”
“I’ve tried. He just insults me and walks away.”
“You have a choice, Draco. You can say those things to us, people who know you don’t mean them, know how you feel about saying them, and who know you are saying them because if you don’t something awful will happen to you. Or you can stop, and let those awful things happen.”
“I don’t expect you to hide anything from them. But I don’t want to say those things anymore, Harry.”
“I don’t either. It is what my father expects of me.”
“I want to go back to my own room.”
“Yes. He is indeed in love with you. If it makes you uncomfortable, you shouldn’t meet with him more then the once a week I asked for.”
“You’re all done. The salves I put on you should heal the burns and the cuts overnight and heal up some of the bruising. Shower in the morning to wash it off. You can go now.”
“I don’t want to see him.”
Draco’s jumped and he sloshed tea over his hand. Sighing, he set the cup down and rose to pace the room. “I don’t hate you.”
“He cut himself deeply. He would have bled to death had Madam Pomfrey not discovered him in the nearby bathroom. She bandaged him up because Draco likes to wear the proof of his pain. Later that night, when you went into the hospital to have your wounds treated, he heard the things you said to Madam Pomfrey. It upset him greatly. He tore off his bandages and reopened the wounds with his fingers. By the time you left and Madam Pomfrey checked on him, he had almost bled to death again.”
“I’ve done nothing but be mean to him. If I tried to explain, I doubt he would even listen. I can’t tell him that I love him.”
The girl nodded and gave his hand a squeeze. “I know. But you aren’t going to get out of here anytime soon.”
“Not really. He always has his goons somewhere around him.”
“It was the right decision to not lie to him. But you should have found a more gentle way to tell him.”
“You must trust him to be able to take care of himself, Draco. He is a smart, strong boy. You cannot keep doing this to yourself.” She brushed his hair away from his face and pressed her hand to his forehead. “You lost a great deal of blood today. I gave you a potion to replenish your blood supply. If I had not thought to check the bathroom on my way back from dinner, it is likely you would have bled to death. I checked it because I had hoped you would go there if you needed to cut yourself again. I knew today would have been especially hard on you.”
Harry turned back and looked down the hall towards the hospital. He felt an overwhelming sadness for what had been going on with Draco. He only hoped that he could do something to ease his pain.
Draco laughed softly. “Now I know I’m dreaming.”
Draco woke feeling hot. His chest felt heavy. His arm was burning.
“Why?”
“You don’t know my family. We’re pure blood. My father, my mother, my relatives. They all believe that unless you are pure blood you don’t have a right to be called a witch or wizard or to be taught to use magic. If I were to express how I really feel, my father would disown me. My entire family would disown me.”
“Hey, Draco. Where you going?” Goyle jogged up along Draco’s right and Crabbe on his left. They both watched him expectantly as he made his way up the path.
Harry smiled and walked over to the other boy. He wrapped his arms around Draco and set his chin on his shoulder. “I’m sorry. I should have asked first. We can wait. If that is what you want.”
“Albus. The boy is stirring. I believe he is having a nightmare.”
“You will not know until you hear it. But you need to hear it, Draco. Do not let the love you share for each other be destroyed because of something that happened in the past.”
“Those are the rules. Dumbledore explained them to you. All you can do is prepare as thoroughly as you can and hope for the best.”
“Your friends or mine, someone else is usually around and the things we need to say are best said in private.”
“They don’t deserve to be called your family if they wouldn’t support you despite you having different beliefs.”
Pulling the straight razor from his pocket, he unfolded the long, sharp blade and watched the sunlight filtering through a nearby window wink off of the silver. Setting the blade on his knees, he rolled back his left sleeve. He felt a tear slide down his cheek as he picked the blade up again.
“Thanks, Madam Pomfrey. And thanks for the talk.” There was a rustling again as he pulled his shirt back on and stood from the bed.
“But you did very well. And you have only minor injuries. All four of you were injured, some worse then others.”
“Okay.” Harry turned on the couch and put his back to the arm. He picked his tea up off the table along with a scone and settled back so he could face Draco. “What was the thing you wanted to talk to me about?”
“The truth is the truth. It will hurt him, yes. But you need to make him see that it doesn’t mean you don’t want him, or that you love him any less.”
Harry moved to sit on the foot of Draco’s bed. The blonde was still staring at the ceiling. “I can leave, Professor, if you think its best.”
“I don’t know. Would it be okay to see him again on Monday evening? Then I could talk to him about how often we should meet. I don’t want to make the decision without consulting him.”
“I understand. I truly do.”
Draco swallowed hard when Madam Pomfrey moved out of the way and he got a look at his back. He was bruised, painfully so. He had cuts and scrapes running the length of his back. But it was the burn that spread over his shoulder blades that had the tears spilling from his eyes again. He closed the curtain and laid back down. He couldn’t stand to see him hurt.
“Shut up, Malfoy. The hospital wing is close by. I doubt anyone will be in the halls between here and there and you look like you’re about to pass out.” Harry stood and put an arm around Draco. He pulled him to his feet where the boy swayed a bit before settling into a standing position.
“Nothing he can say will make me feel better about the fact that he has been with someone else. Nothing could make that better, Dumbledore.” Draco stopped pacing and turned angry eyes to the man sitting before him. “I don’t want to hear it. Not now. Not ever.” He turned back to the windows and looked down towards the ground, so far away. “I want to jump out of this window and just let it all end.”
He grinned and ran his hands down the thin line of Draco’s body until they rose over the swell of his ass. “How about getting you naked?”
Draco took a deep breath, keeping his back straight as he continued to walk. He didn’t stop until he reached the sitting room in the castle. After closing the door he moved across the room and dropped onto the couch. He let his head fall into his hands and let go of the reins he kept on his emotions.
“As well as can be expected. Have you thought of how to talk to him?”
Harry shivered at the unexpected touch. Draco had never touched him this much before. Ever since that evening in Dumbledore’s sitting room, he had been careful about how much he touched the other boy.
“I know. Talk to me. Tell me what happened.”
“It’s too late for that.”
“Okay. You can stop. I know nothing about muggles. I would never be able to live and work with them.”
Harry smiled and ran his lips over Draco’s forehead. “Because I can think of something better to do.”
“Are you my sitter now, Potter?”
“I love him.”
But it wasn’t how he felt. Since the first time he had laid eyes on the dark haired boy, while they stood together and were fitted for their school robes, before he even knew who he was, Draco had felt a pull towards him. Something he had never felt for anyone else before or since.
“Indeed. Did he tell you?”
“Maybe you could just, not say them as often. Since I know the truth, you could just pick on me.”
“Draco. What did you do to yourself?” She reached out for him and he drew back sharply.
“The hostility could have a negative effect on younger students of the school. I do not tolerate negative attitudes among the students. You are all young witches and wizards who have come here to learn. Fighting amongst each other is not uncommon, but what the two of you seem to have going is not as simple as a petty squabble. There seems to be a deep hostility between you. I am hoping that tonight the two of you could have a conversation with one another and try to find some common ground.”
“How? Because I had sex with a couple girls? I have never loved anyone but you. I have never let another guy touch me. I barely even let those girls touch me because I didn’t like their hands on me. Sex isn’t all that I want, Draco. I want everything that comes with being in a relationship with someone you are in love with. I want the time spent just being together. I want to be able to go to you when I’m stressed and be able to hold you and know that everything will be okay because I have you. Please,” Harry raised Draco’s hands to his face and pressed his lips against them. “Please don’t tell me you don’t want me anymore because I’m not a virgin. If I could go back I would change what I did. But I can’t.”
“Easy, Draco.” She put her hands on his shoulders and eased him onto his back again. She gestured to the side of the bed. “I put you in the back bed and put a privacy screen up for you. When he comes in, he will not see you.” She traced a hand gently over Draco’s face and brushed away his tears. “Just relax. It might help you to be able to hear his voice.”
Draco shivered as he drew the blade a fourth time.
Draco shook his head. “Never mind.”
“What did you want to talk about?” Draco took a sip of his tea and had a dim thought that it tasted lovely before it too was lost in the haze of his mind.
“I did. She came to me with concerns.” Dumbledore set his empty cup onto the tray and stood. “There is plenty of tea and snacks here for you. I would like the two of you to spend a minimum of an hour together. Talk things over. Talk about random topics. Sit and try to ignore each other. I don’t care what you do. But I am going to put a spell on the door that will not allow it to be opened for an hour. The two of you will meet me here once a week to spend an hour in each others company until I am satisfied with the results of the sessions.”
Harry’s hands slid up to cup Draco’s face as he slowly pulled away. “Feel better?”
Harry licked his way down Draco’s stomach and he suddenly couldn’t do it anymore. “Stop.” Draco pushed at Harry’s shoulders, trying to make him stop. “Harry, please, stop.”
“Why would the things you say to one bother you more then the things you say to everyone else?”
He hated feeling powerless to protect him.
“I don’t want to talk about it.”
Draco had felt his body tense, his stomach knot, his mind fog as the fear and worry brought him to the point of passing out. He watched as he walked into the arena. He watched as the dragon spit fire at him. He watched as the dragon almost crushed him, bit him, clawed him, and roasted him. His heart had been beating so fast and so hard that he had been clutching his chest from the pain. And all the while his friends had been cheering the dragon on.
“Neither do I, Draco.” Harry’s voice was quiet as he spoke. He turned and sat in the big chair and let his head drop into his hands. “They were a mistake. I went through a very difficult time last year. I thought I needed something that they could give me. But I didn’t want them. I was searching for something. I realize now that what I was doing was trying to force myself to stop feeling what I feel for you. I never could have imagined that you would feel for me what I felt for you. I dreamed about it, of course. I still do. All the time. I dream about what it would be like to feel your body against mine.” Harry looked up again to see Draco had wrapped his arms around himself. “They didn’t mean anything. I don’t like girls that way.”
“Believe it or not, Draco, but I know how you feel. It was the same way for me and my first lover. He was experienced, but I had saved myself until I found someone special. And it bothered me to at first, when he told me. But in the end, I let that go. And we were together for a long time.”
Draco sneered. “I hate being in the hospital.”
“I need you to go to him.” When the girl gave him a questioning look, he gave her a pleading one. “Please. He will hurt himself, Hermione.”
“Not all people really. One in particular.”
“All because of me?”
Hermione slipped into the sitting room and closed the door behind her before anyone could see her. But the corridor was currently empty so she wasn’t over worried about it. She turned to look around the room and was surprised to find it empty. A flash of worry went through her. With what Harry had told her and Ron, Draco was likely to be off somewhere hurting himself if he wasn’t in this room waiting for him.
“Harry is fine. He wasn’t hurt.” She took his arm and pulled him to his feet.
Draco shivered and clung to the front of Dumbledore’s robes. “Please. Just let me die.”
Draco laughed softly and pulled back enough to wipe his face. “I was so scared. You took so long to come back up.” He looked down at his hands. “I cut up my hands with my nails. I didn’t even realize I did it until Hermione pointed it out.” He sighed and laid his head against Harry’s shoulders. “Thank you for sending her. She helped calm me down. I would have gone mad by now if you hadn’t.”
“What is this?”
Draco hadn’t moved, meaning he didn't hear her or he didn’t care enough to move.
He can’t push down his unshakeable feeling that these two women together will be the undoing of them all.
“Yeah, ‘Mione, where are we?”
And Pansy smiles.
It’s Friday when Ron’s wand doesn't buzz.
“Have you tried just following him around? A few well cast Notice-Me-Nots and disillusionment charms would work, no?” Charlie asks.
“Harry. Why are you still denying it? Pansy talked to Draco. We know about your relationship. We know that you and Draco have been dating for 3 years, that every morning you floo over to his flat and spend the morning with him. We know that you make him breakfast before going to work- come on, Harry. We know everything.”
The sofa is gone, the pictures on the wall have been taken down, and every trace of Harry has been removed. The only things that remain are the Black Family Artifacts on the mantel and the dark green rug that’s collected so much dust it looks brown. Hermione suspects that everything not owned by Harry himself(or Sirius) has been left in the house.
“Oh!” Pansy says, shooting out of her chair and beginning to pace across the room. “Set up a Ministry event. A gala, a fundraiser, whatever. Make sure all departments have to attend, including Potter. What does he do here, again?”
So Hermione stands up, and offers the woman her hand. “We’ll help.”
But after two years of Draco’s mysterious happiness, Pansy can't stop the flow of nervousness, the flow of fear that courses through her.
The bed is a mess of sheets and pillows. Hermione knows that when Harry does sleep- he’s restless. Out of options, Hermione heads back down.
day we have our huge bloody staff meeting, where I meet the absolute Head of the company and get a chance to impress her, I show up
Ron is taken aback. He’s never seen or heard Pansy Parkinson thank anyone for anything. He gives her a tight smile and moves to stand up.
“I don’t like this.” she hisses, “
“We’re your friends, aren’t we? You can talk to us.” Ron says.
“No, Granger. You don’t understand. Draco seems…” she looks around as if checking for other people before she leans in and whispers, “
So they sit for hours on the sofa, talking about Harry, about Pansy’s job at Witch Weekly, about Draco's work. And when the day turns to night, she walks him upstairs.
“Let's go over,” Ron repeats. “To Harry’s. Tomorrow morning. It’s a Saturday. You haven’t checked weekends, have you?”
“‘Mione, this could be it! The reason Harry's disappearing!”
“Don't you think we should cast some sort of protection charm? We never know what could be in there.”
Hermione is looking across the sitting room, frowning.
She runs downstairs to find Kreacher waiting by the floo.
She doesn’t want to be alone.
“Has Potter been murdered?”
“Pardon?”
“To what do I owe the pleasure?” she asks.
“Parkinson, glad we found you,” Ron greets.
“You’re right.” She can’t believe she missed it.
Weasley, has a woman never used her breasts as a pocket?”
The next week, Harry doesn’t leave at all.
They leave the bedroom and search the rest of his house.
Pansy walks down the Ministry hallway with as much confidence as she can muster, determined to keep the playful smirk on her lips, her chin up high.
“And then, on the
“I’m going to pay him a visit.”
Hermione, who knows exactly what's going on, smiles.
“Draco? Is that Pansy yelling?”
The duo grumbles, but eventually they end up putting wards around Harry’s floo. Hermione sets up an alarm spell of sorts, one that alerts each of them when Harry uses his floo. Pansy asks if they can track where he’s going, but Hermione doesn’t think there's a spell combination for floo travel tracking, so they stick with the alerts sent to their wands.
The way she narrows her eyes at Ron makes Hermione back up a step before she decides to stop them.
“Seems like a very tame job for the Saviour,” Pansy comments.
“I suppose you might be right,” she concedes, pretending not to notice Ron’s smile of satisfaction.
“Well, it looks abandoned in here.”
“Ron! What is
“No, you bumbling fool! Now he’ll know someone was here!” She looks livid, and Ron can feel his cheeks heating. Oh. Right.
Hermione lowers her wand, and Ron does too.
“I think you’d better tell me! Your house is empty, you say you aren’t dating Draco anymore yet both of you are
“Draco? What does that mean?” she asks, sinking back down and finding his hand, clasping it in both of her own.
“Pansy’s nothing I can’t handle, love.” Harry smiles at him, but Ron catches the split-second glare he shoots towards Pansy. Draco notices and rolls his eyes in Hermione’s direction, who smiles back.
“Is this the whole Draco being happy, except different? Because honestly Pansy, he might just want to be left alone-”
know where he lives, Weasley, doesn't mean
“Draco won't accept my owls!” she yells.
“I’m not sure,” she admits, “but it doesn’t seem like it.”
They stay there for a long time.
“Let’s go over.”
The weekend goes by without so much as a buzz.
Kreacher pops into the kitchen with a crack and stares at Hermione. “Kreacher, where’s Harry? Why isn’t he here?”
“Whatever.” Ron says. “We just need to get into his house, and set up some sort of security system to alert us when he leaves. Hermione, could you do that?”
Jordie Hertzoon was free. The creep who had been showing up at his hideout for months had finally stopped, and he could use his lab again. He couldn’t wait to get back to work. He was going to make the whole bloody lot of them pay.
Ronald Weasley was stressed. He had just been assigned the Hertzoon case, but was so distracted by Harry's potential involvement that his progress was slow and minimal. His boss was going to have to sack him soon if he didn't get his act together.
He looks to his mother and judging by her stern look, she knows exactly what he’s doing. Ron would feel bad, but they’ve been discussing the whole Malfoy thing for far too long, and Ginny clearly isn’t buying it.
“No, he has his Social Skills,” Ron and Pansy chorus, the latter glaring.
“I was going to say you weren’t my boyfriend- we were engaged, but Ron
“So none of us got the notification. Which means Harry didn’t leave. I'm guessing you didn’t get it today either. I would suggest it may have been my spellwork, but my level of magic and control is impeccable, so.”
Harry left this morning. Why?
“Erm, sure. Ron, can you-”
“Yeah, he clearly isn't done but I had to tell you-”
Weasley. Did you deduce that yourself?”
“Where the fuck have you brought us, Granger?” Pansy mumbles.
“We never did find out what they fought about.”
“Tomorrow, if all goes according to plan,” she replies, making her way towards their shared room.
Pansy has no idea where she’s going with this. Ron looks like he’s in his natural state, confused, so that reassures her just a bit.
“More unlikely than going to meet an old potions master turned convict? I think not.”
“Aren’t we sneaking into his house and stalking him anyways, ‘Mione?”
“Yes. Well, modified of course. I think if I could break down the layers of a tracking charm and a magical use detection spell, then maybe. I think the components of the two charms are compatible. Something that shows us where he goes instead of what he does.”
After having Ron test it by flooing to their flat and back, Pansy apparates them all back to the gala.
She crosses her legs and leans in.
“Pansy? Is that you?”
“Hey, no matter. We’ve seen what we need to know, we can get going.”
“So, Pansy,” she says, hoping her interruption isn't so blatant, “this is Draco’s flat?”
“Weasley can stay.” Pansy interrupts, approaching the desk. She reaches across and grabs a pen out of Hermione's breast pocket. Hermione is about to ask what in Merlin's name she’s doing, when Pansy holds out a hand and wandleslly transfigures the pen into a lavish chair. Ron openly gapes as Pansy delicately drapes herself across it, legs crossed, back straight as an arrow.
If Ron is offended at the jab to his branch, he doesn’t show it.
She stands, catches the devastation in his gaze when she lets go of his hand, and takes a step backward. She removes her shoes, before flinging herself onto the couch on top of him. His protests are lost in his quiet laughter, and it thrills her to know that maybe they are still friends, maybe they are okay.She scoops him up into a crushing hug, and lets him cry into her shoulder.
She turns back around to see someone stopped outside her door. She's far enough away that it isn’t clear exactly who it is. She halts her steps and feels Ron stop beside her too.
“Dunno?
“We’re going to put a trace on him.”
They depart under the agreement that Ron and Hermione wouldn’t talk to Harry, not just yet. Not until the notifications are back on.
“Just because
Ron smiles at her, because her confidence is one of the best things in the world. Ron agrees to buy Pansy’s dessert, if only to put her in a better mood.
“Mhm,” Ron says, nibbling on the edge of a biscuit, “And why do we trust the house-elf again?”
“It’s not unlikely,” Hermione says. She thinks. It’s definitely something Harry would do, even if he left the Field Aurors two years ago in favor of becoming an Instructor. Harry is one of those people who will always go after the bad guy, will always put everything aside to get revenge, justice for someone he loves. If Ron’s right and one of Harry’s trainees died- then going after Hertzoon seems like a logical choice, at least for Harry.
“That’s...not a bad idea, Pansy.” It really isn’t, and with her status and connections to the minister, she’s sure she can pull it off.
“A trace? Like the bloody Ministry puts on underage wizards to track their magical use?”
“Master has not been here since Friday morning.” Kreacher says.
Ron blushes and coughs awkwardly, while Pansy unfurls the roll and passes it to Hermione.
Ron rolls his eyes. Hermione works as a spell-maker full time, she knows everything about every spell.
Harry stares at her, eyes wide and mouth open in shock.
“Curses when she’s mad, I reckon,” he whispers to Hermione. She just gives him a blank stare and reaches out to pat at Pansy’s head, which she’s buried in her arms.
him, but she doesn’t think he needs that pressure. Right now he needs a friend to talk to, and so she’ll be there for him. Even if starting tomorrow they grow distant and he has his secrets again, she’ll be here for him now.
“Dunno,” he mumbled.
She can’t go back to sleep. What is Harry doing?
It's early. Hermione knows it’s early, but she also knows it doesn't matter. It’s not like Harry sleeps, anyway. Years since they used to camp in the woods on unreliable schedules, and Harry still rarely sleeps. He says that his dreams haunt him.
Hermione has her doubts, but Pansy insisted. She had said they needed to talk it out, to reconcile, and Hermione gave in, sending Harry an invitation to Florean Fortescue’s, identical to the one Pansy sent Draco. The boys had met awkwardly, before taking a seat at the same table.
“When will you put the trace on Malfoy?” Ron asks.
Just then there's an ear-splitting crack as one Pansy Parkinson appears in Hermione's office.
“Wait. You didn’t tell them?” Draco asks, looking at Harry. “You told me you were going to floo Ron and tell him-”
After a quarter-hour of hugs and dismissals, Ron and Hermione make it back to their shared flat, a small one-bedroom with an open sitting room and kitchen.
It’s empty.
They walk around Diagon, solemn for their friends, for a love lost. By the time they circle back to Florean’s, they are so stuck in their grief that they pause at what they see.
Ron knows he's covered in soot from when he slipped in the floo, and he’s holding back one red-faced Pansy Parkinson, who is still trying to launch herself at her friend. Draco is cupping his cheek where Pansy had slapped him. And Ron feels more than sees Hermione behind him, smug expression all over her face.
“I have friends in the right places, Granger, and that’s all you need to know. Are we talking Potter? I’m all ears.”
“It means we were together, Pansy.” His voice catches and his eyes water as he whispers, “and now we’re not.”
,” Hermione says.
So she floo’s over to Harry’s, early in the morning or late at night. Time doesn't matter. But she has to see Harry, to show him this new spell combination she’s been working on.
“Brilliant,” says Ron, because she is, really.
tracking who Harry has in bed with him. We’re here for the floo and the floo only.”
He gets a glare. “Don’t you give me that, Weasley. Bloody Potter almost got me fired! I figured since the bastard always leaves at perfect four-fucking-thirty, I could just use my wand as my alarm.”
Draco Malfoy woke up. There was no breakfast for him. He looked at the spot on the counter, where the food always lay. He stared at the blank space on his counter, in his heart, and collapsed to his knees in devastated sobs.
“Since Friday?” Ron asks.
She misses this, misses being so close, so comfortable to him. She misses the nights where they could visit because they could, not because they had to. She wants to tell Draco she misses him, she
“Oh.”
The last thing Ron sees before whisking away is Harry and Draco, holding hands, staring at each other with so much love in their gazes that Ron thinks they just might explode.
, and he’s never there! Kreacher says he’s always leaving at 4:3o!”
“I just-” Hermione cuts herself off with a cough and continues reading. “This is a huge list, and clearly we can’t narrow down suspects from this. You said he’s acting happy? So why are you coming to us? If Draco is happy let him be.”
After a few minutes of slow goodbyes and congratulations, the trio makes their way to the floo. Pansy is crying, Hermione is laughing, and Ron is just...really happy for his best mate. Hermione throws the floo powder down, clutches Ron’s hand in one of her own, and smiles.
She passes him a biscuit and tries to be annoyed, but Ron’s got a good idea.
She's shocked. No one can apparate in or out of the ministry. She says as much.
She doesn’t want Draco to leave her for the source of his happiness, whatever it may be.
“Anyway,” Ron says, shoving the last of his biscuit into his mouth and standing up, “We should probably head out. Dinner was great, thanks.”
Before Hermione can apologize, can process what just happened, Pansy slams the door shut, and storms away.
“DRACO!”
CASE CLOSED.
“Can’t we just...put it back?” As soon as he asks, he regrets it, because her glare becomes more intense.
She meets with Ron and Hermione, who agree that it is strange, three months after the whole catastrophe with Draco, for this to be happening again.
His eyes took her in, scanned her face, but if he felt anything, he didn’t show it.
“Did you say every day?”
“How are we supposed to… well,
“Well maybe he’s grieving then,” says Ron. It doesn’t make Pansy feel any better, but at least it would explain it.
“Come with me, you two, I have an idea.”
Kreacher gives a slight nod and vanishes. Ron sighs. Bloody house-elf. He makes sure not to let his annoyance show, because Merlin knows Hermione would hex him for it.
“Draco hasn't talked to me in

of all people, and she was worried that as soon as Potter’s wild mystery was unveiled, she'd find herself alone. Again.
She's touched. “Well, actually, Draco has been-”
“No! Would you both just… no!” Hermione sighs. It's like she’s dealing with
before I could explain!”
?!” She makes her way over to Harry’s bed, shrieking and confused.
Ron looks intrigued, but also slightly scared, something she can’t explain. Hermione sighs. She hands Pansy her favorite pen, and the other girl smiles, an actual smile, when she receives it. A swish of her hand later, and Pansy’s chair is back.
“He was such an idiot, taking every precaution to protect me, Pans. It’s his bloody hero-complex, I'm telling you.”
“I've been over every morning for three weeks Ron,
don’t want to just ask, but I have to know, so- Where are you going?”
“No! That would invade his privacy!”
Eventually, they stop going off. Harry doesn’t leave. But he never comes back, either.
Ron looks annoyed but tells Pansy everything he had told Hermione. She comes to the same conclusion that it
Pansy approached, and nearly sobbed at what she saw. Draco was staring straight ahead, blinking only when necessary. He had made no move to even greet her, or to pull his eyes away from the far wall. Pansy could see fresh, dried tears on his face, and the sight was so unusual and heartbreaking that she fell to her knees right there. She reached out a hand to stroke the side of his face, cupping his cheek and turning him to face her.
He looks to Hermione, eyes wide. His own expression is reflected back at him, both of them clearly at a loss.
“Thank you, Kreacher, I’ll be on my way.” Kreacher disappears with a bow, and Hermione makes her way over to the fireplace.
, he says, like he isn’t a perfectly well-mannered pureblood wizard. Draco Malfoy you tell me what‘s going on with you and Potter this instant I swear to Merlin-”
“She has a point,” Hermione mumbles. But she doesn’t get it. Harry would have told them. The Hertzoon idea is starting to become her favorite.
“Yes. Kreacher, we need you to let us know if at any point Harry gets near here. Can you do that?”
Hermione is now casting every diagnostic spell at his bed. Ron realizes this must look absurd to anyone else- but the two of them are Harry’s closest friends, and he’s never done anything like this before. It's something so uncharacteristic and sudden that they can't help but worry.
“Kreacher is being confused, but is doing as Miss asks.” he replies.
Pansy scoffs. “Of course I’m right.” Hermione expected nothing less, really. But her mind is still whirling.
“Harry Potter’s House!”
Pansy Parkinson found herself to be lonely. She missed the floo calls and time spent with her old Slytherin friends. It was like they had abandoned her. And now she was friends with
“Tomorrow, Hermione. And Ron. You
Ron and Pansy both still, confusion lining their features.
They keep the charms around Harry’s floo, out of habit more than anything.
“So, Pansy, this is all we’ve got. If you want anything more, I suggest going to the Aurors-”
“Oh fucking Merlin,” Pansy grumbles. She hates Granger’s ideas.
“Not the time for that! Ron, what were you saying?” Pansy thinks it's a little rude, but Ron seems concerned, so she lets it pass for now, vowing to fix it later.
“Is Draco rejecting me? Is this her way of telling me our friendship is over?” she cries one day, in Hermione's office, seated in her transfigured chair.
At this point, she seems to be having a debate with herself more than talking to them. Ron glances over at Hermione, and it appears as though she’s as lost as he is, a rare occurrence.
“Oh please, come in,” Hermione says, failing to keep the amusement from her voice.
“How did you know about that?” Hermione demands, gathering herself.
Now, Hermione thinks, it’s time to fix this.
as number 3.”
“I think he’s just going to work early. That has to be it.” Ron says as they walk down the narrow Ministry hallways towards her office.
“Ah Pansy, lovely to see you too,” Ron deadpans.
“-but like, it’s all good, mate!”
Draco is seated on Harry’s lap, head buried in Harry’s shoulder as Harry whispers into the blond’s ear. Hermione must have forgotten the spells, because Harry meets their gaze with watery eyes. He mouths a “Thank you,” to the three of them before leaning his head on Draco’s.
Ron and Hermione, fresh out of floo, had only taken two steps in before Kreacher had greeted them, arms crossed with a scowl.
Hermione rolls her eyes, knowing that that is
something Harry would do, but has a theory neither of them had thought of.
“Maybe he’s taking a break from people?” Hermione suggests.
“It’s not snooping if we’re doing it out of concern, ‘Mione!”
“Harry?” Ron whispers. He’s so confused. Harry finally enters and has to do a double take. Ron doesn’t blame him, he’s sure it's quite a scene they make.
Sheets neatly pulled over the corners, pillows organized and stacks, the spare blanket folded and draped across the foot of his bed.
“What the bloody fuck is going on?”
“We go over at 5 to see if Harry is still there. And if not, we can at least snoop around.” Hermione doesn't usually condone snooping- but Harry is up to something and Hermione wants to know what.
Hermione glances at him and he shrugs, because he doesn't need her help, per se, but Parkinson is not someone he wants to have as an enemy.
“Oh?” he asks, confused.
“His what?”
“Hertzoon?”
“Now. I’ve got to get
Ron sighs. But Hermione summons the House-elf anyway. Kreacher snaps his fingers, and all the blankets return to their place. Hermione smiles brightly and thanks him, but Ron just scowls, removing the protection spell from himself and not Hermione.
“I didn’t know if you guys would accept me.” His voice came out so small, so fragile, a voice Hermione hasn’t heard in years. “And it’s Draco, and I didn't know what you guys would say. And then I wanted to tell you, But I figured you’d be mad at me for hiding for so long.”
“Do you know Draco’s address?”
“Draco Malfoy, how DARE you not accept my owls! Are we not friends anymore? I bloody well deserve a formal fucking letter if that’s the case- not some second-year version of rejection mail-”
“Have we ruled out a secret lover?”
“So Malfoy is acting happy, and you think he’s been cursed?”
” Parkinson shrieks at them.
Gawain Robards found himself more curious. His trainer had been arriving to work on time recently. Curiosity was something a good Head Auror could not afford to have, he was to be focused on employee’s performance. If someone was suddenly doing their job, he had to appreciate that, and not wonder what had brought it on. But Robards couldn’t help but wonder why.
Hermione deflates, blinks at him, and slumps her shoulders.
His wand buzzes at 4:25, waking him up. He gets out of bed, makes his way to the floo.
Week Fifteen
“Well, er, he said that he and Malfoy aren’t dating anymore, and he was smiling, and he was going to say something else but I stopped the call...has Draco said anything?” Ron says it all in a rush, and Pansy thinks it the perfect time for her to intervene.
“And you won’t come?” Ron asks.
“No, no,” Hermione says, waving a distracted hand. Half an hour ago? She looks at the clock- It’s 5 on the dot. Where has Harry gone at 4:30?
Draco turns his glare to Ron now. Ron feels like this isn’t right, and he’s so very, very confused. “No, wait. Harry told
Hermione tells her. After a few years of fighting in the field, Harry had decided that he had spent his whole life fighting, and didn’t want to anymore. He remembered how much he’d enjoyed teaching the D.A., and soon became one of the best Auror trainers in the Ministry- teaching Junior Aurors everything they needed.
“Kreacher!” Hermione calls, hoping that the house-elf is nearby.
Hermione, startled, checks the clock again. 4:40. So Harry is leaving at 4:30. She nods to Kreacher, not even bothering to reply, and floo’s home.
Pansy finds out that he and Harry had been dating for three years in secret. She’s about to demand to know why he didn't tell her, but he looks so devastated that she lets him continue.
“I thought it would work,” she admits.
He falls into a peaceful sleep with her by his side.
-” He’s cut off by a loud gasp from Pansy, who he’s still restraining, just to be safe. “What, Pansy?” She doesn't reply, just points at Draco’s face, where he’s still cupping his cheek. It takes a minute for Ron’s eyes to catch it, but he sees it- finally. A glint of a silver band on Draco’s finger. Ron just stares, unable to register anything else. He turns to Hermione, but she’s smiling.
Pansy sits with Draco while he explains. She finds out that Draco’s shift goes from 18:00 to 04:25, and Harry would arrive at Draco’s at 4:30 every morning. She learns that he would sleep with Draco (“Actual sleeping Pans, actual sleeping.”) until 8, when Potter would make Draco breakfast and leave it on the counter, something Pansy finds equal parts disgusting and adorable. She learns that Potter would apparate to his home and
“Harry. We’d like to talk about your relationship with Draco.”
“Well, we’re thrilled, but we wish you would have told us sooner.”
She sighs. This is clearly going to be more difficult than she thought.
“No, no,” she says, waving a hand of dismissal. “It’s fine. I- Thank you. For the help.”
Ron looks confused but thoughtful.
“Guys! Harry just floo’ed! He said that- Wait, what's wrong with Pansy?”
“Yes, but do you think Harry would bother to do that?” he counters.
“Yes, Ronald.” Black eyes flash from beneath their lids, venom spilling from them. “When you both are widely known Slytherins accused of being on the wrong side of the war and betraying your country, you learn to stick together.”
Ron is very disturbed and looks to Pansy to see how she’s doing. She looks deeply touched, and her eyes are teary. Hermione meets his eyes, shrugs, and they both turn to Harry. Hoping to find some Gryffindor camaraderie they are shocked to find that Harry is smiling fondly at Draco, who has now begun to smile at Pansy. Maybe it’s a Slytherin thing to express love through death threats. Pansy gave up on restraining herself and rushed over to Draco, who enveloped her in a hug. Ron could hear whispers of “I’m so happy for you!” and “You may be marrying
“You sure he isn’t just leaving for work early?”
It’s a list of names.
It's made.
down or my boss will have my head.” Pansy says, back in her reporter’s robes. “This was fun, thanks!”
“And I did!”
Pansy looks at him and then laughs. She visibly relaxes in her chair, slouching just a bit, resting her elbow on the arm of the chair, and leaning her head into it.
“I’ve compiled a list of people who might be out to get Draco.”
“Or poisoned. I need your help to figure out why and who.”
Hermione sends her magic leashing out, sensing for the pull of Harry’s magic. She can faintly feel it. So she harnesses whatever bit of his magic she can as she throws the powder down.
“Sure it isn’t. But here’s the thing. Draco’s been acting all weird lately. I’m worried.”
Hermione and Ron reach the former’s office, and sitting on the desk, legs crossed, is one Pansy Parkinson.
“Left alone my fucking arse!” she yells, standing up. Her eyes flash a dangerous obsidian, warning Hermione in a way she's never seen.
“Then we can see if he still leaves on weekends,” Ron says, licking his fingers clean. “And pass me another biscuit, will you?”
He’s never been caught.
Ron swears.
“Ron!”
ask Harry. It's been almost two months, and it's still the consistent 4:30 every morning.”
“Stupid...fucking stupid Potter,” she mumbles as they sit at a table.
- she guesses Draco’s been sleeping on the sofa. Which, why would he ever do that? He has a perfectly comfortable king-sized bed upstairs. Pansy knows, she used to come over shortly after the war, when they could not bear to sleep alone in their Manors.
Pureblood witch or wizard learns the 247 essential social skills by the age of 11. If Draco isn’t leaving his house anymore, maybe- No. That’s impossible. He is a good, proper, pureblood.”
“Why’d you whisper?” Ron asks, making his way out of the floo with them.
to work. Apparently, Potter didn’t want the ministry knowing he came from Draco’s in the mornings, lest they track him back there and hurt Draco.
“Yes.”
that you weren’t his boyfriend anymore!”
Harry smiles at Ron too. For a moment it’s like when they were younger, just the three of them against the world.
“Isn’t that the point?”
,” she says, rolling her eyes.
If Harry is surprised, he let’s none of it show. According to Pansy, him and Draco had been together for 3 years and kept it a secret, so he was probably very good at hiding it.
“Parkinson?” Harry laughs. Hermione knows it’s his fake laugh. Seriously, she’s known him since he was 11. How obtuse does he think they are? “Ron, I don't know what you’re doing mingling with
should be treated as formal.
Her office door is flung open. She doesn’t look up, she knows only one person dramatic enough to actually fling a door open.
Pansy walks around the lounge and they all seem to realize at the same time-
Hermione weaves her way through the crowd, staying close to Ron and away from Harry. She had sent him a letter earlier, letting him know she had plans and couldn’t make it. However, they still needed to sneak in to meet up with Pansy, and if Harry found them it would all be over.
“I'm sorry! I was just nervous, and I was scared so I tried to beat around the bush! And I was thinking that- Wait.” Ron is startled. Harry had just gone from pleading forgiveness to a steely calm. Ron lets go of Pansy, and she inches to stand between himself and Hermione. Draco is the only one unsettled, which,
“Going? Where to?” asks Ron.
“Wait,” Hermione says. “Did you say he was going to say more?”
“Yes, and?”
Ron’s so tired. He’s been sitting at the dining room table eating biscuits for the last half-hour, while Hermione tries explaining to his family what they’re working on.
Ron is beyond confused. He’s terrified. He’s known Harry since he was eleven, has slept in the same dormitory as him for 7 years, slept in a tent with him for a horrible string of months. And never once has Ron seen Harry’s bed made.
“NO! Our magical trace would be all over it! All it would take would be a simple magical detection charm and he’d know!”
“Harry,” she says, the calmest one of them all, “are you and Draco engaged?”
At first, no one talks. Then Harry is yelling, and then Draco is yelling, and they're both crying. Hermione grabs her two friends and leaves, not before throwing a hasty Silencing charm over the table with the two boys. If they notice it, they give no indication.
“This wasn’t a random thing, Ron. According to the spell, none of these have been touched since yesterday morning. So he made it Friday morning and then left. But every time I come over, his bed is in disarray!”
“Get me out of these robes,” is all she says, before Hermione apparates them all away to Grimmauld.
“Draco, darling. How long have you been sleeping on the couch?”
It was that single word that caused Pansy to drop her hand and stand up.
“That's the point,” says Ron. “Harry always hated -still does hate- all that fame stuff. He just wanted a job where he could do what he enjoyed out of the public eye.”
“No, I suppose not. Let’s just have Kreacher do it, just to be careful.”
Hermione doesn’t give him the satisfaction of an answer. Simply walks over to the floo, expecting them both to follow.
“Why? What’s he been up to?” Hermione asks.
“Is that Parkinson?” Ron whispers.
Draco sleeps in his bed for the first time in a week.
