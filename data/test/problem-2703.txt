A final note appeared.
Draco mumbled the counter-curse, and the toad was released from its body-bind.
Saying nothing further, Draco stormed out of the room and slammed the door. Severus stared at the door in shock for several minutes before he returned to his desk and poured another stiff drink.
He paused, laughing outright at the irritation on Draco’s face. “I know, that was vague and convoluted. All you need to know is that the afterlife has many possibilities, and you will not be going to any of them.”
"Come in," he heard his mother call. Attempting to swallow the large lump that had formed in his throat, Draco entered the room.
Frustration mounted as Draco continued to pace back and forth in front of the bay windows overlooking the ocean. The thread continued to pulse and wave with his movements as he waited for a response… any response…
The idea of someone pointing a wand at his head had Harry slightly wary,  “What do you have to do?”
It was different for every couple: a tattoo of a name or a phrase, the appearance of a compass, the ability to communicate through dreams, a pull or tug, and so many others.
He shuddered with disgust, thinking of his father.
“Why? Hasn’t done somethin’ to yeh has he?” Hagrid asked, narrowing his eyes and peeking around Harry to look for the blond.
“Spot-on, Kreacher!” Draco exclaimed, beaming at the house-elf, who flushed with pleasure at the praise. “Okay,” Draco said matter of factly, “Can you get the pouch back in Hagrid’s pocket, and then take the real stone back to the Grimmauld Manor?”
He stepped back, changed her into a toad once more, and shifted into his cat form.
Several minutes passed in silence before Merlin continued. “Humans have free will, allowing us to make our own decisions. However, each decision has a guaranteed outcome, which can only come to pass if the decision is made. Some things are set in stone by decisions made long before us. But there are times where, when we choose a different action, we can change our entire path as well. That is what I want you to do.”
“If I had apologized to Harry sooner!” Draco was shouting now
He sighed at the other boy. “Fine then….Harry.” Draco said, looking away with a small degree of stiffness, still fearful of rejection.
“I should expect so,” he said haughtily. “Anyone who would put the school in jeopardy should be dealt with appropriately and immediately.”
Memories swirled around him, blurring his vision.
"You wish," he said with a smile and, without another thought, threw himself down the hill.
Draco paused, debating what to do. He couldn’t let Hagrid discover the stone was missing. If that happened, Voldemort would inevitably find out; there were too many risks to even consider. In his previous life, Draco could have transfigured a look-alike, but there was no hope of that now. Even with his wand, his magic wouldn’t be capable of such a complex spell at this stage.
Harry and Draco’s relationship had taken a dramatic turn as well, though neither was entirely aware of it. Harry’s new cat, "Dragon", was accepted immediately and fawned over constantly. Dragon was very friendly toward all of the Gryffindors, except for Ron, whom he seemed to have it out for. The cat enjoyed stalking him, jumping out of nowhere to scare him, knocking over his chess pieces, and clawing at his bedposts. Ron was increasingly frustrated, especially when Dragon teamed up with Crookshanks to annoy him.
Harry debated with himself. He hated Malfoy… and Malfoy hated him… right? But then why did he seem to care about Harry blaming himself when not even Ron or Hermione had noticed?
"They're amazing," Harry said, unable to look away.
With a wave of his hand, Merlin healed Draco’s injuries before answering. “There are a number of possibilities for those with the gift of magic, human and otherwise. Where they go depends on the life they lived, the death they suffered, and many things in between.”
Whatever this was… it wasn't a real snake.
“Father,” Draco responded, grateful that his voice didn’t shake.
Harry and Draco continue their day out, growing closer and making new friends along the way.
"They symbolize a life-long bond between two people," Draco whispered as he let go of Harry.
When the world looked at Draco Malfoy, they saw what he wanted them to see; a mask of pure arrogance and disdain. It had been beaten into him as a child; Malfoys do not show emotion. Fear was a weakness; love and affection were pathetic and nonexistent.
“About your father and everything. I mean, I’m sure you can hold off for a bit. He’s not going to try to make you a death eater tomorrow. But how are you going to handle it? What do you plan to do afterwards?”
When he reached the bottom of the stairs, he had to rub his eyes twice to make sure he wasn’t dreaming. He was standing inside what resembled a muggle apartment. Stepping forward slowly, in complete awe of his surroundings, he found a sitting room, a kitchen, a bedroom, and a bathroom. As he was walking back through, he noticed a piece of parchment on the kitchen counter. He couldn’t help but scoff lightly as he read the words.
Draco stopped pacing and looked at Harry in shock.
Harry's mouth fell open. In his haste to see Draco, he hadn't noticed anything about where he was.
Although he was better prepared, the force of the resulting blow was still a shock. This time, his father had used his cane, striking him hard against the middle. While he could certainly remember such pain from his previous life, his eleven-year-old body was unaccustomed to it. Before now, his father had only ever slapped him in the face. Draco gripped his stomach as he struggled to breathe, hoping against hope that he wouldn’t be sick and make the situation worse than it already was.
Draco’s voice cracked as he tried to speak, “I...I was afraid...if you didn’t feel the same...I knew you wouldn’t. How could you?” Tears spilled over again, his body trembling with the rejection he’d feared for so long.
Merlin approached him slowly, as though approaching a cornered animal. “No Draco,” he pleaded softly, “do not fear. You are not here to be punished.”
Curiosity broke through the sadness clouding Draco’s mind. After a moment, he was able to calm himself enough to shake his head no.
Draco was confused. Where was he? What had happened? His head was fuzzy and he couldn’t seem to think straight.
After what seemed an eternity of picking at his food and barely acknowledging his housemates, Draco heard the familiar flutter of owls bringing the morning post. His eyes immediately locked on the magnificent eagle owl soaring towards him, a letter with a familiar red glare in its claws.
In the end, it was the thought of Harry and everything he’d gone through that cemented Draco’s decision. “I’ll do it.”
He was assaulted and overwhelmed by the memories of his life and death. Failure, regret, and grief swept over him like a tidal wave. For an endless eternity, he was drowned, suffocated, and released repeatedly; never allowed to breathe… never allowed to collapse…
He tried to take his time and enjoy the scenery, but he couldn't focus on any of it. As much fun as this was, his heart was racing at the thought of what might await him when he finally found Draco.
Nine minutes and 48 seconds later, Draco emerged from the shop, looking slightly calmer, much to Harry’s relief.
After a moment, he looked up to find Harry smiling at him. It was a small smile, but it was there. The first one ever directed at him. Feeling awkward, he looked away and moved toward the couch. He sat and waited, determined not to say another word until his question was answered.
Before he could begin to clean it up, however, the ink seeped into his skin, becoming a flat picture for several moments before disappearing altogether. Could this be…?
When a howler had delivered its message, it tore itself up. This one had caught fire. Someone had to have cast Incendio, destroying the howler before it was finished.
Rather than answer, Harry walked over to the toad, who was still trying to move towards the door. He focused on summoning a fish tank to the room, set up properly for a toad, and charmed so that things could be put in, but not removed by anyone other than Harry or Draco. When it appeared, Harry used his wand to levitate the toad before dropping her in.
Draco thought it through for a moment then sighed, “In for a knut in for a galleon, I’m not giving up now. But you better make good on your promise Potter. Lets get on with it, I haven’t got all day.”
He jerked, realizing he’d tightened his grip on Harry.
Excited for the afternoon ahead, Harry took off at a run towards the eye center. As he got closer, he could see that Draco was pacing back and forth in front of the entrance.
With a twisted smile, Lucius Malfoy pulled a knife from his robes and advanced towards his son.
It was chaos.
Kreacher nodded and disappeared, surprising Draco again when he was back in less than three minutes. “Kreacher has returned the pouch with the fake stone to the giant man’s pocket. The real stone is being hidden at home as Young Master requested,"
” he sneered as he corrected Dobby, “was healing Young Master, but Dobby would not stop his whimpering long enough to notice that Young Master’s wounds were being better.”
“Yes, I’ve found something I believe you would be interested in,” Draco tempted vaguely,  internally smirking when he saw her eyes widen with curiosity and greed.
Harry looked at him with skepticism, and Draco couldn’t help but laugh lightly, “Okay, so I don’t know
The man before him was no older than 30; his eyes were a piercing blue and his hair the darkest of black. Power reverberated throughout the oasis, and yet he was not afraid; somehow, he knew this man meant no harm.
Throughout the world, willing followers of Voldemort were entirely drained of their magic as their dark marks shifted to cover their faces.
Sensing Harry’s worry, Dr. Edwards replied, “Not to worry, my boy. It’s a simple set of spells on your eyes as well as the glasses you currently have. It will give me all of the information I need.
On the far end, he saw the source of the rushing sound: a brilliant waterfall. The water flowed over rocks, cascading into several small waterfalls at around 6 meters off the ground. The water continued this way for around 4 meters or so, emptying into one large waterfall, which fell into a large pool.
“The Deva is a guardian of nature. They live in everything, from the trees to the soil. They are invisible to the human eye, but they see everything that happens in the forest. They were touched by the love shared between Luciana and Nicolas, and they grieved at their deaths. They merged the trees themselves into an impenetrable wall. The Bougainvillea was trained across the wall and nurtured, growing into the entryway we came through.”
“That is utter shite and you know it!” Draco yelled, cutting off his godfather once again. Normally Severus would never stand for this behaviour, but he was completely shocked by the fact that his godson was yelling and cursing at him. It seemed as though he had indeed abandoned his father’s teachings if he was willing to lose control like this.
He was cut off at the beginning of his rant when a note landed directly on his head.
He felt as though he couldn’t breathe.
Draco nearly jumped out of his skin as the shout echoed through the seemingly empty corridors. Once he was sure he could breathe properly again, crept down the hall to the alcove where the shout had come from. As quietly as he could, he pulled back the curtain. It was Harry Potter, nursing a bleeding hand and cursing under his breath.
Today was, without a doubt, the strangest day of Harry’s life. If he was honest, it had been a trying day; finding out he was famous was almost more of a shock than discovering he was a wizard. The shock from learning the details of the night his parents died was so great that he immediately blocked it from his mind, hoping to sort through his feelings at a better time.
Getting the feeling there was more to the story, Harry said nothing and waited.
Harry had taken to hiding away in the Black Family Library rather frequently during his stay at Grimmauld Place. He had found an old sofa in a darkened corner, worn but at least free of creatures. Harry had found it was a great place to silently brood in his anger. That morning, Harry was lying on the couch, as usual, arms crossed, raging at the world. He'd been there for several hours and had been starting to fall asleep when suddenly, a large black dog jumped on top of him, licking his face furiously.
With a quirk of his brow, Draco waved his wand, returning Umbridge to her human form.
“Mm,” Harry agreed, still watching Draco.
Arms encircled Draco once again, and Harry began to speak, “Once upon a time, there was a witch named Luciana, and a wizard named Nicolas. They were on different sides of a bitter war between two nations, but they loved each other desperately. They chose this place as their meeting spot, each vowing to visit every week. Months passed this way, and the war raged on. Thousands lost their lives, but the lovers continued meeting in secret, cherishing every second together. They had planned to flee together, but on the night they were to leave, tragedy struck.”
Draco jerked, “Well...erm...you know...your glasses.”
Not a single person thought about Umbridge returning the following Monday; the freedom was simply too good to waste. The only dark cloud was Filch, who was miserable without Umbridge ordering him to torment students. Of course, everyone found this funny and had a lot of fun ignoring the decrees right under Filch's nose.
“And?” Harry asked, intensely curious and nervous at the same time.
Draco was silent for several moments, staring at Harry, seemingly thinking something over. Harry was starting to get uncomfortable when the blond asked hesitantly, “Harry, how long have you had those glasses?”
A hand grasped his shoulder and Draco flinched, unable to help the immediate reaction to another person touching him. He relaxed after a moment, realizing that Merlin would not fault him for his weakness.
Just as he finished pulling on his black work boots, another note appeared.
Draco nodded stiffly. He had been rather angry when he learned that not only had Harry been abused, no one had thought to help him. That was the most regret he’d ever felt about losing Harry’s friendship. If they’d been friends, Draco would have done whatever was necessary to spare him that treatment.
The cat jumped off of the sofa, transforming into Draco a moment later. He kept his eyes lowered to the floor, “I may have turned Umbridge into a toad?” he said slowly, his voice laced with guilt and came out as less of an admission and more of a question. It was obvious that he was expecting a thorough scolding from Harry.
He began a low chant in parseltongue. Tom was rendered immobile until moments later, he began shrieking in horror and agony. The dark mark ripped itself from his skin, taking with it the results of his experimentation and violently reverting him to the 71-year-old man he would have been. Seconds later, he collapsed, his heart giving out.
But even he didn’t believe that.
Exhausted from the events of the day, the pair drifted off to sleep together, comforted by each other’s presence.
If Draco wondered, he didn't comment. Instead, he followed Harry, both excited to see what the rest of the day would bring.
Harry was taken aback by the random question, “Erm...two years or so. I should have had them earlier but my Aunt and Uncle…” Harry paused. He wasn’t quite ready to talk about that yet. Thankfully, Draco didn’t question, and just focused on Harry’s current glasses.
At this, Draco’s eyes shot up.
proud. So yes, and thanks.” He turned and began to head toward the door. As he opened it, he turned his head toward Harry, “Oh and Potter? Next time, just ask. I don’t bite... Hard.” With one final smirk, he transformed into his cat form and began walking slowly down the corridor.
Draco walked into the dimly lit shop, surprised at how familiar it felt, even though he’d only been in there once. “Hello, is anyone here?” he called into the seemingly empty shop. “Welcome,” came a voice from behind one of the stacks of wands, “here to buy your first wand, I presume?” Olivander stepped forward, appraising him with piercing eyes. “Yessir, I’m Draco Malfoy,” Draco responded, rather nervous despite himself. “Ah, of course,” the wandmaker rasped, grabbing his measuring tape from the desk. Olivander released it in front of Draco and it began to measure him every which way. Draco wished he could just tell the man which wand was his.
“What I do with my free time is none of your business. I can see you are angry. Would you care to talk about it?” Many people thought him heartless, and in many ways it was true, but Severus genuinely loved his godson. He’d been there when the boy was born and had always tried to be a fatherly figure for him, as Lucius had taken little interest besides poisoning his mind.
He reached a point where the water was crystal clear and beautiful, freezing where he stood as a herd of red deer emerged from the forest. He thought they would see him and flee, but they took no notice of him at all. He scarcely dared to breathe, petrified of breaking the enchantment he had wandered into. The doe took turns drinking from the water while they watched the fawns frolic and play. When they were done, they simply wandered back into the forest. Harry stood there for several minutes afterwards, his heart warmed by the sight of the beautiful family.
The theory was proven when relief flashed in Harry's eyes. He also noticed that despite this, Harry squared his shoulders, seeming to brace himself for something unpleasant,  “Harry Potter," he said stiffly, turning towards Draco's mother and holding out his hand, "nice to meet you.”
"This was done using a blood quill, correct? I'm guessing it was your detention?"
At that moment a pair of glasses sailed just past Harry’s ear, causing him to jump back in shock. Draco turned toward the receptionist with a light glare, “Excuse me, but just how is he supposed to pick a pair of glasses if they are flying all over the place?”
Gently, he pulled Harry by the hand and led him over to the sofa and handed him a cup of tea he’d brought with him.
Dobby’s eyes filled with tears and Draco was afraid he was going to panic again. He had to choke back laughter when Kreacher slapped his hand over the other elves mouth and placed him in a headlock, speaking calmly despite the struggle, “Young Master is not to be listening to Dobby. Dobby is being a stupid elf and is knowing nothing about anything,” he said matter-of-factly, seemingly oblivious to the fight Dobby was trying to put up. “Young Master is being very lucky. The kitten is being bonded to Young Master as a familiar.”
“I’ve been doing some thinking about what you said, Hermione. I never took the time to explain why I was so angry and everything that had happened. I lashed out. So I’m going to tell you everything, and I want you to listen until I’m done. Can you two do that?” He asked, looking at them expectantly. They nodded without a moment’s hesitation.
A couple of hours later, Harry made his way to the seventh floor. After making up with Ron and Hermione, he was in good spirits, but still nervous about his talk with Draco. When he opened the door to the room of requirement, he stopped and stared.
As Harry broke through the treeline, he was forced to a sudden stop. He had come to the top of a very steep hill. The stream of light vanished, and he wasn't sure what to do now. He contemplated his options for a few minutes before deciding to climb down the hill. As he placed his foot on the edge, another note appeared.
“Kreacher, please!” he shouted. Draco couldn’t be sure if it was the use of please that had done it, but Kreacher stopped immediately, breathing heavily with large tears streaming down his wrinkled face.
They were growing closer every day. They still argued and challenged each other, but there was no malice behind it. They learned they had a surprising amount in common and could spend hours debating their interests. Draco began tutoring Harry in Potions, while Harry trained him in Defense. Within a couple of weeks, they had begun meeting every night.
After a moment, Harry decided against worrying too much, as did the rest of the students. Umbridge wasn’t there, and that’s all they needed to know.  They chose to spend the class practising some new spells they’d been learning, or work on their homework for other classes. Even Ron, irresponsible as he usually was, managed to get some work done.
It was a seemingly random branch, but there was a note beside it. Reading the note gave him the explanation; the branch was a portkey to a small island, unplottable to wizards and unreachable by muggles. The Potter family had many estates and properties, but his mother had chosen this one specifically for him, because of its beauty and seclusion.
Without another word, Draco approached Grimmauld Place. He’d only ever seen it at night and he was rather shocked to find that it wasn’t any less gloomy during the day. Stepping towards the large and battered front door, Draco braced himself, remembering that the house had been left empty and decaying for the past six years. He reached out to knock on the silver handle, jumping slightly when the door opened, seemingly on its own, releasing the most intense smell of neglect and decay Draco could ever have imagined. It took all of his willpower to step over the threshold and into the dimly lit hallway.
Panic reigned.
At this, Harry burst into laughter once again. Draco glared, “Just what on earth is so bloody funny!” he shouted. Harry said between laughs, “it’s just…you could have gotten out of there yourself if you had tried!”
He had left Europe and moved to the tropics.
Harry turned Draco around and hugged him, whispering words of comfort. When Draco ceased struggling, Harry spoke into his ear, his voice rough with emotion, “Have you ever heard of a creature called a Deva?”
Draco winced, unable to answer.
Feeling curiously calm, Draco moved to the bench as well. “So,” he began, “where do we go when we die then?”
Harry was surrounded, but he only saw Draco, bound, bruised, and bleeding.
He began to move, but it was too late.
“That’s brilliant!” Harry exclaimed, thinking of the darkness of his cupboard. He had Dudley’s second room now, but who knew how long that would last. Now, he wouldn’t feel so afraid if they locked him away again; he would at least be able to see.
Harry chuckled, “No. I came here about a month ago; when I told you I was going on an extended investigation for the ministry?”
Harry jumped up and ran towards the voice, forgetting his pain completely. He reached Draco in moments, sweeping him into a fierce hug. As their eyes met, they kissed with such love and passion that the field could have burst into flames and they wouldn't have noticed. When they were forced to break for air, Harry leaned his head into Draco's shoulder, inhaling his scent and revelling in the warmth and comfort of his arms.
Terror gripped Draco’s heart like a vice as he scrambled to his feet and began to back away. Though he’d known he would eventually be punished… desired the chance to offer retribution for his crimes… he couldn’t stop this small attempt to escape, now that he was faced with it.
Sirius had already talked to Harry once that summer, teaching him about pureblood families and sharing his childhood with him. Sirius had told Harry that he wasn't a bad person, and those few words had meant the world to Harry. That being said, Sirius excluded, of course, Harry was still furious with the lot of them for ignoring him over the summer and trying to hide everything for him.
I do not own Harry Potter.
In the middle of the trunk, where a lock normally would have been, there was nothing but a simple square panel. Thinking it over for a moment, he touched his hand to the panel and said, “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.”
Draco turned to Harry, who was looking at him rather than at the flowers. “What are they?” he whispered, feeling that if he talked too loudly, he would disturb this perfect moment.
That was two years ago. Harry hadn’t been to the eye-doctor since and his glasses were old, worn, and getting too small for his face. It didn’t help that Dudley’s favorite activity was seeing if he could punch Harry hard enough to break them. He couldn’t see properly, but well enough that no one raised any further concerns, so he had dealt with it as best he could.
“I saw my father… He bullied Snape. He was horrible to him. Worse than you ever were, even worse than my cousin… ” He looked at Draco, his eyes red, swollen, and once again shining with tears. “He thinks I’m just like my father. He says so, all the time. He’s only teaching me because Dumbledore made him. I can handle the way he treats me in class, but the way he tore through my memories… and he mocked them, Draco. it’s like he’s getting back at my father by tormenting me.”
The idea was so tempting. "But won’t father be angry with you? He gave a very strict budget.” Draco asked, concerned for his mother.
“Not a big deal? Harry,” the blond paused, taking a calming breath, “Olivander compared your wand to Voldemort’s. He made it sound like you could be headed the same way as him, just because your cores were from the same bird,” Draco scoffed, “
A little look at what our boys got up to in the garden ;) MxM SMUT! EXPLICIT! Don't like, don't read.
There was no safe answer to this question; Draco knew that beyond a shadow of a doubt. It was simply another method of intimidation. Any answer would only give his father information he hadn’t had before.
“Well,” Harry began,” I knew Hagrid wouldn’t be up for all of that, and then I thought maybe just you and I could go. So I talked to Hagrid, and we’re on our own until you leave to meet your mum…” Harry paused, mortified to realize he had just assumed Draco would agree, “if that’s alright with you?” he asked nervously. Sure, Draco had agreed to go shopping with him, but that had been for school supplies, not spending an entire afternoon exploring.
“And that’s it. Any questions?” Harry said.
Harry rushed to Draco, taking his face gently in his hands, “Please don’t be upset with me. I know I should have told you, but I thought you might run away from us. Why? Why didn’t you tell me?”
All at once, something caught his eye… a flicker of light… could it be?
“Would you two cease that infernal arguing?” he groaned, slowly opening his eyes and glaring lightly at the pair of elves as his head began to throb. It was only as they went silent that he noticed another noise that he remembered vaguely from before he passed out. As he became fully conscious, he was surrounded by a melody so beautiful and peaceful, it brought tears to his eyes. He had never, in this life or the last, heard a comparable sound. It was then that he registered the soft weight against his chest. Lifting his head carefully, his eyes widened when they were met with the piercing blue eyes of his kitten Lyra. Only, something was different.
The relief turned to ash in his mouth as the masked figures, shrouded in black, converged, resembling a dark cloud as they surrounded their target.
Draco had stopped crying but kept his face buried in Harry’s shirt for comfort. Muffled by the shirt, “How do you know all of this?”
Draco turned his head and glared daggers at his attacker; tree root, just big enough for his foot to fit in. He tried and failed for a few moments to remove his foot, quickly giving up and shouting, "Merlin's Balls! Harry will get your arse over here and HELP ME?!"
Harry hesitated for a moment, and then nodded, reclining on the sofa.
“Now, now,” he mockingly chastised Umbridge, who was once again in toad form. “A professor of your standing should have better manners than that.” Without another word, he moved to the sofa and picked up a Quidditch magazine.
Harry cast a Tempus charm, shocked to realize it was already afternoon. Thankfully, it was Saturday, so he didn't have to worry about lost time. Harry quickly dressed, gathered his things, and headed for the kitchens.
Disclaimer: See Chapter 1! I own nothing!
Draco and Harry turned to look at Hagrid as well, “Uh...er…” he sighed, realizing he didn't have much of an option at  this point, “we’d be glad to take yer with us.”
With rose cheeks Draco turned around a few times as if to find another blond, French boy in his room — then pointed at himself. '
, Dobby showed up at our door all of the sudden a few months ago — I remember that as I was the one to let him in. I don't think I was truly possessed by the locket back then, at least not yet. He asked if he could stay for a while, hide away. Don't ask me what he was hiding for — perhaps the smart little elf knew he would be of some use sooner or later.'
When he thought the dragon would never land again, it suddenly leapt down, a large lake appearing from underneath the clouds. 'We have to jump!' he heard Hermione shout. He caught a glimpse of her finger pointing at the lake beneath them, only a few more feet away. Draco sighed deeply.
'I'm here,' Harry replied, placing a hand on his shoulder.
'Will you keep on sending James letters during school months?' Harry then asked.
'I'm not sure,' Draco answered, reaching out a hand to help Hermione get up again. And as Hermione was back on her feet, Harry collapsed to the ground as if exchanging positions. Turning towards him immediately, Draco saw how he had his right hand placed upon his scar — screwing up his face and shouting in a scary way. 'Harry?'
, as he got second place for arriving at the Merpeople's village first and saving two candidates instead of one. Fleur had been under the attack of grindylows and had to pull back before finishing her task, which made her score no points at all. But it hadn't mattered to the French girl anyway; the safety of her little sister had always been more important and worrying than her score.
‘Fleur,’ Draco whispered. The girl didn't react to it, keeping her eyes firmly shut. Draco sighed and gave her a small push against the shoulder, an action that caused her to frown slightly.
A side-glance to the right was enough for Draco to know it was Harry whom was helping him to look a little normal again. 'Merci,' Draco said to him before turning himself back to his staring crowd.

'What?' Harry asked, shocked and certainly surprised by the discovery. 'And you didn't visit me?'
The itching soon evolves into stabs of pain, as if someone has casted Crucio onto him. Draco grabs ahold of his blackened arm, dropping himself to his knees. The wilted rose staring judgmentally at him, as if it's his punishment for destroying such a beautiful thing gifted by Mother Nature. The curse starts to spread again, and its black clouds drift slowly over his shoulder, sending terrible pains over his arm. The process lasts shorter this time, but it's more painful than before. Draco finds it difficult not to scream and digs his fingers deep into the soil as if to relief the pain. Dark brown earth crawls underneath his fingernails, and the cold feeling relaxes him a bit. Inhale. Exhale. A long breath helps him calm his mind now too, and he slowly stand up again, wobbly on his feet.
A little angst and shouting at each other never hurt anyone, did it? And it wasn't for long because they love each other too much (obviously).
'Wait!' Harry shouted behind him, maybe a little too loud as Hermione hushed him. 'What about you?'
I really hope you'll like it and I'll probably change back to Draco for chapter 8 again; I just like writing from his point of view a tiny bit more! Enjoy! :)
Harry sighed deeply, which was already enough for Draco to know how it went. 'You won't believe how many questions he kept asking me about this party; wether I liked the food, wether

His lips parted to say something but Draco hushed him, holding up a finger to the boy's mouth. 'First of all, I want to apologize. I should have told you it's impossible for me to remain your friend as it would be betrayal to my dear Beauxbatons. For that,

I really hope there's still someone interested in reading how this story continues? :/) Anyway, I still enjoy writing it, though updates are slow as usual (sorry). I believe there will only be one more chapters left after this one, and then Papillon will officially be finished. I already want to thank those of you whom stuck around for so long, it truly warms my heart!
'Tomorrow?' Looking at her as if she had said something completely mad — which she kind of had— he got a nod of her head in return. 'Don't we have to plan things first?'
For a second it made Draco smile as well — only a faint glimpse — before his mother appeared in the entrance hall with a grim look on her face. He knew that look all to well; a look that showed that something was
'I can see them as well,' Neville admitted. 'I witnessed my grandfather's death.' He placed a hand on one of the Thestrals' heads and smiled.
, Draco thought as he glanced over at the girl's table. He was friends with almost all the girls at Beauxbatons; they simple adored him. It was not only because he could do the most intricate hairstyles, but also because he beamed a certain elegance they all wished to be surrounded by. Draco had never minded their attention; he
Sneaking out of the common room again with this time Harry on his heels, hiding underneath his invisibility cloak — Draco didn't know how to feel at all. He was nervous and scared; afraid that something would happen to Harry must he be discovered.
Draco's hand moved from his stomach to the medallion around his neck. He was glad it was still there — glad no-one had taken it away from him. He slowly nodded his head. 'It's not your fault,' he then said, staring more deeply into Harry's eyes whom now were shining like polished emeralds.
A few cups of tea and butterbeers for Harry later, they had gone over every little aspect Draco knew about dragons. Draco had shrunken the books for Harry to take with him in the pocket of his hoodie; something he himself would have never done but the boy had insisted on doing. The bright blue sky that had hovered above their heads that morning had transformed into a darker blue with some stars. It surprised Draco that time had passed in such a quick pace; normally he was always aware of the time no matter what. He was surprised to see it was already so late, surprised to know that he had spent so much time with Harry without even realizing it.
Breath was catching. Couching. Soft breathing in his ear that wasn't his. Draco was still alive, but was he himself again?
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
Weasley,' Draco then said with a small, hesitant voice.
'Why are you telling me this? Why do you care?' Harry asked, his voice a bit exhausted by the sprint he had had to make to stop Draco from running away.
On Sunday morning, a bit before the break of dawn, Draco decides to leave his room for a walk in the gardens. He needs the fresh air. He needs to leave his heavy robes in the room and his glove, at least for one more time. Those robes, that glove... they have grown to be a part of him since a while now, and the feeling of leaving them behind in his room is freeing. As if everything is alright once more.
' later the pearl has transfigured itself back to it's original shape; a china tea cup with an ugly drawing of a peacock displayed on one side and that of a misshaped snake on the other.
Coming to a halt on a deserted square in Paris, Draco said his goodbyes to the twins and hurried himself to the Portkey Madame had arranged for him. A few other students followed him as well, their eyes searching for the old and scruffy object their Headmistress had informed them about. The row of objects looked as if stolen items from a poor man living on the streets, and Draco picked out his rotten apple almost immediately. Pulling a face of disgust he placed a finger on the soft flesh and felt his body getting pulled away into a swirl of time and space as he traveled over the Channel to England again. With the smallest rustle of leafs he landed on the forest's muddy ground a little away from the Manor, the rotten apple rolling down the slight hill before popping away into nothingness. Draco could see the roof of the Manor he hated so much and turned his back towards it without a second guess, retrieved his shrunken broom from his pocket and blessed the night sky for turning dark at already an early hour during winter. Flying over the trees of the same forest he had landed in before, he made his way to London again with the cold wind blowing through his hair.
'Because you're the Chosen One,
Harry smiled at the idea. 'Sounds like a good plan, Luna.'
With his hands sweating and his eyes locked in those of Harry's, Draco'd waited for the Wizengamot's verdict. There would be no sentence to Azkaban, they'd concluded, but instead Draco would be magically bound to the Malfoy Manor property for four years. To his mother, the same destiny was called.
At last, the dam broke, and Harry’s tears fell freely. Sentiments were rare from Draco Malfoy, and Harry never needed them. Draco had shown him every day how much he loved him, even when they fought and argued. Harry had never had a doubt in his mind.  However, knowing and seeing are two different things. The words in the poem, and the sight of the man Harry loved so freely, had left him completely stunned.
Pain.
He turned again towards Kreacher. “So because our bond happened naturally, she can use magic? But how?”
He had tried to leave it all behind.
He ground his teeth as the Gryffindor laughed, clearly enjoying his shock and bewilderment.
As the darkness closed in on him, he was able to register a faint mewling sound and a softness around his neck. The last sound he heard was a purring that seemed almost musical, before he allowed himself to be pulled under, finally succumbing to the inky blackness that called so sweetly to him, promising him freedom from pain, fear, and despair.
Draco looked to the left and noticed that the land began to incline after a short distance. His eyes followed the incline, and he was surprised to realize that someone had magically formed a gentle hill leading to the largest part of the waterfall.
Merlin sighed heavily. “Your guilt and fear… your certainty that this is what you deserve… it pains me greatly.” With sadness in his eyes, Merlin approached Draco, who remained motionless as Merlin placed his hands on his shoulders.
“I’m going to take care of this.”
“The war did not end as it should have. With your help, I see a change to rewrite and restore destiny, and the fate of our world along with it.”
“Everything alright?” Draco asked, looking nervous himself.
“Alright there you two?” Hagrid boomed, effectively breaking the strangely intense moment. Draco’s hand dropped from Harry’s shoulder and they both nodded. Hagrid had left to get Harry an owl for his birthday and had just returned.
Before fear and memories could overcome him, Harry took out his wand and tapped it to the closest piece of the wall he could find.
Now that they were shopping together, Harry was extremely excited that he might finally have his first real friend, particularly one that Dudley wouldn’t be able to frighten. As they stood outside of Olivanders, Harry reflected that Draco was likely to be a good friend, if his current behavior was anything to go by.
Thursday evening, Draco was doing homework when Harry burst into the Room, his face pale and clammy. He took one look at Draco before dropping to his knees and vomiting. Thanks to the magic of the room, the mess disappeared as soon as it hit the floor. Draco moved behind Harry and, after hesitating a moment, began to rub his back gently. It was amazing what sharing a bed, even when one is in cat form, could do for a relationship.
Suddenly, the colourful stream veered away from the river, leading him once again into the autumn leaves of the sycamores. The brilliant shades of orange and red were made even more beautiful by the sunset shining down on them.
“Easy there, just calm down now,” Merlin said gently, easing him into a sitting position on a nearby bench.
Draco shook himself and stood, hardly daring to believe it. “You….you’re sure? You don’t want to think about it? I know we haven’t been together all that long….and we never really talked about marriage…”
Draco was ripped from his pleasant memories when a slash of pain struck him across the cheek.
Suddenly, Hagrid spoke up, “Well, here ye are. I’ll be headin’ off fer a bit. Figure I might as well pick up some supplies for the school, long as I’m here an’ all. I’ll be back when yer done.”
Draco moved to her side, speaking in a rather harsh voice, “apologies, I’m afraid I lost my temper. I hadn’t intended to harm you physically. I had decided that the best revenge against you would be to turn you into the filthy, crawling animal that you are.” He took a breath and continued, “Unfortunately, you’ve overplayed your hand.”
Obviously trying to keep the anger from his voice, Draco said carefully, “Because Olivander
Now Draco was furious, although truthfully he was mostly just embarrassed. “Potter, you git! Stop your laughing and get my foot out!” he shouted as he struggled in vain. He was seriously regretting that he had let Harry convince him to leave his wand in the hotel room.
His heart started to race and his palms started to sweat. Draco was overcome with the memory of the last time he had seen his mother. The pain and grief ripped through him as if it had just happened. His mother continued to hum and he shook his head, trying to dispel the negative emotions. He reminded himself that his mother was alive just past this door, and raised his shaking hand once again.
He paused. He noticed the words in his hand read, "I must not tell lies". He made a mental note to ask Harry about it later and applied the ointments to his hand. As soon as he was done, he saw a great amount of tension leave Harry's shoulders. He felt another twinge of anger as he realized the boy must have been in far worse pain than he cared to show. He placed the gauze over the ointment and began the slow and careful process of wrapping the hand. Once he had a good start on the wrap, he began speaking again. "As for Voldemort, he is the reason I’m talking to you about this. Even when I believed the ideals my father spouted, I never wanted to kill for them. That's what I would be made to do, eventually. Voldemort has come back into power, and my father is in his inner circle, or at least he was the first time around. I would be made to get the dark mark. To serve. To torture. To kill. Maybe not right away. But it would happen. I know the truth. Voldemort is completely mad. I may not have been there for it. But I've heard the stories, just like everyone has. He will destroy everything. I will not scrape and serve beneath the robes of that mutated piece of filth. But if I'm going to be free of that, I'm going to need your help. Once I tell my father, I'll likely be disowned at the very least. School will become a danger once Voldemort gets word. He doesn't take kindly to refusal, no matter who they are. He will want me disposed of, just for the sake of sending a message to the others. The only possibility I have of avoiding it is with your help."
A crash echoed throughout the room as the door flew open, revealing his godson Draco. The boy’s face was as emotionless as ever, but his eyes and magic were swimming with fury.
Severus smirked in satisfaction when the knocking ceased. Obviously, whoever it was, lacked any sort of spine if they gave up that quickly. Must be some pathetic first year… or Longbottom.
“Enter.”
Had Merlin known something about this?
Of course! Draco was so excited he could have jumped, though he stopped himself in time. He’d hoped that Kreacher would agree to help him, simply for the fact that he was a Black family member,  but he hadn’t thought about the fact that with Sirius in Azkaban, he was the only heir available, meaning that Kreacher would automatically serve him. Still, he had to be sure, “How do you feel about such an arrangement, Kreacher?”
Draco paused. His breath was shaky; his eyes were shining with love, hope, and nerves.
And all thanks to one little note.
Draco scoffed at him, eyeing the bottle and glass on his desk with scorn.
Also, just as a reminder, from here on out the chapters will switch between Draco and Harry's POV :)
Harry has destroyed the Howler and Draco has been humiliated in front of the entire school. Tides begin to turn, plans are made, and relationships begin to evolve.
“So, what are you going to do?”
Draco didn't want to live in a world like that and knew deep down that he didn't deserve to.
As it says in the summary, this chapter will be in Harry's POV. This chapter was getting really long, so I decided this was a good place to end it. The next chapter will be Harry's POV as well, and then it will alternate between Harry and Draco. Please review!
She was surrounded by a faint silver glow.  Her eyes, which were beautiful on their own, were shining, making the blue look ethereal. Her fur was glowing as well, grey and white colours sparkling in the dimly lit room. As she looked at him, Draco realized that the melody was coming from her.
Harry shook his head as Hagrid walked away, but he wasn’t all that surprised. Hagrid seemed to favor leaving Harry to his own devices.
Six months had passed since the end of the war, and Harry Potter was at a complete loss of what to do with himself. Hogwarts would remain closed for the next year, and Ron and Hermione were in Australia for who knows how long, looking for Hermione’s parents.
At this, Kreacher lifted his head immediately, “Of course Young Master! Kreacher is not thinking! Kreacher will take care of the home and Young Master. Young Master will be safe,” and then he surprised Draco by speaking rather sternly, “Young Master is to be calling Kreacher if Young Master is needing anything. Kreacher will take care of him.”
Harry looked at him for several moments as though trying to make up his mind about something. Finally, he spoke, “I’m not taking Remedial Potions. He’s been teaching me occlumency.”
Before Draco could protest again, his mother blew him a kiss and bid him farewell, “Have fun, darling. I’ll see you this afternoon. It was lovely to meet you, Harry.”
Harry nodded. Draco began to speak, while slowly cleaning his hand.
Instead of hitting him, however, the beam of light stopped right in front of his left hand and remained there while he struggled not to inhale the entire lake. Once he regained his bearings, he swam towards the shore as quickly as he could, disturbed and annoyed when the beam continued stretching and trailing behind him, without ever touching him.
They melted into the embrace. Tongues tangled together, hands wrapped in hair, and they pressed as close as they could get.
Draco looked at Harry for a few more moments before smirking lightly, “Well… I do have an idea or two.” When he paused, Harry scoffed lightly, “Enough drama, out with it already!” Draco chuckled, “Well, this first part is just knocking her down a peg or two. She was very angry at first, but pretty soon she’ll be willing to do whatever we say.” Harry smiled at Draco’s use of the word ‘we’. “In the meantime,” Draco continued, “We’ll get into her office and find anything we can to incriminate her, getting rid of those blood quills while we are there. We can also work on a plan for getting her and the minister exposed. I was thinking Granger could be of help in that regard.”
The basement of the hospital was a place Harry had never visited before. A cold atmosphere hung in the hallways like ominous clouds and made shivers run over down his spine with every step he took. Hidden again they waited for the elevator to reach the -1 floor, the man striding out of its doors with his quick pace picked up fast. Trailing him along the cold and abandoned hallways they reached a set of double doors, locked with a special numeral code system.
muscles he possessed. It took them three times longer than normal and Draco could feel every second creep away, every eye of every passing student casted in their direction. Upon arriving at the infirmary, they nearly ran into Harry's friends. Ron and Hermione were just leaving the room, Ron with a bandage stuck to his cheek. 'What happened to you?' they called out in unison at the sight of their friend.
isn't really a man I aspire to be.' Draco casted his eyes to the snow beneath his feet.
, like the Ravenclaw girl had said, to wear hats all the time, but to Draco it was something that simply belonged to the school. It was like those colored ties and scarfs the students of Hogwarts wore; a hat was simply part of the Beauxbatons uniform. Madame Maxime had told him many times before he didn't have to wear a hat all the time, that it was a tradition that went back many centuries ago and didn't have to be taken so seriously. Yet Draco had refused to listen to that advice. Beside, he couldn't show off his long silver hair in front of the other students — it would simply be a disgrace to their ego, looking as disheveled as they did. They would also compare him to the girls; something he'd rather not have. He wasn't a girl even though he had more elegance than most; he was a beautiful boy and would also like to remain seen that way.
Their words were like a bandage over a sour wound; it helped, but wouldn’t help the wound heal completely. Draco felt pathetic for having ran away from Harry like that. Why hadn’t he just told the boy about his feelings, about what was bothering him?
, Harry then decided. He reached for his wand and casted a spell to free Draco from his statue. With one arm wrapped around the boy's slender waist, he then pointed his wand at Hermione. But as he was about to cast the spell again, he felt something sharp stab in his back. As he turned around he looked into the huge, yellow eyes of one of the Merpeople. 'Only one,' she warned him in a hissing voice.
way and it made him feel like the boy could do or ask him anything and Draco would grant his wishes without hesitation.
Day was slowly turning into night, and the forest had already grown darker since they had arrived.The hooting of an owl could be heard, together with the howl of a wolf somewhere in the far, far distance. Deciding that they were safe now, Hermione took out the locket, cup and sword from her small purse. Everyone's eyes stared at the three items as they laid on the ground; on pieces of moss and fallen leaves. 'What now?' Draco asked curiously. He looked up at Harry, whom he expected to know best.
Harry nods. Of course he remembers. 'That's probably the most stupid question you've asked me in 5 years.'
'Of course I was telling the truth! I would never have joined the Tournament! Not even if I were seventeen and could legally participate!' Harry seemed to get angry for no reason; hadn't Draco just told him that he believed him?
Ignoring their questions, he leaned closer to Fleur whom sat beside him. 'I wonder what Durmstrang will do to top our entrée,' he said to her in French. At times like that he was happy he spoke a language others didn't understand; it kept curious Ravenclaws out of his conversations.
'W-what—' he started, but was unable to finish the question as his eyes filled themselves with tears.
'It's lovely,
'You — you need any help?' Harry asked, shyly entering the living room. The eyes of his three relatives immediately shot in his direction, frowned eyebrows following.
Harry would forever remain clueless on how an angel’s eyes worked, or what powers they possessed exactly, but within a few seconds Dudley turned around again and went down the ladder in the most peaceful and humane way Harry’d ever seen him do. It was quite a strange sight, but one he could definitely get used to.
'That's — that's actually very clever of you, Ronald,' Hermione admitted. 'I think I found out where one stores their prophecy,' she then said.
Harry could see Draco's cheeks blush slightly at his own words, and it was definitely not because of the cold. An arm found its way around the boy's waist and Harry pulled him closer. He laid his head down on Draco's shoulder and could feel the soft lips of the blond’s kiss upon his head. A perfect silence fell between them as they watched more snowflakes wandered down.
to help Harry. Why that was, Draco didn't know, but he did know that every time he was around Harry he felt happy, somehow. He felt different. He felt... almost as if he was one of the girls. And even though Draco always had told himself he didn't want to be seen as one of them; he couldn't help the fact that it made him feel special. That it made him feel like he was being
Christmas trees from floor to ceiling decorated in white. Sparkling floating candles, red ribbons and enchanted snow everywhere. The decorations for the Yule Ball were the most delightful thing Draco had
He knew about many different ways one could breathe underwater but non of them would last for an hour; he had a lot of research to do starting tomorrow. But that was fine; helping Harry was something he loved to do and with the boy's best friends supporting him again, Draco was sure they would help search for something as well.
"They can't see you, can they?" he then asked the boy as he slid down the ladder to the attic. He only shook his head, still too exhausted to answer with words.
Draco's hand found Harry's cheek and he pulled him closer to kiss him again, a lazy one. '
Draco’s heart stopped beating as he slowly turned around to face the boy. 'What is it, Harry?' he replied, voice tired and eyes not willing to look into the Harry’s.
Draco had never seen Harry so furious before and it made him tremble slightly, suddenly feeling scared of the boy.
'Suspicions that may or not be true,' Draco answered, again in a whisper-like tone. It surprised them all, as they had thought he hadn't been listening. 'But I'll wait.' His eyes held one long, last stare in Harry's before he turned around, up the stairs and out of view.
They all thought about a safe place for a second; everything from Grimmauld Place to the Burrow — but Ron was the one to make the final decision. 'Shell Cottage,' he suggested. 'That's the place where Bill and Fleur currently live. It's under the Fidelius Charm, so it must be safe enough to disapparate to. You can apparate us away from here, right?'
It's too late to be sorry.' Draco swallowed, tasting the salt of his tears. 'Just — leave me alone from now on. That's also what you wanted, wasn't it; to be left alone. Well, your wish is granted!' He looked into the boy's eyes one last time, into the beautiful green emeralds he had adored so much. The look of green that had started it all. Then the eyes the color of grass were covered in morning dew; the first time Draco had ever made Harry cry. And it broke his heart more than anything he had ever done before.
And it worked; it made Harry run after her — through the circle of that yellow fire and through the tall grasses of the Weasley premises. 'Harry!' Arthur called out after him, already hurrying himself behind the boy. A large flame rose up in front of him; denying him his passage. Draco ran over to the man, rose his own wand up to the night sky and started whispering spells together with Arthur. He caught the man glancing at him with eyes that seemed to radiate a trust he had never felt upon him before — at least, not from that same man.
The tears then finally ran down his cheeks as if a dam had burst. In his trembling hands he held the remainder of what he once used to love so much, now sacrificed to prove his love to a boy who didn't even love
, Draco! Your father is a Death Eater so it'll only be natural for you to become one as well!'
Harry’s cheeks turned a bit more pink. ‘Stop calling me
"Dangerous
'No idea. Ran into Draco yesterday evening and he basically shoved me a piece of parchment in my hands and took off without a single word.'
'You're going to Slughorn?' Hermione asked, standing up as well followed by Draco and Ron. With the three of them next to each other, they watched how Harry made his way to the portrait hole.
, Ron. I appreciate that.'
, it broke free as if a vase had burst and its water streamed out — unable to hold it in any longer.
Harry glanced at Draco over his shoulder, who had a weak smile on his face. He seemed a bit nervous, almost shy which was an emotion Harry thought the boy didn't possess. ‘But why?’
A soft kiss on a forehead, probably the last. A cough, so loud and painful it made a dozen eyes blink. The lights were dimmed, the curtains closed. In a crescent-shaped line family stood, their gaze upon a ten year old girl in bed. A blue blanket pulled to her chin, her mother by her side. Small, half-closed brown eyes looked around the room; resting their gaze upon each person for a few seconds before skipping to the next. A last look. A last
I can. Madame Maxime herself taught me how to cast it. Something about being able to protect the girls,' Draco answered. A proud smile lingered upon his lips.
He felt Harry chuckle by his body's movement. 'I have no idea what you just said, but whatever it was, it always sounds so damn good when said in French.'
announces — and makes his way towards the entrance hall with quick steps.
— with Lavender Brown. Draco had heard her cry a few days ago as well; somewhere in a deserted corridor with enchanted birds swarming above her head. They had talked; she had confessed somewhat of having feelings for the ginger-haired boy — but had found it hard to openly confess to the boy himself.
The snake only came closer as seconds passed, swallowing the pile from underneath Castor's feet. It was upset. Angry. A curse gone wrong. Hands met as Draco finally managed to pull Castor onto his broom, and they quickly soared towards the door to let Draco's wand bombard it to bricks. A hard landing followed as they hit the stone tiles of the seventh floor hallway, Draco doing a kind of weird tumble to get up to his feet again — wand raised at the opening to close it with the most determined look on his porcelain face Harry had ever seen — closing the space he had just created.
The golden doors of the dining chamber got thrown open and house-elves walked in holding trays of food. A buffet started to gather on the two tables, filling the room with scents of the most delicious foods. Starting with soup and some bread, followed by complicated dishes like escargot; the French cuisine would definitely be missed in Scotland.
As they both had moved onto Draco's bed again, keeping each other tightly in an embrace, they had slowly drifted off into a wonderful sleep.
Two hands then joined themselves onto the boy's chest, eyes closed as both wings opened up fully again — the left one still twitching and shivering. Speechless, green emeralds watched as a soft yellow glow illuminated from the boy's entire figure — a light glowing the brightest around the place where he was hurt. In an instant the blood slowly faded away, and the spot started looking less sore. But then the wing collapsed again — ending the magical glow.
'How can't I be afraid?' Draco then said, interrupting the man's words. 'I'm terrified and I don't — I don't want to kill you!' Bolting up from his chair, he looked into the headmaster's eyes; staying calm and looking at Draco with a certain pity.
But yet again he was running — and wouldn't he keep on running for Harry? He caught a glimpse of raven-colored hair in the distance, but it soon disappeared behind the tall grasses again.
Staying behind Dumbledore Harry followed him further through the house; into the living room where a chaos of the same caliber appeared in front of their eyes. The only thing that seemed untouched was a striped blue sofa in the middle of the room — old but spotless and in Dumbledore's eyes apparently very interesting as the man kept his eyes locked on it. 'Slughorn', he then said. 'I know it's you.'
'Do you think you'll ever be able to grant that wish?' Harry asked.
After dinner they were guided back to their carriage, able to let all of the new faces and experiences sink in. As Draco entered the house-like vehicle he noticed that the inside had been expanded, making place for a room large enough to comfortably fit all girls and himself at once. Victorian sofas and chairs were spread across pastel blue carpets, a friendly fire roared with flames and even a few Rococo-style paintings had made their way to the walls. Sighs out of relief called from behind his back as the girls strode inside as well, throwing off their robe's capes and collapsing down on the sofas. Marie stretched out her hand from one of them, inviting Draco to come sit by her side. Draco took the invitation with a smile, taking place beside her on the velvet fabric.
'It's still working just fine.
The gold of the timepiece shone brightly in June's sun and Harry accepted it with a smile. 'I'll cherish it greatly.'
'H-Harry?' A whispering voice, a cold hand upon his face. Harry pushed the hand away; he himself too busy with fighting against the enemy in his head.
,' he said to him. His words snapped Harry out of his enchantment. A nervous little smile appeared on his face as he nodded and basically ran back to his friends.
Draco raised an eyebrow and finally let go of his books, placing them upon the wooden table that seemed to wobble underneath their weight. He pushed the top one in Harry's direction, tapping on it with his index finger. 'Well then, let's get started.'
The boy shook his head. "Not by far. For now however, it's enough." Without another word or warning, the enormous wings then both folded themselves and disappeared into the boy's back as if it was the most normal thing in the world. A pale, smooth back was the only thing left visible — besides the wound that now looked flat and had a pale pink color.
' he replied. With a frown Harry threw the invisibility cloak over himself again, disappearing in front of Draco's eyes. 'And don't make too much noise!'
,' he whispered before Madame's door unlocked in front of their eyes; access to the boys granted. Her door was locked in a truly magical way; locks from floor to ceiling shaped in those of tiny stars graced her door and turned in various directions before they clicked into place and lit up as a starry night sky— and as they all glowed a pure white light, the door swung aside to let the one who knocked inside.
Hope you liked it, though, and get ready for some angst *hint*.
'Out,' was all the professor repeated.
"Don't be like that, Draco,' his mother interrupts, sighing once again, "I actually wanted to buy a new owl for you, so you could perhaps exchange letters again with some old friends. I bet they're worried about you… it's been five years.'
Scared. Frightened. All emotions of that range surrounded Harry's heart as he and Cedric landed upon the grounds of the most macabre graveyard he had ever seen. Tombstones with demonic statues were spread across the land, crows gathering around and flapping their wings in the moonlight. The ground seemed pitch black like the sky above his head and in the midst of it all a large, black cauldron was boiling on a roaring fire. And it was then that Harry realized he had seen that very graveyard before; it was the one from his nightmares.
'Another man? Like you?' Dumbledore said as a completion of Draco's sentence. 'Well, yes. But that's not it. The most important thing you must remember from this is that you cannot always protect the ones you love, Draco. I couldn't protect him because he was different than me; more than I had thought he was.'
bad idea. A stupid idea. A
Everyone grew quiet again, as they stared at Luna Lovegood standing in the back of the room. Her eyes seemed confused; as if she hadn't said anything at all and was wondering why everyone was looking at her. But of course she had said something, and it had drawn Harry's attention. 'A diadem?'
'The final task is nearing,' Harry then said. Nervosity was hearable in his voice.
Both the boys nodded. 'What will you do to Umbridge now, sir? You won't let her stay, will you?' Harry asked with worried eyes. Even Draco could share that worry and saw Madame Maxime glance in their direction at the mention of the pink devil's name.
. She picks up the Prophet again and Draco peers at the front page, looking at the face of Potter holding up a new addition to the Nimbus brooms family.
Draco had to bite his lip to hold in a sob — his heart beating too fast and his soul ready to burst out into cries. He slumped back onto the bench, his face in his hands as Hermione finally let go. She wrapped and arm around his shoulders, her head of curls close to Draco's face. '
"Wether they still
'Aha, mister Malfoy,' he said. 'Would you perhaps stay with Harry for a little while? Apparently the Hungarian Horntail is acting a bit…
wouldn't obey him anymore, would stand up against him. But he
"Vanity," the boy simply answered, and it was enough for Harry to understand. It were all things he should've known — things he should've remembered had he paid more attention in his religion classes at school.
They stayed up in the sky for about an hour, landing with aching muscles. As their feet touched the grassy ground of the Quidditch pitch again, Draco threw himself in Harry's arms  and made the boy stumble. Together they fell upon the soft grass, eyes locked and smiles both wide and bright. He pressed his lips against Harry's and felt the warmth he had lost in the cold air slowly return to his body again. 'I want to try it by myself now,' he then said to the boy. Harry frowned first before smiling and nodding his head.
'Do I really have to sleep in a room of my own? Can't I just stay with you?' Harry asked. They were following the way Harry's golden footsteps were taking him; obviously to the dormitories but it was only a question to which one and what exact room.
Of course Harry knew that; he knew Draco's father had found out who James was and that his mother probably knew as well, but still there had always been this little spark of hope burning inside of Harry's chest that had hoped that a letter with his father's name upon it would land on his doorstep again. Or at least — be carried inside by Hedwig in the most secret way. 'Dumbledore told me not to worry about him, though. I still haven't figured out why I shouldn't.'
'It's only a theory; I'll explain it to you once I've figured it out.' The boy then sneaked a hand around Draco's waist and pulled him a bit closer, his head resting on Draco's shoulder before closing his eyes.
As Harry came closer to Draco, whom was already standing by the edge of the Lake, a bright smile lingered upon his lips. Draco huffed because of it and crossed his arms, chin lifted again as he looked away from the boy. 'Something wrong?' Harry asked as he took in Draco's presence.

His eyes wandered off to look at some students from Durmstrang who also threw parchment pieces into the goblet after Fleur. They all had serious expressions on their faces and gave each other a clap on the shoulder as encouragement. Draco kept his eyes on Fleur's friends when they passed by, making sure they wouldn't
'Ron!' Draco called out as he neared the ginger-haired boy. 'Have you seen Harry?'
'And at last, we have decided to only bring one
Draco heard how Harry's breath quickly became steady; him falling into a peaceful sleep after a night full of adventure. But he himself found it hard to fall asleep at all. His task and now that of Castor as well were weighing down upon his chest; doom's day getting closer and closer.
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
As it left his lips, Harry could hear the bells from the church’s tower chime seven times. He'd always been able to hear it all the way to where the Dursley's lived — and it sounded the loudest up on the attic. “I’ll be back soon again. Don’t go anywhere!" he told Draco as he once again opened the hatch.
Harry felt his head fill with heat. How did he mean, there isn't anyone that needed a cure? What about Draco Malfoy? Had they just simply forgotten his entire existence?
'But it never really mattered to me wether I got married or not; it's more something Father was so keen on. Of course Mother would've loved to have a grandchild but I don't really see myself as the perfect figure to become a father.'
'For an old potions book?
’ It escaped his lips before he had known, had come out in French without realizing. It tired him. Exhausted him.
to fight.
Their second option had been a potion that would make one able to breathe underwater, but gave you the mind of a fish as a side-effect. Harry had tried it out, though; desperate to find something that would be better than a snapping bubble. As he had swallowed the vile potion down his throat, he had felt his normal thoughts slowly drift away. It had been as if he was dreaming; dreaming that he was a fish. All he had been able to think about was water, water and more water. Harry had launched himself into the bathtub and had apparently been swimming in circles for more than an hour; perfectly able to stay underwater without oxygen — but with the mind of a fish he wouldn't be able to succeed in his second task.
Waking up again, Draco's first reaction was to reach out to his left, only to find an empty bed. The right side was the same; no Harry there nor anywhere in his room. His mind didn't know why it had hoped he would've been there at all — it was unlikely that the boy would be found at the Manor. His mother wasn't in his room either; had probably left to catch some sleep herself. A pale moonlight shone in through his window and with much difficulty, Draco sat himself up straight to crawl out of bed. He could feel the scars on his stomach and chest move and itch with every step he took, could feel how they were about to burst again and cover his pajamas with blood, but still he moved his feet.
'Why do you talk so low of him?' Draco interrupted, a suspicious look in his eyes.
, Draco. Help me?'
,' he murmurs, pointing his wand at his left arm. It is an easy spell, yes, but has been found working excellent in front of the eyes of strangers. He himself of course can’t see whether it truly worked or not — but he’s confident in his own spell-work. Draco learnt about the spell from his fellow Slytherin, Zabini, when he’d desperately tried to hide an acne scar from the Wizarding World, and memory draw the faintest smile upon his lips.
Already seven years had passed since the battle, and quite a lot had happened since. They had attended Ron and Hermione’s wedding — where Draco had declared to be awaiting a proposal from Harry after catching Hermione’s bouquet the Muggle way — and witnessed the birth of their first child Rose. Harry had gladly accepted the role as the baby girl’s godfather, and now had two children under his wings to love. Teddy visited France every month for a week — stayed with Andromeda for the rest of the time. It was always nice to have him over, and though Harry had been worried Draco wasn’t the kind of person to like small children at all — the blond had happened to fall completely in love with the teal-haired boy.
Draco swallowed again at the thought. He actually didn't remember a lot from that night, only vague flashes of green light. A body meeting the night. A dark figure hunched above him. Latin words. 'I don't remember,' he admitted. 'At least… not everything.'
They both hurried themselves to the pier and made it five minutes prior to the start. Bartemius Crouch Sr. was present again and seemed seconds away from having a heart attack. But at the sight of Harry, all nerves seemed to clear from his face; he had probably been worried the youngest Champion wouldn't show up. Professor Dumbledore had also been awaiting Harry and gave him the smallest of smiles as he pushed him to the edge of the pier. Ron followed and pushed the gillyweed in his hands. 'Draco's note said its better than the Bubble-Head charm. Also something about not having to cast a warming charm? Couldn't really read his handwriting', Ron explained to Harry before giving him a thumbs-up and moving over to the others.
Were they going to, Draco wondered. Was there really a way to be able to tell Harry about the task he had been given without dying? Hadn't he almost died by just some speculations coming from the Chosen One's mouth? Scared, Draco suddenly realized that there might be a chance he would die even if Harry ever found out himself. Would that really be the case? Would Harry be able to find out
A silence fell over the room; hung in the air like a magic spell — entrancing everyone to stare at Draco with wide eyes. The ones that had cried now cried more; this time in sadness again. Others complained, started to question the decision of their God. "God has made this decision. And our God knows best," Aaron declared, trying to calm everyone down. Eventually they shut their mouths and the room grew eerily quiet once more, before they answered in unison.
'Did I?' Draco nodded. 'Didn't realize. Must have said your name in my sleep.' Harry's eyes betrayed him; he knew all too well he had woken Draco by calling his name.
'I can't,' Draco shouted back. He could almost taste the wind, smell the trees but still his eyes refused to open themselves.
'It was here,' the elf said, hiding himself partly behind the cabinet's door as if Ron would hit him if he said something wrong. 'He came in the night — took away all my masters their most priced possessions.'
— End of Chapter 4 —
changed was Harry himself; he'd grown a few feet, his voice'd dropped a little and his mind had brightened. Perhaps not as bright as it could've been, but bright enough for him to pass most subjects and school, and realize how badly he got treated by his family.
Dudley glanced at his friends over his shoulder, whom were still laughing. 'No, I think I'll keep it. Let me see —
in this raven-haired and green-eyed boy?
Malfoy suddenly seems to freeze; his eyes a bit wider than usual and his posture as straight as that of a wand. 'D-did you just call me by my given name?' he asks, tone emotionless and lips almost moving invisibly. It's only then that Harry notices that he indeed did call him
to keep you from drowning to death!' Draco shouted back. Harry climbed out of the Lake, face still furious. It made Draco sigh. 'You know what? Forget about it! Find something yourself!'
Footsteps neared, but Draco's head was spinning and he didn't feel so well. Voldemort stopped in front of him, looked down upon his helpless figure with an almost cheerful look in his eyes. ‘Stay away from him!’ Draco heard behind his back. He didn’t look to see whom had said it, nor who grabbed him by his robes and pulled him away from the monster in front of him. It could’ve been Hermione. It could’ve been the twins. He truly didn’t know.
. I find you quite
a scruffy young boy at all, Draco didn't notice Harry taking a step backwards until it was too late; his reaction a little too slow. Draco briefly bumped into the painting behind him, quickly jumping aside. Such things happened when an angel wasn't paying attention and had to move too fast; things they normally wouldn't collide with or would go through like ghosts had the opposite effect. And of course, Harry noticed it.
'Did somebody else do it for you?' Dumbledore speculated, his anger fading a little.
Draco stopped in front of the carriage's door. He then understood what Harry had tried to say; he was just worried Draco would get into trouble for helping him and that he himself would get in trouble with his ignorant and unsupportive friends if they knew he was hanging out with someone from a rivaling school. And wasn't it logical that Harry would have wanted his friends their help instead of Draco's? Wasn't it the same for Draco? Wouldn't he rather want to help Fleur than Harry?
After around fifteen minutes of endless walking, they were met with a loud roar of a creature — a roar Draco had heard before. He quickly glanced at Harry, whom did the same for as he knew exactly what kind of creature was waiting around the corner.
Harry's eyes found their way back to Draco’s scar which had become fully exposed again as the foam had slowly melted away. ‘But—‘ The boy cut off his own question, perhaps too afraid to ask.
Still, there was something missing; Draco's presence. It was Fleur's wedding — the wedding of a girl Draco had looked up to for years and had befriended from day one at his French school. The fact that he couldn't be there literally broke everyone's heart; especially that of Harry and Fleur herself. In her little speech she did before attacking the dance-floor with her now-husband Bill, Fleur had talked about how Draco had designed the dress she was wearing and how it was inspired by the albino peacocks that walked around the Malfoy property. A lot of Order members had appeared nervous or had looked away at the mention of those peacocks. Had they perhaps visited the gloomy Malfoy Manor before?
. Flashes of his parents dying and others he didn't even know passed by, a pain as terrible as the curcio spell now filling his insides.
As if that was enough for Harry to understand, it finally hit him what the locket — in combination with Draco's mind, body and soul — was trying to do. It was trying to kill him, and perhaps his friends eventually as well. He, Harry Potter, was its main target. The same target that Voldemort had its eyes on — and therefore a part of its split soul as well. It was only logical, Harry now realized, and
'Actually, I-I think I've always been more jealous of you than that I felt hate towards you. I hated you because I wanted to be you, or at least, be your friend.'
Draco thought.
, I can’t allow that.’
I also hid in here,' Draco explained.
They stayed in one of the many towers the castle of Beauxbatons held; a place where they were close to their work and far away enough to live their private lives. During holidays they would either visit Draco’s mother at their country side cottage or stay at Ron and Hermione’s home in England. It was quite the life they were living, and they were enjoying every second of it.
clear her throat, Bellatrix' screeching voice seeming less frightening coming from her mouth than from the real Bellatrix, and Draco dearly hoped the goblin wouldn't notice the slight difference. 'I wish to enter my vault,' she announced, raising her chin a little and throwing the goblin a vile glare. A glare that wouldn't even scare a stray-cat at midnight.
Draco thought.
. With knife and fork in hand he's ready to devour a piece of toast when he suddenly feels the itching again; a strong and stabbing feeling running up his left arm. He drops his fork and takes a deep breath, not daring to look up at his mother who hurries over to his side of the table, cautioned by the sound of dropped cutlery.
?' she asked. Her eyes were still roaming the room and Draco followed them, discovering the doors to their compartments were now hidden behind the very Rococo paintings he saw before. 'I think your room is that one', Marie then said, pointing towards the only Rococo painting that held the portrait of a boy. It made Draco smile; such detail could only be produced by Madame Maxime herself.
A day passed at Shell Cottage, and a sleepless night joined along as well. As the others were peacefully sleeping in their rooms, probably dreaming about the sea outside their window, Harry laid awake with a strange Draco by his side. He couldn't help but feel the boy's eyes stabbing in his back while he tried to sleep — their darkness like a void trying to swallow him one inch at a time. As he turned around, giving in to his curiosity, he found his thoughts had been truth. Draco's dark eyes stared back at him in a creepy manner, and as he hesitantly smiled a sort of grimace — Draco smiled back in an even creepier way.
. "My dear boy… did I hurt you? I didn't hit you, did I?" It was a panicked voice, accompanied by a panicking woman. "I really thought I'd missed you by a hair, but then it felt as if I'd hit something and—"
Immediately Harry is curious to know if his gloved hand is also struck by the curse, or his shoulder. Maybe it has even reached his chest already? His heart jumps at the idea and he feels all the color in his face drain away.
Draco felt the four eyes of his friends upon him, still staring with mixed feelings — probably wondering when Harry had become so friendly with one of their rivaling schools' students. Of course they knew that Harry knew Draco, but had they any idea that the blond had helped their friend prepare for the first task? 'I-I have been busy. Taking classes, studying, looking after

he said and kissed him on his forehead. He stroke a few stands of hair out of Harry's eyes and gave him a beautiful smile; one that made Harry's knees go weak. Draco walked away as if fluttering, throwing another encouraging glance over his shoulder and hurrying himself to a nervous looking Fleur. She was dressed in blue, of course, and seemed to sigh out of relief at the sight of Draco. Her thin arms wrapped themselves around the tall blond and a feeling of jealousy hit Harry hard even though he knew there was nothing to worry about — just the sight of someone else hugging
long since he smiled that wide.
, she was apparently called, but Draco found it a rather rude name. Whoever had given it to the depicted lady hadn't been much of a gentleman. '
'I can't; I have orders not to tell what it does exactly. They're afraid you'll tell
the fear that laid beyond them — the fear of going home again and face monsters one wasn't supposed to face at home. 'Can't you stay here? Can't Madame Maxime protect you?'
The boy shrugged his shoulders once more. "My brothers say they are, but I can't see what they mean. My powers seem normal — my special strength boring."
'I've never heard you agree with me that fast, Gellert. Perhaps I should use this technique more often when you're rambling on again,' young Dumbledore said to him.
'Once I peeked through your bedroom's window and saw you writing a letter, and another time I saw you sitting on a swing in a park. I wanted to approach you but whenever I got closer, it felt like something was pulling me away; as if there was a bubble around you that was guarding you.' Harry didn't know what caused that, but he did know that it was a pity he hadn't noticed Draco glancing at him during his boring days. 'But then Dumbledore sent me a letter and—'
'Yes, but- I was trying to say something else,'
love. A voice in his head kept telling him it was a bad idea, an idea he would regret — but Draco waved his thoughts away and grabbed his wand. He untied his hair and pulled the locks into a horizontal line. He felt his hands as well as his lips tremble terribly as he placed the tip of his wand against the point where one would make a ponytail. He paused to take a look in Harry's eyes and then whispered
because Davis wasn't in his office. Not letting any hope down yet, they’d then decided to talk to the Minister of Magic himself. It would sort out everything in the quickest and simplest way, wouldn’t it?
'If I ever was,' Draco replied, reaching out for a slice of toast. 'But you could say so,
Harry's mind exploded as another casted spell held him hostage against one of the statues; the statue of Voldemort's father. His scar was burning as if on fire as Pettigrew performed the rituals of Voldemort's rebirth.
Draco hid himself a bit more behind Harry's back but somehow could still feel Ron's eyes cast upon him, even though they were still inspecting the carpet in great detail. 'I—
remember? Not an angel.'
Our youngest Champion; in love with the lone boy from his rivalry school!' A voice cried out. Blonde curls bounced on her shoulders with every move she made and her green robes stood out more than a dark cloud to a clear sky.
Draco thought to himself.
Longbottom,' he answered, coming to a halt by a painting Harry recognized all too well; it was the painting of the flower-boy Raphael that had graced Draco's door last year. Neville nervously pointed at himself and Draco nodded. 'Harry told me you found this secret room for the D.A. to practice in, and that reminded me of a room Raphael had told me about last year, didn't you?'
'Are you just choosing every boring animal on purpose, Harry?
'A bit, I suppose. It will only spread further and further as it is fatal, you see.'
When Draco had seen the dragons before, his thoughts had wandered off towards the green-eyed boy almost immediately after thinking about Fleur; he was in this Tournament unwillingly and had no-one to help. Having to face such creatures was something Harry had wanted to avoid but had now become something he
'If you could maybe tell me what it did; I would be able to help you better,' Draco said in all honesty, but Castor shook his head.
They joined them, warmed their hands after having them held up into the cold wind for almost ten minutes without lowering them once. 'Looked impressive,' Ron commented, getting an agreeing nod from Harry. Draco glanced at Hermione, holding in a laugh.
Harry hadn't told Draco nor his best friends anything about the real memory; but Draco could see by the look in his eyes that it had been something life-changing — something that would indeed change everyone's perspective on how to end the misery of Voldemort's ruling. To why he didn't want to share it; Draco had no idea.
Her warm eyes lit up even more as she accepted the present with a smile. 'I've told you before to just call me Molly, dear. Now, let's see what unnecessary gift you bought for me, shall we?' Everyone went silent as they awaited what it was Draco had gifted the ginger-haired woman. A book appeared from underneath the wrapping and was clutched to Molly's chest almost immediately, a bright smile on her face. 'Oh, Draco you know exactly what to get me, don't you?'
Perhaps a blue butterfly just couldn't be friends with a roaring lion. Perhaps all of it was a mistake like he had thought last night. Perhaps he was betraying his school greatly and Harry just wanted to make that clear; didn't want him to get into trouble because of him.
It had started to rain. Drops made loud noises against the windows, on the roof, surrounding Harry with a drowning sadness. The sound the drops made against the glass reminded him a bit of Hedwig whenever she would bring a letter to his window at the Dursley's. Draco's letters mostly. She had passed away during the attack in the night sky — catching a Death Curse that had been meant for her owner. Feeling forever grateful for her loyalty and sacrifice, Harry still thought about her daily and wished her the best afterlife an owl could possibly ask for.
'And why should I have wanted to ask him in the first place? It's not like I — like I…'
'What's wrong?' Harry asked him.
was the one that collapsed on the floor only an hour ago.
The man grabs his hands now, both his leather gloved and pale one. Draco feels his own sweat mix with Potter’s as they both sit on the floor staring into nothingness. The pain slowly drifts away and another tear leaves Draco's cheek, making him feel weak once again. Why does he always have to cry in front of Potter?
; but one's a bit distorted.'
One blink with his eyes and it seemed as if the holidays were already there. With his round suitcase and pile of books gathered in the sunroom, Draco experienced a déjà vu of the year before; violets were dancing atop of white marble again, boys were once again running and chasing behind their petals of blue. How he had detested their behavior — and how he now would do just the same if Harry was there.
He remembered the day he found this very sheet of music, somewhere hidden between the pages of a potions book he lent from the Hogwart's library. Never knowing where it came from, he played it over and over again until he mastered it. And now, years later, he places the music sheet back on it's stand, lifts up the white violin to his chin and strikes the first string with utter delicacy.
'Harry, it is not how you are alike — it is how you are not,' he heard Dumbledore say to him, but his voice sounded very vague — as if he was far away and could only be heard the slightest.
Harry returned a few moments later with two pints of yellow, foamy liquid in his hands. He set them down with a thud and fell down upon his seat the same way. He raised his pint to Draco and with a wobbly hand, Draco took ahold of his own one to cling it against Harry's. As he took a sip, he put on an expression that could tell stories; he didn't like it
Draco stopped in his pace. 'Go on then.'
An amused little smile appeared on Draco's lips. "I altered it a little, if you don't mind. Us angels are used to wearing white — other colors simply won't do."
Draco thought,
Chaos had broken loose once again, and it appeared as if only more chaos would follow in the days to come. Having just apparated away from the wedding, Harry was catching for breath as Hermione pulled both him and Ron along the streets of London. 'We must change,' she announced as she hurried them all into a little alleyway.
Malfoy's eyes find Harry's again but their expression is blank with maybe a hint of confusion. Harry must admit he's quite confused about his move as well. Is it to reassure Malfoy? Maybe it is. Or maybe it's just because he doesn't want him to leave; to be alone in this. It feels like his hand is burning a hole through Malfoy's cold, pale skin and slowly he decides to loosen his grip and take the man's hand instead. To his surprise, Malfoy's palm feels warm and
Draco had sneaked Harry back into his room so they could spend their last nights together, just sleeping side by side and feeling each other's warmth and comfort. They talked about the future, about what it would be like now that Voldemort had returned. Now that Harry couldn't come to France anymore during the summer. Draco's father was too much of a risk; if Draco would bring home Harry Potter, archenemy of the Dark Lord himself, he wouldn't even think twice before handing him over to the monster himself.
'It's a helpless cause for now,' Arthur admitted with a sigh. 'We'll try our best to fix it once the fire's out.'
And it was quiet again.
'And that you weren't alone,' André added to it. 'We thought you were still in the captive hands of
Malfoy roughly pulls his hand out of Harry's. 'I- I don't know what to say,' he replies. 'I'm a bit confused.'
With a sigh Harry turned himself to Ron in order to get a reaction from him; but all the red-head seemed to be interested in were his chocolate frogs and how fast he could eat them. 'I just wish I would stop worrying about him — but I can't.'
Draco sighed. Of course he had thought about it before, but he knew it was still a few years away and that he would have time enough to think about it. Yet, he couldn't help but always answer the same thing whenever someone asked. 'A professor,

Pibbly first stares at Harry for a very long time and then at Ron. Finally deciding that it's probably alright to let them in, she takes a step aside and bows.
, at least tell me why you're meeting with him almost every night — always on the seventh floor — always in
and I had always hoped that if he would return,
'You seem to be in a
‘Alright then, but only if you call me Molly as well. Chop chop, up the stairs with the two of you so I can cook you both some dinner.'
,' he had said.
The boy's grip was tight, and indeed terribly hurtful. It was extremely hot, as if he was pouring boiling water on his own skin. Still, Harry kept his lips tightly shut about it, and bit through the pain. The boy needed help, needed to be supported or he'd fall. "What was all that?" Harry then asked, out of breath as he tried to fight the pain he felt around his arm.
' bathroom?’ Confusion and a hint of irritation graced the boy's bodiless face as he looked directly into Draco's eyes.
. Harry spotted them at the bottom of a pile to his right. ‘Come on!’ he shouted, pulling Draco along by his thin wrist. They escaped the fire just in time as they snatched the first broom they saw, swung their legs over the wood and flew off towards the ceiling — the only place safe from the sea of orange.
He couldn't tell Harry what he had to do as a spell was casted upon him that would kill him instantly must he spill any of the secret mission to anyone other than the Dark Lord himself. Even his mother would form a threat must he start talking to her about it. Afraid, Draco even was, to think about it in the presence of others — afraid it would kill him as well and leave him on the cold floor as a heap of misery.
Dumbledore's slight smile disappeared as he opened a drawer of his desk and placed a shattered ring on top of it. 'This,' he started. 'Is the cause of the curse. My temptation had challenged me and had won; making me put on this ring and curse myself.' Draco hesitantly picked up the ring and studied it from a bit closer. There wasn't anything special noticeable about it; besides from the fact that there had been a symbol on the front which was now destroyed by whatever had destroyed the ring. 'It is one of many, I believe,' Dumbledore then said. 'But that's something for Harry to find out.'
As a feeling of panic rose through Harry's body at losing his wand — at standing face-to-face with Voldemort without being able to defend himself — a fireplace to his left suddenly burned brightly. Green flames were sent from their ashes and within them appeared the two tall figures of professor Dumbledore and Draco — their faces blank but with a look of determination and fury in their eyes. 'D-Draco?' Harry stammered, his eyes the size of oranges as he stared at his lover in disbelief.
Draco didn't even bother to take out his timepiece and check the time; he didn't care about it anymore. His mind was too occupied, his eyes too hazed of anger to look at a small clock. Harry stayed underwater for what seemed like hours, but couldn’t have been longer than a few minutes. As his head appeared out of the water, he seemed utterly frustrated.
Then what
,' Ron told him. 'You're the only way of stopping him.' Harry couldn't help but agree; he was indeed the Chosen One and therefore felt like it was all his fault. Felt like all the burdens of the Wizarding World were his to carry — but was that truly the case? Was he truly alone in this? Dropping his backpack to the grasses underneath his feet, Harry took a deep breath. Maybe Ron was right. 'And were you really going to find those horcruxes all by yourself? Without me; maybe — but without Hermione… you wouldn't survive a day, would you?'
‘Important enough to wake up a girl from her precious beauty sleep at an hour this late?’
Draco now was the one to laugh and turned his head to look into Harry's eyes; to capture their smile. With one of his long fingers he wiped away some dirt that was still stuck to the boy's face; a reminder of a battle they had fought only a few hours ago. But even though the thoughts of evil and danger started circulating through his head again; he couldn't help but feel happy and glad to have Harry by his side again — to be able to lay down on his cloud-like bed and have the only person he truly loved next to him. '
'They were here for me.
'Then you're way too close, Harry,' Draco replied with a cheeky smile. 'But we're not at Hogwarts right now, are we? I'm not even a Hogwarts student.'
"Daddy,' Dudley, started, 'Harry was being
Draco had seen Harry at breakfast the next morning and the boy had been staring in his direction almost the entire time. As much as Draco wanted to return the stare, he knew he couldn't. He knew that if he would; he wouldn't be able to look away again. He felt like an idiot, ignoring the boy so heartlessly like that, but he didn't know what else to do. He couldn't have him distract him any longer; he couldn't betray his school again.
peaceful. He felt a hand on his shoulder, looked into the face of Hermione Granger. She was crying. And he couldn’t help but cry as well. Finally giving in to the tears that had wanted to escape already so many times.
for wanting to join the Tournament on purpose — the dragons had scared them all and had made them realize Harry would've never looked for such adventure himself. They all knew his past, and Draco’d also heard about what happened during Harry's prior years at Hogwarts from wandering gossip.
A dungeon. The smell of mold, the dripping of a leak. Dust covered the once blue tiles a dirty grey and there wasn't a single light lit in the darkness of the cellar. But there was something that made their hearts flicker with hope; the voice of someone they knew. Luna Lovegood appeared out of the dark and as Ron lit up the single torch, her face smiled at them.
Lucius Malfoy sighed deeply. 'Has Dumbledore truly told you nothing?'
, our glass-stained friend, is a Siren. A beautiful mermaid to explain it in a simple way. But
'Do you think another horcrux is at Hogwarts?' Draco speculated, seeing the same wonder in Hermione's eyes.
'I—' Harry started but Draco hushed him, his index finger pressed against Harry's slightly bruised lips.
, Draco thought.
'I should've gone with you,' Ron then admitted, and everyone grew quiet again. Draco looked from Ron to Hermione; to catch her reaction to his words. All he saw was that she was getting as red as a tomato, slowly hiding herself behind her curly hair.
His eyes fell upon Arthur Weasley, a ginger-haired father who looked as if beaten to near-dead. He was seated in a wheel-chair, his head wrapped in bandages and his face the color of every existing galaxy. 'W-what happened to you, sir?' Draco stammered, a bit hesitant. Everyone held their breath as they looked from Draco to Arthur, who's colored face now added the color of an explosion; a bright red.
For a second Draco was worried Harry would become upset or even hurt by his best friend's words, but he wasn't. His expression stayed the same; blank but with furious eyes. ‘And what’s wrong with that? If I want to go with Draco then that’s my decision, isn’t it? Dean and Seamus also went together.’ The mentioned pair of boys were dancing only a few feet away from them. Their foreheads rested against each other as they held the other in a tight embrace. If that wasn't love, Draco wasn't sure what the limits to a bromance were.
'You know I don't,' Draco reminded him, throwing him a meaningful look. Casting a drying charm on himself while following the others, he couldn't help but cast them dry as well. The magical warm wind made their cheeks flush, and Hermione threw Draco a small smile over her shoulder.
A cheeky little game of telling lies he had had to play to be able to join Harry for the holidays. He had told his parents he would be staying at Beauxbatons; too much homework and special festivities were keeping him there and would make him unable to go home. Madame Maxime, on the other hand, he had told that he would go home; celebrate Christmas with his beloved family before the days were going to turn dark again. She hadn't understood his decision, but had guessed it was for his mother and therefore hadn't asked any further about it.
As if his mind got read, a snowy owl appears at his window. Yellow eyes glowing and staring directly at Harry with great urgency. Confused, Harry opens the window for the white creature and searches for an owl treat in one of his desk's drawers.
His best friend now hurries over to his side of the cubicle, leaning against his desk. 'So, you do remember how we put away all of the left-over Death Eaters a few years ago, right?' He asks.
of my past, that is.'
kill him, Draco. Snape did. He did it in your place.' Two warm hands took ahold of his arms, as if to make sure Draco would believe him even though he already did.
Alright, perhaps Harry had only meant the stupid clothes he was wearing right there and then, but that didn't mean he could backfire Draco's own snide comments on his boyfriend's casual wear that easily. '
'You know exactly what I mean — the sneaking out of the dormitory at night without telling me,' he explained, fury slowly boiling up to the surface and making its appearance in his voice. 'Give me a reason for that, will you?'
Draco frowned his eyebrows at the headmaster's words. 'R-realize a few things?' He stammered, confused. 'That you — that you loved—‘
! Such great power!”
, at least," the boy explained, glancing at his reflection in the closet's mirror for a quick second before quickly casting his eyes away again — as if looking at himself burned him up from within.
'Harry! Why did you do that for?'

This was quite a hard chapter to write as it's an -- in between -- chapter before the final task! I just wanted to write something a bit cute and light-hearted but still interesting enough! Hope you enjoy it and get ready for the next chapter because it's going to be quite the thing *hint* prepare yourselves.
Draco rolled his eyes and snuck his arms around Harry's middle, his tall figure towering behind him as Harry glanced at their reflection in the mirror. ‘A fine that makes me want to take it off again?' A kiss got pressed in the crook of his neck while Draco's arms wrapped around him even tighter.
The way they glared into each other's eyes could make lightning erupt from it, set the whole room on fire. Harry had never seen something quite like it before; not even when he was defending his friends from that blond Slytherin at school or when he saw teachers in a heated conversation. Perhaps it was a Pureblood thing; and the Malfoys and Weasleys were known to be quite the opposite. 'Stop it,' Hermione interrupted. 'Especially you, Ron.'
‘You’re wrong!’ Was all Draco managed to get out. They were on the wrong side. They had and always would be.
Draco thought to himself, once again proud. He watched as the boy gave the painting a confused stare, hung it straight again and put his glasses back on, forgetting about the incident as if it had never happened.
to be in Gryffindor!'
Madame Maxime appeared from around the corner, giving Draco a simple sign with her hand. Quickly Draco positioned the girls to where they had to be, encouraging them as he went. He joined Madame by her side and watched the grand doors open up to the Great Hall. A ceiling enchanted to mimic a night sky, floating candles and many eyes casted upon them. Full of confidence the girls made their way through the Hall, making butterflies appear out of nowhere and throwing enchanting glances at the boys seated nearby. Fleur's sister Grabrielle followed them with a few flexible moves, showing the students of Hogwarts the other talents the students of Beauxbatons possessed.
First, the links for my lovely betas, as they deserve all the attention and credit I can give them for getting me through this.
Healer Edwards chuckled, “Essentially yes, but it’s more than that. Yes, they will protect your eyes from the sun, but you will also be able to see perfectly in the dark as well.”
Severus Snape was sitting in his office, drowning his bitterness in firewhisky, when he heard a knock at the door. He promptly ignored it as he poured himself another glass. After another minute or two, the person outside knocked again, this time louder, as though agitated. As though he cared.
"Would you like to know what they mean?"
Surprised that Draco had picked up on exactly what Harry was afraid of, he asked, “Why does it matter who he is?”
sides?"
? He basically towered above Fleur's presence right there and then; staring down at her tiny figure in confusion.
His eyes search for something else to lay upon, but all they see is Potter, Potter,
Telling the girls to go ahead of him, that he would catch up later, he let himself fall down at the bottom of the stairs. He watched the rain fall slowly outside the entrance's doors, the drops falling down faster and harder by the second. Water bubbles hitting stone; coloring the ground a shade darker than usual. In only a few minutes the faint drizzle had become the downpour it had been a few weeks ago. He watched it in silence as he thought of what plan Fleur might have come up with. Whatever it was; Draco wouldn't be a part of it. Of course Fleur wanted him by her side before and after every task, she had made that clear even before she became a Champion — but Draco had thought and hoped he would
… Let's see what rooms Madame has provided you with so we can all fresh ourselves up a little bit. Maybe get some rest — I believe your headmaster won't be returning any time soon.'

The face of Dolores Umbridge had reached the brightest shade of red, making her the exact resemblance of a rotten tomato, but the color suddenly seemed to drain away as she raised her chin and folded her handkerchief again. Tucking it away in her pink cloak's pocket she glanced at the man once more before giving two men at the bar a wordless sign. Muscular men in black cloaks left their seats immediately and made their way to Cuffe, Draco and Harry having to jump away from the table not to be run into to — to get discovered. The men lifted Cuffe from his seat with no effort at all, his hood sliding off his head and revealing the face of a tired, middle-aged man. 'Take mister Cuffe to the Ministiry; he has been arrested for speculating the return of
'An idea?'
Dumbledore let out a sigh; one almost completely soundless but definitely there. 'I know, my boy. I know. And you'll hurt Harry with that fact, I know that as well. But listen,' the headmaster now rose from his seat and moved to Draco's side, seated himself on the other chair where Harry had once been seated as well. 'He'll eventually understand.'
Staring from her to Harry, Draco felt a little hopeless of what to do. As Harry twisted and turned on the forest' ground, he suddenly stopped moving as if passed out. 'Harry? Harry!' Draco shouted, shaking the boy's body with a fastened heartbeat.
New words were formed, but they were too vague for Draco to hear nor understand. He closed his eyes for a second, and when he opened them again he saw a snake pass by his figure. A kind of hue appeared in his view as if he was focusing on something through a vizor. He heard the snake hiss like the horcruxes had done, and it suddenly hit him that it had to be the snake. The snake was another horcrux.
Without a word said, Draco followed Castor inside and hoped Harry would do the same. He did indeed as he felt a soft brush of a hand, or maybe just the cloak's fabric, brush his arm. Having been inside many times before; Draco wasn't amazed anymore to see the many interesting objects around him, hear a wireless play the same tune over and over again or see some weird creatures fly underneath the ceiling — their wings fluttering their last bit of life before falling down onto the many objects. He knew Harry was looking around in awe, though; probably too curious to know what every little thing was. But Draco followed Castor straight to the tall, dark object that was the cabinet they had been working on for weeks now.
; this was the complete opposite. Dark walls and wood everywhere Draco's eyes looked. He was glad to have Harry by his side, knowing that if he were alone, he would simply have died at the spot out of embarrassment. Some people just didn't fit in no matter what, and Draco in an environment like that of the Three Broomsticks, was one of them.
“Keep calm, Potter,” he replies quickly. Keeping his eyes in Malfoy’s, he watches how the blond makes a tea tray appear on the table between them, all with a simple swish and flick of his mother’s wand. Satisfied with his ability to produce beverages, he tucks the wand away in his sleeve. “I'm not trying to hex you.'”
Draco lifted his gaze again, and this time his eyes were a bright white again — like the first time Harry'd seen them. Immediately the overwhelming feeling washed over him once more; intensely and entirely different than before. He could
As Harry's vision slowly returned, the dark spots of a blinding spell slowly fading away, he looked up into the face of a man whose skin was covered in a striped pattern of blood. He was circling around his prey, glancing from one to the other. 'So… who do we have here?'

— out there. And then, during those nights while he had those thoughts, it often felt like those thoughts were right, and a presence other than himself was close to him.
'I-I don't know, that's why I was thinking about it,' Harry replies. Maybe he should've answered something differently? What if he had said they were friends or- or what? What were they, anyway?
Once again, Draco shook his head. '
. The feelings were so overwhelming that he forgot who he was, what he was doing, how to
Draco bites his bottom lip, grabbing his button-down from the floor and pulling it on again. No need for him to keep sitting there, exposing himself to a helpless Auror that won't be able to help him anyway. An iron tastes spreads throughout his mouth, suddenly realizing that he's biting on his lip way too hard. Hands stop moving from his buttons and he looks back at Potter with tears welling up in his eyes, yet once again.

'Something else should be fine as well,' Castor said while glancing around. His eyes then fell upon
Voldemort sneered at Dumbledore's words. Eyed the old man from head to toe as if he was disappointed in his opponent. 'By then I will be gone — and you'll be dead,' was his answer. Without giving Dumbledore another second to think about those words, his white wand casted a spell at the headmaster, Dumbledore immediately firing one back and defending both himself as Draco beside him.
Harry seemed to be lost for words as he kept his eyes on Draco, eyes that Draco didn't want to see anymore. He had to leave, had to get away and turned around, ready to run away from the boy. But he got snatched by his arm, pulled back by Harry's immense force. 'Please, Draco! I'm sorry, I—'

Draco's eyes took in his fellow students once more; a thing he liked to do whenever he felt bored. His friends were sitting around him, dressed in shades of pastel blue. Their hair always so flawless, eyes bright and shiny. But they could try as much as they wanted; Draco always thought
'Don't you know something else? Perhaps a spell or a certain technique?'
Three days passed and Kreacher was still gone; no sign of him at all during the day nor night. It seemed as if his search for Mundungus Fletcher was more difficult than Harry had thought it would be. The man was probably hiding; trying to sell the precious and valuable items of the Black-family in dark alleys to dark Wizards and Witches. Though, it wasn't as if they had nothing else to do; they still had other horcruxes to find beside the locket. Therefore they were once again gathered around a table, this time the long dining table with some of Hermione's books spread open on top of it. They had discussed possible locations and possible objects, but nothing seemed quite right. As they once again discussed the possibility of visiting Wool's Orphanage — where Voldemort had grown up — they suddenly heard a loud bang in the kitchen followed by shouting and the noise of a struggle.
to think something else than Malfoy’s intending.
and that had already been enough to make the girls giggle. His French accent was what made many of the Hogwarts' girls' hearts melt, apparently. The boys that approached him all had to get pushed in his direction by a friend or stopped in front of him to then take off as quickly as they came.
. The opposite of before.

most importantly; overseeing the girls.
But Harry shook his head, already bolting upright with the little energy he had. Almost falling down again, Draco quickly sat beside him and let him lean against his shoulder. 'Calm down a bit,' he told the boy.
Harry's eyes are still focused on the door's art when someone pulls it open from the inside. Unlike last time, it's Malfoy himself who opens the door. On his face isn't the normal scowl as usual, but an expression as if someone just died — the vision of a fading soul still visible in his eyes. It wasn't exactly the mirror of Harry's small smile that he put on as the door swung open, expecting a welcoming house-elf to greet him like last time.
.' With closed eyes Harry chuckled of embarrassment. He lifted his head to lay it down on Draco's chest, ignoring the headache that was probably beating its way out of his skull. Normally Draco would have made a comment on getting blood on his cashmere jumper but it didn't matter at that moment; Harry had just saved his life in
'Who — who's going to destroy the cup?' Ron then asked in a stammering way — in a fearful way. His voice screamed that he didn't want to be the one, and with an irritated sigh Draco saw how Hermione snatched it from the ground.
Straightening his red and golden tie, he lifted his chin a little -- something he noticed he hadn't done ever since leaving Beauxbatons. Perhaps he was indeed becoming
Draco had returned.
The Fat Lady turned herself fully towards Draco again, frowning at his name. 'I believe I've heard that name before. Are there any Gryffindors in your family?'
Now he was making his way to the seventh floor again, meeting Castor in the left corner and awaiting the completion of his task. He was afraid, of course — scared to the bone at what was about to happen. They were almost identically dressed; Castor in his black suit he wore all the time and Draco's in the darkest pieces of clothing he owned. With his golden wand at hand, he sneaked into the Room of Requirement with Castor on his heels — the two of them immediately walking over to the Vanishing Cabinet which was making strange sounds. 'Is that — is that normal?' Draco asked, glancing at Castor beside him.
"I think that's a bad idea, Mother. Besides, I don't believe any of my old friends want anything to do with me anymore. You shouldn't worry so much about me either," Draco says, trying to smile but only managing to get something similar to a grimace.
'Everything for

side, Harry!'
Harry's smile widened because of that and as he opened his mouth to say something else, Draco felt a hand being placed on his shoulder. As he looked to his left, he stared straight into the enchanting eyes of Fleur. 'Who are you talking to, Draco?' she asked him in French.
'Yes, because I thought you did it at first. I mean — not

style, with golden buttons and a high neck. It reminds Draco a bit of the Durmstrang uniforms minus all the fur. It's not an awful sight; more an interesting one as the sleeves are too long for Potter yet the clothes fit too tight around his chest.
'There is something here,' Castor managed to get out. 'Perhaps we should leave for the night if it wishes to be alone.'
Harry gave him a weird look, as if Draco had said something absurd. 'Alright!' he then called out, way too loud for Harry's normal doing. He then kissed Draco's hand — something he had never done before — and left the common room. Looking over his shoulder at Hermione and Ron, Draco could see they were just as confused and worried about Harry as he was.
"With pleasure."
So she all of the sudden wanted to work together in helping Harry?
'I-I'm not sure either if I would be an ideal father. I never really had a father myself and sometimes when I babysit Teddy I feel like I say '

… unheard of.'
'I am fine,
Draco's sitting on his bed now, back against a heap of pillows and many books spread over his sheets. After yet another day of research through many dark books of the Malfoy library, he feels utterly exhausted. Pibbly brought him some hot chocolate; almost as an encouragement to something she doesn't know anything about. The hot chocolate is nothing compared to the one he used to drink at Hogwarts; but it's good enough. It fills his cold body and soul with warmth, making him feel ready to just push a little further in his search.
But Potter doesn't look away, keeps staring at Draco's arm instead like he's been hypnotized. Having enough of it, Draco pulls his arm away and hides it beneath his robes. Only then Potter gets snapped back to reality and blinks a few times with his eyes. “No,' he says, almost unsure, 'nothing seems wrong with his arm…
Draco had almost tripped over Cedric's father's collapsed body on his way to Harry, a knife going through his heart at the sight. He had never seen Harry like that before; so sad, so

'I don't know wether it's the locket, Hermione,' Harry admitted. 'Maybe they've just brainwashed him at the Manor or something — is there a spell for brainwashing a Wizard?'
'It's so- so big!' He called out, facing Draco for the first time since they'd entered. His eyes looked away almost immediately again to take a better look at the depicted mermaid as she wove her hand at him. 'Can you use this bathroom every day?'
Harry grinned. 'Then what name do you want me to use?
The dark prison rises up in front of them as a sharp, black rock. It must've been an even more horrible place to visit when the Dementors still guarded the place, Harry then thinks to himself, still feeling the terror and despair of haunted visitors and prisoners in his bones.
Draco lifted his shoulder slightly. “Nothing, really. Guard my Mortal. Guard

to accidentally open a letter written by Harry Potter.

. 'Not one letter,' he decided to spit out right away. 'You haven't replied to any of my letters nor sent me one yourselves.'
The jailer nods. ”Died only a few hours ago, that piece of dark wizard. That Unspeakable already arrived only a few minutes after we reported it to the Ministry. Took the body with him immediately and everything. Seemed scared, the fellow.”
Shouts and screams of excitement left angels' their lips. A few cried once again — happy cries this time that resounded through the open area. Some took others into an embrace, thanked their God with whispered prayers on their lips. However, everyone grew quiet once more when a voice asked; "Who shall protect the baby?"
Harry swallowed and nodded. Of course he saw Draco, but Draco hadn't seen him. No, Harry had been well hidden away from his eyes underneath his invisibility cloak. And did he even care to tell Draco about that earlier? N
With a single flick of her wand, Molly's presents flew over everyone's head and landed in front of their new owners without a sound. Eagerly wanting to open their presents, the Weasley children stared up at their mother, waiting for a sign. As soon as Molly nodded her head, wrapping paper got torn and flew through the air, landing on the ground, table and even Draco's shoulder. Colorful jumpers appeared with personalized designs and everyone immediately pulled them on over their clothes, showed them off to the person next to them. Harry got one with golden snitches in a blue color; almost as if the snitches were flying in a sky made out of wool. Arthur was the only one to receive a scarf instead of a jumper, and Molly wrapped it around his neck with much delicacy before kissing her husband on the head.
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
Curious about what it could be, he unwraps the package as fast as he can. A downsized book appears within, staring at Draco and eagerly waiting for him to enlarge it again. A quick run to his nightstand and back for his wand, followed by a whispered '
Trying out the same password he had heard two years ago, Draco was surprised to have the stairs turn upwards for him and bring him to the headmaster's chambers. A single knock on brown wood was enough for it to open already; to open its door to a deserted office. Dumbledore was nowhere to be seen but a blue, dazzling light shined brightly from the corner of Draco's eye. His feet dragged him towards it and he quickly recognized the shining liquid as the memories contained in a pensieve.
He got dragged over a fern green carpet that ran through the entire entryway, and was pushed to the floor in a large room, a chandelier shining above his head and a fireplace burning bright. He hit the black tiled floor and tasted blood, the taste of iron spreading fast. Hermione and Ron soon followed by his side, and before he even had a chance to get up, Bellatrix Lestrange pulled him by his collar herself. Her long nails pinched the flesh of the back of his neck, a wand pressed against his throat. Harry could see the chandelier above their heads reflect in her pitch black eyes — eyes of the insane.
‘Because it’s another thing that you dislike?’
Thank you so much for the lovely comments on my first chapter and all the kudos! It really made me excited to already write a second chapter today. A third might be up as well at the end of this week but we'll see!
A weight; fallen off his shoulders but stuck in his stomach now. A part of his task might be taken away but he had Dumbledore's cursed self to worry about now. Another lie added to the bunch; another thing he wouldn't be able to tell Harry about. But Dumbledore had said he had his own task for Harry; would soon tell him about it and maybe tell Draco about it as well. Would that help with taking more weight and worries away? Would it be able to set things right again and destroy the Dark Lord for good? Defeat him?
side. An image of Draco locked up in his room with tears running down his face came up in front of his eyes; him being unable to defend himself against his own blood.
‘Nothing,’ Harry answered. Draco reached out a hand to Harry, helped him stand again with a raised heartbeat of his own. Castor could help himself — and sod off to wherever he wanted to.
'But Harry—,' Hermione started, catching up with Harry's quick pace and running by his side. 'What if Voldemort wanted you to see that? What if it's a trick?'
'Wait—' André started. 'Since when have you been back? You came back earlier than today?' Draco nodded to his words, totally forgetting to tell the twins that he had returned to their school already a week ago. 'Why didn't you tell us?'
'It's not your fault. Probably some spell Voldemort hid away in the curse somewhere; reacting to any counter spell cast upon it.'
Harry was invited over to celebrate the holidays at the Weasley's, and Draco to his grand surprise as well. 'I want you to bring that cute boy of yours, Harry,' Molly had written to him in a letter. 'No matter what my dear Arthur thinks of him. No-one deserves to be alone during the most cheerful time of the year.'
'Draco,' he panted — suddenly feeling exhausted after having a vision in broth daylight. 'He's in danger!' Harry crawled up to his feet again with the help of his friends, his heart beating in his throat as he kept on seeing Draco's lifeless body upon that dark tiled floor. 'I saw him through
'Just like I could use one as well,' Harry then said. The boy had slowly come closer to Draco again and Draco could feel the touch of his fingers against his own. His cheeks felt hot and he looked away, probably blushing, as Harry's hand slowly found his again.
Following the man into a deserted classroom nearby, Draco seated himself on one of the wooden chairs. The headmaster himself leaned against the desk at the front, observing a skeleton of a bird that was placed upon it. 'Has it to do—,' Draco started.
Draco swallowed out of embarrassment and seated himself on the leather chair on the other side. 'I didn't mean to see something so personal,
Knees with green grass stains, his hair a disheveled mess, little pieces of hedge stuck to his jumper and an exhausted look upon his face were enough to make the twins worry Draco had been exchanged by someone else during those two short weeks. '
Draco nodded. '
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
'I must go now, mister Malfoy. Please say some soothing words to Harry and I'll be back before you now.' With those words said, the Headmaster of Hogwarts left the tent, leaving Draco alone with Harry.
Mundungus swallowed and took a deep breath. Hands were shaking as he wiped away a drop of sweat from his bald head. 'Lestrange,' he answered. 'Bellatrix Lestrange.'
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
When he reached the surface, applause broke free around him and he felt the gills and webbing between his fingers and toes slowly fade away. He smiled brightly because of the cheers and looked over at Draco whom had awoken from his sleep. He was splashing into the water with his arms as if he couldn't swim; making a fool out of himself. An irritated expression graced his face and long strands of hair were sticking to his forehead and cheeks. '
'I know, but— it's the reason why you're here and not in France and—‘
On December the second he saw the boy wake with an equally pride feeling inside of him. Harry'd dreamt of angels, Draco recalled as he watched how the boy struggled to get up and seemed to try and remember what it was he'd dreamt about.
'You should use a different name to sign them, though. I don't want
A shiver runs down Draco’s spine at the though, leaving his body feeling cold.
Draco stopped kissing him to look into his hazy eyes. 'That's really nice of her, reminds me of someone I know. Got any more presents?'
A smile on Harry's lips followed as the boy realized the stupidity of his question. 'Anyway; maybe we can find something about him in one of the books here?'
. What if I do anything wrong and I get possessed by it again?' Worry was readable in his eyes, a worry Harry apparently saw as well.
Potter hadn't dated anyone in the last 4 years, causing him to feel utterly alone and haunted with front pages of the Prophet and Witch Weekly discussing his non-existent love life.
, he thought as he held onto Harry's rough hands with all the power he had left.
Harry sighs. “You have to trust someone.” Malfoy nods, but his eyes show him an uncertainty still. Harry could almost hear an inner battle going on in his head; should he trust Harry, his enemy? His opposite? But, didn't Malfoy already trust Harry with his life? “The fact that I saw your arm last week, your
snake — how he was left alone at the Ministry to die.'
'You couldn't have known that,' Draco replied.
, you can do better than that.'
'Was thinking about it,' Harry mumbled as a reply. They continued their walk to the pier, Harry's stomach growling with nerves. 'What's that in your hands?'
"Wake up, you sleepyhead!" The boy shot up straight, suddenly woken from that chaotic dream and entering that of reality. "
, he can't put her through that again.
Morning again, this time daylight shining in through the windows, bathing the dark room in warmer tones. Draco had always disliked this room because of how lonely and sad it felt. It was simply too large for a boy alone, and everything smelled old and of the past. Was it the palette of grey they had used? Or the portraits of ancestors he hadn't been allowed to move from his walls? Now he was forced to stay inside until someone would allow him to leave; a nightmare he once would've had now come true. The knob of his door turned, revealing his mother — with to Draco's surprise — his father by her side as well. Trying to stay calm to prevent his scars from hurting, Draco let out short breaths through his nose to suppress his anger at seeing the man. Since when had he returned from Azkaban? 'Draco,' he started while seating himself on the edge of the boy's bed. 'We are so extremely proud of you.'
Draco's cheeks blushed at the thought of a professor seeing every little thing, every little moment they had shared together. An awkward feeling boiled up in his stomach as he looked away from Harry's green eyes. 'That's rather — personal,' he commented. 'But it's good for you to learn it; especially if
Ron gave him a weird look at the French word, which made both Harry as Hermione laugh as they probably knew its translation, and then blinked a few times with his eyes. 'That's the past,' he then said. 'I have come to the understanding that you're not like your father.'
'The Half-Blood prince, indeed. But it is not really the time to discuss that matter now — you must hide before the others find you,' Snape told him.
Even though he often wished he had had a family to go to like most students, the Holidays were always quite the sight at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and he’d always loved spending Christmas there. And
, and too much of a laugh.'
With their eyes and hands locked again, Harry doesn't know what to think anymore. Malfoy is so close, his warmth radiating through his palms. It makes him feel uncomfortable yet comfortable too; it's quite confusing, really. 'N-No,' he manages to get out. It sounds like a lie, and judging by Malfoy's sneer he knows it's one too.
is the whole reason why we're here,’ Draco replied as he turned his back to Harry and faced the bathroom door. '
Hope you like this chapter! I decided to leave the Umbridge part and whatnot away but I promise she will make another, different, appearance in the next chapter *hint*.
Everyone still seemed extremely wary around Draco as they went down for breakfast the next morning. It had been the fist night that Draco had slept for longer than an hour, and his body and mind were thanking him greatly. With his hand locked in Harry's as if to catch up on lost time, they met the curious and doubtful eyes of their friends. Ron looked at him with a strange look in his eyes Draco found hard to decipher while Hermione didn't even dare to look at him at all. Bill seemed to back away a little at the mere sight of him, his hand protectively on Fleur's arm. 'It's alright everyone,' Harry explained, clearing the heavy air and presenting Salazar's locket in the palm of his hand. He hadn't let go of it since the day before; had kept it in his trousers' pocket the entire time.
A deep sigh followed as Harry tried to take Draco's hand again. 'I didn't mean it like that; just the clothes that you're wearing right now, that's all. Do I get offended so easily when you call me names?'
'Because, I want everyone to see how beautiful you are, and with that I mean
, Draco reminded himself as he stared out the window.
As all the girls were rejoined with their dates, Draco led Fleur towards hers.
They had another horcrux; Salazar's medallion now safely in Harry's pocket. To why Dumbledore had trusted him with keeping it safe, Harry had no idea. Something was wrong, Harry knew, as Dumbledore had already been acting very strange the entire evening. It was almost as if he was only caring about Harry's life — as if his own was worth nothing anymore and could fade any second now. He had also lost a lot of his energy by drinking the strange water, to obtain the horcrux, but they still had been able to disapparate back to Hogwarts. Back on top of the Astronomy Tower, with the view of Scottish landscapes surrounding them — covered by blankets of the night — Dumbledore placed a hand atop of Harry's shoulder. 'You must leave now, Harry,' he said to him.
?' Harry had lowered his voice a little, the anger slowly disappearing from it, Draco could hear.
Desperate, Harry took ahold of Draco's arm, as if to show he wouldn't let go of the boy so easily. A glare of eyes followed as Snape pushed him aside, Harry immediately losing his grip on the boy and stumbling backwards. 'I must return him to the Dark Lord, Potter. It is the only way.'
, that would've been another word to describe him as well — with his skin as if made out of porcelain, no blemish to be seen. With eyes that appeared white, yet became a pale grey the longer Harry remained locked with them.
And it wasn't as if Draco needed anything else from what he had in his room; his wand, books, food and water that one of the house-elves frequently brought up. Until the first of September was nearing -- only one single day away.
Draco closed his eyes for a moment, then opened them again at the sound of something he recognized — at the sound of parseltongue. Grey eyes searched for where it came from, and found it clenched in Harry's hand.

He dressed himself in the school's uniform, proudly showing off the golden crest of Beauxbatons stitched upon his heart. His hand automatically reached out for one of his hats, but he drew it back and decided he wasn't feeling like wearing one today. Throwing another glance outside his window, looking at Beauxbatons' Quidditch Pitch in the far background, he decided it might be a good day to fly and let that strong autumn's wind blow through his hair.
During the first night of December, Draco had a nightmare about the second task. They had decided to use the Bubble-Head charm anyway, no matter the failures of their try-outs. Harry had cast it on himself before he had jumped into the Lake, the other three contestants jumping by his side as well. Draco stood frozen on the edge of the pier, his golden timepiece in hand as he watched the water's surface slowly turn to calmness again.
'But how do I stop him from killing me? How's giving him an opportunity to hurt me going to help to take the locket away?' He had already been alone with Draco the night before, but it had seemed as if the locket had waited for him to fall asleep before devouring its prey. It had seemed as if it had been waiting for Harry to come even closer to him, to trust him. But Harry didn't trust this new Draco at all — the Draco that was possessed by a part of Voldemort's soul. He had to destroy it, as he simply had gotten lucky last night, but doubted if it would be the same for the one to follow.
But fortunately that moment never came. Draco was safe…
Draco sighs, not willing to give in. Just thinking about all the stared he'd get alone makes him shiver. "Why would you want to go to Diagon Alley anyway? We already own every book worth purchasing from Flourish and Blotts, we don't need new robes from Madam Malkin's because we're not attending any festivities and-"
made the Dark Lord do,' he spat, showing teeth and making the fire in his eyes burn even brighter. Castor clenched his jaw out of anger, slowly turning red as his complexion was no match to the emotion. 'Thanks to you I've been neglected as a Death Eater. My father was furious. If the Dark Lord hadn't punished me, I'm sure he would've!'
'Draco!' Some of them called out. '
better than the Wizards he was facing. Harry didn't feel intimidated at all but could definitely feel what it was like to the boys next to him. He, on the other hand, just found it extremely attractive. And it most definitely was turning him on.
Draco folded Harry's letter again and hid it away in his desk's drawer. With a simple spell the drawer got locked; only opening to the touch of his very hand. He looked over his shoulder, glanced through the window to see the morning sky clear itself from orange sunlight. How much he loved being in his room at Beauxbatons again; at being away from that cold Manor. Everything here was rich and warm, made of gold and white. Blue accents were hidden everywhere; as little flowers on his wardrobe or the tiniest curls decorating his door. At night he could land in a heaven made of silk, stare at a ceiling painted like the night's sky. Hogwarts had been wonderful, but Beauxbatons was just mesmerizing.
'Don't touch anything!' was Hermione's reaction immediately, but not even a second later Harry touched a candle holder with his foot; multiplying it as well.
A sea of white; cold and blinding Harry as he surrounded himself with it. Green eyes blinked, feet dragged themselves through a thick layer of snow. The sound of a passing car, driving slower than usual. Harry lifted his gaze, trying to adjust himself to the landscape around him.
, Harry — to have a better future for all of us.'
,' Raphael answered him with a smile.
An overload of crimson awaited Draco as he entered the Gryffindor common room, his hand in Harry's and his best friends lingering behind them. The picture of Harry flying on a broom he had seen two years ago greeted him again with a smile and Draco felt at least a little at home. Students who hadn't seen him in potions or in the hallway gave him a strange look; questioning what a blond boy in blue was doing in their common room. Not daring to look into their eyes; afraid to see the hate they felt for both him as his father, Draco looked at his feet as he immediately took the stairs to the boy's dormitory.

'It's — it's okay, Draco,' the boy told him, green eyes blinking a few times before he sat up straight again. 'You told me to stop and yet I- I touched you like that. I'm the one that should be sorry because of it.'
. 'Really?'
?" Harry now nodded, to which Draco slowly nodded as well. "They are in Heaven for already sixteen years — since the day your parents passed away. Both of them decided to give up their guardian job, instead they wander the streets of silver doing other things."
There hasn't been a sign of Malfoy since his trial, not a word nor a newspaper article. It's almost like he completely disappeared from the world, hiding away somewhere in the Draco constellation. But who knows, maybe he's happier between the stars.

The monster they had feared for so many years had finally been defeated. Tom Riddle and whatever had been left of him was gone — for forever. A quiet sort of feeling overcame the boys as they stood there; their eyes casted at the remainder of ashes that once held such powerful, strong magic. Harry still had Draco’s wand clenched in his hand; the wood looking even more worn off then before. He definitely would have to get it fixed, or simply purchase a new one.

two-hundred years of their existence as an angel!"
Harry smiled weakly again. 'At least Hedwig won't have to fly such long distances to deliver a letter to you then.' Draco grinned at his words and kissed the boy on his cheek.
. Only during the early morning hours he retreated outside, caught a glimpse of white hair as his mother took care of her roses, taking in the morning dew on their petals. Not many words were exchanged between the two during the day, not even in the morning when they both spent their time in the garden. Sometimes, when his mother felt lonely or grieved Draco's father, she could ramble for hours on end. Draco would nod at her words, but not hear them.
‘So many words—,’ Voldemort turned around again, pulling his hand back. ‘—said in an unwanted language.’
Harry sighed deeply.
As the dragon lost height, the lake came nearer — seemed to grow in size and sparkle more brightly at them. 'Now!' Hermione shouted, and immediately she and Ron let themselves fall off the large creature. A sudden panic overcame the blond as he watched his friends fall. He felt frozen; by the cold, the dragon and the nearing fall.
. Beauxbatons is like a second home to me so I wouldn't mind spending the rest of my life there.'
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
While Draco's still observing his black arm in the light of his previously cast 'lumos', a loud crack resounds through his room followed by the small hunched body of Pibbly, the house elf. She's the only elf his Mother decided to keep after the War; too worried the poor thing would languish away once being abandoned by her owners. Besides; neither Mother nor Draco knew how to cook or take care of a Manor.
. They did however have a suspicion about Hermione and Ron, and a faint mark on his forehead that could be seen as a scar.
Thinking back about the fiendfyre is painful; watching one of his friends die because of the fool's own spell was something he never expected in a million years to happen. Having himself saved from that fire also was something that was on his 'not-happening' list. Yet it

It was the 2nd of September and early in the morning; before six and a deserted castle greeted Draco with rays of morning sunshine. But all Draco could see was darkness and misery; how much he hated the fact that he was there instead of at Beauxbatons, surrounded by his friends and writing letters to Harry. He would see Harry now daily — at least that was a good thing — but facing him and having to lie to him would be a greater pain than Draco had ever felt. Even the stab of that wooden stick many years ago wouldn't be able to compare to the pain of having to lie to his lover; lie about something that would hurt both himself as Harry greatly. Perhaps even the whole school.
Black wings, almost like leather, took off into the sky. The last bit of sunshine shone upon their heads as they flew higher and higher, further away from Hogwarts. A bit of smoke hung above the courtyard, faint memories of firework explosions that had lent them the opportunity to get away unnoticed.
Harry blinked a few times with his eyes and pushed up his spectacles again that were starting to slide down his nose. 'I-I'm sorry,' he said as he wanted to climb off of Draco. But Draco wrapped his arms around the boy again and held him down, Harry's head falling upon Draco's chest.
But Harry himself had just rolled his eyes and opened the old book again. It concerned Draco a little with how much time Harry seemed to spend with reading the scribbles in the book. Draco himself had read a few pages but had found nothing special besides some notes that corrected the way of creating a potion — things he had known himself already. Was there something he hadn't seen? Was there something that was interesting to Harry but not to him?
‘What about it?’
the portrait had said.
— it was the Chosen One himself.
'Give it back,' Harry demanded as he jumped off the swing.
'He kissed you?!' Raphael shouted.
With those words out, Harry strangled himself out of his jacket and took off — running as fast as his legs could take him. "

When a loud applause broke free on the other side of the canvas; both Draco and Fleur knew it was time for Beauxbatons' Champion to prove herself. Fleur took a deep breath and gave Draco a quick hug before taking Madame's hand, letting her guide her towards the arena. Draco himself followed in their pace and gave Fleur a firm nod before she left the tent and got welcomed by many applauding hands. Madame Maxime threw a worrying smile after her and left the tent through an opening a little more to the left. As Draco made his way towards that exit as well, he almost ran into Dumbledore who entered the tent at the same time.
'The return of Voldemort, of course. Why don't you go ask him yourself, Dolores? I'm sure he'll gladly tell you all the details.'

If it had been Dudley or someone else asking him to do just that, he'd told them to bugger off. But something —
"The true gaze of an angel." Soft footsteps on wood then told him Draco'd stood up; had started paced across the room. "Addicting yet extremely dangerous."
Draco interrupted Potter's mumbling by shaking his head and raising a hand to put him to a halt. '
'No. One week. Don't get me wrong; I know- We know that this is a very unique case that should be studied thoroughly but we just can't risk having something like this amongst us. Nobody else is suffering from the curse anyway; a cure simply isn't necessary,' the Unspeakable said.
A soft cry then was hearable; as if the blond boy had suddenly started crying. Listening carefully, Harry tried to recognize to whom the whispering voice belonged, but it was almost as if a Silencio was cast upon him
Every passing day had seemed like a dream to Harry. A dream he had been able to live with Draco by his side. They had done almost everything together in need to feed a hunger for each other that didn't seem to get lessened by anything but each other's presence.
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
There was only one week left until Halloween; a few professors already rambling on about everything that had to be done for the celebration. Hagrid had started his selection of pumpkins that were to be carved and students seemed to be hyped for what kind of desserts there would be at the feast. Having breakfast at the Great Hall that morning with Harry by his side, as usual, Draco almost didn't notice an owl had landed in front of him as well; delivering mail he hadn't had since his arrival at Hogwarts. 'Draco,' Harry said while nudging him against his shoulder. 'I believe there's something here for you.' Looking up, he immediately recognized the beautiful creature as his own owl, a barn owl with a heart-shaped face he brought with him to Beauxbatons every year. Had he even brought her home over the summer, he suddenly wondered. Perhaps he had left her at Beauxbatons and did Madame Maxime simply sent her to him.
Draco smiled. 'It was because of you that I found it,
The soft sound of running water catches his ears as he moves closer to the window, his hands clenched around a mug of tea. He has to see his best friends today; tell them what he learnt from Malfoy yesterday. The man told him not to tell anyone but keeping this a secret from Ron and Hermione would probably kill him in the end. And he could use some wise advice from Hermione; maybe she knew something about blackening curses.
'Draco, please. I'm sorry, I-I assumed things and—' Harry began, his voice sounding as if he was crying again. Draco bit his lip, wanting to turn around and face Harry, tell him that it was alright but — but it wasn't.
'I'm sorry about your father.' With a weird expression on his face as if Harry didn't know wether he should truly feel sorry or not, he told Draco those words.

. "Potty Potter — looking as
and the boy smiled as well. 'I'll be out for a few minutes, but be free to use my office in my absence to — redress a few things,' Dumbledore declared before leaving his office in the hands of two boys, laughing over biting candy.
Mimicking a voice to make his friends laugh, he snatched Draco's letter out of Harry's hands. 'What’s this? A letter from Cedric your boyfriend?'
Already a month had passed since he had awoken from his sleep, with wounds larger than he had ever seen. Two months had passed since he had last seen Harry. And who knew how many more would follow until he would be met with freedom again.
'I can't!' he shouted back, afraid.
. Just Harry.'
Blond and black turned as they faced the owner of a voice they recognized all too well. Behind their back stood Castor Idel, two other students flanking him. Three wands were raised like angrily pointed fingers — their eyes piercing into theirs. Their feet took one step closer; entering the bit of light shining in from above. The ray fell over Castor's face and made Draco take a step back while he tried not to get sick. Castor’s face was mutilated, as if a giant flame had licked his cheek. Burned.
As they discussed this topic, they suddenly heard the cabinet door to their right creak, followed by a pale hand with long fingers creeping out of it. A large eye stared at them, and along came the rest of Kreacher's figure. 'Of course!' Hermione then called out, launching herself in Kreacher's direction and making the house-elf blink a few times with his annoyed, large eyes. 'Kreacher, have you ever seen a locket like this before?' She held the fake locket in front of his eyes, watched how the elf's pupils followed its left-to-right swinging motion.
Potter's hand feels warm and comforting on Draco's wrist, even though the grip is quite tight. But he loosens his grip, sliding his hand softly over Draco's skin and taking his hand in his. Pressing firmly into Draco's palm he whispers,'don't worry, you're not alone in this, alright? Believe it or not but I care about you.'
Harry rose and reached out his hand to pull Draco up to his feet as well. '
'It is, but — there are other, more important things to worry about right now. And I think you too have greater worries than me being underfed,' he replied.
'No, sir. I promise,' Harry replied.
His freckled hand held up Harry's Christmas jumper. With a thankful smile Harry took it from him but passed it on to Draco. 'I'm not that cold, actually. Are you?' Draco gave him a look as if he had gone mad but accepted the jumper anyway. The left corner of the blond's mouth was lifted a bit, as if he had been flattered by the gesture of a madman.
Not drawing any conclusions immediately, Harry had gone back to bed. But as Draco kept disappearing during nighttimes — Harry also kept on checking on him. Almost every night he met the Slytherin boy on the seventh floor; only to disappear with him a few seconds after. Something was off, Harry concluded.
But even though there was no escape; Draco knew that he would never truly obey his orders. He would try to please him for as long as he could; make it seem like he was obeying him but in the end figure out another way. Because there always was another way, right?
Before the boy could answer, a different voice interrupted their moment and made the boy break the gaze. It felt as if Harry got kicked in the stomach by reality — as if he'd fallen from a skyscraper in his dream and stirred awake at once. It took a few seconds for him to collect himself, but the voice rambled on next to him in the meantime,
Draco could literally see Hermione curse herself from the inside out. 'Why didn't you ask Ron instead?'
It had been harder to escape without Harry noticing than it had been to sneak up to the seventh floor; Harry always wanting to go everywhere with him and to notice it quite fast whenever he was gone. Not to mention the sly Gryffindor could always be following him underneath his invisibility cloak.
But the tears couldn't cover the ugliness of the dark, red lines on his stomach and chest. Hurried footsteps were heard as Harry nearly ran to Draco, taking his cold hands in his warm ones. 'Shh, it's alright — it's just scars,' he told Draco in a soothing way, yet with an undertone of worry and guilt. It didn't help, as Draco's tears kept falling down, his body slowly shaking with every escaping sob. 'Don't you remember?'
During lunchtime he couldn't help but let his mind wander off again. Only this time, his eyes chose to wander off as well. They found Harry quite quickly; talking eagerly to his friends and making large gestures with his arms and hands. He smiled brightly while explaining something and Draco felt himself melt away at the sight of a passionate boy.
Wandering through the tent now and listening to boring and tiring conversations, Harry finally got his chance to greet Luna and her father in a decent way. However the man was called, he already forgot the minute it had come out of his mouth. 'You must know, my boy, that the Quibbler will always be on your side to tell the truth to the Wizarding Community,' he assured Harry before Luna shooed her father's words away — told him it was
A sigh followed. 'Why make plans when we have no idea whom will be there, or what the Manor even looks like,' she explained. 'I've searched for information about the Manor in every book I could find, but it seems to be a very private property guarded by ancient spells I simply know nothing about.'
A battle of moving stairs later Draco arrived at the portrait Hermione had told him about.
'But — but how,' Harry now asked. Draco only shrugged and helped him get up to his feet, his knees still a bit wobbly but his mind slowly clearing up again.
'I believe all you roommates could use it,' Draco replied as he took another look around. The beds of the other boys were unmade as well and clutter was everywhere. But he didn't care about them nor there untidiness; he only cared about the green-eyed boy in front of him. 'So, should we go back to your party?' He took a step closer and placed his arms around Harry's neck. 'Or should we create our own?'
As she opened her mouth to answer, Ron interrupted her; 'Her name isn't Belle, it's Hermione!'

Draco furrows his brows and moves to the edge of his seat. His eyes never leave Harry's, only seem to get more intense with every passing second.
for a moment, standing there as if he owns the place. Hands in his sides, Auror robes wrinkled and a terrible choice of outerwear — nothing that surprises Draco, really. But Potter definitely doesn't look the same way like he did five years ago. His shoulders are more broad, his jawline more present and his cheekbones too; as if he was on a strict diet only recently. The bird's nest is still the same, as are his glasses and the green eyes behind it, reminding Draco of the boy he’d known at school.
Draco took deep breaths as he let the information sink in, tried to calm himself for his shoulders kept shaking. Flashes of headmaster Dumbledore falling off the Astronomy Tower slowly slithered back into his mind. A sadness caused by grief overcame him, made his heart sink. 'You were there?' His voice was a mere whisper, but Harry had heard every word and nodded. 'Did I — did I really kill him?
'This— this was
Of course that wasn't the end of the argument and with Karakov soon joining in as well, the conversation became rather heated quickly. Draco decided he didn't want to be stuck in any of it and quickly made his way over to Fleur whom was looking blankly into the fireplace.
'Draco! I haven't seen you around in a while,' Harry greeted, his smile still set.
Draco nodded with a smile. '
'It's… complicated,' he replied in the end with a weak smile that was more like a grimace. To cast away the heavy atmosphere that had suddenly fallen around them, Harry silently casted a patronus charm of his own and sent his stag over the lake. Draco lifted his head again to look at how the stag took place beside the swan and how they seemed to communicate without any words. It felt the same to Harry as Draco's hand intertwined with his again, no words needed to know the boy was thankful.
-fall. One of his rules however was that Harry had to fly with him every single time, to keep an eye on him and catch him must he fall again. But Draco hadn't fallen anymore, his imaginary butterfly wings finally working to perfection. The second scar from the
Lost for words, Draco brought a hand to his mouth and dared to glance at his fingers as he drew them back. Blood was smeared at every tip, little drops of it falling down in the pure white snow. 'I — I,' he tried, but he didn’t seem to find any words to describe what was going on. His heart was beating normal again and even though he still could taste the blood that had appeared in his mouth; he somehow knew there wouldn't follow any more.
The French woman sighed. 'It is not your fault,
do you hide his secrets?' Harry's poking finger had returned and this time Draco didn't push his hand away but took it in his. If anger wasn't helping, then maybe love could.
,' he mumbled as Harry sat himself down next to him; unaware of the secret letter Draco had just hidden away. 'Are you here to study as well?'
Hermione shook her head in disagreement. 'I bet Honeydukes is closed — just like all the other shops. There is no way we'll be able to get in.'
Draco swallowed at the second hug; he just didn't like physical contact, not even by the girls whom he adored so much. And of course he understood Fleur's worry; he himself had been scared of the dragons as well. ‘Don’t worry about it. I’m sure you’ll do great!’ he assured her anyway, but his words only seemed to worry her more. She seemed lost in thought, suddenly — probably thinking about what she could do to win from a giant winged creature that spitted fire.
'You have lost,' he whispered to him, but it didn't sound like his own voice. It sounded like
'Anyway,' Harry then started. 'I'll go to Dumbledore's office after breakfast and see what the memory has been hiding from us. I have a feeling this will tell us what to do — will change the way we thought of defeating Voldemort forever.'
Now all he has to do is wait. Wait for his old enemy to make his way to the Manor again. And help him…

'You promise?'
Jumping up from his chair and catapulting it to the floor, Draco was ready to storm out of the room and plan an escape — plan his own suicide if that was what it would take to end his family's misery. But of course that wasn't a very good plan — and he knew that. 'Think about Harry,' his mother then said to him, making Draco come to a halt. 'Don't you think he would be heartbroken to hear you're dead?'
had just touched his back. Harry tumbled forward, fell over his own feet and hit the sidewalk. Car brakes, the sound of impact. Trying to ground himself, Harry placed his hands firmly on the street, digging into the freshly fallen snow. Slowly, he then crawled back up and hesitantly turned around, afraid of what he'd see. A feeling of panic raced through his veins, a rush of adrenaline joining as he saw what laid in front of him, on the street, on the spot where he stood just seconds ago.
Harry tried to focus on his hearing, but only heard the rustling of fabric, followed by a loud noise he couldn't place at all. It sounded like a certain rustling as well, but something he hadn't quite heard before. It confused him, and it took the greatest effort not to open his eyes out of sheer curiosity. And then there were these voices — at least a million that were calling his name; telling him to turn around and look.
