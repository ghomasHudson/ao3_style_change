Harry smiled as he looked after him and he realised that he got a precious gift. A family. The family he never had. The Weasleys were like family, but it was not the same. He hurried back home, only to find Draco vacuuming the living room and holding his belly at the same time. He sighed and unplugged the vacuum cleaner, making Draco turn to him offended.
Harry laughed and put his son on the chait, letting him start eating. The raven-haired man approached Draco and smiled shyly.
When Harry got to their room, he found on the desk an unfinished letter from Draco to Pansy. He quickly read it.
Anyway, I think I found a way to give his memories back, but I still need to test it so nothing is sure yet. I'm waiting for an update about Harry. Take care of yourself.
Harry felt his own pocket vibrating, so he picked up without looking at the ID, while trying to fight the Death Eater.
"What is it? STUPEFY!" he asked, as he hit the Death Eater with the first spell that occured his mind.
Draco shook his head and let the breath out. "I- thank you, Harry. But I'm fine. If Ron says something, I'll be on your side" he reassured, smiling a little.
"Jesus Christ, you scared the hell out of me! It's the middle of the night, I thought someone was breaking-" he stopped when he saw fresh tears on Draco's cheeks. He hurried to him, to see what's wrong, but Draco pulled back, shaking his head.
But how Harry hated when someone didn't do things his way. He woke up just a few hours ago and discovered that he's miraculously married to the one and only Draco Malfoy and that he has two kids with him, one on the way. He was shocked and angry at his older self for marrying that fucking ferret.
Lucius looked at him with hate in his eyes, but Harry stopped them both "Oh God, this is just a big misunderstanding! I explained this to everyone! The divorce papers was a stupid contest at the office, that I regret! I lost that stupid contest anyway! And I didn't cheat on him! I got a letter and it was from Kingsley and I grinned because he let me work from home for a few months, so I could take care of Draco because I FUCKING LOVE HIM!!"
“George, are you asking me to cheat and play dirty?” I asked in mock horror, hand reaching up to grasp at my throat in indignation.
Malfoy must have noticed because next thing I knew, a cushioning charm was cradling my knees, and I could concentrate fully on sucking his cock down now.
“Swan. Absolutely the swan,” he requested, eyes sparkling to match the excited grin spreading across his face.
’s relevant,” I shot back, hackles rising slightly. “You might still be together. You might still be in
- Draco would, no matter the situation, create elaborate escape plans whenever we went anywhere, for situations running the gamut from the incredibly mundane to the absolutely absurd (Pygmy Puffs planning a revolt and barricading the exit to
We were still madly in love, but after six years and two young ones at home, we were decidedly less open with our affection.
I closed my eyes and imagined this bloke laying on his stomach; me straddling him as I ran my hands down his sides and parting those tempting cheeks to reveal that sweet pucker.
He took the hint and almost gently caressed the back of my head with one hand while the other renewed its grip on my hair and he began to fuck my face in earnest.
It goes in the potion last, but it’s best to have it on the ready because you need to add it quickly.
“Of course you can,” she added, recovering herself and taking a bite. “So long as they’ve got the ingredients, you can order whatever you want, really.”
Just then, an heartbreaking sob ringed thorough the room and someone hugged Harry tightly, leaving him even more confused. He wondered who would hug him. When they broke the hug, Draco Malfoy looked at him with tears in his eyes.
"You don't know how happy it makes me that you are in my life. Since I've lost my memories, I refused to accept that I'm in love with you, because I was scared to destroy your relationship with the other Harry. And to repress my feelings, I avoided you. But I shouldn't have done that. I now realize how important you are to me, to my evolution. And I've grown to love you. That's the truth. I do love you. Everything was just a big misunderstanding. The divorce papers were just part of a stupid contest at the office. Who made the most real divorce papers, would get 50 galleons from each person in the office. I cheated, that's why they looked real. I took them from the internet. The day of the contest, I forgot them home. That's when you found them probably. They're fake, I swear. I would never leave my husband and my children for anything and anyone, so that excludes the fact that I cheated on you. That letter was from Kingsley. You see, he gave me the opportunity to work from home for the next few months, so I could take care of you and our children. I didn't want to tell you because I knew you would never let me do that. But I want to. I need to take care of you every day and make you smile and laugh and to keep you happy and safe. I love you, Draco Potter-Malfoy, and this is the only thing I'm sure about right this moment. I wish I could've told you this when you were awake, but I am too much of a coward" the recording ended, and Draco looked pale as death.
Draco gasped and put a hand on his heart. Harry couldn't help but smile, as he took Draco's hand "Marry me again, Draco. I don't care when. Tonight. Tomorrow. In a week. Just marry me again. Will you?".
Draco paled even more, if that was even possible. He ran to the closest trash can and started throwing up. Harry looked engrossed at him. Hermione offered Draco some water, and the blonde gladly took it. Ron sat next to Harry.
Harry broke the kiss and stroked his face, sighing "Alright, alright. BUT...if ANYTHING happens, you call Hermione, Narcissa or Molly!".
But looking closely to Ron, he saw that the redhead's eyes were filled with panic. He let the phone slip into his pocket, then he looked at Harry.
"Hermione didn't tell me anything about your arrival. She said 'Give birth and then we'll talk about Harry'" Draco said, making Harry sigh.
Hermione and Molly started talking loudly at the same time, so Harry frowned and shushed them "Draco and James are still sleeping so I would very much appreciate if you would lower your voice".
"Since you lost your memories, I hoped that you'll remember. I hoped that you'll be like my Harry. But you're not him. You're not my Harry. My Harry would never want to divorce while I'm pregnant, my Harry would NEVER cheat on me, my Harry would NEVER see me just as an useless fat ugly emotional ex Death Eater that's worth nothing, even tough I KNOW I am!! He would never make me feel bad and cry, and he would take care of me and kiss me and make love to me and comfort me when I'm sad! Because I have been diagnosed with pregnancy depression and it's not fun!! And I hate you!! I want my husband back, not this imitation of him!!" Draco screamed, breaking down like a child. Harry rushed to him and tried to hug him, but the blonde pushed him away "Don't touch me! Leave me alone!".
He went inside and heard Draco vomiting in the bathroom. Harry hurried to him and stroked his back. He was disgusted and the smell made him want to vomit too, but he had to take care of the one he was quite sure he loved. After Draco finished, Harry helped him up and took him to the sink, to wash his mouth.
For the first time in months, Draco finally felt free. He hadn't been kissed by his husband in almost three months, and damn if it didn't feel good! The blonde broke the kiss and hugged him tighter.
Suddenly, Kreacher, their former house elf, appeared between them, holding a camera. Harry looked at the house elf confused, then Kreacher played the video, turning on the volume. Harry recognized his own voice and James's gasps, meaning that the little boy recorded him.
"I was right! Someone followed us! Ron, Draco and James are alone at home! What if something bad happened?!" he started shaking the redhead.
I've got your letter while I was drinking my coffee, and I spilled it! I can't believe what Harry wants to do! It's just unbelievable! I'm going to talk some sense into him! Just wait until Ron finds out, because Harry will let go of this crazy idea!
Draco's eyes were filled with tears once again and he threw himself in Harry's arms, hitting him with his big stomach. Harry suppressed a pained groan, in order to avoid making Draco sad.
They saw a bundle on the screen and Harry was impressed. He stared at the bundle and bit his lip, getting tears in his eyes. Suddenly, the healer frowned.
Harry gasped "Draco, I can't, I'm afraid that I'll hurt you or the baby", but when Draco laughed, Harry accepted the offer.
Harry widened his eyes and looked at the screen. Now, he didn't see just a bundle. He saw two. The brunette smiled at the screen, and then at Draco. The healer told them they were having a boy and a girl.
The next photo was taken in 2005, at what seemed their wedding. Harry and Draco were kissing, and everyone was standing and clapping, the priest smiling behind the couple.
If he's cheating on you, I'll personally murder him. I don't know what to believe honestly, and I know you don't want to believe this either. And you can't convince me NOT to talk to him. He needs to realize his mistakes!
"You will, honey, you only have to wait three more years" the blonde told his youngest daughter, who was whinning.
"No, Draco! You're not a bad person! How could you even say that? You're carrying his child and you are doing everything around the house! You did nothing wrong! If anything, you have all my respect and you should have his too. He's so ungrateful, Draco. Maybe he is too dumb to realize that, but I promise he will. And when he'll remember everything, he will feel so guilty, that I'll laugh at him for months!"
Even though Harry saw how hard Draco was working, he still found it easier to avoid him. He didn't want to accept the fact that him and Malfoy were married, but when he thought about that, he felt a wave of warmth through his body.
"Trust me, you did. I do love you and I only realised that a few days ago. Not your Harry. Me. I can't wait to get my memories back. Then I'll maybe realize my unconditional love for you, because you are the most loveable person I know. And I'm serious. I love you, Draco. And this is not your Harry or mine or something else. This is just Harry. The same Harry who had no idea he's a wizard until 11 years old, the Harry you married and who lost his memories. It's just Harry. And Just Harry loves you a lot" Harry spoke from his heart, taking Draco's hands.
"Smooth, mate. You're very encouraging, thank you very much" Harry said, giggling "And me and Draco are fine. Everything's alright between us, except for the fact that he believes I want a divorce, and that I cheated on him!"
Harry bit his lip, knowing that he wanted the same thing, then he got up and turned off the lights. He wished him good night, then he got out of the room and went to his own. The raven-haired man took out Hermione's Howler and put a silencing spell on the room. He opened the letter and it fkew from his hands, becoming some paper lips.
Harry locked the front door of his house, and activated a protecting system. Ron looked at him confused, then the two of them Apparated at the Leaky Cauldron. They entered the pub and sat at a table. With the corner of his eye, Harry saw a man entering after them.
Harry turned to him and shushed him, pointing to a sleeping Draco on the couch. He made them a head sign to the kitchen, and the three of them headed there. Narcissa closed the door and put a silencing spell on the room. She looked at Harry with a look that could kill.
The brunette laid in their bed and he went close to Draco's belly. He started stroking it softly, and Draco smiled, hoping it wasn't a dream.
Harry cheated. He copied the divorce papers from the internet but he wasn't sorry. He knew he would win. How he would explain Draco the money, that was another story. The only problem was that he forgot the papers home when the contest day finally arrived. He tried to explain that he forgot them home, but he still lost 50 galleons.
"Ron!! Ron! I need a hand!" he screamed, when one Death Eater was too hard to arrest. He glanced behind him and saw he was talking at the phone. He felt rage filling his body. Talking on the phone, while they were on the field?
Hermione and Molly started talking loudly at the same time, so Harry frowned and shushed them "Draco and James are still sleeping so I would very much appreciate if you would lower your voice".
That was the night that broke the ice, Harry thinks, they woke up and had dinner for breakfast which was technically lunch but it didn't matter, life with Malfoy might turn out good after all.
So he took the porcelian plates with untouched food and set them in the freezer. The kitchen had big glass sliding doors so it was beautifully lit, he could see eveything clearly as if it was daylight a quick tempus told him it was three in the morning but his guilt ridden somewhat foggy and sleepy mind told him re-heating charms were surely made for this moment in history.
Draco stopped pacing immediately, "What the bloody helll are you doing here?" this was not said with the irritation and anger that he was used to, but with genuine amazement at the fact that he, Draco Malfoy was standing there, in Harry Potters house.
Moving his mind away from indecent thoughts, he looked for another topic to think about, ah! Draco's face caught his attention and again his train of thought was gone. How handsome his brows were, how his skin took on the color of the sun and shone golden- with pink sunburned cheeks. How red his lips were! How soft they looked! Harry almost leaned forward without thinking, He had always been generous in showing affection and non of his friends had minded him hugging or pecking them. It was accepted as just a Harry thing.
His tongue was dry and he was past he point of overheated "I can't walk anymore" he finally admitted to his black haired companion, who was unfairly not sweaty and shielded from the sun by his straw hat.
"No, nononono" he was saying pushing Draco out of the room, "Master Harry must not be woken, Master Harry must be rested"
Something he could only call "endearment" tugged at his heart and made him feel light. As soon as Harry noticed him he got up, spoiled knees and all and smiled and looked so full of life that he put Draco's heart at ease. huh. Draco noted with irony, Potter putting his heart at ease, what a turn of events, why wasn't it surprising him more?
Draco's social services had begun, although he was as nervous as he had been on his first day of Hogwards, he could not summon the excitement.
Not only had he been woken up by shrill childish voices, he had seen immmediately Draco beside some women, holding a kid. The soft easy way they talked, and the laugh Harry interpreted to mean that if they weren't already they would soon be dating.
Harry was waiting on the waiting bench outside the school, he was dressed simply in shorts and a white tee, his knapsack with him, he waved at Draco and Draco had this silly feeling of his irritaion melting away.
He'd been so busy fearing Harry's gaze that by the time he sneaked a quick peek, he found the man comfortably asleep in a very creaky position for his neck.
He had realised that Draco had forgotten to go to his job today but had kept quite. The pricks of guilt and unease squeezing his heart was a small price to pay to let this comfortable silence between them stretch on.
Somehow it made him feel worse to remember that Harry had friends and people who cared about him, who he cared about, and who knew him so much better, it made him feel more isolated than he had ever been, cause atleast back then he didn't care a whit about who Harry talked to. Ok thats a lie, he had cared about who Harry associated himself with before he even knew that he was Harry Potter, he had cared for the poorly dressed boy at Madam Milkins and all these years he hadn't stopped, he just expressed it with anger.
If Harry noticed, he didn't say anything. But it seemed more likely that he was unaware and to some degree Draco was right.
He sighed a heavy sigh finally and finished pouring the tea into two cups, "Master Harry is left an invalid, both mentally and physically"
Draco realised that Harry grit his teeth while sleeping a habit that shot right at Draco's heart, everything Harry did was adorable and this was no exception.
The room was (according to Draco) small (it was actually mid sized), the walls were a pretty lilac and his bedsheets felt comfortable.
“Yes, and she’s quite upset with George’s mum for refusing to admit that she allowed them to dye his hair during the sleepover.
Williams had had a belief — one that had started nearly eight years ago when we’d both worked at MACUSA Boston — that
Several hours, and, admittedly, far too many beers, skewers, and other delicious Japanese tapas-style dishes later, Harry and I found ourselves on the Japanese metro, headed home.
“I didn’t say I wanted to live here,” Hermione was saying defensively. “There are lots of other wonderful parts of London that are more affordable.”
We sat in a comfortable silence, eating our ice cream, Draco pulling ridiculous faces at Manon and Hugo, their giggles the only sound for the time being.
It's been a little crazy with the thought of going back to work and taking care of "real" business (seriously, why can't writing smut just be my job, lol).
Draco didn’t say a word, but next second I found his half-eaten dessert placed neatly before me, giving me all the answer I needed.
“We’ll have a bottle of the Blanc de Blancs,” he told Colin, who nodded approvingly. “And an order of the fried olives to start, please?”
Not even a whisper, more like an exhalation of breath, a prayer, and I pulled his mouth down towards mine to claim his as my arms and legs wound themselves around his shoulders and waist, pulling him as close as possible.
“Yeah, a little too much, that one night,” I explained, and I couldn’t help giggling at remembering how very drunk Draco had got the first — and only — time he’d tried the fiery-sweet drink and had insisted that he would be just
I felt the shock of a complex identity spell flash through me and I stared at Malfoy, dazedly wondering where he’d learnt a spell like that.
He set him gently on the floor just in front of Molly so the toddler could easily join the group hug and grinned down at us as we responded with choruses of “good” and “fine.”
Another blast of energy and the pebbles had re-launched themselves at Draco with renewed energy, only to bounce back off the invisible shield again.
“Amazing, I mean… and I’m sorry, it’s just been… a really weird day, and I’ve had my guard down and…”
“He’s got himself all worked up, convinced Draco’s wondering ‘what if’ and wishing he and ex-lover-boy were still a
“I believe I was in the middle of riding you as though both our lives depended on it,” I mused, tilting my face upwards to look at him.
“Nana!” Victoire, Bill’s oldest daughter, came barrelling at Molly, arms outstretched, followed by an equally eager little Dominique.
I had on my best pair of trousers and a burgundy shirt in a paisley print I rather liked, with my tweed jacket.
“Tell me your thoughts while I have a look,” I encouraged, understanding that his lateness, and any reasons for having been, were to be pushed aside for the time being.
I gave in, then, to the need to suck Harry off properly, swallowing him down greedily until my nose was buried in his pubic hair, then sliding slowly back up, continuing back and forth, as my hands began fumbling with his trousers, tugging them down so I could feel the satin-smooth skin of his groin and reach round to cup and squeeze his arse.
Draco had no issues with PDAs, but he’d always hated schmoopy, cutesy displays of affection, and would always snarl at me not to be a “fucking
I removed my hand, swiping my tongue up Potter’s crack one last time, sucking longingly at his hole, before pressing the tip of my finger against it.
was the duck out of water and had to keep reminding myself not to make small talk on the bus or while standing in line at the grocery store, (excuse me,
“I like,” I replied, nodding, taking in the hundreds of blue mats lining the park with groups of family, friends, and lovers gathered on them.
I barely gave Draco a second to enjoy being sheathed inside of me before I was rising up again, then down, over and over, squeezing and rocking, trying to catch that spot, eyes rolling back in my head when he finally brushed against it.
“But, instead of you waking up with me already swallowing your cock with my arse, as you so delicately put it,” I continued, driving both fingers back into his mouth, deep as I could, ensuring that Draco’s obscene mind couldn’t distract me from my goal for the time being.
“Aww,” he teased, fake pout mocking me as he slowly slid the dildo further into my mouth. “Not what you were hoping for?”
He paused and reached up to take the bunch of flowers and float them neatly to the basket set aside to gather them and eyed me warily.
I humphed and crossed my arms, pouting, making sure that Potter knew just how much trouble he was about to get himself into and continued to glower across the table at both him and Mum.
I was out to my friends and my teammates at Montrose but was already dreading the day when the Prophet would figure it out and have a field day with that juicy tidbit. I was hoping it would be once I’d decided to settle down with someone; I definitely didn’t want it to be because some other wizard had seen my profile on a Muggle hook-up app.
“Oh,” Harry said again, and I almost felt bad for ruining his image of the “rich kid” life he’d created.
Filing that brief fantasy away for future use, I continued to seat myself on Draco, leaning in for another kiss.
I’d spent September mostly sitting in the apartment Ginny and I shared in Dufftown, where we lived in the Scottish highlands, staring stupidly at all the magical gadgets and reading every book I could lay my hands on, sure, to learn more about Ginny’s world, but also, hello?
“Wait a minute,” I shook my head, trying to take this all in. “You didn’t even know you were a wizard until you got your Hogwarts letter? How did they explain all your magical outbursts?”
my opening before dipping in as far as he could manage, the tip of said tongue just barely pushing through my still-tight pucker.
I don’t know what Draco did to earn another smack from Pansy, but he flinched suddenly and rubbed at his hand.
“Then you’ll love boys when you grow up,” I replied with a shrug. “And they’d better treat you nicely, the way you deserve.”
“Ways to tell you so,” he clarified with a brilliant smile, those stupid eyes of his sparkling so openly and honestly up at me
Those were three of my favourite cheeses, and I’d have no problem bringing any leftovers back to London with me.
Michaels nodded in the direction of Voltaire Road, as though we might have picked said gentleman’s house out of the line of brick townhouses ourselves.
This was one of my favourite parts about falling in love — with anyone, really — but especially Harry.
So... I realised that I haven't really been checking to see if any of the places I'm mentioning in London even existed in 2009 when the story takes place.
“Where did you imagine my cock?” I thrust my hips up, rutting my length along his channel as I nipped along Harry’s neck again, pressing an innocent kiss into the corner of his mouth before continuing.
why her husband has no interest in her and prefers to spend all of his time travelling and insisting on taking along his favourite valet,” he continued, smiling up at me wryly.
The other fork, according to all the wizards present, was a place for mostly dark and nasty magic, the likes of which my parents — no doubt — had imagined all wizardkind to
Unsurprisingly, being a Metamorphmagus and showing up for classes with a different hair colour or altered nose each day made one quite popular during one’s first week.
“Well, what about tomorrow,” I pressed. “I have just a few presents to give them and I insist on seeing them open them.”
I racked my brain, trying to see what I could remember about anyone named Malfoy or anything else Ginny might have mentioned about Harry’s boyfriend.
Still caught in those blissful moments between sleep and wake, it took me a few seconds to remember where I was, and suddenly, I sat upright, looking around urgently because Draco was no longer stretched out alongside me.
“I get it,” he interrupted, grinning at me again as he held the last bite of his pancake up for me to eat. “I’d like to live everywhere, and eat all the foods, and know all the things, too.”
“I’m going to make sure we change that,” he promised, eyes sparkling with anticipation, and I wondered how many wonderful places Draco had visited in his privileged life.
“Mouth or fingers, kitten,” I insisted petting the insides of his thighs, coaxing them open so that Harry was spread out before me, like a mouth-watering display.
I exhaled and imagined sliding in, slowly, allowing him to accommodate me until I was fully inside. I picked up the speed here as my mind kept up the scene. Of this stranger spread out before me, hips rising to meet my own, moaning and begging for more. Harder. Faster. Imaginary me did not disappoint and all too soon, I felt the familiar tug behind my navel and seconds later my orgasm exploded, literally, over me and I panted heavily for a few seconds before I waved my hand and wordlessly evaporated the mess I’d made all over my trousers.
Someone, please tell me this wasn’t what I thought it was and that I’d been missing out on this for years.
“The veil is thinner than it has been in over thirty years, and with Draco here to help me with the ceremony,
“I don’t know why you like to eat things so spicy you can’t feel your face for nearly a half-hour afterwards,” I sighed, rolling my eyes and selecting a spice level of three.
He paused and stared at the ground for a moment before taking a deep breath and fixing Snape with those ridiculously green eyes of his, and a part of me briefly wondered if Harry did that on purpose, knowing the effect his eyes, blazing full of sincerity, would have.
“Neither of those two need wands,” Molly explained again. “Wandless magic is rare, but not unheard of.”
think about Apparating away right now!” Ron yelled suddenly, and Harry and I turned to find the entire group looking at us with a
“It’d be nice,” I replied, leaning forward to take a bite, savouring the perfectly crisp bacon cubes and the accompanying salty-sweet tang of the pineapple chutney.
I assumed wizard politicians disagreed on things just like our Muggle ones did and wizard and witches had to volunteer to fight their battles for them, just like we did.
“Gods, Harry,” I sighed, lifting my head so I could plunder his mouth again. “I love you so goddamned much.”
wasn’t much to see — just a large, stone-lined vault, with a small antechamber in the front, as Hermione had explained, and a larger room at back.
I pulled Malfoy’s head back down, demanding still more from his mouth, and he obliged, working us back up to that same intensity where we’d just been.
From their appearances, to their personalities, to even how their magic manifested; Harry’s brash, almost crackling, like the air before a thunderstorm, and Draco’s, quiet and subdued, but no less dangerous or powerful.
Which, of course, led to him explaining about the bookies George had set up during the New Year’s Eve gala at the ministry, and I made a note to myself not to skip it next year.
“Blaise, we’re meeting for pints again,” Ron informed me, rubbing tiredly at his eyes with the palms of his hands.
I nearly began drooling, remembering the gooey, caramelly, treat melted over that cup of coffee, and I was hoping he’d think to top my cuppa with one.
“I promise to keep this safe for you until its time for you to go to Hogwarts,” he added as he began climbing the ladder to return the wand to its spot.
“Heathen,” I murmured, kissing the top of his head affectionately as I scooped some rice and vindaloo onto my own plate.
Hermione burst out laughing, and I chanced a glance at her direction, bite all but forgotten in midair.
“This is exactly what I wanted,” he informed us both, the satisfied smile still in place as he sliced himself a bite of avocado, swirling it in the egg yolk before lifting the forkful to his mouth.
Malfoy needed no further invitation and began fucking me purposefully, setting a steady rhythm of long, sure strokes, searching for the right angle so that his thick head would catch that spot on each stroke.
Potter?” I exclaimed, burying my face in his neck and wrapping my arms around him, holding him tightly against me.
Malfoy’s back remained to me as he massaged shampoo into his shining locks, working it into a lather.
“The last time I was here, people would stop and stare,” he went on, and I rolled my eyes because I was pretty sure it hadn't only Draco’s platinum locks that had attracted those stares. “Sometimes kids, or, like, cute little old grandmother-types would reach out and try to touch it because they didn’t think it was real.”
“Trying to steal my boyfriend with uni,” he joked, pressing a kiss to my temple, eyes still on our chef. “Rude.”
Hermione, bless her, had cast an impervious and warming spell at Ben and Micah to shield them from the rain and cold out on the moor, both of them staring at Harry in complete awe, having, I supposed, finally realised what we meant when we told them Harry was a powerful wizard.
I typed some nonsense about being highly proficient in dirty talk and how my cock would definitely be worth his effort and waited.
Draco nudged at my opening and drove in once more, one hand moving to caress reverently down my side before curving around to cup my arse, bringing me even closer to him.
I didn’t know if I wanted him to get so angry at my words and leave, or gift my ears with another shameless moan and grind that pert arse of his back onto me again.
“What shop did you go to in Knockturn Alley?” Williams asked, frowning, his finger holding his place in Draco’s report as he glanced over at us curiously.
Bones, true to all reports, proved to be wise, fair, and, most importantly, forgiving, and, well… the rest, as far as my career was concerned, was history.
“Hullo!” she greeted us, opening the door that led straight into her reception, where Ben and Malik already sat, waving happily at us from Pansy’s pair of dramatic, dark blue velvet sofas.
I had no delusions that Harry and I would have this perfect, blissful relationship and knew that there would be rows.
“Boils, broken china, bats flying out of your nose… you could survive all of that. That wouldn’t break you,” he paused again to smirk down at me knowingly as he crossed the distance between us so that he was stood directly in front of me, and I know I would have collapsed in tears had he not had some evil spell worked on me to glue me to the wall.
Micah, I noticed, was staring, slack-jawed, eyes darting between Fred and George, her face having gone
lied to that evil, pathetic madman, and my only regret is that I hadn’t taken Draco and left it all behind sooner.
She raised a brow at Draco, her look all but saying, “Tell me what the bloody hell is going on here.”
that when I slid into him so slowly, as I did now, my cock only pressing into him halfway before sliding back out, it was to tease him and make him beg.
to be nearby… again, too risky to cast from far away, so within eyesight…” I stopped and turned to stare at Williams, a lightbulb of sorts having gone off in my brain.
Malfoy stepped one foot between my own, forcing me to rock back onto my heels, one strong arm sliding around my waist, the other stroking up to cradle the back of my head so that I was completely supported by Malfoy.
The gravity of what we’d both just admitted hit me then, and I glanced away from him momentarily, before glancing back down at him.
“Same room as last time? Six tatami for two person, with bathroom,” he verified, checking his ledger again. “And check out Friday, April sixteen?”
I glanced around and noticed several couples and groups of friends also gathered, sharing bottles of wine and champagne, some with plastic cups, others with just the bottle, like us.
I was still in a daze, perhaps all the wonder of the wizarding world and my cousin’s place within it finally catching up with me.
know that Obliviate is…” Hermione paused and glanced upwards the way she always did when trying to string the bazillion thoughts racing through her mind into a coherent sentence.
“I don’t know, Harry, I suppose I learnt it the way you’d learn anything else,” I said, finally. “Desire to succeed and lots of practice,” I wiggled my eyebrows at him in, what I hoped, was a mood-lightening gesture and Harry snorted with laughter.
“You flung a phial of holy water at me and held up a fucking crucifix so I couldn’t touch you… just so you know, that’s strictly vampire lore, and doesn’t affect me….”
Harry smirked, then, and began his own torturous trail down my torso, tongue darting out to tease at my nipples, to trace along that scar running across my chest, to dip into my bellybutton, eliciting a most un-Malfoy-like giggle, which, of course, had the arsehole returning for more.
There’d been the time where he’d insisted he was just reading a book in the bath (and definitely not trying to tease me), only to smirk knowingly when I’d
Again, Alice and I were thankful for Harry, Draco, Hermione, and Teddy to help us navigate the long list of books Callum would need,
I set down my comb and stared at my reflection in the mirror, ignoring its appreciative comments and shut my eyes.
Draco suddenly appeared in my line of vision, a pleased smile spreading across his face as his eyes took in the sight of me, spread out and bound to his table, being fucked at both ends by two dildos, him still fully clothed, clearly having no intention of fucking me himself anytime soon.
“He was bragging about some of his more grown-up skills and now he’s embarrassed to look at Mum,” Ginny answered, smacking Harry’s middle finger that had reached out and extended itself in front of her face.
the boys away from him on the dance floor when they used to frequent Muggle clubs — for their safety
“It was smart of you to brew a big batch,” Molly said, pouring herself a cup of coffee and taking a seat at the head of the table. “I have a feeling we’ll all be needing some
1. Before I forget, I owe it to mss_melanie13 for the title of this ENTIRE series because she suggested it to me in a comment!
His gaze seemed particularly focused on Hermione, who was, no doubt, remembering her torture at the hands of his Aunt.
A quick scroll through her photo album showed thousands of photos of a man, whom I assumed was Shaan Acharya.
My hands had found my way down to his head, and I threaded my fingers through his hair, revelling in the feel of those silken strands and I briefly thought that I should invest in better hair products.
cook. Unless he wants to,” Draco replied, and while I knew first-hand what a doting boyfriend Draco could be, there was something in his voice and gaze that told me his desire to make sure Harry didn’t have to cook unless he felt like it stemmed from something deeper.
A short while later, Harry and I were downstairs in the sumptuous bar, the walls lined with dark wood and leather-bound books, the thick, velvet, crimson curtains that hung in the entry only adding to the allure, making it
“Fuck, I love you like this,” Draco informed me, fastening his mouth around me, licking and slurping into me, and how could I
I’d shown up at our flat that evening around midnight, accompanied by two officials from the Ministry for Magic, because, yes, there was such a thing, and they’d explained to Malik where I’d been and what had happened to me, and he’d just stared at the three of us, jaw slack like he didn’t know what to even
“But seriously, Potter,” he said, as though these were the most normal circumstances under which to conduct a conversation, “when
“I understand,” she agreed with an enthusiastic nod. “I wouldn’t eat it for years, and I’m so glad I finally tried it.”
Our children were wonderful and there was no way in hell I was ever going to change them from being anything other than themselves, and I thanked whatever deities that existed that none of them seemed to have inherited any trace of my childhood penchant for being a complete shit-arse bully.
“And, unfortunately for the WAGs, you’d steal all their thunder with your perfect hair and perfect outfit.”
“I wanted to surprise you,” his sleep-laden morning voice murmured softly, that hand still working steadily.
Draco was floating our luggage behind him and set them beneath a long shelf that ran along one wall.
I just continued grinning, sipping my tea, and watched as he added the green onions and fried egg to the top of the pancakes.
“Most people seem quite pleased when I shove my wand in their face,” Blaise shot back, a bit juvenile, yes, but funny all the same.
Burrow looming in the background where Molly was finishing the setup with Arthur’s help, both of them swirling and swishing their wands to send garlands, wreaths, and tiny faery-lights to hang themselves artfully around the tent.
At one point, Fleur had even glanced over at me, brows raised and asked if I needed to go lie down, thinking I was hungover like everyone else in the house.
It was only half a second, but the image was quite seared to my brain and I turned to stare at Draco, jaw dropped. Blaise, I noted, did likewise.
help mum out a lot more in the kitchen when you come home next summer,” Alice teased, taking her glass of wine and grinning down at her son.
I watched, commenting as much as I was able, as Draco led the three children in brewing their first potion.
And a third faction who wanted regulations to be even stricter, limiting interaction with Muggles to the bare minimum.
I didn’t need any more encouragement to spring myself up from the bed and follow him into the tiled bathroom with a giant claw-foot tub against one wall.
Dreadful hangover aside, it was the perfect time have some me time and keep track of, well, all the crazy happening in my life right now.
He stayed like that for a while, tongue licking and swirling, sucking sweetly every once in a while.
“Look, I don’t know what that word means, but if it means doing that video-watching-with-commentary thing in his mind, then yes.
The first consisted of green tea infused well through with passion fruit, mango, and vodka, then mixed with
“What?” Ben whispered, looking absolutely stunned, and I glanced at Blaise again, wondering if we might need to help administer a calming draught or something.
’d gotten your revenge soon after, tying the poor man up so securely (I’m sure you used magic, you sneaky son-of-a-bitch), then teasing and taunting him so close to the edge, only to leave him there, struggling and gasping for release, before returning and beginning the entire cycle again.
Another brief pause as Harry stumbled to his feet, all but tripping on the blanket, then into his own trousers.
“I didn’t mean to,” I responded brokenly, our mouths still pressed together as we stumbled to… wherever he was leading me to.
“You always know what to do and… hold-hold on… there’s a fit bloke I’m making eyes at…” Ron gave Draco an exaggerated wink before turning back to Hermione.
Hermione and I noticed that we were the only ones at our table dancing enthusiastically and we sat down quickly.
It’s what had created our entire world as we know it — and when certain individuals become dissatisfied with their world, they turn to thought to change it —
“Sorry,” Draco’s gaze slid over towards Hermione, Harry, and I. “I realise this probably isn’t bringing back the happiest of memories for you.”
I babbled, gripping at Malfoy as his mouth latched on to my neck, licking and sucking and surely leaving marks that I’d have to explain tomorrow.
They've made a few comments, and I responded to one, asking why they were even reading my fic, and also informing them that I do not write shit... but if any of you are looking for a good laugh (if reading troll comments is the sort of thing that could make you laugh... it is full of vitriol and threatening language, so please DO NOT read if this is something that might trigger you!) you should seek out the, like full-page comment this person left on chapter 11.
“Tease,” he gasped out again, sliding out then pressing back in slowly a few times before picking up the pace and setting a steady rhythm, grabbing my left leg and hoisting it over his shoulder, experimenting with the angle until he found it.
surrounded by his closest friends and family, introducing his parents to his boyfriend, being able to share a part of his life with them that,
“It’s a muggle brand,” Draco insisted, still not quite believing I didn’t know what he was talking about. “They’re one of the top British fashion houses in the world.
“Oh, no,” I groaned, waving my hands in that universal panicked “no!” gesture, and shaking my head frantically. “No, no, no, he’s joking. He doesn’t want the…”
“I honestly hadn’t planned on letting a drop touch the bath or the floor,” I replied with a little smirk, hoping to calm Draco a little with a touch of humour.
Watch as your eyes slide shut and your body jerks as you cum, listening for that sated gasp of air when I release your throat and revel in the gravelly rasp of your voice declaring:
“Merlin, Potter,” I managed to gasp out. “Every time I think I’ve finally worked out what a colossal cock-slut you are, you manage to surprise me.”
Of course, Mum had known immediately what we’d been up to as soon as we’d sat down, and I’d never been more acutely aware of just how wrecked and properly shagged Harry always managed to look for hours after, well… after he’d been properly shagged.
“I’m up! I’m up!” I assured him, forcing myself upright before he could launch into a reminder that we were here for work and that we couldn’t be late to meet Toshio, or whatever else I knew was already worrying Draco.
After that first time, when he’d magicked two dildos to fuck me, spread out across his dining room table, he’d continued to come up with one ingenious punishment after another, and, to be honest, distracting him while he worked had become somewhat of a favourite hobby of mine.
“Says here she’s been in contact with this person over twenty times,” he added, glancing back down at Draco’s report. “The time it would take to craft that many glamours….”
He was busy braiding what looked to be three slender strips of silvery fish together, and I wondered why he’d
It was a steaming cup of green tea and miso soup, I realised, as I wrapped my hands around the mug to warm them up a bit.
My knees were hurting at this point and I shifted awkwardly with my hands behind my back, mouth and throat still working their way down and around his shaft as I tried to get more comfortable.
“Is that why you tried to scare Neville?” I continued, raising a hand and teasing at one of the webs with my fingers. “Knew it’d make Hagrid pair you up with me?”
My hand sped up on my prick to match the furious pace Harry was setting above me; we were both close, I could tell.
“They have slippers for you, here,” he added, grabbing a pair of cloth slippers from a little shelf that was clearly meant for storing shoes.
My mobile pinged, and I recognised it instantly as my Grindr app, so, naturally, I pulled it out to see what my mysterious little size queen had thought of my pictures.
There was a tournament, the Tri-Wizard Tournament… that’s where we all met Fleur," he added, shooting his sister-in-law a quick smile.
I yawned again and turned to look down at him, arms reaching to clasp him closer to me for a proper morning cuddle.
A short while later, Harry and I were happily munching on our respective pizzas, sharing, obviously, and sipping on another round of the house beer, Harry snuggled against me, as he always did when he could.
“That’s got to rankle with you a bit, hmm, Lucius?” he asked, sidling up to me and leaning against me as I wrapped an arm around his waist to pull him closer.
Next moment, his tongue gave a slow, greedy lick between my cheeks, tongue swirling inside, a deep groan vibrating throughout my body as Draco moaned into me.
“I don’t know if that counts, bro,” I informed him, lobbing a crumpled up napkin at him good-naturedly.
, and candles, battery-operated ones that looked beautifully real, lit the space, strategic little clusters gathered on the bedside and coffee tables to give the room an ethereal glow in the flickering light.
“I’m a wizard. I can do magic. I can read minds,” Draco said, sitting up straight and observing Ben carefully.
Most people didn’t realise, even though they could grasp the sense of a place easily enough, and I often chuckled to myself when people said things like:
Harry turned and nuzzled against my neck, burying his nose and inhaling deeply before straightening and fixing my father with a derisive smile.
I’d burst into actual tears when I’d discovered that none of these sides existed here, and my only option had been the stupid, too-fat, not-greasy-enough potato-wedge fries.
“I was wondering if maybe we should offer to help Fleur?” she asked hesitantly. “I was going to, then wasn’t sure if it’d be awkward because I’m not a witch….”
“Fuck, Draco,” Harry sighed, still holding me close, refusing to unwrap his arms or legs from me. “Where do you even come up with these ideas?”
I nodded, frowning in thought, as I smeared some marrow onto a piece of toast and nibbled at it, taking another sip of wine, appreciating how the acidity of the wine helped cut through the rich flavour, providing a wonderful balance.
“There’s a lot you don’t know about me,” I added, deciding this was the proper moment to remove my t-shirt and close the distance between us. I threw the shirt somewhere over my shoulder and quickly moved to straddle him, plucking the glass from his hand and setting it on the table behind me.
He insisted on stopping again at Le Petit Roi, a small bookstore specialising in books and comic books for children, and I decided that all of our friends’ little ones were going to look forward to Harry and I travelling a lot more if he planned to shower them with this many presents each time we left England.
His pen, I also noticed, used many colours of ink, the notes colour-coded to make finding any information he needed readily available.
drop from his cock, my woeful attempts at glaring and pouting up at him as I devoured two of my favourite treats only seeming to amuse him further.
would,” a gravelly voice countered, and I turned to see a face I had seen displayed, howling and yelling, hundreds of times in The Prophet, but
Anyhow. Just in case any of you were wondering what happened to his accent that I've sort of written out in other chapters (because other characters would hear it, right?)
“I had to Stupefy him,” she explained. “There was no way I was risking him freaking out about magic and wizardry just before a side-along.”
that Draco had turned a work mission into a romantic weekend, and just stretched up to kiss him soundly on the mouth.
“Spit it out, Potter,” he said suddenly, refilling his glass and holding up the bottle in my direction, a questioning look on his face. I nodded, and he refilled my own glass.
“Of course,” I replied, glaring at him. “You were Saint Potter. You didn’t need the stupid cloak to get away with sneaking about the castle.”
“Anyway, when Harry came back and told Mum that Azkaban guards had just dropped Lucius off at the Manor and Draco and Narcissa
“How are you so fucking delicious?” I sighed, tongue returning to lap and tease at him, licking around and over his opening before pointing and pushing in, demanding entrance.
Malfoy merely chuckled and slung an arm over the back of his barstool, lifting his new pint to his lips.
the caviar-laden pancake, making sure to ‘accidentally’ lick and suck at Draco’s fingertips as I did so.
I watched, fascinated, as the dish scrubber magically began cleaning one of the large mixing bowls in the sink and the rag that Molly had just now set aside floated over to wring itself out in the other basin.
it and would throw an absolute fit when you couldn’t have it, which was positively dreadful when they weren’t in season.”
On her feet were scarily high heels that matched her jacket, which she, of course, strutted about in as though they were everyday trainers.
the Bludger again and scored, giving a whoop of excitement as he did a quick victory loop, sticking his tongue out at Charlie as he did so.
“Why don’t you let me worry about that, Malfoy?” he suggested silkily, mouthing along the side of my shaft as he did so.
There it was, almost mocking me, the way it was shimmering from the last spot on the last page of Harry’s apps, with all the other apps he’d downloaded and forgotten about over the past few months.
“If you decide that they should have some wizard money, whatever amount you decide will appear in the antechamber for them to pick up.”
However, Draco was smiling that smile as he seated himself, tugging at my hand so that I joined him on the blanket, still staring up at the iconic tower as he uncorked the bottle of champagne.
I tried to pretend like Harry’s words and actions had little effect on me, even though his knowing smirk said otherwise, and held up a fourth chocolate heart, this one a brilliant fuchsia and nicknamed the “pleasure” heart, the dark chocolate shell filled with salted pistachio praline.
When I had officially moved in a few weeks ago, Kreacher in tow, I’d nearly doubled over in laughter to discover that, instead of downsizing any of his massive wardrobe to make room for mine, Draco had merely added more space to his already enormous closet.
We were at the Leaky Cauldron on a stakeout, tracking a wizard named Christian Spencer who was a suspect in a recent security breach at the Ministry.
Harry flushed immediately, mouth working as though trying to respond but no sound came out, and Kitten, adorably, looked over at me, eyes pleading, as though I might help.
to tug gently at the plug embedded up his arse until it fell free, continuing to pull gently until Harry’s arse resisted against the first of the three balls.
“Merlin, Harry,” he sighed, arms wrapping around me as he dragged me up and spun me around, wrapping my arms around his neck as I all but collapsed against him, weak from the entire ordeal.
“I like you better with your hair like this,” I continued honestly, accepting the proffered tube of toothpaste and squeezing a bit onto the brush.
“Yes, but I think Draco has a point,” Williams spoke up. “There are tons of different types of love; for example, I love my family, I love my dog, I love this department, I love my partner. What I want, and what I would consider a satisfactory reciprocation of said love from each is a very different situation. Understanding what the suspect wants as their end-goal could be key.”
We’d just be sitting at the table, enjoying breakfast, or watching the telly, or reading, and suddenly I would look over to see Draco pulling the most random face and I couldn’t help but burst out laughing.
I could only pull his face down to mine and demand a proper kiss to go along with the brilliant fucking he was gifting me with down below.
entry date, the more obsessed and insane Ethel seemed, and I pondered this for a minute, looking at her word choice and syntax, noticing the noticeable change as time passed between entries.
Really, putting the small sofa along one side of the table had been absolutely brilliant of me. I’d only done it because I’d had a bunch of people over and not enough chairs when I’d first moved in, but had decided I loved it so much, it had remained.
“I’m the one who helped Harry figure out he wanted to work his way up to tame dragons, anyway,” Ginny explained grinning.
The conversation, naturally, turned towards the Erised case, all of us offering what juicy gossip we could.
It was something Alice insisted upon — that we not outright correct our children when they said something wrong, instead repeating it correctly so that they would pick up on the proper usage on their own and not feel like they were being constantly corrected.
“Where are we going, anyway?” he asked, shoving his arms through the armholes in his t-shirt then pulling his trousers back on.
“However,” he continued, mouth twitching into a smile at Charlie’s sheepish grin. “The addition of the lavender was all Draco’s idea.”
Really, they were both mine, but Harry had all but claimed the emerald green one, my favourite back at Hogwarts, as his own.
“You’d be bloody insatiable if you were your boyfriend, too,” he informed me, and I groaned at that, because no matter how many times you heard it, knowing that the man of your fucking dreams was just as mad for you never got old.
My boyfriend’s voice was keeping me from slipping back into dreamland, and I chose to ignore the quiet murmur of my name on his lips and pressed further into the warmth of his side and the blankets.
I glanced down at our empty pints, then back up at my cousin, asking if he had time for a third, and final, round.
“Good,” he replied with a firm nod, although he chose to keep his gaze focused straight ahead instead of turning his eyes up towards where I leant against the wall beside him.
Harry let out a wall-shattering cry, hips working frantically to pump his cock in and out of my fist, dragging himself over my desperately seeking mouth, slurping and lapping at his hole, his taint, his bollocks, whatever I could reach as he approached his climax.
Finally, a ball of brilliant white light appeared suddenly from the east, blazing clockwise around the circle until it had touched all four points, then sending a beam of light out from each point to shoot out of the tips of our wands, created a giant pillar of light in the centre of the circle.
“Well, clearly,” I agreed, lapping at him again, moaning at the positively addictive taste of him on my tongue.
“I suppose I’d never considered there might be such negative aspects to being so well-endowed,” he replied, unable to hide his giggle.
Harry, I noticed, somehow buried his face even more into Draco’s chest while his boyfriend joined in the laughter
“Are you honestly telling me you didn’t immediately fall in love with the charming, dapper eleven-year-old me?” he asked, pretending to be shocked, and I rolled my eyes and smacked him playfully.
“I.” Still, another kiss, and I was beginning to understand what was so fun about this teasing business.
I pushed him backwards, gently, moving with him, so that he was on his back, me settled between his thighs, those long, muscled legs circling up around my waist, pulling me closer, holding me tight against him so that I couldn’t have pulled away had I even been able to try. We were still kissing, uncontrollably, hands twisting through each other’s hair, pulling each other even closer, not that it was possible. Harry was groaning into me and I was drinking in every fucking sound he made like they were more precious than air.
Malfoy had already stretched his arms out towards MacKenzie, who had also leant forward just as eagerly, before he tilted his gaze upwards and glanced at Hannah, then Neville hesitantly.
“She said I was, even though I wasn’t,” Harry spoke up, eyes fixed on his mum and mine, a grateful smile on his face.
True, he was now the reigning Lord of Malfoy Estate. The most un-bastardly thing possible in our little, title-obsessed corner of the world.
, until stars literally exploded behind my eyes, and I felt Draco’s mouth working, my hips fucking frantically in and out of his mouth, as he swallowed all of me, my orgasm and my still-spasming prick.
He moaned against my hole, stopping the vicious tongue-fucking to, literally, kiss me in the most obscene and thorough manner, tongue swirling and dipping into me, licking and lapping inside of me, all while he was moaning and groaning so that I could feel the vibrations throughout my whole body.
“Drakey, we’re going to look for some books to start planning this fabulous little party you’ve been talking about,” Pansy drawled, heading down one of the rows of books.
That muggle bloke had appeared, practically out of nowhere, putting his filthy muggle hands all over Harry, and I had sensed Draco’s magic begin to spiral out of control almost immediately. That alarmed me. Feeling Draco’s magic.
“That unholy fucking mouth of yours wrapped tight around my dick with a giant, black dildo fucking in and out of that sweet, pink hole of yours. You begging for more.”
“Those are our seats,” he explained, pushing aside a red curtain to reveal two rows of counter space, each individual seat neatly partitioned off to offer maximum noodle-slurping privacy, with a simple stool sitting before it.
“No! It’s not that” Ron nearly shouted, standing up on his barstool and leaning towards Draco, arms waving in a non-verbal echo of his words.
Our surprise visitor was now staring into the cupboard, at the little mattress, wrinkled sheets, and makeshift living space Harry had carved out for himself as a child.
did… you talk to James as well? I don’t see anything in your report about him.” Draco frowned slightly as he thumbed through the rest of Williams’ report.
With that nutter locked away and awaiting trial, the Ministry was abuzz with talk of this growing movement demanding the end of the Statute of Secrecy as more witches and wizards
“And you, Harry?” he asked with a smile, switching between languages so easily, I wondered if he was like Hugo and had grown up speaking
I started and looked up to see Draco walk in, looking a little tired and rumpled after his late night.
I wanted to turn to Harry in disbelief and demand that he explain what the fuck he meant by that, but he was crazy if he thought I was taking my eyes off of Williams right now.
“Won’t feel half as good as you, I’d wager, but I’m sure it’ll be nice,” he mused, eyes still watching me, hand trailing down his chest and abdomen, creeping towards his dick.
Help him have his drink and send him on his merry way so that we could both find another Grindr partner to fuck.
The fucking wanker actually stepped off the bed and made as though he was headed to the bathroom to wash up.
Draco was gazing down at Alfie, eyes focused on Alfie’s as he knelt so they were eye level, a tiny smile crinkling at the corner of his mouth.
“What do you recommend?” I asked, perusing the menu, already seeing several items that looked tempting.
“I don’t know, Harry,” he sighed finally, hands releasing both my wrists and cock as he sat up beside me, clasping his hands together and raising his arms above his head as he arched into a stretch that would have made an actual cat fucking jealous.
“No,” I admitted, giving him a genuine smile and feeling bad about all of my griping. “That’s why I’m trusting you with this.”
Dinner continued, and then it was time for dessert, and I vowed to make a trip to this Waitrose place just for this dessert alone.
“So… I guess… do we do… this bise thing, too? I mean, we never have done before, but I don’t want you feeling left out.”
“Dudley was just telling me about the magical bursts his kids have. His eldest might be a Metamorphmagus… changed his hair blue and everything!”
Or maybe exactly like people did, because it was the people who inhabited these spaces who imprinted them with their own memories.
“In many ways, I know this ability has helped you. It would be impossible to have your level of Occlumency and Legilimency skills without it.”
“No, Hermione, I don’t know,” I snapped, taking a gulp from my own cup. “I don’t have a goddamn type, unless you mean incredibly fit and male. Those are really about my only requirements.” So The-Boy-Who-Lived turned out to be a bit of a slut. So what?
The International Confederation on Wizarding Crimes was… well… exactly what the title said, an organisation whose purpose was to aid in the solving of international crimes.
Hermione rolled her eyes, seeing right through my clever loophole, leaving myself open to taunt and tease our Harry about anything else under the sun.
A clearing for the bonfire stood off to the side with a smattering of chairs, blankets, and piles of cushions sprinkled around it for us to curl into and get comfortable as night fell.
I made a noise in the back of my throat at hearing my name and moved lower to lick and suck at his nipples, releasing his hands so they could tangle themselves in my hair.
“QUITCH!” Harry repeated excitedly, little hands reaching out to grasp the broom handle like the bloody natural he was.
She didn’t need to add that I, with my lovely family history, was probably a lead suspect in most minds.
“So spread open after being fucked by that dildo for the past Merlin-knows-how-long that your sweet little hole can’t even close properly.”
Another flick of her wrist and the tub filled with water and a variety of apples, and we watched, cheering as Teddy and Victoire, followed by Dominique, ran up to the tub, plunging their faces in immediately.
Somehow, my brain managed to wonder if Ron and I would find willing partners in Blaise and Pansy to hash out our aggressions regarding Hogwarts-era study-inflicted trauma.
He ran a hand down through my hair, stroking the back of my neck, sliding down my back as he knelt behind me, cock just barely grazing my lower back and I had to bite my lip to suppress a groan.
Blaise was worried about Ben’s reaction and clearly wanted the two of us standing by should Malfoy need our help.
“So why the full glamour at work?” I asked. “I don’t see why you would have gone through all the effort.”
“I,” he began, thrusting his entire length into me in one solid, fluid motion that had me keening and arching up into him, legs wrapping around his waist to pull him in as close as humanly possible.
“But back to our little game, Potter,” I whispered in his ear. “I’ve got you pinned against the wall in the Room of Requirement.
I’d seen several pictures on the internet of failed translations on menus, and although Chinese food seemed to have suffered most, that didn’t mean Japan couldn’t have a few fails as well.
?” I echoed, trailing my eyes over my father’s emaciated frame once more. “Please tell me that’s not your only excuse?”
He slid his chair closer to Blaise’s and leaned into him, pressing an obscene smack on his cheek, mimicking my greeting to Ron.
He sounded reluctant, so I leant forward again to wrap my mouth around the tip of his cock, tongue lapping into the slit.
“Very Euro-centric, you’re right,” I conceded, pretending to mistake the reason for Harry’s petulant scowl. “I’ll work on that.”
“And, I’m not sure my date’s had a chance to look at the menu, but I have a feeling he’d enjoy the treacle-cured seared tuna…”
"And yours, Lord Malfoy. Hawthorn, twenty-five centimetres,” Ollivander continued, smiling back at Draco, either choosing to ignore or not understanding Draco’s truncated joke that nearly had me in tears trying not to laugh aloud.
I can honestly say I’d never seen a more brilliant, genuine smile break over my son’s face, and I sincerely hoped he’d have reason to use Draco’s copper cauldrons soon.
Instead, I’d steeled my resolve and forced myself to leave his side, heading straight to bed, regretting the morning, when we would have to talk about it.
“He is young,” Toshio replied with a knowing smirk, one not unlike Draco’s own. “He just turned two.”
“You will close your eyes and open that pretty mouth of yours,” he continued, “and you will accept whatever I happen to put in there, and you will
“It makes sense,” Dudley shrugged. “If I ever found out someone treated Alice like that, and I could do that sort of thing, I’d do the same.”
He frowned as though it hadn’t occurred to him that not everyone made their own lube, and even I had to grin as I remembered that I’d always
“Her journals from before the app,” I replied, not really answering his question as I passed the first journal back to him and returned to my search through Ethel’s post-Erised journals.
“What sort of alcohol are you hoping for, Potter?” Pansy demanded, swishing her wand again, sending a glass of whisky with a giant ice cube into Draco’s hand.
I’d been relaxing on the sofa, flipping through the channels, when I’d noticed movement out of the corner of my eye.
“What, so then we’d still be in a relationship, and I’d still have to tell him I was a wizard, and he’d still freak out, and then I could just keep Obliviating him so it’d be like some sick real-life rendition of that stupid ‘
“Oh, yeah?” George countered good-naturedly, pretending to grab Micah back from Draco. “Who says she can’t
“Well, but, don’t… don’t… the benefits outweigh being caught with the odd random boner?” he asked between kisses.
“I still don’t understand why we’re here,” I pressed, following Draco, eyes still taking in the stalls and their strange wares.
“No, no,” the old man assured him with a reassuring smile before he gave a sort of smirk over at Harry.
We find out where Harry, Draco, Hermione, Ben, and Micah were taken to and finally meet our crazy stalker in person.
Damn, I wish I would’ve taken some pictures of him slumped miserably against the toilet later that night, then curled up, groaning pitifully, beneath the blankets the next day, declaring any light too much light.
“Harry and Draco know what they’re doing, and Harry doesn’t need us poking our nose into their business.”
“The thing about watching that memory, though,” he went on, leaning against the wall, facing me once more. “I think I learnt something.”
some decent jambon de Paris,” I continued. “So I was thinking a Gruyère to go with, unless you have another suggestion?”
Then she clapped a hand to her mouth, eyes widening as she glanced sheepishly around at Blaise, Fleur, then
“Spit it out, Potter,” I instructed, refilling my glass and holding the bottle up in his direction questioningly.
“No,” she barked, almost immediately, holding up a hand as both Draco and Harry opened their mouths to respond.
I’d only meant for it to be a brief kiss, but the combination of both our pent up sexual frustrations quickly overpowered any notion of self-control and soon Harry was whimpering pitifully into my mouth as I all but ravaged him.
My orgasm crashed through me like a fucking explosion and I positively screamed a string of utter nonsense as cum shot out of me, leaving long ropes splattered between us, one shot landing spectacularly on the underside of my chin.
Harry’s stomach let out a well-timed growl, as though backing up his statement, and we both giggled.
about subjecting me to a secret blowjob with Granger seated just across from me and I promise you, I will bend your sweet little arse over the railing overlooking the entry hall at the Manor and eat you out until you’re screaming so
There was an awkward pause as we continued setting the table, and I reached into the box to pull out the framed photographs of the dead that would
“I loved it,” I replied, already charmed by the man and his friendliness. “I had the one with pork belly.
“Mother-stupid dummy!” Manon parroted immediately, smiling adoringly at Pansy, causing several of us to giggle and Blaise to shoot Pansy a pretend glare.
Harry laughed and shoved at me playfully before turning back towards the wall, brow furrowing in concentration.
Harry had already explained to Alice and I that we’d need to exchange some pounds for Wizard money and also consider setting up an account at the Wizard bank.
A second text appeared with Apparating coordinates for all three locations, and I grinned up at Harry.
My attention snapped back to the situation at hand when I saw that Bones was motioning at us to get more details out of Williams.
“New favourite,” I continued between languid swirls of my tongue into Draco’s mouth, trying to get more of the addictive taste of him and upside-down French apple-toffee cake.
“It’ll all be fine,” he assured me, leaning down to kiss my temple as we made our way across the reception, and I smiled up at him, albeit nervously, as he reached a hand out to open the door.
There are several types of thought: thought that is belief, thought that is desire, thought that is intention.
“Oh,” I couldn’t even remember what scene had been outside last time I’d brought him here. Truth be told, I didn’t want to remember much of what had happened last time. “Yeah, erm, it’s just scenery from places I like,” I explained. “They change randomly. Kind of like a laptop screensaver.”
I must have looked shocked because Draco’s gaze flickered over to me and he offered me a reassuring smile.
Harry’s hands came up to wrap around my neck again, drawing me closer, and my breath caught as he tilted his head, anticipating his lips meeting mine.
“Harry,” he sighed, returning the kiss and dropping my hands, allowing me to tangle them in his hair as his own dipped into the waistband of my trousers to pull me even closer.
Of course, Malfoy didn’t comply. Merely kept twisting those long fingers inside of me as I twitched and writhed with need for him.
My next few bites were enhanced by dipping each strip of katsu into a teeny bit of the mustard, its spiciness helping to cut through the rich flavour of the pork.
decided the two winning photos were the one of Baby Harry squealing “QUITCH!” as he rode his first broom around the garden with his father and the one of Baby Draco taking that first blissful bite of cake before, in true Draco fashion, glaring accusingly at every adult in the room for holding out on him for an entire year.
He was sliding up and down my entire length now, my own hips rising to meet his as our bodies worked in tandem to bring us both to the point where we were nothing but moaning, sobbing messes, hands and lips seeking blindly to kiss and clasp and hold on to whatever parts of each other we could reach.
“Don’t mind that childish exchange just before you took off. Those two have been antagonising each other since lower secondary,” she informed Tristan, leaning towards him conspirationally.
“Not now,” he warned, hand pulling my mouth further from his cock, tilting my face upwards so that I could pout at him questioningly.
“The way you like to fuck me,” he added, eyes holding mine as he all but slithered his way back down my body.
He blinked up at me, then frowned, clearly returning to his overthinking brain, gears not having stopped.
I’m sure he almost walked out when Hiccup shot down the Night Fury – a completely made-up dragon, he
Draco leaned forward, eyes sliding shut, as his tongue reached out to swirl at the pre-cum pooling in my slit, pressing in hungrily.
“Now come on,” he urged, pulling me closer and brushing his lips against mine. “We need to wrap up your very first dinner party…”
Our walk and pedal around the lake burned up another two hours of wait time, and by the time we’d returned the swan boat, Draco insisted it was time for second breakfast.
“A friend, hmm?” he asked, grabbing a spinach wrap and smirking up at me and I couldn’t help but roll my eyes affectionately.
Then, from behind an overstuffed leather couch, a tuft of silvery-blond hair appeared, slowly rising until a teeny forehead was visible, and finally, a pair of peeping blue-grey eyes that popped open in surprise as my entire face jolted up above the arm of the couch, squealing with glee, before ducking back down.
“Probably… hopefully,” I responded to each of his questions, already texting home, following up with a second text to Pansy.
She returned my gaze with a knowing smile, little Alfie straddling her hip, as we arrived at our destination in front of the church.
“I’ll make sure Harry calls you,” Draco added, and then he and Harry disappeared without so much as a sound.
Draco sighed and withdrew, moving to lick and suckle at my bollocks, one long finger sliding into my spit-slackened passage, burying it to the hilt before withdrawing.
The wizarding community in Paris was definitely more forgiving of my last name than here, but I started exploring Muggle Paris, anyway.
,” I sniffed, straightening the sleeves of my jacket. “He looked downright heartbroken we didn’t get to see the end of the movie.”
“Ben loved this song,” Pansy spoke up, eyes flicking over to Draco who sighed. “Said it always reminded him of Draco.”
Green eyes locked on mine in the mirror and I managed to get a glimpse of my own eyes, so lust-blown they were almost black, before my attention snapped back up to Harry.
“Thanks, Molly,” Harry grinned up at her, then back at me as his fingers “accidentally” brushed along the tops of mine as we each grabbed for a Cornish pasty.
Hugo had sprung up from where he and Manon had been colouring on the floor and was already running towards the telly, which showed Harry striding across a stage set up for a press conference for the Magpies.
“I mean, don’t get me wrong,” I explained. “That much was obvious from seeing the two of you last night.”
Somehow we ended up in the tub, kissing, despite the fact both of us should have known damned well by now that kissing was a horrible idea.
We were busy assuring the Longbottoms they were more than welcome when another voice sounded behind us.
“No, Mum,” I snapped immediately, glaring one of my finest, real, no-fucking-around glares at Harry.
Suddenly, Blaise and Ron both paused, heads jerking upright as they both grasped their wands and hastily headed towards the door.
“Harry,” I murmured in his ear, watching as his eyes slid shut and his mouth gently plucked the remainder of the brownie from my hand.
Draco tumbled down on top of me, arms wrapping around me as we rearranged ourselves to get comfortable.
“Hello, Micah,” she greeted me with a smile and her thick accent. “You are enjoying your morning here, with these silly boys like everyone else?”
Had anyone ever told me that at some point in my life I’d not only be okay with a bloke all but using me as his chair back, but that I’d actually enjoy it… well.
look in Harry’s eyes — right before Voldermort had collapsed and died like the insignificant mortal he was.
It hurt, to be honest, although I knew Narcissa probably had no idea how deep my love for Dobby ran and certainly hadn't meant to cause any painful memories by providing the clip.
“I mean,” I tried again. “I’d rather not look like you’ve just ravished me before meeting my niece and nephews for the first time.”
his emerald eyes fluttered closed as his wicked mouth closed around the last spoonful, then flared open to meet mine in a challenge as his tongue darted out to sweep along that luscious lower lip of his.
“Poor Harry was on the verge of hyperventilating when he had to go off and talk to you on his own,” he added.
I wasted no time sliding a finger into Harry, groaning myself at how he was still so tight, quickly adding a second, then a third finger, listening to Harry moan his encouragement beneath me.
Picture, if you will, that nearly ubiquitous photo of every toddler with chocolate or candy smeared all around their face, staring up at their parents with that mixture of surprise, guilt, and oh-shit-how-do-I-get-out-of-this-mess.
I glanced at Harry, as did everyone else, seeing what his reaction to Draco’s rather callous description of Tristan would be.
I briefly thanked my dickwad father for having trained me to behave the gracious host in the most difficult of situations so that I could manage to ask:
Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed George heaving a Bludger at Ginny, who had the Quaffle and was making a beeline for the goalposts that Ron was defending, and I forced myself to keep my eyes trained on Harry.
Potter’s eyes slid closed, and he practically moaned, teeth pulling part of that delicious-looking, plump bottom lip of his into his mouth.
“We have wands,” Hermione assured us, pulling a slender piece of wood from her pocket. “Harry and Draco just don’t use them.”
“I didn’t exactly have a lot of time to get ready this morning,” he replied primly, taking a sip, eyes flicking over to me for a brief second before returning to the scenery outside.
He plummeted, suddenly, a good half-metre, before coming to an abrupt halt, an anguished scream ripping out of his throat.
“Ow! Fuck! Draco!” Blaise shrieked. “Fucking Merlin, ok, I’m sorry! Fuck! You like him. He’s wonderful. Mouth, arse,
I fumbled around for a bit, eyes blinking open and squinting against the light streaming in through the window, hand finally locating the vibrating contraption so I could see who was calling.
“So...” he began nonchalantly swirling his whiskey, looking every bit the aristocratic pureblood that he was, leaning against the bar.
“Um,” he paused and thought for a moment. “Indian. I’m too hungry to think about Thai. Too many choices.”
“No,” he argued, eyes flashing. “As wonderfully romantic and leisurely our trip has been thus far, might I remind you that we’re here on official Ministry business?
“He’s joined Blaise and me for a few,” he admitted. “He was fine. Bloody hilarious, actually. Witty bugger, that one.”
they do except that they work in one of four areas: love, thought, death, or time. And it’s all highly confidential, obviously.
Especially when celebrating the very last year of my twenties which had me feeling particularly old and unaccomplished.
I added a third finger and watched as it slipped in easily beside the other two and stifled a groan as I leaned forward to lick at that sensitive spot between his balls and his opening, following with a covetous suck to the delicate skin there, relishing in the moan that vibrated throughout Potter’s entire body.
I shook my head clear and focused on twisting and scissoring my fingers into Harry’s arse instead, twisting downwards and finding that spot where Harry arched his back and positively screamed.
The look Draco gave her would have positively murdered a lesser witch, but Pansy seemed as though she hadn’t even noticed.
“It’s none of your business, Ron,” Hermione assured me. “But Draco tends to take relationships very seriously. Harry, you’re not just in this for, well…
“We’re in the public bath,” he scolded, wrapping his robe around him, as though that might do something to hide his ridiculous erection from poking out.
“Draco,” I gasped, still chuckling. “Do you really think the fucking Dursleys were dressing me in prepubescent Burberry before I went to Hogwarts?
Draco and his mum were walking side-by-side, just a tad ahead of me, Narcissa busy telling Draco all about what had been happening at their chateau in the Loire Valley, and I took the opportunity to sneak my mobile out of my pocket to open the text Narcissa had sent me.
“Potter,” he said, sounding very serious. “You know that anything that is said, or that takes place here, doesn’t leave here, don’t you?”
Suddenly, the waves on his arm began to toss and heave, taking on the motions of a turbulent ocean where the fish struggled and flailed as it fought against the power of nature.
he sighed, eyes sliding shut, fingers withdrawing, as he lined himself up with my slackened hole and pushed in, slowly, but continuously, not bothering to tease and taunt as he usually did.
Harry all but beamed back at her as he dipped the little spoon back into the jar and lifted another spoonful to his lips.
Hermione and Draco had sat through the equivalent of nine and ten A-levels, respectively, told me which wizards I’d be pushing Callum to owl for help when his studies called for it.
On closer inspection, they were, respectively, a milk-chocolate-and-salted-caramel lollipop and several caramels for Harry, and a dark-chocolate lollipop with a small box of four premium chocolates for me.
I stared at him for a minute, watching his eyes trail over my body as he imagined my reaction to whatever it was he’d had specially made for me.
I could lick my way up Harry’s cock before sucking him down, intent on paying him back for the several, frankly, mind-blowing blowjobs he’d showered me with the past few days.
When Harry was practically screaming and bucking up against my hand with an urgency that almost matched my own, I finally withdrew my fingers and rose above him, lining my aching cock with his hole, the warm, pulsing heat of it working immediately to draw the tip of me inside, and, with a groan of absolute bliss, I slid in.
Blaise turned his head to give Draco a frighteningly murderous stare, and I gulped, wondering if maybe I shouldn’t have said anything.
“I wouldn’t have pegged you for a sunset-from-the-London-Eye sort,” I admitted, turning to face him.
with a kiss, and by the time I’d reached the end of the sentence, Harry’s hands were fumbling with my trousers, making quick work of the fastenings as he licked desperately into my mouth.
“Merlin, that was incredible,” I sighed, slinking into Draco’s side as we walked along the street. “How in the world are you going to top that?”
“I would say that obsession, just by its very definition, begins to remove actual thought from the equation, although the brain would still be very much involved,” I began, taking a brief pause to gather my thoughts.
“Potter,” I glanced over at Pansy who was gazing at me with absolute admiration in her eyes. “You are, beyond doubt, my new favourite person ever. Quit your whinging, Draco, you know you’re grandfathered in,” she added, not skipping a beat or even looking in Draco’s direction.
“A what?” Harry glanced over at me, puzzled. His voice was still raspy, and I realised it wasn’t just from sleep but also an aural reminder of just exactly what Potter had been up to for most of last night. For some reason, that pleased me to no end.
How I, inevitably, would have teased Ron and Ginny mercilessly, as I had about their robes, their schoolbooks, and their broomsticks.
I gave a shake of my head to clear my thoughts as we continued our walk around the park and checked my watch to see that it was nearly two pm.
Draco handed Alfie back over to me with an apologetic smile, and we made our way towards the smiling barman.
“I,” he gasped, staring up at me while biting that insufferable lip of his. “I,” he said again, gaze sliding down to take in the length of me.
Draco seemed just on edge as I was, thankfully, mouth fastening to mine, our tongues tangling almost frantically as Draco laid me back on the mattress, fingers fumbling at my entrance until he slid two deep inside, working them steadily to open me up before adding a third, twisting and seeking until he hit that spot, and I cried out, clutching him fiercely.
That was the nice thing about a second dicking. You didn’t, necessarily, have to waste your time going slow and could get to the actual fucking immediately.
I gave myself one last glance in the mirror, taking in my navy slacks, white t-shirt, and light blue cotton blazer. I loved that it was made out of almost a hoodie-like material, making it snuggly and comfortable without looking like an actual hoodie.
I didn’t get up to much, and certainly not with any blokes.” I pulled a face remembering my early, awkward attempts at playing het.
I could smell the fragrance in the bathwater, that same delicious smell that was Malfoy. Woodsy, sultry, with just the slightest hint of delicate rose.
like an opposite of Arthur Weasley, really – and I could only imagine the conversations they must have, both eagerly asking the other about things that seemed ordinary in their own worlds.
“You’re… everything,” I managed, mouth still moving against Harry’s, tongue still seeking his, and I almost missed the hitch in his breath as we finally gave in, mouths and bodies both crushed together as our tongues delved frantically into each other’s mouths, moaning as our bodies gave up their gentle, sweet slide against one another and began grinding urgently, demanding more.
I held it surreptitiously in my lap and tapped it lightly with my wand, murmuring an anti-Accio spell, then looked up at Draco, eyes sparkling in excitement, my smile only broadening at the worry that definitely flitted across his face as he and Pansy set the pints down.
Here, Hermione executed the perfect performance of a drunk person trying to straighten up, holding Ron at an arm’s distance.
A quick, horizontal laser of light flashed down the entire portal which, morbidly enough, was used to ensure that these three parts of me were attached to one, singular body and not being held up by two or three individuals trying to gain access.
He leant his head over to listen to whatever last-minute advice or warnings the Magpie’s Head Coach, Cormack McLeod, was offering him as he unfastened the button of his suit before taking a seat.
mine, right?” Ginny spoke up, frowning between Draco and George warily as Micah slung her arm around Ginny’s shoulder, still laughing.
Hermione was now thoroughly thrown off the “truth trail” and I now had a glimmer of hope that I was affecting Harry.
There was a sigh, and some rustling from the bedroom, and I looked over to see Harry sitting up, stretching his arms over his head.
The goblin brought us back to the reason for our roller-coaster ride as he dropped a tiny golden key into Callum, Violet, and Alice’s hands.
Pansy, Blaise, and I couldn’t help but snigger a little at Draco’s toddler moniker, and Narcissa even smiled sheepishly.
It was Friday night, and we had gathered again for weekly pints at The World’s End — which was quickly becoming our favourite spot — and I couldn’t help but shake my head and glance over at Blaise while we waited on our next round.
“Potter, if you wanted to plant your face in my lap so badly, you should have asked years ago, when I might have cared,” Draco drawled, and I realised that he had hexed Harry’s arm to fall.
We then snapped the prerequisite photo in front of Paris’ famous “sinking house”, sharing a sweet snog on the (forbidden) grass hill that created the optical illusion, and then another of Harry pretending
him,” Bill smirked as he sauntered up to the round table holding all the photographs, pausing before the photo of his younger brother and smiling softly.
“No, that’s not it at all,” he protested, hands stilling on my hips, urging me to continue grinding down against him.
I shot a glance at Harry, who had also snapped his gaze in my direction, both of us remembering the dinner party at their flat months earlier when we’d learnt that she had gone missing.
"I'm making- I'm ahead of time-" suddenly the idea of cooking at 3 in the morning did not sound so sane, "for you" he handed the plate to Malfoy and sat on the chair clutching his head wondering if he had gone mad while Malfoy stared at the plate, "Thanks" and eating noises were not what he expected.
He felt that childish frustration rise up at having to leave his comfort zone, he never thought Harry would be his comfort zone but in a way he always had been.
"You're so weak Malfoy, you can't even walk for a few minutes" Harry teased, "In fact if i remember correctly you were never athletic, which is why you lost every match against me"
He loathed him, loathed the easy way in which he had been dismissed, felt slighted, what do they think of me? tormented him, but the worst was that just as surely as Ron knew he was welcome here, Draco knew that he had no right to hate someone for being comfortable in their own skin.
Unless you were Harry Potter of course, having failed to save Narcissa from Azkaban, her wish was this :" please take care of Draco, you know how he is"
A feeling of remourse gripped him so strongly that he almost struggled to breathe, his weak fraggled nerves were oversensitized and immediately he decided to set it right for his own sake of mind.
That was the first and only apparation that didn't flip his organs, Later when Harry had left and the only thing that remained was the ghost of his warmth and that warm feeling in his chest that refused to go away.
The cold icy water was immediate relief, he let it run over his head and poor body swearing the sun could really cook your intestines if given the chance.
Something told him that he should have thought this through, an awkward shy feeling overcame him. Should he go and hug him? Yeah...that probably wouldn't do any good.
He felt like a thirdwheel, the arrival of a third party made him self conscious so he hid in his room, thinking about how Ron was talking to Harry.
In the middle of plating he realised his greatest folly- how would he make Malfoy understand this wasn't just any meal- it was an apology meal that he had made at 3 am which surely made it even more sincere.
"You can't even catch up with me-" with a scream Harry fled as Draco fake lunged at him, he ran after him even though he was way behind but atleast he reached the cottage soon in this way.
"Ok, ok, I won't wake him up" Draco exclaimed, getting out of the room but the house elf continued to pull him away.
There was a knock on his door and a redhead peeked in, "This is for you mate" Ron said awkwardly, as if he didn't know how to treat Draco, they had always treated each other with contempt, what had changed?
The cicada's were loud and sonorous but sweat gathered on Draco's neck and exhaustion was catching up to him, ice cream it turns out, did not sustain you for long.
He was currently most disturbed by the thought of leaving Harry alone to go to attend to his social services, the misserable reality of continuing this life for 3 years- 2 years of social services and 1 more year of living with Harry gnawed at him. He missed his friends, why hadn't they written to him? He didn't want to think about his parents rotting away in azkaban while he chased after Potter like a fool.
Children, they were strange, fast as lightning James had run back to them, Draco noted that he was done with his drama queen tears- and- pulling Scorpius's arm he tugged him along, "You can join us silly"he said, Scorpius laughed.
He patted the boys head, not knowing what words could make this better, he couldn't find any so decided to squat there in silence for as long as he had to.
His fingers gripped Draco tightly and he was doing his best to keep from making noises, though he failed, large fat tear drops streamed down his face and now Draco felt awful times 100, he had just chased off this kids to be friends and it probably felt so horrible, everyone walking out on you, so alone. Realising that no one wanted you.
It rung a few more times, "Coming!!" he yelled, what impolite, impatient people he was thinking as he turned the handle and was immedediately assaulted by the sight of bright smiles and on several little faces.
as if he was trying to prove a point Harry walked ahead, "You're in the mood to get beat up are you?" Draco teased back, "Beat?" Harry laughed histerically, looking back as Draco felt an irrational flush rise up his face (as if the sun wasn't enough heat), his green eyes caught the sun for a moment as he tipped his head back haughtily, still continuing to walk, still ahead of Draco.
Draco Malfoy stood outside his door, no luggage (it had probably been shrunk) and an Auror accompanying him.
Draco doubted he would ever feel so comfortable in someone's home, just knowing for a sure fact that you are welcome- and even if you aren't welcome you are still welcome.
"If you are so bored" Draco offered Harry a slice of peach, their eyes met, the sun caught his face in a warm embrace as if it too couldn't help itself, "Then go read something"  finished Draco. The moment was ruined and Harry blew a raspberry to let him know exactly what he thought of such a suggestion.
He was the teacher in charge of playtime and he soon discovered that it wasn't some easy sentence like he had thought, kids were, unsurprisingly, jerks.
And in that middle of the path- with grasses of the brightest green and wildflowers afar, the azure sky dotted with fluffy white clouds and the golden sun making everything shine- Harry grabbed his arm and pulled him close enough so he might feel his heat and apparated them.
Harry had made his first day of running after muggle kids, interacting with the staff members and the knowing glances of witches working there bearable.
They passed old sturdy sun damaged houses with wire fences every so often- but it was too easy to pretend that they were far away from the madding crowd, stuck in a children's book or a place such as Innisfree where the bees buzzed and the wide variety of bugs and insects took turns to raise a racket round the clock.
“Oh, Harry, you know what I mean,” I backtracked. “Ravenclaws are only going to think about the pros and cons and what concrete evidence they have to support both columns. And Slytherins, crikey. You’ve no idea. I’ve learnt a bunch working with Blaise. That lot. Cunning to say the least…”
like the Cruciatus, isn’t it?” she looked around at all of us, all staring back at her like bloody idiots, because what did we know about similarities between Obliviate and Cruciatus?
I moaned and attached my mouth to his, once more demanding a proper kiss which he, again, delivered beautifully, tongue delving into my mouth, swirling and teasing, inviting my own to play and tangle with his.
and lick and suck kisses down my neck and torso, each torturous drag of his lips and glide of his tongue against my skin causing me to squirm and moan or gasp as my hands moved to touch and grasp and plead with whatever parts of him I could reach.
He grabbed another olive, this time nibbling daintily at the morsel, tongue flicking out to catch any crumbs that remained on his lower lip.
Draco continued to eat his cake, staring at me icily, and I was torn between a sudden, simultaneous desire to strangle him and burst out laughing, knowing full well where my son had learnt this particular skill of eviscerating someone with his eyes, although, I had to admit, in this particular instance, the pupil had nearly surpassed the master.
Or even where it was in that giant country of theirs, although I had a vague recollection that it was maybe somewhere south?
“You already told me you wanted it slow,” I reminded him, fingers dipping slowly into him, twirling as they slid all the way in, working again on the slow slide out.
“I didn’t quite catch that,” I continued, standing slowly, holding him close as he all but slid down my body, legs detangling from my waist to land gently on the floor.
Idiot Gryffindor, I thought, kissing his temple again as we landed before a teeny alleyway, the area so crowded no one even noticed our sudden appearance, although I suspected this was also due to some sort of complicated disguisement charm.
“Or, my version of shit?” he questioned, trying to figure out his wording. “I don’t know, there’s an insult in there somewhere, Potter. Please, take it as such.”
“Just a drop,” Draco defended himself. “Just enough to heighten your senses a bit and make you tingle all over.”
“I’m on it,” my cousin assured her, reaching out to pull the children a bit closer to him. “I’ll bring them back to Muggle London right now.”
Don’t get me wrong, I noticed other good-looking people, both men and women, but never really bothered to examine them closely.
“I know,” she responded, blowing the smoke away from me, everything about her tone, expression, and posture, telling me that she most certainly did not believe me.
"But that guy can't" James said pointing at Draco, brats, thought Draco. Brats the whole lot of them.
Harry gave him an unimpressed look and they made homeward, surely it was illegal to walk so openly in such a frighteningly bright day but oh well, Harry made it bearable.
Draco regretted giving it up, and Harry hadn't even bothered to think that Draco was probably tired from work and being extremely pale- was sensitive to the sun, if only he could die temporarily then Pottah would learn his lesson.
Somehow it felt worse now after forgetting his position for a few sweet hours. But he had known all along- he had decided to accept the small drop of honey in exchange for bee stings.
"Hey you" he wondered if he sounded too threatening for a kid, but the boy was not disturbed, "me?" he smiled, looking around his peers.
The boy's name was Scorpius. A shy, awkward, smaller than he should be kid who Draco had overlooked on his first day of social services, Draco didn't really have a problem if the kid kept to himself. It would mean less work for him "whats wrong?" he asked, squatting down.
"Wait! Malfoy!- wait for me Draco!" he turned around to see Potter running after him, a knapsack and straw hat in hand, huffing and puffing he leaned in and placed it neatly over Draco's hair- that touch - if you could call it that- spread from the tips of his hair to his whole chest, the painfulness of being thrust out of his comfort zone was bearable, the fresh county air that he associated with the lower class seemed sweet- and it was so easy to think that the flush in Harry's face was there for him- because of him.
He clutched the crying boys arm and walked over to the accused, feeling sort of awkward- was he gonna give them a stern lecture? what if they started hating him? was it wrong to interfere in a kids fight?
Scorpious was apparently overcome with joy at the sight of Draco and insisted on being picked up, Suzan and Draco chatted a bit at the door, he told her that he was taking care of his sick roommate, she again apologised for intruding.
Satisfied, he left Harry as he had found him, determining that he would make it through the next couple of hours without Draco's supervision. He shut the door quitely and toyed with his mostly useless wand, it had been restricted to the point that a weaseley's wizarding wheezes wand was more useful. And more entertaining.
Should I wake him up? he thought. but decided to linger instead. after a while, he grew bold and drew close, so he may admire the soft cheeks and fluffy hair up close.
If he knew anything about Harry he knew that the man didn't take well to being babied- well- he just didn't like it once he knew he was being babied- because (from Draco's point of view)he had been completely fine being spoilt by Dumbledore and Hagrid and everyone else.
This vision clutched him and he stared wide eyed, his emotions stronger than his weak body could bear. His nerves were irritated and frazzled and he couldn't bear it anymore so he pretended to go back to sleep. He was breathing heavily but it didn't seem to reach his lungs.
It hurt, as if someone were poking at a blister, but Harry gave up his seat, James settled himself on Harry's lap and started playing with his hair.
Even in her last moments she had thought of her son, respecting her wishes, he had interfered as far as he could.
Huge auburn eyes shone golden in the afternoon sun, surprisingly gentle fingers patted his hair down. Harry somehow felt it soothing, the little hand touched his scar, "THATS SO COOL I WANT ONE!!" he yelled without warning, startling Harry, "What is it?! what is it James?!" Yelled Scorpius from Draco's arms and lunged towards them, almost  falling.
He really had misjudged how his life would pan out, a few weeks ago it had seemed hopeless to live, now there was only Potter.
He watched Draco's thin bony hands peel peaches, they were kind of knobbly and pale with visible viens. This rough look made them even more attractive and handsome in Harry's opinion. He was also beginning to think calling someone's hands handsome was definitely some kind of creepy behaviour, but he wanted to eat them if he could. t-the peaches, not his hands.
Nevertheless he walked into the cool cottage (thank god for small mercies) and again took his ice shower, coming downstairs he found a fruitbowl waiting for him, perfect for this summer heat.
After trying to see when exactly the light went off too many times, he decides thats enough playing, he's in a good mood so he decides he- Draco Malfoy the third- would be generous and cook something, he could imagine it- Harry would come into the kitchen and he'd be surprised, he'd be gratefull, he'd look at him with adoration.
Draco left to school alone that day, somewhat dissapointed that Harry hadn't offered to come with him but his pride (and shyness that he hid so desperately with scowls and harsh words) refused to ask Harry to drop him there, he wasn't his girlfriend.
Knowing sleep would alude him, he got out of bed, put on his glasses and suddenly- everything was clearer, the surfaces reflected the moonlight beautifully. He picked up his lavender tea and made his way to the kitchen, intending to dispose of it- when he saw uneaten dishes laid out on the table, one for him, one for Malfoy- neither one had been touched, Malfoys seat was a bit askew, like he had sat down and waited and waited and finally given up and gone to bed.
i have exams coming up and holy shit am i underprepared. I'm hoping to be on a regular schedule after my exams are over!!
With this he left, walking to his room on the ground floor, it was located at the farthest end of the house, just beyond the kitchen, overlooking the knolls.
As he went upstairs and Harry watched him go, Harry smiled, there was something endearing in his petulant silence.
"I" hiccup, "Told you so" more crying. (So young and already using 'told you so'? Draco thought unkindly)
He placed his hands near Harry's head to balance himslef and leaned so his face was directly above Harry's, he examined the textured skin resembling a piece of drawing paper. He wouldn't be surprised if Harry turned out to a beautifully painted portrait, his eyes grew bigger and bigger, memorizing this moment.
It was a quaint and beautiful place, somewhat small, Harry took him to his favourite bakery, he showed him the tea shop, the library and ice cream parlour where they each bought a popsickle "Its on me" Harry had said, digging into his knapsack and Draco was greatful because he still hadn't wrapped his head around the muggle money system. the cool treat brought back memories of summer spend with friends, Harry shielded his eyes from the sun with a hand, "its really not letting up" he said, lips wrapped around his popsickle- eyes on the azure sky.
He unpacked his stuff, carefully taking out his clothes- the least grand that he could find- and folding then in the closet. His mind wandered to what social services he'd have to do-- help out at the local kindergarten it said.
And why shouldn't he enjoy these little things that brought him joy if life was guaranteed to be filled with dissapointments and depression? why shouldn't he snatch this moment and indulge if he would have to pay for these feelings regardless?
Some apprehension siezed him as he gripped the cool metal of the door handle with his sweaty hands but he shook it away and opened, "Potter-"
He was offering a plastic bag od what looked like meat buns, Draco, feeling even more awkward accepted it with a thanks, he expected Ron to go away after that- and probably tell everyone what a sight Draco was, but instead the redhead shuffled his feet awkwardly, "Can you make sure he-" He stopped midsentence and looked away, "Can you make sure he doesn't do anything reckless?"
Harry was dressed as he had been when they'd arrived, the Knapsack still with him and he was sleeping heavily, arms in cactus  position, half of his legs dangling off the bed.
HEY! sorry i was late in uploading it, this girl right here tried to finish two months of assignments in two days ಥ‿ಥ
They were seated at the kitchen table the wide glass sliding doors had been opened to let fresh air that smelled of the sweet flowers blooming and fruits ripening in their garden in.
Glancing at the sleeping Harry (Now moved to the couch) and finding no encouraging nod, he steeled himself and went to open the door.
Even that sight was tolerable to Draco, the woman leaned forward and whispered, "He doesn't realize lunch isn't technically skipping classes"
He didn't examine his feelings, he didn't bother to question them, he didn't try to stop it and most certainly- he never thought of if Harry felt the same.
He searched  everywhere except for Harry's room, oh my god, Draco said in his head, he's probably taking a shower, I'm so dumb.
Draco was 80% sure the elf was high on something cause Harry didn't look like an invalid, Harry looked like....Harry.
Draco could spot the face of a man begging for a favour when he'd rather put his head in the toilet. Draco knew because he'd been there, "Of course"
he didn't know where that had come from but he was gonna have a good long talk with his mouth on the importance of filtering thoughts before saying them. ("but thats the brains job!") currently however he waited awkwardly for Harry to respond.
He didn't even want to be with Potter, he was just surprised and grateful that he could feel such things after all the years of torment. It really did a number on you to be surrounded by murdering psychopath's and be forced to hurt his peers in a way he never wanted to.
"Look, what did you do to this kid?" Draco asked, trying for a soft voice, the boys eyebrows furrowed in confusion, "I didn't do anything"
When Harry woke up he was still under the impression that it was the night and he has just fallen in for a 5 minute nap, the extreme silence and orchestrial harmony of the insects soon made him believe he had fallen asleep without meaning to.
the moonlight lit his room brghtly, his open window invited in the cool night air, ever welcome in this summer heat, his eyes fell on the cup of tea he had requested forgotten and cold on the table, he wondered if Draco felt like it, forgotten by everyone, or worse- that Harry thought him unfit to eat with, these thoughts distressed him greatly- he never wanted to make another person feel the way the Dursleys made him feel- inferior.
The war over and done with, death eaters were put to azkaban, those that escaped the sentence would be on probation and living with an Auror for 5 years, this rule was strictly enforced.
Draco would be a father and he'd visit Harry sometimes, for the sake of the strange friendship they had formed.
"You're room is upstairs, I'll get started on dinner, make yourself at home" fuuuck why did I say that, it sounds like I'm telling him to go to his room, and not to mention I sound like a maid! All this Harry thought in private, but relaxed as the tension from Dracos shoulder disappeared.
He wanted to stop these thoughts but they repeated themselves, breaking own into tangents and making him miserable, he paced rooms, he needed a distraction- to unlearn how to think-
Harry welcomed them in, the Auror refused to come in for a cup of tea and bade them farewell meanwhile Malfoy stood, looking quite out of place in his little cottage.
Harry would become an uncle to his kids, a bitter uncle. He would spend all his time in an endless cycle of considering cutting himself off from Draco- would stop himself in the nick of time and the short bursts of happiness from his company would choke him in its bitter residue.
