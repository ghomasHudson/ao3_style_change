He felt something tugging at his arm.
“She visited us yesterday and she saw you in the corridor” provided Hermione “apparently she was not impressed with your weight. She says you’re so thin you could dodge raindrops”
“About that...”
When he finally sat in front of a simple dinner composed of hot steamed potatoes and cheese, he finally allowed himself to take a look at his phone.
Harry didn’t answer, trembling with want and desperate for release.
.” Al affirmed.
“Nothing” the young woman frowned. “You?”
“So if you’ll have us, we plan on helping anyway we can even if it means raiding Malfoy Manor or give the finger to Shacklebot when he asks what the hell is going on.” She paused and studied him. “As far as I’m concerned, it’s the least we can do not to let you handle things on your own this time.”
Draco crept out of his room and knocked lightly on the door with his knuckles. The imprecations stopped.
“Yes” answers Harry, lying through his teeth “So, have you ever been with… you know… women before?” he asks to distract Draco and because he’s curious. The tall blond chuckles.
“Different?”
Something snapped inside Harry at the sight, he couldn’t wait any longer. With a flick of his will, he slicked his hands, stroked his cock once then covered the blond’s body with his and positioned the tip of his slippery cock on the hot entrance. Worrying Draco’s neck with his teeth he asked hoarsely:
“Draco, I need you, I need you now…” says Harry in that same frantic, urgent tone, pressing his hips against Draco and tilting his head back.
“I think I’m in love with you”
worth it.”
“You could have died” Malfoy pointed out with a cold tone and an indecipherable look. Harry shrugged. He was tired of justifying the course of his actions. He was tired of a lot of things.
“Did Malfoy mentioned another property they might have in Britain, anything?”
They all clinked their glasses and laughed good-naturedly, all tension forgotten.
“Why does it always have to be the weirdest people, though? You’re a freak magnet, you know that?” said Ron, the gin starting to make his tone a bit approximate.
“I can’t wait to see Ron’s face when he knows” he laughs.
“Do you?” Said Harry cynically, a disillusioned smile stretching his lips. Draco gaped. The git was just clueless.
“Do you want coffee or te-“ Draco turns to face him and stops mid-sentence. The mug he was holding crashes on the floor, projecting tea and broken pieces of porcelain everywhere but not one of them moves.
The elf had insisted only Draco was to be delivered his urgent message and refused to say any other word in Harry’s presence. But the Auror didn’t let go that easy. He quickly performed all the tests he could think of to ensure the elf hadn’t received the instruction to bring Draco back at the Manor and that he meant him no harm before letting him alone with the tall blond. A few minutes later, Draco got out of the study, alone, ashen-faced.
“Unless you want to shag in the hallway, I suggest a strategic move towards the nearest workable horizontal surface”
“Well, you can go back to your office, you’ll receive a memo with all the details in the hour. Dismissed.”
Draco nods and feels silly at the wave of relief that crashes over him. He doesn’t get up from the couch, not trusting his legs at the moment.
Harry smiled.
“Anyway, what are
“I’ll watch over him” assured Southwell. With a grateful smile, Hermione got up and followed Ron.
“Wass’dat smell” said Harry’s voice, a raspy sound that sent shivers in Draco’s spine.
Harry looked at the peace offering and the sharp pale face dubiously, trying to detect any traces of malign intent in the Slytherin’s demeanor.
When Draco comes back to his office after an excruciating meeting with colleagues on the sodding budget –said meeting standing as the crown jewel of the three shittiest weeks he has had in a very long time- his mood isn’t exactly at his best and he would be happy to hex anything on sight. Instead, he takes measured intakes of oxygen and curses inwardly all those sodding bureaucrats that have obviously way too much free time on their hands while he marches to his office in the dark corridor.
He wandlessly banished the offending pieces of fabric between his hands and Malfoy’s skin and was rewarded by a low wanton moan. The Slytherin ripped his fly open and his cock sprang free, twitching and desperate for attention. The long fingers wrapped around the hard length, Harry groaned deeply and his hips stuttered from their own volition.
“Fuck off” said Harry, an icy-cold fury colouring his tone.
“I’ll go first, cover me” murmured Harry and strode to the old building before anyone would attempt to stop him.
On a warm Tuesday night, he’s on Harry’s couch at Grimmauld and tries not to bite his nails down to the quick. It’s not a resounding success, to be honest.
When they settle again on the bed in each other’s arms, a devilish smile appears on Harry’s features.
How late was it? Did he just come home from work?
Wild emotions swarmed through Draco.
“Could’ve used your wand…” Draco grumbled and rummaged through the cupboard, finally finding what he was looking for.
And here he was, thinking he was finally done with the save-the-world kind of jobs. A three-year reprieve and off you go. But it was more than that. There was a time when he would have been happy and excited to get up for work, no matter what. But Harry had trouble remembering the last time he didn’t groan or sigh when his alarm went off in the morning. And it wasn’t about conniving bosses, boring cases, bad shifts or overtime. When had he started to hate his job? When did everything start to feel this meaningless and foreign to him? Was this what he was supposed to look up to for the rest of his life?
They were both sitting on the rug, their arms encircling their knees and looking at the fire.
“Harry” he said with a soft, hesitant voice.
“No you don’t. Not really. Once you see what you signed up for, you won’t.” he sighed. “That’s why I was so mad at you, I guess. You made me believe for a second that…” he laughed darkly and shook his head. “Just forget it.”
Harry Apparated home in a rush. He had just the time to take a shower and head for Ron and Hermione’s for dinner. He frantically climbed the stairs and jumped under the shower, banishing his clothes and filling the bathroom with a heavy pine-scented steam. When he wrapped his towel around his waist he froze. Harry cursed himself: he had forgotten to tell Draco. The Auror apparated in his bedroom, threw on some clothes –a deep-blue t-shirt with a pair of faded grey jeans and a black hoodie- and apparated on the first story landing, hair dripping wet and glasses still steamy. Harry politely knocked at Draco’s door. The tall blond opened and Harry blinked, taken back.
“I have to say, Briccius’ men are truly artists in their domain. I’ve always found it pleasing to watch an artisan at work” said Lucius pleasantly as if he was talking about pottery and not looking at his only son being sliced up while heavily bleeding on the Persian rug.
A distinct moan came from the room, then another. Harry froze. Then quickly realized that if Draco was indeed dreaming, it didn’t seem unpleasant at all, rather the other way around. He heard another unarticulated sound escaping from the sleeping Slytherin. Equal measures of shame and lust swarmed over Harry. He couldn’t stop listening to the torrid sounds, fascinated, and pictured the blond trashing wantonly in his bed, his marmoreal skin covered in a thin veil of sweat. His blood was roaring in his veins.
“What, she’s not pure enough for a bigoted prick like you?”
“Oh, I didn’t know you were looking for a roommate!” exclaimed Hermione, perplexed.
“So we just barge in guns blazing?” asked a senior Auror sporting metallic grey hair in a strict haircut that reminded Harry of American action movies from when he was a kid.
Harry took a sip out of his cup and looked thoughtfully at the dark and steaming liquid in his mug.
“So you won’t even try to escape or something? I’m sure your parents still have contacts, right?”
“Oh yeah? About what?”
Soon, Draco will see him in the glass and the spells will crackle on the tiled walls. Water will be everywhere; sullied, reddened by blood and as cold as death. Harry is trapped. He can’t move, he can’t breathe. Something dark is coming and he feels helpless. He can’t stop it. He couldn’t back then and he still can’t.
“Well, actually, I would say that my teenage self would’ve been quite smug about it and not so horrified…”
Draco avoided her hazel warm eyes and searched for his words.
“Yeah, she definitely could” Harry agrees, overwhelmed by pride mixing with the pleasant buzz of alcohol. Turns out bazillion-pints-Harry is a happy sentimental sap too.
In front of them, they could see a dilapidated wooden cabin in a clearing overrun by weeds. The worm-eaten door was hanging on its hinges pathetically. There was an eerie feel about the wild stretch of land, as if everything was holding its breath.
“I like your hair” finally said Luna with a luminous smile.
“Hi, Neville” said Hermione and Harry waved enthusiastically at his friend to greet him. He pushed back the jolt that caught him off guard when he saw a glint of light shining on pale blond hair in the crowd. The wizard was shorter and broader than Draco and his dark eyes had nothing to do with the silvery-cold-warmth of the Slytherin’s.
“Are you aware of the fact that you look like you’re melting on the floor?”
For a second, Harry is tempted to say yes but if it’s the only time he can have this, Harry wants to take anything he can before it’s over.
“Merlin Draco… You’re so beautiful…” he whispered feebly. The Slytherin came closer and Harry’s eyes fell between his hips, to the twitching flesh that demanded his attention. Draco was already painfully hard and impossibly aroused, he wondered how long he was going to last at this rate. The raven-haired wizard seemed hypnotized by the sight of his pale and hard flesh.
Hermione sighed and muttered under her breath but they all raised their wands and followed him.
“K… Potter sent me to work with you on the series of projects for the Auror Bureau.”
He collapsed on his back and took greedy gulps of air, waiting for the black spots in his vision to subside. Harry feared he was about to faint.
They took a seat at a corner table, Draco sitting opposite his mother and facing the door to avoid any unpleasant surprise.
“She will join us in the atrium in a few, I think she’s gathering gear”
“Don’t start. You owe me nothing” said Harry in a dark warning tone.
Ron ignored her then scattered the Aurors around the hill, encircling the castle.
“Don’t mention it” said Ron evenly.
“Ready?”
“How? Sorry, mate but what if Draco just got fed up and bailed to France or the Cayman islands?”
” there was metal in her voice and gaze, Draco had never seen her like that.
“Mmh?”
“No, she just happens to possess the wrong appendices for my liking”
“Sir, his life is in danger as we speak, we must do something”
“So, here is the thing…” started Hermione.
“This is a story I absolutely
“I bet”
“Don’t worry, really, I’m fine. Nothing I already-” but he trailed off when Draco opened the door completely and saw the state he was in, his jaw dropping at the scene.
“So. You’re drunk again. Is it a habit of yours? And if so, how are you so obviously inept at it?” he chuckled.
She got up to talk to Ron about the ton of paperwork they would need to fill.
“NOTHING!!! I’M A BLOODY COWARD, REMEMBER???” Draco slammed both his hands on the oak table and stayed there, his furious rictus facing Harry’s. They were both panting and glaring at each other, trembling with rage.
“What would an adventurer need a whip for?” asked Draco, lost to the concept of Muggle movies and Harrison-Ford-based badassery.
When they got back in the kitchen, Luna was curled up in a seat near the fireplace, her knees pulled up against her chest. She was cuddling with the red and gold snake and they both gazed at them with a look so eerily similar it made Draco uncomfortable.
Draco’s breath is as shallow as his and his eyes widen then shut when he slips one of his hands through the silky white strands. He’s beautiful, all cutting planes and a razor-sharp jawline Harry wants to lick. His lips are full and barely parted; Harry is transfixed by the plush flesh so close, so edible. When his lips press Draco’s, it’s a very destabilizing and dizzying experience. After a surprised gasp, the blond kisses back slowly, sensuously and Harry is lost. His borrowed body responds merrily and waves of desire crash through him, making him fell apart.
Malfoy took a sharp breath but said nothing. From the corner of his eye, Harry could see he was struggling to keep his composure.
“No way, you were brilliant” said Harry happily. And Ron’s shy smile warmed him inside.
“I know, I know” said Ron, looking aghast and worried.
“Harry, I need you… I need you now” he murmured lowly and rose slightly on his knees. The dark-haired man understood the message. Without a word, he aligned himself with the slick entrance and gasped at the hot contact, shutting his eyes closed. Then with a slow thrust of his hips he breached the tight ring of muscles and a deep groan escaped his lips.
His skin is golden and marred by dozens of silvery marks that trace his tumultuous history. Potter has filled out over the years; he now has a strong body with a taut and wiry musculature that replaced the scrawny figure of his adolescence. He’s still sharp though and his body possesses a rugged sort of beauty that transfixes Draco.
“Are you serious?”
The two Aurors arrived in front of Eveleen’s desk a moment later and asked for a minute with Catesby, stressing the utmost urgency of the situation.
“I see.” said Draco amusedly “Still, you should get back to bed before you pass out on the sofa.”
Potter frowns and an anguished expression paints his features.
“And I have something to tell you both.”
Peering through his eyelashes, Draco tried not to reveal he was conscious yet, hoping this could turn at his advantage somehow. He could see his cloak at his feet, laid in a heap of dark fabric. The light was dim but the small room looked like a cellar of some kind.
“I don’t care about your inbred-pure-blooded point of view, Malfoy” said Harry, eerily calm before his magic flew from his wand and engulfed Malfoy in dangerous flames that warmed the room instantly.
“Then take me, Potter” provoked Draco.
Harry starts to like the way Draco is always trying to be carefully detached about everything but slips more and more. Or maybe Harry is just getting better at getting a read out of him.
He looks at him intently but seems to flinch at what he sees on his face.
“The guy had sodding Voldemort at the back of his head” exclaimed Harry forcefully, stretching his arms away from his torso in a disconcerted gesture.
“Geez” whistled Draco. “So you were the brains of the operation then?” he eyed Hermione with praise.
“No. I just needed to at least tell you” he pauses, as if hesitating for what to say next.
Malfoy drew his legs against his chest and rested his arms on top of his knees. His gaze roamed on the room, studying the decor and trinkets that were the only things left from the Potions Master. His patrician features were heavy with grief.
“In that case, I shall miss your impressive stamina and that scandalous filthy little thing you did earlier with your tongue” Draco purred while stretching languorously like a big white cat.
“Woah woah woah, stop right there! I don’t want to know anything about my best friends’ sex life, thank you very much! I’m scarred enough as it is” exclaims Harry.
Draco smiled embarrassedly. “Thank you Luna” he said politely “you look great too”. She beamed at him and caught his hand in her tiny fist. “Happy Birthday! Harry wanted us to have a little dinner together to celebrate, that’s why I’m here!” she smiled again.
The Slytherin brusquely turned him around, making him kneel on the couch with parted legs, his hands clutching the backrest.
“Shut up, Malfoy” his stare fell on Malfoy’s lips. They were full and paler than his. Harry suddenly wondered what they would taste like. He shook himself internally. What the fuck?
“Harry” Draco cuts him off firmly “Just shut up.”
Lucius, on the other hand, had reignited the old ways and forged previous and new alliances. He had found strong support in Eastern Europe, especially in old families like the Hungarian prestigious House Báthory. For hundred of years, they had been kings and princes of the Hungarian Empire until muggles started to rebel and the International Statute of Secrecy marked the end of their glory.
With a creaking noise, the door opened slowly and a slim figure slipped inside the dark room. Harry immediately tensed and raised his wand but the intruder didn’t seem to realize he wasn’t alone. There was something familiar about him. A glimpse of moonlight caught on a flash of platinum hair and Harry realised with a jolt who was standing there. The tall wizard closed the door and leaned against it, unaware of Harry's sitting with his back against the stone wall in the shadowy part of the office.
“I take it that dinner wasn’t really peaceful?” finally asked Draco with an even tone. He was standing on the other side of the table with a steaming cup of tea in his long pale hands, looking at the hearth. Harry took the cup that had been silently placed in front of him and gulped absently, burning his tongue. He cursed under his breath.
“I’m far from over with you, I will unveil your secrets” he says ominously, in a low tone and Harry’s chest shouldn’t flutter like that at the implications of the word “unveil” in Draco’s mouth. A tinge of panic rises inside him and he all but flees from the office.
“That’s it, I’m retiring” muttered Ron.
Harry gripped the long thigh and bit Draco’s shoulder with a growl then retaliated by fisting the pale cock tightly in his hand without moving. The white-blond hissed in pleasure and started thrusting in the firm grip then pushing back on Harry’s cock, making the raven-haired man pant.
Lucius was seething, his blood like acid in his veins behind that cold mask of contempt he was so good at putting on. He had spent months, years to rebuild the reputation and fear around the Malfoy name. His disgrace among Death Eaters had been a hard thing to overcome. During the War, the family name had become a joke, something unworthy and degrading. After Voldemort’s defeat, nothing but the fortune he had cunningly managed to retain had kept him out of Azkaban. But he had spent most of its remainder in a new varnish over the Malfoy name and a strong network in the Ministry, gaining favours, offering obscure services and making new contacts without neglecting his old friends, of course.
“Are you telling me you never had sex before?”
“I did, that’s the only reason you’re not currently being force fed. But it won’t stop her long.”
“Yeah, Potter does have a way of complicating things, doesn’t he?” he smiles gently “I’m not judging, mind you, it would be utterly hypocritical of me…” Draco chuckles softly “I used to hate him” he adds pensively.
“You know what, I actually forget sometimes. You’d think by the time I would be used to it but-” he shook his head with a serene smile, looking around him “sometimes it just hits me.”
“Can’t you tell her I’m swamped at work?”
“We’re in Dorset. I reached out to Oliver Wood and arranged to book the Puddlemere pitch for the day. It’s heavily warded and as far as he’s concerned, I’m just practicing for the annual Quidditch competition of the Auror division with colleagues. I thought you must have been going mad, trapped inside the house all these weeks.”
“May I help you?” Malfoys says and cuts through his bleak reminiscence, catching Harry off guard.
“What happened? Last time I saw you two, you looked happy.”
“Draco, he will try to trick you into leading him to the Potter boy. Do as he says and save yourself. I trust you’ll find a way to evade your father, you have to.”
Draco had no answer for his disarming openness.
Holding a wooden spoon awkwardly, Draco said hesitantly:
Harry suddenly looked up and Draco jumped away from the window, flattening himself against he silken-clad wall, heart racing and feeling ridiculous. Ashamed by his very inappropriate scrutiny and his obvious arousal he cursed himself and closed his eyes, trying to banish all images of the half-naked and roughly handsome Auror from his mind but it was as if the taut silhouette had been burned inside his eyelids.
place, you don’t have to keep your friends away on my account…”
Harry growls again and grips Draco’s thighs, hard.
The Aurors nodded as one, grim determination painting their features. Harry couldn’t help but fell a swelling pride for Ron. That’s what he was born to do. The raven-haired man exchanged a happy look with Hermione and reported his attention on the briefing.
The insides of the cabin were as miserable as it looked from the outside, all broken furniture and creaking floorboard. But it appeared empty.
“I gotta go” he said brusquely and stormed out, leaving Draco alone with his fury.
But as curious as Draco was, he didn’t have the patience to remain focused on his inspection longer, his blood was drumming in his ears and his lips were still tingling and swollen from their tumultuous kisses. He turned back to Harry with a ravenous stare. In one step, Draco was on him. The tall Slytherin kissed him again and tugged at the hem of his shirt. Draco pulled the offending piece of clothing over his head and his hungry eyes raked on the tanned and powerful torso. God, the guy was hot, thought Draco in a haze.
“He did what???” she squeaked, scandalized, then pinched the bridge of her nose tiredly. “Why am I not surprised?”
Lucius’ genuine, blood-curdling laugh resonated in the room. The insane grey eyes that looked so much like Draco’s and were so different at the same time fixated on his, cold and calculating.
Narcissa shut her eyes close tightly, ridden by violent emotion. When the icy-blue orbs opened, they were steady and resolute.
A pot of tea, a bottle of Firewhisky and seven nervous breakdowns later, Harry, Ron and Hermione were sitting on the sofa, staring at the void in a semblance of truce…
“You’re welcome” Harry scoffed with a wolfish grin.
At his greatest surprise, the dark-haired wizard complied. He must have been truly exhausted and in worse shape than he was letting on.
“What? I thought you hated me??” exclaimed the dark-haired man.
“I see” said Draco disapprovingly, he sighed. “So, what happened to you?”
“Come on, just a little…” but the wards shimmered and cut him off.
“Harry, you’re literally covered in blood and that wound is longer than my forearm!”
“Look, Hermione, I
He reluctantly dragged himself to the kitchen where he set a frugal meal in motion with slow moves and a fuzzy head. Harry couldn’t stand having Kreattur here slaving for him and constantly reminding him of Dobby and Sirius, so he had offered him to remain at Hogwarts with the other house-elves. He sometimes came to visit on his days-off.
He slips a hand already clammy with anticipation in his loose pyjama trousers and brushes delicately the tender flesh between his legs, mapping the soft curves and gasping at the sudden spikes of pleasure that swell with heat from head to toe. A few moments of frantic exploration later he tilts his head back, arch his body and cry out as his orgasm hits him by surprise. He stays still, panting in the dark and says faintly:
“I love you” murmurs Draco in his hair.
“Let’s not care about that for now, it’s the only lead we have right now!” rushed Harry.
“Harry… I… I don’t even know what to say…”
Maybe things wouldn’t be that bad after all.
Harry was a big ball of restless energy, a bright bundle of nerves, always fidgeting, moving, fretting around. He was rather discreet, probably had learnt to hide it throughout the years, but there was nothing that could cover the electric aura of his magic.
“You mean that… At Hogwarts…? And, after? All this time… You… fancied me?”
“Ron?”
“We all have scars” Draco murmurs, kissing his neck “we all made mistakes. But it’s over now, it was a long time ago”
Harry was still smiling and held a familiar winged golden ball.
Ron’s eyes were so wide they could have rolled out of his sockets. Hermione looked like she had been turned into a statue, a look of horror on her face.
“Hermione” cut Harry with a soft voice “It’s great. I’m sure you’ll be very beneficial to one another. I’m happy for you, there’s no need to panic. I’m not mad, it’s great news, really”
“Take it off” he whispers, tugging at the pants. Draco complies adroitly and what they’re about to do gets very very real.
“Malfoy, are you… hurt? Do you want to stop?” asked Harry, praying he would be strong enough to actually manage to stop if Malfoy asked him to.
“It has nothing to do with it. I’m doing this because it’s the right thing to do, nothing else” said Harry firmly and there was metal in his voice.
But when he sees Harry’s face he instantly knows this one was bad. Not bone-crushing, flesh-wounding bad. The other kind. The one that make him wake-up screaming when it adds to the long collection of the best hits of the War.
“That's the reason why I was so angry in the first place” Draco continues “I have spent the best part of my adult life trying to get over that stupid crush and you come and rub my nose in it as if I could’ve… It was just too much” he shakes his head with a small smile.
“Had I know I just needed that to shut you up, I would’ve said it earlier” snorted Harry, shooting him a goofy grin. A sense of great achievement washed over him when he saw the corners of his pale lips twitch and mirth sparkle in the grey irises.
2) Translation of the conversation in French :
“I told you before, I’m not taking orders from you” said Draco equally fiercely. He grabbed Harry’s collar and brought him against his torso brutally.
“Merlin, I want you so much…” he groans against the skin of his neck, then sucks his way to his jaw, making Draco’s knees go weak.
“And do you like that?” Draco slipped another finger and started scissoring and looking for the small bundle of nerves that would make him melt around him.
Harry looked away.
How dare he do that to him, after everything… after…
Harry’s smile faltered. Silence stretched between them for a brief moment.
“That looked like an unpleasant chat” says Harry lightly.
“Just try to stay in one piece, will you?”
“I just needed to tell you, that I’m sorry. That I didn’t do it on purpose or to trick you. I just… got caught up in my feelings for you even if I shouldn’t have” he pauses and averts his eyes, adding in a quiet voice “I’ll leave you alone from now on.”
“Draco, please, please” begged Harry breathlessly “I can’t…”
Draco laughed darkly.
“You’re mother is safe, by the way” Harry finally said. “She’s at St Mungo’s and they told us she should make it”
“Because he’s Harry and he gets into the worst messes anybody could think of every two other months?” said Ron with an affectionate smile.
“I hated you. But I wanted to fuck you into oblivion.”
“Gosh, your boyfriend is such a gossip…” he sighed dramatically.
“Do you want me to firecall them and tell them not to come? I don’t want to impose them-”
“But not this time” says Draco softly, brushing his cheek so tenderly Harry aches.
When he turned back, he gaped at the sight of a tall dark-haired man staring at him with mischievous eyes and holding two flutes of champagne.
“Anyway, I’ll leave you alone now! See you soon, Harry!”
“Tell me” he pressed her urgently.
Draco was too tired and stricken to ponder on the surreal of the situation. He kept staring at his mother through a blurry world of salty beads for what felt like hours until he bushy brunette tugged at his hand and led him to a chair. She placed a hot cup of steaming something in his hand and urged him to drink it. Then a warm drowsiness fell on him like a lead weight. Just before he lost consciousness, he felt a fluffy cloth being placed on his cold limbs.
He was wearing what looked like a mixture between a muggle suit and formal robes in a dark fabric that contrasted with his pale complexion and accentuated his lean frame.
it.” His knife clinked loudly on the cutting board when he cut through a carrot with more force than intended.
“As you well know, the Auror Department needs to muster a certain amount of decorum and authority…”
“We’ll definitely get back to that another time” he shivers at the thought “but for now we’ll focus on your cock getting inside me if that’s okay with you” he purrs. Harry whimpers in answer. What a sight he makes on the already ruined sheets, straining against his bonds like a rabid wolf.
“Come on Harry, you know the rumours about the Bureau. It’s not the first we talk about how the big fishes always seem to get wind of our raids or miraculously disappear from our radars when we start to sniff around their trails.”
“Trust me. This time, I’ll do all the work and make
The Auror had suffered through a long reprieve from the infamous Belarius Catesby and once again, Harry mused about whether the damned bureaucrat had ever spent more than a week on the field in his whole career. But with Ron and him now trying to figure out if Catesby was just an incompetent power-greedy bastard or just a filthy corrupted scumbag, his musings were getting darker and darker. If the Head Auror was on the payroll of Dark wizards, Wizarding Britain was in deep shit. And Harry had no idea what they would do once the burning question had found an answer. Only thinking about it made his jaw clench and his shoulders tense. This was way above his pay grade.
“I’m sorry for last night. It was not only completely uncalled for but also extremely unfair on my part to second-guess you and accuse you like that.”
“Ready to get your ass kicked, Malfoy?” said Harry wickedly. A touch of their old rivalry reignited with the use of his last name.
The wizard looked indeed quite striking wearing a dashing black and white tuxedo, fantastically contrasting with the untamed mane of jet-black hair and the juvenile round spectacles.
“I mean, you’re still you, and you say the exact same things but you’re a
“It’s just that at school, I wasn’t even sure I would make it to adulthood so I didn’t really put much thought in it. And when the War was over, it only seemed logical I would become an Auror. I had fought Dark Wizards for half my life already and it was the only thing I was good at.”
“I bet. I could have used that kind of knowledge too at the time… You would make a good Healer.”
“I’m Draco Malfoy, I don’t believe we’ve met?” he says smoothly and Harry hates him a little.
“We need to talk” he finally said.
A clanking noise accompanied by broken glass echoed in the old house and woke Draco with a start.
*       *       *
He speeds up his rhythm and squeezes a bit harder, Potter tenses and groans again. But apparently he has had it because he brusquely stands up with Draco safely in his arms, turns around and lays him down on the bed gently. He takes his trousers off, crawls over him and settles between his legs, pressing the long hard line of his body against Draco who shivers at the contact of the burning skin.
“Yeah, I probably have some left in that cabinet… I couldn’t reach it with my arm…” said Harry absently.
“It wasn’t” finally said Harry. Draco turned back to face him, shocked.
The pleading and needy tone nearly drove him over the edge. He sucked in a shaky breath and aligned himself with the palpitating muscles. He breached Harry, slowly, retreating and pushing back, millimetre by millimetre, holding Harry’s hips with his hands and blocking him from pushing back. When he finally sheathed himself deep into the tight hot channel, he stopped moving and breathed carefully. Draco softly stroked Harry’s cock, whispered a spell and the young man let out a frustrated noise. A glowing silvery thread had circled tightly around Harry’s cock and balls then knotted itself. Draco brought his mouth at Harry’s hear and said in a low, rough voice.
“He’s trying to make me jealous, and says that you smell good” said Harry, apparently in high spirits. “Need a hand to get up?” asked the Auror very neutrally.
“You’re absolutely unbelievable.”
” commented Al contentedly, coiling around Harry’s wrists and pressing softly against the warm skin affectionately.
Draco got up too and his muscles screamed their disapproval, he groaned too.
“He deserves to get on with his life after being caught up in his father’s schemes for so long” he added almost robotically.
Draco’s skin covered in gooseflesh and his hair rose on his neck and forearms. He wasn’t used to hear someone speak Parseltongue so casually. Last time it had been… unpleasant to say the least. But now, it was entirely different sensations than fear and horror that washed over him when he was picking up the quiet exchange between Harry and the snake. The dark-haired man’s way of speaking the strange language was fortunately nowhere near the ominous and bloodcurdling whispers of the dark Lord. His tone was warm and the syllables tumbled lazily from his lips, filled with affection, in an impossible contrast with what the blond had known. Draco had to admit, it was rather…
The piece of furniture that concealed them from the Dark wizard was suddenly cast away and crashed against a wall behind them.
Harry ignored the voice and silently cast a shielding and warming charm on Draco to try and compensate his blood-loss.
“Look Potter, you don’t have to do this like some kind of reciprocation for… you know”
“Harry…”
“Harry, are you 100% sure Draco’s in danger?”
Draco couldn’t feel his lower limbs and was waiting for a miracle on the cold tiles.
“Oh” is all Harry says.
“Well, not anymore…” says Harry quietly and rubs his neck embarrassedly.
Harry climbed up the stairs, fury turning his sight red for a moment. He paused in front of Sirius’s room and punched the wall forcefully once, then twice, and didn’t stop, lashing out at the unforgiving hard surface, puncturing the dark and faded wallpaper and the wooden panel behind it. When he stopped, the wall was a crater of shattered wood and plaster smeared with blood. He watched it for a few seconds without seeing it then entered the room and slammed the door shut behind him. Harry crashed at the foot of the four-poster bed, shaking with anger, his magic flaring uncontrollably around and inside him. The Auror tried to breath in and out slowly to calm himself but failed miserably. Like he had countless times before.
“Ron!” Hermione tried to sound scandalized but she was half laughing already.
“What do you mean?” the blond asked with a little startled smile.
A sudden beeping sound accompanied by a strong vibration woke him up hours later. The snake was gone and so were his glasses. Muttering dark imprecations, Harry groped around him for the round spectacles like he did a billion times before. He found them, put them on and turned to the source of the sound: his phone.
“I mean, it’s weird and not weird at the same time” he reflects “it’s like you have a twin sister that is you… but not really…”
“You don’t have to say anything.”
It isn’t anything like being on the field under Polyjuice or any other disguise; there he is always wary, constant vigilance and whatnot. With Draco, the problem is he isn’t wary at all. He is feeling more and more at ease, enjoying the friendly banter and the easy companionable silence when they are working together.
“Don’t tell me it was your first time since school?” said Draco in disbelief.
“I don’t know, more… grounded, serene” he said and watched him with his piercing green stare.
Malfoy moaned again and slipped his hands through the black curls, he kissed him harder, then resurfaced to get some air, panting. Harry kissed his way to his neck, he could feel his pulse jumping under the soft iridescent skin. He licked and sucked the flesh and tasted sweat, smoke and blood on him.
“I’m sure he didn’t mean it. He probably just panicked.”
“Still, I had no idea you had to face that… And you didn’t know you were a wizard?
The Lindisfarne Castle, a 16
The callous hands wrapped delicately around him and he moaned with a long throaty sound. But before he could recover from the delicious sensation of being stroked, a hot wetness closed around his cock and he nearly came when he saw the Gryffindor and his wild mane of jet-black hair slowly bobbing up and down his length.
“Ahhh come ooooonnn, you know what ‘m talkin’ aboouuuuut” he insists but Harry’s confused look spurs him on to specify “you know, wanking!”
“Draco… the door, it’s not… Aah”
“It’s not much, but it’s yours if you want it” Potter says evenly. It’s such a text-book example of Gryffindorish sappy bravado that Draco would laugh if it didn’t make him feel so humbled and privileged at once. Potter looks so vulnerable yet so defiant in this moment that something churns inside Draco’s chest.
“No!” he exclaimed but his mother ignored him.
Draco got lost for a moment in a dark time with news never good, choices never enough and people dying before eyes that were far too young. He shivered.
Of course, leave it to Lucius to seclude himself in a bloody castle like the greedy arrogant bastard he was.
A moment later, Malfoy stands and shrugs off his blouse. He’s wearing a grey waistcoat and trousers and seeing Malfoy in a Muggle suit is all kinds of weird. His crisp white shirt is impeccably pressed with the sleeves rolled above the elbows.
“I read all books as long as they’re interesting.”
“How the hell does he manage to get in my room with the door closed, I’d like to know!”
“Tea?” the latter asked, ignoring her comment on his lack of culture.
“Stop” his voice cracked like a whip and Draco felt his magic soar around them, electric, menacing. He had gotten up in a fraction of second and he looked unhinged, dangerous.
Harry recoils at the bitter words.
“I wanted to tell you for a while but… I was scared shitless. I think now I’m high enough not to care” Harry was in a perilously drowsy state.
house?” he shook his head again. “That’s just fucked up…”
“Merlin…” Draco moaned “You already have plenty of medals, don’t you want a different kind of reward for a change…?” Harry groaned and sucked his neck brazenly, covering Draco’s skin in delicious shivers. “And you’re the one to talk, you look like a bloody wet dream in Quidditch gear” he groaned.
“I’m horny when I’m drunk” he pointed out.
“Your wish is my command” he purred. Then he started to move, pressing Draco into the mattress with his thrusts, pinning him beneath him with the hand on his arse. He fisted his hair and tugged his head backwards, exposing the ivory flesh of his neck he then devoured as he picked up the pace of his hips.
“How about a drink, something to eat and a chat in the dining room?” asked Harry with a concerned tone. “I can lit the fire, you must be freezing”
“Draco, listen to me” she said in French, obviously as an attempt to conceal their words from the other wizard.
“You’re so beautiful” mumbles Potter between kisses on his chest, then catches a nipple in his mouth and teases it with his tongue. Draco arches his back and moans deeply then whimpers when Potter’s mouth continue on his way. When the full lips curl around his shaft moments later though, he finds that Potter will be forgiven if he keeps up with the good work. He looses his train of thought for a moment there and gasps when slicked fingers tease the sensitive skin of his entrance. Potter’s tongue continues its wonders and a finger slips in soon enough, brushing, caressing, teasing the bundle of nerves buried inside. Potter has obviously done this before or maybe he’s a natural at both slaying Dark Lords and making guys loose their bloody minds. Another finger joins the first ad scissors him from the inside while the delicious suction caries on without a hitch. Draco is reduced to a sorry heap of mush by that point and he’ll probably be ashamed of how he writhes and moans later. But now he’s just contemplating abandoning all dignity and begging Potter for his cock.
“Are you quite finished?” asked Harry coldly.
Grimmauld Place, being in a Muggle residential neighbourhood and all, is a relatively quiet area. But it doesn’t last when a wild Draco verging-on-Berzerk apparates in front of number 12 and starts pounding on the door in the middle of the night.
“And what a joy to see you finally get what was coming to you after all your misbehaving” he sighed contentedly when another visceral scream tore out of Draco’s chest which was nothing but a mess of open wounds, bruised flesh and burnt skin. Fresh, warm, blood was trickling over coagulated trails in a messy and sinister labyrinthine tangle.
“Harry…” but Hermione stopped right in her tracks when the Gryffindor shot her a fierce, warning look, all deep green and steel.
“A war will do that to you, I suppose” said Malfoy philosophically with a grave nod.
Draco’s heart missed a beat.
Thought Harry suddenly. He hung up and dialled Luna’s number as fast as his clumsy fingers allowed him to, heart beating fast.
The weirdest part isn’t his chest and the feel of those squishy things that wobble weirdly at his every move, no it’s his voice, reflects Harry. Those high-pitched weird shrieks that have nothing to do with his usual coarse rumble. They fill the room as he shouts his lungs out at his unlucky audience but Harry almost feels like it’s someone else’s screams. Bloody hell, this is so weird. It doesn’t stop Harry from venting his frustration on his friends, though. He knows he will regret it later but right now he needs that.
When he woke up, Harry winced as a chorus of pain and chaotic thoughts collided in his skull. His eyes fluttered open and he recognized Sirius’ room around him. He was laying on the covers of the bed, still fully clothed, his wand nowhere to be seen.
“Yes, I know. And yes, I’m pissed off. But I have far more pleasant things in mind that a re-do of your appalling monologue. By the way, you suck at apologies. It’s fortunate that you have other… talents” says Draco sultrily and Harry’s irises darken instantly.
“Harry wait!” said Hermione but he was already gone.
” agreed Harry distractedly. He carefully laid the snake on the bed and undressed himself with a mindless spell. Minutes later, he was curling on his side and relishing the feel of the fresh and thin cotton sheets on his naked heated skin, breathing hard the smells of the summer that went through the opened window and stroking the tepid scales in an abstract pattern.
“Yeah, like Dumbledore did, and look where it got him… He died because of me. I can barely cope with it, if you get hurt too, I couldn’t live with it.”
“God, I fucking love magic” exclaimed Harry when all the mess from their dinner ascended from the table with a flick of his wand. The china obediently piled up near the sink -to be tended the day after-, the blanket neatly folded itself and flew to the dining room, the remaining food packed in mid-air and landed in the cooling-cabinet. In less than a minute, everything was sorted.
“Draco, about the ‘love’ thing…” starts Harry hesitantly.
All traces of humour and lightness had deserted his face and tone. He looked determined and stubborn. The atmosphere of the room changed instantly as those viridian eyes searched his with an impossible intensity.
“She won’t have any permanent damage, she just needs to rest for a while and then she’ll be ‘as good as new’” he quoted sarcastically.
Lucius’ laugh swelled and filled the room once again.
“You’re wrong. There are things you don’t know about Dumbledore’s death. It wasn’t your fault.” said Harry softly.
“May the odds be ever in our favour” chanted Luna lowly but no Hunger Games reference would help them here and she knew it as she climbed down the rotten flight of stairs after her friends.
“Yeah, something like that” Harry didn’t feel like going over the subject and he didn’t have time anyway “Look, I need to fill Ron and Hermione in then go to the DMLE, so if you hear from him, let me know immediately, ok?”
Malfoy arches a brow critically then bursts out laughing. It’s so unexpected that Harry almost jumps. He would have imagined Malfoy to have a snobbish and pretentious laugh but the sound spilling out of the man is bright and rich, genuine. It’s rather pleasant, actually. Harry shakes himself internally.
He had known teenage Malfoy like few people probably ever had. He had followed him, analysed and studied his every moves for hours on end; seen him through Voldemort’s eyes in what was probably a few instances of his worst moments and had been present for another couple ones that had given him a new light in Harry’s eyes —like in the Manor or in the Room of Requirements— but now, Harry has to admit he obviously knows nothing about the man Malfoy became and he can’t figure out why but the idea rattles him somewhere deep.
Once again, Draco caves in and pushes gentle fingers inside Harry who wants more, so much more. He wants to feel the burn, he wants to be taken apart and Draco knows how it feels. He’s been there not so long ago.
Draco could feel the electric crackle of his magic and follow his furious stomps through the house and the doors slamming on his way. Half way up the last flight of stairs, Harry seemed to finally lose it and the loud crack of Disapparition told the blond he just had vacated the house at two o’clock in the morning.
Harry shot up and his fists clenched instinctively.
Thought his drunk, happy brain. Or he thought he had until Draco asked:
“Don’t worry, I’ll make sure he’s alright on my way home tonight. And I’ll give him a piece of my mind” she said fiercely. And for a moment, Draco was amused at the prospect of a furious Hermione storming in Grimmault Place. Then his smile faltered when he remembered he wasn’t welcome in the old house anymore. Hermione seemed to have followed his train of thoughts because she asked:
The following weeks, Draco avoids him like the plague. If Harry wasn’t such a wreck about it, he would admire his skills, the man has pushed it to an art form at this point. His flat and office are warded against him (with spells so intricate and powerful –and not entirely legal- that maybe even Bill Weasley would have trouble breaking through) as well as his home and ministry floo addresses. All his letters come back unopened (even the official ones) and setting up camp in front of Draco’s office hasn’t worked even a tiny bit so far, but Harry stubbornly keeps it up.
“I’m sorry, have you met Luna?” Harry knows he has made a mistake the second the words get out of his mouth but he cannot take them back. Draco’s gaze sharpens and a wolfish grin that does strange things to his stomach stretches the pale lips.
“I’m starting to now!” Harry said, his temper soaring uncontrollably. Draco flinched.
“Well, I do have first hand experience on the matter” Draco smirks.
Harry is babbling anxiously and Draco cuts him off with a raised hand.
“Now, we fight” said Harry ferociously, his eyes burning with that dangerous glint his friends had seen several times before.
He takes a last inhale and steps into the kitchen. Draco is turned away from him, frying eggs and bacon in a pan. He’s only wearing pastel blue pyjama pants and Harry zaps out for a second, admiring his lean figure and the muscles rippling under the pale skin. On the small on his back, Harry sees the small indents his nails left there earlier and his stomach churns. That little detail brings all at the surface and he’s verging on having a meltdown, right here, right now. God, he’s not ready for this, he’s not ready to lose that, he’s not ready to lose him, he’s not-
With a simple firecall to pull a favour from a muggle-born engineer she was working with at the Department of Experimental Magic, they had the information they were looking for.
“Oh, uh, did you meet someone?” asked Ron clumsily with a knowing smile.
“He wants to kill Harry Potter and he has contacts in the Ministry, they’re going to send him in a trap, we don’t have long”
“Trouble in paradise?” scoffed Harry who was passing by on his way to work.
“How dare you, you filthy-” a magically distorted voice seethes through the fireplace.
So yes, nothing to worry about, just normal libido behaviour. A bit embarrassing but that was it. Yep. Totally normal.
Luna howled with laughter, holding her sides and rocking uncontrollably, tears soon streaming on her cheeks.
“Are you ready?”
He re-reads the same line of his transfiguration book probably for the twentieth time, desperately pushing pictures of Harry lying in a ditch somewhere at the back of his mind. When the fire roars green, he cannot help a sigh of relief.
“Do you want to…?” he asks between messy kisses with a concerned and hesitant expression.
“So much for the Great Hero of the Wizarding World” said Draco sternly.
With a laugh he left.
blood???”
Hermione assures him that she’s working with Parson to find a quicker way to revert him back to his old self and it’s small but still a comfort. It’s Hermione and she has been sorting him out of his messes for almost fifteen years now.
And now this. The boy he had hated for years, the one he had almost sliced in two a few months ago, the boy who had lied to his family to save him, the one he had then saved in turn was now lying naked in his arms, trusting him in his sleep. Harry thought he should have been upset, revolted or at least confused. But he wasn’t. It made sense, in its own twisted way. And he hadn’t felt like this in months, maybe years? Like he belonged. Like he was actually part of the living. Like it was something that was his, entirely his and solely due to his own choices and free will for a change, not to an ominous prophecy or an old spider weaving his web around him. Like it was something pure, raw and real.
“Lube?” asked Malfoy breathlessly, holding his hands and Harry slicked them with a flick of his will. Malfoy kissed him brutally and tugged at his cock teasingly. Harry’s hands clutched the narrow hips in a bruising grip, hanging on for dear life in the storm of sensations raging inside him.
He swallows hard and Draco presses his lips against his mouth slowly, coaxing his lips open, licking into his mouth until the Auror exhales an unsteady breath.
*       *       *
“Can I…?”
Harry briefly considers apparating out of the apartment but discards the idea as soon as it has crossed his mind. He owes Draco the truth, that’s the least he can do after what he did. He’s going to kill him but he deserves that, and then some.
“So, do you care for a little more practice?” says Draco with a seductive tone.
After the War, Hermione had managed to create then preside the Board for Magical Cooperation, which oversaw tremendous restructuration in the Ministry on matters ranging from Goblin’s relations, Magical Creatures Protection, Criminal Reinsertion policies, et cetera. Then, since it apparently wasn’t enough of a challenge for her, she managed to secure funds in order to create a new Ministry Department dedicated to Experimental Magic. She had tried to explain what it dealt with many times but from what Harry had gathered, it sounded complicated, fascinating –according to Hermione who had a slightly different views on the matter than ordinary mortals- and involved more or less every type of magic that existed, healing and technology.
” she said in French, obviously as an attempt to conceal their words from the other wizard.
“But apparently you’re the kind of person who shags twice and still call me by my surname” he chuckles lightly.
“Let me take a look” says Harry and takes his hand carefully, his heart beating hard in his chest.
“Well, here with me, naturally!” laughed Lucius good-naturedly. “I must say, I had a whole plan to trap you and kill you but it’s nice of you to relieve me of this gruelling operation planning. How awfully thoughtful of you to come to me on your own accord.”
Draco takes a moment to collect himself, he doesn’t want to sound hysterical but it’s exactly how he feels.
“Come here… Are you alright?” he asks gently.
‘Still a few days’, Parson’s letter had said. He was going to make the most of it and damn the consequences, he was already in too deep anyway.
Draco fell on his knees, his whole body trembling uncontrollably, struggling for air.
Harry turned on his heels and disappeared from the room, leaving Draco panting, anger still making his blood chant through his veins but with a sinking feeling burning his stomach like acid.
“No no, it’s nothing like that” she sighed, relieved and the blond couldn’t blame her. “Erm, I don’t know how to put this but yesterday morning, Harry apparently barged in the Ministry covered in blood and limping –like the stubborn git he is- then he quit and blew up Catesby’s office”
, please?” he says, avoiding the inquisitive grey eyes.
The cloaked tall frame crouched supply in front of Narcissa, revealing his craggy, pale face with protruding dark eyebrows, light blue eyes and long black hair. He looked around forty, rather tall and broad. His expensive but unostentatious clothes and the way he held himself indicated someone rich, well bred or at least pretending to be. His gloved fingers threaded through Narcissa’s blond locks thoughtfully “Such a waste” he sighed.
“It doesn’t matter anymore, I…”
“I know I have no right to ask you to trust me-”
When Harry wakes up, he’s alone. He hears someone busy in the kitchen and smiles.
At first Hermione has the decency to look sorry but his rant probably pissed her off somewhere in the last thirty minutes because now, her arms are crossed, she regularly huffs at the stupidest parts of his tirade and glares through the window.
“Mother, no!”
“Well, I shagged a muggle girl in a club but it doesn’t really qualify as experience, right?” Said the dark-haired wizard embarrassedly. “Sorry, I should have told you before…” The Gryffindor seemed acutely self-conscious, his muscles tensed and his eyes guarded. A warm feeling surged in Draco.
Potter soon follows him with a deep, throaty sob, his whole body convulsing. He rides out his orgasm, quivering with the force of his aftershocks. Potter is panting hard and he buries his face in the crook off his neck, his arms still tightly secured around him. The pale blond traces soothing imaginary patterns on the powerful back and tries to get his brain cells to start working again.
Harry stopped in his track, fuming.
“You’re finished, Malfoy, whether I live or die here in a puddle of my own blood” said Harry with all the bravado he could muster. The young wizard caught a move at the corner of his eye but kept his features blank.
, he repeats himself desperately. Though he wouldn’t put past the bugger to see through his appearance. The man has always had a knack to sniff whatever Harry is hiding. Or he had at Hogwarts anyway. Even if he doesn’t anymore, it won’t take him a minute to connect the dots if Harry steps inside his office with his magic acting like a fricking tornado Wizard-of-Oz-style.
Draco turned back and looked at Harry’s expectant face. He could see the hope and determination burning in him. The knot in his chest grew tighter.
“Dragon tamer.” Harry looked at him in bewilderment and blinked several times “I wanted to be a Dragon tamer when I was a child” he laughed.
They had come a long way, he reflected while watching the stunning platinum blond with his posh features twisted in a dubious smile as Pansy was talking with a conspiratory air to him, Charlie and his boyfriend Andrej. Harry felt a surge of possessiveness when he saw the way Charlie and Andrej looked captivated by Draco’s apparently riveting conversation and his graceful, expressive hand gestures. The pale blond must have sensed his gaze and looked up. He shot him a smouldering look full of unspeakable possibilities that cut his breath short in an instant. Then the tall blond reported his attention on his friends and Harry shook himself, feeling ridiculous… and horny.
Potter snatches him by his front robes with one hand and opens the door with a flick of his will, stretching out the strong wards like mere fabric to allow them passage, quicker that way, if barbarian. Still, Draco shivers at the easy use of silent wandless magic, as if it is nothing to the man.
“Buckle up lads, it’s gonna be a bumpy ride” said Ron with a goofy grin met by perplexed looks.
“You’re actually a pretty decent flyer.”
When the beautiful pale woman woke up, her first words were for her son.
“Does your father know?”
Hermione babbled frantically, the words tumbling from her mouth faster and faster, avoiding his cool, green stare.
“Yeah, a few times but I was too young and I did it for bad reasons” he says with a fond smile “it was a bloody disaster”
Relief crashed over him like a tidal wave, nearly making him collapse in a chair when he saw Luna, Harry, Hermione and Ron in a perfectly healthy state if sombre looking.
“I’LL HAVE YOUR HEAD POTTER, COUNT ON IT! AND YOU’RE BOTH SUSPENDED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE, YOU HEAR ME????”
“It doesn’t erase that
“Yeah, don’t worry” said the Gryffindor absently.
When Harry finally reaches Grimmauld Place, he nearly collapses when he trips on the troll-leg umbrella-stand and it reminds him of Tonks. He chuckles fondly, too plastered to get the sharp pang of grief and guilt he always feels when he thinks about all the people that were left behind.
“You hurt yourself” Harry points out.
“God, I was so far gone, I would have fucked you into the floor right here, in front of everyone the minute you asked me too”
Harry shrugged and the corner of his lips twitched in an indifferent smile, then his stare fell on Draco’s torso, noticing something he had missed during his previous examination. His expression darkened. Harry’s eyes stared at the expense of pale skin -branded by old wounds too- and at the diagonal scar on Draco’s torso. The one he was responsible for.
“Yes! Yes, right there, stay right there, so good…” Draco sobbed and rocked his hips, making Harry cry out too.
“You read muggle books, then?”
“Fuck you!”
It meant that Lucius had no reason to keep Draco alive.
The pale-blond opened his eyes, fear filling him for a whole minute before remembering where he was and that he was safe.
“Mmmh, Oh Merlin, yes” moaned the Slytherin. “Good slave.” The fair-haired man fisted the shiny black mane and tugged at it, urging Harry to go deeper. A strangled cry erupted from Draco’s throat without warning. He was already so close but it was nearly impossible to stop, so good… The Healer steeled himself.
” corrected sternly Luna.
“No, at least I don’t think so…” he sighed “Gosh, they could be anywhere!” he said, frustrated.
Hermione ran her own spells.
He whipped around in panic and his frantic eyes fell on a vague and sleepy form spread out on the old couch. Harry was fast asleep, sprawled out in a complicated position, his head resting on the arm of the sofa. His glasses were askew and he had obviously tried and given up mid-course to remove his brown Auror robes since one of his arms was still trapped inside the uniform. Mouth slightly open, his breathing was hoarse and a slight tremor was running in his tensed muscles. To complete the picture, one of his feet was dangling off the piece of furniture.
“Yes! Oh Harry you feel so good, so-” but he never finished his sentence, too shaken by the sensations that crashed over him. He emptied himself in Harry with a deep sob, rode the last of his aftershock and stopped moving, breathless, sweaty and broken.
“Don’t stop… Fuck d-don’t stop” he chokes out.
Draco didn’t say or do anything for a few moments, rendered speechless by the sight of Harry’s torso. Gone was the scrawny kid he knew at school. His training and the hardships of his job had carved a strong but marked body. The smooth golden skin and harmonious musculature was marred by countless silvery scars of various shapes and sizes, tracing a grim pattern on Harry’s upper body. The wound in itself was rather deep and irregular. The flesh of his torso was also badly bruised. Draco swallowed hard and shook himself internally.
“No, I’m not drunk, Draco…” Potter says in a dispirited hollow tone. A pang shoots through the white-blond’s chest at the sound of his name in the wretched mouth.
“It’s my mother” he said feebly, despair and fear filling the deep, grey eyes. “She escaped but He’s after her”
“Ah, finally, young Draco deigns to grace us with his presence”
“So… Ron told me Adrian is moping around in the Bureau. And he asked after you, repeatedly. He says you’re avoiding him.”
Ron and Harry had kept ignoring each other the following days when possible and exchanged the minimal amount of words when working together on the field. Harry was sick of it but he kept reminding himself that his friends just needed time.
Showered and dressed, the taste of peppermint replacing the staleness on his tongue, Draco climbed down the stairs, took a knife in the kitchen and headed out into the overgrown backyard.
Draco feels him move and stands on his elbow, looking at him with a bewildered look of utter confusion etched on his face.
“W-What?” Harry’s heart started beating frantically, blood rushing in his ears.
Suddenly, a little whine nearly jumped the Slytherin out of his skin and he realized he wasn’t alone in the room.
doing here? Why aren’t you celebrating with the masses of your adoring fans?” said Malfoy with a sarcastic tone that lacked the usual bite.
“Yes, Mother” he answered calmly, his cool façade at odds with the frantic panic he was feeling inside.
“What do you want from me?” he asks dryly.
. Harry could only hope someone would come to the rescue quickly. He glanced around him in search for a weapon of some kind but saw nothing; he was completely and utterly screwed.
“Merlin Draco, I love you –Aah- I love you so fucking much…!” his black pupils are so wide they have almost swallowed the green and he sounds broken, unravelled, lost. A fraction of second later, he arches his back and raises Draco from the bed with the strength of his orgasm, burying himself until the hilt inside Draco with a choking desperate sound that sounds like his name. He continues to slam into him until Draco’s head falls back, his hands lost inside his own hair and comes violently “Yes, yes! Harry, yes! Oh god, it’s so good…” he sobs as the pleasure rips through him like electric shocks. When his ears stop ringing he looks down at Harry, his glassy vibrant green eyes looking at him like nobody ever looked at him. He’s shaken to his very core by the intensity of those eyes.
Draco’s hips start pumping in and out slowly, a storm of sensations raking his whole body. He loses himself in the tight channel welcoming him in a searing embrace at each thrust.
The sound that tumbled messily from the sleepy Slytherin made his cock jump.
“Harry, get up and go to bed. You’ll be in pieces tomorrow if you don’t” said a soft voice.
“I’ve already tried all the locating spells I know but it didn’t work” said Harry, feeling defeated and increasingly worried.
“Look, would you just calm down and come to the living room with me? I-I’ll explain everything… Okay?”
“Don’t let it get to your over-inflated ego, Scarhead” Draco teases but it soon turns into a squeal when Harry retaliates by tickling him.
It was his little ritual, his secret weapon against the darkness. When he was alone and scared in the night, when the wounds reopened and threatened to drown him in blood, he would think of all those lights, all those times he had watched the sun come up and scatter the shadows, reducing them to nothing.
“Salazar, you’re actually embarrassed” said Malfoy delightedly “How much of a virgin are you anyway?”
“Nothing but my life, my safety, the clothes I’m wearing and the roof I have over my head” said Draco with a wolfish smile. “I’m starting to wonder about the existence of hypothetical ulterior motives. Am I going to end up as a high-end prostitute?”
Potter steps past him and leaves him alone in the dark corridor, his head a mess of crazy questions painfully buzzing around in his skull, making his head spin.
Luna flattened his hair back tenderly, tucking him deeper in the crook of her neck, she felt his hard breath, hot and humid against her skin. A surge of protectiveness rose inside her for this young man who had already seen too much and lost even more.
Suddenly, he has the eerie feeling that something is not right. A prickle of unease trails down his spine, waking dark old memories of dried blood, biting metal and rough stone. He casts a small lighting spell and all but jumps when it reveals the slumped form of Harry bloody Potter in rumpled Auror robes, sitting on the ground and staring at the wall facing him. He looks utterly miserable and has obviously been waiting here for hours.
He was suddenly overcome by the urge to map his body with his tongue, to slide his mouth all over the marmoreal body.
Malfoy looked taken aback by the statement but quickly schooled his features in an impressive blank façade.
“Get out, you didn’t. I would’ve… wait… Halloween feast, second year? Merlin, I remember! You gits! That’s why those idiots turned out in a closet half-naked afterwards?”
“Realistic? Did you really think I would kick you out for this? Am I that shallow and suggestible to you?”
“And you know that how, Auror Potter?”
After the pub, they all went to Ron and Hermione’s cottage and drank some more. In hindsight, it was probably a bad idea. But Harry was so glad he had friends back that he didn’t care in the slightest about the state he would be in the following morning. After all, it was Friday and he didn’t have to get to work in the weekend for once.
“Sod off! Not everyone’s lucky enough to shack up with his best friend, you tosser” says Harry and gives his shoulder a playful shove that makes him stumble.
One thing was for sure, Potter was gone. Nobody had seen him at work or at home where boosted repelling wards had royally thwarted off the bravest reporters with various and very inventive curses.
Now everything was ruined. He had been humiliated, once again, and publicly, in front of his allies and powerful friends. Only the lie his son had been taken away forcefully by the famous Auror had been able to soften the blow. Now he needed to make a statement. He needed Harry Potter dead, at all costs. He couldn’t fail this time, no matter the consequences. Lucius chuckled darkly at the irony. Once again, Potter was blocking his way. But Voldemort’s failings where the boy was concerned had taught him well. He would annihilate the Boy Who Lived once and for all, his friend at the Ministry would ensure that. And if Draco couldn’t hear reason then… he had become a liability. And liabilities had to be taken care of.
Harry thought again about Adrian, one of the trainees he had met in the Auror training program. He was the one who made him realize he could love men too. It was after he and Ginny broke-up, he was a mess and tired, so tired.
Harry smiled and kept at his ministrations. He felt warm hands roam over his ruined t-shirt, brushing his nipples and sending shivers raking everywhere on his overheated skin. The Gryffindor couldn’t help a loud gasp when Malfoy deftly rocked his hips, his hardness brushing Harry’s deliciously, sending sparks in his loins and flooding his brain with scalding-hot blood.
“Let’s shut this fucker down” growled Harry fiercely.
“I don’t, it’s just… complicated” Harry says.
“I’m pretty sure Dementor’s cum tastes better than this” he said with a strained voice. “But it does help”
…help.”
“How very eloquent, Mr Potter…” he said seductively, running a hand on his torso evocatively.
, he thought stupidly, an involuntary absurd chuckle bubbling in his chest.
Draco bent over the Auror to get the two plates, engulfing Harry in a warm, citrusy scent. He busied himself on the stove and a minute later, an outrageously nice-smelling steaming plate was in front of Harry. Draco took the opposite chair and poured red wine in the stemmed glasses Harry hadn’t seen since Luna moved out.
“What a disturbing image” he said dazedly.
“Thank you for everything” said Draco with a soft voice and Harry tensed up immediately. Southwell studied the pale blond, surprised. Then she smiled warmly and winked.
“Actually, yes. Very.” Answered Harry, bracing himself for the scene that would probably ensue.
“He’s here!” screamed Hermione’s voice. “Oh my God Draco, are you…?... HARRY!”
Harry wished him a good night and didn’t notice his red cheeks.
” confirmed the beautiful crimson-red and golden-bellied snake.
“Bye ‘Mione”
“I couldn’t think about anything else the whole night” he said in a frenzied tone, gripping the blond’s hips and grinding against the narrow hips. Draco was already so turned on he was dizzy. The raven-haired man frantically tugged at his button. The sudden and mind-numbing blowjob had done nothing to sate his lust, if anything it had made it worse.
“You know, he’s not going to tell you but Ron is thrilled you finally decided to come back. And setting up a team of Aurors specialized in infiltration and undercover work was a very smart move, Harry. I must say, I’m very impressed.”
“Is Draco alright?” whispered Harry, ashamed he had momentarily forgotten about the blond.
The pale blond shot him a small smile and it was the only answer Harry needed, he grinned back like a bloody idiot.
“Because I’ve learned than being realistic can usually save one a lot of trouble.”
Before his sentence was even finished, Harry was at the door, his spine ablaze with fury. He managed to get to their office before snapping but it was a close call. Ron, used to his outburst, had already cast silencing charms and privacy wards that would repel everyone at the door.
Harry arches the body that knows better than himself what to do and lets it take control.
“Really?”
His skin has the same golden tone and the scar on his chest is still there, as well as all the others silver marks he got in the last years in the line of duty. Harry traces them to ground himself.
“Yes” agreed Harry and complied.
“I know what a Cordon Bleu is, Draco” he chuckled “I just didn’t think you knew how to cook is all”
Harry is now growling like a feral beast, his strong and taut muscles rippling under the tanned skin.
“Yes, please” Harry let out in a breath and let himself fall on a chair in an exhausted, sagging heap. He removed his glasses and resumed his previous rubbing activities.
“I don’t see you in Ravenclaw. Much too eccentric”
“Come in” says a muffled voice from within.
“I suppose you’re aware of it but let me remind you it’s going to sting a fair bit.”
spell Hermione has been working on which should show us the location of every offender occupying the scene.”
“I had the greatest day, I can’t believe it actually happened” The blond chuckled with disbelief.
“It’s the last time you meddle in my affairs, Potter. I told you once you would meet the same sticky end than your parents, didn’t I?”
“I’m afraid you’re going to he to be more specific, the subject stretches rather wide these days”
, Harry thinks and takes a deep breath before undressing himself, leaving only the knickers.
“Anyway, I promised Dad I would come by the Ministry today, I think Kingsley has been asking about… you know.”
“I hate you” said Draco with a rough voice “God, I hate you so much” he repeated, fisting the black hair harder and angling Harry’s head forcefully to deepen the brutal kiss. But Harry resisted, his neck muscles flexing with the effort of going against Draco’s forearms.
With a grunt, the Gryffindor changed his angle, trying to find the spot that would make Draco lose his mind. After a few attempts he finally found it and the white-blond bucked beneath him like a wild horse.
“Why do you have to automatically assume the worst?”
“You, I want you”
” complained the reptile, waving his tail crossly.
He got back to the grass and admired the fading sun that was casting a bronze light on everything. Harry was waiting for him, his hair still dripping wet.
“You like that, Potter?”
“Harry?” she said with a tiny voice “Would you like to come with us and have a drink?”
“It’s okay, it was along time ago.”
“Yes, yes, now!”
“Your bloody beast tried to strangle me in my sleep… again!” he snarled.
“Oh. That's’ actually a very good idea So you want to be our ‘Q’ then?” asks Harry without thinking then adds quickly “Sorry it’s a mugg-”
“Good point. Take this then” he held the pencil closer.
“No, no, Ron I swear, he did nothing to me. Actually, I’m the one who… I may have kidnapped him from his parents… I… It’s complicated…”
“Right. I think I’ll leave you with your wild speculations” Harry says too quickly.
“Urgh, that was stupid. Um, I don’t know, it didn’t look that bad at first I guess. I didn’t realize I was bleeding that much before removing my robes and then I was too exhausted to disapparate there.”
“Beds are boring” mumbled Harry moodily, his eyes already closed.
“You seem weirdly calm about it though”
Draco answered with a light shrug, still looking at the fire, which cast dancing golden light on his sharp profile and made his eyes glint.
“Don’t worry, it’s not as bad as it looks, I’m fine.” Said he Gryffindor tiredly.
“Sorry Narcissa, but it is time” said Sándor softly, appearing in the room silently.
“So you came here to have a little meltdown about how unfair life is, then?” Draco shoots back acidly. He steps back warily when Potter gets on his feet, surprisingly quickly. He does look like a wreck but in this moment, Draco aches for him so hard that it hurts. The vibrant green eyes display something so raw and intense Draco is compelled to it somehow.
Draco shot a quick glance at the Auror. He was quite rocking the Quidditch outfit. The Auror training had definitely did good: Harry was broader and more muscular but in a discreet and supple way. Something stirred in Draco but he refused to think about it and shook himself internally.
Harry hums in a delighted sound and his green eyes rake over Draco’s body appreciatively.
“Well, there’s nothing much I can do, just be sure to go to St Mungo’s so they can patch you up properly” finally said the brunette, patting him on the shoulder.
“What a lightweight!” sneered the Slytherin.
Ron bristled and gripped the arm of his best friend, determined blue eyes flashing anger and hurt.
“Mother, what..?”
“Are you su-” he stopped when he saw the sink splattered with blood reflected in the mirror.
“Merlin, Potter…” said Malfoy in a breath, devouring him with his starving eyes before kissing him again. The blond fumbled with the fly of his faded jeans, and Harry’s hands hesitantly brushed at the laces in Malfoy’s dark trousers. The blond pressed his hips against his hands, urging him to go on. The last of Harry’s hesitation vanished and he complied happily. His mind, fuzzy with exhaustion and whisky, finally surrendered to the earth-shattering want that filled every fiber of his being.
“Accio, bag!” said Harry happily with a flick of his wand. He opened the duffle bag and took out the tin box that contained two huge sandwiches. He gave one to Draco whose belly growled at the sight. The pale blond suddenly realized he was ravenous.
By noon, the rumour had blown out of proportions and witnesses claimed to anyone who’d listen that Potter had provoked Shacklebot in duel, seized power and disappeared in a lightning storm that had struck Catesby in the head and sent him to St Mungo’s. The Daily prophet was having a field day and Aurors were besieged by the press to get information about the incident and Potter’s wrath that had put the fear of God into half the employees of the Ministry.
, he told himself.
“Fuck you, shut the fuck up, or I swear I’ll-” but his grovel rough voice trailed off and claimed Draco’s mouth with a feral kiss, invading his mouth, battling for dominance with a gruelling fierceness. Draco moaned and Harry swallowed the sound that set him on fire.
“Yes, Draco.” she smiled at him “I know this isn’t the time but I’m relieved to see you well”
Soon they both drift away, in a messy tangle of sweaty limbs.
Very enthusiastic about the whole thing, Luna -who was living with Harry at that time while waiting for her house to be rebuilt- had got one the same year and was since drowning him in quirky messages, as expected.
“You do realize you’re a wizard, right? You could dry your hair like a civilized person, you know” teased Draco.
“Merlin’s haemorroidic bollocks…” he groaned and rolled out of bed. Draco realized he was still wearing the same clothes than yesterday and wrinkled his nose in disgust. How undignified.
No matter what had happened during the day, the sun would always be there the next morning and this simple fact, this childlike certainty would anchor him and he would not get lost, not completely, not irrevocably. The light would be there and the shadows would retreat. Eventually.
“I never realized I had enrolled for the whole package. Do I get to meet your pleasant colleagues as well? I bet they’ll be as thrilled to see me than Granger and the Weasel. We could bond over a little game of Slytherin lynching” said Draco sardonically.
Smiling against his skin, Draco’s mouth gets bolder, tonguing, sucking, licking his way inside with fervour, revelling in the incoherent litany of strangled words falling from Harry’s lips.
“Now go.” his tone was iron-steel.
Harry stretches leisurely, smelling himself and Draco on the sheets and feels a mixture of guilt, sadness and elation at the memory. Arousal is there too as he reminisce and if he can feel himself blushing like a thirteen years old Hufflepuff, he’s rapidly too turned on to care. Still drowsy but now decidedly horny, he slides his right hand under the white linen and wraps his fingers around the hard flesh. He strokes it lazily, reliving the pleasant debauchery of the previous night when it hits him like a bludger in the face.
“Slept well?” asked Draco warily.
Harry gulped the drink in one go without letting him finish his sentence.
Less than half an hour later, they were in the kitchen at Grimmault Place, desperately looking for a way to locate Draco. Luna had joined them and endeavoured to make what looked like the equivalent of the Mediterranean in tea, arguing that there was nothing like a cup of tea in a crisis.
He suddenly felt a surge of gratitude toward Luna for giving him the quirky snake.
“Yes” hisses Harry. He then gathers all the courage he can muster and lets go of the two pieces of his underwear. They’re still facing each other on their knees and Draco starts by kissing his neck, teasing him with that wicked tongue of his. His hands start brushing the sensitive flesh of his nipples and Harry bites his lips to stifle a whimper. Bloody hell, that he can definitely get used to.
Harry and Ron exchanged a mirthful look and tried their best to stifle a snort, what a self-important prick. Harry was sure he had carefully taken the pose for their arrival.
“What I want to do? Don’t you understand? Once I get away from here, the only thing I can hope for is a quick and merciful death. I’ll be hunted, forever.” Fatality coloured his tone. “I appreciate your offer, truly. But I can’t accept.” He returned to the window and looked at the green hills once more, turning his back to the Gryffindor.
“Haven’t you done enough?” he sounds wrecked, almost pleading, and Harry flees.
“Yes” hissed the blond, grey eyes swirling like a winter storm.
They exchanged a thrilled look then Harry let go of the snitch. They both shot at its pursuit, swirling around each other in a daring aerial ballet. Draco felt elation bubbling in his chest, his blood boiling with the pleasure of flying.
“I don’t hate you either” said Malfoy softly.
“You’re ready to live a lie for the rest of your life? To stay with those people who hurt you and coerced you since you were born? You owe nothing to them!”
As he climbed the stairs, he almost didn’t lay his eyes on the door where he had kissed Draco under the influence of the wine that had made him throw all caution to the wind that night. The ex-Auror clenched his teeth and kept climbing
” he said in Parseltongue.
“Is it painful when you breathe or move?”
“No, I… I want you. I want you inside me, Draco…” said Harry roughly, hypnotizing the pale blond who couldn’t detach his eyes from him. “Please” begged Harry, making Draco come back to his senses.
The Gryffindor impatiently threw a huge forkful in his mouth, realizing he hadn’t got anything to eat since the previous night. The crispy-moist-salty-cheesy-oh--god-so-good drew a contented sigh from him and he closed his eyes, enjoying the delicious food. The wine was going perfectly with the food as far as Harry’s meagre oenological experience could tell and the onion soup heavenly warmed his bones. In a few minutes, his dinner was gone.
“You trained to be a Healer back in the day, right? Is there anything you can do?” asked Ron with a pleading voice.
Harry snorted his bubbly cocktail, half-choked on it, coughed and laughed at the same time, tears prickling in his eyes. At the other end of the room, he saw Draco with his eyebrow arched aristocratically and a severe look on his face showing how unimpressed he was with his manners. It made Harry laugh even harder with even messier results. Draco silvery eyes warmed and the corner of his mouth twitched, then he focused on the conversation he was having with a very excited Neville.
“D’you want to come in?” asks Potter when they come to the surface to gasp some air with a voice like gravel that sends spikes of desire in Draco. His eyes are too green and glassy, his lips swollen by their furious kiss. Draco resents any second he’s not making him loose it under his touch but he can see the appeal of a secluded space where they could take their frenzied embrace instead of the sodding street in the middle of the night.
Malfoy’s fingers curled like claws in his shoulders and his head fell back.
“I wouldn’t mind that much” Ron shrugs “ ’s long as you’re happy y’know” he pauses and seems to seriously consider the question. “I mean ‘t would be a bit weird after seein’ you with Ginny, but I wouldn’t mind. It was already weird with Ginny anyway” a drunken smile plays on his lips “and it’s not as if you’ve been busy on that front, eh?”
“Harry, are you hurt??”
When he felt the spinning stop and his feet were back on a stable ground, he blinked slowly. His eyes were blinded by the light around him. He was… in a huge Quidditch pitch, the morning sun gently touching his face for the first time in what felt like years. A soft breeze went gently through his hair.
“Yes! Oh my God, Draco, yes!” Harry cried out and shuddered as he came in an eruption that swept all coherent thought away and replaced it with pure ecstasy, he kept mewling Draco’s name over and over, carelessly, so open. It was the hottest thing Draco had ever seen.
Draco remembers; he does know how it feels. So he gives Harry what he craves for. He’s still too gentle and too slow for Harry’s taste but it will have to do.
Draco never had a more stimulating opponent and he let his own fears and reserve on the ground, executing reckless figures and bold tactics in order to compete with the Gryffindor. Nothing existed anymore beside the flying confrontation. He poured all his frustrations, all his anger and rage, all his fears in this adrenalin blaze.
WARNING: There's a conversation in French in the chapter, you'll find the translation in the notes at the end of the chapter :) enjoy ;)
He rifled through the vines with a deep frown of concentration, ignoring the bramble grazing his skin, burying himself in the familiar task. Then, with a cry of triumph he saw the purple flower with spiky leaves. Careful, Draco cut the base of the stem and collected his prize along with several tufts of plantain.
“He can’t be at the manor, that would be too easy, too predictable” muttered Harry for the fifth time, getting desperate. “Where could he be?”
“So apart from getting plastered with you sworn enemy, what did you plan for you last big night, eh? If you end up in a cell, you might want to speed along to get nice experiences in store. A last shag behind a tapestry?”
“Same” said Hermione sheepishly.
Harry rolls his eyes and wonders if he’s sober enough to apparate home. It’s been a hell of a long week. On the other hand, he could use a dozen shots of Firewhisky to forget all this mess.
“None taken. Ginny and I aren’t together anymore anyway”
His desire was building inside him at an alarming rate, it was as if lava was licking up his spine, getting him closer and closer to the edge. He heard without hearing the blond’s strangled cries and groans, making his blood boil. His hips responded and bucked against him vehemently. Harry thrust harder and faster, setting a frenzied pace, fisting Draco’s hair and forcing his mouth on his roughly. As their climax grew closer, their breathing was erratic, hating the fabric between their skins, hating each other, scratching, biting, choking as if their lives depended on it. Then Draco’s whole body suddenly tensed and he came with a shameless moan, a strong quiver running through his muscles. At the sight of total abandon on the blond’s face, a white-hot surge of pleasure crashed on Harry. He came with a low grunt, half-buried in his throat. His whole body shuddered as he rode the last waves of his orgasm, letting his head fall on Draco’s hot and sweaty shoulder. His head was spinning dangerously and his whole body was shaking and aching.
“What is it, Harry?”
“Well if it deranges you that much, I reckon I’m doing something right then!” Draco fumes “Because as far as I’m concerned,
“Okay, well, that’s great! Do we know him? Is he from work?”
Draco’s skin is deathly pale, it barely stands out from his crisp white shirt. His face tilts up and he looks at his reflection in the mirror, his grey eyes full of swirling ghosts. The scenes suddenly reminds Harry so strongly of that day in sixth year that his stomach rolls, filling his mouth with saliva as he is invaded by nausea.
They’re sprawled on the armchairs Draco conjures every week in front of the fire. Well, to be fair, Harry is sprawled while Draco is sitting elegantly like the posh git he is, legs crossed, his glass of wine dangling off the tip of his fingers delicately. He’s more relaxed than usual though; half a bottle of wine will have that effect on him Harry has learned. He likes this Draco. He’s more relaxed, softer around the edges. His face is more mobile and his eyes not as unreadable. Harry has obviously zapped out for a while but Draco’s voice snaps him out of it. Even his voice is different on those Friday nights.
“Don’t thank me yet” said Harry mischievously “Put on some gear and let’s see if I can kick your ass once and for all!” he threw him one of the bags and pointed a door “Lockers are this way”.
Ron burst out laughing so the responsibility to tell the story befell on Harry.
His platinum hair shining under the morning sun, the tall blond headed toward the inextricable tangle of rough weeds and crouched on the ground in his smart trousers, rolling his sleeves above the elbows and leaning in the shady mess with his blade.
Draco didn’t want to dampen the mood, he thus abstained from pointing out he could barely get out of Grimmault Place without fearing a slow and painful death, so considering a career wasn’t currently in order. Not to mention the reaction he would get if he actually tried to become a Healer in Britain. Nobody would be thrilled to see him anytime soon.
His voice was rising up, becoming more and more heated until he started shouting.
“What the hell are you doing here?” Draco snarls with a high pitch that betrays his near heart attack but Potter doesn’t answer and keeps staring at the wall.
“Why, Jean, you know me so well already” Draco sighs deeply, sending Harry a fond smile.
“Okay, okay, I’ll go to bed…” he opened a glassy eye. “You’re way too bossy for your own good” he observed then got up painfully and slowly climbed the stairs. When he crashed on his bed, his last thought was of lemons.
“You didn't have any Hangover potion so I tried to make something that would…”
She chuckled.
“Yeah, well I use quite a lot and I didn’t really see the difference anyway...”
” said Luna’s ethereal and absent voice.
“Well, I wish I could be half the flyer you are, to be honest. I’m not entirely sure you’re not part bird after what I saw up there!” he said admiringly. Draco had been able to claim victory on him a few times but he wasn’t entirely sure Harry hadn’t let him win. “It would explain the brains, I suppose” Draco added teasingly.
“Well, you did invite me, you know?” He rummaged in his inside pocket and threw him a white cardboard engraved in silver letters. “Or at least I figured your father did. I must say, he’s quite bold in his reconquest of the lost family shine. Practice, I guess.”
“Malfoy… God you’re so tight…” he trailed off.
“Yes, I know Hermione and… I know I never say much but… it matters. A lot. You and Ron, you’re everything I have, you know that, right?” he smiled shyly, scratching the nape of his neck, watching pointedly at the floor.
They remained silent for a while. Then Draco sighed.
“Are you going to finally say something or you’re just going to stay here, as mute as a bloody statue?” he snapped.
“And I’m sure you’d love nothing more than a cuddle-session with a lion” answered Draco acidly “at least it would rip that stupid smile off your face”
It’s nothing like it was the last time they got together. That time he was all careful and controlled, thoughtful and hesitant with inexperience. Potter/Jean was responsive but shy and probably apprehensive at the time, thinks Draco retrospectively. But this time, he lets it all out: the anger, the betrayal, the pain; but also the feelings he has repressed for too long. More than anything, he unchains the unadulterated want awaken by Potter’s hard body pressed against his and his blood roars with it.
“You’re welcome” whispered Harry, who was indeed standing very close, teetering a little.
“Eh! Not everyone is a control freak you know” Harrys answers with an offended tone.
“I see. I thought you too proud to become my husband’s lackey” she stated nonchalantly.
Being a girl sucks. The constant stares at his ass or breasts, the way creeps look at him like eye-candy and call him ‘honey or ‘sweetheart’ or ‘love’ with this disgusting tone, or the way everyone thinks he is something delicate that’s about to break, blergh. He is sick of it. Harry has to constantly restrain himself so as not to punch or hex the guys who have wandering hands or make lewd comments, and it has only been a week. How on earth can women stand this on a daily basis without hexing everyone’s balls off?
“So, why tell me then?”
Harry still isn’t happy about the fact that he has to wear shirts and normal trousers but Hermione and him compromised on the boots. Heels were absolutely out of the question and the alternatives made him want to puke, a fact that he made no secret of, resulting in the first eye-roll he ever saw coming from Hermione. Ever.
“Beg your pardon, Potter?”
“The hell I’m going back to bed, you stupid Gryffindor prat…” mumbled Draco as he stepped in the door and assessed the damage.
Malfoy shook his head and carded fingers in his silky white strands with a smile bordering on insane, irreparably tousling the white mane smeared with blood and soot. He looked a breath away from a meltdown. Then something seemed to snap inside him. He stood, back ramrod straight, still looking dignified despite his sullied clothes and apalling state and stepped around the desk, leaning on the front of the piece of furniture. He observed his hands speculatively then sighed again and grabbed the bottle. Malfoy held it to Harry wearily and raised a white eyebrow in mocking challenge.
“Hum, not really…We all knew him at school, though”
But Draco doesn’t have much time to ponder on the matter because Potter manhandles him inside and a second later he’s pressed up against the door and kissed —or rather devoured— by Potter’s greedy mouth.
“Yes, yes like that, just like that” Draco sobs, his whole body tensed like a bow.
“Shame! Now look at you, all drunk and vulnerable, what if I decided to take advantage of you?”
“The trial will begin shortly begin, take your seats” boomed an old stern wizard in purple robes, startling him out if his reverie.
After a rapid inspection of the medicine cabinet –hopeless-, Draco resigned himself to brew his own Hangover Potion. After all, it was rather simple and the pale blond could’ve done it in his sleep.
“What the…? What happened to you??”
The man scoffed, visibly amused by Draco’s menacing tone.
“Don’t listen to him Draco! He’s the one who’s nothing, the slave of a man greater and more powerful than he will ever be. A man that treated him like a dog because he knew what cowardice and mediocrity lied inside him…”
“Mate, you need to calm down. I’m on your side okay? If you say the ferret’s in danger, I believe you and I’ll be by your side no matter what, like I’ve always been. I just had to ask, okay?”
Harry chuckled as a cuddly snake wriggled his way on his chest, invading his shirt.
“I certainly don’t have time for another one of your lectures about my deviant ways, what a poor excuse for a son I am, my general unworthiness or whatever else you had planned!
Ron dropped the plate he was cleaning which crashed on the floor with a loud noise. He turned to face Harry, gaping.
” said Harry.
“Let them in, Eveleen” said Catesby grandly.
“I killed a man. People died. Friends, family” he winced as he was invaded by pictures of stiff bodies laying in the Great Hall, covered in grime and blood. “I don’t see much cause for celebration”
Hermione was sitting on the workbench, something in her expression told Harry he wouldn’t have much respite before a good old grilling.
” observed Harry.
“Merlin, you’re hot” he blurts out and Draco’s lips stretch in a little surprised smile that breaks something in his chest. The blond kneels on the bed and a stray ray of moonlight catches the shiny scar that mars his chest. It’s like someone kicked Harry in the stomach. The nausea comes back in a split second as his mind is invaded once more by flashes of the sordid scene in the girls bathroom.
“It… smells nice” he said tentatively.
Harry has come out to Ron and Hermione a few years ago and it went well enough, though fairly awkward at first. But Ron never mentioned it again and Harry doesn’t know what he really thinks about his best friend liking blokes, so he never talked about it after that either. But for the second time that night, the redhead’s answer leaves him utterly gobsmacked.
The silver-blond finally notices the rigidity of his posture. Potter’s shoulder line is tense; his jaw clenched, chin tilted up in what looks like brazen challenge. His eyes though, tell the real story. He’s obviously feeling embarrassed about his body.
“Thanks” finally said Draco without looking at Harry. His eyes were shut and his face tilted toward the sun, basking in the warm light.
“Yes, I’m sure… Just… go slowly” he says quickly, cheeks burning. Draco smiles again and covers his body with the long line of his. He kisses Harry again soothingly and the Gryffindor opens his legs wider instinctively, kissing him back with an urgency that surprises him.
“I’ve been selected for Healer training at St Mungo’s” Draco finally blurted out, just to break the heavy silence.
“Harry, you look exhausted…”
Thunderstruck, the pale blond looked at the hand Harry was stretching out in front of him.
“I can’t think of one reason why Lucius Malfoy –an esteemed member of the Wizarding community and the primary benefactor of countless charities for years- would engage in such nefarious activities. Those are very serious accusations -and rather grotesque ones I might add. If you haven’t any proof to support that theory of yours, I’m afraid there’s nothing I can do.”
“You… you what? You brewed a Polyjuice potion? At twelve???” Draco couldn’t believe it. “And… why did you Polyjuiced as Crabbe and Goyle, of all people??”
Hermione ignores his childish comment and goes on, as per usual, explaining their plan.
“You’re actually pretty good at that, you know?”
“I came to testify on your behalf and your mother’s” answered Harry simply, holding the icy-cold grey gaze serenely. Malfoy didn’t avert his eyes but nothing showed on his frozen features. A long pause stretched between them.
“Anonymous tip and word of the street, corroborated by reliable informers” Harry lied defiantly.
When Ron’s shift changes Harry takes up the habit of having a drink or two in Draco’s office after their Friday sessions. They talk about small things, debate which Star Wars movies is the best, fight over Quidditch results and compete to see who can come up with the most ludicrous piece of imaginary Ministry gossip while sipping at various wines. Draco felt personally insulted when Harry told him that no, he didn’t know the difference between a
The blond raises his hips, silently urging him to move and Potter gets the message. He starts thrusting in and out, his breath getting heavier and heavier, more erratic. Then he angles his hips and Draco suddenly sees stars.
“It’s not much, but I thought you could use a plate of hot food.”
Draco was holding the window casing so hard his knuckles had turned white. He gazed at the horizon, as if staring hard enough at those green hills would somehow make him disapparate and run away from this nonsense.
“And that’s with Hermione’s good influence, imagine without it, we would have been expelled in first year” said Ron.
“I’m not afraid of you” Draco shot back with a confidence he wasn’t feeling.
“Hominum revelio” whispered Luna “There’s someone in there”
He could see his own exultation on Harry’s face and knew that the same savage thrill was coursing through his veins like lava, the same liquid fire licking up his spine.
“You think Catesby might be involved?”
“That’s why you’re looking like a sodding zebra.”
“Oh and I’m sure you would be thrilled to know all the details about me shagging blokes, eh?” Harry says snarkily without his usual restraint. Damn, he
Harry knows he should stop. He knows this is wrong, he knows he has pushed it too far already; he knows Draco would never do this if he knew who he really is but he cannot think. His head is full of grey lustful eyes, the smell of lemons and Draco’s intoxicating presence. So when he leans forward and kisses him again, Harry lets him in and revels in the fiery sensations that the deft tongue awakens in him.
“That filthy-blasted-slimy-bugger!!!!!!!” he shouted forcefully.
Harry didn’t answer, he laughed and cleared his throat.
“You won’t have to worry about her long. That little stunt didn’t do much to ingratiate herself with your father. His patience was already running thin but now, there’s no going back to being Mrs Malfoy I’m afraid.” The snobbish voice laughed “Shame, really. Such a beautiful, refined flower. Quite exquisite, if you ask me. And clever at that. Obviously not enough to know her right place but still, shame.”
“But… I mean…
Draco took a moment to answer, distracted.
“I can protect you.” said Harry calmly. “Come with me at Grimmault Place, you can stay as long as you want and think about what you want to do.”
“Nice reflexes” said the slender blond nonchalantly. “I was about to have some tea, care for a cup?”
With the help of several Healers, Narcissa’s curse was halted then reversed. She was still worryingly weak and would need intense care for the following weeks but she would live.
“Let me” he said and raised his wand upon Harry.
“Malfoy” spat Harry. “Where’s Draco?”
“What about you, huh?” Draco says briskly, raising a brow speculatively. He walks around Harry slowly, appraising him from head to toe like a horse that’s up for sale.
“I don’t want you to leave me alone” says Draco, as surprised as Potter by his words.
“Why don’t you show me, then?” Answered Harry with a provocative glint in his eyes that went straight to Draco’s cock.
Harry’s still high from his climax and he has trouble forming a coherent thought. He turns to face Draco and watches him contentedly. Draco turns his head and looks at him, his steel-grey eyes are bright and for once, he doesn’t look out of his reach. He’s here, real, flesh and blood and they just shared something so intimate it swells inside Harry’s chest. But it soon crashes down when he realizes it’s not true. Jean and Draco shared it. Not him.
“Hermione, you’re a genius!” shouted Harry and hugged her tightly.
“You’re welcome Harry” she said, beaming. “We should do this more often” she added.
“How did you get in? And what did you do?”
He smiled a sickening sweet smile.
Harry was about to explode but Ron’s hand on his forearm and his concerned blue eyes urged him to stay calm. He bit down his spiteful -and decidedly rude- answer, simmering inside.
After a huge serving of a divine carrot cake, Ron, Hermione, Harry and Draco were all sated and quite merry considering the unknown number of bottles of wine that had been sacrificed throughout the night. Luna had fallen asleep on a deckchair and Harry conjured a blanket over her thin shoulders. The remaining four were still chatting cheerfully about this and that, enjoying the moment. Harry, Al wrapped around his shoulders like a huge scaly scarf, watched Draco on the sly. The pale blond was talking animatedly with his friends, his hands moving and his eyes sparkling with pleasure and laughter. He had rarely seen him so unguarded. The Slytherin must have sensed Harry’s stare because his gaze shot up to meet his and the unidentified gleam Harry read in the silvery pools made him shiver. He quickly got back to the conversation and didn’t notice the grey eyes trained on him.
“I’m sure.”

“I wasn’t really but… he really needed a place to crash and I offered. It was kinda sudden, he was in a pretty crappy situation”.
Draco smiled widely.
“So, what’s the plan now?” said Ron, concentration painting his freckled features.
To make matters worse, he has received an owl from Parson, telling him that he and Hermione finally cracked his case. Of course she has, she’s a bloody genius that one. Not even a dark curse etched into a antique obscure knife could resist her. He should be back in his own body in a few days according to them. Harry has been lying awake, clearly unable to know how he is feeling about it. And trying to figure out what he is going to do about those feelings once the curse is gone. When Hermione had showed up the following day, he had pretexted a nasty cold to avoid her. He isn’t anywhere ready to face her yet, she would figure him out in a split second.
It meant that Lucius had no reason to keep Draco alive.
A cold silence stretched between them. Draco fidgeted with his dark leather gloves and Harry kept busy on the workbench.
“Come with me.”
“U ok, mate?” muttered Harry.
At his utmost surprise, Draco was waiting for him in the kitchen, looking almost nervous. He was fantastically dishevelled, all tousled white hair, smeared cheekbone and wrinkled clothes. The Slytherin took in the soaking mess that was Harry and his eyes widened.
“Bloody hell” Malfoy sighed, letting his head fall back against the wooden panel with a thud. He appeared to brace himself and went for the desk. Malfoy plopped down on the chair dispiritedly and rummaged through the drawers. He must have found what he was looking for because he let out a satisfied groan.
So he presses himself against the hard pale body and grips his tensed thighs through the fabric of his fancy trousers. Draco groans, making Harry’s blood race inside his veins.
“I’m not afraid of them. And Draco, it
“It’s so weird, mate” muses the redhead. They must be at their fourth round; his blue eyes are starting to get glassy and his mouth a bit slack.
“I should explain myself, I-”
“Yes, yes! There, just there!” sobbed Malfoy, as if he was on the verge of crying “Just stay right there…”
He hung up and pressed his fists on his eyes, panic rising inside of him like an uncontrollable flood threatening to drown him.
“Yes, um no, I don’t know. He’s gone and…” Harry shook himself “I’m sorry, I’ve been all over the place. I think he went to meet his mother somewhere… She escaped and Lucius is after her. Do you have any idea where he or she might be?” he asked, a stupid surge of hope flaring inside him.
