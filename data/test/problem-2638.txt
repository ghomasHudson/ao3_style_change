Potter blushed and scowled, which was irritatingly attractive on him. “She doesn’t work here at all.”
“Along the same lines, sort of. I’ll be doing an apprenticeship with Madam Pomfrey next year. She’s hoping to retire soon, and I’m to replace her. I’ll need to do a year of Healer training, too, but first I’m going to stay here at Hogwarts to shadow her.”
“Harry. It’s not stupid,” Hermione said. “Surely you understand how important this election is.”
Potter stood and slammed Draco into the wall, hard. “Don’t tell me what to do,” he hissed against Draco’s throat, and then began kissing and licking it again.
“Dunno,” Harry said, leaning towards him and skimming his hand along the front of the sheer shirt, making Draco shiver a little. “You might have to ply me with free shots first.”
Lia didn’t murder them, but she gave them a verbal lashing that felt a bit like death. Draco couldn’t bring himself to care even a little bit. That night, in the barracks, Harry reached over and grabbed his hand and held it. Draco squeezed back, and they smiled at each other in the dark.
She smiled and leaned over to kiss him quickly on the cheek. “Well, good morning to you, too,” she said.
After she left, Draco’s father gave him another sip of tea. “You’ll need to force yourself to stand tall. You mustn’t let him see you so weak. Fall apart afterward, if you must.”
“He – yes. To some extent. I don’t know how much.”
He looked into Harry’s eyes and kissed him once more, gently again. “I have to go.”
It was the last one.
“I bet your mouth tastes like it, too,” Malfoy said, looking up at him.
“Ohhh,” Draco said, nodding, trying to adjust to this new, alien world that had suddenly materialized around him. A world where Harry Potter liked boys. Nothing would ever be the same, probably. It was entirely possible that they’d walk outside to find that the sky was green and the grass was blue. Except it was dark now, so it would be rather difficult to tell. “So, did you ever mess around with blokes? Or not?”
And then the Prophet photos of Potter and Blaise came out, and a few days later, Draco came back to her parents’ house, begging for her forgiveness, asking if they could reinstate their engagement. She’d said yes, and within a week, the announcement was in the Prophet, the date was set, and Potter had decided to move to America. It had all worked out for the best, and since then, life had been easy and predictable and Draco had fallen in love with her properly.
“Oh my god,” said Harry, “I honestly thought you were going to want to wait.” He stood and picked up Stormy and set her gently onto the patio. She looked up at him, slightly annoyed. “Sorry, babe,” he said to her, and pulled Draco up against him. “I need him for a moment.”
“Dating,” Draco said, feeling like he was going to fall over.
“He is the
And this shouldn't concern you except that
“I want you to fuck me, Harry,” Draco said, his voice barely more than a moan.
me, although I saw you there,” Draco said.
How could he have found that funny, even in his head, even for a moment? What the fuck was wrong with him?
“Mr. Potter,” said Marcia, pointing at Harry with her pen. Marcia was sharper than Skeeter had been, and more professional, but only by a little bit. “How do you feel about running alongside Mr. Malfoy, given the bad blood between the two of you from your Hogwarts years and the war?”
“Sorry,” Draco said, looking over. “Needed to get away from her.”
Potter, to his credit, didn’t spit out his drink. “I like whatever,” he said. “I’m not picky.”
So, okay, maybe he’d been really, really angry a few times in his life. And, now that he thought about it, all those instances had involved Harry Potter, which made sense, really, because Potter was an infuriating person.
“Really?” said Pansy, narrowing her eyes. “Because from what I can tell, she was the only other person on the planet besides you with knowledge of the engagement, at least initially, and she’s the one who had the most to gain from splitting the two of you up.”
“Done and done,” Pansy said, giving her a rather come-hither grin.
Draco considered him. “Probably suck his cock. How would you say your skills rate in that area?”
There was a short burst of laughter and Draco looked up, surprised. “Is that what you think? Christ, Draco.“
“Does this have to do with the man who hurt Sarah?”
!” Draco snapped.
Draco desperately wanted to know more, but he let the matter drop. Instead, he laughed as he listened to the soldiers at his table bickering and joking together. The man next to Frankie was as tall as she was short, a great, hulking bloke named Pike. He reminded Draco of a good-natured Greg Goyle. Not necessarily the brightest crayon in the box, but quite funny in his way, and clearly devoted to Frankie and Lia.
But I can't turn away
Running from us
The castle on the lake was just sitting there, vacant. It came with house elves to keep it up, but it seemed sad and empty when Harry visited.
“What?” asked Draco. He waited for a moment, and Harry shifted behind him. He heard Harry take a deep breath. “Oh god, you’re going to get all serious on me, aren’t you? We’re going to have a talk, right now, while your cock is in my arse.”
“Mm,” she said, bending down to kiss his cheek, letting him take in the softness and subtle perfume of her skin. “Of course.” She sat down at the table, looking over the breakfast Mimsy had set out, and took several pieces of fruit and a piece of toast, unbuttered, and one soft-boiled egg. She spread a tiny amount of marmalade over the toast and took two bites and decided that was probably enough of that. She ate her fruit and her egg, though, her eyes on Draco as he resumed his play with Scorpius.
It was surprisingly simple, as it turned out, to separate these two Dracos, to pretend like they had nothing to do with one another. They were quite different, after all. One was full of self-loathing and guilt and neediness, and lived to be fucked by someone who gave him only the tiniest crumbs of affection. The other was a nearly whole, normal person.
“Um, no. You’re a Potter.”
“Because I think love’s a load of bollocks. I prefer to be in relationships that have a little zip to them. The ones that flare up quickly and die off quicker, rather than the ones that linger in purgatory for all of eternity.” She shifted so that her legs were pulled up underneath her on the elegant blue armchair.
The library didn’t seem quite private enough, nor did either of the Common Rooms. He considered his own room but Blaise might be there, because he had a free period, too. Hermione’s room might work, but then again, that might be a little
“And why did I end our first engagement?” he asked.
“Where was I? Oh, yes. Draco soon realized that their constant partying wasn’t doing them any favors. They were all always hungover, and Draco was getting depressingly mediocre marks on his Healer exams –”
Harry slid his hand over the bulge in Draco’s pants, and Draco tried to lift his hips, to press further into it, but Harry had him fairly well trapped. “Fuck,” he found himself whining.
“I was all lean muscle,” Draco said, pretending to scowl. “As for the shirt, wear it or don’t. See if I care that you’re wandering about half naked.”
“Good morning,” Sarah whispered.
Pansy and Draco had been dancing together, as they tended to, but Draco needed a drink. Pansy flitted off to find Blaise, and when she did, she slung her arms around his neck and Blaise wrapped his arms around her waist, and Draco laughed. It was so funny that those two didn’t think anyone knew they were fucking. He was almost certain
,” he’d said the other day. Draco wanted to point out that in a few years, Harry would very much appreciate Draco’s carefully cultivated appearance, and want to do dirty things to Draco because of it, but he managed to refrain.
After Potter obliviated the muggles, they were on to the third site, which was in the middle of a quiet, residential street in Leeds. Potter obliviated the three people who happened to walk past while Draco was casting, but once again, it was all for naught.
Potter walked towards Draco with his wand still raised. “What are you doing in here?”
“I think the Dark Lord is going to be fairly well pleased, overall,” said Dolohov, stepping closer. Draco didn’t like the look on his face. He didn’t like it one bit.
“Try me.”
It was busy, the lunch crowd starting up, late morning shoppers still bustling about. He walked, looking around, until he came to a sign that read “Malfoy’s Potions and Tonics” in golden lettering. Taking a deep breath, he pulled open the door.
“What kind of trouble?” asked Draco.
According to Harry, Draco had plenty of bothersome habits, too. Draco didn’t agree, obviously, but Harry claimed he took too long on his hair and cared too much about appearance in general. “You’re like a
“You kissed me back,” Malfoy said. He reached over for his gin and tonic, which, miraculously, had not been knocked over during their tussle, and took a long gulp, spilling some down his chin. “I’m going to look into this for you.”
“You’re a fucker, Harry!” exclaimed Ron.
“You’re still an arsehole,” Potter said, when they were both fairly drunk and back to pints, nursing them slowly now.
“I can’t go home with you. I’m sorry,” Draco said, and his voice sounded like silk snagging and ripping along a trail of broken glass, both impossibly soft and shredded, all at once. “I know you don’t really want this. You’re drunk. It’ll just end up like last time.”
Harry shuddered. He didn’t want McGonagall knowing about sex, or thinking that Harry or any of his friends ever had it. He didn’t want to consider why she hadn’t set those particular wards here. No, he did not.
“Much,” said Harry. He pulled the neck of the sweater over his face. “Smells like you. How you smell now, anyway. You didn’t wear this cologne when I was last around you.”
Then, right next to Draco’s head, the oven timer went off, and a loud, jarring beep filled the kitchen. They both jumped and looked at each other with wide eyes. “Lasagna,” said Harry, grinning sheepishly.
“I shouldn’t…we shouldn’t. This. I can’t do this.” He was sitting up, pushing Harry away.
Potter shoved his fingers back in. “Be nice, or I’ll just do this all night.”
She blinked at him. “You – you did? How? When? Did you go through? What happened?”
Malfoy’s hand slipped up underneath Harry’s t-shirt, and Malfoy began scratching his back. Harry sighed and twisted his leg up with Malfoy’s. This felt heavenly.
. The cover of the magazine was a picture of their overlapping profiles, Harry looking in one direction, Draco in the other, with the tagline “The Dream Team: Malfoy and Potter take England by Storm.” It was a fun interview, and the woman who’d conducted it, Myrna Travers, spoke about the “chemistry” that they had, and how wonderful it was that they were friends and not just political allies. It was a very well-received piece and that, coupled with Draco’s first debate with Theo, gave them a boost in the polls.
He ran his hand along the elegant lines of Time-Turner once more and tucked it carefully back under Clarke’s robes. And then he made his way home, one painful step after another. He didn’t sleep that night, only stared at the ceiling, while memories of nights full of tangled limbs and soft hands pressed down on him, making it hard to breathe.
Hoping I would find true love along the broken road
The back door opened and Seamus came stumbling out, clearly wrecked. “Oi, Harry!” he cried. “Just the man I wanted to see. C’mere. Dean broke up with me again and I need to be comforted. With your cock, preferably.”
Potter bit at his shoulder. “Be nice, Draco.”
Several times through breakfast, Draco noticed that Hermione and Weasley tried to distract Potter, engage him, but Potter was having none of it. It was as though he were not just a Parseltongue, but an actual snake, and Draco a little mouse scurrying through a field.
Blaise nodded, meeting his eyes for a moment. Then he smiled broadly again. “Hannah here tells me Seamus got his tongue pierced.”
I could see for miles, miles, miles
“Oh my god,” the blonde one cries, finally, laughing. “Oh my god, Madam
They spoke little, too aware of the risks they faced, too worried about being caught and captured before they even reached the sea.
But the idea that Potter deserved good things resonated with him. There was something about Potter – maybe his status as a hero, maybe his inherent goodness, or maybe the little bit of brokenness in him – that made you want to make him happy. If Katie really thought he wasn’t happy with her, he could sort of understand why she’d set him free, despite the personal cost.
“It’s not. You hate nature, don’t you?”
.” This was torture now, god. He was almost ready to shove his own hand up there.
– boyfriend.
She went to the shitty grocery store in Lubec later that day and stopped for coffee at the only coffee shop in town. She told Myrna, the waitress, about the giant cat.
His father gave him a cursory nod, and Draco could only guess at what it meant.
Draco could relate. He was shaking with fury. He looked over at Harry, who was clenching and unclenching his fists, the look in his eyes murderous.
. He’s devastated. And he’s my friend.”
“Hmm, is that what you’ve been doing all alone in your farmhouse, then, Harry?”
He came back in and pulled Charlie into his arms and apologized. They kissed their way into their small bedroom with its patchwork quilt and Charlie fucked him like he was trying to chase away Harry’s demons. Harry found himself crying as he came, Charlie’s mouth covering his.
“Yes, exactly.” Potter paused, his eyes on Draco’s. “That’s why I think we should start a campaign to do away with the houses.”
“Ron, I don’t want to date you. I’m not in love with you.”
Tonight, she was thinking about one of their last conversations before that night in the warehouse. In particular, she was thinking about how Daphne had asked her why she would want to be with a man who didn’t love her fully, who didn’t miss her when she was away, or crave her kisses or her touch. Astoria had argued that Draco had loved her before Harry came back, but Daphne had just given her that look, the one that said Astoria might be able to fool everyone else, but never her own sister.
talks about anything from before he moved to Chicago. He’s very mysterious, our Harry.”
“I’ve been thinking,” Potter said.
He nodded tersely. “We knew it was going to happen.”
! They’re going out on a date!”
“Last Saturday.”
“Where we come from, magic isn’t limited to one race,” Potter said, bringing himself into the conversation.
Draco squeezed his eyes shut as Harry’s mouth descended down the length of his cock, everything so slick and hot. Harry tilted his head a little so that Draco’s cockhead was pushing at the inside of his cheek, and Draco could see it moving against the skin there, and that almost broke him. “Harry. Fucking
No one else seemed particularly worried. They had begun truth or dare, and Draco walked in on Blaise daring Pansy to kiss him.
“You’re so fucking weird,” Harry said, laughing. “Does this mean we can keep them?”
Potter seemed not to realize it for a while, but then his eyes flickered over towards Draco and away, and then shot back towards him once more. “What the fuck, Malfoy!” he cried, pulling the towel around his waist.
“I dunno,” Charlie said, looking more anxious than Harry’d ever seen him. He looked at Harry and gently brushed his fringe out of his eyes. “You know I love you, don’t you?”
“No, that’s his name,” Lia said, laughing. On his other side, Harry was leaning against him, a reassuring weight. Draco put a hand on the back of Harry’s neck and stroked the skin there with his thumb, and Harry grinned over at him before turning back to the big man. “He tells a good yarn; he’s our resident storyteller, you might say.”
sleeping with?
Astoria looked calm and collected as she took Draco’s hand. “I’ve known since before we were married. Draco was very open with me; he didn’t want to lie to me. And once we were married, we tried to make it work, tried to live as man and wife, but, you know…”
He slipped out of bed and jumped into the shower and dressed, then went downstairs to dig his coffee maker out of a cupboard. He kept it around because he liked a cup of coffee sometimes, too, and he thought it might be a nice thing to do, to make some for Euri.
“I told you I could –” Hermione began.
“I’ll try. And either way, I’ll fight,” Draco said.
Harry knew that Draco was going to see the priest after work. He might already be there. And since he didn’t fancy sitting around in Draco’s flat while he was away, Harry decided that he would go out with Lavender. Blaise and Parvati came along, like usual, and Michael Corner joined them again. When Harry saw him striding towards their table, he had a moment of panic, because what if Corner remembered how Harry had behaved that night at Draco’s flat? Draco had obliviated him, true, but it had been rushed and the situation had been chaotic, so who knew whether it had been done properly.
“S’alright,” said Harry. “I guess.”
He’d spent a week here after his father was attacked in Azkaban. Lucius had never woken up, hadn’t ever recovered. Draco had watched, helpless, as he’d succumbed slowly to his injuries, as whatever was left of his will to live dissolved into nothing. And after, Draco had vowed to become a Healer, so that he never had to feel like that again.
“Don’t be mean,” Potter said, kissing his cheek. “But no. Definitely not.”
“Um…” said Harry, and Charlie looked more afraid than Harry had ever seen him look, even in the face of possible death-by-dragon.
Draco nodded, struggling to hold on.
Draco got up and stretched. “Well. Goodnight, then.”
Harry picked up his glass and clinked with the others. “To a night without the rugrats,” Ron said, grinning.
Malfoy looked down, his long, pale lashes brushing his cheeks. “I don’t – ah. Well. I don’t have quite the – um, reservations – that you appear to have. So.”
“Not long, I should think. A day? Two days? I can’t quite remember.”
“Lovely,” agreed Hermione.
“I can explain –” said Malfoy, who was most definitely Malfoy again.
When Potter fell asleep (for real; he was snoring this time), Draco wanked again.
In the Great Hall during lunch, Potter was watching him. Blatantly. Draco could feel his gaze burning along his skin. Something electric was buzzing inside him, agitating and hot. He turned towards Potter when he couldn’t bloody stand it any longer and gave him a hard glare. Potter only let his mouth curl up into a little smile – almost a smirk – and then turned away, taking another bite of his food and saying something to Granger.
“I am,” William said. He laughed. “I can’t really believe it, either. I never thought I’d have…this. With anyone, much less a man like Alexander. I know you don’t know him that well, but he’s wonderful.”
“Because Etherean stories are better,” Lia said, knocking against Frankie playfully.
He would only need to take them back, tomorrow. He would check in with his bosses in Mysteries, send owls to his family and friends to confirm that he was alive and well, and then he would return. He would come back here, to this world where he wasn’t Draco Malfoy, former Death Eater, where he wasn’t universally eyed with suspicion, where he didn’t feel the need to make amends everywhere he went. He’d come back to this world, this place where he was the Dragon, a hero, beloved by the people, and where the man who would soon sit on the throne looked at him with almost bruising tenderness and trusted him implicitly.
“Oh,” said Harry, biting his lip.
Draco laughed. “I wouldn’t dream of it.”
That never forget
Surely not. No way. There was no way he’d liked it.
Harry kissed him again, deep and slow, every stroke of his tongue a caress, and then he felt Harry’s warm, firm grip along his shaft. He moved his hips helplessly towards it, wanting more, more friction, more touch. More anything.
Now it was Draco’s turn to look away. None of this was going according to plan. He felt uncertain and unsteady. “Did you contact anyone from the Prophet the night Blaise kissed Harry?”
not,” said Euri fretfully.
She giggled. “Obviously that’s not the only thing. But it’s possibly the most disturbing part. Sure, he’s fit, I suppose, but he seems like such a prat!”
He finally chanced a glance at his mother, who looked shocked but was also smiling at him, and then at Pansy, who was crying a little and beaming.
Harry shrugged. “I’ve had a few times in my life where I was happy. I mean, really happy. Deeply happy. I think I knew it at the time. And now I definitely know it, looking back.”
?” asked Harry, somehow more surprised by this than anything else.
Daphne shrugged. “It could be Euri, too. Maybe he’s trying to make you jealous, plain and simple.”
Could you be my best friend?
Scorpius nodded and climbed up onto a chair, his little legs hardly hanging off the seat at all. He put his hands in his lap and looked at the charts on the wall. “What do those say?” he asked.
Harry shook his head again, still smiling, and turned back to the portrait of the fat lady. He whispered the password, which, once more, Draco could very clearly hear. He hoped Harry never did any undercover work as an Auror, because he seemed incapable of stealth. The portrait swung open, but before he went in, Harry turned around and gave Draco one more appraising look. “See you later, Draco.”
You push and you push and I'm pulling away
“A few things,” Malfoy said. “I can’t cook, though. I’m really terrible at it. I have a house elf that comes in on Saturdays and makes things for me for the week. By Friday, though, I’m usually out of actual meals.”
Pansy giggled. “Something I should know about, then? Are you finally making your move?”
Draco thought that sounded wonderful. He settled his head back onto Harry’s shoulder. “Yes, let’s do that. We haven’t flown in forever.”
Draco hesitated for a moment before nodding.
Potter proceeded to lick every ounce of come from Draco’s stomach, crawling all over him to do it, his hair tickling Draco’s skin, his tongue hot and wet. Draco could feel Potter’s cock pressing against him, moving against his bare skin through the fabric of his trousers.
Suddenly, the locket burst open, and something thick and black and oily tore out of it and raced into the sky, gathering there like a monstrous cloud. Ron was looking up at it in horror, the sword dangling uselessly from his hand.
“Fine,” said Blaise, picking up his books rather aggressively. “Fine. You make this big deal about how you want something more from me, and then I give it to you, and then you say it’s not enough. You’re impossible, Draco. Goddamnit. Nobody’s ever going to be perfect enough for you, you realize this, don’t you?”
“According to him, Hermione.”
“Why’d you decide to work? If you could have just done nothing forever?”
“But we were absolutely pissed…” He trailed off and slumped against the headboard.
“I want to,” Draco whispered. “I want to taste you.”
“I’m afraid I
, and he was Draco Malfoy.
“Git,” Harry said. “I’ll come find you after a drink or two.”
He didn’t get too touchy with her – none of the sliding his hands over her breasts as he’d done with maybe-Tessa – and Harry didn’t know if that was some ability of Draco to read his volunteer or just that it was Hermione. The fact that it was Hermione certainly didn’t stop him from sticking his cock near her face or grinding on her or running his hands through her hair.
“Until I left,” muttered Harry.
, and at the time, he was dating another seventh year named Lucy Culpepper, who was just as beautiful as he was. It was making Draco nervous, the sense of being watched while thinking he definitely
There was a heavy silence before Potter spoke again. “He’ll treat you well, I expect. He’ll manage all of those things -- ” his voice broke and he cleared his throat. “All those things that I – well. He’ll be good to you, is what I mean to say.”
Draco shivered at his touch. “Never pegged you as an exhibitionist, Potter.”
Draco tried to still his hips as Potter continued to torture him, licking him and kissing him everywhere, taking his bollocks into his mouth, which was something Draco had
“No!” Harry cried, and Scorpius looked at him wide-eyed. Harry never yelled. “Sorry, no,” he said more softly. “Your dad’ll murder me.”
“The sight of one's own heart is degrading; people are not meant to look inward--that's why they've been give bodies, to hide their souls.”
“Huh,” Pansy said. If there was news, you’d think Draco would’ve told her. But he hadn’t, despite the fact that she’d seen him every single day this week. “You sure ‘news’ wasn’t code for ‘we’re shagging again’?”
don’t think you’re a bad person, anyway. And no matter
Harry nodded. He understood that, although he didn’t think it made it any easier to deal with the empty place in your life where that person had been.
“Salazar’s tit, Mandy!” Draco cried. “You’re the new Pomfrey? You ought to be sainted, I swear to Merlin. The things that poor woman put up with, from Potter alone. Think of how many bones she’s had to grow for that git!”
“I want to fuck you,” Potter whispered in his ear. “Can I fuck you? I’ll try to be better than that toy of yours.”
Draco left a tip for both of them, since Potter hadn’t bothered, and walked back out into the cold spring day, hurrying along the street. When he reached the Ministry, he slipped onto a lift. But instead of going to the floor that housed Potions Regulations, he hit the button for Floor 9. For the Department of Mysteries.
Oh, if you keep reachin' out
“Thanks,” said Harry, strangely touched. This was Ron making an effort. This was Ron saying sorry.
But here in your arms
“If what?”
“Thanks,” he said, taking it and downing half of it in one gulp.
She gave him a look. “Why do you think he's here, Draco?”
“Why not?” Harry asked, feeling the loss of him all along the front of his body. Feeling the full force of the icy wind once more.
“As they should have,” Astoria said. “We don’t believe in that, Daphne. You don’t believe in that.”
“Every other weekend, hm?” Pansy echoed.  “Well, I’m always with Scorpius on Saturdays, and I’m fine with that. Owl me when they’re here, and we can get them together.”
“Oh, I’m sure you’ll get mad enough at me at some point to use them,” Harry said, kissing his cheek. “Really, though: you’re brilliant. You deserved this.” He pulled away and looked at him. “I’m so happy for you.”
“And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don't believe in magic will never find it.”
Everyone around him seemed so slow, and he felt so very, very quick, and, as he opened himself to them, and watched their eyes, he knew what they were going to do before they did it. He could sense it and see it and he simply
“I am not
“Good,” Draco said, feeling like his question had been answered in a round-about way. He looked at her small, serious face, her dark eyes that missed nothing. “I don’t know if I’ve ever said it before, but thank you. Thank you for giving me another chance, after everything.”
Everytime I get close it's gone
Harry was alive. He was
“Yes,” Hermione said, brow furrowed. “It certainly wasn’t for lack of trying, Draco. But it’s fine. I know his schedule. You just wait for him and he’ll come in from class and you can talk. It’s a perfect time.”
“I’m saving your stupid arse!” Harry grunted, gripping onto the troll’s lumpy flesh while the troll swung its club around helplessly. Harry took another go with his wand, and this time the wand went into the nostril and the troll emitted a howl that shook the walls. The troll flailed about again, managing to whack Harry with a huge, gray hand and then with his club. It wasn’t a well-aimed strike, but it had to hurt nonetheless. Harry cried out but managed to hang on.
“Potter?” he asked, not even noticing that his drink had sloshed all over his shirt. “What the fuck? What are you doing here? How’d you get through my wards?”
sees them every other week.
,” Harry said. “It’s been so hard not to touch you. I can’t stop thinking about last night. And this morning.”
“What?” Malfoy asked, alarmed now. “What the bloody hell are you talking about?”
Hermione argued with him about it for a while, telling him that the Hallows weren’t real, while Xenophilius insisted that they were. “Prove that they're notl!” exclaimed Xenophilius.
“Can’t, mate. I'm really sorry,” said Seamus, looking off to the side and laughing.
Draco looked over all the rules, unable to keep the smile off of his face. “Things escalate rather quickly once you get past Queens, don’t they? Nothing between snogging and shagging. Just straight to it.”
Potter licked his lips nervously. “Yeah. Yes. I liked that. And I liked that you didn’t yell at me. And I liked that you, um. Let me kiss you. And touch you. And – well. You know.”
Dean leaned forward and kissed Seamus softly, no tongue, but then after a moment, something changed. You could feel it, literally, in the air, a sort of charge that swept over them. Harry watched, astounded, as Dean’s hand slid up into Seamus’s hair, and Seamus’s hand went to Dean’s arm. Dean tilted his head to the side and then all of a sudden there
“They’re just people,” said Potter. “I wondered.”
Charlie wrote every week or so, filling Draco in on the newest developments at the sanctuary, and what he and his friends were doing on the weekends. The arrival of Charlie’s owls made Draco’s chest warm, and he read the letters with pleasure. He did, in fact, miss Charlie a bit. The missing was a tolerable thing, though, and it didn’t keep him up at night.
As it got more crowded, it began to feel like a party. Harry, who was huddled with Ron against a wall, saw flashes of drugs around the room: more coke, half-heartedly hidden and snorted hastily; pills, of some sort; and weed, smoked openly and without much fanfare. People were taking shots and getting rowdy, never mind that it was past two in the morning. Seamus was flitting about, being incredibly flirty and social, and Dean was trailing him, looking worried.
“Then why did you only bring supper for four?” asked Draco, standing. “And why does it look like Luna hasn’t been in her room in weeks?”
Corner was coming from the back, heading towards him with his hands in his pockets and a sheepish expression on his face. Harry nodded and grabbed a cigarette, handing it over, lighting it with his wand. Corner leaned against the wall next to him, inhaling and frowning at the bright orange tip. “Haven’t done this in a year, probably.”
“Blaise, darling, you must relax,” Astoria said, eying him. “Would you like something to drink?”
like part of the pureblood aristocracy, though, with her neatly coifed hair and her expensive robes and her flawless posture. And the way she had spoken to Draco about her niece, well. That had been a pureblooded sort of thing to do. It would probably be a no. Draco braced himself.
“Very. If it makes you feel better, you can. Punch me in the face, I mean.”
By the end of their discussion, Draco was getting excited. “I’d like to see you without clothes. You know, to see what we’re working with here. If that’s acceptable to you.”
, which was one of his favorites. He’d already been by to look at it twice.
“You look really fucking hot,” Evan said, his eyes all over Draco’s legs and the sliver of his chest that was visible.
“I won’t,” he promised. “Thank you again. You’re an excellent teacher.”
“Well, you mustn’t! You mustn’t be mean to Pansy! She’s my friend! She is lovely. Just look at her!” Hermoine was patting Pansy’s cheek and Pansy was giggling.
Potter slipped his hands up Draco’s thighs and then around to his arse, squeezing it and then letting one hand trail down over Draco’s crease. Draco let his head fall back and moaned. Potter’s hands were wide and rough and felt incredible against his skin. But when he dropped to his knees and began to kiss along the inside of Draco’s thigh, Draco realized his hands had nothing on his mouth. Potter’s mouth was so talented it ought to be illegal.
them, you’d care about their problems. It’s like you and me. I had no idea you were having trouble sleeping before we talked the other night. Now I know, so I’ve thought about it, you know, since. Worried for you a bit. It’s just natural to care when you get to know someone.”
“What the fuck, how did you get through Mungo’s wards?” Draco asked, looking over at him incredulously.
sitting here in a dusty box? It was Malfoy’s wand, hawthorn with a unicorn hair core. Harry knew this wand, and the wand knew him. He’d used it many times. He’d taken it off Malfoy, of course, in the Manor. He’d used it to win the war. And now it was here, rotting away in the Records Department.
Harry went and poured him a whiskey on the rocks and handed it to him, then sat down on the opposite end of the couch. “What did you want to explain?”
But he still wished people would get the hell over it.
“I’m fucking Blaise!” Draco cried.
“Viggo wasn’t nearly good enough for Draco, either.”
“Fair enough. So, what do you think? You think Ernie’s dying of jealousy?”
He put an arm around her and she curled up against him, her weight against his side achingly familiar. “If I hadn’t broken up with you before,” she asked, softly, “would we still be together, do you think? Would you still love me?”
“Oh, fine, I suppose. The shop has been busy. I came out with a variant of Hangover Potion that doesn’t taste so horrible – been messing with it for years -- and it’s been flying off the shelves.”
because I can’t get past this fucking
“Only if you find her before I do,” Draco said.
Draco’s insides were churning. Blaise
Harry burst out laughing. “How the fuck do
Harry glanced at him and stilled. “
“D’you want me to stop?” Harry said near his ear.
“Phew,” she said, sitting down and sliding one of the pints his way. “Had me worried there. Who’s the lucky man or woman, then? No, wait, let me guess!”
Draco and Harry looked at each other. An art gallery sounded interesting. Draco knew little about art beyond the Impressionist Era, but he could usually appreciate it well enough. “Sure,” Harry said, answering for them both. “We’d love to.”
Harry put his mouth to Draco’s ear. “It’s been on my mind constantly. The feel of you, the feel of your mouth on mine, your mouth on my body.
He couldn’t put it off forever, though. The goblins were complete bastards if you weren’t in by eight. Draco headed out, his heart in his throat.
, Harry didn’t say. “Whoever,” he said, shrugging. “Anyone. I don’t care.”
It was cruel, this line that fate appeared to have drawn in the sand, but then, life was cruel. And Draco knew he had no right to rail against its unfairness. After all he’d done, after all the hurt he’d caused others in the past, he had no right to protest. And Harry had done so much good,
He wondered what Harry was doing, whether he was asleep or not. Was he thinking about Draco? Was he lying in bed in Grimmauld Place, recounting what had happened between them? Or was he trying to avoid thinking about it? Maybe he wanted to forget it had ever happened. Maybe he wished it never had.
, if you act like you’re moving on just fine, and if she sees that plenty of other people want a piece of you now that she’s out of the picture, she’ll rethink her decision. She’ll panic and realize that you’re going to slip through her fingers if she doesn’t get you back in a hurry. Trust me on this. People want what they can’t have, and they also want what other people want. Show her you’re wanted and that you’re not a sure thing anymore, and she’ll come running.”
He listened to the chit-chat at the table while keeping an eye on the room. That was how he accidentally caught the eye of Laurel, one of the other captains. She smiled at him and raised a hand, and soon was making her way over.
Harry would not be so easily sidetracked, though. “Not all of it,” he said, and then focused once more on Draco. “Will you see him, do you think?” He said it casually, but Draco knew that this was not a casual discussion.
“Well, then I assume she’s guided you to the conclusion that I’m awful for you.”
Aesop Rock /
“It’s not, and you know it,” Draco said, and William had the decency to look abashed.
“Well…maybe not
“Harry,” Hermione said, huffing. “I’ve been talking about this for days!”
Draco wore his emotions more obviously. He was cool with Charlie, no matter how friendly Charlie tried to be. When it was Harry’s week to be with Draco, Draco had no qualms about being physically demonstrative in front of Charlie, although Harry nipped that in the bud pretty quickly. Draco was insatiable in the bedroom, which was amazing, of course, but Harry worried that it stemmed from his insecurities rather than desire. When it was Harry’s week with Charlie, Draco grew sulky and moody, although he never actually said anything about it. Instead, he was testy about everything else, from the mud they tracked into the house to the fact that Harry left his socks on the floor. He nearly had an aneurism the time Harry accidentally forgot to take Draco’s roast out of the oven and it was slightly overdone. Harry could hardly even tell, but Draco screamed about it and threw all his food into the garbage.
Harry began thrusting his hips. Draco could tell he was trying not to, but he was half-gone, lost to his pleasure, his eyes slitted open, his mouth parted, his hands scratching trails along Draco’s scalp and shoulders. Draco encouraged him, using one hand to cup Harry’s arse, pulling it towards him before letting it sink back down onto the bed.
Dean scooted over to Seamus and licked his lips, hesitating. “Oh, just get it over with already, you git,” said Seamus.
One day he was in the throne room, seated at William’s left hand. Since Kerrick was gone from the capitol for a few days, Berold was on William’s right, in the middle of an impassioned diatribe, claiming that there was no way that all of this year’s crop had been reported, given the paltry amount they’d collected. William was arguing that the yields hadn’t been particularly strong this autumn because it had been too dry.
“I –“ he blinked rapidly and shook his head. “No, don’t – you can’t say that. You can’t – how am I supposed to be your friend if you say it?”
“Can’t say that I do,” Draco said. “Looks nice on you, though.”
“Charlie?”
Harry didn’t go to Malfoy’s flat after work. He’d been thinking about their trip to Grimmauld Place, about the birds, about the horror written so clearly across Malfoy’s face as he gazed out the kitchen window. He’d been afraid of Harry, then. Not that Harry blamed him. Harry couldn’t trust himself – how was Malfoy supposed to trust him? He was a powder-keg, one that could explode at any moment, annihilating anyone who was standing too close.
Draco chewed at his lip, thinking. There were things he wanted to fix. Things he wanted to stop from happening. There were a million reasons. But, when push came to shove…
“Whasit?” Harry mumbled.
, do you? You just assume everything will be fine because you’re Harry Sodding Potter, the Boy Who Lived, and so of
“Well…” said Tony. “You need to be keeping up on media, first of all. Hannah’s been giving you a press roundup every day.”
“Weasley and Granger have been there, haven’t they?”
“You take it too far, Potter,” Draco said. “That poor tea.”
Potter grinned. “It’s a lotion. It’s edible; it tastes awesome. Crème brulee –  want to try?” He offered his wrist.
Merlin, Potter was going to kill him with this inability to form complete sentences. “A man?”
“Oh,” Draco said, feeling his mouth go a bit dry when Potter’s leg stayed in contact with his. “Well. An hour?”
He tried to grab for his wand but then realized his hands were tied up behind his back. Tied to the floor behind his arse.
“I wouldn’t get hit on so much if you were there, love,” said Ron, patting Hermione’s hand. “Harry had to chase all the boys away from me. I’m far too tempting.”
He felt even better that night as he got ready for bed and his phone, which had sat dormant for most of the last year, buzzed.
“I care about you, too. You’re my best friend in the entire world.”
Draco couldn’t help it; he burst out laughing.
“Jesus Christ, we did, didn’t we? Oh my god.”
. Seriously. Calm the hell down. You have the exact same dirt on me, for fuck’s sake. I’m not going to say anything.”
, Harry!” Draco hissed as he pulled on his own pants. “Don’t you want to
The only one I know, the only one on my mind
“Okay,” Draco said, thinking. He chewed his lip. “What happened between you and Edwin?”
. Got into fights all the time – with words and wands and sometimes fists.  I broke his nose, once. Stomped on it. And I tried to Crucio him in the bathroom, and he sliced me open with some strange spell -”
“Figure that out. I will say, though, Potter -- you’re good for him. He’s seemed happier since he took up with you. He wasn’t doing so well, before. He was in a bad place last semester. It’s been good to see him so much more himself lately; I would hate for that to end. But if you can’t give him that anymore, if you can’t be his friend, then you can’t. I get that.” She looked a little shiny-eyed at that, like she was about to cry, which seemed akin to the sky falling.
“Oh my god,” he gasped, through tears and giggles. He knelt down in front of Harry and yanked him close, holding onto him for dear life. “Yes. Yes, yes, yes.” He started kissing him all over his face, and Harry was crying too, tears streaming over his face, and they were a fucking mess, and it was the most incredible moment of his entire life.
“Sure,” Harry said, clearing his throat. “I probably do, too.”
Berold helped William to his feet then, and steadied him. “So, we’re calling the men and then what?” William asked.
“No no,” she said, interrupting. “I’m not. Or not that I know of, anyway,” she said. She grinned at him. “It was your research, from before. When we were investigating the portals. You’d found mention of a spell that could pierce the veil between worlds.”
Pansy came that evening, and Harry went down to the canteen so she could chat with Sarah.
“Ugh, you git,” he replied. Suddenly he didn’t want to leave. Why had he said he had plans? He wanted to stay. “You know…I could probably stay for a little while. I have a bit of time.”
But Draco usually ended up looking. Only for a little while; he didn’t let it get out of hand. He’d give himself one minute, or maybe two, and then he’d force himself to look away.
, you ought to try Lagavulin sometime. The flavor is much more complex.” Draco let his voice drip with the slightest hint of distain, just because it felt good.
Not much you could say to that.
Potter groaned and ground his prick against Draco’s and then began sliding Draco’s shirt over his head. “This needs to come off,” he said by way of explanation. Draco had, of course, glamoured his chest so that the Sectumsempra scars weren’t visible. He pulled at Potter’s t-shirt, too, and stared, entranced, at what was underneath. Potter wasn’t bulky with muscles, but he certainly had them, lean and honed to perfection. He had a small patch of dark chest hair and a little line of hair running down from his belly button into his pants. His skin was gorgeous and scarred, and he had a tattoo above his heart, in vibrant, shimmering color. There was a scarab beetle there, in gold and brown and phosphorescent green, and below that was a golden Sator Square, with its ancient palindrome grid. “Why these?” Draco asked.
“You’re cute, too, though,” Sarah said. “Especially when you’re grouchy.”
“We left it up there,” said Greg.
“Just for a little while,” said Harry. He hated having to talk Draco into these things. He didn’t like that he constantly had to convince the man he loved to ignore his conscience. But the alternative was
“Um, no?” Harry said. He hadn’t asked, he realized. Usually he asked all about Charlie’s latest dragon adventures, but this time he’d been too wrapped up in everything – in things with Ron, and then everything at the party, and then…well. He felt like quite an arsehole.
Pansy flipped off the back of his head before turning to Draco. “Congrats, my love,” she said, pulling him into a hug. His evening had been so full of interviews and glad-handing that he hadn’t even spoken to her until now.
“Weirdo,” Harry said, trying not to cry again. Harry slipped Draco’s shirt over his head and stared at his scars, crisscrossing over his chest, just a shade paler than the rest of him. He looked at his long white throat and his pink nipples and the spot where his hip bones stuck up above his pants. “I missed this,” he said, kissing along the scars. “And this,” he said, kissing up Draco’s throat. “And this, I missed this,” he said, licking over Draco’s nipple and grinning. “Basically, all of it.”
“Obsessive?”
“Harry, you can’t just –” began Hermione, but Potter was already pushing past Draco and striding through the door.
?” asked Draco.
“No!”
“No. It’s not a bad thing. It’s a good thing. A
"I thought you were up to something," Potter mumbled.
And then too soon, Harry was pushing him away.
He slowly ran his fingers along the underside of his shaft and felt himself get harder. He realized that, between all the drama and time-travel, he hadn’t had a proper wank in ages. Maybe a quick one-off here or there in the shower, but they’d been done efficiently and without much fanfare.
wanted them to be married. Who would want that to happen?”
, Hermione.” He felt close to tears. He desperately wanted to save her, somehow, only he didn’t know how.
“I know,” Draco said, shooting him another look.
“Do you now,” said Draco, his accent posh as ever. Draco’s hand came to Harry’s waist and Harry leaned towards him. Harry felt very hot all over, despite the breeze that was gentling its way across the rooftop. They were hidden, surrounded by other dancers who were paying them no attention at all, so that it felt private, despite being anything but. Harry’s heart knocked against his ribcage as Draco’s face came closer, almost touching Harry’s.
fetching, and that much fun to guide around the dancefloor. After Ginny was finished with him, he danced with Luna again, and then, much to his surprise, Hermione asked him. She was technically proficient on the floor (though she was no Ginny), but more than that, he was just thrilled that she’d asked him, and even happier when they made easy small talk the entire time and nothing felt forced.
a choice – that it was between staying here or being with you. I thought…Harry, I thought you weren’t an option either way.”
“Well, Draco, Harry. It was nice to meet you. Try not to get nicked off the roads, alright?” Frankie gave Draco a wink, and turned towards the door, long dark braid swinging behind her. The three disappeared into the darkening world beyond the tavern.
?” Draco asked, disbelieving.
The second time, Harry must’ve followed him into the Slytherin Common Room under the Invisibility Cloak, because when Draco finished brushing his teeth, he pulled back the curtains of his bed to reveal Harry, sprawled out on his back, hands behind his head, grinning. Draco pulled the curtain shut immediately, because Blaise was just across the room, reading. When he opened it again, Harry had disappeared. He climbed in, and accidently kneed invisible-Harry in the balls.  “Ouch!” Harry cried.
“I’m coming down a bit, and besides, I’m good at healing things.”
“Are you all right?” Harry asked, his eyes on Draco’s face.
It won't keep us apart
it was going to be in the bedroom, you kinky bastard,” Harry laughed, letting himself be pulled. “At this rate, it’s not going to feel like my birthday if you don’t debauch yourself in some way for me.”
And slowly, slowly, he became angry. It was a helpless sort of anger, with nowhere to go. He showered and dressed and paced more. He went for a walk outside and the day promised to bring heat and humidity, and the sky was a poisonous, sick sort of gray.
But whatever the reason, Draco had also, somehow, become a ‘serial wanker’, as Blaise so eloquently put it. And yes, he was embarrassed by this, and no, no one else knew, not even the house elves. Draco was a fanatic about silencing spells and cleaning spells. The whole thing was a bit mortifying, honestly, but it had been manageable at home.
“Yeah,” said Harry, and felt suddenly lighter. “Yeah, that sounds like a plan.”
Ron and Hermione were dancing nearby. “I guess that worked out for Harry, then,” said Hermione.
Potter stared at him for a moment, then scowled. “Excuse me for caring, arsehole,” he said. “What did William want?”
“And what would you have me do?” he asked, raising his voice. It was one of the only times Draco had ever heard him upset. “Edwin is my –”
And maybe she would’ve believed him if she hadn’t known him so well. But there was more to it than he was saying, she knew that.
It went quiet. Slowly, Harry peeked out from the kitchen, and saw that the green light was fading. Thank god. “Sorry, ‘Mione,” he mumbled, hurrying past the floo just in case, and slipping out the door.
“Ouch!” he cried, rubbing a hand over it. “Oh. Well, that feels better.”
“Wonderful; now that’s out of the way. So, Robbie, whatever it is you want to say, I don’t have time for it right now,” Potter said. “You can’t just show up unannounced, incidentally.”
“You’re seriously going to kiss other blokes?” Ron was asking her, looking reddish.
If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
“Indeed.” Draco had an idea, a bad one. He opened his mouth anyway to share it. “Maybe we should try to get together once a week, just you and I. Muggle pub or something. Talk over the campaign in a more relaxed way, without the rest of the team yapping at us. It would be a good way to debrief each other, and to voice any concerns that might arise that we don’t feel comfortable sharing with everybody else.”
He had no idea what to say to her. He didn’t want to say anything. “I’m tired,” he said. “And I’d like to sleep alone.”
“I’ve been trying to get Harry to go and get a bite to eat, but he’s being stubborn,” said Pansy, elbowing Harry.
“You think psychiatric drugs are a better solution, is that it?” He sounded tired and annoyed, both.
“Deal,” she said, offering him her hand. They shook.
“You’re not,” Alex said. “Trust me.”
“You taste like that fancy coffee you used to always drink,” replied Harry, making Draco laugh.
Just then there was a ruckus coming from the fireplace, and Weasley tumbled out, followed by Longbottom. A moment later, Harry stepped into the room unsteadily, bellowing about ordering pizza. He froze when he saw Draco, his eyes flickering between Ginny, who had her feet propped up on Draco’s lap, and Draco, who still had his hands over Hermione’s ears, and Hermione, who was giggling uncontrollably.
“Oh, well then why –”
,” Potter begged.
“Hot,” said Harry. “I can see why that turns you on. It’s really hot.”
“You’re telling me nothing happened between you? Because that would be really fucked up. If it did the very night that –”
It was incredible, dancing to pounding EDM and shaking his arse to Latin beats with all his friends the next three nights. His heart soared as he watched Ron try (unsuccessfully, mostly) to salsa with Hermione. He felt full of goodwill and joy as he watched Neville move in on a pretty muggle girl, as he spied Ernie and Daphne snogging on the dancefloor, and as Pansy danced all over Harry, making him laugh and also get a little bit hard, at club called Hammer.
“You shouldn’t have to
Draco shrugged. “Missed too many years. Got too old. S’okay. I have the chance to do it now, don’t I?”
“Mm,” said Harry in agreement.
“I’d never hate you. I love you.”
“Did Old Rose just toss that priceless necklace into the ever-loving
For a slightly different take on the ending to Harry's story, please read
“She didn’t want to explain the recklessness, the pleasure of making the bad choice, the glory of at least this once, picking her own path to damnation.”
Break it open
“Well, yes,” Kerrick said. “I’d much prefer it if you and Hermione and I were able to close it on our own.”
“Because I’m going to snog you.”
He was also feeling a niggling guilt somewhere in his gut, buried deep as he was able to bury it. Ginny hadn’t been thrilled about his weekend plans. Not at all, not even when he explained, very patiently, that he was going so that he and Draco could find some travel guides, and also so that they could work on some SASS things. It seemed very reasonable, to Harry’s mind, but Ginny had looked at him like she just
Unfortunately, none of them knew where guards might be posted. Berold said the tunnels were largely unguarded, given that they could only be accessed by the sea tunnel and other places within the palace grounds, but the portion near the dungeons was under constant surveillance. He added, though, that while this had been the case while he’d been in Septerra, it was possible that the False Queen might have changed things. That caveat served only to make everyone even more nervous regarding the plan.
Draco nudged the door open. “Hey,” he said.
only know because my mother told your mother. Did you know I met him?”
He wondered how they had gotten to the place they were in now, how they had managed it. Bit by bit, he supposed. The way most things were accomplished. One vote at a time, one moment at a time, one kind word at a time.
“How could you?” he hissed at her. “You betrayed me.”
“We’ll see, I guess. But if it isn’t, then…thanks. I had fun getting my arse beaten.”
Draco saw Potter staring at them from across the field. Draco didn’t know what to do. He felt unable to do anything.
, and we’re all having so much fun. I can feel you wanting to have fun, darling.” He put his hand on her breastbone. “Right here. It’s saying please, let me have more fun. Please, Pansy.”
“Draco,” Harry said.
Spring came, and they decided they ought to leave the house. So they started venturing out, like bears after a long hibernation, squinting into the sun. The press had a field day when they realized, and every day, there were new headlines about The Boy Who Lived’s scandalous new relationship. Draco began collecting every article that had the words “former Death Eater, Draco Malfoy,” in it and ritualistically setting them on fire in the evenings.
The wedding was to take place at Lughnasadh, the day of the harvest celebration. They were doing it the old way, which was totally unlike any wedding Harry’d ever seen. Everyone in attendance (which was family and close friends only) had to wear white Druidic-style robes with a wreath of green leaves in their hair, except for Harry and Draco, who wore wildflowers instead. Draco picked the flowers and wove the crowns – they had to be certain types and in a certain order, and Harry didn’t understand any of it – and cast stasis charms on them. The ceremony was at dusk on the shore of the the sparkling lake beside the castle.
is a bit of a dumbass. You're more than worthy of my affections, whether we stay here or go home."
“Wow. Presumptuous much?”
Evan had it out in record time. And…
“Or not,” Malfoy said, stepping back, face shuttered. “It’s fine, either way, obviously.”
He poured himself a glass of the wine that was out on the table – a nice bottle of Sancerre, kept chilled under stasis (he was definitely buying Pansy something expensive for doing all this) – and went to stand near the windows. He almost wished he smoked, because it felt like a thing one might do while waiting in a luxury hotel room for one’s lover. But an open, satin robe and a casual lean against the window and a glass of wine and perhaps an insolently raised eyebrow would do the trick.
“It was your good friend Vernon Dudley. You know, the Slytherin? Only, what’s funny is that he suddenly looks a whole fucking lot like Harry Potter. Isn’t that strange?”
“Right, but mine does. Make a cup with your hands.”
Hermione pointed, and Draco slipped in, bracing himself for the Weasel’s wrath.
“You’re sure it’s not some sort of time-travel then?”
“Maybe,” said Draco, giving her a little smile.
“No, that’s not – Ginny and I broke up. Yesterday.”
. He straightened up, walking tall, glad he’d worn a new, flattering suit today. “Hello,” he said, standing in the bedroom door.
“It was just…” he shrugged, stopped and pulled his arm away to run a hand along the back of his neck. He looked at her, his eyes shining in the moonlight. “Brilliant. It was brilliant, Pans, it was so wonderful, and I –”
Harry didn’t open his eyes, and Draco didn’t get a chance to ask. “Don’t stop,” Harry murmured. “Please.”
He ought to have talked to Potter first, then proposed. Although if he had talked to Potter first, he never would have proposed at all.
“What did he seem like?” Harry asked, almost afraid to hear the answer.
Soon, Charlie was kissing down his chest and pulling off his pants, and yes, yes, he wanted this. Charlie looked up at him, a question, and all Harry had to do was give a little grin and move his hips and then Charlie’s mouth was on his cock and it was hot and wet and Charlie was way too good at this, holy shit.
“I came here to talk to you.”
He bit the inside of his cheek, pushing back the prickling heat that threatened to overflow from behind his eyes, staring down at his own hands, afraid of what would happen if he looked at Harry.
“Oh, my favorite place,” said Draco. He pulled his hand away from Harry and sat petting Stormy for a few moments, thinking. Then he looked at Harry, his eyes bright in the moonlight. “Yes, alright.”
"Yes," she says without turning around, her voice thick. "I'll write you, too."
“Where’d you get it?” he asked, raising an eyebrow. Whenever he and Pansy did anything besides smoke, they usually got it from Blaise, and Draco happened to know that Blaise and Pansy had been in a fight since New Year’s.
The younger set of Aurors were mostly gone, down in the Ministry cafeteria, probably. Draco wondered why Potter hadn’t joined them. Finnigan and Weasley were nowhere in sight, so Draco left the file folder of lab reports for a black-market love potions case on Finnigan’s desk. He glanced over at Potter again, then made his way over, noting how Potter looked like he was a million miles away. “Potter,” he said, coming to a halt in front of a very cluttered desk, covered in papers and half-empty mugs of tea and biscuit crumbs.
Harry was still looking at Draco. “You’re sure?”
James nodded. “Kay.” He yawned again, and Harry kissed him once more.
they were, honestly).  Potter had found beef and vegetables in the refrigerator and potatoes in the cupboard and was making a shepherd’s pie. Not Draco’s favorite, really, but he wasn’t going to point that out since Potter was bloody cooking for him.
“Hello?” came a voice. “Sarah?”
“Yes, and where’s that hot husband of yours?” Pansy asked rather snidely. “Which of his whores is he running around with this weekend?”
“See? I didn’t really know
Harry raised an eyebrow at Draco. “Because of the muggle?”
“My tongue feels sticky,” Pansy said, pointing it at them. “Feel it.”
“How can you not know how? I’ve shown you a dozen times,” said Harry.
They heard a chuff and saw a glint of red, and then nothing.
“Sorry,” Potter said again, still not looking at him. “I’m just – it’s nothing. I just needed to talk to Ron. But he’s, ah, asleep.”
“See, this is what I mean. You don’t always have to go for the jugular, you know,” his mother said with a sigh.
Another chuckle. “You’re almost too easy. You’re lucky I like that.” The hand fell away.
Incidentally, all the Rebels believed that William ought to be king, and that was why they were fighting. Partly, anyway. The other reason was the whole bit about enslaving Ethereans, which had been the current Queen’s doing. Otrea had allegedly made an attempt on William’s life while he was still in nappies, but he’d been secreted away from the capitol and hidden in the mountains with his mother’s people. When he came of age, he assumed leadership over the men already fighting in his name. He’s been leading the Rebellion for four years now. He was only twenty.
It had totally sucked to be dirty all the time. Draco was normally a fastidious person, and it had been a constant thorn in his side to feel grimy. To be clean and dry and warm seemed like an obscene luxury, and he couldn’t help but enjoy it.
“Am not,” said Harry, giving him a small smile.
Draco sighed. “It meant something to me, too. And…and I’m sorry.”
The room was elegant and refined, with a huge, pristine bed and an enormous spa-like shower that might be fun later. But for now…
It wasn’t a new transgression, obviously. He’d been fucking around with Blaise for months and he’d known perfectly well that Blaise was with Padma. But this was different, somehow. He’d literally taken Blaise away from her, after spending an evening with the two of them, and that seemed extremely messed up.
“Right, of course. So who is it? Is it Pansy still?”
“Does that mean you like it?”
Draco leaned over him, holding him, kissing his cheek and his shoulder, and they moved together, lost in each other. Draco pulled his arse up higher and suddenly he was hitting that delicious place deep inside that made Harry cry out and clutch the sheets in his fist. Draco straightened a little and ran his hand up and down Harry’s spine, and Harry was moaning in pleasure, rutting against the bed, feeling Draco all through him and along him and everywhere.
for me. It sounds like he still fucking
to get back together, Ernie. Because I need a reason to trust you.”
“Rodderem is in the mountains?” Draco asked.
A few minutes later he declared that he was finished, and Harry turned and stared. He had managed to change into a pair of satiny red trousers and a black leather vest, slim cut, with nothing underneath. And he had that choker on again along with two thick black wrist cuffs. Not to mention the eyeliner. “
“Er, no, I don’t think so,” Seamus said, frowning.
“So hot!” cried Seamus. “What the hell!”
Harry snorted. “No, I think not. I swear that’s why she plays Quidditch. So she can travel all over the place and avoid relationships and shag boys and girls in every corner of the U.K.”
This was all happening at the center stage, and Harry, unable to help himself, walked towards it almost in a trance. Malfoy was wearing a black and white tuxedo: black pants, white jacket with black lapels and a white shirt and black bow-tie. The R&B had come to a halt and the most strip-club-incongruent song of all time was playing - ‘Singing in the Rain’ – and Malfoy was floating across the stage to it, like some dandy from a from a black and white film, doing little twirls and shuffling moves and kicking his little cane off of his feet so that it flipped around. It was like Fred Astaire had just showed up at a strip club, for fun.
Draco wanted to apologize, to reassure him that nothing had happened with William, but the words died in his throat. His body felt wrecked, absolutely wrecked, raw and sore.
Harry immediately knew which one Sarah had called cute, and she’d said it because she knew Harry’s type. The other one, who wasn’t unattractive in any way and actually had a very nice smile, held out his hand. “Yeah, first time. We both cycle, but, like, outside. I’m Bryce and this is Will.”
Draco stepped forward and Hermione gave Harry a little shove. “Go greet him,” she said.
Draco rolled his eyes, unable to hide a little grin. “Ridiculous,” he muttered, heading out for the shower.
“And you’d be expected to conduct yourself according to my guidelines. No kissing my boyfriend, for one. And your job would be to suck him off.”
, you idiot.
So he’d slipped on Harry’s trackies, and then he’d gone back to the bed and knelt beside it, watching Harry for a moment. He was beautiful in sleep, his face slack and soft and sweet. He looked young, almost like the boy Draco’d known at Hogwarts, with his shy smiles (never for Draco, back then, of course, but Draco’d managed to catch a glimpse of them sometimes), his too-big clothes, his awkward stammering (when he wasn’t vanquishing Dark Lords and being terrifyingly competent and inhumanly powerful, Harry used to be a bit of a mess).
Ernie laughed. “Sure, of course.” He got up and opened his closet, rifling through. He came out with a soft-looking, emerald green jumper. It wasn’t big and shlubby like all of Harry’s jumpers. “How’s this? You’d look good in this.”
Draco kissed his hair again. “Harry…” he said.
“Because you and I are together quite often, and because of Harry. And now, because of Charlie. I think she’d like to see what all the fuss is about.”
Ginny was looking at him. “I heard all about your adventures, you know. That you fooled around with Parkinson. That you decided you’re bisexual.”
“Only the slimy bits.” She craned her neck. “Scorpius! Don’t touch that toad! You’ll get warts!”
Ron shrugged, his thumb still moving. Harry was getting hard now, despite his advanced levels of intoxication, and his mind was scrambling, but it felt like it was moving underwater. Thoughts came with difficulty, and much too slowly.
“Hullo!” he cried, wrapping Lily up in a hug and lifting her off the ground and making her squeal. When he set her back down, Al ducked underneath Harry’s arm to get in on the hug, and Harry kissed his cheek.
“Harry,” he began, having no real notion of what to say. What do you say to a boy who’s never had parents? Who stumbled upon a ghostly image of them, conjured up out of his own need, and tried to pretend it was real?
“Piglet sidled up to Pooh from behind.
wizard anymore? So. You know. I don’t usually talk about all that.”
“Not at first! Not until recently! I thought. Well, the poor thing was always wandering around. I assumed she was feral. I took her to the vet and the groomer and I just…I liked her. She’s a nice cat.”
Draco nodded, feeling a phantom ache at the mention of Harry’s name, and another ache at the memory of being that person for Hermione. “Yes,” he said.
“And she gave me a whole speech about being happy with the people I love rather than always looking to the next world, and it totally made sense, it
“Harry can’t stop talking about how you were there. It sounds as though you two became good friends.” Her eyes were on his, searching. She was too astute, by half.
“Obviously. This was different. I felt like maybe I was communicating with it, a bit. It had a very powerful presence. And it was physically more powerful, too. Bigger.”
Nott stared at him, and without another word, stomped away.
Draco shrugged. “I don’t know. Not really, but maybe I should.”
“Well, if he didn’t stir it, then I would, darling,” Pansy said sweetly.
When he woke, Potter was already up, his bed empty, his blanket spread out neatly over the straw mattress. Draco did not want to get up – he still felt like hell – but it would be suspicious if he didn’t. He rose and re-tied his hair and sheathed the broadsword he kept by his bed. And then he headed to the dining hall, feeling exhausted but also strung-out on anxiety.
“He’s talked about me?”
One side of Granger’s mouth went up.
Charlie laughed but sobered up quickly. “Why? Why would you want to stay here?”
“You could get in here with me,” said Draco, his voice soft and uncertain. He didn’t know exactly what he’d stumbled into, but whatever it was, he planned to go with it.
Everyone besides Ginny and Draco left after lunch. It was torture, being in the quiet house and not knowing what was happening. They knew, at least, that the truly dangerous part would begin after sunset. Still, the minutes dragged.
Draco gets cozy in the new timeline before everything falls apart
“I know.”
He almost flipped the table when he saw Ginevra’s hand reach out to cover Harry’s. Instead, he drank down to the dregs of his lager and went up to the bar for another one and snuck glances at Potter and Ginevra from this new angle. He stomped back to the table, trying to decide who he hated most: himself or the Weasley strumpet. It was a toss-up.
She smiled. “It’s something he made for us. A scrapbook of all his shitty ideas.” Her breath caught, and she made a noise somewhere between a sob and a laugh.
“Absolutely not. He’s an idiot. And since he’s in and it’ll be a split vote regardless, Robards may very well get in, too.”
And then suddenly, his clothes were gone, because Harry’d vanished them again, because of course he did, the powerful wanker. Because he knew what that did to Draco.

“I did tell you.”
Then he was looking back at Harry, smiling almost ruefully. “Well, here we go again, Potter,” he said, and Harry saw him swallow.
“About…about
When Harry woke up, he felt uneasy. At first he didn’t even know why; he only knew that there was a tight knot in his chest. He looked around the room. Not much was out of place, except that his blue blazer and a few other articles of clothing were strewn around the room.
“I won’t regret anything,” Harry whispered, kissing Draco’s palm again, and nuzzling it. At that moment, he was utterly convinced of it.
Potter, stubborn arse that he was, kept coming, and then he grabbed at Draco and hauled him forward, up onto the beach, and Draco was tumbling and crashing into Potter, who was shivering and trembling all over, but then, come to think of it, so was Draco, but really that didn’t matter, because they had to move, had to get away.
And it was
Pansy and Draco resumed their wild nights out, although Draco was no longer having illicit sex in loos or in alleys or in hastily-booked hotel rooms. A few kisses here and there, but that was all.
“I may have been rude back,” Draco admitted.
“No,” Draco said.
“For how long? Just for today? Or today and tomorrow? Or longer than that?”
“Oh, hell!” cried Draco. “Why did we not bet on this? That would’ve been so fun!”
nice, Harry.”
“What might work?” asked Potter.
“A Sacred Door?” He raised a thick eyebrow. “Who created the Door that brought you here if not you?”
Harry nearly stomped his foot and said to hell with you, but he did want to hear what Malfoy had to say, so he followed him to the room where he and Pansy always had tea.
“Truth,” said Millie, flicking her long hair over her shoulder.
“Why would it make her jealous? She broke up with me. She doesn’t want me anymore.”
Berold inclined his head towards the tunnel offshoot, and they started down it. It was skinnier than the tunnels they’d been down so far, but endlessly long, and seemed to be moving further into the earth. Soon, there were puddles in places on the ground, and it was freezing cold. “How far down does this go?” Draco asked, shivering.
Draco watched Harry hurry into his bedroom, feeling a rush of something sweep over him. He felt powerful, just then. He was still able to render Harry speechless, despite Harry’s mad and indulgent lifestyle, his world-weariness. There was still something about Draco that held sway over him. The thought was intoxicating.
“But I’m an awful friend,” Blaise said, looking anguished. “I’m an awful person. Even back in fifth year, look what sorts of things I did. I was a terrible coward during the war, and then I’ve spent this year using and hurting the people I care about most…” He trailed off.
“I’m not
They stopped and looked at each other again. “What were you going to say?” Draco asked.
“Yeah,” Draco breathed.
Pansy returned with coffee and Draco took a long, fortifying sip of his, and then a took deep breath and set out all the information he’d uncovered so far. Pansy, who hardly ever took anything seriously, surprised Harry by pulling out a notebook and scribbling down multiple pages of notes. When she finished, Draco took it and looked it over, Harry peering over his shoulder.
Draco folded his blue cloak carefully. The unicorn was very still, regarding him with one heavily-lashed eye, and then it ducked its head in submission. He spread the folded cloak out over the unicorn’s back, to protect the creature’s hide from the rough parts of the saddle, if there were any, and then he picked up the saddle. It seemed to ring, almost, in his hands. A silent bell, a joyful peal, because it was meant to do this very thing. He set it atop the unicorn, buckling the straps and adjusting them. He wondered how old the saddle was, and whether Ilana, when she was Thea, had made it herself, or whether it was older than even she.
“Yeah?”
“You fucker,” Seamus growled. “Come here and say that to my face.”
was he doing this? How was this supposed to get Draco elected? He was going to kick Tony in the balls when he got back to the campaign office, he really was.
Oh fuck. He’d forgotten that they talked.
Mallory, who had short, spiky brown hair and the uncanny likeness of a hedgehog, came running over, a vial in his hand. “Here,” he said, breathlessly, handing it to Stephens.
He was scanning the room for Draco, though, over and over, but it was so crowded that he couldn’t find him. He’d forget, then, for a while, and return to the more immediate things surrounding him – the music, the shots, the girls with way too much skin showing and the boys who’d ripped off their shirts altogether. Then he’d remember again, and look. Each time, he found himself getting a little more anxious. Where was Draco?
“Oh, right, I’m sorry. Mustn’t sully her precious name on my Death Eater lips,” Draco said archly.
Harry reached out and pulled his wand slowly from the troll’s nostril, and they all watched in horror as a long string of troll bogeys came with it. “Ew,” Harry said.
Draco kissed him on the forehead. “You just talked about your feelings,” he said.
Harry complied, helping him scoot them down and then kicking them off. Draco’s pants were still somewhere in the vicinity of his knees, so he kicked them off too, and then they both seemed to realize all at once that everything was gone, and there was nothing left between them, nothing at all. Draco returned his mouth to Harry’s and traced the lines of his body, wanting to know them, to learn them. He let his hands linger along the muscles of Harry’s back, the delicious dip above his arse, and then the sweet curve below. He felt the smooth muscles of his thighs and the jut of his hips. Then he moved his hands back up to Harry’s face, letting his fingertips linger over jaw and throat, the soft curve of an ear, the line of his brow.
He was beautiful.
“You’re dangerous, you. I’m officially afraid of you,” Draco teased.
“Daph, cut the bullshit. We need to know where he is. You need to tell me right now.”
“As for the rest, just a moment,” she turned, her silky hair trailing behind her. She was a beautiful girl, possibly even more than Frankie, and Draco felt a sudden stab of jealousy. Potter and Lia were close, the way that Draco and Frankie were close. They spent a decent amount of time together and seemed to enjoy one another’s company.
Ernie laughed. “How about you, ‘Moine?”
“Oh, fine,” said Hermione, sighing, and everyone scattered to change into normal clothes, and they met back up at the pub down the street from Harry’s place.
What if he really had killed Edwin? What would that mean?
Astoria met his eyes. “Blaise says she’s having an affair.”
“Um. Hello,” said Malfoy. He was wearing baggy sweatpants and a Chelsea Football Club t-shirt. “Would you mind cleaning this mess up, please? Since you’re the one who scared the shit out of me and made me drop my plate.”
Potter looked wary.
Draco pretended to be surprised. “Oh,” he said. “Well, what do you think?”
!” he cried, giggling uncontrollably. He managed to pinch her arm and she yelped and tickled him more brutally, and he began shoving at her with his feet.
Draco looked at him sharply. “Am I that obvious?”
Draco worried his lip, looking up at the sky. He considered putting his trousers on, but whenever the beach was free, he planned to go back down and give himself a tug and give his prick a quick rinse when he was done, so really, what was the point? He crossed his arms over himself and looked around the boulder, craning his neck to glimpse the beach below.
“Yeah, ‘course,” said Harry.
“No, fuck
knew. He apologized.”
“Oh, but you should have some,” said Harry. “I made it.” He shot Draco a smile and Draco frowned at it, because it seemed like a strange smile. Trembly.
used to be, he thought.
Harry told him about the night he heard about Malfoy and Euri’s date, and how he’d stomped over to Malfoy Manor and how they’d fought.
Finally, afterward, it was close to three in the morning. And somehow, thanks to the fantastic wank, perhaps, he fell asleep.
This time though, he was an old pro, walking through the wall easily to meet his parents. Together, they made their way along the crowded platform, surrounded by the flutter and screech of owls, the clunk of carts, the roar of voices. “This one’s open,” Draco said, halting next to one of the cars. His parents drew closer, his father’s eyes appraising, his mother’s warm.
But I got lost a time or two
“He cares about you, too, you boar’s ass,” she said gently. “He never left your side while you were sleeping, you know.”
Draco blinked. “Well, shit, Potter. Don’t mince words or anything.”
Draco tried not to let the fear show on his face, but he wasn’t very successful.
They made love again in Draco’s bed, and Draco groaned into Charlie’s mouth as he came. As he fell asleep, he thought of Harry.
“No, she’s working late. What else is new, right?”
to see that Harry was alive. She had seemed sorry, for him, that he’d had to endure the attempt on his life.
with Connell; he hadn’t even kissed him. If he had, who knew whether it would have lived up to his imagination. Maybe it wouldn’t have even come close.
He stood motionless, blinking at her.
“Uh, okay? Yes? That could work?”
But sex would’ve also been an invasion. It might’ve exposed Harry’s feelings, but it would have laid Draco bare as well, and he would have been unable to hide what he himself felt. And right now, he needed to hide some things. He needed to keep some part of himself safe and locked away.
“What?” Malfoy called back, rather imperiously, snot that he was.
First period and second period were over, and they were working their way through third, though the conversation was far from finished. Hermione was sprawled out on her back, sort of glaring at the sky. “I’m engaged to
This heart's broken
“I’d rather be
Draco was too happy to tell her that saying ‘I told you so’ was obnoxious. Instead, he kissed her cheek, and then kissed Harry’s for good measure.
She looked at his palm, red and sore from holding the sword. Callouses had already formed, and he knew they would be full and painful tomorrow until they broke open.
Of course. Draco knew this already, and he felt ridiculous for asking. “Oh, right,” he said.
None of them were sleeping well, which wasn’t helping with the whole ‘going mad because of an evil locket’ thing. “Sorry,” said Draco. “You want to take my turn? I can cover your spot later tonight if you’d like. Maybe you’ll be able to sleep by then.”
That meant Pansy was home, and Draco could visit. She seemed to be expecting a hex or at least a verbal throttling when Draco stepped through the floo into her flat; she cringed and gave him an awkward wave.
“You’re not,” William said. “You hated him. Not that I blame you. He was horrible, wasn’t he? In the end.”
Harry worked him open quickly, and Draco felt little resistance in his body. They must’ve been doing this a lot, for his hole to be so obliging. All the while Harry’s mouth was hot on his, devouring, and Harry was moaning as he pushed into Draco with his fingers.  Harry’s other hand reached down and wrapped around his cock and began to stroke up and down the shaft slowly, and Draco threw his head back and cried out. “You’re already fucking ready, just like that,” Harry whispered. “You’re ready for me.
“Yeah, sod off, Harry,” called Seamus.
“This is how it starts,” he continued. “And it doesn’t end until someone quashes it or they achieve what they want, which is basically the end of muggle civilization. You get that, right? You understand that when all is said and done, these people want to use magic to rule over muggles, to bring them to heel.”
“Well, it’s always acceptable to start with that,” Draco said. “May I?”
Potter shook his head. “No. I’ll be fine. Just…see if they’re okay.”
She laughed. “Right. So.” She looked around, then handed him two of the weights. “Try these, they’re only ten pounds, but you can do a high number of repetitions.” She considered him. “Maybe not so high, I dunno.” She picked up another set of weights, and hers said five.
He pulled her into a hug and kissed the top of her head. “I love you, Gin. I hope you know that.”
“Because our cause is just?” Berold asked, looking curious.
“But wherever it goes, it’s not a pleasant place.
“Is that your goal here?” she asked, genuinely curious.
Draco nodded. “That was how we dealt with being targeted.”
Ron,” said Hermione. “This is
Harry, shaking his head and still laughing, did it.
He knew he might not be able to stop Potter from doing it again, and that his flesh might be cut into ribbons this very evening. It had hurt, that first time. It had hurt incredibly, and it had been so frightening, seeing all that blood pour out of his own body. He remembered thinking, as he watched the bathroom floor turn pink as his blood mixed with water from the burst pipes, that there was no way he could be bleeding that much and live.
That was in February. From February until June, Cassius got into the habit of finding Draco alone and pushing him into a toilet or a quiet hallway or his own room, when it was empty. They rarely spoke, and they didn’t ever kiss. Draco tried once, and Cassius pushed him away. “I’m not a fucking pouf,” he remembered Cassius saying in his low, precise voice. They did, however, graduate from hand jobs to blowjobs, and then from blowjobs to fucking.
Harry’s fingers moved. Draco was hardly breathing, watching him. He couldn’t still be
,” Draco moaned. “So good. So fucking good.” He felt like he was on fire everywhere. The roots of his hair were tingling, his limbs trembling, his skin so hot and tight. He was panting like a bitch in heat, like an absolute whore, making so much noise, but he couldn’t help it and besides, it seemed like Potter fucking loved it. He could hear Potter’s breaths now, harder, more ragged, even though he was only rubbing himself through his trousers.
Draco’s stomach clenched. “What? What are you saying?” he asked, his voice suddenly clipped and harsh again.
Even Harry Potter couldn’t save Lucius Malfoy from Azkaban.
He’d told Potter that tomorrow he was planning to sleep alone because he wanted to see if he could. And that was partially true. Draco had stopped to worry, every now and then, about what would happen if Potter up and decided to get a girlfriend (or boyfriend). Would Draco simply never sleep again? It was dangerous to depend on someone this way; you were just setting yourself up to get hurt. So it had occurred to him that he should try sleeping alone periodically to make sure he didn’t get
“Oh, you don’t say?” said Draco. “You mean to tell me you’re not interested in siding with the motherfuckers who tried to
Theo’s eyes were dark and glittering and hard, like coal. “Fuck you, Draco.”
“You’d kill me unarmed? Like a coward?” Harry spat out at him.
“If I said no, would that stop you?”
“No, of course not,” Ginny sighed, returning to her dinner. “Only he just said –”
more, and that was no good. No good because Draco was just a slag that Harry got off with, and although that was thrilling at first, Draco knew it wasn’t going to last, and anyway, it wasn’t enough. It was never going to be enough, and the longer it went on, the more Draco was certain this was going to ruin him.
“Fuck!” he cried, slamming the Door shut and kicking at a nearby tree stump. “Fucking fuck!”
Mother fucker. Draco wanted to bang his head against the wall.
“Are you feeling okay?” Draco asked him. “Strong enough to keep walking?”
“What about them?” Harry asked.
Draco hated St. Mungo’s. He hated the smells, and he hated the generic pictures on the walls, and he hated the shine of the waxed floors. He hated the sickly green of the Healer’s robes and the feeling of hopelessness that washed over him every time he entered the building.
Potter sighed. “Robbie, meet Draco. He’s an old…” Potter paused, looking over at Draco and frowning. “Work colleague. He’s come to talk to me about something, although I haven’t been able to find out what yet. Draco, this is Robbie, my ex.”
Charlie nodded, stood, and put his coat back on. It seemed that he’d only just taken it off. He was only half done with his coffee. Draco gazed up at him, trying to memorize his face, because he wasn’t sure when he would see him again.
“It’s not for no reason, you arsehole!”
As Harry sat down on one of the sofas next to Mandy and Katie Bell, he wondered, too, how he was ever going to get over Draco. Because from the way his heart picked up speed as soon as Pansy mentioned his name, Harry knew for certain that he wasn’t yet. He wasn’t even close.
“Yes, bed,” said Draco, turning towards the wall, relieved at the opportunity to hide his face. Potter’s arm swung over him like it had done every night that week, and Draco put his hand over Potter’s once again. Only tonight, instead of leaning his forehead against the crook of Draco’s neck, Potter first pressed a kiss into the skin there, so softly that Draco might’ve only imagined it.
I search myself, I want you to find me
“Yes, Mother. It was Harry. He’ll be going to Hogwarts this year.”
, for fuck’s sake – and it wasn’t supposed to start when I still was…how I was. I wanted to be able to stand on my own two feet, Harry. I didn’t want to give you that broken, pathetic version of myself. I wanted to have something to offer you, and instead I was just someone who
She shook her head resolutely. “Not until you’re out of school, dear. I don’t want you distracted from your studies.”
And then Harry, who had stared down Voldemort’s wand without flinching, had found himself paralyzed by fear. He was a child again, a child in the cupboard, trying not to scream when he felt things creeping over his skin in the dark.
Harry turned back around, bringing his face close to Draco’s. “Mm,” he said, his mouth only inches away.
There was commotion by the door again, and Draco stood and pointed Harry’s wand and cast another blasting curse towards it, and someone went flying.
“That’s the worst way to miss somebody. When they’re right beside you and you miss them anyway.”
He apparated to the front of the Burrow and knocked. Molly answered the door, looking positively shocked to see him. He hadn’t seen much of her since the breakup with Ginny. “Harry!” she cried, sweeping him into a tight hug. “Oh my dear, it’s so lovely to see you! How are you?”
. But there was another class of what we might call demons that were more like gods and goddesses. These acted more of their own accord, had their own agendas, and could be good or bad, depending on the situation. They were all linked in various ways to the underworld, of course.
He blinked up at the moons, and then took a deep breath and peeked down at the beach.
He settled Michael’s body atop a raised marble tomb. He removed his own jumper, despite the cold, and folded it and tucked it under Michael’s head, and then cast several stasis spells over him, to preserve him for the time being.
“No, nobody was hurt. Toby – the big redhead? – he was the one who opened it. He had on his protective gear, though, so he seems fine. They’re checking him over at St. Mungo’s just to be safe, but I’m guessing he’ll be back in here this afternoon.”
, and how you relate to people. I think…oh, Harry, don’t take this the wrong way, but I think you need to see a mind healer. I think you need to work through some things before you can really move on.”
Malfoy finally showed the kids his laboratory, much to Lily’s delight, and Harry looked around the room, impressed. One entire wall was covered in Potions texts, and there were probably two dozen cauldrons bubbling away, and a dozen more empty and ready for use. The walls that didn’t house books housed endless glass jars of ingredients, some that Harry recognized and some that he did not. There was also a little mini-garden on one end, where several small plants were growing under lamps. The whole place smelled like the Potions classroom at Hogwarts, making Harry feel almost nostalgic.
Weasley made a face. “Oh, c’mon. Pulling them out feels so weird. I make a point to never do it. Ask anyone – that’s why I used to take such detailed notes in the field! So I wouldn’t have to pull out my memories later.”
“You and I are going to lunch,” he said.
“Aren’t you going to Hogsmeade?”
“Nikolai Volesky,” Pansy said, handing Draco a file. “Originally from Belarus, but he’s been in St. Petersburg for the last several years. We’re not certain how he came to be here, in London. He didn’t use any registered floos or Portkeys, and he didn’t come through muggle customs.”
“The fact that you had a crush on him didn’t mean you wanted to fuck him, Draco. What the
Potter aimed a wandless cleaning spell at Draco's shirt, which Draco only then noticed was soaked. “I’d say thank you, but it was your fault,” Draco murmured, feeling Potter’s tingling blast of magic against his skin. It smelled like him, a bit. Like sunshine on grass.
? “I have to see if Pansy’s available,” he said, searching her face for any sign of apprehension, of fear. There was none.
The kiss was messy and wet, and Harry groaned his climax into Robbie’s mouth, then fell back against him, Robbie holding him up while he finished, coming hard in Harry’s arse.
Draco quietly picked up a rock and transfigured it into something that resembled a gold coin.
Harry closed his eyes. “You shouldn’t.”
Draco watched in horror as another Rebel fell, his back slamming into the grass. Draco cast, sending out a massive wave of Sen to push the beast back, and stared, heart sinking, as his magic merely bounced off its fur harmlessly. He tried again, to no avail.
“Yes, I’m mad! It hurts!”
, Mr. Potter! It’s going to take all day, probably.”
Malfoy was talking with Pansy nearby, and whatever they were talking about must’ve been funny, because Malfoy kept laughing and smiling and his smile was quite nice, the way it sort of folded into his cheeks and made his eyes look like two little rainbows, or maybe like upside down smiles. His laugh was worth mentioning, too. He did this dry, vaguely-amused chuckling thing mostly, but sometimes, like now, when he really got going, it became these helpless, breathy giggles, and he would start wiping at his eyes because he’d be crying. And his face would turn a little pink, and he’d sort of gasp a bit, like he was laughing too hard to breathe. It always made Harry want to laugh too when he did that.
Malfoy chucked. “Sure,” he said, nudging him. “I totally believe you.”
Draco’s hole filled with lube and he gasped as Harry plunged a finger inside of him. “Well, I’ve clearly got a problem staying away from
Harry chuckled in a sort of strangled way. “Right. I, ah…sure. Yeah. Sure. What time?”
Berold, frowning, stepped over towards the gatehouse and looked up. It wasn’t being manned. “Hello!” he called. “It is Sir Berold, returned from Rodderem!” he cried.
Later that day, Harry and Hermione met with four different members of the Board and talked to them about SASS. Two of them (Karina Vogel and Melanie Cuthbert, both former Ravenclaws) agreed to vote yes to the proposal. One (Shepherd Farley, a former Gryffindor) said he would vote no and vowed to convince the rest of the Board to vote no. The last one (Zebadiah Greengrass, a distant cousin of Daphne’s and former Slytherin) said he would consider the matter, and hinted that perhaps he might be convinced to vote yes if the new school-wide colors were green and silver.
Draco turned slightly pink. “Sometimes. When Astoria’s at her mother’s.”
Your eyes focus on my funny lip shape
“Is it?” asked Harry. “I thought you were rather angry with me.”
“I don’t think I would do very well in Mysteries under those conditions. I value my job,” he said, rather sternly. And then because she was cry-laughing, he started laughing too, because his favorite Pansy was a cry-laughing Pansy. “This Pansy is my favorite,” he said, petting her cheek.
don’t you understand?” Draco huffed.
Draco shifted his gaze to the Ravenclaw table, where a more mature, not-at-all-frizzy-haired-or-buck-toothed Hermione sat, thumbing through her Arithmancy textbook and absently sipping at her tea. “Hermione,” he whispered in her ear. “I need to talk to you.”
“You’re the only one I do this with,” Harry said quietly.
Pansy furrowed her brow. “Maths? Eh, never mind. Muggle subject, I’m sure. Good for you, though. Do they like it?”
It felt so easy, last night, to be laughing and talking to Malfoy. Normal, almost, despite the fact that it was anything but. Maybe it had been the club atmosphere, or all the drinks, or the surrealist tint that the entire night had taken on. Harry wasn’t sure. What he was sure of, though, was that by the light of day, it didn’t feel easy or normal. There was a sense of uneasiness curling in his gut, and Harry wished to god he had gone home last night with Ron. For fuck’s sake, what would he say to Malfoy when Malfoy woke up? What did one say to one’s former nemesis after passing out against them after seeing them for the first time in nearly seven years? Were you supposed to hang around for breakfast or something?
“No, Jesus. Of course not! What in the world,” Harry said, a bit breathlessly.
“I can’t even fucking imagine, honestly.”
Charlie frowned. “That sounds ominous.”
The girls had stashed warm clothes for them in the bedrooms upstairs. The kitchen was stocked with meals placed under stasis and snacks and wine and whiskey and coffee and tea. The big room with wall-to-wall windows overlooking the ocean had a fireplace, and there was a nook next to it that seemed to be freshly stocked with wood. There was a library in the house full of muggle books, everything from paperbacks to glossy hardcover books on photography and space and seabirds and modern art.
“Don’t call her a slag,” Potter said dully.

“You can’t expect me to just pretend like nothing ever happened between us. You can’t expect me to forget last night. Or the Quidditch pitch. Or any of the rest of it.”
“You’re wrong. In fact…” Draco swallowed down the rest of his whiskey and waved for the bartender.
“Maybe,” he said. “I don’t know.”
Harry chucked a piece of scone at him. “Kindly fuck off, Malfoy,” he said, unable to keep himself from laughing a little.
Draco doesn't share well
“He’s engaged, okay?” Hermione finally snapped, whirling on Ron, who was a bit shorter and a lot narrower than he was now. “To Astoria Greengrass.”
You're driving me wild
Harry pushed Ron over and popped his head in. “So I get to crash a double date? Is that what you’re telling me?”
The corner of her mouth went up again. “Long one.”
But then, he’d always been a coward.
“Even my straight friends turned gay for me back then,” Draco said, undeterred. “Must’ve been the bad boy thing, I suppose,” he finished loftily.
Draco stared at him. The things that went on in Potter’s head were a total mystery to him, despite the fact that Potter seemed incapable of

“You do realize that I don’t
There's something that you won't show
Malfoy moved back over to maybe-Tessa and somehow anchored his hands to her chair – one on the edge of the seat and one on the seat back – and hoisted himself upside-down and humped her face. Maybe-Tessa giggled and turned red and rubbed her face in the shimmery fabric of Malfoy’s crotch. And then, Harry laughed. He honestly couldn’t help it. Everything was nonsensical and insane and Harry’d fallen into a crazy nightmare place where Malfoy was the world’s hottest stripper.
The furrow between Potter’s brows deepened and then smoothed back out. “Nah,” he said. “I need this more than I need sleep at the moment.”
Pansy chuckled and ran the back of her hand over Sarah’s freckled cheek. “You smell sweet. Like cupcakes.”
It could have been an earthquake, Draco supposed. Some natural disaster. He stifled a yawn as the Herald announced a new petitioner.
Draco wrapped his arms around himself. It was cold in the cottage and he was wearing cozy-looking sweatpants and his old Pudd United t-shirt (the one he used to tell muggles was for a semi-pro football team). Harry got up and fetched a knitted throw. “Here,” he said, draping it around Draco’s shoulders. “You look cold.”
“Mm, makes sense now, why they all loved you. You should’ve rubbed
“Okay,” Harry said, turning back to his research. “No worries. I’ll sleep at mine. I’ll see you tomorrow, yeah? Have a fun night.”
“What’s happened?” said Draco, sounding panicky. “Something bad, I can tell by your voice.”
“Draco!” exclaimed Hermione.

“Obviously, Padma doesn’t know. And Blaise is gay enough to suck my cock and fuck me up the arse, so, you know. At least a little gay, I’d say.”
“It just didn’t feel the same, like, I don’t know. Neither one of us was all that into it, it turned out, so we just sort of mutually ended it. Think she’s still hung up on you, to be honest,” he said, looking at Harry. “And I – it just wasn’t the same as last time. I didn't feel as mad about her as I used to.”
He blinked, and realized it was Euri’s voice. He considered, briefly, whether he ought to hide here in the kitchen, and then decided he was not going to be a coward about it.
He and Pansy danced again, and soon, a muscley bloke was moving in on Draco. Pansy stepped discreetly away, and Draco danced with him, but found he wasn’t really in the mood to pull anymore. He left the muscley bloke and looked around for Pans, but she appeared to have gone home already. He sighed, and decided that it was time to call it a night. He was tired, anyway, and that conversation with Potter had put him in an odd mood, left him feeling like his skin was wrapped too tightly around his bones.
