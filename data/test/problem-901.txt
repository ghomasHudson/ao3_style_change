"Dunno," Ronald shrugs. "I definitely like the punishment, but I also feel a little abandoned and it makes me sad. When I act up, Hermione gives me a lot of punishments, but also a lot of love and it makes me feel good."
You practically skip to the bathroom where you wash up, and just like the day before Draco and Harry are in the kitchen. Draco reading the paper, Harry cooking breakfast. You say nothing, but start the coffee before sitting atop one of the stools with your legs open. You are determined to look pretty and alluring for your Masters. Harry looks you over approvingly, but Draco merely shakes his paper lightly and ignores you.
The rest of the day flies by in a blur, there is lunch and you are ordered to clean up afterward. Harry and Draco are sorting through boxes of things that an old Aunt of Draco's left him when she died a few weeks earlier. They use you to throw rubbish away and when you aren't doing that, they have you sitting on Harry's office chair, your legs spread wide and slung over the arms of the chair. Mostly they ignore you unless they need something.
The Dom wiped some of the come off Draco's face with his hands, then held the hands out for Draco to lick clean, which Draco did happily. "You're a disgusting little cum slut, aren't you? You love the taste of come."
This went on for so long that Harry couldn't help but be impressed with Blaise's stamina. Finally Blaise pulled his dick out of Draco's mouth and gave himself  couple of wanks and came all over Draco's face.
"Yes Master Draco," You said as you make your way to the bathroom. You don't want to tell him, but you're a bit disappointed in your first spanking. You're used to much harder. But then, maybe your new Masters are easing you into something much more hardcore.
"And it is Master Draco!" he shouts. That's twice in a row you just called me Master and you will PAY for it after we eat.
Harry licked his lips. "I bought something I wanted to try out," he admitted. "Something for a new type of punishment."
"Maybe tomorrow night, we take them to the sex club and give them time in the punishment cages?" Ted asked.
"It's not all that matters, though." Harry said. "It matters to me that you try to get along with Ron and Hermione more."
The worst punishment for Ronald comes when Hermione video calls him. You had thought she was just going to be checking in, but he had to sit there and watch as she was pounded by two different guys. She would look directly into the camera and say, "Watch it Ronald. Watch this amazing guy slip his dick inside my pussy. Oh god, I'm so wet for him!" Then the guys would look into the camera and say things like, "You pathetic little cuck. Your wife is here and has sucked my cock twice already and you're over there getting your ass spanked. You're pathetic." And Hermione would laugh as one guy pounded her from behind while the other guy had his cock down her throat.
Draco was naked at this point and pulled the chastity belt up. It fit snugly around his cock and balls.
Blaise's eyes lit up. "Oh, I've used one of these before." He handed the box to Draco, who in his drunken state, still managed to look nervous.
Finally, the crowd started to thin a little, as people were packing up and going home. The first Dom of the night, the one with the three cocksluts, came into his cage along with the three cocksluts. The Dom attached the handcuffs higher on the cage, so Draco's back was against the bars, his arms raised above his head. "Do it," he nodded to his three subs.
Harry hesitated. "i know I said that I was going to punish you for a long time for what you and Amy did. But after everything you went through tonight, I feel like you've paid your price."
Draco climbed into his cage and Harry handcuffed him to one of the bars. Just a few feet away, Ted was handcuffing Amy to her own cage. Harry undressed down to his underwear and sat on the chair in front of Draco's cage and waited.
He pushed once hard on the clit before removing his hand. No need to torture her quite that much. Between the spanking and now watching his beautiful husband's ass turn red by another man, and all the other visuals they'd seen since coming into the club, Harry just new he couldn't last long. He grabbed Carly's bruised ass hard and buried himself as deep as he could into her hot cunt, letting his load blow.
"Don't be scared," Amy whispered to Draco. "I've done it before and I know you can make it through."
"Yes, Master Draco," You say, and you fall to your knees and kiss both of them on their feet. They seem nervous and you want to show right away that you prostrate yourself before them and will do whatever they bid, no matter the depravity.
Hermione leaves for her business trip, telling Ronald that she will video chat with him tomorrow. She gives Harry and Draco a few more instructions, including a rundown on Ronald's attitude problem for the week and tells them that they can decide best how to punish him.
"Yes Master Harry." You sit up straighter in the stool and widen your legs are far as you can so they have a perfect view of your perky and pink pussy. God, you're horny and you want one of their cocks inside you. You long for it, but you know that they are the ones who get to decide about what goes deep into you. They say nothing as they eat and look at you. You feel so vulnerable and observed. And frankly, a little slutty sitting there naked and splayed open for two men whose cocks you desire.
"Sure," Harry said. "Should she be nude, or maybe wearing that blue dress that makes her look like such a slut."
The rest of the day, you work on being the absolute best submissive you know how to be. You make extra sure to call them Master Harry and Master Draco. You do whatever they want, posing, getting food, cleaning, and you do it all with a good attitude. That night, they do not ignore you during their lovemaking. Though you are still not permitted to come, they do allow you to suck their cocks which you do happily.
Harry removes your diaper and Hermione removes Ronald's. You watch and are stunned all over again at the massive size of Ronald's cock. You were starting to think you were exaggerating it in your mind, but no. There it is in front of you, the largest dick you've ever seen and all over again you aren't sorry at all you took the chance to have it in your puss. The diapers, the spankings,the humiliation. All of it was worth it to you because Ronald has a glorious prick.
The Doms were in front of the cages. Both Doms were men, but inside the two cages, were one man and one woman. Harry talked to the Dom of the woman. "I've never been able to spank a woman before," he said. "I'd like a chance to change that with your sub."
The Masters stand you and Ronald about ten feet apart and order you to stand with your legs spread and your hands clasped behind your back. Your tits are jutted out and you see Ronald glancing at them. Hermione sees him doing the same thing and places a slap right across his face. It stuns you because face-slapping is forbidden between you and your Masters. But Ronald only looks appropriately shamed. "I can't blame him for looking," Hermione said to your Masters, "Your little whore does have a magnificent set of tits."
Everything was silent for a full second before Harry marched over and pulled Draco forcefully from Amy. His penis, still erect and with a condom on, slipped out of her pussy. Without taking his pants off, or pulling them back up, Harry walked Draco back to the parlor. "Pants off," he demanded.
Draco stood facing Harry, their erect cocks facing each other, only an inch between them. "Repeat after me," Harry said. "Harry is the ultimate authority in this house and Draco is to submit to him."
Harry turned and saw Blaises mouth still around Draco's crotch, and Draco frantically humping his way into Blaise's mouth. Harry laughed, "It's not going to work, Draco. You can stop trying."
Draco did as he was told as Harry removed the leather belt from around his pants. Harry heard the hitch in Draco's breath, knowing that this was not going to be any normal spanking, but he was going to be belted. Harry held the two ends of the belt together and snapped the leather together. At the snapping sound, Draco's ass lifted a little higher off the pillow, as though he was instinctively searching for the pain.
He looked around and realized that almost the entire crowd of doms had come at nearly the same moment. Two women were still getting their pussies licked and everyone watched as those two women reached their climaxes at the same time.
The Masters put their clothes back on and you start realizing that you need the bathroom, but you aren't permitted to speak to ask permission to go. You are unsure what to do, so you bit your lip, hoping they'll notice. It takes a moment, but you squeezed your legs together bounce a little. "Do you need the toilet?" Harry asks.
Harry pulled his finger out and slicked up his own cock before setting the tip just at Draco's entrance. "Relax," Harry whispered in Draco's ear. "You'll be too tight if you can't relax." Draco took a deep breath, and Harry could feel his asshole loosen. Harry pushed forward.
"Let me send Madame Kat an owl," Ted said. "To get time in the cage you have to request it and tell her what the subs did. She'll decide if the punishment fits the crime."
Blaise flopped on the bed and Harry climbed on top of him, kissing him deeply. They were still clothed, and kissing deeply on the bed when Draco walked in. He didn't say anything, but stood in the doorway, awaiting his order. "Go sit in the chair and watch us," Harry ordered.
Madame Kat's sex club became a regular hangout for Harry and Draco. They didn't go every single weekend, because they didn't want the novelty of it all to wear off. But once or twice a month was their sweet spot. They didn't even use the BDSM room all the time. Sometimes, they stayed in the main room and just joined into whatever group sex or orgy they could.
"Yes Master Draco," you say and you slip easily between them. You're no sooner on the bed, than Master Harry is snaking his hand up your leg and right to the nest between your legs. His fingers slip into you, gather up some of your juices, which he rubs all around your clit. You gasp at the pleasure.
You hesitate and stare as Ronald starts to stroke his cock. Your hand moves to your pussy automatically and you finger your clit a little bit. You bite your lip. You know you shouldn't do this, but my God he is magnificent and you can't stand the thought of his hand on his own cock, when you want it to be your hand. Finally you nod your head at him and he closes the space between the two of you and kisses you deeply.
Draco turned his head and met Harry's eyes. "Harry. I trust you. I can't tell you when to take it off, because you get to decide that. I'm extremely sorry for what Amy and I did, but I am submitting to you and your decision about my punishment."
Before you know it, Hermiones legs are clamped around your head, you can feel her pussy quivering, and she is rocking back and forth shouting, "Yes! Yes, Girl!" before slowing down and evening out her breathing.
Harry and Ted sat on the couch, with Draco and Amy at their heels again. A few others came over to talk, and Harry got to learn about all the other types of Dominant and Sub relationships there were. This was like a whole new world to him. Harry really found Ted quite attractive, and realized if you couldn't be blunt about what you wanted in a sex club, where could you be?"
"A couple of rules," Harry said. "No sleeping with him when I'm not there and be home in time for dinner with me."
"Correct. When I said you have glorious breasts, who do those breasts belong to when you're in this house?"
"First is that we have some tough punishments planned for you. Use your safeword if you need to." He pauses, "But! That is the only speaking you'll be allowed to do. You aren't allowed to talk. Understood?"
Madame Kat left them to walk around and take it all in. "Strip down to your underwear," Harry ordered Draco. They stuck out with Draco being the only dressed sub. Draco did immediately, standing proudly next to Harry with his erect cock jutting far out in front of him.
"Well, right now you are going to start by finding me a white shirt, and pressing it. And I will deal with your punishment once that is finished."
The eighth hit was somehow, even harder than the other's had been, and on Draco's already red ass, it was really starting to sting. As he called out "Eight," the tears flowed down his face. This took Harry aback and he wondered if he needed to stop.
Harry nodded, pleased with himself. "Absolutely. I also make him tell me why he deserves his punishment and I'll sometimes give a nice little lecture about his behavior."
Blow after blow and you start to consider your safeword. Afterall, you'll need to sit in your office chair tomorrow. At that moment, whoever is paddling you must have the same realization, because the paddling is done.
"Two spanks for each rule broken. That's a total of four," Harry said, though he was unsure if that was correct. "And, uh, you need to count along, OK Draco?"
Harry licked his lips and turned to Draco. "You're going in the punishment cage at Madame Kat's tomorrow."
Harry folded his hands in front of him and looked at Draco intently. "I'm sorry, but who do you think cleaned the toilets before we started our domestic discipline situation?"
"Sorry," Draco mumbled, not sounding very sorry at all. Well, this was going to add to his punishment time!
You don't say anything but redouble your efforts to stay as still as possible, though your arms feel like they want to give out.
They don't stop and when their first ice cubes melt, they grab another two and continue to work it over your body. You feel like you're going to scream in agony but at the same time you don't want them to stop. You love this attention and you love this pain. The ice continues to freeze your body, you have the biggest goose flesh you've ever hand in your life and your nipples are both tightened little stones. The only place you feel warmth is in your vagina, which wet with the desire that often comes with pain for you.
Draco moved his plate to the floor and Harry watched for a few moments as he and Amy, on all fours, stuck their faces into their plates and began eating. Oh, this humiliation was delicious and especially would work on Draco who'd been raised with such high ideals of table manners.
Even though he'd just come, he could feel his cock swelling once again, as he made his way back up to the bedroom where he removed every last stitch of clothing and lay down face up and spread eagle on his bed, waiting for his submissive husband to come please him however he told him to.
You had a Dom, once upon a time. And your time with him was perfect in your eyes. You don't want to be a full-time sub. You have a real life, after all. You're in upper management in the corporate world. It's a lot of stress, and your relief has always been being a sub on the weekend.
After breakfast, where Harry allowed Draco to eat at the table with him, Harry decided that he wasn't going to punish Draco physically today. He would get enough of that at Madame Kat's. Instead, they sat in the parlor while Harry made Draco talk to him about his and Amy's decision to have sex the day before. This was possibly worse for poor Draco who really had to use some introspection to figure out exactly why he did it. Initially he just said he was horny and so was she and often when they had sex with Harry and Ted, that they weren't allowed to come and they were afraid that would happen again. But then Harry wanted to get deeper psychologically, and Draco finally admitted to feeling like if he didn't misbehave, Harry might lose interest in their sub lifestyle.
"Blaise, you're welcome to stay after dinner," Harry said. He glanced at Draco, "Draco's safeword is checkmate."
"Nah," Harry shrugged. "Those dishes aren't going to do themselves. But maybe later on tonight, I'll let you fuck me and come in my ass."
"Draco is to respect Harry's ultimate authority in the household and willingly submit to any disciplinary acts that Harry deems necessary."
It was a fast and punishing speed and Harry could barely stand it, how amazing it felt to have his cock wrapped in the tight warmth of his submissive husband's ass. Every breath and every quiver that came from Draco could be felt keenly in Harry's cock. He could feel his balls tighten and he leaned forward, grabbing onto Draco's dripping dick.
"What happened?" She spun to ask me, arms crossed, as soon as we were out of earshot of anyone else.
I shied away from the concerned look that followed us out, but where I looked for anger to protect myself with, I found none. Honestly, it felt… Warm… To know I was being looked out for by people who had every right to hate me. And not just watched like a hawk in case I went full evil, or whatever, but actually… Worrying
"Sorry. Just... Lost in thought, again." I attempted a weak chuckle, but Draco's curiosity turned to concern.
"Harry…" I said quietly, panic surging in my chest. My arm suddenly started burning where my Dark Mark was, and I cried out in pain.
I nearly fell stepping back over the bench, but didn't let it slow my escape from the crowded Great Hall. I didn't check to see if Draco was following me, I only walked until I found a secluded hallway.
"Morning," she commented sleepily as she slid onto the bench beside Harry. His eyes narrowed at me as if to say
Longbottom's mouth was actually hanging open. Harry's chewing mouth could hardly stay closed as wide as he was grinning. Finnegan looked like he'd lost the ability to comprehend language. Even Weasley was leaning around Granger and Harry to make sure he'd heard me right.
"I understand," Draco nodded. "What about Quidditch? Think you'll join the team again this year? Tryouts are coming up soon. Not that
"By the way…" My eyes were finally drawn up towards his as he spoke. "Where the hell did you learn how to fasten a chest harness?"
"Tonight, I'd like you all to use your telescopes that you should have purchased by now, to find the dark cloud constellation pictured here in your textbooks. It should be visible a few minutes past midnight, at the coordinates listed beneath the image. Be ready to talk about your findings in the next class."
Suddenly, my father appeared in the doorway to our compartment. His expression was completely livid, like I'd only seen a handful of times.
A soundless voice sounded in my head, but I immediately knew whose it was. My head whipped round to easily find Harry's smirk.
No one would speak to him the first day, of that he was sure. But that wouldn't last long. He quickly dodged all interaction and fled up the spiral staircase to the boy's quarters and found his room. Once the door shut behind him, he breathed a sigh of relief. He'd made it this far, hadn't he? He couldn't give up now.
"Hermione's one of the last people you should worry about. That is, unless you get on her bad side."
"A new year begins at Hogwarts. I wish to welcome you, and welcome you back, not with warnings or bad news, but with hope. The reality of us all gathering once again in this Hall is a victory – a triumph in the face of evil. Let us never forget, we are witches and wizards, and we do not cower in the face of fear. We stand firm, we reunite, and we push on. Let this year be a new chapter in our stories."
Hermione took one glance at me as I practically came bounding back, and my jubilance was suddenly sobered as she gave me a smug grin.
so relax I did. Or tried to, at least. My hands seized his neck and brought our foreheads together as I grit my teeth. The sensation was jarring, but as I allowed him into me, a spark of pleasure lit in me.
"Well, I was gonna visit Hagrid, but that'll probably be later this afternoon. This morning, I have some questions I need answered, and I… Think I might know where to look."
"I think expecting the best is just as silly as expecting the worst. All we can do is wait and see, and be ready for anything. Couldn't be worse than what we've already been through, right?"
‘Not as much as you put into me’ was his surprising response, though, and I quirked an eyebrow at him. His suggestive expression nearly made me burst into laughter in the middle of class, but I choked it down.
“It’s hard to tell them apart in the dark,” I casually commented as I lifted his collar and removed my tie, doing the same to myself. A long silence stretched across the table as Harry froze, blushing furiously, but allowing me to don his tie onto its rightful neck, and doing up my own.
"It's… Probably not applicable to your situation, but… It's a very, very early memory I have of my parents… Talking to me."
I had the sudden urge to take his hand like Luna had taken mine when we first returned to the Astronomy tower.
His eyes darted up to mine as he paused lacing up his shoe, but hastily returned to his task, pink flooding into his cheeks. Clearing my throat, I pushed one arm, and then the other into my uniform shirt and began doing up the buttons. We dressed ourselves in silence as I desperately searched for something to say.
"Bloody hell, Harry." He flopped back onto the bed beside me. "You're scary powerful, you know that?"
"We've all had just about enough of conflict and enemies, I think. We're happy for you," Hermione chimed.
"Hm," he hummed in assent. We lay there on the grass peacefully for a long several moments before we both resurfaced into consciousness.
I eyed the brunette from behind, and just as I was wondering if he could feel me looking at him, his shoulders slumped slightly. Not in a tired way, or a bored way, but in a… Sad way?
"I thought that's they type of thinking we've been trying to spank out of you. I thought it was working."
"Oh precious," Harry said, planting a kiss on Draco's forehead. "I'm so proud of you for taking it like this. Now, get naked and stand in the corner and think about what you've done."
"Gladly," Draco said and dropped to his knees before Harry. Harry's dick hadn't been touched yet, but it was already half hard, and with just a few cursory wanks from Draco, it was fully erect in no time at all. Draco looked like he was in heaven as he opened his mouth and took Harry's cock in his mouth. He used his tongue, working its way up and down Harry's shaft and swirling it around the head.
"Are you serious?" Normally Draco did the fucking and Harry got fucked. It'd been quite a while since Draco allowed himself to be opened for Harry's cock.
Meanwhile, Harry kept his eye on the cage. The cocksluts' Dom had chosen the hairbrush, and he was ordering Draco to apologize to Harry for his transgressions. "I'm sorry, Sir!" Draco said, and SMACK, one hit on the ass. This Dom was big and muscular and he did not hold back at all as his arm raised and lowered and brought the hairbrush over Draco's ass.
Harry licked his lips. "I hate that I work outside the home, and you stay home but I still do most of the cooking and cleaning."
Eventually, the sex club filled up, and couples began trickling into the BDSM room. One Dom was a man with three subs. The subs were all leashed, and crawling on their hands and knees behind their Dom. The Dom was a large man, well over six feet tall. He looked Draco up and down. "What'd you do to earn time in this cage?" he demanded.
Sure enough, Blaise walked in, still wearing a smart and sharp looking suit and dress robes from his mother's wedding and grinned to see Draco's backside standing in the corner. "I see he's been punished more today. Corner time? And look at that red ass. My my, that must have been some spanking."
Draco was shocked, he'd never been pissed on before. Instinctively, he pulled his legs away, but the cocksluts just took as step further as they released their urine on him. He was surprised at the warmth of it, like a warm shower. For the first time, he was tempted, truly tempted, to use his safeword. But he just bit his lip and took it. It was only pee, he legs could he washed.
"No!" Draco said. "It's not like that! I mean, when I act up, when I'm a little shit like I was at Ron and Hermione's that night, you get to discipline me."
Draco was overcome with a desire to show Harry, to show every single Dom here, that he was the sub who could do anything. He could take what they handed out, no matter how much it hurt (and his nipples were still screaming in pain). But he also wanted those Dom's to be jealous of Harry and of Draco's skills in the bedroom, and what Harry got on a nightly basis. He was a Slytherin after all, and his ambition to be the most submissive sub was really coming through.
Ted lay back on the floor, legs spread and his asshole lubed, waiting for Harry's cock to penetrate him. Harry took a look around and liked what he saw. Men going down on women, Men going down on other men, people of all genders fucking each other. It was the hottest thing he'd ever seen.
Harry continued the punishing speed, and realizing it'd be torturous to hold Draco back anymore, commanded him, "Come!"
You are humiliated that your food is in a dog bowl with a bowl of water next to it. You kneel down gently and stick your face in the bowl. It's a saucy noodle dish with vegetables and chicken. You began eating, knowing you aren't allowed to use your hands. You feel a full body blush when Harry and Draco laugh at you, "Look at that Girl," they sneer. "Eating like the fucking bitch she is." Or saying things like, "She's not even worth a place at the table, not even worth a plate!" When you drink out of the bowl it made you cough and they just laugh at you.
"Thank you." Harry leaned in for a kiss, and though their kisses goodbye were usually just a peck on the lips, this one was much more smoldering.
Harry had Draco spend a full hour writing lines. He had to copy all of his household rules as many times as he could in that hour. After that, he was instructed to do housework, which was probably the best thing to keep his mind from worrying too much about the cage. Just as Draco was folding laundry that evening, Ted and Amy came by. They were all going to go to Madame Kat's together, as the subs who were scheduled to be caged were supposed to get there early.
He made eye contact with Draco, who was frowning. He looked across to Ted who was getting his cock sucked by the male sub from the other cage. "Ted," Harry called out. "After you come, please take Draco and spank him. He disapproves of me spanking another."
Harry was beginning to wonder if that was it - if that was his life as a disciplinarian. One major misbehavior from his submissive husband and his attitude had improved that much? Not that Harry was looking for a reason to give another spanking, Gods that had made him nervous as hell before, but he wanted to try it again. Still, rules were rules and he wasn't going to actually hit his husband unless he flagrantly broke one of their ten written rules.
"Now," Hermione says, standing in front of you after she got her clothes back on. "You two are going to have a contest. Whoever can hold their piss the longest wins. The loser takes an extra punishment.
Time passes by and eventually they are done their work and got you out of your chair. You left a small wet spot where your pussy had dripped and Draco notices it. "Looks like this slut enjoys sitting in a hard chair all exposed for her Masters."
"Yes Master Harry," You say, and you busy yourself with your task. You don't drink coffee, so you only make enough for two. "Master Harry, do you like your coffee strong?"
The Dom laughed in Draco's face and slapped him one more time, "I don't believe it you worthless little bitch." Then he turned around and walked away. He snapped his fingers and the cockluts crawled to their master, awaiting their leashes and hoping for another cock to worship. "Let go work on that one," he said, and they walked over to Amy's cage.
"I'm in a rush, Ronald. I just want to have the experience of her mouth on my clit, then I will leave you to be dealt with by Harry and Draco."
Draco looked pained, but he made his way down the bed and took Harry in his mouth, giving him a morning blowjob. After that, Harry sent Draco down to start breakfast, while Harry tried to devise a plan for Draco's punishment.
The next night, Harry was getting antsy. It was getting late, well past when he thought Draco would be home and certainly very late to begin cooking a real dinner. There had been no word from Draco, no owl saying he was going to be late. No owl asking for permission to stay out late or asking Harry to please being prepping dinner. Harry glanced at the kitchen. He supposed he could start something, and tack on a punishment for Draco not only being late, but for leaving dinner prep to Harry. He was definitely breaking house rules.
Blaise had figured out the game. Everytime he'd say something dirty to Draco, Draco would instinctively start rutting at the air and Harry would bring the switch across Draco's thighs. It was a delicious little game, and Blaise didn't mind using his huskiest voice to say to Draco, "This is what you're best at, sucking my cock while your husband punishes you," or "You've been such a naughty little bitch, Draco. You deserve everything you've gotten," or "If you were my sub, I wouldn't go as easy on you has Harry. It'd be nothing but blowjobs for me while you would sit in your little chastity belt all day every day." Each time, Draco would let a whine in the back of his throat go and his hips would buck and Harry'd bring down the switch.
Draco takes his time to talk about something parliament is doing, but you tune it out. That's weekday Girl. The only things you need to know for the weekends are how to please your Masters.
Finally he's done and wow, does your backside STING! You weren't sure Master Harry would have it in him, but he sure does!
But as you get back up to continue working on breakfast, you start to feel guilty. And you realize Ronald does too. Oh, what have you done? Your Masters will truly let you have it now. You know you've disappointed them.
And over the next several days he tried to get the thought out of his head, but it wouldn't go anywhere. It implanted itself in his brain, and like a seed began to germinate until he had a complete picture of how to change, and how to fix his relationship with Harry.
You do as she asks, and within seconds, Hermione is straddling your face and you are eating her pussy. You remember what the Masters said to you, that Hermione has a strong libido and comes several times daily. Not only that, but she is very easy to bring to orgasm.
Draco's mouth wobbled a bit, "Yes sir." He licked around his lips, tasting the come still cooling on his face.
The dom looked satisfied and pulled hard on the clamps, making Draco's nipples stretch in front of his body. He let go of the dildo in his mouth and howled in pain. The Dom slowed for a moment, waiting to see if he'd use his safeword, but he didn't. His breath was shaking and coming in quick spurts. The dom let go of the clamps and they dangled back onto Draco's chest.
Harry glanced over to Ted and Amy and saw Amy in her cage being fucked from behind, her large tits already had welt on them from what looked like being switched. Her tits were swinging too and fro as the man behind her savagely thrust as hard and fast as he could. Ted, in front of the cage, was being ridden by a woman, obviously the sub of the man in the cage with Amy, who was covered from head to toe in loose black clothing, with only her eyes, tits, cunt and ass areas exposed. Harry considered forcing Draco to cover completely except for his cock and ass next time they came here to the BDSM room.
Draco took a deep breath, wiped his tears, and said. "I was reminded that you are the higher authority in this house and I need to submit myself to your rules."
"Sure," Harry said eagerly. He snapped his fingers for Draco to follow, while Ted pulled Amy along by her leash.
Draco had made a beautiful salad with a steak and kidney pie. "It's lovely, Draco." Harry said, "Thank you."
But what you are most interested in is Hermione, because of what the Masters have told you. Hermione, they say, has the most active libido of anyone they have ever met. Her need to orgasm is unbelievable. If she doesn't come a MINIMUM of four times a day, she gets really anxious. Coming relaxes her, and because of that, she comes several times each day. She is so good at it, that she comes really fast, because often at work she needs to take a bathroom break to masturbate. And there is no limit to how often she can come. Her record is fifteen times in one day! Needless to say that keeps Ron busy in the evenings during the week, and when he's Ronald on the weekend, even busier.
Draco smirked, and the Dom quickly turned him around and let loose five hard smacks on his back. "Don't get an ego about it," she ordered.
Harry took the hairbrush and he felt Carly positively shivering in his lap. Whether it was from fear or anticipation, he didn't know. She hadn't used her safeword, so Harry knew it was OK to continued. But instead he watched for a moment as Ted pulled Draco's underpants down. They'd gotten a lot of attention, Draco and Harry being new to the scene afterall. There were some appreciative murmurs as Draco's gorgeous cock was exposed for all to see. Draco settled himself over Ted's lap and closed his eyes in anticipation. As the first thunderous spanking struck him, Harry instinctively thrust his hips, grinding his hard cock into Carly's midsection. She gasped.
The worst part was - it was true. This is what he'd signed up for. As his and Harry's lives had taken on more of a 24/7 sub and dom lifestyle, this is what was bound to happen. He was going to screw up bigtime, and he'd agreed in advance for some pretty harsh punishment. Draco closed his eyes and made a pact with himself. This night couldn't last forever. The nights at Madame Kat's always came to and end, and this one would too. All he had to do was make it through and then he'd be home with Harry in the comfort of their bed.
Such a silly silly boy; so many denied or refuted pleasures just for the reason that they are not proper. Being proper got his family in the arms of the Dark Lord, maybe a bit of mischief would get him in Potter’s embrace.
Oh wow, this is my first dialogue scene, so excuse the awkwardness. I am planning to include way more of this in the future and I think it was high time the two of them had a proper scene together!
The moment the elf let a small pop, Draco was running towards his bedroom to splash some water on his face and pray to Merlin his big mouth will not get him in trouble. Truthfully, he was not scared of Potter’s influence over the Ministry or the whole world; it was actually something closely resembling shame and the deeply rooted desire for the boy to like him, really like him and seek his presence. But Draco will never say these words out loud, they have to stay buried under Potter’s smell of fresh soil and hope.
Having a coke with Crabbe would require a dash of fire whiskey; not sure if those two go together but anyhow... Crabbe was never a feelings or even words guy, he would just do what he was told and the rest of the time focus on his trees. For such a simple man, he really had a strong connection with nature. People would praise Longbottom and call him Herbology Hermione, but Crabbe was the real deal. At his family’s village estate, he would check the status of potatoes, converse about how the corn was doing and come up with better ways to keep pests away. He’d prune apple trees and water the strawberries and ask the villagers for updates and advice. And it was all done with his hands, you’d think he was some sort of a Squib; but no, our Vincent just liked touching and healing the soil. His father got tired of beating him up when Crabbe turned 9; he taciturnly accepted his son was not an elegant nobleman and focused more on his brothers and sisters. He was a brute, but also a salt of the earth man. He was a bully, but he was also his best friend.
Draco raised his eyebrows, ready to go ahead and check the Saviour’s sanity and cognitive abilities, but Harry continued
Proud of his short, but perfectly discussion generating letter, Draco got back under the covers and started slowly singing the song to himself.
A part of Draco died then and there, among the lost and dirty faces filled with adrenaline and not realising that everything was done for. His beautiful Paris, evil-hearted Paris, was dead and no one was going to save him from the cruelty of the world. Another piece of him was shattered when the abominable welcomed him with a hug. A bloody hug from Voldemort…
He took a step closer to Harry, whose face was so open, so honest as if he was saying “I mean it, I truly do” and Draco could not stop his steps until he was facing Potter directly.
Of course he survived and Harry never touched his cheek or combed his own hair. During the Battle, when Voldemort declared Harry Potter dead and did his sinister victory dance, Draco mourned for the fact that Harry received no warm touch, no last hug. And the selfish part in him mourned that Harry would never sooth him, never be there long enough to maybe work out their troubles, have a firewiskey and maybe...be friends, be something.
Draco and I compiled a list of books about antidotes from the back of our textbook and then set about tracking them all down from the library's shelves. It was times like these when the picture seemed incomplete without a bookworm like Hermione, but I wasn't displeased with the company.
So lost was I in my post-coital bliss that I'd completely forgotten to check. Draco pressed a kiss to my cheek before rolling out of bed. I couldn't resist following him with my eyes as I rolled onto one side.
She offered me a small smile, but in her eyes, I could've sworn I saw a mischievous glint. My eyes narrowed just a fraction in response.
In a twisted way, Draco felt responsible for Harry’s misfortunes, for how he was moulded to be a tragic hero, the proverbial sacrificial lamb. And he never failed to deliver, as he slowly but steadily went for his demise in the corrupted shape of Voldemort.
His childhood felt so far away and yet so close as if he could almost taste it with the tip of his tongue. Bellatrix had almost licked the tears on Granger’s cheek when straddling her in the middle of the Drawing room.
“Do you think I am redeemable, Potter? Do you think there’s any hope?” There was no point of coming back once the words were out, so he stared directly into Harry’s eyes, bracing himself for the reply.
That was how Narcissa found him, laying on his back, eyelids half closed, half watching the leaves. She quickly muttered an "
We are all trying to drown our loneliness, to fill in as many seconds with mindless interactions and activities, knowledge and supposed wisdom. All we do is push to the back of our minds the pure and constant loneliness we all are doomed to feel. Harry won’t save him from being lonely, no one can, but his light would definitely brighten Draco’s life. What can he offer Potter?
The trees were in full bloom, with cherries waiting to pop from their stems and strawberries as big as fists. The pond was calm, save for a couple of excited fish bouncing around joyfully. Sun rays were allowed to penetrate the protection spell cast on the garden and you could actually feel them on your skin. And then dust, so so much dust and destroyed walls and Troy falling in the form of Hogwarts after Voldemort’s wrath.
“You sir are a savage and you have the manners of a sea urchin, but glad you stopped by” He did not know what to do: hug Potter? Was this something they were doing now?
you Pimky, I will be inside in a moment. Please show Mister Potter to the dining room and offer him a drink”
Once when he was 10, before the letter, before school days, before all the darkness, he cut himself playing with his mini quidditch broom. Just a small cut right under his knee, but it stung and his eyes felt heavy. Whenever he would get hurt or see blood he would suddenly get very sleepy, as if asleep the wound would heal itself and just disappear. Or the world would disappear.
That vile creature, that abomination, had actually danced when announcing that Potter is dead. There was no sight in the world more sickening and against all that’s natural than that.
“Oh, that can be arranged. I will talk to Kingsley and have it all arranged by them. You won’t be kept away from pancakes on my watch”
“This belongs to you. I want to thank you for forcefully lending it me. It has served me a great deal, but now it has to come back to you.”
A slight breeze was forever bewitched to blow slightly in the Malfoy gardens; Narcissa insisted is crucial for the aromas to spread evenly and not give visitors the feeling of unnatural stillness. But the cursed breeze also made Potter’s scent travel, and it was better than 1000 rose bushes.
Draco tossed and turned in his bed, thought of peaceful sleep replaced by panic. What if it’s the Friday bit so they meet tomorrow??
In the Manor’s library, stacked behind old potion books and scholarly texts from the 18th century, he found some muggle poetry books. The library trip had no specific purpose and, as curiosity always beats disgust, Draco started flipping through them. He found himself watching through the eyes of the virgin reader; neither hopeful nor judgemental, just there.
“Mr Potter, we are ready to go” a tall man in dark robes sat right in front of them, bearing a stern and almost bored look.
“See you very soon, Malfoy, and stay away from Lancelot!” With these words he jumped into the green flames and Draco was left once again angry at his newly found poetic soul.
When Potter failed to shake his hand, Draco felt small and weak and unimportant. It was not fair to blame it on him, of course; Draco was to blame way more. And Harry took some kinder hands, hands that loved and used him with equal strength.
It seems that I will be able to update the story each night, hope the muses will stay beside me! Thank you for reading and please do let me know what you think! 🌸
And then they would laugh and laugh with their knees gently pressed and the coke fizzling away, forgotten on some corner of the table.
Most of the poems were nothing special; not gag-inducing, not beautiful, just…poetry. But there was a line that he remembered now, that for some odd reason resonated: “Childhood is the kingdom where nobody dies”. Was it true what the Muggle lady wrote?
Pimky appeared in the room announcing that lunch was to be served. He wanted to jump back, but Harry held him tightly and only let go of him gradually as if two lovers that were not yet ready to depart and had all the time in the world to detangle.
“Of course, and you will find that the Manor has one of the best lunches available” Merlin, Draco, have you gone barmy? Are you selling him your services? Get it together!
“I am half sick of shadows” was what came out of Draco’s mouth and then he was hugging Harry, squeezing as if his dear life was holding on to it as if that was the answer to all the questions he ever asked or will ever ask.
Omg my first Kudos!!! I am simply blown away! Thank you to whoever is reading my ramblings, I so appreciate it!
Was Potter sleeping? Images of a shirtless, sleeping dark-haired boy flooded his mind and suddenly there were so many pressing questions: Did he dream? Did he wear some ridiculous pyjamas offered by an obnoxious Weasley? Did he ever dream of Draco?
He would’ve liked to think it’s because of the abandonment part since Draco felt let down by his father, by his professors, by fate itself. But it was not exactly that; something deep down in him, an abyss of silence, like a pool of stagnant water filled with rotten weeds was screaming “Harry! Harry! Harry!”
“I have finished most of the books in Malfoy Manor, so I tried some of the exotic choices available. Poetry, one can say, is magic in itself, so it is not important who produced it” It was a good answer and Draco was proud of coming up with it.
Then the rest is history. As Draco was preparing to leave, disapparate along with his parents, Harry caught his wrist and just stared at him for what seemed like years. He then whispered a choked “Draco…” and Draco let the biggest smile escape his heart; a smile that he never knew he even had inside him, but once let out, refused to go away. Then Potter smiled and chuckled and let him leave. Dear mother Ida, harken ere I might survive for a little bit longer.
“Hello Potter, fancy seeing you here!” Draco tried to sound aloof and cool as a cucumber, using the same smug and superior expression he mastered in his youth at the Manor.
“My agenda is wide open, Potter, so consider yourself invited any day for lunch” Uhhh, I sound exactly like all his bloody fans, hold it together, Draco.
“Unfortunately I am still in house arrest or, as the Aurors put it, strongly advised not to leave the Manor’s premises” his mouth was curled and smug, but his eyes shadowed sadness and disgust at his imprisonment.
“The Slytherin Hermione” Harry laughed again and with each smile, Draco’s heart was doing another somersault.
It was getting awkward way faster than Draco imagined, so he opted to just cough slightly and guide Potter towards a bench close to the blooming rose bushes.
Thank you loads for all the reads and kudos (OMG I GOT TO 5 which is insane!!) and hope you will come back for more.
He could have a coke with Hermione and Ron maybe and apologise for everything even though most likely they would pour it on his head. Draco was sure that it would make everything sticky sweet, but so is life. He would tell them that he doesn’t hate them, never did, that it was just some sort of juvenile jealousy for limitless wits and a family that loves you for who you are, plain and simple. Hermione would look concerned and Ron would laugh at first and then get ready to punch him, but the punch would never come and both of them would awkwardly forgive him and sip the coke in silence.
“Me too…” said Harry and squeezed right back and rubbing slowly Draco’s back up and down, left and right, never lingering for too long in one spot and never stopping the movement of the hand.
Right, write a letter asking Potter which day he meant exactly. Or if it’s a surprise and he is not entitled to know? Nonsense, the ministry was involved and they for sure wanted clear dates.
That old Tennyson lad had looked particularly pained on the cover of his poetry book; he appeared to be somewhere very far away, stuck in older times, together with his mythology and tragic figures. Draco would never admit it, but he identified the most with the nymph Oenone, abandoned by her beloved Paris for “the fairest and most loving wife in Greece”.
Harry glanced around, trying to fix his eyes on the rose bush on Draco’s left side, but his eyes kept dancing back to the white-haired boy. He was trying to find his words, or maybe to choose them wisely. It seemed that finally the words were arranged properly because he smiled gingerly and opened his mouth to finally say them.
I really like poetry so I want to incorporate some poems that I think Draco might find cool. Hope you like it!
The second worst pain was Harry’s spell in the girls’ bathroom. But that pain was almost soothing; as if along with the blood, the dark ink found its way into the water on the bathroom floor and away from him. He really should’ve died at the hands of The Chosen One. Did that make him also The Boy Who Lived?
Potter smiled shyly and, even though that mop that Potter called hair was covering them almost entirely, it seemed that his ears were quite a dashing shade of red.
Thank you soooo much for sticking with me and my chaotic writing! As always, very happy to read feedback, opinions or funny stories.
Did Harry almost become a ghost along with  Myrtle? Draco broke in two the tiny branch he was holding: Myrtle was sweet and a way way better friend that he ever expected from a ghost that enjoyed stalking boys while they’re having baths, but not a companion for eternity. Does he even deserve such a companion?
He would then really look at Potter, see the pain so deep inside him that Draco could crawl in there and heal and caress and soothe. Sitting back down, at the table, he would recite the made up words for the coke poem, one of the thousands of versions concocted while idly living his life these days:
And Potter would blush and ask him questions, real, proper questions about his likes and dreams and hopes and books and would listen with his head propped on one hand and his smile everlasting.
Days tend to get mushed together so easily, Draco decided. Maybe especially so for people who all they have to do is wait and wait and wait.
Oh man, another semi dialogue chapter, these are tough! I hope you enjoy it and poetry references. I am in love with everything connected to poetry and wanted to instil a bit of that in the fic too. (let me know if you would like a list or more details)
me," were the first words out of his mouth. I cast a dubious glance back at his stupid, grinning face.
Predictably, my heart raced, but suddenly a thought surfaced that I immediately had to share with him. I pulled away, still leaning over him as his eyes refocused on mine.
Since an "eighth year" really didn't exist at Hogwarts, the material was mostly a reiteration of the seventh year curriculum. Mainly, our topic of study was dark cloud constellations.
Draco was very tense. I could almost see the hairs at the base of his neck standing on end, when I realized I'd been staring. My gaze instantly dropped to my notes. I knew how prickly it felt to be stared at from behind.
Slipped from my lips unintentionally as my pace quickened slightly. I lowered myself to close the gap between our chests, burying my face in his neck. "
My laughter was submerged in another groan as I settled into him. Suddenly, an idea crossed my mind. Harry’s lingering Legillimency must’ve picked up on it, because his grimace was replaced with a look of shock.
"In your dreams," I retorted as I snatched my shirt off the floor. Realizing what I'd said, the memory of our dream resurfaced, and I paused my redressing. "We should… Do that again…" When I saw his eyebrows shoot up suggestively, I continued. "Sleep! Together, I mean… It… It was really nice."
Once the bell rang, I didn't bother waiting to see what he would do. Hermione and I were off to our next class, with Ron following behind. It was nice to be surrounded by all these familiar faces, and having shared trauma with them all slightly altered the mood between us. It was a comfort. I was just recognizing a sense of respect from them all when I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. I threw a glance over my shoulder, not knowing what to expect, but a sad, envious-looking Malfoy was not even close.
The blood that had left my face quickly flooded back into it. I buried it in my arms crossed over the back of the chair, but not before glimpsing the look on Draco's face. It was mostly surprised, but also a little… Gleeful?
Thankfully, he didn't seem to notice as he carefully extracted himself from me and went to collect our water glasses. I was still deeply lost in thought when he returned with fresh water.
"Don't fret too much. You've given me some top-shelf liquor, and I appreciate it, even though you might not."
My words were lost with an 'mmf-!' as I was once again submerged in sensation. He was pressing himself against me so hard, I had to take a few steps back to compensate. My back found the stone wall and compensation was no longer on the table. His body pressed firmly against mine as his fingers fisted in my hair.
"Thanks," I commented, taking my glass from him and propping myself up on my elbow. I hastily downed it as he sipped his own, curiously eyeing me.
In that moment, I realized truly just how alike we were. It sent me reeling a bit, but what my body decided to do was pull him into an embrace, my cheek pushing against his chest. His heart beat more loudly under my ear as I tightened my arms around him. Almost cautiously, his arms wrapped around me, as well, holding me to him.
"Guess you're right." I coughed once, and observed him silently. He was twirling his empty glass in his hands idly, and
We agreed to meet in the library during our free period to start our research right as the class ended. I finished packing up my things before he did, and suddenly hesitated as I realized I was
He reached out to take me by the collar, but another hand reached out and seized his wrist. I twisted suddenly to see Harry, having seemingly appeared out of thin air, with a disappointed sneer on his face.
Draco collapsed onto my heaving chest, also heaving. We lay there a few euphoric moments, catching our breath, before I felt his hand searching the bed again. Once he'd found what I assumed was his wand, he cleaned us up and carefully withdrew from me. We both groaned at the extraction, and sighed once he'd laid beside me. Once my wits had slightly returned, the first words on my lips were a question.
We lay there, panting and glistening, for a good several minutes before Draco finally withdrew from me with a groan and laid beside me.
Harry'd held my bandaged hand. Roughly, too, like he'd forgotten I'd been injured. I stared down at it, flexing and fisting my fingers.
This paradigm shift sent me reeling as my quill hesitated over the page. It wasn’t even quite a paradigm shift, though. I’d all but worshipped him as a child, but when I’d actually started going to school with him, he’d seemed like an arrogant prick.
With still-waking limbs, I ambled out of bed and to his bathroom mirror. Shock stained my features in my reflection as my eyes lighted on a small, red welt that had formed on the side of my neck.
made my limbs feel like jelly, but I couldn't not lean up and kiss him. It was with this movement of my body against his that I remembered we were both naked. A flush stole into my cheeks as I propped myself up on my elbow suddenly. Draco chuckled at my expression. "You keep that blush up long enough,
My own words echoed in my ears, and I winced internally, but his vulnerable expression shifted into something like compassion.
Hermione's coaching in my ear was the only thing that could break my panic. Apparently, she hadn't noticed anything and was (very formally) giving me directions.
When our kiss finally ended, we were both hot in the cheeks. With his lower lip pulled between his teeth and an indulgent smile pulling at the corners of his mouth, he backed away to sit on his bed again.
"I think you should give him at least a chance to prove himself before you go fretting about protecting him, don't you?"
My train of thought was derailed as Draco suddenly stood, facing me, and started unbuttoning his pajama top.
‘Was Riddle really all that complex?’ Draco traced his fingers over the still-healing scabs on his arm as I continued. ‘Mors means death, obviously, so if we can find an antidote for death’ My quill stilled as I realized the implications of this, but I hadn’t found the rest of the sentence before the page slipped out from beneath my hand.
I took this to mean I was doing a good job, and felt a certain satisfaction at the fact. If I could do half as much as he did for me the previous night, I'd have no regrets. His moans were increasing in pitch, though, and as they did, I was suddenly disappointed.
I’d predicted a response like ‘you’re worth it’ or ‘it’s not a chore,’ or something sappy along those lines.
Jealousy warmed my cheeks, but I realized I wasn't only jealous that he had more experience than me… I was jealous of
We were still only at the beginning of Sinistra's lecture. Hopelessness for lasting the whole lesson urged me to flee again, when Harry subtly took a deep breath, and quietly released it. I assumed he meant for me to breathe with him, so I did. The next deep breath, we took together.
This thought, unbidden in my mind, warmed my cheeks a bit more. Memories of the previous night flashed behind my eyes. The sound of Harry's first moan rang in my ears, and my vision blurred. Clearing my throat, I endeavored to focus back on the task at hand, but he'd already picked up on my mood.
Draco was relieved now that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was dead, and was secretly relieved that his father was no longer in his life. He felt some sort of justice, even, that his father was in Azkaban. Even before the Dark Lord's influence, he was a cruel, prideful, cold-hearted man. Azkaban deserved him.
"Hi yourself," I returned. We both turned to look out the window, and only familiar scenery could be seen for miles. "Well, this is a right sight better than I'd expected."
to hold my hand? As we took our seats, I stole a glance at him. He seemed… Distressed. A sudden jealousy for his skills with Legillimency washed over me. I wanted to ask him what was wrong.
Feeling quite a bit more confident, I decided to flip Draco onto his back and straddle him. The surprise on his face was obvious, but it wasn't the expression I wanted. Emulating what he'd done, I lowered myself to kiss him again before moving my lips to his cheek, his jaw, his neck.
A scoff broke on my lips automatically. I studied his expression with confusion, expecting a punchline.
I want from him? He already knew McGonagall was asking me to be nice to him, but eating dinner with him? What exactly compelled me to do this?
Once the bell tolled, we were off to Herbology. Sprout sent us all to the library again, and Harry and I were once again swimming in literature, wrapping up the loose ends of our project. As we sat compiling our notes, Harry's foot made hesitant contact with my ankle and slid up my leg. I cocked an eyebrow at him, finding he was already watching me.
I couldn't conceal the grin on my face. It took all I had to stop my legs from bouncing gleefully under my desk. He'd just made my day.
to be me. Of course, I'd suffered the most at his hand, so it wouldn't make a difference if, say, Ginny accepted him. AND, on top of that, I was in a leadership role to my peers ever since the DA days. I groaned internally at the notion that I'd forever have the label
No more than a moment after he arrived in the infirmary, his legs turned to jelly. He swayed towards an empty bed and stumbled to sit on it. His heart was pounding in his ribs as the implications of what had just happened set in.
"Come on. We'll be late for next period." He extended a hand to me, but I just stared at it warily. Harry clicked his tongue before leaning down to hoist me to my feet by my bicep. "Just… Come on."
For the second time, Harry laughed when I tried insulting him. Not a biting laugh, either. He thought I was funny? My face warmed.
"I'd say we found a way to pass the time well," He turned a grin toward me, and I grinned in response.
"That's him, he's the traitor," an older man in a conductor's uniform pointed to me before stepping aside to allow several aurors into view.
I wanted to say. My teeth shut with a click as I resisted this thought. When Draco saw I wouldn't finish that sentence, he rolled his eyes and left the shower to begin drying himself off.
