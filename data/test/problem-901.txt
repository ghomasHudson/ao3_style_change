The tournament was scheduled for mid-May and not even Draco could hide his excitement. The school was abuzz with the quidditch team’s newfound success and Draco was more popular than ever.
He was nursing his fourth martini and watching Potter from across the room. The dark-skinned seeker was wearing a set of exquisitely tailored black robes but his hair ruined the entire look, black curls sticking out every which way. It should have looked ridiculous but it didn’t. Draco was still glaring, when one of the Turtshill chasers came up behind him.
Draco read the short letter three times before the words truly sunk in. He had been disowned. It was official now, the only thing he had left was his name and it was a worthless name at that. How many of his father’s rants had been about how the Malfoy name no longer had the weight it once did? How, before, it could be used to open a number of doors but now it only shut them.
“Draco, right?” the boy asked looking up, finally catching his breath.
Draco assured her he would and the sixth-year walked away.
His teammates did their best to keep the action away from Draco so that he could focus on spotting the snitch, but already he had had to avoid two colliding players, a rogue bludger, and one very close call with a goal post. He loved every second of it.
Father spent most days drinking wine and ranting about the state of politics, the injustice of their exile. Though that had been before Mother got sick. The decline of his mother’s health had only made Father even more angry. Any mistake Draco made was especially sure to draw his ire. Draco tried to stay out of his father’s way, though sometimes Father came looking for him, those were never good days. His mother had stood up for him and protected him, but now she was gone and she wasn’t coming back.
The class only met once a week, but their hour and a half was split between lecture and practical application. Today’s lesson included making magical terrariums. The assignment was to pick a focus or effect they wished their terrarium to possess and use some pre-propagated cuttings from the conservatory to achieve their goal.
Thomas shook his head, tears streaming down his face.

“What about ballroom dance? I know they are always looking for more guys to join.” Pansy suggested.
Why had they spent weeks talking about books, and school, and nonsensical things when they could have been doing this the whole time? Asim seemed to be in agreement with Draco’s line of thinking because they spent the rest of the night snogging and the rest of the summer as well.
Draco left the front desk and headed over to the dimly lit bar.
A few nights after he finished off the healer’s potion, Draco finally got a decent night’s sleep. He had installed a white noise machine next to his bed and it seemed to help with the insomnia. Soon enough he was sleeping even better than he had when he’d been drinking.
Bulgaria and Great Britain were slotted in two different groups which meant that Draco would be facing Krum in the knockout stage once more. The other seeker was just as ruthless as ever but Draco had been studying Krum’s most recent games and Draco was faster. It wasn’t much in terms of an edge but it was something. Draco was at the top of his game. If he could keep the match from stretching out too long, like it had in Barcelona, Draco might have an actual shot.
“Now might not be a good time to tell you this, but that’s where my neighbour’s dog likes to do her business.”
“I don’t think you have moved from that spot all day.”
“Draco.”
“Like I said, obsessed.”
“Excuse me?”
The tournament itself was amazing. Draco and the team got to take the flying carriage which was equipped with the best of the best. Once they arrived at the Slavic school, Draco enjoyed his notoriety even more. Throughout the season he had started to build a reputation for himself, and now all eyes were on him as he walked down the halls. Everyone spoke in hushed voices about the sixteen-year-old seeker who had never mounted a broom until just a few months ago. He felt like a celebrity.
The only joy Draco found was in his books. As much as his father had disliked all things muggle, Draco had to admit that they had pretty good imaginations. The stories gave Draco an escape from the rundown institution and his love for reading grew tenfold. The downside was that the other boys did not share the same appreciation for literature, when they found him reading the teasing would always get worse. It was yet another sign of Draco’s breeding and intelligence, a reminder that he thought he was smarter than them. And that was true enough, in fact, Draco was smart enough to know
More knocking. Draco winced. “Monsieur Malfoy, vous êtes là?”
The first half of summer was miserable. Draco forced himself to spend time with the other students and not isolate himself, but he was beyond bored. He wrote to Pansy at least twice a week, snagging a bottle of wine and composing lyrical letters wherein he complained about how dull everything was. She seemed to appreciate his prose but his constant whinging less so.
“Hmmm.” She considered this for a bit before abruptly changing the subject, “I’m hungry. Are you hungry? I’m thinking Italian.”
The new school year began with excitement. They had graduated from the Collège and moved on to the Lycée, which meant that they got to choose their specialities. Draco had chosen Potions, Alchemy, and of course Herbology. So instead of attending Professor Dubois class only once a week, he would have three full class periods devoted to his favourite subject.
After it was all over. Draco sat alone in the locker room. Birch came in. All of the Tornadoes had come to see the match.
Pansy frowned. “Are you feeling well enough to apparate?”
“Yes of course.”
Harry stood above him still, drinking in the sight. He pulled off his own shirt and crawled into the bed with Draco. Draco ran his fingers across the muscles along Harry’s stomach as they continued to kiss.
“Your parents, how did they die? Ralph here had his burn up in a fire.
Draco raised both eyebrows. “And what would you want from me in return for such a miracle?”
It would seem that we are living in the age of the seeker. Victor Krum of the
“It’s fine.”
Draco nodded in understanding and took the glass bottle.
“Narcissa!” Lucius Malfoy’s voice echoed through the Manor as he apparated straight into the entrance hall. “Where is my wife,” he snapped at the house-elf who had appeared to greet her master.

. They won against Tanzania, Canada, and Japan. And now, there was only one match left. Only
“I don’t think so.”
As the other first-years arrived Draco watched their parents fuss over them and say their goodbyes. A few of the other boys already seemed to know each other and gathered together in the corner. One of them glanced over at Draco and said something to his friends. They all looked over and laughed. Draco snarled. It wasn’t fair. He knew how he looked with his old muggle uniform and terrible haircut, but that wasn’t him. He was supposed to be their equal, at the very least, but here he was stuck in a faded grey jumper, worn-out trousers, and not a sickle to his name.
Draco continued. “I did stop once… after my father died. I went overboard and I got myself clean. I don’t think I can do it this time though. I still had quidditch then. Now, I have nothing.”
“Potter,” Draco acknowledged.
Draco’s Halloween costume was inspired by
He had been so bored by the other boys’ talk of girls and dating that he hadn’t considered the larger threat that the girls posed. He now had twice the competition for grades. Emilie Baumé had snatched his spot away from him and Draco was determined to get it back. It wasn’t about pride or keeping his place in the social hierarchy, it was a matter of principle. Draco had worked harder than anyone else to secure his spot and he would be damned if he was going to let someone else swoop in and take it from him.
Thomas’ body seemed to contract in on itself making him seem even smaller than he already was. “Haven’t.”
By the end of the day, Draco was feeling quite frustrated and more than a bit angry. Beauxbâtons was meant to be the place where he found his equals, his peers, but he had spent the day receiving rejection after rejection. The magical community was small and he had no social clout. Most of these boys had grown up with each other but Draco was an outsider, an unknown entity. If they didn’t want to be friends with him, fine. He didn’t need them anyway, he had never had friends before and he didn’t need them now. He felt the tears welling up in his eyes and scrambled to find his wand. Draco tried to cast a silencing charm around his bed, but he couldn’t get the spell to work so he resigned himself to crying silent tears into his pillow as he drifted off to sleep.
Draco turned and saw Professor Dubois motioning him over. As he got closer, the professor bent down and pushed aside some wild shrubs to reveal a yellow and red flower. “It’s a Cypripedium, quite rare in this area, in fact only a single species still grows in Europe, the Cypripedium calceolus.”
He had until Friday to pull the pieces of himself back together. Friday night there was supposed to be a big dinner for the charity event and then on Saturday would be the actual match. All the proceeds would go to an organization that protected magical creatures.
The words set him free and Draco went straight to his rooms. It was approaching dinner time but Draco didn’t care. He slammed his bedroom door shut and let his rage overtake him. He tore books off the shelves, swept the contents of his desk to the floor, threw his toys across the room, and ripped the sheets off his bed. At the end of it all, he collapsed into a heap on the floor and screamed into his pillow.
Harry smiled as he considered the prospect but shimmed out of his pants himself. They were both nude now. Harry’s cock was average length though it appeared quite thick. Draco imagined what it would be like to go down on Harry, to have him squirming under Draco’s care - perhaps next time. Merlin, they haven’t even gotten to the main event and Draco was already sure that he definitely wanted to do this again.
“I have a match tomorrow.”
On really tough nights, Draco would floo call Harry and they would talk for hours, until Draco fell asleep by the fire listening to his voice. The first time this happened, Draco had been horrified, but Harry reassured him that he enjoyed their late-night conversations so they continued.
“April’s not coming,” Draco spoke softly. “She sent me to tell you she would have to reschedule for tomorrow.”
come. I knew what I was doing when I came out here.”
“I didn’t say you were.” Pansy turned back to Draco then, it appeared she had seen everything she needed to. “You were quite difficult to track down, you know.”
“Yes, like the dragon. Perhaps flying is in your blood?”

“Here.” She pulled out her wand but stopped herself before raising it to his face. “May I?” she asked politely.
Why would the ref invoke the advantage rule now? And then he saw it hovering right next to him was a small golden ball. Draco reached out to grab it and the whistle blew.
“Yes, bed, good idea.” Harry stood up and pulled Draco up as well. “You know, it killed me to see you flirting with Blaise all night.”
Draco signalled the bartender. “A couple more, please.”
Draco did as he was told and the other boys crowded around the plant talking about what they would do if one of them was dosed with the potion. As they left to continue the hunt for the elusive mushroom one of them turned to Draco and said, “That was really cool, thanks for showing us.”
Once everyone was seated, Professor Dubois introduced himself to the class. He had come to Beauxbâtons after finishing his thesis on the podorozhnik plant in Siberia. Draco idly imagined what it would be like to explore the expanse of mountains, rivers, and taiga that stretched across northern Russia, studying plants and writing papers. It sounded wonderful. He wondered if Professor Dubois had seen the aurora borealis while he was there, as a child Draco had always dreamed of seeing one of the auroras. Draco caught himself before his thoughts drifted too far away and focused back in on Professor Dubois as he went over the class syllabus.
“Fine. If you are just going to lie…” Draco began to walk off but stopped as an idea came to him. “Maybe I’ll just ask your mom what’s going on with you. I’m sure she’ll tell me.” It was a bluff, of course, Draco hadn’t spoken two words to Thomas’ mother, but maybe this would convince Thomas to tell Draco himself.
Draco stood up and pushed back his chair.
They were sat at different tables during the dinner but Draco caught Potter glancing in his direction more than once. While they were serving dessert Draco stepped outside to get some fresh air. He heard footsteps and turned when he heard Potter speak.
For the trip everyone dressed in their school-issued windbreakers and their own trainers. Draco only had the black dress shoes that paired with his uniform, so he had to transfigure his old shoes from l'Internat into a workable pair of trainers. They pinched his feet a little at the end, but it was nothing too painful.
Harry laughed. “
After losing to the
After half an hour with no sign of the snitch Potter drifted over towards him.
“First rule, as long as you’re training with me no booze, no drugs. Not even a glass of wine at the end of the day.”
Harry eased into Draco slowly, stopping just a bit short of bottoming out. He then gave a quick thrust, filling Draco completely. Harry kept the momentum going, doing his best to hit Draco’s prostate each time.
“That doesn’t count. Those were just seekers games.” Harry paused. “People think that all the seeker has to worry about is getting the snitch, but that’s not true. There are so many things going on at any given moment during a quidditch game. A truly great seeker always has the bigger picture in mind whenever they’re on the pitch. I always get too absorbed in looking for the snitch, but you… I am pretty sure you know exactly what the other players are going to do before they do.”
“I’ve never actually been flying, so I'll just have to take your word for it.”
The days were lonely but Draco did his best to keep himself occupied. He got back on a broom for the first time since the tournament. It felt good to relax and let his instincts take over. The Var was extremely beautiful in its isolation and Draco would go on leisurely flights along the Verdon river, stopping to examine the plants and take in the landscape.
Draco began to scan the crowd for Harry. The skybox where he had been watching the game was bereft of the telltale messy black hair.
“Yes, yes, I live for the drama, now are we going to spend all day talking or are we going to fly?”
Sixth-year flew by and Draco felt like he was on top of the world. He held his place as number one in the class and in quidditch he continued to win game after game, caring the team into the final playoffs.
“If you could set one of these at every workstation that’d be great.” The professor smiled again and handed Draco the box.
He determined quickly that his teammates were just like his “friends” from school, that is to say boring, unoriginal, and dull. Draco didn’t bother wasting his time beyond basic pleasantries. He was the reason they were winning and that was more than enough to make him popular. He even gained a few fans. They screamed his name from the stands and begged him for autographs.
Potter shrugged but didn’t say anything.
After a while, Harry got up and Draco whimpered at the loss of heat. He felt too content and too tired to move much himself. A minute or two later Harry returned carrying both their wands. He kissed Draco, once more. This one was chaste and almost sweet, then he cast a quick cleaning spell at Draco. Draco vowed to teach Harry a better one later that wouldn’t leave his skin feeling so dry.
Draco turned away from the reflection and headed for the door. He wanted to cry. He wanted to scream. Every fibre of his being fought to hold it all back. As he rounded the corner of the hallway he collided face-first into the person he least wanted to see. What the fuck was Potter doing here? He should be out on the field celebrating his win. Though Draco supposed this victory was hardly special in Potter’s mind.
It was a hungry, desperate kiss and Draco gave as good as he got. After a moment they broke apart to breathe.
After his fitting for his first bespoke suit, Draco knew he would never be able to go back.
“I don’t know the first thing about quidditch,” Draco quickly interjected.
Harry’s eyes widened. “Holy shit!”
the reigning champion, and he defeated You-Know-Who while you were both still in nappies.”
“I need to be alone.”
Potter ignored him. “I’ve been watching your games and you’re better than me. Your instincts have always been spot on. I might have faster reflexes and more speed but that sort of thing comes with training, experience. It is only a matter of time before you beat me.”
Sinking down into the cushions of the couch, Draco poured himself a glass of the hard stuff and he drank until the room started to spin. He stopped long enough to puke into a potted plant then went back to the wine.
What?
She stirred the cauldron once more before moving over to the window to inspect a few plants. After she found what she was looking for she added it to the cauldron and stirred it a few more times.
“I’m ready for you. Harry, please,” Draco whined.

“Hungover, then.”

“What symptoms have you had, besides the anxiety and tremors.”
“I’m Louis. Why don’t you play quidditch? You’re an amazing flyer!”
This year’s knockout was hosted by Spain. The top eight teams in Europe competing for the championship title.
Harry laughed. “Of course you did.”
“What’s that?” Pansy asked as if she hadn’t planned this since the moment Draco had opened his door.
Julien’s were in some sort of car accident. Mine OD’d on heroin, accidental poisoning they called it,” the boy paused, “Or did yours just not want you anymore? Daniel’s here because his parents had too many mouths to feed.”
The witch continued looking at Draco.
“I’m not dramatic. And next year I’ll hardly have time for quidditch. In case you didn’t realize, next year we will be sixth-years and we’ll have the
“Draco, what are you doing?”
“The first time you rode a broom you were sixteen? Really?”
He found himself wandering through the gardens and reflecting on what else he could do to get a leg up. He already spent twice as much time revising as any of his other classmates. What more could he do?
“I wasn’t even doing anything! It launched itself at me out of nowhere and I swear, it was trying to gouge out my eyes.”
“I should have you fired right now. Disappearing for days and then showing up to a league match completely hungover. Consider this your first and only warning. You miss another practice or I see any signs that you have been drinking and you’re gone. Am I clear?”
Harry didn’t respond. Instead, he grabbed a vanishing bag and started picking up the trash.
Draco raised his eyebrows when Blaise stopped.
. Right. The only talent I have is making others believe I have worth. It’s just an act, all of it. In school, I tricked everyone into thinking I was naturally smart and gifted. And now, now I have everyone believing I’m some kind of quidditch prodigy. I’m not. I almost lost that game against Portugal,” Draco laughed as realization dawned on him, “and tomorrow Krum is going to beat me again. I’m fast, so what? Krum is ruthless. He is going to decimate me on that pitch and I’m just as much of a fool as the rest of them for believing I ever stood a chance.”
“It wasn’t an orphanage. Just a boarding school for young boys in Leon. My father and I were never particularly fond of each other.”
It rained on the day of the final match, but it had been decided that the weather was mild enough that the game should continue as scheduled.
The sincerity in Harry’s voice broke something inside of him and the anger dissipated leaving Draco completely empty. “I know.”
Draco landed and before he even knew what he was doing his arms were around Harry. Draco awkwardly disentangled from the hug as the others reached the ground. He couldn’t stop smiling though and Harry looked just as happy as Draco felt.
Draco’s obsessive routine paid off and the Tornados winning streak resumed. They made it to December without any more losses and there was only one team left on their roster that they had yet to play, Puddlemere United. But Draco was ready. Draco would beat Potter then he would do what Potter couldn’t, he would defeat Victor Krum.
The look Asim gave Draco made him blush and turn away.
“Surely you can do better than the Chudley Cannons.”
Draco raised his glass and contorted his face in a mocking smile.
“Excellent.” Blaise smiled and waved the bartender over, ordering Draco an old fashioned. They talked about France and Paris. Blaise told Draco about his favourite places to shop in town and Draco talked about some of the lesser-known gems France had to offer.
“Of course,” Draco tried not to smile.

“Not well, but I think I got a few hours.”
It was a sunny day, which privately Draco thought was all wrong. In the books he read it always rained at funerals. He picked at a loose thread on his sleeve which drew his father’s disapproving gaze. He stopped immediately and corrected his posture. With his mother gone there would be no one to curb his father’s temper.
Harry shoved him over anyways and wrapped himself around Draco. Draco was feeling much too pliant to put up much of a fight.
“Have you considered that might be intentional?”
“Yes.”
“No, me either. How about this? In public, we’re friends, good friends. And then when it’s just the two of us we’re more than that.”
She nodded and mounted her broom. Draco followed her into the air.
“If you stare any harder Draco, I think you might burn a hole in his head.”
Pansy had a smug look on her face.
“Okay. Good. We should probably start by getting you out of that den of depression.”
Harry began to stroke his fingers along Draco’s arms, pressing kisses wherever he saw a beauty mark decorating the soft skin. Then he moved on to Draco’s thighs working his way down but skipping completely over the area that Draco felt needed the most attention. Once he got to his feet, Harry tapped Draco lightly on the side indicating that he should flip over.
He couldn’t meet Dubois, not like this. The owl lingered on the window sill waiting for a response. Draco scribbled a quick note to tell Dubois that he wasn’t available today, but that if he was still in town tomorrow Draco would love to have him over for afternoon tea.
“Seriously Pansy. You’ve done more than enough.”
“Why have you been avoiding me?”
Those words made Draco perk up a little. He did enjoy collecting favours and this would be an entire quidditch team worth of favours. Plus it would mean more flying, already Draco was eager to climb back on a broom. Draco made up his mind then that he would do it, but he wanted to really drag it out.
After several days of this Draco decided he’d had enough. He tracked Thomas down and confronted him.
The rest of 1995 wasn’t half bad. Pansy had come out in full support of Draco and Asim’s relationship, going so far as to say that she was proud Draco was finally spreading his wings. Even with Professor Dubois gone, Draco still found Herbology to be his favourite class. For once in his life, he was happy. He was doing well in school, he was popular, he had a best friend, and a boyfriend. What else could he ask for?
“Draco.”
“You don’t want to be like me. You already have so much more than I do. Something that I will never have.”
Draco bent over to take a closer look. It was an ugly-looking orchid with dark twisted petals.
Draco sat up and stared at Harry incredulously.
Draco took a seat next to Asim on the bench.
Draco didn’t linger at any of the shops, there was no point in looking at things he couldn’t afford, instead he went straight to the portkey point. The first-year’s portkey was scheduled for nine o’clock so he had a little while to wait.
“Sure right now you are, but I hardly ever see you. You’re always locked away in your dorm with those stupid books.”
Asim laughed. “Of course. I am sure you found Dany to be extremely relatable - mysterious, attractive, blonde.”
“Yes, he was an excellent father. Cassiopeia turns eight this September and Eltanin will be six next month. I don’t know how I am going to do it without Lucius.”
“You love books.” Asim teased.
“Umm,” Draco wasn’t quite sure what was going on, “this is Pansy Parkins.”
He had been right about his assumption that his teammates were actually friends, the motley crew spent time together outside of practice, and Draco had never had so many real friends in his life. Draco had been relieved to learn that none of them were Gryffindors. Out of all of them only April, Harrison, Cole and Macie had spent any time at Hogwarts and April and Harrison had both been transfers.
It would be ok. He was going to get through this. As long as magic ran through his veins Draco could get through anything.
“I thought Mr Moore just bought the team this year.”
He made his way over to the seeker’s locker to put away his stuff before one of the guys approached him. He was sporting a mohawk and from the build of him, he was one of the beaters - either Harrison or Cole. Draco braced himself for the encounter not really knowing what to expect.
They went to the dorms next, and Mr Barker showed Draco where he would sleep. All the boys lived on the third floor and were housed four to a room. The space was clean and utilitarian. It was large enough to fit two bunk beds with a chest of drawers at the foot of each and four small desks along the walls. A window in the centre of the room kept the space from feeling claustrophobic. Draco noted there were no locks on any of the drawers or on the bedroom door itself. No matter, it wasn’t as if Draco had brought anything of value anyways. Just a few basic clothes, some books, his journal, and a photograph of his mother that Tibby had spelled still. He had to leave his more magical possessions at home.
Draco padded across the room and sat down in the uncomfortable chair next to his father. He felt quite small and insignificant as his feet barely reached the ground. Seconds passed while Draco waited for his father to speak.
“What are you talking about?”
“Draco! Well would you look at you, you’re all grown up.”
But Harry remained convinced that Draco would win and he
“Thanks, you too,” Draco replied politely.
“Never thought I would fall for a feint like that,” Potter said as he took a sip of his beer.
ever since that article came out in
The next moment happened so fast Draco didn’t even have time to react before the other boy’s fist made contact with his face. Draco stared at him, mouth open in surprise.
“Of course, what do you need?”
“I could have been stone-cold sober. It wouldn’t have made the slightest difference.”
“You think you're better than us?”
Either way, Draco had nothing to do with Dark Lords or Death Eaters and it didn’t seem to be an issue.
Draco went out to grab some lunch and the tea for Dubois, returning just in time to greet his old professor at the door.
would have nothing to do with it.
The next day at lunch Pansy slid into the spot next to Draco like it was a completely normal thing to do.
“Ok.”
“So that’s a yes then. Does he know?”
He showed up to the event in relatively good shape, at least considering the state he had been in just over a week ago. Draco had purposefully avoided looking at the details of the match. He knew that the teams would be comprised of popular players from the league, which logically meant that Potter was the most likely candidate for the other team’s seeker but that was the exact thing Draco had been trying not to think about.
Though Draco wasn’t upset about it, he reflexively put on a pouty face and scoffed because he knew that’s what Potter expected him to do. “Weren’t you?”
Draco made small talk with the two of them and learned that Ginny had signed a contract for the upcoming season to play for the
Draco stormed out of the room. Asim would realize his mistake soon enough and come after him.
Draco groaned. Harry wasn’t kidding about the warm-up, after the four-mile run they did strength training. Harry had Draco doing so many push-ups and sit-ups and planks that Draco thought he was going to puke. Once he recovered enough to stand, they took a break for lunch - chicken breast with salad and a tall glass of water.
“I’m sorry Draco,” Pansy said still holding him. “I should have come sooner. I knew-- I should have come sooner.”
Third year Draco finally got to see his hard work pay off and the other boys started to include him in things. Instead of lunching alone in the gardens, Draco now sat in the dining chamber with his classmates. He even stopped his study sessions in Professor Dubois’ office, opting instead to join the study group in the library.
A shiver ran through his body as Harry applied the cold lube to Draco’s outer rim. His finger circled the puckered skin before pushing its way inside. Draco adjusted to it quickly. “Another one Harry. I can take it.”
“Fuck yes.”
“I am.”
Draco was playing well. He had found a groove and stuck with it and the UK National Team rose in the ranks, taking first in their group.
A second was all Daniels needed to beat him to the snitch.
Draco was conscious enough to warn Xavier when he was close and Xavier pulled off with a pop. He replaced his mouth with his other hand and it didn’t take long for Draco to climax. When he came back to himself he realized Xavier was spent as well, both of them were flushed and panting.
“You know my dad drank. He wasn’t mean or anything. He just got quiet and fell asleep in his clothes.”
The new season started with Elliot Fisher as Puddlemere’s first string seeker. The papers speculated about Potter’s sudden withdrawal siting everything from injury to secret love child. Even Draco’s teammates gossiped about the prodigy seeker. Draco did his best to tune it all out.
The one aspect of the Lycée that Draco was dreading was the integrated classes. Draco’s classmates had become increasingly girl obsessed, and even in the Collège it seemed half their conversations revolved around the subject. Draco shuttered to think how much worse it would get now that there were actual girls to talk about.
Beauxbâtons had won.
“Yes, Draco, come sit.”
“Very good. I’ve studied his games in the group stage and I don’t believe Mr Krum is as unbeatable as he appears.” Draco didn’t look to see how Krum reacted to that statement and the reporters moved on.
The night before the match, the team went out for an early dinner together. And for a change of pace, Draco decided to join them. Their energy was contagious and Draco was surprised to discover that he was actually excited for tomorrow and not a bundle of nerves.
“You shouldn’t have gone for the feint,” Potter blurted out. Draco turned to face him again. “In your game with Montrose.”
“That was wicked Draco!” Jeneen, a beater, said as he approached.
They ended up eating dinner together too, mostly because Draco wasn’t sure he had the energy to find his own dinner. Instead of quidditch, the dinner conversation shifted over to other topics. Harry talked about his godfather Sirius Black and Sirius’ partner, Remus Lupin, who had raised Harry after his third year in school. That started turning the gears in Draco’s head, if Harry’s guardians were gay that might explain why he had been so comfortable with the idea of sex with Draco the other night. As the conversation continued, Draco told Harry about the latest book he was reading. Harry wasn’t much of a reader himself but he listened attentively as Draco talked about a plot involving unrequited love, not fitting in, and spiders.
She had grown her hair out since the last time he’d seen her and was wearing an expensive tailored dress beneath her robes. Draco wondered how she had managed to walk through the snow in those heels. While Draco was still busy processing this development, Pansy pushed her way into the house as if she owned the place. She began looking around at the trash and liquor bottles that decorated every surface.
Beauxbâtons also got its fair share of talk. The has-been team was a threat once more and they had a real shot at taking home the gold.
at least three times.”
His heart was still racing and the adrenaline pumping through his body when he noticed another student running towards him. Shit, had he broken some kind of rule? Maybe he was supposed to ask someone before taking one of the brooms? Well whatever it was Draco could talk his way out of it. He braced himself for the encounter.
Draco’s orgasm hit first. Cum sprayed across his chest and his ass clenched up as Draco surrendered himself to the waves of pleasure. A moment later he felt Harry’s own orgasm hit as he filled up inside. Draco closed his eyes and let himself just exist in the moment.
I recently had the opportunity to meet the rookie seeker and see for myself if the rumours were true, and I must say I was more than a bit disappointed. Malfoy is too inexperienced to pose much of a threat to anyone, and his obsession with perfection and control may ultimately be his downfall. He seems much too rigid to have any hope of adapting to Potter’s innovative plays and his preoccupation with getting everything just right might actually keep him stagnate as a player, afraid to make any bold moves lest he makes a mistake.
He ignored the other boys, he would have to make up for it later, but at the moment there was nothing he could do. It was almost time for the portkey anyway. They got into position surrounding the large hoop that would take them to Beauxbâtons. Draco looked around at the other boys in his group and saw a mix of nervousness, confidence, and excitement. He steeled his own expression as to not give away his inner thoughts so plainly. As the portkey activated, he felt an uncomfortable tug in his gut and then the world exploded in a whirlwind of commotion.
Lucius pushed past the elf and set off at a brisk pace. With a wave of nonverbal magic the nursery door violently swung open. Narcissa looked up from her place beside the crib with surprise and Draco began to cry. Narcissa stood and clutched her son to her chest in an attempt to comfort him. Lucius muttered a quick
“That’s the problem. I can’t afford anywhere right now. I have never been much of a saver. Most of the money I had went to the clothes and makeup and booze.”
was what he had been waiting for the last three years. He knew better than to let the other boys see the letter, so he quickly tucked it into the back of his book. He would have to wait till the end of classes before he could read it.
Draco shot ramrod straight.
“What the fuck Malfoy! Where have you been?”
“Third and final rule, call me Harry.”
He spoke softly yet firmly and a white light emerged from the tip without any struggle. Draco smiled and flopped down amongst the soft sheets of his bed. He was finally home.
Draco flew up beside Dorian, one of the beaters and team captain.
“You’re not.” Harry took a step closer and Draco took a step back.
“Come in.”
Draco managed to get a few hours of sleep before he heard Pansy moving around in the living room. He groaned as he got out of bed. His headache had somehow gotten worse. He brushed his teeth and washed his face before making his way out of his room.
“Right! Listen, I am just going to get right into it. I was talking it over with the others yesterday and we’d like to offer you a place on the L'Équipe du Feu, as the seeker.
, you’re not my friend and you are certainly not my father and actually, I think perhaps it’s time for you to leave.”
“Well? What is it?” Pansy asked.
Mental Health Resources:
Draco shook his head. “You know, they say I am only here because Potter dropped out and they’re right.”
He continued to petulantly poke at his food, while Pansy turned her attention to her copy of
Draco sputtered, “Sorry?”
Draco had got rid of all his pills the night he had slept with Potter. All of his pills except for the small pack he kept in his travel kit. He chased the pills down with a bottle of vodka from the minibar and quickly got dressed. He paused at the door and cast a cleaning charm that he hoped would hide the worst of his hangover.
“Yes Draco, you have uncovered my dastardly plan - to kill you with exercise and healthy food.” Harry deadpanned right back.
Draco handed Pansy the letter. She snorted.
Draco glanced at her out of the side of his eye, before finally turning to face her head-on. He gave her a look he hoped conveyed ‘
And so Draco decided to make a conscious effort, not because Pansy had told him so, but because there were still many weeks left before school started up again and Draco would go insane if things carried on this way.
Harry contorted himself to reach into his bedside table. He pulled out a glass vile and shuffled back over to Draco. He tried unlacing Draco’s trousers but kept fumbling it. “What do wizards have against zippers anyway,” he pouted.
The article came out the next day and it had Draco fuming.
With exams over, everyone was preparing for the break. It looked like it was going to be another long summer of studying and revisions for Draco. He didn’t know if Thomas would be coming back this year and Professor Dubois was spending the summer break in Serbia. He was starting research on his new book and had left Draco in charge of looking after some of the more mundane plants while he was away. Draco was on his way to the conservatory now, to do some pruning and watering when another student called out to him, wishing him a happy summer. Draco blinked, then a small smile spread across his face. That was new.
Eventually, Draco dragged himself home and rinsed off in the shower. He was already fast asleep by the time the clock struck ten.
Thomas took to it immediately and loved assisting Draco with his chores. Sometimes he even hung out with Draco when he was studying. Draco would pick out a book for him to read - always a simple subject that didn’t require a magic core like herbology, potions, or astronomy - and they would read together in silence before Thomas eventually got antsy and they would go out to play.
Wimbourne if you ever pulled shit like this again you would be gone. You have a problem Draco.”
Draco cut her off, “All of the professors like me. I am the perfect student - well most of the time. But it doesn’t matter how many extensions I get, there is no way for me to catch up on all the work I missed.”
It wasn’t that Draco
and we had to improvise.”
The entire day he was unbelievably focused. Classes rushed by and Draco could recall all the material with extreme clarity. The second best thing to a time-turner indeed.
“You know it is ok to be scared. He
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco quickly switched to washing his hands, his eyes darting automatically to the intruder’s reflection in the mirror. What he had not expected to see was a girl confidently walking to one of the stalls. Draco panicked. Had he gone to the girl’s bathroom by accident? Impossible. It was in the entirely opposite direction. Maybe this girl had been hit with a
“And you think I’ll make the national team over you?”
Draco had not planned on following through with Pansy’s suggestion, but the next day he found himself walking past the quidditch shed and he had nothing else to do. If he took out one of the brooms now, he’d be able to tell Pansy and stop her nagging before it had truly begun.
“One game,” Potter agreed with a smile.
“It’s not the same thing,” Harry insisted.
“What’s the plan?” He asked.
“Hi Malfoy.”
“That was actually my first time on a broom.”
Harry swung Draco around and started kissing him frantically. Draco let Harry steer him backwards through the door frame and towards the bed. With the attention Harry was giving to a particular spot along his neck, Draco knew there would be a mark.
Draco cast a listening charm and tried to make out what they were saying. He was only six months into his Russian lessons but he was able to understand the gist of the conversation. They were talking about him, discussing his playing style and potential weaknesses. He supposed he should be flattered that he was worth discussing.
“Why didn’t you say hello?”
and flew off to the other side of the pitch. Potter, undeterred, followed him and stuck close to his side rambling on and on. Draco tuned him out completely.
Draco looked at the other boys, muggles. Did they really think Draco was the same as them? No matter how far Draco had fallen - his name, intelligence, and magical ability placed him heads and shoulders above these children. He had made it this far in life without any friends. He certainly wasn’t about to resort to allying himself with these plebeians and their dirty blood.
“Are we-- Are you my boyfriend?”
“I saw your game against Krum. It was brutal to watch, must have been hell.”
Draco was able to complete six hours of work in the span of one. Maybe that number one spot wasn’t so far out of reach after all.
Birch was surely pissed already so it was in Draco’s best interest to just stay away until the match against Wimbourne. If Draco played it right he wouldn’t have to confront the captain until after the match and Birch would be much more agreeable after a win.
Draco agreed and followed Xavier into an empty classroom. As soon as the door shut they were on each other. They were both more than a bit drunk and the whole thing was very sloppy, but for some reason that only made it hotter.
“Draco, I--”
Draco took a deep breath and tried to calm himself down, there was no use getting worked up over things that hadn’t happened yet. “Thank you, Tibby. I’ll go to see him now.”
, so we started a summoning ritual. We were in the middle of the incantation when the Aurors finally arrived.”
“Not unless you promise to stop cleaning.”
“You see, Draco understands. Êtes-vous un connaisseur de la cuisine française?” Blaise addressed his question to Draco.
“Well, then they lied. I’ve never heard of a pureblood squib before so they have to be lying.”
Draco raised an eyebrow.
Fuck him. It hadn’t mattered how hard Draco had worked or how good he was, Potter was better and now Draco had undeniable proof. He thought back to his early days at Beauxbâtons, how hard he had to try. Quidditch was supposed to be different. He was supposed to excel, the prodigy seeker from France. And he did, he was, but it still wasn’t enough. He wasn’t the best. He was never going to be the best.
“I’m fine.”
. Draco smiled, not even the sight of his father’s name could ruin his mood. He flipped the envelope over, on the other side was an ornate golden wax seal - the letter “B” intricately designed. He opened the envelope carefully and removed the parchment inside.
Potter’s face broke out into a grin and Draco realized he was being teased. He let out a harsh
After that, Draco got his shit together. He didn’t stop drinking or taking his daily pill but he kept it under control, enough to hide it from his team. They finished out the season strong coming in second to Puddlemere, which automatically qualified them for that year’s International Quidditch Tournament.
“Fifteen.”
“Ok...”
Draco quoted his favourate passage, “В конце концов, было бы логично сдаться, и я бы сдался, если бы работал для кого-то, но в мире нет ни одного человека, который мог бы говорить на моем языке… (V kontse kontsov, bylo by logichno sdat'sya, i ya by sdalsya, yesli by rabotal dlya kogo-to, no v mire net ni odnogo cheloveka, kotoryy mog by govorit' na moyem yazyke…)”
Draco still didn’t know what to do, but he found himself heading in the direction of the library automatically. Maybe he could find some answers there. There had to be books about squibs in the library. Thomas was a pureblood so surely there had to be something there that could help. Draco quickened his pace.
Draco yanked his hand away and picked up the letter. The bird pecked at him once more, looking for some treats but Draco just shooed it away.
Draco’s wand shot out of his hand and Harry caught it.
Raynham cleared his throat from behind Draco. It was time to go.
“I still can’t believe I let myself get blindsided by the bludger, though. I’ll be beating myself up about that for a while.”
Draco moved to mount his broom.
Mr Barker was a short, brown-haired man dressed in plain slacks and a cable knit cardigan, a no-nonsense sort of man. The ride to the school was practically silent which suited Draco just fine. As they approached the campus gates the reality of the situation washed over Draco. A large grey concrete wall surrounded the property and behind the rusty blue gate was a drab, institutional building. l'Internat Adolphe Favre was painted in miss-matched colours of pale pink, golden tan, and greyish beige. The trees looked dead in the cold winter air. It was a joyless space where the world seemed to be just a little more muted.
He looked up at Draco for permission. Draco knew his own eyes were blown wide but he kept the rest of his face composed. Draco and Asim had never gone further than some heavy petting, and Draco wanted this. He unzipped his trousers and pulled down his pants giving Xavier full access.
“You are so hot like this,” he breathed in Draco’s ear before kissing his way down his neck. Then hands replaced lips travelling down Draco’s shoulders and chest as Xavier continued his way downward until he was on his knees.
“Do you mind if I sit?” Draco asked politely.
“Alright, ok, here’s what we’ll do then, you will continue staying with me for now, we’ll go through your things and figure out what we can get some money for that way you can get yourself some spending money, and then we’ll take some time to figure out what it is you want to do whether that’s go back to school or get a mastery or work as a clerk at Flourish and Blotts.” Pansy smiled. “There is no rush to figure it all out, Draco. We have time.”
Harrison (or Cole) laughed. “Disappoint? We’re glad to have you! I know you didn’t pay us much attention when you were with the Tornados.”
But Draco didn’t want to hear Dubois’ reasons for going, so he got up, left, and didn’t look back.
They made small talk for a bit, though Sébastien didn’t seem too interested in Draco, and when his friends came down Draco found himself alone once more. No matter, he would find someone else to be his friend. He attempted to talk with a few of the other boys but found that he couldn’t keep up with the conversations. They spoke about books he had never read, sports he had never seen, and games he had never played. A couple of the muggle-borns tried talking with him, but he found the conversations to be dull as they only wanted to talk about how amazing magic was, and did you know that there were flying horses, and do you think dragons really exist, and on and on.
Draco was snapped out of his thoughts about Harry when someone pulled up beside him on their broom, it was April, one of the chasers. “So what’s the story with you and Potter?”
The boy hadn’t noticed Draco at first, too wrapped up in his world of make-believe, when he did finally register another presence his eyes grew wide.
Maybe this chance with the Falcons was just what he needed. His whole life Draco had focused on becoming number one so that everyone would appreciate him. But maybe that had been the wrong approach. People would think whatever they wanted to think. And, miraculously, it made no difference to Draco. He was tired of wasting all his energy pleasing other people. Draco could count on one hand the only people whose opinions he actually cared about and at the top of the new list was himself.
Pansy turned to Draco then and hugged him. He froze when she touched him, feeling strange. This was the first time anyone had touched him since… well it had been a while. He relaxed into the hug and squeezed her back.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, I guess we will find out. Won’t we.”
that uses Boswellia as the central ingredient and so I figured it fit the theme.”
Draco became a regular at Dubois’ office hours, at first he would make up questions to ask but eventually the façade became unnecessary. Instead, Draco would just go to Dubois’ office to study while Dubois graded papers. Draco would also help Dubois after class as part of his work-study and they spent many hours together in the conservatory and the gardens. It was nice having someone to talk to again, and Dubois would often show Draco interesting articles or pull books that he thought Draco would enjoy.
Draco was beginning to accept that was something he was never going to have. The friendships that he had seen depicted in his books must be something extremely rare, that is if it existed at all. Instead of developing true friendships, it seemed that most people just pantomimed the idea of “friendship” with each other to give the appearance that they were not alone.
“I’m fine,” Draco replied.
That night Pansy did in fact show up and in addition to the new cosmetic charms she taught him, she also brought along some creams and potions for his skin and hair. They spent some time discussing their different beauty routines and Draco taught Pansy the charm he used to keep his fingernails perfectly manicured.
Draco couldn’t quite place the tone of Harry’s voice. He sounded almost… upset.
There was nothing else for it. Draco just needed to try harder, be better. He would spend the whole summer working towards his goal. He had no other option.
He missed Thomas more than anything. But even Draco’s friendship with Thomas wasn’t the kind of relationship he craved. He had always felt more like an older brother, it was his job to give advice and protect him. Draco had never felt comfortable confiding in Thomas, he didn’t want to burden the younger boy with his own problems. And that was what he truly wanted, a confidant, someone who would understand him wholly and completely.
Draco avoided the bird’s beak as he handed him the letter and when the owl had flown away Draco turned to survey the mess. He could do this.
When the semester’s ranks were posted in November, Draco was shocked to find that for the first time since arriving at Beauxbâtons his rank had dropped. He had gone from number one to number two and he chastised himself for overlooking one critical thing.
“Shove over,” Harry said.
“Pansy? What are you doing here?” Draco asked finally regaining his faculties and closing the door.
And so Draco found himself spending the night with Harry for the very first time. Harry was a quiet sleeper. He curled up into a ball and took up as little space as possible. Draco wanted to press his face into Harry’s back and wrap his arms around his waist, but he wasn’t that bold. So instead he settled for listening to Harry’s breathing and when he thought the other man had fallen asleep he risked brushing his feet up against Harry’s legs. He drifted off with that single point of touch as his anchor.
“You speak Russian?” Harry asked, surprised.
Fall turned to winter, and winter to spring. Draco watched from the sidelines as the other boys spent time with their friends, played games, and developed inside jokes. But that was fine, Draco didn’t have time for friends anyway. He was too busy with school, and once he was number one they would all be begging to be his friend.
Draco left Potter to get ready for the match, the other man’s words running through his head. Did Potter really think Draco was a better seeker than him? Draco shook his head. It was probably best not to think about it for now, after all he had a game to play.
Finally, Pansy decided it was time for Draco to snap out of it. She stormed into Draco’s room in a fury.
After a few months, he was able to concentrate his magic in his chest. He could only manifest a small amount before it began to dissipate, so he focused on growing it and channelling it through his body. Once he got the hang of that he began to project his thoughts on what he wanted to happen.
Once he was dismissed, he would join the house-elves for dinner. He enjoyed his time with Tibby, Melrose, and Raynham. Even when his mother had been alive they were his only friends and now that she was gone they were all that he had left. His father expressed his disapproval when he noticed Draco’s familiarity with the elves, but on this matter Draco disagreed. They may be humble creatures but they were powerful in their magic and kind in their hearts.
“And the doctors told Cole,” making this Harison, Draco thought, “that he would never walk again after he took that bludger to his knee and tore three ligaments, but here he is.”
Draco burst into a fit of laughter at the image of Asim wrestling with a small twig. He expected Asim to get defensive, but instead the other boy was watching Draco with a look in his eye that Draco couldn’t quite place.
“Thank you so much Draco! You’re a lifesaver.”
“I knew you could do it!” Harry exclaimed. “I am so proud of you Draco.”
Draco was at a loss for how to handle a pleading child so he gave in. Thomas found Draco another branch to use as a sword and started describing some elaborate scenario with captured princesses, furry alien creatures, and spaceships that could blow up planets. Draco followed the other boy’s lead having no idea what was going on. They played together for an hour before Thomas ran off to find his mom, leaving a very confused Draco holding a wood branch alone in the gardens.
She cut him a sharp look but Draco held his ground and stared right back. If that was all it took to throw him off, he would have withered away ages ago.
By the end of October, he was finally able to do it. It wasn’t consistent and the results were unpredictable, but that was typical of juvenile magic and it didn’t stop Draco from using it at every opportunity. He made his sheets softer, his jackets warmer, vanished away spills and stains, anything that he could get away with. He couldn’t fix the larger problems in his life, but Draco could take pleasure in the small victories.
The Falcon’s lost the first game of the season, but oddly enough it didn’t bother Draco. The Harpies had played a good game and their seeker had taken advantage of a gap Draco had left open. He wouldn’t make that mistake again, and hopefully they would win the next game. The truth was Draco was actually looking forward to discussing the game with Harry. They would talk about strategies and possible plays and training exercises, and Draco couldn’t think of a better way to spend the afternoon.
, Draco told himself,
He opened the package at once, inside was a miniature cake decorated with flowers from his mother’s garden. There was a note as well,
Was Potter bloody insane? He just offered to help a rival seeker. Draco might have thought it was a trick except for the earnest look in Potter’s eyes. He could be faking it but Draco’s instincts told him he wasn’t, he was just that naive.
He grabbed onto Draco hand and lead them towards the locker rooms. “You’re on.”
- serves anyone, in any type of crisis, connecting them with a crisis counselor who can provide support and information
And so, a few minutes later, Draco found himself hovering ten feet above the ground. He was a bit unsteady at first, but he quickly got the hang of things and soon he was sweeping through the air. He grew more and more confident and began to pick up speed.
It had been easy enough to pick his two specialities for graduation: Potions and Herbology. Sixth-year classes were notoriously difficult and Draco knew that he would have to balance school with quidditch from now on, but there was no doubt in his mind that he was up to the task.
“Thank you for coming. Did you know Lucius well?”
“It’s just a ball. And it was flying that I fell in love with.”
The crowd was deafening and the light too bright. Draco felt awful.
“So what are you reading now?” Draco asked timidly.
“Well, I--”
The whistle blew and a timeout was called. A medi-witch came out to check on him. Draco winced as she popped his dislocated shoulder back into place and cast a few healing spells. Coach Kern came up beside them.
“I’m sorry. I overslept.”
Draco followed him and began to ramble about the letter, and the World Cup, and Victor Krum.
Harry pushed himself up so that he was resting against the headboard. “It’s just not fun anymore… well, except when I am playing with you. But the rest of the time I just feel like I’m going through the motions.”
This year had been one of the best so far and Draco thought it could only get better from here. He had Pansy now and Professor Dubois, and his specified classes were all extremely interesting.
“Semantic bastard,” Draco muttered as Harry began to press kisses along his jaw.
Draco blushed. Were he and Harry really that obvious? First Blaise and now April? “We were friends until I went and fucked it up,” Draco admitted. “I tried to make sure that he would never want to speak to me again.”
Pansy apparated away and Draco cleaned up again. He wandered around the rest of the flat. He hadn’t taken much of it in last night. It was very nice. An exposed brick wall took up one half of the living room. There was also a fireplace that Draco assumed was hooked up to the floo network. The ceiling reached up to the second floor and a large skylight looked up to a canopy of trees. A set of art deco windows looked out onto a shared terrace. Upstairs was Pansy’s room and the guest room that Draco now occupied.
Draco shook his head.
“A common misconception, but actually OCD and OCPD are two very distinct things. You must have had a lot of pressure on you as a child, and well, prodigy and psychosis often go hand in hand.
An hour later Draco was trying to wrap his head around the fact that he was eating bolognese across from Pansy Parkinson. She had ordered food for them both, as well as a pitcher of water for the table. She hadn’t brought up the drinking or the drugs. Instead she talked about herself, what she had been up to since graduation. Draco felt as if there was a haze around him, but he listened. She was a paralegal at a law firm, and it seemed to be a successful one at that. She split her time between London and Paris, had a high-powered boyfriend who was into finance, and a cat named Coco.
is Fincher? Is this why you offered to train me?” Draco thought for a moment. “It is, isn’t it? So that I can take up your mantle against Krum, fuck… That’s why you were so sure that I’m going to make the national team...” Draco trailed off before declaring loudly, “Fuck you Potter.”
Draco had spent his time studying out in the gardens. They reminded him of the gardens at Sancerre and the time he spent with his mother, plus it was quiet. That is, it was quiet most of the time, today Draco could hear strange noises coming from the other side of the hedges. He tried to ignore the sounds, but he couldn’t concentrate.
Draco took the envelope and headed up to his room. He set the letter aside to read in the morning but as he got ready for bed his curiosity got the better of him. He began to skim the letter to see what it was about.
As that thought crossed his mind Draco felt a deep pain of self-hatred. Was he really so shallow that his inheritance and legacy meant more to him than his freedom? Yes.
“So you’ll play with me then?”
And so Draco used the summer to practice, mimicking the other boys’ behaviour. He told jokes, incurred favours, pretended to be interested in whatever his “friends” liked. And it seemed to work, Draco became more and more popular among the group.
Before the knockout stage began the media hosted a press conference with the eight seekers. They started with Krum asking him if he had plans of slowing down anytime soon. He told them that he was still improving daily and would continue playing quidditch for years to come. The next question was for Draco.
After the sun had set and everyone had gone home, Draco found Harry packing up the leftover food.
“Ok,” Coach Kern nodded. “But if you need me to pull you out for any reason just signal me. I’d rather put in a sub than have you stretching yourself thin.”
Except, well, that wasn’t true was it. Every time he caught a glimpse of the snitch the instinct to beat Potter took over - only now there was something less bitter about it and Draco was surprised to find a smile had etched its way onto his face.
“No, and he never will.”
He pulled a feint and got Potter to chase after him, losing him behind a bludger before looping around and plucking the golden ball out of the air.
As Draco found a table near the front, he thought to himself that the conservatory had a real shot at surpassing the library as his favourite place in the school. He settled into a seat and pulled out his notebook and quill. He was ten minutes into writing out his weekly schedule when he heard someone come in.
When Draco had imagined this moment he had wondered if he would cry, but there were no tears. Instead, he laughed. It was an awful sort of feeling. He thought he would have felt free, at least, but he didn’t. He still felt the need to prove himself to his father, he supposed that had been ingrained in him so deeply he would never be free of it. A wave of nausea passed over him. He reached inside and let his magic calm him.
The rest of the semester went by fast. Draco made number one in the class, as he knew he would. And in the quidditch final, he made the game-winning catch beating out Beauxbâtons’ star seeker, Victor Leclère.
“I don’t know, Potter. Are all your rules going to be this stupid?”
He needed to get back on a broom again so that he could prove to himself that he could. If he could turn his greatest failure into a success once more then he could move on. So he took the meeting with Phillip Moore, and the next day he was informed that he got the job.
“So Phillip wasn’t having one on, you really are back.”
Draco took another deep breath. “I understand why you don’t want to talk to me, that was kind of the point of those things I said, but I need to apologize.”
There was also the issue of spending money. Draco wouldn’t be able to buy weekend robes, extra sweets, books, or toys which would make it harder to make friends. He didn’t care what a bunch of muggles thought of him, but it would be different with other wizards. He would have to find some other way to make a good impression.
“What are you talking about?”
"What? Draco! You’ve never been flying?” said Pansy, dismayed.
When he got back to the hotel it was well past midnight but before he could make it to the elevator one of the staff flagged him down.
“Draco,” Professor Dubois interrupted as Draco worked on the rosemary.
“Draco!”
Draco sighed. “I know, okay. I know.”
Finwick studied Draco’s face for a moment. “No, I don’t suppose you are - I can’t imagine there is anyone who scares you.”
“Mama, Mama.” The girl ran up to her mother.
“Yes, but not when they steal my boyfriend away from me. Why can’t you just study with me? That way we both improve our grades and your handsome partner doesn’t feel so neglected.
There was a rare smile on Draco’s face as he exited the locker room and followed his teammates onto the pitch. The smile fell immediately when he locked eyes with the last person he had expected to see.
Pansy's flat was inspired by
“And what about the rest of the school? I don’t think…” Draco let the thought trail off.
Draco followed the other boys to the first-year dorms and found his supplies waiting for him in a trunk at the foot of his bed. He wasted no time in changing out of his old uniform. It felt good to be back in proper wizarding attire and he spared a moment to admire his reflection in the mirror. Of course, the uniform had not been custom-tailored but it fit him well and Draco’s light complexion looked good against the soft blue. His hair was still a disaster, but there was nothing he could do about that at the moment.
“Draco? What’s wrong?” Asim stopped pressing kisses along Draco’s neck and sat back.
“What else are you going to do? Get drunk?”
“Malfoy’s triumphant return. Surely you must know the rumours that surrounded your father after he left.”
Reaching the locker room Draco quickly stripped and hopped into a cold shower. If he was fast he might be able to make it in and out before the rest of his team made it off the pitch. A few seconds was all he needed to wash off the sweat. Draco threw on a t-shirt and some joggers. It would be freezing with his wet hair but he could bear it for the few minutes it took to get to the apparition point.
A couple of days later, Draco’s prediction came true and he was matched up against Krum for the semi-finals. The match was brutal, lasting over five hours. Krum kept Draco on his toes the entire time and by the end of it, Draco was exhausted physically, mentally, and emotionally. The loss was disappointing but not entirely unexpected.

“I’m fine being alone and it really wasn’t so bad.”
having fun and that was just the warmup.”
Draco put on his mental armour as he left the apartment and tried to put stupid Potter and his stupid comments out of his head. It didn’t work and Draco was a second behind everyone else during the match.
“Je passe souvent par la France, la prochaine fois que vous en avez envie, regardez-moi et je serai heureux de vous offrir une cuisine raffinée.”
Thomas frowned. “But isn’t as much fun by myself, pleeeeease, you can study later if you really have to.”
“Both,” Draco admitted.
“Shit Draco, you look like hell.”
Draco was quite a moment, wondering if he should even bring it up. He sighed. “What happens to us at the end of summer?”
“Krum is a machine but he doesn’t have any passion. I watched your first match against Kenmare and I knew. You get it.”
She nodded before flying off.
At the end of summer Thomas gave Draco a tearful hug and promised to come back next year. He knew Thomas had no control over the matter but couldn’t help but hope it was true all the same.
“Oui, ou je le serais si j'avais quelqu'un avec qui en profiter.”
Draco popped open the tin, inside was a handful of little orange pills. He eyed Vanessa sceptically. “So what, I just swallow one of these each morning and all my work just magically gets done?”
Before the charity match Potter came looking for him.
Draco began to dread the approaching school year. He was afraid that it would mean the end of everything between them, and that thought began to eat away at him.
“Sorry,” Draco covered quickly, “your hair is ridiculous. It defies the laws of gravity you know.”
“Malfoy. A word.”
Harry opened his mouth to speak but Draco cut him off.
“Blaise!”
Ice water ran through his veins. This couldn’t be happening. What was he doing here?
Draco threw his arms up in exasperation. “What do you want me to do? Put him in a Body Bind? I can’t make him talk to me if he doesn’t want to.”
Practice was over way too quickly. Draco showered and changed before wandering around the complex looking for Harry. He ended up in the coach’s office before finding out that Harry had taken off right after practice had ended.
He did his best to feign interest when the topic inevitably came up. The other boys were content to go on and on about their own crushes and it was easy enough to just play along. Eventually though, they began to ask if there was anyone that Draco liked. Whenever it would come up, Draco would just shrug it off and deflect the conversation but he knew that was a tactic that wouldn’t last forever.
“You flatter me. I’ll think about it and let you know,” Draco said though he already wanted this more than anything.
As Draco rushed to grab the rest of his things he caught sight of his reflection in the mirror. Pathetic. Eighteen years old and already a has-been. He was completely alone in the world and always would be. He had wanted to defy his father, make him regret abandoning Draco, but the truth was his father hadn’t spared him a single thought in almost a decade. So what was the point? What was the fucking point of it all?
"Sometimes blood means more than just your family, and you have a real talent." Xavier smiled and placed a hand on Draco’s bicep. “It's quite loud in here, perhaps we should find a quieter place to talk?"
did that. His magic had finally manifested. Draco took advantage of the resulting chaos to slip away unnoticed.
Thomas didn’t have any magic. That couldn’t be right. That wasn’t right. Thomas was sweet and brilliant and bright. “I thought you were pureblood?”
“Is that Japrisot?” Draco asked in disbelief.
“Wait a minute.” Draco followed after him.
“Are you a student?”
During the group stage Great Britain played Italy, Belgium, and Sweden. They won all three games.
“Let me make one thing clear,” Draco projected his words so the whole room could hear. His accent was perfect. “My current circumstances, while unfortunate, are not permanent. It would be best for everyone involved if we just agree to stay out of each other’s way.”
Outside of practices and games, Draco didn’t have much going on. He wrote to Pansy often enough in the beginning but eventually the letters slowed. He drank. As soon as he got home from practice there would be a glass in his hand. It was familiar. It was comforting. And it wasn’t as though he had much else to do.
Draco frowned. “Yes, but
So he did his best to get into a routine. He woke up early and chatted with Melrose as they made breakfast. His father usually had breakfast delivered to his study so Draco ate alone. Then Draco would spend the morning studying from his workbooks: maths, science, French, English, history, geography, and civics. He rotated the subjects daily but everything was self-taught and Draco had no way to test his knowledge.
Wanting to crawl into bed with a hangover potion and maybe a bloody mary or two, Draco ended the match quickly.
After Draco said his goodbyes, Raynham apparated them to the railway station in Tracy-sur-Loir. Draco stared out the window the entire three-hour trip, face pressed up against the glass. He tried to read one of the books he had brought along, but he couldn’t concentrate. When he reached Lyon a man met him on the platform, and introduced himself as Mr Barker.
The next morning he showed up at Potter’s flat in London. They quickly moved out back to the garden and Potter began to lay down the ground rules.
Krum nodded and flew off. Draco might have imagined it, but he thought he saw a small smile on Krums face as he departed.
Draco smiled. “Ok then.”
And so things reached an equilibrium, a new normal, which is why his tenth birthday came as such a surprise. Mr Barker handed out the mail every morning at breakfast. Since arriving at l'Internat Draco had not received any correspondence from his father, there had been a note on his ninth birthday but Draco understood it was nothing more than a formality. He had expected to receive the same for his tenth but instead of an envelope, Draco was handed a small brown parcel.
“Sorry,” Draco said. “Carry on slaying your dragons or whatever it was you were doing. I’ll find another place to study.”
“I’ve been in town for a few days and I have actually seen you around… at the liquor store.”
The rest of the week Harry managed to avoid Draco, which was quite a feat. April asked him about Harry again on Friday after Harry had managed to slip past Draco once again.
Thomas did end up returning for another summer, his mom still had some research she needed to wrap up so they would have one more holiday together.
“No…” Draco shook his head.
Draco had his chance and he failed. His father had been right after all. He was nothing and there was nothing left for him to do except drink himself into oblivion.
“If I joined the dance team I might as well just come out to the whole school now. Besides, I haven’t done ballroom since I was eight, there is no way I still remember all the steps.”
Pride of Portree, Draco doubled his efforts on the pitch. He poured all his energy into running drills, honing his reflexes, and sharpening his instincts. He knew Potter would be able to see any weakness and so he had to be sure there was no weakness to be seen.
“What’s that?”
“Yes, Cassie?”
She laughed. “No time-turner, but I might have the next best thing.”
He ducked his head slightly and let out a nervous laugh before making eye contact again. “I’m sorry about last night. I promise I wasn’t trying to hustle you.”
“Come with me to London. Draco, you need help.”
Once classes started up, it seemed his fears had been completely valid. Draco found the girls themselves easy enough to avoid, but he couldn’t escape the conversations. Girls quickly became the sole topic amongst his “friends”, and Draco found that his lack of interest in girls was just one more thing that made him different from the other boys.
The match opening was a spectacle in and of itself with fireworks and performances. Draco was antsy to get the game started when the whistle finally blew. Draco took off immediately and did a few warm-up laps of the pitch. Krum was hoovering stoically from a vantage point high up in the air, but Draco kept the bigger picture in mind.
“A headache, and also a numb tingling sensation in my legs and feet.”
Harry smiled back. “Ok.”
“Ok. I’m going.” Pansy grabbed her jacket and scarf from the coat closet. “There are leftovers in the fridge for lunch and I’ve got a couple books in my room if you want to borrow one.” Pansy gave Draco a quick hug. “I’ll be back this afternoon and then we can go see that healer about those potions.”
“Hm. Yes, well, Krum isn’t here so lighten up, will you?”
Coach Pharo spoke a bit more on his expectations for the season and the first couple of games in the schedule before everyone mounted their brooms. It was an easy practice, everyone readjusting to each other after the break.
Tibby cried as Draco hugged her for the last time. Melrose was a bit more stoic but emotional all the same. Draco would miss them, all of them. They had been his friends, his family, for so long.
“I don’t need your help or anyone else’s for that matter,” Draco spat. “The only person you can depend on in this world is yourself and I plan on doing just that. It doesn’t matter how long it takes, I will knock you off your high horse eventually. And I will do so on my own.”
I’ve been watching your games.”
Draco woke up the next morning aching all over. Even walking was painful, but Draco’s stubbornness outweighed the discomfort and he was able to stay just a few paces behind Harry on their run. After making it back to Harry’s flat and getting his breathing back under control, Draco laid down in the grass.
“You could stay, you know,” Harry spoke softly so that Draco could ignore it if he wished. He didn’t, turning from the door back to Harry. “It’s a big bed and I don’t mind sharing-- Just sleep of course,” Harry hastily added.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Alright then, you can teach me the spells after supper tonight. I’ll meet you in the Arithmancy Classroom at eight.” Draco didn’t wait for a response and instead headed out the door to his next class.
With the International Quidditch Tournament over, Draco had a few months until the next season started. He decided to return to France for the summer, renting a small home that was part of a magical community in the Var.
Draco looked over to the Portuguese player. “I’m looking forward to it.”
The street was crowded with witches and wizards doing some last-minute school shopping. Draco breathed in deeply, he could feel the magic radiating through the air, this was where he belonged.
“Good luck today, Malfoy,” Potter spoke as he gripped Draco’s hand in his own. Draco met Potter’s eyes but didn’t respond. His victory would speak for itself and
“I thought all the positions were filled.”
Draco stood around awkwardly while the other boys talked about girls and dared each other to go say stupid things to them. The girls were gathered in their own little corner laughing and giggling. Draco was bored out of his mind. A few people had broken away from the main group and Draco tried to join in on a few of those conversations, but he quickly found that he had nothing in common with these people. It was the beginning of first year all over again. Everyone just repeated the same shallow interactions over and over again, and nothing substantial was ever discussed.
“Are you going to question all of my rules?”
“What are you doing in Paris?”
“I always spend June in Paris. I like to enjoy the summer weather before it gets too hot. Join me for a drink.”
International Quidditch Tournament. Ultimately it was Krum who came out on top maintaining his undefeated status.
“How interesting... Tell me, Draco, have you ever heard of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder?”
“I’ve been doing good for a while now but I am still crashing in your guestroom.”
“I asked a few friends to come over this afternoon for a pickup game. We’ll see then if last time was just a fluke.”
“Yes, well, I spent some time with some muggles before
“Mn-mn… comfy,” Draco protested.
“I’m not drunk.”
“Right. Sorry.”
Potter was watching his games? “I needed to get him off my tail.”
Draco showed up to the first day of training with a sense of determination. As he walked to the locker room he was hit with a sudden craving but he pushed the thought out of his mind focusing instead on his new goals. He was going to earn the respect of his teammates first, then hopefully the fans would follow. He knew it might take a while but he was willing to put in the work. He had no other option.
The next day Draco felt like shit. He had barely slept, which was hardly a new development, and he couldn’t even keep his hands steady as he got ready in the bathroom mirror. He poured out four little orange pills into his hand and swallowed them without any water. He didn’t take the pills every day anymore, usually just game days or days when he really needed to focus, but without them he just felt adrift. He had noticed that it took more of them to get him through the day than it used to, just like it took a few more drinks before he could get properly drunk.
“Clearly not.” Asim paused. “If you are so worried about your grades, you could cut down on the alcohol.” Draco’s entire body tensed, but Asim continued on. “Don’t think I haven’t noticed. You drink practically every day now.”
The next day Thomas did in fact forgive Draco, he was ecstatic that Draco still wanted to be his friend and didn’t hate him for being a squib. Draco was discussed at their society that was how Thomas had to navigate the world now and discussed at himself for playing into that narrative.
“You are so fucking beautiful,” Harry said.
“Well done Draco,” Professor Dubois said as he inspected the students’ progress, “an excellent focus for improving productivity. Where did you get the idea for using frankincense? Boswellia is a very difficult plant to grow, and I don’t believe your textbook details its particular properties.”
“You don’t seem too upset about losing.”
“It means, know thy enemy.”
“Yeah, good and drunk. Fucking bombed. And maybe high, too. Why not?”
“You know Phillip asked me before he hired you.”
Pansy had a stereo system, so Draco put on some music and collapsed onto the couch. Merlin, how much longer was he going to feel like this?
“I’m not a child.” Draco crossed his arm.
“Merlin, why do you have to be so god damn stubborn.”
The match against Mata was the most difficult Draco had played in a while. Mata was an older player in her mid-thirties and had heaps of experience and understanding of the sport that Draco still lacked. She was able to counter Draco’s speed quite beautifully but ended up losing the match in the second hour.
Draco scoffed and ordered another drink.
Harry stretched Draco some more with two fingers before adding a third and Draco was touching himself now, slow but deliberate strokes along his cock.
“You don’t have your wand. Remember?”
Potter smiled. “I guess we will.”
“Great.” Potter glared at him.
“How would you possibly know?” Draco couldn’t help but ask.
“I always see you Draco.”
“Shut up,” Draco sneered though he was secretly very pleased with himself.
“Draco, I think you need help.”
Draco groaned.
At the moment Draco was passed out in the library where he had spent the entire weekend and still he hadn’t even made a dent in his ‘To-do List’.
He didn’t fall asleep until five in the morning.
Draco blushed. “I did alright.”
Asim also appreciated Draco’s talent of swiping a bottle from the kitchens. They spent many a night getting drunk together and philosophizing about stupid things like what would happen if the muggle world found out about magic or the repercussions of someone going back in time and adopting themselves.
Draco blushed.
“But Lucius surely…” Narcissa trailed off fully taking in her situation. “Tibby! Melrose! Raynham!”
“So, how did they die?” The boy asked as his companions filled the other empty seats.
Draco considered his options. If he went to one of the adults for help the other boys would see him as weak or worse, a tattletale, and Draco had already done a good enough job of painting a target on his back, he didn’t need to give them more of a reason to pick on him than they already had. So Draco finished his meal before excusing himself from the dining room. He could feel the other boys’ eyes on him as he got up to leave but he kept his head held up high.
He went out to the liquor store down the street and bought several bottles of wine, brandy, and vodka along with some food. He didn't plan on leaving the house for several days.
“Yes. You have.”
“Well, he has an odd way of showing it,” Draco muttered.
The end result was that Draco spent most of his free time alone. After dinner, he would often swipe a bottle of wine from the kitchens, find an empty classroom, and drink a glass or two as he worked on revisions by himself. He found it comforting to have a glass of wine in his hand to keep him company as he studied, and he never drank enough to get properly drunk.
“What?”
Potter was quiet for a beat.
Draco thanked him for his words and crossed over the threshold. With each step Draco felt lighter and the smile on his face grew.
It wasn’t too long after his conversation with Dorian that Draco caught sight of the snitch. It was hovering near the centre in a gap between the other players. Draco took off at speed knowing Krum had done the same. Krum had an edge since he was dive-bombing the snitch from above, but Draco was slightly closer in positioning. As the snitch took off it became a neck and neck race between the two.
As Draco made his way down to the ground, several of his teammates offered their congratulations but Draco was only thinking of one person. Once he landed, he saw the mop of dark black hair barreling towards him and he took off in a sprint.
“So what is Beauxbâtons like? A couple of Beauxbâtons students stayed at Hogwarts for the Triwizard Tournament but I didn’t really get to interact with them a lot since I was only a fourth-year. Is it true that you have to kiss a frog at the graduation ceremony?
After that day in the garden, Thomas pestered Draco relentlessly. He learned that Thomas’ parents were divorced and his mom was the advanced Astronomy professor. She was conducting some sort of research using the school’s telescope as so she needed to stay on campus. Which is how Thomas found himself at Beauxbâtons for the summer.
She reached up with her non-wand hand and gently touched his face, turning it in the light. She made kind of a humming noise as she scrutinized Draco’s features. A complicated wand motion accompanied the words,
As much as he hated to admit it, Draco noticed a difference in his speed and reflexes since the last match he was in. Had it really been only a few weeks? Harry certainly wasn’t going easy on him but Draco found that he had no problem keeping up.
to prepare for.” Pansy rolled her eyes but didn’t call Draco out on his bullshit. The truth was that Draco had already checked and all the seeker spots were filled for next year.
It was a good routine - comfortable, easy - and the semester passed by quickly. Draco was content at least for the moment.
With everyone back at school, Draco noticed more than a few second glances at his improved appearance. But the real test would come with the first rankings of the semester, if Draco was able to make it into the top ten that would probably be enough to gain him some notoriety.
“I was damaged long before I meet you. My father knew it, that’s why he didn’t want anything to do with me. You tried to fix me once already and look where we ended up.” Draco gestured to the empty corridor. “I’m sorry Potter, but you’re just going to have to find someone else to be your pet project because I can’t anymore. Turns out everyone else had the right idea all along and I’m done trying to prove them wrong. I give up.”
. Did they sleep together? Draco could hardly remember anything from last night. He was completely screwed. He stumbled into the bathroom and dug through his toiletry bag. He had gone without them for months but if there was ever a time when he needed an extra pick me up this was it.
Harry tossed Draco a broom.
The night of the 31st, Draco showed up as a dragon prince. He transfigured his extra set of winter robes to have a hard scaled pattern and animated a white paper dragon that arched around his neck. The dragon would move, flying around his body in loops before settling back on his shoulders.
Beauxbâtons’ Conservatory was breathtaking. Draco had only seen the conservatory from a distance when walking the campus grounds but inside the glass structure felt otherworldly.
The stadium the had been built for the final was larger than any Draco had ever seen. He wasn’t sure how they had managed to fill it but fill it they had. Everyone was there to see Krum pull off another win for Russia. Draco took a deep breath and tuned out the crowd. It wouldn’t do to get nervous now.
“There is something I need to talk to you about.”
“My sentiments exactly.”
“I’m not crazy.”
“I just might have to take you up on that.” Draco turned to Harry to ask if he had ever been to France, but Harry was gone. Draco caught a glimpse of him as he disappeared into the kitchen, so instead he turned his attention back to Blaise and carried on their conversation about food.
all his letters.
“Master Draco?” Tibby interrupted. “Your father is wishing to speak with you in his study.”
“I miss you,” Draco whined as he curled up next to Asim, who was studying
Draco made himself a plate of food but he stuck with water and was surprised to see Harry do the same.
“Flying?”
It was a dangerous move, especially in the rain, but it worked. The snitch was gone. The referee blew her whistle and called a foul, giving Durmstrang a free shot on goal. Draco knew they would be gunning for him now and his teammates had to work extra hard to keep the bludgers away.
“You’re on, Potter.” And with those words, Draco took off from the ground. Harry came up behind him and they raced across the garden. After a couple of laps they switched to showy tricks. Draco admired the natural grace Harry had on a broom.
“Who?” Harry asked confused.
The next day he was feeling a bit better. He was still tired but he wanted to get out of the house. Draco was pretty sure he was going stir crazy. Pansy took him out shopping as a distraction and they went on a walk in the park. When they got home, Pansy stayed up with him and they played cards until one o’clock in the morning.
After allowing himself this, Draco picked himself up and began putting everything back in its place.
“I need a job, but no team would take me now and I don’t have any training in anything else.”
“What the fuck, Pansy?”
As summer break approached, so did final exams. Draco was disappointed to find that despite all his hard work he had yet to distinguish himself. He’d managed to move from the middle to the upper end of the rankings, but it wasn’t enough. He needed to be at the top or there was no point.
at the school who could at least serve as a bearable companion until her return.
“The château your father left you in the Loire Valley. They won’t follow us there. I have enough pull in the Ministry to protect us from that.”
“Uh uh, Up!” Pansy ripped the sheets off the bed and Draco groaned.
“Fine. I am going. Happy?”
Draco smiled and put the letter away to respond to later. The next day he got three more offers for various teams and by the end of the week, he had gathered a respectable half dozen from teams all over the world.
“I heard that your father disowned you and you grew up in a muggle orphanage. Is it true?”
Harry gave Draco a questioning look.
Harry pulled out his fingers and Draco turned back around so that they were facing one another. He gave Harry a soft kiss and laid down again on his back bending his legs to give Harry access at this new angle.
“Perhaps we could meet up after the game?” Draco tried to deflect.
“Murphy let me in,” the tone was stern. Birch walked over and sat next to Draco. “The greatest match of your career and you show up drunk.”
Two hours later, Draco was exhausted and five galleons poorer.
Draco smiled and reached across the table taking Pansy’s hand. He wondered for the millionth time how he had gotten so lucky to have a friend like Pansy Parkinson.
As they took to the air, Draco couldn’t help but admire Potter’s skill on a broom. All the grace and poise that he lacked on the ground he had spades of in the air. Draco shook himself out of his trance and began his hunt. His eyes scanned the pitch as he avoided the chaos of the other players. He had begun to develop a mental map of the field keeping track of everyone else’s movements and predicting their plays.
Dorian turned to him. “Keep on Krum and the snitch for now. They are one hundred and fortypoints ahead at the moment so the snitch would still mean a win.”
“I know exactly what you mean. That feeling of being completely... outmatched. Like you're caught in a storm on all sides. The training, the instincts, it all leaves you and the best you can do is keep yourself upright.”
“That was some impressive flying today,” he said.
“That’s fantastic Draco,” Harry mumbled, his face still buried in Draco’s neck. “I mean, of course they picked you. You saw how well Wilson did up against Krum in the tournament. You’re the only one who has a shot at beating him.”
“That’s what I just said isn’t it.”
“I’ll stay over tonight and we’ll clean it up. You can stay with me for as long as it takes to get you clean again. I know a witch, very discreet, that specializes in addiction potions. We use her for work sometimes.”
Harrison was by far the loudest, always the life of the party. He had a bit of a mean streak, his anger issues were something he was working on with his therapist, but he was dedicated to the team and his friends and beyond loyal. There wasn’t anything he wouldn’t do for the people he cared about.
“That’s up to him. It will probably be painful but he won’t suffer any permanent damage if he decides to continue.” They both looked at Draco.
Draco looked up to see who had woken him from his nap, Vanessa Malet, one of the sixth-year girls. She was top of her class and captain of the debate team.
“Ok, and let me know if you have any questions about it.”
?” Simon looked into the box and Draco’s muscles tensed, the pressure was beginning to build behind his eyes as he fought back the tears.
The next morning Draco stared at the little orange pill in his hand. It didn’t seem like much but Vanessa had assured him it would work.
“Draco, you can’t graduate from Beauxbâtons without experiencing it at least once. I think they have a bunch of spare brooms in the quidditch shed. Next time you’re bored you should take one out for a loop around the campus. I promise you won’t regret it.”
Besides all that, playing for the Tutshill Tornados was a bit of a homecoming for Draco. Sure he hadn’t been in England since he was practically a baby but still, England was his roots, his home.
“I’m not
“No, that is quite alright. I believe I have everything I need. Draco, it was a pleasure to meet you.” And with that Ms Skeeter showed herself out.
And then Draco was alone once more.
The wand rolled across the floor and they both reached for it. But before Draco could get a firm grasp Harry switched tactics and pinned Draco to the ground. They were both sweating now, though Draco was not as out of breath as he would have been just a couple of weeks ago. In fact, he felt energized like there was electricity flowing through his body and Harry’s face was really close to his own and suddenly there was no space between the two because Harry was kissing him.
Draco marched into the kitchen and pulled out a bottle of wine. He started to take a drink but stopped himself looking at the bottle in disgust before pouring the contents into the sink. Draco grabbed the rest of his alcohol and one by one washed them down the drain. He hunted through the apartment making sure to get every last one. Then he went into his apothecary and flushed the bottle of pills.
“I’m aware,” she spoke with a haughty tone. “Unfortunately, the women’s bathroom always has a line after lunch and I refuse to wait fifteen minutes for the loo when there is a perfectly good empty bathroom right down the hall.”
The first few weeks after the funeral were agony, but Draco endured them without breaking. The one lesson his father had taught him, and taught him well, was that as a Malfoy Draco was expected to be better, to do better, than his peers. And since Draco had no peers to compare himself to, he had to be perfect. Which meant that he could not allow himself to be weak.
“Why haven’t you talked to him yet?” April asked, cornering Draco in the hallway.
“Please, Draco. The whole team would owe you big time if you agreed.”
“Is that what this is about? Is that why you are here?”
“Coming.” Draco sat up and tried to get out of the bed but he ended up getting caught in the sheets and falling to the ground. “Shit.” At least he was wearing pants.
Once Pansy was satisfied with Draco’s appearance she made him go down to the dining chamber and watched as he ate his entire plate.
Harry’s smirk grew, “Actually I was thinking that today we might do some flying.”
“That’s very nice of you but I am not sure.” Draco moved to take another sip of his drink but Potter stopped him.
After returning to the hotel, Draco stopped by the front desk to place a room service order for the morning when he caught sight of a familiar face at the hotel bar.
After a while, Ginny wandered off but Blaise stayed behind regaling Draco with a story about his trip to Riyadh and how he got trapped in a Saudi prince’s palace for five days due to some malfunctioning wards.
Though it was hard not to think about it when he had Potter standing right in front of him.
“We were,” Draco continued cautiously. “Blaise is fabulous. Did you know he’s friends with Elana Caprine?”
The week after the tournament Draco received several letters. The first came during the evening meal and surprised Draco – outside of Pansy’s holiday letters, Draco didn’t receive much mail.
After that, they resumed their games of make-believe in the gardens and Draco even brought Thomas to the conservatory with him. He taught Thomas how to take care of the plants, which ones needed water when and how much, which ones liked to be talked to, or sung lullabies, which ones needed more sun, etc. etc.
“The famous designer. Honestly, Potter you’re hopeless aren’t you,” he teased.
“I didn’t say no sex,” Harry retorted. “I told you to forget about sex.”
The day after the match he let out a particularly loud sigh as he poked at his breakfast.
Draco didn’t cry at the service. His father wouldn’t have approved and he had already shed his tears the night she passed away.
“How did you get back here?” Draco asked lifting his head from his hands.
Simon had been at l'Internat longer than any of the other boys and was only about a year older than Draco himself. He was constantly getting detentions and was one of Draco’s more enthusiastic tormentors.
“Draco wait!”
Harry looked up at him in surprise from his seat at the table.
“Blaise?”
“This was fun,” Xavier said, his eyes smiling. “We should do it again sometime.”
The moment played out in slow motion as both seekers collided. As his body was sent flying through the air, Draco saw the exact moment he could have reached out and grabbed the snitch but he let the moment go by. A safety spell caught Draco and kept him from meeting a more gruesome fate. The collision had still hurt like a mother-fucker and Draco’s shoulder was absolutely killing him.
“You know my offer to train with me still stands. There are still a few weeks left before the season starts.”
Draco smiled and kissed his boyfriend.
a party. Do try and have fun.” Finwick started to walk away. “But not too much fun, yeah? We still have that game against Pride tomorrow.”
That first day Draco had expected Thomas to hunt him down and drag him off to play like he had last year, but the entire day passed without so much as a sighting of the other boy. At dinner, Draco shot him a look from across the room but Thomas only averted his eyes and ducked his head. Something weird was going on. That whole first week Thomas seemed to be avoiding Draco, and Draco couldn’t figure out what he had done wrong. Maybe Thomas had sent him a letter that had got lost in the mail and thought Draco didn’t want to talk to him anymore? But why wouldn’t he just say something?
“Oh, what's wrong with dance? You're a pureblood aren’t you? Even if you went to school in Lyon, I know you had lessons.”
“You know why.” Draco scowled at Asim.
Harry nodded and waited for Draco to leave.
“Did you just…” Draco started.
Pansy frowned. “Ok, ok. I just have to handle this one thing and then I’ll be your’s for the rest of the week.”
Draco packed his bags and apparated with Pansy to her flat in London. Pansy made dinner while Draco unpacked his stuff in the guest room. Pansy had done well for herself and Draco couldn’t help but feel guilty for falling out of touch with her. Draco didn’t deserve a friend like Pansy. He didn’t-- Draco looked down at his shaking handstand clenched them tight. He couldn’t change the past but he could do something about the future. He would be the friend Pansy deserved.
“Its primary use is in a nasty little sleeping draught, not at all unlike the Draught of Living Death. Perhaps you would like to grab a few of your classmates and show them?” Dubois asked with a smile.
Holyhead Harpies. Draco couldn't really figure out what Blaise did for a living. As far as he could tell Blaise just travelled the world and met other interesting people.
“You always drink this much?”
“Elliot Fisher is taking my spot for the season, maybe longer.”
“Does that mean you think you can beat her?”
Justin smiled. “I’ve known the kid since he was just starting out at Hogwarts. How’s that for old?”
Her last letter had told him in no uncertain terms to at least
“Because you would do the same for me.”
“Hmmm. Do you imagine you saw the snitch as a representation of the love and acceptance you must have craved? Impossible to pin down, always just out of reach.”
Harry met his eyes with an intense gaze. “So, what are you going to do about Krum?”
“I can’t do this right now.” Draco tried to push past Harry.
“Well, go on then. Have a look.”
It wasn’t until March that Draco realized, for the first time, he had a real true friend. Pansy had wormed her way into Draco’s life and he was surprised to find that he genuinely cared about her opinions, thoughts, and feelings. He couldn’t have been happier.
“Thanks.” Draco smiled.
“Hmmm,” Draco responded.
“Lucius, what is the meaning of this.”
But all of that was ruined one afternoon in late November. The air had begun to cool so Draco was pretending that he and Nicolas were on an arctic expedition. They had encountered a group of talking polar bears and Draco was attempting to negotiate with the great polar bear warrior, Ulysses, so that he and Nicolas could get a ride to the research base at the south pole.
“Draco.”
All the teams were staying at the Hotel Casa Tarongí for the week. The tournament itself was only three days but most of the teams arrived a few days early. All the players mingled with each other and a few groups left to explore the city. Draco opted to stay behind and read his book.
From that point on, they started interacting with each other during practices and Draco slowly improved. He was starting to adjust to the new team and was eager to test out his skill in a real game.
“It’s eight o’clock in the morning. Let me through.”
Birch’s tone left no room for argument and they stepped out into the hall away from prying ears.
“You’re joking.”
“I’m right here.”
Draco stared at the snitch in his hand in disbelief. The noise around him was so deafening that it just became a buzz, his ears were ringing. They did it. Fuck, he just beat the world’s best seeker and he had done so on the largest stage imaginable. Fuck.
The entire time he wanted nothing more than a drink, but he pushed down the urge. Draco just felt numb.
“Draco Malfoy.”
“You wouldn’t if you were with me.”
“I- I am, but they said that it doesn’t matter and that plenty of pureblood families have squibs.”
Asim sighed heavily, “We’ve had this conversation before. How did you even get the rankings in the first place, they aren’t posted until the end of the semester?”
Two weeks into his bender he woke up to an owl pecking at his fingers.
“I’m not fighting dragons! It’s a lightsaber.” The boy held up the branch pointedly. “I’m Thomas. Who are you?”
“I think I understand now why you wanted me to train with you. You’re trying to kill me.” Draco said between bites.
“The missus is being in the nursery with young Master Dr--”
He knew it would have to end eventually, but his next match was a few days away and he just needed to be numb for a little while.
The snitch flew up and directly into the melee of players. Draco and Krum followed. It was a test of Draco’s skill to avoid any collisions and he and Krum spung, bobbed, and weaved around the other players.
Vratsa Vultures took the world by storm from the moment he first got on a broom. He has been hailed as the best seeker of his generation and even debated to be the greatest seeker the wizarding world has ever seen.
“Must have been quite a relief to attend Beauxbâtons. But you didn’t join the quidditch team until your sixth year. Why is that?”
The celebration when they got back to Beauxbâtons was just as big as the party at Durmstrang. Though unfortunately, Draco didn’t hook up with anyone. Instead, he drank copious amounts of alcohol and basked in the praise of his peers. Pansy even indulged in the merriment though she explicitly told Draco not to let this “jock nonsense” go to his head.
The summer would probably drag on with Pansy gone and no Thomas, but at least he would have Dubois. The last day before the break Draco was in high spirits, he and Pansy had worked out a pen pal schedule for the summer, and he was finishing up the day’s work-study with Professor Dubois. They were pruning a lot of the plants in the conservatory for the start of summer.
“I read the piece in the Prophet. Skeeter was completely off base. I’ve seen you fly - there’s nothing ridged about it,” Potter paused then added, “I’m Harry Potter.”
The knocking continued.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you Draco.” Professor Dubois smiled. “Since you’re here, would you mind helping me set up for the lesson?”
A curtain hung in the doorway and Draco heard a whittling tea kettle. A few moments later the healer pushed open the curtain and came in holding a cup of tea.
of Harry Potter.”
Harry yawned again rubbing his eyes but opened up the connection so that Draco could come over.
He showed up to breakfast with a smile on his face and a pep in his step that he hadn’t had the day before.
Draco took a few staggering steps before apparating home.
The match took place on a crisp, grey day. Despite the chill in the air, the stands were packed. Before the match both teams lined up to shake hands, the seekers at the very back. Draco glared as Potter drew closer.
Draco’s mask slipped only for a second.
“Are the two of you…”
Pansy was already on the phone talking to a client. She gestured to a plate of toast and a bottle of orange juice and Draco poured himself a glass. He wished he had some champagne to go with it. Just enough to make his headache go away. Instead he sat down at the table and started on his toast. Pansy hung up the phone and turned to Draco.
Boarding school? Draco shouldn’t have been surprised. He knew his independent study was only a temporary solution and he would need a formal education. Boarding school would take care of that and absolve his father of any other parenting responsibilities.
Draco nodded his head apprehensively. He wasn’t sure how he had gotten himself into this situation. This was the most he had ever interacted with a girl.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco stared at the letter another second, and then met her eyes. “I think I have just been recruited to play professional quidditch.”
He responded to them all politely declining, for now, stating that he preferred to complete his studies before he embarked on his chosen career. But the word was out, Draco Malfoy was one to watch.
Great Britain received a 30 point penalty for Draco’s play so they had some ground to make up for. Draco ran some assists and screens, shielding his teammates from the other players. The entire time he kept watch on Krum, but it seemed the snitch was nowhere to be seen. Draco thanked his lucky stars.
“Sorry, Malfoy, you left so quickly I didn’t get the chance to tell you ‘good game’...” Potter trailed off as he took in Draco’s appearance fully. “Have you already showered?”
The herbology teacher was new, a Professor Dubois. Draco planned on arriving to the first class half an hour early in order to make a good first impression. He had learned from last year that the professor’s opinion of you was just as important as your knowledge of the material, if not more so. But when he made it to the lecture room, he found it empty.
He turned back to the trunk and pulled out his wand, twelve-inch elm with a unicorn hair core, all fairly standard. Draco held it tenderly in his hand and let his magic flow through him. He could feel his magic probe at the wand, hesitantly at first and then more boldly.
“I’ve always thought I would fit into hell quite nicely. Plus, I haven’t used any of my vacation days at work. I’m sure they could survive a couple of weeks without me.”
But they still had three brutal games to get through before they could face Krum. Why couldn’t they play Russia in the quarter or semi-finals? Draco thought to himself. At least then if they lost it wouldn’t be so devastating.
Draco wasn’t sure what to wear. He didn’t have money for a costume and he certainly couldn’t show up in his uniform or his social life would be dead for good. Draco spent an entire week coming up with ideas and dismissing each of them in turn. Inspiration struck him late one night as he was going to bed, and suddenly he knew exactly what to do.
“I would say that Mr Potter isn’t here. I am.”
. They continued to ignore each other a while, before one of the sixth-year girls walked up to Draco. “Hey Draco, I don’t know if you remember me from yesterday. I’m Katy.” She offered out her hand and Draco shook it.
“I know I’ve outstayed my welcome,” he began.
That night they were both a bit buzzed, though not quite drunk. Asim was insisting that bowtruckles were actually evil incarnate. And offered the one encounter he had with a bowtruckle as proof.
Cole raised his water bottle in salute.
After a couple laps around the school, Draco slowed down and tried a few loops. His stomach dropped each time he flipped upside down, and he couldn’t get enough of the feeling. He spent the whole afternoon in the air testing out loops, spirals, nose dives, and any other trick he could think of. Too soon, the sun began to set and Draco forced himself to land.
“Sorry to disappoint.”
“I think not. You are very beautiful.”
After lunch, they did some stretching and then went back inside to watch some old game footage. Harry and Draco went over the mistakes and missed opportunities. Then they played a game of catch and release.
Three house-elves appeared at her side. She handed Draco over, red-faced and still silently wailing, to the nearest one.
“May El and I go play now?”
Draco made his way back to the party and his team and drank until he ended up puking in the bathroom.
“Of course you do.” Asim shook his head. “Why does it matter if you drop a few places anyway?”
“We are going to the finals!”
Potter trailed off as Draco reached out to brush his hair back revealing the famous scar. He could always blame it on the alcohol.
“What are you doing?” Harry asked.
Draco looked at Pansy incredulously. “Why?” After all the time they’ve spent apart, why would she do this for him?
“Come off it Finwick.”
He became so singular in his ambition that the other boys’ began to speculate that Draco had a crush on Emilie. Draco, of course, did nothing to dissuade them of this notion and even encouraged it from time to time. The other boys would tease him and Draco would play it off as if he was embarrassed, in truth he couldn’t care less but it made him more human in their eyes or some such nonsense.
“That may be true, but I feel like it is time for me to move on. Don’t tell me you and Max don’t miss your space.”
Harry tried to get in contact with Draco a few times, but Draco rejected all his fire calls and
“In school, I prided myself on my grades. It wasn’t until the end of fifth year that I even rode a broom.”
Draco turned away so that Birch couldn’t see the anger on his face.
For the next few hours Draco did nothing except stare into space and listen to his pounding heart. He heard the crack of apparition and Pansy walked into the room.
“Alright then. Where are you going to go?”
The locker room went quiet as soon as everyone noticed Draco. A few of the guys eyed him warily. Draco swallowed. This was fine. It was going to take a while to earn his teammates trust and respect. He knew this. If the worst he had to endure were a few icy stares he would be lucky.
“I probably should have known that was going to happen.” Pansy sighed.
“After graduation, if the right offer comes along I will consider it. I don’t have anything else lined up in potions or herbology and I enjoy it.”
Skeeter was interrupted by the team manager before she could finish that thought, “I’m afraid Draco’s late for practice but if you would like a tour of the facilities I would be happy to oblige.”
Draco eyes shifted over to Blaise. “I don’t think--”
Harry finished covering a bowl of hummus with some Spellwrap before responding. “I had to mingle and it seemed like you and Blaise were having fun.”
Draco turned around and walked away leaving Harry Potter alone in the corridor.
Draco heard a cheer and turned to see Russia had scored the first goal of the match. He wasn’t worried though. Quidditch was a high-scoring game and he believed in his teammates. However, as the clock kept ticking the point gap grew larger and larger. There was still no sign of the snitch and if things continued at this rate it wouldn’t matter if he caught it or not, Russia was going to win.
bring the shower to you.”
Tea was pleasant. Draco had forgotten how much he enjoyed herbology and was fascinated by Dubois’ stories. It had been a while since his last drink though and he was starting to wane. His head in particular was killing him.
“Thank you, and please call me Anthony. Neither of us are in school any longer.”
“You can’t seriously be mad about this.”
The older player flipped the beater off before going back to lacing up his cleats.
But he didn’t. An entire week passed and Asim didn’t say a single word to Draco.
“Please Draco.” There was something desperate in his voice.
They tidied up a little before getting ready for bed, throwing out several liquor bottles of various degrees of full. After taking a shower, Draco crawled into bed next to Pansy and prepared himself for a restless night of sleep, the first of what he was sure would be many.
Draco, of course, was the centre of the party. A couple of the Durmstrang players could be spotted sulking in the corner shooting him nasty looks, but most everyone was happy that Durmstang’s six year winning streak was finally over. And Draco’s teammates were happiest of all.
This has nothing to do with the story but Estruga Academia de Maxia is named after the Galician word for stinging nettle which is just as ridiculous as Hogwarts (named after the hogweed plant apparently). Their motto is
“Draco,” Potter emphasized his name, “you’re the best there is. You beat me.”
“I thought I was here to train.”
“Lumos.”
The 2000 European Cup was being hosted by France with the event taking place in Paris. Despite growing up in France, Draco had never been to Paris. He was excited to see the sites and do some shopping over the course of the three-week competition.
After the match Potter asked him out for a drink and Draco couldn’t say anything but yes.
Draco wanted to scream and yell, but he doubted his father would appreciate such a display. His father was disowning him in all but name, washing his hands clean of Draco for good. A part of him wished Father would just make it official, take away all of the pressure of living up to the Malfoy name. But Draco was grateful that he did not, because that would mean loosing everything.
Draco froze, she had no idea who he was. Why would she? It took a second before Draco composed himself enough to answer. “Our families were close when I was young. Though I haven’t seen him since I was a child.” It wasn’t even a lie, technically.
Draco knew he was doing his job but he wished Mr Barker would just let him go already. “Thank you, but I’ve already arranged to make the trip with a few of my new classmates,” not technically a lie, “and I’m supposed to meet them in Croix-Rousse,” also not a lie.
but make it robes. Harry's look was inspired by
The hangover the next day was worth it.
“Excellent work.” Dubois smiled and Draco basked in the praise.
“Take one drop every morning for a week and that should see you through the worst of it. The first day you take it you are likely to experience fatigue. After that things will start getting back to normal.”
Draco felt his heart racing as he drew closer to the snitch. The adrenaline rush was unlike anything he had ever felt and as his hand enclosed around the ball he was overcome with a sense of accomplishment, pride, and joy.
It took some time, but as the season progressed the Falcons continued to win more and more. And it wasn’t just Draco - the whole team was playing better than they had at the start of the season. They didn’t win the League Cup but they did manage to claw their way to the playoffs for the International Quidditch Tournament and from there they somehow made it into the knockout phase.
, and Draco felt a sensation like a splash of cold water. She stepped back to admire her work and applied one more spell. Seemingly satisfied, she gestured to the mirror.
Draco couldn’t fault her logic, actually he was kind of impressed. He debated for a moment if he should leave, but that felt too much like a retreat so he went back to applying his cosmetic charms.
Draco laughed, hollow and humourless. “You were trying to give me space? I thought you were avoiding me because you didn’t want to talk. And yeah a little warning would have been nice but I wasn’t upset to see you.” A small smile formed on his face.
“I want your cock in my ass.” Draco watched Harry’s eyes widen at his words.
When the snitch popped up again Draco and Harry shot off. The golden ball took a sharp dive, and Draco was reminded of his very first match with Potter only this time he was confident that he could do what needed to be done.
“You know, if you keep going this, you are gonna end up washed up by the time you’re twent…”
Draco laughed, "I don't think my father has touched a broom in his life."
“No, that’s all.”
“Is the Master ready?”
“I’ve got plans this weekend, but if you’re already planning to spend it in the library adding one more paper to your pile wouldn’t be such so bad.”
Draco agreed and reached out for his broom that someone had brought over. He flew up and rejoined his teammates who were all gathered near the goalposts.
“That is the opposite of what you need. You shouldn’t be by yourself. You know what happens.”
He must have spoken that last question out loud because Harry answered it. “You made it to the final against Krum. There’s no way I would’ve missed that.”
Dubois might not know what he was talking about but Draco knew he needed to cut back. It was almost July and he had a match coming up, not a serious one just a scrimmage for charity or some such. Still, he couldn’t continue drinking like he had been the past couple of weeks. It was time to pull his shit together.
“Believe me I’m trying.”
“I most certainly can. Merlin, I am good enough to beat you and no one is ever going to know.”
“I know next to nothing about quidditch, but I do know that you don’t make it to the European finals without earning your place.”
He walked onto the pitch at the last second and dismissed Thomas, the second-string seeker, himself. He knew that he looked like a hot mess, smudged eyeliner and rumpled hair. The sun was too bright and the crowd was too loud but Draco managed to keep the contents of his stomach inside his body so he took that as a win.
Draco figured Harry would talk about whatever was bothering him if he wanted to but he wasn’t going to push it. He went to work collecting plates and glasses to put under a cleaning charm in the kitchen.
“Jedi.” Draco gave him a confused look. “You know, like Star Wars.”
Draco waved his hands away. “Let me do it or we’ll be here all night. You take care of your own pants before I vanish them away.”
Draco enjoyed Asim’s stories of the trouble he got into as a kid, even if he was a bit jealous of the loving home Asim had clearly grown up in. When Asim talked about his mother, Draco couldn’t help but think of his own and wonder how different his life would be if she was still here.
“Wow,” he paused. “Well, I actually came over here because our seeker just got injured and can’t play out the rest of the season. We would be lucky if we could get you to sub.”
Draco was fuming now, “Forgive me
and the screams became mute. Narcissa levelled an angry look at her husband.
