"I don't think you would've liked it as much at the beginning," Draco says as he gets more comfortable on the floor. "Hate fucking has its perks, but I do prefer it when my partners like me at least a little."
Draco checks on Potter's head and offers him tea, and Potter sits still for both. The rest of the time, though, Potter paces and talks quietly to himself in Parseltongue. Quiet, smooth hisses that are nearly hypnotic in tone.
Malfoy startles, but as soon as he sees it's Harry, he curses and throws his head back onto his pillow.
"Malfoy," he says as he leans against the doorframe, his dress shirt straining across his pecs and shoulders, "what're you doing tonight?"
They have him wash two more times, until the water finally stays clear, and Harry feels almost newborn without the protection the layer of grime brought with it. As soon as he's lifted bodily from the tub, Crabbe and Goyle tear Harry's soaked clothes from his body. The fabric, worn and wet, tears away easily. Shivering in the bathroom, Harry suddenly worries that this isn't just about getting him clean, but perhaps something more sinister.
I remember the first time I knew something was amiss. There were too many men I didn't know at the Immingham Docks. Too many unfamiliar, uncomfortable faces. They didn't move like men used to the roll of the sea beneath their feet.
"Yeah. It scared the hell out of his secretary. She was giving him a briefing on his schedule when it happened. Nearly got her, too."
"Wait, hold on." Potter looks to their spelled window and its brilliant June sky, then back to Weasley. "Why's yours snowing? I thought you had a spring morning."
"Consider it an experiment," Draco says, closing what little gap remains between them. "And if you don't like the results, tell me to stop."
"Tonight," Draco had said as they stood on Harry's doorstep, their hands clasped together. "I'd like to come in."
"That's 'cause I am." Ron stands proudly in his Chudley Cannons' boxer shorts, hands on his hips and grinning. "And you're all going down."
The hand that's not currently pistoning into Draco's arsehole reaches around and clamps around Draco's cock, and though he doesn't want to, though he'd rather eat his own tongue, Draco cries out. "Oh, fuck, Potter. Please."
Harry jumps out of his seat before he's even aware he's moving, and by then, he's around the desk, arms wrapped around a stunned and laughing Ron. "Oh my God, you're going to get married! Ron!"
Ron grins. "Different departments means you're in the clear. It's why Hermione and I don't run into any issues. As long as she's in Magical Creatures, we're safe, and I'm going to ask her to marry me before she gets promoted out of it."
"How can I help you?" he asks, voice threaded with exhaustion and a tone that indicates he's ready to be screamed at for at least the hundredth time that day.
"Budge over," he says, already pulling his towels away before Harry can protest. "Let's see what you've got, Potter."
"You did plenty of things I didn't tell you to." Malfoy leans back in his chair and examines his nails. His voice is calm, but Harry can read the tension in Malfoy's body. "Don't think I know what you're really here for."
There were more deaths that morning, though Harry tells himself it was fewer than how many would have died if he hadn't given in. Even if he had been able to defeat Voldemort that morning, he had so many followers, and their fanaticism wouldn't have died with their leader. In the days after, as Muggleborn witches and wizards and their friends and families fled Britain, even more of Voldemort's sycophants came seeping out of the cracks like rot bursting forth from a corpse.
Malfoy groans and pushes off the wall. Harry notices Malfoy's weak-kneed stumble with something akin to glee. "I don't remember there being rules when we agreed to this."
"No, no." Malfoy frowns, then kicks the toe of his shoe against the dirt path. "That was fine. I'm just not sure how we're going to finish it, as it were."
Though Malfoy didn't ever say that much, Harry came to know the man. Unlike when they were children, Malfoy didn't seem to pay too much attention to his looks. His hair was usually well-styled, but there were times when it fell across his forehead in an untamed mass. He'd push it back, always with the hand he held his cigarette in, and Harry wondered on more than one occasion if Malfoy had ever accidentally lit his hair on fire that way. His clothes were plain but well-made. He seemed to favor leather jackets and long-sleeved shirts. Even in the heat of summer, he kept his arms covered. He'd lean them on the bartop, hold his forearms in his empty hands, and stare at the base of the mirror along the back wall. On days like those, Harry knew to keep the whisky coming and the ashtray emptied, and he let Malfoy speak whenever he found the words.
There are treats hidden in the plain fare that slides through Harry's door. Tiny bites of chocolate and candied fruits. A thick slice of beef. Fresh bread, still warm from the oven.
Did you know that Muggles know more about the vast expanse of space than they do about what's lurking in the sea? They can tell you the exact chemical composition of the farthest stars, but they can't tell you what thrives at the bottom of the Marianas Trench or how eels find each other in the vast expanse of the sea to mate and reproduce, though they're more than happy to dine on the bountiful results.
"Not yet, you're not," Blaise leers. Neville rolls his eyes, but Harry's not too drunk to miss the flush rising in Neville's cheeks.
But Draco does it again, and when he rinses the soap from Harry's hair, Draco lingers at the nape of Harry's neck and the curve of his shoulders. When he puts the manacles around Harry's wrists, before Crabbe and Goyle take him away, Draco runs his thumb over the raised scar of his name.
"Far from it," Draco said with a nervous laugh. "I just… I don't know what to do with this feeling. I'm afraid if I let it out, it'll ruin this. I'm so… I
the money. He just needed to not feel idle. Like he was at the top of the stairs, foot raised to take the next step down but not quite yet giving into gravity.
There's blood leaking from one of Potter's ears, and as Draco tries to think of a response, his green eyes roll back into his head and he passes out.
His office is blessedly empty when he enters. Throwing his coat onto the rack near the door, he straightens his Auror robes and settles behind his desk. There's a mountain of paperwork to dig through, unfortunately. He and his partner closed out a big case the week before, a potions ring in Belfast that had the local team scratching their heads for months before they finally called Draco's team in to work it. They had, of course, figured it out within a couple of days of their arrival, apprehended the suspects, and found enough evidence of wrongdoing to bury them with it.
For all of the magic that we possess, for all of the superiority we feel over Muggles, we're just as screwed by physics as they are.
"Spoilsport." Malfoy reaches for the nearly empty bottle of whisky and takes a healthy drink. Grimacing as he swallows, he offers it to Seamus, who waves it away. After Malfoy turns and holds the bottle out to Blaise, Seamus pulls his own (less empty) bottle from where he'd stashed it under a bed earlier.
Draco raises an eyebrow. "Well, last I checked, I'm a 24-year-old Wizard. A Gemini, if you're interested in Muggle astrology. Oh, yes, and your childhood nemesis."
Scrabbling with his free hand to pull Draco back, Harry groans and doesn't let him pull free from Harry's mouth. Instead, Harry presses forward until he's gagging on Draco's cock again, until his air disappears, and as tears fall from the corners of his eyes, he tries to let Draco know how good it is, how much Harry wants it, wants this.
Malfoy threw his hands up, his laughter edging towards hysterical. "'A drink,' he says. Bloody brilliant. I don't need a drink, Potter." He sighed and the sound was filled with rain clouds. "I need to go."
"Window's out of sorts," Harry offers helpfully, his blush fading but noticeable if you're looking for it (Draco absolutely is). "Been having weird weather all week. Didn't you hear?"
Draco ground down on Harry's lap, and as he lifted, he thrust against Harry's stomach. A slow, steady pressure that drove the both of them mad. Hands fumbled for hems. Fingers slipped and skidded on buttons. Their mouths only parted long enough for shirts to be discarded, for flesh to be revealed.
It'd hurt like a blow. "It's nothing wrong with you, either," Harry said softly, his hand cupping Draco's cheek, the most intimate touch they'd shared up to that point. "You're perfect exactly the way you are. We don't have to rush. Whenever you're ready, we'll—"
His hair brushes his shoulders, and his beard has grown out into an unmanageable mess. It tickles his lips when he breathes, and though he brushes it aside as he eats, he's always ending up with mouthfuls of hair with each bite.
He'd flinched at that, then downed his drink in one angry swallow. He didn't even bother to put out his cigarette, just left it burning in the ashtray as he grabbed his jacket, threw it over his shoulder, and left.
All of the eighth year boys have made that final butterfly-esque transformation into men, but out of all of them, Neville's changed the most. The last of his baby fat was melting away when Voldemort fell, and the summer heat seems to have finished the rest. His hours spent in the greenhouses this last year, pulling weeds and lugging about heavy bags of soil and fertilizer, hasn't hurt.
Look, he knows it's not an appropriate crush to have. Malfoy literally broke his nose a few years ago, and it's still got a bend in it he can feel when he runs his fingers over the bridge. Malfoy also had literal prisoners in his basement a year ago, even if they hadn't precisely been
Draco tries not to think about the place off of Diagon, or his last visit, or the way he'd love to go there right now and have someone fuck all of this flame out of his body.
They go on like that for what feels like weeks. Time has become a hazy concept for Harry. He knows that the sun rises and sets, that days are passing, but he's lost count since he moved from the cell to the bedroom. He counts meals, counts washes, and hopes that's enough to track time.
"Ah, fuck." Draco pulls back just a bit, just long enough for Harry to take a quick gasping breath, and then he pushes forward again. "We're going to talk about this after, you maniac."
There is an extremely long queue winding its way out of Building Services. Wix in various states of weather-related turmoil shift uncomfortably as it moves slowly forward. There are a few people who are drenched through, any
Draco's brief excitement viciously extinguished, he glares. "I'll have you know that I'm a very busy wizard with a very fully social calendar."
Potter's head lifts, brow furrowed. "Yeah, and German and a bit of Russian, though my accent's shite. I've been working on Spanish here and there, but we don't have much need of it right now, so." He shrugs and goes back to reading.
"It's a bit hard to think you're lying when we're in a bloody safe house that we can't leave, and you're quoting Muggle literature and making me tea without magic."
They continue working quietly, and though Draco is getting a bit uncomfortable with the growing heat in the office, he forces himself to ignore it. He's always in proper uniform, unwilling to put a hair out of place and risk possible censure. It's been years since he joined the force, but there's a small, insistent voice that whispers through his mind that he's always just one step away from being tossed out of the DMLE on his arse. Unable to ignore neither the voice nor the pooling sweat beneath his arms, Draco finds the knock on their office door a welcome distraction.
"We do not discuss the place off Diagon at work, Parkison." Draco steals a chip from her plate. "And no, I will not tell you where it is."
"We're not together," Harry hisses. "It's just… You remember that dumb game we played when we were drinking about a month back?"
Harry quickly bottles the potion, giving his hands something to do other than fret uselessly (or perhaps dip below his waist to ease a bit of the ache). With three neatly dispensed portions set on the table and the cauldron just needing a thorough washing, he hefts the cauldron's weight over to a line of sinks at the far end of the room and sets about scrubbing what little remains of the potion away. It's enough of a distraction that by the time he's done with the job and the cauldron is set out to dry with the others, his libidio has calmed down enough for him to walk comfortably again.
When Harry comes, it's violent and overwhelming, and he can't help himself from shouting Draco's name, though he cuts it off after the first syllable, unwilling to give up that much of his secret.
Still, it does mean that Draco has been saddled with the majority of the filing to go with the glory. His partner is brilliant in the field—even Draco can't deny it, though he sometimes very much wants to—but utter shite at the administrative side of Auroring. It's his unwelcome burden, dotting all of their I's and crossing all of their T's, but it's work that must be done, and Draco's not one to leave necessary work to less capable hands.
"I know why he does it," Greyback shouts from across the room. His werewolf hearing makes him an inveterate eavesdropper. "He likes Potter on his hands and knees."
As his suspect hands her coat check ticket to the clerk waiting at the front of the restaurant, her hands barely trembling, Harry knows what he should do. They've been trailing this woman for months now, and he's got enough evidence that, along with her behaviour upon seeing him, he should have enough to make an arrest and possibly even get a search warrant. But his traitorous eyes dart from her over to the bathrooms, and hoping that she'll think he was there by pure coincidence, he does what he wants to do instead.
It's the only interaction Harry has during the day, and with the mindless, numbing hours that stretch between Draco's visits, Harry starts looking forward to those brief moments of connection.
"I'm going to kill him," Pansy says, her rant continuing though Draco's missed a good portion of it. "Weasley swore to me that your office was sweltering, and if I don't melt through before tea time, I will kill him."
For a heartbeat of time, Harry considers the likelihood of conviction and the length of his resulting sentence if he were to jump across the desk and strangle Ron with his own smugness. But with a twenty year minimum for killing an officer of the law, Harry quickly casts the idea aside and says, "Fuck you," instead.
He gives up on being quiet after that, especially with how long it takes Harry to stop laughing into Draco's hip.
There's a shout from the dance floor, and Potter glances towards it like someone hunted. When the crowd starts singing along with the indistinct pop song, the tension radiating through his body eases. "Why are you here, then?"
"Does it matter?" Potter asks as he rises to his own feet. Where Draco's all tense anger, Potter looks like he's resigned to whatever is going to happen next. His eyes are tired when he meets Draco's gaze. "Just forget you heard anything, Malfoy. It doesn't matter anyway. I'll be gone in three days."
"They did a poor job glamouring you," the man continues. "They covered the obvious scars, but not the important ones." His breath coasts across Harry's ear. "You mustn't tell lies."
Malfoy's eyes trail around the circuit before he lifts his chin, pointing towards the edge of the Forest. "There's a good path that way. Not too far in that you need to worry about whatever's lurking in there, but pleasant enough for a walk."
Harry groans, but a moment later, the ropes disappear. His hands rub at the indents where they used to be, and he presses a gentle kiss to Draco's nape. "Was I too rough with you?"
"Goodbye, Weasley," Draco says, splashing over to close the door—gently—in Weasley's face. As Draco turns around to face Harry, he reaches behind himself to lock it.
Where Neville is all thick torso and strong arms, Malfoy is whipcord-lean. He's got a runner's build, everything about his body tuned like a well-maintained machine. His arms aren't thick, but as he pulls his shirt over his head, they ripple with strength. So does his stomach, a low, slow wave of clenching muscle and smooth skin as he straightens. Unlike Harry, Malfoy folds his shirt carefully, and Harry quickly becomes fascinated by the elegant motion of his fingers on the white fabric.
"I hope you're struggling to find a suitable synonym for amazing. Maybe 'life altering' or 'paradigm shifting.'"
His potion dutifully darkens, and when he turns the burner off completely, he's pleasantly surprised to realize that he's actually done a bang up job on the brew. Head lifting with barely repressed glee, he finds Malfoy leaning his hip against the other side of the table, that damned eyebrow still raised and his mouth kicked into a small, quiet smile.
"I swear," Harry says, flushing from more than just the growing warmth in the room, "I didn't mean anything by it."
Deciding that the best course of action is to plunge firmly into denial, Draco starts working on the transfer papers. They're relatively easy, considering all of the bureaucratic loops he normally has to jump through, and he finishes and sends them off for processing before Potter returns with the financial records. When he smiles at Draco, the sheaf of papers in his hand flapping triumphantly, heat curls low in Draco's gut and around the still open mouth of his shirt. Sweat almost immediately drips down his neck and into the hollow of his throat, and if he were paying more attention to Potter's gaze than the sudden influx of warmth, he might have seen those green eyes track the path of moisture as it clung to his skin.
. It does make me look the part, though, doesn't it? And it makes people fear me, more than they did before. There's something powerful about a beautiful thing ruined, isn't there?
Draco gets some water boiling and digs out what is likely to be horribly stale tea. His preservation charm, which should have been keeping it fresh, is gone. It's hard to keep those long-running spells up without regular maintenance, and Draco makes a mental note to have one of his subordinates adjust the rotation so that they don't have any more failures.
"I know it's been years, and things were a bit… complicated when we last spoke, but I've spent the past few years trying to come to terms with what I did when we were children. There are an awful lot of things I could say about that, though I don't believe it needs to be said. But for all of the harm I caused you, that my family caused you, I wanted to apologize. I know amends can't be made, but I wanted to at least say the words." He took another drink, then tapped his fingers on the bartop before pushing his seat back. "Thank you for the drink, Potter, and for listening."
Perhaps worst of all, Malfoy's jacket is made of tweed with leather patches on the elbows, a white shirt and black waistcoat underneath, and Harry has to fight down the rush of heat the courses through him at the thought of Malfoy, all prim and properly put together, being ruined by Harry's hands and mouth.
Harry's demeanour doesn't change but he feels Draco tense next to him. "I didn't ask your opinion, dog."
He's on his feet before he realizes it, his tea cup spilled on the floor next to his feet. "Last night, did you mean it?"
Threaded through them all, though, are the deeper riddles. The questions that have no answer, no matter how many ways you ask them.
He forgets about it all in the sickening aftermath of Dumbledore's death, in the rush down the Astronomy Tower stairs, in the boiling anger at Snape and his betrayal.
Malfoy continues to wash his hands, grey eyes focused as his fingers tangle together, then coast over the back of his hands, then along his blunt thumbs.
The worst that could happen is that Harry spends the rest of his day trying to think of a way to ask Malfoy out without it being weird. The practical portion of the seminar is not nearly as easy as the lecture, and Harry's excitement over Ron's news, his inconveniently fierce attraction to Malfoy, and his nerves all blend together into a complete and total inability for Harry to do anything right.
Potter lifts a hand to his own throat. The sleeves of his shirt tighten. Fingers dance over his own button, and then it slides free, persuaded by a gentle touch to fall apart. Potter sighs. "That does help, doesn't it?"
Harry took the cigarette from between Draco's outstretched fingers and extinguished it with a quickly cast spell. He Vanished the butt, then put his empty hand on the center of Draco's chest. His heartbeat felt the same as when Harry put his hand on the bar rail for the first time.
Potter's talking to himself in Parseltongue again. He normally does it under his breath, but with Draco seemingly fast asleep, he's louder than usual.
For a quiet, terrifying moment, Draco doesn't move. Harry kisses Draco with every ounce of love that he feels, desperate and afraid that he's read this all wrong. But then Draco groans beneath him, and his hands are everywhere on Harry. Tangling in his hair, pulling at his clothes, feeling over the unbroken, unblemished skin of his neck. Draco laughs, then moans, then laughs again. His lips slide over Harry's mouth, his cheeks, his jawline, until Draco's face is in Harry's shoulder and he's sobbing again, his hands fisted in Harry's shirt.
"Christ," Potter mutters as he takes his Muggle-style leather jacket off. "It's absolutely pissing down out there."
shows 5 p.m., Draco is out of his seat, grabbing his robes, and throwing them on as he wishes Potter a half-hearted goodbye. The hallway is a chilly assault on his senses, and the wet, October air outside is worse still. But even as his skin cools and the heat of the office fades to nothing more than a memory, Draco's body burns.
Draco twists his wrist, pulling another groan from Harry's chest as he starts to jerk Harry slowly. "Wouldn't dream of it."
Draco's mouth opens, but Voldemort's hand stops his protest. "Yes, Draco. I do believe it's time for some entertainment. Why don't you show us what the Boy Who Lived is good for these days?" When Draco doesn't move, Voldemort's tone goes hard and unyielding. "Now."
His collar bites into his neck. Draco's fingers bite into his hair. There's yelling all around them, voices shouting at Draco to stop, to reconsider. Harry can still taste blood on his tongue from when he bit Draco's hand as he forced it into Harry's mouth.
Harry doesn't know what drives him to the ground, but his knees are digging into the dirt before he realises it. Malfoy curses again, then buries his fingers in Harry's curls, forcing his face up.
Harry barely hears the man's receding footsteps over the blood pounding in his ears. His rigger loosens the knots around Harry's wrists enough that the painful arch of his back is eased and he can get to his feet without falling. Her hand is gentle on his bonds as she leads him, still blindfolded, through the club and into a private room.
, Harry quickly found himself bored. Hermione and Ron would drop in for visits, but Ron was still with the Aurors, and Hermione was getting ready for Hogwarts, and neither of them really knew how to talk to Harry in the town where his parents died. It hung around the room with them, like a cobweb no one could see but could feel brushing against their face whenever they walked past. It didn't matter how many times they batted it away, it always came back, settling spider-silk thin across their cheeks, a niggling nothingness that refused to go away.
Ron's still sitting at his desk. There's butcher paper with a half-eaten sandwich sitting on top of it by his elbow, and his stack of finished paperwork has grown since Harry left this morning. Blue eyes a bit glazed when they rise to take in Harry, Ron's gaze turns laser focused.
Voldemort looks at Draco, considering, then takes his seat again. "That is good to hear, Draco. You've always been a more bidding follower than your father. Always willing to do as you're told." He gives Lucius a pointed glance. "And when I tasked you with the single greatest mission of your life, you came through. Perhaps I should not leave Mr Potter in your father's care, but rather in yours."
They run together for another half hour before Harry's legs can't keep going. He slows down, panting, then folds over to place his hands on his knees.
"You." He didn't mean for the confession to come out, but now that it's hanging there between them, he doesn't want to take it back. "Damn it, Malfoy, I want you."
"I had the connections and information they needed, and they had my freedom. It seemed an easy choice at the time."
Blaise is just as bad. He hasn't looked away from Neville since they started, though Neville is pointedly looking in the opposite direction . But judging by the way his stomach keeps clenching, Neville knows that Blaise is watching.
The washcloth is thick with soap and glides across Harry's skin. He drags it over his pulse points, his throat and wrists. They're the only places that Draco touches, even briefly, and Harry pretends that his hands are Draco's, that the pleasure he draws from his body is brought into the light by Draco rather than himself. Head thrown back against the edge of the tub, he circles his nipples until they're overly sensitive peaks. Soap trails down his chest to his stomach, and Harry's hand follows after. His cock is erect, but he doesn't touch it. He teases himself instead, dragging the washcloth over the junction where his thigh meets hip, down to the heavy weight of his balls, then back up the other side. Again and again, until his skin burns hot enough that it should boil the water away.
He spent months in Budapest cracking an illegal potions ring that specialized in Amortentia. He was deep undercover for almost a year investigating a trafficking ring that specialized in half-blooded Veela and Werewolves. There were three excruciating weeks in Russia as he and another operative smoked out the beginnings of a Neo-Death Eater cult. Draco put his heart and soul — or what little remained of both — into undoing as much of the evil Voldemort had put into the world as he could.
Harry's going to let it go—no harm, no foul—until he hears another moan and is able to track where it's coming from.
With a flick of his wand, he pulls the curtains around his bed shut, and a moment later there's a familiar pop as he casts
"It's rather a lot, isn't it?" Sighing, Draco got to his feet. "I can understand it being a bit overwhelming, my outranking you, but don't let it distract you from me also being incredibly wealthy and attractive."
"It was burning up in here an hour ago." Harry says it like he's trying to calm a wild animal. "Honestly, just stay for a bit. You'll see. That is…" His eyes dart to Draco, eyebrow raised.
Harry's thrusts go uneven, slow, until they're both still and panting against the brick wall. There's a long moment of quiet between them, and then Draco groans.
thing, not a thing that anyone else would notice, but Harry's keyed up afterwards, and Malfoy's always been able to get his goat. So when Malfoy walks a bit too close to Harry as they pass each other in the hallway to the dormitory, or Malfoy makes sure his leg brushes against Harry's during Potions, or he drops something and bends over at the waist, Harry
"Such a shame," Draco says as he stares across the lunchroom again while Potter tries to return his lunch tray to the cleaning rack. "I really should have less interest in intelligence when it comes to my men."
Harry kneels down and places one of his spit-slicked fingers to the tip of Draco's cock. The touch is like lightning through his body, and Draco arches up, groaning. Harry's touch stays the same, just one fingertip resting on Draco's cockhead. The pad grows slicker as precome leaks from Draco, a string of white that stretches between them as Harry takes his hand away.
An instant, a blip of time that might've otherwise gone unnoticed. But not by Draco. Not after years of spycraft, of learning to read the hidden emotions that his marks weren't even aware of themselves. Draco Malfoy was damned good at his job, and his job was, at least partially, reading people.
Grateful for the distraction from Potter's… everything, Draco picks up the murder case from his desk and stands just enough to hand it over to Potter. "I've got a strong suspicion the spouse was involved, though I think the original investigator was correct when they confirmed the man's alibi. But if you look at the financial records in there, there's a series of recurring transfers in the months leading up to his wife's death that could be enough to hire a hitman."
Harry kissed Draco quiet, his heart clenching in his chest like a fist. It ached, and his blood boiled, and he wanted nothing more than to throw Draco down on the couch and ravish him like he was begging to be.
the seventh of October, 2009. It's wet and windy outside, the temperature that awful mix between cold and mild where everything clings and feels musty. Draco shakes rain from his hair. There's only a thin sheen of it, but it's enough to annoy. He'd had a
"I'm going to marry Hermione." Ron's grin is infectious and so full of warmth, Harry can feel it to his toes. "And you're going to ask Malfoy out for a coffee." Before Harry can protest, Ron holds up a finger. "Consider it a wedding present."
Now that he's been here for months, Crabbe and Goyle trust Harry enough to know that he won't run. They leave him alone in the bathroom, but they cast a surveillance spell before they leave him unsupervised. Harry knows they don't check it—he'd said more than a few unkind things about them without any repercussions before—but he can feel the magic sparking over his skin as he bathes. Someone is tapped into the spell, and since Harry only sees three people when he's not on display for the Dark Lord, he assumes.
"Harry," he gasps, and Potter does it again, a gentle hint of pain that has Draco throbbing in his trousers.
"Hermione owes me 10 Galleons for this," Ron says, still choking back giggles. "Merlin, she's going to be furious."
"You saw our target when we walked in, yeah?" Potter says, still not looking up from his menu. "Sitting near the door, back to us currently if you want to look."
"We're playing a very dangerous game here, Potter," Draco whispers into his ear. "If you do what you're told, I might be able to get you out of here."
There's something about the piercing purity of agony that makes his pleasure that much sweeter, but even as he learns his body and this side of himself, there's something missing.
Goyle laughs darkly and Crabbe hisses something derogatory that Harry can't hear over the deafening ringing in his ears.
He looks around the room, gazing out over the top of his glasses, and his eyes pause whey they land on Harry. Corner of his mouth raised just slightly, he continues.
"It's because you poisoned Jefferies," Ron says without looking up. "I'm just surprised it's not worse."
It's been years since Harry last saw Malfoy. While they both work in the Ministry, they haven't bumped into each other, and though the Auror Corps certainly spends time in the Potions department, Harry hasn't ever been there for more than a supply run. He hasn't been
Draco scowls. "Well, I'm ever so pleased you're fine. Why the fuck do you keep sounding like a punctured tire?"
The office is like an oven, waves of heat pounding against his body and drawing more sweat to the surface. It clings to the curves of his shoulders, the dip of his elbow, the tendons at his wrists. It pools in his palms, and as he watches, a drop falls from his fingertips to land on the desk.
paperwork?" He brushes his lips against Draco's. "At my place. Where there's a very nice bed, which is much softer than this floor."
"Pleasure is all mine," Draco says before taking another drag. "You out slumming it tonight, or were you looking for me specifically?"
"No!" Draco grabs Harry's hands, then stares at his wrists before throwing them away. "No, we'll find another way. I didn't go to all of this trouble just to kill you in the end. You're going to make it through this bloody war, or so help me…"
"Bloody Gryffindors," he mutters as he stumbles to his feet. "Always getting themselves into places they shouldn't bloody well be."
He takes Draco's cock in his mouth, smooth and easy like he's done it a million times before. His hands rest gently on Draco's thighs, and as he moves his lips and tongue over Draco's prick, he feels it harden in his mouth. His own prick grows in response, but this isn't about Harry's pleasure, it's about Draco's.
"Don't stop on my account," he says, waving at Malfoy. "I'm going to stretch a bit and then hit the showers."
Laughing, he kisses Draco's nape again, then pulls out. It makes the both of them groan. Draco winces, then sighs when Harry presses his fingers against Draco's sore and puffy hole. Harry's magic is cool and gentle as he heals the abused flesh.
for men who spend so much of their time on the sea. There's something about being out here, lost among the waves and the stars, the whole world empty except for you and your ship and whatever sleeps beneath it, that makes you appreciate land all the more. When you smell it — the deep, rich loam of earth — it draws something out of you. Makes you want to
Harry presses at the underside of Draco's cockhead, holds his wand there as his other hand reaches for Draco's balls and the cockring. Everything is swimming around Draco, lost in the sea of overwhelming pleasure. He's going to drown in it. He's going to die.
Harry likes to think it's because he's trailed his hand down to Draco's wrist again and forced his fingers beneath the cuff to rest against Draco's pulse point.
As soon as his belt slips free, Harry reaches for Draco's fly and opens it with a teasing brush of knuckles against Draco's cock. He doesn't pull either Draco's trousers or pants down, just reaches into the gaping fabric to wrap confident fingers around Draco's prick. Hips jerking into the touch, Draco hisses in a breath as Harry laughs quietly before taking Draco's mouth in another bruising kiss. He's dizzy with heat and lust, but even with his eyes closed, he finds Harry's fly and fumbles it open enough for him to slide his hand inside. Harry's pants are damp. Draco isn't sure if it's from sweat or precome but can't make himself care to find out. All he cares about is slipping his hand through the slit in the front of Harry's pants and touching the hot skin beneath.
Draco is going to come in his trousers in the middle of the fanciest restaurant he's ever been in because Potter is a polyglot. He wonders, almost sick with desire, what filthy things the man would say in each language and how far his vocabulary stretches.
"Sir, if I could, I would." He sighs, then looks to the next person in line. "Ma'am, if you want to come forward. How can I help you?"
It's so hard, it aches. Pleasure is rooted low and deep in his center, its tangled roots wrapped around every painful inch of his overworked body. Even the cool air of the room is too much stimulation. He can't tell if he's sweating from the strain on his body or the fever in his blood.
"I'm so sorry," Draco sobs. He rests his head in the center of Harry's shoulders, his tears hot and wet against Harry's nape. "Gods, I'm so sorry, Harry. I wish…"
Draco mirrors his motion, coming around the side of his desk so that there's only a small expanse of floor between them. "It's us."
He'd wiped that bit of sweetness away with his thumb, then snuck it into his own mouth, frantic over the faint hint of Draco's taste that it brought with it.
Harry snapped his fingers, and Draco leaned forward into the flame between Harry's forefinger and thumb. As the tobacco lit, Harry watched with wonder as Draco's eyes slid shut, crinkling at the edges with his smile.
Potter slides the pad of his finger across Draco's hole, then presses against it. Not hard enough to penetrate, but enough to tease at it. It makes Draco's knees lock, makes his head go fuzzy, and then he's coming down Potter's throat without any warning like it's the first time Draco's ever had his dick sucked.
"Best two out of three," Malfoy says as the pressure of Harry's arm across his chest lessens. "And I won't count the first time against you. Clean slate, as it were."
His pace is brutal, efficient. Potter hits Draco's prostate every fucking time, like he knows exactly what he's doing, like he knows exactly how to wipe away any and all shame Draco might be feeling.
Neville finds his wand first and casts it for Ron. The counter floats in the middle of the loose circle they've made in their dormitory, and as they edge closer to it, they each get a hand around their cocks and start.
As Pansy starts a well-worn conversation, Draco searches for Potter one more time. He's nearly out of the lunch room, his broad shoulders and trim waist easily recognizable even across the wide, busy space. If it wouldn't give it away what Draco was doing to Pansy, he'd sigh again. Such a pity that the last man to fuck Draco hadn't been anything like Potter. No, that man knew exactly what to do when presented with something as glorious as Draco Malfoy's arse.
Draco leans back on his heels, though it's a bit odd to feel the soles of his shoes digging into his bare arse as he does it. Carefully, he removes Potter's other shoe, then pulls his own trousers up over his arse.
"A few pounds lighter. Maybe their Oyster card is missing, maybe a coupon for a free coffee or sandwich. Maybe their ID."
His smile is soft and genuine when he taps the arm of his glasses. "Can't see for shit without them. So, how are those cases looking?"
"If you're about to say something like 'it's never happened before' or 'my stamina is usually much better than that,' let me save you your breath. We're eighteen, Potter. A hair trigger is nothing to be ashamed about."
"What've we got today, Malfoy?" Potter asks as he slips into his robes and starts doing up the fastenings. Draco doesn't note how well they sit on his well-muscled shoulders or how nimble his fingers look on the black toggles.
"Oh, Gods, yes." Draco thrust into the expanse of Harry's palm. Groaning, he kissed Harry again and again. "Touch me, please."
They lay in the dark together, Draco's face buried in Harry's neck, nose pressed into the space between collar and skin. His body shakes, and though he's silent when he does it, Harry knows Draco is crying. Harry's shoulder is wet with tears, and he pulls Draco as close as he can.
And then he's coming, too. Hot, heavy spurts that spatter across the tile and slide down to the floor where they mix with the water and with Harry's semen, until it's all washed away.
Grinning, Draco asks, "Whyever not?" before leaning in to kiss the surprised laugh from Harry's mouth.
Harry twists his wrist, just like Malfoy did, and laughs when Malfoy's entire body shivers. He does it again and again, loving the way that Malfoy can't stop his response.
Harry can't wipe the image from his mind, can't stop himself from filling in the form hidden by green flames with Malfoy's lithe body.
The night before Voldemort's supposed to arrive for his next visit, Draco slips into Harry's cell in the dark of night. Harry awakens as soon as the door opens, his body on high alert until he recognizes Draco's footsteps and he relaxes.
"Yeah, can do," Potter says, the case file tucked under his sleeveless arm. "You get the transfer paperwork in to Robards so we can get started when I get back."
The safe house is small. There's one bathroom with a shower, toilet, and corner sink. There's only one bedroom — these hidey-holes are only expected to be used by one operative at a time — so Draco does the gallant thing and lets Potter have it. He's got a head injury, after all, and Draco wants to be able to watch the front door, the fireplace, and the wards. That's best done from the front room and its couch, and when night falls and Potter disappears behind his door, Draco lays awake, staring at the ceiling and wondering if he can speed up time and have this over and done with.
"Fuck." Harry locks his knees, barely holding his orgasm back. "Whenever I get in the shower, I think of you. Even when I don't want to."
Potter's eyes drop to Draco's mouth, then lower. "You know," he says, his voice growing as dark as the night around them, "I'm not unreasonable."
Desperate, Harry pulls away, striping his cock faster and faster. "Draco, please," he says through his ruined throat, the words more a rasp than a plea. "I want to feel it."
His knees give out, and he stumbles to the floor, grabbing at Potter's face and pulling him into another kiss. It's sloppy, and he can taste himself on Potter's lips, but Draco doesn't care. He pushes Potter back until he falls onto the floor, and then Draco's got Potter's trousers open and Potter's cock in his mouth, and he doesn't really care about anything but ruining Potter's life with his tongue.
But though I've been misguided in my life, I've never been an idiot. And I knew if I kept you guessing, if I kept you looking, you'd eventually come to me.
There was a man I knew, Johnny or Benny or something equally as traditional and coy. I'm rubbish with names when all I want to do is fuck. Anyway, he would greet me with a smile and after we were done discussing the shipment, he would take me into the warehouse, push me against a wall, and fuck my thighs. He liked to pull my hair when he did it, and I can't say I hated it. My favorite memories are of when he'd let me do him, though. Those thighs of his… they'd press around my cock like they were made for it. I'd push into that muscled clench, his balls brushing over the top of my prick, his drooling precome with every one of my thrusts...
There's a new collar hidden with the shirt, a thing of supple brown leather with a delicate pattern of peacock feathers embossed into the material.
of it, had always upset him. To him, Godric's Hollow was a life stolen. He should have grown up knowing these streets and these people as well as the back of his hand. With every broken cobblestone he walked around, he resented not knowing what shattered it in the first place. There were a million tiny stories that he should have learned growing up here. But Wormtail had broken his promise, and Voldemort had broken Harry's family, and now, years later, Harry resented the concept of the place as much as he loved the reality of it.
It's an immediate relief. Air breathes across his clavicle and the dip of his throat, gentle and soothing like a lover's touch. He tries to bite back the sigh of contentment, but it escapes and eases its way through the office. Potter, whose head has been bent over his paperwork since Pansy left, raises his eyes, mouth quirked into a smile that goes stoney when he sees Draco.
"I always want you to be rough with me when we do these things, Harry. I thought you'd caught on by now."
"I'm so sorry, sir, but I don't see your name on our list, and I'm afraid we don't have any openings available tonight. I could make a reservation for you for the next available date?"
He got used to the fantasy, of pretending that his hand was Harry's, that the groans he sometimes couldn't help but let escape weren't his.
Draco's stomach twists, and he sets his fork down, no longer hungry. "I contain multitudes, Potter. What's our target doing?"
Besides becoming Harry's owner, Draco becomes his jailer. He arrives with Harry's breakfast, lunch, and dinner, sliding them through a specially constructed slot in the door with a hissed "Food, Potter," before disappearing again.
Draco stands and pushes his chair back in. His shirt catches on the top, and he feels it pull out from his waistband. Turning awkwardly to uncatch it, he finds he can't quite reach. "Merlin, of course."
Still, it's a solid thirty minutes before he even sees the door to Building Services, and his stomach is starting to complain about his light breakfast that morning. Idly dreaming about lunch, he shuffles forward, step by step, until he finally reaches a very beleaguered looking wizard whose hair and robes are dark with sweat.
He doesn't bother to grab his jacket from the rack, just opens the door and hurries into the hallway, the door slamming shut behind him. Uncertain what's gotten Potter's knickers in a twist—and Draco is decidedly
"Forty-three," Draco says. Harry had told him to keep count. There's a clock in the corner of the room, a Muggle one that Draco still struggles to read, even on the best of days.
"I'd take Knockturn duty at this point," Potter says with a lopsided grin. It absolutely doesn't do things to Draco's stomach. "Even with the rain."
Malfoy's visits never had a pattern to them. Sometimes, he'd go weeks without dropping in. Other times, he would be there every day. He never had much to say, and Harry never much felt the need to pry. Running a pub had taught Harry to wait. If someone had something they needed to say, they'd get to it eventually.
It glowed from years of hands on its rail. Names were carved into the top, some worn down by age, others clearly added before the place closed two years earlier. There were cubicles underneath for bottles, shelves for glasses and steins, bins for ice. The bar was somehow neat and orderly when everything else in the place was the opposite. It was the heart of the pub, and as Harry trailed his fingers along the rail, he could feel it beating.
"Seems I won our little contest," Malfoy says when they break apart again. "I think I've earned a reward for that."
"What're you doing, Malfoy?" Potter asks, his breath even hotter than the air of the room as it passes across his skin.
Losing himself to the straightforward work of filling in forms, Draco almost manages to ignore the growing heat. It's a full hour before he's forced to undo the mother of pearl buttons at his wrist and roll up his sleeves. He hates having his forearms bared, but he's starting to swim in sweat, and as long as they keep their door closed, he should have enough warning to cover his Dark Mark before anyone can comment.
"Okay." The word feels distant, as if someone else said it rather than Draco. But Potter's smile widens, and Draco knows he's sealed his own fate with those two syllables.
"I know… No, of course not, that's not…" Potter sighs, then stands. "I'll be back in an hour, yeah?"
Eventually, Draco falls into an exhausted sleep, and Harry lets himself pretend that this is just a normal night, one where there's no Voldemort, no resistance. That they're not lying on a bare mattress in a formerly fine room, but rather in their own bedroom, in their own home, and that Draco loves Harry back.
"So," Draco asks once the door closes behind them. His hand drops from Harry's mouth slowly. "You've a choice to make, Potter."
Potter starts to speak, but his words come out garbled, a mix of clear syllables and cascading hisses. He curses, then gags.
"It's Parseltongue." Potter pushes himself up and sits back on his heels. "It slips out sometimes. When I'm hurt or stressed. Or pissed off."
"Whatever I want." There's a pressure on his ropes, and Harry's shoulders scream. "I want a lot of things."
"Brilliant." Potter holds a folder out to Draco. "Here, this has all of the details of the op tonight. Where to meet, what to wear, who and what we're looking for. It's a bit posh, so if you need to leave early to get dressed up, I've already cleared it with your department head. I'll meet you there around 8 PM, if that's alright with you?"
And then Potter had put his arm across Draco's throat in a dark and smokey club, and Draco had seen it.
"Why are you misquoting Shakespeare?" Potter whips his glasses off, then starts hissing quietly to himself. "What the fuck is going on?"
"Just something I've always wanted to do," Draco said as he shoved Harry's ruined shirt down his arms. "Get naked."
Their audience is jeering around them, throwing slurs and insults at Harry like sinners throw stones. But all Harry can hear is Draco's harsh, panting breath and his own heart pounding in his ears. Though they're surrounded, there's something impenetrable around them, a bubble of privacy that no number of eyes can break through.
Draco knows what Potter's intimating, knows the direction this could go. "What're you suggesting, Potter?"
When he pulls his hand free this time, Draco opens his eyes sluggishly. It would be unacceptable for him to miss this.
Harry laughs. Malfoy's acerbic wit startles Harry into laughter more often than not these days. As his eyes finally settle on Malfoy, though, the sound dies in his throat.
He made them tea, though neither of them drank it. The mugs sat steaming on the coffee table as he and Draco kissed on the couch. Harry wasn't sure where to put his hands, though he'd kissed plenty of people before. None of them left Harry feeling as on fire and terrified as Draco did. Part of him was afraid that if he pushed too hard, too fast, that the dream of it all would shatter, popped like a bubble grabbed too quickly from the air.
It's fucking hot, and not just because of the water and the steam. Malfoy's got a gorgeous cock, and he's got gorgeous hands, and the combination is brutal. It's an assault against Harry's desire to win, to outlast Malfoy in this game of perverted chicken they're playing at. There's a pearlescent tear of precome at the tip of Malfoy's cock, and when he swipes it away with his thumb, Harry moans.
He needs something to take his mind off of the memories. So when the weekend finally rolls around, Harry forgoes the Hogsmeade visit and chooses to head out to the Quidditch pitch to run laps.
It has its intended effect. Draco's pupils widen, and a blush blooms beautifully across his cheeks, down his neck, and under the collar of his shirt. If Harry had to guess, it goes all the way down.
Harry held Draco close, unbothered by the mess between them. There would be time to clean it up later. Harry soothed Draco's trembling body, running his clean hand up and down Draco's back and murmuring soft words into his temple.
It takes him a moment to catch up to Harry, who's already warm and loose from running for awhile. But he's a bit tired from it, and Malfoy's fresh and keeps pace easily, trailing just behind Harry. They fall into an odd synchronicity, their footfalls beating out a staccato rhythm that lulls Harry back into the blank, empty space that running brings him. He never figured he'd be able to keep that quiet state of mind with someone else, but it's easy with Malfoy.
Draco falls asleep listening to Potter's unending monologue on more than one occasion. As he drifts into unconsciousness, he imagines what Potter's saying.
Ron stares at Harry like he's grown another head and it's suddenly become visible. "So, you and Malfoy, you were having some kind of… masturbation marathon. A competitive cocking. A battle of the bulge."
Unable to speak, Draco nods. A moment later, the glass is at his mouth, and he turns his head to the side to let Harry pour a careful sip into Draco's parched mouth. They stay that way for a long while, Draco taking tiny gulps of water, Harry making sure none of it spills. When Draco pulls away, Harry sets the glass aside.
Whatever words followed, Harry didn't hear them. He was too lost in the feel of Draco's mouth on his, the too-forceful press of desperate lips and grasping hands. He fell into it as easily as taking the next step down a staircase, as easily as giving into gravity. His hands were under Draco's coat, wrapped around his back to draw him closer to Harry's body. Draco's shirt bunched in Harry's fists, and though he knew it must be uncomfortable, that having Harry's hands wrapped up in Draco's clothes must be less than pleasant, Harry refused to let go.
Harry's mouth moves from Draco's mouth to the hinge of his jaw, then down the line of his neck. His tongue flashes across the muscles there, licking salt from Draco's skin. The bite of his teeth against Draco's throat is like a shot of ice water, and the way it makes him shiver aches.
"That's enough, Fenrir," Voldemort says lazily. He's on his fourth glass of wine, and his words are slurred with drink. "Though you make a fair point. You keep your pet in good care, Draco. He must be very… obedient."
Another mistake, because Harry is ashamed to realize that time has been incredibly kind to the man. Malfoy's wearing a pair of thin glasses that make his gray eyes shine like silver. His features have softened a bit with age, though they're still distinctly pointy. His cheeks are lacking the sunken, grief-struck look they used to carry, though, and there are laugh lines bracketing his mouth. Harry can't remember Malfoy laughing. Sneering, definitely, mocking him with a quirked corner of his mouth, absolutely. But as Harry wracks his mind for it, he can't find even a moment of Malfoy's mouth curled with laughter.
She starts walking down the hallway, and he falls in beside her. "Very much so. Weasley got trapped under a bit of an avalanche earlier, though, so that brought me a tiny bit of joy. If I die of pneumonia, though, don't think the Ministry won't be hearing from my ghost. Ah, here we are."
After another stroke, Harry says, "Cheating," and lowers his weight onto Malfoy's thighs. They're close enough to touch now, the slightest shift of either of their bodies enough to bring their fingers into contact, and needing to win (needing to touch Malfoy), Harry does it.
Much like Draco, Potter's wearing a lighter uniform than last week. But unlike Draco, Potter's made absolutely no effort to stay true to the Auror uniform code. His uniform jacket is hung up with Draco's robes, but rather than the long-sleeved linen shirt they're allowed for summer weather, he's wearing a crisp cotton thing with short sleeves, though they barely count with the way they bulge and strain against Potter's biceps and shoulders. It's more like strips of fabric binding Potter's upper arms rather than clothing. Draco can see the seams straining, and though he tries to keep his focus on his cases, he keeps glancing over at Potter and his completely unprofessional attire.
The first thing Draco does is move Harry from the dungeons into one of the abandoned bedrooms. It's warmer than the wet stone and dirt floor had been, but they've removed anything and everything Harry might use for escape, so that's the only improvement. There's no bed, only a mattress on the floor, and other than a basin of water they take in and out every morning and a bucket in the corner, there's no real chance for Harry to get clean.
He hurries to the restroom, unaware that Harry doesn't sit, just stares after Draco and the flash of snakeskin and peonies along his lower back.
. It's bright like freshly fallen snow in sunlight, soft like the winter coat of his family's Clydesdales. The touch of Potter's lips on Draco's whips through him like a winter storm, so cold it burns.
Growling, Potter takes a step back. Draco wants to cough, wants to press at the delicate skin of his throat and check it for injury. Instead, he straightens his shoulders and smirks.
young, if you ask me, and killing him might have been the last truly decent thing I've done since leaving London, but I digress.
Harry wants to brush it away, so he casts the spell instead. The numbers float before them, and when the corner of Malfoy's mouth twitches into a tempting half-smile, Harry starts it running.
Christ, he's getting an erection in the middle of a French restaurant while not seated behind the safety of a table. He curses quietly, then curses again when he catches his suspect's wide-eyed gaze from across the room. The woman, probably counting on decorum to stop him from lunging across the dining room, takes out a handful of bills, tucks them under her plate, then grabs her purse before hurrying towards the door.
"I think you're on the right track. While I was waiting on the records, I Floo called the husband's office and was able to confirm his salary. It's a lot more than what we see deposited into the accounts he declared initially."
He gave me his books, and I spent hours pouring over the pages. Moneys in, moneys out. Inventory and orders, special requests from other vendors. Commerce, Potter, in all of its fine-boned detail. And do you know what I realized? I
"Stop!" The voice echoes against the brick walls, followed by pounding footsteps as Draco's pursuer sprints after him. "I said stop!"
"You did so well," he murmurs into Draco's ear, his hands around Draco's back to untie his wrists. When the knot gives way, Draco slumps further forward, and Harry's arms wrap around his chest, holding him close and steady. "You were so good for me."
straight, if you catch my meaning, but I tried to live a respectable life. It was hard finding work in Wizarding London, but Moribund was willing to hire me to keep his books. And do you know, I actually liked it? The man himself was a monster parading around in a person's skin. He liked his lovers young.
"About wanting Malfoy," Ron says before taking a bite. Mouth still full, he continues. "You do want to do something about it, yeah?"
"Tell me you want it," Potter says as he does it again. "Tell me how much you want my cock, Malfoy."
"Or dinner." Malfoy lets his eyes drift across Harry's body, his perusal slow and pointed. "I'm free on Saturday. You can pick me up from the Ministry Apparition point at 7. Dress nicely, no trainers or jeans. And," he adds as he finally drags his gaze back to Harry's, "if dinner goes well, you can get me coffee in the morning."
"Not like this," Harry said, the honesty catching him off-guard. He blamed it on the orgasm, stealing his ability to play coy. "Nothing like this."
The praise rings in Harry's ears, and he takes a step closer to the table, hoping it'll hide his body's response to Malfoy's words. It's wildly inappropriate to get an erection in the middle of a crowded lecture hall, but Harry doesn't seem to have any say in the matter.
Walking into the lecture hall reminds Harry of his early days with the Auror Corps. It's true that he hadn't worked that hard during their training courses, but the open secret was that Harry Potter could have done nothing and still ended up in the Corps. Everyone knew why he was there, and it wasn't his Potions skills.
Potter laughs self-consciously. "It's how I tell my secrets. No one knows what I'm saying — usually — and voicing them makes me feel… lighter."
He waits precisely two minutes before he starts undoing the fastenings on his robe. Not wanting to look too eager, he takes his time with it. It's a full five minutes before he shrugs off the robe. The rush of air against his overheated skin is pure bliss, and the slight breeze he feels when he walks the robe to the coat rack, hanging it neatly beside his greatcoat, is a delightful relief.
By the time Harry reaches the man's face, he already knows who it is. He remembers this body, remembers the shape and form of it, the weight of it against his back, against his face.
Looking up from his book, Goyle frowns at the gathered group of drunken eighth year boys. "I don't know what gave you the impression I was participating."
Sighing, Draco riffles through his out box, then holds out a stack of forms he'd finished the day before. "Here, if you insist."
And, for the first thirty minutes of his day, he thinks they must have fixed the climate control issue because his office is comfortable, no sign of the oppressive heat from the week before to be found. He's beaten Potter into the office this morning, a common occurrence as the man seems to be allergic to arriving anywhere on time, and Draco makes use of the peace and quiet to review a handful of cold cases he had pulled from storage the week before while trying to escape the heat. He's nearly chilly by the time that Potter arrives, so it's a bit of an annoyance that as soon as the man settles behind his desk, the temperature starts to rise.
