"Better, he seems to be getting stronger by the minute." Hermione smiled.
Harry was lost deep in thought when Ron snapped him out of it. "Harry I've been calling your name for the past 2 minutes mate" Ron said annoyed "Sorry I was just thinking about the.. classes I took this year."
"I've done nothing of the sort. I haven't laid a finger on him, well a harmful finger at least" Draco smirked and raised his eyebrow. "Why do you care Weaslette?" He stared down at her.
Harry stared down at it in awe, then looked back to Draco and kissed him again. "I'm the luckiest man alive" Harry said into Draco's shoulder. Draco sniffled and lifted Harry up. "No I am." He smiled.
"Harry I'm so glad you made it safely" Hermione said as she pulled away from the hug.
Harry turned around to face Draco. Harry ran his hand through Draco's hair. Draco traced Harry's jawline with his finger lightly. They both smiled at the same time. "I love you" Harry smiled and kissed Draco softly. Draco kissed back, his hand resting on Harry's cheek. "I love you too" Draco said against Harry's lips.
"O..ok..Well it's been well so far, I haven't done much but the house looks beautiful." Neville said, sounding very nervous and shaky. "My break has been uneventful, nothing much has happened..yet" Blaise smirked.
He finished and turned to Draco. "Amorentia" Snape said softly. "Of course" Draco rolled his eyes. "How long until it wears off?" Draco looked at Snape. "about 6 minutes, he will be tired afterwards, it seems Zabini did more than Amorentia, he also used some spells, Potters body is most likely exhausted" Snape put his wand away.
"What is it you needed?" Draco continued looking forwards and walking to the Great Hall. Luna looked up at him. "The wrackspurts are gone, I see none around you lately" She said smiling. "Wrackspurts?" Draco shook his head and laughed. "They make your brain fuzzy, they go away with positive thoughts, you used to have a swarm of them" She looked around the hall.
"Let's go eat ok?" Draco said softly and turned to face Harry. "No, you're not ok. Do you wanna talk about it?" Harry stopped him and placed his hand on Draco's bicep. Draco looked down at Harry's hand. "He outed me, he made my father hate me more, he ruined my life." Draco said softly staring down at Harry's hand.
"Oh potter" Snape whispered and got up. "What happened?" Snape looked up at Draco while he walked over to Harry. Harry looked up at Draco nodding, letting him know he could explain. "Harry's family, let's just say, aren't the nicest" Draco said staring at Snape who was staring at Harry. "Well we've got to talk to Dumbledore about this surely he could arrange somet-" Draco cut Snape off. "That's the problem" Draco said.
"For once I actually don't have an answer" Hermione said looking defeated. "I don't care about head boy or girl or whatever I'm just hungry" Ron said looking down at his stomach "When are you not hungry Ron?" Hermione looked over at him laughing. "Ha Ha very funny 'Mione" he said sarcastically.
Draco watched Harry come down the aisle, any sense of nervousness disappearing at the sight of Harry. Draco felt tears well in his eyes, he swiftly wiped them away. He did not want to be a mess in front of everyone.
Harry felt his cheeks heat up, he quickly tried to calm himself. "Very good, I'm glad to see you're getting along well" Dumbledore smiled.
Draco placed his lips on spots of Harry's neck, until he got a reaction out of Harry. Harry inhaled sharply and let out a moan when Draco's lips hit the sweet spot on Harry's neck.
"I will truly miss you two more than anything." Narcissa said as she helped load one of the last boxes into the back of the large and almost full moving truck. They had decided to use no magic to move, they wanted to do it normally. "We will miss you so much more Narcissa" Harry pulled her into a hug. She hugged back tightly. "Take care of him okay?" She said. "Of course I will" Harry smiled "Stay safe." She said and pulled away from the hug.
Embarrassed twice by the Golden Boy. What a feeling.
He pulled a book off of the shelf and opened it.
"Draco, honey let go." Narcissa said soothingly. "No, No! I cant lose him" Draco cried out and stared down at Harry, who was still bleeding. It had thankfully slowed a little from Snape intervening.
Draco had watched his dad beat his mother, he was put down for his whole life. Draco knew he wasn't worth anything, his father always made that apparent to him.
Harry's heart was in a puddle. Harry let out a deep breath and laid back down smiling. His shirt was unbuttoned still, but he didn't mind.
Flashes of different colored lights were flying around the room, the Christmas tree had been knocked down by this point.
"Okay, okay that's enough" Ron said pushing through all of them with Hermione. The family backed up and disbanded, going to different parts of the house.
"I could never love you" Harry said through laughter.
"What I have no idea what you two are talking about, Malfoy is disgusting" Harry said keeping his eyes on his food. "I think the Slytherin who can't keep his eyes off of you might have a slight idea, and may think just a little different of you" Ron said pointing at Draco with his fork. Harry turned around to look over at Slytherin table. Draco smirked and turned back to look at his food. Draco needed to have a serious conversation with Harry, but after what had just happened Harry's lips were all he could think about.
"Well...Potter as nice as this banter has been i should be going to my room" Draco shuddered at even having a slightly civil conversation with  Harry Potter "Yeah enjoy yourself Malfoy."
Draco pulled away and stared down at Harry, he ran his hand along Harry's cheek. "Thank you...but who are you?" Harry stared up at Draco. Draco's face fell, as did his heart and his hopes.
It was getting dark outside. Harry was going to go back to his real home. He needed to see Draco. He needed to feel Draco's warmth radiating off of him. He needed to feel the love pumping through his veins instead of the loneliness and despair.
Harry smiled and put his shoes back on. "Let's go eat i'm starved" Harry went into the bathroom to fix his hair. Draco put his shoes on, then followed Harry into the bathroom. "I really missed you." Draco stood next to Harry and leaned against the counter. "I missed you too" Harry turned to face Draco and wrapped his arms around Draco's neck. Harry twirled a piece of Draco's hair. "Did you get hotter? It looks like you did" Harry inspected Draco's face.
Draco awoke to the sounds of someone thrashing and..whimpering? He looked over at the clock, it read 2:02 am. He became aware of his new surroundings. It was going to be tough having to get used to waking up without a bunch of people around him. He truly hated being alone. Draco registered the sounds in his brain once more to make sure he hadn't imagined them. He heard them once more, Draco grabbed his wand in case it was any type of danger. He slowly left his room and followed the sounds. They were coming from Harry's bedroom.
"You open yours first." Harry nudged Draco and smiled. Narcissa was watching intently, she knew what both of them had gotten each other. "Fine fine" Draco unwrapped his cute little box. It revealed a black box.
"I feel awful about what I did Harry" Draco sighed. "I should've told you, not run away from it like I run from everything else" He looked down at his hands. "I was scared, okay I was so scared that he would do something to you. I could never live with that, that constant pain of knowing I could've helped" Draco felt tears well up in his eyes. Yet this time he didn't blink them back, he let them fall. Draco let his tears fall.
"I'm going to get right to the point. Why did you out me?"
Dear You,
Harry had eaten most of his dinner, which was a good new thing he had began doing. Draco was proud of how far Harry had come.
Harry wiped his eyes and took deep breaths.  He closed his eyes softly and sunk down to the floor. Harry had no energy to move. Harry hoped living with Draco would've made Draco a little nicer. He thought maybe they would come to an agreement that the feud was silly. Sadly they didn't. He was still some prat. A prat Harry had wanted since 3rd year. In a friend way though, because Harry was straight. Or so he tried to convince himself.
"Oh the surprise!" Narcissa remembered and Draco got up walking back over to them. "Okay what is it mum?" Draco looked at her. She just began to walk upstairs, Draco and Harry exchanged confused look but followed. Once they reached the top of the stairs there was a tiny hallway and a door.
Draco nodded. "I know" He smiled. "So you're not going to tell me how all this happened?" Snape looked at Draco smiling. When no one else was around Snape was actually a very sweet person. "You really want to know Sevy?" Draco smirked. "Never-mind pervert" Snape chuckled.
"Wow that was insane" Harry said after making sure Blaise was really gone. "I know right. I was not expecting that" Draco crawled back into bed, snuggling up next to Harry.
"Fine." Draco walked up to the front of the hall to Snape. "I have reason to believe Blaise poisoned Harry." Draco looked up at Snape. "What? Why's that?" Snape said is his normal monotone. "All of a sudden Harry is...like in love with Zabini..see for yourself" Draco said gesturing towards Slytherin table.
"Draco some of your friends have arrived!" They heard Narcissa yell from the bottom of the staircase. They both groaned with annoyance.
Harry was questioning what was happening?
"The study has two desks so both of you can work at the same time if needed" Dumbledore smiled satisfied with himself. "Sir you forgot to mention anything about that door" Harry pointed to a door, making sure his sleeve didn't lift past his wrist, in between his and Draco's room. "Oh yes my apologies, this door leads to the bathroom" Dumbledore smiled to himself.
Hermione wearing a light blue dress with lace on the top half of it, a shawl draped around her shoulders. Her hair in an up-do with tendrils of her hair falling down into her eyes. "Hermione you look gorgeous" Harry said and walked over to her, hugging her.
Harry awoke at around ten, he had been jittery all night. Excitement pumping through his veins. Harry was genuinely excited about Christmas this year. Amazing family, gifts, Draco. Everything was perfect, absolutely perfect.
"Enough of the sappy shit let's get this over with" Barty started throwing spells at the two of them. Draco made sure to keep Harry behind him, since Harry was the big prize.
Once dinner was finished they all helped clean, still talking and laughing. "Loves I think it's time I retire to my room." Bellatrix said and smiled before hugging all of them. Wishing them a good night.
"Those would be nightmares" Harry smiled a fake smile. Before Draco could push on with questions about his actual nightmare Harry continued talking "But enough about that what time is it?" Harry asked looking at the clock squinting his eyes trying to read it. "It's half past 11" Draco said smiling to himself about how cute it was when Harry was trying to read the clock. Draco kept mentally kicking himself, he needed to stop.
"Draco" Harry said softly. Draco's heart fell to his stomach. He felt butterflies swarm inside of him. Honestly he almost fell off of his broom. "Yes?" Draco said just as softly. "I wouldn't have it any other way" Harry smiled. Draco was mesmerized by Harry. He was mesmerized by his every move, every word, every breath.
Always told 'don't let anyone see any weakness' 'always cover up your sadness or fear'. Harry tore his eyes away from Draco's concerned gaze and ran to his room. He shut the door behind him and felt tears streaming down his face. Harry quickly wiped them and got dressed. He was embarrassed. Someone had seen him how he truly was. Even worse it was Malfoy who would probably tell the whole school and make fun of him.
"Isn't Christmas just absolutely wonderful?" Narcissa said cheerily. "Yes, yes it is. Maybe tomorrow we could go to the city." Draco said with a smile on his face. Harry cuddled into Draco's side, Draco wrapped his arm around him. Draco caressed Harry's side with his hand. Harry smiled and kissed Draco's cheek.
Draco smiled as well and held Harry's hand under the table. They wanted to tell people, just not yet. Not while Harry wasn't perfectly healthy. "Oh Neville!" Harry turned and looked down the table gesturing to the other brown haired boy to come sit next to him. Neville pointed at himself and mouthed me? "Yes you're the only Neville I know" Harry smiled. Neville got up and moved down the table. "Are you seriously doing this?" Draco whispered in Harry's ear.
"Well then I will sort the gifts." Narcissa smiled and walked over to the tree. Harry looked out of the large window and saw snow covering the land as far as he could see. A warm sensation filled Harry. This dark manor seemed so light in this moment.
"Not really, unless I'm just a moron" Ron said shrugging.
Draco came back only a few minutes later with Snape. "Harry glad to see you safe" Snape smiled. "Me too sir" Harry said. "No more sir, call me Sev." Snape said back. Harry nodded.
They arrived a little ways from Malfoy Manor so they weren't seen. Dumbledore was already there. They got off of their brooms and stood there waiting for instruction. "Draco" Dumbledore said.
"What happened to waiting until the perfect moment love?" Draco said smiling and turned his attention to Neville. "I won't tell, nothing to worry about." Neville reassured Draco. Draco nodded and smiled. "So you're going to get with Blaise?" Draco smirked, trying to get a rise out of Neville.
The door opened.
"Ok Barty today's the big day!" Bellatrix smiled. Barty smiled as well. "Can we do it now?" Barty asked with excitement. And a sense of impatience. "No their friends are on their way right now. We must wait until they leave. We can do it then" Bellatrix began changing into some more appropriate clothes for the day.
"I'm barely keeping myself composed" Ron chuckled. "Now let's get that hair done" Hermione smiled and lead Harry to the chair at the vanity. She got to work.
"We will, you can come visit anytime you want. We even picked out a room just for you" Draco hopped down from where he was inside the truck. He was making sure everything was in place and not going to break. The sleeves to his sweater were rolled up and he had a hint of sweat glistening on his forehead.
Harry smiled and nodded. "By the way I should probably tell you something." Draco looked down at Harry and moved a piece of hair off of his forehead revealing Harry's unique scar. "Alright what?"
Draco walked next to him and lead him through the halls. They arrived in the astronomy tower. "Ok so tell me what's this about?" Harry looked at him. Draco smiled and looked out at the dimly lit night sky. "I love it here" Draco ran his finger along the railing. "And why's that?" Harry came up next to him.
Harry rolled on top of Draco and kissed his chin. "Wake up darling" Harry cooed. Draco grumbled and turned over with Harry, pulling him back into his arms. Harry smiled and pecked the tip of Draco's nose. "It's Christmas darling" Harry said softly as he caressed Draco's cheek.
Harry had the blade because he was gay. Draco confirmed his suspicions. It was only a matter of time before his family found out. He would have to go back there for Christmas. They would hate him even more. They would wish he was dead just as much as he did. He just wished it would stop, the need to do those things to himself.
Harry felt a knot forming in his stomach as got closer to climax. Draco could tell because Harry's mouth was open but no sound was coming out. "Go ahead darling" Draco whispered into Harry's ear.
"I usually tend to grab whoever the unlucky person is waking me from my terrors"
"How do you two plan on getting out of here?" Draco asked. "Harry showed us a few ways." Hermione smirked. They walked through hidden passageways and found themselves right in Hogsmeade. "See didn't take that long"Ron said.
"I must be heading home" Neville said getting up and wiping his mouth. "Thank you two for the lovely meal and great time. I'll definitely be back for Christmas." Neville smiled. "I'll walk you out" Blaise said getting up and waving goodbye to the others in the room. "Need to give Neville a little goodnight kiss?" Hermione teased.
Harry never broke eye contact with Draco, not once. Draco watched him whilst biting down on his lower lip the whole time. Harry finished un buttoning and stared at Draco's top less body. Exposed. Completely exposed. Harry smirked and laid his hands down on Draco's faint abs. Draco watched Harry's every move. Harry began sucking on Draco's collarbone, slowly and seductively.
"It's breathtaking." Harry said as he ran his fingers along the pretty flowers. Harry walked on the small bridge, going across the stream. "This is so peaceful" Harry took a seat right in the middle of the bridge. Draco walked up and sat next to him. He took Harry's hand in his own, rubbing it softly. "It's where I used to go when my parents would argue." Draco looked up at the birds passing by.
Draco removed Harry's pants completely. Harry was already hard and whining for just a tiny touch. Draco smirked down at Harry before licking his lips. "Needy are we?" Draco ran his finger down Harry's jawline.
Harry thought considering all the green it was most likely a posh and rude Slytherin. "Watch where you're going Potter." A velvety rude, yet familiar voice spilled into his ears. The person, who Harry had now identified to be a boy because of their voice was looking down at Harry where he was grabbing around for his glasses. "Aren't those glasses supposed to help you see better?" the boy chuckled and his friends laughed.
"Wait wait how could you even begin to think that they may like each other?" Ron played with the corner of his robe. "Well for starters they slept in the same bed and didn't kill each other, and Draco helped Harry's night terror without any complaints." Hermione said putting the book back. "We have got to talk to Harry about this now I need to know." Hermione said walking swiftly out of the library.
"And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind" Draco said to himself and smiled more. It was half of a quote from the book they were reading. Draco grabbed a piece of parchment and wrote down the other half to slip to Harry once he returned.
Draco finished brushing his teeth and answered. "Eh sure" He took it from Harry's hands and opened it. Harry waited patiently. "Nosy much?" Draco looked down at him smiling. "Always" Harry waited. Draco opened it up and read through it.
Draco cleared his throat and looked down the aisle. Harry began to walk, once he saw Draco any jitters he had disappeared. All Harry could think about was how elated he was to marry the love of his life.
There was a pause for applause. Harry couldn't even begin to care about the applause he just needed to know who the other boy was. Hopefully not some insufferable git. With his luck it most likely would indeed be some insufferable git. Probably some Slytherin who loves to wreak havoc and bully people. Harry prayed it wouldn't be a Slytherin. Anything but Slytherin.
"Is it because of him? Listen baby I miss you, I'm sorry for what I did" Blaise said looking at Harry. Draco took in a deep breath trying to keep his cool. "Go away Zabini" Draco said picking up his pace, taking Harry along with him. "This isn't the last you'll see of me Draco" Harry heard Blaise chuckle.
Draco softly sucked on Harry's bottom lip. Draco did every little thing he could to make Harry shiver, or moan. Harry' right hand was back up in Draco's hair tugging at it softly. Draco's hands were everywhere they could be. Draco wanted to get to know each and every curve of Harry's body. Draco continued to kiss Harry, using his tongue to fight with Harry's.
His eyebrows furrowed. Why the hell had Harry slept on the floor? Draco's eyes looked around the bathroom and saw a rag on the counter. He slowly picked it up and saw..blood. Draco's heart dropped. He hoped the blood wasn't from what his mind instantly went to. Draco let out a quiet breath. He was deciding whether or not he should wake Harry or leave him there.
"And I have plans with Blaise, Neville, and Pansy" Draco smiled and propped his head up on his hand, watching Harry get dressed. "I can't wait to see your outfit love" Draco smirked and watched Harry put his shoes on. "I can't wait to see yours" Harry walked over to the bed and placed a soft kiss on Draco's lips.
Draco had awoken only 30 minutes later. It was 12:49. He heard a slight quiet bang. Draco got up and opened his bedroom door slowly. Harry's door was wide open. Draco's eyes widened, he thought Harry left. Draco walked over to Harry's room. He found the bed made and everything untouched except for Harry's wardrobe. It was wide open but all of his clothes were still there. He completely missed the blade on the floor.
"Ron don't go all sappy on me...but I must  admit I'm going to miss being your roommate as well" Harry smiled and adjusted his glasses. Ron and Hermione both looked a bit sad which was understandable. They were upset because they knew that they couldn't be with Harry as much, but they were also so extremely happy for him. "The feast is starting in approximately 7 minutes we should start making our way to the Great Hall" Hermione said getting up and fixing her robes. "Finally I'm starved" Ron said walking ahead of Hermione and Harry.
Draco tilted Harry's head up to look at him. Harry met his eyes. Draco removed Harry's glasses and placed them on the bedside table. Harry smiled. Draco looked back down to Harry. Draco slowly placed a kiss on the corner of Harry's mouth. Harry smiled and placed a kiss on Draco's lips. Draco returned the favor. Slow and steady. Softly.
"Did you leave this here?" Draco said coming into the bathroom holding an envelope. "Not mine" Harry said and gargled some water. Draco shrugged and set it down, he began to brush his teeth as well. "You gonna open it?"
"you like that?" Draco mumbled into Harry's ear. Harry moaned in response. Draco began pumping faster, then just stopped all together. Harry whined and thrusted his hips, wanting more. "sh sh be patient" Draco grabbed the bottle he had carelessly tossed on the bed.
"Draco...hey" The person Harry couldn't necessarily identify said. "What do you want Zabini?" Draco said angrily. Blaise Zabini, Draco's ex boyfriend. "Jeez calm down, do you think we could talk sometime before lunch Draco?" Blaise looked at Draco.
"We have the house elves preparing a meal. So how about we just relax while we wait?" Draco said sitting down in one of the armchairs. Harry sat down on Draco's lap. Hermione and Ron sat down on another armchair together.
We would love to have you for dinner tomorrow at Malfoy Manor.  Arrive at whatever time you please as long as it is before 5:30. I assume you will be able to make it considering you told me you would be able to yesterday. Please wear something formal, dresses and suits.
Draco had tears streaming down his face once more. He could barely move, he was stuck. Harry didn't deserve what happened to him. Harry deserved the world. Draco tried to give it to him but failed.
"Yeah that would work" Harry said and finished up his food. Neville nodded and continued eating. "Yes of course that would be delightful" Blaise said smoothly. Ron, Hermione, Harry, and Draco had indulged in their own conversation. Blaise looked at Neville, genuinely looked at him. Neville took a moment, a moment of hesitation but then finally looked at Blaise.
When their friends found out of the engagement they were beyond happy. When Narcissa found out she broke down into tears. She kept saying how much she loved them and how proud she was of them. She bought both of their tuxedos. She also paid for the cake. She also paid for the decor.
"No one loves you Harry?!" Draco stared at him "No!" Harry exclaimed. "Give me one damn example of someone who loves me!" Harry said sadly.
"Oh..it's very nice...last name." Neville said smoothing his pants. "So does the bottom part of your last name acquire to your preferences as well?" Blaise decided to be bold, to jump at the opportunity. Draco choked on his food now, everyone was barely expecting that. Neville was basically dying.
Narcissa was in the front row bawling her eyes out along with Hermione, Pansy, Molly, and Draco was pretty sure he even saw Ron shed a tear or two.
"So, Draco how did you know Harry was having a night terror?" Hermione said looking over at him. "Well I guess I just woke up and heard someone...crying. I immediately got up to go see where it was coming from" Draco said shrugging.
Everything was so peaceful and gorgeous. It all felt so nice. It all felt so freeing. It all felt so perfect. Too perfect.
When they finally pulled away, they lingered for a second. Then turned to look at the shocked faces staring back at them. Neville's cheeks went red once more, he looked down and twiddled his thumbs. Blaise cleared his throat. "Well that was long awaited" Blaise chuckled and wiped his mouth.
"Deal" Draco held out his hand. Honestly that part was no bother, Draco felt no yearn for anyone else. "Deal" Harry put his hand in Draco's and shook on it. "And no feelings"  Draco smirked and pulled his hand away. Harry nodded, that rule didn't need to be said it was implied. "Well then Malfoy, I'll be off to bed now" Harry said getting up. Draco licked his bottom lip.
Draco took Harry's hand and sighed. Draco sat there and thought. Harry must've been so scared in the bathroom and felt so alone. It made Draco cringe that he wasn't there for Harry when he needed him most.
"Darling you seem nervous" Harry squeezes Draco's hand. Draco chuckled and looked down at Harry. "I'm not nervous love" He said as they continued walking.
His two best friends came in the room with two steaming hot plates of food. They smiled "Harry!" They walked over to him and sat the food down. "You did this?" Harry looked at Draco smiling softly. Draco mouthed "of course" Draco smiled. Harry's smile brightened.
"Congratulations mate!" Ron embraced Harry and patted his back. Harry chuckled and smiled, hugging Ron back. "I'm so excited!" Hermione then hugged him.
Harry wanted Draco more than Draco could ever even fathom. Draco's right hand was still rested upon the back of Harry's neck. Harry's breath was shaky and uneven. Draco could tell Harry wanted this just as much as he did. Harry let his eyes fall down to Draco's lips. Draco's perfect lips. Draco let his tongue flick over his bottom lip slowly. Harry melted at the sight of it. Draco wrapped his arm around Harry tighter, but not too tight because he had felt how frail Harry was.
"I don't feel anything" Harry said looking at Draco. "There's no way, I've never made a bad potion in my life" Draco said flipping through his book to the amorentia page. He read through the ingredients thoroughly. "I did everything right..." Draco continued to read, confused why it didn't work.
"Well then I will sort the gifts." Narcissa smiled and walked over to the tree. Harry looked out of the large window and saw snow covering the land as far as he could see. A warm sensation filled Harry. This dark manor seemed so light in this moment.
"Tell me I would just love to know how you got all of those ugly bruises" Draco said smirking  Harry felt tears threaten to sting his eyes. He knew they were ugly, he knew he was ugly. Harry scowled really not in the mood to be picked on. Draco looked dumbfounded for a second and just kinda stared at Harry. "So carry on" Draco said
Little did Harry know Draco had been awake for half an hour before that and had just fallen back asleep. He was just watching Harry sleep. Watching his eyes flutter every now and then, watching his chest fall up and down as he breathed. Studying Harry's face so intently as if he was going to be quizzed on it later. He had watched Harry's chest rise and fall with every breath he took, he needed to make sure Harry was breathing.
They put their robes on and lounged around the Gryffindor common room until it was time for the feast. "I'm gonna miss having you as a roommate Harry" Ron said looking up at the ceiling.
"Wait..." Ron's face dropped. "You don't think Harry and Malfoy like are gonna do anything about it?" Hermione started reading. "Yes I do..eventually" Ron sat across from her.
"Love can you please wake James, we must be at your mum's house in 30 minutes." Harry said as he frantically fixed his tie, he was honestly just fumbling with it at this point. Draco chuckled. "Here darling" He fixed Harry's tie for him and patted his chest softly. "Gorgeous, yes I will wake him" Draco kissed Harry's forehead then walked down the hall to their son's room.
"Yes I do, now get to making it" Harry smiled and nudged Draco. Draco got to work. Harry watched his hands, he watched them stir the cauldron, grab ingredients, and do whatever they needed to. Harry tapped his fingers, getting bored. "Are you almost done?" Harry asked him.
The house elf brought them breakfast. "Thank you." Harry smiled down at the house elf and sat back down. "This looks delicious" Harry smiled like the sun. Draco couldn't help but smile as well. He just dazed off, staring at Harry, admiring him. "Earth to Malfoy, your food will get cold" Harry waved his hand in front of Draco's face.
Snape smiled as well admiring the way Draco was so openly speaking with him. "I will leave you here to go look in his bedroom, I will see you on Monday" Snape got up and glided towards the doorway. He dramatically swooshed his robes and left. Draco chuckled. "drama queen" He rolled his eyes and walked into Harry's bedroom.
Draco was on his way back to his room when he heard Harry. "Malfoy" Harry said. Draco was confused but turned back around and walked back into his room. "Yes Potter?" Draco said standing at his doorway. "I didn't like..grab you or anything right?" Harry said biting his lip nervously. The sight of Harry biting his lip made Draco absolutely lose it. "No potter you didn't grab me why would you even think that?" Draco said staring at him, lying once again.
Draco was watching Harry so intently, so intrigued at how this shy boy could be so daring. Draco bit his lip, slowly feeling himself harden. Harry was looking up at him innocently yet mischievously. Draco felt slightly bad, or guilty. He felt as if he had forced Harry to do this, even though he hadn't. "Harry..." Draco managed a whisper. "You don't have to..you know" Draco mumbled. "I know I don't, i want to." Harry smirked.
They truly made a perfect pair.
Harry felt a smile tugging at the corner of his lips. "Really?" Harry looked at Snape and Narcissa. "It would be an absolute honor to have you at the manor this Christmas." She smiled and reached out to place a hand on his shoulder.
"Okay go put it on then" Ron smiled and shooed Harry into the bathroom. "Okay mate" Harry smiled and walked over to the bathroom. He unzipped the bag his tuxedo was in. Harry saw it and was in awe once again. The tux he had picked out was truly beautiful.
Everyone hugged and chatted for a bit. "Okay gift exchange. Me and 'Mione have got to be on our way soon. Mum's expecting us home soon." Ron said and pulled the gifts out of Hermione's bag. Neville and Blaise were cuddled up together next to the fireplace.
Draco took a deep breath. "Thank you" Draco began walking past him. Once he was beyond Lucius he stopped and turned around. "Stupefy" Draco yelled and pointed his wand at his father's back. Lucius swiftly stepped aside.
"Hermione, babe, you're stressing over nothing calm down it'll all be ok" Ron said and rubbed her shoulder blade. "Yes it'll be fine, but may I suggest we do the tuxedo first" Harry chimed in. "Yes, yes good idea." Hermione smiled and got the tuxedo off of the door.
Harry couldn't wait to see Draco's reaction and Draco's tuxedo. Harry put it on, loving the way it had been tailored to fit him like a glove.
Hermione glanced at Harry as if she didn't believe him, but she let it slide. "So Harry I'm pretty sure you've already been notified about head boy yeah?" Hermione asked with a smile.
Harry gulped. "Get away from me Zabini." Harry shakily grabbed for his wand, but dropped it. "So the hard way then" Blaise shrugged and pulled out his wand. Harry's eyes were filling with tears. "Please don-" Harry was cut off by Blaise. "Stupefy!" Blaise pointed his wand at Harry. Harry froze and fell against the sink. Unable to speak, his vision went blurry. The last thing he saw was Blaise popping open the vial and walking towards him.
They arrived at the Great Hall. "Would you like to come sit with us?" Harry looked up at Draco. "Really?" Draco smiled down at him. Draco had already caught a glance at his table and Blaise was sitting at it. He didn't want to be anywhere near Blaise or else he might hex him.
He tip toed back into Draco's room and left the note on the pillow beside him. Harry took a moment to look down at Draco and admire the way the moonlight peaking out from the side of the curtain hit Draco's porcelain skin. Harry smiled and swiftly left. He walked out of their dorm putting the cloak on and crept around the hallways.
Hermione giggled and hugged back. Draco was next to hug her. "You do look absolutely stunning" Draco smiled.
He was met by Harry who was almost done brushing his. "Oh sorry am I in your way?" Harry looked up and spit out his toothpaste. Draco smirked, looked like another liquid he wanted in Harry's mouth. "No no we can share" Draco picked up his tooth brush and brushed his teeth.
"Of what?" Draco didn't let go of him. "I don't want to start...to start doing it again. I don't want them to hurt me again" Harry pressed his head a little harder into Draco's chest because of the headache that was brewing in his head. Draco kissed his forehead. "You're strong Harry I know it. Whenever you want to start again just think of all that you have. Friends, your owl, Snape, and me." Draco smiled. "We're all here for you" He said softly.
He took in a deep breath of cool soothing air and rolled up his sleeve. Harry saw the newest one sitting on his wrist so daintily. It hurt his soul, it hurt Harry's soul to know he was weak. No matter how hard Harry had hoped it would've stopped by now it didn't. It hadn't stopped and he didn't know when it would. Once Draco came into his life for real, Harry hoped he could help stop it. Draco did help stop it for a while there, but Harry let his mind become consumed again.
The rest of the gifts really weren't mentioning, just funny little things. Gifts lining up with inside jokes between Harry and Hermione and Ron. They had gotten the others small cute things. Everyone had finally finished opening their gifts and saying their thank you's.
"Avada Kedavra" Draco pointed his wand at his father. A green light shone from the end. His father, died. Died when the light made contact with him. Draco felt internally satisfied. That man had taken so much from Draco, his mum, and now Harry. Draco couldn't be happier that he was the one who got to end his father's malicious, sad, and lonely life. McGonagall, Madeye, and Lupin had already left on their brooms. Snape had taken Dumbledore along with him into the fire. Draco, Narcissa, Hermione, and Ron were the only ones left at the manor.
"Give the boy back now. You can't take on all four of us Lucius" Lupin said. "Yes I can. If any of you try to harm me. Harry will die." Lucius chuckled and ran his finger along a small table that sat in a corner of the large room.
"Avada Keda-" Bellatrix began speaking and pointing her wand at Draco who was attempting to protect Harry. "No!" Harry yelled and jumped in front of Draco.
Harry got to Ron's house and saw the whole Weasley family waiting for him. Once they saw him, they all ran up to hug and congratulate him. "Harry, congratulations!" Molly said and pinched Harry's cheeks. The rest of the Weasley's congratulated him.
Draco awoke bright and early the next morning to Harry staring at him. Draco chuckled. "creeper" He rubbed his eyes. Harry smiled. "I told Dumbledore no classes for us today" Harry grabbed his glasses and put them on. "Why?" Draco looked at him hoping it didn't mean what he thought it did. "I told him, well
"You'll be fine I promise" Harry smiled. Draco chuckled. "Let's go to breakfast yeah?" Harry nodded.
Harry just sat back and watched, curious to see how it may play out.
"It seems like a beautiful escape" Harry sat back against the metal railing. "It was." Draco let out a breath of relief and satisfaction. Draco got up. "Where are you going?" Harry looked at him and began rubbing his arms. It was cold, but not too cold.
Harry put his clothes on, put his pants on one leg at a time. Harry counted how long it took for him to get dressed, as he did everyday. The little things kept his mind occupied. He tied his shoes and looked around for his glasses. Just as he started to search for them he heard a knock on his door.
"Alright" Harry said softly and snuggled into his covers. He curled into a ball and pulled the covers around him. "Alright" Draco smiled and left the room closing the door softly. He let out a breath and walked out of their dorm.
Draco rolled his eyes, that was no way to live his life. Anticipating something bad happening.
Narcissa smiled at the two boys. "Do you two like your gifts?" She asked. "Yes, these are truly amazing. I'm so grateful" Harry said to her, nearly in tears. He had never had this kind of experience. Everyone was happy and getting along. There was no yelling or stress. Harry felt safe. He felt as if this whole home was untouchable.
"Catch me if you can" Harry smirked and blasted off into the sky. Draco shook his head laughing and followed Harry. Draco let the wind ruffle his hair and pink his cheeks and nose. Harry was a little ahead of him, he beat Draco to the top.
The next week was a breeze, something new everyday. Harry and Draco would end all of the days the same, cuddled up in each other's arms. The days would be spent shopping, laughing, and loving.
"That little prat" Draco whispered under his breath. "So we walk and talk about some things, she says she has a bet with a girl I know about...well about me and you" Harry chuckled and slid back under the blankets. Draco shook his head chuckling.
"Love there's letters!" Harry said excitedly, three letters. Meaning all three people had responded already. "Really from who?" Draco sat up on his elbows and rubbed his eyes. Draco was overly tired, he truly did not want to be awake. "The people you sent them too dummy" Harry rolled his eyes and grabbed the letters from his nightstand. He got comfortable back in bed and handed two of them to Draco. Draco began opening one of them while Harry did the same.
It took Draco a moment to wrap his arms around Harry. He held Harry, he bent down so Harry wouldn't have to get on his tippy toes and be uncomfortable. Draco held him tightly, he could feel Harry shaking, he was scared.
Dinner had finally been served. They were all sitting at the table. Draco and Harry at the head, Hermione and Ron on the right of them. Blaise and Neville next to each other on the left of them.
"Your mother would've been so disappointed if she found out she gave birth to a little gay boy." She cleared her throat and looked at Harry. Harry's throat burned he was about to cry. "If we continue receiving these disgusting letters I will take you out of that school for freaks. " She made eye contact with him. Cold bitter eye contact. "Y- yes ma'am" Harry looked down and bit the inside of his cheek. He was so angry. He was so angry he had to be here.
When he opened his eyes  he was standing in the middle of his common room on the white carpet in front of the soft red couch. He took in the familiar setting and managed a smile. The fireplace, the faint tan color that was spread on all the stone walls of the room.
The two of them stared at the shirtless boys laying in bed together. Her eyes fell to the floor where Harry's shirt was laying. Draco's mum couldn't help hit think they interrupted something, something gross. "Are we interrupting?" Narcissa said trying to keep her composure. "No mum you're not." Draco smiled convincingly.
Draco leaned back down connecting his lips with the skin on Harry's collarbone. "Let's make some new bruises, ones with better memories eh?" Draco smirked. Harry just smiled, he loved everything about this moment. Draco made him feel good about who he was.
Someone took a seat next to him. He looked over. Blaise Zabini. Harry tensed up and kept his eyes forwards. Flitwick started talking about the charms they would be learning.
Once.
He helped him get dressed. The boy fussed just a tiny bit, he still wanted to be asleep. Everything was fun until Draco tried to put the jacket on. "No!" James scream giggled and ran out of his room, he ran down the hall into Harry and Draco's room. "Daddy Help!" He ran behind Harry's leg. Harry chuckled and looked back at him. "What are you hiding from sweetheart?" He said.
Once he had calmed down they all took off. Soaring through the sky, passing so many different settings. A forest, a lake, a booming city, cabins, neighborhoods. Draco could barely focus. It was difficult staying steady on his broom. He didn't want to face his father. He didn't want to know what his father had done to Harry.
Draco felt anger bubbling inside of him.
"It started small, my aunt would make me clean, or cook. Which sounds completely normal right? Well the way she punished me if I did it wrong was most definitely not normal. I would be thrown into the cellar, the dark cellar. As a young lad, a dark cellar is most definitely not a preferred place to be, she would lock me down there for hours, days. No food" Harry twiddled his thumbs.
"I love you, I love you, I love you" Harry kissed Draco now. Draco smiled. "Plane tickets to Paris." Harry said to Draco. "It's your dream. I want to be the one to fulfill it. Harry it'll be gorgeous" Draco smiled and held Harry tightly.
Harry stood just staring at an empty corner of his room for a second. Draco was genuinely one the most beautiful people he had ever laid his eyes on. His slender structure, his rosy cheeks, his storm clouds for eyes, and his silky platinum blonde hair. But Harry was straight, he tried convincing himself that millions of times. Harry just never wanted to admit that he may not be. If he said it aloud it would become true.
The fights began to collide, Harry, Draco, and Narcissa against the other two. "Stupefy!" Narcissa yelled pointing her wand at Barty, for some reason he didn't deflect it, or even try to. It hit him and he fell unconscious.
Draco couldn't feel much else than worry in that moment.
"I'm surprised he'd able to control himself around you" Pansy said shaking her head. "Im flattered?" Harry said chuckling. "Not like that prat, no offense you're not my cup of tea. Draco on the other hand, let's just say he wouldn't mind taking a sip" She laughed quietly.
Snape and Lupin were now throwing spells at Lucius who was deflecting all of them. Hermione, Ron, McGonagall, and Madeye came inside and were now attempting to help. There were flashes of different colored lights being thrown around the room. Dumbledore was still out cold.
"We have classes tomorrow, I'm going to retire to bed." Harry said yawning. "Alright, sleep well don't wake me from my beauty sleep." Draco smiled smugly. Harry looked hesitant as if he had more to say. Harry bit on the inside of his cheek, he found himself doing that often.
"You bloke, let go of him now" Draco said angrily. "Why would I? He loves me" Blaise said and Harry swooned. Draco's heart hurt seeing Harry so infatuated with another. "Let him go now." Draco stared him dead in the eye.
"Fight!" Bellatrix said and smirked. She began targeting Narcissa, spells flying left and right. Narcissa deflecting them all and throwing them right back. "My own Sister!" Narcissa yelled at her. "Oh whatever!" Bellatrix rolled her eyes out and stuck her tongue out at her. The spells kept flying through the air.
Draco and Harry waisted the night away talking about wedding plans. Talking about their manor on the countryside. Talking about their forever.
Draco and Harry burst out laughing. "Did she just give us permission to come here?" Draco said through his laughter. Harry smiled and calmed down. "I think she did" Draco wiped his eyes which were teary from the laughter.  Draco smiled. "I know it's your thinking spot, but would you mind if I came and used your thinking spot when I get...well you know" Harry asked softly.
Draco had somehow managed to have Harry's pants un-buttoned and the belt was off. "I need you to touch me" Harry whispered into Draco's ear. Draco grabbed Harry's waist and flipped them again.
"The boy threatened Harry, something about the easy way or the hard way. Harry was sad, crying, he grabbed for his wand but to no avail." Myrtle spun around, barely able to keep still. "What happened next Myrtle?" Draco watched her.
Harry mumbled the password and walked in. Draco walked in behind him. "Now care to tell me?" Draco crossed his arms and looked at Harry who was toeing his shoes off.
Draco checked the time, Blaise, Neville, and Pansy should be arriving in about an hour. He decided to take a hot shower to relax his muscles. Draco was nervous for the wedding, he wanted nothing but perfectness. He wanted nothing bad to happen, after all they'd been through he wanted everything to be perfect for Harry.
"You can relax potter." A low voice said from above him. "You're rather tense, calm down" Harry could basically hear Draco's smirk. "S-sorry" Harry constantly found himself getting tongue tied around Draco. "Now go back to sleep we don't have classes today remember?" Draco said in more of a whisper now. "Oh yeah..I forgot" Harry said softly and started to take his arms away from Draco's waist, now aware of how awkward it must've been for Draco.
"Thank you." Draco said softly and wrapped an arm around Harry's waist. Harry smiled up at him and placed his hands on Draco's chest. "You're welcome" Harry smiled. Draco placed a soft kiss on his lips. Harry kissed back and let himself melt into Draco's arms. "Now let's go I'm hungry" Draco said softly and let go of Harry. "What is up with our exes approaching us today?" Harry smiled. Draco shrugged and walked out of the bathroom.
"Nope no way" Harry stuck his nose up in the air. He looked prissy and stuck up. "It's almost the same color as the green in your eyes" Draco said softly looking at the masterpiece of a boy who sat in front of him. Harry's cheeks heated up and his face fell into a big cheesy smile. Draco stared at him and cocked his head. "You look sick are you alright?" Draco chuckled.
It was finally time.
Harry just stared down at the words written on the parchment. Draco was just going to back down, not even try and find a way around it. Harry realized he clearly wasn't as important to Draco as he thought he was. Draco's wretched father was probably going to have Harry killed anyway. Harry figured it'd be better if he was just gone. His family wouldn't have to put up with him, all the pain from his uncle, would just disappear.
"What did I say about lying" Draco smirked and let his gaze fall upon Harry who looked nervous and fidgety. His fingers were once again under Harry's chin. Harry finally met Draco's eyes. "Look me in the eyes and tell me you're not lying." Draco said lowly.  Harry was at a loss for words. Harry loved the way Draco handled him.
Once Dumbledore was out of the dorm completely, Harry collapsed against Draco. Draco held him tightly. Harry started to tear up. "I can't go I can't face them I don't want to" Harry rambled into Draco's chest. Draco rubbed Harry's back soothingly. "Sh sh sh it's ok" Draco said softly. Harry was very worked up it became hard for him to catch his breath. "Hey take a deep breath it's ok" Draco looked down at him slightly pulling away.
"Oh Harry" Draco whispered, he moved over to Harry and wrapped his arms around him. Draco rubbed Harry's arm softly. Harry let out a sigh. "Then it became a constant thing...he would do it just because..he does it just because. They would hit me, burn me. My cousin, Dudley, would always bring up how my parents d- died because of me" Harry sniffled and wiped his eyes.
Harry and Draco stood side by side facing the evil man who stood in front of them. "If anything happens look in the very back of my wardrobe ok?" Harry said, shaky voice and all. "Don't talk like that nothing will happen. I love you" Draco replied, tears running down his face. Tears of sadness and worry and fear.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Always with the dramatics Potter" Draco left the room, his heart hurt and confused. What did Draco say that triggered Harry to get angry. Harry seemed to be on short fuse anyways. Draco went to his bedroom and turned on his lamp. He sat there and thought about Harry and his father. It was around 4:02 A.M.
"I promise" Neville said solemnly and took a forkful of food into his mouth. "We've been well together ish for about three and a half months." Harry smiled, it felt nice to get that off of his chest. It felt nice to not hide Draco. "Oh talking about us are we?" Draco turned to
Harry cried and held onto Draco. "Harry, love, calm down it's ok" Draco said. Harry's cries gradually subdued. "Dray..I'm sorry" Harry mumbled. "No, don't apologize to me. Now what did they do to you?" Draco said shakily.
"I..Narcissa...this is...i love it" Harry smiled and hugged her, burying his face in her shoulder. She began to tear up and hugged him back tightly. Draco wrapped his arms around both of them. "This is the least I can do. You saved my son in so many ways. I could not be more thankful for that" She sniffled.
"I've always been afraid and weak. I always felt I wasn't enough. The only thing about me that I know is good, is the way I can make you feel" Draco looked back up at Harry. Harry's eyes were watery as well. Harry took Draco's hand into his own and held it. "You're more than enough, you're loved, you're needed" Harry said softly. Draco now had streams of tears running down his face.
"We're working with amorentia in potions tomorrow. Snape really wanted to dive right in this year" Ron said smiling. "You take that class too right?" Harry looked over at Draco. "Yeah I do, after all Snape is my godfather it would be rude of me not to" Draco snickered.
"Is he..well you know.." Blaise was very timid, scared of Harry's answer. "Yes very much he is" Harry held Draco's hand. Harry was excited for Blaise, maybe Blaise would find something like Harry and Draco did.
Draco couldn't help but look down at his lips. His red lips, his perfectly shaped red lips. Draco knew one thing and one thing only in that moment, he needed Harry. Harry's arms snaked around Draco's neck. Harry's hand re-tangled into Draco's hair. "Maybe isn't an answer" Draco said softly. Draco's left arm made its way around Harry's waist, sitting him up and pulling him closer. This time Draco only left a mere centimeter of space between them.
"You're not"
"Oh you're awake" Someone said from the darkness. It wasn't fully dark there was a torch or two illuminating certain parts of the room. "Who's there?" Harry said backing up slightly. The person came forwards. Narcissa Malfoy. "Honey it's ok, don't be afraid of me" She said softly and sat next to Harry on the ground. Harry didn't know if he could trust her. He made sure to stay on high alert.
"Come on now Harry" Draco wrapped his arm around Harry's waist and smirked about it because he knew he was giving his godfather a heart attack. Harry looked back at Snape who now had a smug smile on his face.
"Well then guess I get on with it." Bellatrix raised her wand. "Immediate death for you. I won't make you suffer because you are still my nephew" Bellatrix smiled.
Harry was standing right behind Draco. He wasn't exactly sure of what was happening in front of him. Harry couldn't fully see over Draco's shoulder.
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry's waist, pulling him closer. He laid Harry's head on his chest and held him. Harry felt tears well back up in his eyes. He tried to hold it back. "Let it out.." Draco said softly and rubbed Harry's back just as softly. Harry tried to hold it back, but couldn't. All of his emotions rushed out, he cried. He just cried.
The four others began clapping, laughing and smiling. "Look at that everything worked." Draco said smirking. "Worked?" Neville said looking back up. "Yes everything worked Neville end of story" Harry smiled.
"I love you, I love you, I love you" Harry kissed Draco now. Draco smiled. "Plane tickets to Paris." Harry said to Draco. "It's your dream. I want to be the one to fulfill it. Harry it'll be gorgeous" Draco smiled and held Harry tightly.
"Are you sure it's no imposition I don't want to intrude" Harry's eyes flickered from Narcissa to Draco. "Of course it's no imposition. It would be lovely to spend Christmas with you sweetie" Narcissa smiled sweetly.
"James, wake up my little munchkin." Draco placed his hand on his son's shoulder. The little boy just grumbled angrily and turned over to face his dad. "Noo." The little boy said softly. "Come on we have to go to your Nan's house today for Christmas Eve." Draco picked him up and placed him on his lap.
Harry's expression softened. "Fine yes, it's definitely not the...worst" Harry could barely finish his sentence without shuddering. Draco pulled him back down onto his lap. "I feel obligated to agree with you" Draco said holding Harry's hips. They were still messy from their little make out session. "Let's be friends with benefits, or... better yet enemies with benefits" Draco said smirking.
"I mean it's alright if we were, we don't mind leaving" Ron said wanting his best friend to know he was comfortable with Harry being gay. Which now was apparently clear to him Harry was gay, or at least bi.
"Oh is that Weaslette?" Draco nudged Harry softly. Harry nodded. "Wanna go ask her?" Harry looked up at Draco. "Yes, most definitely yes" Draco smiled and walked up to her with Harry.
"Yes love we must. But for now I'm just happy you're alive and well" Draco kissed Harry's temple softly after pushing away a piece of hair that rested upon it. Harry smiled and any remaining pain in his body seemed to dissipate when Draco held him. Draco rested his head atop Harry's. Harry rested his head on Draco's chest and yawned.
Harry unwrapped it, a piece of paper. Harry tilted his head a bit, sort of confused. He opened up the paper. Harry read over the words and basically attacked Draco with a big bear hug. Draco fell over with Harry holding him. Harry was in tears, happy tears.
Harry picked it up and spun it around.
"Alright Potter" Draco said getting up as well. "I'll be off to bed as well, try not to sleep in the bathroom tonight" Draco chuckled. Harry rolled his eyes and turned away walking to his bedroom. He looked back to see Draco staring. Draco's eyes flickered back up to Harry's.
"Of course" Hermione smiled. Ron finished up his food and some of Hermione's just as breakfast was finishing. They all got up from the table. Hermione and Ron hugged Harry. "Have fun this weekend, we'll miss you" Ron said. Hermione nodded in agreement. "I will" Harry smiled. Hermione and Ron both said bye to Draco and left. "Time to read?" Draco looked down at Harry. Harry nodded and walked out of the hall. Draco trailed behind him.
Draco took a deep breath and let go of Harry's hand. "If anything happens to him the two of you are dead" Draco stared at them and stood up. "You have our word" Ron said and patted Draco's back.
Draco's eyes were beginning to pool with tears, he couldn't lose Harry. He couldn't lose the one person he cared for most. He couldn't lose the one person who completed him, the one person who filled the empty hole in his heart. Draco's heart was beating out of his chest, that was all he could hear.
"He said you died, he said you were easily disposed of" Harry said shakily into Draco's shoulder.
"As most of you have seen or heard, Harry Potter has been wounded deeply. I am telling you all this just to let you know, there is no threat. Do not be afraid of another attack. The person who did this to Harry had been taken care of accordingly" Dumbledore cleared his throat. The students were all staring up at the front of the hall attentively.
Draco couldn't control what he was doing anymore. He needed to meet Harry's eyes. Draco put two fingers under his chin and tilted his head so Harry was now looking Draco in the eyes. Draco had prayed Harry wouldn't remember this in the morning. Draco smirked devilishly as if he was just messing around. He honestly didn't know what he was doing.
"You skinny, pale, blond, coward" Harry's face turned serious as he backed Draco up into a corner, the moonlit corner.
Draco laid down with Harry, he never let go of him. He gripped Harry tightly, letting all of his emotions and feelings transfer to Harry through his touch. Harry finally relaxed and sniffed. He looked up at Draco. He saw Draco's beautiful sadness.
Draco placed his hand on Harry's. Harry looked up at Draco and smiled. "I got you a gift." Draco said softly and handing Harry a box. Harry quirked his head. "I've got one for you two." Harry handed Draco a smaller box.
Harry slowly sat up and looked at Draco. Harry smiled softly and leaned in to kiss Draco's cheek. Draco blushed, more than he had when they were making out. Draco smiled and placed his hand on Harry's cheek. "Are you alright now?" Draco said softly, no edge, no anger.
Draco tried to keep it short and sweet. He put them all in envelopes and sent them away. Draco changed into his pajamas and snuggled into bed next to Harry.
"Yes yes my boy, me" His father smirked devilishly. "Where's your little boy toy?" His father looked past Draco's shoulder. Draco took a deep breath. "You will be going no where near him." Draco said angrily.
"Looks like you two will be living to see another day." Draco smiled and walked over to them. "We told you nothing would happen" Ron said and got up from the chair. "How is he?" Draco looked down at Harry.
"Right your room smelled, you're such a prat Malfoy. The excuse you just came up with does not match the timeline of your story" She said smiling and getting up. "Come on Ron were gonna be late to class" She said pushing him out of the room. "But Dumbledore said we didn't have to-" Ron stopped talking when he felt an elbow in his rib cage. "Enjoy the rest of your day Harry." Ron looked over at Harry. "Bye Harry. Malfoy" Ron scowled at Draco. Hermione smiled and pulled Ron out of the room, leaving the dorm.
Harry started mumbling. "it's gonna kill me..it's gonna kill me.." Harry said through sobs. Draco's heart rate shot up, someone was trying to kill Harry. Draco pulled back and made eye contact with Harry. "Who's trying to kill you?" Draco said softly. Harry sniffled and wiped his eyes. Harry spoke softly and shakily.
Narcissa was trying to help in every way she could.
Flashes of different colored lights were flying around the room, the Christmas tree had been knocked down by this point.
Draco wanted to cry as well, he absolutely hated seeing Harry like this. Harry cried, he breathed unsteadily, he sniffled, he let himself relax into Draco's arms.
"I love you too" Harry said into Draco's chest. Draco kissed Harry's forehead. "Look you finally got to say it without interruption" Draco chuckled. "I'm sorry my father tried to kill you." Draco twirled a piece of Harry's hair. "It's not your fault darling" Harry traced the outline of Draco's jawline with his finger.
"You're sure about this?" Draco looked at Harry. Harry nodded and stared at the shirtless blonde. Draco smirked and reconnected their lips. Draco's dominant tongue explored Harry's mouth. Harry was now laying down, a pillow propping his head up. Draco hovering over him. Harry's pants had gotten much tighter, it was quite uncomfortable. Harry bit Draco's bottom lip then took Draco's arm and put it on the waist line of his pants.
Ron chuckled. "How many times?" Ron pushed on teasing them. Draco smirked. "Well once, we've done it once in every room, except mine that one's most definitely more than once " Draco's smirk deepened. Harry went red and looked at Draco. Draco locked eyes with Harry gesturing to go along with it.
Draco woke up as well. He had woken up once he felt the bed lift from under Harry. Draco sat up and looked at Harry. "What the hell are you doing in here?" Draco stared at him coldly. Adding onto the cold floor, Draco's icy gaze didn't help the shiver's shooting through Harry.
"Who was it love?" Harry said from the shower. "Your two best friends" Draco replied placing Harry's clothes on the counter. Harry turned the shower off and opened the shower door. Draco handed him a towel. "Thank you" Harry dried his hair and his body.
He put some clothes on and waited around for them to arrive.
Draco started thinking about what his life would be like without Harry. The only ray of light that shone is Draco's dark life. It drove him crazy that his father interrupted such a beautiful moment between the two of them . If something bad did happen to Harry, Draco would never know if he loved him back.
Harry awoke first the next morning. He had barely gotten any rest. His night was filled with his mind trying to overtake him. Make him do those things he didn't want to.
Harry didn't listen and followed close behind. Draco slowly opened the door. Draco's heart fell. "You." Draco said shakily.
"Mind if we share that cloak, don't really wanna get caught going back in" She said. Harry nodded and got out the cloak, his brain felt sick. What girl? What bet?
"But you hardly ate any of your breakfa-" He stopped talking and sighed. Harry couldn't know Draco noticed, or cared. "What if I got food here? Would you eat? Oh..and...uh.. I'm asking because I'm hungry" Draco said trying to cover up and doing a right awful job at it.
Draco closed the door and re locked it. "Well that was actually enjoyable." Draco chuckled and walked back into the living room. Harry followed and agreed.
A bruise on his right rib cage. A bruise on his shin. A raw cheek from being slapped one too many times.  A blade sitting next to him on his old cot. Harry knew it was wrong he knew he promised Draco he wouldn't. He couldn't take it. He had to. So he did. He did and it felt exhilarating. He cried and cried.
Of course he didn't.
Hermione and Ron mounted theres. Narcissa nodded to them and they took off into the sky. Draco was crying once again. He couldn't lose Harry, that simply wouldn't do. Harry was his everything, his world. Draco loved Harry, Draco truly loved Harry.
Draco smiled and read it. It read...
Ron and Hermione had returned for his coat, they heard the fighting and went inside after using the unlocking charm. They were now watching this intense scene going on in front of them, very confused what was happening.
"Snooping? Me? Never" Harry smiled convincingly. "Really then why is that drawer open?" Draco nodded his head towards a drawer Harry had carelessly left open. "You obviously just forgot to shut it" Harry got up and shut it. "Next time remember to close your drawers, with them open your room looks bloody messy" He sat back down.
"Why did he do that?" Harry whispered to Draco. "I have no idea what the bloody hell goes through his mind" Draco chuckled softly. "But who cares, we're next to each other aren't we?" Draco said sounding like a schoolboy with a silly crush. Harry smiled and nodded.
"Hello" Harry said softly and sat up. Ron and Hermione sat on opposite sides of him. "What's wrong?" Hermione asked. "Drac- Malfoy was rude for absolutely no reason, he was rough and just...cold" Harry shrugged and played with his thumbs.
He opened it to reveal Blaise and Neville standing awkwardly behind him. "We happened to show up at the same time" Blaise chuckled and entered.
"You're very welcome." She smiled. "Let's go eat I'm starved and this conversation seems to be over" Ron groaned, Hermione pulled him away and continued to walk towards the great hall. Ginny was already long gone, she slipped away once she seemed to end the conversation by saying you're welcome.
Dumbledore nodded. "I'll be on my way out now, get good rest for your classes tomorrow"
"Me neither..Harry" Draco smiled and felt relief. He felt pressure release off of him. Harry smiled widely. Draco flew around, up and down. Harry and him would occasionally chase each other like three year old toddlers. They eventually tired each other out and landed down on the ground.
Draco and his mother were talking while Harry came out of the bathroom. "Do you like it?" Narcissa looked at the both of them. "I don't know Harry do we like it?" Draco looked at Harry smiling and wrapped his arm around Harry's waist. "We love it. This is amazing. You've done so much I cannot believe it." Harry smiled and proceeded to look around the bedroom, trying to take it all in.
Draco let his eyes fall to Harry's exposed chest and stomach. Draco felt his stomach churn when he saw the bruises. He could see each of Harry's ribs. Draco's mouth fell agape. He wanted to cry, he never knew how bad Harry had it. Draco wanted to keep Harry safe, he wanted to know who had given those to Harry.
Harry Potter was dead.
"You're right, I'm just so used to things going wrong.." Harry said in a deeper, raspier voice, getting more tired. "It's okay love, just go to sleep" Draco soothed. He rubbed circles on Harry's back. Harry intertwined their legs and began to fall asleep in the arms of his lover.
"Stupefy" Lucius said and pointed his wand at Draco. Draco was stunned, couldn't move, couldn't speak. He fell to the floor with a thud and passed out. The last thing he remembered seeing was his father stepping over his body.
"Apologize? You? Blaise Zabini Apologize?" Draco scoffed and crossed his arms. "I feel terribly awful about what I did, it was low and underhanded. I don't even like Harry in that way. I just was so angry you had found someone...I let it overtake me." Blaise kept switching eye contact between Draco and Harry.
Draco had sat at Harry's bedside for an hour. He hadn't even realized how much time had passed on. Draco just sat there, holding Harry's hand, telling him to stay here, telling him he loved him, and kissing his forehead. Draco was a complete mess. His eyes were puffy and red. He was more pale than usual, which was saying something considering he was already so light.
His eyes immediately landed on Harry, who was sitting up and wide awake. His knees were pulled up to his chest, his arms hugging his knees.
"I don't know why you're asking me Potter. I wouldn't touch anything of yours. I may catch your ignorance." Draco smirked and stared down at Harry. Draco found himself trying to see Harry's eyes. He didn't know why he felt a sudden urge to, but he did. Yet Harry refused to look at Draco in the eyes.
It had only taken them three months after the big day to find their dream home, a countryside manor. A black and white marble manor, Draco's idea. Obviously Draco had the funds for it considering he was filthy rich.
Then they danced.
"Well then let's go." Dumbledore said. "I will be using apparition, the rest of you will be flying." He announced. Draco rolled his eyes. "Great" He mumbled as the brooms were being handed out. Draco mounted his broom and tried to steady his heart beat. He couldn't fly correctly if he was going to be distracted.
Meanwhile...
"Hey Harry you return to classes tomorrow right?" Ron asked. "Yeah why?" Harry said taking a bite of food into his mouth.
"It was fun, we should do it again sometime with all of them. Like a get together" Harry smiled and began cleaning up the wrapping paper. Draco helped. "Everything is so perfect love" Draco smiled. "It really is" Harry smiled as well, feeling light as air.
He wondered how long Harry had been faking.
Maybe golden boy wasn't so perfect after all. Draco felt his heart sink, had Harry been harming himself? Was it because he was always such an insufferable git to Harry? "Why do you have so many bruises" Draco said staring at him "No reason malfoy, I'm really not in the mood to speak about this." Harry stayed in front of the entry way not letting him in.
Harry smiled softly and turned his attention to the glass and wood that separated his seating area from the narrow hallway on the train. Draco passed by, he never did that. Not that Harry was paying attention to Draco or anything. As he passed by, he looked down to Harry. Draco would not make eye contact, he looked at Harry's nose instead. Harry watched Draco's every move in that moment. It was so intriguing to watch Draco try to find somewhere to look.
Harry chuckled and agreed. They continued to have a conversation until house elves came into the room with plates of food. Narcissa came in as well in an emerald green dress. "Wow Mum you look absolutely gorgeous" Draco smiled at his mother.
Harry wanted to rid all of Draco's sadness. Draco wasn't weak, Harry needed Draco to know that. Draco held Harry against his chest. He slowly took control, after all Harry was just a bratty little bottom. Draco felt Harry melt into his touch, connect to Draco's body. Harry fell down onto the bed, his head resting on the silky silver pillowcase.
The upstairs of Draco's home was now much larger, all the rooms had been knocked down and made into one. To the left there was a record player against a wall with a couch in front of it. Straight back was a kitchen, the color scheme of it was marble and black. Marble countertops and black cupboards and counters. To the right was a dining area, a long table with a chandelier over top of it. All the way to the right was a door.
"Harry poo is my soulmate." She smiled and looked off in a daze. "Well 'Harry poo', dumped you. Please stop being such an odd stalker. Goodbye Weaslette" Draco scoffed and turned around. The looks he was receiving on his way to the hall, were disgusting. People were looking at him as if he had murdered someone. Well, not just any someone, Harry. In all honesty he did murder someone but not everyones beloved Harry Potter.
When Harry came to, he was lying on a cold hard floor. It took him awhile to adjust to the dark scenery. Harry's memories of what had happened earlier came rushing back. Harry chewed on the inside of his cheek nervously.
"Looks like Ron left his jacket  here." Harry picked it up and set it on a table. "He can grab it whenever we do our next gathering." Draco smiled and kissed Harry's forehead.
Harry snickered and walked to the Slytherin quarters. "Thanks for the help Potter, maybe you're not as bad as I thought you were. Maybe Draco was right about you" She smiled and whispered the password to her painting and walked in.
"Shag yet?" Pansy said with a playfulness in her tone. Harry just about choked on his spit. "Wh- what?" He said frantically. "Calm down Potter I'm joking, I know he would never shag before taking you to dinner first" She smiled.
"Blah blah blah" Bellatrix rolled her eyes and laughed hysterically. "What's so funny?" Harry asked her. "Nothing, nothing at all" She smiled.
"Tell me when you're leaving from now on" Draco said getting up. "No. you. are. not. my. keeper" Harry said a little louder. Draco bit the inside of his cheek to keep himself from saying anything. He took a moment to look at Harry. Once he felt he had gotten a point across from just this look he got up and walked away to Slytherin table.
Harry looked down to find a branch snapped in half. He hadn't imagined it, someone or something had broken a branch. Harry's heart rate sped up, he tried to calm himself with thoughts of serenity and safety. Probably just an animal.
"No we did not, he's lying. I put much thought into the gifts." Harry smiled a satisfactory smile and sat back as everyone began unwrapping their gifts.
Draco hadn't noticed Harry staring right back at him. For once they weren't angry at one another they were...calm. "Well.. I'll be retiring to bed now" Draco said quietly the tension between the two of them building.
"Really cause you're rather pale" Ron said. Draco smirked and removed his hand from Harry's thigh. "Well I should be getting back to my Slytherin, dinner will be concluding soon" Draco said getting up and leaving. Harry's breathing was unsteady and he longed to be touched again.
Harry could barely focus. He looked over to Draco who was on the floor.. "Dray." Harry's eyes filled with tears. Draco smiled and watched Harry's eyes.
Draco looked back over to Snape. Snape made direct eye contact with Draco as the students were getting out their materials. "Before we get started...Potter" Harry's head shot up to look at Snape. All eyes were turned to him. "Today you will be partnered with Mr.Malfoy" Snape's voice never changed.
He kept his fingers under Harry's chin. Draco's eyes flickered down to Harry's perfect lips. Harry's breathing shook. "Don't lie" Draco let out a whisper. Harry moved a bit closer. Draco's hand moved from his chin to the nape of his neck. Draco continued studying Harry's face. Draco longed to know what his lips tasted like. Harry almost let out a slight whimper but caught himself.
Harry cried and sniffled. He felt bad, really bad. "You should've told me! I can handle it! I was face to face with Voldemort! You think I can't handle your father?!" Harry hit Draco's chest. "I've been through more than you can even imagine! You don't know the half of it! So many times, so many times I was used for gross things that made me feel dirty and sick. So many times I was almost dead." Harry cried and laid his head on Draco's chest.
Just looking in each other's eyes with no hatred just a low burning passion and yearning for the first time in his life.
Harry bit his lip and decided it was Draco's turn to feel good. Harry softly pulled Draco's head away from his neck. Draco just simply stared at Harry. Harry smiled and placed his lips on Draco's jawline. Draco bit his lip softly. Draco didn't like that Harry was trying to pleasure him. Draco wanted to make Harry feel desired, not the other way around.
"Are you sure you want to?" Draco asked once more, very nervous Harry would regret it. "I am 100% sure Draco, stop your worrying" Harry continued smirking. "Now, teach me" Harry unzipped Draco's pants and removed them. Draco inhaled sharply when his pants rubbed against his hard on. Harry but his lip and Draco began trying to guide Harry.
"D- Draco..I'm.." Harry couldn't get out his words. Draco nodded in understanding of knowing Harry was close, he was too. Draco leaned down and kissed Harry passionately as they both climaxed together.
"Aren't these your glasses?" Ron emerged from Draco's room holding Harry's glasses. "Oh yes those are my glasses thank you, how silly of me to forget them" Harry took them and put them on. Ron and Hermione both exchanged a look. "Your glasses were in Draco's room?" Hermione asked him.
"I was jealous. He was my boyfriend at the time, it wasn't an amazing feeling to read about you in his private journal." Ginny chewed nervously on her lip. She felt a little bad for being so rude, Harry looked happy.
Draco was the only one who was not. He was picking at his food.
Draco sighed and poked around at his food. He got up and made his way outside. Once Draco had made it outside he walked over to his spot, his and Harry's spot. Draco set his bag down on the grassy field. He laid his head back against the brick and attempted to calm down. It was difficult lying to Harry, more than it ever had been. Draco knew he had probably done the wrong thing. He always did, always backed down. Such a coward.
Harry cried and cried on. He slowly got up and reached around the back of his wardrobe he found his blade. Harry winced at knowing what he was about to do, he sat on the floor. Harry's vision was blurred, his hands were shaky. He slowly did what he tried so desperately not to. He let out a deep breath when he felt it. Harry looked down to see his blood spilling out. Harry was always careful to not cut too deep.
Harry did not, considering he wouldn't be staying there. He just wandered around the housing he had called home for so many years. It hurt him to have to leave it, but it was also so freeing to know he would have his own dorm. Well sort of his own dorm. The thought of being without his friends scared him. Harry never really enjoyed meeting new people. Having to live with a new person was most definitely going to be quite an adjustment for Harry.
"Are you sure love?" Draco licked his lips and stared at Harry. "Yes please fuck..please" Harry begged and stared at Draco with a needy look in his eyes. Draco smirked and reached over into his bedside table grabbing a small purple bottle and a little foil packet. Draco looked at his bedroom door, it was unlocked.
"Another run in with that twat Malfoy." Ron scoffed and rolled his eyes just as Harry had a few moments earlier. "Let's just ignore him, I want to enjoy myself this year... Voldie's gone so maybe I can actually enjoy the school year. I want to have a calm year" Harry stated, because well he really did want a calm peaceful year.
Harry felt jealousy overtake him, he kept quiet and looked down at the floor. If he looked at Blaise he would've done something he regretted. Harry was creating a long list of hexes in his brain that he could use on Blaise. "Number one Zabini, you don't get to call me Draco anymore, Number two, we will never talk again, Number three, I have plans before lunch after lunch and forever on. Goodbye Zabini." Draco dismissed him and turned his gaze away from Blaise.
Draco lead Harry to one of the beds and sat him down. Harry was looking around stupidly. He looks "Hello boys" Snape said walking in and dramatically waving his robes. "Potter lie down please." Snape pulled out his wand and began an examination to see if any potions were running in his blood stream.
"Me too" Draco whispered back and played with Harry's hair. Harry sighed and didn't let go. Harry was trying to memorize how this felt, how Draco holding him and keeping him safe felt. He wanted to be able to remember it when he was away. Harry wanted to be able to remember this so when he felt like doing his awful habit again he may stop himself. Draco kissed Harry's forehead.
Draco laid Harry down softly. "Is this okay?" Draco asked, his voice now rugged. Harry simply nodded. Draco smirked and let their lips meet again, with passion, a burning hot passion. Harry's head rested on a pillow. Harry's tongue was searching Draco's mouth as well. They were both hungrily making out with each other.
His uncle yelled at him. "Y-yes s-sir" Harry nodded and scurried off the kitchen. "Oh great little old potter has come to disrupt my peace and quiet" his aunt scowled.
Draco smiled a little. "We have to, we can go eat breakfast and then leave ok?" Draco pried Harry's arms off of him. Harry groaned. "It's so early" Harry put a pillow on his face. "Too bad love get up" Draco threw a pillow at him.
Draco and Harry both rolled their eyes sarcastically at Snape's dramatic exit. "Ready?" Draco looked down at Harry. "Ready." Harry smiled and they proceeded to walk out of the large room. They walked through the halls. They received a lot of looks, kind looks. People awing and swooning over the two of them. Harry found it odd that people were paying attention to them. They never had before.
One being that he needed Draco now. The other being he would have to come out, which scared him.
"What's wrong?" Draco said into Harry's ear.
"The other boy is.." Dumbledore had all the student's full attention. He paused a moment to create a murderous suspense, which indeed was killing Harry. Students were murmuring, like usual extremely confused. Dumbledore usually left the whole hall completely confused. His words were always riddles. The hall fell silent again when Dumbledore cleared his throat to continue speaking.
"Well then darling off to bed?" Draco smiled and put his arm out for Harry to grab. Harry grabbed ahold of him and Draco lead him to bed. Harry laid down and nuzzled his face into Draco's neck.
"Oh, nothing just came to check up again that's all no need to be such a prat Malfoy" Hermione scoffed. She had decided to let them fall in love on their own. Not with the influence of Ron and herself knowing about it. Ron looked down at her but quickly looked back up. "So...you two are....?" Ron asked, teasing Harry. "People attending Hogwarts just like the both of you?" Draco said cutting him off.
Draco kissed up to Harry's ear. He sucked on Harry's earlobe. Draco knew he was making Harry feel good. Harry would squirm in his arms  "it's only been four minutes, see not late" Draco whispered against Harry's wet ear. Draco's breath felt cold against the wetness on his earlobe. Harry shivered.
become..friendly" Draco smirked and stifled back a chuckle.
"Leave us alone." Draco said again. "Give him to me." Lucius said and walked even closer, he was now face to face with Draco. Draco stared him dead in the eyes. "No go away!" He shouted.
Dumbledore left the room and the painting closed behind him. Harry sat there for a moment just staring at a wall. "Well then Potter, stay out of my way and I'll do the same for you." Draco said with anger as always. Just as Harry was about to be rude back the painting opened back up. "Oh and you boys have been excused from your classes for the first three days so you can become accommodated to your new room" Dumbledore said with a smile and left once more.
Harry stopped him. "No darling, I have awful morning breath. I don't want to accidentally kill you" Harry chuckled. Draco shook his head and rolled his eyes. "I don't care" Draco kissed Harry softly.  A good morning kiss.
"We are together and I'm sick of hiding it." Draco turned Harry's face towards his own. Draco ran his index finger along Harry's porcelain skin. Harry wrapped his slender hand around Draco's firm arm in which was wrapped around Harry.
"Well that went much better than expected" Harry chuckled and began tidying up. "Well I wouldn't have expected any less from Blaise" Draco said and helped Harry.
Those were some of the many questions running through the miraculous mind of Harry Potter in that moment.
"Another bad time?" Harry and Draco's heads both snapped in the direction of the painting.
"You really care about him don't you?" Ron looked at Draco. Draco sighed and nodded. Hermione smiled. "I'm glad you told us about this" Hermione said. "Honestly, I'm sort of glad you two blokes are here" Draco chuckled. "We are too" Ron smiled.
"We just wanted to see how you were doing." Hermione said as her eyes made their way down Harry's marked up neck. She put the pieces together and got quite frankly grossed out. The sitting down slowly, showering together, the marks. "Seems you two had fun" Hermione smiled and looked between the two of them.
"But we must find him, it cannot be taken lightly that this boy may die. After all he is the chosen one" Snape said. "Malfoy Manor" Draco mumbled. "Malfoy Manor" He spoke up.
Harry nodded and ate small bites of his food. It was most likely cold and unappetizing by now. Draco noticed and felt worried. He knew Harry needed to eat, after all Harry's ribs were visible.  Hermione, Ron, and Harry talked amongst themselves. Draco just watched Harry eat.
Harry and Draco walked into their bedroom shutting the door behind them.
Draco was still laughing when he looked down at Harry. He saw that empty look in Harry's eyes once more. Harry had decided in that moment Draco needed to know everything. There was no way he could hold it back anymore, he needed to talk about it.
“No,” Draco contradicted. What a stupid lie.
All his feigned security drained his body and he felt a heat covering his cheeks. He had blushed. Fuck.
Pansy told them she was going to get ready and less than half an hour later they Disapparated and Apparated in the pub.
“Draco?” He calls frantically, and looks over the edge with trepidation. Harry can only see darkness, and the occasional shimmer.
Sometimes they don’t talk at all; Draco seems to be working his way through a host of muggle novels, some that he’s seen Hermione with and some that are foreign to him, and he’s content to read while Harry dozes. Harry’s seen titles such as
Harry wonders what time it is.
Harry nods, his nose bumping against Draco’s pyjama-clad shoulder.  Draco slips a bookmark between the pages and then flicks to the beginning.
Hagrid, sensing that Harry’s mind is elsewhere, turns and follows his gaze. He sighs.
Harry is quite proud of his metaphor, and glances up to find Draco frowning at him again.
Harry rubs the remainders of sleep from his eyes and finds that he actually feels refreshed, and not like he had just played Quidditch for twenty hours straight and been hit by no less than ten bludgers.
“Okay.  Are you… Do you need anything? Tea? One of those Chinese take-aways from that muggle place? A tub of my ice cream?”
thank you for reading! you can find me on tumblr as dracopetal!! this was originally going to be what i wrote for the drarrymicrofic prompt 'surbubia' but then it got a lot longer and i ended up not even using the prompt word.
quiet. Eerily silent except for Harry’s heavy breaths and Malfoy’s shallow ones. There’s no gentle padding of deer or birds, no leaves rustling as the wind blows through them. Like the Forest remembers what took place there.
“I know,” Malfoy says quietly. He reaches up a hand and tugs a lock of his hair. Harry wonders about that for a moment.
There’s a sharp crack that shatters the humming. His ears pop, and suddenly Harry's being pulled in ten different directions at once. His vision whites out and he almost vomits.
This chapter was originally going to be twice as long, but I had to split it in two. I'll probably post the original other half tomorrow or Sunday.
Malfoy shrugs, turning a page. “Bumped into a door,” He says monotonously.
Harry hesitantly, certain that Draco would pull away, links their pinkie fingers together. Draco’s fingers are cold despite the charm.
Harry is trying to distract him the whole time, holding up different foods and asking what he likes. He already knew, of course, it was him that cooked most often, but it was a blatant attempt to get Draco to stop worrying about the muggles that were surrounding them, and Draco knows it too. His face is pale under the fluorescent lights, his hair and skin the same shade of alabaster. His initial fascination has worn off fast, but the nerves have stayed. Maybe this was a mistake, Harry thinks.
With his eyes shut, he looks like he already belongs in a coffin.
Nineteen days after Draco returned from St Mungo’s, and two nights after Draco had left Harry to wake up with fingers and toes like blocks of ice on the Astronomy Tower,  Harry wakes up to a feeling of dread creeping up through his bones.
On those nights, he pulls out the map and watches Malfoy pace. It’s a good thing they don’t have to share anymore, Harry is certain that any roommate would be driven away by Malfoy’s sleeping habits, or rather, his lack of them.
Pomfrey refused to give him anymore.
curious. Dudley could wait; Harry had a ridiculously expensive cup of tea and half a tub of ice cream to consume first.
“It doesn’t matter. She has her reasons, so don’t go sticking your Gryffindor nose in.”
Harry pauses. “I guess.”
“It’s not,” Malfoy cuts him off. “it’s nothing like that… Just, she’d give you some if you asked. But she’s strict with it, she won’t give it to you all the time.”
He shivers, and Draco glances at him. Harry casts a warming charm over them both, one that should last until the end of lunch.
He doesn’t remember how he gets back to Hogwarts, but suddenly the white tile under his feet turns to slabs of hard stone, and there’s a warm hand on his forehead, and he looks up into the blue eyes of Ron Weasley.
He’s lucky that the Eighth Year common room isn’t too far from the Astronomy Tower, and the stairs seem to be on his side, for he hardly has to wait before another staircase slots into place.
He makes his way to the back of the classroom and slips quietly into the chair next to Draco. Draco flinches, as if only just noticing that there’s other students in the room, and then he just stares at Harry with an unreadable expression.
Harry glares at the boys. “What did you
Harry’s starts, and now he can’t make himself stop. The words keep flowing out of him, like water down a stream, and he needs to
Draco flexes his long fingers. “It’s fine. I didn’t say it last night before I - Thanks. That was… Kind of you. And that was quite powerful magic.” He says the last part almost like an afterthought.
It’s oddly pleasant, in a way. The fire is warm, the couch is soft and comfortable, and the sound of someone else breathing next to him is reassuring.
Malfoy seems to jump out of his skin, head shooting up so fast he smacks his head into the bark. He gasps, and his hand reaches for a wand that isn’t there. Malfoy isn’t allowed a wand, Harry suddenly remembers.
Hermione’s gaze flickers to Malfoy again, and then quickly back to her book. She plasters on a fake smile. “Did I tell you about this? It used to be my favourite when I was little, and my parents remembered! This is a new edition.”
“Not like
He slows down when he reaches the edge of the forest. There’s a small gap in the trees, like a mouth ready to swallow him up, and his heart is thudding almost painfully in his ribcage. For several moments he’s overcome with terror at the thought of stepping into the forest, and having those tall trees surround him, trapping him inside. He’s terrified suddenly at the thought of getting lost, and wandering through the dirt and the dark until he dies. A thought occurs to Harry: Or what if Malfoy had been going to meet a rogue Death Eater, and they were waiting for him?
“Is it?” He whispers back through the side of his mouth, aware that McGonagall’s eyes are somehow closely watching all of them at the same time. “I’m Harry Potter, who cares if I fuck up my exams?”
Mrs Weasley had offered to have him for Christmas, had told him he was as much as a son that Ron was, but he just couldn’t. He felt suffocated by the Burrow these days, too much noise and people milling about, too much pretending to be okay and not acknowledging the empty place at the dinner table and the empty bed in George’s room. Harry couldn’t stand it anymore.
Harry glances at him, and then feels guilty. Draco’s sheets are rumpled, as if he’s just gotten out of them.
Harry still feels eyes on him however, and he feels like an animal at a zoo caged behind glass. The food turns into ash in his mouth, and the hollowness spreads. He glances at Draco.
It’s only when they land in Grimmauld Place that Harry can breathe again. As he draws in a desperate breath, he realises that Draco apparated them.
His side profile is much the same as Harry remembers, huge and mean-looking, except now his hair has more shades of grey than brown. He has the same pudgy fingers, and is now using them to shift through boxes of frozen ready meals instead of balling them into fists aimed at Harry’s head.
!” Malfoy rushes to clarify. “He would just… pet me. He stroked my hair, and used to call me names. It wasn’t like… like he was going to… but he wanted to scare me. And it was f-fucking terrifying. I could never tell anyone else, there was
Ron had looked at him silently, blue eyes full of concern, and Harry had stopped talking. And never said anything about it again.
Draco shakes his head resolutely.
However, despite their unspoken arrangement, one chilled night in mid-February, Harry stumbles down to the common room and finds it empty.
A couple of first years bump into him, and then gasp when they realise who he is. One of them, a girl with curly hair in pigtails whispers: “Wow, it’s Harry Potter!”
The walk there takes thirty seconds at most, but Harry feels like he’s been walking for miles when his back brushes against the wood of his door.
“I can’t imagine that it would come up in conversation much.”
Harry had never told anyone of what truly happened at the Dursleys’. He knew both Ron and Hermione had been able to deduce the gist of it, and though both had asked on a few rare occasions, Harry had always managed to change the subject. The closest he had got to telling Ron was when they were pissed as sailors just after the war, and out of his mind with drink, Harry had told him some story about being locked in his cupboard for a week. There had been a joke in there somewhere, Harry knew at the time he had found it funny, but Ron hadn’t laughed.
They only share one class that day, Transfiguration, and Harry feels relief when he spots him at the back of the class when he comes in late. Hermione is already waiting for him, frowning minutely, her eyebrows and lips slightly pinched. Harry ignores it, and gives Draco a once over as he takes his seat beside her.
Harry regrets that now. What they were now… it was confusing Harry. They aren’t exactly friends, but they definitely aren’t enemies. Somewhere in the middle, and there was something fragile about them now. About Malfoy especially.
Draco strikes two more matches and watches them burn before lighting the candle with the fourth match. He doesn’t need to, when the Lumos begins to flicker Harry can just cast it again, but he supposes it’s part of Draco’s routine.
Draco reopens the box of matches and seems to be counting them. At least that’s what Harry thinks he’s doing, he can’t make it out.
He shakes himself again. It’s a stupid train of thought; he would be missed if he were to suddenly vanish. He’s Harry Potter, the boy-who-lived-twice, and he would not be defeated by a forest.
Vernon looks up. Harry feels like there’s an iron first curled around his throat.
of someone tip-toeing down the steps, the sound getting smaller and smaller until the occasional crash of thunder is the only sound to keep him company.
Until now.
” Another tear slips down his alabaster face, and then another and another. Before Harry has a chance to interject he goes on: “There’s something rotten inside of me - don’t you get it? I’m irredeemable, and you’re the boy who saved us all. I don’t understand why you didn’t just leave me to
A little over a fortnight after the ‘The The Tescos incident’, as Draco had begun to call it, Harry arrives home to find a letter waiting for him on the jade marble of the kitchen worktops. Harry picks it up without thinking and sees that it’s addressed to him.
Harry supposes that it’s nice to wake up and actually feel awake for once, but now he can’t let his mind drift emptily like he could before. He’s awake now, and all he can do is think, curled up next to Draco in his small, cell-like room.
Harry knows that feeling all too well. Any good mood that had formed earlier had evaporated. He stares at the silent water, and pictures what it would be like to go under and not come back up.
Then Harry lifts Draco’s hand higher, to do
It’s not fair. Harry hates the title The-Boy-Who-Lived normally, but he survived
Harry rubs his eyes behind his glasses. “Yes, please.”
Draco doesn’t pull away. Instead he closes his eyes and says:
Malfoy stares at him, and there’s something oddly child-like in his gaze. Maybe it’s the wideness of his wet eyes, or his pouting lips. “Does it hurt?”
For a start it’s more spacious. Naturally, this was the ancestral home of a magical lineage, they would never have to put up with things like lack of
Time had passed almost normally (or as normal as it got for Harry) after that. He kept a close eye out for Vernon, and sometimes felt like he was being watched, but as he never saw the man again he put it down to paranoia. He went back to that same Tescos, this time Draco dragging him along, but although he kept a sharp eye out the whole time, he didn’t catch sight of Dursley.
And Harry knows that someone has given him that bruise, that someone has hit him, and he also knows that Malfoy won’t willingly tell him who it was. Him and Malfoy have gotten into their fair share of physical spats, but this was different. Malfoy, wandless with his thin frame, was as good as defenceless. It was why Harry unconsciously took to keeping an eye on him at the start of the year, why he looked for him out of the corner of his eye without himself realising weeks into the term. And when he had realised, he didn’t exactly stop, but he tried to tone it down a bit.
What happens next is a blur to him: There’s the roar of a Floo, and then Harry’s being ushered through it with Draco’s warm weight still draped over his shoulders, and Pomfrey is speaking to the Healers - they’re in St Mungo’s and then Draco is snatched away from him and he sits - or maybe he falls - into an uncomfortable chair, and then the world drags itself into focus again.
Harry knew that really, if he wanted to know, he would be able to trace Dursley one way or another. But as much as Harry wanted to confront him and see that fear in his eyes, he also wanted to be left alone to forget that Vernon ever existed, for Vernon's sake as well as his.
Harry sort-of convinced Draco to come along with him after he's finished his Auror shift. Draco had been hesitant, still suspicious of muggle supermarkets, and Harry could almost hear Draco getting ready to say “
“But why won’t she give
Draco shakes his head, like a bird shaking off water, and his eyes focus on Harry. He stares at him, wets his lips with his tongue and breathes deeply.
“Yeah. Guess we’ve both had our share of fucked up families.”
Draco was right, is Harry’s first, and only, thought when he reads over the headline.
“Malfoy?”
Malfoy glances at him. “Hey,” He greets.
And Draco… Harry had alluded to his childhood not being the greatest. Draco, like him, had his fair share of horror stories that took place in his childhood home, but they mostly came from the war, and even though Draco had left Lucius to rot in Azkaban Harry knew Draco held a few fond memories of the man close to his heart. And he had his mother, who he still spoke to, who was slowly coming round to the idea of her son being with another man. Even Draco wouldn’t quite understand.
“Yeah. Worst thing is I don’t know what, and knowing Hermione she won’t tell me until I guess, which I won’t. And I just… I don’t know. I just don’t feel anything. Everything’s just… Off. Like the world started to spin in the opposite way to what it used to.”
Harry grabs a plate and serves up a mountain of food onto it, and then shoves it quickly  into his mouth to keep himself from saying anything else. Draco goes back to staring at his food, shoulders more hunched than before, clearly feeling the weight of the stares. Harry feels awful. He only wanted to keep Draco company, and he hadn’t anticipated the silent staring of the rest of the school. Luckily for them the younger years, who hadn’t seen much of their former rivalry, quickly get bored of the silent observation, and go back to their food, starting their own conversations and diluting the silence.
The buzzing in Harry’s ears is deafening now, a constant hum of power. His lungs are burning.
Harry puts on his glasses and sighs, half under Draco’s bed, when he can finally see properly. He’s about to shuffle out from the small space when the light from his wand glints against something stuffed up against the wall, as far away from Harry as it could get.
Harry shoots upwards so hard he almost falls off the couch.
The sight of it stops him, and for several moments he’s too tired to even recognise what’s wrong. And when he realises, he simply stands there blankly.
“Get out.” It’s a hushed whisper, but Harry hears it clearly.
Draco stares at him, and his grey eyes flicker down to Harry’s lips, before he turns away and pulls his cloak tighter around his thin shoulders.
Draco turns to him. “What?”
“It’s a big bed,” Harry says slowly, feeling like he’s daring himself to finish the sentence, “We could share it, if you want.”
It also has the slight musty smell that many old lived-in houses have. Unlike Privet Drive, a gentle flow of magic washes through the house, and when he curls down in the cupboard its warmth envelopes him like a blanket.
“Dudley.”
He blinks and moves to rub his eyes, but a hand ghosts over his forehead.
There’s a candlestick next to his bed, but instead of lighting it he just watches the match, and Harry watches him, and the match burns down to nothing, and small black pieces of wood float down onto the covers.
be particularly enraged if I were to put every tub in my trolley? Our ice box thingy isn’t big enough, even with shrinking charms, but I reckon I could place stasis charms on quite a few of them and keep them in the cupboards. Oh, I know Mother would be nauseated if she were to see all of the sugar inside them and would worry for my teeth, but how unhealthy can they be, really? Ice cream won’t make me fat if I eat too much of it, it’s practically a liquid. Surely -”
“Oh, please, don’t give me that bullshit. You weren’t
Harry couldn’t blame her if she didn’t.
Draco’s freshly painted door opens slowly, and then wider when Draco sees it’s just Harry. Harry glances at him, his heart still pounding, and then Draco looks into the dark corridor and opens the door to let him in.
“Yes, I’m fine.” He says, and actually means it.
Draco lets out another groan, and Harry reaches across him and fumbles for his glasses and wand. He manages to grab his wand, but his glasses tumble onto the carpet.
Harry’s never been good at comforting people. Had never learned how; as a child there had been no one to teach him, and by the time he got older everything he did just felt awkward. But that night in the common room Harry had done something right, so he wraps his arm around Draco, who leans into him without any noise, and silently cries into Harry’s chest.
Harry’s blabbering, and Draco’s just staring at him and nodding occasionally, a pensive look on his face. It’s only when Harry finishes that he realises that the tables around them have gone quiet.
After the candle is lit, Draco checks the clock, which Harry can only see the outline of.
Harry says firmly.
He doesn’t see Hermione in any other lessons that morning, and then he begins to worry. He takes the stairs to the dorm two at a time, and then remembers that he won’t be able to get into her dorm, as boys and girls were still prohibited from each other's sleeping spaces. Luckily for him the Patil twins are in the common room, so he asks one of them to go look for her for him. Padma does, and then she comes back down grim-faced.
“Why are you asking me about dying?”
Harry nods, shifting Draco’s weight slightly as the thinner boy stares blearily around at the empty beds. “That's what they said.”
A quiet voice comes from his left. “I’m not going to jump.”
Harry looks up at him properly for the first time since he started talking; his face is tight with barely contained fury, but there’s guilt hidden in his eyes. Harry had seen Draco look like that before, especially in those early months after the war when Draco had been almost paralysed with shame, and he could never stand it, even before they became close, but especially not now.
“Well. I was going to say that even my father wouldn’t have done such a thing, but he probably would have.”
Malfoy starts to gasp wetly.
Draco’s pulling papers from the mess on his desk, however Harry’s not sure if he’s actually doing anything. He keeps his back to Harry, and it hurts, because Harry knows it’s a dismissal.
Without meaning to, Harry drifts off into a dreamless sleep.
“You really ought to get here on time, Harry, this is an important year for you.”
Harry interrupts her before she can get the wrong idea. “No! No, it’s nothing like that. It’s just, when you were away we, uh, talked. Sort of. And then I didn’t see him until now. He probably just went home to his mum, but when we talked he seemed a bit, um, doesn’t matter really. I just was sort of worried about him, I suppose.”
Harry doesn’t know for sure what Draco’s talking about - today, or Christmas Eve in the forest, or maybe he’s thinking about a bloodier event, when Harry had slashed his chest open in the bathroom. That was only a couple of years ago, but it felt ancient.
Hermione doesn’t notice that Harry’s not all there, engrossed in her book, eating the occasional spoonful of milk-sodden cereal.
Harry adapted. He had no choice in doing anything else, but he had escaped them years ago, and now after feeling that freedom, the idea of living in the same house as a Dursley made him feel sick.
Shit.
“Where’s Granger?” Draco asks, still staring at the surface, as if waiting to be proved wrong.
“You’re not mad.”
Malfoy’s eyes slip shut, as if the conversation was starting to exhaust him.
Malfoy, the fingers of one hand still twisted in the limp strands of his hair, just nods at him, and Harry knows that he understands.
He reasons to himself that it can’t be too bad; he’s read bits and pieces of
“Ouch,” He rubs the spot on his head. There is the sudden sound of footfalls above him. He freezes, hand on his head.
But why was Malfoy here? It was definitely him that he spied through the window, Harry knows Malfoy anywhere, but why? Of all places in the middle of winter, why here? There had to be a reason. And Harry is determined to find out.
Draco lets out a small noise, a mix between a groan and a whimper, and Harry shyly places a hand on his shoulder, unsure whether it’ll be a comfort or not. Draco twitches again, his hands coming up to clutch his head, and then the noise he lets out is high and shrill, like the sound of a cat caterwauling, and Harry shakes him.
“I don’t know why I said that. I just need you to know I still have it. It’s in my room on my desk, and I don’t use it because I don’t want it to get stained because it’s precious now. I had lots of teacups at home, some of them ancestral china cups, but the other Death Eaters used to smash our family things and I don’t know how many are left. I haven’t been able to go back and count. I think I will when the holiday starts. Or maybe I can ask Mother to count them for me.”
“Yes, and I could have killed him. Oh, god, I could have killed him. They way he looked at
Harry sees Draco hesitate, and the nightmarish image of waking up to Voldemort above him abruptly pops into his head, and he’s about to say
“Oh. I dunno. Said she was busy with something. I’ve done something to piss her off.” He admits, and then lays down on the dock. He feels Draco watching him.
He stands for a moment more, getting his bearings before deciding which way to head in. It is as he is doing so when he hears a soft sound, like a heave of a heavy breath. It’s only for a moment, and then an unnatural silence fills the air around him.
“When He was in the… the manor,” Malfoy starts, voice cracking on the second word. “He used to come into my bedroom. And. He would wait until I was actually a-asleep, which wasn’t… often. And then he would touch me.”
Malfoy gives no indication that the question upsets him, but he’s not forthcoming either. “Yes,” is all he says.
“You not hungry?” He asks between mouthfuls, nodding at his full plate.
“Oh, was it… was it as bad as you thought it would be?”
He half-walks, half carries Draco to the door of the classroom, where he turns and spits, full of acid: “
“Malfoy,” Harry means for it to come out strong, but instead his voice is hoarse, raspy.
young. They all were.
“Sorry, did I interrupt you?”
Draco sits awkwardly on his own bed and observes Harry. “Are you, um, do you want to stay, just for a bit? I don’t mind.”
“Yes.” Harry says. He expects Draco to at least argue a little, but instead he flicks his wand and wordlessly Accios two pillows from their bedroom. He sits on one, and passes the other one to Harry. Harry hugged it to his chest.
He's exhausted. Harry rests his head against Draco's breastbone, and presses his cheek into the soft wool of his dressing gown. Draco, stiff and unmoving, lets him rest. Harry doesn't notice the contemplative look on his face as he drifts off into a dreamless sleep.
“What happened to your face?”
“Oh,”
but there’s another shout, this one higher than the last, and it sounds sickeningly familiar and he can’t ignore it.
They're not in front of the bed, so Harry flops onto the floor like a fish thrown onto land, and looks under the bed. Well, feels under the bed, as even with his wand all he can make out are blurry shapes.
I haven’t slept since Father was arrested, before sixth year. I’m so fucking exhausted, but I can’t sleep, so I come down here for some peace and quiet, but then you just have to stick your nose -”
He doesn’t know how long he waits while he gets nothing but silence from the other room; there’s a ticking clock somewhere nearby but he can’t lift his head to look. Eventually, after an eternity, a Healer in bottle-green robes slips quietly out of the room.
he can’t stop and Draco’s just
Meeting Draco becomes a strange night-time ritual. Some nights he would be lucky enough to steal a few hours of sleep before being startled awake, some nights he lay under the sheets like a mannequin, empty and hollow inside. But almost every night he would get up when the moon was still high, stuff his wand and the map into the waistband of his pyjamas, and tip-toe down the cold stone steps into their common room.
but the words turn sour on his tongue and he can’t get them past his teeth.
Then Draco looks at Harry, and his bottom lip wobbles tellingly, and he drops his head into his hands.
Malfoy opens his book back up after the conversation tapers off, and for a few minutes the only sounds are the flicker of the flames and the gentle
Maybe Draco was just a light eater, and was able to survive on a snobs diet of two grapes and a gulp of pumpkin juice, but Harry didn’t think that was quite right. In general, Draco looks like he’s ready to fall over at any moment.
in irremovable ink, back in December)
While Harry mutely waves his wand over a small china doll and wills it to turn into a tea cup, he can feel Draco watching him. Harry concentrates on the task, and once in a while the doll will twitch, and perhaps a limb will extend, or the colour of it will change, but it always returns back to the small china doll, staring blankly up at him.
“Don’t bother,” He slurs, hand coming up to dab at the blood seeping from his forehead. “He’s not … worth… not… my head hurts”
“Do you want to see my scars?” Draco asks in a whisper some minutes later.
also thank you for your comments and kudos!
It wasn’t like
Malfoy runs his fingers over the cover. Flames dance across his profile, and in the dim flickering light he looks much older than his eighteen years. Harry wonders if that’s how he looks sometimes, worn out and frayed at the edges.
“Is it good?” Harry has never been a big reader, but he’d find a subtle way to ask Hermione for any book suggestions, if Malfoy wanted.
He should leave it. Hermione’s sick, and if she hasn’t come to classes she must be really sick, and he needs McGonagall
The rest of the morning passes in a blur. Harry isn’t even sure how he gets to each class, but somehow at lunchtime he ends up alone in the entrance to the Great Hall. He does remember Hermione telling him to go to lunch without her, and still Harry isn’t sure what he’s done wrong, but she disappears before he can gather the energy to call out to her.
‘To Harry Potter
“It’s like He carved everything out, and just left empty husks behind.”
“I’m sick in the head. I think I always have been. I’m not… there’s something not right in me. It was alright before, because I didn’t care, but I know there’s something wrong with me. It’s always been
Harry considers it. “No. I just need time.”
. Harry still doesn’t really know why. By all means he should hate Malfoy, but whenever he tries he just pictures Malfoy’s tearful face on the Astronomy Tower, lowering his wand a second too late.
“Funny shaped door,” Malfoy continues in that same flat tone. He’s lying, it would be obvious even to a flobberworm, but Harry doesn’t push it. Not yet.
“Yes you did.” Harry is about to argue that he truly had no clue what the spell would do when Draco carries on, “I meant to hurt you. I was going to use the Cruciatus curse on you. I don’t know if it would have worked. Maybe nothing would have happened. Maybe I would have tortured you in Myrtle’s bathroom. It worked on Rowle, you know that. Maybe I would have been a torturer instead of a murderer.”
Still, he moves on quickly through the aisles. Harry has to break into a jog to keep up with him.
, and the sleeve of his pyjama top rides up, revealing the faded dark mark, latched onto his skin like a parasite. The skull on his forearm doesn’t move, but Harry can’t stop himself looking, morbidly fascinated.
When he was small enough to be in primary school, they had learnt about mines, Harry couldn’t remember what class it was. It was easy to get lost in a mine, alone in the dark, and so people would take pieces of string and tie them to the exits, so no matter how far in they went, they would always be able to find their way out if they remembered their piece of string.
“Tea. That expensive kind your mum sends you.”
He can’t. His head is cloudy with lack of rest, but he knows he won’t sleep anymore today. Rays of the morning sun are just starting to filter through the curtains.
“What?”
“You’re not a freak. Those muggle relatives are the freaks, for doing that to a child!” Draco burst out. “Even my father -” Draco abruptly stops.
Harry wants to argue, wants to make Malfoy shout at him again, wants to shout at Malfoy for being so
“Merlin, yes.” Draco doesn’t need to be told twice, he tosses his cutlery onto his plate and grabs his bag from his lap.
She’s young, pale-faced with a splattering of brown freckles across her nose. Her face is set in a hard line, and for a moment he’s reminded inexplicably of Ginny at her most determined.
A single, salty tear slips from Draco’s eye. It slides down his face and makes a tiny dot on his pillow. “Why? I don’t understand you. You should stay away, everyone else did.”
There had to be over a dozen empty vials under Draco’s bed.
“That - That man in the Tescos, that was him, your Uncle Vernon, wasn’t he?”
Draco goes stiff upon waking, looking through Harry rather than at him, eyes fixated on something past him. Harry looks, but there’s nothing but a blank wall.
and Harry recognised that book as one Hermione had read. Draco frowns at the pages at several points.
“Don’t compare yourself to them, Draco. You were nasty and spoilt, but you were never anything like the Dursleys’...Well, when we first met you did remind me of Dudley, but not because you were very scary, you were just really annoying.”
Draco doesn’t lift his head when Harry approaches, doesn’t take any notice of him. Harry sits quietly into the chair opposite, and suddenly realises that his front still smells of vomit.
about you!”
“No, nothing like that. It’s - I got a letter today.” He says hoarsely.
A figure rounds the bottom of the steps and pauses at the door to the cupboard under the stairs, open just a crack. Then long pale fingers curl around the frame, and slowly pull it open.
Mouth stuffed with cotton, he nods.
this chapter took me forever for some reason, and I actually had to split it. The next chapter will probably be a bit shorter, but I promise that i did plan the plot to this and it is going somewhere!
going to do about it?”
Harry wonders what happens if you take Dreamless Sleep after already taking a lethal dose of it.
“Is…” He can barely dare to ask, “Is Draco going to die?”
Harry nods. “Yeah, of course I will.”
“Do you want me to burn it?”
“Draco -”
Draco laughs, harsh and unkind. It’s more of a demented cackle.
Well, like a child after a nightmare. Out of the black suits Malfoy had worn throughout sixth year, he suddenly looks incredibly young.
“Nothing… Just, it was alright. Last night. I slept better than I normally do.”
any?” Harry asks boldly, feeling strongly that something wasn’t right, but also feeling wrong-footed because he couldn’t quite figure out what it was.
“Why are you here?” Draco asks hoarsely.
It’s meant to come out as a joke, but it’s humourless to even his own ears. His voice sounds hollow, the empty feeling from before returning full force. Hermione returns to her own work wordlessly, and Harry gets the feeling that he’s wronged her, but isn’t sure how.
“What are you doing with
“I died here.” He blurts out in a near whisper, and Malfoy does turn to him then. He looks at him, not quite meeting his eyes.
He relaxes slightly when he realises it’s just Harry.
sitting idly on his covers. Such an intense look passes over his features that Harry almost takes a step back (but he couldn’t anyway, as he was still sitting, and the most he could do without hitting the wall was a pathetic shuffle), and Harry recognises it as envy.
But Harry can't answer. He doesn't know. He’s never done anything of the sort.
Harry shrugs again, shoulders aching from sitting in such an odd position. “Nothing.  There’s nothing I can do, and nothing you can do. I just have to sit here, and wait for him to show up again, and then I’ll still do nothing. I love a quiet life.”
He should just go back to his room and keep the light on until sunrise, but the thought of staying alone in that room makes him colder than the winter air.
“About them though…” Draco starts. Harry cuts him off.
Harry stares at him blankly, the words washing over him like a gentle wave washing over soaked sand. Ron pulls him close, and Harry rests his head on his shoulder, and crumples.
A magical letter then, since it didn’t have his full address, but one sent by a trusted owl, since it knew where it was going. He glances down at the small scrawl at the bottom corner of the envelope.
The Fat Lady gapes at him as he takes the stone steps two at a time, feeling more alive now, in this mad pursuit of Malfoy, than he had done all year.
“I think this calls for some tea.”
Harry gave a small, humourless chuckle, more of an acknowledgement than laughter.
Draco’s face spasms, and something like anxiety passes through him before he smooths out the expression. “Does it have to be done here?”
Harry sinks to the floor next to him, deciding not to comment on the matter-of-fact tone. Harry tries to let the words come naturally to him like Hermione said, but now, faced with Draco finally, he still has not a clue what to say.
He’s not really there for the rest of the class, and he doesn’t feel the looks he and Draco get from the other students. He’s dimly aware of giving Draco the teacup after class, and of him gently tucking it into his bag, like it’s something precious. Through the fog that has suddenly overtaken his mind, something in his chest soars like a shooting star.
It was a stupid idea in itself. Vernon was a cruel man, but he was no child snatcher, and he certainly wasn’t going to abduct Harry and lock him in another cupboard.
Harry closes his eyes, and then quickly opens them again when he’s faced with darkness. “No. But… I didn’t really die, I suppose. I thought I might.”
Harry watches Malfoy’s throat bob as he swallows heavily, and then brings a hand up to his mouth, his other arm curling around his stomach. “Oh,” He mumbles. “She never… never mentioned that.”
He freezes, and sets the letter gently down on the worktop, and then goes to his cupboard.
Harry knows that Draco wasn’t allowed a wand, obviously, he’d been there when the sentence was handed to him. But without really seeing it, he never appreciated how difficult Hogwarts classes are without a wand.
he wants to say,
“Malfoy,” Harry repeats, searching for words. Malfoy barely glances at him.
Pushing the thoughts of what could’ve been out of his head, and trying to ignore the empty feeling that was crawling its way up from his belly, he rests his head in Draco’s soft hair and closes his eyes.
He’s panting by the time he reaches the top of the Astronomy Tower, wand grasped in his hand.
“I know.”
Harry lays on his own bed in the light of the morning sun and wonders about the empty potion bottles under Draco’s bed.
In any other context the whine creeping into Malfoy’s voice would make him laugh, but the
Draco glances at the gap between his mattress and the floor and then back at Harry, and Harry manages not to look obviously guilty. He chews his bottom lip for a second, and then goes over to his desk. He almost collapses into the chair.
Of course, Harry knows logically how that Malfoy and this Draco are one and the same, and what had happened to them both to cause such a drastic change, but it was still difficult for his mind to picture it. And what made it more difficult was that Harry somehow didn’t care that Draco was marked for life, Draco was his
It was never you or any of your friends. And I still don’t know why you keep on being nice to me.”
Malfoy doesn’t acknowledge him, and maybe he’s just embarrassed. But Harry can’t stand the silence between them. Him and Malfoy have been many things, most of them bad, but they have never been silent.
Vernon looks up, and seems as shocked as Harry is. His eyes widen a fraction, and then his piggish face twists into a frown. He stares at Harry, and then his eyes shift to Draco, his hand still on Harry’s arm. Vernon takes in Draco’s soft white-blond hair, with strands falling over his pale face, rakes his beady eyes over his tight jeans and his long fingers, and Harry just knows what he thinks of him. What he’s thinking of them both. Vernon’s face twists again, this time into a snarl, and he takes a single step towards them.
Harry stands frozen for a moment, his breath making the fog of the window worse, before he shakes himself. Malfoy is gone completely, and the thick trees stand menacingly tall, and Harry feels sick. He often does now, but this isn’t a dull agony swirling in his belly, this feels like a sharp pain in his chest, like a knife between the ribs.
Harry doesn’t argue, but he doesn't continue talking either, instead just stares at the fire as the flames begin to dwindle. Malfoy likely doesn’t notice; his eyes are still shut and he was breathing evenly. Harry’s certain that he’s asleep, or would make a very good actor.
But still, irrational as the thought was, Harry couldn’t stop his mind from thinking about it. What if they had succeeded in hiding his magic from him, and had just kept him in the cupboard like some human house elf forever? What if he had never been magical, and they were cruel for the sake of cruelty? What if he saw Vernon again, and he raised his hand to him?
For a moment Malfoy glances up and their eyes meet, and Harry awkwardly raises his goblet of pumpkin juice in greeting, and pretends that he wasn’t staring. Malfoy’s frown stays on his face, but he gives a small nod before he goes back to miserably pushing food around his plate.
He stumbles over to Draco’s bed, and Draco makes room for him and then tucks the covers up to their shoulders. There’s a moment after when he just stares silently at Harry, before he blinks and picks up his book.
“Oh,”
“I lived with my aunt and uncle. You know, they were my only relatives who could care - take me in. I had a cousin.”
“That’s not what - you don’t know that! And even if it did - you’d come back from it. You always do.”
Draco’s rambling, and Harry’s struggling to keep up with each thread and tie them together in a way that makes sense to him.
Harry raises an eyebrow. “Really?”
Harry flexes his fingers. “Come on, that warming charm is starting to wear off. You’ll freeze.”
Harry recalls briefly studying it with Hermione and Ron. Harry didn’t particularly like taking it; the drowsiness it caused made him nauseous, but he had studied the effects anyway.
“I am sorry about cursing you. I didn’t know what the curse did. I didn’t mean to hurt you.”
Well, if Harry’s already interrupted one of Draco’s reading sessions, he’s certainly not about to kick him off his own bed. But the desk chair is, like the identical one in Harry’s room, incredibly uncomfortable, as if whoever designed them wanted to stop them from studying, and Draco’s bed looks warm and inviting.
The matron shakes her head sharply. “No! But he needs to go to St Mungo’s, I don’t have the equipment or the staff to deal with this. Draco, can you hear me, sweetheart? Come on, just open your eyes a bit - Good, keep them open.”
Draco nods without satisfaction. His face is wearing a look that Harry can’t quite decipher.
sent the curse at me, it was your mother who looked him in the face and lied to him. But before she did so, she asked me if you were alive. She didn’t lie for me, Malfoy, she lied to Voldemort for
Harry jerks around. Draco is curled up under his cloak on the wooden floor of the balcony, leaning against the railing, facing the drop. The night wind whips at his face, making his hair flutter. There’s a bald patch on the left side of his head.
Somewhere in Islington, London’
Him and Hermione sat in a corner in the common room or the library most nights, when they weren’t on a floo call with Ron, but Harry didn’t mind being alone in the evenings.
“Funny shaped bruise.”
Malfoy slams his book shut so forcefully that the flames quiver.
“So do you.”
Despite the fact that Draco is the person Harry now talks to most outside of Hermione and Ron, Harry has never actually seen inside his room. It’s disappointingly almost identical to Harry’s, with the same bed and desk and chair. Draco’s room doesn’t have a window, though.
And then his stomach churns, because that must mean something awful.
Harry can barely think straight the rest of the evening. Draco hounds him for answers, wanting to know
There were more than a dozen empty vials under Draco’s bed.
“Don’t be,” Draco whispers. Harry doesn’t know what else he can say, kneeling next to Draco on the Tower as he caresses the marks he bestowed upon him, however Draco intercepts Harry’s featherlight touches, and with an air of hesitancy that makes Harry think that Draco thinks he will push him away, he delicately laces their fingers together, as gently as if Harry were made of glass.
“Hey, McGonagall said that something happened with Malfoy,” Ron starts, and Harry thinks that’s not the half of it. “Hermione’s not very well, she would have come with you otherwise.”
“When I first learnt that the Earth turned, I thought Mother was lying to me. I was certain that we’d fall off.”
that bathes the room in a warm yellow glow. He shakes Draco again just as he whimpers, and finally it’s enough to wake him.
“Yeah. And my Aunt Petunia and my Uncle Vernon. They weren’t…” Harry lost the words. He swallows, mouth dry as a desert.
“Why did you go into the cupboard, though? Don’t you hate it?” He asks suddenly
if he had of come any closer I really would have killed him, and I didn’t even mean to. He’s here somewhere, he must live close, and I haven’t thought about him in years. But I saw him for the first time since I was seventeen yesterday and now I can’t stop bloody thinking about him.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, I
McGonagall carries on her lesson, and Hermione nudges Harry with the feathered end of her quill.
Harry’s fine with those terms, in fact he’s glad of them. Unlike Draco, Harry likes the idea of someone else between him and the end of the bed.
“I dream about dying, sometimes.”
Without a wand, he can’t even cast a warming charm.
Malfoy is curled up in an armchair by the fireplace, his hair unusually tousled, and clad in a pair of pyjamas and a dressing down, his socked feet tucked under him, a box of matches on the arm. Harry hears the soft flick of a page, but can’t make out what he’s reading.
and having his magic pour out of him.
They settle near the lake, not far from Hagrid’s hut, and Draco kneels on the dock and stares into the water, his hair once again falling over his face, his pink lips pouting slightly. Harry is suddenly thrust into a memory from primary school History class, when they had learned about Narcissus, a man who fell in love with his own reflection, and the painting they had been shown. Harry had thought that the man was pretty, however when he said it out loud his teacher had stared at him oddly, before pointedly ignoring him the rest of the lesson.
Draco is, once again and unsurprisingly, missing from breakfast. Harry had been trying to talk to the elusive Slytherin since that night on the tower, but he had taken to moving about the entire castle instead of pacing in his room, and Harry had yet to catch him unawares.
Draco flexes his toes in Harry’s lap. Neither of them were the best at dealing with feelings; they hadn’t said the L-word yet.
Harry can’t think of anything to say in response, so he squeezes Draco’s hand again instead. Long fingers entwined in his own lightly squeeze back.
Harry takes a couple of steps forwards, and Malfoy doesn't move. He clears his throat, and Malfoy jumps like he’s been struck by lightning. He snatches up his book and holds it tightly to his chest.
Somehow Hermione had known, and it seemed like a lot of other people knew, but no one had told
Harry gets up and tip-toes quietly over to the armchair, and then stands still, feeling stupid. Harry doesn’t know how to wake him up gently, he had never done it for anyone who was caught in a nightmare.
Harry nods, and then shakes his head, and then nods again. He laughs, and it sounds manic to his own ears.
He has to wait again, and this time hears a thump, and realises it’s coming from an abandoned classroom at the end of the corridor. He springs into action, races down to the door and throws it open, wand raised.
He drifts back off to sleep  surprisingly easily, encompassed in the smell of ash and roses.
“Yes,” He says instead, so quiet that it’s almost lost to the wind.
Malfoy’s voice had lost the dull monotony, and now he was blazing, close to the boy Harry had hated, but unlike then there’s crack in his complexion. His eyes are haunted, still.
Draco holds it out hesitantly, uncurling his fingers little by little. The skin of his palm is pink and blistering; it must hurt, but Draco doesn’t make a sound as Harry takes his hand in his and silently waves his wand over it, not casting one spell, simply thinking
And Harry understands Malfoy, too. Harry had never had to live in the same house as the Dark Lord, but Harry knows what it’s like to wake to red eyes. He knows what it’s like to have terror grip your very soul and dig its claws in, to feel the despair in the pit of his stomach rise through his body, and have the feeling stay with him even long after waking up, managing to admit to himself in the quiet stillness of night that even though Lord Voldemort was finally dead and the Horcrux inside of him was gone, he would forever carry some part of Tom Riddle with him.
He’s panting like a dog now, but he can’t stop. He sprints past Hagrid’s hut without sparing the groundskeeper a thought.
Draco lets out a small noise in his sleep, and then Harry remembers suddenly where he is, and calms down. He can’t see out of the window because Draco’s room doesn’t have one. He pulls the duvet up to his chin and stares blankly at the blackness above him.
But the idea of Malfoy being up to something both sickened Harry and made adrenaline pump through his veins. He had been watching the disgraced former Death Eater closely those past few months, and Harry had become increasingly aware that it was like someone had sliced him open and hollowed him out as well, and probably the same someone.
“Thanks.”
Harry isn’t really angry with her; Hermione coped with stress by lecturing. However the lecture lasted for over two hours, so Harry decided that he wouldn’t be pestering her about it again.
“Know what?” He presses, but Hermione’s already clamming up.
“Oh?”
“Tea it is.”
Harry peered into the water next to him, and the water stayed still, barely rippling despite the January breeze. He was reminded of the eerie silence in the Forbidden Forest on Christmas Eve, as if even the animals knew that something terrible had happened.
Draco carries on reciting his monologue on the health benefits of muggle ice cream, but Harry’s not listening over the sound of buzzing in his ears.
“What are you looking for?”
Really, it’s not like they’re friends, even though they certainly aren’t arch-enemies anymore, and Harry is sure that he can convince himself that Malfoy can handle it.
Hermione notices that he’s not paying attention, and she glances in the same direction before letting out a quiet sigh. Harry jumps, and turns back to her.
He has a pleasant Christmas alone. He gets plenty of presents, some from complete strangers, and he writes letters to those he cares about. Apart from tea with McGonagall in the afternoon, he spends the day by himself, and he finds it refreshing.
“You’re stalking me again.”
but he
Another nightmare wakes him in the early hours of the morning, leaving him gasping under sweat-soaked sheets. Through his window all Harry can see is a black sky stretching on for miles, but he knows he won't go back to sleep. Like most of his sleepless nights, he opens up the map once he has his breath back. And to his surprise he finds Malfoy not in his room, but in the common area shared by the Eighth Years. He’s alone, and Harry’s grateful for it.
Harry licks his lips. “I need to tell you something.”
where it happens.
In the end, Harry tells Draco absolutely everything. They’re in the library, Draco’s favourite spot in the house that Harry has grown more fond of, and Harry’s curled up next to Draco in front of a roaring fire, cradling a cup of Draco’s expensive tea, and he lets the rest of it spill out of him. Every shout, every slap, and lock being drawn.
“When I was small…” Harry starts, and then stops. He didn’t know which words were right in a situation like this, did he only tell Draco the gist of it, or did he unload everything from his god awful childhood at once? How could he even form the words for something like this?
of Draco that he ate like a bird on the best of days. Harry decides that if he doesn’t see him before lunch then he’ll search for him on the map.
“McGonagall must think I’m crap at lighting matches.” He says quietly, more to himself than Harry.
Whereas Harry’s limbs become more loose as he talks, the tension fading out of him, Draco gets stiffer until Harry can hardly feel him breathe. He’s practically shaking when Harry trails off at the dementor incident.
Draco’s room is at the very end of the corridor. The other rooms are clustered together, the doors next to each other, but it seemed like Draco’s room was added on as an afterthought, secluded and isolated from the other students.
“I know,” Is the only thing Harry can say in response. He clenches his fingers around clumps of dirt and tries not to think of red eyes.
“Well,” Draco waves his hand at them both, “stranger things have been known to happen.”
Harry picks up his wand and closes his eyes, and thinks one, two, three. There’s an almost silent clack as he taps the tip of his wand against the face of the doll.
with Draco, ever since that first meeting in the robe shop.
would be the honest answer but, for all Harry’s social awkwardness, even he knows that that wouldn’t go over well.
The fire isn’t lit, and without any light shapes begin to form in the corners of his vision. Something that could have been a bookcase transforms in the dark into the silhouette of a man, and Harry hears a whisper that could have been the wind or could have been a high voice, and he legs it back up the stairs to the boy’s dormitories.
“Why are you here, Malfoy?” Harry settles on eventually, thinking it sounded innocuous enough.
“Oh, sure. I’ll go, I’ve got some… homework. Hermione’ll kill me if I don’t get it done, it’s an important year and all that.” He rambles, grabbing his wand off the bed going over to the door.
Harry falls, rather than sits, next to him. The cold earth penetrates the thin fabric of his pyjama bottoms, and he’s immensely glad that he can cast as many warming charms as he wants. He studies Malfoy’s side profile. He’s still staring blankly ahead, eyes locked on something Harry can’t see, and occasionally he sniffs. Malfoy’s lips are still blue, but there’s a tinge of colour returning to his cheeks.
“Sorry, you were saying?” He says, shovelling too much food into his mouth. Hermione raises an eyebrow at him, and he gives her an apologetic look while trying not to choke. She leans towards him and starts whispering.
“Well, the last time I thought you were up to something, you
Draco fiddles with his duvet, smoothing the creases in it. “Uh, no. I wasn’t asleep. I was reading. I was going to go down to the common room, but it’s bloody freezing, isn’t it?”
“Hey, Draco, it’s me,” Harry says, angling his wand so it illuminates them both. “You’re at Hogwarts, you said I could sleep in your bed last night, you’re not there, He’s -
a shorter chapter but I needed to get to the end point. I sort of view this story in two parts, and this would be the end of part one.
He scans the the map for his name almost religiously, and even tries lurking outside the Room of Requirement, but the wall remains unchanged every time. It's not stalking, he tells himself, it was just pure concern. Which was not something he ever thought he’d feel for Malfoy, but stranger things had happened.
“You’re a traitor, Harry Potter!” He shouts. Or maybe he whispers it, Harry can barely make it out over the thunder in his ears. His wand is forgotten, and whatever the emptiness inside was holding back now flows out of him, like water overfilling a gutter.
together.
“If you take the wall end. I can’t… You can’t box me in.”
Apparently when Northern Lights was originally published, it was only released as The Golden Compass in the US, which is a very useless fact that I found out when writing this.
Harry blushes, and then goes even redder when he realises. “Thanks, it was, uh, I don’t really know how I do it. Things like that sort of happen to me sometimes. Hermione said something about strong emotional feelings can set it off, but we don’t really know for sure. It feels kind of strange, so I try not to do it too often.”
Harry has heard some of the whispers about Malfoy, ones that started at the beginning of term but tapered off the first few weeks in, however after the Christmas holidays they had started up again.
Harry is moving before he realises it, at the door before he realises he’s on his feet, someone jeers at him as he leaves the common room but Harry doesn’t care to make out what’s said.
He blinks owlishly at Harry, pupils wide from sleep. “Why are you in the cupboard?” He asks, voice rough.
“Went to get my glasses, only fell off the bed and whacked my head.”
“Don’t be pathetic. If we’re doing this, I’m getting ice cream. Come along, Potter.”
Harry shuffles awkwardly towards it, knowing that he’s being nosy, and then frowns when he sees that it’s just a potion vial holder, filled with empty vials. He picks one up and squints at the label.
Dreamless Sleep was meant to induce drowsiness, and then, as the name suggested, a dreamless sleep where the drinker would rest without being disturbed.
And then there’s a flash of lightning that lights up the sky, and Draco jumps, and ducks his head to rest under Harry’s chin. Which was, in all likely, what he was going to do anyway. The bolt of lightning, surely, had nothing to do with where Draco’s head rests. No matter the strangely titillating images that flit through his mind. Harry must be going mad, he thinks.
“Nope.”
Draco watches it intensely, and Harry senses that this is another one of Draco’s rituals, so he lays down quietly against the cushions and watches.
?” Draco whispers, and to Harry it sounds more like he’s talking to himself, but there’s a note of desperation in it.
There’s a hushed murmur coming from all four tables, and Harry understands why when Hermione slides a copy of the Daily Prophet over to him.
“She’s taken a year out. I think she wanted to get away from it all, after,” Harry’s throat went dry, “Fred. I don’t think she could stand coming back here straight away.”
Harry is only vaguely aware that Draco has stopped talking, and is lightly grasping Harry’s arm. Harry knows he must look like a deer in headlights. But he can’t break himself out of it. He can’t stop staring, if he takes his eyes off Vernon for one second -
(See the end of the chapter for
“Mm.”
One of them ran deep from the tip of his shoulder to the beginnings of his navel, and Harry can’t stop staring at where it slashed through the delicate skin of his areola. Harry can’t tear his gaze away from it, so fixated that he doesn’t realise that his hand has come up to gently caress the marks until Draco inhales sharply at the finger-tip touch, and Harry almost pulls his hand away. However, he looks into Draco’s face and finds him watching him with the same intensity, his wet lips parted and the pupils of his wide-eyes so black they almost swallowed the grey.
Ron, too. Ron had lost his own brother, and it hurt so much that he couldn’t bear to come back to Hogwarts, who floo calls them regularly but can’t bear to set foot on the grounds. Harry couldn’t blame him either.
Harry stares at Draco in shock as he rambles. It’s the most he’s said in weeks, and properly the most he’s said at once all year.
“Why…Did you follow me?” Malfoy asks suddenly.
“I know what you mean - they all look like babies. We were just kids, and I can’t remember being that young either.”
“Are you sure? This book is depressing.”
“What do you mean? Are you sick?”
“Pomfrey!” He shouts. “Pomfrey, help, please!”
“These boys - different houses - it was a stinging hex, they said - he was tied to a chair - they said they gave him Dreamless sleep.” His explanation comes out in a jumbled mess, and Pomfrey gasps sharply when he gets to the part about Dreamless Sleep.
“It’s muggle,” Malfoy says softly, so unlike the bold, cocky tones of their first years. “McGonagall said that it might be good for me to research muggles more, and I like reading. So…” Malfoy gives a heavy shrug.
cold, colder than it had been in the middle of December.
“But I… the things I said, about your family… I was awful. And you know that I am sorry about it.” He says.
“No, I don’t… I don’t really get hungry much.” He says just as Harry finishes his plate. He gulps down his pumpkin juice.
Draco lets out another demented cackle, and then goes eerily silent. Harry can only hear the soft whistle of the wind, and Draco’s steady, yet shallow breathing.
Draco finds him two hours later, still dressed in his work robes and smelling like lavender.
Draco lays down next to him, and keeps a respectable distance. They lay side by side quietly, watching the grey rain clouds slowly drag themselves across the sky at a leisurely pace. Draco clears his throat.
“I took you here - with Pomfrey? I don’t remember what happened after that, but the Healer said I could see you -”
Harry wants desperately to know what’s going on, to find out what he’s missed. Even Hermione has been no more forthcoming, and had somehow managed to turn his last attempt at asking into a lecture on why he should study more.
“My what?” Harry says dumbly.
The other Slytherin’s are further up the table; to Harry it looks as if they don’t even see him there. Harry doesn’t understand how: Draco Malfoy has always been impossible to ignore.
Harry slowly set off in that direction, crouching as low to the ground as he could, wincing when thorns scraped his ankles.
Hogwarts has been such a constant in his life ever since he found out about the Wizarding World that he almost can’t imagine not boarding the train every year. It’s an oddly scary thought, that the last year is flying by as fast as a snitch, and neither of them have long left.
Harry squeezes his hand lightly.
It takes a moment for him to register what he’s seeing, and when he does he forgets his wand entirely and throws a punch that would rival the strength of werewolf at the peak of its transformation.
“She’s your mother. She’d do anything for you. After He - after
He races through the halls, almost knocking Professor Flitwick over.
“Can you read to me?” He yawns to cover up the awkwardness he feels asking the question, sounding like the child he never got to be.
Harry spends breakfast the next morning agonising to himself about what happened in the common room. After their moment had been broken Draco had rushed back up to his room and Harry stayed down there by himself for a little while, but it hadn’t been the same alone, so had gone back up to bed just gone three in the morning.
“Mm. You were.” Harry agrees evenly. “And I know.”
Harry shrugs. He couldn’t quite get the words to form in his throat. It was like someone had snatched his voice from him.
Of all places, it’s bloody
and then catches Draco before he can fall to his knees on the hard stone floor.
“What?”
when Draco shrugs.
“Aye, Harry, want some tea? I’ve got some rock cakes that Fang would ‘appily share with you,”  Hagrid glances at Malfoy, and must see that for once they’re not arguing. “Malfoy could come too, if yer want.” He sends Harry a questioning look that Harry pretends to not notice, and he turns to Malfoy.
Harry curls his hands into fists, and the fluorescent lights above them flicker ominously. Vernon jumps, and his gaze flits between Harry and the lights. He stands frozen to the spot, and Harry can see real fear wash over his face.
As Harry stares into the fire and thinks, he hears a deceptively soft noise. He glances at Malfoy; his face is no longer slack, it’s twisted into a face familiar to the one he had made on the Astronomy Tower. Malfoy murmurs something soft, and the gentle noise is a heavy contrast to the fright that seems to stiffen his entire body even though he’s still sleeping.
Whatever Malfoy’s up to, Harry will find out.
Harry notes the advice, and then frowns. “What do you mean, she won’t give you any? That hardly seems fair. If it’s because -”
“They kept me in a cupboard.” Harry whispers. Draco’s white-blond head shoots up sharply.
It’s the early hours of the morning when he jerks awake with a sharp intake of breath, the image of Vernon Dursley, red-faced and spitting with fury crystallized in the forefront of his mind. The sweat-soaked sheets are choking him, and he stumbles from the bed, almost collapsing to the floor.
What is he doing with Draco? They were friends now - they had to be. He was unused to thinking of his former rival in such a way, however he struggled to reconcile the boy curled up next to him with the cruel boy who had reminded Harry so much of his cousin.
Draco glances down, and then blinks at the plate as if just noticing it in front of him. He frowns at it, the skin between his eyebrows crinkling, his teeth worrying his pink bottom lip.
He stares at the white door, hand hovering over the handle, listening as the cries die down to murmurs, until eventually there’s silence behind the doors.
Malfoy, obviously, doesn’t look up. “It’s a good reading spot, and it’s quiet. Usually.” He says with a pointed tone. Harry doesn’t believe him.
They Apparated in the middle of a muggle supermarket. Surely, someone must have seen it. Harry sits up fast, and his forehead smacks against a broom.
Harry swallows. “You’re my friend, Draco.”
Draco kicks out, and Harry rolls off him and casts a
Because there, at the other end of the aisle, Harry is certain he can see Vernon Dursley. He’s not looking at Harry, hasn’t noticed them. Yet.
Draco moans around a whimper. Harry feels sick, and it has nothing to do with the smell seeping up from his robes. Madam Pomfrey was like an immovable rock, she had seen it all in her service to the Hogwarts students, and seeing her so frantic makes him want to ask desperately, if Draco Malfoy is actually in
The question catches Harry off-guard, and any response gets stuck somewhere between his chest and his throat.
“Okay,” He says, not meaning it, “alright. See you later.”
Harry stares at the ground. This could have been his final resting place. A lonely grave in the cold, dark forest. There doesn’t seem to even be animals here anymore.
“Yep.”
“Why doesn’t your bedroom have a window? At least then you’d have natural light.”
“Draco, are you alright?” He asks gently, feeling awkward as he says it.
Taking too much was lethal.
It’s said so quietly that Harry almost misses it over the sound of the flames. One of Malfoy’s bony hands snakes up to tug at his hair. Harry wonders about that some more.
Harry half-sits, half-collapses into Draco’s desk chair. There’s ink-stained parchments spread across the wood. He doubles over until he can breathe again, and suddenly there’s a glass in front of his face. Harry takes it and gulps it down gratefully. He places it on an unused coaster when he’s done.
“No, I think it might have. I wanted to be caught, I think. I knew you were stalking me, and I didn’t want to be caught, but at the same time I wanted you to find out and stop me. I needed someone to stop me. But no one did.”
, so he hadn’t given him a chance to complain. Harry simply grasped his bony wrist and apparated them outside the shop.
Draco's voice has a natural storytellers lilt, and despite the depressive subject matter of the book, he reads with a calming tone that wouldn’t be out of place reading stories to children, and Harry falls into a blissfully dreamless sleep before the end of the first chapter.
I'm not sure exactly how long this is going to be but I'm thinking around 20k, as I'm writing the last chapter for it now.
“Yeah.”
Draco shrugs. “Dunno. Poppy gave me something. I had lots of expensive plates too. I can probably find a teacup plate to match your teacup so it wouldn’t be out of place, I can’t stand it when things are out of place. I hate the other teachers watching me, and the bratty first years who clearly all think I’m about to fling myself down the stairs or start throwing about Avada Kedavra. Which is funny because I don’t have a wand and was never able to cast one anyway.” He gives a little hysterical laugh.
“Yeah.”
Harry wonders if Malfoy thought like that too, but finds that his Gryffindor courage isn’t enough to make him ask.
But Harry had never told him the details. He had locked them away in his mind and vowed never to speak about it and until now he had done a fairly good job.
He doesn’t speak to Malfoy until three nights later.
Draco is pinned into a chair, hands bound behind him, a sharp line of red running across forehead, blood slowly dripping down his face, some of it running into his eye. He only vaguely recognises the boys, one is Gryffindor, two are Ravenclaw and one is a Slytherin. Draco looks wildly between them, mouth opening and closing soundlessly.
“Watchu reading?” He asks, trying to read the cover upside down and failing.
Done nothing. There was nothing he could have done to prevent Draco from doing it that first time. But even so, the thought that somehow so many other people knew and he didn’t infuriated him.
D. Malfoy
Draco’s quirks a questioning brow at him; Harry got a lot of letters. “From who?”
He goes into Hagrid’s hut and chooses a seat opposite the window. All the time Hagrid talks to him, he’s half-staring out the window, watching as Malfoy gets smaller until he’s doll-house sized. Malfoy stumbles a couple of times, and Harry wonders what happened to all that grace.
“Oh,” Draco says, and wets his lips. For a moment Harry thinks he’s going to say something about Fred, but he doesn’t speak again.
“Does this have to do with that man in the Tescos yesterday?” Draco asks. Harry swallows again around the lump in his throat, and his vision blurs.
Malfoy doesn’t move when Harry steps towards him. He doesn’t know he’s there, Harry realises, doesn’t realise that he’s been found.
