Draco winced at the ear-straining decibel.
“Yes... He was there.”
“I think dinner is about to begin,” Anthony announced. “Come on, guys.”
“Yes, Aunt Andromeda. I’ll get the rest of my lessons finished today," Draco answered with only brief hesitance.
“What is it?”
"Yeah, I just came back from the library and he was standing outside. He couldn't get in." the corners of Draco's mouth twitched.
It was the next morning. Draco had spent the good part of the night thinking how he now thinks of Harry as a friend. He shivered at some parts, thinking back to when they first genuinely met compared to now. From their past of fights, detentions, name calling to Draco crying in his arms and thanking Harry (to actually
Ron cleared his throat. “Er, so this is the Goblet of Fire?” He stared up at it. “You just really just put your name in there and it’ll decide.”
“I’ll say… that there is a monster. Been out for Scabbers since day one. The poor lad,” Ron said lamentably, tugging his rat closer to his chest. Draco eyed Ron's pet with its dropping whiskers and its fat, grey body and seeming to be dead save for the slight movement to show Scabbers was still breathing. Draco wrinkled his nose.
"Er, no offense, but you look... tired." Draco subconsciously pulled his hair from behind his ear.
“Yes.” But Draco thought it felt wrong to ask such help from them.
At once, Draco ventured to look beyond the two to the room. Mismatched couches and throw pillows, a basket filled with yarn, trinkets and picture frames crookedly lining the walls.
Harry frowned. “What? Oh, yes. Yes, it is. It’s a yes.”
“Yeah, it’s been the first match for weeks. Keep up, Malfoy!” Michael smacked Draco’s shoulder.
"O' course I can't," Hagrid said. "Number one, I don' know meslef. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn't tell yeh if I could." Draco opened his mouth to laugh when Harry shoved a hand over his mouth. It got a weird look from Hagrid, but Granger distracted him.
"Dobby, stop." the servant stopped an inch away from the floor, ready to hit himself.
“Want tea while we wait?” Sirius braced a hand on the back of his chair as if ready to stand.
A gentle tap came onto his shoulder.
“Everyone, today we’re going to be doing something a little more... eccentric.” Professor Vector announced, making students straighten in surprise. “Still within calculated reasoning, of course.” Everyone slumped back down. “Today, we’re going to be looking into the compatibility we have with one another. Now, please turn to page 514 and think of a person who you have a close connection with.” Her dark eyes lowered to a particular Hufflepuff student. “I said page 514, Mr Murphy, thank you.” A piece of chalk rose to the board and began writing. “Now this method uses two particular kinds of words, ‘hates’ and…” the chalk finished the other word in a flourish. “‘Loves.’" There was a ripple of giggles and groans.
"You seem to be worried about him," Riddle said, not taking his eyes off Harry. "Almost
“I’m not mad.” Draco’s forehead creased. Specks of snow slipped into his scarf and he vainly tried to rearrange it. “Why would I be mad?”
“Yes…" Draco took a few steps before turning around. "Mrs Weasley, can I ask you something real quick?”
Well, Draco can’t take it back now. “Yes, I’ll help. That’s all I wanted to say. I think I’d better be going--” he was saying before being pulled into a death-gripping hug.
Draco was in front of his father’s study, feeling himself go almost cross-eyed from staring at the double doors. The rule of
Draco wasn’t in the least bit surprised that she found out. She
"It's to keep it fair because what if he slips and tells Fleur something or he tells us something about Fleur. This competition is already skewered. Now come on, we have to do our own research now!" She declared, pulling at Harry and Ron's sleeves and dragging them off towards the library.
Snape narrowed his eyes at the boy before tilting his head up to look through the dusty window showing a blue sky. "Draco, I made a promise to your mother--to
“What was your punishment?”
Narcissa shook her own surprise off and cleared her throat. “It’s been a while, Sister.”
“Don’t laugh!” Ron bristled.
“When will there be enough progress?”
“Get him off of me.” Draco hissed, his calm act dissipated and was ready to respond with his own (
“No, no, before the term started. After I blew up my aunt Marge. It was in the bushes—and now I saw it at the Quidditch match--Trelawney said it meant death—Everyone keeps saying I’m going to die, but then, they always say that--but maybe this year might finally be it—“
“Moody held him back for something,” Ron said.
is Dumbledore!" He exclaimed, looking at a Chocolate Frog card. Weasley was saying he had six of him when everything blurred.
“Don’t count my failure yet. I should probably go and start trying to write this down. Maybe make a chart. Work things out.” Draco stood up and made his way to the castle.
Draco winced as Harry's voice got steadily louder. He's never seen so much anger coming from the boy.
Ron froze under the gaze of Lucius.
“Why haven’t you told him you didn’t like him?”
He also wrote to Harry frequently. About his abrupt displacement of living with his aunt and asking questions about Muggle contraptions that he was too embarrassed to ask his family, and asking Harry about his life with Sirius in order to distract himself from thinking about his parents.
“The Yule Ball.” Harry nodded to himself. “Yeah, that thing.”
Tonks poked her head in. Her hair now red-tinged black, jagged strands framing her face. “Hey, we’re gathering the Order. Wanna come with?"
After a few moments, Hermione pulled out a chair and it shrieked against the floor made the chatter cease. Whatever Hermione was planning to do, the chair was abandoned and she pulled her arm away.
“Draco?” Narcissa knocked on his door. “May I come in?”
He came out during a ride to the shops.
” Terry crooned, pulling them to walk interconnectedly.
Draco heard a click and yelped as the box exploded in colour and noises. There were people wandering around in a bright living room, talking.
“Yeah, speaking of that…” Ron wondered aloud. “Draco, how are you even related to Black?”
A student suddenly shot around the corner, bag trailing notes with books stuffed inside half hazardously. Their eyes were looking in all directions when they found his.
"Mr. Malfoy." A voice called out. Draco didn't have any more patience by the third day and still no sign of Harry so he was going to the Hospital Wing early in the morning.
"Yeah! It looks pretty great, doesn't it?" Michael cradled his chin with his thumb and finger. "And on the first try too!"
Harry pulled away to look into Draco’s eyes. “I don’t think I can ever hate you.”
“I don’t know, there was just a
The conclusion made him feel giddy, his stomach doing flips that had become familiar at this point. The crush he's been nursing on Draco since they'd visited the Mirror of Erised last year has been slowly growing out of control. It took a huge leap of confidence and hope to write the letter in the first place. He had ended up backing out on it and left it in his dormitory... but then Lockhart's dwarfs ransacked for letters and apparently found his.
“It’s nothing important.”
“How can he betray their trust like that? He was my dad’s best friend… he’s my--just, why?” Harry asked.
, he said, “My father… He’s returned to You-Know-Who. He said he’d try to be better and—I live with the benefit of that, Aunt. They said they’d change for the better but they
“I’m getting wrinkles?” Draco asked, almost panicked as he brought up a hand to his face.
The executor scowled and hefted his axe over his shoulder and wandered out of the Hospital Wing, grumbling.
"Harry, you're sounding like me. That's not good."
"Who do you want to ask you to the ball?"
"M-Minister!" Hermione blurted out. "What's to come of Buckbeak?"
“Er, no, I just lost my train of thought for a minute there, sorry.” This is the first time, and maybe the only time, first year Draco apologised that wasn't forced. He felt someone staring at him.
“No! I know that I… like boys. It’s because the boy
This situation has been Draco’s routine for days. And after every dream, his stomach would roll.
He ran his hands through his hair.
"Yeah, but, what about you?"
"No, thanks." The blond quickly stuffed his wand into the seat as the compartment door opened for the fourth time. Hermione Granger walked in.
“Yeah, you still in?”
for a Russian translation! Links are in the summary for this fic!
Harry barked a laugh. “Ron. You’re pushing it.” Draco heard him mutter through his grin.
Terry cringed.
They stood like that for a long moment.
boys?
“So you've heard the news?” Terry asked when Draco when he finally found him at dinner. "Are you okay?"
in Slytherin.
"Of course. Goodnight, Master Draco." with a crack, the blonde let his body fall back onto the bed, not bothering pulling the sheets back over him. When he fell back asleep, it was dreamless.
“So, how are you feeling this morning?” Anthony inquired finally. “Is everything--”
“I’m not.”
one step ahead of us. It took me
Draco was about to lift cloak up to leave when Potter whispered, "It's here—just here—yes!" He grinned as he pushed opened a door.
He rubbed the sleep out of his eyes and tried to remember what he was dreaming about.
"Oh it's wonderful to see you two again—are either of you coming in Gringotts?"
Harry wasn't trying to be mean, but Draco's father, Lucius, made the Dursleys seem like the Weasleys. That's what he learned when he and Ron hid in Hagrid's hut. He would probably never figure out how someone as amazing and nice as Draco could have a father like Lucius Malfoy. That wasn't the only thing he learned, though; he learned from Aragog that Hagrid was innocent. The thought of Moaning Myrtle could've been the victim of the Heir of Slytherin all those years ago never came to mind until recently.
. It would be so easy, and no one would see to claim it was anything but an accident. He just had to—
Draco managed one last look over his shoulder and saw it was the same Beauxbatons boy that winked at him at the welcoming feast.
“It was nice to see all of you," Draco told them all, preparing to make his goodbyes.
"Sorry if I'm bothering you, but everyone else kicked me out."
It was panic.
“Hey,” Anthony greeted slowly. “Welcome back. Have a nice holiday?”
Draco was pacing along the Black Lake shoreline. He kept rubbing his hands together and nibbling at his bottom lip. It feels like he’s been waiting for ages.
Harry, surprisingly, didn’t raise up to the same hackles. “They’re not. They’re students just like us. Aren’t they supposed to our opponents anyway?”
rot your brain. Cross my heart. Boy, I really need to show you the
"Madam Pomfrey said it'll make me feel better," Draco explained.
admit any of that to Draco.
The fated hippogriff.
fine. I was just being stupid.”
“Er… yeah.”
A gentle tap was at the window. Squinting against the backlight of the waning summer, an outline of an owl could be seen. Draco quickly walked over.
Even in his own bedroom, his footsteps whispered an echo when he stepped inside. He kicked off his shoes and jumped onto his bed. He crossed his legs and placed the album on his lap. He ran his fingers over the indented binding of the cover. In faded, peeling gold, Draco could still make out the family motto:
"Don't lie to yourself!" Anthony glared his eyes, not moving his face away from its place in Draco's hair.
against his own. His grip tightened and he could hear more soft noises before he realized they were coming from
“You should probably go talk with Potter and them," Terry told Draco.
“That’s our daughter, Dora. Your cousin,” Ted answered in the middle of dish cleaning. "She's finally finished with Auror training. That's Moody, her mentor or something of the like."
Harry cleared his throat, shaking his head. "Neither did I, but I had nowhere to go after I... ran away."
"Don' go shoutin' about it, what's the matter with yeh?"
“Arithmancy? That’s a subject? Draco, we don’t take that. Even if we did, it’s not till, like, what, third year? Besides, how does 'time travel' deal with Arithmancy?”
"How exactly do they sort us into houses?" Potter asked Draco. The blond ignored the students around him that leaned in as he explained. Having everyone look at him for guidance was not something he was used to.
"You can't mean..."
“What? Didn’t do some snooping around beforehand?” Draco lied.
“Wait,” she looked at Draco accusingly. “Have you
“Happy Christmas, Mother.”
"There's nothing to worry about. Snape might be rude, but he's not evil. He likes people to think he's cold so they can't misbehave."
“You were amazing out there! First match for Ravenclaw too!” Micheal shook Draco's shoulder dangerously.
why I didn't want you to come over.”
"I'm a professor? That's impressive." McGonagall raised an eyebrow at the two boys.
“You a champion then? You should've been on the pitch hours ago.”
“I received a letter from Madam Pomfrey that you were sent to the Hospital Wing to treat an injury made by a rabid hippogriff.”
Draco tucked the towel tightly around himself and left the dock as Fleur shoved herself in front of Harry, thanking him for saving her sister with a kiss on his cheek.
"Not even if I saw it within my own visions," Draco replied.
"You can?” Granger asked.
. This incident didn’t happen before. He wasn’t one for confrontation. It made his skin prickle, made his stomach seize, it was too
“Exactly. The cousin I know would never call himself stupid.” Tonks gave him a once-over. “Even now looking at you I feel something is off. Alright, where’s that classroom again? It’s been ages since I was at school.” She turned away to start walking.
"Right, I didn’t tell you about him. He’s this house-elf that watched over me during the summer. He’d be there all day and blocked all my letters.”
about this. You never could. You need to stop pretending that you do.” There was a bite in Harry’s voice that made Draco suddenly feel like the dark-haired boy was glaring at Malfoy. As if he was seeing the proud Slytherin, Draco Malfoy.
She held out her hand to Draco. “Hallo, I am Fleur Delacour. It is very interestingly how different our schools are.”
”Not at all.” he wrote and as the words disappeared, he dipped his quill in ink for the major writing to follow.
"Pardon?" He squeaked.
"Why? I've been telling him things about the Order, too," Tonks said.
“He can already do magic, I saw it! Show him.“ Potter smiled.
"Just a little bit."
"My thoughts exactly." muttered Draco.
“Yes, have you heard of it?”
Anthony stuck out his tongue at him.
Draco took deep breaths.
"Without you, we probably never figure out who Flamel was!" she gushed. Draco looked at the two behind her for an explanation.
The conversation trailed in and out of different topics and when the witch with the trolley cart came and went, Draco remembered that he wasn't supposed to be sitting there the entire ride.
"It's not like he's going to be anywhere near us," Anthony replied.
Ron and Hermione shared a look.
“Afternoon all,” Hermione said, dropping herself in the last remaining chair. “Nice to see you, Draco.”
Draco felt hot and pulled off the blanket. He could smell smoke on his clothes, phantom heat prickling his skin.
"Save it. It's not that — it's—" He looked at Weasley and Granger looking at him oddly from the table. Hagrid gulping down tea as Harry giving him a pleading look.
“Here we are.” Ted opened a door and there was a click and the room was washed in light.
This was, by far, the most embarrassing thing that has ever happened to him, and all for a note? Standing up, he bent down to pick up the envelope from the floor. It was crumpled by the dwarf's tight grip on it when chasing Draco, but other than that, it looked perfectly normal, seal and all. Draco peeled off the seal and pulled out the note.
He wondered idly. (It was one of the questions he always thought about during History of Magic.)
“Still, what I said came from anger, which is a shit excuse. Saying sorry is the
"Absolutely fantastic," Draco said, clutching at his side.
Harry snorted. “Like what? Oh, wait, I’ve been meaning to ask, what’s that Muggle thing you like so much? Sliding doors? What’s with that?”
"Thanks." His stare met kind, green eyes with his confused grey.
, Draco?” Hermione's voice cleared his head.
“Mind if I join?” Harry asked.
The Gryffindors and Draco started to leave when Harry spoke up. "Wait, Draco, can you stay?"
"I'm fine, really." Harry was pale and had dark circles under his eyes.
“Come, son, let’s get you home,” Lucius said, putting an unsure hand on Draco’s shoulder to lead him away.
“—Right here.”
"No-" Draco was about to say but Weasley interrupted.
“What? Harry’s always been funny. You must’ve not been around him enough to notice.”
When they arrived in front of the Third Task maze, Draco’s feet almost went out from under him at the sight of Cedric Diggory on the ground, but Harry wasn't with him. Fleur and Viktor were looking on, trying to figure out what was happening.
“Well, you could’ve just tied him up,” Ron said.
“No way! She's-- She's Hermione,” Ron said but his face was becoming red as his hair.
“Draco," Snape said.
He didn't pay attention to them and instead listened to Roger Davies, a third year, tell a story how he ended up the girls' bathroom and swore he would never do it again.
“You know book girl?”
Wait, Viktor Krum wouldn’t be sitting at Draco’s house table anymore.
Apologies for the late update and missing my deadline (again), a lot of other unexpected things occurred over the break and occupied my mind since the last update that has taken a large toll on me and is slightly difficult for me to bounce back from. And this means I haven't finished this entire fic. I can only just say sorry and sound like a broken record. Sorry for this weird negativity as well.
"They left this." Ron dropped something on the table. It was a piece of parchment torn up on one side with small, neat letters spelling 'Sorry!' with a frowning face drawn under it.
Ron and Harry moved closer.
was Harry Potter funny?”
“Do you think he’s hiding something?”
The audience quieted when large, hooded Dementors came upon the field. Draco shut his eyes, but the Dementors didn't even come close to where he was.
Harry felt at peace on that train ride. Letting himself talk about things he liked about Draco until they arrived at King's Cross. But now, this is the third time Ron has pointed into the busy crowd in Diagon Alley and questioned "Draco?" causing Harry reach up to his hair to pat it down as he looked around expectedly.
“Oh… good for them. Yeah, you might as well sit with us.” Terry looked over at Draco. “If that’s alright.”
“Draco…?”
Professor Dumbledore appeared with Professor Flitwick at his side. The students parted to let him up near their prefect.
“I’m not avoiding him. We've just been busy."
"Where have you been?" He scratched his hair into a more chaotic mess. "Seems you've been missing around the manor all summer." Draco all but yawned the words. Bat-like ears folded in on themselves.
He kept to the walls, staying in shadows. Double-checking around corners before darting behind each coat of armour.
When the window opened, the a handsome owl flew in, landing on his bed with a letter. Hogwarts. A pleased smile came to him. Carefully, he untied the letter from the owl's foot. When the letter was relieved, the owl flew quickly out of the window. Draco shrugged, tearing at the Hogwarts seal. The usual list was required was inside alone with another slip that fell onto his bed. Hogsmeade. New excitement heightened his mood. He'll love to go back to the candy shop maybe he can show Harry--the rest of his friends. He grabbed the pieces of parchment, glanced at the mirror to see if he looked presentable (he hated how his face was still trying to cling to childhood roundness), then flew through the hallways.
“Of course it is.”
“Come out and see.”
“Young Master Draco? Dobby brought you some tea—EEP!“ Draco grabbed the teacup and hurled it at the wall. Porcelain shattered and a trail of tea dribbled down the wallpaper. A crashing sound of Dobby’s tea tray falling to the floor as the house-elf disappeared from his room out of fear.
Draco wasn’t surprised. Uncle Ted went against everything their family ideals told them: A muggleborn and a lower-class wizard with no prospects of a high position in the Ministry.
“Oh, of course, you haven't yet when you’re sitting like that!” She reproached the blond. “Here, sit up, sit up.” Her hands eased Draco’s shoulders up.
“Bloody hell, what do we do?” Ron looked up towards Snape.
“Oh, yes, of course, Terrence dear,” Mrs Boot waved her hand. “Whatever you say. Alright, I’ll bet you boys are tired from the long journey. Let’s get out of here.”
take them out of Ravenclaw tower. Your trunks should be up there already. I suggest you all get some sleep. Classes start first thing tomorrow morning. Good night,” Penelope said and turned around and started going towards the door. Draco and the rest of the first years followed.
“Draco, that’s ridiculous!” Terry cried. “You can’t just assume based on something like that!”
"But what about--"
“You’re… what?”
“You’ve barely seen me do magic before, Harry,” he deadpanned.
“I thought Master Draco was in Ravenclaw.” He stopped short.
“Aren’t you going to ask me about dating?”
Draco pressed his lips together in thought. He didn’t feel like dumping information on everyone would be the smart decision. Not only did Draco not know specifics like what happens in the Second Task or Third Task, but his friends also didn’t need to be imposed with the terrifying thought that someone would legitimately
Hagrid released him and Buckbeark tittered. He stood and ambled closer to Draco.
Lucius looked like he was slapped.
The blond answered the bronze eagle’s riddle, soundlessly crossing the common room and trudged up to the dorm. Draco pulled off his covers and buried himself under the dark blue sheets, his shoes half-heartedly toed off to drop to the ground. Scabbers squeaked at the thudding noises.
“Well, I don’ s'pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that... let's see... Fluffy from me… then some o’ the teachers did enchantments... Professor Sprout — Professor Flitwick — Professor McGonagall—Professor Quirrell — Dumbledore did something of course. Oh, yeah, Professor Snape."
"Oh, so am I—"
“On it!” Michael shouted, hurrying over to the blond and promptly latching onto Draco’s side, his temple squishing against Draco’s cheek.
"Please, Harry, my boy, none of my books would sell if I said some old warlock save his village from werewolves, the man didn't have the face for stardom. I had to stretch the truth a bit."
"Er, no problem, Hermione."
“I’ve seen it. He’s supposed to have feelings for someone else. Girls. A girl.”
"Yes, Father." This was exactly as he had dreamed. As he had lived.
“No idea considering my talents are wasted here,” Draco said with a hard edge and glaring at Harry.
Draco nodded and went to inspect the books out on special sale. He glanced over the books quickly until one made him glance again.
"Pro—Professor McGonagall?"
(they also have a
"I didn't mean that he had to move. I didn't mean to scare him off like that. Didn't think I
“No. She thought I got the message with this.”
He was… changing things.
“Hermione will have my head if I tell you again.”
Terry had an awful feeling things were about to get much messier.
“No! I mean—what I meant to say—“ Harry took a deep breath. “What I meant to say is…” Draco could practically
Moody wasn’t talking to him but it still felt like everyone’s eyes were on him. There was a savage part of him that wanted to scream in Moody’s face that not only did he survive he
"Oh, hi, uhm," Creevey stammered. “I know you. Sort of. You’re Harry's friend, right?"
"Am I really... the first person you felt that you could trust?" Draco opened his eyes, moving his head away to look at the other boy.
“Well, there’s this one spell that…” Draco was about to continue until his eyes went to the object in Harry’s hand, which he was about to stuff in his bag.
"Draco, you need to talk to me," Potter said. Mirror-Draco was looking at him sadly, pitifully.
magic
Moody released the spider from the curse. “Now, who can give me another?” Neville had his own brand of painful discomfort that would’ve continued if Hermione didn’t interfere. “Then, Miss Granger, can you tell me the last Unforgivable Curse?” Hermione refused. "No? Hm...
“No, I don’t think so.” Draco shook his head. Harry’s eyes became saddened. “Don’t worry, you’ll get another one,” Draco said absentmindedly. “A better one actually…”
“I’m not, sir.”
Draco absolutely cannot. Not without knowing what was going on.
Draco didn’t know what to say and elected to just let himself stand in Harry’s embrace as he processed the sensations around him. He knows this… he spent the entire summer saying the same thing, yet there was a kick response in the presence of Harry.
As they trudged up to Hogwarts, Draco spoke after a moment of silence. “Thank you, Harry. I know it wasn’t easy for you to talk about.”
“Well... I did. That’s why I wrote.”
"She said that I deserved to be punished for trying to spread lies when she’s the one doing so! As if I'm not getting enough of that from the
They all laid down on the hard, unforgiving flagstone as Penelope stalked the rows of students, hushing those who were still talking.
Draco frowned, then his face cleared as he confidently said, “Then I’ll ask Hermione.”

Harry moved closer and Draco’s breath quickened. A fluttering that felt a lot like expectancy made his body shiver.
so… they were always close to one another). He doubted out of all these things he changed drastically, pushing forward a relationship already made to happen wasn’t something severe. He’s going to hate having to leave Viktor Krum without a date. But… Hermione and Ron would be happy together.
"What?" Draco was rubbing his eyes, blinking them awake. "Why did you wake me up?" Dobby seemed to realize his mistake and began to look panicked.
"Also, you know that you wrote Bulgaria backwards, right?"
He didn’t even understand the whole Sirius Black problem anyway. And it was noticeable to Potter who didn’t want that type of help.
"I needed space to clear my head."
“Know what?” Hermione demanded.
“Well, tell him to find me before this evening to know how he's going to spend his detention this evening.”
Until it came for the boggart.
Draco was silent.
“Harry--” Draco trailed off as the boy rushed down the staircase.
“What… What do you think of that?”
“I don’t know. He’s…”
“Alright. What is it?”
“Your father is just concerned about you.”
Even Draco who was specialized in the bizarre occurrences that happened around Harry Potter didn’t understand what was happening.
“Huh,” Draco said.
As long as nothing distracted him, he’d continue to make things better.
“Right, r-right," Hagrid whispered to himself. "Back to the castle with ye!" Hagrid boomed to the other students, following the two boys back to the castle. "Class dismissed!"
“Piss off, Boot.” Michael arranged his mussed hair to swoop over his eyes again. “And give me back my Snitch!” Michael lunged at Terry’s bed who side-stepped and dashed out of the dormitory. Michael hastily chased after him
Hermione elbowed him the best she could with her hands occupied with her pail and hurried to add, “Ron’s just saying that we were wondering if we’d be able to run into you. It’s so great to see you.” She placed her pail on the ground to give Draco a squeezing hug. Ron followed her example.
likes you.”
"Thanks, I'll see what he wants." Pushing up from his chair, he crossed the Common Room, now filling with whispers. He opened the wooden door just enough to see Harry standing there, still in his Quidditch robes. "Harry?" Draco opened the door wider and stepped outside, closing the door so the students straining their ears won't hear. "Why are you here? Do you—" He finally got to look at Harry's face. "You don't look so good. Are you okay?" Draco moved forward, hands aiming for his face, as Harry moved back.
Draco has. It was a spell that he never dared attempted out of shame of knowing that he’d fail.
"Whatever, piss off." Michael flipped his bangs. “The girls will love it. Just wait.”
“I know zat! I just cannot focus.”
The whistle blew and everyone shot up into positions. Draco couldn’t even see Harry’s figure as he sped around the Quidditch field. The crowd roared at the sight of seeing a Firebolt in action, but Draco set his jaw and shot towards the boy.
“What are you doing out, then?” Moody's glass eye swivelled over the top of Draco’s head.
It was a lie. All lies.
"How?"
“That spoils their surprise now wouldn’t it?”
talking about me like they know me."
And when tomorrow night came, Draco was roused from sleep with a gentle shake on his shoulder.
“We used my dad’s flying car and drove ourselves here… We sort of… crashed into the Whomping Willow…”
“Yeah,” Harry replied, letting his hand wipe clean on his robes. “You think you can help me tomorrow?”
Diggory’s eyes widened as he looked down.
Even Snape's dramatic entrance into the Shrieking Shack didn't hold the same gravity.
This must be the interlude of the loomed conversation that’s meant to break the ice between him and his aunt but would feel like pulling out teeth the entire time. It was a formulaic plan, one that’s been done to him by Professor Lupin: Lure him in with a promise of tea and break open into a deep conversation which he can’t escape from because tea time etiquette stops him and the small part of him that actually
"Not at all."
Draco crushed the newspaper up and threw it on the ground. He ran his fingers into his hair, pulling at it slightly. He wanted to scream, he wanted to cry, he wanted to throw something.
“Oh, sure can!” Creevey lead Draco to an uninterested Fat Lady, gave her the password, and crawled inside the portrait hole. “Wait,” he stuck his upper body out. “You just want to come in with me?”
Harry perked up at the sight of him. “Draco!” His smile faded when Draco stifled a yawn. “Oh. Were you asleep?”
"Oh."
It was as if everyone got an issue of the
“I don’t see how it’s your business, Malfoy. As a Slytherin
Draco avoided looking over at the Slytherin team as Ravenclaw marched up to meet them. Fuming heat settled over his head that no doubt came from Felecter’s glare. He still hasn’t forgotten about the incident in Hogsmeade and, if he was anything like Draco, most likely never will. Looking up, Draco was proven right and Fletcher's eyes glittered with fury.
"Er, that's a nice thing to say, but what did I do?" his cheeks felt warm. Harry lifted his head out off of Draco’s shoulder, seeming to realise what he was doing and hurriedly put Draco back down, his face even redder than Draco’s.
"Harry." Draco's voice was beside him, and Harry turned to see Draco sitting
The Gryffindor captain, Oliver Wood, was already there and spitting about how he “booked the field” when he finally arrived.
Draco took a cursory glance up to the sky. A bright full moon overpowering the thin clouds, a midnight background decorated with pinpoint stars.
“Do you?” Draco countered.
Penelope Clearwater shouted that it was lights out and that everyone should get to sleep.
Tonks looked up to the ceiling in thought. “I mean, he’s always scribbling away whenever I visit…”
Draco felt his grip on his wand go taunt. Peter Pettigrew. The Dark Lord’s right hand. Draco despised that man. He was always twitchy during meetings. It would distract Draco since he was also standing beside the Dark Lord’s chair. He was an old friend of James Potter, became their Secret-Keeper, revealed their location to the Dark Lord so that he could kill them and Harry.
the smartest witch he’s probably ever heard of. The question was if he should let her know that Draco knew about Lupin too. He took his chances.
"But I expect this 'powerful wizard' future to happen."
“It’s good.” He looked around the room, seeing the bookshelves filled with artefacts that Lucius said to never touch, the portraits of past Malfoys that never spoke to Draco no matter how much he provoked them, the empty corner where a pine tree could go. “Everything’s good.”
“Hi,” Harry repeated, his hand reaching up to his head before he stopped himself. “Why’re you here?”
"Can you really not figure it out? Blimey, Draco. You're smart, but really not in a social sense."
“You’re telling me…” Harry agreed. “They kind of remind me of you.”
“Thank you, Mr. Weasley, but I think I’m about to go.” Draco felt tired anyway. He peeked around the man. “Where is my father anyway?”
Draco was finishing up analyzing a Divination classmate’s handwriting for Divination when he felt two presences behind him.
“Well, it didn’t happen. Potter told him, leaned in for a kiss, and Draco
Anthony, Terry, Michael, and Draco were in the Ravenclaw Common Room, pretending to do homework, but none were able to concentrate on the jarring tension of Draco’s forced nonchalance on his textbook. Three of the boys were giving silent nods over to Draco, pushing one of them to breach the tension (but they were met with incredulous shakes).
Draco found himself getting pulled into achingly warm green eyes.
“She says I have a good connection to my Inner Eye.”
“Mister Malfoy! ‘M so sorry! I shouldn't have--I shouldn't have--” Hagrid explained as he tied a lunging Buckbeak to a pole.
“I should’ve—I shouldn’t have pushed ye,” Hagrid cried into his large hands. “This is awful.”
"Draco," he felt himself jump as the newcomer placing a hand on his shoulder.
talking
“I didn’ want to leave him out in the snow! He’d be all alone ‘n cold.”
“So," Hermione murmured before she wiped at her mouth. "Are you okay? Did you finally talk with Harry?”
Tom's head tilted in false concern. "What's wrong, my dear time traveller?" He closed the trunk and prowled towards Draco. "Is something troubling you?" With each step forward, Draco took one step back. "You know you can tell me anything, right?"
“Er… time travel deals with the future?”
Draco’s eyes darted to Michael. “No idea. I just know that this isn’t supposed to happen. My visions tell me so.”
Terry fell asleep ten minutes into the ride.
Draco’s eyes skimmed the skyline.
“Oh, that’s…” Harry hurried over and shut his trunk closed, edges of clothing poking out as he shoved it out of Draco’s sight.
"We were right, it is the Sorcerer's Stone. Snape's trying to force Quirrell to help him get it." Harry said.
He moved his sights and watched Anthony be mildly confused as Luna led him in an odd form of the waltz that involved shaking their arms above them but he didn’t look bothered by it.
"For the last time, Snape isn't trying to steal anything."
One pathway was closed off from him but it was fine. He could work with this. If Cedric was now part of the tournament, Harry was probably going to be part of the tournament. Draco came up with nothing to stop Harry from being chosen because he had no concrete suspects. He wasn't friends with Harry the first time and Draco was quickly finding out an outsider's point of view can be extremely limited at best. Draco decided to treat it like the first time. The First and Second Task seemed relatively safe, but it seemed he just needed to figure out what to do about the Third Task. But saying things was easier than actually doing them.
Draco stepped down from the Hogwarts Express, students squeezing themselves around him to get out of the compartments. He attempted to pick apart the mass of faces to find three specific people. A knot settled miserably in his stomach when he wasn’t able to.
Bright lightning lit up the grey sky, loud thunder shook the Quidditch stands, but still, the audience cheered. The game was hard to follow and even Gryffindor called for a timeout. After the break, Draco could see Harry drop himself a few feet. A wave of chills ran down Draco’s spine that wasn't caused by rain.
"Yeah, I had to ask a family to help me get through." Draco had a feeling he knew exactly who it was.
The Boot house was in a Muggle suburb like the Tonks’. There was even the same sense of security and normalcy Draco found at the Tonks'. Mr Boot turned out to be an equally sunny person as Mrs Boot that ruffled Terry's hair (much to the boy's annoyance).
“What?” Harry asked in shock. “No. No, I’m not uncomfortable… I don’t know what to say… really… never really had to explain my life to anyone, everyone already has an idea.”
"Er, no problem." That was the only response he could think of.
“Where’s Michael, then?” Terry asked, seeming to ignore his own idea about sleeping.
"I saw the Grim.”
“Oh,” Michael muttered, sounding disappointed. He attempted another grab at the Snitch before it zipped towards Terry’s bed who swooped it up with ease.
“I’m an only child as well. Don’t worry about it. It’s not that big of a deal,” Draco said, mindlessly twirling his wand in between his fingers.
"I'm fine." He left it at that. He felt someone staring at him that wasn't the student who inquired after him.
Draco froze through the threshold, filling with the dread he’s been trying to ignore.
But this time was so... different. The word different cannot cover it. It was Draco that got the top marks and he would rather have a dying rat then have a thing as a "Hand of Glory."
There was a moment hesitation before he gave Tom a response.
“That doesn’t matter. What matters is
He sat up, body sagging from tilted sleep, scrubbing his eyes to remove the after-images of the dream. He looked around his room, the dull light from his lamp post outside creating tall panels of light. He sighed as he laid back down, now fully awake.
"Yes, Professor."
“Draco, since we now know you’re a Seer,” Michael licked away a stray streak of chocolate off his thumb.
“Oh, great Pythia, you’ve been through so much.” Trelawney warbled with wet eyes. The classroom started to whisper and Draco was seized with panic.
and, get this, there was a message. Written in blood. Can you believe it?” Terry said, a noticeable ting of excitement in his voice.
Draco shrugged and watched as Harry had many failed attempts at reaching the golden egg before his Firebolt came from the sky and save him from another line of fire. The dragon's chain broke like paper and Harry and the creature took off towards the school as it snapped at Harry’s Firebolt.
“How can you not hate me right now? After everything I put you through?”
Anthony frowned. “How do you know he confessed in the courtyard?”
"No, thanks." She just shrugged her shoulders and turned it upside down. And that was all that was said the entire ride. Until ten minutes later--
attack," she said in a soft voice as they approached the infirmary. Harry felt his stomach shift as they stepped into the bright Hospital Wing.
“What are
"Still, it’ll be...” Draco looked down the page, “a month before the ingredients will be ready.”
“I know you didn't mean any of this to happen. It was Tom, but he’s gone now, right?”
Nil shoved Draco hard as they ascended, almost throwing him off balance as he sped off. Draco glared back at the back of Fletcher’s head.
“Congrats, Harry,” Draco said. “That was pretty amazing to watch.”
. This man goes and grabs the—“
“Yeah. Fantastic,” Harry said, clearing his throat. “It’s great to see you, too.”
"You were right," Potter whispered as he saw the Sorting Hat, making him turn away.
“Lovely creatures ain’t they?” Hagrid asked a speechless crowd.
“He's a friend," Draco said. The boy just kept looking straight at the blond, an eyebrow raised in disbelief.
my parents!"
He should run. Flee before he gets caught—
"Buckbeak doesn't deserve that." Hermione sniffled.
“I mean—“ A random arm shot abruptly in Draco’s face to get more lollipops, surprising the blond. “—if nothing happens—“ he stumbled.
"I have to get out of here--" Draco said and left the Quidditch Pitch.
“Hermione? Come on out, we have loads to tell you.” Harry knocked on her stall.
"Why have you been avoiding us?" Harry's question overlapped Granger's.
"Yes, Father."
“Voldemort… Voldemort’s…” Harry started. “I…
Draco ignored him and forced himself closer, his eyes straining against the sharp intensity of the wind. And, for a moment, his fingers brushed the golden surface.
"It's not your fault," Hermione said. "It's not we can do much as students."
“But our
"Draco, enough." Lucius rubbed his closed eyes. "I now have to carry the burden of embarrassment that the Slytherin line of the Malfoys has been broken by my own son." Draco couldn't help the burn in his cheeks. Lucius said it like it was the worst possible thing in the entire world. "And did I see you coming out a compartment after a
“No.” Draco waited for arms to stop reaching over one another before continuing, “I’m not.”
“Have you talked with my mother recently?”
wasn’t a good Malfoy boy. (The matter of different interpretations of him not being a good Malfoy spurred Draco to squish it out faster.)
The house-elf’s frown loomed over Harry as he groaned in pain on the floor. “Did Kreacher interrupt Harry Potter’s dream?”
Draco took a frightened step back. He took a trembling breath, gaping at Harry.
“What’s it mean?” Draco asked. Harry’s throat bobbed, but the boy stayed quiet. “Does it mean something bad?”
Fletcher Nil wandered around the emptied corridors, yawning and stretching his arms over his head. He preferred the corridors when they weren’t packed with students who wouldn't just shut up over the lame Triwizard Tournament. What was even exciting about it anymore?
“Well… it’s an egg," Michael pointed out. "So we know that."
Draco curled into him and sank to the floor, a twisting pain festering in his stomach. His quiet surface of peace was being pounded at.
Draco tore his head away and pressed himself into the wall. His heart throbbed terribly as his head swirled with confusion. Were they talking about…
"You wish you can beat me." Harry said, taken aback at Draco's comment.
The Hogwarts Express shrilled in warning.
"Hey, you can't just talk about his family like—" Potter began, but Draco cut him off, as he didn't need famous Harry Potter defending him.
They finally reached the base of the Whomping Willow, Crookshanks slinked outside to touch the tree knot.
“About that night,” Draco said finally. “I want to talk about that night.”
“Then, you did more than you could—“
"Harry wasn't awake?"
“Draco, don’t fight Madam Pomfrey on this,” Hagrid said calmly, laying a large hand on his shoulder. “Yer already had too many close calls. Yer father deserves to know.”
than just friends.”
Daily Prophet.
The second he entered Flourish and Blotts, the strained-looking manager rushed up to him. "Hogwarts? Yes, yes I already know." He stuffed bandage covered fingers in leather gloves, grabbed a splintering knobby stick and headed towards the cage of books in the window display. The book growled as the manager pushed it into his arms, snapping wildly with its sharp teeth. Draco shakily started pressing his hand against the spine.
“She seems nice,” Draco said.
"Zach, he fought a dragon," Cedric said.
The first thing Anthony said when he walked in the boys’ dormitory was, “What in Merlin's beard is
"Yeah?"
Draco winced at Tonks' extravagant entrance to Moody’s classroom. Moody jumped and scattered a box of empty phials. A few shattered on the floor and the man cursed before looking at Tonks.
It was easy in the heat of the moment for Draco to not let the past define him. To speak the words that the future was relatively fluid and not permanent after you’ve just discovered a long-lost Death Eater in the Shrieking Shack. His mother’s words of even the slightest bit improvement from what you were in the past were better than nothing. When he first came to the conclusion, it was simple, but it was still hard to keep the mentality over time and with the thoughts wanting to come back. Especially when it was brought up in front of an entire classroom.
"I know that. We're already heading to the library?" Draco made to stand. "I'll see you two later."
"Hm?" Harry didn't reply.
“No, no, I didn’t mean it to be bad. Just… sometimes things… don’t need extra complications.”
"That's how it usually goes," Mr Boot said as he poured Draco a glass of orange juice before returning to his seat at the head of the table.
Tonks blew a raspberry. “Come on, lemme have a name!”
“You don’t
Draco and Ron shared a look but Ron shrugged and went around the room to sit next to Harry a few seats down.
“I will.” Lucius pulled Draco back into his embrace. “I’ll make sure that you know that I care. Because I do care. I care
Draco's brow furrowed at that, trying to figure out where on his half-formed timeline of Aunt Andromeda was that event placed.
Hermione pursed her lips and changed targets. “Hagrid, do you think of Professor Lupin as odd?”
Was he really going to let
Andromeda looked vaguely frustrated. “You’ve been going on about Harry’s feelings but what about yours? Your feelings are just as important. What do
“Are you sure? I’m sure we can arrange another--”
“All last year, I could see them in the corner of my eye every time I was walking around. Right down creepy. Thought the gits would jump me or one of the guys.” Draco decided to turn around to see Crabbe and Goyle a few paces away, stopping when they were spotted by Draco.
The blond landed unsteadily on the flagstone. He leaned against the wall as he stumbled down the stairs. His body was raking with chills, feeling unwanted memories surface anew. Draco slumped against a cold stone wall at the foot of the stairs, wrapping his arms around his legs. He could feel Tom Riddle’s hand was on his neck. Riddle was barely squeezing but Draco still felt his body move without him telling it to. He felt his breath become shallow as if a hand was enclosing around his airway. He could see the Dark Lord's piercing red eyes, showing no remorse as he pointed his wand at Draco. The cold sensation of a dark green spell running straight into his chest. The brief sense of darkness before Draco woke up.
"Of course, sir." Dumbledore went to the side of Harry's bed. Harry had his eyes firmly closed, matted dirty black hair feel all over the white pillow. After a moment, there was movement and a hand went to reach out Dumbledore. Green eyes shot open and Harry began to babble about the Stone and Dumbledore kept on soothing him till he stopped. Draco felt he was not part of the moment, awkwardly standing at the foot of the bed.
His breathing was short and uneven, his heart throbbing uncomfortably, his face a humiliated red. He kept running his fingers through his hair, disturbing his previous hard work.
Draco just shook the feeling away and pulled Tom’s diary closer to himself.
"Draco? Draco? Mr. Malfoy?" A warm voice brought him out of his slightly twisted thoughts. Draco looked up to see the professor chewing on a jellybean.
Ron made face and intimated Draco with mocking noises. "Aren't you funny."
“Who are you?
Hagrid crushed Draco into a hug.
his letter.
Draco slowly blinked his eyes open. His eyes found his notes for all his classes strewn all over a common room table. Tom’s diary was open in front of him.
What saved each team to be recognizable was the bright fabric of their Quidditch uniforms. Draco watched as small figures in red and green take formation and kick off into the air. A speck of green shot upwards immediately and stayed stationary. After a moment, the green speck moved to another area and repeated the process. Nil was trying to look for the Golden Snitch.
“I’m here, Father.” The blond cleared his throat and descended the stairs once more. “Is it time to go?”
Hogwarts students were gobsmacked as the Beauxbatons waved, cartwheeled down the Great Hall while some gave a ribbon performance. One particularly gorgeous Beauxbatons boy looked directly at Draco and winked, causing the blond’s face to explode red. Students' eyes widened as the Beauxbatons Headmistress, Madame Maxime, strolled towards Dumbledore and towered over him as he kissed her hand.
“Hm?” Harry stopped messing with hair and looked back, confused. “Why?”
Draco opened the door and saw his aunt smiling gently. "Playing with the lights, were you?"
“I mean, you could be spending time with Potter so…” Terry trailed off.
Cho didn’t hesitate. She trusted Cedric enough that he'd be there for her.

“So it
(See the end of the chapter for
"Thanks, Malfoy, owe you one," Cedric managed a weak smile.
After the initial shock of Harry already out of the Hospital Wing, he too squeezed in the stall, his entire side pushing against Draco’s.
As if planned, it burst into a fireball of flames, disintegrating into ash.
“Heroic?” Anthony suggested. “So ‘Boy Who Lived?’”
“Ron?! Merlin, what are you—“
Tom’s response appeared after a moment.
"Impressive," she said simply before walking away.
“How are you not panicking?! Potter’s in a ring with a
It made Draco feel an uncomfortable combination of inadequacy, embarrassment, and shame. Draco should be the last person that Harry should feel like…
what for Seamus? For You-Know-Who, you tosspot!”
“Harry,” Draco said.
Draco felt a wave of apathy. Why have all these memories if it all changes and rights itself as it pleases?
The four quieted.
“No, I didn’t,” Draco said.
“Luna?! When did you start talking to her?”
“No! Listen to me!”
“We didn’t want you to freak you out!” Michael said.
“I don’t see why not. They look nice together. Who says--Weird Sisters!” Terry grasped Draco’s arm. “Weird Sisters! It’s the Weird Sisters!”
“So... Sirius Black is
"Preposterous! I know Alastor and he'd never--"
Draco had that happen to him. The price paid for trying to go against his family’s legacy. An ugly, terrible legacy. One that can be recalled when thinking of the past. Since the past was unchangeable and still in the minds of many.
"See you later, then," Harry said and Hagrid shuffled off, but Draco kept looking at him till he left the library.
“'Night, Draco." Harry walked a little too quickly down the corridor.
"Why are you excited about that?” Draco asked. Terry tried to defend himself when Michael rolled his eyes and interrupted him.
He only knew how far they went when a head of long blonde hair weaved through the crowd and up the steps.
didn’t want to repeat. Getting scratched by a hippogriff was still a better predicament than having himself become a
“Father,” Draco said with confidence he didn’t have. “I’ve come to apologise for my outburst during--” He wasn’t able to finish as Lucius already came around his desk and wrapped him in a hug.
“Death Eaters, Ron! You know this! My entire family were Death Eaters!” Draco flinched away when Hermione knelt down and tried to place her hand on his shoulder. “You heard what Moody said. They used that curse in order to not be sent to Azkaban… They weren’t good people… They were… terrible people.”
"I'm fine," Draco said shortly.
He really wanted to know about his mother, but he’s had a burning question that
Harry just shrugged. “I don’t know. I don’t know why he’d say that. He’s never done anything to me before. I've never even heard of Sirius Black until this summer.”
. The Head of Houses should go and inform their students of the Express that'll arrive tomorrow to bring them home. Please make sure that there are no loose students still running around. This will be the final year of Hogwarts." McGonagall found Snape in the faces of grim professors. "Severus, are you alright? I'm sure that Mr. Malfoy can't be--"
” He pointed to Draco.
“They’re playing Slytherin?” Draco shouted back.
“What? Am I not good enough for the famous Harry Potter’s time, but the Slytherin traitor is?” Fletcher seethed, his weasel-like features twisting. “I bet his family were so disappointed that he failed their Slytherin legacy. It’s amazing that his father can even let him be in the same room as him.” Draco felt his anger swell to meet the baiting insult. (As did anything that concerned legacy.)
The walls were blank, a lone bed with a basic bed frame, a writing desk, a scuffed bookshelf. Void of any feeling.
“Draco, you’re all right!” Harry felt Draco's soft blonde hair on his cheek, and he pulled the boy closer.
“Oh, right. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Great,” Harry cleared his throat. “Uh, brilliant.”
It's not a problem." Draco tightened his hold on his wand and Potter noticed.
, Harry Potter, me and the diary,
"Draco—wait. I'm sorry—"
“I do actually. Just now,” Draco said triumphantly. “Fleur Delacour.”
"That's it. Who can help me? No one."
The three boys were quiet for a moment, unsure of what to say.
"Somewhere," He tried to see through his blonde hair that came over his eyes as he tried to steer towards the gates.
“Your muggle relatives.” Draco prompted. “The Dursleys, right?”
When everyone was thinking about the question the eagle asked at the top of the stairs ("There is a house. One enters it blind and comes out seeing. What is it?"), he finally turned to her as his friends were thinking.
“Well, that was a fun year,” Ron said.
“I did. Did yours have a lot of exclamation points?”
He opened his mouth, then he closed it. “Thank you.” He only said.
“Sure you do.” Draco retorted.
"Of course, Professor. I don’t hate you, by the way. Thank you.” Draco stood up, gave Dumbledore a brief nod, then left.
“I… ran away.”
Anthony, Terry, and Michael gestured that they’d be waiting outside.
They were on their way to London, the Hogwarts Express speeding through tall hills and deep valleys.
"Like..." Draco tilted his head. "He was properly fed and looked after."
have an experience with a dating ritual, he suddenly remembered. He received that love note last year which was completely new for him. That was a change. Someone liked him, absolutely someone did. Or someone still does. He never did find the one who sent it…
“Just—go without me,” a high-pitched voice answered.
"Oh, hey," Michael said when Draco came alongside him. "I didn't think you were leaving."
was ashamed? Of his
The footsteps stopped.
“How was what?” Draco set his bookbag against his bedpost. He walked up to Scabbers on his sock-made bed, petting the rat awake.
Giant craters were in the place of faces such as Sirius and Andromeda along with others he didn’t expect.
Then, Andromeda found out that Draco’s French was
“Potter would and has. He just confessed out in the courtyard.”
Viktor Krum seemed charmed enough by Padma's dancing, Cedric and Cho only had eyes for each other, Harry looked visibly uncomfortable trying to dance with Parvati. Paravati's dancing held a smooth grace while Harry's was stiff and awkward. Draco winced as Harry’s foot clearly stepped on her toes. He moved his attention away to make sure he didn’t do the same to Fluer’s toes.
Draco rolled his eyes as the two laughed. The knot in his stomach loosened. He looked around them, noticing a missing person. “Where did Michael go?”
“Draco, my love,” Narcissa started, grabbing his hands. “You’re going to be staying here with your Aunt Andromeda and Uncle Ted.”
“Why not? It’s true! He
Terry Boot settled himself at an empty table at the Yule Ball, watching the dance floor as exhaustion sank into him.
“But what’s the point if they don’t appreciate it?” Draco asked. “Or that it ends up blowing up in your face? What if you already know you can't change the past?”
"Okay..." He climbed back on the stairs and back into the Common Room.
“I don’t know. It’s just true. Ever since I first saw it I’ve thought it was beautiful.”
He was still trying to understand later that evening when he found his dormitory ransacked and Riddle's diary gone.
“Agh, I shouldn’t say the wrong thing,” Tonks scratched the back of her head. “Listen, I don’t think I’m the one that you need to hear this from, but I know the one: Mum. I’ll write to her. They’ll pick you up from the train station when term ends, anyways. She’ll talk to you then. Alright?”
Draco didn’t know what else to do but stand up from his seat, silencing the entire classroom.
“I don’t doubt it, sir."
"But what?" He hissed again before deciding he'd best remain quiet.
There wasn't one spot in Diagon Alley that didn't have some sort of discussion of Sirius Black. Lucius announced that he had Ministry business to deal with and had Draco swear that he wouldn't come near Knockturn Alley and stay in Diagon Alley as he was left alone to get his school supplies. Posters of the same screaming picture of Black lined the streets, small children that saw them were pulled away with nervous mothers. Draco was unsure with the situation of Black. He knows that he was considered innocent at some point, but he didn't understand what he meant to Harry. What he was to Harry and why Hogwarts was patrolled by Dementors. It was a topic never discussed after he joined the Death Eaters, it was a topic he didn't care about.
a dance partner,” Harry said.
"Doesn't fix anything," Draco snorted. "But then again," he bit into another square. "nasty-tasting potions won't either. Or maybe so." Draco held out the chocolate. "Want some?"
“Yes.”
He was startled awake when he ran into the wall.
After sneaking around, he reached the closed doors of the Great Hall. As he reached out towards the oversized iron ring door pull, the door opened and Professor Moody eased himself out.
Draco’s brow furrowed in confusion before he saw it. He took Harry’s hand, pulling it to the light of the lantern to see the
"Was that move stupid?" Hermione asked him. "I thought it was alright?"
They turned to see Minister Fudge, Tonks, and other officials hurrying over.
“Yer a’right there, Draco? Yer very quiet,” Hagrid asked.
"Harry?!"
“Oh, don’t say that. The night is still young!" No, it wasn't but Potter didn't need to know. "Seize the moment, Potter!” Terry said ruefully. “It's not too late to do what you want to do. Don’t let this night go to waste. I mean, what do you have to lose?"
a telly?”
The Hogwarts Express shrilled and Draco told Hermione goodbye as he went to sit with his friends.
!" Lockhart moaned as he was forced to walk out of his room.
“I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting," McGonagall advised. Potter started to nervously flatten his hair as he fidgeted.
"I never realised how much you liked Quidditch." Harry blinked.
“Now’s why’s that?!” Hagrid was outraged once more. Draco just shrugged noncommittally.
"Coming," Draco stood. He looked back at everyone. "I'll see you at Hogwarts."
(He didn't really care so he stopped at there.)
Draco surprisedly got letters from Weasley and his Ravenclaw friends which were sort of a new experience but replied to each and every one of them (Even if it took him a good two whole days on Weasley's letters to not sound offensive). He didn't get anything from Harry and Draco couldn't stop himself from being the slightest bit disappointed. Something about the thought Harry writing to him made him feel... odd.
let me go, won't you? It's not like anything can happen while I'm getting candy and having a butterbeer."
dangerous?” Terry added.
“Yes, I don’t remember seeing your father so human as you are." Draco wanted to laugh. Of course, his father would never let anyone see him in such a state.
"What on earth? What's this boy doing on the field, Albus?" Fudge demanded.
“It doesn’t matter,” Potter stood up. “I need to get out of here. I can’t stand being here right now. This night was a mistake.”
everything okay?” He looked over Draco’s frame for injuries.
“I’m serious! Don’t try to aggravate her. It’s not going to end well.”
When the door closed behind him. Draco blew out a long breath. He looked down at the hand that touched Harry’s.
“Draco!" Narcissa cried, wrapping Draco in a hug, her knees landing hard on the floor. "My love, are you alright?” She ran a thumb over Draco’s wetted face.
“I know, I know.”
liked. Still, he didn’t know how such a matter happened.
"No what, Draco?" He immediately snatched his wand from his back pocket and pointed it at the noise.
"Good. Good. Now off to bed with you. Now, Mister Malfoy!"
"Fred, George, enough!" Mrs Weasely snapped. "I, for one, am very proud of you, dear," she walked past Ron and patted his cheek.
“What do you mean?” Draco asked, feeling himself go still.
“Professor Dumbledore will explain.” Flitwick waved a hand. “Come along now.”
Still heavy with sleep, he decided to leave it till the morning and just get back to bed.
“Do you just
Harry's shoulder was comfortable under his head. Draco could smell his clean robes, soft and warm. There's a stiffness from Harry as if he's trying not to move. The last of the chocolate is bitten away, melting in his mouth. I might be developing a sweet tooth, he thought as he crumpled the wrapper.
Draco thought.
Draco froze at the contact. Harry tucked his face into Draco’s throat as he wrapped his arms tightly around him.
Draco had no desire to figure out any of that Flamel nonsense. All he needed was the end results and he already knew them. Quirrell never to be seen again and rumors of Harry Potter going into some trapdoor. Wait, t
“Tonks?” Draco tilted his head.
“What did he mean that they used the Imperius Curse--”
“And?”
“Well. It is. So, uh, I passed out after that. I’m just happy that it all ended up with Sirius being proven innocent.”
“My mother’s lost it, that’s what’s wrong,” Terry said, muffled by his fingers.
"What's gotten into him?" He sighed, pushing some hair behind his ear. Michael was giving him wide eyes, one eyebrow raised.
Harry gaped for a moment before shaking his head. "No, I just," he scratched his chin as he stepped closer to them. "Didn't say bye."
“Don’t be stupid,” Ron only replied.
Moody was attacking Tonks. Tonks was his protegee, he would never hurt her. He shouldn't be using the spells he was to attack her--just like how he shouldn't have--used--used--The Imperius Curse.
“You really want to talk about them?” Harry raised an eyebrow.
Fletcher checked to see if the cashier busy with other customers. Seeing her busy, Nil fished out a piece, unpeeling the sweet and popping it into his mouth. He threw the wrapper down into the ground as walked out of the shop door, unbothered.
“Draco!”
!" Harry ran down the chamber to go to Draco's side and dropped to his knees. "Draco, don't be dead, please--" Harry's voice was wavering. He grabbed his shoulders to pull him over. Draco was marble-white, his face showing no life or movement, but his eyes were closed so that had to mean... "Wake up Draco, you have to wake up!"
“YOU’RE WHAT?!”
"Dear, don't you remember the letter?" Draco whirled his head around to his mother. Narcissa was standing by the door frame.
“Are you ready, love?”
“No time, need to talk to you!”
Anthony poked through the same hole. “Are you sure you’re okay?”
Draco wanted to protest again. His father wouldn’t do something so reckless for the sake of him, he was too careful. He was
“Ron, that’s dishonest! Besides, Harry shouldn’t be going out if it’s true that Sirius Black is after him."
Draco didn’t like the feeling of this.
“Relax, Harry. Surprisingly,” Draco furrowed his brow. “I don’t think I like her like that."
"But they should've given something for you, Draco," Granger said, her voice soft. His gray eyes turned to her. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath. "Look, Draco."
“How? I can’t possibly get a new broom while I’m at school and there’s no way I can pay for a new one. Wood's been wanting to win the cup all year. I can't lose against Nil of all people.” Harry started rambling, a frantic edge to his voice.
“In a kingdom, it was against the law to lie. A man in town declared the law stupid and was later arrested for the crime of saying he never said such a thing when speaking to a castle guard. The next day in trial, the King said, 'You may say one thing. Be warned: If what you say is true, then I'll let you die peacefully, but if it's a lie, you will be burned alive.' The man spoke and the King had no choice but to free him. What did he say?"
“Can I ask you something?” Krum asked.
“Don’t start accusing me,” Draco intoned, his thoughts jumbled together causing his feelings to fluctuate. “I do see things--”
“I didn’t even think that you could do that,” Michael said.
Ron scratched his cheek. “Yeah, mostly.”
where we just came from!” Terry said as Michael closed the dormitory door.
"He is?"
“Of course,” Harry answered immediately.
“You know, this sounds like my cue to leave, I’m going to see if I can sneak in a few minutes of lunch. Bye, Harry.”
“That’s a miserable thing for someone your age to say.”
“Draco, do you…
That gave Draco pause. “She what?”
A nightmare. Another nightmare of walking down dark, empty hallways that stretched forever until his throat was seized by sharp pinpricks of a snake. (God, he hated that snake with every fibre of his being.) Draco had brief moments of light sleep in between his restless tossing and turning, but he still woke up more tired than before. These sort of nights was one of the things Draco didn’t miss.
The Umbridge problem only grew as she started to encroach more authority through the Ministry. Her rule plaques began taking over walls and all the while, Draco was in a constant state of emotional turmoil.
"Draco, we need your help.” A bossy, know-it-all voice was above him.
“Run," Michael said and Draco did so. Barrelling down hallways, he sprinted down the corridors and tripped on someone's spell books that fell to the floor.
knows that.”
Draco didn’t think about who would be the other person in his daydreams about relationships. No one caught his interest so why did it matter? He knew when a girl was beautiful, but he never imagined himself with them, but much was the same with boys. He never
But he walked away instead.
Draco nodded, tension leaking out of his shoulders. "Amazing isn't it? Its speed alone puts every other broom unable to compare." Draco could think beyond the cloud of hate he had for Harry before, he had to admit, when Harry got one he could barely see him move across the field. "I mean, the precision on reaction time and braking. It could get France out of the rut of losing streak and back into the winning bracket like they were eight years ago. Though, the Japanese National team is going to hard to beat as they added a new Keeper that's really good apparently." Harry looked at him strangely. Draco bowed his head, abashed. His hair fell again and he hastily pushed it back, a smile splitting on his face on Harry's suddenly stricken face. "France is my favorite team, I've been following them since I was eight. I like to keep track of what's happening."
