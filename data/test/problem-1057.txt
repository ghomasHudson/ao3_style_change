“Wait, those aren’t weeds.” Longbottom crawled across the circle and looked carefully at the small blooms, before fixing Draco and Potter with a hard stare. “Hermione’s right. This is all about you two.”
The next thing he remembered was being greeted by the so-called welcoming committee—a group of shiny-eyed Hufflepuffs—who’d decided the best way to heal was to pick at old wounds. With great effort, Draco had managed to hold back a derisive snort. Idiots. There was a reason they were sorted into Hufflepuff. The sheer amount of flowery, love-your-fellow-wizard nonsense they sold made him want to vomit. Well, that and the fact that he seemed to have left his lungs at home…
“Harry,” Hermione said, her voice calm and quiet as if she was trying to reassure a skittish horse, “surely you can see this isn’t healthy?”
“That’s actually exactly what I was going to say to you, Potter.”
“Absolutely. It’s key, after all.”
“Now, I hardly think—”
“Nothing that you’d care to hear, most likely. I like her. She’s different. She’s fiery and smart and funny and man, can she play Quidditch!”
“Draco, you can’t. You know you can’t. It isn’t good for you.”
Harry helped him back into the bedroom, pressed him down onto the small sofa and wrapped a large, fluffy blanket around him. Then, Harry quickly shrugged back into his t-shirt and pushed his bare feet into his trainers, before dashing off to the kitchens for ‘
I hope Auror training is not proving too demanding, but I am sure you’re coping well in spite of your constant moaning. I know how stressed you get, but you’ve worked your socks off to get those Outstanding in your N.E.W.T.s and you’ve defeated the worst Dark Wizard in British History, so you’ve earned your place there. I know you’re rolling your eyes and blushing right now, but believe me for once.
“How the hell am I putting you off? You haven’t a fucking clue!”
“Well, we saw you follow Malfoy, and these two follow you, and then the Slytherins following them, and figured you guys might need a bit of perspective before you start brawling in the corridors.”
Harry looked at Treacle, at how much she was clearly suffering, and hardened his resolve. He snatched up the letter and flopped onto his bed, determined if he had to read the thing, he'd at least be comfortable. After a moment’s hesitation, he broke the seal and began to read.
“How do you know what subjects he takes?” asked Hermione, her voice strangely tight.
Harry
“I could hear your breathing. Also, you hadn’t fired a jinx at me right away, so…”
“Too posh for a treat, eh?” mumbled Harry as he examined the letter. He didn’t recognise the handwriting on the front and turned the letter over, sucking in a breath when he saw the Malfoy crest stamped in silver wax glinting up at him. He hesitated, unsure if he should open it or not, but his wards were set to refuse any mail which intended harm, so it couldn’t contain a curse or anything. Besides, the last time he saw Draco was hardly negative, even if it was a little embarrassing. Unable to control his curiosity, he slid his nail under the seal and popped the letter open, pulling a piece of thick creamy parchment from inside.
“So many things that I couldn’t possibly begin to list them,” replied Draco, who gave an abrupt shudder when one of the seahorses accidentally stuck their tail into his ear.
“And?”
“First, I would like to know how long you both have been sexually active,” began Draco gravely, “and if you know how to be safe.” Harry held back his despairing sigh with difficulty — it seemed that his husband was determined to jump right into the breach rather than ease them all into it. He took in Teddy’s red face and James’ wide eyes and wondered if they had been wrong to wait until the morning to talk to them.
“Be serious, Ron—”
The girls had gone to similar lengths to stay cool. Hermione had hitched up the skirt of her robes and was currently lounging on one of the sofas, her bare legs draped over Ron’s lap as she fanned herself feebly with one hand. Pansy had dropped all pretence at propriety and was currently sitting cross-legged next to Luna’s feet in her bra and panties. She seemed unconcerned that at least two of the guys in the room kept leering at her sweat-covered cleavage, her dress robes abandoned in a heap next to her.
*****
“Nothing.” At Hermione’s raised eyebrow, Harry suddenly felt under attack. “I’m serious, ‘Mione! I haven’t done anything to the guy. He asked me to stay out of his way, and I have. It’s been two weeks since Treacle last saw Atlantis, so it can’t be about that.”
Draco let his eyes close and rested his forehead against Harry’s as he tried to catch his breath. Merlin Salazar’s balls! If he’d known it would have been that good, he might have done it sooner.
“Right, right…” agreed Draco distractedly as he scanned his lists for inspiration. “How about powdered asphodel roots? They work in the Wiggenweld Potion, so why not this one?”
“What was—?”
“Draco, you can’t leave these like this.”
He tried to force his eyes to stay open. That was his mother’s voice, but smaller, unsure, emotional. Her voice was never those things, even if she felt like it, and it was all kinds of wrong.
Harry laughed, but Draco only shrugged. "Got it."
“Harry!” The disappointment in Hermione’s voice made Harry feel ten times worse, which he hadn’t thought was possible a mere second before.
"Can we not talk about Ron anymore?" Harry murmured, sliding down Draco's torso and hovering over the place Draco most wanted him to be at the moment.
As for Orion, please don’t report him to Shacklebolt. The last thing I need is to lose the only chance I have to do something decent with my life. I’m really grateful to him for offering me a place to do my potions apprenticeship, when every other door was slammed in my face. He’s just flirty, that’s all. But I’m fine and he hasn’t laid a finger on me (well, not in the past week at least). I’m just a bit edgy at the moment, but you know what I’m like. Pansy says I just need to lose my virginity and be done with it. But according to Pansy, half of the world's problems could be solved with a good shag, so I’m not so sure her opinion counts.
Harry forced himself to take a breath before facing his friend, meeting his tired expression with a defiant glare.
“But no, we can’t possibly have feelings. When you take the Dark fucking Mark you have to exchange your humanity first, of course. Wait, except for Snape.
He was close now, his right foot firmly placed within the doorway of the room. He leaned forwards, ready to place his left foot next to his right, when an icy voice made him jump.
Draco opened his eyes to find Madam Pomfrey, Headmistress McGonagall, and his mother around his bed, each wearing varying degrees of worry upon their faces.
“Have been caught en flagrant delit, yes.”
“If you think for a second that Potter will do anything to help me, then you’re sorely mistaken. He wouldn’t blink if I exploded in front of him.”
“You want me to strip in front of you? Next, you’ll be requesting a lap dance.”
“Do shut up, Draco,” smiled Hermione with faux sweetness.
It needed to come to a head, and as Draco made his way back to his room with long purposeful strides, he was formulating a plan. He would stay awake the whole night and catch whoever was tormenting him in the act. Once he confronted them, he would leave whatever was left of them to the mercy of the Headmistress, who although she was a Gryffindor, was also (and much to Draco’s chagrin) incredibly fair.
“Do you understand what I’ve explained, Draco?”
Draco pushed him away at that, laughing. "Okay, you need to get a grip, and please don't ever use that word again." Merlin, he felt a headache coming on. "There's a very simple explanation for all this."
“Why are you telling me this,” Harry demanded suddenly, feeling utterly baffled at the turn the evening had taken, “and not a healer or someone?”
Draco shifted, his face scrunching up in a way Neville had never seen before. "This one's more comfortable. I, uh, fell into some bushes at my conference, and I have a weird rash all over my legs. The sofa is more comfortable."
"Pans, you're not making a lick of sense." Neville got up off the couch and went to calm her down, obviously worried at her being in such distress. "Was it bad news? Is it your mum?"
“Should we not put our stuff on first?” Theo panted, trying to balance his shoes on top of the clothes in his arms. “I mean, we’re all practically half-naked.”
Draco felt like a deer caught in a Lumos as Hagrid peered down at him with a hard look in his eye. It was only thanks to his Malfoy-breeding that he was able to resist shrinking and fidgeting under that stare, but only just. After what felt like an age, Hagrid seemed to make a decision, grunting in what Draco assumed was assent as he snagged his moleskin coat from the peg and stepped quickly out into the rain beside Draco and thudding the cabin door closed behind him.
It was a song he hadn’t heard in a long time, one his mother used to sing to him when he was younger to help him sleep. It was a simple song, but soothing, like sinking into a warm bath or being wrapped in an old cosy blanket. After a moment, the ducklings began to calm, their cries slowing and quieting. They began to look up at him, seemingly mesmerised by the melody, swaying slightly just as Draco himself swayed, letting his soft soulful voice fill the enclosure.
Harry forced himself to stay still and quiet, waiting for Draco to say something, anything.  Draco stares at him, his eyes unreadable. It’s unsettling, and Harry fights a squirm that wants to slide down his spine.
After getting lost a couple of times, I went mug shopping for you, since I couldn’t face the thought of you smashing all of your fine china because I infuriate you. I even got you a Gryffindork one that I’m sure you’ll love to bits. After buying you half a dozen mugs, I finally made my way to Grimmauld Place and I have to confess that I was a little bit apprehensive after your last letter. I might have prepared to cast a shield charm in case you decided to hex me.
“You wish, Potter.” He sighed deeply and closed his eyes for a moment. He didn’t have to die; not yet anyway. “You know we’re going to make each other utterly miserable?”
I was up all night writing this letter, crying like an idiot, and I didn’t go to the Potions Lab this morning. Orion came to my flat and he tried to touch me again. And I just told him the truth, Harry. I told him that I’m in love with you, that I don’t want his hands on me ever again.
"Nah, he's just being moody. You know he can be with work when a particularly bad case crops up."
“Anything else? Even something small?”
But the noise was more than enough evidence to prove that Harry was indeed returned. Neville ignored him and simply left his arm splayed over his face, wondering if he could catch a catnap before their friends appeared for dinner. The sound of another cupboard slamming disabused him of that notion, unfortunately.
“Fuck, is it a tea moment or a whisky moment?”
I lost track of time, lying in your arms completely naked, whispering I love you against your lips, tracing intricate patterns with my fingertips on your warm skin.
“Harry, were you near Draco when he activated the room? Could the room have read your needs as well?”
“Who never sees what from your point of view?” asked Seamus, taking a quick glug of the bottle of Firewhisky that he’d brought with him.
“What do you think?” whispered Harry, as he leaned in to capture Draco’s mouth with his, sweeping his tongue into Draco’s mouth as he deepened the kiss.
talk to him about it! Goodness knows he won’t listen to me!” With a final glare at Harry, she bent over her notes and began to write furiously.
"Fuck," Neville finally said. "I told them this would all blow up." He started pacing, his heels clicking on the bathroom tiles. "Pansy found out first when she opened a dirty letter Harry sent last week, and then Blaise and Hermione found out when they walked in on you two shagging at work yesterday."
“Right back at you, Malfoy.”
“Wow, Potter, you flatterer. I’m sure to blush any second now.” Draco shook his head, trying to focus on the matter at hand. “This can’t be anything; we need to be reasonable. No one will ever accept it.”
"I'm a pacifist," she said with a grin. "But when the revolution comes, I'll destroy all of you."
the Herbology professor, you know,” Neville reminded them with a friendly shrug before his voice switched into lecture mode. “They’re both quite similar in meanings, actually. The Narcissus represents rebirth, renewal, and future happiness. The Lilies are for love, new beginnings, and commitment. When you look at it like that, it really does seem like the room wants you and Draco to hook up or something.”
“You make me sound like a disease,” observed Draco drily.
“Wait,” breathed Harry, trying to keep hold of his rapidly vanishing self-control. “This... this isn’t right.” He hisses as Draco grazes his bottom lip with his teeth and groans. “Draco, stop.”
"Careful," he advised softly, "you don't want to end up cutting yourself."
“It was
Draco turned to Harry and something softened in his look. He stepped closer and put his arms around Harry's waist. "Six amazing months."
“Outstanding, Draco. Please remember to include a sample of your discovery when you submit your project next week.”
Draco goes from class to class, feeling as if he’s missing something pivotal. Something’s not right. He knows it because it’s been days and no one has bothered him. Not that he wants to be harassed, but he’d gotten so used to it, day and night, that the sudden absence of it is unnerving. Like the calm before the storm. There are times when he thinks someone might start with him, like when he sees Corner or McLaggen and his whole body tenses, but then they get a stiffness about their expression and simply walk away. Draco can’t account for it at all.
"You're lucky you're hot, otherwise I have no idea how I'd put up with you!" quipped Harry, giving Draco a light shove as they left the room.
"Bad day at work?"
, thought Draco bitterly,
“I know enough,” replied Harry mulishly. “You had no choice in the, just as I had no choice. I know you value family above all else, that you’re a loyal friend to those lucky enough to earn the position. You drink tea, but you prefer coffee. You like Quidditch but prefer to watch it rather than play. You like to fly for fun. You and Blaise used to play one on one seeker’s games at the weekends back at Hogwarts, and you were both quite evenly matched. Your favourite colour is blue, even though you pretend it’s green.”
He tugged the bottle back from Ron and took another deep drink before passing it back to Seamus and sighed. By all rights, Malfoy shouldn’t have been allowed in the place. It was insulting to everyone who lost someone in the final battle. If the git had got his way, there wouldn’t have been anyone left alive to come to the bloody reunion in the first place!  The memory of the house tables being piled with the dead—Tonks, Remus, Colin Creevy, Fred—swam before him and he pressed his thumbs into his eyes in an attempt to dispel it.
Harry took a step back, eager to place some distance between himself and the manic girl.
“Sorry, but it’s for your own good.”
There’s actually someone I’m in love with, but it’s a completely hopeless case. He’s way out of my league and he would never consider me in that way, not after what I’ve done. Not with the Mark on my arm. I resigned myself ages ago and I think it’s for the best. Craving what I cannot have will only make me miserable.
“You can use these tonight, and we’ll see about getting more of your stuff over here from the Manor tomorrow, ok?”
Dear Potter,
“You’re saying that Treacle and Atlantis—”
Abruptly, Harry’s voice cut through his musings, forcing him to shift his attention to the proceedings.
“Everyone, attention please. We’ve managed to cover the theory behind driving and what the different parts of the car are. Today, I will sort you all into pairs, and you will be taking a Muggle driving lesson!”
Draco looked tired as he spoke, his usually perfect posture more curled inwards, as if carrying a heavy load. Harry felt the stirrings of sympathy in his stomach, but before he could process the feeling, Neville decided to take control of the situation.
Slowly, Harry steadily worked two and then three fingers inside Draco, scissoring his fingers and making sure he was as open and ready as possible, before abruptly hooking them into his prostate with unerring aim. Draco mewled with pleasure as Harry teased the bundle of nerves, certain he would lose his mind from the sensation.
“We think it’s a life bond,” answered Luna, her large eyes sharp with interest. “It’s interesting how none of us figured it out quicker. The clues all relate back to bonds in some fashion, you see.”
“Right, come on then,” Theo said, perched on the edge of one of the pale couches. “Which one of you idiots thought it would be fun to trap us all in here?”
“Potter, I swear to Merlin and Morgana, if you don’t open this door right now—”
. If only I were still friends with Rita… Anyway, I have fastened a parcel to Baz’s leg with my personal stash of Earl Grey and herbal tea. Please don’t let any other pet take it away from you.
I’m deadly serious, Draco. Plenty of people
“Get the fuck off of me!” snarled Harry, as he grabbed fistfuls of Draco’s t-shirt in an attempt to push him away.
“No, seriously. It said
“What are you on about? Of course, she didn’t! She just told me to stop moping cause I was putting her off her Shepherd’s pie and then threw her drink at me.”
“Why?”
Draco cleared his throat. "My sincerest apologies. I suppose we
“If you insist on acting like a bashful child, I will leave you to decide for yourself what to include.”
Where Draco is cured, the bond is dissolved, and pining is in the air.
“They just appeared at my feet a few minutes ago. They’re sweet, aren’t they?” she asked, looping yet another bloom into her hair.
As he sipped his drink, relishing the burn in his throat as something tangible to cling to, he caught sight of a familiar mess of black hair and sighed. He watched as the crowd seemed to surge towards the entrance to the hall. Potter. Of course, Potter.
“They’re amazing!” Harry smiles fondly at the small birds, still focusing most of his attention on little Pavoa, making Draco’s heart melt into a puddle of Hufflepuff essence.
After several tortuous minutes of pretending to listen to the professor's instructions on how to bow while maintaining eye contact, Harry decided to send Malfoy a little note. Since they’d met in the hallway a couple of days ago, Treacle had seemed a little down. Harry was sure it was because she missed Atlantis, and he hoped Malfoy would be up for letting the pets have some time together at some point.
He hadn’t minded at first, but they’d been in the damned place for a couple of hours now, and the novelty had completely worn off for him. The music thumped a relentless beat as coloured lights lit up the dance floor in random segments. The heat inside the club was so thick he could almost taste it. Sweat and cologne and booze mingled in the air to form a heady smell. Everywhere he looked, there were bodies dancing, drinking, touching. Everyone around him looked to be having a fantastic night, which just made the pain forming behind his eyes all the more prominent. Seriously, was there anything worse than people enjoying themselves while you felt crap? He took a swig of his drink and pondered what would happen if he caused the power to circuit in the club, accidentally, of course. Even great wizards lost control now and then. He could feel himself cheering up at the thought and indulged himself a little more with his fantasy.  However, before he could get too far into it, Ron appeared at his side, his arms wrapped around an incredibly wobbly Hermione who was practically draped over his chest.
“Merlin, Harry, what did you do this time?”
P.S. I’m so sorry you got to see Ernie’s pasty arse. If it makes you feel better, I saw Greg naked a few times back in school and I still have nightmares about it.
“Now you see why I called you here? He’s pregnant with your child, and yet he refuses to do anything about it! He won’t see the family healer or take any of the prenatal potions I procured for him. He goes out most nights drinking and comes home hours, sometimes days later, smelling of alcohol and sex. I fear that if he doesn’t alter his behaviour dramatically, he and the baby will be in danger. I just didn’t know what else to do, Mr Potter.”
“Mate! You’re the one who’s been messing with Malfoy with the duck stuff?”
“Really, Potter,” huffed Draco between moans, “you’re meant to wait your turn. At the very least, you should wait until this one has finished.”
“Nothing in life worth having comes easily, you know that.”
“For once just let it go,” whispered Ron in exasperation. “Like he needs notes to pass Defence, ‘Mione.”
“Mistress Narcissa be in this parlour, Sir.”
it tells me. Alright, I need to soothe them without actually touching them? How in the name of Salazar’s balls do I do that?”
Harry blinked rapidly, as if the words had physically bopped him upon the head.
“It doesn’t matter,” Luna said, idly twisting her hair into an elaborate braid. “The room won’t let us out until it's ready.”
"I think the word is fucking, Granger," said Blaise dryly. "Although, actually, that looked more like eating—"
Harry looked around again, letting his gaze linger on the new tapestries that had replaced the old house banners before returning his attention back to Ron.
“You know what? Nevermind. Just forget it.” The words were barely legible, Harry’s voice horse through his gritted teeth. Draco watched as Harry reached up and yanked several hairs from his head and dropped them onto the workbench. “That’s the hair. What else was it?” His voice was dull and lifeless, all the things Harry wasn’t, and Draco felt as if he couldn't stand it.
“And you would deserve it!” admonished Hermione sternly.
The flat was silent, except for the sound of logs burning in the fireplace. Harry was lying on the sofa, legs crossed at the ankle, his head supported on several fluffy duck feather cushions. Now and again, the sound of a glass clunking on the wooden table top could be heard each time Harry took a sip of his whisky. The lamp on the side table cast dancing shadows across Harry's smiling features as he thumbed his way to the next page of the well-worn copy of The Secret Garden he had borrowed from Hermione. Who knew he would enjoy reading so much? An old book at that. Well, Hermione knew, of course, but she knew everything so it hardly counted.
“No way!”
“Potter—” He feels as if the storm has been taken out of his sails and he has no idea which way to paddle in.
Baz also poked him in the head just before he left to deliver this owl, so I think I have an ally. By the way, Bartholemew is a perfectly respectable name for an owl. I cannot thank you enough for sending him to me and for all his stuff. I have no way to repay you for your kindness at the moment, but rest assured that as soon as I get a proper salary, I will shower you with gifts. And I know you’re blushing right now, because you never think you deserve presents, but shut up. You do, and I know best.
“I think they’ve missed each other,” agreed Harry, trying not to ruin the moment by pointing out the obvious.
“Antidote?” Harry scrunched up his eyebrows as if trying to solve a complicated puzzle. “Wait a minute. You think I’m under a Love Potion or something?” Harry began to grin broadly and reached for Draco’s hands, rubbing his thumbs over the pulse points at Draco’s wrists. “I’m
Harry watched as Kreacher peered at Draco’s unconscious form, his face torn between reverence and concern.
“Soon, but not right away. Suppose we get comfortable and at least try to feel less awkward about it all?”
“Sorry,” and to his credit, the git did sound apologetic. “I was just curious, I guess.”
“The past is exactly that, as it should be. I didn’t come back from the dead and kill Voldemort for the same old shite to show its ugly head again, otherwise, what was the point of it all?” Potter got up from his chair and sat at the foot of the bed near Draco’s feet, careful to not actually touch him.
on your owl?! Baz simply has better taste in men, let’s face it. I bought some owl treats for him, but he still let me cuddle him before I could even offer him one. I wish I could buy my own owl, but I can’t really afford one at the moment. Maybe at the end of my apprenticeship, if I manage to set up my own potions lab. I might settle for befriending Baz in the meantime, then I’ll convince him to leave you and join me instead, and force you to buy a new owl. Mwahaha!
"Right. I mean, Hermione is actually flirting with Harry. It's just sick."
“Harry, are you listening?”
Really, you should have seen Kingsley’s face. For a second, I seriously didn’t know whether he was going to strangle me, fire me, or throw me into the cell with you! However, he just sighed and gave the orders. He seems to know when I’m fucking about and when I mean business.
“Well, it makes the most sense, don’t you think? That way, they can all be together as a family, and neither of us has to give up quality time with our pets.”
I think of you all the time, every minute, if I’m honest. When I’m making tea, I think of you. When I’m getting dressed, I hear your voice in my head telling me to pick something less scruffy. It makes me so bloody happy for about 30 seconds, and then I remember what you did and I’m suddenly furious. Do you know how many mugs I’ve shattered with my magic going all daft with anger? Like seriously, I’m going to need to go mug shopping at this rate!
He went to take another sip of his drink and realised it was empty. He took one look at the volume of people teeming around Potter, all vying to greet him, thank him, suck his fucking cock for Merlin’s sake, and he just knew it.
“It needs to be energy-filled, life-giving, and with the ability to stabilise and regenerate.” Draco knew his constant verbalising must be driving Severus mad, but to the portrait’s credit, he was managing to maintain a supportive aura. “It needs to be blood, then?”
been a bit indiscrete." He pushed Harry away and looked as contrite as he sounded.
“So, why are we all here?” asked Luna as she pulled up the rear of the group, the door still opened behind her. “Are we looking for lost things?”
I know I don’t deserve a second chance from you after what I’ve done, but please just read this one letter.
Carefully, Harry pulled out of Draco and stumbled back a few steps, hindered by his jeans that were still sitting at mid-thigh. He rubbed his eyes as he struggled to control his breathing, determined not to pass out in front of the Slytherin. Draco turned around slowly and faced him, his cheeks and neck rosy with the flush of his climax. By all rights, the man should look ridiculous, his jeans halfway down his legs and his hair stringy with sweat, but he didn’t. Harry could feel his cock stir at the sight, and Harry suddenly couldn’t face Draco leaving before he’d fucked him at least once more. Preferably in his bed this time. He wanted to open him up properly and find out how he tasted.
After I received your owl, I grabbed my wallet, strode out of my flat, got hexed by a couple of people and spat on by a few others (Harry, you seriously underestimate how unpopular I am, darling), but then I got on the Muggle tube. For the very first time! And it was bloody terrifying and so ridiculously confusing, but I managed to get to your place using Muggle transports only.
It had been two days since Draco had ordered Harry out of his room. At each mealtime, Harry personally prepared a tray for Draco and left it outside his door. And each time, Draco had left the tray untouched. If Harry tried to speak to Draco through the door, he received no response. Draco, it seemed, was determined to wait him out in this weird standoff. Each time he saw the tray still full, Harry had to purse his lips against screaming at the idiot for being so pig-headed. He knew Draco needed time to adjust, and he would do his best to make sure he got it.
“I don’t have time for this,” affirmed Draco as he turned to leave, stopped only by Harry’s Seeker-fast grab for his arm.
Irritated and boiling beyond belief, Draco ignored Pansy’s offer and pushed himself off the couch, one of the bottles of Firewhisky still in his grasp, and wandered over to one of the couches behind the privacy partition. No one had moved to this area of the room as yet, since they were all sharing the whisky and occasionally chatting with each other, which suited Draco perfectly.
“I’m not getting you one, and neither will Kreacher if you ask him, so accept it. You can have ginger tea or water. There’s also some buttered toast that should help your stomach settle as well.”
making my choices. Now it’s
“Draco—”
He remembered how often he would moan about being unable to find a second to himself in previous years. And now? Now he was beginning to understand just how claustrophobic being alone could be. Sometimes he found himself talking to them — Blaise, Theo, Vince, and Greg — and even provided the answers they would usually have given in lieu of the real thing. He was certain that if he continued this way, he would end up in the Janus Thickey ward before the year was out. What use were N.E.W.T.s if you were driven demented before you could use them?
Draco was lying on the bed, his arms wrapped around Harry’s pillow when the door opened an hour later. He sat up so fast his head swam momentarily as Harry made his way to sit on the edge of the bed. Merlin, Pansy wasn’t lying when she said Harry wasn’t doing well. The usually bright eyes were dull, his tanned skin looking pale against the dark rings under his eyes.
Harry walked over to Draco and grasped his hand roughly, refusing to look anywhere except at the Headmistress. She raised her wand and tapped their hands, murmuring the counter spell to the bond almost silently. At first there was nothing, and then there was everything. Heat and electricity wrapped around their hands, burning almost impossibly hot. Draco winced and looked up to examine Harry’s face, but there was no change to his expression. The bond must not feel the same for him as it did for Draco.
“Atlantis, if you must know.”
Harry swam back towards him and gripped his hand before swimming off towards the deeper area. Gripping his camera tightly, he quickly propelled himself off in hot pursuit through the darker and cooler water until they were swimming leisurely side by side. As they skirted large boulders, they were able to see the larger fish. As Harry began to hunt for a sighting of the barracudas, Draco snapped away picture after picture, determined to document the underwater world they were intruding upon. The flash of the camera caused several Amberjacks to dart away, as if furious he had dared to interrupt their hunting.
Draco
Ron's voice came next. "Do you need—?
“Look, you seem to think that I need rescuing, but I bloody don’t. You also seem to be under the impression that I and this thing inside me have something to do with you, but we don’t. This is
“I’m not sure if anyone needs reminding, but I am unbonded as yet, and I certainly have no plans to bind myself to Harry.”
Draco looked at Harry, and Neville could feel it now, the tension between them. How had he not noticed? It was almost tangible.
Once they were all presentable again, they began to make their way back down to the reunion, Susan and Justin leading the way importantly. Harry walked beside Draco at the back of the group, their fingers loosely hooked around each other.
“You were a bit, mate,” Weasley muttered, looking slightly sheepish at having disagreed with his friend.
"Nope. Got it. Nothing to worry about!" Draco pulled Neville into the room and slammed the door. Harry came out of the attached bathroom and froze, confused.
“Maybe you could tell the others to lay off him a bit? And stop playing duck pranks on him?”
Draco held Potter’s gaze and waited as patiently as he could. Of all the things he thought Potter would say to him, he never thought it would be anything close to this.
“Fowl?” Neville humorously supplied, seeming to enjoy every second of Draco’s distress.
“More,” Draco pleaded hoarsely, as he lifted and ground himself with more and more vigour, “I need more.”
“Harry,” he corrected with a smile. “So, what do you think?”
Harry, it seemed, had frozen in place as Draco began to lean in until their lips were a hair's breadth away from each other, warm breaths mingling between their mouths. Harry didn’t move as Draco hovered, until at last, Draco tentatively touched his mouth to Harry’s, his lips moving in small, unsure increments as he allowed himself to get used to the gentle sensation. At last, Harry seemed to snap out of his trance, and Draco felt reciprocating pressure against his lips, the warm wetness of Harry’s mouth making him want to lean into the kiss and take it deeper.
“You have to admit it doesn’t look very good, Harry,” agreed Hermione, her hands up in a placating gesture, as if she wanted to soften the blow.
An appreciative murmur fizzled through the group, Neville’s silly suggestion lightening the stagnant atmosphere.
Draco choked on the sip of wine he had been drinking as Hermione jumped up and pulled Blaise and Neville outside for some "fresh air". Ron was looking at him with a raised eyebrow, and Draco found himself smiling jovially at him.
Harry quickly pulled the curtains back and opened the window, thankful for the brisk morning breeze that brushed past his face and into the room, chasing away the slightly sour smell coming from the bed.
Harry locked stares with Draco for a long moment before tipping the entire potion down his throat. Almost instantly, he began coughing and gagging, much to Draco’s bitter amusement.
“You arsehole. You absolute, judgemental, fucking dickhead.” Malfoy’s quiet words were like a curse, their impact forcing Harry back a pace. “You’re seriously going to stand there and tell me that I can’t possibly be here to see Vince? What, like I have no feelings? Or is it that you think Vince doesn’t deserve to be remembered?”
A few enjoyable chapters later, the peace was shattered as the front door slammed shut followed by a loud crash of breaking glass. He carefully marked his place (using a bookmark, of course. Hermione would skin him alive if he dared bend a page back) and put the book onto the table next to his whisky. It would seem that Draco was home, and from the sound of it, he was in a mood to reckon with. Just as he stood up from the sofa, Draco threw open the living room door cursing enough to turn the air blue and carrying a large framed picture with the glass broken.
The mere mention of the cursed fire caused Draco to wince. Didn’t Potter have the slightest trace of tact?
“Protego!” Harry’s yell echoed throughout the room as the force of the spell shoved everyone away from each other. “Back off, both of you! What the actual fuck is this? As far as I’m concerned, you can all fuck right off. Draco isn’t to blame for this situation, and neither am I. No one is! And acting like a horde of pissed off Veelas isn’t helping anyone!”
It was the wrong thing to say, as Draco ran at him, all teeth and nails, scratching and biting and kicking and punching. His hands form tight fists that he thumps furiously against Harry’s chest, and somehow Harry instinctively knew that Draco needed this, had to get it all out somehow, that if he didn’t, he’d end up dying from self-hatred. Draco pounded away at him, blows raining across his chest, shoulders, and even once on the chin, causing him to stagger back a step or two. Still, he stood there and took it, letting Draco cleanse the anger out of his body.
Every few thrusts Harry managed to press against Draco’s prostate, causing his prick to become hard to the point of pain, so Draco was forced to slide a hand between them and stroke himself. The pressure building in his balls was almost unbearable and he found himself unable to stop staring into Harry’s eyes, fascinated by the wonder-filled lust he saw there that surely reflected his own.
“Snape helped save us.” Harry could barely get the words out, his mouth was so dry with disgust at himself. Why couldn’t he just stop? What was it about Malfoy that always overrode his internal voice?
“So, is she as mental in bed as her hair colour would lead us to believe?”
“At first it was, but now...I don’t know. You need help. You seem so angry at everything, and you’re taking it out on yourself. You don’t deserve that.”
“Buttered toast? Well, now I do feel spoiled,” said Draco sardonically. “And what the hell is a Kreacher anyway?”
Harry looked over at Draco, his eyes slowly taking in his lean body, the lean thighs, the taut stomach, all the way up to the brilliantly white teeth that were nibbling at that obscenely plump bottom lip, and knew there was no decision to make. He was doing this.
“Maybe you should save the arguing until you’re a more normal colour. Here, drink this. It’s just ginger tea, but it’s meant to help with nausea.”
When Luna’s sleep routine doesn’t work, I do sometimes try a good old fashioned wank. There’s nothing quite like it to send you to sleep. The only problem is that I end up waking up rock hard, and I have to wank all the bloody time. Seriously, my right hand’s going to start cramping up soon. What about you? Does wanking help much? Do you think of your secret love as you come?
the two of you for good measure."
P.S. Sorry this letter is so long. I think I was feeling a bit lonely and got carried away.
The thought of Malfoy seemed to rouse Harry out of his morose ponderings and he reached into his bag for a self-inking quill and some parchment. What he needed was a list. All the reasons why Malfoy could possibly be wanting ducklings and all the ways those no doubt nefarious plans could be thwarted. He put the nib of the quill to the parchment and began to scribble his thoughts, trying hard not to think how happy Hermione would be if she knew Harry was using his spare time to make lists.
"We'll get to me. First, I want to hear about
Draco felt he was drowning in the moment, the proximity of Harry’s body clouding his mind, making the illogical seem plausible.
“But you came through it,” murmured Harry.
He stood on the tiled floor, unsure what to do next. All he knew was that the room was too small, the air was too thin, and the tears that he’d fought so hard to contain were finally cascading down his shocked face. He shuffled backwards, disoriented, until his back hit the wall next to the sink and slid down, leaving him sprawled on the cold tile, sobbing dejectedly into his hands, the fluorescent light above him beaming down harsh judgement.
Malfoy gestured to a nearby open door, annoyance still apparent on his tired face. Harry strode into the room and took stock, before heading over to a tank almost identical to the one in his room.
thought Harry, as he squared his shoulders and headed towards the toilets.
"You're not seeing anyone at all? Not even for one date or a random shag?" she asked sceptically, feeling annoyed that he hadn't just come out with it and told her already.
"Hello? Yes, this is Draco...Oh? Well, thanks, you have a nice voice too." He glanced around the table, letting his eyes shift guiltily, then turned and lowered his voice slightly. He wanted to appear to be hiding, but to make sure they could hear. "I'm actually out with some friends just now, but why don't you call me back later on and we can talk more, and maybe, you know, sort something out?" He hoped he sounded appropriately suggestive. "Mm-hmm. Great, yes. Bye, for now."
“It was nothing, alright?” Harry practically bellowed, shoving his legs into his trousers. “Like I’d do
“I didn’t mean to—”
It was strange, being back at Hogwarts. Everyone who had survived the war, no matter what side they had been on, had been required to return to Hogwarts to get their N.E.W.T.s, to heal and try to adapt. At least, that’s what their letters had said. Eighth year was an anomaly in many ways — they were now houseless, orphaned from their prior houses, and somewhat adrift together. McGonagall claimed that the school wasn’t designed to house an eighth year, and therefore, as adults, they couldn’t be categorised in the same way as the lower years.
“If you would be so kind as to keep your cavorting to the privacy of your own chambers…” Severus’s tone was sharp and cold and Draco found he was sorry when Harry hastily jerked back from the kiss.
The eighth year breakfast table was a hive of chatter and activity as Draco sullenly stood next to the table, poured himself a cup of coffee, and pocketed a scone for later. The sooner he could get his caffeine fix and leave, the better. After a minute, the fact that he was standing and not sitting began to draw notice.
"Of course, George and I managed to loop the core so it just recharges itself. Not bad, eh?"
“Oh yeah,” Pansy screeched angrily at Harry’s mumbled question, “ask the ginger bint if she’s ok and never mind anyone else!”
“Alright, if you both would join hands, I can cast the counter-spell to disperse the bond.”
The crowd of survivors after the infamous battle had seemed so small at the time. He remembered how they’d huddled together in groups of three and four, sparsely dotted around the Great Hall. Yet somehow, the number seemed to have swelled. Those survivors had brought their spouses and plus-ones, and it seemed to Draco that the entire hall was undulating with the sheer volume of bodies pressed within its walls.
“I swear to Salazar if you don’t sit down and stay the fuck still I’m going to hex you into next week.”
“Oi, what was that?” demanded Potter, having seen Draco take the potion. “I’m not getting  in a car with you if you’re out of your face!”
As he finished speaking, he flicked his wand to cancel the Shield Spell, keeping a close eye as he did so.
“Why’s that now? Oh yeah, we’re Slytherins, so anything that goes wrong must be because of us.” Pansy’s voice was so scathing, Potter actually winced.
Draco barely registered Harry’s parting call, his feet thudding on the stone floor as he ran.
Finally able to move more than a few steps at a time, Harry headed over to where his fellow Gryffindors were laughing together at the side of the hall.
"Charming. Yeah, I'm all set." Harry watched as the last of Draco's gear was fixed and checked and grinned, the excitement of the activity finally starting to settle upon him. Once he was given the all clear, Draco took his hand and they both wadded into the shallow end of the reef until they were at last waist deep in the warm waters.
“They are, aren’t they?”
“Well? Ask your elf for some soup then. I’m not eating if you’re not.”
He stepped under the blistering hot spray, letting the heat pinken his skin. Circe, he was really starting to fall for Harry, something that should herald the end of the world as everyone knew it. A Malfoy voluntarily feeling for a Potter. It was preposterous, ludicrous. And yet, he couldn’t stop thinking about all the small things Harry did for him. How easy it was for the man to care for someone he should by all rights hate. More often than not now, Harry walked him from class to class, even if it wasn’t one they shared, even if it made him late for his own class elsewhere.
Potter’s words about Vince kept looping around his head, the pain in his chest becoming worse each time. He knew he couldn’t win against Harry, not in a fight and not with words.  His past was against him no matter what. All he could really do was put as much distance between him and the git as possible.
“I’ve told you why,” retorted Harry, exasperation dripping from his words. “I’m sorry for what I said earlier. I know it’s not an excuse, but it was all so fast and then everyone was staring at us and I just panicked. News flash—even the chosen one fucks up on occasion.” Harry could hear the exasperation in his voice begin to slide into panic and tried to breathe some calm into himself. “Please?”
Malfoy 1 – Potter 0
“Why?” Draco breathed, unable to look away from Harry.
Harry felt his eyebrows raise at that and looked over at Malfoy, who looked green about the gills and fidgeted with the sleeves of his robes.
Hands carded softly through sweat-heavy hair and caressed damp skin. Once their breathing was back under control, Harry whispered he was sorry about the slight scarring Draco still wore on his chest until Draco kissed away the need for apologies. A little while later, Draco whispered he was sorry for Dumbledore, saying he would never have gone through with it, only stopping his mumbled words as Harry tightened his grip on his waist. It was the first time they held each other, even as they slept.
After a few seconds, Harry realised he’d been standing frozen in place, his jaw hanging open as he practically drooled over Draco Malfoy. Merlin, when had the guy gotten so hot? Gone was the pointy sour teenager he remembered from the trials. Instead, the blond had grown into his looks, his face still angular, but attractively so. His slim body was clad in a silver see-through shirt and a pair of skinny jeans that were so tight they looked painted on. His hair, which used to be soaked in gel and pushed back, was now tied in a loose top knot with an undercut that accentuated his long neck. A neck that just begged to be kissed and sucked and bitten. Harry could feel his cock wake up at that thought and subtly adjusted his jeans as he continued to stare.
The new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor was currently droning on about the importance of always keeping your eyes on your opponent. While everyone else seemed to be hanging on her every word and taking notes, Harry was struggling not to emit the loudest, most obnoxious yawn ever seen in a classroom.
There were too many people, for one. How had this many people even survived their final year at Hogwarts?
“Hey mate, still no change with her,” Ron said, scratching his nose absently as he scribbled notes from one of his textbooks. “One thing did happen though. Malfoy left you that.” Ron waved his hand at Harry’s desk, where a rather ominous letter sat waiting for him.
“Well, there’s only so many times you can listen to Seamus tell us about his sex life.” Potter smiled, and Draco found the corner of his mouth twitching in agreement. “So, why
Harry stepped close to Draco and took his hand. "About six months now. Since we all went to Majorca."
“You had no right to knock up my pet!”
“Thank fuck for that!” Harry beams, his smile lighting up the entire enclosure. Draco feels he could bask in the warmth of that smile for days. Suddenly, Harry reaches out and grasps Draco’s jumper, pulling him forwards and catching Draco’s lips with his own. Draco gasps at the contact and leans into it, desperate for more and scared he might never get it. After a moment, Harry pulls away, leaning his forehead against Draco’s.
“Stop faffing about with the bloody plant, Longbottom! Do you think you’re funny or something?”
I’m free any day next week, but I’ll go for Friday afternoon. Would Your Highness manage to find some time for a mere commoner like me at 6pm? I would love to go out for dinner, but I’m kind of broke at the moment, so a cup of tea might be a more sensible option for the time being. There’s a lovely café just next to my potion lab called
“You gave us quite a scare,” his mother informed him as she stepped over to kiss his forehead. “I should inform the Headmistress that you’re awake. Perhaps Mr Potter has something he would like to discuss with you?”
I think you’ve ruined me for everyone else anyway.
“Really?” demanded Draco mockingly. “You’re telling me that Harry showed up in my room making all sorts of declarations of love and missing me because he felt like it? Is that what you’re saying? Because we both know that’s a load of bullshit. He couldn’t wait to get away from me on Sunday, and nothing’s changed. So, for the last time, give me the fucking antidote.”
Despite his critical words, Harry could see Malfoy was smiling, his high cheekbones sporting a fantastic blush at the turn of the conversation.
"They were just being idiots," Neville said, his voice overly reasonable. "Let's just go back out there and get it all out in the open. No more secrets."
He felt some of the tension leave his shoulders at that — they just needed some attention!  He knelt down next to the frightened cluster and began stroking, petting, and generally trying to play with the little birds. However, to his great and increasing horror, the cries only got louder, shriller, verging upon frantic.
“I’m going to go unpack.”
As Malfoy finally reached him, Harry noticed that his so-called friends had drifted off, leaving him to his fate.
He thought he saw Harry grimace at the question, but he wasn't sure. "Well, uh, you know. What's serious really mean?"
That's why she loved working with Blaise. He never let her take herself too seriously and always made sure she took the time to enjoy things. They chatted as they approached the Auror department, waving at people they knew as they neared the door of Harry and Neville's tiny office.
“Atlantis. Is. Pregnant!” Malfoy practically yelled at him, spit flying from Malfoy's plump, pink lips. “Your floozy of a sea creature has knocked him up, and I want to know just what you plan on doing about it.”
“Then why all the messing about and refusing to eat and not letting me help you at first?” rambled Harry, feeling like he’d missed something obvious.
“Everyone, just— Ginny, are you ok?”
“Pass it over,” Seamus said, holding his hand out for Luna to pass him the rope. He took a moment to examine it before continuing. “Well, it’s clear that this rope means one of two things. Either the room wants us to engage in some light bondage, or it really does want Harry and Mal— erm, I mean Draco, to get together. That, my good people, is a Celtic love knot.”
I know I ran away when the Healers said the bond was stable, but it was because I couldn’t face being so close to you without a chance of having you the way I so desperately wanted.
“What on Earth was that? I’ve taken some disgusting potions in my time, but that one was just plain nasty.”
“Bollocks. You don’t care about me at all!” He glared tiredly at his friends, suddenly furious that they were bothering him. “You just want my help in Potions, or to copy my notes in Transfiguration. You don’t give a shit about anything but yourselves.”
Once again, the image of Malfoy swam into his head, although he was mercifully fully clothed this time. The green light of the Slytherin common room giving the scene an otherworldly tinge as Malfoy sat in one of the larger armchairs, cuddling and stroking the birds in front of the fire. His intelligent eyes crinkling in affection as he cooed sweet nothings to the creatures. The soft, yellow feathers fluffing against the pale skin of his cheek as he snuggled them close, perhaps even pressing pink-tinged lips against their soft down— for the sake of the fucking founders! What the fuck kind of Firewhisky was this? Insanity-generating or something? There was no way Malfoy was canoodling with ducklings to improve his public image. The idea was the most ridiculous he’d ever heard, and he’d been party to some pretty shoddy schemes back in the day in the Gryffindor tower.
"Draco!" Hermione and Pansy both yelled after him.
“Fine,” sighed Harry, secretly delighted that Draco was finally going to eat something.
"Hurry it up, will you? And leave off harassing the staff."
You drool when you sleep on your stomach, did you know that? And how the fuck do you still manage to look adorable with you face resting on a wet pillow??? It’s honestly beyond me. I must be completely and entirely head over heels in love with you…
The silence that followed was thick, treacle-like, and Draco felt sure that something was going to give, break.
“If it were me, I’d just go commando!” guffawed Seamus, finding the whole thing much funnier than it had any right to be.
“Vince? Are you here?”
“Well, not necessarily. They’re formed between unclaimed soulmates. Basically, your chemistry, your magic, your everything, is highly compatible to the tune of perfection. However, you guys didn’t manage to figure it out on your own, so the life bond formed. Of course, there are platonic cases of it, but not very many.”
"Yes, I know, baby." Draco patted Harry's back soothingly. "It's all right."
“Your mother invoked the life debt I owe her—” Draco went to interrupt, furious that she could still meddle after what he had said to her earlier, but Potter held up his hand to stop him and continued on doggedly. “She should never have had to. Someone, no matter who, needed me to save their life, and I acted like a total prat about it. No, I don’t have to like it and neither do you. We just have to do it. And so, to that end, I agree to bond with you as soon as it can be arranged.”
“At least I didn’t cause the instructor to almost pass out!”
“Right, come on, Treacle,” Harry coaxed gently, dipping his hand into the tank and gently prising treacle from her mate. “Come away from Atlantis now, Malfoy’s not in the best mood at the moment, and it’s pretty late.”
Harry stepped even closer to her, leaving only an inch or so was between their bodies, and slid his arms around her waist. Hermione did her best to look interested and fought the rising urge to slap him six ways to Sunday for touching her when she was half-dressed without there being some kind of life-threatening circumstance. She gathered her Gryffindor courage, imagined her triumph when she won this farce, and slid her arms loosely around his neck in retaliation, gratified at the sudden panic that flashed in his eyes.
You can do it, Potter, I believe in you.
“Come on, Harry, let’s just go back to the party. Who cares what he’s doing?”
"Fine," sighed Hermione, feeling like this was way more trouble than she initially thought. "What can I do to kick it up a notch?"
Harry forced himself to stay calm, letting Draco rant as he pleased. He watched as Draco balled his hands into fists and raved aggressively about life and fairness and how he needed a bloody drink now. Harry stood and waited patiently, keeping quiet and still, until finally, nearly fifteen minutes later, Harry saw the fight seep out of Draco, causing his shoulders to sag. The look in his eyes was lost and sad, and Harry suddenly felt like he couldn’t bear to look into them.
He paused for one more moment, the tension in the group ramping up a notch or two before he’d had enough. He shrugged, shook his head, and strode away after Malfoy.
, because what’s the point? It would be a waste of an expensive potion for someone like me.
Draco shifted onto his knees, giving him the height advantage over Harry, causing his swollen and bloodied lip to slip free. He pressed forwards, tilting his head to the side and slotted their lips back together again. Harry parted his lips, taking the kiss deeper, and Draco couldn’t help but slip his tongue into Harry’s mouth, groaning as Harry met it with his own, their mouths sliding wetly together.
“Well yeah, you know what animals are like around him. Like a moth to a flame.” Malfoy pushed his hands through his hair in desperation. “I just don’t know where else to look.”
“Draco? Do you believe in New Year’s resolutions?”
“Yeah, yeah. Message received, loud and clear.” Harry swallowed the last of his drink and held out the glass for Ron to refill, which he did immediately. “Okay, so how do I fix this? I can’t exactly just stroll up to him and reveal all. He’ll murder me!”
"You're telling me," began Draco, smiling wider and wider with each word, "that you've gone and booked us an awesome holiday behind my back and completely out of the blue because I was stressed out?"
“I’m not sure it’s wise to focus only on one aspect of essence, Draco. I would advise including as many as possible, as it would cover all bases and make the potion that much more potent.”
“Draco, really,” admonished Narcissa, clearly unimpressed with the crassness of her son. “Why don’t you sit with us and we can talk this through?”
Harry watched as the boys looked more and more horrified as Draco went on, and fought to keep a straight face as he attempted to reassure them.
“It’s not. I think about you all the time.” Potter grasped his forearms, forcing eye contact. “I had a nightmare the other night, and all I wanted was for you to sing to me like you do to the ducks. What is that song anyway?”
Instead of answering, Draco leaned forwards and brushed his lips against Harry’s, causing Harry to gasp at the contact. Boldened by Harry’s response, Draco pressed more kisses against Harry’s lips and jaw, grinding himself down onto Harry’s lap, causing them both to moan.
“And what, pray tell, would that be?” Pansy’s voice had taken on a dangerous quality and Draco couldn’t help but look at her as she glared down at the oblivious girl.
be interested in dating you. I’m not saying you should shack up with one of the scary Howler senders who want to spank you into submission, but surely there’s more to life than watching it pass you by? I hate how you talk about yourself. You’re not below anyone else and, whoever this guy is you’re in love with, they should be bloody flattered. I know I would be if I were that guy. So stop selling yourself short and just ask the guy out. What’s the worst that could happen?
"He's not backing down, guys!" squeaked Hermione in utter despair. "He's away to get massage oil so I can be all bendy for when we have sex!"
“You know what,” accused Ron. “You were staring at Malfoy, and you’re going to stalk him. Again.”
Harry jumped awake at the sound of his name accompanied by furious thumping on his door. He fumbled briefly with the blankets, becoming more and more tangled as the shouting and banging grew louder and louder.
“I completely understand. It’s not very common and seems to be a trait affiliated with purebloods. I suspect it's a way of ensuring the bloodline is carried on regardless of the sexual orientation of the reigning heir.”
“They look—Treacle and Atlantis, I mean. They look so happy, don’t they? Peaceful. I’ve missed that,” observed Malfoy, his voice taking on a wistful tone.
Well, that’s easy enough...”
tell the time you know!"
I love you, you blithering moron.
“Well, they won’t need protection if they can’t prep properly.” Countered Harry, stubbornly folding his arms across his chest.
Harry's words seemed to cause Draco to deflate, his body sagging as he leaned heavily on the worktop.
Hermione gave an unenthusiastic chuckle in acknowledgement. A moody Ron was never good. "There's nothing for it, then." She raised her wand to cast her strongest Unlocking Charm on the door, the one she knew always worked on Harry's locking spells. The bolt clicked, and she shot Blaise a smirk.
“What do you want now, Potter?”
And see, she did. A whole lot.
“That was then; why are you bothering now?”
“Fine!” Harry practically yelled as he stepped out into the corridor and closed the door behind him. “Calm down for the love of Merlin. Two pets get along and suddenly it’s the end of the bloody world. Which one is it?”
Harry was dreaming.
“Involved?” He parroted, unable to stop himself from sounding like an utter moron.
Harry laughed. "Sorry. Do I just rub these on the rash?"
“Sorry, but I really need to go before I lose my train of thought.” He finished pushing his feet into his shoes and walked over to where Harry was still lounging on the bed. “Could you maybe come by Severus’ rooms in a couple of hours? I’ll have mostly finished by then.”
Harry's voice sounded thankful as his loud footsteps trudged across the room. "Thanks, Nev. I owe you one."
“We don’t know what effect that stuff would have had on the room’s magic or whatever. And it’s locked us in here randomly, so yeah, I think it’s broken.”
“Please, more,” begged Draco, reaching to grab the waistband of Harry’s bottoms.
For a moment, all Draco could do was gape at the creature as it held out its leg with a letter attached, earning himself a reproachful hoot. He looked at the owl carefully as he untied the letter. Not only was it not one he recognised, but, according to the tag around it’s foot,  it was also a standard school-issue owl. Once relieved of its burden, the owl fluffed his tail feathers importantly and swooped off towards the Owlery, leaving Draco holding the mysterious letter. He knew it couldn’t be anything dangerous thanks to McGonagall screening his mail, especially since the first couple of days of term saw him inundated with howlers and cursed letters. It was strange, though. If someone at school wanted to send him a letter, why not just hand it to him?
“Stop…” Draco pushes Harry away, gasping much-needed air into his lungs.
Theo moved towards the door and tried to pull the handle along with Malfoy, applying brute strength to the situation. After a moment, Theo let go and leaned against the door in resignation.
She whirled around on him. "Neville! Thank god you're here. I went to get Harry for lunch and—"
“You haven't— Salazar! You’ve got it bad.”
“You have no idea how much I’ve wanted to bite that lip of yours. You know you nibble it when you’re concentrating?” Harry sounds just as breathless as Draco is, and Draco worries that if one of them doesn’t get a hold of themselves they’ll end up passing out from asphyxiation. But trivial things like consciousness and breathing doesn’t matter when he can have his lips pressed against Harry’s. Draco tugs Harry back towards him with a growl and seals their lips back together, both men grasping at each other more intensely with every passing second.
Draco was pacing back and forth but didn't remove his eyes from where Neville stood by the door.
Just as before, the image of a half-naked Malfoy popped into his head uninvited; the smirk Malfoy was famous for adorning his chiselled features; a platter of duck meat sitting in front of him; his hands slowly tearing off a stripe of meat and dipping it in soy sauce, before lifting it to his mouth; his teeth tugging the meat into his clever mouth. The glint in his eye becoming brighter as he sucked each fingertip into his mouth, each one popping wetly from that puckered cupid’s bow as he cleaned them— No! What in the name of Merlin’s pubes was going on? Malfoy could eat duck however he liked and it didn’t matter to him, and never once had he thought of Malfoy’s mouth as something other than to punch. Besides, this idea was just stupid. If he wanted to eat duck, all he had to do was ask the bloody house-elves. Why bother with all the fuss involved in feeding them and whatnot? Which brought him to his final, and most ridiculous, idea on the list.
“You are…always…there,” agreed Draco, his cheeks colouring with a light flush at his admission. “But this is just plain stupid. You can’t be with me. You’re the Saviour…I’m an ex Death Eater…”
“Don’t start your shit, Malfoy, just come on.”
“You’ve named your seahorse Treacle?”
Draco sat propped up in his hospital bed, his mother fussing with the blankets next to him. Healer Greyson had been unerringly professional and attentive in caring for Draco, and Draco found himself thinking he would miss that when he was finally discharged.
"Guys, give it a rest," Hermione ordered, shucking off her coat as she went. "Besides, everyone knows the Hulk would have totally handled Voldie in two seconds flat."
He ran the back of his hand across his forehead, surprised to find his hand covered in sweat. He looked at his mother — she looked so concerned and faded around the edges, like she was blending in with the background. She was saying something to him, coming towards him, but it was like he was watching a badly recorded memory in a cheap Pensieve. Why didn’t she speak up? He resolved to tell her to enunciate just as soon as the room stopped spinning.
"Except," Hermione said, her mind racing through the possibilities, "they don't know we know."
“They're HER babies too, so you need to fight, Harry. Fight for her right to be with her mate and her babies. Malfoy’s being utterly barbaric about all this. It’s just not right!”
Harry felt tired, too tired to do this any more. After a while, just what was the point in fighting all the time? If it wasn’t over blood status and megalomaniacal mass murderers, then it was over their pets. Harry suddenly wanted to hide in his room and never come back out.
“That would be highly irregular, Draco. The unstable quality of the Amortentia would make any modifications extremely high risk.” The huff Draco blew out was reminiscent of his younger brattish years and the portrait appeared less than willing to deal with a teenage tantrum. “Perhaps you could try going back to basics? I assume you brought your notes?”
“Why bother,” chuckled Draco lightly, “you could always finish the job that what's-his-face started.”
"Yes, please, that would be lovely." Hermione smiled in a very un-Hermione-like fashion. "Something soft, but with a little bit of a rhythm."
“You’re a heartless bitch.” Draco gave her one last scathing look before running out of the great hall, ignoring the sudden eruption of whispers from the other diners. If it was Amortentia and not a bog standard Love Potion, it would take a week to brew the antidote. The only other option would be to check Severus’ rooms for one. Merlin knew the room was full of different tonics and tinctures; surely one of them had to be the antidote.
“Because, for some reason, you’re under my skin.” Harry watched as Draco’s eyes widened at that admission, his perfect white teeth snagging his bottom lip pensively. After a tense moment, Harry leans forwards and strokes the hair out of Draco’s face.
“If you have something to say to me, then, by all means, get on with it. I have a very busy evening of potion-taking and napping to get on with.”
After a few very long minutes, it became clear that Hagrid wasn’t coming back, that the ducklings were in need of care, and that Draco was the only one to provide that care. He found himself wobbling, teetering, and finally keeling over onto his butt. As the sodden grass slowly seeped into his trousers, he could feel the cold breath of impending doom — or it could possibly just be the September wind — upon his neck, sending shivers down his spine and to his cowardly toes. No one was going to bail him out. It was all on him and, quite frankly, the thought that eight little lives depended upon him terrified the very aristocracy out of him.
“I, eh, was thinking about the room as it was at the battle, you know?” Draco gestured vaguely at the room before refolding his arms again. The last thing he wanted was to get into another argument about Vince. He wasn’t so sure he wouldn’t hex Potter into oblivion this time around.
Suddenly, Harry pointed his wand at the wireless and the kitchen was filled with soft crooning before turning back to his husband with a large grin. “Just in case they decide to take a practical approach to learning safe sex.”
“School starts back up next week, unless I end up a squib, of course. I’ll ask Severus if he can help.” His mother pulled back slightly, her face crinkled in confusion. “McGonagall’s letting him take on the Potions Master role again. His portrait must have been driving her crazy.” Draco couldn’t help but share the small smile that crept across his mother’s face at the thought of Severus causing mayhem from his portrait. “Maybe there’s a potion substitute that can be manufactured. If anyone can do it, it would be Severus.”
. Think about it — they don't
“Merlin! Talk about having a death wish,” mused Blaise, obviously torn between amusement and admiration. “Figured we could skip lunch in the Great Hall and head down to the kitchens instead. I need sensible conversation after that horror of a class.”
“I’m sorry, Draco dear...” Pansy looked furious and pale, a dangerous combination if Draco had a mind to notice. “...but I don’t happen to have any Amortentia antidote on me at the moment. I’m afraid you’ll have to look elsewhere to resolve your little problem.”
“I did.” she agreed, placing her teacup back on its saucer and fixing him with a severe expression. “I have something very important to discuss with you, but first, I must ask that you promise me your discretion regardless of what action you decide is necessary.”
“You’ve been spending a decent amount of time with the girl Weasley. Anything you care to tell me?”
“Down there at that bloody party, everyone’s having a great old time, except for the Slytherins. We’re lepers at our own reunion. Oh sure, we all got invitations, but we weren’t really expected to come, were we? Did you ever think why only the four of us showed up? It’s because the rest of them were too bloody scared. We can’t even go into Diagon Alley without suffering some kind of abuse. Millicent? She lives in Muggle London, for Christ sake, because she was so sick of being spat on whenever she needed to step outside her front door. Do you have any idea what that’s like?
Harry huffed at the predictable reply, quickly penning a response and sending it back towards Malfoy. This time, it was only a few seconds before Malfoy sent the note back.
“You were such an arse in Madam Malkin’s and on the train. And I’d heard from Ron and Hagrid that Slytherin had some evil wizards in it, so I thought I’d rather be anywhere else.”
“What would you know about it, Potter?”
I’m so sorry I ran away this morning. I woke up and I panicked, thinking you would hate me for what I’d done, for kissing you and touching you. I should have stayed. I should have told you that I love you.
“Thanks. I didn’t realise I was cold until now.”
Bloody fucking Malfoy. Why the hell was it always him?
"Don't worry, we'll stand right outside the door the whole time. Blaise has a stash of extendable ears," promised Pansy. "Now, go and win!"
The Eighth Years’ breakfast table was directly next to the High Table, and therefore within surveillance distance. If someone wasn’t eating enough, it was noticed. If someone was being aggressive, it was dealt with. Draco felt on show all of the time and did his best to do everything just right in a bid to keep himself invisible.
, that if he stayed where he was, he’d end up on his knees panicking.
“He won’t let Treacle see Atlantis, Ron.”
"Do you even know what the biggest and heaviest book in the library is?" enquired Harry, barely concealing a snort.
"Oh, take off your blouse!" suggested Pansy, much to Hermione's horror. "Just go back in there with your heels and skirt and bra, and I bet he freaks right out!"
“Fuck, just imagine the Daily Prophet headline!
“Harry!” Hermione hissed, her hair beginning to frizz—always a danger sign. “You’re not even trying to pay attention, are you?”
As they walked towards the Great Hall, Harry could feel the thrum of anticipation coursing through his body. Yes, he was going to dance with Draco. He was going to dance with him, and kiss him, and hold him so close that no one would dare say a thing.
“The same reason that you know random crap about me,” answered Harry with a half shrug. “We were always a bit obsessive about each other back in school, weren’t we?”
“Sorry guys,” he offered, not looking sorry in the slightest, “but I’ve done something and I need…”
I’d better put the quill down and kiss you now.
“Yeah? Well, I think you’re underreacting. And Atlantis is
“This isn’t over, Potter.”
"Oh, okay then," Draco said with a smile and blew at his scalding tea. "Was there something particular you watched to catch me up on? Did you finally ask that bloke out from the second floor?"
"Eh, I ah—" offered Harry intelligently. "Not really, 'Mione." He was staring at her hand on his like it was an alien appendage. He quickly drew his own back and tucked it under his arm.
“Really, Potter? What bloody time is it?”
“It’ll disintegrate…” murmured Draco, his eyes wide in realisation. “Okay, scratch that.” He felt like vanishing the whole project, but that would be simply cursing his toe to spite his foot and even he wasn’t that stupid. The list of rejected combinations was easily thrice the size of the potential ones — more than.
“Free.” What he doesn’t add is that the freedom he so craved has somehow left him feeling far more empty and alone than he had ever thought possible.
“Where the fuck have you been?” demanded Harry as he hustled Draco inside the room and clicked the door closed behind them. “It’s an hour after curfew.”
“What the everloving fuck is that meant to be?” asked Ron, as he and Hermione moved forwards to examine the room’s new offering.
Harry spelled his notes into his bag and grabbed hold of Malfoy, both of them breaking into a run as soon as they left the silence of the library.
“Basically, if a wizard saves another wizard’s life, they are held in debt until they can repay it. However, you’ve both saved each other so many times that you’ve become linked into a life bond.”
“Well, he was up to something!”
“No?” asked Draco in a dangerously quiet voice. “What do you mean, no?”
The appearance of a Ministry-standard owl jolted her out of her envious musings. It landed softly in front of her, holding out its leg for her to untie the delivery. She abandoned her coffee and checked the recipient — Mr D Malfoy — and untied the letter, curious as to why the Ministry could be writing to Draco of all people. She knew Draco gave freelance advice at times, and she wondered if perhaps he was consulting on some important issue or another. If that was the case, she would really need to open the letter. The contents could be urgent, after all; it wouldn't do to make such a sensitive piece of work wait.
“Are you saying you think I’m too stupid to know what’s wrong with my pet? He’s got all fat, and he sleeps and eats more than usual. This is just not on.”
“Are you taking the piss?”
“What I want, Potter, is for you to stop gawking like a disturbed codfish and come back to my room with me. Right now.”
"You do seem to have a case of the blues," informed Harry, as he moved to pull Draco into a soothing hug. "You've been really stressed and out of sorts for days now."
You wrote that you forgave me. That it hurt so much when you woke up and you didn’t find me there, that you felt your heart breaking into a million pieces.
“And I didn’t? My mother didn’t?”
“Pick-”
“Mother knows, but no one else. I don’t want anyone else to know.”
Harry had changed into a loose white t-shirt and blue striped pyjama bottoms that looked about a size too big. His glasses were off and his feet were bare, and Draco couldn’t help but think that his toes must be cold. Before he could overthink the gesture, he cast a Warming Charm, noticing Harry’s toes beginning to uncurl as subdued warmth began to spread around the room.
“Of course, Blaise, quickly go and—”
“Leave it, Draco,” mumbled Greg in a deep rumbling voice. “She’s just a stupid bitch, yeah? I’m hungry.”
“Fuck, Harry. I want to believe you.” Draco felt lightheaded at Harry’s words, as if the air in the room had begun to thicken.
“People keep giving him a hard time, mate. You know, names and hexes, The usual. Apparently, McLaggen and Corner got hold of him the other day outside the greenhouses. Dean was telling me about it last night.”
Anyway, abs apart, I am sorry for kissing you, and not just on the mouth. And for making us come in our pants as we rocked against each other like randy teenagers. It was
Luckily, many of the potion components listed Severus already had in his store, and anything else could be collected or ordered easily enough. Severus had even permitted him to borrow several of his precious books — short of forcing him to take an Unbreakable Vow that he would ensure the books came to no harm (would an Unbreakable Vow work on a portrait?) — so he could continue his research from his room.
And that was the issue, wasn’t it? It wasn’t that Harry wanted to eat at the table that had held Colin Creevy’s body or chat with his friends near where Tonks and Remus had lain together, their fingers linked even in death. The thing was, he didn’t want to forget them. Everywhere he looked, he felt like the sacrifices of those he had loved were being erased. The feeling left bitter guilt and shame festering inside his stomach.
“What did he do? Did he know you were there?”
“Bloody hell, what do you think it says?” asked Harry, unsure whether he wanted to risk opening the missive or not.
“Harry, mate!” Seamus’ lilting voice boomed over the din. “Glad you finally made it.”
"Stop! That's enough. I don't need to hear how good she was. Geez, Harry."
"You, Mr Potter, are a Godsend." Harry gently placed a soft kiss on Draco's lips and sent him off to sit on the sofa, before busying himself with getting Draco's favourite wine out of the cupboard. Draco was obviously struggling right now.
“Come on, you’ll feel better once you’ve had some sleep,” promised Harry, once again holding out the pyjamas and toothbrush. Draco simply shook his head and let himself fall onto the bed, not bothering to change out of his clothes or even remove his shoes. Unwilling to argue the fact any further, Harry put the bundle of items onto the dresser and stepped towards the bed. Carefully, he eased off Draco’s shoes and pulled a thick woollen blanket over him.
However, when Harry saw the latest tray, a lunch of salad, treacle tart, and ginger tea, still lying exactly as he’d left it, he’d finally had enough. He stepped over the tray and rapped lightly on the door, pausing only for a moment before pushing the door open and stepping inside. Harry’s eyes watered as they tried to adjust to the dim room. The lamps were off, the fire was out, and even the curtains had been pulled tight shut as if the light was Draco’s enemy. The air in the room was heavy and stale, smelling of sweat and stagnation. Harry wrinkled his nose and strode over to the window, opening the curtains and the window to let in light and air. Able to see a lot better, Harry turned around and hissed in shock at what he saw.
Merlin, he’d really been grasping at straws with this one! Honestly! How much blood could a small duckling hold anyway? Not much, he’d wager. You’d get a goat or something more traditional for that sort of thing. It would likely take hundreds of ducklings to produce the blood offering one decent-sized goat or bull could produce! Not only that, but where would said ritual take place? The git no longer had access to the dungeons and surely people would notice if Malfoy were doing that sort of stuff in the common room. True, there were many empty classrooms still waiting on final repair measures, and there was always the possibility that Malfoy could be using one of them.
"Me? I'm true blue, I am!"
“What the hell do you want, Potter? Bugger off, will you?”
“You know, it’s my first time too.” Draco fixed Harry with a wide-eyed stare, unable to hide his surprise at Harry’s confession. “I know that everyone thinks I’ve had more sex than Seamus and Zabini put together, being the Saviour and all that, but I haven’t. I always wanted something more than a quick fumble and a hangover.”
“I promise, Mother, but only to do what I can. I can’t promise more than that.”
"Not at all." Blaise quickly fastened a pendant around Hermione's neck and then used his hands to sweep her hair back into a high, messy bun. "They started it, and we're only finishing it."
and the
“Potter,” breathed Draco, feeling completely poleaxed by the sudden turn of events, “it wouldn’t work. We hate each other, and if you didn’t kill me, I would certainly kill you. We wouldn’t last a week!”
“Yeah, someone’s only gone and hexed all his pants! If he sits down they let out a huge quack!”
“No, Draco, don’t you dare write this off before you even give it a chance to work. I refuse to allow you to give up! I want you to promise me that you will fight this by any means necessary!”
Draco couldn’t help but smile. Severus really never changed, dead or not. He hung back, waiting until the classroom was empty, before approaching the shrewd portrait.
He waited, searching Harry’s face for any signs of disgust, but Harry merely watched him, his lips quirked in a slight smile. He kept his eyes on Harry’s as he let the shirt drop from his arms to the floor. The air caught in his chest as he watched Harry’s pupils dilate.
“Well, go on then.”
“Mother,” breathed Draco, guilt and remorse eating away at him almost as painfully as the core aching inside his chest. He pulled her to sit on the edge of the bed and wrapped his arms around her, although whether to comfort himself or his mother, he wasn’t sure. “I promised I would do what I could to keep fighting, didn’t I? I meant it. I can’t involve Potter — I just can’t — but I can try and find another way.”
Harry, however, seemed to have no such qualms.
“Draco? What did I do? Whatever it is, I’m sorry.” Typical Potter — typical Harry — thinking everything can be fixed with a vague apology and good intentions. Draco shook his head, unable to formulate words to let Harry know that he was quite fine where he was, thank you very much, and that he should continue on with his life as if Draco had never collapsed in the Great Hall. Something of his meaning must have shone through, because the concerned look he had been aiming towards Draco so far had taken on a more anxious quality as he reached out to lay a gentle touch on Draco’s arm.
’ I mean, what the hell am I meant to do with that? Is it some kind of riddle?”
After a day or two, he begins to nurture feelings towards Potter that he had never before allowed himself to think about. He realises Potter has become Harry. He doesn’t know what to do with that and so he heads down to visit the ducklings.
“Then, perhaps you could consider semen? It’s highly potent and gives the added element of potential sexual magic.”
Hermione’s gasp felt like a shout in the otherwise silent room. Harry turned from the disappointment on her face towards Ron and was rather unsettled to see he also looked uncomfortable at Harry’s behaviour.
“I’m sorry, you know,” whispered Harry finally. “About Vince.”
That long. Merlin.
Blaise grunted. "Weird. Are you sure he's there?"
“What the—” Harry looked from Seamus’ alcohol-flushed face to Dean’s slightly sheepish one in fury. “What the ever-loving fuck are you two doing here?”
I’m not calling you Malfoy anymore, so please can you just drop the Potter and call me Harry? Seriously, despite what you may think, it won’t kill you.
The door shook violently as Pansy and Blaise pounded upon it from the corridor. He hadn’t seen them for days, instead opting to lock himself in his room. Everywhere he looked was a memory of Harry, as much a comfort as it was torture. He’d stopped going down for meals, instead picking a mouthful or two of whatever the house-elves brought him — on McGonagall’s request, no doubt. He barely slept too, dreaming of Harry moving over his body, the glint in his emerald eyes, only to wake up barely an hour later. His eyes were constantly red and puffy, and he wondered if it would have been better to die of the core sickness than this slow decay.
“Really?” said Draco sceptically. “You want us to believe that the room gave us flowers because Potter stalked me around Hogwarts?”
“I’ve got it narrowed down to two potential bases, I think. It’s a complex and subtle potion, and I think water was just too neutral. There’s ethanol, which considering its use in Pepper-Up, could be useful in terms of its energy bolstering properties. The other option would be sal ammoniac.”
He grabbed some pyjamas and fled to the bathroom, shutting the door with perhaps slightly more force than was necessary. He turned on the water and began to strip, grumpily tugging his clothes off with less care than he would usually show his belongings. He didn’t want Harry to be with him just because he had to. He wanted him to choose it.
He’d thought of this one when he realised he’d missed dinner and had asked Kreacher to bring him something to snack on. It turned out people really could be influenced by their stomachs. Hermione would be pleased with the conclusion, it was the one thing she was always going on at Ron about. Maybe Malfoy was the same and was really just duck-oriented in his tastes. Harry had to confess he’d more than once overindulged in duck spring rolls over the summer with Ron and Hermione — maybe Malfoy was the same?
Harry hummed, a smile crossing his face. He leaned in and gave Draco a gentle kiss that began to turn more heated the longer they stood there.
“Yeah. I know.” Harry couldn’t look his friends in the eye. “I hid in the room under my cloak so I could watch it and it was just— I fucked up.”
“You’re fussing! Fixing the bed and the water!”
It was invitation enough for Draco, and he brushed his lips ever so gently across Harry’s, testing the waters.
This time, Malfoy didn’t send the note back, and Harry was left twitching about in his seat in frustration, which earned him a nudge in the ribs from Ron and more than a few disapproving looks from Hermione. Finally, the lesson ended, and Harry saw Malfoy leave the classroom, the note still on the desk where he had sat.
“Stay the night.”
The eighth years had been housed in a previously unused section of the castle near the Owlery. McGonagall had allocated two students per room, and Draco had found himself rooming with Neville Longbottom of all people! There were sixteen returning students in total, all mulling around the common room and sitting chatting on each other’s beds. But Draco was bloody lonely. No one spoke to him — unless they had to, or wanted to throw a hex at him. No Slytherin’s had returned other than himself, all opting to earn their N.E.W.T.s at home instead. Everyone else looked at him like the Death Eater Wannabe Scum he was and he honestly couldn’t blame them.
Draco nodded mutely and began to add the hair, blood, and single tear to the potion, stirring well before decanting a portion of it into a small bottle. He closed his eyes and breathed for a moment, trying to tramp down the overwhelming feeling that he was making a mistake, and drank the entire potion in two swallows.
You can find us both on Tumblr:
“Are you quite finished, or do you have a supporting speech to go with that? No? Well, I’ll be on my way.” Malfoy snatched his arm away from Harry’s grip and began to walk away, shoulders drooping tiredly.
“Good luck. I doubt Pansy will let you near him, though.”
“Good choice. Trust me, you don’t want to be here when Hermione finds out Ron hasn’t even opened his trunk.”
“You had no right to bring him here, Mother.” Draco’s voice shook with repressed fury, his pale face flushing with emotion.

“Unfortunately, any attempt to dissolve the bond would result in your core reverting back to its previous state. The deterioration would be rather swift, taking you to the stage of progression your sickness had reached prior to the bonding ceremony. As much as this is a possible course of action, it is one which you would be binding yourself to for life.” Healer Greyson looked pityingly at Draco for a moment before proceeding with his spiel.
"Please," she scoffed, "you know fine and well that I never ask anyone out. If they want me, they'll have to do the chasing."
“Yes,” breaths Harry, his face flushed and his pupils lust-blown. “We could talk… or something.”
he thought,
The welts were deeper than he first thought, some of which had begun to clot and others which were still bleeding freely.
Harry wasn’t there. The fluffy blanket that Harry had wrapped so carefully around his shoulders was still there, lying on the arm of the sofa. The bed was mussed from their earlier tousle, but otherwise unused. Harry’s shoes and wand were gone, and on the bedside table was a hastily scrawled message on a torn piece of parchment informing him that Harry had needed some fresh air and wouldn’t be long.
“I don’t like banshees,” Seamus mumbled, still holding tightly onto his bottle, “and I don’t want any more ghosts around here either.”
“Give who?”
“I brought you some food, in case you're hungry,” said Harry redundantly, gesturing awkwardly at the tray. “I didn’t know what you were in the mood for, so I tried to keep it light and hot.”
“I swear Pansy, if you don’t get your fucking nose out of my business, I’ll hex you into next week. I wish you all would just stay the fuck out of my life.”
“There aren’t any new ghosts, Seamus,” soothed Hermione. “It was likely just the wind or something.”
It was a good twenty minutes later when Draco finally emerged from the bathroom holding his folded clothes with his wand balanced on top. He’d spent two minutes of that time getting changed and cleaning his teeth, and the rest of the time focused on giving himself a mental pep talk. It was just as well, really, because every ounce of cool he’d ever thought he possessed seemed to elude him the second his eyes fell on Harry nervously twisting the hem of his top as he perched on the edge of the bed. Definitely time well spent, in his opinion.
“Draco—”
“I don’t need fucking ginger tea, Potter. Just get me a damned hangover potion.”
“See? Even the Slytherins agree Sixth Year was an issue.” Ron’s voice was loud with suspected victory.
Harry had also noticed the touch thing. Draco never let anyone touch him except for the Healer during checkups, and even then, he only tolerates the touches which are absolutely necessary. When Narcissa visits, he refuses her hugs and touches, keeping himself at a firm distance from everyone around him.
"Hermione danced?" asked Draco in obvious delight. No doubt he would be asking Harry to show him the memory in his Pensieve later.
"Have you done something new with your hair, 'Mione? You look really good tonight." Harry reached up and tucked a curl behind her ear.
“I promise, Draco, that I will never ever regret you.”
“I know, okay! It was funny at first, you know, just messing with him. It was just a laugh. But I think I took it too far. Tonight I— and he—”
“What now?” Harry asked, weary of the whole thing.
“What do you mean by ‘everything’? Mother, what have you done?”
“Powdered asphodel roots in the same mixture as powdered willow bark, Draco? Are you a simple first year?”
“No! I swear it wasn’t. I felt bad at first, but you— I noticed—”
“Why not?” The look on Draco’s face must have been a perfect mirror of the confusion and surprise currently swirling around inside of him, but Harry ploughed on in his argument. “No, seriously. Let’s just say we both wanted to see where this went. Why couldn’t we? What would it have to do with everyone else?”
Most people nodded at him as he mulled his way through the attendees, and a few brave guests stepped forwards to exchange a few words and shake his hand. He’d stuck to one-word replies and the briefest of physical contact,
Once every centimetre of the compass had been touched, Harry slid his hand across the tattoo decorating the left of Draco’s chest. The five-pointed star was bold, taking up several inches of skin. The bottom of the star was the darkest, the outline at least an inch thick. Harry moved his finger, slowing down as he reached the thinnest part of the outline at the topmost point, and paused. Half of the last point was missing, sections of the outline drawn broken, the shards forming the word
“The eh? The eh what, Potter?” demanded Draco furiously.
“Why don’t you say that right to my face and not from behind Malfoy?”
“I’ll just leave it,” he announced to Harry’s obvious surprise and delight. “Knitting machine vomit is all the rage these days, didn’t you know?” He gave Harry a final wave and headed out the door.
Draco’s eyes widened for a moment as he tried to process his surprise at Harry’s probing question.
“Shit.”
"Not at all," Hermione denied with a smile, seeming to quickly recover. "I was just hoping you could give me a sensual massage first." She ran her hand over her chest. "I'm so tense, and I want to make sure I'm all limbered up for you. I'm very bendy, you know."
"Fine, but this doesn't mean you can shag all around our apartment just because I know, got it?"
Any time he’d crossed paths with Potter since the war—which were thankfully few and far between—were downright painful. They would see each other, their eyes locking for mere seconds that would stretch out over an eternity, and suddenly it was like they’d been dropped into their own private Pensieve as the world continued to turn round about them. Potter rejecting his handshake, Draco charming
The heat from Harry’s touch was suddenly too much, the brands Harry left across his skin a new kind of torture. He pulled his mouth away from Harry’s neck, desperate for air, but found himself gasping around Harry’s tongue instead. He was no longer pulling and scratching at Harry’s back, but was shoving and scrambling at his chest, unable to stand the proximity a second longer.
“The water was old—”
"Ah, but in his mind, there's a difference between his being friends with a Malfoy and his best friend being in love with Draco Malfoy — especially when he didn't even know his best friend liked men."
Harry watched a light flush wash over Draco’s face, delighting in how it deepend as his words sunk in.
Harry barely registered Draco’s surprise as he sheathed himself fully inside Draco’s arse, the tight warmth gripping him as the muscles fought to expel the intrusion. He held still for a moment, trying to let Draco catch his breath, and then began to snap his hips back and forth, grinding on each in stroke to catch Draco’s prostate, causing the other man to groan and push his arse back against each new thrust.
"I have to admit," he finally said, taking a sip of his tea and relaxing, "it's nice to finally be able to talk to someone about this. You wouldn't believe what they've been up to."
However, rather than look sheepish, Seamus produced a bottle of Firewhisky with all the exaggerated aplomb of a Muggle magician. Immediately, Harry reached out for the bottle and took a much-needed sip.
“Not another word, Mother! I don’t want him involved. I swear, if you tell him, I’ll never forgive you.”
"Really? You're not having people fall all over you? But you're so handsome and strong." Hermione's voice had dropped to a worryingly husky tone, and Harry jumped when her newly-idled hand slid from the tabletop to rest somewhere in the vicinity of what Draco assumed was Harry's knee. "At least,
I love you so much it hurts.

He read the missive twice before summoning a quill and fresh parchment to pen a quick reply. It had been months since he’d seen Draco, so it couldn’t be about him, and he hadn’t heard of any outstanding charges or legal issues to do with the Malfoy’s at work. However, it couldn’t be anything nefarious since it would be idiotic for them to plot against
“Indicate this,” mumbled Draco, as he hit the little stick thing at the side of the wheel to make the light blink and then wrenched the wheel to the right to turn.
“Uncle Sev— I mean, Professor, could you give us a minute?”
Anger surged through Harry’s body as Malfoy’s words echoed through his mind. Vince? He really expected people to believe that Vince, out of everyone who had died, would be hanging around Hogwarts?
“I didn’t know!” Harry felt scalded inside his veins. Malfoy had been getting the shit bullied out of him so far, and he’d made it worse, thinking it was some great big joke. He felt ready to vomit.
’ for the next month at least, in order to ensure his depleted magic had fully replenished. After that, apparently, they could reduce it to once per week.
“I’ll make you a deal. You get off this floor and into something warm, and I’ll tell you why. Agreed?”
“I do.” Draco watched doubtfully as Harry put his mug down on the side table and gave him his full attention. “Yes, this sucks, but so does much of life. No, we don’t have a choice on actually doing it—” Draco made to interrupt with the fact that they actually did have a choice, but Harry held up his hand, brooking no interruptions. “Make no mistake, Draco, we
The boys, realising that Draco was serious, began to mumble about how last night had been their first foray into sex.
“Because I asked it to,” replied Harry simply.
After a moment, they broke apart and leaned their foreheads together, breathing heavily.
“Let me guess, your father will hear about it? Come off it, Malfoy. Why don’t you put some clothes on and keep your stupid duck toy out of my face.” With that, Neville turned on his heel and left the room, leaving Draco feeling foolish and wrong-footed and with a fist-full of fluffy yellow duck.
After about an hour, he checked his tank and saw he was more than a quarter way through his supply. A quick check of Harry's tank revealed a similar volume, and they both stepped up their pace. Draco was shivery with cold and euphoria. He could only imagine how many pictures he had actually taken, many with him or Harry posing goofily in front of crabs and coral and boulders and fish and every other thing you could possibly find in a reef. He hadn't, however, seen any barracuda yet, and that simply would not do. He could picture just how smug Harry would be if he won and something deep within him couldn't allow that. Keeping that thought in mind, he began to comb the rocks and caverns for a sighting. There was no way he was going to lose their bet!
Because we both deserve a second chance.
It turned out Seamus wasn’t there, but Harry hadn’t let that stop him from achieving drunken heights. The more he drank, the more he added ideas to his list, each one becoming more and more outrageous than the last, his handwriting beginning to resemble doctor scrawl. He sloshed another generous amount of Firewhisky into his glass and peered at the list, thinking it would be so much easier to read if only the letters would stop squiggling around.
Of course, I remember our bonding night kiss. It was pretty hot if I do say so myself. You were really nice about me biting your lip, too, even though you could have taken the mickey right out of me for it.
“Trust me.”
“I’m fine; stop worrying.” Draco found himself suddenly sitting on the bed, Harry behind him, his strong hands working the knots out of his aching neck and shoulders. “I just lost track of time.”
“What the actual fuck—” demanded Weasley angrily, pulling Blaise away from his sister before turning his fury on Draco. “What did you do to her?”
"Remember, twenty quid on who can spot the most barracuda!" demanded Harry, before lunging below the surface and propelling himself towards the rocks and coral.
“Condom or protection spell, Malfoy”, Harry rasped, his cock aching the longer he waited poised behind the other man.
Harry had always thought it was impossible to Floo while kissing, so of course, Draco would be the one to prove him wrong. They tumbled out of the Floo, arms wrapped around each other as they kissed and licked and grabbed, growing more frantic by the second. With what felt like a tremendous force of will, he managed to pull himself out of Draco’s arms and put a few steps of distance between them.
.” Harry’s attempt to mimic the Sorting Hat was so far off, Draco couldn’t help but snort a laugh.
“You can’t really believe that.” Draco couldn’t keep the defeatist tone from his voice. It felt as if he’d done nothing but think and talk about it ever since his diagnosis.
And like a fool, he had listened. At home, there were no jeers or taunts. No glares or hexes. Worse than that, though, was the complete feeling of isolation.
“Is that so?” Draco winces at the icy tone of his own voice. To think he was feeling quite positive only a few moments before.
“Infections, Harry!” demanded Draco, gesturing emphatically. “Protection is important!”
Harry whipped his head around at Draco’s words to see Draco leaning against the door jamb. He looked dressed for a night out, with impossibly tight black leather trousers and a grey silk shirt with the top few buttons open to reveal an expanse of pale, hairless chest. His arms were crossed over his chest, which only served to highlight the slight roundness of Draco’s stomach. However, what really drew Harry’s eyes was the searing fury glinting in the usually cold grey eyes as he faced his mother.
“Let’s just give it one more try, start slow and see where we end up. If we wait much longer, I’ll need to take you to the hospital wing.” Draco closed his eyes for a moment. He really didn’t want to go back to that depressing little bed and have Madam Pomfrey poke and prod at him again. Bracing himself with a deep breath, he opened his eyes and forced himself to hold Harry’s gaze.
“Baby seahorses will be cute.”
The spreading of the core sickness was advancing at a much faster pace than Draco’s progress in finding a cure. It had been two months, and so far each combination he had tried had resulted in failure. Severus was beginning to worry, which Draco could tell from the ever-increasing silences from the portrait.
Usually, the know-it-all’s assumption that she was the only capable person in the room would make him want to scream, but he just didn’t have the energy anymore. In all honesty, if she managed to get him out of the room and away from Potter, he’d buy her a lifetime supply of self-inking quills.
“You what?” Harry heard himself squeak. He held his hands up in front of him lest Malfoy suddenly lunge at him in a fit of uncontainable passion. “Look, I’m not sure what wrong end of the stick you’ve got—”
doing it — but we do have a choice on
For a moment, no one moved. Then, as if prompted by an unspoken command, they all launched themselves towards the door, scrambling to grab their abandoned clothes and wands as they went.
Harry nodded and turned to leave, his stomach dropping at the abrupt turn of atmosphere.
“Yes, more,” assured Draco softly, a small smile tugging the corner of his pink lips. “Every day, more than that even, you tell me how important I am. You’ve honestly shown me so much more respect than anyone ever has my entire life. And I began to think that maybe, just maybe, you wanted me for
“Draco, please, can’t you—”
Hermione leaned onto Ron’s shoulder and closed her eyes, but her lips stuck out into a pout. “I still can’t believe that the apology didn’t work.”
“I’m not a baby, Ron!” demanded Ginny tearfully. “I can take care of myself!”
“You’ve been in my head since day one, burrowing under my skin.”
“A life bond? I’ve never even heard of it.” Harry felt confused and he knew it was showing on his face. “I thought the only bonding was when you got married to someone?”
“Oh, come on, it’s not like you’ve never heard the word ‘fuck’ before. Shall we just get on with it?”
who’s up to something.”
“You’re the one sticking your nose in places it needn't be, Potter. Maybe you and the rest of your gang could just kindly leave?”
However, before either of them could say anything else, Potter’s body was suddenly between them.
“Draco? Are you paying attention?”
His reverie was interrupted by a soft rapping on the bathroom door, which Draco opted to ignore. A moment later, Draco watched distractedly as Harry stepped over to him, but before he could reach out to…help?…hurt?…Draco suddenly seemed to fully register Harry’s presence, fingernails scraping painfully on the tiles as he tried to get away, panic filling his eyes when he realised there was nowhere left to go. Draco kept his wary eyes on Harry, as the man crouched down next to him, one hand held up in a placating gesture.
“You know what, Draco? You should be careful what you wish for.”
mused Harry as he patiently waited for the instructor to check his gear one last time. Once he had the go-ahead, he waddled his way over to where Draco was managing to reduce the assistant to a stuttering mess.
“Hmmm?”
Blaise grinned. "I'm brilliant, of course. We should try the new Italian place in Diagon."
He needn’t have worried, as he found himself being kissed firmly, almost aggressively, in return. Their mouths moved together, their tongues working relentlessly against one another. Hands explored, teeth nipped, and tongues licked as they breathed and moaned into each other, their rapidly filling cocks rubbing together in the most sinful way.
Hermione’s attention snapped to her boyfriend, and Harry had to turn away to hide his giggles.
After staring somewhat open-mouthed at the squawking creatures for a few seconds, Draco scanned the contents and quickly discovered a ‘Duckling Care Checklist’ on page six. He quickly flipped to the allotted page, rustling the grass as he crossed his legs, and began to scan the list for clues.
It was dark outside when Draco finally regained consciousness. The lights in the infirmary had been dimmed, casting sinister-looking, elongated shadows across the walls. There were no signs of McGonagall or Madam Pomfrey. His mother was sitting in her usual chair by his bed, whispering hurriedly with none other than Harry Potter. From the look on Potter’s face, whatever she was hissing at him wasn’t anything good.
“Of course it’s you! Who else would it be?”
“You haven’t changed a bit, have you, Malfoy?”
"Perfect," Harry answered with a strained smile. "I'm very happy that we're finally going to have all the sex."
"Right. Well, before you embark on your great mass murder plans, why don't you sit down and I'll get you a glass of wine and rub your feet."
Draco wanted to yell at his godfather, to demand that this sickness had nothing to do with the essence of himself, that it was something despicable done to him that could be removed and forgotten, but of course, Severus was right. His core was part of him.
A knock on the door wrenched Draco from his reverie. Blaise and Pansy were still squabbling over the validity of Pansy’s newly won bundle of cards, Blaise was once again accusing her of cheating, leaving Draco to be the one to answer the door to Ginny Weasley, looking pale and red-eyed.
“I know, I’m just going to see if they’re any other books. This one’s a bit hard to read, you know?”  Before Hermione could voice an objection to that, he scuttled off after Malfoy.
“This is nice,” observed Luna, “it’s so much easier to chat without all that music, isn’t it?”
Hermione went to reassure them both of her secrecy but was cut off by Neville emitting a howl of utter frustration and dropping to his knees right there in the doorway to Harry's flat. Quickly, she darted over to the wine bottle and poured him a large glass and handed it to him. Sometimes the only way forward was to embrace the bottle and smile.
on my own. The nightmares are as bad as they were before. Are you sleeping?
“I’m sorry for putting us all through all this.”
“He was a fucking kid. We all were! We did what we had to do to make sure our parents weren’t murdered. Maybe they weren’t good people, but they loved us, and we loved them. Maybe they didn’t do anything worthy of a medal, but they meant something to us.”
It was a lovely surprise to see your green eyes open so wide and your lips wobble slightly as you said my name, followed by a swearword (always so classy, Potter), followed by the most tender “I fucking love you, you idiot” I’ve had the pleasure of hearing in my life. I have to confess my knees were a bit weak when you grabbed me by the collar and brought me closer. I didn’t even make it inside before you started kissing me breathless. I think I might have smashed a couple of the mugs while I was trying to get inside and shut the door.
The scream that suddenly filled the room was agonising, as if it was being ripped from somewhere deep within him. His lungs and eyes were burning with the need for release, for oxygen, to cry. He became aware that he was sitting on the floor, his legs against his chest, and for the life of him couldn’t remember making the choice to sit. He lifted his trembling hands and fisted his hair as he sobbed, the eggs running down his face and mixing with his tears and snot. Why was he here? In the beginning, it had all seemed so crystal clear, but now he couldn’t remember. He rested his forehead against his knees, the egg soaking into the material of his school trousers, and cursed the day he was ever born.
If Draco had thought that building the enclosure would be the difficult part, then he had sorely miscalculated! He stood as if frozen inside the enclosure next to the ducklings, who continued to shriek and bump into each other as if their lives depended upon it. Ducklings. He was standing inside a shield-protected enclosure with eight fucking ducklings. Salazar, how did he get himself into these situations? And the noise? Did they always need to make that infernal cry? It was like having a banshee screaming in your face!
“Ah well, it’s all in the book anyway. And they can always talk to us if there’s something they need to know.”
Harry watched Draco walk around the partition and away from him, unable to say anything to undo the damage. Merlin, he’d royally fucked this up and they’d only been vaguely together for about thirty seconds. He felt like giving himself a slow clap.
“Or you could take the hint,” called Pansy as she hefted herself up from the floor to stand behind Draco.
“Truer words were never spoken. Draco Malfoy, would you like to be my date to the reunion? You know, if we ever get out of here and back to the party?”
“Your mother, as your next of kin, has informed us of your condition.” Draco couldn’t help but dart an accusatory glare at his mother, who glared defiantly back at him, before returning his attention upon McGonagall. “Madam Pomfrey has administered a strong Pain-Relief potion mixed with a mild sedative, which should account for any sluggishness you may be feeling at the moment, so please do not be alarmed.”
"What do you mean it's not a big— How long have you known?" she screeched at him, unable to maintain her calm and causing Neville to lean back a bit.
“Draco!”
“Well, you can get a bit Malfoy-centric.”
Slowly, he slid closer to Harry on the sofa until their outer thighs were touching, careful to keep eye contact as he moved.
As the two love birds shared a rather indecent kiss, Hermione quickly grabbed her blouse from Pansy and thrust her arms through the sleeves, her fingers flying over the buttons frantically.
“I found something and I don’t know what to do with them and the library had no books so—”
Harry tried to breathe through the annoyance as he reached down and tugged Draco’s trousers closed, making sure the button at the top was securely fastened.
He cancelled the call and dropped the phone back onto the table with a tired sigh.
"You should ask Harry here for tips. People are
She was heartbroken, and Harry wanted to thump Malfoy’s stupid face for what this was doing to his precious pet. Treacle was usually so smart and loved to play problem solving games. He would set up little obstacle courses for her, and she would complete them in record time. Sometimes, when he was studying, she would bob over his books, nudging him when he was drifting off to sleep or losing focus.
Harry smiled at Kreacher as he set a fresh pot of coffee in front of him. The wrinkled elf nodded and turned back to cleaning the stove, mumbling about coffee not being an appropriate breakfast choice.
“What was that with Pince? Berating senior citizens your new hobby, is it?”
Pansy nodded, seemingly satisfied. "I'd say you're definitely going to crack them first."
“Fuck. I just— fuck!” Harry took a large swallow of his whisky, revelling in the burn as penance. “I’ll fix it. Somehow, I’ll fix it.”
Draco rolled his eyes and took his result, ignoring the smug snort from Potter at the instructor’s pointed comment. Whatever. He passed, and that was the main thing.
“What’re you on about, Malfoy?”
The thought caused a sly, almost evil, smile to spread warmth throughout his body as a fantastic idea began to unfurl in his brain. Malfoy may not want anyone to know, but Harry
Anyway, I know you're busy with Auror training, so I will leave you.
“Is that a yes?”
"What?" he asked in a perfect example of puzzlement. "He sounded nice, and it's not like I've got loads planned for later." He looked at Pansy. "And as you so rightfully pointed out, I'm single. So why not?"
“Do you- ah- want a drink or something?” Harry panted in between kisses, trying to gain some semblance of control over the situation.
"I know, Harry. I know more than anyone how bloody hard you work. I'm just—" Draco seemed unable to say just exactly what he was thinking, and trailed off with a vague gesture at the room in general.
Merlin, the way you kissed me… I just can’t stop thinking about the feeling of your lips on mine, the slow drag of your tongue in my mouth. I never thought I could get so hard from a simple kiss. Although there was nothing simple about it, not when I think about the way your fingers slid through my hair and gently tugged. Or the way you gasped when I lifted your t-shirt and pressed our chests together. Gods, the sounds you brought out from me. I want to dig a hole in the ground and dive into it when I think of the way I moaned when you sucked on my neck whilst you gripped my arse and rubbed your dick against mine. I didn’t think it would be possible to lick chocolate ganache off someone’s abs, so that was a learning curve. What the fuck, Harry, when did you get those lickable abs anyway? Auror training is definitely doing some good for you.
“What?!”
Neville didn't even have enough energy to tease; he just raised his voice loud enough to be heard across the room in the kitchen area of their flat. "How on Earth did you get a rash on your arse? What were you doing, shagging in the bushes?" He sighed at Harry's acknowledging chuckle. "There's a rash cream in the potions' chest, but you'd do better with a couple leaves from the plant on the windowsill with the red spine. Dock leaves are perfect for nettles and such."
P.P.S. I will have you know that I make a perfectly decent hummus, thank you very much!
“I don’t hate you, Draco.”
Draco yawned as he poured himself another black coffee. He was so tired he didn’t think there was a word for it. He’d always wondered how many children he would have when the time came, and this whole debacle just confirmed the niggling suspicion he’d always had that maybe, just maybe, he wasn’t cut out to be a parent. If his mother wanted a Malfoy heir then she was going to be sorely disappointed!
“We agree, don’t we Draco?” His mother’s voice brooked no argument, and Draco found himself nodding his acquiescence.
Draco had no idea what, in the name of Salazar, the mental case was thinking, but there was absolutely no way he was getting behind the wheel of a Muggle vehicle. It was, quite literally, the last thing he would ever agree to do. From the looks on many of his classmates' faces, they felt similarly. Only Granger was predictably excited, squealing, “Oh, this will be fascinating!” while the Weasel sat next to her looking like he wanted to throw up. Strangely, Potter looked bored with the whole thing. Although, Draco had to concede that the prospect of driving a Muggle car would be less frightening than facing the Dark Lord in a duel.
“Say Malfoy? I don’t suppose you’d like to go for a drink in Hogsmeade with me? Provided we can get a seahorse sitter, of course.”
Neville's legs floated into the air and Draco plopped down, cancelling the spell, Neville's legs falling onto Draco's lap.
Anyway, I’m lying next to you, in your ginormous bed that smells like you and me and sex, and I’m writing to you. Because I didn’t actually send my last letter. You see, you always think I’m a coward, and I know sometimes I am, but yesterday I wasn’t.
“With cheese and gravy and ketchup?”
Then, the smile on Draco’s face vanished, leaving a vulnerable frown in its place.
“‘Mione!” screeched Ron as Harry tried to hold in the laugh that was bubbling in his throat. “Look, let’s just go home and snuggle. You like to snuggle, don’t you?” Harry watched Ron try to reason with Hermione, who unfortunately seemed more intent on trying to climb Ron’s body than actually listening to him. “Come on, love. We can grab some chips on the way.”
“And to think you had the cheek to scoff at Treacle?”
Seamus stopped suddenly at the appearance of a thick piece of rope directly next to his legs, woven into an impossibly complicated knot.
It seemed as if he were seeing things happen in slow motion. He watched Harry lift his right hand as if to stroke his chest, stopping just shy of touching the skin.
Sure enough, in the large tank, was a very happy Treacle, her tail wrapped around a sleeping Atlantis, with at least twenty babies floating between them both. Slowly, quietly, both young men crept towards the tank and knelt on the floor, their noses mere inches from the seahorse family.
…about the ferret. Having firmly anchored himself in a non-perving-over-one’s-nemesis place, in the end, he had to admit this idea was simply impractical.
Draco scowled and plunged his hand inside his cloak for another Pain-Relief potion, swallowing the entire thing in one go. His chest was beginning to hurt again, and the last thing he needed was his core distracting him as he tried to operate Muggle death machines.
Treacle’s mate!”
a chance, Draco! And you
“Merlin,” sighed Harry, running his hands over his face. “This whole thing would be so much easier if we could just get pissed and be done with it.”
“Harry! What did you give him? Amortentia?” He ignored the surprised gasp from Granger, focusing instead on his supposed best friend. “Stop playing dumb. You said yourself you were going to do something to snap me out of my mood. Whatever it was you did, I want the bloody antidote. Now.”
like this for more than five bloody minutes. Is that too much to ask?”
“I could make him. He owes me a life debt—” Her words sent a surge of panic through his body, and he sat forward on the bed, angrily leaning into her tired face.
“Look, if he’s pregnant there’s not much we can do about it. Anyway, I don’t think it’s that big of a deal. They’ve chosen each other as mates. I think you’re overreacting.”
He set the shower at the hottest temperature he could stand and stepped under the spray. Desperate to get the feeling of grime away, he loaded up his hands with shampoo and began to scrub, digging his fingernails into his scalp until it began to sting. His ears were throbbing with the echoes of abuse and he found himself turning the spray pressure up higher to try and block it out. His eyes smarted as the sheer frustration tried to force out tears, but he wouldn’t let them come.
“Draco Malfoy, I am very sorry I upset you.”
“I just realised what the missing ingredient for my Potion’s project is. It was there under my nose the whole fucking time!” He cast a quick Cleaning Charm and began to dress quickly as he grinned excitedly at Harry.
"What would you have me do? It's not like I can just say, 'sorry guys, cook your own food cause the other half is feeling needy?' Not ruddy likely, Draco."
“Do speak up, Mother,” yawned Draco with as much dignity as he could muster. “It’s rather difficult for those of us on our deathbeds to contribute if you insist on whispering.” His mother and Potter looked at him with varying degrees of surprise, and in Potter’s case, annoyance.
“Draco?”
“Who doesn’t like the smell of apples? Crisp, fresh, clean. And it doesn’t make me feel like I’m suffocating.”
“Oh, shut it. You were a berk, and you know it.” Draco watched as Harry squinted into his mug as if there was courage or answers to be found within it. “So, are we going to sit here while you literally fade away to nothing, or are we going to talk about this whole bonding sex thing?”
He notices that every night, Draco sings to ducklings as they snuggle down into an overly fluffy fur hat they seem to be using as a nest. He makes sure they’re all comfortable and warm and strokes their yellowish feathers gently as he tentatively begins to sing to them. Merlin! Harry thinks he might actually die from the beauty of that voice. After a while, Harry makes sure to never miss the duck’s bedtime routine just so he can hear Draco’s low singing smooth over his skin warmly like liquid silver and wrap around him like a comfort blanket. Every time it rains Harry finds himself thinking of the song and has to bite his lip to stop himself from humming the tune. One night, after a particularly vicious nightmare of Bellatrix slicing Hermione’s arm, Harry remembers the hauntingly beautiful words Draco usually sings to the ducklings and wishes he could ask Draco to sing to him and stroke his hair in the same way.
He stepped up to the bar door and pushed it open, wincing slightly at the sheer volume of music and the smell of sweat and other bodily fluids that hit him like a freight train. He froze on the threshold and tried to adjust to the gloom and heat of the place before forcing himself to move further inside. His brain was sagging under the pressure of everything Narcissa had told him that evening, and, more than anything, he wanted to find Draco and just sit in a quiet room with a very large glass of firewhisky.
“Cheesy, Potter. Merlin, you’re such a Hufflepuff.”
“Draco, Merlin, can I?” Warm hands were hovering just under the waistband of his bottoms, and Draco found himself nodding, suddenly desperate as those hands slid down over his arse, grasping his buttocks and pulling him impossibly closer, giving Draco that much-needed friction on his aching cock.
I didn’t want our relationship to end up on the list of things I’ve managed to ruin.
“Come now, Mr Malfoy. Your mother has informed us only of what you ought to have yourself. We’ve sent for Mr Potter, and will explain the situation—”
“You aren’t done, are you?” Hermione asked, frowning at the food still left on his plate. “You’ve barely eaten anything.”
"Just a little while longer." Draco pleaded, and Neville sighed.
The slam of the door could be heard down in the eighth year common room as Draco stomped his way into his room, his hair sticky and wet with spit — a reminder according to the Gryffindor seventh years who had gotten hold of him. He dropped his bag by the door and made his way directly into the bathroom, grateful that at least the showers were ensuite and not communal like they were for the lower houses. He locked the door behind him and began to peel his robes off, trying hard not to wince at the amount of sweat and dirt and spit clinging to them. To be fair, it was his own fault. He knew he was a target. He knew they tended to try and get him in between classes so the teachers didn’t see. He knew it was risky going down to check the ducklings again that morning, what with the greenhouses being so close by. He should have been paying attention.
"Oh yeah," she replied, scrunching up her nose in thought. "Remember last year when that case with the kids broke? I don't think he was in his right mind for weeks."
For EvAEleanor
Neville sat up groaning and hit his alarm into silence. He rubbed his grainy eyes and tried to shake away the disorientation of his late afternoon nap. He'd been having such a good dream too. There wasn't much use in complaining about it though; it wasn't like his Mimbulus Mimbletonia could water itself. He heaved himself out of bed, shoved his feet into his slippers, and padded out of his room towards the bathroom, stopping short.
, Harry decided,
“Or I could wait for him?”
“Because it’s true. I’ve been a grumpy, miserable bastard without you. Ask anyone. Hell, ask Pansy! She was so fed up with me at dinner, she threw her pumpkin juice at me.”
“Now, Harry. I need it now!” demanded Draco, and Harry quickly pulled his fingers from his body with an audible squelch and lined up the head of his cock with Draco’s loosened hole.
The guys surrounding Draco were wasting no time, each one trying to stroke parts of Draco as he gyrated and swayed to the beat. One of the men ran a hand across Draco’s hip and gripped his arse, and suddenly Harry was charging across the club, pushing people out of his way roughly as he went, until he finally reached the group. Without thinking, he grabbed the offending guy and yanked him away from Draco, who simply turned and watched the proceedings as if it were a mildly interesting movie and not an all-out brawl.
“Harry, I just— You left. After the cure and the bond and everything... you packed your trunk and left.”
It wasn’t a question, and Draco knew it. He stared at Harry, seemingly searching for something, and then finally nodded. Harry stepped up to Draco and wrapped his arms around his waist, taking a moment to press a kiss to his mouth, and then apparated them both to his bedroom. It was already after 2 am, and they didn’t have time to waste on using the stairs.
Hermione cast a quick Tempus, frowned, and then recast it in doubt. “That’s weird, we’ve apparently only been in the room for a few minutes!”
“Whatever, Malfoy. If I think you’re stoned, I’m reporting you.”
“Oh, he can’t sit down.” Draco groaned almost painfully as Neville managed to calm down long enough to explain the situation in their room this morning. Suddenly, Draco found himself wishing he had obliviated the memory from the git. Of course he was going to go telling everyone! He flicked his wand at his cup and murmured a quick cooling charm, hoping to take the edge off the heat enough to drink it quicker. To be fair, he wouldn’t have even bothered with breakfast if it wasn’t for the book on teaching ducklings to forage he was expecting with the owl post.
“I know, Potter. I fucked up.” Malfoy’s words shocked Harry out of his reverie, and he looked at his old nemesis, locking eyes with an intensity that left him almost breathless.
"You'd think being a librarian would be relaxing," mused Harry, unaware that his words were causing Draco to glare at him heatedly. "What with all the silence and reading and whatnot."
He finally reached his room and pushed the door open, only to be rewarded with a thudding on his head and a wet, sticky sensation running down his forehead and neck.
"Well, I guess now that you're in my arms, there's nothing left to do but actually kiss." Harry looked pale and sweaty, like a trapped animal. However, she recognised the glint in his eyes, the stubborn edge he took on when faced with overwhelming odds.
“What was that about?” Harry’s baffled look made Draco cringe. He took a deep breath and plunged in.
"I know. I think he's been feeling bad about it, to be honest. Don't let it get to you; it's not personal."
I fucked up so badly, Harry. I always do, but it’s never on purpose. You’re the only person I didn’t want to hurt, I swear. You’re the only one who really matters in my wretched life and I will never be able to forgive myself for making you feel unwanted.
“Well, we weren’t about to let you bother Draco,” said Pansy. “It’s three against one!”
“Huh? Look it’s two in the bloody morning, and we have Potions first thing. Can you just tell me what the hell you want?”
Harry's eyes softened, and he ran a finger along Draco's cheek. "You're ridiculous. That's not you anymore."
“Hermione, I—”
“Ensure your potions are appropriately labelled and left upon my desk for my assistant, Mr Davis, to grade. Once you have done so, you may go. Obviously, next lesson you will be required to submit the subject and outline of focus for your individual projects. Do not forget, or you’ll suffer my displeasure.”
“It wasn’t me,” Justin protested. “It just closed on its own.”
Neville heaved a long-suffering sigh. "What are you looking for, Harry? Please just tell me so I can have five minutes of peace?"
“Whisky.”
“Here, give me that stuff,” ordered Harry firmly, as he took his bag and books from him and sat them onto the sofa. “I was worried about you, that maybe your core was low or something.”
"Thor has his hammer! That's much better than a crummy old wand." Pansy's voice was beginning to rise as she got caught up in the argument as usual.
“I’m not hungry,” informed Harry, unable to stomach yet another bout of bickering between his friends.
Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, had a splitting headache. He blamed Hermione since she’d been the one to drag them out to the latest gay bar. She’d coaxed and cajoled and outright demanded, and before Harry knew what had happened, he and Ron had been shoved into their jackets and dragged out into the night.
“Say that again; I dare you.”
"You have no bloody idea!"
Harry leaned back into the cushions lining his armchair and gazed into the fire, trying to think of new ways to make Draco smile that little bit more.
“I didn’t think you’d want me to eat with you,” confessed Harry, blushing a little.
I love you,
“You’re kidding! I can’t take care of ducklings!”
Slowly, he stepped towards the middle cubicle and paused, listening for Draco’s familiar drawl.
Harry
“I’m going to apparate us, are you ready?” He waited for Draco to nod before he spun them, picturing Grimmauld Place clearly in his mind’s eye.
“Yes, of course. I’ll keep whatever it  is to myself.” Harry murmured, feeling he might burst from the anticipation.
“Give what a minute? Never mind me, are
"Sorry I was so long, I couldn't find the oil at first—" Harry had come striding out of the bathroom and stopped dead at the sight of Hermione sitting half-naked on his couch.
Draco sighed. “Don’t, Theo. You’ll just set the Hufflepuff off on her banshee impersonation again. My ears have been abused enough, if you don’t mind.”
“My brother died because of you, and so did Dumbledore, and Tonks—” Ginny broke off, her words hindered by the sobs that were shaking her lithe frame. Draco watched with discomfort as Harry stepped forwards and wrapped a protective arm around her quivering shoulders.
The ginger bint turned towards him, her eyes narrowed dangerously. Draco was glad for the chance to vent and found himself sneering at her in response.
I don’t want to talk about it, Pansy. Please, just go, will you?”
As if sensing he had an audience, Draco’s eyes snapped open and fixed Harry with a penetrating stare. It was surreal, Harry decided, to have someone watch you as you watched them get sucked off. He could tell every time the brunette did something Draco liked from the way Draco’s lust blown eyes would narrow to slits, as if relishing the pleasure.
For a moment, Potter simply looked at him. Draco’s breath hitched in his throat at the sight of Potter’s caramel skin as he began to strip. His chest was hard and toned with a light dusting of fine black hair across the centre and down his abs, forming a sinful pleasure trail that disappeared into the waistband of his novelty boxers. Sure enough, there were tattoos across Potter’s chest, his biceps, and even one on a rather firm thigh, the ink sneaking out from under his boxers and winding down almost to the knee. The sight made Draco want to touch the ink on his own thigh, sure he could feel the snake undulating in a bid for attention. Harry was right, they were almost the same as his, right down to the location of each tattoo.
“Then you thought wrong.”
“Diving right into the heart of the matter as per usual?”
“What does that mean?”
Neville took the offending letter and scanned it, his face going blank as he read.
“Good night, Draco. Until tomorrow.”
“Yes, Mother! That’s exactly what I mean! It’s my life, and if I want to make a choice that affects the length and quality of my life, then you need to accept it. Look at this! Look at what you’ve caused!” He found himself gesturing in the general direction of Pomfrey’s office as he tried his damndest to make his mother understand. “Instead of getting to choose for myself, there are three people in there; Three! Deciding on my fate! And not one of those people is me!” The energy gathering at the tips of his fingers nipped and burned, as if desperate for an outlet.
"Keep still, Hermione, or you're going to end up with lipstick on your eyelids instead of on your lips."
“Ah.” Draco watched Severus process the information, the slight widening of his obsidian eyes the only hint that of the surprise he surely felt. “Yes. I can see how that would make you want to seek an alternative. You do realise that there is as much chance of failure as there is success? Perhaps moreso?”
Harry still wears his invisibility cloak and watches him play with the ducklings. He seems to have them named and spends more time with them than he does with actual people. Harry isn’t sure he can blame him, considering how people have been treating him lately.
“So what do we do?” demanded Draco as he watched the largest of the ducklings begin to make its way around the perimeter of the shield, as if determined to find an opening.
“Way,” declared Neville authoritatively. “A couple of days ago I just got back from the greenhouses with my mini Caucasian Elm plant and Malfoy was standing in the middle of the room in nothing but a towel, waving this stupid stuffed duck around!” Weasley almost choked on his mouthful of sausage as Neville grinned generously at his housemates. “Then, I kid you not, he demands that I put the teddy there. As if it wasn’t his all alone.”
“Oi, you keep your mitts off my sister!” yelled Ron, as he tore off down the corridor after Blaise, Hermione jogging along behind her boyfriend, her face worried.
The only way I can possibly start this letter is with an apology.
"This is just sick, Draco. Sick! I feel filthy! She's got her boobs all pushed up and is pouting like a trout pleading for its life, and I have no idea what the hell to do about it!"
Malfoy’s steely voice began, but before he could get any further, Parkinson, Nott, and Zabini huffed over to them, looking breathless and extremely worried.
not that big a deal. They're shagging, they're happy, and for some weird reason, they seem determined to keep it a secret. So please, just don't tell anyone you know. And maybe don't mention to them that you know either. They'll tell you in their own time, okay?"
Honestly, he’d mostly only given in to her to shut her up on the subject. But it was painfully dull and he’d already resorted to drawing little Snitches on his parchment instead of taking notes. A quick look over at Ron confirmed he was in a similar state of torture as Harry, his vacant stare aimed in the general direction of the Transfiguration textbook he was supposed to be reading.
Dear Harry,
Draco woke to hushed whispers. His eyes felt as if they were full of sand or grit, but his arms were too heavy to lift to rub them. He wasn’t shaking and the pain was less, which made no sense. He forced his eyes open, only to scrunch them closed again as the light within the room, although muted, caused pain to shoot through his head.
hero.
Draco shot a sneer in his general direction and huffed off towards the kitchen with the broken picture frame. Harry found himself shrugging and following his partner. To be fair, it was a bit of a silly piece of advice to offer when Draco was in such a mood.
"Not that I'm complaining, but you've been hanging around here a lot lately." Pansy looked at Neville carefully, concern clear in her eyes. "Have you fallen out with Harry or something?"
“I was wrong, though. I must have mistaken the signs, and I’m sorry.”
“Lillies and Narcissus— The two flowers that make up this bouquet just happen to be the names of your mothers? I think Hermione’s right. It’s a clue that this whole thing is to do with you two and your constant circling each other.”
“A kilted love what?” asked Draco, his forehead wrinkled in confusion. He tried to think back to what he knew about folklore from the stories his mother used to tell him, but there was nothing he could remember about rope.
"Yes, you do," Neville said with a bitter laugh. "I hope it was worth it. I got stuck on patrol with Lavender."
“Shhhh,” soothed Harry, “let me take care of you.” Draco rested his face in the crook of Harry’s neck, gasping and writhing as Harry worked the tip of the finger into his wet hole, until it was inside him up to the knuckle.
Narcissa had sent over Draco’s things. Their evenings were spent reading aloud to each other, playing chess (which Harry lost spectacularly at), or listening to the Quidditch league results on the radio. Anxious to ensure Draco felt at home, Harry had allowed him to redecorate his room to his liking, letting him have free reign with paint samples and furniture catalogues.
“All done. If that’s all, I have many things to which I must attend. Since we are so close to the end of the school year and there are no members of faculty requiring these quarters, you may have the choice to either stay here or return to your previous rooms. Good day to you both.” With a final nod, she strode from the room in a swish of tartan robes.
"I know, right?" Draco grinned, oblivious to his friend's upset. "Imagine keeping a prime specimen such as myself off the market. Now, come on. I've told you my lack of gossip. How about you tell me what's going on with you?"
“Fine,” huffed Draco, “you can have your foot back and I’ll read it myself.”
“What would you wish for, if resolutions were valid?”
“But I don’t get how you think it’s mine?” voiced Harry, his brain finally starting to rumble back into gear. “I mean, surely I’m not the only one who’s...been with Draco that way.”
Draco sighed and stepped over to take the seat next to Luna, his entire body weary with tension as he sank into the plush cushions. He thought about what Vince would do if he were there and had to suppress a smile at the thought of the large boy throwing his weight at the door in an attempt to break it down. The phrase ‘all brawn and no brains’ was Vince through and through.
Suddenly, Harry felt the proverbial Knut drop, and he tried valiantly not to smile, sure that Malfoy wouldn’t appreciate it.
Something seemed off about that, but Neville couldn't decide what.
“Treacle did what? She hasn’t been anywhere near your room in two weeks thanks to that stupid ward, so I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
"Oh, fuck," Harry pulled out his wand, and Neville flinched, sure he was about to be Obliviated by one of his best friends. But Harry just spun his wand around and cast a Privacy Charm.
Dear – fuck, this is hard – Harry,
“Harry,” groaned Draco, suddenly sounding so exhausted that Harry found himself abandoning the pumpkin juice and turning to face his husband. “This is intolerable enough as it is without you acting like Molly Weasley on some kind of muggle stimulant.”
“I saw you, skulking around the Magical Creatures section and giving Pince a hard time. I don’t know what your problem is but I’m watching you, Malfoy.”
"What about you, Pans? How come you're so happy?" Hermione had noticed that she looked sly and pleased, which was never a good thing where Pansy was concerned. The woman was a Slytherin to the core.
Nothing happened.
But I fucked up, Harry.
“Are you asking me out on a date, Potter?”
“Oh, not you too!”
“Hands off!”
He heaved a heavy sigh and walked over to the large tank taking up over half of the wall next to his bed. He smiled at his new pet, a magical flying seahorse measuring just under a foot long, happily bobbing about riding the small currents from the water filter.
“What are you trying to say, Potter?” The wild creature inside his chest was back, fluttering around, stirring up traces of hope he never knew were there. He’d dreamed of exactly this, of Harry coming for him and making everything better again.
