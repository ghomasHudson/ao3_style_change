"You are so perfect," Harry whispered back and slide his hands up and down Draco's back. "And you're all mine," he growled into his ear making all Draco's body shiver violently.
"It's okay, Ron. I told you guys I trust Snape, and he is helping. Go to the kitchen, Kreacher made a dinner."
"Draco," Draco almost cried out in disappointment when Harry stopped the kiss to look at him. "Draco, is something wrong?"
All Draco could do was to stand there with impossibly wide eyes, panicking and trying not to faint. Harry's face was full of desire, and the moment their eyes locked, Draco forgot how to breathe.
Draco paused in his eating because it was hard to look at Potter when he was like this, so open and so handsome, smiling at Draco so... fondly.
Even Weasley felt silent after these words. And Draco stood frozen on the staircase, his heart beating madly somewhere in his throat.
"You're so fucking hot, baby," Harry whispered into his ear. "So gorgeous," he licked Draco's earlobe, and Draco shuddered, whimpering quietly.
They just looked at each other for a few seconds before Draco swallowed nervously and awkwardly cleared his throat.
He did. But Draco knew that Harry was strong, stronger that Dark Lord's emotions, even stronger than he could possibly imagine himself.
He also met a lot of Harry's friends, who liked hanging out in the bar too. They all were so different; Draco couldn't imagine how they even managed to become friends in the first place.
Draco returned to his work while Harry was talking and was glad for it, he really didn't know what he could answer to that. He thought what was going on this time two years ago and it made him feel sad a little. Two years ago Harry's Godfather was alive, Dumbledore was alive, Draco's own father had never been in Azkaban and Draco himself didn't have a Dark Mark on his left forearm.
"Hermione, it's much more than just these stupid visions, okay?" Harry cut her off with a sigh, loosening his hands around Draco's waist and allowing him to slide off his lap and onto the chair next to him.
"What is it, baby?" Harry was looking at him worriedly. "Draco, I– It's– It never really occurred to me that you might– I wasn't– I always was sure to ask you everything– Why haven't you say anything? I'm really –"
But clearly Severus didn't think this way and just continued to look at both of them with a dead glare.
"It is not just an insult, Potter," Severus hissed at him. "It is the official order to capture you at every possible opportunity. Not only Death Eaters are after you now. It is an official crime for a common wizard to help you or to hide you. This is going to be spread in the Muggle world too, just like it was with your precious Black. Do you finally understand?" Severus glanced at Draco. "This all was Lucius' idea."
"We can and we will not," Harry said firmly, unconsciously caressing the marks he left on Draco's thighs yesterday, and Draco was sure that Hermione was annoyed by this more than by what she and Harry were talking about. "I wasn't asking your permission, 'Mione, I told you about what we need to do. Close the pub after lunch and you can be free if you want. Draco and I will come around seven, so we can prepare the place."
– room and read a book which he wisely took from home with him. It was a romance novel that Pansy gave him in the end of their school year, and reading it had helped him to keep his thoughts away for a while.
"Yes, it is," Severus started to walk up the stairs. "Try to be quiet in the hall," he told him before he pushed the large wooden door and came into the house, Draco quickly followed him in.
"It's really very tasty, Ron," Granger said with a smile, and to Draco's horror did the same thing as Harry – took the piece in her hands, then took a rather impressive bite from it.
"I've never done anything with anyone before you," he whispered, hiding his face in Harry's neck. "Not even– no cuddling, no actual touching, no kisses of course, and obviously nothing more..."
After eight days without someone to talk to, except for Kreacher and Potter's notes, Draco began to feel he's about to lose his mind. He became very aware of Death Eaters' presence in the square in front of the house, so he became afraid to look out of the windows. He jumped on every single sound and always leaved the doors open, so he could hear everything.
"I don't actually live on some desert island, you know. I have a calendar too," Draco answered him dryly.
Potter had a nerve to smirk at the man and this made Severus absolutely mad. He stormed out of the kitchen and after a few seconds there was a rather loud bang of a furiously slammed door.
"Oh, Merlin, not you too," Potter snorted. "I have it under control now. I can actually Occlude, but I want to know what's going on there. Kreacher! Kreacher, take Malfoy's things to my old room. Bring clean towels, some big bowl and a jar with cold water as well. And don't go anywhere." Potter walked to where Draco stood and was taking potions from the shelf while he was talking; he put one phial into his pocket, and held others in his hands.
"The locket!" Weasley yelled looking like he was about to go mad. To be honest, all three of them looked like that.
"The locket, Ron," Harry cried out too, eyes wide. "You're great too, 'Mione," they were staring at each other, clasping each other's hands.
His Harry, who was an incredibly sensuous lover, who could be tenderly gentle and passionately rough at the same time, Draco sometimes couldn't believe he was even real.
"She's furious? She fucking left me alone at my fucking birthday!" Draco interrupted him, standing up from the couch.
Draco threw his head back on Harry's shoulder, sobbing and whimpering pathetically, and trying to move his hips more, but Harry held his waist in the iron grip that didn't really allow him to move the way he wanted.
"I looked in nearly every book at Hogwarts' library, but couldn't find even one name that would fit with these initials," Granger said with a desperate sigh.
Draco had already forgotten that Harry and Pansy knew each other. They weren't really friends, he thought, or Pansy would've mentioned Harry before.
Potter cast a Cooling charm on the water while he was talking and pressed an almost frosty towel to Draco's Mark. It was much better and Draco said that to Potter who gave him very tired but surprisingly warm smile in return.
"Kreacher is very sorry to interrupt, but Kreacher is so happy to see his Half-blood Master finally finding his courage and–"
But actually Draco liked their strolls a lot for many different reasons. The real beauty of the nature was one of them.
"Because he and I were discussing this opportunity for a while now. It took me surprisingly a little amount of time to convince him that you should be here. Potter and his little group of friends had some plans for this place too and he didn't want to change them," Severus leaned back in his chair and waved his wand sending his plate and cup to the sink.
"Not everything is about you, Malfoy," Potter smirked and nudged him a little with his shoulder. "I'm okay, it is not a big deal."
"You're not going to throw me out, are you?" Draco asked him, trying to remove trembling from his voice.
"Great!" Harry grinned at him, then turned to look at Draco. "Can I take you home now, baby? We can grab some Chinese on our way, if you're hungry."
"Ron, do you hear yourself? Stop being ridiculous and eat your dinner," Granger said rolling her eyes, and for once Draco agreed with her.
Harry's hands clutched at the either side of Draco's ribs, and for a second Draco thought that Harry was actually going to drag him to himself over the table not caring about dishes and glasses on it, but next moment there was a sound of someone cleaning their throat and they pulled away from each other.
"You're not allowed to come unless you have your cock in my mouth," Harry said and Draco almost choked on his own whimpers, nodding quickly. "You understand, babe? Use your words, Draco."
Severus had already finished his breakfast and was drinking coffee when Draco showed up at the kitchen almost thirty minutes later.
After a couple of hours Draco heard footsteps on the stairs and in a few minutes there was a loud shouting from somewhere downstairs. He laid an open book on the bed and hurried to the sound of arguing voices.
Aside from Luna of course. She was just one of a kind and Draco genuinely liked her with all of her weirdness.
Eventually Harry pulled away from him and leaned his forehead on the kitchen door near Draco's head, breathing heavily.
It was hard to convince Potter that Black's death wasn't his fault and Draco wasn't sure he really succeeded in this.
Potter placed Draco's hand in the palm of his other hand, and the hand which was earlier holding Draco's found its way around Draco's shoulders, drawing Draco even closer to Potter's body.
"I'm sorry, babe, but I couldn't wait any longer to tell you," Harry said and reached his hand to hold Draco's over the table. "Do you like it?"
But later at night when Draco was lying in bed and inhaling Potter's scent from his clothes, he remembered how Potter stood by the window in the drawing room with him watching Death Eaters' appearance in that square, Potter's strong arm around Draco's slightly shaking shoulders; Potter squeezing his hand telling him he was safe here, before he threw his Cloak over himself and left – Draco couldn't care less about a color of the t-shirt he had to slept in. It was Potter's and it helped him to feel safe.
But he immediately forgot everything about his supposed friends when he looked up at Harry who was now laughing rather loudly. His head with its black perfectly messy locks was thrown back, his green eyes shining even more, and his whole body shaking, and for now
"I don't understand you," Draco said watching the side of Potter's face. "You're helping me, hiding me in your home and don't throw me out, you're making your elf cook for me, you're talking to me like you don't hate me, you're showing me something I might like. You even made sandwiches for me last night! It's almost– It's like you care... about– about me..."
Harry put the blindfold on and kissed Draco's lips again. He spent a good amount of time kissing, licking and sucking on Draco's collarbones, then his nipples, making Draco lose all ability to speak and to think.
"Lay him on the bed," Draco said hurriedly and moved out of the Weasley's way who obeyed him, probably too scared to realize who he was listening to. "Kreacher!" Draco looked at the elf who was still standing in the middle of the room. "Bring essences of Dittany and Murtlap, Blood-Replenishing and Pain-Relieving potions from my lab." Elf didn't move. "Now!" Draco shouted at him.
"Kreacher!" Potter called for his elf, who appeared in front of them already muttering something. "Shut up, Kreacher, I know you hate me, there's no need to tell me this every time you see me. Go and check what Ron and Hermione are doing. They must not see you. If they're not in the tent, bring my backpack. Go now and don't make any noise."
Draco felt stupid and embarrassed again. Harry thought about their safety and Draco was acting like some teenage girl who only cared about her hair.
This morning Draco went downstairs with his usual little basket full of blackberries and blueberries and almost dropped it when he saw a tall dark figure in the hall.
Millie leaned her head on his shoulder to look at the screen and giggled when she saw the black-and-white picture of a shirtless smiling Harry with three emoji-hearts on top of the screen instead of the name.
Draco blinked, realizing that he was lying absolutely naked in the middle of Harry's large bed, with an equally naked Harry lying next to him, stroking Draco's hair and smiling at him softly. Draco opened his mouth to answer, but Harry didn't give him a chance, kissing him deeply and so sweetly, Draco forgot what he even wanted to say.
"Yeah, baby, me too," Harry said and kissed his mouth, swallowing Draco's helpless moans and whimpers. "Do it," Harry whispered against Draco's lips. "Come, baby," he kissed him again. "Come for me, Draco."
Potter didn't answer and led Draco to the first room to the right. Draco, who thought they were going to the room where he spent the night, almost collapsed into him, but caught himself in time and followed him in.
Draco was sure Potter was going to go to Godrik's Hollow after Severus told him that Dark Lord called Rowle back. They didn't meet after that morning when Harry showed him the sunrise, but he sent Draco a note writing that he and his friends would be busy for a couple of days.
Though it was really hard, Draco was finally able to collect himself too and quickly stood up next to Potter, drawing his own wand from his sleeve and looking around nervously.
"Potter, it's half past nine," Draco interrupted him. "I had my dinner before your pompous appearance."
"Open it," surprisingly it was Weasley who said that. Harry and Granger turned their heads sharply to look at him, but he just shrugged one shoulder. "Well, he might know," Weasley added somehow defensively and Harry gave him a smile lifting one corner of his mouth before he turned to Draco and gestured for him to do what he was told.
When, after a couple of minutes, Harry pulled away and sat up, straddling Draco's hips, Draco was able to manage a breathless "Yes, yes, Harry!" and was rewarded with Harry's gorgeous smile.
Weasley and Granger were still there, but once again gave him and Harry no attention, bickering about something Draco didn't care enough to listen.
He then turned to Harry and took Harry's cup of tea too before walking to sit at the table while Harry was ordering Kreacher to make every meal for everyone at the house, including 'Ron and Hermione'. Kreacher was grumbling disapprovingly but a minute later four plates with toasts, bacon and scrambled eggs appeared on the table.
Draco took his hand carefully and almost melted inside. The sensation of his cool thin fingers being wrapped in the man's –
"Mate– " Weasley started saying something but Harry just looked at him and Weasley stopped though he was still looking very uncertain and a little annoyed.
"Mister Snape called for Kreacher and gave him a little piece of parchment. He ordered Kreacher to find Master immediately and made sure Master's friends read the parchment before Kreacher must apparate them here." Elf suddenly started shivering. "Young Master Black, Kreacher is sorry!" he cried out and threw himself on the floor in front of Draco. "Kreacher cannot do a favor young Master Black asked him to do! Kreacher cannot reach Mister Snape! Young Master Black, Kreacher is so sorry!"
Draco went to sit in front of Weasley who glanced at him with annoyance, muttering something about disgusting behavior and suffering from it.
Draco didn't give himself any time to think, he just acted. He walked to Harry and hugged him from behind, putting his arms around Harry's middle and pressing his cheek between his shoulder blades.
"Yeah, Luna, this is Draco," Harry said, blushing a little. He laid his big hand on Draco's lower back and drew him a little closer. "It's Draco's birthday today and he hasn't had his birthday cake yet!"
What could be more romantic than a trip to Italy? To Venice? Just the two of them for ten days and ten nights?
Potter's hands were big and rough, but warm and surprisingly very gentle. He was holding Draco's arm in one of his hands and carefully pressing a wet towel on Draco's Mark with the other. It was hard not to think about how nice and soothing his touch felt.
"Yes," Draco still felt uncertain but he smiled at Harry, trying not to look at the direction of the Weasel, who was stuffing his stupid mouth with food with the grace of a Mountain Troll.
He was wearing a black leather jacket over a plain white t-shirt that hugged his torso in all the right places; his dark blue jeans were tucked into black leather boots and were doing a great job showing off his muscular thighs (and the rest of his legs, as well as his ass, though unfortunately Draco couldn't see it properly right now). His jet black hair looked messy, like it had never seen a comb in its life, but somehow it made him look even sexier.
Potter said he used to fight with his cousin a lot when they were kids and earlier he was describing him like an 'overgrown fat hog'. Draco remembered skinny little Potter from first and second years very well to imagine what kind of fights it actually was.
"Leave me out of this, Ronald," Granger's voice was annoyed too and Draco wondered if they were listening Weasley's hysterics all the time he was busy with his potions.
"Malfoy, do you really think I would put you in such kind of danger?" Potter's face was so close to his and he was still holding his hand, so it was hard for Draco to think at all.
"Kreacher!" Harry called for the elf who appeared near the bed already muttering something. "Shut it, Kreacher. Tell me why did you bring my friends in here," he ordered.
"Draco," Harry was looking at him with concern. "Why are you not eating? You don't like it? Eat at least mashed potatoes, okay?" he laid his hand on Draco's thigh and was rubbing it with his thumb.
He looked a little surprised when he spotted Draco standing near the kitchen counter. Draco thought that maybe he had already forgotten Draco was here. So Potter's next question caught him off guard.
He was brewing a lot of Pain-Relieving (his Dark Mark was burning sometimes) and Blood-Replenishing (when he thought about Potter in a nice black dress robe covered in blood) potions. He'd brew a Dreamless Sleep potion for himself, but Severus didn't like the idea and refused to bring him moonseeds.
"You look good in green," Potter said then turned sharply and walk to the kitchen counter. Draco blushed and swallowed trying not to look at Severus who watched him with a raised eyebrow. "Do you want some tea, Malfoy?" Potter asked him from where he was busy with a kettle.
And then, without any warning, Harry's hand cupped Draco's cock through his trousers, and after a moment of irrational fear and a couple of strokes, Draco was coming in his pants.
"Drink and do continue," Severus said handing Potter two phials of what Draco thought were Blood-Replenishing Potion and Invigoration Draught. "Eat, Draco," the man said turning to him and walking to sit on the other side of the table.
"I asked if you don't mind me joining you?" that perfect voice again. Draco could listen to it forever and never get tired of it, he was sure.
Both Harry and Draco liked it so much, they ended up drinking nearly the whole menu and by the time they were back to their apartment and lying naked on the bed, all they were able to do was some lazy snogging.
Severus coughed a little and when Draco turned to look at him he was looking kind of dazed and his cheeks were slightly pink, it was actually very amusing.
– the bar where Pansy suggested to celebrate his birthday, then decided to never show up – and he was friends with that Ginny girl and the other bartender there.
In the shower Draco was running his hands up and down Harry's wet and soapy torso while Harry was washing Draco's hair, and he couldn't believe how lucky he was that Pansy convinced him to go out for his own birthday this year, and that she chose Harry's bar for this.
"No, I don't think so, your Godfather gave me three phials of this shit already," Potter smiled laying back.
"What do you think?" Harry asked, and when Draco just continued staring at him, he stood up and held out his hand. Draco swallowed nervously and slowly lifted his left hand from his knee then carefully laid it in Harry's waiting palm. Harry just grinned happily, showing his teeth, and pulled Draco up.
Draco gave him a hard glare and walked back to the trunk to place in it all his things he just took from the bathroom.
"Calm down, Ron," Harry interrupted him. "There are enough bathrooms for everyone in this house," he said calmly and gave Draco his cup when he came to him.
Draco nodded and blinked a few times trying to stop his stupid tears. Harry put one of his hands around Draco's waist and drew him closer, kissing his hair just above his ear. Draco closed his eyes.
"Kreacher is so sorry, young Master Black, but Kreacher was told to wake young Master Black up right now and give him this," elf handed him a little piece of parchment. "Young Master Black should call for Kreacher, when he will be ready," and with that elf disappeared leaving Draco in a dark room.
Then Potter came to him and placed a small tube on the bedside table. He was saying something but Draco couldn't catch his words, he was just staring into his green worried eyes helplessly.
Luna had been with them for half an hour maybe, then she said that she was tired and her parents were waiting for her at home.
Harry laughed loudly. "I'm not a dying man here," he said and Draco bit the inside of his cheek to stop himself from pointing out that actually it was exactly what Harry was at that moment. "Draco, do you think you could explain everything to them while I'm gone?" Draco didn't expect that, but he nodded before Harry gave him a smile and walked out.
"Because I fucking know what he's looking for!" Harry shouted, then stood up abruptly and started cleaning the table.
"I've wanted to do this for ages, you have no idea..." he nibbled on Draco's earlobe and Draco shuddered with all his body and moaned again, but then pressed his mouth to Harry's shoulder to keep himself silent. "Don't hold back, baby, I want to hear you," Harry whispered in his ear. "You sound amazing."
"So, are you going to tell me, Potter, what in the Merlin's name does make you think I will enjoy climbing some idiotic hill at six in the morning?" Draco wanted to sound annoyed, but this came out more like a whine.
But now he was here with Draco and Draco was glad about that, though he felt rather irritated himself. He wanted to help Harry so much, but had absolutely no idea how.
"I really need to go now," he said when Potter looked at him. "Thank you for breakfast, Potter, and– thank you," Draco smiled at him feeling nervous and awkward again.
Millie and Theo looked at each other and rolled their eyes at the same time. Draco glared at them and walked a few metres away.
Potter looked at him and gave him one of those breathtaking small smiles of his that made Draco forget about everything for a moment.
Did they know about Draco being in this house? Did they come for him? Fuck. No, Kreacher wouldn't betray him, would he? Draco was half-Black and the elf was absolutely in love with Blacks. Still…
"Harry, I think you should talk to Kreacher, he might know where the locket is," unfortunately Granger was still here too.
"Thank you, but it wasn't really necessary," Draco mumbled, feeling embarrassed that Harry paid for him.
Draco had never seen so much strong emotions on his Godfather's always impassive face. There was mostly shock, but Draco also could see some kind of sadness and even anger in the man's eyes. He didn't understand what was wrong with this situation, but he really did like Potter's attention and he really got used to exchanging notes with him, not that he would ever admit it out loud to anyone, especially not to Severus with his odd reactions on all Potter-related conversations.
"That's the thing," Harry answered him, his voice bitter. "That locket was a fake. It isn't a real Horcrux."
It took him a whole minute and an absolutely astonished expression on Potter's face to realize what he had just said. He called him Harry.
"How are you going to explain them everything?" Severus asked him slowly and quietly and Draco knew he was angry and irritated too. "How do you think they will be reacting on Draco, on me? Do you really think they will believe you? Will believe me or Draco?"
Draco nodded. He took his time to concentrate and to feel his magic again. It was much easier to cast this spell on the cauldron with bubbling potion, but now he needed to stop reactions in whole Harry's body. It would be the most difficult and the most important thing he had ever done in his life, maybe even including the repair of the Vanishing Cabinet.
was in charge of everything – he could touch whenever he wanted and wherever he wanted, he could move in a pace he had set himself. He even went so far as saying Harry not to thrust up, and surprisingly Harry listened to him, though he gave him a rather weird look.
"Indeed, his help was quite decent and thoughtful. I'm not sure you could handle this situation if you were alone... According to his ghoulish elf, Potter left not long after midnight, an hour before I was finally free to come here. So, how are you feeling, Draco?"
When Draco finally opened his eyes he was greeted with the sight of smugly grinning Potter, who was still hovering above him.
There was another minute of silence and Draco thought that he got more questions than answers out of Severus' story. But he didn't dare to ask anything.
So he walked with Harry to the kitchen counter and was watching him while he was cooking. The situation was the opposite from the one in Draco's lab, and now Draco understand the urge to help even when you had no idea how.
Draco watched him with a smile he wasn't aware of until he started to feel a light ache in his cheeks.
"It's none of your business, Weasley," Draco drawled, enjoying the expression on the redhead's face. He looked like he was about to be sick any moment now.
Weasley immediately scowled at him leaning back in the chair he was sitting on, and Harry grinned at him from the kitchen counter when he was making tea. Granger didn't even bother to look up from the book she was reading.
"You can tell me if it's not okay or if you're not ready, but I was thinking that I need to meet your parents. I'm taking you to the Italy, babe, you know, it's rather serious stuff."
Harry didn't answer, he just wrapped his perfect lips around the head of Draco's cock. Draco cried out loudly and buried his hands in Harry's hair.
Weasley and Granger chose this moment to enter the room. They both glanced strangely in their direction but didn't say anything.
"I don't know," Potter stopped in a doorway. "I think I should come sometimes, for food and for news from Snape. He will be here often enough, so..."
"Don't flatter yourself too much, Potter," Draco said, but he couldn't stop himself from smiling again.
"How could I not, Draco? You're the best and the most incredible and breathtakingly beautiful person I've ever known."
"She was saying something about elves' heads on the staircase, but I'm glad to know it was just her childhood imagination."
"Books about Horcruxes? But what information he can possibly look for if not how to destroy them? Harry?"
Somehow, it happened that he and Harry didn't really talk about their families. But Draco thought that introduction was in order now, but he had no idea how to tell it to Harry and if Harry even would be okay with it.
The next moment he became aware of the fact that Potter wasn't screaming anymore and glanced at his direction. Potter was trying to sit up while his stupid elf was standing next to him muttering something again. But Potter waved him away, his green eyes running over the kitchen.
"We were able to repel the attack and all Weasleys are in a safe house now. But someone got me with this stupid cutting spell while I was helping Ginny to get Gabrielle – Fleur's sister – and one of Fleur's little cousins out of falling tent."
"It's, er, your breakfast," Potter said and stepped away from Draco a little awkwardly. "If you want," he added.
"What?" Severus stared at him strangely then scowled. "What in the name of Merlin did you do to convince Potter to tell you about Horcruxes, Draco?"
And how in hell did Draco manage to not see these lips yet? They were slightly red and so full... Draco had to shake his head to not get lost in his thoughts again.
Yes, with his exams finished a couple of weeks ago, they had much more time to spend together and Draco practically was living in Harry's flat by now.
There were a couple of bars on the small part of San Polo where they were renting their apartment, and they decided to go to one of them instead of a restaurant.
Oh God, he hadn't realized how much he really needed this after all the stress he went through in the last week because of his final exam.
Potter gestured with his head to a bed in the corner of the room near the window. Draco sighed and walked to a bed to an opposite wall. He sat down on it and looked at stupidly grinning Potter.
They spent about two hours in the lab. Harry was asking thousands questions about every Draco's move and kept making attempts to help him, so Draco had to ask him to do some small tasks, like bringing him something or cutting or grinding some ingredients for him, and surprisingly they made a very good team together and finished the potion earlier than Draco was expecting.
The pattern appeared to be some sort of signature that looked vaguely familiar to Draco when he watched more closely. He slowly traced it with the tip of his index finger.
"Kreacher's Master was saying that if young Master Black will agree, Kreacher must be bringing him to Kreacher's Master for a little walk. And if young Master Black hasn't had his breakfast yet, Kreacher should pack some toasts while young Master Black will be getting ready."
Harry told him to climb off the bike, then helped him to take off the helmet. Draco hurriedly ran his hands through his hair to make sure it was alright. Yes, he wasn't a teenage girl, but it didn't mean that his hair shouldn't always look good.
But Draco was looking only at Harry, who looked a little shy with slightly flushed cheeks and sheepish smile. He moved his gaze on Draco again and his smile became warm and gentle. He caressed down Draco's cheek with his fingertips slowly.
Severus wiped his hands and started to get potions phials from his countless robe pockets, while Potter stood up, walked to the kitchen counter and started to make sandwiches with ham and cheese.
Harry's hands were on Draco's ass and he was thrusting his hips up from time to time, sliding his hard cock between Draco's ass-cheeks.
out loud to anyone except his mother, to be honest – but he knew what he felt. He knew he loved Harry. He realized that long ago, and it felt like he had loved him since forever, but he wasn't able to say that to him. He didn't know why; it wasn't like he was afraid of rejection (well, maybe just a little), and he truly thought that Harry deserved all the love in the world, it was just that words didn't come out every time he tried.
"You remember that perfectly clear, Potter," Draco grinned taking a spoon from still adorably smiling Potter, who then conjured two big cups and was filling them with hot steaming tea from that strange cylinder.
"And you didn't tell me?" Potter shouted and made an attempt to stand on his feet, but Severus' hand on his shoulder made him wince and sit back.
"Yes, young Master Black, Mister Snape is in the house at this moment. Kreacher did not know if it was appropriate to say Mister Snape about the breakfast his Half-blood Master made for young Master Black, so Kreacher said that young Master Black is sleeping in his bedroom now."
"I can give you an Unbreakable Vow that I will do all I can to help Harry and that I'm not going to hurt him. Or you."
"Oh, of course you're bloody sorry, fucking hell!" Draco laid his hand on Potter's arm and he abruptly stopped his shouting, looking back at Draco.
And Draco simply decided to give up and not trying to make any sense out of this entire situation. He took another sandwich, leaned back in his chair and looked over to Potter's angry face.
He still couldn't fully believe that it was actually happening, that he and Harry were actually going to Italy together, and he was on edge the whole day. He was very excited and nervous at the same time, was anxious to not forget to pack anything, and every time he thought about upcoming dinner at his parents' house he was overwhelmed with an idiotic fear.
Draco didn't think this gorgeous man in front of him could ever be described as 'adorable', but the pink color on his tanned cheeks made him look really cute.
Potter was so close, Draco could feel the smell of woods and a rain coming from him, and he was trying very hard not to lose himself in the feelings of this smell and Potter's touch.
"It is not an order Kreacher, it is just a favor," Draco pleaded all the Ancient Gods it would work. "You are doing a favor for me now and then I will do a favor for you someday if you will be needing something." Elf's eyes grew impossibly wide. "Can you do it for me, Kreacher? Please?" Draco didn't think it was possible but Kreacher's eyes became even wider, then he nodded a few times and disappeared.
Draco smirked and leaned a little forward. Harry's smile grew wider while he moved his hand closer to Draco. Draco thought Harry's eyes became even greener when he watched Draco leaning some more and taking a pie from the fork he was holding.
"Snape! Good to see you," Potter greeted Draco's Godfather cheerfully when he appeared in the middle of the kitchen grinning sheepishly at them. "Malfoy," he nodded to Draco. "So how you guys have been doing?"
"Of course I love you, baby," Harry said softly, smiling and hugging Draco close. "Were you doubting it?" he asked, brushing Draco's hair from his forehead.
How Potter had even managed to survive that long with such friends Draco had absolutely no idea. If these two were bickering like that while Harry was bleeding and screaming, laying in the same bed they were sitting on, Draco couldn't even imagine what they were like while Harry was conscious and not in pain.
"Come on, I think he's in the kitchen," Potter started walking out of the room too and Draco followed him.
"Mother?" Draco blinked stupidly. "Will she go with us? And what about father? And will you finally tell me where are we going and why?"
The next step in his usual routine would be reading some book in his bed before sleep, but he didn't want to go to that room, the old room of Regulus Black that for some weird reasons reminded him so much of his own, back at the Manor.
Draco didn't listen to him. He stared at Harry's neck in horrified shock, he didn't bother to hide or wipe the tears when they started falling down his cheeks.
Harry sat up on the bed next to him. "It's okay, Hermione, Draco's helping me," he said smiling softly at her.
Severus stayed with him almost all afternoon. He told Draco what would be going on at Hogwarts in the upcoming school year, and this news made Draco feel grateful to both Potter and Severus again for taking him out of it.
Potter fell back on a floor and was still screaming like under Cruciatus; his elf was still trying to say something to him. Draco stood up and went to take a potion, thinking how for the name of Merlin he would be able to make Potter drink it, and suddenly his left forearm felt like a thousand needles were stuck in it and like it was on fire at the same time.
"What is it?" he asked when his gaze fell on the blanket and he saw a plate and some strange silver cylinder on it.
"We will need two bartenders, so there wouldn't be any queues. Also we won't need all the kitchen crew, maybe just two or three of them? Can you take care of it? And tell Dudley he's free from lunch till eight, okay?"
Draco blushed like an idiot and kissed that stupid smirk off Harry's lips, pressing his body into Harry's as much as possible, drowning in the sensations of Harry's lips and hands on him.
"I'll make us some more tea," she said walking to the kitchen counter. "It will be very long and not very light conversation."
It was Ron, one of Harry's close friends, who invited himself in for a late Monday lunch at Harry's place and was now looking at them in mocking shock.
Draco didn't have to be told twice, and he launched himself on Harry, straddling his waist and touching, kissing, licking and biting absolutely everywhere he was able to reach.
He took the locket in his hand again... If he would squint enough he might imagine that there was a capital "B" surrounded by tiny silver snakes. "B" with the snakes around it. He totally had seen something like that, but– Wait! He looked at the note again.
Harry stilled after a moment too, his face buried in Draco's neck and both of his hands squeezing Draco's ass.
Almost two hours flew by and Draco was even a little disappointed to step on the solid ground again.
Harry kissed him hard at the mouth then, swallowing his moans and touching him everywhere, making Draco feel the most delicious kind of dizziness.
"I can't really believe it, Harry," Draco breath out. "And of course I like it, nobody ever did something like this for me," he blushed.
"Well, you don't know a lot of things about me, Malfoy," Harry drawled, clearly trying to imitate Draco's voice.
Thankfully Harry wasn't gone long enough for Draco to start really panicking, but he was still very worried.
"You need to go," Potter said softly. He looked at Draco with one of these breathtaking expressions on his face again. He stepped closer and laid his free hand on Draco's waist a little hesitantly and looked into his eyes.
Then he went back to his room and was reading a book about Ancient Runes and their role in some blood rituals, when Severus appeared in the doorway a few hours later.
Harry's friends weren't looking more convincing after his words and it took them whole three fucking minutes and multiple annoyed glares from Severus to finally leave the room.
This morning when Draco woke up, after finally falling asleep around dawn, he didn't find his usual basket of berries on his nightstand, but there was a note.
Potter said his family didn't like him much and didn't like magic, but Draco was sure there was so much more than that.
Once they were up, Potter started making a fuss of spreading a blanket under the shadow of the big tree while Draco stood near the edge of a bank and watched the forest and hills in front of him. He had never thought he could appreciate the beauty of wild nature, but after a month and a week in a dark and dusty creepy house, he really found the view appealing enough.
Draco was so overwhelmed with his feelings and emotions, he was able to finally fall asleep much later after Harry's hand in his hair stilled and Harry's snores filled the room.
"Hey!" Draco heard Millie's voice. "Why the fuck did you stop? Keep going, I'm on my way to having the orgasm of my life!"
"Hey! It was me who was brewing this shit, you, ungrateful oaf!" Draco raised himself on his elbow and smacked Potter's shoulder with his free hand.
When they came to the kitchen Draco suggested calling for Potter while he was still not with his friends so Severus could tell him all the news too. The man just glared at him and didn't answer, but yet, when Severus started to prepare coffee for himself, he called Kreacher and ordered him to go and get his 'stupid Master'.
He really couldn't believe it. Harry planned a trip for them for Draco's (that was nearly two months ago) and his own (that would be in a few days) birthdays.
Draco quickly looked around. It was a dark – despite three large windows – and dusty-smelling drawing room with pretentious ornate old furniture and a tapestry all over one of the walls.
Draco read what happened to be an address and then watched how an old massive gloomy house was slowly appearing between two muggle ones.
instead?" he heard Potter said in a soft voice. "I really don't think so, Malfoy. You're safe here. And you're here because many people want you to be safe and as far away from him as possible. This is a Black Family house, as you already know, so it's not only Fidelius Charms that protects you from him. It's Blood Magic. Your mother helped to find one ancient ritual, and Snape and I did it a few days ago, the night I turned seventeen. Last night I finished it, so this house protects you even more than it protects me. And... if you're worried about your mum–" Draco held a breath, "Don't be, she's not in the country and she's safe too." Draco breathed out with relief and tried to hold back his tears. "Snape doesn't want me to tell you any of this, but I know too well what it's like when you don't have a fucking clue what the hell is going on around you."
him, Granger, and then you two can fuck off doing your stupid brawling somewhere else!" Draco shouted as loudly as he could.
The helmet was new, Harry bought it specially for Draco, and Draco loved it. It was black too, like Harry's, but it had a painting of curled up Chinese dragon in green and silver on the back of it.
"It's going to be alright, babe," he muttered turning his face into Draco's neck and kissing him here lightly.
"Leave him, Corner," Millie, one of the friends Draco made here, answered before he had a chance. "I bet he already has plans with his hot, older boyfriend," she smirked, winking at Draco.
Draco didn't know why he was crying like this. He knew he was scared for Harry, really scared. And it seemed like it was the first time he actually realized it, and it scared him too.
"Stop calling him bloody 'Draco', for fuck's sake!" Draco startled at the shouting in Weasel's voice. "Do you even realize how fucking creepy you're sounding?"
"Er– yeah, it supposed to be a Hungarian Horntail in fact," Potter said smiling sheepishly. "Mrs. Weasley made it for me on Christmas in our fourth year, after–"
Draco watched how Severus stood up from his chair and came to Potter. He made him sit on one of the chairs and take his robe off, and then he was waving his wand over all of Potter's body, murmuring some diagnostic and healing spells.
"You're good at Healing, aren't you?" Weasley's question startled Granger as well as Draco. "Aren't you, Malfoy?" he repeated impatiently when Draco remained silent.
He half-crawled to the kitchen counter and reached for the last cabinet's door trying very hard not to cry too loudly. He took a small purple phial and knocked its contents into his mouth with a quick movement of his hand. He immediately felt much better, though he still could feel the burning in his Dark Mark.
"Kreacher's Half-blood Master gave Kreacher an order to prepare every meal for young Master Black as well as to clean after him," elf said somehow proudly.
Harry didn't say anything else, and was just holding Draco close to himself with his nose buried in Draco's fair hair.
He was having nightmares again. His Sleeping drought was over a few days ago and he didn't have ingredients for the new brewing. The peppermint tea gave him a little comfort, but Potter's Gryffindor t-shirt didn't smell like Potter anymore and he couldn't made himself relax enough to fall asleep without potion and Potter's scent surrounding him.
Harry had the keys for this place, so after Luna left, they stayed and continued talking and eating the already melted cake.
Damned fucking elf. Draco closed his eyes, he was sure his face was redder than Potter's Gryffindor t-shirt that Draco used to sleep in. He took a deep breath, opened his eyes and carefully looked at Potter, who by the way still didn't 'take his hands off' him.
Draco tensed a little at first, but then he quickly forgot all of his thoughts and melted into Harry's firm and already so familiar body. He signed with relief and wrapped his arms around Harry's neck, kissing him back.
But the most incredible part was the feeling of Harry's strong muscular body beneath his hands, of course. Harry was wearing only a thin t-shirt now and Draco wanted to whimper helplessly every time Harry's muscles flexed under his palms.
And Harry was such a careful driver. He wasn't actually driving that fast and always slowed down when he was making a turn. He didn't do any crazy maneuvers, and once when they were waiting at the red light, he stroked Draco's thigh asking if he was okay.
If it wasn't for Weasley's and Granger's presence at the other side of the table, Draco definitely would be weeping into Harry's chest like a small child.
"Well, I haven't actually slept here since–" he cut himself and stared at his hands on his lap. "I wasn't here in summer after– after out fifth year, but when I've stayed here this summer, I slept in Sirius' old room."
Draco's phone rang loudly right at that moment. He took it from his pocket and laid it on the coffee table in front of them when he saw who was calling.
Potter talked about Sirius Black a lot actually. Draco thought he had never talked about him with anyone since the man's death and he hoped Potter felt better now, finally allowing himself to let go a little.
"Oi! Get a room already, you two!" Weasley shouted and Harry laughed. "But give me my food first," he added and Harry laughed louder.
"Granger, do you know the spell that can stop the blood?" he looked at her and was surprised to see she had already placed all the potions from some little handbag on the bedside table. He quickly drank the phial of Pain-Relieving potion to not let the pain in his Mark prevent him from thinking properly.
It was Harry who said that. And he said that so casually, like it wasn't a problem that was eating Draco's mind for the last fifteen minutes.
This time Draco actually laughed despite being very nervous and uncomfortable. He ignored Severus' burning glare and walked to sit on his bed still laughing.
"We've been thinking," Theo started talking, using his business voice, and Draco rolled his eyes at him
And this was another reason – Potter was always trying to touch him. He always held out his hand to Draco when they were climbing a hill or stepping over lying tree trunk or crossing some tiny river, and he didn't let go right away. When Draco had stumbled sometimes, Potter always steadied him with his big hand on Draco's arm or around Draco's shoulders.
"What are you doing so far away from me, babe?" he heard Harry's sleepy hoarse voice. "Come back here," he patted the space on the bed next to him.
, waving her hands weirdly, but Harry smiled at her too, and after a few moments joined in the singing.
"You are, Draco," Harry kissed his temple. "You helped us with the locket, remember? And now you're here with me. It makes me feel not too useless myself."
"Um, my friends decided to abandon me on my own birthday, apparently," Draco answered him before he could really think about it. And why did he say it like that? Now Harry would think that Draco was just a pathetic loser who wasn't worthy of his time.
Harry sat Granger's and Weasley's cups in front of them and seated himself next to Draco. They ate in silence but it wasn't awkward or uncomfortable even despite Weasel's glares and Granger's weird glances.
He closed his eyes and lay carefully on the bed between the wall and Harry, nuzzling his nose to Harry's shoulder and keeping his hand on Harry's chest.
"She is not. And you better don't know anything about her whereabouts as well as she won't know anything about yours. It will be more save for both of you."
Draco laughed when Harry cursed and removed his other hand from Draco's ass to help himself. Draco leaned back on his hands and bit his lip, watching Harry fumbling with the buttons.
that you own, right, Harry?" Sue Li, the Asian girl that Draco didn't really know well, asked, tossing back her long black hair. "I've been there once with my cousin, I liked it so much."
Both of Harry's hands were on Draco's waist now and Draco realized that his own hands had moved on Harry's shoulders and were clutching them tightly.
Severus came to him and was rubbing his shoulders gently. "And I have to tell him, you know I do," the man said softly. "I will be bringing Death Eaters into the square in front of the house tonight."
eating our lunch, Ronald," Draco said smirking, watching Ron blushing and Harry laughing. "Or tell your friend not to engage in such activities when we're around other people," this time Harry blushed slightly while Ron was smiling at his plate.
But Harry was laughing, actually laughing, throwing his head back and putting an arm over his eyes while his other hand continued squeezing Draco's thigh. And Draco couldn't help himself, he smiled. Because it was impossible to look at Harry and didn't smile.
"Yes!" Granger screeched. "Where might it be now?" she asked in her normal voice again, frowning on the floor.
Severus was staring at them. Not just staring, but nearly gawking at them with wide eyes and unnervingly weird expression on his face. Just how in hell had Draco forgotten about his Godfather being here?
"FILTH! SCUM! STAINS OF DISHONOUR, BY-PRODUCTS OF DIRT AND VILENESS! HOW DARE YOU BEFOUL THE HOUSE OF MY FATHERS–"
"I asked you a question, Malfoy," apparently Weasley wasn't the one with the patience. Not that this was news for Draco, he just hoped Harry's friends were exhausted enough to leave him alone.
What Draco wasn't expected in the slightest was both of his parents' reaction to Harry's last name. They both stilled and held their breaths looking at Harry strangely.
"No," Potter answered and next second he was walking quickly to a dresser on the other side of the window. He was searching for something there as Granger's silver otter appeared again.
Harry murmured quiet "thanks" when Severus placed the tray with dinner on his lap. Draco tried not to feel irritated, angry and hurt from the fact that Severus stole this tray and Harry's "thanks" from him.
Later, when Harry returned to the kitchen and they finished their lunch and snogged a little against the kitchen counter, Draco was gathering his thoughts to try to approach the subject while Harry was doing the dishes.
"He's a bit dramatic sometimes, don't you think?" Potter asked looking at Draco with a nice smirk on his lips.
"I'm going to lose all of my control if we won't stop right now," he said. "You're so fucking hot, Malfoy," he growled in Draco's ear, nuzzling his nose in Draco's hair and squeezing Draco's hips.
"It's a portrait of Walburga Black, she was your mother's aunt or something like that," Potter answered him and started walking up the stairs.
"I can't– Draco– Ron and Herm–" he grasped Draco's hand in his and was trying to sit up, but then froze when he saw his friends standing near the bed. "What's going on?" he half whispered.
"Hermione apparated us in some woods, we were walking and talking, and then they appeared out of nowhere, Death Eaters. I really have no idea how they found us... It was four of them and they've gone absolutely mad when they realized it was us. And that was a real fight... We were trying not to let them to summon their fucking Master and they– they were trying to– to kill Hermione," Potter closed his eyes and take a deep breath.
"Don't say I do not trust you, 'Mione, you know perfectly well that it's not true," Harry interrupted her, leaning on her shoulder for support. "You're tired and exhausted and Malfoy's very good at Healing. It'll be alright, I promise," he tried to smile at her.
Draco was sure he was blushing; he stroked fingers of Harry's hand on his thigh and smiled at him too, trying to ignore the stares of everyone in this room.
Draco made Potter tell him everything about his adventures at Hogwarts, especially about Chamber of Secrets in their second year.
"I do," she said and exchanged a glance with Weasley before leaning over Harry and muttering a spell.
" on the table in front of Draco. Draco took it and gasped. Potter leaned to him to look at it too. Large photo of angry Potter was staring at them from the front page with big letters on the top of it just above the photo: "
"Twenty first," Draco smiled sadly. Maybe if he'd try to look sad enough Harry wouldn't leave him for a while?
Harry seated Draco on one of the stools at the bar. And while he busied himself with making drinks for them, Draco took his time to look around. It was small, but a very nice, cozy café with small round tables and a lot of plants and flowers everywhere. It looked like the walls were painted in pale yellow and white; it must be very bright during the day, he really liked it.
"Fucking finally! The– it's still fucking here, Snape!" Harry shouted. "I still can see– I saw– Fuck! Did you fucking have to give me a fucking hope?"
He cursed himself when he realized that he didn't give Harry any potions. He sat up on the bed and helped Harry to drink a Pain-Relieving potion, seeing that Granger already gave him the Blood-Replenishing judging by two empty phials that were standing on his bedside table.
The rest of their evening went rather uneventful, except for the fact that Draco's mother embarrassed him by showing his childhood photos to Harry, while he was busy telling his father about his exams. But the photos made Harry laugh, so Draco let his mum get away with it.
Sometimes it was more than two notes a day, but sometimes it was just berries. It had been blackberries, raspberries, even gooseberries once, but mostly Potter was sending blueberries because Draco once wrote him that he liked them the most.
"For the name of Merlin, Draco! I told you just to pack the essentials, there is no time for your girlish habits!" he heard Severus' voice from the doorway.
"Try to rest, guys," Harry was saying to his friends. "Draco will cast the spells and then Severus will fix me and we'll have dinner together and I'll tell you everything. Now I feel like I'm about to pass out. It's burning everywhere."
"Are you actually living in the tent with Granger and Weasley?" Draco asked him in amused voice when the elf disappeared with a crack.
On his twelfth day in the house Draco found an old potion laboratory in the cellar. With some help from Kreacher and even Severus he cleaned it up enough for being able to brew in it. So his days became less boring while he was busy making potions Severus brought him ingredients for.
Draco lifted his head to look up at Harry, who was looking right back at him. Draco wanted to ask what did that mean and did that even mean anything and would Harry like to kiss him again. But he couldn't speak.
He noticed Weasley was grasping Harry's neck tightly but it didn't stop blood from pouring out of it.
Draco talked a lot about Pansy and how much friendship with her helped him through the years. Pansy had a real talent to calm him down and to help him to sort out his thoughts. He told Potter how much her simple chattering and staying out of his business helped him to go through last year without losing his mind. He also told Potter a little how they were growing up together and that Pansy was like a sister he always wanted but never had.
"You're the most beautiful person I've ever seen, Draco," Harry whispered and pulled Draco's trousers and underwear down a bit at the same time.
Draco suddenly realized that he needed to tell his parents that he would be out of the country, but he still hadn't really told them about Harry.
He hadn't seen Potter almost in a month. Last time Potter was here, he came with a bright red pyjama t-shirt late in the night when Severus had shown a place to Death Eaters.
Draco turned around and hugged him, pressing his face to the nice material of Harry's new shirt. It was a black button up, and Harry was looking absolutely divine in it and his black trousers, and it took almost all of Draco's self-control not to jump him right then and there.
Draco looked up and saw Severus standing in a doorway with a very strange expression on his grim face.
Harry was also expected Severus to show up and was getting nervous (though he was trying to hide it) about the fact he still didn't come with the mysterious news he had promised to him.
"Let's get you to your room," Potter stroked some hair from Draco's face, it felt awfully nice. "So you could rest or maybe even sleep. I'm sorry I woke you up that early, but I think the sunrise was worth it, wasn't it?" he smiled at Draco. Suddenly there was a wet flannel in his hand and he was wiping Draco's face with it carefully.
Sometimes they talked about Hogwarts too, about their professors and lessons, and about Quidditch and their favorite teams and players. Potter couldn't believe him that Arithmancy was really his favorite subject and Draco had difficult time believing someone really might voluntarily support Chudley Cannons.
The man lifted his gaze from an old book he was reading and looked at Draco intently. "How are you feeling?" he asked.
Draco went after the man and sat on his usual spot at the table, placing the basket in front of himself. A plate with fresh scones and a large cup of peppermint tea appeared next to it next moment.
Draco heard the noise from the kitchen while he was reading in the dawning room, but when he finally decided to check what was going on, there was only angrily pacing Granger in here.
Harry liked the idea, but Draco was anxious about letting him out of the house even under his Cloak, when Death Eaters were still around. But he couldn't object much after Granger handed Harry a phial of Polyjuice Potion with a hair of some old muggle man, as she said.
"I take it you managed to escape?" Severus asked in a very soft voice which was very unusual for him. Draco turned to look at him; he was watching Potter very intently too.
"Sorry it took me so long, but I was so angry and irritated with Snape and it just caught me off guard. And he managed to feel me, so he just–"
Draco told him about the locket, the note in it, but Severus knew that already. So Draco told him how he guessed about Regulus, trying (but most possibly failing) not to be so smug about the fact that he was able to help where Severus wasn't. But his Godfather was too shocked by the Kreacher's story about Regulus' death to pay attention to anything else.
Draco didn't know how long they were kissing against the kitchen door, but it was long enough for him to became brave enough to slide his hands under Harry's t-shirt and carefully stroke the hot bare skin of his muscular back. It made Harry make a beautiful noise, something between moan and growl that came straight to Draco's already hard cock.
"Dark Lord is perfectly aware of the fact that I had an access to this place once. And he is also aware that the place belongs to you now, Bella was ranting about it quite a lot last summer. He is searching for you, Harry, and he expects you to hide in here." Severus was saying and Potter groaned again and laid his hands on the table then laid his head on his hands.
After the breakfast Draco spent some time in his lab, checking on a draught of Peace that he started brewing yesterday morning when Potter sent him a bunch of hellebores.
"But maybe that'll be alright," Harry whispered against Draco's slightly panting mouth, then covered it with his own.
Draco walked to the far wall of the kitchen where was a door leading to the small dark hall with a few rooms – one of which was his potions lab – and a staircase to the cellars.
And now was the moment when he wanted to say them the most, but his throat didn't seem to work properly.
"It's nearly midnight and your birthday would be over soon, and unfortunately I don't have a present for you," Harry said, leaning closer to Draco. "But I really want to give you one."
Also he was worried about his father, almost as much as he was worried for Harry, but he knew it wasn't right, his father was a Death Eater, Draco shouldn't be worried for him. But he couldn't stop and he hated himself for this.
Instead he shifted a little on Harry's lap and started kissing his neck and jaw. Harry's head fell back on the sofa and his hands squeezed Draco's hips, pulling him closer and urging him to straddle his lap. Draco obeyed happily, and moaned loudly when Harry tugged at his hair pulling his head to the side and sucking the skin of his neck into his mouth.
"That's a good boy," Harry murmured with a smile and carefully put the helmet on Draco's head, then zipped up his jacket and got on the bike.
He heard Harry calling his name and then three pairs of footsteps were following him up the stairs on the second floor and into the first room to the right.
"It's a pleasure to finally meet you too, sir," Harry smiled politely at Draco's farther, shaking hands with him. "I'm Harry. Harry Potter."
"Potter was saying that Dark Lord told to my father he's going to torture me to death through my Mark. Can he really do this?" Draco asked nervously, watching Severus who was carefully wiping his arm with a wet clean towel. Draco's Dark Mark looked bright red against his slightly pink burned skin.
"Draco let Death Eaters into Hogwarts and I am the one who killed Albus Dumbledore and they are very aware of it, if you have forgotten these simple facts."
"Yeah, she's here quite often. And I'm sure there's something going on between her and Gin," Harry grinned again.
On his fifteenth day here Draco woke up to a little basket of fresh wild blackberries and a piece of parchment on his bedside table.
"Remove the Stasis," Severus ordered rudely. Draco noticed he was clutching a small phial in his hand.
Draco wanted to come to him but Weasley managed to shove him away though one of his hands was still pressed to Harry's neck who was now squirming on the bed. Draco glared at freckled git with irritation.
"Harry, why didn't you tell anything?" Granger continued her interrogation, looming above them. "This is serious, Harry. There was a reason Professor Dumbledore wanted you to learn how to block th–"
The elf bowed, muttering something about his Master Regulus and old dear Mistress, and then busied himself at the kitchen counter.
"He was going to torture you through your Mark," he glanced at Draco's left arm. "Didn't you feel something?"
Draco ignored the idiots and draped his arms around Harry's neck. Harry cupped Draco's cheek in his big palm and was smiling at him sweetly, Draco just stared back and was blushing of course, but he ignored that too.
Draco thought Weasley's face must be a rather comical sight right now but he didn't want to look away from Harry's, who was still motionless and almost breathless and frighteningly cold.
But suddenly Kreacher appeared in the middle of the lab, saying that dinner was ready and that they should hurry to the kitchen "or that barbaric Weasley boy will eat absolutely everything".
Harry smiled at him too, cupped his face and kissed him so softly, Draco felt himself melting in his arms.
Well, his mother knew that he was dating someone and Draco thought his father suspected that too. And he never told them, but he thought they both were well aware that it wasn't a girl.
This is the first serious thing I've ever written, and English is not my native language, so I'm sorry for any mistakes!
"I'm okay, baby, just lie there and be pretty," Harry answered breathlessly and started stroking himself.
"Thanks," Potter looked at him too. "It's your name down there," he said tilting his head in the direction. "Thought you might like to see," and he turned back to look at the window.
Severus cast an impressively strong Disillusionment Charms on both of them before they went through the main doors and almost ran down the path to the big iron gates. Draco couldn't stop worrying about his mother, but Severus once again assured him that she wasn't and wouldn't be in any danger.
He walked up the stairs and paused on the second floor on the sound of the voices from the dawning room, but it was unlikely that Gryffindors might want him to be there with them, even though he knew all their secrets now. Of course it was unlikely too, that they actually had told him
