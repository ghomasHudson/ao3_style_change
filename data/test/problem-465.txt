In the end, Harry could still only attend as Charlie’s teammate—his apprentice Flyer, his stable wizard, or as Malfoy had kindly put: the appendix of the team.
“P-haps not,” he said, still not meeting Harry’s eyes. “Sorry. I’ll–erm–catch up with you at lunch.”
Atop Hagrid’s Hut, the stone chimney is a cold loose fist waiting to catch a falling sun. Harry glances around, at the evening fields with stale breath, at a brown stretch of bentgrass, whose knees were fractured bearing Malfoy's empty weight, unmoving, a shaky reality Harry will soon unload from the fixed past.
“Let’s walk,” Draco told him, after landing gracefully upon the shimmering finish line on the hardened snow. There were no other teams in plain view. Harry felt a thunderous thrill whenever Draco thrusted his presence into Harry like that, ad lib, knowing his voice would resonate with every cell within Harry’s body then leave them swaying like a drunk, swollen and vulnerable.
“You have to … quick, you have to promise ...” said the young man again, still holding on to the unstable flux of his existence.
The last thing Harry registered before strong-arming his way through the Anti-Apparition barricades was the piercing
He wondered if Harry ever felt good like this, helping people and feeling grand, but that twit was probably too noble to allow himself any ulterior joy from his charity acts.
“Dragon Animagi were the first group of people who tried to protect the dragons from the blood sports of their fellow wizards.” Harry came over to the brook, shoulder to shoulder with Draco. They were roughly of the same height. “They set up wards around their habitats, making those locations unplottable to wizards but visible to all dragons who wished to seek refuge.”
Around him, flashes of spells sopped up little sparks of Yulia’s Dragonfyre as they tore their way across the powdery air. Harry—Yulia—could smell them, coarse and acrid as they ricocheted off Charlie’s Protego. Underlying the burnt, fuzzed out noise and the gritty wind, was a vaguely familiar hint of … something …
“Nothing.” Harry crouches down too; smoothes the flat of his palm along Draco’s bicep; then down, to fondle a knobbly elbow. “Ruin my missions. Poke holes all over my wards. Infest my dreams and prayers with your name. Whatever you want.”
“Oh, finally coming full circle now, are we?” Draco splayed his hands out. A few feet away, water ran in a thin white sheet that was still choppy. Draco stopped at the damp lumpy edge of it and turned to face Harry. “Well if it’s a myth, why do the other dragons hate us? Or was it just me.”
Their journey from the Apparition Gate to the Shaman’s hut was a short but bumpy one. They had to ride double with Malfoy perching awkwardly on the pillion. Somehow, all other available mounts had refused to come anywhere near them. One of the unfriendly Bicorns even attempted to gore Harry the instant he edged a bit nearer.
“I’m not trying to guilt you into anything,” the Shaman said. “On the contrary, I’m telling you not to. This relationship will be yours as much as it will be Draco’s. You don’t have to feel obliged to pile everything upon your shoulders just because Draco isn’t the sole focus of your life.”
It wasn’t because Harry didn’t believe in Draco and his ability to complete the task on his own—he did; Draco was as much a survivor as Harry. But there had been alarm bells blaring at the back of his mind ever since they left the forest clearing, when Draco had suddenly declared the need to retrieve a dragon heart.
Charlie came out of the Station, followed closely by Harry, who had the defiant look of a child who’d just won a fight. Under the sun, Charlie’s hair was a heavy copper, almost as weighty as Yulia’s gunmetal grey. There was a seasoned confidence rolling off Charlie’s shoulders when he walked, a fierce fortitude.
“You know he’s alright.” Harry was almost tempted to take another drag off the cig. Just to retain that feeling of hope in his body a while longer. To catch another glimpse of heaven, the valley wind, ripe grapes and herbs—things that simultaneously reminded him of Romania and a life he dreamt about.
Farther in the garden, there were wild apple trees, fruiting. As Harry strolled forward, the warm smell of autumn then vapourised, the air soon dampened by cold drifts of rain. A flurry of snowflakes dusted lightly over some frosted branches, teased the plum blossoms. Here, it was winter. Under the overarching white, Harry stood at the light brush on the edge of the orchard, tried to discern the Season Charms woven into the wards, but detected none. Strange.
The Shaman ignored his pathetic attempt at acting all breezy. She said tersely, “There are ways to test, but I do not recommend doing so. It is not the point, especially when all you want is to move on, Draco.”
As they walked, an archway revealed itself before them. It loomed black and stony upon the spired mountain top, and was rather similar to the one at the Department of Mysteries. “Just like that,” Harry said, flinging the heavy parcel through the black rippling Veil. Without a noise, it disappeared into the void.
“Can we get you anything?” Draco asked as he covertly slid the hard wood of his wand smoothly into his grip. “Water, perhaps? Hangover Tonic? Or something from the farmer’s market?”
It was such a shame that Malfoy had been in the thick of the mystery, because Harry genuinely thought they were tolerating one another like never before, like two old mismatched shoes managing to look alike simply because time had worn them shapeless, and thick dust had exhausted their colour into oblivion.
But Draco has already whipped them away, and they soon emerge on the other side—thankfully, in one piece, if a little shaken by the rough, soul-crashing push and shove of the vacuum.
Harry returned a wry smile. “Of course Charlie was overreacting, but I was … I was raised in a cupboard, you see; my aunt and uncle treated me no better than a servant, and they often hit me. It was unfair of me to be angry at Bill, at Mrs Weasley … they were the ones that took me in, after all. But Charlie’s anger … ”
“A heart-size conundrum,” Draco sang, unravelling the tied knot of the piece of cloth with a neat flick of his wand. A dragon’s heart sat there, still and lifeless. Draco placed it on the wool rug before the Shaman.
After their Station landed squarely upon the wizarding airstrip by Lake Issyk-Kul, Harry had filed a request to leave the campsite. He wanted to pay a visit to the Shaman’s hut; Malfoy wanted to tag along.
He took his time, pondering aimlessly on things—something he hadn’t been able to do for a while. He wondered about the collective hatred towards Animagi within the dragon community. He wondered why the same level of hatred wasn’t directed towards wizardkind in general. In fact, dragon-wizard bonding was prevalent nowadays, and then there was this dragon race.
Maybe they could break the cycle. Maybe they were walking into yet another recurring nightmare, at the cruel whims of the Gods, unawares. Draco didn’t know, but Harry was right here and nothing else seemed to matter as much.
“You can’t now, perhaps.” Her gaze pierced directly through Malfoy’s eyes. “But one day, you might find yourself in a position of needing a new one. Be prepared for that. Equip yourself so that you will be able to evolve when push comes to shove.”
But—Harry was struck by a wild flash of shock. Draco was lovely, he thought, like this. And it was the very first time he found Draco other than … just, Malfoy, even though he’d quitted calling him that for a while.
“But it—” Draco was worrying his lips with his teeth. “But neither of us remembers anything. What’s the point?”
“It’s not like we can tell them there are werewolves around, and one of them might or might not have been terrorising the poor horses during full moon,” Draco told Harry, who was dogging him all the way down to the Apparition Gate. “Madam Cholpon told me she normally brewed as much Wolfsbane as she could and would hand barrels of them to their leader, but last month, someone must’ve missed a bolus and turned. She will be checking on them today.”
Within minutes, Draco is sauntering out again with a plastic bag crammed with sets of stickers, at least a dozen highlighters, a paperback Murakami novel and, still, without an umbrella or a Rain-Repelling Charm
Harry found it somewhat amusing; endearing, too, but this was nothing new. “And I got you,” he teased.
Harry released his arms from his chest, letting them hang defeatedly by his sides. He looked dejected and about as confused as Draco felt. It was over. Draco tried to piece the broken fragments together into what might be the full conversation, but there were plainly too many lost pieces of puzzle. He stepped out of the dusty nook, wandlessly dropping the charms as he came into Harry’s sight.
“Fuck, Harry,” Malfoy moaned, “it’s so fucking…nngh, undiluted. Fucking hell. It’s like I’m drinking from your magic.”
“I did,” Draco mumbles, finally lifting his face, allowing a hesitant tug from his cheeks to smooth out the wobble in his lips. “I bought one at Haneda. I just Shrank it so you won’t leave me alone.”
"No, no, don’t. I can hear it from miles away, you know, and it’s always quite nice to have someone finally talking back. Keep it, if you want."
In the garden, there were no rose bushes growing rampantly on his heels today, but the arrangement of the garden was still wildly different from what Harry had once described—a circular path, with the trees on both sides in gradual transition from late summer, to autumn, to winter, then to spring again.
The minute-long Pensieve clip Charlie showed Harry was one he’d plucked out from Yulia’s memory. It was for the ongoing investigation, but Charlie hadn’t shown it to the Board yet. He wanted Harry to take a look at it first.
Again, he was treated with silence. “I don’t understand,” Draco said, frustrated. “Is it because of financial problems? I’ve got loads of gold, if that’s—“
“I’m not—” Harry yawned. He was in no condition to banter. He wished Malfoy could leave him be for a while, but of course he couldn’t. He never could, could he? Leaning forward, Harry rested his forehead against the steel tubings, savouring the icy sting from the thin film of frost upon its surface.
As Draco makes his way down their research station, he lets a draughty darkness contort around him, morph into one corridor after the next, into staircases that bump past his soles, then a narrow landing, smoothly expanding into a circular observatory lined by glass. There, at the lowermost level, he can catalogue the deep sea by its hues of blue, yet to be named, and wavelengths, old friends travelling from afar with new stories to tell.
It took Harry by surprise. Harry assumed he was going to talk about the Centaur’s warning and the lurking threat. The Shaman also appeared mildly in shock. “A ghost … could you describe it for me? How the apparition took shape. Did it interact with you or your magic? Describe everything in detail, Draco. This is not a situation to be treated with tomfoolery.”
“I thought as much. Charlie uses it too, doesn’t he? Madam Cholpon was just … being overprotective.” Draco glanced away, his face going pink. “I’d like it if you were the one holding the reins, I think.”
“You heard the Centaur.” Harry insisted, panting, right at Draco’s heels. “I don’t think it’s a good idea at all. Someone just delivered an ominous prophecy to us, and now you’re suddenly feeling the pull of some unseen forces—Draco, doesn’t that bother you at all? We should at least slow down. Make a plan or something. I don’t think there could be anything positive about fogs. Or a fog metaphor. We really should just head back. I'm not—”
At some point, Malfoy even launched a debate about the chicken-and-egg paradox. Probably. Or maybe he was really concerned about barn animals. Harry wanted to focus on contemplating his conversation with the Shaman. What she had told him to do: to be introspective, which did not last long anyway.
“You don’t,” Draco repeated, and got up to his feet. There was grass in his hair. Harry thought his waist looked really slim with the mussed-up folds of his cloak hugging tightly around it.
Harry’s dumbfounded. “… Say what?” The splattering downpour easily scrunches up his words, his thoughts; pelts the wood beams and the concrete until the water stains become raised scars, silvery and many, like this cocoon surrounding them, made of silky raindrops. Draco’s voice is a slosh of fresh draught beer splashed through the muddy racket, when he whispers, “Oh my days, it’s really you.”
While dragons wanted to be remembered, wizards chronicled history with their sanctimonious quills. The list could go on.
“Hullo,” the apparition said when he noticed Harry’s gaze, riveted on him—for all the dissimilarity between them, he was Draco alright.
“Yeah, a bit, but what could I do? It wasn’t like I could dose them up with Veritaserum and demand what they meant.”
Harry continued to stay alert. Arithmancers and apprentice Flyers were milling about the shore; they paid no attention to them, but the crowd made giving an all-clear a near-impossible task. Someone could always blend in without notice. Harry and Draco were hidden in plain sight, but so was danger.
Malfoy frowned. “But, what do you mean? It’s by far the best one I’ve got. It pulls me into that … state every time. Every morning. I can’t just cast it aside.”
Now Harry can see past the thick of the fray, where three silver stags are charging across the pumpkin patch, two of them identical. Beyond: the sun stalks over to the grey chimney the way it does, the way
The scales were fading away from his face, and his wings were shrinking under the Shaman’s care, but not fully gone. At first, Draco had burrowed himself under his shelter of blankets, claiming that he looked indeed too hideous to continue existing on Earth. It was the only time Harry was allowed to go forth and coax him out for another vial of Core-stabilising Draught.
Half shrouded by the dark, the muscles in Harry’s arms and back were strong. All shifting ravines and well-bordered dunes, upon which lake water flowed. Harry had finished cleaning the tack, and was working his way down along Yulia’s forelimbs, scrubbing off debris and the blood of her prey.
“If he were left to his own devices, under some miracle he might be able to complete his change, but by then his magic core would’ve been burnt out; he would no longer be able to return to human form,” the Shaman had told Harry, barely able to contain her anger. “And in a worst-case scenario, he would get stranded where he was, late into his change. It wouldn’t be simply having the body of a mutant monster—neither his core nor his heartstrings would be complete enough to function properly and sustain his shape. He’d be dead within days.”
During summer, the city mostly reminds Harry of Draco, who likes taking steamy baths three times a day if possible. Tokyo’s also clean as a cat; here, even a fish market can be far shinier than Harry’s bathroom mirror.
“No!” Draco stopped Harry before he could yank them both into the strangling vacuum of Apparition. The Centaur hated any unbidden disturbance of magic in his forest ground, and to run the standard health check on him already required extensive cajoling. Draco normally Disapparated once the footpath had brought him far enough.
Harry was about to say something, when, from behind, the Centaur grunted and coughed loudly. Draco turned around, and saw a shudder spasming across the Centaur’s greyed, blood bay flank. They shared a look. Harry broke into a jog, hurrying back, and held out his arms so that the Centaur could support himself by gripping onto Harry’s elbows.
Yulia was hit by a Conjunctivitis Curse. After that, not even a sliver of the conflict was registered visually in the memory clip. As Charlie’s Protego slid and fell away, however, the formless familiarity hardened into …
Harry pulled himself out from the basin— “Malfoy,” he bit out immediately, not even taking the time to reorient himself.
Harry looked around at the rolling, unending white. The slow-moving sun was setting, dipping slightly behind the saddle in between two mountain peaks. Draco, as though carved from the melting glacier itself, glowed red underneath the crimson flow. For now there was no one else but them, and the high pyramid top of Khan Tengri towered at the far end of this ice-bound tongue of land, headstrong.
The parcel lay at the corner of the table, near at hand, literally. Harry picked it up. It was heavier than he thought. Draco was frowning at his feet, visibly deflating; the Shaman was pinching the bridge of her nose, looking drained. Harry cleared his throat quietly to gather their attention, and asked, “What’s the simplest method?”
Harry wanted to tell him about what had just happened at the stone well, that it had more than proven the Shaman’s theory. But Draco was shaking his head at Harry, as if no more words were needed because he already knew, as if he had no qualms about loving Harry centuries ago, far before they were born, as if being loved by him naturally entailed that love to bloom and die over and over again.
Harry as a Merman, Draco with low vision. They find each other in the deep sea, where the world ends, and the rest begins.
Competing Flyers and their dragons could come back to the camp anytime during their Hunt for medical treatment, supplies, and tack. From what Harry gathered, most teams had already set out for the Hunt. There were two Bulgarian Solomonari who were particularly ahead—they’d found their trace, and were counting on their luck that they might be able to return before the end of June.
Nonverbally, Draco Summoned a bottle of Firewhisky from a nearby Station and two tumblers. Harry laughed as Draco immediately downed what he’d just poured out for himself. Draco then got them both another slosh, but this time, he sipped it slowly.
Between two imposing rows of snowy peaks was a flat, U-shaped pass, wide enough to accommodate the wingspans of two dragons, fully stretched out. The Ridgeback was similarly light-weighted and speedy, and Draco had to exert every last ounce of strength within his spare form—he did nonetheless, and gained on them in a relatively short amount of time.
“So,” Draco drawled. From the feeble, flickering lamp lights, Harry caught sight of the deepened, mischievous lines on his cheeks. “A berkutchi? How’s she doing? How’re
Draco woke, one morning, his skin grazed upon by an unnamed thrill. A bluish sheen of light was flowing down through the window and towards the foot of his Transfigured bed. The clock sitting on his apple box told him it was five to five. Blearily, he wiggled his toes; they were cold from being left out from the reach of his quilt cover, cold from being soaked in the blue break of dawn.
She stood up from the wood table, on which displayed all the prescriptions ready to be distributed today. She put a hand on Draco’s shoulder, squeezed it, then slid it gently towards his face, which she cradled, as if it were something precious. “No, my boy,” she said softly. “Your destiny lies elsewhere; this much I do know.”
“Draco.” Harry cut him off gently. “I’m not sure, but this might just be the time to remind you of all the times I made you breakfast and lunch. At the Station. Can’t say the same for everyone, but normally I wouldn’t make coffee and sandwiches day after day for someone I don’t give a fuck about.”
When Harry woke again, it was on his bunk bed in their cabin; it was nighttime, and the rumours about Malfoy had swiftly colonised the Station before reaching Harry in no time.
Unfamiliar with English, the woman gave an uncertain laugh, and then bid the Shaman goodnight with noisy kisses on her cheeks. Soon, all they could hear was her footsteps, light but measured upon the gravelly trail—almost lupine—as she pattered into the shadow. Her voice was cotton-soft, husky, when she sang an old ballad for her eaglelet.
Being the only marine magizoologist in residence means that he’ll have to wait half a day for his standard team to assemble after he schedules an official exploration. Even after that, his assistants will be carrying out pointless procedures whilst the Healers fuss over him. Draco has his heart tied to the far end of these waveforms. He can’t afford to waste time on technicalities.
They still haven’t switched on the light. Outdoors, the lamp posts are artificial moons that smear the slanting rain into blurs of silver. The alleys have trapped the gusts of wind within the twists and turns, where they knock about like beasts—growl they sometimes do, when their muzzles fail to bang open the rattling windows. Then they’ll howl in turn, trying to terrorise the sleepy shops by threatening to tear their signboards down.
Moony’s shack, Padfoot’s cave: two lonely satellites, exiled to the distal arm of a dying galaxy. During a Hogsmeade weekend, Harry guided Draco through a convoluted wormhole leading one to the other, the past of Harry’s past, and Draco gathered them into his pockets, careful to pick up also the decommissioned signals, the lunar outings of decades lost.
They started out by exchanging opinions on different breathing techniques during meditation. Harry had to tune out, so as not to obsess over his own respiratory pattern. Then he might've heard Malfoy giving a speech on the interpretation of Animagi Visions—because, Malfoy stressed, cultural differences could influence the interpretation of the same symbols, which made relying dogmatically on one single handbook a pointless act.
Harry Transfigured a pile of leaves into a raft, which pressed slowly towards the centre of the lake under the steady push of his Locomotion Charm. Around him were dead tree trunks rising from the water, reaching all the way up into the sky.
Struggling against Malfoy’s hold, Harry brought a hand up to Malfoy’s face—wet all over. Perspiration and tears mingled damply upon it. His skin was cold, thinly sheathing those sharp cheekbones, sharp nose, sharp jaws. Malfoy protested against the loss of purchase by wrestling Harry to the ground with his legs, locking him in between his thighs.
“Sixty four, but yeah, I must be,” Harry murmurs, stoppering Draco’s anger by printing a quick kiss on his lips. “I must be mad, exposing myself like this in broad …” Harry glances around. “In broad streetlight.”
“Don't you dare. I’m highly affronted by the suggestion that I might settle for anything less,” Draco said.
Shapeshifter—an enigma; a shadowy concept that haunted some of their oldest myths. Of course Malfoy wasn’t one. Whoever started that rumour was an idiot who probably had to light up a bonfire and a firework show in their bedroom to fall asleep at night.
The Shaman’s dark eyes and thin line of mouth were hemmed in by crinkles of amusement. She asked in a way that hinted at a different approach, “Okay. Then what was the reason they hadn’t come to you then?”
strong enough to withhold a tsunami, and a heartbreak, probably; he releases it into the wind, lets his magic find Draco, touch Draco where he can’t: Draco’s skin, Draco’s hair, the sharp peaks and valleys marking the back of Draco’s hand.
“When it comes to finding your bonded dragon, that's your biggest motive? To complete the race for your mentor?” The Shaman asked Harry. She was only in her forties, yet with a time-worn calmness she looked at Harry. He struggled a bit before it, searching for words. None seemed adequate. “Well ... yeah? I mean, no. Probably not my major motive, but it’s the reason why I’m here. It's the least I can do for Charlie, and I wasn’t actively searching for my dragon before. I was … bumbling about.”
Draco had done packing the briefcase in which he stored supplements, potions and other Healing consumables—the standard stuff for a standard day—when he heard voices coming from the kitchenette by the stove. They were Harry’s and Madam Cholpon’s. Their voices grew loud for a brief spell, before self-consciously toning down again. It stirred Draco’s curiosity; he set his door half ajar so that it still concealed him, but would allow him to hear them clearly.
It was nothing like that—much messier, and stoutly stuck in autumn. Wherever Draco went, the garden was in rich, golden decay. He found himself in a fiery wasteland wherein he had to dig among piles of fallen leaves, or rummage through ripe apples, in order to collect enough of the herbs he and the Shaman needed.
The trajectory of an apple cleaved through Harry’s thoughts; his eyes, sore from staring staunchly at one spot, darted up without putting up a fight.
Harry, whose knowledge of Herbology had greatly accumulated during his time in the Sanctuary, could recognise most of the plants. Draco’s Auxiliary Potion needed to be freshly brewed three times a day; Harry collected his ingredients for him. At first, not even Draco knew the full recipe of it—it was something Animagi had to figure out for themselves along the way, he’d said.
“Good thing I’m here to save the night,” Draco announces scornfully. Frowning, with one hand he interlinks their fingers in an almost careful manner, and with the other he leads Harry’s hand to his waist; places his own on Harry’s shoulder, as if they were to dance …
on her. Draco chewed on his bottom lip for a while, then followed her gaze; turned around. Harry was standing by the door. His duffel bag had been unzipped, but he was stuffing whatever he’d been taking out right into it again, looking chagrined. Draco caught sight of a flash of silver, and no more.
Charlie was watching him with flecks of worry surfacing from those deep-set brown. Harry now understood why Charlie had to call on Yulia’s perspective; dragons were much more perceptive when it came to picking out magic traces.
When Harry explained to the Shaman about his missing dragon, Malfoy’s thigh had brushed against his lightly. Harry looked down; there was smeared dirt upon the white fabric of Malfoy’s cloak, and on his lap was a ratty parchment pad Harry often saw him take notes with.
It was another kingdom up here. Among the blinding glacial mass, the perpendicular rocks, the icy fortitude, the volatile weather—there was an uncertainty in everything they saw.
Harry unclenched the vents of his lungs, letting oxygen in. Finally, when the back of his neck began to stiffen into the position, he backed away, glancing up.
The ripple multiplied, spacing out, then, breaching the water was Draco, coughing water. The Protection Charms he’d slathered himself with were all dead, liquid and runny, and they slid down from his body, mingling with lake water. Still dragging him along the surface of the lake was Harry’s spell. Draco tripped on water multiple times, and dripping wet he fell into Harry’s arms. Draco’s magic was still curling snugly around Harry, but there was no time for him to appreciate that. Someone with a familiar voice was shouting in the distance.
Harry snorted. “And by the time I come back, she’d be well fed and you’d be gone. You know me so well, Malfoy.”
“Sorry, but that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. My wand isn’t even one of a heartstring core—you
Malfoy’s little growls swelled and loudened into a roar—a distinctly non-human sound. Harry jumped, but Malfoy’s grip was vice-like around his wrists, and he was brought back down onto Malfoy’s lap in no time. Malfoy roared again, his voice sounding unproportionately deep and thunderous, and damned Harry if he couldn’t recognise it when he’d been living with those beautiful, dangerous creatures for the past several years of his life.
“I need to collect honey tithes from the Mountain Trolls, obviously. I’m the tithingman of this mountain now.” Draco did a dramatic twirl to Disapparate; he wanted to get rid of Harry, whose reflexes were unfortunately too quick for that. He caught onto Draco’s elbows, and together they landed wobbly onto a grassy slope.
“Ah, right.” Draco snapped his fingers to extinguish the fire. They still resembled dragon claws more than they did human digits. Scooping the potion out into several flasks, Draco turned hopefully to Harry. “This afternoon, do you think we’ll be able to go for a walk in the garden together?”
Draco remembered the jealousy scattering as quickly as it gathered, and chasing it away was a simple, ardent fondness, which he realised was close to innate. A scary reflex that had been built in his body, curling dormant all this time.
Harry laughed. “God, I missed you.” He crowded Draco against the vine-carpeted wall of the stone hut, still grinning. Draco squeezed his eyes shut. They were so close now; Draco could feel the tip of his nose brushing against Harry’s, could feel, as he leaned back against the wall, the dampness clinging onto his hair, seeping into his shirt. The bridge of Harry’s nose was cool, too. His skin was an analogue of the air before dawn, but his ribs were a cage of pulsing Fiendfyre. Draco bet kissing Harry would be like smoking realgar—an ecstatic sunset before the storm.
The HoverAid Stations, after settling down one after another by the shores of Lake Issyk-Kul, turned most of its wizarding parts into a temporary campsite. According to Malfoy, who had taken part in the design process, the Stations functioned a bit like the Knight Bus when travelling airborne, and, while on land, would appear as a modest row of yurts to the Muggle eye.
Grappling at Harry clumsily, Malfoy burrowed his wet face into Harry’s neck. He alternated between whimpers and roars as his bones twisted on itself, reminding Harry of a werewolf during full moons.
“They … turn into ghosts, and watch over their loved ones for the rest of their lives,” Harry answered; he found speaking rather painful with a drought closing in on his throat.
It came easy to them—both flying and speaking into each other’s head. Harry didn’t know how much of it was because he had spent his youth watching Draco fly and talk, vice versa, and how much was because this was “meant to be”. He’d stopped thinking about this question entirely at some point—a circle has no beginning, Luna had once said.
Harry grimaced, marching away in furious, long strides. If he were moving faster, he’d be bolting off into the Arctic tundras in no time.
Harry has to wade through his own dilemma, the methodically commuting bodies and the low-hanging humidity among the city, just to get another step closer to Draco. It is quite impossible to lose him though; his bright hair, along with the Tutshill aqua he wore, is his calling card among the dimmed flurry of the crowd.
Draco ignored him anyway, pawing the grassy earth underfoot. Focused, instead, on the ghost of a yellow flower over there, dancing. Listened to the anarchic reticence of the mountains nearby.
There was another tug on his magic core, different from the dragon heart’s. This one was tentative and explorative at first, but Draco had no strength to resist anything anymore. He let it rummage about. The ghost before him was himself. He didn’t understand how it was possible, but there was little doubt as to what it was … who it was ….
The Centaur ignored him, propped his forelegs up and stood from the soft spread of leaves by his writing log. Draco suppressed an urge to bolt when the Centaur loomed over them, his wasted torso tall yet crooked, his shadow stinking of alcohol and overnight sweat. Harry gave Draco’s fingers a reassuring squeeze, which only served to startle Draco out of his own skin.
If Ron were here, he'd probably be able to draw analogies between dragons and witches. He'd probably whisk out a copy of
—Draco opened his mouth pliantly. Harry fit the bit and looped the bridle in place, his knuckles brushing the soft crown of spikes around Draco’s head. If Draco were human right now, he supposed he might whimper, but he was a prideful creature, and it came out as an impatient little huff.
against it, Draco stuck his arms forward weakly, holding out a parcel—its wrapping cloth strangely dry.
Wordlessly, Malfoy had sat down beside him, pulling Harry’s weight onto himself. Harry couldn’t resist the safe steering of Malfoy’s hands. Couldn’t resist being held, and being told, “Not to worry—I’m here, aren’t I? Get some kip, Harry.” The lull to sleep was dewy and sun-paved, pillowed by the timbre of Malfoy’s voice.
The remedies were prepared for the locals: pain-relieving salve for arthritis; powdered Charms to prevent dragon pox; sachets for sweet dreams … the Shaman had told them, before leading them through the front door again and into the open air.
“I swear the garden’s usually quite organised.” Harry was still smiling—soon wasn't, when he caught sight of Draco limping. Draco was a little bandy-legged, having not fully recovered from his vigorous fit of bone remodelling; he was walking bare-footed because his elongated toes could not fit in his old shoes.
“You told me it’s not worth it,” Draco suddenly said, looking stricken. “It is, Harry. It’s worth more than a try. This is worth everything I can give, anyway.”
Draco wasn’t sure if he was allowed to retain this anger. He’d spent the better part of his youth antagonising Harry when all he wanted was to be his friend, and look how far it had gotten him. But still. Harry was not just an idiot, but also a constant reminder of Draco’s inability to do good.
“You—you take delight in vexing me!” Draco levers his weight onto Harry’s shoulders, and, hoisting himself up on his tiptoes, he yells at Harry’s face. “A hundred and one owl posts returned to sender … are you
He went indoors. For breakfast, the Shaman was slathering fresh cream on a wheel-shaped bread. It was a perfect opportunity to change things for the better.
“Well I am.” The young man hitched a shoulder up, and with a lazy smirk his phantom of a body whipped into the majestic form of a dragon. Harry recognised those wings. He had seen them once; touched them. He remembered how they quivered under Harry’s fingertips, how they unfurled like sails on sea, catching the wind.
“That’s a smelly heap of dragon dung and you know it.” Harry sighed. “I was scared—I dunno. I think part of me refused to believe that I deserved the things I wanted. You were there when I asked Madam Cholpon about it, weren’t you? And you heard what she said.”
Malfoy had been the one to share the news with Harry. Evidently he’d been checking on Charlie every once in a while, and had, without delay, hurried from the Healer’s Quarter all the way up to the stable to get Harry, whom he studiously avoided looking at. “Thought you perhaps would want to be the first, Harry,” Malfoy said stiffly, toeing with his brogues the bristly fringe of Yulia’s empty nest. “To hear Charlie’s first-hand account of the attack.”
Harry complied. At first, he simply nipped softly at Draco’s lower lips, but after a couple of gentle, explorative beats, Harry moved up; dragged his mouth against Draco’s, coaxing it open with persistent attention.
Unfortunately with the same pigheadedness they saw rodeoing and taming wild Graphorns a life challenge of theirs. Few had succeeded in Troll history; most ended up with a concussion.
Draco had disappeared through the bookshelves and into the wall after that—to clear his head, probably. Harry could not bring himself to blame him. He still remembered the raw, exposed fear he fostered, after realising that the final Horcrux was lodged deep within his own skull.
“Not to poachers, maybe.” The way Harry’s eyes focused on him made him squirm. “Draco, you don’t have to prove yourself to anyone.”
The pulley creaked as it spun feverishly in on itself to hoist up the bucket and the dragon heart. The rope was being eaten away by the wheel’s rim at an alarming speed, and Harry could feel their connection fading. The image of the young man flickered too, like candlelights in a gust of wind.
“My soul is a grave where I wander and dwell eternally.” Harry turned the syllables on the tip of his tongue. Curious. He then tried it again mentally, in Malfoy’s accent. “Why’s that your mantra when you meditate?”
She glanced up from her tea bowl. “In the past, I didn’t have anyone else on my side when I tried to reshape my identity. I guess a part of me still wished to reverse that.”
Across the waist of the mountain they went, the sky a rain-washed swathe of beryl blue on their left; not a cloud in sight. From time to time, her lurching little trot would send Malfoy tumbling softly into Harry’s back, and when Malfoy spoke, his warm breath tickled at Harry’s earlobe. Harry could feel the shape of each syllable upon his skin.
“Maybe—I dunno …” Harry had a horrible feeling that she was trying to impart an answer that was incredibly simple but somehow he was unable to grasp. He stared at the smear of dirt on Malfoy’s sleeve. It did not rearrange into legible words. “Maybe I wasn’t prepared enough? Maybe they were … far away? I don’t know.”
Her flying was measured, controlled, like she knew exactly the pace it would take for her to win. There was a bored expression on Reni’s delicate face as she sped forward on her Ridgeback. “Who the hell are you?” she snapped at Harry.
When he blinked his eyes open again, Harry’s lips were no longer on his, their hands unfastened—because … well, because it was anatomically impossible. And Harry was on his tiptoes, pressing his cheek against Draco’s neck, murmuring mundane yet potent things in his ear. Telling him he was beautiful, that he was good, that he was his dragon.
“I’ll—” Harry didn’t know what was his to promise, and what was not. He shuffled to the edge of Draco’s woolly nest. “I could stay, for a while; but only if you want me to.”
Under Malfoy’s arm, he was carrying his meditation cushion, which he’d Shrunken into a pillow-size block. As he drew closer, Harry noticed that his chest was heaving. Harry checked his watch. It was seven in the morning.
It felt like coming home; Harry knew it wasn’t, but he no longer knew why. Last night, Draco had insisted that he’d encountered what was once part of him—that he
“Where’s the eye?” Draco says, oddly enthusiastic. He leaps gracefully off from Harry’s embrace; makes to wrench the glass sliding door open. Harry leans over, swats his hand away. “Don’t. My landlord’s gonna have a fit.”
He delivered potions to the alpine lakes for the nomads. Sometimes, the Centaurs came knocking on the wards at her Apparition Gate, and Draco Healed them if she wasn’t available. For the farmers, he could make one patch of the fields rain and the other one remain sunny. And whatever ridiculous objects the River Trolls wished to find, he easily Summoned.
“That would never be the case.” Harry rested a hand upon the rope that hung down from the pulley. The texture was rough against his palm, which was already sweaty and itching. If he hauled the bucket back up again, would this shadow of the past evaporate in bright sunlight?
The Shaman’s eyes were a colder shade of brown than he last saw them. “Young Solomonar,” she said, her English carrying a tough, flinty quality to it. “You seemed to have found your dragon just fine, haven’t you?”
“Maybe I’m terribly curious about what I might see,” said Draco, but he'd switched to the drawling voice he donned only when he was completely terrified.
This small, snide voice in Harry’s head puts him in his place. Even when, obstinately, a part of him still earmarks the cloudy fringes of every forthcoming typhoon, waiting for the day he can carry one of them like a promise ring.
“But,” Harry said, a little confused, “dragons are the ones who make the final decisions. Of course, bonded pairs can communicate without words or physical cues, but Flyers can only offer guidance, and the rest depends on—“
Their Bicorn knew the way by heart, and needed no spurring. The only time she slowed down her pace, it was to linger among a sunflower field. She sniffed longingly at the wide chequered faces, nudged the thin yellow petals with her muzzle, kicked the soil around playfully, before setting off again.
a backup plan, to say the least. They’d come hastily, and didn’t even have an agreed-upon meeting place after Disapparating, or signals to call for help. No one would know where to find them if they didn’t make a safe return by dinner time.
“Nothing, I thought—” Draco went still. There it was again. This time, he was able to locate the source of the pull, and knew almost instantly the directions he should take to get to it.
Although all standard appliance spells were hard at work up here, whirring and groaning to generate more heat and oxygen, to cancel out the effects of wind …  they were only capable of doing so much. Harry glanced sidelong at Malfoy, who wasn’t even wearing gloves; those hands looked raw and vulnerable under the nipping air, and Malfoy had forgotten to cast a Warming Charm on himself.
There was nothing sweet about Draco, and tasting him, Harry felt idiotic for thinking that he had a sweet-tooth. The lure of the night was cool upon Draco’s skin; Harry pressed his warmth into it, leaning into the kiss some more. It was sweet in Draco’s own un-sweet ways.
From the soft shuffling, Draco has no idea whether Harry’s moving away from him, or just propping himself up on his elbows. Oh god, oh
He touched his wand to the tips of the wormwood branches, lit a tiny fire upon them, and contained the flame so that the herbs would burn slowly. He passed one of the makeshift incense sticks to Harry, who held it carefully erect.
Harry, too, had wanted to ask the same question when he was at the well, even if he knew that the apparition of Draco’s old magic would not be able to answer. Maybe Draco wasn’t asking Harry now; maybe he was asking himself.
Outside, the familiar stranger skirts their station from a distance like a curious fish, while Draco moors himself to their voice, nearing, as though beckoned by his attention, as though they are waiting for Draco’s silhouette to give up its shape and temperature in return, because—Draco gasps—honed sharp by old magic, the eerie call has speared through the wards, electrifying the scientific cold as it charges across the room, sending shivers along the walls, along Draco's skin.
Harry reached into his utility belt, rummaged through the tools for emergency and pulled out the parcel, in which were the heart and the wand Charlie had taken from the poacher. “We bring him home,” he said.
The invisible barrier before them zapped down on the third gun sound—nearly frying Harry’s scalp as Draco burst forth. Harry almost got thrown off Draco’s back. The reins bit through his gloves as he held on for dear life; soon, the muscles were burning along his thighs just from maintaining balance.
They climbed the heights in zigzags and spirals, so that Harry could physically get used to the insane altitude. Even with the Oxygen-Replenishing Potion coursing reassuringly in his bloodstream, dizziness still lurked in the background.
“Exactly what are you?” Draco presses his forehead against the aftershocks in the glass. Through his monitor spells, he also notices that the currents are rushing every which way, like they are expecting a change, a takeover. There is no way a regular Sea Merx can do this to their environment, even though their magic cores are uniquely phonic: through echolocation, they navigate the vast sea fluently.
Draco sniggered, huffing out wisps of smoke through his nose. Rather comically, they curled into grey mushrooms before his face. Exasperated, Harry bent down and gave him another peck on the withers, this time doing it properly, without magic. “A Solomonar,” Harry then answered Reni. “Just like you.”
Malfoy’s lips adopted just the subtlest touch of an upward curve around the straw. As if on autopilot, Harry relit the cig wandlessly. He passed it over to Malfoy. “Have a puff,” he said in a hollow voice. Also on autopilot.
They could always come back for the heart—Harry wished to complete the second section as much as the next Flyer—with a proper action plan
Knowing Charlie, he must’ve lagged behind because he wanted to make sure Harry had found his dragon first, which made Harry feel extremely guilty. Charlie could’ve entered the race weeks ago with another random Flyer as his apprentice, back when Harry was still adamant about going as a Solomonar. And for his final member, he could’ve snatched one of those Arithmancers who had always been a popular choice among the winning teams, instead of risking his chance for Harry by signing up late and picking from what was left in the pile. Arithmancers were particularly important when it came to flight safety, and Harry could only imagine how the team would suffer from being led by a substandard one.
and his magic found Draco’s in no time, latching onto it. Even so, progress was still slow and frustrating; Harry looked around in desperation. Aside from the three or four nearby trunks, weedy and skeleton-white, he could not see through the confusion and take in anything further than that.
“I hear you too,” at some point, Harry tells him, easy as though riding the current, so effortless, as they’ve found each other again and again—with bodies that are not perfect, over the years, across an ocean. An ocean that is merciful, Draco concludes, Harry being a case in point.
“Dragons are very stubborn creatures, aren’t they?” The Shaman gave a humourless laugh, and started to wrap the cloth around the heart again. One corner over the right atrium, then another over the left ventricle; the jagged scar shone, lone and white in the middle. “Death is only a door to a new body, a new life, if you believe in reincarnation, and as we’ve discussed and agreed on during our first session, Draco, it is true that our beliefs shape our reality.”
“What were your thoughts then? When you were back in Romania. I assume that was when you were less proactive.”
Absently, Harry felt the rolled realgar in his pocket. It was encased in Preservation Charms, and buzzed against the pulp of his fingers. Charlie’s gaze followed the movement.
“It was like he understood, like his anger could keep me safe. I don’t know what this says about me, though.” Harry took a big gulp from the tea bowl. It tasted fresh, bitter, and reminded him of Draco’s tongue. “The next morning, Charlie left for Romania and I went with him. By the end of the holiday,” Harry quirked his mouth at the absurdity of it, “I dropped out from the Auror training program, and they were my closest family ever since—Charlie and Yulia.”
From Kyrgyzstan to Uzbekistan, they often found themselves zooming through the maze of vales and along the grey scrappy ridges. Found themselves evolving along the imperfect landscape as they flew.
It isn’t long before Harry locks eyes with another pair of bentgrass green, noon-dried, both of them slightly surprised by the mirroring determination they find across hours, thinking,
Harry had the slimy sensation that someone was perhaps watching him from the outside; perhaps he was being paranoid. He shook it off, and concentrated on hauling Draco further up towards the lake surface.
Draco remembered his third night in the Sanctuary, before the dragon race had begun. The milky way was visible, sprinkling carelessly along the night sky. He wandered along the hills, and found Harry by a dark pond, its face wrinkled by the wind, its ripples streaked silver by the moon. He remembered being jealous.
“Until they were almost extinct, and had to concede to the terms,” Harry went on, grimacing. “So that the wizarding governments would stop their propaganda and leave them alone. That happened. But the hunting never stopped, even though it was finally pronounced illegal because the wizards realised it wouldn't be a good look in the long run. But in the end the hunting just took on a different name. Poaching.”
Harry's fingers fumbled down to check his pulse, and felt nothing. Not at the side of his neck. Not at his wrists. But then from those pulse points, Malfoy’s magic was bursting forth like a high pressure hose nozzle, smiting Harry’s fingers with the force of it. It was painful; Harry wanted to check if his own hands were bruised, if Malfoy’s magic had carved itself through the whorls under his fingers and the lines on his palms. But he couldn’t move them an inch away. He thought of Malfoy’s wording: undiluted.
Harry once caught Draco alone at the break of dawn, when the Shaman was off to the lakes, where shepherds came to trade dairy for her potions and Blessings.
Harry shot a surreptitious glance at him. “There’s a bit of everything in the bag, really,” he said. “A tent. Your tablet and monitor set—you left them in the cabin, and I thought you might want to keep them. Some basic supplies and whatnot.”
Draco could barely contain his impatience, but he refrained from pressing further. The Charm configuration in the sabre needed redesigning; he tried to focus on his task, and in the meantime he simply waited for some miraculous click to happen at the junction of Harry’s brain and mouth.
“What’s that?” Flicking her gaze down to the cloth-wrapped parcel in Draco’s hands, the Shaman dropped the indulgent smile, her brows knitting tight.
They somehow ended up tumbling onto the grass, laughing, because there were rose bushes all around again, growing to isolate them from the real world. They didn’t try to run from it this time, and lay together, limbs interlocked, in the kindness and safety of their island.
Having geared up, he drops his weight into the moon pool. The water used to be a heavy blanket that muffles his worries, but today, the ambient noise has risen up to a cacophony. It's one thing to monitor noise pollution through statistics, and a whole different thing to witness it first-hand. Though slightly compromised, Draco’s Visiblear does its work fine, showing him a way through the low light, to the song.
Shuffling listlessly, Malfoy dragged his pair of brogues across the sandy ground, jutting a knee up. He rested an arm upon it. “They walked you through the attack, I’ll bet,” he said finally. “When will the judgement be pronounced, I wonder. Am I found guilty? Am I fornicating with the devil?”
Before Harry can stop himself, he lets his layers of disguise collapse around him like a crinkly old shell. There’s no point, come to think of it. Not even his invisibility cloak has ever sufficed to stop Draco from noticing him.
Draco, at last, dragged Harry down onto the grass. “Stop that. You’re driving me crazy,” he complained. Reluctantly, Harry sat down as well.
and it pelt down as bitter ice pellets against Harry’s skin. He felt his emotion wheeling forward, from recognition to anger, in sync with Yulia’s.
. Blushing, Draco briefly considers plunging back into the moon pool so he can languish away on the sea bed.
physical business,” Draco says, but becomes too impatient to keep his word. He nurses their closeness into a kiss,
“I’m sorry,” Harry blurted. It was a belated one, but it somehow felt relevant, with Draco thumbing the bridle thoughtfully, his fingers brushing along the brow band, the cheek straps, the throat latch … “You shouldn’t have to—I shouldn’t have brought that.”
They can watch the telly, Harry knows, and huddle over the glitch-troubled screen. Draco will trace the strangely fascinating aperture from the sea, to the shore, then across the tiny strip of land to where they are, in one another’s arms. But Harry doesn’t reach out for the remote, keeping to themselves the grumpy winds, the moon-bleached rain, the typhoon night, and the billowy curtains of light misting in from the streets. He wants to keep Draco to himself, too, if only for a minute longer.
The roses were in full bloom, soft faces blurring together into clouds of orange, woody stems interlacing with their path forward. Strangely, however they tried to circumvent them, the bushes would sneak out from absolutely nowhere to besiege Harry and Draco over and over again. They spent the first fifteen minutes trying to outstrip the overgrowing bushes, sweaty and laughing, until Harry thought to throw himself onto the Mandrake patch, letting the muffled screams of the roots thwart the stalker roses.
“Harry,” she started, placing her sun-crisped hands upon her lap, where they piled atop one another like thick autumn leaves. “I think your main issue is an abstract one, rather than a geographical one. If you are a Solomonar, then your dragon must be right there, hidden in plain sight, waiting for you to recognise them. I suggest you focus less on the physical act of finding your bonded dragon. Try to trace out the inner shackles you’re holding yourself back with. Is there a part of you that’s still not ready for good things to come? Is there a part of you believing that you might not deserve more than what you have? You must work from your end, if you want to meet your bonded one halfway.”
It was three in the morning when Harry enquired about the firework show; Draco simply rolled his eyes before blasting a jet of Red Sparks through the white bow window. “Happy?” he said, having the audacity to sound exasperated, but Harry’s snark was soon melted into an unintelligible puddle by the heat of Draco’s mouth.
“Didn’t know you smoked.” Malfoy eyed Harry as he stepped around the tree, then up into an alcove in the fuselage of their Station.
, the sliver of his chest an offering to the dragons who stirred up the storm, his glowing skin misty through the V of his bathrobe.
Malfoy was therefore suspended from his position while the Board carried out an investigation. He raised no objection to it, as far as Harry knew; yet it didn’t make him appear any less suspicious.
He wasn’t sure what to expect, what he might see. If it really was the heart from Draco’s past, would the magic in the heartstrings recognise Harry? Draco had suggested that they were bonded; Harry secretly agreed. He could feel it sometimes, like the time he pulled Draco out of the lake—he always suspected it had perhaps been more the bond’s doing than the Summoning Charm’s. What the Shaman told them yesterday night hinted the possibility of them being also bonded in a previous life, which was wild, but they lived in a magical world and Harry supposed that was enough to warrant just about anything.
Harry spots him in the midst of work; he should be focusing on tailing his suspect through this crazy peak-hour throng in Shibuya, should be avoiding whomever might be surveilling him in reverse … except he no longer cares. He follows Draco into a spacious, LED-bright bookshop to wait out the drizzle, which unfortunately, is slowly rising to a crescendo.
"Physically it was an entirely different person, but it was me nevertheless. I wonder if it’s what my soul looks like? Anyway, I think it tried to touch me, or something, but I passed out. Delicate lungs, you see.”
But—right now, Draco’s gaze is a piercing gimlet, pinning Harry into the sultry density of the night.
A sinking feeling took over Draco’s stomach. He could already picture the rest in his mind, clear as day.
After Harry had done gawping at the bee-keeping Trolls, Draco led the way towards a clearing that was the only place safe from all the rampant stinging and stamping. He piled the herbal patches and ointments upon a raised rock plateau, which was large enough to contain ten Slytherins on a dance floor. There, pots of honey were laid carefully at the centre, waiting for him to collect.
“What now?” Draco asked. He swiftly shucked his large white body, and got to his feet. He was wearing mismatched, woolly socks underneath his hiking boots.
The crinkles gathered deep; there was a sparkling quality to them now. “And it didn’t occur to you that maybe they called you a Solomonar because you already are one,” she said, almost flatly. Harry felt extremely stupid. She hadn’t even framed it as a question.
But Malfoy was saying “perhaps” in the way he only did when he was agitated … lying, usually, or when he’d had too much coffee. P-haps.
“That wasn’t planned. None of what happened was. This afternoon I checked in at the hostel two stories below your flat, and the plan was to waylay you as soon as you make your way back from the Apparition point, but I got bored waiting, so I thought I could kill some time impersonating an utter tourist.”
Harry sighed. “You’re a handful, aren’t you?” He let his magic swirl around Draco’s lowermost spike—just inches before his withers. Slow circles. Draco tried not to surrender immediately under the spreading tingle. The exact texture and the sheer density of Harry’s magic surprised Draco every time, as though he hadn’t already formed a skin memory from it.
“For riding a horse?” Draco was genuinely lost, but when he caught sight of Harry’s face—“Oh. I see. For a dragon.”
“There’s something you need to know, though,” Harry told him, suddenly serious, as they followed the pebbly trail through the woods and out of the hearing range of Trolls and bees—presuming that they have one. “I thought I might tell you along the way. What’s your next stop?”
Draco does not answer, his tongue numb, a little knot knocking about in his chest—freed soon enough, by the barest brush of Harry’s lips against the corner of his mouth. “Because I’m still counting on you to take charge of the pacing. Our pacing.”
magic, sweet dear, and I thought you were amazingly hopeless. I must tell you; I was affronted, for you were unfazed by me.”
Very uncharacteristic is Draco's cooperation, almost waveless, as he folds himself back into the warmth of Harry’s chest, his fizz settling down.
“P-haps I did,” Draco said curtly, eyes widening. “P-haps I did not. I believe I’m not obliged to remember every single—“
“No.” Harry was horrified. “No it’s—in dragon riding, Flyers mostly apply tack so that they can hold onto the reins, especially during emergencies. You know how dragons are. They aren’t to be tamed, and the regular bits we use will not be remotely painful against their mucosa—they breathe fire, for fuck’s sake. It’s mostly for mutual communication and for the Flyer’s safety.”
“Why does anyone do anything anyway?” Malfoy huffed, and he must be leaning closely forward, because there were strands of pale gold teasing in Harry’s peripherals.
“This is not me diverting my ennui towards you on the spur of the moment,” Draco said quietly. Drawing her brows together, Madam Cholpon said nothing. Contrary to what Draco had imagined, she wasn’t at least a little bit moved when Draco proposed becoming her apprentice. “This is something I’ve been thinking about for a while. You told me I’m good at what you do, and that you can’t find an apprentice. I thought this was perhaps what you were trying to tell me …. I thought we were on the same page.”
Harry shifts on his seat. Apart from being damp and unpleasant, the timber beneath him scratches through the tight fabric of his trousers, itching at his skin.
Malfoy was saying with an insouciant drawl, “Why not give him some time to recollect.” He flipped through his note pad with a flourish. “Harry can be quite thick, really.”
at six thirty, when he tosses a coin to make a wish. His prayers in themselves are frankly a dead giveaway, too, for they are all the same, word by word, day after day.
But Malfoy gulped down another puff of smoke, seemingly unaffected by it just as Harry was—or rather, he seemed to be enjoying it as much, if not more. When he lifted his face, Harry saw that his eyes were glazed.
A weak ripple flared up into sight, not far off Harry’s raft as the first wink of hope. Cold beads of sweat tickled at his temple as Harry gave everything into the pull of his magic.
Harry once woke up to the obscenely gyrating pipes on his Windows screensaver; clicked his mouse; decrypted 140 drunken emails and gleaned from their exchanges that he might’ve at one point been pressured into promising Draco a private firework show at Disneyland. During the first night of Draco’s stay, however, Draco spent most of his time trying to encase Harry with his odd-looking limbs, and would drag Harry back under the musky sheets whenever he made for the minibar.
Now, Harry finally understood what he meant. He could dwell eternally in this replicated universe of his longing. Could not fathom how he had been operating all this time without a key in the ignition. However the Shaman might have warned them, Harry also knew there was no way anyone could be prepared for something like this ... this was the inflow of a lifetime of emotions.
Harry turns away from the silvery world outside, because he already has the colour imprinted along the swollen rhythms in his heart. He aligns himself with Draco instead—forehead to forehead, nose to nose, a huff of laugh seeking its pouty better half.
Draco ignores him; speaks into the empty air, “And now’s the time I answer, ‘Who’s there?’ Before you debate between admitting, ‘An idiot stalker,’ or lying, in which case,” he jiggles his Walkman emphatically, “I don’t know … a smooth criminal?”
But Draco’s tail twitched. Harry felt the vertebrae twisting slightly; a sweet little roll against the base of Harry’s spine. Bone to bone.
Harry walks out into the rain; not suave enough, though, to claim that it is one without a backward glance—
“… my soul is a grave where I wander and dwell eternally.” Malfoy’s voice had jolted him out of the depths of his thoughts. Harry glanced up, but Malfoy was paying him no attention. The parchment paper before him was already splashed with messy hand-drawn diagrams and bulks of handwriting—hurried, but still cubed and decidedly upright like miniature Roman temples.
The Centaur’s voice took on a pleasant baritone, which was completely incongruous with his appearance—all ragged old bones and flabby skin. He continued, oblivious to Draco’s inner turmoil, “Solomonar, do not wander from the circumpolar lights, even when fog comes.”
For a frantic moment, Draco’s heart became too bloated to even continue thumping—it remained foolishly where it had been, stuck and gormless, just as his entire body was. Draco couldn’t move an inch as the water became hard ice, encasing his body. Draco couldn't breathe … remembered, again, that he had used up all his oxygen. Blinking, he saw that the hand was close to wrapping around his neck now … the pearly grey figure came near … a ghost … a ghost of his own.
The Shaman’s thick shell of Protection Charms around her mountain must’ve kept the buffalo Patronus hovering before the Apparition Gate, until it finally found a way in.
As if!” Draco huffs, but he takes Harry’s hand, and as one they meander slowly towards the mustard loveseat, whose ghastliness has often been raptly observed by Draco's smart mouth.
“Of course I’m coming,” Malfoy snapped when Harry asked him why he was following him all the way out of their Station. “It could be a defining moment in my Animagus training. Shamans are gifted Seers, and I really need to make sure I’m on the right track—”
The Shaman came back from the stove with a pot of green tea and two small bowls. She said she made it strong; Harry sighed, feeling grateful. They sat opposite by the table, and Harry could feel the Shaman’s gaze on him, cautious. He stared at the drifting tea leaves, let his thoughts steep, and waited for the Shaman to say something, although she was probably doing the same.
With that, he disappeared through the woods, leaving Harry staring blankly at the neatly-wrapped heart.
Sometimes, beforehand, Harry would make fancy plans for dinner, for shopping at Ginza afterwards, even when he knew none of them would turn out as useful as the 100 yen coins in his pocket, because Draco’s hotel suite was where they’d end up till tomorrow morning, doing round after round of you-know-what, with only hot cups of instant ramen, vending machine cigarettes and cold beer marking the in-betweens.
“My past is merely a reservoir of growing pains.” Like that, Draco released his new mantra into the air. In no time, along with the bitter smoke of the burning herbs, it was taken away by the fae folks who strolled down the winds.
Harry took his hand, and predictably, was met with empty air—but from there, a warm current rushed up along his arm to his chest, where it foamed and sizzled in his lungs, then to his entire body, and in him the merciful spell resided.
There was no clear border between night, land and lake in sight. Tiny flecks of white glowed distantly about. Draco was shivering under the feeble illumination slanting down from the cold moon. After Harry double-checked that they weren’t followed, he dropped their tightly clasped hands; Draco Spelled himself dry.
Draco gave him an insouciant shrug. “Mountain Trolls are excellent beekeepers,” he said loftily, even though his reaction had been way more indecent just days ago. In
“Long story,” Harry said. “Basically, I Summoned you out of the lake when the fog rose. Someone was watching us, I think. But he was shot by an arrow and it gave me a window to Rennervate you and Apparate us away. Actually, I have a feeling it was the Centaur who went there to check on us and made sure we got away okay. You know the rest.” The rest was a series of Apparition jumps. Draco gaped at him.
Draco chose to return then, his face blank with a false guise of calm. In a dull, drawling voice he asked the Shaman, “How do I know whether your theory is correct? I’m rather fascinated. Are there paternity tests for souls? Or magic, in this case?”
“Probably because of the smell of dragon dung on Harry’s robe,” Malfoy had complained to no one in particular.
“Because normally,” Draco prattled on, “before their transition, an Animagus would have to undergo a month of realgar micro-dosing during their final stage of training, so the high-level realgar I unintentionally took must’ve served to thrust me through that process—”
The Retrieve Hunt was supposed to be the highlight of the race. As the name suggested, competing teams could work solo or form alliances as they tried to sniff out traces of illegally poached dragon hearts, stowed away within the Tien Shan mountain range.
“There’s loads you need to do,” Draco says sulkily. “But no, as I said, that was purely accidental, and bold of you to assume that I need a reverse charm to see through your Polyjuice.”
“Not with a Pensieve,” Harry said hoarsely. He thought of the way Draco’s magic turned the leaves yellow, the way Draco was afraid to let autumn drowse into winter, because he didn’t believe that spring would come again. But Harry knew they would pay a visit to Madam Cholpon and Betty the Bicorn after they took their Portkey back to Lake Issyk-Kul. Harry would hug Draco through winter, walk him through spring, and kiss him through summer—then through the four seasons again. “I can show you. In other ways.”
Harry found Malfoy under a tree out in the campsite. He was having lunch. There were several magical yurts squatting sturdily before them, blocking them from prying eyes and passers-by.
Three years, he thinks, three years doesn’t seem that long, even though the mystery surrounding their identity lurks, constantly, at the back of his mind.
him, is all. Harry did remember soaking himself with a thorough Disillusionment Charm before following Draco through the trees and under a gazebo. Plus, the Polyjuice must still be running strong in his bloodstream. This new body is lanky and stiff under Harry’s command. After sinking onto the hardwood bench across Draco, there has been a dull ache spreading outwards from the lumpy bones in his bum. Harry can proudly say that his own is generally more impact-proof.
Setting portable wards around competing Flyers was part of an Arithmancer’s job in the race. On the night before, however, Malfoy’s
“For sure.” Harry was aware of the stirrings of murmur around them, no doubt from the Arithmancers and apprentice Flyers who were listening in out of a sort of malicious nosiness.
Harry dipped his face into the Pensieve, and let the drizzly cold breath of the stone basin licked tamely his cheeks … the tip of his nose … then, he was zipped away from the dusty, sun-drenched aisle of the archive room, and right into the midst of the fight.
“Not really, I don’t.” Harry inhaled a lungful of smoke. The realgar powder deposited into his magic core warmly. It was a substance chronically toxic to Muggles, lethal to Shapeshifters (if the myths were anything to go by), and psychedelics for wizards. Harry felt it swirl inside him like fine wine in a glass, releasing a bouquet of provocative images.
Before them, the narrow trail chose to veer suddenly to the right, and Betty nearly flung Malfoy off her back onto the rocky soil as she made the turn. Malfoy yelped, and closed his arms firmly around Harry’s waist, the ridge of his thumb digging at Harry’s ribs. Somehow, the pressure of it prompted Harry to bring his fist into his pocket, and felt with his fingers the coarse dry paper of a realgar cigarette.
They did go for a walk after all. The air was crisp and warm, the exact texture of an overly baked cinnamon apple. Harry led him through the back door towards the now familiar Mandrake patch. As they walked past it, soft, mushy babbling from the Mandrake babies could be heard overground.
He had no idea what to do with it. Why it came. Was he jealous of Harry, who suddenly looked elegant and peaceful without the burdens of the war? Was he jealous of the dragon, who had easily secured Harry’s undivided attention?
The ridiculous thing about Harry was not that he ended up falling in love with Draco Malfoy; it was the quota of dumb luck he was allowed to draw from, which was practically boundless.
“Very well then. The larger magical organisms were unable to all go into hiding at once, because after the Statue took place, wizards had taken up most of the Muggle-free lands. Trolls, Giants and dragons were the ones who rebelled against it, and that was roughly when the governments started encouraging trophy hunting with them as the game.”
After Draco made sure he had his weekly insulin potion taken and a well-stocked tree hollow, Draco rounded on Harry again. “Well? Don’t keep me in suspense.”
Draco tasted like adventure, the kind that might maroon a wizard with a hinkypunk and a swamp, so that they would only continue to exist in their old life as just another sad heap of missing person flyers. But it was the same kind that could make a hero out of anyone, would goad them until they tore their way into the history books and clear out a throne for their name. Not that Harry needed that, but still.
