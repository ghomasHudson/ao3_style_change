Healer McDaniels brought out his potions and began giving them to Draco with the accompanying spells, making notes on his parchment. After about half hour of this, he finally set down his wand.
He turned the water on and splashed his face then looked in the mirror at his gaunt disheveled appearance. So different than the haughty, bratty kid of years past, spoiled beyond belief by his parents. He didn’t blame his parents, they had only wanted the best for him but they had never denied him anything and bowed to his whims. It wasn’t until Voldermort had returned that reality had come in a slapped Draco down. That was when he truly learned what the consequences of the pureblood ideology he had drummed into him really were. He was horrified at himself but more so the others around him. He was forced to make terrible choices to keep his family and himself safe.
“I know this is hard for everyone but there is no point in getting angry and throwing accusations around. We need to figure out what will be best for the two of them and how we are going to handle this moving forward,” Barnes said looking at everyone in the room as he spoke. “I do have a few questions for the healers. You said this was a partially initiated bond, what does that mean and how is it completed?”
“Let’s go,” she motioned to the two boys.
Barnes sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. How many more complications could come up? “Have you had a chance to test the current state of the bond?” Barnes asked.
“I think its time we went to bed. We have a long day ahead of us,” Wilcox replied shifting gears. “Mr. Malfoy, unless you require the bathroom, you will need to leave the curtain open to allow us to monitor you. Understood?”
“Of course.”
Instantly a warmth spread through Harry, like nothing he had ever felt. He was surprised by how soft Draco’s hands were but still strong in their grip. The look on Draco’s face told him that he was feeling the same or similar feeling. It felt like an hour had past but in reality, it had only been a few seconds and it was done, but the feeling lingered and Harry didn’t want to let go of Draco’s hand.
“Well, now you are aware. Partially initiated bonds are very unstable and dangerous. They can go from seemingly fine to needing to be within inches of each other to not be physically ill in moments. Once initiated they are much safer.”
“Ok, I should get back to the tent and help mom with the rest of the unpacking,” Ginny said trying not to sound hurt and disappointed. Harry hated hurting anyone but his mind was such a jumble at the moment he needed some alone time to try and sort it out.
“You’re very right Mrs. Malfoy,” Barnes agreed.
Harry awoke the next morning after a fitful night of sleep. He had had several nightmares and was still feeling drained when he crawled out of bed. Ron and Hermione were already awake and Hermione was busy in the kitchen of the tent making breakfast for them. Harry smelled the eggs and toast coming from the kitchen and walked in, taking a seat at the small table.
“We are late Mr. Malfoy. Get moving!” Ramirez called into the tent again. Draco had been wracking his brain trying to think of a way to get out of the exam or have it done here. He was just starting to feel better since Potter had been away all day at the Castle telling his side of events to the investigators. Since his return to the tent several hours ago the pain in his chest had been slowly ebbing down to a barely there ache. Unfortunately, he was not able to come with anything and now he could only hope this would not take long. He was trying hard to keep his anxiety in check so it would not translate to Potter.
“Arthur, I think it’s time we go back to the tent,” Mrs. Weasley said grabbing her husband’s hand and heading for the door. She paused her hand reaching for the knob, she looked at Draco, who took a small step back and then turned back to Harry.
Harry wasn't sure he liked the attention and praise. He simply tried to do what was right and asked or expected of him. Frankly, he was glad that it was all over, although he wasn't sure what he was going to do now that the all-consuming force in his life was gone. Add to that everything that had just happened between him and Draco and Harry's mind began to spin. It was all too much so soon after defeating Voldemort and losing so many friends and classmates. Sensing Harry's uncomfortableness with the topic he moved on to the next topic at hand.
“Let’s look at the list,” Draco suggested grabbing the parchment from the table that they had been given. They couldn’t agree on any of the items, so they decided just to talk instead.
“Feeling better?” Wilcox asked as Draco emerged. He was preparing some sandwiches.
“Yes Mr. Potter,” Barnes replied with a slightly raised eyebrow. Harry glanced back at the group and then Barnes who nodded and stepped a few feet away to speak with Harry.
“I’m sorry Ginny, I’m just not feeling myself right now. I think I’m going to get to bed and try and sleep,”
“I’ve had worse,” Harry replied with little feeling.
“Oh, um you're welcome Malfoy,” Harry fumbled out, making sure to use his last name instead of his first which had always been how he addressed him but seemed odd to him now. Like that was the past and moving forward they should use first names.
“It just aches now and then. Probably just stress from the past few days is all,” Draco replied not looking at the healer.
With that, the two walked off toward the opposite side of the castle. Barnes directed Harry and Hermione toward the main entrance of the castle. They passed through the entry hall and up the grand staircase and into the Great Hall. There they moved to the left and back till they entered a back room that had been fitted with a desk, table, several chairs. Parchment covered the desk and a neat stack was also on the table. Inspector Barnes seated himself and motioned for the two of them to take the chairs across the table from him.
It was when the snatchers had brought Luna Lovegood to Malfoy Manor that he truly began to change his thinking. Luna, a relation of his by some distance, was a sweet, intelligent and caring person that had done nothing to anyone. She was being used to coerce her father into providing information to the Death Eaters. It was at this time that Draco began to change his thinking. He rarely slept and would sneak off to the library and read up on Dark Wizards of the past. A few times he came across parallels to the Muggle world which he also researched. He was astounded at how an idea could destroy so many if peddled by the wrong sort. Some may think it odd that Draco would help Harry in the battle but he knew that if he and his family had any chance of living then Voldermort had to be destroyed. Sadly, sitting in this tent was his consequence for being in line with the Dark Lord.
“Is there anything we can do to minimize the risk but keep them in this state?”
“Yes, Mr. Malfoy you are a low-risk detainee. IMF has been investigating the Voldemort situation for the past month and has gathered a great deal of information on his supporters and their trespasses,” Inspector Barnes explained. “For now, you can go with Inspector Wilcox to the barracks that have been constructed for this purpose on the Quidditch pitch.
“I wish I did Harry,” she replied looking from the door to him. Wilcox stepped forward at this time letting Narcissa know she could take a seat since they would all be there till he returned.
Harry and he were in a precarious state and to leave them as such would be dangerous, especially if they were trying to keep them apart. There was a way to break the bond, however, it was a very complex process that required both parties to submit to the breaking, but it could only be done once the bond had been initiated. Sadly, he knew that no one would listen to him about any of this. He only hoped that they would abide by the healer and keep them as close as possible.
“Him? There is no way that Harry is bonded to that pompous prat!” she spat. Harry saw the anger cross over Draco’s face at her words but quickly regaining his composure.
“I quite agree, that wouldn’t be fair. Perhaps just Mr. Weasley could visit and relay back to the others. Despite his and my husband’s spats, he is the more sensible of them.” Narcissa said her tone flat as she tried to keep the condescension that would have previously laced her response.
Harry felt relieved and it bothered him how much Draco’s welfare weighed on him. Perhaps it was his “hero complex” that some insisted he had. He knew he had a lot to work out over the next few days to weeks and it wasn’t going to be easy. Unconsciously his hand moved back to his chest, the dull ache back again.
“Sexual nature?” he exclaimed finding his voice. He looked from Pomfrey to Narcissa to Draco, his heart beginning to race. He felt naïve and stupid that he hadn’t thought of this, of course the bond would pull them together not just romantically but also sexually. It also frightened him to the core. He had only kissed two girls before. Unlike most teenage boys he had spent the last few years looking over his shoulder and trying to stay alive, sex had not been high on his list of concerns.
“Keep them as close as possible and within sight of each other as much as possible.”
“I don’t know. I was asleep and suddenly I was woken up by this wave of anxiety and fear,” Harry babbled. “But it wasn’t mine. I was like it was from outside me but it was still affecting me. And my chest. It hurts so much. It hasn’t been this bad before.”
Turning their attention back to Draco they walked into the other exam room. Ramirez was at attention as soon as she saw Barnes walk in with the others.
“Oh I'm almost certain it has, but from what little Professor McGonagall has told me, you are still a talented young wizard that has accomplished much for someone your age,” Investigator Barnes smiled again at Harry.
“Yes,” he whispered ashamed of himself, assured that he had lost his biggest support in one word.
“How are you doing my dear?” She asked smiling, but Harry could see the energetic glint in the eye was not there.
“He left early to meet with Inspector Barnes and then home to help with the funeral arrangements,”
I would like to apologize to everyone for the long delay in the update. Life had been a bit of a whirlwind but I wanted to get going on this again. I missed writing this fic since the story has been rolling over and over in my head during my break. I also want to thank those have stuck with me as well.
They all jumped when they heard rustling behind them. They looked over to see Mrs. Weasley standing in the doorway to one of the bedrooms.
“It’s Potter!”
“Mrs. Weasley, please, I’m tired of fighting and hate. I know this isn’t ideal, and I’m asking a lot of you even after you and your family have given me so much, but please can we please be civil? At least until we figure this out,” Harry said, getting up and going to her. She seemed to be thinking over everything, but her expression was quickly softening. “I can’t bear to lose anyone else, please.” Harry had tears welling in his eyes, as did Mrs. Weasley. With a swift movement, she enveloped Harry in a hug, both crying.
“I agree with the Headmistress,” Barnes interjected, wanting to stem this newest verbal altercation. I’ll send for Narcissa Malfoy presently. He then swept out of the room, mumble something to another royal blue-robed wizard and swept back in. “She should be here in just a few minutes. Perhaps we can now get somewhere with this.”
“How could we possibly trust anything she would tell us? She could harm Harry.” McDaniels continued.
“I know this is a lot to take in. Two days ago you were sworn enemies fighting each other and now you are bonded, and we are asking all kinds of personal questions. Know that the bond you have with Draco is very intuitive, it will not progress faster than you can handle,” she said laying her hand on his.
“Sure.” Wilcox got up from his chair and headed into his bedroom, closing the door behind him.
Everyone arrived and greeted Harry warmly, completely ignoring Draco except for Hermione and Mr. Weasley. They sat down at the table, Harry making sure that Draco was on one side of him and Ginny ended up on the other side of him. Harry didn’t mind at first, but she soon began to flirt with him, subtly at first with innocently touching his arm or rubbing his shoulder. By the end of dinner, she had placed her hand on his leg several times, and he had brushed it away each time. Harry was becoming very uncomfortable with her behavior but didn’t want to cause a scene. He also felt a sense of anger that he knew was coming from Draco.
The Patronus returned a few minutes later letting her know the rooms were ready and the guards in place.
“Can you be sure?”
“What do you mean?” Healer McDaniels asked folding his arms across his chest. He clearly was defensive with his lack of knowledge.
“I’ve looked after this boy since the day he arrived at this school and I would have found a way to be here even if someone else had volunteered,” She responded making Ramirez’s neck muscles tighten with irritation. “Now, have a seat Mr. Malfoy, this won’t take long at all. I just have to run some basic diagnostic spells on you to make sure you weren’t hit with any stray spells or curses you may not have realized.
“Harry! What’s wrong?” Hermione asked jumping up from the couch and going over to him. Ron followed close behind.
“Excuse me?” Barnes replied being caught off guard.
“Well let’s all go to Madame Pomfrey’s office. We are going to have a lot of things to discuss.”
I've finally decided on a course for this and now it's a matter of having time to write between work and school. I am hoping to be able to post more over the holidays with some time office.
“Morning Hermione. Where’s Ron?” Harry asked sitting down.
“I think you’re right Madame Pomfrey, and I’ll be here to monitor the house arrest. IMF is estimating at least six months to get through the investigation and hearings for those involved as well as assist in the rebuilding of Hogwarts. Mrs. Malfoy would you join me in speaking to Draco and Harry? Headmistress I’ll be by your office in the morning to see about the floo to the Ministry and then we can all meet for breakfast and begin testing this bond.”
“Calm down Molly, I assure you he is the one Harry is bonded-“ Pomfrey said before being cut off by Molly Weasley.
For the next two hours, Madame Pomfrey and Narcissa tested the Harry and Draco’s bond and found that separation into another closed room for about 15 minutes was the maximum that the bond would allow before symptoms would begin to happen. For Harry it was chest pain and tightness. Draco seemed to have stomach upset and nausea. They did not push the bond further and immediately brought the boys back together once both became symptomatic. Surprisingly, Draco was the first to have symptoms.
“Its Harry,” Molly said looking worried.
Harry’s mind was spinning after Madame Pomfrey and Healer McDaniels left the room. Bonded? How is that possible? Who could it possibly be? He would know very soon as they had gone to get them from the other room. He didn’t have long to wait for the door to Madame Pomfrey’s office was already opening. First through was healer McDaniels followed by Madame Pomfrey and Inspector Barnes. It seemed as if time was in slow motion. Then the fourth person in the group stepped through the door. Draco Malfoy! Harry’s heart felt like it stopped and his breath caught in his throat. This couldn’t be possible. It couldn’t be Draco. He looked so different. He still moved with an elegant grace and held himself with a rigid posture. He was, however, in Muggle clothing which had a great impact on his appearance. He didn’t look so cold and forbidden. He looked into Draco’s grey eyes as he scanned the room and detected a wave of fear cross over them. Harry realized that this must be very overwhelming to Draco, being on the losing side of the recent war and now being brought in here facing Harry and his allies. In addition to the Weasleys, there was Hermione and Professor McGonagall. Harry was suddenly brought out of his thoughts by the sound of Mrs. Weasley’s voice.
A knock came at the door before he could say more. McGonagall walked in briskly and motioned Barnes aside. They spoke briefly in whispers and then excused himself before leaving with McGonagall. Harry looked to Draco and Narcissa, but they both seemed to be just as lost as he was.
“Who’s coming to dinner?” Draco asked, sounding a bit concerned.
“I’ve already lost one son to these people, I refuse to lose another!” Molly was now red-faced from anger. She spun back around on Draco. “So, what do you have to say for yourself? I can see it on your face, it’s killing you not to throw some snarky remark. Daddy can’t save you this time.”
“I’m alright dear, it’s just going to take a while,” she responded quietly. “We finished with arrangements much sooner than we expected so we wanted to come see you all and to lend a hand with rebuilding,” She said louder for everyone to hear. “The funeral will be the day after next. George is here too, he’s in our tent just behind yours,” With the mention of the surviving twin the atmosphere in the tent darkened a bit. Hermione got up to check on the dinner and asked Mrs. Weasley come help her. Harry sat down next to Ginny with Ron on the other side of him on the couch. She gently reached out and grabbed his hand. A gesture of comfort, but it did little good. Harry felt the knots return to his stomach at the thought of all those lost in the battle, lives, and families forever changed by the evil that had threatened them. His mind wandered back to Draco, a young man whose family was at the heart of that evil returning. Why can’t I get that boy out of my head?
Harry rose from his chair, thanked Inspector Barnes again and left to return to the tent. His mind raced as he walked back to the tent. Why was he so worried about Draco? He was grateful to Draco for all that he had done for him but it still didn’t explain this feeling that he had to make sure Draco was ok, and an urge to be near him. This had started about an hour ago while still giving his interview with Hermione. He began to get this feeling that he had to go to Draco, be close to him. He couldn’t explain it and it was freaking him out. Barnes telling him that he could see him tomorrow had eased the anxious feeling that had been building a bit but not much.
“Of course, prisoners are to be monitored at all times,” Ramirez replied with a cold look. Draco clearly understood what she was doing, asserting her power and reminding him that it didn’t matter that he wasn’t with everyone else he was still nothing more than a disgusting Death Eater, not worthy of basic privileges like privacy.
“Physical contact of any kind.”
Draco walked into the tent and was surprised by the size and appointments in it. It was by no means any competition for the Manor but it was good sized and comfortable. There was a small nook with a bed, chair, and lamp. Next to that was an open common area with several chairs and a kitchen behind it. On the other side of the common area was another nook with two beds.
“We think we might know what is causing the abnormal readings on you Mr. Malfoy. However, to be certain we need to do some additional testing. This will require some potions be sent from St. Mungos. They will be here within the hour but you’ll have to wait here.”
Her final words hung in the air as both men stared at her. Barnes who had been very quiet up till this point was looking less thrown by the revelation than the other two.
“Something wrong?” McDaniels asked seeing this.
They walked the short distance down the hall to the hospital wing but stopped in front of a door that neither had ever seen before just before the main door. Wilcox waved his wand in an S shaped over the door and another blue light flashed with the door opening. They all walked inside to a large comfortable room. There was an exam area in the corner with a curtain for privacy, a large wooden desk and fireplace along one wall and a sitting area near the fireplace. Narcissa Malfoy and Madame Pomfrey sat at the desk hunched over several parchments.
Thank you for reading and sticking with me on this story. Please leave any comment or suggestions.
“It’s going to be a long day and you both should really eat something more substantial,” Wilcox said looking over his paper and raising a cup of tea to his lips.
“Pomfrey, what is going on?” McDaniels asked once the door was closed.
“Is there anything else?”
“Don’t get a big head, she was the only one willing to do it,” Ramirez cut in. Madame Pomfrey turned to scowl at the woman.
“I apologize for Inspector Ramirez’s behavior,” Barnes said looking at Narcissa and Draco. “We’ve come to talk with you both about how things will happen heading forward.”
“Molly just showed up with Potter looking just as bad as bad as Malfoy. I remember helping her through her bonding with Arthur years ago. She has the same symptoms Malfoy is having, and she believes Potter is going through the same.”
“We can discuss this more with them, but I think returning to Hogwarts would be best. Since we know so little of how this bond is going to act Narcissa and I can be close by and it is familiar to both,” Pomfrey added jumping into the conversation.
“Ginny dear, take it easy. I didn’t bring you along to interrupt while Harry is trying to help the investigation,” Mrs. Weasley scolded as she came up behind.
“Thank you, Draco.”
Harry and Draco had lunch and kept to themselves for most of the afternoon. Inspector Wilcox continued to watch them subtly as he read his book. He had been instructed to try to encourage them to get to know one another rather than staying apart.
“Any developments I should know about?” Barnes asked once the group had gathered.
The group quickly finished dinner and moved to the seating area. Draco sat behind Harry so he could be close without being involved, his mother beside him, and they talked quietly while the others visited. Mr. Weasley informed Harry that Fred’s funeral would be the day after next. They would be sure to work out a plan to get him to the funeral tomorrow. At this, Ginny came into the conversation.
“Well it looks like you have been bonded Mr. Malfoy,” McDaniels stated. Draco let his head fall. “But you already knew that, didn’t you?” Malfoy nodded. “Do you know who you are bonded with?” McDaniels hedged.
“I believe you Molly, but ah it just took me by surprise. I need to get one of the other healers to assist. I’ll be right back,” Pomfrey bustled away to find McDaniels. Once she returned with the healer Barnes had also arrived and she motioned for him to follow her into her office. “We’ll be back in just a moment, Molly.”
Before Draco could say more they heard the latch on the door opening and in a blink of an eye Ramirez’s wand was back in her robes and Draco was left shaking on the table.
“I think he’s been bonded,” Molly practically whispered. Pomfrey paled at these words. Molly not understanding the full gravity of the situation plowed on. “I mean, I can’t be certain Poppy but it’s all the classic signs.”
“Thank you, Harry,” Draco practically whispered. “And I'm sorry.”
“I’m going to need to discuss this development with the Judiciary Panel,” Barnes said breaking Harry from his thoughts. Harry moved a step closer to Draco as they lowered their hands, he was disappointed that he had to let go but he wasn’t sure why. It had been only a few days prior that Draco was his greatest nemesis and now Harry was disappointed he couldn’t continue to hold his hand. It didn’t last long. He felt Draco move closer to him as well, his hand brushing Harry’s, then one deft movement Draco entwined their fingers and squeezed gently. Harry squeezed back letting him know he approved of this.
Barnes looked to Narcissa at Harry’s question. He had completely forgotten about Fred’s funeral and he was sure others that Harry would want to attend. This was definitely a wrench in his plan, but he was foolish to think that he would only need to take them on one outing and then just lock them away till it was safe to tell the world what had happened.
“Then why are you rubbing your chest?” not letting Draco off the hook.
“I agree,” McDaniels said nodding. “And I’ll floo St. Mungo’s immediately and I should have the potions within the hour.
I feel like I have done this on every chapter I write but my apologies. I did not intend for this to languish for so long but life got out of hand. I had some inspiration watching Harry Potter over again and hope to update this. I am working on the next two chapters as this goes up
“I know that most guys my age would be all over the chance to, you know, but it’s just never something I had time to consider or think about. I’ve only kissed two people before,” Harry said not able to look at her.
“Meaning I can’t try and separate them for the first time when Draco needs to face the Judiciary Panel?” Barnes countered in a snarky tone.
Everyone sat down on the couches and chairs of the sitting area, Madame Pomfrey in her usual nurse’s uniform, any remnant of yesterday’s disheveled state gone. Mrs. Malfoy too also looked completely different. Washed up her hair pulled back into a simple updo and a basic black dress and deep purple robe. Even in such simple attire she still had an air of nobility to her.
“Come sit down, we need to go over some things with you.” Wilcox motioned to a chair close to Ramirez, who finally put down her book. She looked put out and irritated. “As you can see Draco you are not being housed with the other detainees but you will be under many of the same rules. Inspector Ramirez and I will be watching over you. You are allowed out of the tent, there is a perimeter that has been set up that will prevent others from entering and you from leaving. That perimeter extends to and includes the tree and rock outside if you wish to sit by them. If you need anything you need to request it of one of us. We will make sure you have basic needs like clothes, food, toiletries, etc but if something else should come up then let us know. Any questions?”
“I think that is all for today. We will pick this up tomorrow,” Barnes said leaning back and looking at the stack of parchment resting on the table now filled with precise writing of the Steno-Quill. He stood, as did Harry and Hermione and shook their hands. “Let’s meet back here tomorrow morning at 9:00 and finish this up?” They both nodded their assent and turned to leave.
“I’m sorry, Harry, dear. I don’t want to lose you either. I felt that’s what was happening.” She kissed his forehead and gave him another hug. “I think we should be going now.” They all gathered their things and headed to the door. Hermione held back.
“It’s about Malfoy…Draco. I’m not asking for special treatment but I’m worried about him. He helped us a great deal in these last few months and in the last moments of the battle. I know there were some wrongs on his part but I believe they were done to save his or his family’s lives. I am not sure he will be safe with the other Death Eaters.” Harry kept his voice low and tried not to hurry his words since he was so nervous. His brow knit in concern. Barnes looked at him appraisingly for a few moments then nodded.
Draco began to feel the fear and anxiety creep up in him again. They knew they had to know. Why else would they be doing all of this workup?
“Yes sir,” Draco responded his voice a bit hoarse.
I would like to apologize for the delay in getting this chapter out. As an avid reader and someone with little patience, nothing is worse than waiting for the next chapter. Work and school have been very busy but I am hoping to get the next chapter out much sooner and have already started on it.
“I’m sorry,” was all Draco could think to say.
“What’s wrong?” Ramirez asked from behind Pomfrey.
“Thank you, Harry.”
“I’ve been doing some reading on bonding. They didn’t give specifics, but it did say that it was possible to break a spontaneous bond like you can with a magically induced bond,” Ginny said in an upbeat tone.
It was finally over thought Harry as he looked out over the destruction of the Hogwarts castle. So many had lost their lives but it was finally done now. Harry’s mind was still spinning trying to wrap his brain around how his life was going to change. His eyes fell on someone with platinum blonde hair and black suit, both very disheveled. His shoulders were slumped looking out over the lake, Harry assumed trying to avoid seeing the destruction wrought by Voldemort and the Death Eaters. Harry felt bad for Draco, his whole world was crumbling around him. Everything he had known was gone. Draco could be the biggest prat on the face of the planet but he still didn’t deserve this. Nor did he deserve the choices he was forced to make over the last few years. Being forced to decide between the safety of his family and doing something you didn’t want to do. Harry could see it in Draco’s eyes when he was in the Room of Requirement. Professor McGonagall was coming towards him, clearly with something important to tell him.
“Thank you, sir. You will let me know as soon as I can though?”
“That would a perfect example,”
Harry grabbed Draco’s hand and smiled at him, assuring him it would be ok. He smiled back, but he wasn’t sure it would be.
“I’m doing ok, how are you, Mrs. Weasley?” Harry asked hugging her back. She had been the only really maternal figure in his life and it killed him to see her having to suffer the loss of one of her children especially since he felt it was his fault.
“It seems that our plan has been completely changed,” Barnes said to the group after settling himself in an armchair. “Justice Harrington no longer feels comfortable rushing Draco’s hearing and wants to complete all interrogations before granting a hearing date. This means that leaving the Castle for the funerals is going to be greatly complicated. I’ve asked Madame Pomfrey to prepare a private exam area and tomorrow morning she and Mrs. Malfoy will work with you both to see what the limits of this bond is, and I’ll try to figure out how we are going to get you to that funeral Mr. Potter.”
“But sir, I…” Barnes put up his hand stopping her in mid-sentence. She closed her mouth and headed out of the room.
“I see,” said McDaniels that said he only partially believed him. He began waving his wand over Draco and muttering spells pausing at times to take in the information that he was receiving. “Well, I think that is all I need. Madame Pomfrey would you join me in the hall?”
The time passed slowly in mostly silence, occasionally broken by quiet talk between Draco and his mother. Harry had so many questions for both Draco and Narcissa, but he didn’t feel now was the time. Perhaps it was their pureblood, high society upbringing but both seemed very unapproachable and distant. It may also have been their chosen side’s recent loss in the second wizarding war. Harry could only imagine what was going through their heads. After what seemed like hours but was probably only 45 mins, Barnes and McGonagall returned.
“What happened in the Room of Requirement?” Narcissa asked looking a little worried.
“Everything alright?” Hermione asked keeping her tone bright.
“Oh, and Mr. Malfoy, if you pull that curtain, you will find a bathroom appears for you,” Wilcox called across the tent from his chair. Draco nodded and pulled the curtain around him.
She crossed to Draco in three steps and wrapped her arms around him, pulling him in tight for a hug. This surprised everyone including Draco, the others since she seemed like a cold woman, and Draco since he was certain her question meant her disapproval.
“I’ll have St. Mungo’s send over more potion for me but I’ll use what I have to examine Malfoy first, by then the rest of the potions should be here from St. Mungo’s. Do we have another exam room for Potter?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Do you have any idea who it could be with?” Pomfrey asked still in shock. Spontaneous bonds were incredibly rare, and to have only partially initiated even more so.
“It’s alright but you should really try to stop stressing. Voldermort is dead and we are handling the Death Eaters. You need to concentrate on healing and being there for your friends,” Barnes rested his hand on Harry’s shoulder giving it a gentle squeeze. Harry looked down feeling tears stinging at the corners of his eyes. He knew Barnes was right but without a mission or a problem to focus on, he would be forced to face his feelings which he had suppressed for so long.
“A bit fitful but I’m alright. Sorry to be short, I’m just stressed about everything left to do.”
“Minerva? You can’t possibly be alright with this?” Mrs. Weasley turned to the Headmistress trying to find an ally in this.
“We weren’t sure if it was safe or not but we didn’t realize that is was so dangerous to them,” Barnes defended himself although he paled a bit. He wanted no harm to come to either boy.
“Did your reading happen to mention the consequences of breaking the bond?” Narcissa asked her tone clipped.
Draco wasn’t hungry but he knew he needed to eat to regain his strength. It was not going to be easy in the coming days and weeks for him.
Harry finished his breakfast and cleaned and dressed. He was still moving pretty sluggish when he heard a tapping at the tent flap. Inspector Barnes walked in wearing his royal blue robes and looking refreshed.
They walked across the green lawn marred with black marks from stray spells hitting the grown. The afternoon was bright and sunny with a gentle breeze. Harry looked around him taking in the destruction around him contrasted with blossoming flowers and chirping birds. All of the casualties had been removed and royal blue robed wizards were hurrying around collecting evidence, cleansing areas of residual dark magic, and interviewing survivors. As he continued to walk with Hermione and Barnes, he heard someone call out his name. He turned to see someone running towards him. He turned to see a flash of red hair streaking towards him, then suddenly a body was pressed against him their arms wrapped around him.
“Potter this is chief investigator Maxwell Barnes from the justice division of IMF,” McGonagall said as she neared. Investigator Barnes smiled at Harry and nodded.
“I’m sorry Narcissa, we didn’t mean to put them in harm’s way. I would never knowingly place anyone especially my students in danger,” Madame Pomfrey cut in looking genuinely concerned.
“Something the matter?” Wilcox asked.
Draco followed behind Inspector Wilcox as he led him down behind the castle and instead of veering to the right to the remains of the Quidditch Pitch where the dorm-style housing had been hastily constructed, he veered left toward the lake. Draco followed, not saying anything for the moment. They continued walking, taking an indirect path, staying close to the forest then finally moving into the clearing to a small tent near the edge of the forest.
“So, even though we are complete opposites, there is something about our magic that is similar and bonded?” Harry asked confused.
“How long do we have to figure this out?” McGonagall cut in.
“Of course. Tomorrow will be longer than today. I have a lot more questions and gaps to fill in after Voldermort’s return so I imagine he will be free about the same time you are.”
Draco slid closer to Harry, pulling him in close and wrapping his arms around him. There was so much he wanted to say to him but felt that it was best, for now, just to stay quiet. Harry allowed the embrace, feeling a sense of comfort and safety he had never felt before, feeling that he never imagined would come from Draco Malfoy. Harry slid his hands around Draco and pulled the embrace closer. They stayed like this in comfortable silence for about ten minutes before Harry pulled back and looked up at Draco. He gave a wane smile and continued telling him about his childhood still wrapped in Draco’s arms.
“Ramirez, you can return to the tent with Wilcox and I’ll look after Mr. Malfoy from here,” Barnes said with a reassuring smile on his face, seeing her shocked look. Nodding she left the room. “Mr. Malfoy, it’s good to see you again. Healer McDaniels and Madame Pomfrey asked me to be here for their final diagnostics, is that ok with you?” Malfoy nodded his accent.
“Um, yes I was, ah hoping that maybe I could visit him?” Harry asked not looking at Barnes and stumbling over his words.
Draco gave Harry a smile half smile, but with none of the usual sneer that always used to lace his smirks toward him. Draco reached up and gently rubbed his chest a bit. The gesture made Harry realize the ache in his own chest. Before he could say anything more he heard footsteps coming towards them. Harry turned to see who was coming. McGonagall approached with a man walking next to her, a royal blue robe flowing around him and a bright official seal embroidered on the left chest. He was tall with jet black hair and tanned skin; his posture ram rod straight.
“It's nice to finally meet you, Mr. Potter, he said putting out his hand to shake.
“Let’s go Mr. Malfoy!” Inspector Ramirez called from outside the tent in her stern no-nonsense voice. Inspector Wilcox looked at Draco as he flinched hearing the sharp voice cut through the silence of the tent. He gave Draco a sullen look that seemed to say I know you don’t want to but she’s not playing around. Draco sighed and slowly got up from the couch to head outside. He had changed out of the sweater he had been in earlier and instead had put on a tee shirt and a hoodie with a logo from a Muggle store called Abercrombie & Fitch. Draco had never worn Muggle clothing before but he was fast becoming a fan. Everything he had been given had been comfortable except the sweater earlier that had been very scratchy. He was also wearing a pair of bootcut jeans in a dark wash and a pair of black and blue cross trainers.
“I think it would be best to turn in early. We have another long day tomorrow,” Wilcox said hesitantly. Both nodded their agreement and went to their room. They each changed and slipped into bed with the drapes open, neither saying anything.
“Yes, I can definitely help you both navigate this,” Narcissa replied seeing the worry on Harry’s face. “I know this must be overwhelming for you both considering your history, but know that any spontaneous bonds are formed between wizards with compatible magical signatures.”
“I’m surprised they were able to spare you for my silly exam,” Draco said with a slight smile on his face.
“Thank you.”
“I... I don’t know what you are talking about,” Draco stammered sliding back on the table trying to keep the distance between them. His heart was racing and his head was spinning. What the hell was this woman’s problem?
“Crabbe unleashed a Fiendfyre that he couldn’t control, it quickly consumed the room. Ron, Hermione and I found brooms and were heading out when I saw Draco and Goyle clinging to a pile of thing, I made Ron go back and I picked up Draco and he picked up Goyle. We made it out just in time.” This was the first time Harry had spoken since initially learning of the bond.
“Yes, sir,”
Draco was struggling to keep his composure through this discussion. He hated being talked about like he wasn’t even there or a child. He also wanted to fill in their gaps in knowledge about bonding. For centuries the pureblood families had worked to understand and manipulate both magically induced and spontaneous bonds. It was crucial to continuing the great pureblood lines and to garner political clout. Arranged marriages were common then and bonds were used to assure these marriages remained strong. They also needed to overcome the spontaneous bonds that could lead purebloods to marry half-bloods or worse muggles. The family that is the guardians of this secret knowledge were the Blacks, whom Draco’s mother was a member of. She had passed down much of this knowledge to Draco over the years. He had assumed that over the centuries other wizards had also figured this information out, but it was clear they had not.
“Wait here,” Ramirez commanded. Draco stood with his hands in his pockets as Ramirez stepped inside, speaking softly to one of the nurses who looked at Draco then nodded and walked away inside. “This way,” Ramirez motioned him inside and then to the right. Draco had always assumed that this was a storage room but when he walked in there was a small room with a counter, and wall cabinet on one wall and a desk and chair opposite. In the center was an exam table. Ramirez motioned for Draco to get up on the table.
“Actually, yes sir, I had wanted to ask you about Draco…” Harry asked, trailing off, hoping that his inquiry wouldn’t be met with scorn or suspicion. Barnes gave a half smile and motioned for him to take a seat.
The group waited in silence for the arrival of Narcissa Malfoy. Draco was eager to see his mother, see she was alright but he was very nervous at her reaction once she found out what had happened. Would she disown him? His father certainly would. His mind swirled with some many thoughts and emotions. In addition to his thoughts about his mother and his family he desperately wanted to know Potter’s thoughts at the moment. He had been sitting quietly with no emotion on his face. Was he happy, angry, or maybe sad about this? His stomach knotted thinking about what would happen if his family rejected him and Harry too. He had so much to atone for with Harry and his friends, he just hoped that he would be given the chance.
“Like I said, I need some potions to do more in-depth testing, and I’ll be requesting them from St. Mungo’s but I’m almost certain. It fits with his complaint of the chest pain as well.”
“No, we have just gotten through the exams,” Pomfrey replied.
“I didn’t say that. I said it was unsafe since the bond is in an unstable state. It could be unsafe. It’s just that no one has any experience with this. They appear to be suffering no ill effects at the moment but that could change quickly.”
“Mr. Malfoy, I’m Healer McDaniels. Madame Pomfrey tells me that you had some odd readings on your diagnostics. From what she’s told me I think it best I run a few more tests on you. Are you ok with that?”
“You’re certain?”
“I know but I think that it is probably for the best. It will be good to get everything out. No more secrets.”
“We’ve been doing some research this morning before you arrived,” Narcissa began with a look that showed they had learned little about the boys’ condition. “Inspector Jankowski,” she nodded her head to the corner by the desk where a man sat in a chair that neither had noticed, “has got a list of all of the texts from the manor that maybe of help. They will be acquired by an IMF official and screened. That should take about two days, but we can continue to work without them for the time being.”
“Well, its been going on since the battle ended,” Harry looked sheepishly.
“Nothing, just don’t want to be playing babysitter for this whole investigation is all,” Ramirez spat, he contempt flowing freely. Wilcox features darkened but he did not respond to her.
“I’m sure you are,” Ramirez rolled her eyes. “Let’s get moving.”
“The same for me, you know how protective of my student,” McGonagall added. Narcissa’s face softened at these words.
Draco sat tense on the edge of the exam table hoping that these diagnostics would not give her any indication of what was happening within him Being from a pureblood family he had been taught a great deal about bonding, both spontaneous and magical since bonding was a way for families to become dynasties, merging power and money to grow stronger. Draco couldn’t be certain but he was very sure that the symptoms he was experiencing were from a partially initiated bond. It occurred when Harry had grabbed him in the room of requirement, saving him from the FiendyFire. Being that both of them were under such immense stress and emotion the bond could not fully initiate.
“Why . . . who does the whole wizarding world trust with such a thing?" His mother had her brows raised high and used her arms to form wide gestures, clearly putting on a show for the two men. "Who is it that stands for everything Gryffindor and Dumbledore and light?” she asked them.
“Fine,” Draco sighed. “I am simply bored. Tell me a story.”
“Jamie!” Draco gushed. “Oh my god, you look great! When did you start?”
After a freak out of mass proportions, in which Dobby attempted to brain himself on the table, Draco finally managed to get the thing to shut its Gods-awfully loud trap.
Draco scowled harder. Fucking Potter!
Draco, sure he was doing it wrong, couldn’t really bring himself to care for once in his life. Potter’s cock rested inside Draco; the weight of his testicles were warm against Draco’s arse, his breath wet against Draco’s cheek, and Draco loved it.
“You would see Draco as a squib all because you couldn’t handle to make a logical decision over one your pitiful gut is aching about?” she finished.
"Right . . ."
“Gone this far?” Hermione asked weakly, not liking where it seemed this was heading.
"Who are you upset with then?" she wanted to know.
Ron actually found that kind of interesting. He never could picture Harry being so intimate with someone. Ron and Hermione had discussed the strangeness of the idea on multiple occasions since they'd found themselves intimate with each other.
Well, the entire hall may have sparked with chatter at that point, but Harry found himself stuck in the blinking stage of processing this new information. He felt as if everything he had ever learned was a lie. Harry felt manipulated, cheated, and wronged. Across from Harry, Ron grinned manically with a gleam of pure amusement in his eye. Harry could only blink back at his best mate.
“Potter . . . that’s . . .”
"At least she didn't tie you to your bed this time," Luna offered and Draco nodded solemnly.
Draco should have known better.
It was Theo, who looked a massive wreck, but this was nothing new.
“Could you answer my question now, do you think?”
I was born for this, Draco thought, and I won’t ever stop again.
?!” To Draco’s immense relief, Granger was looking just as horrified as Draco felt - and she was wearing something almost as revealing and much tighter.
“You and Mr. Malfoy have engaged in unprotected sexual intercourse, Mr. Potter. Now there is a possibility Mr. Malfoy may be pregnant. If he takes the potion to change him back without knowing for sure, there could be undesirable consequences. Mr. Malfoy had the choice to simply take another potion, one that would safely end any pregnancy that may have started; therefore, leaving him free to change back anytime. Mr. Malfoy, however, has decided to ask your advice.”
Draco allowed himself to be kissed and manipulated into a more comfortable position. Potter once again thrusting their clothed hips together and for the first time Draco really truly missed his own manhood. Draco broke their kiss as he dropped to his knees, eager to expose Potter’s thickness now that he’d been shown the kind of attention he craved. If he simply wanted punishment, Draco had plenty of his father for that. No, Draco thought as he felt Potter’s weight in his palm, he wanted something else entirely out of this partnership.
“Good.” Draco placed the jelly-legged elf on his bum. “Now, you may breathe, but if you get us caught in here, I swear to the Gods that not even my father will be able to save you. I will . . . will . . . stab you to death, Dobby!”
“Yeah.”
Four days later, when Draco was writing in the garden, his father approached but froze for a long moment and scrutinized the journal in Draco’s hands. The look on his father's face was more than enough to snap Draco out of whatever stupor he’d been in and alert him to the enormous size of his own cock up.
Ron pulled out Harry's chess set from under the coffee table. He poured out some pieces to set up but paused with his hand raised as a thought popped in his head. "Ginny," Ron said slowly. "She's not . . ."
Everything was Potter's fault, naturally.
Yes, Draco thought, he should never try to comfort a human being, but his pitiful effort seemed to have some effect on Dobby the horrible house elf. “Master Draco really be thinking that?” he wanted to know.
“Right. Yes. I am one. Often.”
“Oh, whatever,” Harry said, and Ginny and Draco exchanged a panicked glance. “Either I wear this or I don’t go at all—“
“Where?”
“Then let’s go.”
“You mean that?” Draco asked, somewhat awed by Potter’s emotional depth. He had never let so much vulnerability show in front of Draco before, let alone that he had an emotionally accomplished mind. Draco was used to the righteous anger from Potter, but even Goyle had been capable of that. Draco might have been interested in the offer of more, if that's what was on the table.
“Sasha, isn’t it?” Draco asked the bouncer. She nodded. “I’m Draco. Luna’s friend, remember?”
Draco failed to mention that this plan gained himself more spoils than anyone else - literally if the dragon might reward him for his genius.
“Well, come on then,” Draco sighed falling to the floor to put his own slippers on. He explained some things as he laced them up. “I will show you the routine first. We’ll have you in your toe slippers after warmups, though I am still far from full time, so we will switch soon after that. Do not worry about long term damage. You are right in assuming that spells will sort you out. However, that is no reason to over exert yourself, Granger, like you are wont to do, I’m sure. Jean will not tolerate it though. You will be cut loose, understand?”
. . ? His father continued a moment later. "If she did not . . . I still fear you and I would never speak again."
took me by surprise.”
Already feeling the effects, Draco just smirked and pushed Harry back a few inches, so he could slide around the bigger man. “Where’s your sense of adventure, Harry Potter?” Draco drawled as he left the bathroom.
"I think you have seriously underestimated the amount of attention Draco actually requires to survive," he drawled at last and though Harry couldn't have heard him, in that moment he was learning the truth behind Zabini's statement.
Draco moaned Harry’s name over and over, unable to help himself, and not truly wanting to stop either. Harry’s movements grew bolder with every gasp of his name, and soon Draco found his face pressed against the cool metal of the stall with Harry a pressing and groping presence against his backside. Thick hands worked diligently, one grabbing Draco’s hair to bare his neck, the other slipping inside his trousers and parting his arse cheeks.
“It allows me to determine how palpable your chromosomes are used to behaving.”
His best mate only stared back at him, looking as haunted as one would expect of somebody who was just virtually sexually-harassed by Malfoy.
"Sod off, Loony!" Theo sneered.
“No,” Harry said, and he really wasn’t. He was a little confused and still trying to process the fact, but he wasn’t upset.
Two hours later, Draco sat scowling at a plant. His glare was so toxic, the flowers were beginning to welt. Let’s just say, Draco’s appearance did not provoke the reactions one wishes for. The best greeting Draco received was from pole-up-the-arse Percy, and that spoke for itself really.
“What, Malfoy, squeamish this time, are we?”
“At least you had a chance at something real,” Harry said. “Every person I take home acts crazy about me then squeezes their eyes shut as soon as I take off my shirt.”
"Hoped?" Draco asked with a flat tone.
"You faithful competitor," Draco mumbled, sealed the letter and called Medea, his owl.
"I do not like girls,” Draco said, as he slouched further into his large leather chair. Draco didn't feel smart.
“I guess, yeah,” Harry shrugged. “Most fit people want someone as fit as they are.”
Sighing, Draco left his patient waitress a large tip and went home.
Harry walked to the back door, and muttered the countercharm to Malfoy’s cursed lock. A spell that had been easy enough to find after hearing Malfoy utter it a few times. He strolled straight toward the bathroom only pausing to throw his cloak across the back of Malfoy’s couch.
“I was looking for a book.”
“Well, of course, I am an exception to most ideals as I easily exceed them. And I have a better leg line than you do, so . . .”
“Lesbian love,” Draco said with a snicker. “And assorted fruits.”
“You're just saying that because you're already drunk, Malfoy!”
His father seemed genuinely curious, but Draco couldn’t process what that could mean beyond his crushing embarrassment and real panic. So, he snapped, a bit, “yes, and it is a wonder why I am unable to properly communicate with another human being.”
Draco laughed aloud, wondering which of the flamboyant boys had managed to scare off the man who’d defeated the Dark Lord.
“No, no I like it. I do,” Draco assured and handed Harry his satchel.
Even after Malfoy slid into the seat next to Pansy and poured himself a glass of water, the hall was completely silent and motionless. It wasn't until Snape groaned out loud did the entire hall blink as one unit and process what the fuck they just witnessed.
“Me,” he barked and strode toward the barre. She joined him shortly after, mimicking his motions in silence. Draco eyed her legs as they left the barre and worked through the positions. “Jean is not going to like your lack of holes,” he commented.
With flourish, Malfoy tossed his head back and began to stroke. Harry didn’t know where to settle his eyes, not wanting to miss any part of Malfoy’s lean body as it began to writhe against the smooth porcelain. After he memorized every plane, Harry grew impatient to see more and said, “how you normally do it.”
“Don’t you have something a little less . . . wrinkled?” Draco asked. “And I know you’re self-conscious of your weight, but, honestly, wearing clothes three sizes too large does not make you look any smaller, Harry.”
His father scowled at him and gestured at his slumping form. "Now, we will keep up propriety, Draco . . . and I hope you do not think this acceptance will keep you from your obligations to this family . . ."
“Hey!” a drunk man had made his way next to Draco. “I want my keys back!”
With that wisdom, Draco scurried toward the bathroom.
“Not legally, no.”
“Well, master Draco, sir, Dobby be wanting to help. Dobby is knowing bad, bad thing and be wanting to escape--”
“Yes!” Draco nodded enthusiastically.
Draco sighed and looked at Potter who stood some meters away. The other boy was naked, too.
"Do you think he's wearing like--y'know?" Harry asked them finally.
“I don’t think Harry really likes me,” Draco said once he had enough liquid courage. “I mean, obviously, I know I can be rude, but I really felt victimized in there and he didn’t stick up for me at all.”
“What the hell?!” Potter panted. “Something just . . . shocked me.”
“How is that relevant?” Draco demanded hotly.
“What happened?”
“Mal-Malfoy.” Draco rolled his eyes, but she peaked his interest when she continued. “You
“Why?!” Ginny’s concern was shown in her widening eyes. “Why did you stop?”
Draco regarded the creature, wondering what he should do. His father hated Dobby because Dobby wasn’t really like the other Malfoy elves; he always spilled things or started crying at the worst times, and he never could learn how to speak correctly, which made him a bad influence on Draco. However, his father would never condone Draco stabbing one of his house elves like a drunken muggle would.
“N-no” Draco mumbled as he felt Potter turn towards the direction opposite of the 8th year common rooms. Lifting a frail hand, he pointed towards the once abandoned corridor, that now held the common room for all of the many returning students.
When Blaise confronted him about it, he knew it was time to stop, he couldn’t let his feelings for Potter rule his life. So he married Astoria a couple months later and only had a couple of male partners each year. He knew that there was no way Potter could ever feel
Draco nudged Harry with his shoulder and Harry looked up at him. Draco flicked his eyes upward and smirked. Harry followed his line of sight to see a bundle of rapidly growing mistletoe hanging on a beam above them. He chuckled and sat up. He kissed his husband of 7 years softly, and could feel Draco smiling into the kiss.
“You’re just too embarrassed to admit it,” Mona said, shaking her head fondly. “But if any man looked out for me and cared for me the way Potter does to you, I’d ask him out right away,”
“Harry?” Draco tilted his head back, and due to his state it simply flopped back rather awkwardly. His eyes were half lidded as he stared up at Harry, before he began to succumb to sleep once more.
After the war, Harry and Ginny both realized that they loved each other like brother and sister, and parted mutually as friends. In fact, their past relationship was often brought about as a joke, and Ron liked to tease that Harry turned Ginny gay. But everyone knew that Ginny and Luna fit better together than Harry and Ginny ever could, and Harry was quite relieved at that. He realized that he had used Ginny as a way to be legally apart of the Weasley family. When he and Ginny broke up, he apologized extensively for this, and Ginny with her fierce temper was mad at him for using her, but understood his reason.
, Draco thought as he looked at the dull and simple garlands that were strung across the lampposts in Muggle London.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes! Bless Merlin we did,” Draco began to tell her about the discovery Potter had told him and Smith- when a great shiver suddenly wracked through his body- and everything began to feel very cold.
Draco’s class ended and he had an hour before his next class. He decided to go check to see how Harry was fairing with Scorpius. He walked into Harry’s classroom and was met with a group of giggling and whispering 6th years.
“You owe me 2 galleons Seamus!”
Scorpius soon fell asleep again, Harry assumed from the excitement of his first day at the castle, and Harry picked up his sleeping form. He held Scorpius huddled into his chest as he sat down and leaned back in his chair. He fell asleep eventually as well, calmed by Scorpius’ quiet breathing and occasional snores.
Draco had said, and Potter had beamed so greatly that the street lamps seemed to dim beside him. Draco had rolled his eyes, and Potter then proceeded to sit them down at a table together, knocking their feet under the table and laughing obscenely through a mouthful of curry while they talked about Quidditch or school- Draco couldn’t really remember. All he had remembered was the warm feeling that had pooled in his gut- that wasn’t solely from the hot chicken curry they were eating from tin containers. When he had returned from lunch, he had ignored the comment that his co-worker Mona had made about the blush that had settled on his cheeks, glaring as she chuckled.
“You can’t keep thinking about the what-ifs, Harry, or else you won’t get anywhere,” Ron placed a hand on his shoulder, “Mate, you need to tell him how you feel. Then, he won’t be worried about you pushing him away,” Harry breathed deeply and leant back on the couch.
None of which could be said in the same way for Smith. In all the time they had worked together, Draco was certain that there was not one look Smith had given him that was not full of disgust, anger, or both.
“Being right for once, must be a first for you,” Harry grinned mockingly and Draco had to hold back a second eye roll. “Here Potter, take him, he’s distracting for my students”
“Then enjoy cracking the nonexistent mystery that is the cause of my sighing,” He told her, floating the teapot over to Mona’s desk so she could refill her own mug.
“One for the books, yeah?” she said to Pansy, smiling at the couple.
Draco had visited the Weasley’s at Christmas one or two times for Teddy’s sake, but Scorpius hadn’t joined him. So Molly Weasley welcoming him and Scorp like
Luna+Ginny = Amaryllis (adopted)
Draco adjusted Scorpius on his hip.
. Draco thought. Theo took Scorpius from Draco and held him.
“Silence!” she cried and everyone stopped talking at once. “Though I believe we are all very happy and
“Yes, but it’s different now, what if they think I’ve given you a love potion?” Harry snorted.
“Alright.”
Draco flicked his wand and the equations he had planned out for his 6th years transferred onto the board. Draco ran a hand through his hair. He kept it short and without product like he had used in school. But despite its length, a few strands always managed to fall in front of his eyes.
“Wait one second,” He stood from his chair and stomped over to his and Draco’s shared door. He opened it slightly and spoke. “Do you care if people know? I don’t!” He shouted. Draco’s back was turned and he was looking at a series of numbers on the board. Scorpius asleep next to him in a floating, enlarged pram. He didn’t say anything but gave a thumbs up without turning around.
A voice muttered in his head and Draco flinched. Potter cocked his head at him in confusion. “Malfoy?” He asked, concern laced in his voice.
Draco’s gaze shifted to his son and he spread out his arms for Scorpius to walk into.
“I love you”
The pixies had flown around the classroom and while Harry managed to immobilize most of them, around five had somehow opened Draco’s door and wreaked havoc on his 5th year class period. Draco had been enraged and that was the day that they decided to set up sound and locking barriers on the door, that only they could get through.
“Just don’t do anything rash, just let him know how you feel,”
“It appears that my son has taken to you, Potter,” drawled Draco and Harry laughed, returning Scorpius to his father’s arms when Scorpius reached out for him. When the rest of the staff and students arrived they took their seats and listened to McGonagall’s annual speech about unity and recovery from loss.
Harry laughed and stood behind Teddy as he raced on his little training broom. Teddy was laughing as he spun in small circles, around two feet off of the ground. Scorpius was giggling and clapping his hands from where he was held in Harry’s arms.
The walk felt like years. And Draco grew so tired that he didn’t even realized he had tucked his head into Potter’s chest. At least, not until the warmth left the side of his face and he was set down gently onto his bed.
Draco’s face remained sullen, not even surprised as he watched the fist come towards him and make contact with his jaw.
“It wasn’t real,” Draco moved his fingers to brush a lock of hair out of Harry’s eyes.
“I know,” Potter said cheerfully, and Draco would strangle him were his hands not occupied.
“Don’t play a fool, Draco, tell him you love him,” Draco’s head shot up but Theo had already left back to the castle, presumably in search of Neville.
with me!” Draco cried. Smith shushed him, but Draco ignored him. “That’s preposterous!”
After several minutes, Ron ended up beating him, and Draco grinned as they shook hands. Scorpius giggled into his chest and Draco stood up, lifting him onto his hip. Draco raised his eyes and immediately found Harry’s across the room. He was smiling at Draco so lovingly that Draco’s heart felt like it was going to burst for a second time.
the roots of this plant are usually used to heal wounds, but if used too much-”
,” Smith growled from his desk. Draco opted to take another sip from his cup, diving into the case file for the investigation. It would be a long time until the end of his shift, Draco thought dismally, holding back a third sigh (for Mona’s sake).
Scorpius went right to him and put his chubby arms around Draco’s neck. Draco picked him up and kissed his son’s temple. Harry wanted to burst with happiness at the sight, for a moment it felt like he was apart of that, like he was in a family with them.
“I’m sorry, Harry, I didn’t mean to leave like that,” Harry smiled at Draco.
“Harry, we’ll love you no matter who you choose to love, you deserve that happiness,” Harry beamed at their words and had enveloped them both into hugs. He felt so loved in that moment, and for the first time after the war, he felt a small shrivel of peace. Two months after that day he was walking into Luna and Ginny’s wedding reception with Justin Finch-Fletchley on his arm.
“I say hi to Teddy too,” Harry told him and Scorpius giggled and clapped his hands. He then waved wildly at Ron whose eyes were wide as he gave Scorpius a little wave.
“I’m gonna go talk to Harry,” Ron said, “Nott, I’m gonna go find Harry, talk some sense into the git, will you?” Theo nodded and Draco rolled his eyes.
“I mean, shared emotional trauma, similar interests, I was surprised it didn’t happen earlier this year,” Pansy explained to the group of huddled third years. “Keep in mind if any of you
“Yes! Rolf got me them when we went to visit Russia, you know they have quite the infestation there in all of their lakes- it’s strange how Muggle-sightings have been so low with them-” Luna proceeded to talk about Grindylows for the next several minutes- Harry occasionally nodding and excitedly adding along what he remembered from his interactions with them during the Triwizard tournament. The firewhiskey in his stomach made him feel giddy and warm- and when he caught Draco’s glance from where he was cracking up over something with Pansy and Theo- he felt the warmth strike through his whole body.
“I know we’ve both fallen for Gryffindors, darling, but you really shouldn’t make it
Draco had been contemplating who to ask, Astoria was out of the question as she was now on her honeymoon with Millie (Scorpius was staying with Andromeda and Teddy while Draco was at Hogwarts), as were Pansy and Blaise because they were visiting Pansy’s cousin in Cairo. He desperately wanted to ask Harry, but would their friendship still stand if Harry said no?
“Hermione, we were not flirting!” He said once they got their tea.
“And a terrible one you will be,” Draco said, smirking. Pansy smacked his arm playfully.
“I dreamt that you died,” Harry whispered, lifting his arms to hug Draco back. “I needed t-to make sure it wasn’t real,” Draco lifted his head and looked at Harry with a small smile.
“Y’know Hermione just came back from Australia, so we’re inviting some of our year over for dinner next Tuesday,” Potter started, “And you’re very much welcome to come,” Potter said casually as they walked. Draco’s heart stuttered in his chest.
Stretching his legs under his desk and frowning, Draco then proceeded to spell his materials back into his bag, mentally preparing for his commute home. He looped his bag over his shoulder, waved a quick goodbye to Mona and Smith (not surprised when only Mona returned it), and headed out the door.
“And besides,” he continued, “You guys are right here in Hogsmeade, and Neville’s with me at the castle. If anything happens, I’ll be fine,” Hermione nodded, but there was still a hint of concern in her eyes.
As the two both settled to sleep in front of the fire, curled around each other, Hermione couldn’t help but snap a photo of the two.
Scorpius woke up around a couple of minutes after Harry took him from Draco. Harry still wasn’t over the look that Draco had given him. His usual stoic and masked face had melted into one of love an adoration, and Harry felt as though he were going to explode from the amount of love he himself felt for that man. Harry luckily didn’t have another class for another 45 minutes or so, so he spent his time playing with the small Malfoy.
The expression was so similar to Draco and Narcissa’s that it was a little frightening, Harry thought. He picked up his tea and sipped it to avoid her narrowing gaze.
had said.
Theo waited until Ron entered the castle again and then turned to Draco.
“Merlin, sorry Malfoy didn’t see you there,” Harry shot out his hands to steady Malfoy’s shoulders when it seemed as though he was going to fall.
Draco’s eyes softened at the sight and he resisted the urge to kiss Harry’s cheek as he left. Harry smiled up at him before going back to his classroom and shutting the door behind him.
“You’re horrid,” He said, and Pansy rested her cheek atop his head.
“ENOUGH!” McGonagall shrieked. Harry and Draco both quieted and stepped away with wide eyes, frightened by her outrage. “You will both either behave like adults and handle this situation lightly or so help me I will give you the boot myself! Am I clear?”
“That sounds like something my mother would've said,” Draco replied, a bit amused. “And I’ve already promised Potter I would- so I must.”
“Oh- yes, Luna, I’m fine,” He said, nodding, “I like your earrings- Grindylows?” He asked, and Luna beamed.
The whole room was immersed in a tumult as people scurried about. And it was when a gunshot was heard that everyone became even more frantic. The lights went out and Draco started when he felt someone grab him. He managed to push them off for a moment before he felt a prick on the back of his neck, and the already dark room faded from his sight.
“Alright, we should tell our families now, yes?”
“You’re not what?” Potter questioned, eyebrows turned up cutely in concern. Draco willed his mind to stop thinking.
Some of the younger students had gasped and turned their heads when they saw Harry Potter holding his past-rival’s son, but most of the older students were aware that he and Draco were far from enemies now and didn’t spare a glance.
“Yet he only did it for you,” Draco sighed and shook his head again.
A couple minutes later, after Draco assumed Potter had left him alone, he heard several footsteps approach his door. He turned his head away from the incoherent murmuring that he could clearly distinguish as Granger, Weasley, and again, Potter.
Harry sighed and let his head fall on his husband’s shoulder. He smiled contently as he felt a hand card through his curls.
They shushed him and pointed to Harry, who was asleep in his chair, with Scorpius on top of him, snoring softly. Draco’s mouth went slightly agape and he walked over to the pair. He slowly lifted Scorpius up and held him in his right arm as he placed his left on Harry’s shoulder.
Harry was waiting for him in the hallway, arms crossed as he leant against the wall. He started when he saw Draco, and gave him a confused look as Draco marched right up to him. Draco tugged on Harry’s jacket, pulling him forward, before kissing him. Harry’s eyes widened, but he soon melted into the kiss, arms coming up to hold Draco’s waist. Draco pulled back and laughed a bit breathlessly.
“Now, Harry, I wonder, it’s been years and yet you nor Draco have attempted any discovery upon to why your classrooms are connected,” Narcissa said, turning to Harry.
, from times he had stayed at Hogwarts with Father and Dad. And not only was that thought mortifying, but many students in his year now knew stories from when he was a toddler (apparently he was an energetic child).
“We’ll figure it out Harry, we’re here for you,”
Draco had been terribly wrong.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Probably rejection,” Ron said. Hermione nodded in agreement.
hunt you down and kill you,”
Harry had figured there was something wrong with Draco ever since the Slytherin had collapsed one day at work. No one was around save for Harry, and Draco had just fallen to the ground in the middle of the hallway, slumped over himself and paler than usual. When Harry checked over him, he seemed to be fine physically save for the shivers wracking through his body. With a determined flush on his face, Harry had wrapped Draco in his cloak and levitated him to the medical ward- not regarding the strange looks he got on the way there.
“You can’t tell Neville, nor Ron,” Draco told him.
“Because- it’s
hope you guys like this one! I had a lot of fun writing it :)) <3
“Uncle Feo!” Theo patted Scorpius’ head awkwardly, he never really was good with children.
“No! No, not at all, just, the classrooms have changed,” Hagrid’s brows stitched together, and he waited for Harry to continue. “The Defense Room, it’s on another floor, totally different from where I remembered it in school,”  Hagrid resumed petting Fang for a moment before responding.
“I really can’t see how it’s your concern,” Draco told her and the witch laughed.
Draco shouldn’t really have been surprised when Potter all but barged into their small office space at 12:03 pm, chewing on what appeared to be a biscuit and holding a book in his other hand.
“Bloody hell Harry this is amazing!” Harry listened to his rambling in silent amusement as Draco scribbled away with the pen. “Why on Earth do we still use those quills? This is self-inking! I swear muggles may not have magic but they’re pretty brilliant to have made something like this!”
There was also Uncle Nev’ who was the Herbology professor, Professor Nott-Longbottom treated him fairly but every now and then he would ruffle Scorpius’ hair. He did it to Amaryllis and Hugo as well but that never stopped the embarrassment. That wasn’t even the end of it. Slughorn had retired when Scorpius was 7, and the new professor hired had come straight out of Hogwarts. Meaning that Professor Walsh remembered him
“What the hell, Malfoy! How could you just bloody leave like that?” Ron said, stepping forward and glaring daggers at Draco. Theo huffed and held up a hand to stop Ron from saying any more.
“Ew! Ew, ew, Mary quick! Shield my eyes!” Scorpius put his hands over his eyes to block the sight and Amaryllis laughed as she threw the nearest blanket over him.
“Yeah, it’s just me Draco, just me,” Draco’s eyes opened a bit more as he looked right into Harry’s face. He let his head fall forward a bit and sloppily placed his lips on the side of Harry’s face in a sluggish kiss. Harry blushed and pushed Draco back gently.
sadly baby scorpius is not in this one either, but he's coming soon I promise! :^)
“I love you,” Draco said and he immediately regretted it. It was far too early in their relationship for him to say it. Sure he had called Harry “love” before, but it was just a term of endearment. Of course Harry didn’t feel the same way.
Hermione noticed his expression and added, “A lot of pureblood marriages are like that, they are only together for power and wealth, but for fun they go to others,” Harry sipped his tea, contemplating this.
Bun was curled up on the kitchen table when Draco arrived home to his flat. He greeted the black cat with a gentle hand to the place between her eyes. She blinked her dark eyes at him in and twitched an ear in response. A chill swept through the apartment, and Draco started a fire up in the fireplace with a flick of his wand. Unfastening his coat, the image of Potter- arms extended and mouth downturned into a pout- flashed through his mind. His fingers clenched the fabric of his coat before he hung it up on the rack.
Although that one class of Slytherin and Ravenclaws had known about their relationship, it had seemingly not spread throughout the entire school yet, or that many just didn’t believe what they had heard.
“You were just
“Oh, I know, love,” She said softly. “Have you gotten anywhere with that narcotic case yet?” Draco grinned and shook his head lightly.
So that night he entered the Great Hall next to Ron, and waited by the staff table for everyone to arrive. Harry was discussing a new formula for Puking Pastilles that Ron was testing when Draco walked in, with Scorpius on his hip. Harry’s words caught in his throat as he looked at the pair. They were both wearing light blue dress robes lined in silver.
“I wanted to make sure you were ok throughout the night, they could’ve hurt you really bad,” Draco’s mouth formed an “oh” shape and he nodded slowly.
Harry let out a breath of relief upon seeing Draco alive, the opposite of his dream. Harry thought he looked peaceful without the familiar glare on his face, childlike even, innocent.
Draco’s office was shared with two other DMLE investigators: Mona Lambard and Zacharias Smith, both of whom hold extremely contrasting personalities, so much so that their interactions were the most common source of his headaches.
Draco shifted slightly in his arms, and Harry realized that his kidnappers had intended for him to wake up soon after they took him.
“Uh, you ok Malfoy?” Potter asked, he stepped forward towards Draco and looked at him with a steady gaze.
obvious,” Pansy whispered to him. She was perched practically on his lap, and Draco didn’t really mind save for when her large platform boots knocked against his shins painfully.
The Muggle garlands shook as the windchill swept through the street, slicing through Draco’s cloak even with a warming charm. It felt impossible to keep warm when even his magic couldn’t help much. Approaching the building, Draco readjusted the bag in his grip with the help of a muttered levitation charm, and reached out a gloved hand for the east-side entrance to the ministry (which appeared to Muggles as a sewing shop that was always closed).  Just as his fingers neared a hair’s width from the door handle, another gloved hand that was not Draco’s own wrapped around it instead. The door was opened for him, and Draco turned slowly to the owner of the gloved hand. Bright green eyes- much brighter than the garlands- Draco noted, were looking at him brightly above a smug grin.
I know that some of these people had more children than were in the story, that’s because one: too many characters I didn’t want it to get two confusing also two: this is an au so :/
“That’s why I have you around, I thought” Draco cocked his head and laughed as Harry glared at him. “Just take me home now, Potter,”
He didn’t stop until they reached the car that was waiting to pick them up after the event. He pushed Draco into the car and followed after him, telling the driver to take a different route home as to not be followed. Draco was still unconscious, and Harry spotted a pin prick on the back of his neck, by the looks of it they had only drugged him with a tranquilizer.
“I’d say at least two years, and how do you know it’s not a girl?”
Harry walked back inside and closed the door behind him. He sat down at the table next to Draco who was talking to Narcissa in fluent french, while bouncing Scorpius on his knee. Harry realized he was staring and snapped his gaze to Andromeda, who was looking at him with an eyebrow raised.
“You’re pregnant,”
A while after dinner, Scorpius had just fallen asleep in his small bed that Draco had set up. Draco kissed Scorpius’ head and then crawled into his own bed with Harry. Harry opened his arms and Draco went into them. He shoved his face into Harry’s neck and wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist. Harry’s arms came up around him and one was stroking his hair while the other was slung over his shoulders.
will help him with his homework over the hols!” The boys around them laughed at Scorpius, and he pushed past them with Amaryllis in tow. He saw Father and Dad in the crowd of students, Dad smiled at him and waved him over but Scorpius cocked his head to the direction of the bullying group of boys and shook his head.
Draco kissed Scorpius’ head and then set him down near where Dominique and Teddy were playing together. He watched Scorpius play with them for a couple minutes before he joined Harry where he was standing on the other side of the room.
“Say,” Draco started. “What would you wear if you were going on a date with someone you wanted to impress, but the date was at a poor person’s house?”
Draco smirked and began to read out loud as he wrote, "Dear Potter -- It is me, Draco Malfoy, your forever
The days began to pass in a blurry routine. Draco was constantly sore and tired. Sore from seemingly endless practice for his upcoming recital, and tired from staying up late into the night and searching for answers. Draco started sleeping in, which caused him to miss his usual morning reading time. Although he was forgoing Auror Pendragon’s adventures, Draco found having one of his own was just as stimulating. Even if his companions were house elves.
Draco skipped straight to snake and quickly scanned the small paragraph underneath.
Malfoy stood, his arms akimbo. With the extra four or five inches, Malfoy was easily a full head taller than Harry was himself. Malfoy took a step closer to Harry, so that his sharp hip bones ghosted against Harry’s jumper. He looked down at Harry with one brow arched high. “Really, now, Potter?” he said, more than asked.
Then Draco pulled out his latest in the Auror Pendragon Series and began to read aloud. He didn't pause until he had drunk nearly all his own tea. He marked his page and thought once more of the potion and lockbox before he placed the saucer on top of his cup and spun it around four times. He let the mess settle and began to read again, starting on Bear's tea as he did so this time. He repeated the process for Bear's cup when he’d finished that one, and then pushed the book aside completely in favor of gazing in his original cup.
"Who, master Draco?"
“Sorry,” Harry gasped. He was so close already, cock straining against his jeans trying to get closer to Malfoy’s skin.
Oh, but St. Longbottom, Draco thought, remembering what he looked like as he’d smiled at himself in the mirror earlier in the evening. After being gifted with long blond hair that rivaled his mother, a pair of squishy but still perfectly perky tits, and a nice, little wrinkly-looking pussy that was sure to make any straight man happy, Draco had been confident one of his problems had officially been eliminated. A few transfigured clothes, a strong glamour on his left arm, and a quick stroll through the Slytherin common room with only Pansy recognizing him told Draco that Potter shouldn’t be too hard to fool either.
“Kay,” she slurred and let Draco pull her away from the dance floor.
Malfoy, in the same arrogant way as always, glided toward the Slytherin table like not a thing possibly could have been amiss. His pointy nose was so turned up it was practically perpendicular to the ceiling and he still wore that snotty little sneer on his face.
"Lucius, I swear on the great and noble name of Black," his mother started coolly, "if you do not tell me what this thing is in the next five seconds I will gut you or die in the process. Do not even try and lie to me. I have already used
“We aren’t best mates, but she likes me enough to get me a good deal,” Draco said as he slid past Harry and made to rejoin Ginny at their table.
Granger suddenly cut him off with a giggle. “No, I’m sorry. It is just so jarring to think about things from a different perspective sometimes,” she claimed.
“Harry . . .” Draco said. “Do you want to go by your place and change? If not, I know some really good altering charms and you could borrow some of my clothes.”
“Dobby,” he called and waited until the elf appeared with a nervous crack. “We have some more work to do.”
“Mr. Malfoy . . .”
Harry thought about that for a moment before his eyes blew quite large.
A few shots later, Ginny accepted a couple’s request to dance with them, and Draco, getting his hopes up, asked Harry if he would like to join them. Looking panicked, Harry declined with a shout to which Draco just stared back.
Linky was still cleaning when Draco returned. Although, she moved on from the mess in his living room to basic scrubbing and washing that Draco had been ignoring. Draco made himself a dry martini and sipped it as he browsed his wardrobe. What to wear to a dinner at the Weasleys?
“A leg line that you shouldn’t have.”
A handful of powder and Draco whooshed back into Potter’s flat. It seemed the same as when Draco departed this morning, only there was a delicious smell wafting in from the kitchenette.
“You want to,” Harry replied shortly.
“Are you sure you want me there?” Draco looked anxious suddenly. “They don’t--”
“Surely giving it to a different Weasley is not going to protect us should the truth of the matter come out,” Snape sneered, but even Draco could hear the consideration in his voice.
"Boys," his mother said coolly. "I will do this by myself if I have to."
When the potion had first exploded in his face, Draco had felt like strangling Longbottom for messing up his favorite robes. A few hours later, Draco had wanted to kiss Longbottom’s hopeless arse for solving one of his biggest problems with one quick fuck up in potions.
Hermione frowned and gestured to her homework. “Then what exactly can I help you with?” she asked, feeling extremely guilty.
“I know,” Draco said and then Harry kissed him on the mouth. In no time at all, they were aggressively snogging against the locked stall door.
"Well, you know," replied Draco, half a gesture given.
“I thought . . .” drawled Draco, slowly, “we decided to postpone my party until I was home.”
Draco had contemplated murdering him at least twice every day for the past two weeks. However, Dobby was more useful to him alive than dead at this point he figured, and the elf had managed to keep quiet about what they were up to. The house elf had fulfilled his part in Draco’s plan perfectly so far. Only, the past few nights, Draco had been trying to teach him the art of dramatics to no avail whatsoever.
"None of this makes sense!" claimed Ron, but he was ignored completely as Harry stood and made to cross the hall.
This narrowed his choices down greatly and Draco decided maybe the name of the potion was a pun or something, but the closest he could come up with was "Nimble Sole" which required an ingredient named “essence of lead.” Draco then was scared to try any of the three replicas he’d brewed, because it was just like his godfather to make the box self-destructible upon one failure.
The admission excited Draco a little too much and he sank down too fast; the head of Potter’s cock popping inside him all at once and what felt like inches more. Though, most likely wasn't due to how small the movement had been. The feel of Harry stunned Draco at first and he tensed up, but it seemed Potter was coiled just as tight. Draco didn’t understand how it could have possibly burned that much after being so stretched by those wonderful Potter fingers. Plus, Draco wanted it so bad and he’d felt so ready and needy beforehand.
When Malfoy started slapping at the mattress, Harry finally let his third finger slide in shortly a few times next to the other ones. Before Harry knew what had happened, Malfoy thrust himself last knuckle deep around all three fingers.
“What makes you say that?” Zabini asked, some worry eating away at his calm facade.
“Thank you!” Draco gushed. “For being the most wonderful person in the world!”
“I know right,” she rolled her eyes. “Here I am, with a fascinating career, in the middle of an amazing season, and what are mum’s first words to me? No ‘how’s it been.’ Not even a ‘good to see you alive.’ Just ‘you’re late.’”
“Oh, alright.” Owen rolled his eyes but continued. “You remember my husband? Narcissus Malfoy. Well, he was named after someone the ancient Greek’s believed to be the son of the River God, Cephissus. Narcissus was known for his beauty. As the story goes . . .”
It wasn’t a known fact or anything, but Draco Malfoy had been pondering the idea of falling into Harry Potter’s bed for a long time. The inappropriate thoughts had started somewhere between sixth year and the final battle. First when he’d been in the bath and realized he’d been wondering if Potter had followed him there. Quite a few times after the day Draco had found himself straddling Potter’s broom, hanging on for dear life, and having his nose tickled by the sweaty hairs on Potter’s neck all the while.
“Most definitely.” Zabini nodded. “They seemed to have went there. Apparently, Draco didn’t have enough time to scare him off. So, now you can see what has me worried? After being rejected that many times, Draco would just about have a fit large enough to get him sent to St. Mungo’s if the Golden Boy hooked up with him, only to realize post-coitus that Draco is still the selfish, nasty prick that Potter’s always despised.”
He’d felt pain worse, Draco told himself, because the sensation really just . . . knocked his breath out of him in a totally absurd way. He felt so full. He was just so
The first time Draco had lunch with his parents upon his return, his mother had paused him mid-bite by asking him how he’d liked his birthday presents.
“Heya,” a cute man was suddenly standing in front of Draco. He eyed the man’s long legs and toned chest beneath his tight shirt. “Can I buy you a drink?”
They clanked their glasses together and drank. Before the other two had recovered, Draco was out of his seat and walking toward the bar. When he reached it, he looked all around for a female pouring drinks. Finally, he spotted her and made his way to her part of the counter. As soon as Draco had her attention, he smiled a wide happy smile.
After another shot, and finishing the rest of his routine, Draco sauntered from the warm room with his blond hair pinned in a tasteful bun at the back of his head. He dressed in casual, but expensive muggle clothes, and packed his satchel for a day at his favorite café.
“But why would you tell me?” Potter pressed. “Do you want to have my baby or something?”
His father frowned. Draco wanted to suck the words back inside himself and let the acid in his stomach melt them away.
"What, mate?" Ron replied, exasperated, but still grasping on to any conversation he could have with his best mate. "Girl clothes? Really slutty girl clothes? Make up? High heels? Yes, Malfoy totally is wearing all that. Now, could you please get over it? It's getting a bit weird, Harry."
“Snuck out?” Draco laughed. “Right. I couldn’t have just walked from the room without anyone noticing. I was trying to be sneaky. Of course.” Draco rolled his eyes. “Also, I’m not plastered, Potter. I was plastered last night at the pub. Now I’m feeling considerably tipsy.”
“Your place,” Malfoy repeated.
Theo stopped Draco only once, as he had learned how important Draco's creative process could be (to Draco at least); however he couldn't just let this last comment slide.
“You don’t like your body?” Granger had her brows raised.
Draco listened eagerly until Linky fetched him for supper.
Maybe this would be fun, a slightly nervous Harry thought, and sat on the barstool next to Malfoy.
Potter quickly obliged.
“I want you,” Potter said, ignoring Draco’s comment. “Say I can have you and I’ll tell you whatever you want to know.”
“Wait . . . wait, Potter!” Malfoy leapt on him before he could fully stand, and, surprised, Harry let himself be pushed back into the futon. “I’ve been with bigger men than you, remember? I know how it works.”
“And just how do you suggest we do that?” Snape asked, eyes wide. He had obviously recognized the object for what it was. Though Draco still wasn’t clear on that front. “We would risk bringing down the whole manor if we tried that here. I still cannot figure out how Potter managed it with Quirrell. Dumbledore has been spouting his usual love conquers all mess.”
“I am so sorry,” Draco suddenly burst. “For hating you so much. I don’t know how I could ever do the things I did. I am so stupid.”
“I want my own recital,” Draco had blurted and then snapped his mouth shut.
“Well, Potter, some people call it a fetish but I don't think about it as all that. I just like the big ones. Like you,” Malfoy gave him a coy glance. “Who would have thought your scrawny arse would have turned out so hot?”
Draco groaned—in the painful way—and pushed Harry away. “Harry. We can’t. Stop.”
“So, you’ll want to do this again, maybe?” Malfoy asked. “Or, I don’t know? Dinner?”
“If you had been,” Potter answered casually, “then why did I catch you?”
“Well, you see, my love . . .” his mother drawled, seeming to breathe out her anger. “I have this plan. It’s really quite brilliant if you two would only shut your mouths long enough for me to speak.” When neither male spoke again, his mother continued. “I want it gone tomorrow, but I also want it destroyed. So, I give you compromise.
“So strange,” Malfoy huffed. “I can’t sleep with them on. I get way too hot.”
"You are serious?"
Draco returned to the table with a smile on his face.
Luna went about brewing the rest, even as far as to steep Draco's cup for him. He was drawn back from the edge of blank despair as hot ceramic was thrust into his palms.
“Have you ever used a gender altering potion before?”
Then Potter moved and Draco couldn’t think at all. He slid down Draco’s body with the sort of grace he only had in the air, smeared his cum all between them before attaching his mouth right to Draco’s used pussy, and then began to use his tongue. Draco had no clue if Potter was good or not but they very idea had Draco twitching into Potter in minutes (well, after Draco had strategically grabbed on to Potter's wild tufts and set his own crazed pace using the whole lower half of Potter's stubble-lined face).
Although the thought of being like his own mother was kind of scaring Draco now.
Narcissa’s eyes shot to Snape again and she said, "thank you for reminding me, Lucius. Sit, Severus, or I promise I will do you worse than I did my husband for that one."
Ginny nodded, and Draco was pleased.
“Arabesque from first,” he commanded dispassionately, nose in the air.
“I don't have boobs, Malfoy,” Harry said rather viciously. “In case you haven't noticed, I’m muscular under the fat. I'm lean in all the right places if you ask me.”
“Sorry,” Harry mumbled. God, what was wrong with him? He usually had no problem loving himself and not caring what anyone else thought. Why did he have to be so self-conscious around Malfoy of all people? So what if Malfoy was tiny, blond, and everything else Harry was attracted to? He was still a dick that Harry had no business caring about.
Theo wrinkled his nose, but nonetheless claimed, "let's hear this seduction then, Draco?"
Pansy seemed to recover quickly and breathed out a laugh, whispering something in Malfoy's ear that Harry couldn't have heard. Malfoy and Pansy grinned evilly at each other and all Slytherin seemed to grin with them.
Like a hawk, Malfoy’s eyes were back on Harry, but he obeyed. Harry watched eagerly as Malfoy bent both legs up and reached down with his free hand to tease between his cheeks. “The waters all gone,” Malfoy panted. “I’ll need something . . .”
"You mean like," Harry paused and gulped. "Ask him or something?"
"The point is, it was worth the risk," his father started. "You think that somehow bypassed my awareness, Severus? That we would be showing a little weakness?"
"Okay," said Potter, before he suddenly leaned down into Draco's personal space. Draco smelled sweaty tang, broomsticks, and burnt wood all before Potter's mouth reached Draco's ear and he whispered, "have you got on knickers, Malfoy?" quietly enough that Draco was sure not even Pansy had heard what he'd said.
Draco gets insulted and makes a new friend.
She nodded curtly. “Would you like me to send him a note or shall you talk to him in private and return?”
She growled at him and held her position, one leg gracefully stretched out behind her.
“Fuck, Potter,” Malfoy growled. “You weren’t exaggerating, were you? You’ve got rock hard abs under those rolls.”
“Time to move on!” Draco grinned at his new redheaded friend. “Harry, have you paid for all this?”
had tried to play the
make a joke, Theodore," Draco drawled. "And, Luna, she has perfected the art of amusing while amused better than I have myself because she is willing to be more self-deprecating."
“Right,” said Draco, and scowled as he bit his tongue to keep from asking any more questions.
“I thought we were to go to the Weasleys?” Draco asked, as Potter offered him a seat on the futon.
Theo smirked and waggled his eye brows in an alarming manner. "Just ask Potter how he liked the view . . ." he suggested. "Thoroughly baffle the wizard into rethinking anything that Pansy could have said."
Potter's eyes widened. "I don't really care . . . more like . . . hoped?"
The first thing Harry heard when he walked into the pub was Draco Malfoy’s obnoxious voice. The first thing Harry thought upon hearing said voice was that he should turn around and find another place to drink tonight. However, he paused his backward step when he realized Malfoy was quite sloshed and seemed to be talking to himself mostly. Even as the bartender pretended to listen for a moment, Malfoy kept chatting when the man had to walk away to take another order.
Ron sighed. "What do you want Malfoy to think then?"
His father eyed him for a moment. "No, I suppose you would not," he said at last, and continued to stare strangely at Draco.
Draco’s father ignored the question. "You kissed Harry Potter."
These last thoughts sobered Draco’s giddy mood a bit, and when he stepped from the shower only a slip of a smirk graced his face. Draco dried off and poured himself a tumble of gin from a decanter that sat on his bathroom counter and refilled itself when necessary. Nothing better, Draco swore, than a shot straight from the steamy shower to catch a buzz.
What is that? Draco frantically wondered. A trick question?
In the shower, Draco began to smirk to himself. The satisfaction ate away at his face until all he could do was release peels of cold laughter. Patrick’s stupid expression, Draco recalled as he wheezed in the steamy air. The pudgy pink horror as Draco’s 4,000 gallon china vase had broken across it.
“Oh, I’ve noticed.”
His father grew even tenser. "You know what? Fine. It is not my fault your little
Draco's mother began to hiss without saying anything articulate.
Zabini eyed her for a long minute and then suddenly burst out laughing. "Oh . . . Granger," he said after a moment. "You said that like it was a bad thing."
Draco had smiled, and suddenly missing his actual birthday hadn’t seemed so bad. He’d proceeded to smile as he’d finish his meal, and the attribute had stayed until he fell asleep much later.
must stop mixing up your own muggle references."
“Er,” Harry chuckled nervously. “Don’t be a git, Draco.”
"What? What is it, Mione?" he asked. "What's gotten into Harry?"
The other didn’t seem to notice Harry for a moment, which gave him time to ponder his and Malfoy’s recent relationship. No, they didn’t hate each other anymore, but Harry was still wary of the wizard. Especially since Harry had turned into everything Malfoy liked to make fun at even more since they’d left school. Harry worked with his hands, slept on a futon in front of his TV, and ate greasy muggle food for enjoyment.
. How have I gone this long without seeing the true scale to his beauty? I
"Y-yeah," I cleared my throat, "Of course we can. Besides, I'd hate to leave Sev and Remus without a proper goodbye." I heard Harry's footsteps fall into step behind me as I made my way back down towards the kitchen where Severus and Remus were still at. This time when I arrived, they were both sitting at the table drinking tea while chatting together. There was a
As I neared his room I could hear the soft rumble of a rock song and the added sound of drumsticks tapping to the beat. I opened his door quietly and saw Harry sitting with his back towards the door; wild black hair flopping with every flail of his arms. I shut the door with a soft click and leaned against the door for a moment. Suddenly I felt nervous. What if Harry truly doesn't want to go through with my plans? What will I do then? Well, there's no way to know except to ask.
“Oh, come off it. It won’t be that difficult, you berk. It’s just us but on steroids. And gay. Or rather, us on gay steroids. Or would it be me on gay steroids and you just on regular gay?” Merlin this git will be the death of me.
“Simple, We tell no one the truth that way it eliminates any way your parents find out that we’ve been lying. And we break up mid to late August and say that it just wasn’t working out and we’re better off friends.” Well… that is rather simple and not at all complex like I’ve been imagining.
Upon the completion of the first two items on my list, I felt successful. Dipsy assured me that there would be the appropriate ingredients needed for the treacle tart the day before Harry’s birthday and that she would help me with making it as well. Which was very much needed considering my skill level in the kitchen. And mother said that my lengthening hair suited my face and I should continue to let it grow. This I agreed with, I simply wished to see what she thought in case I was actually delusional about my hair. Besides, you know what they say,
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s the principle of it. You’re all posh and proper, simple and basic. It fits right in with being vanilla. Which of course is fine for a prim prince such as yourself,” by then Harry’s words had me red. Because honestly, I had never thought too much about sex. Of course, I wanked and had little fantasies, but well… they were simple like Harry said. And from the Harry way talks, it sounds as though he imagines far more than what I do and now all I can think about is what exactly is it that the fantasizes about. I glanced at Harry and he sat across from me with a smug look plastered on his face, and suddenly my mouth moved faster than my brain could keep up.
Remus, the man who regularly bakes with Harry and me, the man who loves laying outside in the sun in the grass and reading a book, the man who would shy away from a single compliment given to him, the man who constantly yells at Sirius and Harry for roughhousing in the house, dated my father. A man who believed in precision and cold masks. He detested clumsiness. That’s all Remus is! How can an uptight stickler, have once dated my best friend’s calm, giggly, awkward uncle?
“Thank you very much, dad.” His voice was soft and watery. Severus only nodded in return before handing him his next gift.
“Are you ready to talk about it all now?” I sighed and rolled out onto my back from where I was on the floor.
married!” he exclaimed, “but in our years of school he just did not have the proclaimed Gryffindor bravery to ever ask Remus out. So, I took matters into my own hands,” he finished with a smirk and bright silver eyes.
Thinking of a gift for Harry is only somewhat difficult. I have an idea for what to get him for part of his gift, but the other is still a mystery to me. I could try to find more medical texts, or maybe I could find some rare potions ingredients for some of his healing potions. Maybe while I go to purchase Harry’s first gift I can look around Diagon Alley to get some ideas for his second gift.
And so I’m glad I’ve been able to form my own ideas and values, and I’m glad my parents have given me the space to become my own individual person, even if they’ve made me “overly posh” as Harry would,
“Thank you. I put enough thought into it that’s for sure,” I muttered out in an amused tone.
“Oh please, if I was resorting to last choices you
be proud of our heritage, but not for those reasons. We all in the wizarding world should hold pride in being wizards who’ve been blessed with the abilities we have. But we shouldn’t lord them over those without our capabilities, like squibs or muggles. We should use the abilities we have for good, not abuse the power we have like Grindelwald or Voldemort once did.
“First off, how stereotypical of you Draco. I am thoroughly disappointed. I’ll have you know that I am always sassy. Secondly, no need to practice with you, right
Mother wore a pained expression that consisted of sorrow, sympathy, and ultimately, love. She sat upright and held out her hands across the table to Harry, clasping his when he sat his hands in hers. “Harry,” her voice was soft, eyes sincere, “you of all people have every right to not have a distinguished plan. For the first time since you were eleven your life is yours, my dear. There is no shame in taking back the time that that sickening excuse of an entity took from you in such formative years.” Mother’s eyes were misty and her voice spoke slowly as though she was trying to not cry or as though she wanted to stress her point. I felt it safe to say it might be both. “And if anyone has anything to say I’m sure Severus and I can sway them,” Mother spoke lightly, trying to make the situation lighter and more lively. She gave a playfully disdained sniff and squeezed Harry’s hands before letting them go.
"As ready as I'll ever be," Harry said with bravado, though if it was fake I wouldn't doubt it. "We can grab a muffin before we go though right?" Harry was following my lead and standing up from the bed, stretching his arms above his head, his eyes closed as my own eyes trailed down to where his shirt had lifted and golden brown skin was teasingly on display.
and serve me for dinner, but it was nice that he was… chill.” I laughed.
“Apparating, love.” Mother said moving to take one of the smaller presents of mine along with holding their own present for Harry in her hands. “All ready?” I nodded as I replied.
, but he hasn’t shown interest in any if not very few.
“I’m quite sure. And I thought so too, but after wanking to a bloke you start to see things a little less straight.” I couldn’t help but let out a guffaw at his response and had an inkling that my anxiety aided in that laughter. “But seriously, I think I’m bisexual. I hope that isn’t an issue?” His voice trailed off in uncertainty and I quickly made it known that his worries were unfounded.
“Hermione, Ron, hello. My summer has been good, thank you. And yours?”
Harry said ‘darling’ in a way that felt as though it was dripping saccharinely. Merlin, I can’t believe I got myself in this and then proceeded to bring the most Gryffindor Slytherin into this.
“I do what I can to appeal to the masses,” Harry said with a cocky smile and attitude. “So have you any plans to show me how much more fun blondes have, or should we go out and play some quidditch, peaches?” Instantly my face is back to being red.
One thing I had not anticipated was celebrating Harry’s birthday as his fake boyfriend and not as his best friend. I suddenly felt remorse, not for the first time since dragging Harry into my charade. As much as he says that it doesn’t bother him and that it’s a small favor compared to what I’ve done for him I still can’t help but feel regretful and awful for putting him in this position. My developing feelings for Harry make me feel guilty as well, and as much as I hate to admit it, satisfied and pleased that Harry is going along with this charade because it gives me just a taste as to what could have been in a different universe.
“I’ll just put this down over on the table and head in then,” I gave a smile and nod of my head before I left to place the present down, Dipsy still trailing after me. Once I was free of the present I took the treacle from Dipsy and sent her home, and started my walk to the house and into the kitchen. Harry was wearing an apron over a light blue t-shirt and a pair of blue jeans. His shoes were nowhere to be seen, instead, a pair of socks were on his feet. “Happy birthday, Harry,” I walked further into the room smiling. Harry whirled around and gave me a huge smile that lit up his eyes.
Luna and Hermione were the ones most interested in the snake and came up to chat with Harry more and to pet the snake as people once again started to mingle about with each other. Once they seemed to have had their fill, Harry walked over to me and held out the hand the snake had not occupied.
"Don't act too put off, dad. I know it must break your heart each time I leave. Your precious, loving, darling son. Don't worry I'll be back within due time." Harry wore a shit-eating grin and held his hands up in a swooning position. I rolled my eyes and tugged at one of his forearms.
“Thank you, Draco. We appreciate it, “ she emphasized the ‘we’ and Ron rolled his eyes.
“Mother, I’ve brought Harry,” I said as we approached her serene form. She was leaned back in one of our comfortable outdoor chairs with her eyes resting shut, a glass of lemonade with heavy condensation sat on the table beside her. A smile graced her lips before she even opened her eyes.
“How long?” He asked as he went back into his previous position. I was a bit caught off guard at his question. How long what? How long have I been gay? I'd say about my whole life. How long have Harry and I been in this so-called relationship? I'd say about 2 minutes give or take.
“Well, I was going to spend my morning trailing the gardens for the 7,000th time but I thought I’d rather come and spend this special day with a special person.” My hands gripped the case that held the treacle tart and I felt brazen to have flirted so shamelessly but remembered that I had an excuse to do so. Harry’s eyes were soft and his smile was still wide.
Chapter one was quite short and I thought about adding this chapter to it, but this chapter itself is almost 2000 words and I don't want the chapters too uneven in length considering I've already begun working on the next chapters. So sorry for that jump in length even though it wasn't too tremendous. I hope to keep a more consistent length in the future, if not a little longer.
“Oh yes, Draco. You do know Mr. Lupin yes?” No. No, no, no. Please don't say what I think you're about to say! “Remus and I had a nice fling once or twice,”
"I'm being serious Potter! Father himself told me after I outed myself to him like a fool." Harry opened his mouth to speak. "And no why would he lie about something like this? Don't be ridiculous." Harry's mouth shut. "There isn't anything for him to gain by telling me that. And it truly does make sense when you think about it." Harry sat in silence for a moment before speaking.
before popping out of the room, leaving me alone once again. I decided to write my letter to Harry now, that way it’s prepared for when I’m ready to send it off and call for Dobby to bring me my supplies. Once I am equipped with a quill and parchment I start my brief letter to him.
"This day has gone quite opposite of how I thought it would honestly. I get a boyfriend, I find out my best friend's dad once fancied moony and moony once fancied him. What's next? Dad and Narcissa used to date?" I gave the idea a considering look, if for anything to bother Harry. "Oh gods, please don't tell me they did too!" Harry's hands came up and covered his face as he let out a muffled "
“Discover what secret?” At the sound of Harry’s voice, I jolted slightly, his sudden appearance surprising me.
"Hey dad, hey moony," Harry greeted as he nudged past me to get to the muffins. He grabbed two before coming back to me and handing me the other one. "Thanks for the muffins Remus," Harry took a large bite of his before muffling out, "they taste delicious." I smacked his shoulder with a look of distaste.
“Are you sure?” I squeaked out, too shocked to feel embarrassed. “Aren’t you straight and all that?”
. And so Harry, who we all thought would go to Sirius, which he did, mother said, but only for a night, instead was transferred to Severus Snape’s care. She said it was quite unexpected but after Severus joined them for dinner, tiny Harry in tow, he explained it all. He and Lilly apparently had a one-off sometime when James and her and been broken up, and they didn’t think too much of it until it had been a while after she and James had gotten back together and she realized she was pregnant.
“Pleasant? I may just beg to differ,” Severus said with a snort. “Harry is in his room assuming that is who you’re here for.”
Time apparently ticked by fast because before I knew it I heard knocking on the doorway of the library and saw Harry making his way in.
But it was now or never and well, maybe it won’t be that bad.
“Goodnight, Harry,” I whispered in reply, as I let the sounds of his breathing lull me deeper into relaxation and deeper into slumber. My last conscious thought being
Well, it’s now or never isn’t it?
“Your mother has always liked me more so I’d have to agree,” Harry started. “I don’t think I’m exactly ready to face Lucius Malfoy yet. Also, mate you might want to get that hand sweating checked out.” Harry said seriously before cracking a large grin and laughing. I shoved his shoulder away and rolled my eyes.
“You’re here!”
“Nah, we’re good. Let’s just see where it takes us,” Harry said as he got up from the floor and climbed into bed. “You coming?” I’m quite sure my brain just turned off because I think Harry just said or rather implied that he isn’t all that bothered or worried about this arrangement and I can’t think of any reason why. Maybe he isn’t worried about it going into the school year? Maybe he’s just being a good friend? He does tend to express Gryffindor traits despite being a Slytherin. Again, I blame that on Sirius. “Draco? Is that fine? Are you coming?”
“Just wanted an idea of when we’ll do presents n’all. I don’t want to keep people too long, especially if they’d like to see me open the gifts.”
"Let's go drama queen. If we don't want to be late we should go. Bye Sev, Remus. Thanks for the muffins by the way, they were delicious. Should I perhaps bring one back for father?" And with that, Harry and I left the room laughing with mirth as Remus let out a loud groan covered his quickly blushing face.
After traveling through the floo once more, this time with Harry in tow, my nerves almost seem to be doubled what they once were. Now that I’ve gotten one hard part out of the way, it seems I have been dealt with another hard hand to play. Literally. And honestly, I really am a silly dunderhead for even thinking Harry would reject me being gay. For Merlin’s sake, Remus and Sirius have been together since, well since Sirius finally used his Gryffindor senses and swept Remus away from my father apparently. And besides, I’ve seen Harry stare at Diggory more than what is deemed hetero-ly normal.
“I think, Draco,” he began his fingertips poised together lightly tapping at each other, “that I can work with this.” What? “The Potter’s are from an ancient house as well as good wealth and status,” he sat a few seconds longer before talking again, “not to mention the boy has exceptional manners considering who Severus let him be raised around.” Raised around? “I know this won’t taint the Malfoy name, I mean it’s not like you’re the first Malfoy to like men, let alone a half-blood,” he said with an almost fond (
“Tomato bisque with grilled cheese, and a pumpkin juice, please Dipsy?” The little elf nods her head fast and squeaks out a
“Honestly, I haven’t got much planned further than tomorrow these days, and it’s the most relieving thing to know. After spending so many summers preparing to finally take Voldemort down and spending my school years fighting him, it feels odd to have free time, well, all the time.” Harry’s voice bled with a relieved and incredulous tone, but his face held a thoughtful expression. “This past Easter holiday break was a turning point in my life and truthfully, I doubted that I would survive Voldemort. I never saw a future past the war with Voldemort.” His voice was somber and his gaze no longer lingered on my mother but off in the distance. His eyes were glazed over and his face was devoid of any apparent emotion. The once lighthearted conversation had now taken a drastic turn that I hadn’t expected. “Dad and Draco have been instrumental in my so-called “rehabilitation” into a normal teen boy as dad calls it though,” Harry shoots me a smile, his eyes soft. I melt at the look Harry sends me and at his compliment, sending him a soft look back. It was true though, as foolish as Harry may make it sound. Harry’s fight with Voldemort was not simple nor painless, and so coming out of the war he was left with ragged edges and a bruised mind and soul. He suffers from a slight case of PTSD now and wakes fretfully from nightmares most nights, though he promises that they’ve gotten better lately. Harry has yet to tell me the entire truth of what transpired the night of the final battle, but from watching the arrival of Harry being apparated by Severus from Parkinson Manor after being missing for 3 days to the grounds of Hogwarts a mess of bruises, bloody cuts and gashes, torn clothing, and dirt I knew it was nothing anyone could walk away from without deeper, mental infliction.
“Because dear Harold,” I said crossing my arms behind my head and leaning back into the plush bed, my eyes sliding closed, “if they don't, I'll twist it to look like you were fooling me all along and you broke my heart.”
“Yes, sir.” I made my way to head out through the doorway but just as I was about to step clear of the kitchen I paused. “Oh! Remus, I never would have pegged you as the type to have a thing for blonde Slytherins, but we're all full of surprises I guess, no?” A smirk found its way on my lips and Remus looked shocked and red. Behind me, I heard Severus erupt in laughter as I continued my trek to Harry's room upstairs.
“No father, Prince Harry,” I stated sarcastically. “I've taken up a thing for redheads you see. I think Ronald Weasley is next on the list.” Father stood staring at me for a moment before turning away and walking to a cabinet of sorts and pulling out an expensive bottle that looked to be Ogden’s Finest. He poured a generous amount before taking a large swig out of the bottle and grimacing from the burn.
She looked up with a wide smile and began to speak excitedly, “Draco! I found this little fairy as I was watering the other flowers. She was just floating around the flowers admiring them. Isn’t she gorgeous?”
“Thank you, Narcissa. You know how much that means to me.” And she does. Harry and mother have always had a bond that neither me or father or hell even Harry’s family even understood. But its always sweet to watch them together and Harry has even mentioned to me that he thinks Lilly would be content to know that Narcissa Malfoy of all people takes such good care of him. Mother held a fond smile and gestured towards the other chairs surrounding the table.
It’s the day before Harry’s birthday and I can now successfully say that I’ve completed six of the seven items on my
So as we lay about eating the cookies we made, which was another thing that rubbed off on me: Harry’s love for cooking, I’ve pondered my life and I think about Harry’s and how they’ve merged into something so effortless. I certainly don’t remember the first time meeting Harry but I also can’t tell you a time when he wasn’t around.
“Yes. I do.” There were a few beats of silence before anyone said anything.
“Would you two care to join me? I can have Mipsy bring more lemonade? Speaking of which Mipsy is making Lemon Pudding Cake with Cherry Coulis for dessert and I am most excited.” One thing Harry learned quickly after being over here for so many years was that mother was quite infatuated with lemon. Between having several lemon trees in our gardens and consistently indulging in lemon centered or incorporated dishes, father and I have had more than our fair share of the sour fruit. Harry’s eyes light up at the mention of dessert.
“We know mate.” Several laughs we were heard throughout the small crowd and Harry moved onto to the next gift. Harry went through almost all of them until my own were left. He had since received a book on the history of muggle London from Hermione, a planters kit with seeds, soil, and a pot from Neville and Luna, a few muggle movies from Sirius and Remus, and finally a book on mediwizardry from my parents. When presented with my own, Harry chose the smaller box to start with. I was nervous and unsure if he would like it, wondering if it was too far out of his comfort or liking. Harry’s eyes flew up to meet my own and the love and warmth I saw in them took me back. He slipped the ring on once he regained focus.
with a half-page of writing on it. The muffins were sitting on a cooling rack, the sweet smell still lingering in the air.
“Happy birthday to me, indeed.”
Hmm. No, I'm quite good.
"You two are just bullies," Harry grumbled out as he grabbed his second muffin. "Hey dad, is it fine if I go over to the manor to have dinner with Draco?" Snape nodded.
“I-I know. But I'm scared to tell you, Harry.”
“Let’s go, Potter. Or are you feeling Snape today?”
“Any significant plans for the remainder of your summer Harry?” Mother asked in an inquisitive tone. Harry met her gaze and shook his head.
Gods, what did I just imply?! What does Harry think I’ve just implied? This is loony. I’m loony. I need to be checked into the Janus Thickey ward.
Already upon arriving I could see people bustling around the selected part of the grounds where the gathering was being held. I could see my parents talking to Severus, the presents now in the hands of Severus. I made my way over to them Dipsy following. After reaching them Severus greeted me.
I started to laugh, feeling lightweight and free of worry at that moment. Once Harry's hands came down and my laughter was only slight I spoke.
“Is that why Sirius hates you so much?” I exclaimed quickly as I hit me. Of course! Now it makes sense why Sirius is constantly sniping and glaring at father! Not to mention Remus blushing when father would- oh Merlin!- when father would compliment him. Was that father's way of flirting with Remus? How could I have missed it?! What about mother? Does she know of father's antics?
“See you around, Harry.” Hermione started to tug Ron off to where I could see Luna and Ginny sitting together with Neville. What an interesting couple Luna and Ginny were. Both had once liked Harry, and instead found they liked girls. Do you think I should expect the same then?
“That’s sort of what I’m unnerved about. Especially my father. And the whole fairy thing was weird, no?”
“That was horrible and I hated it.” Harry let out a laugh that fluttered the walls of my heart. Truthfully it was a sickeningly cute comment but no one has to know that. He grabbed the container from e and gave me a brief kiss on the cheek, shocking me still, my face turning a deep pink fast. I scrambled to catch a grip before I lost my mind. “O-oh?”
“Right then, to mother first shall we?” I asked before pulling my hand from Harry’s and wiping it on my trousers. My hand had gotten so clammy from being nervous that all the excess moisture was beginning to be bothersome and I cursed to myself for being so ridiculous. “Sorry for practically giving your hand a bath, as you can tell my nerves have yet to settle,” I winced.
It takes me about two days to write a full chapter, so if you're ever wondering when I'll next update just follow that as a guiding rule I'd say :) I hope to progress the story some more and get to some of the good stuff hahah
“I think I might regret introducing you to muggle television.” Harry’s smile said differently. “So, ready to brave the wolves?”
“Are we flooing or apparating?” I asked as I went to grab the presents.
“I don’t know about all that Draco, I honestly don’t even know where I’d find any. Though I suppose Seamus would know,” Harry said pondering over the situation. “I’ll think about it, yeah? If you’re serious?” I started to laugh.
“We’re going to Spinner’s End, alright Dipsy?” She nodded and with a pop of her own disappeared. I blew out a long breath and put on a smile.
"As if I could manage to keep them with him when his mutt of a dogfather is always around," Severus said with mock vexation. Severus and Sirius surprisingly get on fine enough despite their history. Harry had told me all about what he had learned about the marauders' relationship to Snape and he was in a bad state with them all once he knew the truth of it all, but he eventually came around once he realized that if they could be grown-ups
“Hey! I’m not that bad!” I huffed out. Harry wrapped his arm around my waist, hugging me into his side before loosening his hold.
“Yes, happy birthday.” Father’s voice wasn’t as enthusiastic, but there was a soft smile on his face.
“Where should I start, Dipsy?”
“Okay, yes, I am sorry. I am terribly apprehensive of this, I must admit. I know I said I was confident but I lied Harry,” I gasped for a breath, “I don’t know how we’re going to pull this off. I really am sorry for dragging you into this by the way. I don’t know what I was thinking—”
With the final product of one treacle tart made, it is set in a special dish that preserves whatever food is placed inside and set aside for tomorrow.
“Draco! How has your summer been?” The wind blew Hermione’s dark brown straggling curls around her face, the majority of her hair pulled up and into a hairband. She and Ron were holding hands, an interesting development to see. They had apparently gotten over themselves and admitted their obvious attraction to each other.
“Harry, I'm gay and I told my father we're dating because I refuse to marry a girl, let alone a stranger, come to the end of our seventh year.” Silence.
“I was actually going to see when dad wanted to do everything. I think we might do it soon though. Come with?” Harry held his arm out to me and I nodded a confirmation linking my arm with his. “We’ll talk to you guys later, yeah?”
How could that have escaped my mind? After Dipsy saw that my hands were washed to perfection she let out a triumphant hum and continued with her instruction. “Dough is to be first, master Draco.” And with that Dipsy led me through the process of making the dough for our base and once that was completed and set aside to chill, she had me begin the process of making the filling. The overall process to make the treacle tart was going smoothly and once we got to baking the final product and taking it out to cool, I was proud. I know that my skills in the kitchen will never be to Harry’s level, but when you invest time and love, to me it shows in the final product, and I hope Harry can see it as well.
“Hah!” Draco spat water from his mouth. To think, Patrick had called Draco mentally unstable and abusive. No, Patrick was the one always holding Draco back with his constant jealousy and verbal abuse. Draco would prosper now, without those meaty fingers constantly wrapped around his wrist.
Harry woke in the morning, a moan of pleasure escaping his throat even before he fully processed the sweet sensation of something wet and warm sliding along his cock.
“I wanted to.” Draco gave Potter a cautious smirk. “Why wouldn’t I wish to know . . . certain things . . . about you—“
“Fine,” Harry said, and threw one leg over the large bike. “Hop on then.”
, a condensed
“Granger,” he started, a sneer across his face, “it has been two weeks. I do not think you have gotten any better.”
, she didn't say out loud.
Draco's mother seemed to sit up straighter, even as she had been perfectly straight before. “We have this thing destroyed as soon as we possibly can,” she said firmly. She waved her wand and the journal materialized before them. Another quick flick and the thing disappeared.
Zabini laughed some more.
Harry whined as Malfoy’s tightness disappeared suddenly and left his fingers cold. Then Harry yelped as long, strong limbs maneuvered him flat on his back against the mattress. Malfoy loomed over him, one of those perfect fucking thighs closing in Harry’s hips on both sides, and he pinned Harry to the bed with a tight grip on his shoulders. Harry was literally incapable of thinking, moving, or doing anything besides kiss Malfoy back as the other fell on top of him, sloppily brought their mouths together, and slid his slippery arse all along Harry’s hardness.
Potions was one giant disaster (as was Snape’s entire life, really, but that was not the point right now). Harry hadn't noticed, because he was too busy staring at Malfoy. In fact, Harry had been so busy staring at Malfoy that he'd completely skipped out on taunting Malfoy as the other had strode in. Instead of calling him something insulting like all the other Gryffindor boys had done, Harry had only drooled on the table a little bit. Snape had started off the lesson with five points from Gryffindor for Harry's drool, but fifty for the name calling.
Wand nor hand held Draco down as Potter forcibly took Draco with his cock, yet he felt stupefied as it happened; Potter sliding into the clamping heat of Draco’s arse and showing the resistance of his muscles no mercy as he began to plunge out and back in again.
Harry turned his anger back on Ginny. “You could at least wait until your mum’s in bed to start drinking. You know how worried she is about you. Twice a month is all she gets, Gin! And the first thing you always do is snap at her and have a drink!”
"Of course,” was his father’s reply--his father
“Come on,” Potter tugged him up and along with a smirk. “I learned the hard way just how much you appreciate being put to sleep with 'arse juices' near your face.”
“Alright,” she started, urging him to lie back. “You seem eligible for the reversal potion I have on reserve. There are just a few routine questions . . .”
“Screw off, Potty,” Draco sneered when the bartender walked off to make his drink. “This is the shit I’m talking about. Just because I look like this doesn’t mean I need a man to run my fucking life. In case you haven’t noticed, I am a man, too!”
“No, you really didn’t—“
The clatter of wooden doors against a stone wall caused Harry to twitch and turn toward the entrance way. It was Draco Malfoy who strode into the Great Hall for breakfast, and Harry sat stunned as his eyes followed the lone figure. Though Harry was not alone in his stupefied state. It seemed the entire hall, students and professors alike, had taken a collective gasp and were terrified to let any air back out.
Draco batted Potter’s hand away and whined. “Fine,” he started. “I just thought, you know, that that is what everyone would expect from me. Draco Malfoy: demon child, Death Eater teen, now starts his adult career off by murdering Harry Potter’s babies.” Draco was gesturing wildly by the end of his explanation.
Harry only had so much willpower. Malfoy was everything Harry wanted in a sexual partner, and Malfoy claimed that Harry was everything he wanted -- well, minus the man tits. Harry would let him come over, and if Malfoy changed his mind, Harry could always sleep on the recliner and let Malfoy have his futon.
“Oh,” Harry said. “You talk to Luna?”
“Shower time,” he said, grinning at Draco.
“Sorry, Draco,” Jamie said. “I’ve got to deal with this. Don’t get lost again, okay? I’m off next weekend, come back.”
“Wait, Potter,” Malfoy said, and Harry stilled, his mouth hovering right over Malfoy’s Adam’s apple as he felt long fingers grip his wrist. “Why are you really doing this?” he whispered, and Harry pulled back to look at him with a confused frown. “I’m not a girl, Potter, you know that right? I mean . . . call me a girl all you like, I’m just saying I dress and act however I feel like and that’s not going to change just because Harry Potter likes me in a skirt. Sometimes, I don't want to wear a skirt and well . . . even when I do I’m not a different person. Like at all.”
“Luna,” Draco smiled and kissed her hand. “You know Harry and Ginny,” Draco said as he gestured to them. “We are out on a Draco Dash tonight.”
, but Draco hadn’t really given him much of a choice. Exposing Potter’s hardness as soon as he’d caught sight of it, Draco had been on his knees with Potter’s cock down his throat in seconds. Potter hadn’t so much as uttered a protest since then.
“He is in the cloud room,” his father corrected.
“Well . . .” his mother’s smile had been just as little. “I am glad you liked them, my dear.”
“That is potentially useful information, Dobby, be continuing up on that as we proceed,” Draco ordered, feeling suddenly, stupidly hopeful. “For now, it tells us all you need to do is play up the tormented and woebegone, brave little warrior routine to its fullest potential. Basically just, well . . . just be being yourself, Dobby. It is only Harry Potter whose underpants reach his belly button.”
“Er, what?”
When the robe was finally removed, Potter manipulated them so Draco’s skirt exposed his pussy to the feel of Potter’s hard, rubbing cock. With a finger, Potter prodded around the thin cotton of Draco’s panties. Draco tensed as the rough print and nail made contact with his soaked skin. He tried to pull away and Potter had to use both hands to hold him against the desk again.
Hot flush ran up Draco’s neck and his cock hardened instantly. “You mean like, watch me?”
His father didn't answer. His mother banished the journal and cast a silencing charm on the room, but it didn't matter as Draco was already stood inside it when the magic passed the threshold.
“But . . . why?” Severus sneered. “Why even risk it? We know now that Potter destroyed a Horcrux-like person—or thing—without draining either of their powers.”
"Honestly, Ron," drawled Hermione from Ron's side. "If anything, this completely changes my perception of Malfoy. It certainly proves he's less of the little coward I've always thought him to be. He's got to have a back bone to brave those heels on this floor--Harry, honey, are you breathing?!"
Sighing, Draco rounded the corner and strolled into the expansive blue corridor. He hadn’t spoken to Owen since last Christmas when the man revealed that he had once been a Potter before marrying into the Malfoy family. Owen snored as Draco approached his portrait.
"It actually made me uncomfortable . . . just thinking about . . . what he wrote."
"Never let me find out what?"
The movement had Draco’s vision flashing white, and he may have mewled a bit pathetically as Harry kept hitting that sweet spot inside of him. Draco gave in and just bounced then. As fast as he could have. The friction felt like it was starting a fire inside him and the flames were pooling low in his gut.
Harry shrugged and said, “scared of you, I guess.”
Draco smiled back and went for his bag. Draco reached and his whole arm disappeared inside the small satchel. Draco pulled out three bottles of water and handed one each to Harry and Ginny.
“Fuck, yes!”
Lindy’s was only a short walk from the pub. Any time Luna was in muggle London, she would most-likely be caught at Lindy’s lesbian bar. Draco still wasn’t sure if Luna was actually homosexual or if she just liked the strange wallpaper the place had.
The next club they stepped into was nothing like Lindy’s had been. The whole area—from the forty-foot ceiling to the dance floor to the bar that wrapped around three-fourths of the perimeter—was alit with a neon phosphorescent glow. Writhing bodies molded to the wobbly beat spun by a shirtless DJ who was raised up high so everyone could see him even through the mass of dancers.
“Oh, they’re in the dungeons . . .” Zabini drawled, his face unreadable.
Draco liked venturing into muggle London, because he could enter elite, upper-class establishments without glares that told him to exit again. Money made Draco just as important in the muggle world as it used to in the Wizarding one. Although, soon, Draco thought, I’ll have my fangs in Harry and I’ll be back where I belong.
“Madam Pomfrey has a potion that will turn me back . . .” Potter raised a brow. “She can give it to me now, but since there’s a chance I could be . . . well, you know. It’s then standard procedure for her to check, but . . . I thought you could help me decide what to do . . .”
“You’re right,” Potter decided at last, releasing Draco as he stepped back. Draco righted himself and made to find his robe but Potter quickly crowded him against the desk again. This time his eyes bore into Draco’s own for long seconds before he leaned forward and brought their mouths together.
“I think I can deal with that,” Potter answered cryptically and went right back to attacking Draco’s neck, and Draco couldn’t find the will to push Potter’s wet lips away from his skin twice.
Draco strode purposely over and picked the cup up, but still did not see much. He turned it over in his hands, right then left, and gasped as he suddenly saw the only symbol there; belatedly he realized he'd dropped the cup entirely. Linky saved it from crashing to the floor and hovered it back to the table.
Narcissa grinned evilly but shook her head. “The Weasleys, of course, little weapons in disguise that they make themselves.”
And so on Draco went.
guilty, he was just a
Potter slapped him lightly on the face. “All I ever do is tease you, Malfoy,” he said. Draco just glared at him.
Without leaving a beat of silence for Draco to respond, Mrs. Wealsey said, “oh, Draco Malfoy dear! How lovely it is to see you, and to find out that our Harry here has himself such a handsome young lad to keep him company.” At that point, she paused only to overwhelm Draco with a powerful hug. “Oh, but look at you. You’re too skinny! All skin and bones—“
"I just thought, well . . ." Harry paused. "I couldn't bring myself to go to Hermione this time."
“Now I ask you gentlemen, why do it when we can have those less fortunate do it for us? And why, for that matter, should we trust just any poor sod with the task? When we have the perfect tool at our disposal . . . with only a minimal amount of manipulation, I promise, Severus. It will really be like taking candy from a baby.”
They reached the end of the lesson and Jean still hadn’t returned, though Granger was breaking a sweat and looked satisfied. Draco normally wouldn’t disrupt Jean, but he wasn’t sure he could teach Granger the healing spells correctly. After all, she was Granger, and Draco wasn’t about to put himself in a position in which she could mock him - not after that penis comment especially.
But it was Granger, and Draco was wearing his
“Fuck, yes,” Draco said, and moaned as they began to move together.
“Fine,” his father now sighed as the resigned one. “Tell me what you are thinking, Narcissa.”
“Where is Draco?” Snape was asking while simultaneously casting a silencing charm. Draco quickly stepped all the way into the room despite the unwelcoming atmosphere.
“Become a female?” Jamie smiled, assuring Draco that she was casual with the ordeal. “Yeah, that Patrick had you under lock and key, eh?”
"You barely notice when
“Maybe—maybe it was rape the first time, but this,” Potter gestured between them, “proves that it wasn’t. You want me, Draco Malfoy, you just won’t admit it.”
"Harry
Ron took pity on his friend even though it was always funny to see Harry turn so pink. "You want to be spanked by Malfoy?"
Her eyes blew wide, her arms clinched to her sides, and her face slowly broke out into a smile much too wide for her thin face.
“Fuck,” Draco made a strangled sound as Potter slapped him with his softening cock. He let his head drop, but Potter quickly lifted his chin.
Those thoughts had Draco halting in his tracks. He saw his own legs bent and spread, Potter panting over his neglected sack, and decided in that moment he wasn’t going to cum before Harry Potter did.
His father gave a bitter laugh. "I realize I made a huge mistake, but do not go and get all high and mighty acting like you haven’t hidden just as many dark objects around this place."
“With other guys?”
Slowly, Draco lifted his legs over the bench, crossed them, and faced the Boy Who Lived. "Potter, that was the worst insult I've ever heard," said Draco, still sappy slow, as he placed his elbows behind him on the table and leaned back.
“Right,” Malfoy said, and started to remove himself off Harry’s body. “Well, there’s seven days in a week, Potter--”
“Why should I?” Malfoy didn’t smile, but Harry could see the amusement dripping off of him like slime. Harry’s jaw clenched, his fist curling as he forgot about Malfoy’s face and eyed the flushed swell twitch, half-submerged and wrapped as it was in the light grip of Malfoy’s slender fingers.
“We’re going clubbing, Harry!” Draco was deprived his indignant reply by Ginny who seemed as equally scandalized as Draco felt. “You can’t wear those old rags!”
Draco was somehow surprised to see Luna outside his flat, even though yesterday that would have made perfect sense.
Snape's suspicions had been confirmed as a first year Slytherin boy came flailing into his afternoon potions class panting out a tail about screaming Draco Malfoys, Harry Potter shoulders, common rooms, and knickers.
She nodded. “Give me a few moments.”
“Potter, fuck,” hissed Draco, and Potter had him pressed flat against the bed suddenly. One of his hands held Draco in place while the other one disappeared. Draco glanced down and saw Potter palming roughly at the front of his own trousers.
“Last year?” Potter shook his head. “I wouldn’t have wanted anything like this. Well, I would have never let myself . . .”
"Please," Harry Potter begged.
Draco did not reply, just stared at Potter’s approaching form.
“I quite agree,” Jean said as she strolled in and proceeded to show Granger the spells. Once Granger’s feet were healed, Jean asked her to stand in front of the barre for inspection and Draco somehow felt nervous for Granger even though she was a mudblood and in cohorts with his
"No! Merlin, no, Ron." Harry had jumped up only to sink down to Ron's new level kneeling on the floor, hands grabbing at the sides of his own baggy jeans. "I couldn't explain why at the time, but I think this is it. Our sex--er, sorry--was not good. I mean, I've never really done it with anyone else but I'm pretty sure it was a disaster."
Draco’s jaw dropped open in disbelief, but before he could protest a bell sounded and he was shuffled toward the kitchen by a hungry pack, leaving Draco with no chance of hopping to safety.
“Touchy. Woah. Okay,” Draco said and rolled his eyes. “Perhaps we should talk about your diet then.”
Black. Black was good, so good, but white. In this instance, white might have been better.
Potter had these hands. They just gripped Draco and warmed him to the bone, and he found himself trying to resist melting in Potter’s arms. It was turning out to be quite the task. Potter had already stripped him of his jumper, pushed him flat back on the bed, and untucked his shirt. As Potter made to take the shirt off him, Draco forced himself into stopping Potter on the last button.
Ginny seemed in awe, but pleased. Harry, on the other hand, seemed as if he may be suffering from an aneurism.
it for years. I be--I accomplish
Ron’s plan seemed more like an attempt to murder Malfoy, but Harry had no better ideas, and he planned to blame the whole ordeal on Ron if things went south. It was like seeing Malfoy nude had caused every ounce of courage to drain from Harry’s body. It seemed like war time all over again, and Harry wasn’t sure if he could win this time round.
For a moment, Hermione watched Malfoy pretending to miss Harry approach. Then she sighed and went back to her reading. She could admit to herself, it might not have made any sense. One wouldn’t have thought she’d fancy knowing anything about Malfoy’s knickers or what business Harry had with them. However, if there was one absurdity she found herself interested in, it was Harry Potter, Draco Malfoy, and one pair of knickers.
“Um, yeah,” Harry said, his blush deepening even under the neon pink bulb lighting their table. “Er, sorry if that freaks you out—“
“Why?” Draco couldn’t help but ask.
“Be my guest,” Luna said, and they all found a seat in the comfy, circular booth. “Have you gone over the rules yet, Draco?”
Draco apparated near the café, strolled in the front door, and ignored the queue as he sat as his usual table.
His father nodded sharply.
"Seriously, Harry," Ron continued, "why would you show me this?"
“Mr. Malfoy . . . is there a chance you could be with child? How long have you been in this form exactly?”
"I waited as long as I could, Lucius, honestly . . . I thought you would have tried at least before sending him off in a world full of unknown legilimens having his head stuffed with the things that it is."
Harry only sighed and vanished the empty fifth. “Gin,” he said. “You only come home twice a month. Must you really spend the time worrying your mother to death?”
Like Draco’s old best friends, Harry wasn’t the Hollister model most gay men hoped for, but Draco’s brain must be wired differently than the others. When Draco looked at a man like Harry, he saw a tough, virile wizard who could potentially worship the ground Draco walked on and stay loyal to Draco until the very end. That was a sexy combination.
Draco prepared his mix and warmed the kettle over his cauldron fire. He invited Linky in when the water was nearly boiling, and she transfigured a table and chairs for herself, Draco, and Bear to sit around. Draco didn't even need to remind her for their customary cups and carefully divided the crushed leaves into each when they appeared on the table.
“She started it,” Ginny snapped. “And you have room to talk? This is your first date with Draco and you let the others walk all over him! And on that point, why would you bring him here in the first place? Don’t you like him? Sure, he might have a bit of an attitude but he’s the hottest thing you’ll ever have a chance to pull, you fat arse! You would think he deserved the best champagne and strawberries that money can buy, not being stuck in mum’s ruddy garden with me.”
“I’m going to the Weasley’s tonight,” Harry said.
Now Draco would have to visit Pomfrey.
"Why?" Ron had to know. "Why would you ever think that? When have I ever been understanding?"
“Of course,” Draco replied. “I wouldn’t be sleeping with him if I didn’t.”
Draco could only nod again, shocked by her stern and helpful honesty.
Draco watched, fascinated, as both his father's excitement and his godfather's horror grew steadily throughout her speech.
“What did he look like?” Draco asked a still-blushing Harry. Over at their table, it was a bit quieter, but Draco still had to talk quite loud.
“Well, hello,” Draco said dryly.
"Told her to keep her fat nose out of it," Draco sighed out and Theo laughed at him.
Just when Draco had been sure it couldn’t get any worse, Molly Weasley walked in from the kitchen and saw Draco cowering like a hunted rabbit in the middle of her pack of savage weasels.
Stay tuned for the next part in this series. "Be Ready for the Red-Headed Hussy." In which Luna and a few other friends will make an appearance.
"Then I do not know how to began," Draco snapped.
on this room and you will die a slow and painful death if one lie comes from your mouth."
Draco would need to add the "Eye of Newt" then. He couldn't doubt it for a second, he was right. There was not one path of solid reasoning behind his choice, he just knew.
Draco cursed her on her way out.
“No. I just mean, without wards?” Draco scrunched his brow. “Do you just have a bunch of locks?”
“I don't really. Just one time it would be nice to have someone want a repeat performance with me. It sucks knowing your partners find you so unattractive they have to be drunk to sleep with you, and, even then, only want a one off for five minutes of fame.”
“Oh, you two know each other?” drawled Jean, smirking.
Potter flailed awake and somehow managed to pull a wand out of Draco's arse along with his soft little, Potter cock. Pansy stopped herself from making a comment, even as he aimed the wand at her. Draco, it seemed, didn't wake up until he'd smacked the floor and that, Pansy had to comment on.
“Nevertheless,” his father continued easily. “Draco should be able to withstand possession if--”
“You are talking about possibly bringing back a war, my love,” his father said, sounding rather faint yet his expression showed his intrigue. “Who could you trust with such a thing?”
Gods, did Harry just get sexier by the minute? Draco wondered.
Jamie laughed, clearly remembering Harry. “Oh, that one was precious . . . and handsome,” Jamie smirked. “You always did have a type.”
"Never," Draco gasped, offended.
“Hey, do not look at me like that! It is not my fault if the kid chooses to wear those stupid muggle clothes sometimes and then proceeds to have pants that won’t stay down and trousers that won’t stay up!”
“Nothing—“ Draco started to say but was cut off by a hot pocket. “Oh, goody!” Draco squealed and pulled out his communication device.
“Mmm,” Draco hummed, he remembered that rant quite well, and let Harry pull him along. “Fine.”
“Oh, Draco,” Luna chuckled. “I do admire your complete self-absorption.”
"Hoped . . ." Harry started, his mouth dry. "Definitely."
. Draco couldn’t even breathe. He didn't know what to do. He had too much going through his mind, and then before he could move Snape was appearing with an angry crack.
“Shup up, Malfoy—“
“Of course, dear. If only you say who . . .”
Harry could only open and close his mouth like a fish while Malfoy glared up at him. Harry wanted to say something about how he didn’t go out looking to get laid tonight, and still had on the socks he’d worked all day in, but before he could manage to form a coherent sentence, Malfoy had summoned his wand and blasted Harry’s toes with a cleaning charm.
There wasn't supposed to be smut, but Draco's been feeling extra submissive as of late.
His mother loved the little guy. Probably because Dobby was easy prey though, not because she trusted him Draco was starting to realize.
"Like milky white," Harry cut off his enraged professor. Harry’s eyes were wide and unfocused as he stared somewhere to the left of Snape's head. "Or like cream or clear or just pale . . . white. Definitely light," he decided on finally. "So much light."
When Malfoy was fully nude, he fell to his knees in front of Harry and played with the hem of his shirt. He pushed Harry’s knees apart with his torso so he could lean in close enough to pull the material over Harry’s head. Harry shut his eyes and let it happen. Tossing the shirt aside, Malfoy pressed his nose into Harry’s belly and inhaled. He began to rub his face against Harry’s flesh.
Draco knew that he could never actually have Potter though . . . or so he’d thought.
Harry groaned and ripped the piece from his ear. “Oh yeah, because that’s how you woo Hermione, is it?” hissed Harry, before quickly tossing it into the toilet and flushing (he knew Ron wasn’t entirely to blame for this mess, but he was the reason Harry found himself bold enough to be where he was). Harry turned back to find Malfoy blankly watching him, one pale eyebrow arched high. “Don’t give me that look, Malfoy. Just keep going.”
"Obsession," Zabini deadpanned.
Draco and Potter exchanged one fleeting, terrified look.
Potter finally gazed at Draco’s face. Green eyes shifted back and forth between Draco’s grey ones, before sliding down Draco’s pointed nose and landing on his dry lips.
She sighed. “Locks work perfectly fine for my family. We live in a good neighborhood, which helps, I suppose. We only had a break in once when I was very little, and nobody had been home. My father has been considering getting one of these recently developed ‘security systems’ that sense the doors and windows using a digital monitor.”
“You sound--everything,” Harry gasped, as he stroked himself almost painfully. Harry was probably making a fool of himself but in that moment, he couldn’t have told up from down.
“What were you doing in here, Dobby?” he asked, slow and thoughtful as to slightly scare the creature.
“Dobby is not being scared, master Draco, sir. He is not," said Dobby, though he had begun to tremble again.
Harry and Draco walked side by side into dinner feeling grand about life in general. It was like the entire hall took a collective gasp as Harry Potter smacked Draco Malfoy on the arse and were afraid to let it out until Draco Malfoy smirked at Harry Potter and swayed away toward the Slytherin table with his pointy nose upturned like his neck wasn't covered in hickies.
“Let’s talk about yours,” she sneered back at him, suddenly falling into a position Draco had never heard of before -  held demi bras with her leg still out behind, bent to ninety degrees at the knee. “You aren’t a girl, Malfoy, and you are never going to be able to lift anyone with a figure like that. Why isn’t Ms. Jean on you about it?”
Since Draco had yet to return to a man of leisure, he found himself extremely bored at this point in the summer, and the room seemed non-threatening so he spared some of his time to have a look inside. Draco didn’t understand why but the next day he went back, even knowing he risked his father’s wrath. The day after that, Draco was in the room tearing through drawers like a mad wizard and found an alluring journal . He decided to take it because he admired the vintage binding and had a random notion to start his own Hogwarts journal this year. Draco supposed maybe one day he could give it to his own child. Which was weird, considering he had never thought of having his own kids.
