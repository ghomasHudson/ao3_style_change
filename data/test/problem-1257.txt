' my horizons and culture... Right?”
''As per the late Lord Potter's will, I am young Harry's magical guardian and financial adviser. I approve your choice to be bounded to a magical human. It shows that you will make sure young Harry will receive the proper education befitting someone of his station and his species. The Vaux De Villiers have a good reputation with Gringotts, despite their Dark Lord ancestors. I will require reports of young Harry's physical, mental and magical health every fortnight and I will come to see the progress every month to make sure that my ward is safe, healthy and developping well. Also, I will be deciding if young Harry's magical education is appropriate. I will not have my ward become a dark lord or a tyrant because of the dark arts.''
Dudley was currently living with his father's sister, Marjorie Dursley; she took her nephew in after the death of his parents. Vernon and Petunia had left England a few days after the death of Harry's parents to New Jersey for Vernon's job. Things were going well and the family was prospering: Vernon had a promotion, Petunia was the neighborhood's queen bee, Dudley was going to daycare and made many friends... All came crashing down one day when Vernon and Petunia decided to spend the day together and stayed home; they had sent their son to daycare to make sure that they were alone. They wanted to reconnect and have another child... Unfortunately, at the same time, a Mafia hitman had been tasked to take out Vernon after the man had turn back on his end of a deal. His name was Richard Kuklinski and was known as the IceMan. His aunt and uncle were his newest victims and Dudley only survived for being at daycare. Their bodies were found in the overly large freezer in their home as the man didn't have time to take away their corpses. They were only discovered three days later when the police decided to investiguate the Dursleys disapperance.
Making her way to Dudley's room to check on him and feed him, Petunia decided to call her last and only sister alive for help. If anyone could help her, it was Rose. She would know what to do with the baby and what could be done to protect her family. As usual, Dudley made a little fuss about his bottle; he wanted soda instead of his milk. Thankfully, both Vernon and herself were very strict about Dudley's health; no candies or soda before noon.
They stayed like this, talking and flirting with one another. They didn't notice the time pass and soon the sun set and the fairy lights illuminated the dancefloor. Everyone was having a good time and the band left to make place for a D.J. to play more modern music, bringing the couples to the dancefloor. Marco noticing how his friends kept on flirting and enjoying the companionship of the two young men in red uniform. Marco really wanted his friends to have fun, they deserved it. So, he made his way to the D.J. and asked them to play a few songs that he knew his friends would love. A large self-satisfying smirk graced the Spanish half-Veela boy's lips when he saw the two Durmstrang young men pull his friends on the dancefloor. Neither of them were going to miss the opportunity presented to them.
Ragnok was still not convinced that Durmstrang was such a good idea. After all, he did not want Hadrian to be exposed to the dark arts. The Brittish Ministry of Magic and Dumbledoor would risk another war with the Goblin Nation if they heard so much as a whisper of Hadrian learning the dark arts.
As for Ginny, she couldn't believe her friend had come to England after telling her the danger the Ministry and gold-diggers were to Harry's health. The young woman knew perfectly well that her mother had been pushing and plotting for years to have her marry the young heir of three ancient and noble houses, but Ginny had no interest in him. She loved Blaise with all her heart and was happy with him, she didn't want any other man. And yes, she was young and had all her life ahead of her and maybe her relationship with Blaise was just a teenage romance, but she was HAPPY!!! She was happy and didn't want to throw that away to become some trophy wife for a guy, she knew was gay, just so her mother and her parasite of a brother could get their hands on the boys money and influence. While, it was true that both Harry and Blaise were supportive of her dream of becoming a fashion designer and neither of the two cared or were against a woman working, she wanted to achieve her dreams with Blaise.
Harry half listened to Peter ramble on about his thoughts about werewolves and half watched Malfoy coach Lena through the spell. Harry noticed for the first time that Malfoy wasn’t using a wand – he was demonstrating the motion by hand for Lena to copy.
the one that's been avoiding
“Worse things have happened.” Malfoy turned his head to face Harry. Harry turned, too. Flecks of snow clung to Malfoy’s eyelashes. His lips were flushed pink from the cold. Harry wanted to reach out and touch them. He turned away, blushing, trying to shake those thoughts.
"I need to explain the risks before we commence the procedure." The witch began, placing the glass cabinet in the centre of the room. "Mr. Potter, can you be certain that you love this man? If not, this procedure will kill him." Her voice was nonchalant, as if she didn't particularly care either way. Harry scowled at her.
"Why did you decide to become an Auror?" Malfoy asked when he had finished, genuine curiosity and interest shown on his face. Harry told his tale, too. About how he didn't know what else to be, what else to do with his life. About how he felt like he owed society a debt. About how he didn't think he had the skills or talent for anything else, and that it was what people expected of him. Malfoy listened the entire time, nodding and frowning at parts of the story, never taking his eyes off Harry. It felt so
“Don’t you have papers to mark, Potter?” Malfoy rebuked without looking up. Harry cursed under his breath, having forgotten all about the stack of parchments waiting a few aisles down. He hurriedly went back to his desk and gathered them. In his hast, he spilt an ink pot. Swearing, he cast several cleaning charms.
"I promise I'll explain, Harry. Just trust us."
Hope you enjoy Chapter 6: Meddlesome :)
“Believe it or not, I was offered a job, Potter.” He drawled, raising his eyebrows.
"I-I came to ask if you want your magic back." Harry said boldly.
Harry said nonchalantly.
"Yeah, yeah. I'm good." Harry smiled.
“Lucky guess.” Malfoy said quietly. Through Harry’s peripheral vision, he could see Malfoy watching him cautiously. He felt heavy under his gaze.
“You kept up with the papers, then, while you lived as a muggle?” Harry asked. Harry noticed Malfoy’s cheeks heat slightly. The man didn’t take his eyes off of the view in front of him.
with Malfoy, then.
It was Draco. Harry leapt up.
“Actually, I was going to say you owe
Christmas at the Burrow was as wonderful as ever. Harry caught up with all the Weasleys he hadn't seen since the Christmas before and listened to Bill's tales of dragons and Ginny's gossip about the other Holyhead Harpies players.
Hagrid led Harry out to the pumpkin patch in his backyard. “Look, Harry! Maxime sent me some Abraxans of me very own! Aren’t they beautiful?” He beamed and motioned to a large, straw nest in the centre of the yard. Harry stepped closer. A group of small, winged horses slept happily there, all palomino and white fur.
“But Malfoy’s always been so self-righteous and… well,
“Well… er… I…” Harry started, and then huffed. Overwhelmed by the both of them, he stormed from the office and retreated to his private quarters.
this man?  The whole thing made him itch. He was so annoyingly
After a long silence, Harry spoke. “Malfoy, I just wanted to say that I-“
“Don’t flatter yourself, Potter.” Malfoy jeered, “Everyone knows.” At Harry’s confused expression, he only grinned slyly.
And there's been nothing I can do about it except watch and hope that
And then, the loud crack of apparition shattered the silence around him. Harry crouched behind the broken bed, drawing his wand. He heard footsteps – two people, at least.
After what felt like hours of searching, Harry was inspecting behind a towering black bookshelf when he felt the stones beneath his feet creak. Stones weren’t supposed to do that. Before long, he’d managed to scoop up the loose brick and the ones beside it, revealing a small trap door. He opened it and felt a gush of wind rush out of a tunnel.

“Ah, Professor Potter. If you aren’t too busy snooping behind bookshelves, join us - your expertise will surely be useful.” Malfoy called slyly. Harry heard some of the students’ snicker. He felt his cheeks heat traitorously.
The weather was better than expected, though, which was a silver lining. The air was bitingly cold and the ground was frosty, but the sun shone in the sky nonetheless. He walked circles around the grounds a few times and then found a place to settle, staring out over the horizon. He looked at the pictures he had of his parents, and of all those who he'd lost during the war. His mind healer had once suggested that he use the day as a day of general mourning, so he did.
would be better suited to teach muggle studies than an ex-blood supremacist.
Three days later, Harry sent Draco his wand back without a note. He never received a response.
“Not unlike some of the protective measures you witnessed around this castle during the War. I assure you, Potter, leaving these grounds is not possible. It is not a risk I’m willing to take. Please keep the destruction of school property to a minimum”.
After a truly memorable berating from Madam Hooch, Harry was in his classroom with a group of very muddy, dishevelled fifth years who were about as interested in learning about how potions can be used to counteract some curses as Harry was teaching it.
“I’ll have you know, Potter, that this is a very expensive shirt you’re soiling. You’ve just declared a war.”
“Glad that’s over for another 6 weeks.” Harry said, removing his robe and pulling a hoodie over his tee. Neville nodded. Malfoy stepped out of the entranceway and almost ran into Harry.
love that person. The risk is death.”
“An old treehouse.” Malfoy said.
Eventually, Malfoy raised his eyebrows. "Can I help you, Potter?" His voice was rough and scratchy.
That night, Harry convinced Hagrid to lend him one of the Abraxans to take Draco flying. Draco had mentioned that he couldn't fly a broom since he relinquished his magic, and Harry wanted to share that with him. Draco held onto his back and cried and laughed as they soared through the night air. They ended up on the Quidditch pitch, laying beside each other, holding hands and looking up at the constellations.
The two of them watched the sun until the sky was dark. Malfoy pointed out the constellations that replaced it, tracing them in the air was his finger. Harry listened, watching the man in barely concealed wonder.
“No, it’s fine. I just haven’t seen this place since… well, not since the Battle.”
"It's been a fucking madhouse here since Rose turned three. Terrible twos my arse!" Ron groaned, heading into the kitchen. Harry followed and leant against the counter as Ron worked through a pile of dishes.
Almost two weeks had passed without a word from Draco. Harry had tried to owl him to no avail. None of the students or the other professors knew where he had gone, either, so Harry turned to McGonagall. He trudged up her steps and again let himself into her office without knocking.
end up loving you.” The moment the words left Harry’s mouth, he knew he felt them deeply. It hit him hard. He was, evidently, starting to love this man. Harry Potter was
“Professor, it’s a Saturday. And you aren’t the Slytherin Head of House, so…” A student said, looking at him with disdain.
Robards nodded solemnly. “You’re free to go, Potter.”
Charms? Was Malfoy helping the students with all of their subjects?
“Yeah, but you didn’t have to take it.” Harry realised this was the wrong thing to say as soon as the words left his mouth. He wanted to kick himself as Malfoy slumped slightly, running a hand through his silvery hair.
"Done." The witch said. "Looks like you do love him, after all."
But the breakfast service came and went and Harry was onto his fourth bowl of cereal, staring intently at the entranceway, when a silvery tabby cat interrupted his thoughts.
Draco looked like he was sleeping. His eyes were closed, dark eyelashes underlined by deep bags under his eyelids. A slight flush of colour sat high on his otherwise pale cheekbones. His silvery-blonde hair swayed gently around his face in the preservation bubble, making it look like he was underwater. His limbs were very still, hovering in the bubble.
Draco's memories flew through Harry's mind, too quickly for him to register. And then, they halted.
On Wednesday evening, Harry asked McGonagall for permission to pass through the Hogwarts apparition wards to visit Ron and Hermione. McGonagall had eyed him suspiciously and reluctantly agreed. Harry apparated three times to reach their cottage, not wanting to risk such a long haul in one go.
Draco looked over at him, eyes questioning.
Harry held his breath as he moved towards the man, worried that a wrong step might send them both back to the Shrieking Shack, Draco's greying, limp body dying in Harry's arm. He stopped a foot away from the bed. He watched in earnest as Draco's chest rose and fell with steady breaths.
life decisions
Harry scoffed, and laughed. He didn't want to bring it up again, not today, anyway. He was contented to just
"Best friend, yes." Malfoy replied, smiling. There was a glint in his eyes that Harry almost recognised as mischief.
Ron led him into the warm living room. It was as overstuffed as ever, a mustard yellow couch pushed against the side wall and books and children's toys scatterred about the hardwood floors. Hermione had turned the space into somewhat of her personal library, lining almost every wall with bookshelves, save from the fireplace and couch. Back when Harry and Ron were Auror partners, they often consulted her collection for help with cases.
The morning sun shined bright on this warm Samhain day of the year 1997. The students of the two foreign school woke up early and excited. They could not wait to place their names into the cup and see if they could have the honor of representing their school in this tournament. The champions were not simply participants in this gladiatorial style competition; they represented the standards and excellence of their school. If a student performed poorly, then the school performed poorly and considered the weakest school in Europe until the next tournament. Losing the tournament or finishing third was not frown upon by the public. What people frown upon was when the student in question performed poorly, did not prepared for the task or acted dishonorably. Therefore, it was paramount to the visiting school to keep an iron tight grip on discipline.
Fourth year was the year of personal hell for Dumbledore, first off, he had to expel three students from Hogwarts after they had gang raped a first year half-blooded girl from Slytherin. It would have been swept under the rug if Snape hadn't been so damn focused on his snake and more on Harry Potter like he would have if the boy had come. The Potion Professor had noticed something odd about the girl and had found out the whole sordid affair. Of course, being the slimy... err...
And so, Mrs Figgs never reported to Albus Dumbledoor about the Dursley's departure for America or about the treatement of little Harry. Albus never knew that the Dursley family arrived in New Jersey for Vernon's work; he never knew that Harry was never raised by Petunia and Vernon; he never found out that Rose established herself with Harry in France (one of the few country in the International Confederation of Wizards where Albus Dumbledoor had no influence or was regarded with any respect what-so-ever) and never leaned that the Dursley family died at the hands of a serial killer three years later. Not even Lord Voldemort had caused such a disruption into the old manipulator's plans as much as the Evans sisters. He never knew and when he would learn of his failed plans, it would be far to late to do anything.
“… And now, for the second champion…”
Music started playing and Draco immediately recognised the tune. They actually expected him to sing
Dumbledore replied that as the Headmaster of the hosting school, he had the right and obligation to verify if any visiting students were a threat to his students. Anker snapped back that this was his right and obligation if, and only if, a visiting student had a criminal record. Harry Potter had no criminal record and he was never accused of any crime what so ever. Dumbledore replied that since Harry was seventeen and an adult, he did not need his Headmaster with him to have a conversation with him.
There were some, however, who profited from not having Harry Potter at Hogwarts. First the Malfoy family, instead of sending his son to Hogwarts to make friend with the Boy-Who-Lived and thus having more influence, Lucius sent his son to the recently improved and better adapted school of Beaubatons Academy. It would allow Draco to learn more about his roots and be close to home enough for Narcissa. It would be beneficial to the boy, since the Malfoy family didn't have such a dark reputation in France; which meant that no one was intimitated by Malfoy's threats and forced the boy to fight his own battles and forced him to see the world differently. He gained true friends and learn that he could be great so long as he craved his own path instead of staying in his father's shadow.
“Three, you will be allowed to bring your wand and anything else that YOU and only you have built for the Task. This will show us your skills in Magic. Now, we all know that cheating is as much a tradition of the Tournament as the Goblet itself. So, if you find out what the Task is all about and wish prepare potions or objects to help you, you are allowed to. We encourage you to do so. You cannot bring in people or outside help however.”
Fourth year was the year Harry Potter discovered his sexuality. He discovered that women have no effect on him; they just didn't do anything for him. Men on the other hand... It all started in the bathroom. He had walked in on the girls Quidditch team showering one evening, thinking they were all done for the day. He seriously was shocked when he walked in and saw the ladies showering. So shocked that he had stood there for two whole seconds before running out yelling apologises to the ladies. It was later on in his bed that he realised that, despite having seen some very naked, wet and curvaceous young ladies, he didn't feel the need to take care of a ''special business''. Rather, he felt bad for the girls. Some of them were twelve and still growing; puberty was starting and it was scary, the last thing they needed was to have a boy judge them on their bodies. The next day, Harry went to each and every girl to apologise for the situation. A few days later, Harry walked in the bathrooms with his team to shower and get ready for supper. As he undressed, he started to notice just how muscular and well-endowed his friends were.
Hogwarts was in not bringing up his “victory” against the Dark Lord as it was the day his parents died. The majority of the student body had the decency to blush and leave him be after that; those that did not get the message were sharply and quickly told to leave him the fuck alone by the others.
''In hindsight, maybe they will accept Harry just to piss Dumbledoor off!'' proposed Rose.
Alexander Vaux De Villiers felt it to be an insult to his family's honor to accept any sort of money when the family had sworn to protect and raise Harry. He gave his word as a gentleman that he would raise and protect Harry as his own child and when one does such a promise, then one pays and must own up to the responsibilities of raising a child. This inclueded any financial necessities. If they had monetary issues, than Alexander could understand the stipend as it helped the family with the strain of raising an extra child. However, the Vaux De Villiers were anything but poor! Raising and paying for one child would never even begin to chip at the iceberg that was the family's fortune; so it would dishonorable to accept any kind of financial help from Harry's vaults or family.
From now on, Narcissa would be removed to a small cottage in a remote part of Germany with one house-elf until the divorce was finalise. He couldn't deal with her anymore. Her disrespect, her arrogance, her defying his position, her constant disregard for his autority in his own home (by that, he meant, her allowing people he had never met before into the heart of the family manor without his knowledge even after he told her not to)... She was to leave tonight and not come back. The divorce would be happening and if she dared to stall by not signing the papers immediately after receiving them, he would then call forth their marriage contract that stated that Narcissa had to give at least an heir and a spare to the Malfoy family. Only his love for his wife had kept him from forcing it upon her. By refusing to have another child after Draco, she had broken the contract. An annulment for breaking marriage contract was far more damaging to a reputation than a simple divorce, after all.
She knew that there was a chance that Harry would not be chosen as the Durmstrang champion, but that did not matter. If anyone asked why they suddenly came back to England after all these years, Rose would simply asked them why and how was this any of their business. After all, it is not like anyone there was their friend or a family member. They could use any excuses they wanted, the bottom line was that Rose came back with her husband and that was it. Of course, if anyone of authority, like the Head of the DLME or the Minister, were to push and insist, they had a multitude of reasons and excuses.
Rudely and abruptely, Mrs Figgs closed the door of Mrs number 5 Privet Drive and ran as fast as her old legs could to her fireplace to contact Dumbledoor. Unfortunately for her, Mrs Figgs did not see Mr Whiskers, one of her many kneazles, and tripped over him and cracked her head on the edge of her fireplace. Hearing the commotion, Mrs number 5 and Mrs number 7 Privet Drive entered the old lady's house to find her unconcious and bleeding. The ambulance arrive exactly fifteen minutes later to pick up Mrs Figgs. Unfortunately for the old woman, Mrs number 7 watched a lot of medical drama series on television and believed herself to be a professional doctor and decided that Mrs Figgs's head had to be moved as her awkward angle could hurt her in the long run. This had the undesire effect to snapped the old woman's neck; killing her instantely. The first responders could only confirm her death.
Within the first week of Rose taking Harry, Albus Dumbledoor realise that taking over the Potter's fortune and political standing was going to be harder than he previously thought. As it turns out, James never took the Potter Lordship and was even removed from even being considered a potential candidate. Charlus Potter, while a loving and caring father, was not blind to his only son's fault. James was rash, arrogant, spoiled and reckless; he didn't understood the true value of money and never made a sound investement in his short life. His eagerness to sell away the Potter town house, the cottage in Hogsmead and three-quarter of his fortune as the heir of House Potter to finance the Order of the Pheonix without so much a guaranty of return on the money or even a piece of the profit made it quite clear to Charlus that James was not fit to be the next Lord Potter. Therefor, in his will, he gave the Lordship, the fortune and the complete and total control of the Potter estates to his grand-child (regardless of it's gender). In the meanwhile, it would be Ragnok, the Potter's financial adviser at Gringot, that would managed the estates. No one could have access to anything other than the trust fund for Harry; most importantly, Albus Dumbledoor. Charlus Fleamont Potter made it quite clear that the seats and fortune of House Potter were never to be handled by the Headmaster of Hogwarts in any case or capacity what-so-ever.
No one agreed on which school Harry should go to once he turned eleven. Rose wanted to keep Harry away from Britain and Dumbledoor by enrolling Harry at Beauxbatons Academy. Both Alexander and Ragnok quickly veto against it. While french and of good reputation, the school centered mostly on etiquette, charms, enchanting and very little in defense, sports and had a abysmal transfiguration curriculum. Alexander had seen the results of Beauxbaton Academy when his sister had graduated; the french school had turned a promising young girl into another brainless and unoriginal spoiled brat that rejected her family's gifts as it was too
That year Draco learned valuable lessons.
''This came for you a few minutes ago. It's up to you. Do you want to send the letter yourself or do you want Ragnok to deal with this?” asked the older man.
Then there was Durmstrang. While the school offered a very limited study of Herbology due to it's location way up north, the school offered the best Duelling, Defense and Runes classes in the world. Gellert Grindelwald had been one of the many alumnies of the school who had gain the title of Duelling Masters before he even left the shcool (considering that he got kicked out soon after he started his sixth year, it was quite the achivement). His uncle Alexander had gone to the school and he was the most powerful wizard Harry knew. They had a professional Quidditch field, they had the second most student to become world champion Quidditch players after Mahoutokoro! The thing that could break or make the deal was the Dark Arts classes.
Unfortunately, an officer noticed them and started to run after them through the backalleys. They managed to shake the officer of the law when the entered a building through the back door, only to find themselves in the backstage area of the Blue Covent, a Moulin Rouge type of establishment for wizards. The girls were preparing themselves for their show and, to blend in and escape the officer, the three teenagers decided to pretend to be dancers by cross-dressing. It worked well! The officer left once he realised that he couldn't find the brats he was looking for and left. Unfortunately for Draco, he was grabbed and pulled onto the stage after being mistaken for one of the girls.
The real problem was Severus Snape, Head of Slytherin House and Potter-hatter. Would he keep his mouth shut or would he go directly squealing to the Headmaster? The man had spent the entire summer complaining and grumbling about the idea of having mini-James Potter in school. He often said that he would rather face off a hippogriff herd than put up with the insufferable spoiled brat that Harry Potter would no doubt be. So maybe he would keep it a secret, just so Dumbledore didn't try and succeeded in bringing Harry to Hogwarts through his machinations. Besides, the child didn't need to be harrassed or bullied by a teacher, no matter what his father had done as a teenager. Furthermore, the young man was ambitious and had dreams; he was quite cunning to have sent his letter only a day before the deadline, thus giving him more time to prepare himself and less to his opponent. Snape was known to favor his snakes, since no one was on their side. He, however, valued and encouraged any and all students who had ambitions and was willing to work for it; just look at the annotations on the Weasley twins homework that helped them find books to better themselves and build their dream joke-shop. From potions to Runes to charms to economy to management to law, the twins owed much to the book references that Snape gave them. Harry showed some cunning, ambition and determination to achieve his dreams. It was something Snape could respect (albeit grudgingly) and so he would help the boy in his ambitions.
No! No! She would not allow her sister's child hurt or taint her own son by accident or otherwise. Besides, Vernon would never accept the boy in his house without using physical, verbal and emotional abuse to vent his frustrations. Even if they were safe from the terrorists, it would only protect her family if the boy survived the beatings from Vernon.
“Is Durmstrange Institute more like Hogwarts or more like Beauxbâtons?” asked Sue Li, intrigued by the students in red.
The Ministry officials left as well, passing him by and almost turning their noses at him. They were not happy and had no problem showing it. In the end, he was left alone and in the cold. How long had it been since he had felt like this? Too long and it was frightening for the old wizard. He needed to speak with Harry about the prophecy and his role in the upcoming war. He needed to warn the boy about the Minister being Lord Voldemort and push him towards a proper light family. Yet, the boy refused to speak with him, refused to be deferential to him as his parents were, snapped at him and walked out on him. That little brat!
Everyone stayed silent and turned their attention to the french students arriving; many hoping to see how well the french students fared in the cold climate of Scotland. It was well known that the Beauxbâtons Academy for Magic was in the south of France, therefor the students were not used to cold weather and would no doubt be freezing.
he possibly could... Which was quite unfortunate for the pedophile as the large floor-to-ceiling was right behind him when he was sent flying backwards. If the blast of the spell hadn't kill him, the fall from the fifth floor to court yard below sure did the job.
birthday.
Harry knew that Ginny had no bad or romantic intentions towards him. They had gotten along this summer at her brother’s wedding and he knew that she was head-over-heels for Blaise Zabini. She had talked his ears off about how much she loved the Italian young man. Ginny seemed nervous and worried, constantly looking at the door, throwing detection and silencing charms like candy during muggle Halloween.
Lastly, in came the Minister for Magic of Great Britain, Minister Marvolo Salazar Gaunt. Tall, dark and handsome, the man had an aura of power that forced you to notice him. The man had come into his inheritance in early 1993, after the Philosopher Stone had brought him back to his sanity. Taking up his grandfather’s name and claiming to be the, recently discovered, illegitimate grandson of Morfin Gaunt, the man made his debut in the Wizengamot with style. He had come into power at the beginning of the year, when it was discovered that ex-Minister Fudge had been caught with his pants down with a barely seventeen-year-old intern. It had been a shock to Dumbledore and Marvolo when the majority of the Wizengamot had voted for him to step in as Minister. Dumbledore had taken great pains to make sure the man was vilified and that he actually was the illegitimate son of Lord Voldemort and was attempting to bring back his father. The Headmaster’s supporters bought it, the rest of the Light Party… Not so much. Let us just say that the man’s influence had considerably waned in the past few years.
that cuts through anything from stone to flesh. The spell was never dark to begin with; it was invented when wizards in
Draco left the room and went to his bed. Meanwhile, Lucius explained very carefully and through gritted teeth just how disgusted he was with her and this was the last straw. How dare she forced the heir to the Most Ancient and Noble House of Malfoy into a courting he did not want to or with a man she barely even knew? Lucius was going to make inquires about the man to make sure he was the type of man who presented himself to be, as all head of houses and fathers should do. What gave her the idea that she could invite people into his family's house without his approval? What made her think that she had the right to choose who court HIS heir? He would not allow such disrespect fly by.
So it was decided. With nothing else left to discussed, the humans and the goblin made their way to the
“That would be Draco Malfoy. The
Rose refused to pay for the entirety of the funeral and wanted to have a smaller, more intimate ceremony. This was a funeral of their common nephew's parents, not a Las Vegas show! In the end, everything was settled by Grunnings company policy that provided funds for the funeral.
“To make sure that this rule is respected, an age line ward will be drawn around the cup. The cup will be locked into a room during class time, only one student may enter the room at the time and we will only allow thoses who fit the prerequisites. The cup itself was charmed to only accepts thoses who meet the requirements. Now, the names of the three champions will be called out tomorrow night during the Halloween feast. You, therefor, have until five o'clock in the evening. The door to the classroom with be open starting seven in the morning. Now, I can see many of you are starting to doze off, so I will bid all of you a good night.” finished the old man before making a waving motion with his hand, as if he was condescendingly sending little children off to bed.
“Why didn’t you believe that you would be chosen? You managed to summon the chair from the other side of the room without word or wand. I doubt it was just excitement or accidental. To be able to do this, you have to have power and skills. You shouldn’t doubt yourself like this!” said Harry, gently.
Now was time to have fun.
Draco only recently realised that he had quite a reputation at school. If you didn't count the jealous morons that thought of him as a whore, of course. Apparently, he was known a serious bookworm, an eager teacher's pet or as a vicious dragon. So of course, this did not please the young man. He wanted to shake that awful image that others had of him and show them all who he really was.
Blaise barely payed attention to the redheaded ogre that passed for a human that was his girlfriend's brother. How the hell someone as strong, beautiful and kind-hearted as Ginevra Weasley could possibly be related to something as vile as Ronald Weasley? The dark-skinned italian young man turned towards Granger and took a deep sigh.
Draco didn't look up but his cheeks heated markedly. His quill stopped writing. "What did you think?"
When she returned some moments later, she was carrying a large cabinet made from thick glass. It was lined with enchanted, steel chains. Inside it, Harry could sense powerful magic. It was a Slytherin-green, shapeless mass of energy that appeared to be trying to break out of its confines. Draco's body began to tremble beside him.
It took Harry a while to realise they were walking a different way than the way they’d came. “Where are we going?”
“There’s always a fucking choice, Malfoy!”
“I take personal offense to that comment, Longbottom.” Malfoy said, humour in his eyes. He sipped his firewhiskey prudently.
Harry opened the book and turned to the dedication page.
“Why’d you renounce magic?” Harry asked, cutting to the chase. The man’s eyes widened slightly, only for a second. He shrugged exaggeratedly and sighed, breaking eye contact.
Malfoy sat back in his chair. He was silent for a few moments, thoughtful. "What did you think?" he asked. His voice was cautious and sincere. It suddenly occurred to Harry that what he thought might actually
When Harry looked up, Malfoy was sitting cross-legged in an armchair, reading over parchment and sipping tea.
By the time Harry was finished reading over Peter’s parchment and chatting with him about some of the intricacies of wolfsbane, most of the students had packed up for the night. “There you go, Peter. Try to cut it down a bit before it’s due, yeah? I’ll see you in class on Thursday.” He smiled encouragingly at Peter as the boy neatly packed away his belongings and said goodbye.
"I've been living as a muggle in France. I have a literature degree and three bestselling fiction novels." Malfoy offered, his voice void of emotion. Harry's mouth fell open again in shock. McGonagall looked between them uncertainly.
By the end of it, Harry was in tears. The story told was not unlike the war he and Draco had fought, once. Harry thought vaguely about the paradoxes of war as entertainment in fiction. Abraxas, the protagonist, had made a snap decision in the final moments that changed the course of his life forever, choosing the course of action he felt was right over that which his family had dictated to him. Harry wondered if Draco still thought about his own actions in the war and the choices he made in the end.
When Draco pulled away, Harry felt like all the warmth had left his body.
“Actually, Potter, I don’t use magic, wand or otherwise.” He replied nonchalantly, as though this was a simple fact of no consequence.
As soon as the last students had filed out, he approached Draco and took him into his arms.
And then, memories that Harry didn't recognise.
books?"
“How’d you know about that?” Harry looked at him. Malfoy’s cheeks flushed.
They will never love me – not truly, anyway – so I’m afraid it’s a lost cause.”
Hermione grimaced. "Yes, Harry, I do. And I think I know why you're asking. Come over next week and I'll tell you about it."
As the Christmas break approached, things were busy at Hogwarts. Harry had his hands full with his classes and the extra tasks McGonagall assigned him after the kitchen incident. He planned to spend Christmas week with Ron and Hermione, though, which he looked forward to. In the meantime, he tried not to fixate on the business with Draco's magic - he was treading carefully. He knew Draco's patience with him would wear thin if he kept bringing it up. He needed to wait for the opportune moment.
Harry stared at him for a moment longer. He noticed how shiny Malfoy’s hair looked, sweeping slightly across his face in the breeze. He looked away again, swinging his feet.
don’t want you here, it’s just…” Harry ran a hand through his hair awkwardly, trying to find the right words. “I don’t know how to talk to you, that’s all. I don’t think there’s anything I can say to make it right, or whatever.”
Chapter 10 coming soon :)
is enough to save you. But now we're out of time. I don't know how it's possible, but after that first night... after you kissed me, I saw the vision again, in a nightmare. Some part of me just
Malfoy and Harry both fulfilled their duties that year. Harry found the horcruxes and made sure the prophecy came true while Malfoy became a Death Eater and let his comrades into Hogwarts. They were fighting on opposite sides of the same, horrible war. Harry didn’t know who Malfoy was anymore.
"Sorry." Harry choked out, finally swallowing the lodged food. Students could be heard giggling and murmuring amongst themselves. McGonagall returned her attention to the hall after a final, warning glance in Harry's direction, and continued her announcements.
Before long, Harry was practically running down the stairs to the dungeons. He called out the password and burst through door, striding into the centre of the Slytherin common room. About two dozen Slytherin students looked up at him, having stopped their conversations to locate the source of disruption. Harry cursed under his breath. He’d forgotten it was Saturday.
A huge thank you to everyone for the comments, kudos and bookmarks! Hope you enjoy Chapter 8: Sheer Will Alone :)
The day of the war, Draco and his parents were taken into custody. They were held with the Carrows, who believed them to be cowards and treated them as blood traitors. They were underfed and subjected to dementor attacks.
?! Potter! You scared the life out of us. I was beginning to think this place may actually be the most haunted building in Britain.”
Neville shrugged and quickly grabbed his pawn before Harry’s could smash it.
“Yeah, and I need you to shut off the apparition wards.” Harry cut to the chase.
When Harry went on the run to hunt horcruxes, he thought he’d never see Malfoy again.
"Sorry, Potter, I've got to run. Appointment. It was nice talking to you, though." He smiled at Harry and rushed away. Harry felt warm inside - having Malfoy's friendship showed a side of the man he'd never seen before, and if he was honest with himself, he really fucking liked it.
Harry propped himself up on his arm and peered down into Draco's face. Teary grey eyes met his. "Draco, please."
“Wandless magic now, aye?” Harry asked, apparently not able to help himself. Malfoy side-eyed him. Harry noticed a slight flush against the other man’s pale cheeks.
"I know what you're thinking, Harry, but I really don't think you should meddle with this."
"Here's all the books I have about magic reversal." She said, taking a seat beside him and cupping her mug.
Before long, Harry was climbing up through a crawlspace on the lower level of the shrieking shack. It was cold and decrepit, splintered walls and broken furniture strewn across the floor. Every surface was covered in a thick layer of dust and the heavy, sticky scent of residual dark magic from the War hung threateningly in the air. Harry shivered. He’d made it, though, and all he needed to do was step out the front door and apparate away. He cast a few diagnostic charms in the entrance hall to make sure there were no dark traps still lurking around – all clear. He reached for the handle, and then stopped. Tentatively, Harry turned his head and peered up the old, decaying staircase. This was the first place he’d ever spoken to Sirius. Memories flooded him, and Harry was suddenly feeling very nostalgic about the whole thing.
"When I wrote it, I never suspected that an opportunity for you or Granger to read it would ever arise, so I figured my dignity was safe. Please, Potter, don't make this any worse for me than it already is. A great deal of pride was swallowed when I sent you those books." He motioned dramatically.
He wondered if Malfoy was still in touch with Lucius. This quickly spiralled into thoughts of all the death eaters that were rotting in Azkaban because of Harry’s testimonies and the memories of the horrible trials he’d spoken at. He hated thinking about… about any of it.
, somehow. For 10 years, Harry. I read every article, every memoir posted in your name, all the public Auror records. Everything and anything that might give me some context so that when the time came I could
"... And it is with great pleasure that I announce the new muggle studies professor." McGonagall said. Harry and Neville returned their attention to her as she continued. "This wizard has lived as a muggle in France for a number of years. Like you all, he attended Hogwarts as a child. He was unable to join us tonight but, regardless, I would like to announce his recruitment to Hogwarts’ excellent teaching team. Please give a round of applause for Professor Draco Malfoy, the new head of Slytherin house."
Malfoy stopped, sandwich lifted halfway to his mouth, and turned to face Harry. "What?"
The two of them looked up at Harry when he entered. Malfoy stood abruptly, knocking the book to the floor. "Potter, I didn't expect to see you down here." Malfoy said, pulling at the ends of his shirt uncomfortably.
Harry felt excitement ripple through him as he read, ready to see the series through. He turned to the dedication page.
Harry finished that book, too, and was shocked to see the light of the early morning sun shining through his window. He cursed under his breath for having stayed up so late. It was a Saturday, at least, but Gryffindor was versing Ravenclaw today and Harry wouldn’t miss it.
They stood like that for what felt like an eternity to Harry. He ached for Draco to make the next move. He felt like he’d never wanted anything more. Draco frowned and let out a shaky breath. And then his hand moved into Harry's hair, gripping his head, and the contact felt like electricity. Draco kissed him, and Harry kissed back as though his life depended on it, closing as much space as he physically could between them. Draco’s free hand cupped Harry's jaw, and he kissed him easily. Harry's lips were malleable against Draco's mouth, opening obediently for him. Draco's tongue moved slowly. Harry gripped Draco's neck tighter. His free hand moved to Draco's hip, almost frantically, and he hooked his finger in the other man's belt loop, pulling him closer.
Chapter 4
''I see. So you are related to Miss Lily Potter and you would like to raised Heir Hadrian James Potter. Is that correct?'' asked Ragnok as he looked through the lease of custody.
Here is the fourth chapter. It's longer than any I have written so far, so please forgive me for the mistakes. Leave me your thoughts and ideas. I'm currently trying to find a way for Draco and Harry to meet. It has to be love at first sight and Harry is the dominant partner in the relationship. Any ideas?
The Goblet burst into blue flames and spew out a piece of parchment. It shot through the air and was swiftly caught by Dumbledore. Taking a moment to read the name, the man then gave a wide grandfatherly smile towards the students and called out:
Harry simply nodded and casting a Notice-Me-Not, he left the classroom for the Queen Anne’s Revenge to warn his Headmaster at once. The sooner this over with, the faster everyone could prepare. He felt a lot more secure and safe now that he had an idea of what to expect from Dumbledore and his sycophants. Their plan would never have worked if Ginny had decided to keep quiet or to participate. He had made sure of it, but the knowledge of who to look out for and what to expect of them would save him many headaches in the future.
During his fifth year, Harry noticed that more and more people were sucking up to him; much to his repulsion. Heirs and spares of noble and pureblooded families simpered, flattered and batted their eyes at him in the chance that he would look their way. Fifth year was the year where betrothal contracts were usually made in Eastern Europe and everyone wanted to snatch the young Runes and Duelling prodigy that was also the heir of not one, not two, but three Ancient and Noble families. The Potter fortune in itself caught a lot of attention, the Black fortune and standing got people going crazy and the Vaux-De-Villiers... Now that made them desperate. For you see, Uncle Alexander had asked Harry to be his heir as he could not have children of his own. Harry had obviously agreed, making him irrisistable to gold-diggers.
Here is the next chapter. Please tell me what you think. Should I simply jump directly to Harry's seventh year and the tournament or show snippets of his education and life during his time at Durmstrang. Again I am open to suggestions and ideas. A special thanks to Fuckoff12 for their great suggestion! :)
on the Great Eleven Schools! It is humiliating!'' said Alexander as he showed the results of his research on school to the goblin.
Despite everyone acclaiming him as a hero (for something he actually did this time), Harry felt no joy. He had killed a man. Granted the man wanted to rape his friend and kill him, but still. He had taken a life! What thirteen year old would not have some sort of guilt or problem with this? Thankfully, his family was there and got him counselling, along with Alcazar who desperately needed it.
They made it out to the cabaret club just in time and ran back to the Malfoy's townhouse. Once there, the three teenagers bid each others goodnight and the two french teenagers left in a Taxie Magic to their home. Not sparing another moment, Draco ran to the Floo, vanished to Malfoy Manor, ran up the stairs to his room, jumped into bed, realised he still wore his wig, threw his wig in his dirty clothes basket and threw the covers over his head just as his mother poked her head through the door.
“Oh, I don’t have the best grades or am the bravest. I’m a bit of a disappointment to my House. I entered the Tournament because I thought that, on the small chance, that I was chosen, I could prove that I wasn’t a joke and bring honor to my family’s name.” Said the young man with blond hair. “I’m just so shock and flustered that I’m the one chosen over everyone else in my year! It’s just… Wow!”
Alexander smirked at his nephew's cunning. This would cause unnecessary obstacles in Dumbledore's path once he received Harry's refusal. Ragnok had over an entire year's worth of vacation time stored up, Rose had always wanted to visit Germany (aside from her very secret and dubious work) and the Vaux De Villiers residence in Berlin could rival that of the Black's Grimmauld Place in terms of wards and protection.
Once done, Harry made sure that the ink was dry before heading to the owlery. Harry instructed the owl not to stop and simply drop the letter before leaving as soon as possible. The owl had to be careful as it could have a few charms placed on him, something Dumbledore would not hesitate to do. He watched as the majestic bird made it's way to Scotland and wondered if he should have sent a letter to his cousin Dudley.
Harry wasn't blind or stupid by any stretch of the word. He knew people had plans concerning his person and would resort to underhanded tactics to get what they wanted from him. It didn't matter what they wanted from him, money, fame, glory, political influence or power... They would never get their hands on him! He was no longer an heir; he was seventeen and an adult, he had gain his Potter Lordship, he had allies from France and the rest of Eastern Europe, he was a representative of a foreign country, regardless of the fact he was born on English soil. He had rights and he knew them like the back of his hand! No one was going to trap him and use him! Not the Ministry. Not the student population of the school. Not the trash that passed for the media in this country. Not the British society. And more importantly, not Albus Dumbledore!
No, the boy could not stay here! He would not be safe...
“Two, the Task with be on the 24
As for Minerva... She admire the bold choice and the respectful manner that the boy had responded. It took courage to decide your own fate, to choose to take another path than the one others wanted you to take that was sometimes easier. No one would fault the child for doing what was expected of him and enter Hogwarts; going against an entire country just was terrifying for an adult, never mind a child of eleven years old. Yet, he stayed polite and honorable in his reply. Minerva completely agreed with Harry when he said that going to a school that didn't fit you simply to follow someone else's ideas or to avoid confrontation would be disrespectful to his parents hard work and sacrifices. After all, Lily and James had fought against a dark lord and lost their lives so their son could have a future; they worked hard and sacrificed plenty for him. Just like them, Harry was going against a more powerful opponent and was willing to fight to have the future HE wanted. So McGonagall was going to help the boy in his courageous fight for his freedom and life.
Hospital (Saint-Martyr hospital) to have the soul leech remove. It took less than three minutes to see that the soul leech was in fact a Horcrux and was immediately removed. Ragnok kept the soul fragment in a jar and promised to see if it could not be used to find any other made by Lord Voldefarts, as Alexander liked to call him. It would prove successful and the best thing was, that Harry would never have to hunt them down.
Imagine their surprise when the french delegation stepped out of their carriage with navy blue cloaks with white trimmed fur. At the head of the delegation of french students stood an light blond haired student with molten silver eyes who seemed to be given instructions and advices to the others. To Hermione, it was clear that he was the “leader” of the french delegation, most likely the Head Boy of Beauxbâtons. It would be a good for her political career to be friendly with him if she wished to have contacts on the continents. To Ron, it was clear the boy was a Malfoy, therefor a future Death Eater and someone that he had to keep Harry Potter away. Plus, he had to get him to fall for Ginny! Bloody hell, this year was going to be ruff...

"Where's Mal... Er, Professor Malfoy?" He asked the group.
Back at Hogwarts, Harry went straight to the quarters he knew to be Malfoy's and banged on the hardwood door.
When Malfoy was released, Harry was waiting for him on the doorstep of Malfoy Manor. Malfoy had to be lead to the door by Aurors, too weak to stand on his own. Harry had shouted at them and taken Malfoy into his arms. They both sobbed.
"Furthermore," Hermione continued, "the magical core needs to be held in a particular type of place, or else it fights to go back to the person it came from. Only, if it does make it's way back, it can't reenter them and eventually fizzles out. I've heard rumours that the Department of Mysteries stores them. Once a person has had their core removed, they have to go back for follow up treatments every six months."
That was it! There was a way to get to the Shrieking Shack that Harry hadn’t known about. He knew for a fact that it wasn’t the passage at the Whomping Willow, because Dumbledore had gotten rid of it after the encounter with Pettigrew.
“No.” Harry interrupted. “It’s not that I… no. Malfoy, it isn’t that. You’re great with the students. All the Gryffindor’s that have you for muggle studies rave about your classes. And it isn’t that
"If waking me up in the middle of the night and cursing at me is your way of checking in, I'll forego this friendship right now, new beginnings be damned." Malfoy drawled.
"Malfoy, I want to help you. I've been learning about magic reversal and it seems really fucked up. It’s beyond me why you would
Harry grimaced. Malfoy had chosen to relinquish his magical core. “Why?”
Six months after the war, Ron and Hermione moved into a cottage near the Burrow in Devon. Harry moved in with George above Weasley's Wizard Wheezes. Together with Ron, they reopened the shop and erected a statue in Fred's memory.
Malfoy thought for a moment, then his eyes widened. “That was
Harry stumbled out of the Ministry, wand finally in hand, and blinked up against the bright sunlight. He apparated straight from the street, already feeling woozy, and was slightly surprised when he landed at the entrance to St Mungo's Hospital without any apparition-induced injury. Harry looked at his dishevelled appearance in the window before stepping inside. He looked like shit, he knew, and cast a quick cleaning spell.
So if Malfoy actually
to stop your death from happening. As it turns out, we're soulmates. And-and it's all a bit fucked up, Harry, because if we don't do something, you're going to die. What you need to know is that I love you and I'm going to do everything I can to stop that from happening." His face was serious, resolved.
"What're you doing out here?" Harry asked, "it's freezing." He sat down on the blanket.
"Sorry about the intrusion, mate, but we don't have much time. So if you could y'know, move it along." Harry whipped his head around to see Ron standing on his other side, wand illuminated. When Harry opened his mouth to argue, Hermione rolled her eyes and grabbed him. Harry felt the sickening pull of Apparation tug at his naval, and he landed in the entranceway of Ron and Hermione's house.
you. I've followed you through the papers all these years. I've seen your face in my head, Harry,
Granted, Harry hadn't seen or even heard about the man in years, but surely
"I didn't know about it, Harry. Malfoy showed up here two weeks ago - he'd found our address in your apartments. He told us everything about the vision predicting your death so we could formulate a plan to save your life." Hermione explained. "We didn't tell you sooner because we were worried involving you might somehow set it all in motion. But now we're at an impasse, Harry, because you're the only one who can get Malfoy's magic back. We've figured out everything we can, but we can't move any further without seeing the vision for ourselves and trying to piece it together from there..." Hermione spoke cautiously. She edged her chair closer to Harry and took his hands into her own. "Harry, I know you're not going to like this, but we can't risk telling you everything. It's risky enough that we've even told you about the vision and the soulbound. You know how prophecies work - more often than not, they're self-fulfilling. We're only involving you now to restore Malfoy's magic, and then you have to let us go on without you, until we can figure it all out."
“Right, um…” Harry looked around for an excuse. “I was just, uh, coming to make sure you’re all studying enough. Which you are. Very good.”
The day after the war, Kingsley Shacklebolt was named Minister for Magic and the Ministry began to rebuild itself. That same day, the remaining members of the Order of the Phoenix met to count their losses. Harry had marched straight up to Shacklebolt and told him that he was going to be an Auror, starting now, thank you very much. The entire Order had refused, citing that it was irresponsible and unreasonable for Harry to throw himself into battle when a war had just been won. Harry hadn't known what to do with that. He was furious at everything and nothing in particular. He spent the rest of that day tearing apart 12 Grimmauld Place by hand, since Hermione had confiscated his wand for good measure. Ron helped - he was angry, too, evidently. No one tried to stop them. They ended up falling asleep in the hallway, sobbing and holding each other.
“I haven’t been here in years.” Malfoy said. “Crabbe and Goyle and I figured out how to get to this place from Hogwarts in third year. We used to come here sometimes, for mischief and such.”
"Er, same?" Harry said sheepishly, rubbing the back of his neck. Pinky rushed over to him and took his hand, leading him to a seat beside Malfoy's. "Mr. Harry Potter, sir, you haven't taken your lunch down here in yonks! I would have prepared your favourite, sir, if I'd known." Pinky fussed over him, conjuring plates and utensils and pumpkin juice and piling his plate with sandwiches.
"Very well, then." The witch said shortly. She lead the way through dark, disconcerting corridors. Draco and Hermione walked some paces ahead of Harry, Draco carefully checking every open room to make sure it wasn't the place where he'd seen this damned vision of Harry's supposed death. Then, he would turn and nod to Harry, and Harry was allowed to follow. Harry hated it, of course.
Harry frowned. He cast a tempus charm and cursed. Late to class again, apparently. He pulled on the same clothes he'd been wearing the night before, cast a cleaning charm over himself, and went to teach his third years.
Malfoy wasn't there, which was fine because that
“What-“ Harry was cut off when Peter nudged him, pulling his attention away from the man.
The next morning, Harry woke in his own bed, where he had fallen asleep with Draco the night before. Draco was gone again. Harry grumbled, wanting the opportunity to wake up next to the man he couldn't get out of his head. Harry read the note that was left on the pillow beside him:
for as long as I can remember."
Harry opened his mouth to protest, rage simmering within him, but McGonagall raised her hand. “I suspected you wouldn’t take kindly to this news, Potter, so I’ve arranged for your classes to be covered today and you’ll have the weekend to get all of the escape attempts out of your system. I expect you to return to classes as normal on Monday. Ms. Granger and Professor Malfoy have assured me that they will pass on any information that they deem non-threatening.”
"Sorry, Harry. We'll explain everything. Please come sit and have some tea." Hermione shoved some clothes into his arms and then moved towards the living room. Harry got the horrible feeling that something was wrong. He followed Hermione and almost fell over in shock. There, in
Harry thanked Hagrid for his candour and reluctantly took one of his rock cakes for the road. He tossed and caught it as he walked slowly back to the castle, thinking. Guilt rippled through his stomach – he’d been unnecessarily rude to Malfoy that first day when he started. The man had saved Harry’s life after all – twice, as Harry recalled. He’d call it even, except he figured the Sectumsempra incident cancelled out the fiendfyre thing. Harry shuddered at the thought. He tried to shake the memories.
“Elite Potter. I called you in with the rest of the staff because I want you and everyone here to be cautious. I'm sure you are already aware of Herr Dumbledore's... Less than healthy interest in you and your family. Given that we are on enemy territory, I want everyone to know that should Herr Dumbledore try to have a discussion alone with Elite Potter, you are to send me a patronus and stay put where you are. Do not allow the man to have any time alone with Elite Potter! I do not care if he is the Headmaster of the hosting school, if he is the Supreme Mugwump or if he is Merlin's reincarnation! Elite Potter is MY student, he obeys MY rules, he will not be speaking to the press or the government or anyone else without atleast one of us there or if his uncle is present. Do I make myself clear?” asked the man as he pinned with his stare all of his subordinates.
The best part, according to the Daily Prophet, was that once Dumbledore had heard that the event was still going on even after his rejection, the old man had acted all offended and had tried to play it as if the other schools were attacking Hogwarts and Britain. Of course, no one payed any mind to his whinning since he had been invited before and without even consulting with his students or his government, he had made the decision to refuse the invitation. As such, Britain was not invited because they refused through their spoke person. Thus, they had no ground upon which to complain or play the victim card.
Fourth year was the year Draco came to the realisation that he was attracted to both the female population and the male population. It all started on a Saturday morning, when out of the blue, Draco had awoken before dawn and couldn't fall back to sleep. Unbeknown to him, Draco had caught the eye of an upper year by the name of Armand De La Fontainebleue; the seventh year found the young reclusive english boy to be absolutely delicious. It had started with one friendly conversation and, buy the end of the month, they were a couple. Of course, after what happen last year, Draco was far more guarded, not that Armand could or would blame him. They had dated for over four months when Armand started to let his hands roam in territories that was better to ask permission than ask forgiveness. Draco had made it clear that he was not ready or interested at the moment, but he was not oppose to some gropping and snogging, so long as it was over the clothes. It was a few weeks before the end of term that Draco finally accepted to give himself to his lover; he trusted Armand and he loved him. He felt safe, loved and felt ready for this. It had been... Not disappointing, but not great either.
As the goblin prepared the paperwork, Rose went to get her fiancé. It took less than five minutes for Rose and Alexandre entered the living room. Ragnok was quite surprised at the young german man. Alexandre Balthazar Vaux De Villiers, next Monsieur Vaux De Villiers, was a 6 foot 8 tall man with large shoulders, muscular frame and golden eyes. His hair, rich and dark cupper, so distinct of his family, was pulled back into a spiky mess. Dressed in a completely black three piece suit with black gloves and only a snow white tie, Alexander Vaux De Villiers cut an impressive figure; one that reminded of his late father, Simon Vaux De Villiers .
Before Harry could reply or ask for more information on Draco’s feelings, the door opened and the third competitor entered with their head held high (which was to be expected), a smug smile on their lips (again, they were chosen as the best of their respective school. So some smugness was normal), a spring in their step (who would not be happy to represent their school (unless it was done against their will)) and a look of pure happiness in their eyes.
It shocked Dumbledoor, but it shocked the Brittish Wizarding World even more. A goblin in charge of an heir to a Most Ancien and Noble House? What sort of madness was this? The ministry (at the urging of the Chief Wizard of the Wizengamot) tried to overturn Charlus Potter's will; to no avail. The will was legal and accepted by none other than Minister for Magic, Alcazar Drimwald. The brave minister who had duel to the death Lord Voldemort when he was rising in force in the late 60's. This will was irrivocable and no one was willing to start a war with the Goblin Nation over the matter. So the purebloods and Dumbledoor bit their tongues and accepted this horrible decision with sour smiles.
“This summer, after we all came back from Charlie’s wedding, mom and the Headmaster pulled me aside and told me how important it was that I made you fall in love with me. How it was important for my family to get out of our so-called poverty that I marry you at any cost! Even if I have to baby-trap you! They went on and on about how I had to guide you towards the Light. My mom even proposed to brew weak to medium strength love potion to get your attention and later on, keep it. She was one step away from telling me that I should go to a brothel and learn how to please you in bed!” said the girl in a whisper, still terrified that someone would hear her despite her wards.
For his part, Harry understood perfectly that while his words were taken into account, they meant very little to the blond. Only Alcazar's actions could determine the opinion of his dancing partner's friends. He couldn't even blame Draco for it. How many times had he covered for his friends or vouched for them when they got into trouble at school?
The last person to profit from Harry not being at Hogwarts was Lord Voldemort. The dark lord managed to obtain the Philosopher's Stone in the spring of 1992, regain a body, free his loyal servant Bartemius Crouch Jr., kill Wormtail for never even trying to help him or contacting him during his time posing as a teacher, gain a new face, take his father's manor for himself and started to recollect his sanity bits by bits as each one of his Horcruxes that were destroyed were returned to him (Since their containers were destroyed the soul fragments had no where to go but back to their original owner (I know that is not how it works, but it fits in my story)). Before the end of the third year, Lord Voldemort will be in full power and ready to try and take over Magical Britain; albeit this time more subtely and less crazy.
Malfoy was looking at him curiously. They stood in silence for a while, and then Harry laughed, a sudden memory coming to mind.
and Harry's heart stopped. He pushed past the welcome witch and threw the door open, clambering into the room as though he was trying to reach the surface after being held under water for too long.
"Oh, is that so?" Malfoy took a seat beside Harry.
, my soulmate, and when that wasn't enough to stop me, when my magic was almost completely gone, it showed me
The three of them trudged through the snow to the Broomsticks and chatted about their classes. Malfoy spoke about his new curriculum for first years to acclimatise those with muggle parents to life with magic. It surprised Harry how passionate Malfoy was about it. When he spoke, his eyes lit up. Harry was enraptured by his every word.
“There are parts of this you can’t find in those books Granger gave you, Harry. Things you don’t understand and things that I don’t particularly feel like sharing.” He frowned. Harry let out a frustrated groan, regretting having told Draco previously that he was reading about magic reversal.
Two months had passed since the war, and the three of them were asked to testify at Death Eater trials. Shacklebolt had said that their testimonies would swing the verdict. The three of them testified in favour of life sentences in Azkaban at the Carrows, Dolohov, Rookwood and Macnair trials. Hermione and Harry testified in favour of an Azkaban life sentence for Lucius Malfoy, and against imprisonment for Narcissa and Draco Malfoy. Ron declined to speak at the Malfoy trials.
with him.
Draco smiled up and him. "I know it's a lot to ask, but I need you to trust that when the timing's right, I'll tell you everything."
we’re talking about here. He could write an entire library and it wouldn’t make him any less of a git.” Ron argued, pushing back Hermione’s hair to fit in view. Hermione looked disgruntled.
Harry ate dinner quicker than usual and skipped his weekly floo call with Ron and Hermione. He had a stack of parchments about the properties and uses of the expelliarmus charm that needed grading and he was feeling more irritable than usual. He headed to the library and plopped himself into a desk in the back, spreading the papers across his table. Barely two inches of parchment into his grading, Harry was interrupted by hushed conversations from a few rows down. Harry, unable to help his inner Auror sleuth and general nosiness, stood and moved quietly among the bookshelves until he could hear the conversation. Through the books, Harry could see a group of about twelve students, all different ages and houses, gathered around a circular table, pouring over textbooks. Some of the older students were helping the younger with essays. Malfoy was moving easily between them, peering over their shoulders and pointing things out for them to amend. He was wearing a loose, tan-coloured linen shirt and dark jeans. Muggle clothes again, then. Harry almost rolled his eyes.
"'Mione, do you know anything about people removing their magic?" Harry asked tentatively.
Harry joined Ron and Hermione's efforts to locate Hermione's parents. The trio travelled to Australia via muggle routes. They found the Grangers in a week, and the next week was spent in and out of St Mungos as their memories were restored. Harry, Ron and Hermione stayed with the Grangers in Southeast England for a month to plan their future.
“Have you given anymore thought to what I said. Y'know, about finding your soulmate, getting your magic back, etcetera.” Harry side eyed him. Draco sighed.
Later, he trudged up to the third floor window. Part of him was expecting to see Malfoy there, hoping to see if he was OK. No such luck. He stared out over the lake for hours before he returned to his room and fell into a fitful sleep.
"Oh, 'arry, almost forgot!" Hagrid called when Harry finished his cake. "The Abraxans are teens now. Age quick, they do. Thought you might want to give them a ride before they get to big."
"Harry, my magical core showed me
“You know it?” Malfoy asked with barely-concealed surprise, eyes wide.
“Hey, d’you remember that time I threw snowballs at you out here, back in fourth year?” He chuckled.
In fourth year, Harry and Malfoy’s friendship faltered for the first time since First Year. Malfoy was openly jealous and cruel about Harry being a Tri-Wizard champion and went out of his way to make Harry’s life miserable. The truth was that losing Malfoy’s friendship had made Harry miserable without the extra taunting. Once, late in the year, Harry had walked in on Malfoy making out with Blaise Zabini in the bathroom. He’d been overcome with a feeling that he later recognized as jealousy.
In third year, the after-hours Quidditch practiced continued. It wasn’t so secret anymore. They started owling sometimes, too, and Harry would complain about how bad he was at potions. Naturally, he and Malfoy started studying together. They often caught up in the restricted section of the library. Hermione came sometimes, too, and formed her own friendship with Malfoy. The two of them bonded over their mutual love of knowledge, and Harry had beamed.
“Not unless you can look me in the eye and tell me honestly that you don’t want your magic back.” Harry was defiant, serious now. He stood, too, facing Draco. Draco glared, and then turned to walk away. Without thinking, Harry reached out and grabbed his arm, stepping towards him. Draco didn’t resist – he turned, and he was so close to Harry that his breath hitched. For a moment, all Harry could do was stare up into his steely grey eyes.
On day 8, Harry braced himself for a fight when Head Auror Robards limped over to his cell and swung the door open. Harry stood, fists clenched at his side, and waited for the other man to speak. Robards materialized a chair out of thin air and sat across from Harry, leaning forward on his knees. Harry held eye contact, refusing to cower away from his old boss out of stubbornness.
"No chance." Harry murmured against the back of Draco's neck. "We didn't finish our conversation last night. You... distracted me."
"So it worked?" Harry looked up at her, not taking his hand from Draco's. She simply nodded, and in a quick movement, left the room.
“Hagrid… Malfoy mentioned to me that he doesn’t use magic anymore.” He began.
“Draco, let me help. Tell me what you know.” Harry's voice was low. He tried to ignore the heat he felt at their proximity. Draco snatched his arm out of Harry’s grasp, but didn’t move away. He looked down into Harry’s face, considering him.
"It's just a nightmare. I'm not dying, I promise." Harry said softly.
After some time, they stopped outside a heavy metal door labelled simply with 'The Core'. The small witch turned to them. "You'll have to wait here." The three of them shared a look and nodded, stepping back and allowing the witch to enter. She seemed to seep through the door.
The two of them sat beside the nest for what felt like a long time. Harry listened to Hagrid talk about his Care of Magical Creatures classes and some of the things Neville was growing in the greenhouses. Harry waited for an opportune moment to ask about Malfoy and took it when Hagrid fell silent after a longwinded story about flitterby moths.
Harry was frustrated, but he knew McGonagall was as stubborn as a brick, so arguing would get him nowhere.
. It always should have been him that died. The Prophecy had lied - it should have been him that was hit by that curse.
Within seconds, the room was alive with energy. Draco was frozen on the spot, eyes unseeing, as light seemed to tear through his abdomen. He fell to his knees and Harry fell with him. Harry heard the clank of chains hitting the ground, and then an ear-splitting shatter as the glass broke. Then, the room was encompassed in a bright, green light. Harry thought he might lose consciousness. The light seemed to suffocate him, entering him through every space. And then his mind raced with memories, his hand still firmly clutched in Draco's.
“Well, I’ve forgiven you, too. Not that there was really anything to forgive. We were kids and all, and you didn’t really have… Anyway, yeah. Thanks.”
The wait was excruciating, and Harry had nothing to distract himself. He ate three servings of lunch just to give himself something to do and wrote about a dozen angry letters to Ron and Hermione, all of which were ignored. He even managed to get through a stack of grading he’d been putting off. All attempts at socialising with Neville and Hagrid were a bust – apparently, Hagrid was still ‘gone campin’ and Neville was avoiding him like the plague. He played a game of solo wizards chest and watched the hours slip slowly by.
“I finished your series.” Harry said. He and Draco were sitting on the floor in Draco's loungeroom with their backs propped up against the sofa, lesson plans scattered across the table. They had stayed in the DADA rooms after Study Club, long after the students had left, working together on their curriculums. When it started to grow too cold for comfort, they relocated to Draco's rooms.
Harry woke to the sound of screaming. His eyes flew open in a panic and he looked around him. Silk silver sheets, dark walls, dark floorboards, where... And then his hand collided with cold, sweaty skin, and he turned. Draco was in bed beside him - Draco's room, he remembered. But something was wrong. Draco was crying out in his sleep, his face contorted. Slivers of moonlight illuminated the man's body. His hands were clawing at his chest, tracing deep scars.
wasn't the reason Harry was keen to eat in the kitchen again. He ate his food and then returned to his Quarters to floo Ron and Hermione - he'd missed their floo call that week, too.
Harry fidgeted restlessly as he waited for the old, brick stairs to slide into place. He threw open the door without knocking – earning him some disgruntled murmurs from the unsuspecting portraits on the wall - and began marching through the office.
was printed, before flipping it over.
Harry. Was Malfoy avoiding him, too? Whatever was going on, Harry didn’t like it.
It only took two chapters for Harry to be enthralled. He couldn't put it down. It was a tale of friendship, bravery, facing evil. It ended on a cliff hanger, of course, so Harry picked up the second book.
“It is! It doesn’t have to be so complicated. Unless – fuck, Draco, is your soulmate dead?” Harry’s eyes widened in horror. He ran a hand anxiously through his hair.
"Finally!" Ron cried as his head popped up in Harry's fireplace. "Haven't heard from you in ages, mate! Thought Malfoy might have knocked you off or something."
Harry wanted to curse death for sparing him so many times and taking so much from him instead. He wanted to curse prophecies, and soul bonds, and magical cores, and every single step he had taken that had led to the place he was now. He had found love, against all odds. He had a fucking soulmate, for Merlin’s sake. All of that was a feat that Harry had truly believed was impossible for him. And, of course, it had been ripped from him with violence, before he even had a chance. Like so many that Harry had loved before, Draco Malfoy was a casualty of a war that Harry had tricked himself into believing ended a long time ago.
"What the fuck happened to you?"
“Fuck, Potter, I’m sorry.” He ran his hand through his hair anxiously.
“It’s not.” Harry said stubbornly.
"This way to the surgical room." The small witch said, levitating the cabinet as they walked further along the hall. The surgical room was unexpected, to say the least. It was a padded room that appeared to be made entirely out of steel underneath the padding, not unlike the padded cells Harry had seen in movies. Hermione was asked to wait in the corridor as Draco and the small witch entered, followed soon after by Harry.
“Look, all I’m saying is that you give him a
“Harry, you can’t be here. We need you to come with us, right now.” Hermione's face was fearful and serious. She held her hand out in front of her and kept her feet planted firmly on the ground, as though she was scared to move. Ron had his back to hers now, watching out over the staircase, wand raised.
“Ah, yes. The Saviour Leaves Ministry in Despair.” Malfoy motioned grandly with his hand. Harry remembered that particular remark as the title of a very incorrect recount of him leaving the DMLE, written by Skeeter.
He followed Peter out from around the bookshelf and found himself standing face-to-face with Malfoy. “Malfoy...” He greeted cautiously. He was suddenly aware that this was the first time he’d spoken directly to Malfoy since... well, probably since the war. Malfoy folded his arms easily across his chest and raised a quizzical eyebrow. His face was cool and unreadable, grey eyes peering into Harry’s face.
Sorry this took so long! I hope you enjoy!
The next few days flew by and Harry hadn't seen or heard from Malfoy. He tried not to think too much about it, really, he did, but he did think it was strange.
his magic back, he'd have to find his soulmate.
“Hey, Malfoy, d’you want to come to Hogsmeade with us for a drink?” Neville asked cautiously. It was customary for Harry and Neville to recoup at The Three Broomsticks after their meetings with McGonagall. Malfoy looked at Harry briefly, and then studied Neville.
For ten days after that, Harry did nothing outside of screaming and crying and sleeping in Ron's bed at the Burrow, clutching his invisibility cloak and the sliver of mirror Sirius had gifted him. For the first time in his life, he wanted to be back in the cupboard under the stairs, ten years old and oblivious to the atrocities he would live through. Occasionally, Ron or Hermione or Ginny would curl up next to him and cry, too. Every two or three days, Harry would go downstairs to eat. Molly would hug him as if she was terrified of letting go.
Ron, who had just walked through the front door, bolted up the stairs towards him, Hermione close on his heels.
By the end of it, Harry was beaming. Malfoy had changed, but the parts of him that Harry had secretly admired in their schooldays had stayed the same. His ambition, his wit, his general prudency, his intelligence. They'd all passed the tests of time.
"Hermione, what the actual fuck?" Harry looked around incredulously. What was going on?
He and Mini soared through the sky, dipping and diving, and Harry laughed. It reminded him of the first time he'd ever ridden Buckbeak, or his first time on a broom.
Draco sighed. "I've been selfish, Harry. I couldn't resist this opportunity to just
"I don’t understand. We don't even know what he's been up to these last 10 years." Harry protested, leaning forward and speaking quietly as though Malfoy couldn’t hear every word anyway. He tried to ignore the weight he felt under Malfoy’s gaze. He felt betrayed by McGonagall – he’d gotten so used to his life after the war and the re-emergence of Draco Malfoy had really thrown a spanner in the works. The very thought of wondering the halls of Hogwarts alongside Malfoy again brought back memories of their years leading up to the war.
“Fairs fair, Potter. En garde!” He stood suddenly and flung a snowball at Harry, who was already moving away. He dodged it marginally.
"Hermione?! What the..." Harry sat up, causing Hermione to step away from him, and looked around. He was in his rooms at Hogwarts. How the fuck had Hermione got there?
"Now I'm just dreaming." He nestled against Harry's chest, his body shaking. After a few moments, his breathing steadied. Harry felt his eyelids droop, and drifted back to sleep.
(Pass River, in english) in Brittany. The family's castle showed so much of the dark and less than glorious, but necessary parts of the French Wizarding World. Books, paintings, weapons, artefacts, armors, war engines, jewelry and so much more was on exposition for those who wanted to learn more about the dark in France.
It was in fourth year that Harry passed his NEWT in Runes and was offered a chance to enter the Warding classes only offered for sixth and seventh years. He broke Grindelwald's duelling scores for fourth year, much to his teacher's joy. Alcazar and Victor visited Harry to his house and met Auntie Rose, Uncle Alexander and Uncle Padfoot and Uncle Moony.
