"Gin," Harry says, shakes his head with an incredulous laugh. "Gin, I don't need you to be anything. I just need you to be — to be you, whoever that is right now. You don't have to be anything else."
"Still getting defensive, then," Ron mutters, and then clears his throat. "It just feels like you're still in that mindset, you know? Like at St. Mungos. Like you still think you have to… to be there for him or something. I just don't think you have to anymore."
He'd let his mouth run with the course of his emotions and had ended up snapping, said an unkind thing—
"And nothing. It's just…" It was just strangely endearing, seeing him like this. "It's just rare. Seeing you not be a grouch. It's like…" He paused, frowning in thought. "It's like muggles finding bigfoot."
The closed ceiling expands into open skies. Draco lowers the wand, a tremor in his hand, in his chest, but the spell comes easy to him now despite it all. He puts the wand inside the drawer and closes it. He lays down on the bed, stretching his body across the mattress. He stares up at the scatter of stars above him, folds his arms over his abdomen. The chokehold in his throat relaxes into freer inhales and exhales of air.
Harry paused. "I… I didn't feel like it was… for me, you know." He didn't feel worthy of it, of help and of learning to move on, after all the deaths that he felt responsible for. There were people that needed it more, that lost too much because of him, and deserved it too. Even with the ambiguous wording, there was an understanding in the other man's eyes, as if he knew what he really meant.
"Do you, um... like children?" Harry asked, trying to stave off the dark and uncomfortable energy that had taken over the space between them. "I mean, you probably had to, didn't you?"
Ron frowns, bemused, and then narrows his eyes. "Do we want to know?" He looks over at Harry, and then turns to Hermione, who looks equally puzzled and unsure if she's interested. Harry, on the other hand, may be more curious than anything.
Over the course of several days, Draco seems particularly withdrawn, his mouth small and serious. He smirks less, laughs even lesser, and looks tired all the time, scarlet circles sinking his eyes in.
Draco had walked in and halted at the sight of Harry, and Harry halted at the sight of him, a small stumble just before his feet settled on the ground again, still with the remnant of a broad grin, fading.
"Your notes and stuff," Harry says, right as Draco is pulling it close and taking off the lid. "From school."
"Maybe," Potter says, opening his eyes, meeting Draco's. His voice is level and low. "There are some things you need to ask yourself. Like, is it me that you're in love with? Or is it just some dream of me?"
His home was a yellow suburban house, not much different from what it'd been at Privet Drive, only in a different location. There were two people in his living room when he was turning into the room next to Dudley, who had halted in his steps. There was a young woman, who Harry assumed would be Olivia, who stood as she saw the two of them.
He spends the next few minutes idly drawing a rabbit, the same thing all over again with the lightning scar and the round glasses, but now with a messy mop of black-shaded hair and a carrot for a wand. He writes
He remembers those dreams like he's lived them as fast as in days, even though he knows it didn't feel so when they were happening. There are certain memories that he still remembers with such clarity, down to the year and what he was wearing. It's the strangest thing, then, that he can't remember much of his actual childhood anymore, and much of this life has become a hazy assortment of time and memories by now. He remembers everything that happened to him in the war by the loom of a terrible memory or moment, a knowing of what was going to happen, that
plan on going back to his dorms at lunch to take out the Marauder's Map. He doesn't really plan on requesting the kitchen house-elves for some extra food. He doesn't really plan on finding Draco at the edge of the lake after.
"Close your eyes," Draco said. Harry did, so Draco could wash his hair. "Your relatives...they were fools. They were fools because they couldn't cherish somebody who needed nothing to become good and kind, because that was just what he was."
"Sometimes it's partially held up by positive emotions of even one of the parties. You know, like, if one person's in love?" Hermione said. Harry snorted at that. She shrugged, laughing too. "Yeah, I know. Impossible. But just putting it out there! There's also, maybe, if there's some sort of physical contact... That manufactures positive emotions in almost every kind of bond, really." Harry could not bring himself to snort at that. Hermione gave him a quick glance, and then back down to the book, tapping at a line. "Sexual pleasure is the peek of emotional highs in such bonds, the relieving effects of which can last for days after."
Harry slung an arm over the back of the bench, rubbed a hand over his curls, watching the two of them, smiling faintly.
Harry smiled, elbows atop the table, shoulders a little low and rounded as he held the camera. The screen blurred, focused again on Draco's face, on that slight raise of his brow. The morning light, soft and faded, fell on him through the large-panelled café window. "Knut for your thoughts?"
When Harry spent a bit too much time staring at the cap, tentatively contemplating whether Malfoy had just bought something solely for him and was trying to conceal his intentions—Malfoy hated red, didn't he?—Malfoy snatched the cap off his hands with an exasperated sigh and placed it on his head himself. Harry was sure he looked as ridiculous as he felt, with his wild and untamed raven hair spilling out from the sides.
"No, for Merlin's—" Harry said, looking around him quickly. Everybody seemed bemused. He closed his eyes. "No. Whatever. I'm going."
"I'm quite used to it. My mother's always been excessively affectionate. And Slytherins were all a physical lot, so… I grew up fairly comfortable."
In the quiet of the afternoon, Draco finds himself thinking of him. He tries not to, but he ends up doing so anyway.
In the dark of a room full and suffocating with his own sorrow, Draco was tugging him up from his neck with a grip to the sides of his hair, hands coming onto his cheeks and maneuvering his forehead onto his own as he was saying, over and over,
It took him a while to get his voice back again, and say, "Big D." The carefulness of keeping his voice even, his expression casual, came through. "Surprise seeing you here."
, because we don't have any positive emotions between us. Neutral, maybe, like when we ignore the fact that the other even exists. And don't even get me started on how absolutely annoying and
a desperate sort of fear. He breathed, tried to calm down, lowered his voice, "And can we please stop acting like I was the only one that didn't want this damned
Xavier added, which skipped over Harry with no meaning. Hence the curse kept acting up in sporadic breaks of time, resisted the distance between them and encouraged physical contact
But Harry wanted to know everything now, if the procedure worked, if everything went okay and the lifespan of the bonding curse was cut down. Harry
"No. Not… this was after," Draco says. He clears his throat. Potter has gone very quiet, eyes snapping up at him, his brows furrowed. "I don't know who it was. I was just… I was walking down Knockturn Alley. I didn't notice him coming. My mother had to… it's a big part of why she made me come back here."
"Yeah, I get it," Ron says, grimacing with a wince. They take a left turn out of the classroom and to the corridor, grabbing Hermione's hand.
The ongoing commentary is background noise, the rest of the game a blur, for the way Draco can't stop looking at him. He flies beautifully, as he'd always had, with the wind whipping his hair wilder, colour in his cheeks and the sun swathing him as golden as itself, the determined focus of his gaze.
And so, all that it meant, and the thick layer of gunk that had furled itself around his heart every time, was locked away inside those moments too.
and Harry tells him it is, but he doesn't know how comforting it is to hear that when his dreams were more real than reality itself.
“Voldemort sent Nagini to kill whoever was guarding it so she could get past, but don’t worry, I helped stop it and now we’re all friends.” He pauses. “Except Voldemort, we’re not friends with him. Obviously.”
“Nothing is more important to me than you and your mother,” Lucius says intently, and Draco wants to believe him, he wants that to be true so desperately it hurts. “But there are things going on that you don’t understand, and I need you to be a good son, a good Malfoy.”
Viktor shrugs. “On a broom, we are all the same height. Did you end up taking alchemy? You never said.”
Ron shoots him a look and then goes marching towards his brothers, Harry and Hermione hurrying to catch up. Draco bids a mental farewell to his lunch and goes after them.
Instead, he calls a house meeting. He fills Daphne in first, who gives him an unreadable look that makes his shoulder blades itch, but does agree with his plan, so there’s that.
She nods. “I was so mad at him, but looking back, it was absolutely the right thing to do. My potions are paid for by my work now, but Severus made my potions for me for the rest of my Hogwarts years. He was a huge jerk about it,” she says, but she sounds fond, “Always grumbling, and calling me a trouble maker. He gave me more detentions than all the other professors combined. But he always made sure I had what I needed.”
“Unfortunately,” they all echo. There’s been a few nights when sleeping in the common room had seemed appealing for all of them.
Someone hooks their elbow around his, jerking him to a stop. He turns and snarls, but it’s just Blaise. He can see Pansy and Millie running after them. “Draco, what’s wrong?” Blaise asks, “What are you running from?”
Moody casts a hasty protego, and her spell bounces off of it. She walks forward, her pace measured and even, and casts it again, and this time Moody’s shield shatters under the weight of it, and blood blooms across his chest.
Lucius closes his eyes again, but not like he’s tired. Like he can’t bear to look at him. “I don’t know. I – he’s your age, and I just.” He makes a frustrated sound in the back of his throat, then sighs. He says, almost too softly for Draco to hear, “I want you to be proud of me. I want you to be proud to be my son.”
Harry would make fun of him for it, but he’s too busy laughing so hard he develops a stitch in his side.
Harry thinks that every time he’s gone in that forest, something has tried to eat him. “I’ll ask Hagrid,” he says, instead of voicing that. Something tells him that Angelina wouldn’t care.
Nagini hisses again, and Voldemort’s eyes narrow. He tucks his wand up his sleeve and walks away, and with one more pointed comment in Parseltongue over his shoulder, Nagini follows him. As soon as Voldemort apparates himself and Nagini away, his father turns and crushes him to his chest, kissing his cheek and cupping the back of his head.
It had been a resounding success. Hogwarts had actually felt united for the first time, all three schools had actually felt united. It has been
The same thing must occur to Sharon and Catalina at the same time, because Catalina touches his arm and Sharon steps in front of him, shoving an accusing finger in Dumbledore’s direction. “You let us a bring a new Mother to this debacle when you knew we wouldn’t be able to ensure his safety?”
He’s not in his room when Draco gets back, but Hermione has the Chimera map, so he can’t even stalk him. He hopes he‘s somewhere with George, and not alone getting stuck in his own head. He manages to spend a couple hours slogging through schoolwork before he gives in and grabs his mirror to ask Harry to use the map to find him, but as soon as his soulmate’s face appears in the glass he says, “Oh good, we were just about to call you. Hagrid is back.”
“Because we’re still alive?” Ron rolls his eyes. “If you were just trying to lure us here to kill us, we’d be dead already. I’m assuming the only reason any of us are alive is because you know Harry won’t help you if you kill us.”
He snaps his fingers three times, and Winky appears in front of them. He still gets a kick out of seeing his crest on her. He’d said to take whatever cloth from his room that she wanted to make clothes from, and she’d clearly listened, because she’s wearing a blue silk toga-dress that she must have made from his old sheet set, and it looks a lot better than what most elves wear. Elves can’t use magic to make their clothes, but don’t tend to be gifted with sewing skills, and so most of them just end up wearing pillowcases. He’s becoming more and more impressed with her fashion choices.
Things settle after that, in the last couple weeks of the school year. Snape apparently strongarms the board of the Potions Guild into making a second appearance for Quinn’s potion, which is a resounding success, but probably wouldn’t be enough to get zir a mastery if it weren’t for the several volumes of research and carefully catalogued potions that accompanies it. Snape has, apparently, had Quinn on a mastery track for the past two years, and he could take zir on as an apprentice, but considering ze’s been doing that work for years, it’s all just a bit redundant.
Catalina looks skeptical, but neither Sharon nor Nanaia say anything against it, and Harry doesn’t want to reject the first piece of actual advice that Slughorn has given him. He points his wand at the water, feeling for the bodies heavy with necromantic magic underneath. “Revelio!”
The carriage is out of the question, because his parents are taking it and he refuses to arrive with them like he’s a kid, but he doesn’t want to take the floo either. He could charm his own makeshift carriage out of some spare produce, of course, but while it does in an emergency, he doesn’t exactly want to give the impression that he’s pinching his pennies to the point that he’s enchanting his own transportation. Going on their brooms would be oddly appropriate, considering, but again with the issue of wrong impressions, and with an event of this size impressions are very, very important.
It’s weak, but it works, and the wounds heal just enough that Draco thinks he get enough motor control from his hands to actually perform some spells. It seems to dull the pain more than actually heal anything, but he’s not surprised. Episkey is largely guided by the castor’s will, and it’s obvious Cassius is too worried about messing up the spell to actually do anything truly helpful. “Thanks,” he says, instead of pointing any of that out.
“Don’t,” Snape croaks, looking in the place just to the left of where Harry is, clearly basing this just off of where Voldemort is looking. “Don’t come.”
He’s in a playground, a muggle playground, and he doesn’t understand. Why would Snape be here? What memory could he have?
“Remember when I said Remus and I were restoring my family house? That’s where. It’s still a work in progress, but it has enough protections and wards that Voldemort and his whole army could be standing outside, and they still wouldn’t be able to get in.” He grimaces, “The place really is still a disaster. If you want, we can try and see if we can ward the Weasley’s place up enough, I know they’d love to have you–”
“Why, those hundreds of witnesses are waiting outside the ministry steps,” she says. “My client’s illegal use of underage magic saved their lives after all, from the very creatures the ministry was supposed to be controlling. But of course, there are no extenuating circumstances under the law. My client broke the law, and he must pay the consequences. We must all pay for the consequences of our actions. No one is exempt from this, not even the Boy Who Lived.”
“Filius, what happens to an object’s magical signature once it’s transfigured? Specifically if you’ve charmed it beforehand,” he asks, then blinks, looks back down at the map, notices all the names surrounding Filius’s that he’d been too excited to process, then adds, “Sorry for interrupting.”
Harry shakes his head and pulls out his wand. “She’s alive.” Draco copies him a moment later, Abigail having wound herself around his upper arm and shoulder. It takes him a moment to wet his mouth enough to speak. “
“Yes, and hopefully.” Percy rubs the back of his neck, looking guiltier than Harry’s ever seen him. Percy doesn’t tend to do things that he’ll feel guilty about later. “There’s a catch. It’s in Russia and currently being guarded by a cursed skeleton in a heavily warded chamber, so once we enter we’ll have to physically be outside of the room before we can portkey or apparate away, so there may be some running involved. I have a contact who can get us to it, but if you manage to get it, you have to hand it over to the Russian magical government. You’ll only have until we have to leave to examine it. Also we’re doing this secretly and semi-illegally and, full disclosure, I’m only doing this because the running theory is that only a necromancer can get to it and if you’re successful my contact is going to owe me a favor, and I could
Percy automatically turns back to the exit, but there’s another Death Eater standing in front of it.
They head down to McGonagall’s office, Harry getting a piggy back ride from Ron. “This is so high up. Does everything look like this to you?”
“Additionally,” he says, ignoring his soulmate. “If you harm Harry, if you endanger him in any way, I won’t be using my mother’s solution. I’ll be using my father’s.”
Draco grabs the map, and is partway through explaining the diagnostic spell when Ron sighs and asks, “Exploding snap? They’re going to be a while.”
He turns to Poppy, waiting, and she smiles. “I told him what you did for Minerva. He was quite impressed.”
Hm, on second thought, maybe the reason Harry doesn’t know how to flirt with people is because they’ve been together since they were fourteen.
“It was still you,” she insists, “You were in the chamber, you did this to this girl, and you reanimated all those skeletons!”
It’s definitely not the sort of dress a lawyer should wear to court, but there’s a good half minute where everyone in the room forgets to breath, which he’s pretty sure is her intention. The silence is only broken when she pulls a long pin from her hair, causing it to unravel from its bun so her braids fall out and over her shoulder in a graceful waterfall.
at me like that,” Draco scolds, his cheeks staining pink, but he swims across the tub back into grabbing range. He doesn’t resist when Harry drags him closer, just rests his arms on his shoulders.
Her braids are pulled into a bun on top of her head, the gold clasps that are dotted throughout glinting in the sunlight. She has on a bright red trench coat cinched at her waist, white strappy heels that make her tower over the rest of them, and a shade of lipstick the same color as her trench coat, along with matching nail polish. She’s still the most beautiful woman he’s ever seen, but Harry’s pretty sure he’d still feel that way if she’d shown up wearing a garbage bag.
Harry raises an eyebrow and even Draco is impressed. He may not have been in the same house as Percy, but there’s no castle big enough to escape the rumors of him being a workaholic micromanager. From everything he’s heard since, not much has changed. He’s surprised Percy can even say the word vacation without breaking out in hives.
Well, just great. Maybe he should have just gotten killed when he had the chance. This is going to be a really awkward conversation later.
Harry gasps, rocking backwards far enough that the chair threatens to tip over. “No! Well, of course you do, look at you.” He lowers his voice, although of course it’s still loud enough that everyone can hear him. “Hey, but he doesn’t have to know, does he? It can be our little secret.”
Millie flushes and clears her throat. “I just don’t think you’re being adventurous enough with your investment portfolio, and obviously Fred and George’s shop will be a hit, it’s just good sense.” She looks at Ollivander, “And I know you’ve been looking for an excuse to move your shop to Knockturn Alley to be closer to your brother anyway, so really this is just a bit of very good timing.”
Harry sends off letters to all the Mothers before going to class and kind of forgets about the part where he was subjected to the effects of a cursed necklace until he gives in to Draco’s bribery to go to the hospital wing and finds Sirius and Remus waiting for him.
“Segnis!” he casts, pointing his wand at her chest. The magic leaves him in a rush, and she doesn’t die, so that’s nice. He picks up her hand and presses his fingers against her wrist, searching for her pulse. If it worked, her heart rate should have dropped to about thirty beats per minute. Which would be dangerously low at any other time, but right now he needs her heart to keep beating because he needs her alive, but as slow as possible. The slower her heart beats, the slower the poison is spread throughout her whole body, and the more time he has to save her life.
“I didn’t do it because I’m a courageous Gryffindor,” he says softly, “I did it because he was hurting you, and I wanted to hurt him back.”
She’s not paying attention to them, instead looking past them to where the dark lumps of the pieces of the centaur’s body are laying in the dark. She reaches for her shoulder, then pauses and scowls at Firenze.
He needs supplies, and the lack of muggle money is a bit of a problem with that. It’s the beginning of summer, for another, so obviously the traditional option is unavailable even if he had the funds.
“Do you not want to go with him? I’ll find someone else,” he says. Millie’s going with some girl in the year above them, but he thinks she’d agree to go with his cousin anyway, if he asked. “Or I can tell Susan I’ve changed my mind if you really want to go with me.”
There’s a beat where nothing happens, but before he can get too worried, she appears before him with a crack. She’s not alone.
It’s worth it for the way McGonagall has to stop herself from smiling at him. “Not that I’m aware of, Mr. Potter.”
Lupin watches him go, and waits until he slams the door behind him to say, “You know, I think I actually like that kid.”
“Get the fuck out of my way, or get ready to join Lockheart in St. Mungo’s,” he says, and he should probably be panicking that Snape knows he obliviated him last year, but at this current moment he just doesn’t care.
Lucius shakes his head, but in disgust rather than denial. “What a waste of ink. It’s unfortunate that so many of them are just incompetent rather than actively criminal.”
Viktor moves to get up, but his mother grabs his wrist and yanks him back down, her face thunderous. He tries to pull away, but she doesn’t let him, grabbing onto his arm with two hands.
Harry blinks, and glances over. Both Fleur and Viktor are smiling at him, and he flushes, scratching his nose in an attempt to hide it.
Ginny pinches her brother’s waist, and he squirms away from her, batting her hands away. “What are you planning, Ronald?”
Ron decided he wanted her around the time they were thirteen, but he thinks that if he tries to point that out then she really will set him on fire.
Harry rubs the back of his neck. “Er, it’s not mine. It’s Hermione’s.” Draco is just staring at him, but he doesn’t look upset so he adds, “She wanted you to look at her Potions essay too. If you don’t mind.”
, at a time like this?” he demands. Then the rest of that statement catches up to him, and he thinks of his mother’s letters. “Oh. My dad–”
The campground may be run by muggles, but the town surrounding it is mostly magical. That means the only thing separating him from the floo network is a couple miles of walking, and the one awkward conversation it will take to convince someone to let him use their fireplace.
Viktor’s talking to Cedric and Cho, both who have a large bag of sweets each. “Hey guys,” Harry says, and it’s nice how they light up with when they see him. “Viktor, I thought you were with Hermione?”
She sighs, but doesn’t press any further. The three of them silently walk down to their classroom, and Harry takes a deep breath before stepping inside. “Hey, so, don’t freak out.”
Malfoy steps gracefully off the stage as if nothing has happened, as if Harry’s hip isn’t on fire, as if he doesn’t feels as if he’s just been branded. But he’s not about to grab Malfoy and demand an explanation in front of everyone, so he shuffles back over to his friends and hopes he doesn’t look like he’s about to sick, because that’s certainly how he feels.
“Ah, yes,” she says, “because it is taking so long to be summoning me, with a literal snap of your fingers.”
“Are you going to say something useful, or did you just come here to mock me?’ he asks. “We haven’t even covered summoning spells yet, I don’t know how you know any at all.”
Merlin, the amount of complaining Draco had down about the Gryffindor colors drawing too much attention to the red undertones in his face. He’d sounded like Ron and his crusade against maroon. “Mostly for the press, actually,” he gestures to the people milling around with cameras hanging from their necks. This whole event is going to get splashed across the social pages, and that includes him, whether he like it or not. At the very least it can be of him wearing his boyfriend’s colors, maybe even with Draco if they get lucky. Another story about his sex harem if they’re not lucky, or if any of the reporters make the unfortunate mistake of interviewing Dean or Seamus.
“Yeah,” he says roughly, “I am.” Sirius pulls him in for a crushing hug, and he tries not to worry about how he can count Sirius’s ribs through both their clothes. “Now get along, you’re running out of time.”
Asim steps over the broken class to cautiously press a clean cloth to the patient’s sluggishly bleeding head wound. She doesn’t flinch at his touch, but he she doesn’t do much of anything else either, instead staring through him with glassy eyes. “She casts a sinetimore spell. It backfired.”
“Because if you do, I’ll end whatever hope you have at any sort of gainful employment. Everyone will know you’re a dangerous, blood thirsty, rabid
“OUT!” he shouts, his magic itching and crawling under his skin, “Stop it, stop all of it, get me out of -”
Harry doesn’t even know how he feels about Snape, so he doubts that Quinn does, but that’s hardly the point. “That’s insane. That’s literally insane behavior.”
“That wasn’t your fault!” he protests. “That was all Moody. You nearly killed yourself resisting, you did what you could, and we’re all fine. No one blames you.”
There’s a beat of exasperated silence which he’s unfortunately very familiar with. “Oh, Harry,” Ginny sighs. He can feel Draco doing a poor job of suppressing his laughter from where his back is pressed up against his chest. “Of course they know each other. They’re married.”
“I did not know that you thought we were writing,” Viktor says to Ron, “otherwise I would have said.” He looks to Hermione and says, almost apologetically, “We did not talk about you.”
He points at Pansy, “She’s making Cho’s wedding dress, and needs help with the sewing or lacemaking or something. Do you want to help her? You can say no, she’s not your master.”
Except right now they’re supposed be on a kind of date and if Harry isn’t going to tell him what’s wrong, then he’d prefer it if his boyfriend was mopey on his own time. He supposes he could just start stripping. That typically gets Harry’s attention firmly on him, although considering they’re in the middle of Madame Pudifoot’s, that might not go so well.
They still have a couple hours until the party, which is about how long he expects it will take them to find an outfit in all this mess.
Mr. Weasley brings them back to the burrow immediately, face nearly grey. No one’s talking, and being surrounded by silent Weasleys is possibly the strangest thing Harry has ever experienced, and he lives a very strange life.
“Okay,” he says, because Draco looks genuinely upset, and that’s the last thing Harry wants. He knocks his foot against Draco’s and says, “It was kind of cool, though, right?”
There’s a shimmer across the glass, and then his favorite Slytherin’s face appears. “Harry,” he grins, “You’re looking less like an abused house elf.” He blinks then says, “Ronald, have you gotten
She tuts at him and twists her wand in a complicated pattern. The dirt and grime falls from his clothes and skin onto the floor, and she banishes that with another swish of her wand. “Much better.”
The wyvern is amazing. He’s biting and clawing at the basilisk, and Harry gains a moment of inspiration and shouts, “
George rolls his eyes, Cassius tucked up against his side and looking far too pleased with himself for Harry’s comfort. “Don’t worry, she’s not even here anymore, the aurors took her away.”
“It’s been a busy three years,” he protests, “And, hey, it wasn’t killing people before Voldemort, and it clearly isn’t killing people now, so it’s all fine. It might not even be alive, we don’t know, it’s probably fine.”
“Harry!” Hermione says, scandalized. Or at least pretending to be scandalized while doing her very best to keep from laughing.
, and no one had gotten in a fight, no one had started anything, he’d kind of expected someone to get too drunk and too rowdy and to ruin it all, but it hadn’t happened.
Nagini spends most of her nights curled up on his bed, and Abigail does too, but he’s pretty sure that’s just because she hates sharing only slightly more than sleeping on his bed. He has to sneak away in the morning to write his letters and give them to Winky, but that’s not so bad. What’s annoying is that Nagini almost always spreads out and moves to the warm spot he left behind, and the first two times he let her take over his bed, but on the third he just shoves her over and climbs back in. She hisses at him, but doesn’t kill him, so he figures he’s fine.
“I should probably go to the tower and help manage the kids and stuff,” he says, and Hermione’s face drops, because she should probably be doing the same, since she’s a prefect too. “You stay here, I’ll take care of it.”
There’s a high pitched scream that has to be Fleur, and he turns, trying to find the source of it so he can try and get to her. But she doesn’t scream again, so he has no other direction to go on instead of in front of him. He hopes she’s okay.
“You’ll be dead before you reach the front door,” he returns. “Wards, remember? It’s the reason Voldemort wants to be here in the first place. Even if the whole Order showed up, they wouldn’t be able to make it through.”
The front and center part of the greenhouse is like a normal park, lush and tamed and beautiful. But the deeper in, the more wild it becomes, but it’s the best kind. It’s wild by design. There isn’t a single leaf or petal in the whole place that Neville hasn’t personally added.
“That’s the thing. They did.” Everyone goes deathly silent, and Draco sighs. “As much as I loathe Potter, we need better practical defense skills if we’re going to survive this war. Quinn approached me and invited the Slytherins. Potter’s in charge, but Quinn and Cedric are helping. I’m the one that decided we wouldn’t be going to tonight’s meeting, because frankly it’s not safe for some of us to be seen as being friendly with Potter and his ilk. Those who join the club are being given strict rules not to mention any Slytherins being involved, no matter what.”
He sneers, and it’s difficult to look condescending when he’s in this much pain. “That’s unnecessary, Professor. If you’ll excuse me.”
Draco is in the stands seated in between Blaise and Pansy, and wondering who the hell thought this would make a good spectator event, since basically they’re just going to wait around for an hour seeing who gets back first. He brought today’s edition of the Daily Prophet to read while he waits. Luna’s article is on the front page, accompanied by a picture of Cedric smiling and waving. She’d written it under the pseudonym Mizuki Tanaka, using a loose translation of her first name in addition to her mother’s maiden name.
“Excellent. Get to it.” She’s gone before he’s even finished speaking. He looks to a confused Fleur. “How’s your disillusionment charm?”
There’s a crack, and then Winky is standing there in very pretty green dress with Draco’s crest stitched into the shoulder. She goes white and screeches, “MASTER DRACO! What is you doing!”
Harry scans the water, but he doesn’t see anything. Whatever happened to Fleur, she’s not here, and he has to leave. “I’m taking the girl with me,” he tells the merman. He has to get Ron out of here, but he’s not leaving anyone behind.
“No, we took it because the professor didn’t care if we slept during class and it was right after lunch,” he says. “But all that planets aligning, magical herb combination crap is all stuff you have to do when you’re building a spell from the bottom up. And it’s useful for herbology. And potions. It’s more of a support subject really, because bits of it get covered in all the classes once you get advanced enough, but it’s useful to have as a base, and most of the reason we still have it as a subject anyway. Divining is more an art than anything else, but the support skills are widely applicable.”
He looks over at Harry, who has a familiar confused look on his face, which means as usual his soulmate knows nothing.
“Prince Akeakamai is over three hundred years old,” Fred says. “Merpeople don’t age like us. The queens are both over a thousand years old.”
The centaurs surrounding them part for Firenze and Hagrid and Harry quickly come up behind him, stopping once they’re walking next to them. He doesn’t know what Hagrid says or does, but the acromantulas retreat back into the forest. Draco tries to keep his head up, but his exhaustion is catching up with him, and really, Firenze did this to himself. He leans forward until his forehead is pressed against Firenze’s shoulder, suddenly finding it too much effort to keep himself upright. There’s a rumble in Firenze’s chest like he’s holding back laughter and he doesn’t dump Draco onto the ground, so he assumes this is fine.
Harry’s powerful, always good at things if only because of his magic levels. But this is where he shines.
He grabs one of the badges and presents it to Blaise, who takes it with careful fingers. “Weasley Is Our King?” he reads aloud.
She makes an aborted gesture, like she wants to roll her eyes, but doesn’t. “You know that’s not what I’m concerned about, Mr. Malfoy.”
“I’m not a necromancer!” he protests, careful to keep his voice down. He remembers the way Quinn looked at him before. “Wait, did you think I was a necromancer even back then?”
“Great!” Bill beams. Draco ends up just silently drinking next to them while they talk, and contributing the occasional dirty observation in French just to make Fleur look scandalized.
“Daphne and I can make an announcement to the Slytherins, so they know to come to me first,” Draco says. “Harry, you too. Just call me on the mirror when you get out of detention, and I’ll come and heal you. Same for you guys, and the twins and Neville and Ginny.”
“I didn’t know you could do that,” Narcissa says. She’s locked her hysteria away, even though her eyes are red from crying.
“Yes,” he says, because he is. This is important, it’s something he can do that the rest can’t. Ron would be a pretty good healer, Draco thinks, but he’d have to put in the time and effort to memorize a thousand little details to do it properly, which Draco doesn’t really see him doing, so it’s up to him.
“They don’t come down here,” Asim admits, “something about too much foul magic in the air. We’ve hired cleaning wizards, but they’ll only come at night. We don’t use magic to clean most of the wing, since it’s always a gamble about how it’ll react with and to our patients.”
“Viktor asked me weeks ago,” Hermione says, “I’m sorry, I should have known neither of you had asked anyone, but I forgot.” Ron almost says something to that, but restrains himself, for which Harry is grateful. That a discussion for another time, hopefully when none of them are there to witness it.
She goes to walk forward, and he grabs her shoulders, preventing her from moving. “Are you crazy? You can’t go like that!”
Draco glances to the entrance of the corridor that someone could walk down any moment and find them. “Probably for the best if you did neither. We need to destroy that diary.
“That’s because I’m overcautious, not because I’m particularly talented at it,” he confesses. “I do dumb stuff with charms all the time, ask Filius, but I’m just a lot more careful when my spells affect more than just myself.”
“Anytime,” she’s beaming when she pulls back. “Although, if you could stop putting yourself in situations where you later collapse, that would be nice too.”
She sighs before patting Hagrid on the head. She winks at Harry before fading away, to wherever she goes when she’s not haunting the bathroom.
“Maybe, just this once, you could have a quiet year and you and your friends can not cause any disasters or get in the middle of trouble that doesn’t concern you?” she suggests, but she already seems resigned.
“He’s of the opinion that he’s already dead, so what’s the worst that could happen?” Quinn shrugs. “I’m not going to fight him on it. I asked the Grey Lady, and she laughed in my face.”
“I’m very popular,” Draco informs them, and everyone rolls their eyes at once. “I let them hang around me in public, I have the appearance of two intimidating bodyguards, and they get to report back to their fathers that they’re following instructions. Everyone wins.”
"How do you feel?" Harry asked, almost a hoarse whisper, as if trying not to hurt him with his voice, or perhaps himself by speaking too loud.
It doesn't matter because Potter is here, and he's kissing him, and he's drawing him up in his arms on the bed, and then they're kissing again, and it's heady and brilliant and painfully good, everything loud and bright and clear. He feels more awake than he ever has, in that moment. Him, laughing thickly, a tremulous sound into Potter's mouth. Potter grinning back at him, temple and nose against his.
"No," Harry says. "No, I get it now. Why you did." He pauses, fingers tapping at his knee. "I was angry at first, yeah. But then I… I got it. I mean, I don't think I can even imagine — maybe the closest I can ever get is, you know..." Harry looks up at him, swallowing, "The letters. But even then, I'll never live through them, will I—"
Harry turned his head back, stared at him, trying to read him. It felt surreal and dreamy, not unlike one of those dreams that left him ashamed and embarrassed upon waking, hard and wet, because they were about the one person he shouldn't have been having them about.
"I used to spit in my cousin's late night snacks," Harry said, instead, just the closest thing at random his mind could grasp. "Because he would wake me up at like, two, for a sandwich."
"They don't need to know yet," Draco said. "They'd do me much better treating me the same as they always had."
But he isn't at all ready for the violent and dizzying riot of his tender feelings, the cramp low in his gut that lingers its ache long after, at the simple sight of him.
Draco doesn't know what to say, or what to feel. He doesn't feel the seizing within himself, hardening into a grudge. Hermione seems anxious about it, warming her hands on her mug as she glances down at the top of it.
There came a lapse in silence that came after Draco's response, and Draco was looking at him, their faces a feet apart. There must have been something on Harry's, because he then croaked, "What?"
Harry wanted a time turner and stop it all here, or go back to when nothing was like this and he didn't have this fear gnawing at him all the time, when Draco's core was still whole and safe.
Draco was laughing at the viewer, soundless, his chest and shoulders moving with it. "It's on video, if you really should know. So I didn't just
Harry swallowed. He felt strangely guilty, in hindsight, for not being that person, because Draco was the one that went through all the trouble for it.
He'd climbed out of the sheets, his steps quick as he strode out the open door, and then he could hear the pained sounds, and then he was running.
"Draco, hey," Harry said, had made his way over to him. He was reaching for him, hand hovering over his arm. They'd done the necessitated contact only about an hour ago, before he went to see Narcissa, but Harry no longer expected anything predictable.  "Is it—"
He gets accepted into St. Mungos' training institution in September. Hermione gets into the cursebreaking department not long after, Ron still working at the joke shop with George. He lives at Grimmauld Palace, spends months renovating and making Sirius' home into a home for himself with Luna and Neville's help. He goes for his training, comes home late in the evening, the rest of the day passing in further studies for tests. It's rigorous, as difficult as Draco always hounded on him for.
"I'll wait, Mr. Potter," Narcissa said, her hands folded gracefully at her front. "And there is in fact something I'd like to speak with you about."
"I just wish," Potter says, softly. "I don't want you to keep living in those dreams, you know… they weren't real. They weren't… they were just dreams."
He wonders how she'll react, hearing of his preferences. It's not as if she can break her magically binding oath, if he did tell her. He cocks his head, an apathetic sort of curiosity overtaking him. "Yes he is."
He was standing there by the door, all velvet robes and wavy hair twisted up into a low plaited bun at the back of his neck, white-blond swirls falling over his temples. Two lines of braids crowned his head, the cross of each one dotted with a miniscule, beaded glow, like fairy lights all throughout. He was smiling as he was conversing with somebody, all crescent-moons in his cheeks, a crinkle in his eyes.
Everything was so very slow and calm from up here. All these rivers of life and people, flowing from place to place, unaware of the pairs of eyes on them all.
"Oh there is another way," Ezekiel said, a satirical cheer to his tone. "Though I'm sure not everybody would be on board with this. Shall I
Draco was staring down at the bar, his chest heaving, as if trying to collect himself, pondering on something intensely. Harry thought he would ignore him, once more, but he shook his head after a while, still frowning.
He's taking Harry's face in his hands, all cresent-moon dimples bracketing his smile, kissing him harder. "Took you only forever," Draco murmurs. He's looking at him that way again, that way that's always a bit overwhelming for his heart. He looks at Harry like he is all he can see right now, and nobody has ever looked at Harry with love like that, so blatant and sweet.
Harry swallowed. They'd been planning for this since First Year. There wasn't anything better he could have imagined for his future, once. Then he hadn't thought he'd have a future, and now he did. Now he had all this life, all this freedom to do with it what he willed, all this time that stretched endless ahead of him, with no aim or plan. It was terrifying.
"She told me I need to stop making her problems and feelings my responsibility," he's saying. He's brought Molly's muffins as a treat, ate them with him on Harry's bed. "She...well, you know she's always hated how overprotective I got about her. She thinks it's because I think she can't take care of herself. It's not like that though, it's just... she's my little sister, you know? I can't stand her getting hurt. But I'm… good with not having to... I don't want to choose between my sister and my best friend. So...sort it out, you two."
"But you don't like her very much, do you?" Luna says, her eyebrow raising. "I've noticed you always leave whenever she joins us."
Ron twists a corner of his lips. "I don't know. I mean, you're always looking at him, like in Sixth Year, except it can't be because you think he's up to something. He's hardly even
in this damned fucking world that makes me feel a damned fucking thing anymore except you! What am I supposed to do?"
Hermione rolled his eyes. "You're overreacting. I doubt Malfoy has any wicked intentions. He hasn't been the Malfoy we know since seventh year."
"Well," Hermione says, smiling as she locks an arm with him, and they all begin walking down the corridor again. "As long as you always remember who your
Another memory treads through his mind, one clarity amidst foggy faces and the white walls of a hospital, faded. Everything that happened around the memories he's had cut out of his mind—they've all gone faded.
"Nothing. I just—" He clears his throat. "I can do it myself. Even if it's not—I mean, it's not like anyone cares."
There was silence, and then, "Excessive magic operating in a single body can be lethal, Mr. Potter. Yes." Xavier shrugged. It was strange, infuriating, that he seemed so desensitized to it all, like something he'd already seen countless times, but to Harry, it all crumbled upon him with the weight of a mountain. "So it would be favourable to keep it stabilised as much as possible."
" Draco jerked his hand out of his grip. "I am the bloody host. I can't just up and leave! What would people think?"
He raises an eyebrow, staring ahead. He vaguely notices his own speeding pace as he walks down the corridors towards the Hogwarts Library. "So? Smith was being a right bastard to him."
It meant something entirely different, hearing it from Malfoy, that he deserved to live even after how much he had failed, after how many people had died in a war that was between
But Harry was anyway, before he even realised that was what was happening, before he could even try to stop his face from twisting ugly. His chest was jouncing in dry heaves, and the tears finally fell out of his control, and Draco was curling a hand gently into the back of his hair, an arm folded above himself, leaning his head down to press his lips against Harry's, dry and chaste.
But Potter has shown him all his scars, has told the story behind each one, has been vulnerable with him more than once, and maybe it should be easier to talk about his own now.
Draco leans down and kisses him, the sound of a sharp inhale from Harry, like he's been holding his breath in anticipation. By the next second he's dragging a hand up Draco's hair, pulling him deeper into the kiss.
The thing about his dreams was that nobody was ever sad. Nothing ever hurt. Nobody ever had to hurt unless it was because of something as certain as loss.
"Sorry, I'm..." His voice is too raspy. He clears his throat, and begins to stand to his feet. "I think I may be coming down with... Excuse me."
"Well. I think you were alright where you were." Draco leans back on the booth, resting a wrist on the tabletop. "Nobody wants to be second to some nonexistent version of themselves. I know I wouldn't. And... " Quieter, "And I wasn't in a place to be good for you back then either."
Draco only then becomes aware of the tug at his own cheek, there of its own accord, unbeknownst to himself.
The smell of smoke and wood was high in the air. In the warmth of inebriation, and the way everything looked as bright as it did hazy, Harry found himself transfixed by the firelights casting itself over Draco where he stood. It was strangely serene and lovely, with the body of the violin tucked under his chin — arm relaxed high, his bow poised over the string, and the way he moved it slow, tender to the point of melancholy.
They continue a silent walk down the street. The plan was to stop at the sweets shop, first, and then the pub.
GallaPlacidia: for your amazingly quick betateading, for refining/cleaning up this story, for all your advice/suggestions and for helping me fill in some missing gaps. It was so great to have you on this, and just very very lovely in general getting to talk to you
Then Draco was back to curling his arms around his neck, the back of his head, cheek against his. Harry pushed a kiss on his shoulder, nestled him closer into his own with a gentle hand at the back of his hair.
"Aco," Teddy said, pulling saliva-soaked fingers out of his mouth, pointing at Draco. Then he rigidly arched his back, insisting to be released, and so Harry did. He set him down on his feet gently between his knees, balancing him with a lingering, loose grip under his arms.
It was great only until Elias' hands slipped up under his shirt, splayed over his ribs and palmed into the arch of his body, and then something at the deepest core of Harry
Now they show up on mornings at each other's door. Sometimes Ron's long gone out to the Great Hall with Hermione, and other times, he's there, stiffly pretending Draco isn't there and vice versa. Draco waits for Harry to get ready, berating him for his tardiness as he leans on his doorway with his arms crossed, watching Harry bustle around, clumsily tie his tie, grab his robes, put his socks and shoes on. On the days Harry isn't late, they walk together to the kitchens, carry their meals to the grounds of Hogwarts, to the ramparts of the castle, to hidden alcoves. On the days when Harry is late, Draco brings him breakfast instead, and he scarfs it all down on the way to class.
She doesn’t seem angry. Instead, she almost looks amused. “I would be a very foolish woman if I thought only my Gryffindors could be brave. And a blind one on top of that. Mr. Malfoy, for your quick thinking, impressive spellwork, and
“Oh yeah, the person who put me under an unforgivable curse took the time to explain why she wanted me to do that in really precise and illuminating detail,” Katie says.
“Her wife got sick, and they have a baby at home,” Draco’s actually more impressed the baby isn’t sick constantly, what with both his mothers being healers and bringing who knows what home every day, “so I covered her shift. Now why are you screaming at,” he cranes his head back to look at the wall, “five in the morning?”
“Actually,” he says cautiously, “I was wondering if I could speak to my friend Quinn. I wouldn’t ask, but it’s important.”
By the time Harry finishes speaking, Fudge is nearly frothing at the mouth. Shackbolt ends up escorting him out after quietly assuring Fleur that they wouldn’t be pressing charges, considering the circumstances. Mr. Diggory had opened his mouth a few times during Harry’s story, his eyebrows drawn together, but Cedric had elbowed his father in the side each time he’d looked like he was ready to interrupt.
The cooling sensation of healing magic washes over his hand, and the sharp ache fades completely. The skin on the back of his hand is completely healed, no hint of the words that had been cut into his flesh
He holds his breath, waiting. They’re separated the others, the animated corpses forcing everyone else away. Lucius had been the only one who was able to get through.
“We haven’t even gotten in the ocean yet,” Draco laughs, stepping into the wet sand and tugging Harry along with him.
“Dragons?” Harry says, playing dumb for a second just to see the split second of panic on Hagrid’s face on spilling yet another secret. “Just kidding! That’s why I’m here actually. Hypothetically speaking, if someone had to get past a giant fire breathing lizard, how would they go about doing that?”
Pansy rolls her eyes, shoves her wand into her hair, and sprints for the groaning tree like structure thing. “You just blew your cover, you know,” Blaise points out to Filius.
They’re really going to have to figure something out, because they’re graduating in two years, and then Theophania is going to be alone again. Maybe basilisk wellness is something he can add to the Slytherin prefect duties? He’s pretty sure Snape doesn’t care enough to stop him.
This section of the maze is crawling with carnivorous veins. Fleur is held against the hedge, the vines sliding across her and leaving sluggishly bleedings wounds in their wake as they slowly eat through her clothes and skin. “FLEUR!” he shouts. He tries to get to her, but whenever he steps too close, vines reach out for him, trying to capture him too. “Fleur, wake up!” She doesn’t stir. He curses and flings out, “Aguamenti!”
There has to be. Ollivander’s is never empty, even if it’s never really full. People wanting new or extra wands, wanting repairs or polishes, or who just want to stop by to greet the old man who sold them their very first wand. There’s always people.
He’s still hungry from this morning’s interrupted breakfast, and he hates adoring crowds. “Lunch, please.”
“You’re a fucking mess, pull yourself together,” Draco says, but he’s smiling. Harry’s eye crinkle at the corners, and he takes a step closer, almost without really thinking about it.
“This is really not the easy part. Who told you that? Getting it all to fit together – that’s the hardest part of alchemy, are you joking,” Draco demands.
“Well, it’s not like he could tell us,” Nanaia says dryly. “But yes, I do. He took it after the first incident with the centaurs.”
“You didn’t kill it?” Hermione screeches, because she’s smart enough to know what he’s saying without needing him to actually say it.
Harry blinks. He doesn’t think he’s ever seen Arthur and Molly have an actual argument. “About what?”
Nanaia is still staring straight ahead, not really acknowledging them, and she stays that way as Harry quickly fills them in on the events of last night. “Uh, do you think-”
They haven’t said anything of importance in their letters since the Chamber, well aware that their family is under scrutiny because of the incident. His father doesn’t look at him as they walk off the platform to their carriage, and a low pit of dread grows in his stomach. Is he really that mad at him that he won’t even look at him?
Ron laughs out loud at that, but is cut off as his brother sits next to him. “Hey George,” he greets, then stops, and turns to fully face his brother. “Fred, what are you doing?”
“Be sure you don’t get caught,” his father adds, “but let us know if you do and we’ll get you out of it.”
People keep threatening him with locking him up or throwing him out like there isn’t a whole world out there for him to explore. He likes it here. But it’s not like Britain is all there is. Besides, his friends have followed him into near certain death more than once, he’s pretty sure they’ll follow him to like, Italy. He’s also pretty certain Blaise will let him hang out in his house in Rome.
“Of course you are,” Quinn says. “I said he’s a good instructor, and I stick by that, but being a good teacher, especially to impressionable young students, is a lot more holistic than how much knowledge you can cram into their heads. Severus
Hermione throws her prefect badge at his face. He catches it, and she scowls, but what was she expecting? He is a seeker. “I don’t have time for this! Keeping up with my studies and our midnight meetings is hard enough, I don’t have time for prefect duties on top of it!”
“Wait,” Hermione says, eyes narrowed. “Not that - Pansy, I have no problem with you coming. But if we’re using the polyjuice on ourselves, why can’t we use it on someone who can really help us? Like an adult?”
That doesn’t make any sense to Harry, but Pansy’s spine straightens. “Is that how you solved the directional problem?”
Harry plucks the gillyweed out of Blaise’s hands. “Look, I’m taking it, since if I try and get in the great lake without it, I’ll probably end up drowning. Being a fish for an hour is better than death.”
“That’s okay,” his godfather says, “You can just drop out of school and become a professional quidditch player.”
The door opens, and the twins and Ginny tumble the room, although they all freeze when they’re a couple of steps in. “Um?”
“Come here,” he says, and Draco does. As soon as he steps on the blanket he realizes that there’s both a warming and cushioning charm on it, the chill of autumn air disappearing. He sits next to Harry, who automatically pulls him in for a kiss. It goes on long enough and becomes deep enough that Draco’s mostly stopped worrying about it when Harry pulls back with clear reluctance and murmurs, “Hermione said these were the books you needed,” then kisses the corner of his mouth, hesitates, then presses his lips against the ridge of his cheekbones, like he can’t help himself. “I got your preliminary outline from Blaise. Sorry, I had him snoop through your things.”
Ze goes still when ze looks at the cover. Harry’s just starting to get concerned when ze asks, “Where did you get this?”
Madame Pomfrey puts her hand on her hips. “This is foolish, and will certainly end in someone being injured, if not dead. I’ve invested far too much time in you just to let you die.”
Fred is clearly considering if he should continue lying, but he just sighs. Harry wouldn’t have noticed if he wasn’t looking for it, but his demeanor shifts the tiniest bit, becoming more controlled, tighter. He hadn’t even realized that he’d notices the twins held themselves differently until now. “He needs an alibi. Please don’t blow it. Since when can you tell us apart, anyway?”
“Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy,” she greets, turning from petting Fawkes’s to face them. She looks at their joined hands, blinks, and asks, “Who won the pool?”
“Lovely,” Percy says, then ruffles Harry, Ron, and Ginny’s hair as he leaves, and he kind of just ends up patting Hermione on the top of her head since she doesn’t have the kind of hair that lends itself to ruffling, and then he’s gone.
“It is the holidays,” he feels the need to point out. “I’m putting on the pants myself, you can help with the rest.” If she sees he has a soulmark, the news will be all over the school within the hour.
As far as Harry’s concerned, it’s a perfect way to spend the last day before break. Well, as perfect as it can be when it doesn’t include his boyfriend and a convenient broom closet.
“Everyone who grows up in ancestral homes are taught them,” Pansy says, “You never know what your ancestors left lying around. You don’t want to put on your great aunt’s purple scarf only to discover it had an anti-theft hex on it
“Parseltongue,” Malfoy repeats. When Harry just keeps blinking at him, he says, “Snakes. You speak the language of snakes. Are you trying to lie to me right now? I
McGonagall frowns, and what the heck, he doesn’t deserve a frown, this is not a frown type of plan, it’s a great idea. “Mr. Potter,” she starts, then stops. He waits, and she continues, “You know, you don’t need to continuously use yourself as a shield for all those around you. We can take care of ourselves. Even if we can’t, it’s not your job to protect everyone. It’s okay to just – let things fall where they may.”
Harry’s expecting Snape to snatch his hand away, or yell at him, or something. But instead he just stares at him, looking into his eyes. He says softly, “Expecto patronum.”
He really misses being a kid when he could just blindly hate people without feeling obligated to take nuance into account.
Ze shrugs. “If I did it in there, then Severus would get bored, or lost in his own head, and then he’d be even more of a bitch than he is now. Besides, the first time I made the castle shake, he came running out of his rooms with shampoo in his hair and only wearing a towel around his waist, so, there’s that.”
,” he says, and Remus repeats himself. Something about it being big. Big, house, flying. The house is big so he can fly in it? No, that doesn’t make any sense. The attic is a greenhouse, and Sirius was talking about him flying in there, so it’s the attic that’s big. The attic is big, and it’s in the house. That’s stupid, Remus wouldn’t say that, he knows that Harry knows that the attic is in the house. The attic is big
At that moment, two Death Eaters burst into the room behind them, and five seconds later Voldemort is there. He’s wearing a robe now. How did he summon a robe, Draco wonders as they seemingly pick a door a random and go running, Voldemort and a couple Death Eaters on their trail. Did he take it off one of the unconscious Death Eaters? But no, it looks like it fits him, and his proportions are too long and skinny for anyone that’s here, or anyone that isn’t a praying mantis.
, and it’s not like he can trust his parents to tell him if they need something, they’re too worried about protecting him. He could send Winky back during the school year to check on the stores and bring more if there’s a need, or even ask one of the family elves to do it. As long as his parents don’t order the elves not to do it, there’s no reason they can’t. Which they might if they know about it, but there’s no reason to tell them either, and the family elves can be sneaky if they want to be.
Ron shrugs again, not saying anything else. Harry doesn’t know anything about alchemy, but he knows that what Ron’s done is impressive. “You really don’t want to take the class for real?”
Hermione’s eyes are filled with tears, and he really hadn’t planned for this, for Snape not to let her leave. Lavender Brown gets to her feet and snags Hermione’s elbow, “Come on, I’ll take you to Madame Pomfrey.”
“You can’t all come with me,” Harry says. “This is ridiculous. We need to be at least a little stealthy.”
“Uh huh,” she says dryly. “Hurry up now, I’m interested to see how this will blow up in your faces.”
When will people just accept the fact that he never has any idea what’s going on? “Okay. Is that … important?”
Harry feels a jolt of grief. He hadn’t known him very well, but he’d been nice to him, and he’d been a Mother, just like him.
After a couple of stubborn moments, Harry turns back to him, looking a little green. “I don’t understand.”
“When we agreed to this game, we knew the risks with which it came,” he says, although his face is pained. “Between us there is no score. Tell your people that we do not bring war.”
“Expecto patronum!” he casts, thinking of the sweet rush of relief and bone deep terror when Harry came for him and Ginny in the Chamber of Secrets. His peacock patronus bursts from his wand, and then just as quickly dissipates, dissolving into a mist which is pulled toward the obsidian sphere in Asim’s hand, where it’s absorbed and contained. Asim’s shoulders immediately drop, and he yawns, completely relaxed when a moment before he’d been the exact opposite. He frowns and then shakes his head, as if shaking off the steady, comforting presence coming from the sphere. “Is this – did you just–”
“My dad’s just going to side-long apparate with me on the day of the game. I’ve been doing it since I was a kid, even though it used to drive Mum crazy. We’ve never splinched though, so you’d think she’d have calmed down a little. She hasn’t.”
“Your cousin Montgomery Longbottom? The Legilimens that the department of justice keeps on retainer for approved cases?” Draco asks. Even Pansy and Blaise look impressed.
“Lav,” Ron groans. He grips her waist in his large hands and lifts her up enough that he can resettle her in his lap in a pose that isn’t quite so scandalizing.
The fact that he didn’t solicit the kiss is implied. Draco may get annoyed and huffy about it, but he’s hardly going to get annoyed and huffy at
“We don’t really get a choice in the matter, as I understand it,” Lee says. “Up and on your feet, Grandpa.”
Pansy’s arm settles across his shoulders, and she leans over to whisper in his ear, “Breathe, darling, before you catch some unwanted attention.”
“More or less,” he answers, and barrels forward when her eyes narrow. “I just healed a bunch of people, can I have a pepper up potion? Or an espresso, or something. I’m looking for Harry.”
Gabrielle is sitting on her sister’s bed, swimming in a longsleeve shirt that has to be Fleur’s. She smiles and waves at him.
Harry books it before he’s forced to hear Lavender say something about Ron that he can’t unknow. There’s some time before class and he hasn’t visited Dobby in a while, so now seems like an excellent time to do that.
“You know, I think you might have a saving people thing,” says a voice that will haunt him in his nightmares.
He holds up his hands, grinning, “Hey, I speak another language, you’re the only slacker here.” His Parseltongue abilities aren’t exactly a secret, but they aren’t common knowledge either, and he’d like to keep it that way.
“Er, right,” he says, scanning the crowd for his boyfriend. Hopefully Draco will think to come grab him, but also possibly he thinks that Harry’s already inside and won’t bother.
Winky turns on them, hands on her hips. “Why is Kreacher not having access? How can you be expecting him to do the cooking if he can’t buy food? How can he do your shopping or be replacing the broken things? No wonder the cleaning is taking so long! Not everything can be being fixed, some must be replaced.”
“I’m going to need to conserve my magic for something else,” she says before winking at him. Normally that would make him feel better, but not right now. This is insane.
“Expelliarmus!” he shouts, pointing his wand at Lupin’s back. The professor’s wand goes flying over Draco’s head into the hall, and he shuts the door after it. “What do you think you’re doing?”
Hermione gets a letter from Pansy the next day. She spends most of it filleting Rita Skeeter and her horrible reporting, but sandwiched in the middle of that and complaining about their book lists, she says that the mirror broke but he’s fine. She doesn’t specify who he is, out of fear of their mail being read, but she’s talking about Draco, and they’re all relieved. Ron had been trying to keep Hermione and Harry calm about the whole thing, but the longer Draco went without responding to the mirror, the more worried he’d begun to look.
They let that hang in the air for a moment before Hermione says, “Well, him being a little bit less of bastard is nice change of pace, but doesn’t erase the last five years, so, whatever. We’re not giving him a gold star for being a little bit less awful than normal.”
Harry waits, but neither Draco nor Hermione move to explain. So he grins and says, “When we were stuck in the Chamber of Secrets, Draco summoned a wyvern to help me. He’s going to summon it again.”
They found out they were soulmates over a year ago. But this is the first time they’re exchanging presents, having skipped each other’s birthdays since there was no way for them to send each other anything in the summer.
Harry is sitting cross legged on the edge of Sirius and Remus’s bed. He tilts his head to the side. “Why? The Prophet’s been calling me a crazy liar for saying that Voldemort is back for weeks. They didn’t care about that.” All the articles about him probably would have been more upsetting if he wasn’t constantly surrounded by people who believed him.
Draco explains, first slowly, then all at once, words tumbling over each other, like he’s worried if he pauses for breath then that will give Harry an opportunity to yell at him. He tells him about Voldemort looking for a place to stay with his supporters, about how it was only a matter of time before he ended up at the manor, so Draco convinced his dad to cut out the middle man, about how the rest of their Slytherin friends are spending the summer safely in Venice, but he’s staying right at home, right in the middle of danger. He finishes, trailing off even as he’s clearly searching for more words, something he can say to justify what he’s doing.
, and what if she hadn’t saved you like I thought she would, what if I was wrong and I watched you both die in front of me–”
! I want this to be easy but every option, every opinion I could possibly have on him sucks, it just contradicts something else and I hate that,” he finishes, then adds quietly, “It was easier when he was just awful all the time.”
If he’s here, just like Voldemort is, he doesn’t see why he shouldn’t be able to control her too.  Or at least do something, he shouldn’t have to just sit here and
“YOU’RE A PARSELMOUTH!” he shouts, despairing not for the first time that his soulmate is this much of moron. “SPEAK TO THE BLOODY SNAKE!”
He sighs, giving in to the inevitable and rolling out of bed and onto his feet. They should have just spent the night in the chamber of secrets where no one would have bothered them. Well, the snakes would have, but at least Ginny probably wouldn’t have been able to interrupt their sleep. Something really interesting better be happening at that Weasley family meeting.
He shrugs. “Where else? Hagrid. And they are. But I’m not exactly looking to test that friendliness when they show up to us standing next to one of their dead.”
Cedric is big eyed and grinning so wide it looks like it hurts. His gaze keeps going over her, like he can’t figure out where to look next, if he should be focusing on her train or her hair, but of course he ends up looking into her face, fingers twitching, like he wants to touch her and knows that he’s not supposed to.
Ginny looks like she agrees with Millie. Luna holds up her hands and makes a wishy washy motion. “Because of the goblet, you have to enter the maze. Do you have to fight? Can’t you just stay out of everything’s way until one of the other champions gets the trophy?”
Draco is hauled backwards by his soulmate, and he’s confused until there’s an absolutely blinding explosion of light, which leaves them all dazed for several long seconds. When he blinks away the spots from his vision, he sees all the shelves of prophecies are back exactly where they were before, as if nothing ever happened, although of course the damage to the walls and ceiling is still there.
“Would working in a hospital make you happy?” she asks, “Going in every day and healing an array of illnesses and wounds?”
Harry rolls his eyes, and concentrates on the snake, tries to imagine it moving, thinks of the shifting scales and flickering tongue of Abigail as she wrapped herself around Draco’s arm. “
Blaise is stronger and faster than he is, but that’s what magic is for. He can’t get hit if he doesn’t get caught.
He does, he looks more like a proper pureblood than a living skeleton, trimmed hair and his eyes no longer sunken deep into his face. That’s probably due to the man who’s head that appears next to him – that of Remus Lupin.  “Harry,” their former professor says warmly, then he looks over and up. “Draco, fancy seeing you here. How unexpected and shocking.”
Theophania glides out, scales shimmering in the light of chamber, and every time he sees her he’s surprised by her size. Her fangs are thin in comparison to the rest of her, but they’re still the length of his arm.
“He was born of a river,” Mip says, “Always changing, always rushing. The older elves of his area tried to leave it to him, to give him a chance, but – it got diverted, as rivers sometimes do these days, and the forest it was a part of doesn’t exist any longer. It’s no wonder Dobby’s a bit strange.”
“How nice of you to learn Tamil for your friend,” she says, still friendly, but she’s totally misunderstood what Ron said. Again, Harry means to correct her, but he doesn’t get the chance. She continues talking, but it’s not in English, instead speaking to him in rapid fire Tamil that he can’t even hope to follow.
“Voldemort said if I lived, they wouldn’t. I don’t know how serious he was, I don’t think he’d kill the only supporters he has left as soon as he’d gotten them back, but – that’s what he said,” Harry finishes. His knees buckle, and he falls into Draco. He’s pretty sure it was faked when Harry uses that closeness to whisper into his ear, “He could have killed me, he had a chance, but he didn’t.”
That’s alarming enough that it almost jolts him back to lucidity. “Don’t – don’t do that. You’ll put too much power behind – behind it, and I’ll explode. Very messy.”
Pansy and Millie turn to Draco and he raises his hands in front of him. “Look. Obviously Umbridge exerting power and influence over the school is bad. However. Getting rid of Trelawney wouldn’t be the worst thing. Dad’s been trying to do that for about a decade.”
There’s Draco, of course, who fire calls him every night and updates him on the political machinations of his parents while they sit in the background. And as much fun as lazing about with his boyfriend sounds, Draco’s just as bad as doing nothing as he is, so it could only end in disaster.
,” she says, the viciousness in her voice promising that if he did, it would be the last thing he’d ever do.
Harry and Ron throw themselves to the floor so they’re eye level with Percy. Hermione sticks a quill in the book to mark her place before setting it aside and joining them in a slightly less dramatic fashion. “What’s so important you couldn’t just send a letter?”
Draco turns to Harry, “We need to get Cedric on board, obviously. Can you do that? You know him the best out of all of us.” Cho had offered to help Draco with the disillusionment charm, and he liked her well enough, but he wasn’t nearly close enough to her to ask for a favor.
There’s the soft sound of footsteps behind him. “Finally!” he exclaims, turning. “What took you so long?”
“Oh,” he shifts his weight from one foot to the other. Is this how Ron feels whenever he offers to buy him something? “Are you sure? I don’t mind paying.”
Every time he sees Millie, she has a drink in her hand. Usually he wouldn’t be concerned about that, but usually she doesn’t drink quite this much. Blaise seems to be hovering around her though, and he’s never sees her so much as stumble in the heels, so he assumes she’s fine. Either she’s drinking a lot less than it looks or she’s gotten significantly better at holding her liquor since the last time they all got drunk together.
“Just go,” she says, looking away, the harness of her mouth softening, but it just makes her look sad.
He nods, pointing his wand to the edge of the basin. “Mortuus est ille lingua.” Dead man’s tongue. The letters don’t move or change in anyway, except now he can read them.
Ron spreads out his arms, beaming. “The good news is I know what the first task is! The bad news is it’s dragons. You’re going to have to get past dragons. The other good news is that my brother Charlie is here. He says hi, and that he hopes you don’t die.”
“I got it from my mother,” he says honestly. “It’s not for anything bad. I think. Probably? We just need a little background information.”
” he says, and doesn’t realize he’s not speaking English until Abigail’s unwinds herself enough to look at him.
He shakes her hand, as if that one act can make this very unofficial meeting seems slightly more official. “You got it.”
He likes Hagrid’s hut. It feels like the Weasley’s, almost, someplace safe and warm where he always feels welcome. “Dragons?” he prompts.
He’s says it half as a joke, but Neville throws a couple galleons on an attempted but unsuccessful murder, which makes everyone else reach for their pocket change. Ginny writes everything down and collects their money.
He finds him at the kitchen table after a shower and kisses him every morning and drops in front of him a note of his own. His drawings are uglier and messier, never quite as neat and shaded as Draco’s are, but Draco always half-smiles at it all the same, a mug of coffee in hand, straightening it out over the table to look at it.
She didn't finish it, but Harry understood. What he did not understand was whether Draco had made a mistake, or that he lied, and if he did lie, the reason for it. But Harry already knew that he would let Draco keep his secrets, if that was what it was. Harry had many of his own.
"I… my husband, I had to…" Harry was saying, trying to explain in a habit long forgotten and left behind, rising back to the surface. He was six and eight and ten again, after his magic had gone off in an explosion of his emotions, trying to explain to his aunt and uncle, apologising over and over. He realised then what he'd said, thought of Vernon's long-winded rants about
Later that day, Draco asked him what he was doing, sounding only a little too casual as he clinked and clunked through the bar. Harry turned the canvas around with a lift, towards him, saying, "You can take a look."
Malfoy's gaze tore away from the sky, turning to meet Harry's. His cheek was inches away from pressing into the grass, his face inches away from Harry's. "The only way to let something stay perfect..." His eyes were haunted and fatigue-bruised and raw, staring into his own. "is to let go before it can be ruined."
Then Draco was beginning to take control, gaining in speed and ferocity, closing into kisses on Harry's upper lip, his lower lip, the corners, dipping his head to follow the rhythmic movement of their mouths, and Harry, taking every one of them with the force of his own desperation and need, his love and grief. His heart was tightening itself into a thousand, aching knots, all of it like a tender and raw burning in his throat.
Potter spins him under his arm, gently pulls him back into the circle of their dance, the two of them smiling, just two silhouettes in the dark. Somewhere underneath it all, Draco dreams, reliving, a hand closing over his in the daylight of a kitchen, a hand warm and gentle at the middle of his back, just like this, the two of them drawing him into the slow spin of a dance, just like this, and the sound of a wireless singing on, under the echo of laughter.
"You look like shite," Harry pointed out, then, just to say something that would cut through the quiet. Malfoy was pale, even paler than normal, and it stood out starkly against the dark shadows around his eyes.
"Something went wrong, Mr. Potter," was what Xavier bluntly told him in the office, hands steepled together on the desk. "Not with you, but with the other boy."
Soon after sharing a goodnight with Ron, the room is filled with his steady and loud breathing, which Harry has gotten rather used to after sharing a room at the Burrows and a dorm at Hogwarts with him for years. It's almost comforting now, the familiarity of it, the way it grounds him into the present.
, Harry thinks, a gentle thought, watching them all interact with Draco. Molly and Arthur and Ron and Hermione and Charlie and Neville, Luna beside him, with that small and hazy smile of hers as she listens to Draco speak. It's so nice, to have people he can take Draco to, show him off to. People who would like to get to know his boyfriend.
He looks at the baby in his arms, his heart swelling into a bruise, a melancholic sort of fondness. He looks at him and he thinks of Remus and Tonks, everything they'll never get to see or know about Teddy. They'll never get to see or know how wonderful he is.
"Yeah." Harry shifted in his seat. He shrugged, glancing down at his hands on the table. His cup of tea. "Well. Now we know each other's favourite colour."
Draco hums, feigning contemplation. "Perhaps that depends on whether my partner isn't a clumsy oaf."
Just then, the waitress came in, asking if they were ready to order. In his haste of searching for the cheapest thing he could find, Harry ended up ordering something that he promptly decided might have been the last thing he would ever want to put it in his mouth by the sound of it. Malfoy's orders, while few, were shamelessly expensive, and Harry facepalmed so hard he could have broken his own glasses.
"I taught myself ten different protective spells that year, did you know," Draco said, after a while, a derisive sort of smirk, after he got the bottle back, took a good pull. He had drawn it away from his mouth, voice still rough around the burn of alcohol. "I would put all of them on our door every night. Every single one of them. And then I'd remove them too, every morning. It would be such a hassle, Salazar. Only I was too bloody terrified to let myself not bother with it."
Harry does so, pulling him by the hand, leading him to his room. In the doorway, they start kissing again, dizzy with euphoria and helplessly laughing and kissing their way to the bed, land together on it like an afterthought. Draco presses him down into the mattress, with his hands in his hair, on his face, Harry's arm around his waist wrapping him close, then even closer with the other. They roll over into the sheets, still kissing, Harry breaking away to press heavy kisses down his jaw, his neck, a scar on his shoulder, presses his apologies to the ones he gave him. Then lingering, almost reverently, to the centre of his chest.
On Sunday, he spent dinner with the Weasleys and went home with Ron and Hermione, now that he could. They graciously do not ask about this new development, and the three of them spend hours awake talking about nothing, and then he stayed the rest of the night on their couch, just because he could, and they didn't mind.
One day, in one of the owls, Draco sends him a Galleon, with a note telling him to call when he gets it. These, he made himself,
"Yes but it makes you feel better! Isn't that so wonderful?" Draco is looking at her keenly, hopeful. She only nods politely.
"Teddy!" Ron rounds the couch with noisy footsteps, pretending to search for him as he throws Teddy glances every few seconds with a smile. "Where'd you go, Teddy? I can't find you!"
"That's the word for it. What you just described. It's called Hiraeth in Welsh. A feeling of longing and nostalgia for something that never was."
But he didn't have a phone or anything. He just had his wand. Olivia directed him into the kitchen for privacy, and Harry went.
Draco raised his hand, an elbow resting heavily against Harry's collarbone. "You have a crook in your nose."
For a while after Harry's outburst the night of his birthday, Draco had remained amicable with him, just as he'd been the morning after. But he'd always drawn away from him when it came to sex, always refused and said he wasn't in the mood. Harry stopped asking by the third time, because by then he had seen the look on his face, and realised that he wasn't quite over the way Harry had lashed out at him, so out of nowhere, when they'd become friends.
He was still numb and off-kilter, his heart strangely heavy and low in his chest, and it was only when Draco's smile faded into a faint furrow between his brows that Harry realised he must not look very good. Draco was sitting up, with a push onto his elbow, sliding off the couch to his feet. He was standing as he was pulling the book off himself and placing it aside on the table, moving over to him as he was asking, "Harry?"
Harry looks at him. Draco's face is careful to be matter-of-factly, open to whatever he will say. But even so, Harry can see that fear hidden away, because he knows him, and of course he is terrified in the same way Harry has been himself, all these years.
"Yeah. Okay," Ron says. He nods, turns his head into the part of the door. He looks a bit like he doesn't really know what to say. Harry looks down at his hands, wide and fixated. "Um. Okay."
They never made it there because Draco had grown pale and shaky half-way through the walk to it. Harry took his elbow, his other shoulder, led him away from eyes and behind a tree in case they needed to Portkey back to their hotel.
Then he heard it, a moment later, and his heart seized up and skittered in his chest towards a speeding race. He straightened, slightly, one sock still half-way off.
It was jarring, to be falling so naturally for somebody whose life Harry was forced into, who was forced into his. It was jarring, to want somebody who he had once been so sure he would never feel this way for, who he would never be able to have anyway because he could not imagine at all that Draco would want him back. Who Harry was damned to lose for what Draco might learn three years later, all the secrets Harry had kept.
Harry nods. He nods and listens and swallows hard. He thinks of Sirius, and how, for a while after, he always felt like he might break because everyone kept looking at him like he would.
It's hard to let him go again, watching him smile at him from the train window as it begins to move forward. Harry raises his hand out of his pocket, a still wave, smiling back. It's hard to let him go when he's only just gotten him back, but it's okay. Harry can let him go when he knows he will come back to him.
Sleep creeps upon Draco like a surprise, without him knowing or expecting, his head full of dreams of a brighter and more beautiful world. Of bright green eyes. Of a hand around his. Of a smile, following him into sleep.
There's a silence, and then, "I sometimes think I may have had it easier, back then. When I was dreaming."
Draco opened his eyes, drowsy, his magic dissipating away. He shifted his head a little on his shoulder, lolling slightly, looking up at him. He smirked, his gaze woozy and mellow and fixated, very closely, onto his own. "Hm. Maybe I'll serenade you."
"Something to do with Malfoy?" she then says. "I know he was your friend, and then I guess something happened and he left, and you've just been gone ever since."
" Ginny says. She's lying down on her back and staring up at the ceiling, Harry sat on the edge of the bed, staring at nothing. They were kissing, but his heart wasn't in it, and she noticed.  "Like your mind's always somewhere else."
Having clearly noticed the loss in his mass and the fact that he couldn't remember the last time he had seen Malfoy eat in front of his own sight, Harry could hardly refuse him that without feeling like an arsehole, and he didn't want to either. So he sighed, waited as Malfoy tickled the pear on the fruit bowl (and shuddered with a mutter of,
His face was guarded. Something brimmed behind the calm facade, the transfixed gaze meeting Harry's. His jaw was firmly locked, a knot of muscle jumping there.
" That was where his face almost contorted. He clenched his jaw harder, eyes red-rimmed and wide with something that was as much terror as it was anger.
He spent much of the next several days angry and despairing for his future. He drank himself into stupor on the weekends, his dour mood following him with his hangover the next morning.
Harry learned that, from the lack of what Draco said of his father, there wasn't much he wanted to talk about regarding him, except that he was away a lot of the time. That his mother taught him ballroom dancing. That he'd been playing violins for her since he could remember. That he started learning to cook when he was nine—his father actively discouraged this. His mother wasn't entirely happy about it, but she'd caved to his tantrums to be allowed for it, when his father wasn't there to stop him. He would then proceed to create the most disgusting combinations of food that he himself never dared eat. He would force all his friends to instead and demand praise.
Malfoy's head tipped back as he smirked licentiously on the bitten corner of his lower lip, leaning back on the chair. He drummed his fingers on the table top as he hummed appreciatively. "Viktor Krum."
"I just want to speak to him," Harry says. "He hasn't been receiving my owls." They keep coming back unopened.
Harry would fall asleep in bed with an unease that was all his own after he'd had sex with Malfoy, his chest knotted up as he wondered if it had been the bond after all, if it had made them do what they'd done in the drawing room, what they kept doing for many mornings and nights after. Harry didn't know what was worse, for it to be all his own, or for it to not be of his own will.
"I thought… I thought you'd be a lot more… grossed out. At the thought of that. Us, I mean." Harry could not explain the tightening feeling around his ribs when he said the words aloud.
would be, thereby opening himself up for insult. But the bell rang right after, signalling the start of classes, so they'd made a quick break-off for their respective classrooms.
On Monday, Draco finds his body heavier, drained of energy even despite the stronger dosage of Pepper-Up, feels uneasy tenfold on this particular day. It all comes to a head in Charms, his head spinning and light, colours dancing in his vision, and then everything goes black.
Hermione burrows her hair closer into his shoulder, takes his hand and squeezes it. Harry squeezes it back.
Malfoy did not seem as famished as he had claimed to be. He was eating far too slowly for that to be true, every now and then forgetting that he was supposed to be putting a spoonful of his soup to his mouth as he got lost in thought. They sat in complete silence as they ate, while Harry waited for Malfoy to start with whatever he wanted to converse about.
"Don't you sound sure of yourself?" Harry can imagine the cock of his eyebrow to go with those words, and he presses a hushed smile into the finger against his cheek, gripping the coin tighter.
" Harry said, breathed hard, looking down at his hand, at his nails touching the wood of the desk. Surely it didn't have to mean
A long, heavy hush fell over the room. All he could hear was the pounding of his own heart, the cold gush of fear seizing his gut. Ron's hand was heavy on his shoulder, Hermione's warm and tight in his.
Malfoy blinked. His jaw muscle locked, for a split second. "Potter, this isn't the place for a damned quarrel
"We can talk to each other on this," Harry says. He hands Draco one of the Galleons. "It's charmed so that if we say each other's names, it turns on, and we'll be the only ones to hear each other."
Harry had a nice time, but there was something much lower in energy this time, lesser in the ferocity of joy and celebration and chaos, as if he was bringing down everybody's mood with him, which made him feel guilty. He seemed to have a lot of that these days.
Draco glanced at him. "Nothing. I was just thinking about it." His throat convulsed. He looked down, at the top of Teddy's head, who was nestling his hair back against Draco's chest, trying to see him. He flicked a small smile down at him.
They got up only to get themselves something to eat, somewhere around noon, finally. Harry made them both coffee, and then got started on breakfast.
"I want to have us looked over by a healer," Malfoy said one day, having come to Harry while he was reading in bed.
Near the end of the night, Andromeda had gone home with Teddy, and George and Angelina had also left early. The rest of them all danced to Christmas songs on the wireless — Arthur with Molly, spinning her around until they grew tired and sat down. Ginny with Luna, arms fully wrapped around each other's necks and shoulders, and Ron with Hermione, smiling and murmuring with their faces close, whilst Narcissa sat in the corner uneasily but smiled too much. Harry had asked her for a dance to try not to let her feel excluded or bored or uneasy, and she'd taken him up for it, but sat down eventually after a while, and told Harry to go pull her son up by the hand and into a dance instead. She left not long after, with a general farewell, a handshake with Molly, a kiss to Draco's cheek, a touch to Harry's face and a smile.
Harry's movements hitch, falter. He finally moves, putting a pawn one step forward. "Oh. What'd she say?"
The sickening fester in his chest is soothed only by the way that, every now and then, when Potter pulls a great stunt that has the crowds cheering and wild, his green eyes find Draco for a short moment, a broad smile on his face that puts his own swollen heart to his throat, slow and erratic, hiding just so behind an uplift at a corner of his mouth.
"No, I… fuck," Harry whispered, closed his eyes. He rubbed at his face, the guilt twisting his stomach. "No. I'm so sorry. For… I don't know what came over me. I was so out of line. I shouldn't have done that."
He didn't feel much about it. Maybe it meant he never had. Maybe he just never felt much about anything anymore.
And he won’t remember mornings like these in the kitchen, and he won't remember dancing together by Christmas trees and fairylights, and he won’t remember snowfights and notes in every corner of a moderate-sized house and a wedding, growing old and grey together, all those perfect and bright and mundane moments. Anything from those dreams.
After the ceremony, all of them flooed into Grimmauld's Palace, Malfoy with bags of his things. Whilst Molly made dinner, Ron and Hermione sat beside Harry. The three of them were in armchairs by the fireplace, Hermione's head pressed to Harry's shoulder. Ron and Hermione were alternating between silence and speaking in murmurs to each other.
"You might undergo therapy, by high-tier Mind-Healers that have studied the effects of the potion and how to tackle such complications. This is considerably slow and taxing, I must admit, when compared to Permanent Partial Obliviation."
"Vengeance," Harry repeats, just before Draco balls up snow and smears it all over his face, thereby beginning a full-fledged snowball fight that lasts for an indecipherable amount of time.
Harry smiled. It must have been a while since he'd slept that well, and he did look a lot less tired now, but there were still dredges of fatigue left, the kind of fatigue that couldn't go away by a couple hours of sleep. "You must have been exhausted."
Harry snorted a soft, drunken laugh into Draco's jaw, where he was burrowing his cold nose, as he began to sing in low murmurs, running a hand down Harry's hair, scraping light at his cheek, the side of his neck. Harry didn't understand a word of it, just liked the sound of his voice, that he was singing for him, smiling into a kiss on Draco's neck. He could see the canines of Draco's quiet, sweetly tipsy grin, still looking up at Harry closely. His nail traced the line of Harry's jaw, pulling his face closer with a press, lips onto his.
"It doesn't seem so, judging by the look of you,"  she says disapprovingly. "I'll have to keep you here for the day, perhaps a few more. Nutrition, revitalising and strengthening potions three times a day should make you good as new, as well as a long, magically-induced rest."
Potter quiets upon seeing that, swallowing again. His fingers curl around his waist, thumb tracing over a marred, smooth line. He still hasn't seen them, what they all look like. Draco's body. He's only touched them during a heated kiss, a hand slipping under his shirt, laying warm over a meld of skin and too smooth tissue.
There was a shattered plate on the floor. Malfoy was slumped against the cabinets with his legs sprawled out unevenly, shivering. He was breathing shallow and ragged, his chest moving fast and high. Blood was smudged under his nose, on the knuckles of his hand.
There was so much to talk about, and they would, soon, in another time. Right now, with a crane of his neck, Harry only kissed him again then, kissed him hard, pulling him down with a gentle handful of the back of his hair, pulling him in as close as they could by his back and his waist and whispering,
"Fine. Just— " He huffs, quavering a bit, going quiet for half a moment. "They were all mad. And personal. And incredibly pathetic."
Draco settles down, and then there's a hush falling over them. Harry rubs the coin with his thumb. The fatigue is creeping up on him, beneath the nostalgia of remembering his first meeting with the two most important people in his life.
"No really," Draco's saying, edging on a nervous huff of a laugh. "It's very cool. If you only saw it! But there's a lot I can't—"
Draco hummed, but said nothing else. He looked slightly sunken-eyed, though as far as Harry knew, he was no longer staying awake late into the night anymore.
At some point after Draco finds himself in the bathroom, nauseated and heaving for air and shaking. The vague sense that there's something fumbling out of the hands of his control is a constant, small part of him, but it bears down on him with the weight of a tsunami this time, drowning him under. There are too many things that can go wrong now in the one thing Draco's life is narrowed down to. Too much he can lose, too much that he might not end up having in the end. And it's not the same. Nothing is the same as it was
Draco rolls his eyes, exasperated. But then he's grabbing Harry's face and pulling him in, nose to nose, sort of grinning into his grin, Harry laughing. Through the rest of the song, they dance with faded smiles and foreheads together, by a Christmas tree and fairylights.
It's a strange and heavy thing between them, this weight of what neither of them can acknowledge aloud. A memory of a moment, buried deep between them, and yet lingering all the same. A memory of a kiss and all that it meant, somewhere in their minds.
On the Quidditch Pitch at night, Harry runs into the broomshed, brings two brooms out. They spend almost an hour flying around instead of sleeping, in the soothing abyss of silences, in the sounds of shouted chatter over winds, in echoes of laughter.
Draco sets his jaw. There is a tight, swooping feeling in his chest. He holds himself still and careful, controlled. He blinks, a bit fast. "What, do I look at you like I like being with you? So sorry. How terrible of me."
Luna's face lights up on seeing Draco. She stands from her deeply, unsightly couch, and she runs across the distance, flinging herself right into his arms as he catches her. Draco is laughing as he stumbles back, holding her tight. Harry thinks of the way he used to move away from everybody's hands, and how he's told Luna in his letters of forgetting those memories of what had happened to him too.
He had caught sight of Draco next to Luna on the sidelines, arms folded. He was looking down and away, lips rolling back into a bitten smirk, as if on the edge of a reluctant sort of laugh.
"I do mind, actually," Malfoy said without looking up. Harry glared at him, and Malfoy flicked his eyes up at him from under the bow of his head. He sighed, as if Harry was the one that had inconvenienced him, waving his hand to let some of his notes push up over each other.
His past is there on his body, all on full display, and though Blaise does not give away much of a reaction at first — that well-practiced cool and collected expression — the way his jaw goes tight and his breathing goes all wrong, gaze fixated on his torso, is enough of a reaction.
Draco is playing with his fingers, on his knee, as he's listening. He doesn't say anything right away.
He was caught between staying, doing the one thing that could be keeping Malfoy's life in him, and seeking help from someone, anyone, that would know better than Harry.
Elias shook his head, only some of the perturbation and confusion clearing from his gaze. "I don't understand. I thought you were interested…?"
, he tried to think, but it didn't entirely settle right, as if he was thinking that of a stranger. A disconnected sort of fact. A foreign taste in his mouth.
The gala was all drinks and talking and dancing. Harry had a table at the corner, where everybody came to talk to the guest of honour. While Draco was hosting and going around checking on people, conversing with them and charming them with his close attention and easy laughter, Harry was in the company of a man who went on a long-winded story about the amount of money he had made over the years, how he made it, and how he started. Harry was nodding politely along to it, forcing interjections, not entirely certain of what else to say.

Bill, to his credit, hardly reacted, and Harry only understood a while later that he wasn't even surprised, and he learned that, apparently, this sort of thing was there in nearly every kind of bond. He took another thread of their magic, asked all his questions, and then took his leave with a reassuring hand tapping down on Harry's shoulder.
"I'll… I'll be in the kitchen, if you want to talk more," Harry said. He turned around, uncrossing his arms, and made a hazy walk out and back to the kitchen, feeling a little out of himself. A little unreal.
Some time later, Teddy got fussy and wanted to go out, so Harry obliged, as if he could ever deny his godson when he had him all wrapped around his little finger. He jostled the light weight of the baby in his arms until he had a comfortable grip on him, calling out to Andromeda that he was taking Teddy outside, receiving a muffled response back. He opened the door and found Draco right there in his long black overcoat, his hand raised, just about to knock.
"Don't tell him I told you," Harry tells him. "But Ron likes to call this 'their song'. He likes to replace 'Caroline' with 'Hermione' and serenade her when he's drunk."
s, and he remembered the way the curse muddled so much between them, how strange and uncomfortable it could be for Draco to be held by a man he would know was in love with him when he didn't feel the same, and the way Draco didn't need to be burdened by anything more that had to do with Harry, because Harry had done enough to ruin him. And then he knew that he could never say anything.
"That'll work," Draco says. He's still eying the Galleon, turning it this way and that, a quirk of a smile at his lips. He looks up at Harry, still with that impressed smile, and Harry's heart inexplicably flips into his throat. "It's much better than risking being found by Filch, or bloody
Harry shrugged. He kicked off the ground, until he was high up in the air. He smirked, bouncing his eyebrows down at him.
"My…" Harry smiled slightly, tasting the sweet word that came in his mouth, the way it felt to think of Draco with it. "My husband, actually."
"Now run, you disastrous fool," Draco says, and grabs his hand, pulling him along for a run through the empty commons and for the kitchens. There's only about ten minutes left for breakfast until the classes start.
The flow of the curse had become non-uniform. It remained in the circuit running through him and Malfoy, but now the intensity of it was redirected more towards Malfoy, less towards Harry.
He saw it on his body, the day after his obliviation. All the scars of what they did. He didn't remember how they got there, beyond an intellectual knowing of what had happened — but they were all over him, and the reality of it still lived within them, and even if it had less of a hold on him without his memories, it did not stop hurting.
"Come on, Draco, just go back to bed," Harry said. Draco did not budge from his place, lips pressed together. "Please?"
Draco woke up a bit later, with a stir of his narrow hips and legs that caught Harry's attention. His eyes were open, so very grey, softened by the frown of slumber right after waking. He woke fully, and was then locked in gaze with Harry for a few seconds.
"Am I boring you?" Draco says, pressing his lips together with a look at him. He has to crane his head against his shoulder, arch an eyebrow, to be able to do that. "You're getting lost in some fantasy again, aren't you?"
There is a long silence after that, Potter pulling him back against him, rubbing circles over the soft skin of his wrist. He looks angry, his jaw set tight, and he doesn't speak, his body terribly tensed.
The conversation ends, eventually. When Draco gets up to his feet and turns around, he sees Harry there in the doorway. He was so lost in Pansy's words still ringing through his head that he forgot to move on time. He straightens, a bit startled. Draco's staring at him, a bit startled himself.
Draco threw him a sympathetic look, clearly showing that he was not even going to bother to try and help. Harry sighed. He didn't want him to, but some effort or pretense would have been nice anyway.
When it's hard to make sense of things, he goes to Hermione, and asks her without mentioning anybody, though she does give him a long, considering look before she answers with an affirmation that, yes, it is possible for one person to like both boys and girls, and yes, it is perfectly alright to, and yes, it's fine and normal to realise it at a very later age, and yes, it's still real if it's just one person when you've believed for most of your life that you only like people of one gender. She doesn't ask him anything, but Harry gets the strong feeling that he wasn't being as subtle as he thought he was by framing his questions in a hypothetical manner, and that she was only respecting his wishes to disclose anything in his own time.
Potter is watching him, face turned into the palm of Draco's hand. His glasses aren't on his face, and somehow the green of his eyes are always clearer and brighter without them, even in his dreams. And now here. He will always be the only thing as bright and beautiful as his dreams.
He pushed off the doorframe. When Draco noticed him next to him, he stopped humming, but he flashed him a quick smirk, falling with the glance back at the tea, putting in the teabag into his mug.
There is a brief moment in which he can see himself like this from a distance, hunched over, head bowed between shoulders. A huff sounds throughout the room — his own, thick and shaky and nothing to do with humour, and with this distance comes a detached sort of marvel at how his life became that to that to this. What he'd been before a war, in the midst of a war, a dream. What's become of him now, here. Him, still with his head lost in dreams, still living life through their haze, only that he is now awake. Him, in love so painful and aimless it is almost entirely grief, in love so full and heavy and overwhelming he can hardly breathe from it.
With his mind a warzone, fear and pain hot and pulling his chest taut, Harry clambered up on the couch, whispering, "I don't know, Merlin, I don't know, I
Harry spent some time making finishing touches upon it, improving details here and there, blending colours a little more until he was somewhat satisfied. The warm and cool colours looked unevenly toned, exaggerated just enough that it looked vibrant and slightly surreal, but he had always found something charming about that.
Malfoy's expression shifted slightly, something nearly of a softening, but not quite. He smirked, long, nimble fingers curling around his hand. "Goodbye, Potter."
He remembered the mischievous smirk on Malfoy's face. Oh no. Oh, fuck no. Something was about to happen, wasn't it? Something bad and illegal and
Ron and Hermione still don't know about his escapades with Draco, and he isn't sure how they'd feel about it either.
What it also meant was that they were not quite so awkward around each other whilst they were doing the necessitated contact, and the discomfort was what had kept them quiet and not looking at each other. Now it meant they talked, and when they talked, they got annoyed at each other and fought, and some days, if it didn't end in sex or just a calm and bored departure, it ended in childish shoving and pulling at each other's shoulders and chest and faces, as if they were in school all over again. Sometimes even
There was no hiding it, and maybe it didn't matter in the end anyway, because now that it was out, Harry could think that maybe it was better that Draco knew now, here, when he was still here, that Harry had loved him when he was.
In front of the wardrobe, the door flung open and the drawer broken, were all the paintings splayed on the ground, a little over each other. Draco had a knit between his brows, fingers tentative on the closest one. Harry slumped against the doorframe with the force of the retreat of his panic, the confusing mingle of painful relief, of a new kind of fear. Draco was eying every painting, slow, taking in each one with a sort of wild-eyed confusion, like he couldn't believe what he was seeing, couldn't understand it.
Ron and Hermione would stay the night at his house. There wasn't much conversation at the table, and Harry mostly spent it staring down at his plate, pushing his boiled vegetables around. Malfoy had skipped dinner. He'd gone straight upstairs with his bag, a heavy hand on the railing.
He made his way over to them, trying to push down the swollen throb of his heart jumping up into his throat. Draco's eyes caught his mid-conversation, and the linger of a laugh on his face faded slightly.
Draco gets a job at a shabby little coffee shop. He gets sacked after two weeks because he drifts away, doesn't get the orders right, forgets too much.
The Curse-Breaker who would operate on the curse was a tall man in a long coat, black hair slicked back, a suitcase in hand. His name was Xavier. A Healer would be assisting in the procedure, Francine, who contrasted entirely with Xavier's intimidating demeanour.
"Why would I?" Harry asked, waiting for the kettle to boil with his hip against the edge of the counter, arms crossed over his chest. He was groggy and tired, which made him just on the edge of irritated at everything and nothing.
"We all have homework," Neville says, hiccoughs a laugh. "It's alright, Malfoy. You can dither over finishing it off the last few days with the rest of us."
