Draco's look of shock didn't change except for the blush that now tinged his cheeks.
“Have you both decided on a name?” she asked Ginny, standing next to Harry as the quill began to scratch.
Draco couldn't bear to look into those green eyes again, not like this. He felt pathetic.
There was little that a well-performed memory charm couldn't fix.
"They
"Yeah, I'm sure. He used it when he was here. Dumbledore gave it back to me at Christmas my first year."
don’t you?” She stood at the side of their table, hands on her slim hips looking between them.
Draco closed his eyes, inhaling deeply to steady the intensity of the desire ripping through him. His head fell forward, forehead pressing into Harry's shoulder as he stepped back slightly, mourning the loss of their bodies touching for only a moment.
He then threw the fabric over them both, still facing him.
"It's fine. I've known it for years," he said finally with a small sniff, gracefully wiping his long fingers over his tear stained cheeks. Harry forced himself to focus.
"Draco," he whispered, his own voice sounding far away. Draco opened his eyes and stopped, staring at Harry beneath him as if he couldn't believe their current reality. "Draco, are you alright?" He rested his hands gently on his hips and was answered by the trademark Malfoy smirk. Without warning, Draco let himself drop, burying Harry's cock inside himself in an instant. Harry threw his head back and yelled. "Shit," he gasped, his eyes watering from the sudden intensity. He had never felt anything so hot, so tight, in all his life.
"Malfoy, wait," Harry gasped.
Potter wanking in there? What if he was even crazier than he originally thought for just automatically assuming that it
"Or maybe it was in Madam Malkins," Draco whispered. "The first time you saw me." Harry knelt next to the tub, Draco's eyes following his movement.
Malfoy kissed him like he needed Harry's mouth on his in order to breathe, one hand tightly wound into Harry’s thick black hair and the other clutching the side of his face. His tongue explored Harry’s mouth with a passionate, desperate intensity that went straight to Harry’s cock, hardening quickly beneath his denims.
"You know what does it for me, Potter?"
– but then Malfoy sucked on Harry’s bottom lip, frantically gripping Harry’s t-shirt as they leaned against the brick and the sound of his blood rushing against his ears drowned that voice out.
He really was beautiful - and not just physically, no. Damn him. Potter was way more than a pretty face. He was loyal and caring, full of generosity and kindness and
kids already, Harry! We gotta catch up, babe.”
Draco whipped around, wand-arm flailing, immediately firing off a hex in the direction of the unknown intruder's voice. The hex hit a large stack of mismatched furniture, sending it crashing to the ground and Draco's eyes finally focused on who had spoken.
"What are you doing here?" Harry asked, realizing that he had hoped Draco would have fled by then.
He was spending nearly every waking moment outside of class with fucking thing. He was barely eating, barely sleeping, barely
"Alohamora." Locked. Harry tried a few other spells to no avail. He sighed angrily and began to examine the rest of Draco's large closet, his frustration apparent as he picked up items of clothing and tossed them aside. He kicked a few pairs of dress shoes that had probably cost more than his newly purchased broom out of his way to examine the walls, grateful when he found them to be just stupid walls. He maneuvered around a long, fancy looking sofa that was in the center of the closet, back to the mysterious second door. Just as Harry was considering blowing the damn thing off its hinges, he heard faint footsteps coming towards him.
"Love you?" he finished for him. "Yeah, it's not just lust, Draco. I'm sure of that, though I'm not really sure when it happened. Maybe when you didn't give me, Ron and Hermione up to Voldemort? Or maybe it was during 6th year. Or before 4th year, in the woods at the Cup, when you were really just warning us to get out of there. Maybe it was even on the train, Draco, when you offered friendship to me before anyone else."
-" he spluttered through his tears.
would make him stop, because there was no way he was able to go back now. Not now – not when he finally knew what he had been missing, not when he was fueled by so much desire and by so much whiskey.
Draco instantly recognized his Invisibility Cloak and his eyes widened.
Draco had been interrupted a number of times in his life while masturbating and every single time - save for idiot Blaise a few nights ago - it was by someone he found to be the absolute least desirable person imaginable. He had encountered Crabbe, his own mother and even that insane house-elf Dobby once. Every single one of those times had caused his erection to deflate faster than a punctured Quaffle.
Harry's eyes met Draco's, and he was instantly reminded of Snape and his similar look of longing and love and so many other unspoken things, and Harry realized with a shock that it was the same. It broke his concentration, his mind, his heart to see it so clearly before his vision suddenly blurred, whether from pleasure or the beginnings of tears he didn't know. Draco was clenching impossibly tight around his cock, his heels digging almost painfully hard into Harry's lower back, and he felt his toes curling, his legs tensing, his hips shuddering from the sheer force of it, forgetting to warn Draco that he was coming because Draco was already digging his nails into Harry's shoulders and screaming. He had let go of his cock and Harry could feel hot spurts of come splashing against his abdomen as his own cock pulsed with wave after wave of release inside Draco. He arched his back, pushing his cock as deep as Draco's body would allow, throwing his head back as he slowly rode out the last of his orgasm. Draco shook beneath him, filled with Harry's come and his lean torso slick with his own.
– express so much intense desire for him so blatantly. Everything with Ginny had always been so timid and sweet and gentle and –
Thrilled, she said, “Well, I’m still just sixteen – I’ll be seventeen in three months, but I’ll be back at Hogwarts by then for my last year.”
"Y-you've gone mad, Potter. You're insane," he said, looking up at him.
"I can't tell you that," he immediately replied, still refusing to look at the other man. He tried to ignore the immense guilt he felt over Bell and Weasley welling up inside of him.
And despite how wrong it was, Draco was hardening at the thought. While he would never force it, the fantasy that he had been wanking to for the better part of that year was possib-
“Aw, he
"That's between us and the Headmaster,
," Harry grit out, his right arm flexing again, and Draco had to bite back the desperate sound that tried to escape him.
“Can we –” Harry gasped. “Can we – stop talking about it?” he asked weakly, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand as his head swam.
"I didn't get the dittany fast enough on my chest, Potter," he whispered quickly, opening up the rest of his shirt to reveal the long, thin scar that curved across his torso, still pink and healing.
Harry began to thrust against him, repeatedly grinding his naked body against Draco's with a look of determined desperation on his face. The consistent hot pressure coupled with Harry's avidity further threatened his hold on himself and he knew if he didn't do something about it quickly this would be over much too soon. He let the small, slick flesh leave his lips with a gasp.
Harry glared at both Snape and Draco before he turned away, marching off towards Gryffindor Tower without ever glancing back.
“Bloody fucking
Harry ushered them out of the closet and back into the master bedroom, all while feeling terribly uncomfortable with current state of his trousers. He moved his wand swiftly, effectively blockading the door to the closet, barring access to anyone except Ministry officials.
Draco stepped only six more inches forward right into the shower stall and Harry immediately stepped back, his back pressed flat against the cool tiles.
about what I said?"
Then he immediately sunk through the floor, disappearing from sight. Draco stared at his feet and inhaled deeply, his heart starting to beat again. Stunned at the encounter, he slowly turned back to the broken Vanishing cabinet behind him in a daze.
“I di’nt –” Harry started to say, his head swimming.
"Perhaps," said Malfoy with a small shrug, his eyebrow quirking. Harry looked as if Draco had just slapped him.
He immediately brought the fabric back up to his eyes, looking slightly mad as he examined it.
He got to the men's quidditch showers only seconds later, peeling off his robe in hurried disgust as he went. His cloak whooshed past his legs as he flung it down on the bench and then started at his tie - long, pale fingers pulling the precise knot undone in a second. The emerald and silver fabric landed on the floor near feet that were kicking off shoes and socks, rushing against time. He pulled off his house sweater vest so violently that his slicked back, white-blonde hair became mussed, sticking up awkwardly in random places and falling into his eyes. His fingers started working on the delicate buttons of his shirt. He was half-way down when he impatiently decided he should just use his wand to speed the rest up when he stopped dead, hand held out perfectly still in mid-reach towards his robe.
Harry watched as Malfoy furiously slapped his hand over the spot on the wall. After a good ten minutes of Draco practically yelling various phrases in Latin at it, which would have been entirely comical to Harry had he not been so pissed off, he turned to glare at him.
been kissed like that in his entire life.
Draco searched Snape's face for a moment, then slowly wrapped his arms around him, hiding both his face and tears into his stiff shoulder.
He was pulling the wool over his own eyes now, he knew that, but the question gave him an overwhelming urge to be sure. His feet were suddenly obeying curiosity. He could just peek around the wall. That's it. Just a quick peek to confirm or deny who -
to only concentrate on the task at his hands, but that was proving to be impossible. Almost as impossible as it was to repair the damn Cabinet.
Draco turned to give Harry a death glare. "Potter, don't you dare - my mother - in her own house -"
Harry could feel his jaw clenching, a heat rising to his face as he inhaled sharply, smelling stale closet air and a faint scent of expensive cologne.
I think – ah, I think –”
"Not here," Draco said softly, pulling Harry by his wrist to follow him. He was naked except for the thin, tight white undershirt, and Harry let his eyes roam over Draco's back down to his pale, perfectly rounded arse. He was being lead out of the bathroom, back into the closet and into Draco's bedroom. He watched his surroundings change through a lust filled daze when the reality of it all struck him. He was most definitely about to have sex, something he had only done enough times to count on one hand, with Draco Malfoy. His school rival. A Slytherin. An ex-Death Eater. Another man. A man who, he reminded himself, had just practically confessed his love to Harry less than thirty minutes ago.
"Some."
"A boy I knew died."
"It doesn't change who I am, either," he said quietly. "Incarcerous." Draco's eyes grew wide as thin ropes suddenly flew from Harry's wand, wrapping themselves snakelike around his arms and chest. Harry took a deep breath, unable to avoid the inevitable any longer.
"I have heard from the one who cries," he continued, his voice leaving a creepy, quiet echo. "We normally do not interfere with matters of the living - and yet - you
"My father is not demented, Potter, he-"
"Pot - Harry," he swallowed. "Wait. I did those - it
and past curfew no less," he hissed, his wand now out of sight and Draco realized Snape had given Harry a false memory.
"Well, if you want, we can go to the Ministry straight away and I'll question you in the interrogation room all night." Fear flickered across Malfoy's haughty, pointed face. Harry would have felt guilty for using his status in such a way, had he not been using it against someone who had already mastered the technique by age eleven.
“Harry!” Hermione gasped, and Ron was immediately at his side, rubbing his shoulder firmly.
Harry
He watched Snape's memory play in his mind's eye - a little girl with dark red hair was sitting near a lake next to him, laughing. She turned and smiled - her gorgeous, emerald green eyes sparkling. He was thrown out as fast as he had been allowed in, but it was all he needed to see.
He wrapped his left arm, hand still clutching the two memory vials, around Draco's back, causing their bodies - save for the awkward space where Draco's trapped arm was - to press flush against each other. Harry wasn't sure who broke the kiss first, except that they both pulled away to gasp at the feel of their hard, fabric covered cocks suddenly pressed together. Draco's eyes were glazed over, his swollen lips standing out stark red against his pale features.
"Memory vials. Loads of them. Labeled by date." Harry reported back. "Pretty sure these two alone are enough for two life sentences."
That was far too ridiculous. He needed to leave. He needed to gather his soggy, sweaty clothes and high-tail it the fuck out of there. He bent down and snatched his tie up from the floor when a muffled, desperate sound reached him, going straight to his cock. Biting his lip, he slung his tie around his neck and began reaching for his vest when a dangerous thought struck him.
August 28th, 1993
As soon as Harry was well out of sight, Draco's knees hit the stone floor hard. The pain he felt was nothing compared to the state of his heart.
Harry could feel said shots in his stomach, rolling around as he walked, beginning to feel sicker by the minute and still wishing Ron would talk about anything,
Harry abruptly stopped walking, ducking into an alleyway before promptly vomiting on to the pavement.
"It's impossible."
“Labor and Delivery, Room 17,” the charge nurse told them, and when they arrived to the room a Healer was just exiting.
This was unlike any of the other few Invisibility Cloaks he had ever held. It strangely felt like air and he couldn't help bringing it up to his eyes. The most expensive of Cloaks, which Draco had always assumed Harry's was, were intricately woven from Demiguise hair.
“So, you two fought a lot at school, then?” she asked him curiously, and Harry tore his eyes away from the blonde’s mouth.
"It is true, isn't it?" Malfoy said breathlessly. "Did you think about me at night, too, Potter, in your dirty Gryffindor dorm?" Harry heard the memory vials in the pocket of his robe clink together as he grabbed Malfoy by his white undershirt.
"I see. So are the others also aware of this place?"
Harry was clambering up from his barstool. He stumbled a bit as he got re-adjusted to gravity and followed Malfoy and the girl, whose name neither of them knew, to the back door of the bar that lead out to the smoking patio.
Potter could use a Dark spell like that and have no fucking
"No. My father told me.” Harry looked down at the memory vial in his hand again, realizing its probable contents and feeling sick.
- away from all the stress.
His lips continued to meet his own hand repeatedly until he removed it, wanting to find out if he could
"No, Potter, I'm crying because Puddlemere lost to the fucking
"Yes. I was," he whispered, and his wand - though still tightly gripped - was now completely at his side.
"You must do whatever it takes, Draco. You keep going."
"Good Lord, Potter, did you have to be so barbaric?" Harry's face felt like fire.
"Malfoy, did you take anything made by Romilda Vane?"
“Wouldn’t you like to know,” he said, looking down at her and smirking. “How old are you, anyway?”
Draco immediately interrupted that thought with an angry scream, amplified tenfold in the small cabinet space he had been standing in, working to repair it unsuccessfully.
Draco turned to Harry, his eyes red and puffy, wildly reminding Harry of kissing Cho Chang, except that for some bizarre and inexplicable reason his memory decided to suddenly replace her, and Harry then saw himself kissing a wet faced Draco Malfoy. "That's why my father must have murdered him," he whispered, and Harry was utterly horrified, but not because Lucius Malfoy had killed an innocent child.
"It's alright, Potter, call me whatever you want. I'm not expecting a sudden confession of love just because we fucked." Harry felt his heart drop hearing Draco revert to his cold, cruel tones so quickly.
know it would do that!” he yelled, hand slamming the table, his face red. One of the empty shot glasses fell over and started rolling in a circle. Malfoy stared at him.
"No. No, no, n-"
Ignoring his sober voice of reason that told him winning this stupid, impromptu challenge that had erupted after the two men – who had not seen each other for nearly six years – didn’t matter, Harry reached for another shot.
"I thought you lot fled the country."
Malfoy, girl still attached to his side, moved along the crowd, brushing against the brick wall to an empty corner, discarded beer bottles and other bits of rubbish amidst a sea of cigarette butts on the ground around them. Taking his arm off her, he pulled three cigarettes from the pack, putting one in the corner of his mouth and handing the other two to the girl and Harry in silence. Malfoy then pulled a muggle –
"Draco," he choked out softly over the lump that had formed in his throat. Harry willed the tears threatening to escape his impossibly green eyes back.
Draco nodded and thought better to ask which from the tone of The Baron's eerie voice, though he desperately hoped that that half-headless Gryffindor piss-cloud wasn't one of them.
“Harry! There you are!” Hermione said rushing over, smiling broadly. “Come on you two drunkards, let’s go.”
In the 30 or so seconds he had spent ripping his clothes off, he had not noticed the faint rushing sound of water coming from the far end of the next room. The sound he
were the real brothers… which has
"I see. I will not take any points from Slytherin, then, for your admirable... honesty."
"It isn't? So, it's just me you get off on then, is it? Have I just really been the object of your desires all these years instead of your enemy, Potter? Is that the real reason why you stalked me all of sixth year?"
"Please," Harry begged against Draco's lips, and Draco's own cock ached from hearing it. He wanted to hear Harry Potter begging him forever. His fingers flew to undo the fly of Harry's jeans, pulling them down with himself as his knees reached the dark marble of his bathroom floor.
"You still haven't answered me," he said, his voice coming out in an unintentional whisper, and no amount of self-restraint could stop his eyes from roaming down that tan, gorgeously toned body that was more perfect than any fantasy could produce.
What did it matter? What was the point of ruining the Cup? To instill fear? To gain power?
“Yes, indeed, the famous Chosen One and only,” Malfoy said, smirking at him and leaning his crossed arms onto the table. Harry’s mouth pressed into a thin line in aggravation, blush deepening.
"It's a passphrase that'll open it though, yeah?" Harry said, standing up straight.
." His voice was muffled as he spoke to his thighs, his elbows now digging against his knees as he gripped the back of his own head.
"Potter?" He sounded as confused as Harry felt.
And here he was now, edging closer to three years later, the mental war within himself now waging alongside fighting a physical one, his question finally answered.
"And seeing as you already have detention with me starting tomorrow morning, Potter," he said, loudly speaking over him. "I no longer feel it necessary to disturb the Headmaster so late... You may return to your common room."
Or was it always like that?
Ron said with a drunken sob, a tear finally falling down his freckled face.
Harry traced his swollen, red lips with the head of his cock before just barely dipping the tip inside his open, waiting mouth with a soft grunt. He pulled it back out and tapped it against Draco's bottom lip, and Draco made a wanton noise in response that sounded embarrassingly feminine. Harry dipped the tip past his lips once more and Draco's tongue darted out against him, making Harry gasp under his mercy again. He replaced Harry's hand with his own, circling his tongue around the crown and tracing the tip of it up his frenulum and over the slit, reveling in the clean taste and feel of him. Out of a wicked curiosity, he abruptly stopped licking. Harry immediately whined in frustration, desperate need etched into every inch of his face as he looked down at the blonde, pleading, and Draco then realized that sucking cock was the hottest power struggle he had ever endured.
"It's okay," Draco said, his voice still breathless and somewhat hoarse. Wincing, he lowered his legs to the bed and caused Harry's cock to slip out completely. Draco's words soothed Harry's concern and thoughts began flooding back to his mind while his sated body relaxed.
Malfoy finished his cigarette, scrubbing it out on the brick next to him, sending a shower of orange embers dying slowly to the ground.
"I don't care." he said defiantly and looked at Harry, who was now looking very touched. Harry held his gaze, and Draco’s heart leapt as he thought maybe - just maybe - he might not be alone in his true feelings.
"Ready?" Harry said, turning to the gargoyle.
"Not a clue."
Draco blinked up at him, taken aback.
“It’s about that time, Mrs. Potter!” said a Healer in a sing-song voice, waltzing into their room after an almost non-existent knock.
Does that - does that mean you honestly don't know
“He nearly killed me the one time,” Malfoy said, still rummaging, and it was clear now that Malfoy was just as drunk as he was.
"Tell me, Harry," Draco said quietly, still smirking and ignoring him. "Does the she-Weasley know you get off on other men?" His wand emitted hot sparks as it took everything he had not to throw Draco into a wall.
When Harry still looked dumbfounded, Draco supposed Harry thought he was one of those conspiracy loonies like Lovegood, and quickly rushed to explain himself.
Draco opened his mouth to tell him, except that he had nothing to say. His memories didn't lie to him, as much as he had tried to ignore their hidden honesty. Harry's question was exactly what that radical voice of his own had been asking for a long time.
"Are you mad, Potter?!” he yelled, straightening up. “Did those killing curses turn your brains funny?!"
Blaise had called it.
. His stint in the hospital wing a few days ago, courtesy of none other than Saint Potter, was the first time he had truly slept in ages, thanks to Pomfrey's large dose potions. He knew he was being set up to fail and he was determined to prevent it. He could feel himself becoming more reckless with each passing day, his desperation and depression settling in. It made him utterly devoid of hope. Snape should have just let him...
"Don't you dare," Malfoy growled, changing his position and pointing his hand in Harry's face so quickly Harry had nearly dropped both the vials and his wand. "Don't tell me you're fucking sorry, Potter." He spat, looking crazier than Harry had ever seen. "I've never been sorry about your idiot parents, have I? Or your pathetic godfather? Or that disgusting werew-"
"Was it now?" Draco said, his voice falsely inquisitive. "Or were you just thinking with your dick?"
well for that long, even if Merlin himself had cast it.
"Malfoy-" Harry gasped again, and the sound of his surname rushing quietly past full lips made his prick jerk against tight fabric.
“Arse.”
" he shook him before he spoke quickly, something that nearly sounded like panic in his voice. "Are you aware the Dark Lord has a direct connection into Potter's mind that Potter
"Yes."
"Yeah, maybe," he said softly, a small smile on his lips, sure that Draco had just given him the answer to when he had fallen in love with Harry. "Maybe I've always loved you."
Mesmerized, Harry quickly pushed Draco, whose hand was still tangled in the dark mess of his hair, until his back was flat against the wall once more, this time grinding his hips into him and desperately trying to hold back a deep groan. Draco inhaled sharply and worried his bottom lip between his perfectly straight, white teeth to keep himself from moaning. Their mouths crashed together again, knocking the left arm of Harry's glasses off his ear from the sheer force of it. He ground his hard cock into Draco's, both still covered by too many layers of offending fabric. Draco's hips arched off the wall to meet Harry's slow grind, and he was panting quickly into Harry's mouth through the gaps in their heated kiss. The memory vials nearly slipped out of Harry's now sweaty left hand and he pressed his fist into the wall behind Draco's right ear, holding himself steady as his hips increased their pace.
Malfoy smirked yet again.
"Yes. He was killed by a filthy muggle driving one of those metal hunks of rubbish."
He started to wonder, his sluggish brain starting to function again. His fantasies had, of course, never proceeded to this point and now that he was regaining his senses again, fear began to settle back in.
Draco's heart climbed into his throat. This couldn't be happening. This had to be some sort of crazy, karmic punishment for wiping Blaise's memory after he had just admitted to him
He expected disgust, or anger, or at the very least confusion from Snape as he looked into those black eyes. He was absolutely floored to find nothing but understanding and sympathy
He abruptly stopped himself, gripping his chains that began to rattle ominously and let out an unearthly groan.
“So, we sent him two on
He could feel his shoulders starting to shake and a soft sob escaped him despite his best efforts to stifle it.
"Yes," he moaned. "Yes, Harry." His left hand, still wrapped around his cock, began moving rapidly again. His grip in Harry's hair tightened, pulling him down for another kiss. It was difficult to breathe through it, even more difficult to keep their lips together as Harry's cock drove into Draco's perfect arse. Harry's brows knit together in concentration as he pulled away, refusing to be the first to come a second time.
"Are you alright, Potter?" Draco breathed back, and Harry could hear that smirk in his tone. It ignited something in him, something fierce, something that couldn't forget that Draco Malfoy had once been his enemy. Harry answered back by thrusting his hips up, causing Draco to lose balance and fall forward. Harry seized his opportunity, quickly bringing his knees up and his feet flat on the bed. Draco's face, inches away from his own, struggled to keep composure.
He thought.
was no matter how he denied it, to be so explicit during sex. It was driving him wild.
Harry turned to face him, grinning. "Look," he said, nodding towards the wall.
Malfoy paused at that, then started laughing again, and Harry joined right along with him.
"Why not?" Harry echoed back to him in the same seductive tone, and he swore he could see Draco's pupils dilating as the grip on his hand was slowly released. Harry lifted the fabric up and over Draco's head, his hair falling over his eyes. A deep blush was creeping across his sharp features, slowly moving down his neck and prominent collar bones to spread over the top of his bare chest. Harry's eyes followed it and then he realized why Draco had wanted to stop him.
"Why do you care, you lunatic?" Draco managed.
In response, Draco crashed his lips down to Harry's in another intense kiss, grinding their hips together again. Harry was frantically pulling him closer and it took Draco a great amount of effort to stop that intoxicating blissfulness.
Harry brought his hands up to rest on Draco's biceps as the blonde man panted, leaning over to press his cheek into Harry's shoulder. A moment later Draco removed his fingers and held out his hand towards an out of reach bedside table drawer. The handle rattled slightly and stopped. Draco huffed loudly in frustration.
“Are you serious, Potter?”
When he finished moments later with his signature on the line labeled ‘Father’, he stumbled a bit standing back up straight, handing the parchment back to the assistant. She looked down at it quickly, the wand in her hand ready to transfer the information to a very tiny blue bracelet.
The sound of him giving in and
," Harry swore yet again, his voice nearly a low, shaking sob.
Draco gasped, and Harry ripped himself away from him so fast his glasses flew off and landed somewhere on the hardwood floor with a clatter. He quickly scrambled for his wand, his heart in his throat as his fingers closed around the wood just in time to point it directly at Narcissa Malfoy, who had appeared in the doorway.
And just as he had in his fantasy, Harry tangled his hands into his wet, blonde hair, gripping and moving with Draco's head as it began to bob. Although he had never done it before, giving head was far from Advanced Arithmancy and he was enjoying every bit of it as much as he knew he would - if sucking his own fingers while he wanked had been any indication. Every motion of his mouth caused a new sound to be wrenched out of Potter, each one of them going straight to his own, ignored cock.
Draco's mouth dropped open. There was no way a Disillusionment charm would hold up
Sex had never been like that at all with Ginny, now that he thought about it. Not even their first time, which Harry had always regarded as being quite amazing up until a few moments ago. Being with Draco today alone was the most wonderful, intense, ridiculous, beautiful, passionate experience he had ever had. It made his heart ache and left his mind in a confused panic. If he really had figured it out correctly earlier, just how long had Draco been in love with him? And if he stopped lying to himself, when had he started to love Draco back?
He opened his eyes which had involuntarily screwed shut from anticipation and found the lifeless silvery-black ones belonging to The Baron shining across from him. Draco had never feared ghosts, but even he could admit The Baron, with his silver bloodstains and awful blank stare, was mildly terrifying.
And Harry, only for millionth time that week alone, had to remind himself that things were very different now that Voldemort was dead. He and Malfoy were no longer attending school together. They hadn't been for quite some time, and - he realized with a pang of some strange emotion he couldn't recognize - they never would again.
"Do you still want this, Potter?" he said just loud enough to be heard over the water hitting the back of his calves.
Sighing, Draco complied. "My father, Lucius Abraxas Malfoy, is dead." Malfoy's palm was still pressed against where the paint chip would have been as the wall disappeared at his words.
If the Dark Lord decided to burst through the wall and kill Draco right now, he would at least be able to say he died happily.
“Harry! Oh –
Malfoy seemed to be internally struggling with himself, when he suddenly leapt forward and made to grab the vials from Harry's hand. Harry reacted instinctively, quickly moving the vials in his left hand away. Instead of hexing him, he dropped his wand from his right hand and grabbed Malfoy’s outstretched arm, immediately pulling the other man to his chest and kissing him fiercely.
in Hufflepuff.”  She rested her chin on her fist, looking Malfoy in the eyes through her unnaturally long, black lashes. “You know, I never knew anything about all this house rivalry and famous witches and wizards type of stuff until I started Hogwarts because my parents are muggles.”
Harry took one last drag –
"I said I don't want your apologies, Potter," he growled into Harry's ear, rocking his hips into him. Harry groaned as their cocks pressed together again. He caught sight of the fading scar of the Dark Mark still visible on Draco's left forearm and decided he had gone completely insane. "Beg me, Harry," Draco whispered, and Harry obliged.
"Why?"
There came a low ‘oooh’ from the crowd around them that had formed earlier, gaining interest as the two men drunkenly challenged each other.
Wordless, wandless magic was near impossible, even for something as simple as a summoning charm. Harry was impressed the drawer had even reacted at all, until he felt the bed shift under him as Draco removed himself from Harry, and Harry cursed the damn drawer and everything inside it for not obeying Draco. He watched as Draco quickly got close enough to wrench it open, dig inside for a second and return with a small vial. Breathing deeply, he uncorked it and poured a small amount of clear liquid into his right palm.
"Malfoy, what does any of that shit matter?"
"You are too troubled."
That's exactly what Harry wanted, he realized, slowly pulling out from him as much as he could. That's always what he had wanted. To make Draco's composure disappear. To get the other boy to show his true emotions. To completely undo Draco Malfoy. He shoved his hips upwards roughly, his hands forcing Draco's hips down, their skin meeting with a loud slap. A strangled moan came from Draco, but it wasn't enough. Harry wanted to make him scream. Draco had already pulled his hips up, and quickly slid back, again, and again, and Harry was losing himself in Draco, his own composure already non-existent as he moaned in abandon under him. He thrust his hips up to meet Draco, and that something that had been ignited became ablaze when Draco licked his lips for a single second, the image sending Harry into a craze.
To see where you should go

“Lily was always very talented.”
“It’s fine, Harry. Nothing to worry about.” Harry seemed unconvinced, but didn’t ask again.
” Harry thought.
“Severus. It’s good to see you again. It’s been so long that I have forgotten your face. Lily wanted to ask you around for dinner tomorrow night. We found a flat for her in London, but we were hoping for some recommendations for a spot to eat at in London. Mr. Potter, you are more than welcome to come too.”
“If we start with that one, will it begin unraveling your charms?”
Herbology
Out of the four houses you already know
He put away his timetable after making some revisions, and pulled out his Potion’s homework. He felt Harry squeeze his hand under the table, and looked over at his boyfriend. He suspected that his friends might know about their relationship, even though he and Harry had been careful to keep it a secret, citing that they needed time to adjust. They had only been dating for a month.
Draco looked shocked and swallowed deeply. Then his face turned murderous.
“You shouldn’t be able to; it would most likely cause their minds to collapse in on themselves to try.” Severus cursed. He was pacing around his office, and seemed to be trying to work out the problem.
The girl looked at Pansy, who gently nudged her to Longbottom; she would be safe from hexes and curses in his company, as nobody would mess with one of the war heroes. Draco, watched this all happen with a feeling of dread settle into his stomach. He had interacted with Potter at the Platform, but had assumed the Saviour was there to send off Granger and Girl Weasley. Weasley and Potter coming back meant that Draco had no hope of completing the term without ending up in Azkaban. They would harass Draco for no reason, and if they didn’t, then Draco would probably say or do something to enrage the Golden Trio. Suddenly Zabini cleared his throat, bringing Draco out of his thoughts.
“When do you eat?” Potter looked surprised at Draco’s question, then a blush rose to his cheeks.
Draco couldn’t believe that Potter had blocked a curse from hitting his mother; what was he playing at? He was almost at the train when he turned to his mother. Her face was expressionless, but Draco knew she was worried about him returning to Hogwarts. He wanted to not worry about returning, however he was not a fool. This display on the Platform was just the beginning of the hatred he would deal with. He deserved it, he knew, but it would make the school year harder.
“Zabini saw your wrist on the train, and we have been monitoring ever since. Not that we care,” Draco sneered this and ignored the pang of guilt, “but we would rather not be blamed for the Saviour of the Wizarding World’s death. Which we will be as we are here in Hogwarts with you.”
Harry felt his heart break, and knew he was being ridiculous. He then pushed his feelings out of the way, and noticed that every wizard in the pub had turned their attention towards them. Harry barely bit back a curse. This was sure not to end well.
McTavish glared at the pair of Gryffindors for a few seconds, and then Potter shoved the boy away. Draco heard footsteps down the corridor, and Longbottom stared at Potter for a few seconds. Draco couldn’t tell what the look was about, but was waiting for the duo to turn their attention on the Slytherins. He then saw a purple light fly past Longbottom, and heard a crash and yelp. Longbottom looked behind him and said, “There was no reason for that, Ron.”
“That I have about half of the original fortune, so I don’t feel as bad about it. I still need to find a way to give them back their money though.”
“I have to tell the headmaster, it’s school rules Mr. Potter. He won’t make it worse.” Harry could tell that Madame Pomfrey didn’t believe her own assurance, but he just shrugged his shoulders. “You can go to class today, and now that I know my thank you note was because of this, I wish I never received it. Nobody should live this way without trying to get help; I understand your hesitation to go to one, as I subscribe to the Daily Prophet, but there should be one that’s different than that slimy -.” She cut herself off and looked embarrassed, then cleared her throat to continue.  “I’m not a licensed Mind Healer or I would offer to help. Goodbye, Mr. Potter.” She hugged Harry quickly and he walked towards the library as he had two free periods this morning before Defense Against the Dark Arts.
“Perhaps you are right, Neville.” Secretly, Draco doubted it.
“I did assume that you wanted to keep an outward appearance of Slytherin Unity, Zabini. Especially since you will also be targeted this year; nobody will care that you stayed neutral, they will only care that you are a Slytherin Pure-Blood.”
However, Harry needed to keep his chin up as none of his friends, except Draco and Hermione, knew about his parents being alive. He kept the mantra of this being his family going through his mind over and over, so he could try and keep a sunny outlook. He believed that he was succeeding and his friends were none the wiser.
Severus cleared his throat and said, “I actually have some information concerning that, but I believe it would be best said in private.”
Harry smiled at Draco and leaned over to kiss his boyfriend. They weren’t a perfect couple without any issues, but Harry hoped their relationship could come out stronger after this bump in the road and any future hiccups. Harry pulled back and smiled; he felt ready to burst from happiness both from making up with Draco and the potential to actually teach next year.
The month between Harry’s birthday and the day they went to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters was one of the longest months of Harry’s life. When he woke, almost a week after his latest suicide attempt, Harry was so distressed that he had failed yet again; didn’t the Universe realize how it would be better with Harry dead? He wasn’t awake long before Hermione came into his room and hugged him, then Ron told him quietly the scene they found was one of the worst he had ever seen. Harry felt a bit guilty over this, but he wouldn’t apologize.
Severus sneered at him and said, “James Potter spent his entire time at Hogwarts making my life miserable. Do you really think that he has changed?”
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Harry woke up and stared at the canopy of his bed for longer than normal, not entirely believing that this was his last day as a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry felt both happy and sad about it, Hermione or Draco would know the word for how he was feeling. Although he would no longer be a student, he was desperately hoping to come back the next year as the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor, but for that to happen he would need at least three N.E.W.T.S. He swallowed the feeling of anxiety over the thought of the N.E.W.T.S. He believed he did well on them, but he was admittedly distracted by one thing or another all year and did not study as much as Hermione or Draco.
Draco walked over to Harry and grabbed his hand. They walked out of the hospital and down the street. The restaurant they were eating at was a twenty minute walk from St. Mungo’s, so Draco and Harry were just going to walk there. Draco had forced Harry to learn quite a few charms to freshen up hair, clothes, and shoes when they left Hogwarts, so Harry often chose to walk to clear his mind and used the charms often.
After working for a little while Harry said, “Why do you keep stopping me? You hate me.”
Draco’s face was still swollen when the clock struck midnight that night; he was in the common room, hidden so that nobody would laugh at him anymore, and doing his homework assigned from Defense Against the Dark Arts the previous day. The new professor, Hartley, had shown up three days after the Welcome Feast, and was utterly useless. He was a worse bully than Snape, and obviously only here for the payment. Hartley never missed a chance to ridicule each student in his class, except Potter; Granger had left yesterday’s class in tears after he told her, “You have a memory of an elephant, Granger. Unfortunately you don’t quite live up to their beauty.” Nobody had even chuckled at the comment, and Draco was sure Weasley would have hexed the professor but the bell had rung.
Draco could not believe that he said all of those nasty, horrible things to Harry; he knew how it would affect him, but he could not seem to stop himself. Merlin, he was an awful human and he deserved to be expelled followed by being thrown into Azkaban. There was no way he could apologize enough for that horrendous blow up. Suddenly he was hit in the arm, and looked over to Pansy who was glaring at him furiously.
“That’s another reason you shouldn’t, whether you like it or not, the Wizarding World needs you.”
Ron debated what to say, because Hermione was right, Mom couldn’t see the bloody mess up in Harry’s bed. However, she cared for Harry as much as she cared for him and his siblings.
Dumbledore reveals the secret he should have never needed to reveal, and makes everyone angry.
“Yes. Forgive me, but why do you have an English accent?” The man laughed and a face was starting to form around the edges of Harry’s memory.
Warning:Thoughts of suicide.
Harry looked over to James and shrugged.
“Due to this new policy of inter-house unity, none of you will be sharing a room with someone from your house. If I learn that any of you have vandalized someone else’s trunk or possessions, I assure you, you will be expelled. There are ten rooms, meaning three to a room; five rooms in the female’s wing and five rooms in the male’s wing. Each room has a small separate bathroom attached that you have to share with your roommates, so be conscious of time. Your trunk has already been placed in your room, and there will be no moving. The room assignments are:
“What did you mean with ‘Not again’? Has he already done this, and you didn’t tell me?” Ron tried to keep the anger out of his voice, but couldn’t. Hermione flinched at his tone, but slowly nodded.
Dumbledore nodded. “Yes.” Severus cursed, and spun around.
Now it’s time to sort into the houses
“Listening in on private conversations, Weasley?”
“Excellent, but I have a couple of people I want to ask tomorrow.” He beamed at Draco, and Draco realized why he was working himself until he was exhausted, just to make the man he loves happy. Harry pulled out his Transfiguration homework to work on it together with Draco, and Draco was able to push the disappointment of the essay to the back of his mind.
They continued on with the paperwork for another couple of hours, before the floo roared to life. Draco stepped out of the fire, and grinned brightly.
“That’s ridiculous!” said a Hufflepuff girl next to him.
James grinned and shook Draco’s offered hand, “James, please; nice to meet you. This is my wife Lily, my oldest daughter Alice who just turned 17, my son Sirius who is 14, and my youngest daughter Minerva who is 11.”
“So you went searching for danger?”
The third room will be occupied by Longbottom, Malfoy, and Hopkins.
Draco shook his head to dislodge the bitter thoughts, and reached for another piece of fruit. The morning owls hadn’t come yet, which was strange. He did not mention it to his mother, though, because she was very angry that every piece of mail in and out of the manor was being read. It was because both of them were on probation, and the ministry was worried that they were talking to some of the escaped Death Eaters. His mother thought it was a waste of time and resources, and resented the invasion of privacy.
James’ raised his eyebrow then laughed, “Not bloody likely.”
Harry and Draco become friends.
Harry was trying to process everything Snape had told him, but shook his head in response to the question about the bank card. Snape sighed and flicked his wand, and a small rectangle flew at Snape. “This is mine, I will be reimbursed by the Hogwarts fund. I would recommend looking into it, but should you pay with your own funds, you will be reimbursed for up to three sessions a week. It is a fund I set up new this year, and you will not be the first taking advantage, Potter. See how many sessions a week you need, and then I will take down the Apparition Wards for my office only at those times. First you will go with me since you do not know where to go. Ready?”
Harry was stunned by Snape’s offer. He realized that he wanted to accept the offer, but was wondering if he would be rushing such a big decision. “What are the requirements?”
The table broke out into laughter at the conclusion of Blaise’s story, but Harry had to force his laughter. It had been difficult seeing his parents, and now knowing that he would be seeing quite a bit of them throughout the term. It was downright torturous to know that he would be teaching his siblings this term, while they would never know of him as anything other than their professor.
“You’re not tired, mate, you’re exhausted. You’re always studying when you should be sleeping and eating, and it’s not healthy. You need to sleep, eat, and take a break.” Draco ignored Neville and started to turn back to his reading. “Look, Draco, I don’t want to impose, but people are worried about you. I mean after you forgot about Pansy’s birthday yesterday-”
“That’s obvious. It will be worse for them to learn what happened. Are you or Snape telling them about it?”
Care of Magical Creatures
(See the end of the chapter for
“It was your responsibility to go to the Prefects’ Carriage. You need to go find Ida Rogers to learn your assignments for the day as well as your patrolling schedule.”
“Congratulations are in order to you as well then. However, that is not the reason I asked for this meeting.” Harry nodded and bit back his excitement; it left anxiousness in its place. Severus continued, “Minerva informed me that she would be taking a sabbatical this year, as will Madame Pomfrey. I know Madame Pomfrey is asking Draco to fill in her position for the year.” Harry nodded, she had asked Draco a few days ago; he was on the fence at the moment, but Harry knew he wanted to take it. “I need someone to fill in as the Head of Gryffindor House for the year, which I intended to ask you to do the day Minerva informed me of the sabbatical. However, now I am also going to extend the offer of filling in for the Deputy Headmaster position to you.”
“Waiting, I believe. I haven’t seen anyone else come down.” Harry settled into the chair beside Draco and took out his Defense Against the Dark Arts homework. Around twenty minutes later almost all of their group had joined them. They were just waiting for Hermione, and possibly Ron who usually joined her now, when Blaise looked at them in amusement.
Zabini sounded exasperated, but that was probably due to his inability to charm Granger; he had always been able to charm any girl or boy he wished in the past. Draco had not been making progress in talking to Thomas, the Gryffindor boy he had thought would be easiest to overcome their rivalry; the boy just sneered at him each time Draco walked towards him.
The next day Draco sat beside Harry in their Defense Against the Dark Arts class. Hartley was being as nasty as usual, but Draco had become used to the cutting remarks and ignored them. He often thought this is what any house other than Slytherin felt in Snape’s class, but Harry had assured him that Hartley was nastier than Snape. Before the bell rang, Hartley handed back essays from the weekend; when Draco received his, he felt the air rush out of his lungs.
He answered the other questions and helped Ida with her
“Weasley doesn’t know.”
“Well, that sums up my sessions with the fourth and second years yesterday. See you in a bit, Harry?”
“What’s going on?” Harry asked with one foot in the hallway, and one foot out.
“That is good news as I would not have found a suitable replacement for Minerva in the short amount of time you would have given me if you had declined.”
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“What shouldn’t I do, Malfoy?” Harry’s voice still sounded like it was barely used. Draco realized that Potter didn’t know that the Slytherins were aware of his suicidal tendencies, and wondered if he should pretend or not.
“Or I could just learn what I need to do at the Welcome Feast.”
Sirius beamed, and Harry hoped the kid did not behave like a mixture of Sirius Black and James Potter. He had heard horror stories from Minerva, Pomona, and Filius about the Marauders.
Also, all of the N.E.W.T.S. and O.W.L.S. from last year were marked unqualified since Hogwarts was not teaching much last year. You will need as many N.E.W.T.S. as possible to find a job in the magical world, with your background, so I would advise you to go and ignore Slughorn and the rest of the haters. Prove you belong.
“Mr. Harry, sir? My friend said you were the one who fought in a war last year, is he right?” Harry blinked at this tiny blonde girl before slowly nodding. “Oh good, I thought he tricked me again. My parents don’t have magic, so I don’t really know a lot of things and the kids keep making fun of me for it.” She looked down at her shoes with tears in her eyes, but then took a calming breath. “Professor Hartley makes fun of me more than the rest of the class too, so I’m scared to ask him for help. So I thought you might be able to help me, because I’m having a really hard time understanding werewolf bites, and it’s only the first thing we’ve learnt. Can you help me, please?”
He looked up as he heard someone call his name and sent his boyfriend a small smile trying desperately to hide the stress he was feeling. Harry smiled back and looked around the common room for anyone else before leaning down to kiss Draco. They hadn’t wanted to tell anyone about their relationship yet due to the tense atmosphere still surrounding the Slytherins.
You are all here to learn
“Dear Mr. Potter, It is our pleasure to inform you that you have been approved to come to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for an optional “8th” year, as last year’s studies were interrupted. We strive to give everyone the opportunity to receive their N.E.W.T.S. after actually being taught for a school year with no interruptions or dark intentions. We understand if you are hesitant to come back, but rest assured that every precaution has been put in place to make the school safe. We have also rebuilt the castle, with some adjustments, since part of the castle was damaged in the battle. Please owl us back whether you would like to attend by no later than July 31st, so we can appropriately prepare for the additional year of students. Enclosed is a list of your supplies.”
Harry looked thoughtful instead of hurt, and Draco let out a silent sigh of relief. He had been afraid the statement would hurt Harry or curb his excitement. Draco noticed Granger staring at the pair of them and tried to ignore her. After a minute Harry nodded slowly.
Because he barely pays attention to anyone other than his circle, and he was ashamed to realize that. “I guess I’ve always been wrapped up in my own world, sorry about that.”
Harry started reading the files, and saw that all of the CV’s were very impressive. Was Severus just better at finding the impressive witches and wizards, or did he have the better pile to begin with? Harry decided it was probably the latter, and read each applicant’s file three times.
“Yes, you have, but I’ve been letting you. I wished you would have trusted me sooner, though.”
“What did you do, Waller?” Severus asked harshly.
“Maybe you could be distracted while you walk in, that could keep the focus off the bad memories.”
It’s been a year now
“Alright there, mate?”
“Draco, why didn’t you tell me that I was asking for too much of your time?”
“I’m sorry for being such a rubbish friend. I know you would rather be studying than following me, or talking to me right now.”
“That’s not saying anything, darling. I’m surprised he realizes that he is dating Hermione.” The rest of the group chuckled.
“Are you coming to the Burrow tomorrow for a Christmas dinner, Harry?”
“Professor Potter?”
For the remainder of the session Harry would deflect one of Mira’s questions with a question about her personal life, which she would answer then repeat her question. Harry felt smugly satisfied when the woman seemed relieved that the session was over, but then listened to her say that she wanted to meet with him once a week for now. Harry paid for the session and scheduled the appointment with the receptionist who seemed a little too interested in Snape. Then he apparated back to Snape’s office, leaving a note with the next time and date for his session and the bank card.
“How do you know about that?”
“I’m the temporary Transfiguration Professor, Professor Waller. I would watch the attitude, or I’ll take points as well. You’re in Gryffindor, correct?”
“Has James accepted the position yet?”
“Yes, well, I’ll make this quick. Filch has asked me to remind you that the Forbidden Forest is off to limits, as well as any products from the Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes shop as well as over 400 other different items. Magic is not allowed in the corridors, which most of you dunderheads would do well to remember. If any member of the staff or Prefects see you hex another student, regardless of house, it will be an automatic 10 point reduction and detention. Eighth years stay behind, but the rest of you, find your dormitory.”
“Is it alright for me to kiss you?”
Severus had changed since Harry first saw him, nearly thirteen years ago; for one his hair was no longer constantly greasy, his eyes calmer, and his teeth no longer yellow. Harry knew it was because Severus was trying to focus on his appearance more for his wife, Hillary; Severus and Hillary met when she worked as Dr. Mira Johnson’s receptionist, a Squib psychologist that Severus and Harry had both seen after the war. The couple had a three year old boy, who was fun to be around; after babysitting the kid, Marcus, a few times, Harry and Draco decided to start working on building a family.
“Zacharias asked me to pass along his apology for cursing you at Sally’s funeral a month ago. He and Sally were twins, sorted into different houses; he basically disowned her for not being in Hufflepuff. When he discovered that Sally had fought and died in the battle that he ran away from, he attacked pretty much anyone who spoke to him; it wasn’t the best way for him to deal with his grief, but the prick is finally starting to become a better person. I wasn’t going to tell you because I was angry with you, so don’t make me regret it Potter.”
“As fascinating as this conversation is,” oh Draco whipped out his Sahara Desert dry voice, “we should talk about upcoming scheduling and tutors for the third years.”
“Oh, Harry,” he heard Hermione say with despair in her voice, “I was afraid I would find you like this. I thought you were going to a Mind Healer today, what happened?”
The fourth room will be occupied by Bones, Turpin, and Greengrass.
“Oh shut it, you absolute fool! Who’s he going to strike for? The person attached to his hip is Harry Potter.” This came from Terry Boot, but he had not moved from his chair in the corner of the room. The members of the room had started murmuring about Boot’s comment. A few looked disgusted but most nodded in agreement.
“I can help with Transfiguration, and pick up any other session that needs a tutor in case of an emergency.”
James nodded and Harry walked away quickly. He found Filius and started trying to figure out a time for the next charms-breaking meeting. He distracted himself with various things throughout the rest of the journey until he needed to greet the huge group of nervous first years, and the Waller’s, at the castle’s doors. He tried his best to emulate Minerva, but he thought that he fell slightly below her level of excellence.
“If I can’t find anyone else, would you be able to cover it Draco?” There it was.
“It’s been working so far. Also we should really start pushing for inter-house unity.” Harry had interjected, and Zabini raised his eyebrows and scoffed. The war had caused the Slytherin to stop being as arrogant and smug, but he still had traits that made him come across as an arsehole. Harry shot an angry look at Zabini, and the boy raised his hands instead of retaliating.
Harry walked over and sat next to Ron; Ron expressed how much he had missed Harry the last few weeks, and Harry asked how Auror training was going. They chatted for a bit, until other people started trying to get Harry’s attention. Throughout the dinner, Harry decided that Ginny, George, and Percy were definitely ignoring him, but he couldn’t dwell on it too much because everyone else was trying to grab his attention.
“Bloody hell, it’s already time to decide where we’re staying for the holiday. Where will you be, Harry?”
James and Lily looked at each other and then nodded. Severus stood up with Lily, James, and Harry following suit. They walked outside, and James pulled out a smoke. Lily softly admonished him when he lit the cigarette, so James put it out with a shrug and a grin. Severus stared at the interaction with an odd expression before clearing his throat.
“Yes, it’s a pleasure to meet you. Severus and I are over here.”
“It’s not against the rules to form a study group,” Draco said with some heat behind his words. Harry thought it was probably because he was afraid of being in trouble due to his probation.
Harry snorted, and highly doubted that even the threat of Azkaban would keep Snape from being a bully or showing favoritism. However, Harry thought it would be a little fun to watch and see the year play out.
“He’s just waiting until it’s time to strike!” Hopkins again.
“Are we not friends?”
Ron wondered if they needed more than the one vial of blood replenishing potion, and then panicked about how they would get Harry to take it. However, he now heard Kreacher arguing with someone down the stairs, and his own mom’s voice responding. His mom would know how to help, but he also didn’t know how she would feel about this. Glancing at Hermione, she shook her head.
Draco looked at Zabini to see if the wizard was joking, but he looked incredibly serious. Pansy shared looks with both of them. Draco thought back and realized that Potter was acting incredibly strange, but Draco would not have attributed it to what Zabini was implying.
“Nothing! That name just seemed familiar.”
He left the group to go back into the Great Hall until Severus gave him the signal to bring them in. He set the Sorting Hat on the stool and watched as it opened its mouth.
“Ah. Well, I’ll see you at the Feast, then.”
Dumbledore looked off to the distance, and had an angry look on his face. He schooled it back into the mournful expression, and continued his story.
He raised his wand and started saying his curse, when someone jerked his arm back. The boy looked behind him and his face lost all colour, and the owner of the hand stepped into view. It was Harry Potter; he watched Potter anxiously as the Golden Boy probably just wanted to hex the compartment himself, and they definitely could not retaliate against the Saviour of the Wizarding World.
Harry braves the Great Hall.
“Potter, I will inform you now that I am not as tolerant as my predecessor, and I will not bow to your whim because you got lucky. Any rule breaking, any at all, and you will be expelled. That goes for your friends as well. Do you understand?” Snape hissed this all at Harry, but looked at Hermione and Ron when he mentioned them.
“I believe that instructions to go to the Prefects’ Carriage today were included with your badge.”
The sorting hat song is rough, so anyone who has suggestions for it, please let me know.
Harry gains a new friend.
“What a tragic way to become famous. Who did you live with for your childhood then?”
Kreacher appeared in front of him and Hermione, while glaring at them. “Why is you two here? Master Harry hasn’t come back yet.” Then he stopped talking and seemed to feel something shift in the air. Ron didn’t pay attention to the elf, too busy looking around the foyer for blood. “Master Harry has returned, and has put himself in danger again.” Ron looked at the elf, and watched Hermione lose all of the color in her face. Following her, they ran to the room that Harry now occupied.
“Good luck out there, Harry.”
One last thing, you will all be required to add Muggle Studies to your coursework, as will the rest of the school; this a requirement from the Ministry of Magic. Your classes will only be taken with your year as well, you will not be joining the seventh years.”
Harry nodded his head slightly, and Hermione let out another small shriek and hugged him. Then she started talking about getting food, and walked out of the room. Harry felt slightly bad that Hermione was excited about him joining her, when he was only doing it to make it easier to kill himself. Hermione walked back in with the food and an anxious look on her face.
“Why am I here?”
As secrets emerge that were nearly erased
“I don’t want my grade to “be fine”, I want it to be the best! Sorry if you don’t understand having pride in your schoolwork, Longbottom!” Draco seethed at the boy, before taking a look at his face which was concerned instead of angry, making Draco feel horrible. “Sorry, Neville, I didn't mean to snap. I’m just stressed and tired.”
Potter was staring at Draco like he was the most fascinating thing in the room. Then he cleared his throat and looked away. Without looking at Draco, Potter said, “Luna said you saved her life while she was imprisoned at Malfoy Manour, but wouldn’t say how.” He was obviously prompting, and Draco decided to tell him.
“Right here, from 8-9 PM on Mondays and Fridays. As it is 7:50 AM on a Thursday, I am doing my homework, not socializing.” After he said this, he bent back over his parchment. Harry cocked his head and saw he was proof-reading the essay Hartley had assigned to be turned in today. Harry’s expression turned dark at the thought of Hartley; the man was crueler than Snape  and a worse teacher than Umbridge. He had made Hermione cry twice already: once when he said she was less attractive than an elephant and the other time when he failed her for her answers being “too close to the book’s answer, my God have an original thought, Granger.” Harry saw that Malfoy had mixed up the features on the different types of trolls they were re-visiting, due to Hartley’s fear of them all being incomptent.
“Mum, you know he wouldn’t like that. St. Mungo’s doesn’t respect his healer/patient confidentiality, and the Daily Prophet would make it into a Death Eater attack. Hermione healed us just fine when we were hunting Horcruxes, he’ll be fine.”
“It’s a letter from Hogwarts for you. I got one earlier today, which is why I came over. Would you like me to read it to you?” Hermione didn’t wait for his answer and cleared her throat to read,
“Brilliant! I hate this bloody disguise.”
Harry chuckled with him, slightly uncomfortable as this was his second time alone face-to-face with his father. Harry was about to make an excuse to leave, but James beat him to talking.
Harry Potter walked to the gates of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and looked up at the castle. He had just finished his fifth year of teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts a week prior, and was still loving being a professor. He was confused, and slightly anxious, as to why Headmaster Snape wanted to have a meeting with him just one week after the term ended, but Harry knew Severus wouldn’t tell him until he was ready. Harry walked up to the Headmaster’s office and knocked; the door opened immediately revealing Severus sitting at his desk.
He felt a hand on his back and knew he didn’t deserve the comfort. He stood up quickly and almost fell back down from the sudden lightheadedness. It wasn’t wise to apparate when he was feeling so emotional, but Harry didn’t care. In fact, he hoped he splinched himself; he deserved every bit of pain the world had to give him. He apparated to number 12 Grimmauld Place and ran up to his bedroom.
James looked embarrassed, “Yeah…”
“Well, were you the only one who could protect “what was at risk”?”
“Well the git was hexing second years because of their house. There was no reason for that. If it had been fourth years or above, well who cares, they could defend themselves.” Longbottom looked slightly upset at that sentiment, but didn’t respond. Draco heard a female voice softly say, “Oh, Ronald.” Potter looked back into the compartment, then walked away. Longbottom watched Potter leave, and Draco heard a chorus asking where Potter was going. Longbottom looked back at the Slytherins and kindly said to the girl who had ran into the compartment, “Do you want me to walk you back to your friends? I’m heading for the lunch trolley, so it would be no bother.”
“Well, that is a surprise, Draco. What shall you do?”
I honestly could not think of a name for this chapter, so if anybody has a different name that would be better, please tell me. Thanks for reading!
"What's wrong?" Harry asked, his brows drawing together to form a line. He tilted his head, confused. He looked around, head turning left and right, up and down, as if the answer to his questions were hiding somewhere in the room, playing hide and seek with him. Draco smirked. Harry looked like a lost puppy.
Breathe.
Harry’s tongue slid into Draco’s mouth, plunging into the depths of his wet cavern. Their tongues rolled together as they fought for dominance before Harry won the short battle, his tongue eagerly tasting every nook and cranny of Draco’s mouth, sending sparks up and down Draco’s spine and wild tremors along his nerves.
His heart was starting to ache, his chest throbbing and his lungs burning as he continued gasping for breath, begging for just a mouthful of fresh air, a breath of relief, but unable to grasp it.
Living with Voldemort and his Father had taught Draco the importance of heightened senses, the ability to sense and predict incoming danger or threats. The creak of an old floorboard, the slight shift in posture, the new scratch on the table. All were clues hinting towards an incoming threat, a looming danger. He scanned the room once more.
Harry had been thankful for avoiding a world war 3, especially after hearing what he had fondly dubbed, ‘break up horror stories, myths and tales 101’, from close friends in Hogwarts. He and his companions had laughed, poked at and made jokes out of those stories, but he sure as heck wasn’t alright when he and Ginny broke up.
Draco moved over to the waiting area. He felt the pit inside him grow, his stomach twisting in knots as heat spread up his back. 'Look how badly you just messed up,' he thought to himself. 'You are incapable of being a better person.'
He had wanted to name the kitten after its chaotic and destructive nature, blizzard, but had decided against it, standing in favour of the name snowball, just so he could make a pun whenever he said its name. He couldn’t resist the toebeans, or the killer humor. Thus, the angry ball of fluff was christened Sir. Blizzard SnowBall The First, or Snowpaw for short.
“Merlin, Potter. I know I’m handsome but this attention is a little bit much, don’t you think?” Draco scoffed, breaking the awkward silence. He emerged from his protective cocoon, reaching out to grab the red porcelain plate his macaroons were on, swiping his index finger all around the plate, catching all the loose bits of sugar, before proceeding to unceremoniously stick his finger in his mouth. Draco looked up, only to see Harry staring at him. Draco blushed in embarrassment, his cheeks hot with a rosy blush painted on his face, making his lily-white skin stand out.
She had a cryptic smile on her face as she walked into the area, much like the one the late headmaster of Hogwarts had. She looked at Harry and Draco, and her eyes widened in what seemed to be realisation. She pushed her half-moon glasses up her nose, her caterpillar-like eyebrows shooting up her face.
Draco stopped struggling under the pile of pillows at once, and it wasn’t long before he appeared from underneath the landslide of red, popping out of the messy pile like gnome in the ‘whack-a-gnome’ game. Much to Draco’s annoyance, his once neat mini ponytail was now a hot mess.
“We weren't flirting!” Harry sputtered after a few minutes of awkward silence, finally emerging from his cave of shame, trying to justify himself in a futile attempt to prove his innocence to no one in particular.
“Oh dear,” she said, pushing her steel-rimmed glasses up her nose for a closer look and squinting her eyes, causing the wrinkles on her haggard face to deepen, causing her to look older than her actual age. “It seems like one of those accursed 'brothers' have come knocking at his door.”
“But you didn’t,” he replied, giving him a toothy smile. Smooth git. Harry rolled his eyes so hard he thought they may pop out of their sockets. Lance grabbed a cupcake carrier from below the counter, passing it to Harry.
Though Harry and Ginny had broken up on peaceful, neutral terms, she had decided to move out, choosing to move back into the Burrow as she sought out another apartment someplace else in London.
The aftermath of the war was a total rush, and he couldn’t recall what transpired. The immediate storming of Malfoy mansion, the quick arrest of the death eaters, the trial of his parents, then his. It had been a total rush of events. With no one to rely on, his mental state had quickly broken down. The entire time had been a period of disassociation and pain.
Not 20 minutes had passed when Ginny had startled awake from another nightmare, but this time without Harry by her side. Mrs Rose had been serving customers when she noticed Ginny shivering, her face drained of blood, her lips pale. She had quickly called Harry over, and with both their efforts in reassuring Ginny and encouraging her, paired with a dash of classic humour, they had effectively calmed Ginny down in record time.
“Is it alright if you helped me package this, Potter?” Draco asked, referring to his mocha cupcake, sitting on a plate untouched.
No. It just doesn't get fixed. Lastly, you can't pump coffee into your bloodstream at home, magically or manually. By late morning, Draco had no machine, no coffee beans, and no caffeine.
“Try me.”
Harry blinked, very frazzled. His lips were still tingling from their kiss. He stared at Malfoy, holding his breath.
In the end, it was Draco who broke the kiss, letting out a soft whine, ending the moment. They were both gasping for air. The ice prince of Hogwarts looked ready to fall over, porcelain skin now a rosy shade despite the cold, his lips a cherry red and slightly swollen, the plump flesh now looking even more plush and kissable. He looked dishevelled. Harry suspected he was in a similar condition.
He didn’t like it very much, it felt uncomfortable.
“Harry! I just want to say... sorry,” he turned away and murmured, swallowing whatever remaining pride he had left and forcing out an apology, trying desperately to make it sound sincere. “That last two statements weren’t needed.”
"See you tomorrow, Potter,'' he cheered. Seeing that there were no cars, he hopped off the sidewalk and skipped across the zebra crossing. “My new coffee machine doesn’t arrive for the next few weeks or two,” he shouted from across the road. He lied. Draco didn’t understand why he did that.
Draco wanted to slap himself. He was here for caffeine and sugar, not to gawk at (admittingly) handsome boys! ‘Don’t screw this up,’ he thought to himself. ‘Stop being a useless burden to those around you, and try actually accomplishing something. And for Merlin’s sake, try being a decent being for once in your life.’
Harry’s hands were dangling awkwardly by his side as Harry tried figuring out what to do with them. In the heat of the moment, he decided to place them on Draco’s slim waist gently, careful to not startle him. He closed his eyes, savouring the moment. They were oblivious to the world around them, their lips latched onto each other’s as if someone had locked their lips together and had lost the key.
“Well, you did ask for it," Draco said, chuckling lightly to himself. Harry wasn't sure what Malfoy was planning to do but the suspense was terrifying. He unconsciously loosened his grip on Draco’s arm.
A blush spread across his face, reaching up to his ears, his cheeks like a blooming rose, slowly uncurling and spreading its petals to reveal a brilliant shade of red. He turned back, focusing his attention back on Draco.
'You’re still just a disappointment. A failure.' He was spiralling, down, down, down.
Draco's ears were already flushed red from before and were still stained red. Now that same brilliant shade of scarlet was not just spreading across his face, but also down his neck too, causing him to look like a ripening tomato, red tint staining his cheeks, ears and necks. His heart was once again pounding against his rib cage, but Draco suspected that it was for a very different reason as compared to before because this time, it was paired with butterflies in his stomach.
Harry watched Draco intently, observing him finish the last of his espresso shots before Draco smacked his lips, seemingly satisfied. It was as if he were expecting Draco to collapse and have a heart attack at any moment due to excess ungodly levels of caffeine in his system. Harry stared at him, his unwavering, steely gaze never leaving Draco, his olive eyes boring into Draco’s soul and sending chills down the poor boy's spine.
Secondly, life hacks don't work, regardless of time, size and experience. Turns out that using the darn demon-spawn of a machine as a sand bag for punching, and kicking, and hammering, and burning, and-
‘If I were her, I would avoid myself too,’ he thought. He had always been an obnoxious sheltered kid, overconfident and entitled, and in his opinion still was. ‘Just like how a leopard doesn't change it's spots easily, a dragon doesn't shed it's skin,’ He let out a weak self-deprecating chuckle at the irony behind that statement.
"Or what, Malfoy? Is your Father going to hear about this," he mocked. Malfoy rolled his eyes.
On that particular Tuesday morning, Ginny had woken up to an especially horrible nightmare screaming, before things quickly escalated into a full-blown panic attack. It had been the fourth night in a row this had been happening. It was only by the time that the sun bloomed on the horizon, golden petals stretching outwards into the rich blue, bathing London’s gothic architecture in warm golden light, did Harry finally manage to calm Ginny down.
“What note,” Harry asked, tilting his head to one side.
Despite having a full-time job that surrounded him with familiar faces and required him to interact with people for over 9 hours, Harry had been lonely, to say the least. A month into his job and Harry was miserable. After the breakup, Harry had no motivation to carry on on his daily routine, never putting much effort into anything, including making the effort to step out of the house to do physical activity or to simply buy take-out. The only food he ate was Mrs Rose’s espresso and an occasional mocha cupcake at best once or twice every 2 days.
By the time the end of the month rolled by, Harry had lost at least 8 pounds, his once sun-kissed honeyed skin now gaunt and pale, almost slightly translucent, his once luscious chocolate curls, soft to the touch, were now oily and droopy, hanging over his forehead. In that month alone, he had taken on a complete 360° transformation, from what seemed to be the cover model for teen vogue to an emo goth teenager going through a bad break out (or up) in the middle of puberty. It was a truly pathetic situation.
"The great Harry Potter worrying about me? Oh my,” he snarked, dramatically placing a hand on his heart. “I’m so flattered beyond words, whatever shall I do?” He exaggeratedly batted his white eyelashes, his grey eyes looking at the ceiling.
It was only by chance did Draco hear of this coffee shop, accidentally overhearing a senior Slytherin from London talking about it to his friend when studying in Hogwarts Slytherin common room in first year. For some peculiar reason, that encounter (, though a slightly odd experience,) stuck with him through his years in Hogwarts, even after the great war.
“But really Harry, in all seriousness, who wears ripped jeans in the middle of winter?” He clarified with Harry, his face a picture of pure horror and slight disgust. Harry gave him a small nod, that meant ‘clearly only Draco’, not looking up. He held the end of a long ribbon in his mouth as he attempted to tie a bow around the box with the rest of the string.
For the next few weeks, Draco was obsessed. He had came here every morning for their heavenly espresso, laying stagnant at his seat reading yet another novel till late noon, completely absorbed. That was until the day his once-upon-a-time trusty coffee machine was delivered, and he no longer found the need to walk such long distances for his coffee. Until today.
“It’s alright, Draco. You're safe now, and doing an excellent job of getting through this. I am proud of you.” Draco didn’t respond, only letting out another weak whimper as Harry gently combed his fingers through his shoulder-length hair, slowly disentangling the stubborn knots in his white locks one by one before pulling it into a neat ponytail. He finished it off by using a spare rubber band on his wrist.
"Merlin. Really, Potter. For once in your life, can't you mind your own business," Draco snarked at him, giving him a weak, half-hearted shove.
"Look at me," Harry ordered more firmly this time around but in a softer tone. Draco complied. "Now Breathe," Harry spoke in a hushed tone exhaling lightly. "Just breathe, block everything out. Just focus on my voice," he said as calmly as possible. “Concentrate on your breathing, stay with me.” Malfoy did his best to do as Harry said. He could see that. Harry gently wiped away Malfoy's tears with his thumbs and the back of his hands.
That morning, business had been better than usual, numerous customers of all ages, regulars and new ones, coming in at regular intervals in large groups. It was one of those days that they needed extra help, and Mrs Rose had been one of the many heroic individuals to step up and tackle the job.
In that kiss, their chemistry combined into a blinding flame, bright and ever-burning. In that kiss, the emotions they poured out spoke volumes that transcended the works of great poets combined. In that kiss, they found the sweetness of passion, a million loving thoughts condensed into a single moment. In that kiss, they were their pure and vulnerable selves. In that kiss, they felt all was right. In that kiss, they were home.
‘I’m scared, I’m scared,’ he thought. Was no one coming to save him? He supposed he deserved it. ‘It hurts,’ was the only clear thought in his head. Everything was gradually fading out into a pale white colour, the static in his ear growing louder and louder as bit by bit, his surrounding gradually faded away.
He felt people’s eyes on him. They were staring at him. He felt suffocated. 'Clearly, something’s wrong with you,' they all said in unison. Some were laughing at him, some giving him looks of disgust. 'What gives you the right to change after all you've done!' They were all yelling at him.
“Well, you better hurry Harry because he looks like he’s going soon,” Lance stated. He was ignored.
Harry picked up Draco’s coat. He then slowly and carefully steered Draco, patiently navigating him through the store, weaving in and out of crowds of customers, barely avoiding multiple obstacles, to said sitting area hidden in a more secluded area at the back of the coffee shop. Draco was worryingly light and unnaturally out of it, silently following Harry though the cafe, though stumbling, tripping and almost falling over a few times. Harry was almost starting to miss the old Draco Malfoy back at Hogwarts who would throw insult after insult at him mercilessly.
He could feel his heartbeat, every pound in his chest, beating against his rib cage. The great pounding, the great pressure; every beat. It was all Draco could feel, every pump of his heart like a vigorous blow from a giant. It had started gently, every pump of his heart slow and steady in his chest, the tempo slow and steady, consistent like a metronome, each heartbeat like a harmless ripple caused by a minuscule pebble. It wasn’t long before said ripple spread out, distorting the images reflected on the smooth glass-like surface of a great lake, creating giant catastrophic waves that tore at his sanity. The horrible sensation kept coming at him, wave after wave after wave, wearing him down further and further in his weakest moments, like quartzite rocks by the seaside, until he was left as nothing.
Ah, Draco. Always so eloquent.
‘Useless dysfunctional bloke, always inconveniencing someone. Not even 15 minutes out of the house and you are already a burden? How pathetic.’ Draco could already hear his Father’s voice. ‘What a disgusting sign of weakness, a true Malfoy never depends on someone else.’ Despite that, Draco let Harry hug him for a few more seconds before Harry backed away. He held Draco’s hands in his. They were smooth but bony as if Draco had never worked a day in his life and were now cold and clammy, a stark contrast of his warm and calloused ones, permanently marked with burn marks and scars from his childhood.
“Draco, sweat heart, that amount of sugar and caffeine is going to kill you.” Draco gave him a sugary sweet smile.
Draco sunk deeper into the plush piece of furniture, wrapping himself tighter in the blanket. He hugged the red pillows closer to his chest, letting out a barely audible low rumbling sound from deep inside his throat that sounded suspiciously like a purr.
"I haven't talked to my father in quite a while Potter,” Draco admitted in a cool and even tone. "He's in prison, Potter," he stated matter of factly, rolling his eyes. "Now this is your last warning, let me go,” he said in a firm tone, his voice low and dangerous. Despite him emphasizing on the last three words, Harry, being the stubborn idiot he was, tightened his grip on Malfoy's arm instead. Draco stepped a little closer, closing the distance between him and Harry. He looked up and saw a tiny pin size snowflake land on Harry's nose. He watched as it melted a matter of seconds.
Malfoy cocked an eyebrow. He tried suppressing a wide grin but ultimately failed. He could tell from Harry’s prominent blush and lack of rejection that he most liked him back, or at least didn’t completely hate Draco. He had a chance. Draco grinned. Harry’s usually honey brown skin which bore much resemblance to that of smooth caramel, had a certain rosiness, borderline crimson to it.
It was an albino Persian kitten. The snowball of fur, unlike most cats, had icy blue eyes so tinted that they were almost a shade of grey, with tiny specs of bluebell and iceberg. It reminded Harry of an unpolished gem, a precious stone waiting to be uncovered. Harry thought it was gorgeous, that silvery shade of blue. It reminded him of a certain someone, but he couldn’t quite put his finger on it.
He still remembered that day he stood in court on trial for his crimes during the war. He still remembered Potter defending him. He still remembered that dumb bloke trying to become friends with him. Was he dumb or dense? Draco will never figure it out. How anyone wanted to be his friend back then, even now, was beyond him.
Harry's a little dense. ;-;
Breathe.
“Exactly,” Draco agreed with a nod, reaching out from under his pillow pile to snatch up a cherry and white tea flavoured macaroon, his hand quickly disappearing underneath it again.
He had then considered getting a Gryphon, having wanted one secretly since he had first laid his eyes on a picture of one in his first-year Hogwarts while Hermione was doing some of her ‘light reading’. The only reason he got involved in her reading session was because of the many moving pictures of different magical species, from gnomes to centaurs to unicorns. It was interesting. He, later on, had reasoned to himself that it would be too big to fit in his apartment. He was only half convinced that he shouldn’t get one.
Gone was the thin-faced, knobbly knees, and dare he say, nerd. Quidditch had done wonders to the boy who lived and had blessed him with sun-kissed skin and lean muscles Draco had a distinct absence of despite practising the same sport for far longer. He quickly decided that whatever god there was up there was unfair.
Pausing for a moment, he allowed time to pause for second. A miniscule smile smile, hardly noticeable to the unfamiliar eye, sneaked pass his iron wall defences, making it's way onto his cheeks and working is magic on the corners of his lips.
Harry blinked. Once, twice, three times, before he hopped into action, wincing slightly at the sudden movement. Harry whacked Lance on the head as hard as he could and grabbed the package, walking swiftly around the counter to chase after Draco, almost dropping the cupcake the third time in the process.
Harry’s furrowed his eyebrows, the edge of his thinly pressed lips pointing downwards, heavy with worry. Although Draco’s breathing was less erratic than before, he wasn’t looking much better than he was before Harry came. His eyes had glazed over, and he had on his face a blank, almost dead expression. He looked dazed as if he was there physically but was not mentally. ‘Is he disassociating? Maybe he's going through depersonalization or derealization.’ Whatever the case was, the concerned crowd of patrons slowly gathering around them and the worried stares of students were starting to become a huge problem.
‘And why would he be? Why would anyone care?’ Draco asked himself. He watched Harry add an extra-large mocha cupcake to his order, grumbling to himself the entire time. He awkwardly stood behind the corner, fiddling with the hem of his jacket. 'This is too awkward... I should strike up a conversation,' he thought to himself. He pursed his lips thoughtfully. 'I should ask him about his job.'
He led Draco to the biggest couch in the sitting area and lowered him into the fluffy mess of pillows and blankets. He took the nearest item, a knitted blanket, and wrapped Draco in it before grabbing some red throw pillows and giving it to him to hug. He looked like a messy lopsided blanket burrito.
Harry buried his face in a throw pillow he grabbed from beside him and Draco disappeared into his castle of pillows and blankets. Draco thought he heard a muffled scream, borderline shriek.
That betrayal hurt. Not only had he lost half a portion of coffee beans to that satanic hell-spawn of a machine, but he now also had to find some other way to get his daily dose of caffeine. He had almost broke down in tears.
Harry had leaned in so close that Draco could feel his breath tickling his skin, the smell of his cologne invading his nose, causing Draco to let out a small sneeze, breaking the magic like trance he was under. He wiped his nose with the back of his hand, clearly irritated. He frowned, though he suspected it looked more like a pout. He stuck his bottom lip out at that thought.
It was the middle of winter, and London was freezing. Feeling like a frozen turkey, a lone Draco Malfoy stepped into the toasty warm coffee shop, his five senses immediately assaulted by an indulgent array of feelings. He took a deep breath, immersing himself in the familiar bittersweet scent of roasting coffee strong in the lively atmosphere, sighing in relief as he felt the bitter chill of winter leave him.
“I’m going to hug you now.” Gently as he could, so as not to startle him, Harry slowly wrapped his arms around Malfoy as if he were a wounded baby animal, fragile and small. He envelops Draco in warmth, giving birth to a sense of safety to Draco. ‘False security, whispered the voice into Draco’s ear once more.
Draco had decided to move out from Malfoy Manor in the second half of that same year. It had reminded him of too many traumatic childhood memories. The dungeon, the hallways, the drawing-room. Too many deaths, too many reminders. In addition to that, there was his poor mother.
“Did you not see the note I left on the table?”
“Here’s your receipt, ” Harry said, before turning to walk off. ‘Apologise useless bloke!’ Draco thought to himself. ‘What are you waiting for?’
“Shoo, shoo, hurry along. ‘arry, what’s goin’ on?” asked a familiar voice, soft and barely audible over the hushed whispers of onlookers, heavy with worry. It belonged to Harry’s boss and one of the two owners of Briar Rose, Mrs Rose. She had pushed her way through the crowd and was now helping disperse it with the help of her trusty walking stick.
He quickly shook the snow and ice off himself, brushing his hair back before entering the shop. Briar Rose was a quaint around-the-corner coffee shop, ran by a sweet muggle-born couple, both a ripe age of 80.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry looked completely unaffected. He rolled his eyes, unimpressed, and got up. Draco would never admit it but he thought that it made Potter look exceptionally dashing. He must have been really out of it. That was until he heard Potter murmur, “Drama queen,” under his breath. Draco made a face of outrage, letting out a soft gasp.
“Perhaps, someone more than a friend?” Lance wiggled his eyebrows suggestively. Harry blushed red, feeling all the blood in his body rush to his head. He choked on his saliva before his arm accidentally hit the plate the cupcake was on, causing him to almost drop Draco’s order again. He quickly caught the plate before it toppled over off the edge of the countertop.
Draco was so lightheaded that he was moments away from falling over.
That was until he spotted a snowy white one that reminded him of the late Hedwig. He immediately blew off the idea, disgusted at himself. He didn’t like the thought of another owl replacing his dear friend. He almost slapped himself for even considering it. Someday he would get an owl, but today wasn’t the day.
‘Coward, traitor.’ He hunched over as the dizziness got worse and worse as the seconds ticked by.
‘Like a rose.’ Harry thought to himself. It was the blush of roses, the peak of champagne pink. The colour infused cheeks dimpled with a blossoming smile, much like a sunflower blooming in the golden mid-summer sun.
The kiss felt like a warm summer breeze in the middle of a winter blizzard. It was as if they were opening their soul to each other, sharing their deepest secrets and darkest memories, their scars and tribulations, their wins and losses. It felt like they were giving up control to each other, yet they were so much in control at the same time. It felt like they were levitating, yet they had never felt more grounded in their lives. The kiss was like a potion of some sort, an aphrodisiac even, mixed with a butterfly effect. When their lips connected it felt like a thousand and one fireworks were bursting inside them like they could see, feel and touch every colour of the rainbow.
Malfoy nodded slightly after a small delay. He was still looking quite out of it, he’s once cherry-red face now ashen and pallid. Under the warm candlelight, Draco looked tired and worn out, like a washed-out muggle photo from the 18th century.
It was a small cosy space by a miniature fireplace, well hidden from the line of sight of customers. It was somewhat embellished with monochromatic colours, much like the rest of the store, the only difference being the liberal use of the colour red.
Draco was on the edge. Even though he was wrapped up in a warm knitted blanket and by a warm fireplace, had drank his daily cup of coffee and his much-needed dose of sugar-based energy, Draco was uncomfortable. The sugar and caffeine humming through his system was making him feel high and restless, causing him to start twitching, his finger already tapping on the mug and his legs bouncing unintentionally. He was like a tightly wounded rubber band on the verge of snapping, a deadly cocktail of toxic PTSD, anxiety, depression, sugar and caffeine.
“Goddammit,” he cursed himself in a low voice. 'You’re in public for goodness sake,' he thought to himself. 'Pull yourself together’. He stumbled to the corner of the waiting area, balancing himself on the wall. He closed his eyes, a futile attempt to blink away the white and back spots dancing a merry tango across his vision.
Harry gently pulled Draco closer, deepening the kiss. His tongue gingerly prodded Draco’s soft bottom lip, politely asking for entry. As his heart pounded in his chest, Draco complied, opening his mouth slightly. He felt Harry’s tongue prod at his lips, coaxing them open further.
“God forbid these two ever meet each other,” Harry murmured to himself under his breath.
Thank you for staying through the mini ficlet, I'm glad and grateful that you made it owo
"I don't know what you're talking about." Draco crossed his arms, his face cold and impassive.
"It's just," Harry paused. He pursed his lips, contemplating what to say, choosing his next few words wisely. "I think I might be able to help," Harry suggested to him. Draco snapped frowning. Instead, his brows were knitted together in confusion and distrust. He brought his feet up onto the couch and curled into himself further. He glared at Potter, his eyes narrowed in apprehension and suspicion.
On the rare occasion that they were so understaffed that they had to assign Harry to fold boxes (God forbid!), Harry’s boxes were either crumpled, smashed, wet, missing a chunk or burnt. Lance didn’t want to know how a water-resistant box could get wet, nor how Harry could have burnt the box despite standing behind the counter the entire time, nowhere near any flammable material, the stove or a lighter.
“‘Ope I ain’ interruptin’ anythin’,” said an old hoarse voice. Draco whipped his head around, only to see a woman looking ancient enough to be his great grandmother hobbling towards them with the help of a walking stick, yet still managing to balance a wooden tray with Draco’s order on one hand.
The sun rose from behind the horizon, dying the sky with a thousand different shades of orange and pink, peach and magenta, amber and rose, the splatters painting the sky like an artists’ palette. Draco spread his arms as he balanced on the railing of the fire escape, like a bird about to take off. Draco looked up to admire the  sky, enamoured with it's beauty. He then looked down, only to see his wrist coloured crimson, his shirt stained red.
Although his parents had left him more than enough to live the rest of his life not lifting a finger to work, Harry had decided to take up the offer. Reason being he had been lonely at home with no one to talk to, all his friends busy with school, work or coping with trauma. Not wanting to be alone at home more than necessary, Harry had decided to be a full-timer at Briar Rose, at least until Auror training starts.
He didn’t notice the faint blush spreading across his cheeks, painting his face a rosy shade of pink.
Harry caught up with Draco, latching onto his arm. Draco spun around suddenly. His eyes widened in an almost comical way, as he was suddenly face to face with Harry, their noses almost touching, their breaths mingling together in the cold winter air. His lips were so close that if Draco were to move an inch-
Harry whacked him on his head again, harder as compared to before. Lance let out another injured yelp before giving him a pout. Harry merely rolled his eyes and focused on making another order. He poured a cup of coffee, this time sober enough to do so without burning himself.
Breathe.
Anxiety attacks were a regular unwanted guest at Grimmauld Place. Another familiar gate crasher was it’s 'older brother', Panic attack. During the four months that they had been living in the same apartment building, Harry had acquired much knowledge and experience associated with the two 'siblings'. Although it’s been a few months since he and Ginny had broken up and parted ways, Harry still had more than sufficient knowledge and experience to support someone in the middle of a panic or anxiety if they ever needed it. Harry was no professional therapist but it looked like the older of the two brothers had come crashing in, uninvited.
It had been almost a year after the great war had ended, yet it felt like yesterday that he had been in the mansion, on The Dar- Voldemort's side.
He felt faint. He just wanted to run away and hide in a corner so that he wouldn’t need to face the world.
From that day onwards his mother had never been the same, losing all sense of reality, often hallucinating things out of this world. She wasn't the dedicated mother she once was, that familiar warm smile long gone. And how Draco missed it. All that was left was the shadow of the once dignified women, a shell of a mother. It wasn’t long before Draco had decided to move out. He was too worn out, too tired. He simply couldn't stand the mere sight of the manor anymore, let alone be willing to stay in it. Too much had happened there, and he needed a break.
"Shh," he whispered as though Malfoy was but a child, "It's okay," he whispered. “You’re alright.” Draco's breathing began to properly slow as Harry continued to whisper calming words to him. His breathing was still fairly choppy but it was a lot better than it was before and he was no longer hiccupping badly or hyperventilating. How useless of him, inconveniencing someone yet again.
Another notable cat-like behaviour of Draco was how competitive he was when it came to house points, especially between Slytherin and Gryffindor. It was very much comparable to a cat’s aggressive territorial habits.
Somedays, Harry would see her holding small thin glass vials of colourful ‘fruit extract’. Others, he saw her waving her feather duster around in a ‘swish and flick’, although she always insisted when asked by Harry that she found it to be ‘the best way to clean’.
"Malfoy," Harry said pointedly, crossing his arms in annoyance and slight frustration.
“Ahh. Flirtin’ I see?” Causing Draco to choke on his saliva and Harry to flush red once more. They were sputtering, both at a complete loss for words. With that, she set Draco’s order on the coffee table, giving neither boy a quarter of a chance to explain himself before hobbling away.
“Really, Dixon.”
Draco seized the opportunity and yanked his arm away from Harry's grasp. Instead of running away as Harry expected him to, Draco stepped closer, closing whatever remaining distance there was left between him and Harry left from before.
He never realised that he hadn’t corrected Lance.
Someday he would get himself an owl and a Gryphon, but today wasn’t the day.
It had been a typical Monday morning for Draco, one that could have gone much better, if he does say so himself. 'If only it wasn't for that sudden betrayal,' he murmured to himself with a slight roll in his eyes, as his words were lost in the thick gravy of different accents, drowned out by the mindless chatter of other customers.
"I didn't know the great Harry Potter enjoyed working for mud-bloods," he said, watching Harry write down his order onto a paper cup. Harry simply ignored him, though traces of annoyance could be seen in the slight dip of the corners of his mouth. Draco winced at Potter’s reaction. He hadn't meant for himself to sound so condescending. He attempted striking up a conversation again. “Are you proud of yourself, Potter?”
Draco had been avoiding Potter for the past few months, especially so after the war. The years must have been feeling especially generous towards the great saviour of the wizarding world. The once lanky 5’5” first year had bulked up and hit multiple growth spurts, allowing him to now tower over Draco’s 5' 9” at an impressive 6’1”.
"Are you determined to keep me in this store?" he teased, quietly letting out what sounded suspiciously like a giggle. Harry couldn't think of a good response but continued to hold onto Malfoy's arm. Draco pulled his arm back, trying to break out of Harry’s iron grip but to no avail. Draco gave him a mocking smile.
"Why not," Draco asked, his smile was making him very punchable. His eyes shone in a way only deep satisfaction can bring. "I did try to warn you," he noted.
And so, when Draco moved into the neighbourhood, he knew that he had to visit Briar rose and give its legendary coffee a shot. Once was more than enough for him to reach a conclusion. He loved it. The place, the ambience, the (admittingly) legendary coffee.
Harry made an impressed face. “Excellent guess, Dixon. Funny story, he is exactly how you described him as, poor fashion sense and all.”
He vaguely remembered Potter defending him in his trial, but that can’t be true. He hated Potter, and Potter hated him. It was a simple truth, a common fact. Thus, he concluded that, after a considerable amount of brainstorming, that he had either been hallucinating, dreaming, or under the influence of some potion.
It is done. My work is complete. I shall go sleep now.
“As if,” he replied, focused on packing the cupcake nicely.
"Hmm, not exactly the first snow but it’ll do,” Draco thought aloud, a barely audible murmur said underneath his breath. “Last chance Potter.” Harry cocked an eyebrow again, smirking in an overconfident way.
"Draco," he asked calmly, lowering his voice to barely above a whisper. "Can you hear me?" He gingerly placed two hands on each of Draco’s cheeks, cupping his face in between his calloused hands, pressing them together slightly.
“Truly, Potter.” He replied, watching Harry slowly fold the box into a 3D shape, his eyes narrowed in concentration. He was taking more time and effort than what he put in regularly when folding boxes and the box looked less lopsided than his usual standard.
“Anything else I can help you with dear customer?” Harry asked sarcastically. “If not, your total will be £14.49.” Draco tapped his credit card onto the terminal until he heard the silent ‘beep’ of the machine.
As much as he tried to not think about it. His thoughts kept wandering to Draco's lips on his. Harry touched his lips. He smiled faintly to himself at the thought of seeing Draco again tomorrow.
“Umm... Harry,” Lance asked, nudging him lightly. Harry ignored him in favour of putting the cupcake into the box. “Is the idiot you were talking about petite, about half a head shorter than the average short Londoner, and wearing a crumpled black turtleneck with ripped jeans?”
“Hmm. You should probably move im’ away, the crowd an’ stares ain’t doin’ tis’ poor boy any good,'' suggested Mrs Rose. “There’s a sittin’ area at the back, past tat’ potted plant over ther’. I’l get the boy his oder’ ‘arry. Tak’a break and take care of ya’ boyfriend now,” she said, giving him a mischievous wink. “And don’cha forget to include ‘hat pretty girlfriend of yours too.” With a twinkle in her eye, she hobbled away. “Youth these days, so active,” he heard her mutter.
"Potter if you don't let me go right now there will be severe consequences," Malfoy threatened coyly. Harry cocked an eyebrow.
"Well, that's not what I was expecting," Harry said exasperated.
The kitten was a tiny thing, about half a head smaller than the other kittens Harry had seen despite its voluminous shiny fur, though it's size certainly had not made any significant negative effect to its outstanding guts. Unlike most cats who flinched away or hissed when they saw Harry staring at them, this cat merely stared back, its eyes blinking slowly, impassively. It looked slightly unimpressed by him and his extreme enthusiasm.
It reminded him painfully of the Great Hall at Hogwarts.
‘Something was amiss’, Harry quickly decided. It was as if Draco were just a shadow of his former self, a hollow shell. Harry could tell he was wearing a mask but couldn’t for the life of him figure out why. He was so distracted that it was only when he looked up over the counter towards the waiting area did he realise Draco’s current state.
‘What was happening right now?’ Harry didn't know how to react as he stood there frozen. Malfoy's lips were soft against his own and Harry could smell the green tea shower gel he used in his hair along with the faint scent of coffee and macarons. He loved it.
“How about this charming young sir give me a sufficient reply to my question?” Harry suggested, quirking an eyebrow, completely unimpressed.
“Merlin, Potter. The note telling you that the cupcake was a thank you gift to you,” Draco explained with an exasperated sigh. Harry tilted his head even further. “For helping me,” Draco explained further. Harry made a confused sound, more puzzled than ever. “Get through the panic attack and for whatever heroic shenanigans you performed in Hogwarts.” Draco blushed and looked away, scrawling in embarrassment. Harry made a sound of understanding. He let out a deep humming sound from inside his chest.
By the time Draco had reached the doorstep of his backup coffee place, Briar Rose, the tip of his nose was numb and his lips had taken on a blueish hue, his teeth chattering like a pneumatic drill. The biting cold had chilled his fingers into clumsy numbness and spread painfully throughout his sneakers, leaving behind a light layer of freshly fallen snow that was now melting, soaking his icy white hair and causing it to become damp and limp like overcooked spaghetti.
“Mrs. Weasly would never recover from seeing this, especially knowing why it happened. Give me the potion and convince her not to come up.” Ron nodded and handed her the vial.
‘His animagus is definitely a cat,’ Harry thought to himself as he carefully observed Draco, putting the skills he learnt in Care of Magical Creatures to good use. He would know. After all, he owned an albino Persian kitten. He had adopted the silvery blue-eyed menace from the pet shelter just after he and Ginny had broken up.
‘Why can’t you be normal. Useless nobody, worthless burden.’ He was selfish, keeping Harry to himself once again. He scratched at the cuts underneath his sleeves, causing the bleeding on his upper arms to worsen, blood staining the bandages bright red. After all, the pain didn’t just help ground him. Him punishing himself also somewhat eased the guilt stewing inside of him, eating him alive, threatening to pull him down into a bottomless pit of despair. Draco watched impassively as part of the bandages sticking out from under his sleeve turned bright red, blood soaking the bandage through. Pathetic.
Draco moaned, loving the sweet taste of Harry, tasting traces of bitter espresso on his tongue. ‘A pretty little liar.’ He thought.
It has been an average day so far. He had finally fallen asleep at 1:47 in the morning, much earlier than usual, but it wasn’t long before he woke up at 3:04 due to yet another nightmare about the Great War. He had been back at Malfoy Manor. He remembered the corpses of his friends, his family. They clawed at the dirt and rubble with chipped nails, crawling out of their coffins of soil and mud, escaping the cruel clutch of mother earth. They were blaming him.
The sudden temperature drop from the night before was more apparent than ever, the roofs and streets dusted with a thin blanket of snow, as if someone had dusted powdered sugar all over the city. It looked like something out of a fantasy, though the fairy tail like scenery was quickly shattered by passing vehicles and passerby. Thankfully, the temperature had rizen, if not slightly, to just above the temperature for snow. The streets of London were wet and slippery, glistening with a layer of condensation, a tell tale sign of the frigid temperature and of the melting snow.
Draco screamed.
Harry stared. He had been staring at Draco for the past 20 minutes at least, his eyes never leaving him. He knew there was an unsaid line he was expected not to cross when observing people, having not just witnessed but having also gained personal experience in attracting unwanted attention and uncomfortable stares from others first hand, especially back in Hogwarts. Even now, he still received undesired stares, be it from muggles, witches or wizards. He didn’t like them very much.
By tea break, Harry was back in his apartment, a grumpy Persian kitten in a cage in one brutalised hand, a trunk of cat necessities and not-really-necessities in the other, and a sunshine worthy smile on his elated face.
Draco could feel himself hyperventilating. He was having yet another full-blown anxiety attack in public. Just when he thought he had one thing of his life under control.
Currently, Harry was toeing the line between creepy and stalkerish, the line between creepy and uncomfortable crossed a long time ago. He was testing dangerous waters, dangling his feet above sharks, balancing on said line, as if he were some deranged tightrope walker.
Unlike most Hogwart students, Draco had no holiday plans or friends, most of them being dead or in Azkaban. He'd be lying if he said he said he didn't blame himself. Some of them, like Pans- Parkinson, were outright avoiding him. He couldn’t blame her for her decision.
“Draco, can I touch your shoulder?” Harry asked, repeating his question when Draco didn’t respond, speaking at a slower pace as compared to before. Back when Harry was dating Ginny, she often startled awake next to him at ungodly hours such as in the middle of the night or wee hours of the morning due to nightmares. On better nights she woke up in tears. On worse nights, she woke up screaming.
“Shut up, Potter,” Draco said as he saw Harry open his mouth to presumably say something. Harry's mouth quickly snapped shut. “Not a word.” With that, he resumed his personal responsibility and supposed goal of polishing off Mrs Rose’s plate. It wasn’t long before Draco’s finger-licking quickly escalated to him licking the plate itself.
He breathed in and out slowly, trying to slow his beating heart. Seeing that there was no one queuing at the counter, he attempted making an order before quickly giving up after he almost burnt himself on the coffee machine, twice.
He had been left a weak shivering mess, drained and feeling emptier than usual, unable to go back to sleep.
"Hey Potter," he drew out the vowels. "Your glasses are crooked." He teased, a honey-sweet smile dripping off his face.  Harry jumped in surprise, flinching backwards. He straightened his glasses, composing himself. Harry looked at him, unimpressed. Lance continued to smile at him, his trademark toothy smile still hanging off his god-awful face. Harry wanted to slap it off into tomorrow and beyond. Both the smile, and his feelings.
"Well that's not my fault is it," Malfoy crossed his arms. Harry huffed, frustrated. The corner of Draco’s lips tweaked upwards, a smirk barely visible, but still there. He was enjoying Harry's suffering. He waited for a minute or two to bask in Harry’s embarrassment. He spun on his heels, turning around.
‘It won’t be long before you go under, you useless coward,’ whispered that horrible voice once again. No one was coming to save him. He was all alone. Again.
In that single moment, in that split second, Draco let down all his defences, as he simply stopped and paused to enjoy the simple pleasures in life. The warmth of the coffee shop seeped into his achy bones as the heat of the coffee shop enveloped him like a protective cocoon. He sighed, vaguely reminding him of how a mother intimately coddles her newborn, as he made a silent prayer for the moment to last for an eternity, an empty wish made to the stars.
This was rushed and written in two days. I hope it wasn't too bad .-.
Harry slowly reached his hand out to Draco, causing the boy to flinch backwards harshly and accidentally step on his coat. He slipped backwards and fell on the soft carpeted floor with a muted thud, before curling up into a fetal position.
Last year Hogwarts was tested
“I never trusted that old coot! How could he do this?”
“Why am I cursed? First you were the obvious choice for the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor position, and now James Potter is the obvious choice for the Transfiguration professor position. That damn snake should have killed me,” Severus seethed.
They spent the next few hours discussing how to schedule the sessions, working on homework, and bantering. Draco was sad that he had to leave for his Prefect shift, but smiled at the scene of his friends sitting at the fireplace. He was glad that Harry Potter had came back to Hogwarts for the year, which was a surprise to him.
Seeker: Harry Potter
The Daily Prophet still writes that he or his mother used the Imperius Curse on Potter, bought him off, and definitely got off too easy for their crimes. He didn’t know why his mother still read the garbage, but it was part of her daily routine. It was the only mail they usually received, as most of their old social circle didn’t want to tarnish their name by associating with the Malfoys. His mother had taken that blow rather hard, as she loved nothing more than the elite social circle of the wealthy.
He made it about three sentences before he felt himself start to fall asleep in the common room; he shook himself awake and started reading again, even though he desperately wanted to go to bed. He had tried to read the same page three times when he heard footsteps entering the common room. Draco cursed in his mind believing it was Harry in the middle of a crisis again, and then froze, horrified that he was briefly angry at his boyfriend over a mental problem he had no control over. He looked up at the figure, ashamed of himself, and saw that it was Neville.
Granger walked into the cabin shortly after Draco, and everyone stood a little straighter and tried to talk to her. She was polite to them all, but was visibly uncomfortable; Draco wondered if she enjoyed the fact that Potter received the majority of the spotlight, so she could stay out of it. Draco felt the train start to move, and realized that the only “Eighth Years” in the cabin were him and Granger. He expected at least one from each house, but then he didn’t know how many eighth years there were or how they were going to be sorted this year. None of the letters had mentioned, Draco just assumed they would stay in their regular dormitories due to Slughorn sending him a letter.
‘I know the brothers are bad Ginny but don’t forget that the ones you have at home are worse,’ were one of the phrases most commonly said by Harry to comfort Ginny. Harry had explained later on to Mrs Rose that the ‘brothers’ were their nicknames for a panic and anxiety attack, justifying that a bit of humour always helped Ginny stay grounded and stopped the situation from going out of hand.
‘Useless, worthless, disgusting. Failure, disappointment, trash. You can’t even handle yourself out in public, something even a two-year-old can do. What a joke.’ He whimpered softly, curling up into a tighter ball, begging, pleading the horrible voices to just go away. The toxic thoughts kept seeping through the weak almost non-existent defences into his mind once again, corrupting him even further.
“Who says I’m worried?” Murmured Harry under his breath.
He had noticed during his short time with Harry that the the overgrown idiot had an undertone of superiority in his voice when speaking, much like Dumbledore, as if he was speaking on a topic he had centuries worth of experience that he possessed but Draco lacked, which he didn’t.  Draco frowned in displeasure. He didn’t like that very much. In his opinion, Harry was picking up and learning all the wrong things and bad habits this world has to offer.
"Draco, is it alright if I touched your shoulder?" Harry asked, slowly and deliberately, articulating his words the best he could. Harry had been making coffee, his head in the clouds once again. His fiery temper had already begun to cool down, and he was starting to wonder what was wrong with Draco today. He had seemed out of it, throwing insult after insult at Harry, but each of the verbal bullets he fired at Harry’s way seemed half-hearted and were all lacking the usual passion and jab it typically had. Harry had been half tempted to call him out for it.
"Draco, what's wrong," Harry prodded, this time completely sober.
Malfoy barely managed to nod through the haze spreading like a wildfire in his head. His face was like the fermenting Shiraz wine in his Father’s wine cellar, a blush in a brilliant shade of claret flushed across his face, a stark contrast to his fair porcelain skin, making it look even paler than before.
Harry pursed his lips and puffed out his chest, still very flustered. He tried to think of a witty response.
Harry was more than half convinced that Draco was a cat, and Mrs Rose was a witch. Despite working at Briar Rose for more than half a year and cleaning every nook and cranny in the shop every day, Harry had never seen this area.
He was already feeling light-headed and nauseous, and Potter didn’t seem to be a great help with that at all. Draco could catch the smell of his cologne, a light combination of vanilla mixed with cedar and sandalwood, along with a strong woody smell from the lit candles in the air. He could also catch whiffs of coffee beans, flour, and cookies in the air. He suspected he was looking at a part-time kitchen disaster and potential cookie thief.
But how would Draco know? He was but a bystander in this situation, a prisoner in his own house, a captive of yet another one of Voldemort's twisted mind games. However fragile Narcissa Malfoy was, she held strong. She stayed sane. She kept up her facade. For her son. 'For me' Draco bitterly remembered. 'Until Father’s life long sentence in Azkaban.' It was the straw that broke the camel’s back. When news of Father’s sentence reached his Mother, she had been in hysterics, kicking and screaming like a madwoman. She had gone on a crazed rampage, throwing random curses and hexes left and right causing chaos all over, demanding her husband be freed. It had taken no less than three squads of full-grown Aurors and four stun spells to subdue one Narcissa Malfoy Black.
Me: Screw it I'm writing.
“Doesn’t matter Potter, I’m paying. Now could you be a dear and add an extra-large mocha cupcake with whipped cream on top to my order? With a side of extra whipped cream of course." He smirked, looking Harry straight in the eyes. "It’s simply adorable how concerned you are, really, but I think I'll survive.” Harry sputtered, looking appalled at the mere thought of him being sympathetic towards Draco.
Harry’s cheeks was beginning to take on a red tint like a ripening tomato, his lips pressed into a thin line. He gave Draco one last poisonous look before plastering on a thin smile, barely concealed resentment bubbling and stewing below his seemingly calm surface, his rage eager to erupt at any given moment.
"Merlin, Potter. Do you ever shut up?" Draco asked in a curt tone, rolling his eyes, his voice laced with extreme irritation. “Firstly, I’m Draco Lucius Malfoy, and Malfoys don’t have ‘panic attacks’,” he said, explaining his flawed logic with enough plot holes to make swiss cheese as if it were a common fact, his arms raised above him in air quotes. “Secondly, don’t speak to me in that tone Potter, it’s disgusting.”
"Y-Why did you do that?" Harry forced out the question with an annoying unwanted stutter. He could feel the heat still growing in his cheeks. By now, Harry suspected that they were way beyond an attractive rosiness, his crimson cheeks now marking him out as a social incompetent. He felt like his embarrassment was written in bold italics across his face.
Not two minutes into his walk to Briar Rose and Draco was already regretting his choice of clothes and his poor life decision making skills. The bitter cold had a way of wicking away body heat faster than it can be replaced. It was one of those days when normal clothes weren't enough, and they feel thinner than what they actually were. A thin layer of snow was starting to gather on top of his head, the whiteness of his blond locks causing it to blend in perfectly. In the frosty morning air, his skin looked paler than normal despite the blood rushing to his cheeks and nose, making him look like a washed-out watercolor painting.
Despite her elegant name, Mrs Rose was a quirky spirited elderly lady, short and stout, who always insisted that her white wispy hair were silvery locks. Her shoulder-length ‘luscious locks’ were barely long enough, but she had always somehow managed to twirl it up in a neat bun, topping it off with a classic long wooden knitting needle to hold it in place. She wore half-moon glasses with a connecting chain around her neck for her failing eyesight, much like Dumbledore. If it wasn’t for her quirkiness and her penchant for dangerous candy, especially toxic waste, Harry would have assumed she were a sweet old lady, a classic storytale grandma come to life.
Draco had chose to spend his time reading a lovely book written by a rather well-known muggle-born that particular day. He still remembered silently musing to himself about how that Monday morning had been going exceptionally well. After all, apart from the way that he had been getting less sleep than often, just about everything else went the way he expected it to go, from the nightmares to the panic attacks.
"Are you sure Malfoy?" Harry hunched his back and bent down, leaning in closer to look at him, his nose almost touching Draco’s. Draco swallowed, his mouth feeling as dry as the burnt-toast-that-was-partially-on-fire-for-a-few-seconds he had for breakfast a few days ago. That was the last thing he ate before spiralling and going into an all coffee mode.
Before the Battle of Hogwarts.
“Draco, I’m going to move you now alright?” He waited patiently for a few seconds until he heard a barely audible noise of approval from Draco. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s chest, lifting him. Draco stood up, revealing the current state of his top. His once crisp and clean black turtleneck was now crumpled and messy, wrinkles and creases all over. Some parts of his top were in a much darker shade than others, stained with salty tears.
'You’re not a kid anymore,' he thought to himself. 'Pull it together.' The tormenting continued.
“Draco! You forgot something!” He called, trying to catch his attention, but to no avail. His voice was lost in the wind. He tsked in annoyance, before breaking out into a light jog to catch up to him, careful not to slip on the wet icy pavement and metal drains.
Draco let out a slow, controlled breath and attempted to loosen his body movements. He rolled his shoulders back and forth before tilting his head left and right to stretch his stiff aching muscles, earning a few satisfying cracks after sitting in one position for too long. His body felt sore and rigid, his joints aching.
The air was filled with the rich aroma of roasted coffee beans, chocolate and baked goods galore mixed with accents of wood. There was the occasional tinkle of the bell as someone exited or entered the shop, paired with the light clink-clank noises as someone set a glass down. The merry tune of a vintage CD player in the corner played in the background, though slightly drowned out by the light chitter-chatter of students discussing projects or simply gossiping with friends about the latest trends.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Apology accepted," Harry responded coldly, not even sparing him a glance before he went marching off to make Draco’s order.
“Nay. Thy has’t been flattered beyond words, and thy can nay longeth’r comprehend what thou art declaring. Horror.”
Me: *Plans to not write Part two till next year*
Draco scrunched up his nose and leaned away as far as possible from Harry, sinking into the endless depths of the impossibly soft sofa he was sitting on, covering his face with a red throw pillow. He tried focusing on the pleasant crackling sounds of fresh wood burning in the fireplace, a mixture of Fir and Alder heating the cafe, instead of the incoming migraine, a looming, soon to be, complication.
‘Like a Plimpy out of the water’, as his father used to say. His hands were cold and clammy, beads of cold sweat sliding off his face despite the warmth and humidity of the shop. His head felt like a sledgehammer was pounding on it. He felt like it was splitting into two under the immense pressure. Tears slide down his cheeks, staining his turtleneck. He couldn’t think, see or hear clearly.
Draco’s eyes widened in surprise and poorly concealed horror. He let out a squeak.
Umm for those who wished for it... part two is here! :D This was quite rushed though so .-.
'Of course, he hates you, everyone here hates you, and they don't even all know you,' Draco bit his lip and inhaled sharply.
“Is the cupcake for a friend, Potter?” Lance let out a mock gasp, his hands raised to cover his mouth. He pretended to wipe a tear from his eye. "His all grown up now." Harry snorted, letting out a laugh.
The last room will be occupied by Roper, Brocklehurst, and Moon.
“Brilliant! The Charms classroom on the third floor. Flitwick is more than happy to let us use it, so it should be unlocked.” Draco forced a smile and nodded. He gathered up his things and walked out of the library without another word. He felt Harry walk beside him, and then reach for his hand. Draco thought he made the movement subtle enough that Harry wouldn’t notice his evasion, but the Golden Boy had. “Is everything alright, Draco? You seem off; you’ve seemed off for a bit now.”
“Why’s that, Blaise?”
“You old fool! How did you think this would ever be a good idea? You saved their lives, only to ensure their deaths by your hand! Go to another painting, or I will remove this one from Hogwarts!”
Then he heard a “Fucking hell, Potter!” and the same voice cast the counter-curse to stop the blood flowing. Malfoy must have seen his rage, and said
Draco’s hand faltered for a second before resuming playing with Harry’s hair. “I would like that,” he whispered. Harry let a small smile play on his lips before sitting all the way up. He looked at Draco in the eyes before leaning forward.
“Oi, Malfoy! Back off, you git!”
Most of the room looked relieved and nodded. Slowly the normal conversation had started back up, but Hopkins and Weasley were staring at Harry with looks of disbelief. Harry ignored them and walked to the fireplace, sitting next to Zabini. He looked over his shoulder and called out to Granger.
“Dumbledore,” Draco provided.
“You’re lying.” It was a statement, not accusing or questioning, and Ron felt his ears heat up. His dad always knew when any of them lied, but didn’t usually call them out. Ron sighed, and felt all the fear he kept at bay seeing his best mate in a puddle of his own blood, flood into him.
“What happened last time?” Harry sighed at the question he knew was coming, but wanted to avoid for as long as possible.
“This a Muggle magazine.”
” Harry thought to himself.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Don’t mention it, Draco, it’s what friends do.” Oh God, he had an equal number of Gryffindor and Slytherin friends now. What was his life becoming?
Dumbledore looked at Harry with sorrow and left. Harry looked at Severus who was exuding anger, and wondered how to calm him down. It seemed like Severus had learnt some anger management techniques, though, and was visibly calming down in front of him.
“Yes, speaking. Who is this?”
James nodded, and Severus waved his wand over James’s head. A long list and intricate web projected into the air and Lily cursed. Harry did not know what most of the spells were, but Filius and Lily seemed to as they both paled. Hermione also seemed taken aback.
“What will you do if I don’t Longbottom? Last I checked, you’re still rubbish at magic.”
“Did Trelawney say that, or did the universe speak to you?” Draco snorted. For the first time since the beginning of the school year, Potter shot an angry look at Draco.
“I didn’t know Draco was the one asking Dobby to bring me food, because Dobby wouldn’t tell me. I haven’t told anyone why I don’t go to the Great Hall, sir.”
James looked around, but didn’t recognize either of them. Harry stood up and walked over to the man. His hands were sweaty, and he nearly stumbled.
She raised her eyebrows, “My mother disowned me after the Battle because she did not agree with my stance, so I stayed in Muggle London until the beginning of this term. I volunteered because it wasn’t fair that I wasn’t ordered to do community service. I picked up a bit of slang when a few children poked fun at me for my dialect.”
Harry felt exhausted and a headache blooming, but the cloudiness that was always there wasn’t blanketing everything anymore. Malfoy’s quiet whispers and hand were still comforting him, and Harry felt extremely embarrassed that he had broken down in front of Malfoy. He croaked out, “Malfoy, stop” and pushed himself into a sitting position. He didn’t want to look at the blonde boy, but forced himself to say “Thanks.”
“Apparently Hogwarts is offering to let us go to school for an eighth year, so we can have a decent chance to get N.E.W.T.S. The offer was extended to me, as well as the requirement that I come back as a Prefect. The third letter is from the Minister explaining why going to Hogwarts is beneficial for me.”
“We won’t be able to find him quickly, would you know where he went to Draco?” Hermione asked in a neutral voice, obviously upset but probably seeing the fall-out coming a long time ago.
“Hello there,” James greeted cheerfully, seemingly unaware of Harry and Severus’s reactions.
“Indeed,” Filius squeaked. “We shall find a way to keep you both safe, though. Between all of us, Dumbledore’s charms stand no chance.”
The opportunity presented itself at the end of dinner when Lily said, “Severus, you told James that we were friends, but I don’t remember that at all.”
Draco blinked again, and his smile was more hesitant this time. “Well that’s certainly a step.”
“Why would they take offense, Headmaster? And do you not care what Hartley thinks?”
By some miracle, Pansy, Zabini, and Longbottom were all sitting in front of the fireplace, and Draco walked towards his friends. Then fell on his face from a tripping jinx sent by Hopkins, his Hufflepuff roommate with a grudge. Most of the common room broke out into laughter and Draco felt his face flush. He desperately wanted to hex the sneering boy, but knew better. It seemed like Longbottom did not.
“His story is that Death was pissed about being robbed of a soul, and warned him to never reveal his charm that stopped the killing curse. He then told us that he had to hide my parents so his charm would never be suspected. He also said that he had to leave me here because I was the ‘Chosen One’.”
“She can look at them too. I’m sure between the five of us we can find a way to unravel Dumbledore’s charms.”
“Come to Quidditch try-outs tomorrow at 5. I need to pick a team, since our first game is in four weeks. I need a good player, so Snape doesn’t murder me. That’s not the way I want to go.”
Harry had been back at Hogwarts for almost two and a half weeks, and had been leaving the Eighth year common room every night at midnight for the last six days with his invisibility cloak on. He had rushed through the corridors to an abandoned classroom, the perfect place in his opinion as it was never used and not close to anything a student might stumble into, and pulled out his wand. He never uttered the first syaball before a “Stop, Potter” was said into the room, and Malfoy would light up his wand. Every single time it was the same thing, and Harry was starting to get irritated.
The beginnings of Draco’s own crush on Harry had wormed its way into Draco’s heart, but he had been ruthlessly ignoring it. Draco knew that Harry needed a friend more than a potential boyfriend, and Draco thought Harry would probably never like the blonde boy like that anyways. However, his heart was ignoring his head’s frankly reasonable explanation. Then Harry had comforted the Slytherin girl and said all of that shit about Slythernins not being bad, and Draco had fallen in love with the messy haired, insufferable, wonderful Golden Boy. He groaned and walked into the common room.
“Yes, well.” Draco cleared his throat and tried to stop his cheeks from turning red, but he was failing. “The war caused me to either cause pain and death or stand by doing nothing while it happened too often, so I am going to repay my debt to society by becoming a healer. However, I don’t know if the Wizarding World will let me, so I’m preparing myself to potentially become a Muggle doctor. Their healing is barbaric, but maybe I can find a way to polish it without landing myself into trouble with the Ministry.”
“Mr. Potter, I presume?”
She gave an exasperated sigh over the question and voiced her dislike over Ron not taking his N.E.W.T.S. Then she told Harry how proud she was over him going back to Hogwarts with Hermione, and Harry flushed. He ate about half his plate and thanked Mrs. Weasley for stopping by and cooking; then he promised her he would go to the birthday dinner. When she left, she hugged him, and he had the distinct feeling she wanted to say something else but thought better of it.
“How did I see my parents then during the
Harry turned around and remembered he had a message for the Wallers, “Oh, before I forget again, Draco might have made a bit of headway concerning the charms. He wants to call a meeting within the week.”
The next day Draco was sitting in the library doing his homework for Muggle Studies when Harry burst in, looking frazzled. He looked around before spotting Draco and rushed to him. Once he reached the table, he had to take a moment to catch his breath. Draco knew what was coming, but he did not want to believe it.
Harry and Lily spent the next hour talking, until Harry cast a tempus charm and discovered that he had already missed half of Quidditch practice. He said his goodbyes to Lily and rushed to the Quidditch pitch. He was relieved that Ron had seemed to take charge of the practice, but was upset to see that Draco was not there. He wanted to talk to his boyfriend, but had no idea what to say. Ron greeted him cheerily when he saw Harry, and whispered, “Thank Merlin, you’re ok. I was worried about you, but Hermione told me to come here in case you showed up while she looked around the castle. I’ll send her a quick Patronus to call off the search.” Harry nodded and led the rest of Quidditch practice. When practice was over, Hermione, Neville, Pansy, and Blaise were waiting on him; they all hugged him.
It had been three weeks since that dreadful Defense Against the Dark Arts class, and Draco had not spoken to Harry at all. Harry had spent the first week trying to speak to Draco, but the blonde boy ran away from him anytime Harry was close. Harry knew that Draco was not eating, sleeping, or socializing because Neville told him when Harry asked. Pansy and Blaise were still not talking to Draco, and Harry felt immeasurably sad for the boy. The only time Harry saw Draco now was Quidditch practice and the classes they shared, and the boy looked terrible.
“To eventually be the Head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation. Once she learns that you are from the States, she’ll probably try to become your favourite student.”
“Draco you don’t have to; I know you’re incredibly busy as it is.”
About an hour after he arrived, a few more guests started showing up to the dinner; Neville was the first and talked to Harry about his excitement to go back to Hogwarts and his hope that Professor Sprout would let him plant something in the greenhouses. Next came the Lovegoods, which Luna speared him with a stare; she came up to him, and the usual dreamy tone to her voice was gone when she stated that he should stop. Harry was taken aback by her tone, and the fact he wasn’t sure what she meant. He had a very strong suspicion, but didn’t know how she could tell. The dreamy tone came back, when she started telling him about the newest fictional creature her father was obsessed with.
Malfoy,
“Trouble seems to follow me, and I’m nosy.”
“Are we going to the Great Hall alone, or are we waiting on everybody else?”
The last room will be occupied by Zabini, Potter, and Corner.
“I don’t think you were going to do it; you started finding your own path not forged by people forcing their expectations on you and realized it makes you happy.”
That was a week ago, and Harry’s first session with a healer was supposed to be two hours ago. However, Harry just couldn’t get up, he could only stare at the ceiling with his thoughts being blanketed by a cloudy feeling in his head. Harry heard footsteps and voices whispering. He didn’t have the energy to look up when the door opened, and still didn’t know who was there when they approached his bed.
Looking back, he's positive that's why he never noticed Harry coming around to check on him.
“I need you to follow my breathing, alright Draco? 8 seconds in, hold for 4 and out for 7 seconds.” Harry breathed in for 8 seconds in an exaggerated, almost comical, way, his chest puffing out, before holding it for 4 seconds and slowly releasing the air out of his mouth for 7. Harry suspected that he looked like an inflating and deflating balloon yet he couldn’t care less about how stupid he looked. After all, Draco was his first priority.
The only reasonable choice he had left for a pet, that he was fairly sure would be allowed in auror training, would be a cat. Thus, one hyperactive Harry James Potter was sighted in Diagon Alley at 6:30 am before the sun was even up, his face pressed against glass panels of pet shops, terrifying animals and getting worried stares of passersby left and right. It was a miracle that the ministry of magic was not called in by anyone.
Afterwards he experienced partial memory loss, a cruel blessing, though he sometimes saw flashes of what happened in his dreams, only to wake up and forget. He had been stripped of his feelings and left with nothing but a hollow shell of himself, feeling infinitely emptier than usual, as if a void was eating him up inside at the realisation that he was even more lonely now than ever, if that was even possible.
When he was angry, his grey pupils constricted and he would tense up, much like an aggressive cat. Draco had relatively long and sharp nails, similar to a cat’s claws. Even his hair was as soft as cat’s fur, or perhaps it had been Harry’s imagination. Hagrid would have been proud of his clear, detailed and concise observation.
It was only when Harry ran out of the store, the icy cold of winter hitting him, chilling him to the bones, did he remember he had forgotten to wear his winter jacket. The temperature was around 0 degrees, and Harry suspected that it may start snowing soon. The bitter cold was like a slap in the face from mother nature herself. He saw Draco up ahead.
"Potter," Draco replied, his trademark smirk hanging proudly of his face, crossing his arms in a similar style and sinking back and disappearing into the couch even further. Harry leaned forward towards Draco, about to argue back when-
Draco discreetly looked around, carefully observing his surroundings. The double levelled coffee shop had multiple long wooden tables, most of which were already occupied by small groups of college students, seemingly studying for their final exams.
"Yes you do, Malfoy," Harry insisted, leaning forward, trapping Draco between his body and the sofa. He stared Draco in the eye. “Stop hiding it.”
It was at 8:34 am, about half an hour after the sun had risen, roughly two hours after Harry had been first spotted at Diagon alley, exactly two hours and fourteen minutes since his hunt for a pet started. Harry had finally found it. The chosen one. His soulmate.
Harry whacked him on the head, hard. Lance gave an injured yelp.
Harry looked like he survived another war. He had scratch marks, bite marks and small puncture wounds all over his body in different shapes and sizes, his battle scars ranging from tiny bite marks to large foot long scratches. His whole body was throbbing.
“Merlin!” He looked back to see his friend, Lance, a underpaid (he begs to differ) part-timer at Briar Rose and college student, smirking. He was from Scottish descent and had icy blue eyes paired with curly brown hair he had affectionately nicknamed ‘dark chocolate shavings’, and had somehow managed to keep his tan skin, (‘milk chocolate shade’ he said, despite Harry’s insistence that it was a shade of burnt orange,) from wakeboarding in the summer, much to Harry’s confusion and disbelief. Harry is half convinced that he has a DIY tanning machine at home.
He had woken up in a puddle of cold sweat, shivering, his hands and feet feeling numb. His heart pounding too hard, too fast in his rib cage. He had slipped into another panic attack, quickly going out of breath. He couldn't breathe.
His knees were already starting to buckle under his non-existent weight. He hadn’t been eating much for the past few months, often skipping meals or forgetting to eat food altogether for days. He remembered that one time he went without food for almost a week. He had almost collapsed in the middle of the school day. A stupid mistake. When was the last time he had eaten? He couldn’t remember.
"It's none of your business, Potter," Draco snapped. He was on the precipice of breaking, of free-falling yet again into the unending abyss of toxic thoughts without a harness. Why couldn’t Harry just let this go?
Draco straightened his face and closed his eyes, sensing an oncoming migraine. He raised a hand to rub his temple. He was not ready for this.
"I beg your pardon?" Draco asked, as Harry blatantly ignored, instead choosing to walk over to the nearest sofa to escape. He sat heavily, landing with a soft thud. Draco shifted around on the sofa he was in, repositioning himself and shifting around until he got comfortable. Harry looked at Draco only to see just the tip of his silvery hair struggling to stay afloat but failing, drowning in a seemingly endless sea of red. Harry let out an exasperated sigh.
“Would you like a calming Potion, Mrs. Potter?”
Draco choked slightly as he slowly pulled off of Harry, wanting to draw out this miraculous situation for as long as possible. With lips still wrapped around the tip, he looked up and found green eyes that were positively burning into him. Harry's mouth was shut tight, his jaw set hard and Draco understood that Harry was also holding himself off.
"Harry," Draco moaned again, threatening Harry's hold on himself, a desperate sound escaping him as he felt the immense pleasure building its way through his body. "Harry," Draco gasped, his hand flying over his cock between them. "Look at me."
At some point he had released Draco's right arm, which Draco had snaked around Harry's waist, his hand tightly gripping the thick fabric of Harry's robe to pull him closer. Harry, thrusting in abandon against him, closed his mouth over the soft skin of Draco's exposed neck, eliciting another moan from him.
The dreaded idea of Ginny possibly returning to Dean after the match - whether from celebration or consolation - kept constantly plaguing him, repeatedly turning his stomach over. Unlike the nature of his private meetings with Dumbledore, this was a problem he felt he had no one to confide in about. It was too complicated - and admittedly terrifying - to simply sit Ron down and say,
"I didn't take - I - you could have -" he spluttered, turning around to face him. Draco's arms were crossed, and he was half sitting on the ledge of the soaking tub. He had at some point during Harry's inspection unbuttoned the grey shirt he was wearing, and Harry could see his white cotton undershirt tight against his skin. His eyes glanced over Draco's long, pale neck and stopped over the red mark he had made there, feeling his arousal grow.
"Draco, I -" he started, and it was the first time either Draco or Harry saw Snape lost for words. He swallowed and nodded to himself. Then he spoke very carefully.
"Is that what you thought of your best friend?" he said darkly. "Or what your father thought?"
Draco didn't know how he hadn't just come from that sound alone as pleasure jolted through his gut. He had never imagined the real Harry, saint that he
other than Malfoy right now –
Narcissa nodded, her mouth in a thin line. "I see. I suspect you will arrest me now?"
“Where we goin’, babe?” Ron said in confusion as she pulled them towards the front door.
my mum. They never even told me I was a wizard."
"I have roamed this castle for nearly as long as it has stood." His hollow voice rasped.
"Yes, sir. I am."
Mutual gasps were added to the sound of Harry's wand clattering to the tile floor as Draco's hard cock beneath his sodden trousers was now firmly pressed against Harry's bare prick.
, Potter," he drawled with an effort, and Harry's harsh expression faltered. Despite how much he wanted to, he couldn't bring himself to admit much more. "That doesn't mean I have to be a saint like you."
Draco inhaled deeply and sighed, his chest causing Harry to rise and fall with him, replacing his current thoughts with new concern that he was somehow crushing Draco's lithe frame with his own. He began to push himself up, their skin unsticking as he turned himself over, letting his back hit the bed next to Draco. The air around them smelled like sex, sweat and a sudden awkwardness. Why did he ever let himself kiss Draco in that god forsaken closet? Why, after so many years, was he just now admitting to himself he loved the other man? How the fuck was he supposed to do this now?
“No, but he might,” Harry said, nodding towards Malfoy.
- like a real human being - and then Harry went and slashed him open like an imbecile. The shame and guilt he felt was almost too much.
?" he said, completely aghast.
“You got a problem with that?” she huffed, leaning back up from the table.
"I - I didn't -" Harry was saying, his anger fading fast. He was looking terribly ashamed of himself and Malfoy couldn't resist taking another step closer.
However, due to recent events and reality, that option seemed inadvisable.
"I'm starting here." Harry said abruptly, and Malfoy slowly followed him, not leaving his sight.
"What am -
"Mal- er, Draco." Draco didn't look at him.
"I grew up with muggles."
Harry, who was beginning to feel much, much too warm, laughed. “Feeling’s mutual, mate,” he said, and Malfoy actually
"Draco, it's - I could learn -"
Potter,” Malfoy said, hand finally closing around something in his pocket. He pulled a pack of cigarettes –
Draco didn't hide his shock.
could
What if Vernon Dursley had been his own father? Harry thought with a sick pang in his stomach. Would he have wound up acting like Dudley? Like Draco?
Malfoy blinked at him, licking his lips and Harry, entranced by it, couldn’t stop himself from slowly stepping closer again, praying to whoever would listen that something, someone,
"I didn't mean it as in forever, just- just not right now."
"He died?" Harry repeated, aghast at both the probability of Lucius murdering the child and Draco's lack of emotion.
His eyes refocused on Harry's, who now looked like he knew something that Draco had not wanted
Harry's brain reeled. He assumed it would have been Draco's nature to dominate Harry, to take him, use him, and Harry had been prepared to let that happen. But there Draco was, knees digging into either side of Harry's hips, fingering himself for him. For Harry.
Now that they were no longer in separate rooms, Draco could make out the harsh panting added to the sound of the running water. He ducked back behind the wall, hands nervously smoothing his hair back, mind beginning to race.
That was definitely not a hex, nor did it seem like any semblance of the word "no", and before Draco woke up from this alternate reality where life was suddenly being kind to him again, he pushed his tongue past soft lips.
"Your seventh what? Birthday?"
“Ah, he prolly just feels bad we’re smashed –” Ron said, leaning over and giving his sister a kiss on the forehead.
"Okay..." Harry said, not really understanding Draco's amazement.
Harry's hands fisted into the wet fabric stuck to his back, gasping and jutting his hips forward against nothing, his heavy member swaying.
“Git.”
"Are you going to search the place or stand there and question me all night?"
"Shit," he breathed, trying hard not to thrust his hips into Draco's hot, wet mouth. The sight of the sleek, blonde man on his knees, Harry's cock slowly sliding between his pink lips, was almost too much. Harry was sure that if he hadn't come earlier, he would have came right then all over Draco's beautiful, pale face. Draco made a small noise around his cock as his lips moved further forward, trying to take all of him in. It reverberated through Harry, making him gasp and lean forward, putting a hand on Draco's left shoulder to steady himself. Draco felt Harry's pubic hair tickle the tip of his nose, his lips touching his hand he still had wrapped around the base. He pulled his lips back to the head, sucking as he went.
know.
"I'd hardly call that stealing, Malfoy. You practically gave it to me." If there was any color left in Malfoy's already pale complexion, it soon fled. He averted Harry's gaze and remained silent. Harry tried his best not to appear shocked by the reaction. Malfoy had never been one to stand down. He always had had some infuriating retort, always knew exactly what to say to get under Harry's skin, always stuck it to him until fists were flying and blood was pouring.
Draco's eyes went unfocused as he remembered the first time he came from deliberately touching himself to do so, rather than from waking up to it already happening. He hadn't been able to stop himself from thinking about hearing Harry speak parseltongue.
"You must not submit to your misery.
"What?" he nearly yelled. Narcissa remained silent.
I will help you -"
Harry looked back at him, his eyes showing something challenging, firey and commanding yet somehow still soft and vulnerable in their depths.
dating the bouncer, so –” she began giggling again.
Harry's blush deepened. "Er, ye-" His voice cracked and he cleared his throat. "Yes."
"Holy shit," Draco gasped, staring at the fabric in his hands wide-eyed. There was no other explanation. "Harry - this is - this is

Oh my goodness!
"What?"
gave it
His hands were winding into the front of Draco’s robes and he was leaning in, their hot breath mingling, watching dark blonde lashes fluttering closed, and there was no way that Harry could stop himself –
Harry waited for his usual anger and hatred for Draco to flare, but it never came. He stood there, silent and completely naked in front of him and almost completely defenseless, as he heard Ron somewhere in the depths of his mind reminding him he could just punch Draco on the nose if he had to. Draco, obviously not getting the response he had been trying to elicit from Harry, continued.
"Actually," Harry said quietly, "I'm going to let you slide on this one, Mrs. Malfoy."
it from me, Draco. Now, tell me-"
“I wish I had some sobering potions to give you but I didn’t even think of it when Mum firecalled,” she said. “I just apparated straight to the bar –” They resumed walking, Harry struggling to keep a straight path.
Harry made a small noise of surprise in response and Draco drank it in, tongue finding his paralyzed one and caressing it. He dipped it under Harry's tongue, moving it against the slick underside and back over again.

for it - of
"No…" he whispered.
The knowledge of that sent waves of pleasure rippling through him and his thumbs dug into Harry's hips hard to keep from touching himself. He let Harry's cock slip entirely from his mouth. It sprang back up, bobbing towards his abdomen and Draco tilted his head to the right as he leaned in, experimentally licking a broad stripe up Harry's bollocks to the base of his cock. He heard a gasp above him, causing him to do it again, his nose pressing into the soft top of Harry's scrotum as he licked. A deep, guttural groan caught in Harry's throat.
“I stopped at six – no way I could do anymore – not after the two pints I already had. But Harry,
No, the events of his life had never happened suddenly. He hadn't suddenly called things off with Ginny. He had called things off ages ago at Dumbledore's funeral for his self-planned death. He had known then what he still knows now. He hadn't just randomly slept with Draco Malfoy out of nowhere, all the sudden - it was after years of pent up frustration and repressed attractions that finally came to fruition. And he hadn't suddenly fallen in love with the man sleeping soundly next to him. It had happened over the course of those years, over the realizations that they weren't all that different in the end.
Ginny said very softly, gently sweeping her fingers over their new son’s cheeks, tufts of wild black hair sticking out of where the blanket wrapped around the baby’s head. His little cries had stopped the moment Ginny had spoken, making cute little scrunched faces, his swollen eyes still closed. “It’s all right, Mummy’s here,” she said, pressing a few small kisses to his soft face and rocking him gently for a few moments. “Daddy’s here, too,” she whispered with a smile, and then passed the precious bundle slowly into Harry’s arms.
"I told you-" he started, but Harry rounded on him.
Harry's moan echoed off the tile walls, and he moved his hand from Draco's shoulder to his head, threading his fingers through white blonde hair. Draco removed his hand from Harry's cock, grabbing both of his hips and inhaling deeply through his nose as he took Harry all the way into his throat. Harry cried out, gripping blonde hair tightly in both of his fists. Draco pulled back quickly and sucked him in entirely again, and again, and –
“Ecstasy – you know – Mandy? It’s a muggle drug,” she said, giggling. “I’ve never done it, but it’s supposed to be
"They sent you here, a presumably empty household, with a search and seizure warrant, did they not, Auror Potter? Pity. It looks to me that the only thing you've successfully managed to seize was my arse. Do they award badges for debauchery?"
sort of funny just how crazy that whole thing had been, and suddenly, for the first time ever, Harry found himself laughing with Draco Malfoy.
Was he actually going to allow this opportunity to pass him by? That meant he would never know how Potter would
They caught each other's heated, shocked eyes and Draco held onto the gaze as he slowly ground his hips forward.
"Both of us?" he asked quietly.
"You open it, then," he gritted out.
“Seven to seven!” yelled a scantily clad girl, who looked a bit too young to be involved with the crowded bar scene.
"I can't," Harry gasped, "Draco, I-" Draco pulled his mouth off Harry with a smack, not wanting Harry to come just then. He quickly stood up and brought his mouth down on Harry's, kissing him with fierce eagerness.
"May I touch it?" he asked, his voice husky, purposely glancing down and back up.
The girl immediately stopped talking and turned around. Another girl wearing more dark eye make-up than clothing squealed at the sight of her.
"Look, Malfoy - if - if you're trying to - to get me back or whatever for the other day - I don't blame you. I deserve it," he said bitterly. "But I'm not going to stop defending myself."
He then decided he deserved some sort of honorary dual house membership to Gryffindor because leaning forward and pressing his lips to Potter's instead of answering him properly was a complete act of bravery.
"Do you want my mouth, Potter?" he whispered against his ear, sending a shiver through the other man.
"How da- I - you stole my wand!" he sputtered. Oh, this was good, Harry thought. Getting Malfoy to sputter. That was definitely not something he did often, if ever.
, Potter. You know I started it. And I know you -" he bit his lip as his hand pressed over his sensitive left nipple. "Didn't mean to do it." Harry went from looking ashamed to bewildered in a single second as he watched.
"Hominum Revelio." Nothing. Well, at least it was only Malfoy that Harry had to deal with. Harry watched him close the door, keeping his wand on him. His hair had grown slightly past his shoulders and he looked malnourished. As an Auror, Harry knew that he was to immediately detain him and escort him back to the Ministry. As Harry, he completely ignored that. "What the hell are you doing here, Malfoy?"
"Tell me, Potter, what could be so
” she was suddenly breathless, moving closer to him, her eyes searching his forehead for –
"My bedroom, of course."
“Ponce.”
Harry's eyes grew wide at his brazen display and he stepped back a bit, causing the streaming water to come down directly over his head. He leaned to the side to avoid it.
"I made an Unbreakable Vow with your mother to protect you. If you continue this and die, so will I."
Snape brought his own wand up again, muttering under his breath and Harry eyes glazed over again for a moment.
"Why not?" he responded, no intention of stopping. He was pulling Harry up the single step of the platform to his bed. The seduction in his voice snaked around Harry, cutting off the circulation to his reasoning abilities.
Draco watched the dreamy look overtake him, choking back a sob as he erased Harry's memory completely from now until he had made what had been the best decision of his life to interrupt him in the shower.
"Doesn't everyone?" Harry heard where Draco's delicate sneer came from.
Harry's hips stilled as his brain caught up to the question.
"For fuck’s sake," he whispered, both of their heads bowed as Draco tried to free the fabric. Harry laughed, the material came loose and Draco quickly removed it, a small smile on his own lips. He inhaled sharply as he laid eyes on Harry's shirtless torso. He was lightly tanned and muscular, although not in a bulky way. A light trail of dark hair began beneath his belly button, getting thicker the further down it went. Draco needed to touch him.
Potter jumped so sharply his left hand slipped off the tiles with a loud squeak and he almost fell face first into the wall. A second later a wand was being pointed in his face.
"Ginny Weasley."
"Er… that's the Dark wizard it says he defeated on his frog card, right?"
Ginny smiled at Harry when he came in, hands on either side of her large, round belly, and Harry felt his chest burn horribly with guilt.
Draco looked at him over the Cloak. "How long have you had this?"
He felt Harry's thighs quivering, his legs threatening to give out as the last of his orgasm jerked through him. Harry unclenched his hands from his hair and Draco put a strong left hand against him, holding him steady. He felt the last twitch of Harry's cock in his mouth and he finally pulled off, tilting his head back more than necessary to look up.
"You must - "
"I'm not a
"It looks like you've gone completely mad," Harry said in a rush.
But Harry saw the shelves, filled with rows upon rows of vials, containing what Harry assumed to be extremely damning evidence against Lucius Malfoy. He cautiously picked one up and read the label:
Draco looked over to him, meeting those beautiful green eyes. Harry's expression was both firm and soft, concerned and pleading and Draco willed himself not to cry as he nodded.
"Dumbledore can help you, you know."
The crowd around them
Harry's blunt nails dug into his back through his thin, drenched shirt, his mouth falling open as wet wool roughly rubbed against his over-sensitive cock.
"That's got to be it. It must be. It must." Harry was just as shocked by Malfoy's quiet sobs as he was the first time he had heard them, still not forgiving himself for almost killing the crying man.
was, at least. For all he knew, Harry might've received plenty of head from plenty of others and thought Draco was utterly shit at it.
"God," Harry whispered when he removed his lips from Draco's neck with a loud smack and saw the dark red mark he had left on the Slytherin's otherwise blemish free white skin. It drove him mad with desire to see it and his continued thrusting became erratic. Draco clutched him tighter, making desperate little sounds in-between his panting breaths that repeatedly ghosted over the shell of Harry's ear in time with their hips meeting together, and Harry was suddenly coming harder than ever beneath his robes, beneath his over-worn jeans and into his boxers. "Draco," he breathed as his orgasm subsided, his hips slowing. He heard Draco yell a second later, arching off the wall to press his cock against Harry as he came. They panted together for all but two seconds, when a faint voice seeped into the closet room through the master bedroom door.
What truly had happened suddenly were the many acquirements of the knowledge of such things that had always been. How much more, Harry wondered, was there to his life that he would suddenly gain the knowledge of? Sunlight flooded the room and Draco stirred in his sleep as Harry watched on, deep in his thoughts. How many others would there be in his life who- be it either from fear, or pain and suffering, or the right time being reached, or even after guilt could no longer be withstood- would reveal to Harry an answer to a question he hadn't yet asked? How many times would he himself have to do the very same?
"One minute you're throwing your Auror status in my face and threatening to detain me, and the next you're apologizing. You're a basket case, Potter." Harry internally agreed with him but rushed to defend himself.
"It's just the stupid wall with a paint chip, Po..." Malfoy trailed off, realizing that if, in fact, it had only been just a stupid wall, then they would be currently surrounded in its rubble. "My father would have told me," Draco said quietly, not entirely sure if he believed himself. He stepped forward slowly and covered his palm over the spot, muttering what sounded like complicated nonsense to Harry.
Harry's hands were scrambling over Draco. They hurriedly pushed his open grey shirt off and went flying to undo Draco's belt. Harry pulled it free from the loops, and the buckle clanked loudly on the floor. Harry struggled with Draco's fly, and Draco's hands immediately went to aid him, releasing his lips from Harry's with a hiss when his cock was freed. His trousers slowly slid off his hips and piled around his feet. Draco wasn't wearing any underwear.
“Ferret.”
Harry racked his brain quickly. That was right before his second year at Hogwarts. The memory he held might very well have been the day Lucius had given the diary to Ginny in Diagon Alley. He grabbed another vial from a row further back. Unable to recall anything for the date, he turned around to Draco, still examining the vial in his hand. "What was June 5th, 1987?"
Draco froze, paralyzed in fear.
, forcing his hips forward so that Draco was now fiercely grinding against him, making Harry grunt and moan into his mouth. The repeated pressure of Draco's hard cock pressing against his own felt absolutely
"What did you find?"
“You’re not serious,” Harry replied, tongue feeling too thick in his mouth.
laughed, his bar stool almost toppling over as he stood up from it, his broad shoulders shaking as he gripped the table, head down in hysterics.
"Are you sure?" Draco said only inches away now, so close to pressing himself against the other man that he could feel Harry's body heat adding to the heat of the water now coming down on just his back.
She giggled again, which Harry was really starting to find rather… annoying. She took another drag of her cigarette.
"Draco, wai-" Harry began.
hexed him or told him to get out. He should admit his defeat now and find some stupid excuse for his brief lack of sanity. He was utterly foolish for thinking Potter would ever-
"Draco, doll, are you alright?"
Harry swallowed and nodded quickly and even Draco's sudden fear could not diminish the weeping erection between his legs.
"What happened?" Snape asked him, stepping closer.
"I told you, I just can't -"
“You promise not to tell?” she asked, fake pout on her glittery, pink lips.
"Wow. It must suck living here like a muggle."
“I almost dropped the damn cupcake, Lance.”
The war had worn her down. After all, the once spirited woman had always been terrified of Voldemort. Perhaps it was the day-to-day anxiety, or perhaps it was the perpetual tension. It gradually broke her down piece by piece, crushing her spirit bit by bit. Crack and fractures, chinks and breaks started appearing, her carefully crafted persona of a loving mother, a faithful wife, a loyal follower slowly falling apart. Be it from the anxiety or stress, it was slowly killing her inside.
“Malfoy? What are you doing here?” Potter whisper-shouted, trying his best to keep a ‘customer worthy’ smile on his face. “ You look like you're at death’s door!”
Harry loved it. The feeling of Draco’s soft lips pressed against his, his tongue sliding against Harry’s. The kiss wasn’t fast, but slow and thorough. Draco moved his hands from Harry’s shoulder to his head, threading his hands into Harry’s brown locks as Harry pushed his lips against Draco’s, moulding them with his own.
Harry watched as the snow came down lightly, dancing in the golden sunlight, a choreographed graceful ballet conducted by the gentle wind. When Harry saw that Malfoy was completely gone. He let out a much more audible sound. With Malfoy gone his brain began to switch gears from defending himself from incoming verbal assaults to his dwindling self-esteem to processing what had just happened.
Harry would have laughed it wasn’t for the gravity of the current situation in hand. Mrs Rose had picked up his affectionate nickname for those pesky gatecrashers about half a year ago. Harry had been a part-time worker back then, and Ginny had been a regular customer, as consistent and predictable as clockwork. She would always walk with Harry to work and wait for him to finish his morning shift at the corner couch booth, sipping on hot chocolate, reading a muggle book, sometimes the newspapers.
Overall, it had been an extremely pleasant early morning. What else could he say? He was a simple man.
Me: *Binge watches HP movies and binge reads HP books*
Not only did Draco make cat-like sounds, like hissing, purring, snarling and growling, he also acted like a certain cat, specifically Snowpaw. Whether it be his scratching, his aloofness or his classic ‘I am better than you, sod off’ stare, it was all uncannily feline-like and eerily similar to his kitten.
Draco wrapped himself tighter in his borrowed blanket. He stared into the black abyss of his coffee cup, frowning at the bottom of the empty cup disappointedly as if he were expecting extra coffee to appear in his cup if he looked away.
“Of course.” Harry replied, picking up the plate and walking across the cafe towards the counter. Just then, he felt a heavy slap on his back, causing him to almost fall forward and drop the cupcake.
‘The sun doesn’t work like that! How on earth is that even possible.’ Harry had said one day. ‘Magic.’ he said matter of factly, adding a wink and jazz hands for that special effect, was the reply he had gotten from Lance. Thus began the start of a great friendship. ‘A chaotic neutral bromance.’ Lance insisted on calling it. He had made Harry look like the normal sane one in their friendship, even though Harry was the ‘boy who lived’. A shooking feat no one but him has ever accomplished thus far.
“Welcome to Briar Rose, home to the best coffee in London! What can I get you today?” Spoke the overenthusiastic voice of whatthe can safely assumed to be an underpaid employee, pulling Draco’s head out of the clouds.
Spotting no familiar faces, he let out a breath of pure unbridled relief. He felt the tension leave his face, his posture changing to a more relaxed one, as compared to the battle stance he was unconsciously in before. After all, no familiar faces meant no confrontations.
He let out a shaky breath and looked up, his cloudy moonstone eyes meeting Harry’s brilliant emeralds, still staring worriedly at him, unsure of what to do next. He gave Harry a crooked smile, feeling weak and mentally drained from the whole humiliating ordeal.
“Your lips are red,” He pointed out, an innocent look on his face. Harry blushed, looking away. He turned and glared at him.
The aftermath of Draco's panic attack.
Her favourite colour was red, and so was almost every single teacup, plate, and bowl in the shop. The dress code set by her was simple, only specifying the use of her favourite colour a must in their outfit. ‘To match with the apron’ she explained. Harry swore that if it wasn’t for her arthritic joints and her failing eyesight, she would be hopping around town offering cookies and coffee to every soul. Even the trees.
“We weren’t flirting.” He frowned, looking more and more like a grumpy cat that was forced to take a shower. Harry thought he looked adorable.
“Doesn’t matter Potter,” he whispered in a barely audible volume, reaching out his hand into his pocket to fish out his wallet. Harry’s lips pressed together, his eyes narrowed in suspicion. ‘Why would he ever believe you? You are after all, a lying, conniving, snake.’ Draco plastered a fake smile on his face.
“Hurry along now, away!” she declared, waving her walking stick up in the air like a madwoman, causing the people gathered around them to swiftly disperse.
“Ah. The great Harry Potter. Always so eloquent with words.” He laughed playfully, his eyes filled with mirth and cheeky delight. If only he knew the irony in his statement.
Breathes rising in small puffs of condensation, Draco hugged himself tightly, trying his very best to preserve the last bits of warmth the winter air had mercifully left him with. He walked briskly across the pavement, careful not to slip on the icy path less he fell.
