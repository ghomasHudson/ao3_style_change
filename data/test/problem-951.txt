Seems like Neville didn't believe him as well, he scoffed angrily “different now huh? Oh, poor Draco! Look how damaged he is, so we should all just forgive him right? No! I won't be like them.” He stepped forward, poking a painful finger in his chest “I will not pity you Malfoy. I will not flutter around you just because you became somewhat decent!”. Now he was really getting on Draco's nerves, who felt his face heat up from anger, he'd push Neville off himself, just like he did in his early years, more than anything he wished to shout in his face, to laugh out 'ha! You think you're worthy of my apology?!’ and then Neville would squirm, run away crying just like he did after all those years instead of glaring daggers at him with such bravery now Draco understood how he had the guts to slice down that snake.
“How do you like your cup of tea,Mr. Malfoy?” McGonagall said softly, already filling small tea cups with boiling water, Draco was in the middle of rubbing his ‘bruised’ hands, suddenly feeling very out of place between all the staring portraits “uh, with milk” he mumbled, immediately feeling stupid, he should be leaving, not drinking tea with the headmistress, but, she did make him do all this hard work… maybe he deserves a nice cup
Draco gasped then, searching around him frantically before grabbing his wand. "No no nono- fuck! Fuck!" He cried, his mind unable to dig up anything, any spell or incantation that could help him now. "no!" He could see him, tall and slim. Long platinum hair thin and untidy. As the man who he called his father, the man who taught him magic, the one he aspired most to be rotted away in jail. "No!" An ugly sob escaped him as Draco was gathering the pieces desperately, the world blurring in and out of focus with each fallen tear. "Please.. dad-" the paper scrunched as he held the pieces tightly in his fists, leaning his forehead against it as he rocked back and forth.
Drip, drip, drop, that's all Draco could hear, small drops of water falling into the sink, sliding down into oblivion. What time is it? He didn't know, his throat was dry from crying, and his head was resting on the cool wall while his legs spread open on the marble floor, eyes locked on a certain spot on the wall with heavy creatures snuggling up to his thigh, he let his head drop heavily to look at them, after his meltdown there seemed to be more of them now, each shaped so differently yet all gathered up together to mess up with his life.
thank you guys for all the notes <3 it makes me so happy, i'm always so excited to share a new chapter with you guys <3
Standing there, Harry was unsure whether to bolt after Blaise to avoid conversation or stay there staring blankly into a wall. Unaware of his crisis, Draco sat on his bed running a lazy hand through his hair  “we ought to get ready” he mumbled, tired eyes taking in the bright sunlight. “Yeah,right.” Harry spat out, turning around to gather his clothes, his heart dropping when the realization hit him: his clothes are still wet from yesterday. As if his morning couldn't get any weirder. Maybe he didn't have to trust Malfoy this quickly, perhaps offering him a hand of friendship was the wrong thing to do, it only brought weird things and wet clothes. besides, he and Malfoy might never get along, and within seconds time Malfoy will realize this and kick Harry out of his dorm.
Harry's head jerked at him, whipping his tie at his thigh with a loud slap. "Hey!! We won't do that!! When the classroom's empty though…"
Saying his goodbyes to Luna, Harry went off towards his Herbology lesson, if he remembers correctly, they share this lesson with the Slytherins, when he thinks about it, most of his lessons are shared with Slytherins this year, which is understandable considering how little of them returned, Harry was surprised Malfoy returned at all, but perhaps running around the school searching for his parents does not count as a war crime so he could return and finish his year at Hogwarts. Noticing a familiar bush of hair, Harry smiled widely when he found his friends already waiting next to the greenhouse, Hermione's back facing Harry, making her hair look like a floating poodle, Ron was standing in front of her, they were talking about something Harry failed to hear “hey guys” he shamelessly put himself into their conversation, they're his best friends after all, him taking a part of all the conversation was part of the 'harry Potter pack’ and the shop has no return policies.
He never really thought about it, how many familiar faces were buried after the battle of Hogwarts, people he ate and studied with on the daily, colorless amongst rows of graves. Was it because he has been so deep in his own problems? Would he, if were killed in the war, had been written in the lists? Perhaps not, just like Bellatrix and Crabbe weren't, since villians do not deserve to be remembered.
“They repaired it quite quickly, the school I mean” Hermione remarked as they made their way towards the great hall, squished between all kinds of students, the golden trio tried to stick together just like they did during darker times, always there for eachother just the three of them ready to face whatever thats coming
Even though Potter didn't state what he was talking about, Draco's forearm stinged with imaginary pain, his dark mark, of course Potter would ask about it in the end, he's seen him changing, and as much as Draco avoided the subject, there's no running away from him past- nor from the mark on his hand. Draco just scoffed, fighting the urge to roll his eyes “duh. It's a dark spell.” He spat, ready to turn away and fall into deep, deep slumber, but Harry stopped him. “Can I see?” he asked, his voice soft, barely higher than a whisper. But to Draco it sounds like shattering glass, he actually winced at the words, his hand shooting to hold his arm, clenching the white fabric around it defensively. “Sod off” Draco said, his voice coming out more of a sob than anything threatening. The truth is, he was terrified of showing it, the mark he once wore proudly, bragging to his friends how he was chosen by the dark lord, just like his father.
Getting tired of the silence, Harry broke it; “are you going to use the spell?” He asked, his mind drifting back to their earlier conversation with McGonagall, a part of him truly wishing Malfoy would never come around to actually
Shortly after that they reached a tiny classroom, McGonagall opened the door swiftly heading over to the teachers table and pulling out a huge pile of books “carry them to my office please” she said, Draco nodded pulling out his wand only to be stopped by her “oh you won't be needing magic for such a simple task won't you?”  Draco frowned, why bother carrying stuff when you
Harry fell back with a loud yelp, groaning audibly from pain as his head hit the ground, only now realizing that Draco Malfoy had thrown a
By the way guys if you like my pain inducing stories you should totally read my Webtoon "Cruel But Beautiful", it's wack.
woooo new update! I'm really trying to make their feelings realistic, so sorry for the slowburn you guys
He quickly caught up though, shooting nervous glances towards all the peering elves around him. “They're not going to eat you, Malfoy.” Harry said teasingly, pushing his hands into his pockets, enjoying Draco's distress. “That's easy for you to say.” He grumbled, letting his bag fall on the table with a loud thud as they reached their destination. Hermione already gathering her curly hair into a massive ponytail “okay first, wash your hands! Come on!” She pushed the boys towards the sinks “roll up your sleeves! Malfoy stop being a baby.” She shouted while Draco whined. They all followed suit, returning to find her putting out all of the ingredients, her sleeves rolled up and her tie carefully folded on her bag, which was seated on a chair at the far end of the table. “Okay, the first thing about pie making, is the love you put into it!” She chattered  happily, Harry could practically hear Malfoy rolling his eyes “oh, too bad, it seems to be the one thing I'm lacking, time to go.” He said, already turning over to leave, only to be grabbed by a too quick Hermione. “Oh no. You're not leaving” she said, dragging him back to the table and holding him in place by the arm. “So, I'll hand you guys some tasks and you'll do them, this way we will finish quite quickly.” She spoke calmly, tightening her grasp when Malfoy tried to yank his arm away.
“Surely doesn't look like it" Ron elbowed his side exchanging mischievous looks with Hermione, Harry completely ignored them
“Today we will be making a growth potion, usually used in gardening” slughorn scribbled down the recipe his neat handwriting filling up the board “ you have one hour to complete it, good luck!” With the clap of his hands, the whole classroom filled itself with movement, everyone grabbing the cauldrons and their well needed ingredients, Draco is great with potions, he remembers the confront he got from chopping down the ingredients, creating something new, something useful
Lord have mercy, haven't he suffered enough? “Stop. Just stop.” He begged, Potter quirked a single eyebrow. “You sure dude?I thought Drake suited you pretty well.”
in order to function like a normal human being?” Draco said, his voice groggy from the sleep he never reached thanks to a certain someone. But Potter didn't answer his remark like he usually does, instead, he repeated his question:
And as the green twisted in hate and turned, Draco turned into a little boy again. Rushing back home where he knew a mighty storm awaits him.
“I'd rather not, but I thought maybe…” he stretched out his hand more, Malfoy's eyes flickering between his hand and his face, Harry coughed awkwardly “maybe you'd want to be my friend?”  it looked like all the blood left Malfoy's face as he paled, his eyes wide. He said nothing, just looked at Harry's hand as if it was some kind of alien, Harry moved it a bit closer to him, because it was extremely awkward and also uncomfortable to be left hanging like that, for a second he wondered if Malfoy did that to repay him for the hand he hadn't accepted himself in their first year, he really hoped Malfoy's not that petty. Honestly he didn't knew what urged him to be Malfoy's friend all of the sudden, but also it felt weird if they weren't friends? Especially after all the shenanigans they went through while researching the Solus, even Hermione made up with Pansy, so why can't Harry do the same?
“Cut them up?! Are you mental? I will slice my finger off!” Now she was one one rolling her eyes, grabbing Malfoy by the shoulders and turning him sharply towards the basket, giving him a light slap on the nape, making him flinch. “Oh you will alright, you chop things for potions just fine.”
- he could still remember how their weight felt, and now he knows what caused them, yet, somehow, knowing the cause doesn't really make it better, but rather more familiar of a feeling: more bearable.
What did he do to deserve this kindness? Nothing, Draco’s done nothing in his life to deserve that, not from Potter, not from Longbottom, not from Pansy nor anyone else,how is that during his lowest points, kindness just comes to him? After a while of quiet sobbing Longbottom simply left, he had nothing to do with Draco anyway, yet he felt so devastated, so angry, he didn't even manage to thank him, to apologise.
Draco always wondered how Neville Longbottom ended up a Gryffindor, his whiny and weak demeanor always made him look like he was cut out to be a Hufflepuff, nothing about his teary eyes and shaky knees was brave, he was just there, as if the sorting hat made some kind of a mistake, always out of place, always so easy to pick on,  bullying Longbottom had always been a blast, especially Potter's angry reaction to that afterwards, but now, the war painted a different person in front of him, the Longbottom he saw now was strong, sitting right here next to him made Draco feel so...small.
"Wait. What?" Was all Draco said, staring at Harry openly. "What what?" Harry grumbled, his cheeks warming up. He felt like he was talking to an adolescent, or worse, Draco Malfoy.
“Guess you really don't seem to get tired of me don't you?” He frowned, giving in when they begin climbing on him “what are you anyway? What do you want?” He spoke, as if they could understand him, kneeling down, he stared at a smaller blob besides him, it's legs were very short and they were more chubby ( or fluffy??) Their face flat with a couple of horns peeking out, it seemed like they had a pair of tails as well,he sighed, reaching out his hand to touch the creature “you know, that would've been nice if you'd at least talked..”  as his palm got closer, the creature seemed to notice him, their white eyes narrowed at him before it suddenly leaped onto his hand, sinking their fangs deep into it “ah fuck!” he yelped, pushing the creature off while he fell on his arse, rubbing his hand angrily
“He sure does” Harry said, it has already became their casual conversation during breakfast, Draco Malfoy comes in the morning, his skin paler than yesterday, with dark circles under his eyes, his usually tidy hair looked like he didn't even bother, blond locks sticking out his sides, he would sit down but never eat, not that Malfoy was Harry's source of attention, he never really paid him any thoughts after the war, but he did notice that Malfoy wasn't eating, another thing he noticed however, were the creatures  clinging to Malfoy's back, bullying him on a daily basis, serves him right, Harry thought at first, but then he started noticing them more, sitting on Draco's head during lessons, messing up his potions, covering his eyes during transfiguration, no one besides Harry noticed them, they just assumed that Draco Malfoy suddenly became 'fidgety’ , Harry could clearly see that those creatures messed up with Malfoy's temper
Getting out of bed was an easy task. Harry's step was easy with hope and excitement, almost as if he had just woken up to a Christmas morning at the Burrow. Awaiting presents from the only family he had ever known. Ron kept giving him these looks, which Harry easily ignored. It was easy with his good mood. When he reached for his cologne his best mate scrunched his nose "it's Malfoy isn't it" he said, giving him a tired look from where he was seated on his bed. "What? No" Harry said, his smile giving him away. "It's definitely Malfoy! You hadn't touched this bottle ever since Hermione gave it to you last Christmas!" Ron said, pointing at the slightly dusty bottle in his hand, Harry simply shrugged and sprayed himself, coughing slightly from the sharp smell. "I do use it, on occasion"
AARRGHHH FINALLY I FINISHED THIS CHAPTER!! This one honestly took so long to write! Eventually it got too long so I had to cut it in half:( but here's a 9.7 k update for all you patient souls!
Zabini’s gaze narrowed at him “ help?? Why would you of all the people-” he exclaimed but was cut off by Pansy’s hand landing in his shoulder, her eyes wet “what do you know?” She says, her voice quiet but desperate, it was clear as day that she cared about Malfoy a whole lot, more than she cares about her pride
“So, how is your school year going?” Draco sipped his own tea,a lame attempt to avoid the question in a polite way, but her gaze was terrifying, as if she could read Draco like an open book, she already knew the answer she was searching for “why do you ask?” his words turning into a quiet mumble under her gaze,he coughed uncomfortably “i mean, studying and stuff” her sharp eyed never left him, as if she was slowly but surely peeling his defense in order to see what she wants to see “is that what you really think?” that question caught him off guard, she sighed “we can skip the talk, i know the weather outside is nice, so how about you tell me while you’ve been skipping all your classes” Swallowing hard, Draco spoke “you made a mistake bringing me back”  he wasn't sure what about this sentence was so painful, but it was, he knew that already, yet saying it out loud felt like making it real
And there it was, curvy thick black lines, though faded now, but still, as clear as day marking the shape of a snake and a skull, Voldemort’s mark. Potter did not ask before touching it, his careful fingers just brushed against the skull, trailing it's faded lines. A shiver ran across Draco's skin, usually the mark was touched only to summon
My cat has been diagnosed with severe anemia and was on the brick of death this week. He is my best friend and I hope he makes it through.
Harry stared at the darkening sky, mostly because it's the only thing he could do while being pinned down to the ground by a bunch of heavy (and deadly) creatures. “I really am sorry, Draco” Harry said in a tone that  he could describe as no other than kissup, desperate for Malfoy to forgive him and also release him from all of this damn weight. “Sod off Potter, don't go using my name now.” Malfoy huffed, folding his arms over his chest, clearly sulking. “You didn't mind it in the room of requirement.” Harry stated matter of factly, tensing up as Malfoy shot him a quick glare, already taking a deep breath to prepare himself for suffocation Harry was rather surprised when Malfoy just softened up, his eyes darting back to the water “it was different..” he muttered, his voice so quiet Harry barely heard it. He didn't say anything after that, his words leaving a void for uncomfortable silence. Harry sighed, really wishing Draco would scold him more, heck, even shove a Solus up his face again, anything to replace this quiet, shattered Malfoy.
There was a sigh, softness replaced by evident annoyance. "You're terrible." Draco said, turning sharply without waiting for Harry to follow, as if he knew that he would, that git.
“Oh hey” Ron mumbled at him shyly, looking a tad awkward from his presence, Harry quirked an eyebrow at him “what's wrong?”
“I'm- I'm a death eater.” He said,his hand gripping the sacred arm tight, reminding himself what's there.
Even at the Slytherin table people kept their distance, and honestly? This is fine, it just meant they're getting more food anyway
“Maybe we miss them” Harry said, sharing knowing looks with the two “yeah, maybe we do, so we're desperately searching for something unusual to do” Ron's freckles danced around his face as his lips curved into a sly smile “even if it's Malfoy”
Small feet padded through the empty halls, reflecting upon the smooth marble. Draco felt incredibly tiny with the high ceilings accompanied by wall length paintings of his ancestors, or so he was told. Watching him quietly with their ice cold eyes, but Draco was too excited to fear them right now. He let his memory lead him down the dim lit halls until he reached a dark wooden door with a soft line of light seeping from under it. Getting on his tiptoes Draco reached for the handle, pushing the cold metal softly as the warmth of the room enveloped him.
! and I personally do not want to return there!” People were dropping their gaze, anyone would find it more soothing to face the floor than the all mighty Potter, the one who defeated him who must not be named, deep down, everyone knew he was right
Draco rubbed at his temple, wondering how Granger managed to spend 7 years with this walking headache.  “Look Potter it's not like I'm going to fuck you there, don't be so fucking dramatic.” He wanted to slap him, and then himself, and also cut his tongue off for saying such a
She clapped her hands together, humming “great! I need a tad of help with carrying some text books, could you help me young gentleman?” he was startled from her question, lifting his gaze before looking down again “uh-yeah sure” he said, a bit uncertainly.
“Your family was bad huh? Yeah. On that I agree, did you know Malfoy? You're not the only one who had suffered. Your aunt, Bellatrix, did you know? How she
"Merling stop smiling like a creep!" His daydreaming session halted as Ron smacked his head. "I can't believe I'm missing breakfast over this." He said, making Harry's head whip towards his alarm clock. "Wait wha- we've missed breakfast?!" Grabbing the clock Harry stared at it with mild disbelief. Damn, he hoped he'd get to see Draco before lessons start, maybe snog him a bit.
“I didn't even say anything!” She exclaimed, and Pansy snickered besides her. “That's it, we're making pie.” This time, Weasley was the one to react, finally lifting his head from his plate while chewing a mouthful of pie “huh? What're we duin?” He asked, and Draco flinched with disgust, don't they teach them manners in the Weasley house? Hermione didn't mind, patting her boyfriend on the back “we will sneak into the kitchen! The house elves love me there, I'm sure they'll help.” Draco had to say one or two things about this situation. first, why the hell would they sneak into a kitchen swarming with house elves? Second, by the way both Potter and Weasley looked at her, Draco found it hard to believe that house elves actually like her, more like the opposite if he were to talk.  “Oh cool!” Weasley said after he finally swallowed, everyone else didn't seem as excited. “Well... there's no need for a thousand of people to make pie so….” Pansy said, casually sliding off her seat “yeah.” Blaise blurted out, standing up and leaving as if he never sat there, when Draco was about to do the same, he was unlucky being within arm reach of the woman, who immediately grappled him and pushed him down to his seat. “Well then, more pie for us.” Hermione smiled sweetly, and Draco already regretting his choice of friends.
After the long and agonizing History of magic lesson, Harry fetched his two best friends leading them down their well known road to Hagrid’s hut
Heya! This chapter is super important and I'm very proud of how it turned out, this whole chapter is Harry's POV, enjoy!
“Yeah!! There!!” Draco pointed at the growling creature yet Pansy simply rose her eyebrow at him “there's nothing there Draco.”  She said.
The proud woman stood before him, her hands folded neatly behind her back, her iconic bun pulling her hair so tight it might actually show her skull, she was wearing a beautiful olive colored velvet robes, matched with a witch hat, she looked at Draco just like she looked at everyone, with her nose pointed high as if it's a given that she is certainly better than everyone, which is true.
Realization dawned upon gray eyes like closed sky, Harry seriously wanted to punch him when Draco started to chuckle, but all his anger melted when Draco's stiff expression softened, the corners of his mouth tilting slightly. "I'm not angry at you Potter." He said.
But god, has he missed these halls, the halls they all grew up in, the halls some of their friends had to make their grave.
“I will go now” he whispered, letting his hands fall, she squeezed once more before letting go, suddenly leaving Draco feeling cold
His eyelids grew heavy as his mind slowly drifted to sleep, the cool room contrasting against Potter's warm body besides him, his breathing has calmed down a while ago, perhaps he's already in deep sleep. A part of him wondered what Potter dreamed about, was it the war or the love of his friends? They all dreamed about the war, hellish nightmares of the screams, crimson red blood dripping in the halls, dear friends long gone, only the lucky ones don't experience nightmares, but the ones that got it the hardest are the the people that don't dream at all, those who have nothing left to dream about.
I had always headcannoned that Draco can play the piano, it only suits him right??? The song used is a song called "Home" from the RWBY soundtrack, it's super beautiful and the moment I heard it I imagined this scene, here's a link if you want to hear it!
“I hate you!!” He shouted, feeling familiar fangs clutch into his shoulder, “I hate you!!” weight pulling him down into the floor, maybe if he will cry hard enough
Shuddering, Draco nodded “yes, I do not belong here, not anymore” his grip on the cup tightened as he felt her heavy gaze on him, shutting his eyes tight, he reassured himself with the cups warmth
“Guys, I'll go and talk with Parkinson” Harry said, feeling his friends gape in his direction, Hermione frowned and Ron simply looked at the Slytherins, and then back at Harry, back and forth before he went on: “ at least I think I should, I'm not sure..”  Harry Mumbled, out of his best friends Hermione's glare was the most concerning, she had an awful history with Pansy, just like Harry and Draco did, perhaps she didn't want Harry to reason with her bully, which was totally understandable
Me appearing half a year late with an another 9.7 K chapter before I vanish again? It's more likely than you think.
In his head there were loud sounds. He could not pinpoint them quite yet. As his vision was blurry while he rushed. Rushed as far as his legs could carry him. A few sharp turns, a flight of stairs. Draco found himself staggering through the dim lit dungeons. His breathing wheezing loud and irritating in his ears. Unable to stop himself he crushed to his knees, one hand pushed against the wall as he panted. He was certain that he was sweating, even with the stone floor chill creeping up his knees through the thin fabric of his trousers. And yet, he wasn't here. As if floating. Waves upon waves of nausea hit him as Draco curled up into himself and shook, his breathing oddly sounding like cries. "Fuck!" He sobbed, his trembling hand yanking the cursed thing out of his pocket; his father's letter. Draco's vision darkened and all that was left for him was this piece of parchment and his father's neat handwriting. Why now? Why when he finally started to feel happy? He tore it, tore it into tiny little pieces before throwing it down onto the floor, his hands shooting up to grab at his hair.
“merlin Malfoy I'm just trying to help you!” Potter tried hard to stay calm, Draco was having none of that “I'm not some charity case for you to froster me Potter!!”
Even while sitting in the back the glares were piercing through his skull, he felt utterly uncomfortable, Draco found that dropping his gaze was much easier when the crowd of people is something uneasy to look at.
Draco froze, thinking whether he should brush it off as a joke, but Potter's glare was determined, he was totally serious. “Potter please, muggles are-”
“Do not. Call me Drake. Ever.again.”  Draco said, jabbing a finger at his chest. Doing his best to show Potter how pissed he actually is. “Then how am I going to call you?” Potter pouted, Draco wished earth would open up and eat him.
“You are a fucking menace!” He heard Malfoy shout at his side before he grunted in pain again, feeling an another creature being thrown at his stomach “Mal’phoy- shtop!!” Harry whined, scrambling his hands to try and lift up the Solus off his face, he felt his pulse queaken as he failed to breathe, his head buzzing from the pain of the fall.
“No.” She said coldly, snapping her book shut. “But why??” Harry whined, trying his best attempt in the world's-most-annoying-puppy-eyes Draco had ever seen in his life. “Because you're supposed to do it alone Harry, I've already helped you with your charms essay, you're on your own here buddy.” Potter just whined, running a hand through his mess of a hair, Hermione softened a little “oh come on Harry, it's not that bad. Besides, Draco is brilliant with Potions too.” She said, and he noticed at the corner of his eye how Weasley sent him a nasty glare, what's his deal anyway? He had no time to think this over however, as Potter shifted his puppy eyes from Granger to him “Draco! Buddy!” he exclaimed, and somehow he felt a jolt of annoyance swirl in his belly, together with a weird hot feeling gathering in his cheeks “me? Helping Potter? Never in a lifetime.” He said smugly, enjoying how the Gryffindor boy gasped “I thought I was your friend now!”
Yay! Romione date next update! I've been wanting to write this part ever since I thought about writing this story a year ago, I'm excited to hear what you think!
use magic “but they're heavy” he complained, McGonagall rose her eyebrow at him, her gaze not quite focused on  his face, but on something else “heavy? Well you unlike any other should be used to some extra weight” she remarked, a sly smirk appearing in her face before she left the classroom, leaving Draco frozen there
“Last year” McGonagall’s voice broke the chatter “was hard for all of us, but even when the darkness seemed to overthrow us, none of you lost hope” her eyes reflected the thousands of students with pride, she tightened her grip on the glass “we lost many, and it's still hard” Harry  saw Ron flinch in the corner of his eye,Hermione pulling his closer  “but today, you all are no longer war heroes, you're no longer victims, here, at Hogwarts, you can be just children, just my precious students”  McGonagall placed her glass on the teacher’s table before pulling her wand out
Without saying a word, Longbottom flopped down right besides him, pushing his knees closer to his chest, Draco gaped at him confusion clear on his face, when he opened up his mouth to speak, Longbottom cut him off
"..yeah." the blond sighed, looking down at him with dizzy eyes. Harry kept his gaze there, not caring for any possible first year that might pass through. If someone sees, they'd better enjoy the sight, since what Harry was doing now was claiming what's his. And everyone in school should know it. Know that only he can make Draco look this disheveled, his lips swollen from the time Harry pulled them between his teeth, hair messy because he ran his hand through platinum locks. Who would've known, that the look of hatred the blond once sent his way could bloom into such softness.
I did a complete re-read of this story so expect some typos fixing in the future! I feel so embarrassed by them please be kind to me I don't have a beta reader and have dyslexia so writing and reading stuff is extra hard for me, again, thank you so much for your patience. I love this story with all my heart and am excited to share it with you each and every time.
no less, he quickly turned back, looking down at his pillow like his life depended on it. Harry Potter, the savior of the wizarding world and also a famous prick, is changing right here, in his room.  Draco shouldn't panic as much as he does, they're both boys, nothing new here. He doesn't bat an eyelash when Blaise changes here, but when it's Potter suddenly his face just
"I'm sorry- was it too much? I should've asked." Harry blurted immediately, stepping back to give Draco space who in turn coughed nervously. "No! no." He panted, taking a swift step back. "It's okay, I- I don't mind you touching me" frankly, Harry found it quite hard to believe. Since Draco's wonderfully flushed cheeks paled immensely. "Are you okay?" Harry frowned, noticing how for the first time today how restless the Solus on Draco's shoulders are. "Yes! I'm okay- I'm just-" he looked around himself frantically, noticing the scattered pile of books at his feet. "I suddenly remembered the library is about to close so.. I need to go, see you later." He blurted, immediately shooting to his knees to collect his things. "I can help you!" Harry rushed to kneel down as well, but Draco avoided his eyes like boiling water. Harry reached forward, taking his hand gently. "you don't look okay at all." He said, his eyebrows furrowing. "I said I'm okay!" Draco snapped, yanking his wrist away from Harry's sharply before softening with a sigh. "Really." To that the Gryffindor could only frown in confusion, trying very hard to push down his growing concern. "If.. if you say so." With a little smile Draco gathered the rest of his books. Harry said smile, but it looked more like a squirm, all of his facial muscles tense and uncomfortable. There really was something wrong with him today, was there a piece of parchment in Draco's pocket? If so, why would he be so stressed about it? About Harry finding out what it is? Well trained suspicion curled in his stomach, but Harry forced himself to shake it off. No, Draco was different now. They were friends, maybe something more. In spite of himself Harry trusted him. So no, he wasn't suspicious, just curious.
And on that sweet fucking note (again.) , the group dissolved agreeing that it's an issue for an another day. Draco was glad to escape the library, spending so much time in there was suffocating especially with the weird tense air that has been going on between him and Potter. Did something happen? Draco wondered. Shooting glances at the Gryffindor throughout their whole meeting, Potter seemed to be strictly avoiding his gaze,  perhaps he's imagining things, he and Potter had been exchanging notes just a couple hours ago, and it was fun! Then what's wrong? Deciding that thinking about the burdening weight on his back would be too heavy for now (literally) he approached Harry.
Their road to platform nine and three quarters was carefully painted with the countless footsteps every aspiring witch or wizard that ever went there, to Hogwarts, the magical place
“Why do you look so tired?” Snape asked, Draco shook his head weakly “it's- hard..” he mumbled, suddenly feeling weak under the painted gaze
"Wingardium Laviosa." He said, his voice a bit shaky. But just as it did under his covers, the quill rattled slightly before lifting gently in the air. "It is not perfect, of course." Draco said, turning to his father with a practiced smug expression, though on the inside he was shivering with excitement. "But I assure you Father! I'm going to be better than everyone else when I finally arrive at Hogwarts." Pointing his wand down the quill lowered, splashing the ink only slightly. A chuckle slithered its way out of his father's chest as stared at the ink splatter slowly seeping into his table. "Your form is all wrong, of course." He mused, tilting his head back. "A wizard should not hesitate with his spells Draco." His eyes fell on him, and Draco squirmed. "But... Undoubtedly...you will be the best student to ever attend Hogwarts." He said, his lips curling into a proud smile, making Draco want to leap up and hug him. He stopped himself however, knowing his father was not one for physical affection, so Draco simply nodded. "I.. want to be a brilliant wizard like you, father." He said, his voice reeking of pride. It was true. Ever since he was little Draco stumbled behind his father's proud strides, watching with awe as the man spoke with others at parties and business meetings. Most of all he loved when that powerful man presented Draco as his son, the only heir of the Malfoy family. And strangers would look and gawk at him, showering the boy with attention and praises. Claiming that he looks just like his father, that he will surely make him proud.
"You will be." Lucius spoke without a hint of doubt, looking his son over as if he was a difficult piece of puzzle for him to decipher. "It is in your blood." He said, turning his face to look at a tapestry hung on the opposite wall, similar to the one in his aunt's place, though made with much more intricate design, silver thread glimmering magically against the thin tree trunk like veins. "The Malfoy family is made of the best of Wizards, the blood that runs through you is a mix of two powerful wizard families. It is pure and true, and it is filled with magic to the brim." He said, looking back at Draco. "you will not be like me, son." His eyes were cold, determined. And the boy almost withered from the mere sight of them. Not like him? But Draco wanted to be everything that has to do with him! Someone who is so grand and powerful, his heart ached from his father's words, making his shoulder slump. With a creak Lucius rose from his sofa softly, kneeling in front of him as a steady arm reached for Draco, planting itself on his shoulder with a firm grasp.
Stopping in front of the green pack made all the eyes turn to face them, Parkinson frowned at her sight but saying nothing, not that she would dare to be rude to a war hero, the air between them was so intense you could cut it with a butter knife, both of the sides staring intensely yet not daring to say a thing
"I can't believe it." Harry shook his head as he got off the broom and bent down. He inspected the circle, as far as he could see by the Lumos of his wand, the potions had spread. It went from just a small circle to an uneven patch, a few steps all around of dead land. No more critters or creepy crawlers and no more plants. "I thought Mrs. Dell'elion would do something!"
That night they arrived back at their home after they'd grabbed some take-away from an Italian place. Everyone in good spirits , Harry especially so. Madame Malkins had confirmed his hopes and said the order would take a while due holiday pressures. She did said that he could expect delivery before the end of the second week in January. She was very apologetic, taking pride in her fast services but Harry understood. He had thanked her profusely and now, at the dinner table, he kept forgetting to actually eat mind drifting back to the preparation process. He couldn't wait to finish up and leave England behind.
They landed on a small campsite. It was high up on the edge of a cliff and didn't have much. There was a tiny log cabin for those who hiked the trail, a water well, and a picnic table. Some stones in a circle to stoke a fire kept charred remains but didn't look as if it has been used recently.
"Dressing styles?" Harry asked as he moved to topple the book onto the stack Draco pointed at. The blonde nodded. "Clothing. Fashion through the ages. It's a serie."
"Imbicile." Was what Draco snarled at him when he'd finished telling and pointed to the books. "Start getting them out. We'll find the book that made the changes so we can undo them before we end up in actual real life danger and we can't have that. I need to get out of this ruddy chair to hex you before I die!"
"Morning." He mumbled, taking a seat across the two, where he immediately noticed how pale and tired Harry looked. He didn't get a reply but steeled himself either way when he spoke again. "We need to talk."
"I know, I know." Draco answered and their banter went on and on until Draco noticed the time. "Time for bed! We need to be up and ready early in the morning."
"What's this?" He stared in confusion at the card. It was green, with a print of a dragon, and the full name of the Sanctuary.
Draco nodded. Harry felt he did so as his chin thumped on top of his head and knocked Draco's elbow, by doing so, he was able to move his chair to the left and Draco moved to stand next to him, still staring at the writing. "I really can't read it."
Harry flew over to find it. His voice went more frantic as he tried to explain it but he hadn't spoken all of two words when Draco broke. He shouted. He never shouted but today, he couldn't do anything but to be out of character. "Calm down! I can't deal with this twice in a row, four-eyes!"
"We have a Mayor who can pass judgement I'd say," Charlie said after he thought about it for a while. "And maybe, if it's truly needed, one of his bodyguards can fill the role of muscle man. I'd say."
"No cursing," Andromeda gently kicked Harry's side. He looked up and mumbled a sorry, although he grinned and she smiled back. "Have fun." She said, a pointed look at the mess he just dropped on the floor.
"He's right though," Draco added. "Power abuse. They're focusing on the wrong crowd. There are still Death eaters on the run and they go after those pardoned just to make it seem they're trying to better the world.." He let his words linger, Harry and Andromeda filling in the rest as they understood. They weren't making process with those on the run, they were scared of the reflection on the Ministry. They had two camps on opposite sides going because really, people had accepted and simply didn't care but some were afraid of their image and pushed, creating the rotten situation Harry and Draco found themselves in that morning. It would be a long time before it was resolved.
Harry loved the garden, neat but wild and as he strolled through he enjoyed following the small animals about. He enjoyed it and childishly happy when a swarm of blue butterflies surrounded him. The slowly moved away and he followed, giggles escaping him whenever a Butterfly touched him.
"What the hell!?" Harry screamed and that effectively silenced everyone close. The Aurors took the split second to knock wands down, to petrify people left and right and generally clearing the area surrounding Harry and Draco. Harry never moved an inch.
"Nothing went wrong, Charles." A gruff voice with a thick, Russian accent barked through the door. "Zhanna is being her ditzy self again. The bleeding woman can't find the key."
Meanwhile, the voices grew impatient, louder and knocks on the door came in rapid. Draco gave it no heed, didn't even look but instead rushed over to the mirror. He looked and with some awkward bending retrieved the needle from his back, letting in dangle on its wire and donned his shirt. He was glad he choose black that morning, pinpricks of blood welling up and soaking in the material, he checked for his wand. "Here we go, I'll be right back." He said to Harry, who didn't hear him anyway. Too wrapped up in panic.
Oddly enough, Andromeda stepped into her study. Harry and Draco knew that was her space and while they were allowed in, they never did, leaving it and her bedroom for Andromeda to call her own and not to worry about a surprise with anyone stepping in.
"Sometimes." Draco said. They talked for a while, convincing Andromeda it wasn't that big of a deal until Draco picked up his forgotten present from the floor. He was about to tear the paper off when Andromeda stopped him.
Charlie threw open the door and gave a loud greeting then stepped aside to let Harry see in. The room was big with file cabinets and bookcases lining the walls, some comfortable couches and a rather large, round conference table. At the end of the room were two large desks set side by side and windows with a speak-through, windowless frame next to a door. A guy with white hair was leaning on the ledge, talking to someone on the other side. At the desk sat a girl, young but grey haired and where the guy was dressed to the nines is dress pants, white button up and a sleeveless vest, she was dressed very nonchalant in a jogging suit.
The rest of his sentence ended in a murmur and Draco hadn't heard. The blonde made it obvious by shouting angrily for the other to man up and say it already: "I know your a bloody Gryffindor! Scrape some courage up and tell me!"
And Harry sat there, atop of the tower thinking that moment over and he was so angry, felt so helpless. He was wobbling his legs back and forth and screamed. He screamed from the top of his lungs into the dark night "Why are they looking at us with blind eyes?!"
"Is it hatching?" Harry asked when they stood in front of an enclosure full of rocks, an bright grey, almost silver egg smack in the middle half way covered by coals. He wondered because the top was cracked.
"Turn them around, and open the back slot." Andromeda ordered when she noticed neither both had seen the small zippers. They did and both found some neatly folded clothes. Draco's being form fitted jeans, button-ups and a woollen vest; Expensive, semi-formal muggle wear, Draco noted. Harry's were different lengths of scuffed jeans with t-shirts and one set of formal clothes. He'd spied the last set in his bag but didn't take them out. He did, however, got up to hug Andromeda for a heartfelt thanks, and so did Draco.
It hadn’t been so funny when he had lost his grip of the two worlds he was straddling. When the diary had yanked him viciously under the currents of the dream to drown.
He was already the freak of the school this year, the boy who was possessed by the remnants of a Dark Lord killed years ago. He didn’t need everyone to know about his pathetic crush on Draco Malfoy too.
The Ancient Runes classroom was on the fourth floor, a large airy room decorated with several large windows facing the lake. On a day like this, an October afternoon, light was streaming into the classroom and pooling onto the stone floor. The Professor was already there, stood beside an open window, the breeze ruffling the voluminous sleeves of her emerald robe and the long strands of her russet hair. She turned as they entered, smiling softly at them.
"It's pretty, isn't it?" Charlie asked. He clapped Harry on the shoulder and steered him towards an empty table by the window.
"Because I'm looking at everything to see where I do want to go?" Harry answered in a question, as if Draco was the not grasping it.
Harry was walking through the bookstore. He'd chosen the aisle where Hermione's favorite book, The History of Hogwarts was housed in the hopes of finding a similar book. He couldn't find it. Most were small pamphlet books on the rack about the curriculum of Hogwarts, mostly designed for when was choosing extra subjects in thrid and fifth year. A boat that had long sailed. Harry searched further, when he curiously pulled a thin, purple covered book from the shelf.
"I do know that he doesn't want to depend on them so heavily even if he should and he is apparently so, of opinion, that being here he doesn't come in a situation where he does need them. Except, just now. When you arrived. I wasn't sure if it was you but when it did turn out to be you, I had hoped, things would go smoother than they did, but they didn't. The shouting match, followed by the duel, shot adrenaline through Harry's body, with my intervention, he relaxed. I don't blame you, or him," She threw a thumb at Harry. "I don't blame myself, but! That, is what made his heart stop."
"Meda and I were just discussing an five course dinner of fancy foods you probably can't pronounce," Draco said and then whispered for only Harry to hear. "You plebeian."
Draco annoyingly tapped it away and Harry laughed when he saw Draco's hair was messed up. "Me learning to be cultured is the reason you know, I never been out of England, hell, I barely even saw much of England, can't learn without going anywhere you know?!"
Luckily, when he reached Peony Patch the light was on, so Charlie must've ended his shift. He walked inside and was greeted happily by Charlie. He was watering his plants. "I've been back for a while, what have you been up to?"
Gavriil dashed around grabbing papers left and right as he let his guests take in their surroundings, Zhanna no where to be seen.
"I actually came to pick you up, it's not everyday you best mate gets accepted into Auror training so I thought we have a little party and stuff. It's a good thing I did though," Ron grinned and patted Harry on the shoulder, indicating he was done tugging his clothing. "So, how did it go? We are celebrating, right?"
"It's a good thing, you won't get paid, then. But-" Bernadette held her hand out. "If you don't want it?"
heavy pile of books to run after her “professor wait!” He panted heavily as he reached her at the end of the hallway, following her footsteps in a quick pace “what did you mean by that?” He tried hard to keep looking at her, but the creatures found a perfect timing to climb on his face and tug at his hair during the time his hands are occupied, bloody hell, but McGonagall didn't answer, instead she just reached the headmistress office door instead, whispering 'apple cider’ for the Gryffin door to reveal it's magnificent stairs “come” she murmured as she already walked up the stairs and Draco helplessly followed, his hands hurting horribly, who would ever lift such weight from their own accord? Draco held himself back from whining, which he failed when he realized they had to go up an another set of stairs.
“Magic” Ron smirked, while still staring at the repaired walls in disbelief, but his running eyes locked on a certain blond figure, the sight made Ron frown immediately, Harry felt a sharp pain in his elbow “ouch Ron wha-” Harry was cut off by the redhead grabbing his face and turning him to look at a small pack of green, snuggled together between all the other house colors
What do you do when you face a shattered soul? How do you help someone after being one yourself? Harry looked around his friends, they've always been there for him, supporting him through good and bad, Malfoy was no friend of his, which means he shouldn't be so frustrated, yet he is.
, how ironic is that the boy who lived would he touching it now?. “Huh.” Harry said, his intense green eyes following the lines with deep concentration “I thought it would feel more like a scar, but your skin is smooth.”  Draco wanted to laugh, to mock him for such an awful remark, but he didn't, his eyes focusing on the famous lightning bolt instead. He never understood how everyone always recognized Potter for such a small thing, there it is, barely seen under Potter's bush of a hair. Yet this scar was the thing to define him, the legendary Harry Potter, the chosen one.
here we are at the beginging of the pininng and the character growth stay tuned for the wizard boys to suffer but also fall in love can't wait
Daring to look around himself he recognized the abandoned girls bathroom, the same he used to go to when he desperately needed to cry, it's ironic, finding himself there again at times of distress, he could lock himself up in here and no one wouldn't care, the thought felt like a stab in his chest
Draco froze, his quill not moving, he felt uneasy lying to his poor mother, but telling her the truth will only hurt her more, she was very broken after the war, the strong and all mighty Narcissa Malfoy became a weak and vulnerable woman, he felt like telling her about the glares and the bullying, about the creatures, it will only be more of a burden, so he tightened his grip, took a deep breath and continued writing:
Hope you enjoyed this chapter! I really like making apple pies, but I never eat them because I don't like the texture of baked apples:( it is nice to make others happy though.
“Draco come on” Blaise called, he also returned to Hogwarts, but his parents drove him to Hogsmeade so he didn't have to suffer catcalls on his way to school.
“A sweet tooth I sea” McGonagall chuckled, Draco felt his cheeks go red, he should've went with no sugar at all, but he's a mommy's boy, and his mother always spoiled him.
“I think he's possessed by some sort of creature, making him aggressive”Parkinson stared at him analyzing his reply “and you can help?”
“O-oh…”  the light on her face died down, eyebrows curling in concern “how did you even manage to fight with him after offering him help? That's a talent I tell ya”  Ron folded his arms over his chest, raising an eyebrow skeptically, groaning Harry glared at his wand “well he won't be needing any help so, we can leave all the Solus thing now”  he muttered through gritted teeth
He should show this sketch to Hermione, maybe research a little bit, perhaps there will be something about these creatures in the library, he could ask Hagrid as well, he missed the man anyway, wouldn't hurt to pay him a visit.
"I know I know!" Draco said, running a hand through his hair to push it back, he liked mimicking his father. So he straightened his back and rose his nose high, reaching for the table to fetch his father's wand. "But I wanted- I wanted to show you something! Can I use your wand?" Lucius frowned, looking upon Draco as if he is being a nuisance, but soon enough he withered. Sighing softly as he leaned back into his chair. "Have you learned a spell?" He asked, his eyes brighter now, hungry. "Since I will be going to Hogwarts soon, I thought I should be prepared Father." Draco said proudly, holding his father's wand with shaky fingers. It felt cold and heavy in his weak hands. Nevertheless he pointed it, just like he did with his mother's wand, though way more kind feeling in his grasp. Eyes focusing on the peacock feathered quill as he concentrated. Feeling the magic tickling the tips of his fingers. Taking a deep breath and stilling himself, Draco casted.
“Because they don't belong here!” Ron said, suddenly bumping into a little Slytherin, he looked like a second year, he definitely heard what Ron had said because his head dropped apologetically, tears already streaming down his face as he ran past them
“Y-yes! I love you like a table! I mean, I'll hold your stuff for you! Always there t-to support you you know? Strong and stable…” Ron bullshited his way through, and surprisingly it worked since Hermione's eyes teared up in seconds “oh Ron!” She leaped into his arms “that's the sweetest metaphor ever!” Ron laughed weakly at that, mouthing 'i have no idea how I did that’ to Harry.
It was an another set of footsteps that woken Draco from his daze,his eyes fixating in a tall figure, eyes widening, Draco almost choked, Longbottom was standing right in front of him, something wrapped up tightly in his hand, it looked like he arched his back and poofed out his chest, since he looked much taller than Draco remembered, his eyes scared and uncertain, but equally determined.
They just bonded, walking in their small group whenever they went, they would be safe that way, Pansy already sat down for breakfast, sitting in a far corner, funnily no one sat down next to her nor in front of her, leaving them a safe food Haven.
A black blob like creature was making itself comfortable on his shoulder,it didn't look like an animal, yet had four legs and claws we're definitely tugging his shirt, their white eyes were wide and dangerous, he yelped standing up with a jolt, the thing fell of his shoulder and hissed
Happiness flooded his lungs like fresh air he didn't know he was missing, it's so good to be back, so good to be home.
Eighth years shared all their lessons together, making each period a practical mess, their classroom filled up quickly, Draco has taken his seat in the back of the class long before everyone arrived from breakfast, well, since he skipped it.
After a long minute of clearly debating whether he should take his hand or not, Malfoy reached out, shaking their hands a bit awkwardly, Harry sighed with relief “that's great! Now we could- er, Malfoy?” Harry tried to take his hand back, only to realize that Malfoy has tightened his grip around it, not letting him go “um… I would really like my hand back?” He chuckled nervously, Malfoy no longer looked confused, his expression turning into a glare “uh… Mal-ah!” Harry couldn't finish his sentence suddenly feeling his body jerk forward with a pull from Malfoy's side, and before he knew it, he was falling face down into the water.
Draco leaped out of his seat, still unsure of how to feel, followed the woman through the room nonetheless, and there he was, right in the corner, his greasy long hair and boring expression just like he remembered, McGonagall’s hand pushed him closer softly, nodding at him before leaving them alone.
Draco quickly pulled his pajama shirt on, a silk long sleeved nightshirt so long it could work as a dress, while he might’ve used it as a night dress when he was little, he isn't as shameless now.  “You commented on how I always wear only my house colors, while you are wearing red boxers yourself. That's why you're a hypocrite.” He finally turned to face Potter, who still stared openly at his wrist as if trying to understand what exactly happened there, his mouth hanging open. When he noticed Draco was watching him he snapped it shut however, careful green eyes fixating on his face, even though Draco could clearly see them snapping back to his hand every couple of seconds. “I- I'm not a hypocrite! I'm sure all of your underwear is green.”
“Ron just can't be romantic!” Hermione exclaimed folding her arms over her chest, pouting. Oh, it's their usual bickering, since Ron and Hermione started dating, Harry felt more of a family psychologist than a shared friend, and as the savior of the wizarding world, he has to rescue their relationship as well
He stared at his lunch, this time they were seated in the Slytherin table, Pansy was chattering about something with Hermione per usual- which alone is a weird thing to say, these two really get along recently. Weasley, sulking right next to his girlfriend, shoved so much food into his throat Draco wondered how the git stayed so skinny. Potter, who sat just besides his best friend, would shoot him curious glances once in a while, perhaps it's very easy to notice when Draco's unwell. “Draco! What do you think?” He blinked, only now realizing that Hermione has been addressing him “uh- what?” He chuckled, really hoping that she wasn't asking him a question. Granger rolled her eyes “as I was saying, I think Slughorn's last project is utterly ridiculous!! How am I supposed to write an essay about unicorn blood when I can't even get a sample!  All the books babble about their silver color, not their special effects on healing potions for God's sake!” She exclaimed frustratedly and a soft smile curved on Draco's face. Potions, yeah, that's a thing he knows about, they are much easier to handle than human emotions or the guilt of many years of torture, if there's one thing he would be good at, that would be potions. “Of course Granger” he sneered “that's why it's a project- you're supposed to research it, come to your own conclusions instead of copying from the book, duh.”
One of the creatures caught his gaze, their bright white eyes sending shivers down Harry's spine, for a second he feared their Slytherin owner would turn around as well and catch him staring, but he didn't.
“It's going to be fine…” she sobbed into his shoulder, reassuring herself more than him, and he let her, patting her back gently “it will” he breathed in her scent, lately she's been smelling warmer, very home like, a home that's within the manor's cold empty halls, he will miss her, he knows he will.
“This song…” Malfoy continued, lifting his chin just enough so it would rest on his knee, gray eyes mirroring the dark waters, the sky had already turned pink having the lake reflect today's last rays of sunshine. “It's a lullaby she used to sing to me… in order to calm me down after a nightmare.” Honestly Harry would never imagine that Draco Malfoy, a man raised by two rich wizards would ever have nightmares nor a single worry in his life. He didn't sleep in a cupboard under the stairs, growing up in great halls and marble floors instead, never had Malfoy known hunger or cold, his parents were alive and well, the Dark Lord didn't kill them by the mere age of 21, not ever getting the chance to send their son off to Hogwarts, a school both of them grew up and fell in love in. But after seeing Malfoy fall apart in the room of requirement like that, Harry knew for sure that even when you have money and breathing parents, nightmares will hunt you down as well.  Harry picked on a handful of grass, finding that he didn't quite know what to do with himself, so he plucked a bunch out, watching as numerous bugs scattered away from the rude invader of their grass home. “Why did you choose to sing it now?” Harry found himself asking, not daring to look up at the blond. “a funny thing isn't it?” Malfoy let out a humourless laugh “she sang it to me after calming down my father, and just when the screaming downstairs settled, she would come and soothe me with a hoarse voice.” Harry didn't say anything, he felt like he had no place in Malfoy's story, so he let him talk.
Harry thought while coughing violently, feeling his lungs clench in pain, well fuck, he really is going to die.
"Harry? Hey Harry! Mate we're gonna be late!" A voice called out to him, but it was muffled. He didn't let it bother his dreams. "Harry you're missing breakfast! And I mentally cannot skip breakfast, I will never survive potions without it!" He saw someone, they were almost invisible against the snow. Just as white, yet not as cold. They had flesh and skin which were warm to the touch, and eyes that froze you in place. Harry knew this person, he enjoyed standing in this soothing nothingness around them, if only this annoying voice stopped talking… "that's it. Neville bring me my wand, I'm gonna aquamenti this bitch"
“And the reason we're not using magic is-” she continued, walking over to their side, taking the butter that Ron had previously cut and dropping it into the flour, digging her clean hands in and started kneading. “Because it feels more real that way, if there's one thing magic can't do, is to give you the fulfillment  you'd get if you had done it by hand.” She pushed into the dough, not caring to get some flour on her, when she saw that the hard part was done, she handed the bowl to Harry, who took her position. “Ron, pour the water in little by little while Harry does that, it will be easier that way” Hermione gave Ron a quick kiss on the cheek, leaving a bit of flour there, Ron just grumbled, pouring a bit of ice cold water into the mix. “When you're baking it really creates this special feeling..” Hermione sighed, a soft smile appearing on her face as if recalling a good memory, taking a second knife and beginning to peel apples herself, doing a way better and skillful job than Malfoy ever could. “You can just put all your worries and feelings into it, and then serve it to someone else on a platter.” Harry gaped at the green peel curling up as a thin long line as she ran her knife over the fruit quickly. “That is a good metaphor”  he pushed into his dough harder, wishing that with it he could push in some lurking thought as well. She hummed, “when I was little I used to think that if I put all my feelings into a pie, I could make something good and sweet out of it, and then all my problems would wash off the dirty dishes.” They all went quiet, probably thinking about all the problems they could shove in a pie, even Draco went quiet, peeling his apples in big clumsy chunks, a couple of Solus lurking on his back, and some walking on the table, trying hard to knock the knife out of his fingers. He sighed, grabbing his bowl and moving over to Malfoy's side, earning a quick glare from Ron. “ ‘Mione,go help your boyfriend, he seems to be struggling.” She rolled her eyes but smiled at the boy lovingly “you peel the apples then.” She said, grabbing the bowl out of his grasp “just so it won't be too easy.” And with a wink she went to make her beloved roll out the dough for her. “Came here to laugh?” Draco muttered, reaching to take an another apple from the basket, Harry couldn't help but chuckle softly “a bit.” He said, fetching one Solus off Draco's back, who immediately froze, his gray eyes looking at him, wide and questioning but Harry, despite his loud and very much beating heart, ignored the boy and instead placed the creature on his own shoulder, wincing at the weight as it snuggled up his neck. “What are you doing?” Draco might've tried to sound cold, but his voice was too overflowed with confusion and relief with the burdening weight on his back lifting up a little. Harry shrugged, getting to peeling his apples, feeling extremely aware of the Solus on his back and the gaze of it's questioning owner. “You won't get anything done with these buggers teasing you all the time” he pointed at the Solus chewing on Draco's finger “thought that if I can see them… I might as well help you with their weight and stuff..”
Normally, if you'd meet Harry before the war, he'd turn around and leave Malfoy to his misery, but suddenly, he couldn't
“Draco, you haven't been eating well at all, look at yourself..” Pansy's concerned voice followed him during breakfast as he tucked a piece of parchment safely onto an owls leg, he can't blame her, he really didn't eat much lately, the thing is, he doesn't know why he just doesn't seem to have an appetite, all he can think about is that nagging, tight feeling in his chest making everything around him utterly uncomfortable, and even though he knew that Pansy cared about him a lot, before he could think anything through, he spat at her “oh you're not my mother Pansy, mind your own shit” her expression was pained like Draco physically took a knife and stabbed her, it was getting tighter and tighter in Draco's chest, his empty stomach turning over, gasping slightly Pansy glared at him with wary eyes “but- Draco dear please-” her voice was shaky but trying, trying to reach out for her friend who bluntly refused to accept any help “it is none of your business Pansy.” he muttered, sharper than he intended, Pansy did not give in, reaching for his pale hand carefully “Draco I-”
His eyes locked on a raven haired figure, Pansy Parkinson was standing next to Blaise Zabini, her eyes were wet and her arms were folded neatly over her chest, her hair barely reaching the end of her face with a firm undercut underneath it, from her exasperated frown you could understand that she was probably ranting about something, Harry could guess what.
“Harry and Ron,I want you guys to make the batter. It's fairly easy, just make sure to keep the butter cold.” She walked up to them and pointed out the ingredients, sugar, butter, flour, and some water she got while they were washing their hands. She dragged Malfoy alongside her wherever she went to keep him from running away, and the boy made sure that everyone were aware of his discomfort. “Granger let me go I'm not a kid.”
“Well that won't be the first time” Luna tilted her head, her earrings tangling freely “do you think it's bad?”
“Look at that! A war criminal failing to keep his pawns at bay!” someone called out, with echoing laughter to follow them, but Draco didn't bother to see who, instead, he got up and left the great hall
Like a slap to the face Ron's spell was hard and cold, especially wet. Thrusting Harry from a beautiful dream to frustrated confusion as he opened his eyes with a slow groan, the warm sunlight of his dormitory making him squirm. "Whyyy" he whined, grabbing the closest object to him and whipping it at Ron, he missed. Damn, where are his glasses?
“What brought you here today? How's lessons?” he cupped the hot drink in his hands, sipping loudly  “they're nice” Harry took a sip himself, recalling all the boring lessons he had this week, Hagrid hummed, placing his now empty tea cup on his small wooden table  “Actually, we wanted to ask you something” Hermione said, placing her cup on her thighs, Hagrid looked at them sheer curiosity in his eyes, she continued “Harry has been seeing things lately, we think it's a kind of spirit” Hagrid’s eyes wandered between the three of them, carefully listening
Clenching his hands into tight fists, Draco kept his arms at his sides “no one is fluttering around me Longbottom.” He muttered, finding it easier to avoid looking into his eyes. Neville just laughed, a cold, dry laugh having no humor in it. “I can't believe you're saying this, I can't believe we're even having this conversation! You-” he shoved his finger harder, making Draco take a step back “you come to me saying sweet nothings! You're sorry? Yeah sure! You didn't look sorry when you pushed me down the stairs with those big friends of yours, you didn't look sorry when you screamed the name of the dark lord so proudly, saying how soon all of us will be bowing down at your feet.”
“Wait- Malfoy what are you doing?!” Potter whined, applying no force to actually resist him. “Taking you to my common room” Draco said simply, not having the patience to deal with his whining when Potter stopped sharply,  almost making Draco trip over his own feet.
And yet, he was allowed to walk this road again, he was privileged to study an another year with his classmates, with Pansy, oh how much he missed Pansy,and spending the whole year buried under the thick castle floors hiding in the dungeons with his fellow Slytherins seemed to be all worth it.
A wonderful flash of memories crossed his mind, and Harry reached for the sweater he wore yesterday absentmindedly, inhaling softly just to check if there were any remains of cologne that wasn't his. "W-why are you smiling like that?" Ron's said with a visible shudder. "Merlin please stop smiling like that, you look like a maniac!" Harry lowered the fabric blinking at the shape. "I'm not smiling." He said, biting down his smirk. "Yes you are!! And you should stop! Right now." His best mate said, reaching for the table and shoving his glasses on him rather violently. "Ow- Ron!" He whined, smacking his hand away. "It hurt you bastard!" He said, glaring at his friend (which he thankfully can see now) Realizing that Ron was wearing a very disappointed expression. "Something clearly happened yesterday." He said, Harry had to fight his urge to smile again. Yesterday he and Draco kissed. No, Draco kissed him. And let him kiss back when Harry wanted to. His heart tugged at the memory of the blond giggling against his lips, showing a soft side that made Harry want to climb a mountain or something stupid like that. But the stupidest part was how happy Harry felt, recalling the memory as if it was recorded on tape. He liked him, liked him so much it hurt
The creature simply glared straight into his eyes making him feel uncomfortable, like their gaze brought uneasy weight on his back.
my mother to oblivion? being cruel enough not to kill her, leaving an empty shell of a woman who won't even recognize her son!” a memory of his own mother flashed in front of his eyes, hitting his face like a splash of ice cold water. Her warm fingers soft yet determined on the keys as she taught him piano, her loving voice guiding while he tried to follow his mothers steps, he hated that he thought about her during such a moment, was she still there? All alone in muggle London, her beautiful hands bony and without color, she waited for her son to return, writing him frequent letters, showing him how she's still here, hoping her son remembers her warmth even when he's far away. Draco swallowed hard, noticing how Neville's hand dropped from his chest, and now hanged heavily at his sides like two shaking bags of flesh. “It's not fair. For you to stand here, for you to laugh together with Hermione who you once called a mudblood! And with Ron… and Ginny! Have you ever wondered how they felt? For you to be alive and breathing while their brother died fighting in these halls?!”  Oh. He remembered him, that Weasley twin, he saw his face in the newspaper once, as part of a long list of names, containing rows upon rows of Hogwarts students who died in the war, he came across it only because he was searching for Crabbe, his name wasn't included in the list.
"You called me Harry before." He said, and Draco's jaw snapped shut, mouth forming into a thin line.
Luna hummed,her bracelets tangle together making a soothing noise as he moves “why wouldn’t it be?” her answer was so simple yet so right.
Falling into a quick pace he followed in a direction he assumed Neville would take, noticing movement right around the corner.  Taking bigger steps he took a sharp turn, seeing Neville's back just a few meters away from him “Longbottom!” He shouted, running up to him as the Gryffindor stopped, only now Draco noticed that his shoulders are tense, as if he's expecting a beating, his heart dropped when he realized this might be his fault. “Um.”  Draco felt uncomfortable talking to him, especially since he didn't really feel like apologizing to Neville Longbottom. But he promised Harry to be good or something, so he better give it a chance. “I'm sorry, you know, for everything” Draco said, scratching the back of his neck. Neville, who still stood with his back facing him, didn't speak for a while, but he did turn around, his eyes not angry nor hurt, just tired.  He looked apathetic, like Draco's words mean nothing to him, maybe they did.
Luna pursed her lips, placing her finger on them softly, humming, after a minute of thinking she smiled “you're saying you don't know, but you already made the first move didn't you? No matter what your heart sees, who you're seeking to help has to decide for themselves if they accept it,you cannot help those who don't want it” she placed her hand on his shoulder, squeezing “all feelings, just like spirits, appear for a reason” he wasn't sure what in her words did it, but Harry felt fresh air coming through his nose, filling up his lungs
“I didn't know you could play the piano.” Harry said, after the Solus disappeared Malfoy had no intention of staying in the burned room. He let his fingers linger on the milky colored keys for mere seconds before stroding off with a quick pace, and in a loss of what to do, Harry followed. They ended up seated on the green grass right by the dark lake, Malfoy being curled up to himself, his head hanging between his knees with a few platinum blonde strands falling on top of his face. Malfoy just shrugged, his shoulders quirking up as he did so. “My mother taught me how to play when I was little” he admitted, the air was still tense between them, Harry had no idea why Malfoy wanted him, of all people, to be the one to see him in such a vulnerable state. Harry didn't deserve it, not to hear Malfoy playing nor to see how Crabbe had shown him his farewell, he never had the right to see how beautiful to Solus were when they bloomed, not after all he said.
The both of them just stood there. At least there was one thing they could always be similar at, they don't know how to talk about important things such as their feelings, and very much prefer just standing there, getting angry at their problems instead of solving them.
“We came back to school, it has been hard, but let's not make it harder, make it a happy year..Please”
"Stop making a face, you're souring my juice." Hermione said, sipping her orange juice with a distasteful expression."I'm not making a face." Harry said, his frown deepening at the vacant seat besides Pansy. "You are. Do you want my stew or something? You've been staring at it like it has personally hurt you." The Slytherin girl said, pushing her bowl closer to herself. "Well it's mine, the only person who can steal my food if Draco."
Why Neville was picked for Gryffindor? The answer is simple, his bravery is not showcased in loud acts and unforgettable fights, even though he cried a lot,feared everything, Draco realized:
One was short, way too small for his age. But his eyes had the warmest shade of green. And that man smiled at him, opening his arms for an embrace.
Harry reached for his bag, pulling out a cramped piece of parchment “I sketched it” he said, showing Hagrid his drawing, the half giant took the piece eying it carefully, suddenly smiling “a spirit it is, I'm not quite sure but it looks like a Solus”
“Why me?” he said before Draco finished the sentence “that's the only thing I want to know.” Neville took a step forward, his apathetic expression turning angry “why, out of all the people you could make miserable- you chose me?”. His throat went dry, how is he to explain himself? Neville has always been the weakest link, a tiny whiny little boy who couldn't defend himself against anyone. He has to admit bullying Neville has made him feel…powerful. “I- I had a hard time, back then.” he said simply, but Neville just frowned “oh I've heard all about it. Those creatures on your back or something, giving you a hard time! How interesting. Draco Malfoy starts caring about the people around him only when he starts suffering!”  that's not true, he wanted to say, to shout even. How dare he accuse me of such things when I'm trying to apologise? Draco wondered to himself, gritting his teeth to the sight of the angry Gryffindor. The Solus on his back hissed loudly, making this overall experience a huge headache, taking a deep breath he tried again. “Listen.. my father abused me okay?” He felt a shiver run down his neck, but he went on “I was angry so I took it out on people! I'm different now.” He said, not entirely believing it.
Out of everyone Potter was the only person he just couldn't face, and him snapping at something that wasn't actually
But Malfoy was not having it of course, blowing off on Harry like that, he actually thought he matured since his sixth years, turns out he didn't really, in seconds he realized how much of mess Malfoy really is, and he had no patience to deal with it
She completely ignored him however, telling them how they need to mix the ingredients in a bowl and then pour some flour on the table, kneading the dough before it all sticks together and becomes rather elastic. “Hermione my hand hurtsss” Draco sighed dramatically in the background, his other hand displayed against his forehead dramatically as if he's some damsel in distress. Harry snickered as she slapped his hand “Merlin's beard Malfoy you're so annoying.” She said, leaving Ron and him to deal with the dough themselves. She didn't go far however, leading Malfoy just across the table and finally letting go of his hand, Draco let out a cry of triumph holding his hand out as if he almost had it cut out, his happiness quickly fading when with a heavy thud, a basket full of apples was placed in front of him. “You my dear, are going to peel the apples.” Hermione said, handing Malfoy a knife. If Harry would've guessed he'd say at this point Draco was seeing white, since he gaped at the knife in his hands with pure horror “w-what?” He muttered, shooting Hermione a terrified look “you mean...all of these..?” He pointed at the basket, Hermione nodded smugly. “You better be thankful, I knew you wouldn't dirty yourself to save your life, so i didn't give you anything to do with flour.”
Harry gulped. He bend to retrieve the stone. The runes gone dull, he stowed it in the back pocket of his jeans. Harry readied himself to apparate and for one split second, Draco thought they were going to be fine. A thought squashed quick when Harry apparated them onto the roof.
"Doing a magical road trip with muggle vehicles? Like, can we shrink them and apparate? How do wizards travel to other countries? I don't really see magical folks getting onto planes, and then," Harry's mind went into overdrive. "How about passports, and visa, and-"
"Over there is the exhibit, the public library and a study hall where lectures are given almost daily. If you follow through the exhibit, there's a grand stairwell leading up to a little restaurant completely dragon themed and a gift shop. I recommend you check that all out, some of the lectures are pretty interesting, I think," Charlie turned and called out to Bernadette. "You have the schedule right?"
"Good, then off you go. You can ask for supplies over there," Bernadette pointed at the Dragon Handlers office. "Any of the Soul members will give it, or tell you where to get it."
Harry sat on his bed, unmoving and just looking around while slowly waking up when his eye caught the stack of books he brought along. That set him going, a plan of action slowly forming in his head.
"Star struck, Harry?" Andromeda asked but the smile and twinkle in her eye showed amusement and made it clear she thought it adorable.
"We're going to make a little trip," Charlie said. "There are multiple campsites along the border of the Reservoir and I thought it nice to visit one of them."
She held the door open for Harry. He had seen the study before. A large desk against the wall which fitted between the other two walls exactly, a bookshelf above and two large bookshelves shoved against either wall had their sides tapping the desk. Next to the door stood an old, frilly pink crib filled with little keepsakes of Nymphadora; Toys and books she had once called her favourites through various ages, her Hogwarts letter, report cards and her Auror diploma. Underneath the crib were standing two boxes. One obviously held stack upon stack of photo's and the other was labelled Remus Lupin.
"I know?" Harry remembered well enough. Charlie explained that the Reservoir was understaffed and any taking time off meant more working hours for the rest. Take in account sickness and unexpected emergency leaves, vacation time had to be planned well in advance.
He traced a few more patches, admiring the advanced work he'd done, stitches with colourful wires from Slytherin green to sunny yellow swirled with bright purple he'd spend to many time on having in his hands. He pricked his fingers bleeding and kept going, another stitch, another hour on the clock and eventually, having to stop due to him not being able to see straight and Draco cramping from the pain. It was a long way from a painless procedure. Draco was lucky to be a fellow wizard. The muggles didn't have the pleasure of a numbing, disinfectant potion before and a healing charm afterwards.
Harry knew he shouldn't have asked when Draco shook his head, cheeks flashing red and snapped. "I know my books Harry. A book about the fourteen to sixteen hundreds dressing styles? I don't think so."
"Are you alright?" Andromeda asked one night when Harry had come down from bringing Teddy to bed. He was holding a letter he already had read and judging from his face, he wasn't happy. At all.
"Me neither," Said Draco who had adopted his haughty voice Harry hadn't heard in while. "I use my time better nowadays as I don't fancy suing Merlin know who for slander. I rather stay unaware of my name and person being dragged through the mud."
How could they? Harry, again – never stopping, always on the move rounded another corner, went trough a door and ran up the many stairs. Couldn't they see? How did they not know they needed time and a soft helping hand? Did they have no feels, couldn't they see that what the ordered them to be was impossible? Unbelievable?
Harry had sent their presents, along with the presents to the rest of the Weasley clan just the day before. He knew they were falling out, they hadn't written to each other for a month or so by now but regardless, they were still his best friends. Although he had his doubts if that feeling was returned when he received a big box back from the Weasley's, signed by them all, including signed by Fred in spirit but it excluded Ron. It was the first thing Jarry noticed when he checked the card. He was a bit sad about that but the box stood amongst the other presents under the tree. There was a larger pile of presents under the tree then Harry had thought there to be.
When he looked, he almost yelped. He caught himself in time by slapping both hands against his mouth, trembling heavy, even Draco knew the dark haired man was rapidly building up to a massive panic attack.
Harry almost smacked himself. Sure he might've been a tad rude, but he was in a hurry. He almost just repeated his question, but when she raised an eyebrow and pursed her lips, Harry gave in. "Sorry, goodmorning," He huffed. "The potions, have they been cleaned up?"
"It's just for a couple of hours, I'll be back soon." Charlie said. "Being a Dragon Handler is a hard job you know, if I want more then one day off I need to apply three months before, which I didn't. I think I mentioned it to you in one of our letters?"
For a moment, Harry stared warily at Draco but, he settled little Teddy on the floor who happily crawled out of the room in search of his toys. Harry watched the little boy go and as soon as he was out of sight, he crossed his arms and stared at the blonde, as if waiting for him to say more.
"Shit." Draco yelped, only now realizing Harry overcame his panic attack and channelled out his magic build up from the stress through the stone.
With simple goodbyes, Harry left. He went straight to the garden, sat down and spent the next hour carefully collecting the bottles and sealing them in their own glass boxes, and taking earth samples to fill the test-tubes. Once done, he levitated them in, after he'd asked Bernadette if he could leave them anywhere. She pointed him to the lecture hall, the place going unused until Wednesday.
That night, they walked into the employee diner at six sharp. Harry hadn't really thought about how it would look, but if he took a guess, he might say something like the old lunchroom at his muggle school, or something alike the Leaky Cauldron. It was neither. It was actually more alike the Hogwarts Yule ball during his fourth year, if compared to anything he ever saw before.
everytime he felt like a madman Luna was always there to guide him with her colorful bracelets and weird creativity, her soft gaze reading Harry like an open book, Luna was truly something marvellous, painting her own life in such bright colors so she would never get lonely, he felt himself smile kindly at her “ do you think what i’m seeing is real?”
"This is do'' a soft voice was followed by a sound, strong but pleasant. "After there is re-mi-fa-'' three sounds, three notes, softly played by his mother's fingers. "Eight notes is an octava, going from do to do, see?" A high pitch tone, his mother's smile. "This note is called do as well, but it is higher. Do you want to touch the keys?" Draco was little, big enough to learn piano, but small enough for his legs to tangle from the stool. His mother was warm at his side, fingers sliding down the keys gracefully. Draco wanted to be graceful like her, wanted to learn the magic she created with her bare fingers. So he nodded, pressing the keys she had just shown him, pointing it out on the sheet on notes they spread out on the top of the piano. "Good, can you see they're moving in a pattern? Take your time to read it, try to play the melody." Draco did, not understanding how the very same notes his mother played sounded so harsh under his undeveloped hands. A flush of shame crept up his neck, he did a bad job. "You are doing so well darling." His mother said, her hands playing a warm melody on his back, rubbing it softly in a way that made his heart sing from pride. "You're lying." He said, ignoring the content her praise gave him. "I would never lie to you." She tilted her head, chuckling at his frown. "Look at your hands." His mother said, platinum blonde hair falling over her eyes. "Your fingers are long and slim, you have the hands of a pianist."
She might've found out Draco skipped all his classes today, perhaps she came to scold him, or even worse, send him home, which he wouldn't mind honestly, Hogwarts is far from being a safe place for him now.
“You should accept help, if you're offered, I did once, and served under a great man, who I was ready to die for”  Draco's sobs evolved into loud cries as he fell down to his knees, pain streaming through his whole body, running everything through his head, Voldemort, the war,his family- Potter.
Not only that his body was sore from yesterday's beating, but there was a actual pile of these black creatures on his bed, all sitting on him “what the fuck…” he groaned, burying his face in the pillow.
Draco seriously hated pie making. He couldn't understand how people did that for fun, especially muggles- who has to powers to cut down a dozen of apples? Draco, apparently. Since this is what he just did. They had finished the pie by Granger pouring a bunch of cinnamon and sugar at the slightly red apples, all stained from Draco's precious blood! Even though he absolutely hated every second of it, there were some nice parts, it really got easier after Potter took one of the Solus, who still curled up happily on his shoulder, life is unfair Draco thought, since these suckers are never this nice to
“I can't believe you've done this!” Draco exclaimed as they walked through the fields on their way back to the castle, both of them soaking wet. “You got what you deserve.” Potter mused, his horrible mop of a hair still dripping so hard you could wash a whole corridor with it. “I offered you a hand!! To help you get up!! Ugh!!” He kicked the grass like a child, hating each time even the slightest breeze made him shiver, being cold is horrible, being wet is worse. He wrapped his hands over himself, holding his hands under his armpits “that's so fucking childish of you.” He muttered through gritted teeth, Potter groaned “you started it!”
“And now, we shall begin the house sorting” McGonagall lowered her wand as Slughorn brought a stool and the sassy sorting hat.
“What are you doing?” Parkinson’s voice cold as she sneers at the hand, her eyes trailing on Hermione's features suspiciously
to heat up and his heart has to beat so fast he might as well be having a heart attack and currently dying. Of course Potter always has to be different, as if he's not so brilliant and important as he is, Draco's poor, poor heart might not withstand an another glance in his direction, so he didn't, stubbornly pushing down his own pants instead thinking about anything besides Harry Potter and his obnoxious boxers. A thing he is glad about though is that he himself wore a plain black pair today, so even if Potter did sneak a glance, he had no blackmail material against him, and Draco would always have a pair of bright red snitch boxers to his defense.
The thing didn't seem to be attacking him, it was just glaring intensely at him, making his whole ride utterly uncomfortable.
He noticed how Parkinson left breakfast crying this morning, leaving all her friends behind, he also noticed how far the Slytherins stood apart from the rest of the students, as if they were keeping a safe distance between them, something inside him tugged at his chest, feeling like he should do something, but not quite sure what nor why, Malfoy was their friend right? maybe they could help him break through Malfoy’s thick skin.
Seeing his face brought up many mixed feelings to the surface, he was happy yet sad to see him, looking as if he can walk out of this painting anytime and begin complaining about the lazy students, Merlin, Draco missed him.
he could only guess what the both of them talked about, given their shared history Draco guessed it wasn't good things. Hermione nodded quietly as gloom fell over the table, they've all been there, well, besides Pansy of course, who now tried to hold back tears, not a good way to start a morning, mourning you friends death, but it's not a new thing for any of them, since everyone lost someone in the war. “I'm sorry Draco… we tried our best-” Granger began and he made sure to stop her there “hey, it's okay. The Solus bloomed, so I'm better now” he gave her a gentle smile which she returned, no need to feel guilty now. Besides her, Weasley frowned, perhaps disapproving of their exchange? Draco had no time to think this over, since at this moment Neville rose up from his seat leaving the Great Hall. He didn't know what pushed him up to follow, but he did, shooting Potter a quick glance. One of the Solus climbed up his hair as he did so, making his scalp sting and eyes water- maybe Neville is the next thing he's ought to fix? He wasn't sure, but it was worth a try.
a wonderful thing which he was lucky enough to experience in his life. “Everything.” He answered, green eyes meeting gray. Malfoy just sighed, his tired expression is now colored with a bit of sadness. “A wonderful thing huh?” Of course it's wonderful! Harry wanted to say, how dare Malfoy even question such a thing, magic is great, just sometimes it falls in the hands of a bad person, but that does not make magic itself bad, magic is never cruel nor violent, at least it's not supposed to be. “For me,” Malfoy continued, finally breaking eye contact “magic is a set of rules which can never be broken.” He lifted both of his hands as if he's holding a wand, practicing movement which reminded  Harry of an orchestrate. He closed his eyes, pale eyebrows furrowed in concentration, each movement of his hand was well trained, as if he's done that many times before. “Not a move out of place-” Malfoy continued to move his hands as he spoke, moving his hands so persistly you'd think he'd been cursed to to that. “Hold your hand not too high, but not too low, grip your wand tight, say the spell correctly, each latin word as if you're fluent in the language, never mumble, never waver, don't hesitate and if you do-” Malfoy dropped his hands, and only now Harry noticed that they were shaking, Harry's eyes widened, realization suddenly hit him.
Slowly, pale fingers released the fabric, and with a deep breath, Draco shoved his blanket down and rolled up his sleeve.
The weight he felt on top of him? That was Draco Malfoy. His long pale legs draped all over him, a platinum blond head snuggling into his chest, Harry let out a choked noise, Malfoy was bloody heavy, since in addition to a weight of a healthy young man, a bundle of way more heavier Solus all cuddling on top of his back as well. Which would have been cute, if Harry wasn't in actual danger of suffocating.
“I just don't think anyone should be treated like that” Hermione said, her voice quite tense from the irony, since Pansy
Sharing an uncertain look with Zabini, Parkinson reached out for the hand and grabbed it, silently nodding.
“Well fuck off then! Ice prince!” she yelled, leaving the table crying, he would get up after her if it wasn't the weight keeping him glued to his chair, he noticed that 'they’ got heavier whenever he felt bad, pulling him lower and lower until he sank completely and disappeared, but there was other weight besides those damn creatures, there were the eyes, everyone cared to give him those angry disappointed eyes.
A couple of days have passed since their conversation, if you can call it that way. Draco couldn't say he's unbothered, as much as he wanted to act all cool and collected about the situation but his mind kept drifting back to it, he never knew about Neville's situation, he never cared to actually ask or wonder what his new friends were going through, ever since the Solus appeared on his back he always thought about how hard of a time he's been going through, while Potter feared sleeping alone, nightmares of the war still hunt him to this day.
“Solus?” The three of them asked in sync, Hagrid nodded handing the parchment back “it sure looks like a Solus, maybe you guys should check it out? I had a book somewhere-” Hagrid got up, searching through his little drawers “uh..” he scratched  his nape “ I can't find it” the teens groaned, Ron sinking deeper in the cushion “of course”, Hermione bit her lower lip “there should be something about them in the library right?”  Hagrid sighed, going back into his chair “I'm sorry guys, I wish I could help more” , Harry shook his head “ it's okay, you helped plenty”
“Snape was a death eater as well, and oh did he suffer, you should know” McGonagall stared him dead in the eye, yet her expression was soft and caring  “I would want you to talk with him”
He's not. Harry thought, remembering their time together. But then he hesitated, maybe he did do something to piss Draco off. "I've seen him in our dorm today, he's been looking kinda pale" Blaise said, smirking slightly when Harry looked at him expectantly. "He didn't say much, I assumed he didn't want to talk."
“I talked to Neville you know..that's what made me blow off on you.. er- if you've been wondering.” Harry muttered awkwardly, grateful that he's glued onto the ground for once, it held him down from running away from his problems, which worked. For a long while Malfoy didn't say anything, his gaze glued to the now pitch black water, they didn't notice how long they've been in the room of requirement and if Harry would've guessed, they've been sitting near the lake for quite a while too so it's no surprise stars had scattered across the sky like sprinkles on frosting, leaving them alone with the soft moonlight and the sounds of the night. When Malfoy finally spoke however, his tone was no longer angry; “What’s magic to you Potter?” Harry said nothing, just gaping at the blond boy besides him. What kind of question is that? Magic is everything and everyone, filling the world with so many wonderful things, filling Harry's miserable life with so much color and happiness, without Magic Harry would still be with the Dursleys, or even worse, thrown away to the streets. Magic is
his throat became the moment he saw him, how his breath actually hitched, which made the whole situation a lot more exasperating. “You're aware we have lessons tomorrow right? That I actually need to
“Draco, it looks like you're falling apart, I won't ask why, even a dead man doesn't have time for that" Draco huffed a laugh,”i just..don’t know what to do” he mumbled, tears filling up his eyes “I'm not here to help you anymore, but..listen up kid” Snape’s voice soothed him, his hands were clenched at his sides, tugging thick pieces of fabric in his palm
“I would like for us all to have a minute of silence for all those who left us, so we could start a loud and eventful school year” the tip of her wand lit up, Harry did the same, pulling out his wand and murmuring lomus, and the great hall filled up with light, everyone held out their wands out high, silent for all those who can no longer speak
“Don't say that! You're a war hero, anything you say might have a huge impact on people!”  It always surprised Harry how Hermione managed to be so kind even towards the worst people, he saw Ron roll his eyes and chuckled “tell him Harry!” Hermione slapped Harry's shoulder,he shut his mouth and held it in a thin line, he had to bite the inside of his cheeks in order to keep himself from laughing.
He rolled his eyes, frustrated at the fact that he's so close to his warm bed yet he's still here, wet cold and extremely uncomfortable. “To my dorminto- oh Merlin" only now he realized how weird that sounds, oh God he's such an idiot. “I- er- “ he mumbled, feeling his cheeks warm up in front of Potter, who still stood there, his mouth agape. “Jesus I didn't mean this in a weird way! Don't make this weird Potter!!” Draco snapped, stomping his feet hard on the stone floor in frustration.  “I'm making this weird?? I was walking to the Gryffindor tower peacefully until
Mcgonagall probably had her reasons taking him back, she could have hope for him to be better, but more than anyone Harry knows that you cannot get better when everything is crashing down on you, not when you're alone.
But Neville didn't, his gaze fixated on the plate now, he was sniffing pretty hard, and Draco almost offered him a napkin but the boy bit into his creation. “It's sweet” Neville said, and he only shrugged. “It has a ton of sugar in it after all.” Neville chuckled at that, his laugh sad and bitter, but still a laugh “I just..miss her.. my mum” he said, immediately regretting it by the looks of it, since he took an another bite of the pie and made sure to keep chewing. To that Draco could relate, he sometimes also wished he could just stop speaking, but also, missed his mother with his whole heart.
He decided to sketch them, pulling out some new parchment and dipping his quill, Harry began sketching a sloppy black figure: they were small, about a size of a cat, with bright white eyes that could pierce through steel if they wanted, four large ears, the same amount of legs, long and slightly unproportionate next to their unusually little body, their face was flat,the end of their thin tails was fluffy, and they looked more iridescent than they were black
“What are you doing in my bed?” Draco hissed, keeping his voice low even though they were the only ones there.  The boy shrugged, shifting closer “let me sleep with you please” he said, sounding just as uncomfortable as he looked like. Draco just stared at him for a long, long minute, trying to understand whether the chosen one is joking or really wants to get killed.
I finished this chapter earlier than I intended and honestly I have absolutely no patience so i decided to upload it
Merlin what a day. He had a breakdown, missed a bunch of lessons as he stayed in his room sleeping out all the crying he did yesterday, thinking whether he wants to strangle Potter or himself, (in the end he did strangle him, ah, the sweet, sweet taste of revenge.) Then that talk with McGonagall gave him so much hope before it all crashed and burned. What's the point of telling someone the solution if they can't use it? Deep inside he knew that McGonagall suggested using the spell as a last resort, a second option not many are given in life, and as kind as the headmistress is, Draco could never use her offer. It's just too much, experiencing the things that created the Solus once again, he doesn't even know what kind of things cause them, and after two Solus blooming; one during a quidditch game and the other in a room where one of his friends died, he honestly didn't want to know.
He nodded politely, standing up and brushing off his own robes before he turned his attention back to the headmistress, lowering his gaze apologetically as her gaze pierced through his entire being.
“Don't tell me you've changed Malfoy!” Neville was screaming how, and Draco let him, as angry as it made him, he didn't really have any words to fight his accusations. “Don't tell me that all you've done- all these things you put me through are not as black and white!” His eyes were blazing fire boiling behind his tears, who were now pouring out uncontrollably “after all of this … don't tell me that I'm wrong for thinking you were a villain, that you were not the monster- that I knew…”
“When you're a pureblood, you have no right to enjoy magic” Malfoy continued, and more than anything Harry wished to get back up again,
If only he could live his days quietly attending school just like everyone else, maybe imaginary creatures wouldn't be his problem, but the dark mark on his hand separated him from everyone else, black ink buried in his skin that had changed him forever, leaving no place for change, for growth, he will forever stay his miserable self, just with very annoying company now.
Taking a deep breath, Hermione reached out her hand, it was a simple greeting gesture yet it made all the classmates that gathered up around them gasp loudly, as if it was a peace offering between two dangerous nations
After Harry's speech, Malfoy was no longer interesting and the colorful crowd seemed to mix up, the room suddenly filled itself with chatter
btw english is not my first language so i'm sorry if my grammer is bad, i really hope you enjoyed this chapter i  thought that those kids need to chill and make up a little before they move on into learning more about the Solus and themselves, they are actually a methaphor for anxiety and depression( i hope i  managed to show that well) since one of my ways of dealing with it is to embody my problems and turn them into characters, making it into something easier to deal with, i hope this story helps you too
“Nope.” Draco admitted proudly, his other hand clasping over the mark through the fabric. He spared it a quick glance before flopping onto his bed, sighing with relief. “Well, enough with the underwear talk. I'm going to sleep, we have two free beds in this dorm so you can take whatever, I'm turning off the lights, okay?” Draco said as he slipped under the covers, already about to blow the candle. Panic flashed on Potter's face as he simply nodded, he stomped over the two free beds and Draco blew off the  candle, letting the room to be taken over by darkness.
“I know you're worried about returning honey, but I'm sure school will be great” her grip tightened on the wheel, proving Draco that she was as afraid as he is, yet, she kept talking “McGonagall was kind enough to let you attend your eighth year at Hogwarts, and if she's okay with that, anyone will.”  Draco's gaze fell back to the blurred window he was leaning on, staring at the gray road they were taking to King cross station.
Malfoy sure brought a crowd around him, getting kicked and hexed by anyone who dared, his broken screams making even Ron cringe as if he was feeling the same pain, the trio shared looks everyone thinking the same: does he deserves their help? would them stepping in really change something?
Hermione hummed, tucking a curly lock of hair behind her ear, nodding before she took a step forward, grabbing Harry's arm “okay let's go”  her actions really took him by surprise, he stared back at her bouncy bush of her hair wide eyed as she made her way towards the Slytherins, he said that he
The other creatures were all different, like a bunch of misshapen  animals, so different yet they all cling to Malfoy
“How dare you!” A loud thud echoed across the hall, the trio turned around, all Harry could see were colors, yellow, red and blue, all looking at the same scene: red, red dripping down a green robe, red dripping down a pale chin
It's strange to say, but he has gotten used to Draco's temper, and the git would always skip lunch when he was upset. It's weird, being familiar with his routines and habits. It made Harry feel closer to him, and the worry in his chest tightened. Was it their kiss? Did Harry do something wrong? He couldn't sit in his seat. He saw a blonde head from down the hallway, but when he made his way towards him Draco magically disappeared. So he's either very busy, which he shouldn't be. Or he's avoiding Harry.
see them, why him? why now? the nails digging into his skin now were his, as he dug them deeper and deeper into his palm, seeing his knuckles go white, hoping that maybe some pain may help him wake up
“and why would we trust you?” Zabini spat at him, his finger pointing in Harry’s direction,tensing up a little Harry nodded, ignoring Blaise yet sharing an intense eye contact with the raven haired girl, Hermione gently offered her hand again “you may not like us, and honestly, I'm not into forgiving you after all you've done” Hermione took a deep breath and went on “but, if Harry wants to help, I do too”
“He taught me, in the only was he saw acceptable.” Malfoy said, his voice bitter. But that makes no sense, ever since they were little Draco always bragged about how great his father was, Lucius Malfoy, a great wizard in Malfoy's eyes, the one who bought him the newest brooms and the best robes, a man so dark yet his only son still admired him, no abused person would ever brag about their abuser, right?
Thank you guys for all the patience, I am immensely proud of this chapter and sincerely hope you will like it as well.
There was no way those things were real, maybe it's a spell, perhaps a prank, he didn't care anymore, it was his second day here and he was tired already.
He stomped through the hall unsure of where he could go where he would be safe- alone,yes, he needed some alone time to gather his thoughts
Harry tried to recall all their years together, Malfoy had always been there, when he first entered diagon alley or when he faced Voldemort, he was just there.
Harry was laughing out loud at this point, seeing Draco struggling like that is truly a blast. When he turned to Ron however, he noticed that his friend was not having a good time at all. “They get along well don't they?” Ron muttered so just Harry could hear, he frowned “what are you talking about?”. His friend poured the flour into a bowl, but his motions were more violent than they needed to be. “Malfoy duh, all intelligent and up to his ass.” Harry gaped at him, his ginger brows were furrowed angrily with an intense glare aimed at the pair. “Ron.” Harry grabbed him by the shoulder “Hermione loves you mate, why would she need Malfoy?” This really didn't make any sense in his head, out of all the people he knew he would never even think that Draco and Hermione would work out together, they're just so.. not right for each other, Hermione liked Ron ever since she knew him, Harry honestly couldn't name a more perfect pair. They fight a lot sure, but they survived a war together, stayed together even though it had been hard. Unlike Harry and Ginny who couldn't handle an another person's problem together with themselves. “I don't know, he reads books and shit, clearly doesn't need help with potions.” Ron whispered angrily, slicing the butter into cubes even though Harry was sure he imagined someone else under his knife. Harry's frown deepened and he followed Ron's glare coming to a sight: Hermione peeking over Draco's shoulder as he pathetically attempted to peel apples, his hands clumsily either cutting too deep or nothing at all.
He couldn't bring himself to take the last step though, and with an apologetic look, he shook his head and turned around. Ron Weasley looked confused and Hermione Granger shouted his name but he ignored them. He just.. Couldn't bring himself to say something.
"Good, because really," He exhaled exaggerated. "I can't cook that well. I'll say, bacon and eggs are pretty good but there will be not three course elegance at dinner coming from me. Now pretty please, move along!"
"No, I do have a point, so," Draco corrected and fumbled his keys from his car out of his pocket. He settled an elbow on the table, letting the keys dangle for them both to see. "Why don't we get freshened up and go for a ride? Safest option we got. I have to steer so I can't hex you, and you can't hex me, may it cause both our deaths."
"Teddy won't bust the furniture, Right Teddy?" Harry said in reply and ruffled the toddler's hair. "He's a good boy."
"Yeah, so, that's Bernadette Dell'elion," Charlie pointed out a sweet looking old lady at a desk in the entrance hall. "She's lovely but stern, our receptionist, kindly let her know where you wander to as it's her job to keep track of all visitors."
Draco hummed when Harry got up and easily made his way to the door that let to the back room and snapped the light on. "After you." He bowed mockingly and motioned for Draco to enter.
Harry may have taken more time then needed with the drinks but it was enough. Draco calmed down. Harry set the hot chocolate down, pushing one over. "So, if we need to get passports done, we'll go tomorrow. It's not yet the Holiday time. Then, lets go over this slow," He took a sip from his drink. "First question first, can we shrink our vehicles and apparate?"
Harry mentally added a maybe as he watched the blonde produce his wand from out his back pocket and dropped it into his lap. "When you're done, there's dinner in the fridge for you."
Bernadette Dell'elion just stared him down. Harry wondered why she didn't answer and was about to ask again when she said lightly. "Goodmorning."
"What?! I thought you locked me in! You let me out!" Came Harry's shouted reply, making Draco stop his act; realizing he was caught in an anger fit against the door, he flushed red and shouted back. "That's not funny, let me in! I'm freezing!"
"Oh, yeah. Sure.." Charlie said as he stretched. He gave a lazy wave when he walked away. "Gotta hurry, bye!"
Draco canceled the magic that was soaked up by the book and flipped through it once again only this time he ripped one of every few pages out.
Two days later and the loud bang that apparently came from the clock on the first hallway sounded every hour, making anything nearby shake on its place. It was unexplainable, same fact went for the front door still not opening and their kitchen that had turned purple from ceiling to floor.
In a twisted way, it put them at ease. Those stolen moments gave them rest, a safe haven. A place in a life they no longer wanted. Destroyed and broken, this is what they chose.
The security guard confirmed that it was all he could do. "It falls outside the boundaries of our reservation. We can ask to have it cleaned up, but unless it's bringing the Sanctuary in immediate problems, we won't take action."
"I didn't mean to, but I think the situation of me kidnapping you could've been salvaged somehow, but only if you hadn't make me lose the stone then-"
Apparently, Harry wasn't quite alright, not yet thinking straight and his magic refused to calm down. The crack sound in the air booming alerted the Aurors. Draco barely could see them through the rain, further down the street, turning around swift. His hair whipped around his face and his shirt danced in the wind.
Everybody looked at one or another chair differently, like Millicent Bulstrode who couldn't keep her hopeful, longing eyes of the empty chair beside her - Pansy Parkinsons' seat. The girl who's still in St. Mungo's, undergoing long term recovery, if they could call it that. The staff was still trying to stop and counter the crushing curse that's trying to turn her inside out.
"It's a crucial part of planning, Harry." Draco exaggerated his name and turned on his heel, beckoning the other to follow him to a cafe nearby. "We have to apply for a muggle and wizard passport at the Ministry's national travel department, it can take up to six weeks, excluding the holiday periods to have them ready for pick up, then we need-"
A desk was crammed in at the left and Harry, phone in his hand, crawled behind it, telling the person on call that no, he did not take apprentice applications. Those calls came more often but he didn't fancy teaching anyone. Normally getting behind the desk was hard enough but with a phone in his hand, it was double the trouble, really, if he would gain weight he would never be able to get behind it. The space was so small. He dropped himself in the white leather chair and sighed, dropping the phone back in its cradle. Simply another day of work just to begin and he liked it, just like that - Simple and easy.
Harry watched him go. He thought about going back to sleep but he felt too awake already. He sat up, ran a hand through his hair and yawned. Then he looked around and wondered. "Now what?"
The feeling of dread came crashing in. After his exile, he quickly found his own in the muggle world. He had finally built his life up. He owned a shabby house, a menial job and could honestly say he was enjoying himself. He tried to lay low, live without drama and have a simple life. Now, everything went undone in one event. He got tangled up in a magical mess with law. He ran a hand over his face. He tried to still his erratic breathing because he once again felt completely out of sorts. All because Harry Potter - The saviour, the goody-two-shoes, the one and only slayer of the Dark Lord - The one that lay unconscious across from him had, of all people imaginable, no control of his magic.
"Hey, it's just and oversight." Harry said but kept hush when he saw how overworked Draco became all of a sudden.
"Sit." Andromeda said as she put two mugs of tea on the table and sat down. Harry scooted in the seat beside her and curled his fingers around the steamy cup.
He went back to the shop, picked up his photo and purchased a card with the sunset over the mountains and pleased to see a couple of flecks moving around on the card. He scribbled a quick few lines about his arrival and the Nursery, about how much he loved being here already and slapped the photo of him and Charlie onto it with a sticking charm.
Three days later Kreacher had finally stopped cursing at him every time he came near and four days later he'd opened up the front door on the early morning and was graced by a surprise visit of his best friend Hermione Granger.
Draco shook himself loose from Harry and put his hands up in surrender. Ron was close now and he was ready to yield, seeing no point into getting himself in trouble by resisting cooperation. He cared about Harry but was not ready to put himself in danger. He did not however, expect Harry to grab his leg and apparate the both of them out.
Harry laughed sheepishly. He put Teddy back in the pram and bowed mockingly at Draco for him to lead the way. Soon they finished their vaults, Gringotts a stark difference to the alley with zilch hints to the holiday, and they went on their way. Andromeda quickly handed them some shopping lists. Harry being send to the grocery store and into a few stores to buy gift cards and Draco being send to the Apothecary and the perfumery. Harry approved of the dividing as the shops Andromeda send Draco to weren't well liked by him.
Draco had his own wand out in self defence, two Aurors flanked him, their own wands ready. The drove him back and towards a wall in order to minimize the chance of an attack from behind. Although immediate action was taken, Harry was not pleased.
"There are other magical beings in the reservoir?" Harry had asked and Charlie had nodded. He said there were, all of them, from centaurs to flubberworms and all enjoying the peace the reservoir brought them.
"It's.. Not quite right." Draco made a lazy wave at his back. "It needs somewhat else?" He said unsure and wandered about the small space as he softly mused his thoughts out loud. "Another flower? Some swirls; my right shoulder needs to be edged with another colour. I feel some is a little bland, it needs to pop and shine."
This morning in the kitchen, Draco told he had found the library locked again and Harry couldn't even remember it had opened up at all. Draco scolded and waved his wand, levitating their pensieve onto the table.
"No, it isn't. I don't mind either, it's fine, I'll gladly pay." Harry was quick to answer when he saw that Charlie wasn't very comfortable as he asked it.
"Yes Sir." Robert answered. He came around the counter, almost knocking over the candy rack and mumbled a curse. He righted it and held his big hand out to take the card from Harry who quickly wrote down the Burrows' address, signed to Ron and a quick line telling him he was to share it with his family and Hermione. That done, Harry thanked Robert. Before he could leave however, he was stopped.
"I.. I just really didn't want to go to Hogwarts. I feel like, I've seen to much, yet, way too little and I just.." He thought for a moment, stirring the tea. "..Want to be free. See the world and be myself I guess. I feel too old for school."
Harry looked over, Solomon was laying on the couch, mostly covered by a cloak again. Only the shock of white hair was visible.
"Harry!" Charlie beamed. He'd been the one to hug him and was waiting to pick him up. "You look like a bleeding tourist!"
"Now?" Harry's chest fell. He understood Charlie had a job here, an import one. Still, he hoped that for at least for the first few days, Charlie would be free and hang out with him.
"Maybe we should come back tomorrow." Draco said, eyeing them warily. He was quick to see heads turned his way and people shuffling away from him hurried.
Dizzily, almost happily - Harry looked away from the blade he had let go off and caught the sight of Draco's arm. Fresh teeny, tiny puncture holes in grey skin, veins popping up, surrounding the dark mark and Harrys' finger glided gently over them.
From that point it were two days later the air between Draco and Harry was clearing of tension and he was invited back to the bedroom to his luck.
"I will not have my first Christmas with my family together be in ruins," Andromeda wagged her finger. "You will wrap today, lazy bums."
Harry shook his head and sat down next to Andromeda where the witch was curled up on the couch, enjoying a glass of fine wine and listening to the Wizard Wireless. "They think. I don't want to be their friend anymore." Harry sighed as he let himself fall against her side and rested his head on her shoulder. "They can't. They don't want to understand why I didn't come back to Hogwarts and now they think I don't want to be friends anymore and I don't know what to do."
"Hey hey! Little man," Harry plucked him up and kissed the toddlers sticky cheek, to be rewarded with sticky cheeks of himself as two tiny, apple-sauced hands patted his cheeks paired with happy gurgles in a hello back. "Aren't you one happy lad?" He crooned and settled him on his hip.
Thus, from playground meetings, car rides and even grocery shopping and nightmare induced waking from both on daily basis, which they turned to long midnight chats whispered in the dark, they forged themselves a bond over time.
Charlie asked what Harry's plans were for the afternoon. "You're planning to complete collecting them potions?"
Sure enough, lower on the shelf were books with simple titles, "Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, Durmstrong Institute.." His finger ran across the titles. He knew of those but there were eight more that he didn't know of and he knew he'd found Hermione a gift. Despite being on bad terms with Hermione and Ron, he couldn't imagine not getting them a gift. Ultimately, they were still his best friends, even if, they had a bit of fight going on. He pulled a book from each school and stacked them up on the first one he had found and left to pay.
"Yes! Lets go! This way." Charlie nodded eagerly pointing at his own front door. "I have permission to take you into the nursery, see the eggs and then go for a fly."
Charlie flipped a leaf and was evenly enthusiastic. "Great, I don't come here too often so it's a treat for me too!"
He let the thought die on his tongue but Andromeda knew. She gave Harry a hug. "Maybe, one day we gather enough and create one but for now, I have you a different gift."
Draco knew he had to treat carefully now. He knew, anything he said could be used against him. It was then, that he caught a glimpse outside. The weather turned. The sun left, clouds formed and the temperature went down. Draco swallowed, knowing this could be problematic. It must be something to do with the summons he held. He just hoped that neither Ron or Ginny would link it.
Draco didn't say anything to that. He merely checked the time and waited a few minutes. "Have you come up with anything?"
Draco couldn't help but snort and swallow a laugh. He waved his own wand at Harry who didn't agree. "Levitating yourself is dangerous Malfoy!"
That night, Harry and Draco raced upstairs and cleared the maps out of Andromeda's study. They took them up to their room. Draco grabbed a random map from the box. He made himself comfortable on his bed, ready to study the map from Australia but Harry snatched it from him and put it on a stack. Draco noticed he was making two piles.
Harry grinned, pressed himself just that tad bit tighter to the other and a simple swish with the shiny, sharp metal had him ripping through the fabric of his pants - leaving his upper thighs naked he skill fully twirled the knife between his fingers once and settled the blade against the already marred and scratched skin.
Harry knew in his in the back of his mind that spells didn't do well on old books, because really, he was forbidden to use any magic in any way on or near the books; multiple times. Even house elf magic wasn't allowed. Making up his mind, he shrugged and started levitating the books one by one to their place on the shelf. Damn that rule. Damn that ladder. Damn this library. Damn the fact I'll be in trouble later. Damn it all. When he reached eyelevel he started picking the books up by hand. He trusted them onto the shelves venting off his anger. He heard some rips and crackling but he didn't care. Books onto the shelves, no matter how and getting the hell out of the doomed place was the only thing he could think about.
"I have bought myself the same set I gifted you." Harry said. "We'll have to try in the muggle world though. The components fry when used around too much magic."
"If you plan on dying today, kindly inform Andy it's not my fault before you do." Draco said sarcastically.
Harry followed her and they sat down. Harry liked the small seating arrangement, he hadn't noticed it before as it stood off to the side. The walls were soft yellow, the simple chairs were bold yellow. It matched with the large light blue pot that had painted golden rings spiralling up with a light green plant. It had huge leafs, and between the chairs was a low table with some pamphlets regarding the tours and lectures given in the building. Harry had almost forgotten about it, and made a mental note he really should check that, and the exhibition out sooner than later.
"Relax in the garden, prune and collect items requested by the Apothecary." Charlie revealed. "The weather is great to do so, tomorrow."
"It kind of does though." Harry sighed. "In case you haven't noticed, my magic is out of control and has been since.. Since I defeated Voldemort."
"Stop!" He screamed and gathered split second attention for the second time. Never lowering his voice, he kept on screaming. "I asked what the bleeding hell is going on!"
Harry's smile intensified when Andromeda beamed said proudness at him. "Come, one, follow me." She waved Harry along.
Draco however, didn't wait for the other to come back and levitated himself up to the windowsill, jumping in and landing on his feet with a thud. He took a moment of thought, whether to go left, right or up when he heard Harry's footsteps above his head. Up it is as he went, finding Harry in the library. He asked his question again which made the black haired wizard shrug: "I don't know."
Then, with Draco's presents unwrapped, it was Harry's turn. Harry liked his gifts very much, even if there weren't that many. The Weasley box came with a new sweater Mrs. Mrs. Weasley made, a tin of fudge and lots of candy from everyone - each with a card from all the family members. Ginny's card was cribbled full in tiny handwriting, and at last she'd asked if she needed to hex her brother.
Arms folded, Rom grew ever redder and ready to shout but Ginny eyed Draco for a moment and nodded. She took a deep breath and spoke, a voice laced in anger, she spoke seemingly calm. "We've been investigating in the magical surge spikes within this neighbourhood for a time but the output has been scrambled. It has made pin pointing the location quite difficult, but we finally we were able to conclude it came from this building." She took another deep breath to further calm herself. "We are looking to speak with the owner for further information."
During his years in the wizarding world, he only went to Diagon ally once a year during the summer when it was sunny, the shops bright and open, street vendors with summer articles galore and flower pots everywhere. The people were happy, dressed lightly and little children eating ice cream everywhere. His only regret was that they were always quick visits of haste so he h never truly had the time for exploring the street. He wondered how it would look during the winter with the street covered in snow and what shops there were he never had set foot in. He would take his time this visit now he finally could.
"I bet you'll love what they've done to the fountain then," Draco said, Andromeda still smiling fondly at them as she agreed with him. "Shall we go see?"
Charlie explained that the pen was a down scaled and simplified version of the reservoir. The one real difference being that it held no wards between the habitats but rather, they put ward stones on the young dragons. The ward stones designed to keep the dragon protected from attacks and attacking other dragons and also the Dragon Handlers new to the Reservoir, using the pen as a practice ground. The wards were similar but not identical to the warding in the reservoir, the main difference being that they didn't separate the species. They also didn't keep out any humans but did prevent other magical beings from entering, the wards on the reservoir flipped.
Bernadette smiled when she explained the card. Apparently it allowed Harry to move semi-free through the main building whenever he needed help from their researchers or labs. Basically, a keycard. He nodded dumbly and her smile broadened. "You're an open book to read. You want to help. So, I thought it wise for you to have some acces, some freedom to make use of our facility to do research. We have several labs that you'll find to be of use."
Draco glanced over his wand. Magic was a pleasure, until it was against you. Especially when it came down to laws. He'd experienced that once before and it wasn't something he would've wanted to repeat. It was a complete pain in the arse. He stared at Harry, still unmoving. The longer he stared and saw no difference the more he felt anger creep in. If only Harry had left him, he would've stayed out of trouble. But Harry hadn't and so he was.
If you have any problem or something with any OC, I'd like to hear. They'll be featuring more and more but now I can still make adjustments if pointed at. - Lyle.
Draco was still leaning with his back against the wall, his right leg curled around the boy who had made himself comfortable in his lap. Sitting sideways, Harry's legs were crossed and his feet lay on top of his bag - his shoulder was pressed between Draco's left arm and chest. Harry had his face buried in the crook of Draco's neck and his left hand, lying in his lap faced up innocently, the right one was slung around Draco's neck, in a tight embrace.
"Well, yes, I promised lots of pictures and letters to home," Harry admitted. "I plan on doing exactly that."
"I said it. I really like your house. Its very light and homey." Harry had a smile reaching from ear to ear as he now knew most of Charlie's excitement came from getting to show of the place he lived in and hoping for a positive review.
He only woke up when he had turned one too many times in the chair and fell out of it. He hit the floor with a thump, the dull sound loud, almost echoing through the room. Dazed, he scrambled up in a sitting position and frantically looked around, his sleep addled mind barely registering that Harry wasn't on the couch anymore. The moment he realized, he almost shouted out for Andromeda in panic, only to realize that, surely, if Harry had moved from the couch, he couldn't be dead, right?
"Calm down, sit down and," Harry pushed Draco into a chair, dumping his own bags beside the blond. "I'll get us some drinks and you can tell me all about."
"Thanks." Harry said to nothing, as Robert had gone out of sight. He left the shop while slipping the bar into his pocket as he went. He thought to take another stroll through the garden but didn't. Halfway over, he changed course and basically ran over to Charlie's home with the intent of grabbing his camera and then taking the walk, already hoping he could find the swarm of butterflies again and snap a picture. Just for fun, afterall he was here to relax and have fun. Maybe he could bring one of the books too, and do some light reading. The weather was good today, afterall.
"I don't know, I'll be right back." Harry answered instead and ran up the stairs, already cursing on the library. Something up there, definitely. Harry flung himself into the room, wand at the ready but, nothing out of the ordinary. The shelves seemed untouched, the books were on their place and the fire was down. Scratching the back of his head, he shuffled on his feet feeling slightly uneasy as he tried to determine whether or not the accidents in their home had something to do with the harsh treatment he'd given books previously. He hoped not. His mind not wanting to know what Draco would do upon hearing that fact but also realizing he would so not enjoy it.
"I can," Draco shrugged. "It's not that I have anything better to do and you're not all that bad a company."
If anyone would ask, then yes, Harry would say he liked the freedom in the form of a little keycard very much. Mrs. Bernadette Dell'elion had made quick work to pass his new privileges and reasons why, through the building. Harry appreciated that fact, because when he nervously tapped the door to the Dragon Handlers' office, he was greeted warmly by two out of three Souls. Both Shelley and Silas appeared friendly when they invited him in. The third however, Solomon, just barked at him to stop the nonsense and just step in. "Don't think every time you need us we'll bloody drop our work to open the door for you!"
"Come Teddy bear," Andromeda kissed his cheek and set him on the floor. "You'll be a good boy now and play with your toys."
Draco closed the door. The weather had changed massively since he spied outside. A storm brewed. Car alarms rang loud, a scooter beeped and the wind blew dust and garbage around. The first drops of rain splattered. Big drops. He watched Ron and Ginny walk away, pulling their hoods up with some trouble as their robes danced on the heavy wind.
"Shit." He said with no heat, using the foul muggle word he normally never dared uttering for the third time that day. He sagged to the floor, checked Harry's wrist for a pulse. "Nice timing, scar head. Now what?"
Andromeda was seated on the couch, little Teddy playing with his toys by her feet when Harry came in. She immediately noticed the small smile on his face and praised herself on a job well done. She knew, way before Harry had even come to her, that the black haired wizard shouldn't go back to Hogwarts. She had known he needed a while to just be free and when he had knocked on her door, she happily provided him with the means to do just that. Harry had taken to it big time and considering he was now in her kitchen, laying out stacks of books to learn what he needed to do what she suggested, she counted herself one lucky woman.
From there, the plan was a visit to France, visit the wizarding community there for a few days. According to Draco, they had a very large community going and that they could sign up for a tour around Beauxbatons. Harry loved the idea but also made a point of seeing the Eiffel Tower.
Harry sat stunned, still holding half a cup of tea as his eyes followed Andromeda who left the kitchen. True enough, they superficially cleared the air between them but neither boy was comfortable enough with the other yet as they hadn't gone further then dotting out each major event that happened during their years at Hogwarts and muttering out an apology as they acknowledged their part in said altercation.
Draco's left leg, pulled up to have his knee pressed into Harry's back, served as a point to lean his elbow on - his fingers wounded between the messy locks of Harry's hair. His other hand lay just beside Harry's and the pretty knife with crusted blood still on it was still firm in his grip.
Harry felt tired and knew he needed to sleep but every time he closed his eyes the events of the day filled his mind, especially the flying, and excitement rushed through him. He had loved it so much.
"Oh please, he doesn't want to get in my pants" Harry groaned, the way Draco kissed him yesterday said otherwise, in an annoying, arousing whisper. "Harry, he looks like he's ready to lick the ground you walk on"
"Really?" His frown deepened, lifting his hands from the keys to inspect them, they looked like completely average hands to him. "Yes! You have very beautiful hands Draco, they're meant to do wonderful things."
“Why did you let me come?” Harry asked, meeting Malfoy's eyes for the first time after they left, the blond boy looked clouded, as if he'd debating whether he should tell him about his reasons or not, it seems like he decided on the positive, since he answered; “I couldn't go back there alone, I tried..” Malfoy choked up, taking a shaky breath before continuing “I… I felt like you'd understand, since you were the one to save me and all… seemed appropriate.” Harry hummed, dropping his gaze at his now dirty hands. “I know you said you wouldn't help me anymore, sorry for dragging you into this again.” Malfoy said, making Harry look back at him “no! no.. don't apologise… I should be the one doing so, it's just-” just what? It just him not bothering to deal with his problems properly since it always worked out in the end? Honestly, Harry didn't know, and that only made him feel more guilty. “I'm truly sorry Malfoy” he tried desperately, remembering his decision to try again, not because he had to, but since he himself wished to do so. Draco looked at him for a long while before he reached for his back and grabbed a feisty Solus which screeched in his hands, and before Harry could form a question, he had been hit by a fur ball that felt like a fucking
So what brought these creatures to him? Could Malfoy even see them? or was he just bearing with the weight?
“Can you guys shut up? Potter was just dumb enough to run into Filch, and I was kind enough to let him stay the night.” Draco finally rose from his bed, taking his damn time stretching lazily, can't he see Harry is in a state of distress?!  Then, the Slytherin boy turned to Blaise, his eyes cold “and you would've known that if you weren't so busy snogging that Ravenclaw last night.” Blaise just shrugged but Harry could see a deep blush creeping up his face “whatever, you're late for breakfast.” He said and then grabbed his bag, giving Harry a wink before striding out of the dormitory.
“Welcome welcome!” Slughorn’s cheerful voice rang in his ears “it's good to see you all!” The old professor skipped to his board, leaning onto the thick teachers table “you are just beginning your wonderful year at Hogwarts! And I will be your potions teacher this year” of course slughorn will teach potions, after Snape's death there's no one else to do that, thinking about Snape made his shoulders heavier, shutting that thought he forced his gaze on the teacher.
“But a chance.. I can give.” Neville said at last, and somehow, a smile curled on Draco's face as he returned his gaze to the room, the Solus in front of him still sitting there, looking, and then bowing it's head as if thanking him, it's cracks expanding blooming with a soft orange color, rising up to the ceiling like fog before gathering up into a ball and flying through his chest.
Potter frowned at him, his dark eyebrows barely seen though his mess of a hair, yet his expression clear as day: disgust, discomfort, all the disses you could think of, all found their way into Potter face “shut it Malfoy”  his hand was leaning heavily on his hip,his intense green eyes burning Draco's pale skin, making him wonder why he felt so ashamed all of the sudden,so little under Potter's all knowing gaze, they glared at each other, not daring to say a thing but oh- Draco forgot, the Gryffindor house is all about daring! and running his life of course
"Still think I'm a brat?" Harry whispered as their foreheads rested against each other. "Oh, most definitely." Draco snapped back, through he clearly struggled to catch his breath.
“It's very common in the muggle world to cover up scars or old tattoos.” Potter cut him off. “They don't know who he is, they would think you were in some kind of emo phase or something, seriously, they won't bat an eye.” Draco couldn't form proper words, a pureblood getting tattooed by a muggle? In what world would that happen? Potter is mental, absolutely mental. “It's without Magic, so I don't think it will activate some sort of trap.” Potter insisted, his hand now squeezing Draco's arm tightly. Draco grunted uncomfortably, looking down at his mark, could that really be covered up? By muggles no less?
“And I really have no excuse, and no satisfying explanation that is worth forgiving...I just..I want to be better, I want to try” and he meant it, something in him really did want to try,it is his last year at Hogwarts, and he might as well do it here than wait for a funeral in order to cry about all the things he should've done.
Straightening up Draco ran a swift hand through his messed up hair, eyes darting between Harry and the hall. The Gryffindor couldn't help but sigh. Opening his mouth to speak when suddenly the blond turned sharply, rushing off down the hall without even saying goodbye.
While Ron and Hermione snuggled in bare daylight Harry took his time to look around himself, students from Gryffindor and Slytherin gathered up near the entrance all waiting for the professor to arrive, but Harry searched for a certain Slytherin which he failed to find
“Malfoy?” This voice cut through him like a knife, there would be no way in hell he'd forget the sound of his voice- Potter.
“This- this is a fuck ton of apples!” Draco exclaimed, his rich background seeping through like sand “I've never even stepped into a kitchen? And you expect me to peel
"You will surpass me, Draco. And the father before me, you will be the best there is. That is in your blood. That is your only choice." He squeezed his shoulder, grounding Draco to their expensive carpet. "The Malfoy name is a heavy burden." He said
A restless Hufflepuff  was kicking Malfoy in a middle of an empty circle created by the crowd, no one besides wailing Pansy, who screamed in horror didn't seem to bat an eye, they all shared this fury, yet only one was able to express it, and Malfoy let him.
“Nice sweater. Green suits you.” The Slytherin boy said in the end, his smile widening and revealing two rows of perfect white teeth. Harry gasped, his head snapping to look at his clothes. Right, he borrowed Draco's pajamas yesterday, which was fine during the night, but now when the cruel sunlight revealed him, Harry truly realized that he, a proud Gryffindor, was wearing multiple shades of green as his sleepwear which may or may not belong to an actual Slytherin, who was still lying on the bed they had previously spent the night in. They didn't do anything, Harry was just creeped out by sleeping in a dead person's bed, and sharing one with a very much alive Malfoy is a way better option.
“How do you think they will call us today?” Draco whined, yanking his blanket off a bit too aggressively so those little shits jumped away, they did, but one of them actually bit Draco, he hissed loudly throwing that thing off his bed
“Weird, I can't see anything” Hermione narrowed her eyes at the Slytherin, signing “ maybe it's like thestrals, only the ones that have seen death could see them”
“it..it will..I guess” Harry scratched the back of his neck awkwardly, “we saw him being taken...you know.. Malfoy’s father..” Ron mumbled, his usually bright eyes suddenly darkening, Hermione took a deep breath at his side.
While gazing at his pale nape, Harry's eye locked onto the thin line between his collar fabric and Malfoy's actual skin, Slytherin colors suited him, Harry thought, the cold green like a splash of paint on fresh snow, if Malfoy was an element, he'd probably be ice, cold and beautiful but fairly useless under the heat of sun.
“Oh come on man, what's wrong?”  Ron leaned onto the table, exploring Harry's expression carefully, Harry sighed and put down his wand, turning around to face his friend “I met Draco in the toilet” Ron rose an eyebrow at him, suddenly smirking “ooooOoooOooohh… did you-”
“I can see them” he said, Draco did not get him at first, but his heart dropped dead on the floor when realization hit him,of course, how could he forget this burdening weight? Draco gaped at him, trying to appear clueless even though the creature is digging its nails into his nape, Potter went on “I know you can see them too,the creatures” Draco dropped his gaze, Potter
“Well, I certainly do not feel I made any mistakes” McGonagall said, lifting her cup again before drinking it “Hogwarts is your home,just like the other students”
Squeezing his eyes tight shut he felt the mattress shift with Potter's added weight, who now probably laid besides him. Draco did his best to fall asleep, thinking about anything that could distract him from the git he's sharing his bed with. He counted sheeps, thought about his mother, about Quidditch, and how the weight on his back is way less suffocating than It had been before, two Solus gone into the unknown, both leaving with such pretty colors, only leaving Draco to wonder where they went. And a small part of him, slowly noticing that none of them never really
“Way to go Ron.” Hermione groaned “wha- I didn't mean him! I meant- I meant them!” He pointed at the eighth year Slytherins shamelessly
