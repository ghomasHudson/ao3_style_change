Remus was pacing as well as he could at the mouth of the tunnel, which was the only part large enough to accommodate a seventeen-year-old boy standing. Peter sat closest to him, hugging his knees to his chest as if to make himself as small as possible so the rest of them had enough room. James had attempted to lean against the rounded wall of the tunnel for the first few minutes, but stooping so that his head didn't hit the ceiling had given him muscle spasms, and he'd finally taken to crouching across from Peter.
"Good," said Bowie. "Once we are out, Flitwick and I will referee. We expect nice, clean duels from all of you. Nothing illegal, nothing lethal. Got it?"
to a Death Eater and expect to get the truth! We have to lay a trap, probably dig through his stuff, and if you have any friends or relatives in the States you could write to—"
"Stop stalling, Black!" shouted Bowie from the sidelines, lighting up another smoke. "Hex your Charms Professor or I'll hex you!"
Dumbledore's last will and testament. Months in a cold, dingy tent struggling to figure out what those last words meant, if it was a clue that could bring down Voldemort or save their lives.
Severus hovered closer and murmured where only Draco could hear, "Regulus Black. He's a sixth year, but he's good. Not quite up to Bellatrix's level, but enough to wipe the floor with Lupin. And he'd enjoy a go at his disgraced brother."
Harry tore his eyes away from the Snitch flapping in James's fist to find Remus watching him expectantly.
"Why, you little scumbag," said Rodolphus, taking a few threatening steps forward and raising his wand. "Do you know who it is you're talking to?"
James let his head drop in his free hand and made the hissing spell even louder. "I'm going to smother him with his pillow tonight, I swear to the Founders."
"I only meant," said Kingsley, "it wasn't your fault. Not Remus, nor Tonks, nor any of the others. We all knew the risks, and we chose to stay and fight that day."
"And what, Mallory followed him under Voldemort's orders?" James asked, trying to keep the sarcasm out of his voice and really consider it. "I don't know about this, Pads…."
"Sorry," he muttered, unable to look Malfoy in the eye. The full understanding of what he'd done hit him, and he wished he could sink into the floor. He had attacked his father in a classroom of children and then clung to Draco Malfoy for protection like a maiden in a bodice-ripper novel. His face felt unbearably hot. "I don't— uh— I don't need the hospital wing. I'm fine now. Uh, sorry."
Suddenly, Rodolphus's wand flew from his grasp and into the waiting hand of Draco Malfoy. Rabastan's followed suit a split second later.
Two of the three Hallows had come to him in a moment of need, even though… even though they didn't belong to him. Not in the here and now. The Elder Wand was still Dumbledore's, just like the Cloak was James's.
Behind him, he thought he heard Malfoy mutter something about idiotic Gryffindors before he started after him.
After a couple of hours, Malfoy set down his book, stretched, and raked a hand through his chestnut hair.
"Oh, shove off!" Malfoy laughed. He seemed lighter than he had been in weeks. "We can't all be as bloody reckless as
They could only keep up a constant barrage of spells, hexes, jinxes, and charms for so long before they simply got exhausted.
"Bloody Gryffindors," he muttered. "Fine. I'll come with you, make sure you don't attack any passing first years on the way. Unstable sodding skiver…."
"It's just, you and Mallory just transferred," said Remus, unsure where Harry had gotten lost. "Why would they be so close unless they had known each other already?"
"As loathe as I am to offer it," said Draco with a sneer and contemptuous once-over in Harry's direction, "lunch? You look as if you haven't had a decent meal since sixth year. I could have Addie arrange sandwiches and tea."
"Fine," said Rodolphus curtly, apparently taking the lead since Dolohov had cracked. "Give Dolohov back his wand, and we'll go."
call him by his given name, he supposed he could allow it. His family— and the rest of the Slytherin House, honestly— would have been horrified to hear a Mudbl— a Muggle-born call a pureblood by their first name, but his family didn't need to know. And the Slytherin House could get crushed under the lake for all he cared.
"I did," said Harry, and he surprised himself with how earnest it came out. He found himself grinning as he leaned back and told Lily about it, even though he knew Lily wasn't much of a flyer and equally didn't care about Quidditch. But she listened fondly, her Potions text ignored, as he finished, "…and then Regulus came back out looking for his broom and chased us off. Threatened to tear my spine out through my ar— ah,
Draco didn't know what to do. The Marauders had spent six years building up a following in the school, becoming idols, while Draco was the new kid. And Severus had spent six years establishing himself as an oddball outcast. They didn't have a leg to stand on.
He didn't know how long he stood there, but, slowly, he became aware of staring into space, his breathing returned to normal and holding his wand, which had been stashed under his pillow, in a white-knuckled grip at his side.
"They were talking about Fiendfyre," said Sirius suddenly, frowning as his eyes clouded in thought. "That's powerful magic. And a student— that Vincent bloke— cast it. It sounded like he couldn't control it properly and it turned on him, but even being able to make something that powerful
"An incredible power," murmured Dumbledore again, not looking at Draco. "But how could it be possible? There must be a piece we are missing…."
Mallory got the Keeper position, James noted, ignoring Sirius. He was pretty good. It made him wonder how good he was as a Seeker if Keeper was only his second choice.
Until a male voice called, "Parker, come sit here!" And then, "Shove over Padfoot, suck it in, Wormtail. Moony, what in the blazes are you doing reading a book at the welcoming feast for? Put that up before I take points. PARKER!"
He proceeded to ignore Rosier and Wilkes with the magnanimous grace he'd picked up from his mother at holiday balls. She had normally employed it against those pureblood and half-blood families with recent besmirches to their names— a daughter marrying a Muggleborn, a son producing a squib heir— but Draco had learned the tool well enough to use it for his own agenda.
Harry abruptly realized the phrase "extendable ears" probably sounded strange to someone who had never met the Weasley twins. However, he rubbed his throbbing shins, scowled, and didn't deign to explain.
Then Malfoy said, sounding both angry and shaken, "What the hell was that, Potter? McGonagall was right; that was a transfiguration lesson, not a free-for-all! And I thought you
Feeling uncomfortably like an outsider, Draco edged off to the side and watched as Dumbledore performed first aid and Potter supported McKinnon, though he looked as if he needed the treatment just as badly. Potter's face was unnaturally pale and gray, and Draco could see the way his muscles trembled even under the heavy cloak.
"It is a matter of the sheer volume of time in question," Dumbledore had tried to explain during one of their many discussions in the past week as they tried to figure out what to do. "Changing a decision here or there in the immediate past is transmutable. The future may restore itself like the river winding around a single stone breaking its current to resume its original path. But twenty years…. If you move a single stone, then that may cause another stone to shift a year from now, and then perhaps two more stones to shift two years from now, and so on, until you have a raging rapid where there was once a tranquil stream. Do you see the greater issue at stake here, Mr. Potter?"
After a stony moment of silence, Malfoy said, "The war took too many things I cared about. It won't get flying, too. If you were half the Gryffindor I thought you were, you wouldn't let it take something you loved from you, either."
The rat really was their friend. They included him, they listened to him, they went out of their way to reassure him when he hadn't tested high enough to continue a class with them.
Harry waited patiently. Dumbledore had been much more comforting and informative, but perhaps he was busy this time. Or maybe 'his party' wasn't cooperating this time, because it wouldn't give him robes, either.
"Don't you—" began Harry, incensed, but he was interrupted by a pointed cough from the doorway into the Great Hall. He turned guiltily and saw Professor McGonagall leveling them a disapproving look. "Sorry, Professor."
The three boys hadn't noticed them yet. They could still leave and continue on their journey to the afterlife.
Herrod and Schrodinger were killed in the first few minutes. Then the Death Eaters formed a circle around Harry and Ron, blocking the exits and keeping them constantly deflecting hexes from all sides, even as Harry and Ron dueled other Death Eaters one-on-one inside the circle.
Harry's heart felt a little lighter for the rest of the trek. Sure, maybe James was too caught up in Lily to pay him much attention, and yeah, he might have gotten off on the wrong foot with Sirius, but Harry still had Remus. It was enough.
will take over and duel the primary. The second may defeat the primary, in which case he will stay and continue to duel that primary's second, or he may lose, in which case the original primary may duel the opponent's third, and so on. Basically, once we start, we are in this until one team is fully finished. There is as much strategy in planning the order of a team in dueling as there is in any Quidditch match. Understand?"
Harry could only stare in open-mouthed astonishment as James started toward them, and Sirius and Remus dove to grab him.
But Mallory had been cool and collected under that intense barrage. He had gotten off a few offensive spells of his own, sure, but he'd mainly fought defensively, hiding behind his Shield Charm or reflecting spells back at Sirius.
He was polite and quiet, and he mostly spent his free time with the girls or in the library, but there were sticky moments whenever he interacted with the Marauders either in class or in the dorms.
Malfoy shot to his feet and stumbled back as if Harry had electrocuted him. His expression was wild.
Draco had first noticed it the night before when he'd found the large group huddled together in the common room when they should have been at dinner. Their heads had been bent forward, and they were talking lowly with unusually serious expressions for a group of mostly teenaged boys.
With an effort, he forced it down and swallowed hard, taking a long swig of juice to wash it down. When he was able, he said, trying to affect disinterest even as his eyes watered, "He only meant I was raised in the Wizarding world. He wasn't. I'm not sure he understands the difference between pureblood and half-blood, honestly. It was different at Ilvermorny."
"How odd you are, Parker," murmured Regulus. "Yesterday you were ready to duel my brother. And today you talk about him as if he were a hero. How very odd."
"The Mudblood and the Chosen One," he said, over the sound of the streetlamp beside him exploding from one of Harry's missed spells. "My lucky day."
"Right," said Bowie, his voice carrying. "We shall demonstrate how a duel in numbers works in reality. Professor Flitwick and I will try to incapacitate one another, and once one is incapacitated— I know not yet which of us, though I regret it may be me— his
"What!" squawked Sirius indignantly. He raised himself up and said, "I accept your challenge, Sir Flops-a-lot, because I have…
"The duel goes to Mr. Mallory. However, our instructions on non-lethal parameters were clear. Whatever that spell was, it was too much for a gentleman's duel, kid. You're out. Thirds and fourths, do you wish to continue?"
But Sirius couldn't see where he was aiming through the smoke, and the curse went wide, missing Malfoy entirely and soaring into the audience of students. The professors were on the wrong side of the stage, Sirius's side, they were too slow—
They paced, Harry trailing a finger along the desk to ground himself, Kingsley tucking his hands into his sleeves in a meditative pose.
He considered going to Malfoy about it but discarded that idea instantly. Malfoy didn't know about the Hallows or the role they had played in the war. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Dumbledore were the only ones who had chased that particular fairy tale. Even Voldemort had only been interested in the Elder Wand; he might not have ever heard Beetle the Bard's stories, growing up in a Muggle orphanage as he had. He wouldn't have spoken to his Death Eaters about anything other than a particularly powerful wand, the Deathstick.
"But… the full moon isn't until next week," said Wormtail, breaking the macabre train of James's thoughts. Wormtail fidgeted with the hem of his robes as they turned to look at him. "He can't have lycanthropy. If he went to see Madam Pomfrey yesterday… well, the last full moon was over two weeks ago. He wouldn't still be injured. Remus heals pretty fast. Right?"
"Sorry," said Harry, even though he wasn't. He was too busy dealing with his own upturned worldview.
"Usually, he'll try asking her out for the whole weekend first," Remus told Harry matter-of-factly. "Then when she turns him down, he'll try wheedling her out for one drink at the Broomsticks."
"What do we think of Parker?" asked Sirius. There was a cold, calculating glint in his eye that always made James uncomfortable.
Draco threw himself through the hole in the wall and dove to intercept the Killing Curse aimed at Harry.
"It was the only way to save the ones you wished to protect," corrected the hat. "There were alternatives. You didn't even consider them."
"He's no Gryffindor!" shouted Sirius, leaping back onto the stage and clutching his wand. His robes had a scorched and smoking hole on the left side, show blistered red skin underneath.
"Next, we are very pleased to welcome back Professor Kettleburn from his sudden mid-term vacation last spring, and he asks that you please refrain from asking personal questions about the two fingers missing on his remaining arm."
The part that threw him was: Why would Voldemort care anything about a sixteen- or seventeen-year-old child? The way Harry had phrased it had struck him as very personal. If Ilvermorny had been attacked, as James and Sirius both inferred, Harry hadn't just fought Voldemort for a split second in the midst of a much larger attack.
Rosier scowled. Several of the Slytherins looked offended on his behalf. The other students remained silent.
James started, providing the distraction so the others could levitate, toss, or downright run their bundles of fireworks to the proper locations. It had taken forever to figure out the spell used to enchant the floating candles and
Sirius drew up to Malfoy until they were almost toe-to-toe, but Malfoy refused to move. A moment later, Malfoy blasted him back with a wind charm Harry didn't recognize, but there was enough brute strength that Sirius couldn't avoid it.
Transfiguration had Harry wishing he'd done more preparation before jumping right back into school. Taking a year off while studying little more than Defense had seen his sixth year transfiguration knowledge dry up. It was far worse than the little things he usually forgot after a long summer holiday. Instead of forgetting details and specifics, he found he had forgotten entire spells and concepts.
as soon as he cast it. I didn't think anyone aside from Dumbledore and a few Aurors could do something like that."
Regulus was a graceful flyer. Not flashy by any means, but a Seeker didn't need to be flashy. They just needed to be observant and fast. By his scrupulous judging of the candidates, he was both.
The Great Hall fell into darkness without the candles. The moon and stars lined everything in the most fragile silver. The Gryffindor table alone stood out as the fading lilies glowed softly, blanketing them.
"You are, in fact, the actual worst. Even if you weren't famous for surviving the Killing Curse, you should have died at least a dozen times by now."
"Still trying to remember if I ended up in the hospital wing in fifth year…. I'm sure I must have, but what
world thought of Slytherins after the war, Draco was proud of his ambition and cunning. He had both aplenty.
Ridiculous, proud, stubborn Gryffindors. It was no wonder McKinnon had gotten herself killed, a Mudblood as cocky as her.
He gave up the pretense of strolling through the shops very quickly and let his feet take him straight to Knockturn Alley.
Potter dug in his pockets with the hand not supporting McKinnon and produced a wand Draco found vaguely familiar. He held it out to Dumbledore silently.
. He and Remus were the only two seventh year Gryffindors not covered in splattered breakfast food. Some of the other years and nearby Houses weren't as lucky, either. "It's— ah— come in handy more than once."
"Hogwarts," said Gertrude firmly, and then she winced, hand gripping her ribs. "I don't… I'd feel safer at Hogwarts."
Grudgingly, the flame-snake moved to the center of Slytherin table, and Sirius split some of the candle flames from the mass to become a clutch of eggs, which the
His left ear went warm, then prickly, and then the volume of the conversations around him increased while, at the same time, the words became muffled. He reached up and felt a warm, floppy, shaggy ear. His mirror confirmed it was black and reasonably like a dog's.
Though Harry was able to admit he had never known Dumbledore as well as he'd thought, even he knew Dumbledore could not be so cruel as to pretend not to remember him.
James fought them for a few tense moments, but then he pulled himself together with a visible effort. He took a deep, overdramatic breath, closing his eyes, and slowly his color began to fade back to normal. He shook Sirius and Remus off with a quiet, "Alright, it's alright. I'm fine. I'm fine."
"Wormtail, the trapdoor!" said Sirius, right before transforming into a shaggy black dog and tackling James from behind.
, was Harry's usual answer, born out of years of not even remembering his parents, but somehow the words stuck in his throat this time.
"Yeah," said Harry, not meeting his eyes. "Yeah. We had our own troubles. At Ilvermorny, I mean. People were dying. Nobody cared about
Harry and the others gave a respectful and somewhat surprised round of applause for Professor Flitwick, who chuckled and gave a good-natured bow.
"Couldn't have done a Sonorus?" muttered Malfoy irritably, still cringing as he uncovered his own ears.
Dumbledore blinked once. Slowly, as if in a dream, he took the wand and looked it over, that glazed expression still on his face. Then his eyes sharpened, and he examined Potter meticulously.
"Poor sad sod never takes it any easier, either," Sirius added. "Quidditch tryouts or no, he'll be moping the rest of the week."
"Ah, Parker," said a voice at once very familiar and oddly foreign. "Not trying out for Gryffindor?"
"We learned how to light a candle in first year, Potter," she said, pulling out her wand. "I think I've got this."
Draco knew what spell he was going to utter before he even opened his mouth. He didn't think, didn't pause to consider what he was doing.
Harry looked back at the matron, shocked, but then cowered under her stern look. His gaze shot to Draco, questioning, and Draco lifted a shoulder as carelessly as he could.
Thanks for reading, and thanks to Stoneage_Woman for the beta read! Don't be too hard on Sirius just yet. I know that was a super dick-move, but he'll get better. And this was a pretty short chapter. The next one should be longer again (the duel!!). Thanks for all the support, and stay tuned! ❤
Blue and white sparks erupted from the table, flowing and crashing over it like an ocean wave, complete with misty spray. James flicked and jabbed his wand in their direction, a modified
"You had a choice," said the hat. "Mr. Potter, you chose to sacrifice yourself to save everyone you loved. You walked into a forest where you knew you would die. You faced He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named and didn't defend yourself. You walked to your death willingly."
"And I've given this some thought, and I noticed Mallory and Harry's families both moved to the States some seven or eight years ago; that's about the same time Voldemort returned to Britain and announced himself to the public.
Mallory had pressed his advantage, using Sirius's shaken confidence to boost his own, fighting more and more aggressively, fighting to win and damn the cost, fighting…
"Well, why didn't you just say so?" asked the hat jovially. "In that case, it's easy enough. You'll go to GRYFFINDOR!"
James counted it down with what would look like an absent-minded tapping of his fork against his plate to the casual observer.
"Alright, let me see where you're at," said Bowie. "I can't think of a better student to start us off than our very own Head Boy. Come up here, Mr. Potter."
As the girls led the way to the next class, closely followed by the Marauders, Harry resisted the urge to look back at Malfoy. It was bad enough Malfoy had made him look weak in front of the entire class— for once, a class of strangers who didn't know him as the Boy Who Lived or the Savior of the Wizarding World— now he'd made Harry look like a Slytherin sympathizer in front of
"Hey," said Sirius, jutting his chin toward the Slytherin table. "What's your friend talking to Regulus about?"
Draco forced himself not to flinch. With all those looks he had received in the past month, he should be used to it.
"It was my fault," he insisted quietly. The words he had been keeping to himself for months, even from Ron and Hermione though he suspected they knew, poured out of him in a soft, hoarse rush. "Voldemort was after me. You lot would never have been in that position if I had stayed away. Everyone who died…."
"Harry—" came Ron's voice several yards away, out of breath. He was moving as he continued, "—Malfoy tricked us!
Draco made it to the Alchemy classroom in a pensive mood. He sat next to Severus and was rewarded with suspicious, furrowed eyebrows and silence.
, Harry," said Hermione, suddenly very close, and they were on the ground, and— "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have pushed. I know it's too soon. I'm sorry. Just breathe, Harry, just breathe. We're alright. It'll be alright."
"Here, you've still got some hair in your ear—" said James, raising his own wand toward Harry's face.
"To our new students, welcome!" he said in a ringing voice. "To our old hands, welcome back! I have only a few start-of-terms notices before we sink into this delicious feast and become too befuddled by good food and good company to pay attention to an old man's ramblings.
He curled in on himself, groaning in pain. He felt the skin of his arms against the bare skin of his chest.
"Right," said James, clapping his hands and straightening up briskly. "Next items on the agenda: recruiting Harry to the Quidditch team, and convincing Lily to join me in Hogsmeade. Who has ide—"
James plopped onto the bench next to Harry at breakfast the following morning as if it were the most natural thing in the world. He was playing with a Snitch exactly like Harry had seen in Snape's memory from his fifth year.
"So, why do you think he defended you today?" asked Remus. His face was impassive, but it wasn't judgmental, at least. He seemed genuinely curious.
He wasn't clear on how to exact his revenge just yet, but he trusted his instincts, his cunning, to have something by dawn.
Harry shrugged once, still trying to recall. "First year I nearly swallowed the Snitch, but I only ended up in the hospital wing at the end of the year over the philosopher's stone incident. Second year—"
Dolohov, who was as free as a bird in this timeline, torturing poor Gertrude before he planned to kill her too. Dolohov, with Voldemort, who was still alive and reigning in terror, despite the fact that Harry had
Draco opened his mouth to snap no, that he didn't want their seconds to try to talk either of them out of it for any condition, but he stopped. He smiled his own chilly little smile. "Yes," he said. "I will accept your
After a moment, he said, "I don't know what happened between Voldemort and Harry, but I agree with Moony that we'll have to wait for him to tell us. Whatever it was, if Voldemort was the one who cast the Killing Curse on him, that means he's Voldemort's enemy, and that makes him our friend. Let's give him a chance, alright?" he added in Sirius's direction.
" said Harry again. His heart pounded violently against his ribcage, so hard he was afraid it would jump out. Blood rushed in his ears like a waterfall. "
them. Potter Senior and Black in particular got admiring glances from their peers for just about everything.
So sorry for the delay! I had most of chapter 7 written when I posted chapter 6, but I was really unhappy with it. Instead of continuing on to finish it and write chapter 8, I decided to scrap 7 and start all over... three more times. So, basically, what I'm saying is that you've caught up with me now. I have not started chapter 8 yet. I'm planning to skip this Friday's update and try to get back on schedule starting next week. I just didn't want to make y'all wait any longer on this one. Please leave me comments and let me know what you think! I love hearing from you.
. And then Aunt Bella wanted to test me when she came to live at the manor. She… she actually fights a lot like your Sirius. Quick, aggressive…. She's the one who taught me that spell. The Dark Lord taught her, you see. She and Snape were his… pupils, I suppose, in the Dark Arts."
They didn't— those Death Eaters hadn't had children, had they? They would have been in the years surrounding Harry at Hogwarts, and he would have recognized them—
"The rest I'll have to triple-check, but I'm nearly certain that's all the half-bloods or less crossed off."
"You'll tell the world?" He thought about Mrs. Weasley learning her youngest son was a killer. He thought about Hermione finding out what her husband might have done. He thought about Rose and Hugo growing up without a dad.
She pointed to the house elf who led him to a door in the back marked private and then left. There wasn't an exit besides going right back through her office.
He continued going through the questionnaire and threw out a few things but eventually settled on 25 questions, all but two multiple choice.
They started walking, the air tenser than he knew what to do with, though thankfully it didn't take long for Malfoy to break the silence.
"I thought you might say that. The mission is over, though, and you won't be interested in furthering the other aspects of our relationship."
As they walked towards the stairs, they were led past countless empty display cases, and Malfoy's eyebrows rose higher at each one.
There was no way to save the situation, even after trying a few less technical moves. Alicia refused to cooperate and when Harry spun her and she fell over his misplaced foot, she got up off the floor and ran from the room.
Then Malfoy was gone with a pop, and Harry was left staring at the empty space where he'd been. He wondered why this felt like such a win, when only moments ago he'd wanted to do anything that would end with Malfoy gone.
He stood there for a moment, breathing harshly while Harry and Verity stared at him before he schooled his face into a grotesque mimic of the businesslike expression he'd had when they first saw each other that morning.
"That's what you need, Harry. A questionnaire to weed out the people that just want you for your stunningly good looks and fame."
Harry blinked. Well, that was something. He walked towards the very back of the stacks where he knew Peter wouldn't be able to see or hear him and removed his invisibility cloak so he could see better. The file wasn't nearly as full as he thought it'd be, but he attributed that to the fact that these were only the cold cases and gave himself a mental  pat on the back.
When they had finished up all their purchases and bought foot-long hot dogs from a vendor which Malfoy grimaced at and declined, it was 6:30 and they had half an hour drop Teddy off at the hotel and get to the Shaw's flat.
Harry guided him into a sitting position. Ron's eyes were still squinted shut against the bright light, but he didn't need to be actively glaring for Harry to feel the intent.
Harry thought of fire and Malfoy's long arms thrown around Goyle's unconscious body. He thought of smoke, the feeling of coughing it up, and Malfoy's face as he screamed Crabbe's name outside the Room of Requirement. It was hard to imagine the Slytherins living like Harry and his friends did, but being so distant from one another seemed wrong too. They were bonded in the same way the Gryffindors had been, right?
Malfoy's shoulders were draped in a large black cloak, a red bat seal pinned on one side of his chest.
Malfoy laughed breathily. "I'm fine, Potter, are you okay? You're the one who just had your first gay experience here." He was still panting but he grinned when Harry shoved him.
Which was a good thing, too, because the Bats caught the snitch just as they turned back to the game.
"But sir," he put a hand on the man's arm, trying to reason with him, but he was suddenly grabbed from behind by an unknown person who tried to throw him on the ground. He responded instinctively after years of Auror Training and threw the assailant back.
"Yes, I suppose it has to do more with the other employees than it does with me. And my bloody arsewipe of a boss."
"Ha-bloody-ha. Malfoy's going to be so ruddy pleased with himself when he sees it. I told you to hire a professional," he mocked, scoffing and breaking off a bit of crust.
"I'll stop you there," Malfoy said and Teddy snorted a bit. "There's no way I'm going to watch a bunch of ruddy Americans run around making fools of themselves."
Malfoy and Ginny broke out laughing again and Jerome looked like he was caught in the middle of something he did not want to be a part of.
He looked up when he heard the glass in front of him being filled with wine and he offered Malfoy a grateful grimace.
"No really, it's fine. Now that everything's cleared up, we can keep working to find your dad's killer."
Cynthia Price was surprisingly happy to meet with them and she only mentioned Harry's fame in passing. It was refreshing.
Lee stared at her, and then he snapped out of his reverie and said, "Whatever the lady wants. If that's seeing me without clothing, well..." Ginny blushed. "Sure I'd prefer other venues, but I have no complaints."
They were an almost perfect description of Rita Skeeter since her renown had been trashed and he told her so. Harry almost continued on about the last time he'd seen Rita, when she'd been crying on the ministry's steps to anyone who'd listen, when Ron came in carrying Hugo.
"Merlin, what's up your arse?" Ginny asked as he spun Harry around in a circle, dipping him low. Harry laughed, shoving Ron away and to a seat.
He got to the Burrow just in time for dinner that night and he set down Mr. and Mrs. Weasley to tell them what would be appearing in the papers the next day. Mrs. Weasley held his hand and cried, not because she was sad or regretted him not being able to marry Ginny, but because he'd told her just like she was his mum. Mr. Weasley hugged him and told him they could go to a muggle gay club together if he liked because he'd always wanted to go to one. Harry was torn between not wanting to and really really wanting to see what Mr. Weasley thought gay muggles dressed like. In the end, he decided to take a rain check. He told himself again and again how worthwhile this would all be, even if Draco still wouldn't forgive him. He wasn't sure how much he believed it.
"We still haven't found the bastard who did it. He's out there somewhere, feeling proud of what he's done. My father was not a good man, hell, he wasn't even a good father half the time, but I loved him. My mother did too. It's driven her mad all these years, waiting for them to come for her next, come for me. She was supposed to be with him that night but she was too sick to go. She still blames herself."
"Don't be so hard on yourself. Patronuses are all about conjuring something from your happiness. They won't work if you aren't focused on that."
"It's now 10:15 am," he said, looking at his watch as he walked, turning back around to scream at them, "which means you're spending valuable business time with the shop still closed!"
Verity grinned, pumping his hand up and down, looking faintly ridiculous at her short, plump stature in comparison to Malfoy, considering how forceful she could be.
Zabini stepped forward elegantly, commanding the room's attention. "My client was the original financier of Weasley's Wizard Wheezes and, as such, he maintains the authority to make any and all legal choices concerning its foreclosure under the 1896 Wizards for Welfare Act. It is the nature of such a business that, in the event of both former co-owners are no longer being alive, a decline of patronage, profit, and reputation is expected. Mr Potter cannot be held at fault for this eventuality, nor should he be prohibited from exercising his right to reestablish a plan for growth. Business turnover from one owner to the next is never without its trials. That is all, Your Worship, thank you."
It wasn't much later in the day when she kicked him out. Maybe he should go visit Andromeda. It'd been a while since he'd been over there. He used to go all the time to visit Teddy, but then he'd gone off to Hogwarts and Harry'd started to only stop by every month or so to bring her flowers — Andromeda, of course, though the vendor called them Pieris. That was before her memory started to go as well. Everything from how clean she used to keep the house to what she talked about changed. She still had moments of lucidity, but it was so hard to be around. She'd grown to be like family to him, and he'd already lost enough family.
Fine. If this was how Ron wanted to do it, this was how it would be done. It was out of Harry's hands, anyway. Now he just had to wait.
Malfoy laughed. He actually laughed a full-bodied thing that shook his frame and made his eyes water. "You're shitting me! You thought Weasley set us up as the answer to your love life? You just told me you're not even gay!"
With a slow twirl of his wand, Harry cleared a spot on the floor about the size of a galleon. Malfoy followed suit, and for a while, they worked in silence.
"Do you think you could make more? I've started planning the grand re-opening," he shuddered, "and I've gotten nowhere so far with new products, but this is... perfect."
"Ron, half the women that applied are Potter-Crazy, a third of them are already married but promise they're willing to leave their husband for me if I'm insistent on non-monogamy, and the rest all fail in one way or another I just can't ignore."
Malfoy grabbed the empty cup out of his hands and took the other two as well. When he was out of the room, Rosier smiled at Harry.
Malfoy helped him pick a scarf for Hermione as well as a photo album that had the New York City skyline across the cover in Red, White, and Blue that he thought was just the right side of tacky.
Ginny stood, pulling Harry into a tight hug and then stepping away before she spoke. "I think it might be best for all of us to let go. We can't keep it going without them. It'd be a money pit, and the Ministry knows it."
"life-threatening circumstances for which Mr Malfoy is the direct cause; substantial and well-documented proof of assessment bias; or Mr Malfoy's untimely demise, upon which his immortal soul does not remain as a magical portrait, contactable spirit, ghost, or ghost-like being."
He still wasn't capable of calling Malfoy by his first name, did he really think a relationship would work?
His only friends these days were Parkinson and Goyle. Zabini had fucked off to France right after the final battle and no one had heard from him since. Malfoy's mother has grown more protective of him over the years, though he hadn't thought it possible. She told him day after day that she'd do anything to make him happy.
He dragged her into the kitchen by the arm and pushed her into a chair next to Ron, who was scarfing down food at a pace almost equivalent to his usual gusto.
Harry laughed and dragged Malfoy outside where they could find a cab. No way were they going to Apparate without Splinching. Flooing, too, was out of the question and not just because of his robe choices. Hermione would have applauded his decisions for once, though she'd left much earlier on to get home in time to tuck the kids into bed.
"Well now, Mr. Potter, I remember you. Minerva has been writing me for years telling me how hard she's tried to get you on her staff."
"Sure you were. There's not a person alive today who didn't hate him for one reason or another. Well, it's no matter anyway. You should be going."
Have you spent your life dreaming of a date with Harry Potter? Now could be your chance! The young wizard is looking for someone to settle down with and welcomes anyone to fill out the questionnaire attached below to apply. Answer for an opportunity to be chosen as Harry Potter's Lucky Lady!
Malfoy fell back onto the couch and Harry straddled his legs so he could grind against him. Then, he finally did what he'd been wanting to since the day at the hotel when that drop of water slid down Malfoy's neck and he mouthed at it, letting the small gasps guide him as to what was best. "Then I'm figuring shit out," he said between kisses, "and you're helping me."
Harry and Malfoy made eye contact and he smirked. "Potter, you know everyone else but allow me to introduce Jerome." The man Malfoy was referring to was sitting next to him and smiling brightly. He seemed younger than the rest of them, probably in his early 20s and Harry immediately didn't like him. He wasn't one to take his hunches for granted, but he wasn't about to be rude either. He stuck out his hand for Jerome to shake.
How would he even tell Draco that? Like, 'Hey, by the way, my best mate totally murdered your dad. Also, I'm practically in love with you so please don't overreact and kill him, thanks.' Merlin, he was a mess.
When he got there, Draco let him in and led him to his mother with only a, "She thought you'd come by again."
Harry looked back to where he'd been seated before and saw a woman leaned back elegantly, a smirk on her cherry-red lips. She had on a pair of sunnies in the same shade, and flaxen blonde curls pinned neatly atop her head.
It was almost noon before he saw anyone else. Verity marched up to him and dragged him into the hallway, and he didn't put up much protest. By that point, Harry had taken off his robes and was sweating through his shirt, sleeves rolled up to his elbows and glasses fogging from the exertion.
He was supposed to meet with the Ministry's hack here at half eight. The owl he'd received had instructed him to arrive fifteen minutes early, go down to Level 9, take the stairs to Level 10, and head towards the third courtroom. When he got to his stop, Harry was the only one left on the lift. Everyone else had gotten off a few floors earlier, leaving him to brave the way alone.
The next song crackled through the old speakers and Harry had to admit he liked this one better too. Well, admit it privately, at least. I see a red door and I want it painted black...
He was an utter wanker who thought being gay was the end of the world, he wouldn't help Draco find out who killed his father, and he'd forgotten what it was like to feel anything.
Fuck. Hermione had made him try speed dating a few times before and it had always ended badly. Once with a cup of punch in his face, and multiple times with rioting by witches he just couldn't connect with.
Draco stuttered something, possibly a polite thank you, possibly just a bizarre unintelligible croaking noise, and pulled his hand away. He stuffed it in his pocket.
— living soul.' It would be… unheard of, but perhaps not impossible, that his magic transported you back to Dolohov's first victim so that you could stop it."
The flames shuddered for a split second before turning sapphire blue and gleaming bronze. The amorphous cloud took shape, coalescing into a giant bronze and blue eagle. The great eagle flapped its wings and gave a screeching, "CAW!" before taking flight around the hall.
And then Severus had taken that burden from him. When Draco had been too spineless to cast the Killing Curse, Severus had done it for him. He'd shredded his soul so that Draco wouldn't have to.
It was Malfoy's turn to tense. His jaw clicked shut as they stopped and waited for a staircase to shift over to them.
"Thanks, Parker," said Malfoy, straightening his robes and dusting imaginary lint off his shoulder. He sounded as if he were merely thanking Harry for holding a door open or keeping the kettle warm.
If Dumbledore and Malfoy were right, getting back to the future was already within Harry's power. They wouldn't find what they were looking for in the library.
The Elder Wand was a heavy weight in his borrowed cloak. He wondered why it had appeared, unless…. Its power would die with Harry if he died undefeated. Was it dead, too? Had followed him into the afterlife?
They made their way to their usual table in the restricted section. Madam Pince didn't even ask to see their permission slip from Dumbledore every single time anymore.
Tears sprang to her eyes, and Harry grimaced. He patted her shoulder awkwardly and muttered, "It was nothing. Anyone would have done it."
, Harry thought, taking a step away from Regulus and pressing his hands experimentally against his ears to see if he could still hear over the ringing. His heart was hammering at the sudden adrenaline rush.
"Listen to me carefully," said Draco. "You do not get to personally decide who lives and who dies. Therefore, it is not your fault when somebody dies. If you want to play the blame game, look at it from my perspective. It was
Draco, nauseated, missed what Dolohov said, but he heard Harry clearly. Harry spoke in a way Draco had never heard before, in a tone stern and unyielding as the universe itself. Power seemed to radiate from him like he was the eye of a storm, wild, barely-leashed violence,
Then Sirius Black caught sight of them. He lifted his head, made a show of sniffing the air like a dog, and said, "What's that smell? It smells like someone pissed their pants. Oh— hi, Snivellus!"
James covered his face with his hands. He couldn't see Remus's expression that way, but he already knew the dangerous, animalistic glint that would be in his eyes.
"I know," she said. "Ron won't go back either. But I know I won't be alone. There will be Ginny, and Luna…."
Draco Malfoy had approached from the side and was kneeling down, a sneer on his face even though his gray eyes sparked with something like worry.
"The latest from Avery's interrogation suggests the remaining Death Eaters have banded around Dolohov instead of Yaxley, as we originally thought," Kingsley continued, beginning the slow, ponderous pacing around the desk anew. "He may bring protection. Bodyguards. He may not even go himself. He could delegate."
"I'll tell you what," said Dolohov in his raspy, amused voice. "My master was kind enough to offer you a deal in the end, wasn't he? And you were stupid enough to take it. I think I'll offer you the same. Surrender yourself, Harry Potter, and we'll let your little blood-traitor friend live. What do you say?"
He tried to feel the solid wood beneath his fingers, not the warm rush of Snape's blood. He tried to smell the Ministry office, musty and damp, not the ash and stone debris from the falling castle. He tried to see his own hand, pale against the dark desk in the dimly lit office, not the flashes of red and green spell-light he saw every time he closed his eyes.
Draco opened his mouth, turning back to the elder Black to tell him, when he saw that Harry had accompanied Lupin down the table to see what was going on. As they leaned in to listen to Black and Potter Senior explain it in excitable whispers, Lupin's face grew exasperated. He rolled his eyes to the enchanted ceiling multiple times as if to ask for patience from a higher power.
"Also, we are delighted to have a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher joining us: Professor Bowie!"
And Dumbledore's wand had been missing that day Harry had accidentally summoned the Elder Wand. It stood to reason the Cloak had come from James's trunk, not the future timeline.
He'd thought of his mixed success with pranks in the past— dressing up as dementors for that Quidditch game in third year, the Potter Stinks badges in fourth— but nothing along those lines seemed good enough as revenge against the Marauders.
Instead, Draco had put Harry in that impossible position where he couldn't "do the right thing" and stay on good terms with his family at the same time.
"Gosh, what effusive praise." Malfoy rolled his eyes and said, "As someone who prefers all his limbs intact, I never stood a chance against you, did I?"
"What was that about?" he had asked Severus, who had been sent from the group to chase him off. They had watched Severus escort him down the corridor to the boys' dorms, the light from the evening sun filtering through the lake to cast their cold, stony faces an eerie, alien blue-green. They hardly looked human.
She nodded again and cleared her throat, voice coming out even more gargled when she spoke again. "Your inspector will report back to the Council on the date of December 31st, 1999 regarding your success. Due to the nature of your fame, the prominent location of your business, and the necessary preclusion of a biased assessment, the inspector whom the Ministry deems most impartial will be assigned to your case."
He collapsed on the couch with Barkley and three blankets. He felt a sudden pang of remorse for leaving Hermione and Ron to take care of him on such short notice, especially considering their two kids. He'd go see them tomorrow and bring their gifts to smooth things over.
They planned to label the samples as well as they could but put numbers on the ones they couldn't identify and use a Pensieve later to clear up any errors.
"That all sounds very impressive. I'm not looking for an apprentice currently, or I'd snatch you right up. I'm happy to put in a good word for you, though. Have you taken your Potions N.E.W.T?"
He knew how hard it was for her to be away from them when all of this was going on, and she'd come back briefly for the funeral, but she had to be there with her parents.
Ron stopped pacing and met him with fiery eyes. "No, I haven't bloody talked to Malfoy. I've been talking to Hermione about the ethics of a memory charm on Patricia Gibson. I don't know and I don't care what you've been doing, but if it gets out that you've been testing DNA without approval, you'll never get a moment's peace again."
Malfoy arrived at 6 with takeaway and wearing tight blue jeans. He looked like himself again, Harry was glad to see.
Looking back at the panels lining the outside wall, he realised that they had once been windows. Even Chudley Cannons would have dismissed this as tasteless.
He when his father was murdered, he was engaged to a new girl via his instructions that he'd never met before, but who was Pure-Blooded and would produce him an heir. The wedding was called off.
Teddy nodded and shifted away from Harry to sit down. He wrapped his arms around himself and Harry sat down beside him.
James grabbed Sirius's uninjured shoulder and leaned forward until their foreheads were almost touching.
James glanced furtively at the head table. The professors were usually more tolerant of the fireworks display at the welcoming feast as long as it was relatively harmless and the skill behind it impressive enough. They
"'Another' can have multiple meanings," said Dumbledore thoughtfully. "It can mean, as Mr. Potter probably intended, 'another' as in, 'You will not kill
Harry looked up into the young, bespectacled face of James Potter, grinning ear to ear and waving like a lunatic.
"And the lightning Mallory shot at you in the duel," said James quietly. "I swear to Merlin's mother, I felt every cell in my body
"I wouldn't know where to begin, sir," said Draco, making an effort to keep his voice steady rather than whiny. He went on doggedly, "I've never studied the theory of time travel. Typically, with most spells, it would be most effective if we knew how we had arrived here in the first place in order to reverse it to return."
"Ow!" Harry scowled and moved his knees closer to Remus, hopefully out of Sirius's range. "How should I know what they're talking about? I don't have Extendable Ears."
It's because I haven't any legs! No legs, great golly! I mean— great Salazar! What happened to my Merlin-loving legs?"
Harry got to his feet in a daze. A Patronus. Yes. Yes, he needed to cast a Patronus. That would get the images out of his head. If he cast a Patronus, maybe he would be able to stop shaking.
Harry shoved the broomstick back at Malfoy, his mind shutting down even harder against the thought of staying. "No. I told you, I don't… I can't play anymore. I'm done with it."
Lily and James should have given him permission in his third year. Sirius, despite being on the run,
once, for their information, and had never spoken of the Killing Curse again. Nobody had even considered pressing for more information such as,
Harry caught a glimpse of frizzy brown hair through the shelf behind Malfoy, and he opened his mouth to ask Hermione to grab that Old English book of translations—
"I don't know…" said Remus. He chewed on his bottom lip, staring at the ground with an expression of distress. "If V-Voldemort attacked Ilvermorny… do we know if Ilvermorny…
Lily took the spot on Sirius's other side, across from Harry, while the rest of the girls clustered nearby.
He'd been pushed right next to Sirius. If he had given all his focus to the shield instead of maintaining his hair-color charm, Sirius would definitely have seen.
"Sure," said Lily. "Just checking on you. We could hear you cackling from across the hall. See you back in the tower."
Lily waved it off. She pulled out her own Potions textbook and a roll of parchment. "It's not your fault. I know it must be difficult moving to a new place without all your old friends and teachers and such. I'm just glad you're finally settling in, even if it does mean flying around with Potter and Black."
He'd gone through his own hell over the past year. He hadn't spared much time to wonder over Potter's.
"Last time," Harry mused, "it was King's Cross Station. I think it was symbolic— a junction between two places, a means of transportation to move on or go back. Why a random street in
Dumbledore chortled and feigned scratching the great cat under the chin. Remus had it purr even louder.
Harry watched with something like amusement as Bowie and Flitwick shot off spells at each other, each crying out the spell verbally and exaggerating the wand movement. Harry had seen Flitwick duel in earnest at the Battle of Hogwarts and knew it looked nothing like this performance, geared toward educating.
"I didn't mean it as an insult," said Malfoy, turning a sharp gaze around their vicinity to make sure nobody was paying attention to them instead of the duel. "I just meant… well, in pureblood families, we call it the Black family madness. No, hush, Potter, it's still not an insult, it's a fact. I'm sure your godfather was nothing like Auntie Bella. But they were related, and it occasionally shows. And I would apologize for the comparison, but he did just piss in
The proprietor, a short man with a bushy mustache, opened the door, allowing the shop light to illuminate the man on the step.
"These dates are coded," said Hermione. "But I think— yes, I'm certain— there's one this week in Knockturn Alley. Harry—"
"Really?" Lily's tone was pleasantly surprised. "You're Muggle-born, too? Somehow, I don't think you've ever mentioned that before."
On Saturday morning, Draco fell into step beside Harry and the Gryffindor girls as they lined up to head into Hogsmeade. Filch was, inevitably, checking permission forms from all the younger years.
Regulus cocked his head, studying Harry. On Sirius, it was always an amusingly dog-like movement. On Regulus, it was birdlike, a little more predatory, a little more alien.
Harry didn't respond. He closed his eyes, clenched his fists, and tried to get air back into his lungs.
Gertrude slowly, painstakingly unwrapped herself from her ball. She struggled to sit up, but Harry battled his inner hero and didn't help her. He knew she would be better off without him rushing at her, even if he knew his only intention was to help.
He thought again of the Congress's secrecy, and how Harry and Mallory had clearly lived through something traumatic, even if the news had never made it to British wizards.
"It seems your friend Mr. Potter was more severely injured than he let on," said Dumbledore after Vanishing the note. His gaze met Draco's gravely, and Draco found himself sitting up straighter. "Madam Pomfrey would like to keep him for a few days, as he will not consent to go to St. Mungo's. She is also concerned his mind may have been damaged, given his unusual comments. I assume he thinks he is speaking to
Why the hell had he volunteered to go with Malfoy when he knew he'd just spend the next couple of hours wrestling with memories of everyone around him dying? What part of that had sounded like a good time?
your cue?' with a great deal of scorn. Nevertheless, he shot off a spell to ignite the Gryffindor table fireworks.
"It would have been hilarious," said Malfoy primly, sticking his nose in the air, "except, for some unfathomable reason, you could produce a Patronus at
"No, Parker, that's exactly why I can't," said Snape. "That's why I'm trying to warn you. The political atmosphere outside these walls is extremely volatile. You can't have ties to both sides."
"That was cruel," Harry continued, just as lowly, "and he didn't deserve that. Severus Snape is a good man."
James knew Sirius had brought that up because nothing made him hate Snape more than the reminder of how badly he'd treated Lily, but…. it didn't feel right.
At some point, Snape must have tired of being laughed at, because he was gone, and it was just Harry and Malfoy on the floor, curled up in a painful amount of hysterical laughter.
Seventh year in the Slytherin dorms— his first time around— had been hell. The son of a disgraced Death Eater, he had been a prime target for the others to step on in order to move up the hierarchy. Crabbe especially had shoved Draco's face in the dirt to curry favor with the Carrows, who had been impressed with his brutality in performing curses in Dark Arts class.
"Don't be daft, Po— Parker!" said Malfoy, getting to his feet first, an angry red stain on his pale cheeks. "Madam Pomfrey said no practical magic for at least a week! I'll do it."
Draco wanted to argue that of course he did; his mother was a Black. But Draco Mallory had been in America for the past decade. He couldn't claim to know British society as well as he did.
Dumbledore fell silent for a moment, looking out at them. Candlelight flickered in his half-moon spectacles, obscuring his eyes. He continued more quietly, and the student body hardly breathed for fear of drowning his voice out, "I need not remind you what dark times we find ourselves in. The danger to our families, the danger to our society outside these walls has never been greater. I have always strived to make Hogwarts a safe haven for students. However, I need your cooperation and support in order to make it truth. Please, I cannot urge you strongly enough to do the right thing. Take care of one another. If you see anything strange or suspicious, report it to a member of the staff immediately. Obey the rules, even as pointless or restricting as you may find them. Only by actively choosing to be cautious, vigilant, and united will we get through this terrible time. Thank you.
"We've had some very good professors, sir," said Lily indignantly. "Just because they didn't stay long doesn't mean we didn't learn what they had to teach."
James helpfully bent down before reaching Sirius and picked up one of his shoes, which had been blasted off amongst the various explosion curses. He handed it back to a stunned Sirius and gave him a comforting pat on the shoulder.
He was going to have to stand up and start walking, he realized with dread. Naked. In front of Draco Malfoy.
"Oh, what now?" came Malfoy's voice. "Did you tell him a dirty joke? Those are supposed to be for me!"
And so Draco smiled politely, pretended he didn't notice the first few times they tried to get into his locked and warded possessions, and kept his focus split between Severus and finding a way back to his own time.
"I'll be taking N.E.W.T.s in Transfiguration, Potions, Charms, Arithmancy, Herbology, and Ancient Runes," Hermione whispered. "I think I'm rather done with Defense. What about you?"
"That is true," admitted Dumbledore politely. "Traveling as far as you have is unheard of in my experience. It is quite the conundrum."
Draco sneered automatically at the thought of Potter and turned another sharp about-face in his pacing.
Harry's heart clenched as it did every time he entered the Great Hall, which was why he had taken great pains to avoid it in the past week. There were the thousands of candles floating above the four long, glistening tables filled with smartly dressed, freshly scrubbed children. The dark sky glittered with stars above them through the enchanted ceiling.
since first year. Between them and Crabbe, Draco had learned to place wards on his bed curtains and check for tampering every night.
Snape didn't respond for a moment but gave Harry another intense, piercing stare, which Harry returned as best he could without directly meeting Snape's eyes. He'd mastered that trick in fifth year.
Harry was leaning hard against the desk beside him, trying to stay on his feet, trying to breathe. Why… why couldn't he get Dolohov's twisted face out of his head? Why were his ears still ringing with the Death Eaters' laughter?
"It is weird you're here," Harry conceded. "Dumbledore had already died when he met me at the crossroads. I figured it was his spirit or something, since he wasn't a ghost. But last I saw, you were alive and— well, not
Oh, that was… that was uncomfortable, Draco thought, eyebrows raising. Then again, there was a reason Severus got to be the Head of Slytherin House. Manipulating family politics to get him a willing third… that was good.
And— Harry couldn't breathe. There was Remus Lupin, sitting next to the mousy haired, pointy-nosed Wormtail, tucking his book beneath the table with a shy, apologetic smile and… and he was
While Remus had the fire-eagle swooping, twirling, and soaring like the apex flyer it was, Sirius shot off a spell under the table to ignite the fireworks surrounding Ravenclaw table.
They were waiting amongst the first years to be Sorted. The younger students eyed them with awe and wariness.
A lurching, groaning corpse appeared out of nowhere, arms outreached for Lily. It was surprisingly fast.
He glanced over his shoulder to where Rosier, Wilkes, Severus, and Regulus were waiting coolly, matching expressions of feigned disinterest on their faces even as they stood unusually close together, even as they spoke so that no one else could hear, not looking at one another, hardly even moving their lips.
. Surely the whole magical world would have heard about that, would have been in an absolute uproar. It would have made the front page of every paper worldwide.
How the girls could still be so enamored when Sirius was chewing open-mouthed with cheeks like he'd tried to swallow two whole planetary globes, James would never understand.
"It must have," he said automatically, bristling against the idea that the answer could be anything else. "I mean, a whole school, we'd have heard about it if…"
Draco repeated himself, louder, but it didn't do more than get a few taunts thrown in his direction instead. He considered pulling out his wand to jinx them, but the younger years were already moving on, talking animatedly amongst themselves, and really, how many would Draco have to jinx to keep it from spreading throughout the school in a matter of hours? He doubted he could get them all before Rosier Stunned him or worse.
Just like the Elder Wand had appeared in his hand in their first moments in the past, back in Diagon Alley when Gertrude had been attacked.
"Hm," said Remus. They walked a handful of steps in silence. "He might be missing home. Maybe you're the closest he can get. Maybe it took traveling a few thousand miles away, and bunking with Slytherins, for him to realize you're not that bad."
Dolohov had gone back on his word, and everything— that screaming, endless hollow in his chest— had exploded.
"Of course, Headmaster," said James, blushing. Sirius was trying to tap out, his face having been submerged in pumpkin juice for several seconds now, but James shoved it down even harder and attempted to rub his nose against the bottom of the bowl.
Finally, Dumbledore rose and held his arms out, as if to greet each and every student with a simultaneous embrace.
would know all about what's right," Harry snarled, turning his back on Malfoy. He made his way back to Gertrude.
before committing to their cover story. He'd never visited, though, and he had only met one American wizard in his life.
He was in the past, and once he helped Malfoy find a way back to their time, he could move on. He could move on to parents who remembered him, to his real godfather and friend. To Ron and Hermione, who at least were together beyond the veil.
"Black, Parker," said Malfoy easily, cutting in before Harry got started. "Were you congratulating Parker on the duel, as well, then?"
Malfoy continued staring at him. His mouth worked silently for a moment, starting, stopping, and starting again. Then he just shook his head and dragged his hand through his too-long hair.
"Might have shattered the windows back at the castle if I yelled on top of a Sonorus, mightn't it?" Regulus remarked. He sounded droll, and Harry couldn't tell if he was joking or not.
Once inside the infirmary, McKinnon safely under Madam Pomfrey's care, Dumbledore turned to the boys.
"Uh, yeah," said Harry. "We weren't really making much progress, anyway. Thought I'd go watch some Quidditch tryouts after all."
"Snape is mine," said Draco, not even glancing back at Severus to know he'd accept. Any chance to curse Potter Senior or Black, he knew he'd be on board.
Draco glared up at the staff table, where Dumbledore was in conversation with McGonagall. Why wasn't he giving the welcoming speech yet?
"The Aurors tend to give us what we want," he said, "and get out of our way. You should follow their lead."
Why couldn't Harry have it both ways? Why shouldn't he defend both Black brothers, even from one another? If they only knew…
"Stop that incessant fidgeting and have some decorum," Malfoy hissed from beside him, looking dignified in his unmarked robes and warm chestnut hair. They had spelled his hair, too, but he still had the unmistakable arrogance of a pureblood heir, Harry thought uncharitably.
He tried to put it from his mind, but he kept returning to that look on Potter's face. It had been horrid, nothing but panic and desperation and… and that was not the Potter Draco knew. That was not Dumbledore's reckless golden boy, the schoolboy who could do no wrong in the eyes of the professors. That was not his Quidditch rival, not the second coming of Godric Bloody Gryffindor who had an undeniable 'saving people thing' and who flew like a bloody bird.
It was late. Past dinner. But it was also a lovely summer night, and surely the shops in Diagon Alley were still open? He could go for a walk, and if he happened to meander into Knockturn Alley, well…
Snape scowled, but Harry couldn't tell if he was frustrated at being caught or frustrated that Harry couldn't piece it together for himself.
He revealed his own transfigured hands, which were shaped as duck heads, complete with feathers, bills, and distractingly loud quacking.
Then he slashed his wand in frustration and strode up to Malfoy, rage boiling over. He grabbed Malfoy's collar and jerked him roughly back to his feet.
Harry's wand hand was shaking. Something tumultuous crashed behind his green eyes. He seemed to be struggling, but Draco didn't know if he was trying to hold himself back from cursing Black or trying to hold himself
"It takes a while to get used to," said a female voice directly across from him, and Harry looked up into green eyes as vivid as his own. Lily Evans smiled kindly and—
It still irked James that his fellow Gryffindor had not only joined the Slytherin team, but he had also helped Mallory win that first duel. It wasn't even his duel to win!
Snape whirled to give Harry a look of shock, then Sirius roared, "SNAKE!" at the same time James's voice carried,
Forget waiting until they got to the dorm. James was going to drown him in a vat of pumpkin juice right here.
you?" Harry demanded, shoving him hard. He was aware of movement around them, professors and the other students getting over their shock and stirring into action, but he could barely see them through the dense, lingering mist. "I
James and Lily both pulled Remus, Sirius, and Peter to help them clean up the mess from their fireworks display, leaving Harry to find his own way to the seventh-year Gryffindor dorm.
"It wasn't the same," Harry cut across him, before he could say something incriminating. He shifted awkwardly and looked away from them all. His breathing had sped up, become shallow. "Fighting for your life… for your friends' lives… isn't the same as a duel."
"Mallory said the students were evacuated, remember?" Sirius cut into James's spiraling thoughts with the precision of a Legilimens. "C'mon, Prongs. It sounded like only a few of them snuck back to fight or whatever they did. The school definitely survived. Although I bet that Fiendfyre was tricky to put out."
The two seventh year Slytherin prefects, Evan Rosier and Johanna Wilkes, tried to point Draco to a seat across from them like a disobedient dog, but Draco smiled a polite, icy smile and sat between Severus and a teenager who
Malfoy blinked rapidly, his mouth working but no sound coming out. His pale eyes darted around the hall in incomprehension. "I— I don't— I didn't think— My
Malfoy pushed the broom back at him. "I'm not asking you to play Quidditch. I'm just saying you should get back in the air for a minute. It'll do you some good, you broody, morose arse."
Potter had loved this man like a grandfather, had confided in him, and together Potter and Dumbledore had defeated the Dark Lord— the Dark Lord who scared Draco so much he could hardly be in the same room with him without pissing himself.
Every time Draco or Severus had insulted his father in previous years, Harry had rallied to the man's defense like James Potter was some kind of hero. No matter how many detentions Snape had given or how many points he took, Potter had always stood up for his father's honor.
There were no other Gryffindors in Alchemy. Draco thought privately she had been very brave to come up to him as she had without any friends for support, especially with the way Rosier and Mulciber were looking at her.
Sirius glanced away, uncomfortable, and removed his hand from James's shoulder so he could cross his arms. "I dunno. I've never heard of anything like that before, but… he's messed up, right? The way he panics at the smallest things. That— that
"It was fashioned after Hogwarts," said Draco, shaking himself from dismal thoughts, "so it was rather similar, I imagine. Four houses, teachers and tests. It's a castle on a mountain rather than a lake, though."
"The Boy Who Lived," muttered Remus, probably to himself, but sound carried down in the tunnels. "Yes… an odd thing to call someone unless it's something of a title, a moniker. It must be referring to Mallory's remark that Harry survived the Killing Curse. He must have gotten quite a lot of attention for something like that."
"Then I forfeit," said James easily, wrapping an arm around Sirius's shoulder and urging him forward. "Congrats, you win. What a glorious occasion. You sure showed me. Et cetera, et cetera. May I be excused now?" He added to Bowie, who nodded. "C'mon, Pads, let's go. One foot in front of the other, there you go…."
was the executioner, boy, not me," said Dolohov, with an amused, vicious glint in his gray eyes. "Me? I'm the
"You think… it was the school itself he attacked?" asked James slowly, tasting the words to see how they felt in his mouth. It didn't sound…
"I have since seen the error of my ways," said Malfoy and, though curt, he sounded sincere. "Though, to be fair, we might have won that game with your friend's worthless efforts as a Keeper if you hadn't just snatched the Snitch right from under me. I was lashing out."
"If you don't want wands, send the change along with your second," continued Draco coldly. "And, as you know the castle better than I do, as a new transfer, I
"Your friend is a Kneazle turd, sir, and I accept your challenge!" said Bowie, swiping up Flitwick's hat and brandishing it like a disgraceful, failing term paper. "I name wands as our weapons of competition!"
James marched up to Lily and Harry, his bearing straight and proud. He jabbed a finger at Harry and said, "I have decided to spare your life on three conditions! First, you give up your despicable, underhanded, woman-stealing ways—"
"Why, you—!" the Lestrange brothers began red with fury, but Dolohov abruptly jerked back to himself and grabbed the backs of their cloaks.
The Gryffindor team whooped and descended in a flurry of scarlet and gold and breathless laughter. Harry caught the smell of the wind on their robes, fresher than rain and even more exhilarating. They tromped past the Slytherins without even glancing at them, heading back toward the locker rooms.
"Sorry, Professor," said James, a shifting movement out of the corner of Harry's eye. "I forgot— apparently Madam Pomfrey excused him from practicals for the week."
"The last thing we both saw was green light," said Draco, sinking back into his chair as he honestly considered it. "Potter was about to be killed, but I jumped in front of the curse. It
He continued muttering uncomplimentary things under his breath as they changed directions toward the library, but Harry ignored him.
He hated talking about the future. He hated the idea of splitting up the three of them. They had been through so much together. They had counted on one another to stay alive, to stay sane, to
"Uh, I don't… care?" said Harry. He almost winced, preparing to have House points taken, when he remembered Snape
"They barely know Snape," Sirius repeated. "Do you think they'd feel the same if they knew he was a Death Eater? After whatever they've been through?"
Harry looked at him with interest and something else. Something more profound, though Remus shied away from identifying it.
After class, one of the Gryffindor girls— not one of the McKinnons or the redhead with Harry's eyes, Draco couldn't remember her name— came up to him before he could finish packing his bag.
It could be a strong team, James concluded, rubbing his chin as the impromptu practice came to a close. With over half the team being new, it would come down to how well they worked together. Separately, they each had considerable talent, but James wouldn't worry a bit if it turned out they meshed like a sack full of feral cats.
Though Harry looked at them all with a strange intensity, it was different with Peter. Everything about Harry's aura, powerful and bright while directed at James, Sirius, and Remus, became closed off and cold when he looked at Peter.
"The ultimatiest," Sirius confirmed. His bagel, last supporting a tower of bacon and eggs when Harry looked, was now stacked with strawberries, cantaloupe, porridge, potatoes, and cornflakes.
"Are you having another fit?" came Snape's voice. It wasn't as deep as it would get in later years, but it had that same surprisingly soft, silky quality Harry would always associate with dimly lit potions classes in the dungeons.
"The DMLE is setting up wards around each of the Muggle houses on the list, and they'll have around-the-clock guards for as long as the department can afford it," James reported at breakfast a few days after the Quidditch tryouts. He was summarizing sections of the letter to an attentive audience. "Dad says they interviewed the Jarlsbergers' house elf, and she was convinced something had been wrong with Midge just before they fired her, so it gives credence to the idea Midge was under the Imperius. They're still searching for who could have cast it, though. Not much to go on there."
"They tried training us as recruits," Ron offered with a deceptively careless shrug, "but it turns out Hermione taught us all that rot in our first month of On the Run Bootcamp."
They left their books for Madam Pince to return to the shelves and went their separate ways in the corridor outside.
As soon as he stepped into the shop, he came face-to-face with a startled Rookwood and promptly blasted him through a wall with a
Harry found his teeth chattering, a familiar, all-encompassing dread filling his chest as a hooded, cloaked figure rose in the front of the room.
Lily's had been made of willow and good for charms, Ollivander had said. James's had been mahogany and a powerful tool for transfiguration.
He couldn't recall mention of Voldemort taking the war to America, to Ilvermorny, but that wasn't surprising. The Dark Lord preferred to operate in the shadows, cultivating an atmosphere of uncertainty and fear. If nobody knew where he was at any given moment, people everywhere would be afraid of him, all the time. Nobody would dare move against him openly for fear of repercussions.
Snape's pale, thin face clouded. He said hissed, "If you want to pick a fight with your idiot housemates, don't use me as an excuse. I don't need your help, and I certainly don't need your
His eyes had changed. They were no longer sharp and derisive. There was nothing gleefully mocking in his face anymore. There were bags under his eyes and faint lines of worry and grief.
it. I don't think dueling is fun for them. I think it's serious. And if that Mallory bloke was willing to challenge you to one over Snape… well…." Here was the uncomfortable conclusion James had finally drawn, and he glanced at Sirius in worry. He finished, gently but immovably, "I think you might have gone too far this time. If Mallory and Harry were both willing to fight to what, in their heads, would be to the death, and they hardly know Snape…. Well, Pads… that should probably tell you something."
"That's absurd," said Remus sharply, standing up straighter. "Harry's not that kind of person, Sirius. He would never support Voldemort. His
He wasn't upset— at least, not about going to the dorm alone. It gave him ample opportunity to set up the wards he, Ron, and Hermione had perfected over their year on the run. He had found weeks ago that, despite Voldemort's defeat, he could no longer sleep without them.
, because even that was less painful than looking at Sirius right now. "I don't need to agree to your conditions! Whatever you're sparing my life for? Fucking
Harry blinked furiously and looked at the ceiling, trying to hold back the well of emotions that raged in his suddenly empty, cavernous chest.
That only made Harry laugh harder, and it sounded like it had the same effect on Malfoy next to him. His ribs and abdomen were aching with the effort of continuing to laugh. It
"Ugh, that rogue Bludger to the arm. And then that imbecile removed your bones. Most disgusting thing I've seen in my life."
want to know is why Voldemort would try to kill him. It was Mallory's friend that cast Fiendfyre, so they're obviously not afraid to use Dark magic. And…." He trailed off.
Malfoy's eyes flicked to Harry's body as if against his will. He cleared his throat abruptly and looked away, swallowing hard. His face, already pale, had a greenish tint. He clasped his hands as if to keep from fidgeting.
Remus was all the seventh year Gryffindor boys could handle. Anymore bookishness now, and they might as well cancel the graduating class altogether.
Once everyone had had their fair share, the badger dropped down, shifted, and became a snake in the grass.
"You survived a war, Malfoy," he hissed, low enough that Snape couldn't hear, especially as enraptured as he was by the spectacle of professors hurling jinxes and hexes at each other. "Are you seriously concerned about a
—" he heard Hermione say, startled, behind him. She swished her wand to signal Ron and the Aurors, and then her pounding footsteps joined his on the dark street.
"So," murmured Malfoy, as they stood at the back of the line and the first years were Sorted. "Do you mind telling me what you know that I don't know?"
He didn't quite understand, still, but he understood one thing: Potter had thrown them back in time with no time-turner, no incantation, not even a
"Madam Pomfrey does, however, believe both Mr. Potter and Miss McKinnon will make full recoveries," Dumbledore finished quietly, watching him.
Sirius treated him to the same furrowed-brow sidelong look. "'Course you did. You cast Protego Horribilis. I didn't even know that one existed."
He could spend the rest of his life hunting Death Eaters and Dark wizards, and it still wouldn't be enough.
A wild-haired man with an eyepatch and one arm raised his three-fingered hand in the air to accept his applause, which was rather loud and jubilant for a simple professor's return from a vacation.
Harry tried for his own competitive grin, but it felt false. "Hard to say, isn't it? You never once beat me as a Seeker."
would do well to remember this, too." He stared straight at the Gryffindor table, and for a moment, Draco automatically assumed he was talking to the Weasley twins again before he remembered where he was.
"Potter," repeated Dumbledore thoughtfully. His chin came down to rest upon his laced fingers. "Why would Mr. Potter think you're dead rather than, from your perspective, in the past?"
, wrapped herself around. She regarded the Slytherins with venom in her gaze and upon her forked, candlelight-flickering tongue.
Hope and giddiness bubbled within him, and Harry found himself smiling back helplessly. "Yeah, I think I—"
He registered Dolohov's wand in his face, intent obvious in the dark, lunatic look in his eyes, and something in Harry broke. It was like a dam giving out all at once, the power rushing forward in a tidal wave of soul-crushing, all-consuming darkness.
It had been great, he thought weakly and with a shade of bitterness, for that one moment he had watched James fly.
for him. Fred, Colin Creevey, all the others— children, teachers, Order members, civilians— they'd all died for him.
They were huddled at the foot of the stands under the Invisibility Cloak, spying on the Slytherin tryouts.
. He had been giving Draco the cold shoulder ever since Harry and Draco had almost died laughing over his offer to join the Dark Lord.
Remus sat down and tried very hard not to look guilty when Madam Pince stalked by. There was no way she knew it was him under the Invisibility Cloak checking books in the Restricted Section for their map, right?
"Sad, what the world is coming to," said Gertrude quietly. She rubbed her ribcage absently, a habit she had picked up since her attack.
They weren't supposed to change the past, but this one little thing Draco could do. It was a stupid little tiff between Slytherins and Gryffindors, nothing new. Surely, confronting Potter Senior and Black wouldn't alter history.
"Keep your hair on!" James called back at a much more reasonable volume. "Lost track of time. C'mon, you lot! Time to celebrate! That Cup is ours for sure this year!"
Even though Harry had been the one reminding Malfoy it was a safe, supervised duel, it was difficult to watch. After the first few exchanges, he had to turn away, close his eyes, and focus on breathing.
"Tabbard's Pawn," said Malfoy as they hobbled toward him, a pair of cripples too proud to lean on anyone but each other. Harry could practically see the snarky comment about Gryffindors swimming behind his eyes, but at least he kept it to himself. "They'll be easier to bribe into silence than the lawyers."
"Ignore them," Draco muttered to Severus, settling in to fill his plate. "We'll either have the satisfaction of hexing Black's face off or his groveling apology by this time tomorrow."
"You won, Potter," said Malfoy eventually, as they neared the library doors. "Why do you walk around like you were the one defeated?"
Harry rewound what he'd said in his mind and had to stop himself from rolling his eyes. Regulus was going to stand on propriety when Harry had been in his bedroom, had lived out of his house at times and inherited his house elf. He was going to stand on propriety when Harry knew how he
He had been grilled, all under the veneer of politeness, on his blood status and family ties his very first night. It had been a tricky dance for Draco to navigate. He needed enough connections to make staying in the Slytherin dorms livable, but he had to be especially careful not to drop names of wizards who could be easily reached and questioned.
His parents had already graduated from Hogwarts and married, he calculated. They were likely still setting themselves up in their proper societal circles and careers before committing to an heir. His father was an only child, and his mother's sisters would have already graduated and moved on to their separate sides of the war.
Dumbledore twirled the ends of his long beard for many long moments, peering placidly into the distance.
"It still feels weird to me, too, sometimes," Harry admitted. "I grew up with my aunt and uncle, who were Muggles."
"And now you've insulted me, he jumps to my defense," finished Regulus. He glanced sidelong at Harry and said to Sirius, "I wonder what he would do if I insulted you to your face? Which of us would he jump to the aid of?"
Quick, lasssssiesssss, give me your clothessssssss…. I can't let Sssaalazaaaar see my laaaaadyyy-ssssnake partsssss…"
It would take some getting used to. Since deciding they would join the student body in order to stay at Hogwarts and continue their research, they had defaulted to calling each other "Scar-head" and "Ferret-face" to avoid the awkward alias thing altogether.
It was one of their first jaunts on the full moon after the long summer break, and Padfoot had been too wild, too excited. Remus had been feeding off that energy in his werewolf state, getting more and more ferocious, until their play-fights had turned downright vicious. James's threat of antlers hadn't driven them apart as it normally did, and, once Moony had gotten hold of Padfoot's throat and wouldn't let go, James had been forced to kick.
's in fourth year. Dirt. Dirt and grass and mud and something that smelled tremendously like fertilizer. As the badger kicked dirt merrily over all the Hufflepuffs, Sirius grinned behind his hand, took aim at the badger's targets, and shot off jets of dirt at them.
world needs him," continued Draco, "but… I think we broke him. And… and I think… I think we need your help to fix him."
It passed, though, when Black grinned a cold little grin and told Severus, "You heard the Lily-flower. Move on, before even the
Even if Draco stripped Potter Senior and Black of their robes, he recognized he was more likely to get a detention than vindictive-sweet revenge.
"Of course not, dear boy!" said Flitwick, looking revitalized and equally in his element. "It's all in good fun!"
"Hm," said Harry. "That's weird. First year, maybe? I ended up in the hospital wing, but I don't think it was Quidditch related…."
Snape lifted his chin in defiant pride, as if he expected Harry to scoff at the idea that Voldemort could be interested in him.
Nott hadn't had Crabbe's raw ferocity with curses, but he was far cleverer; and Zabini, while not Death Eater material, had been nothing but a through-and-through opportunistic
A bit of a show-off— and Wormtail needed a bit more time to get back from the Hufflepuff table on foot— he had the candle lights change color in a fluid, unending wave, like a rainbow rippling across the surface of a lake.
James wasn't planning a diabolical, elaborate prank on Harry to get revenge. Unless, of course, his plan to get Harry drunk at the Three Broomsticks on their first Hogsmeade weekend counted. It wasn't so much a prank as a curiosity.
"Oh," said Harry. He looked at Malfoy, who was blushing a bright pink and pretending he wasn't. "Um, it was no problem, Lily. It was just what we've talked about before— about them being so immature. I don't have that problem with Remus, right?"
He didn't even have to open a door to see into the back room, because there was already a hole in the wall the size of his mother's dress robes closet.
"My mother was a Black, as I believe I mentioned," continued Malfoy slowly, apparently choosing his words with care. "She taught me how to duel. She was afraid for me when the Dark Lord returned. She taught me how to
Malfoy fumed. "You've been holding something back. I didn't know for certain until yesterday evening, but then you lied to Dumbledore. I know you didn't just
"I need… I need a healer," said Gertrude, when Harry knelt next to her again. Her breathing was labored. "Lestrange— Rodolphus— used some kind of curse…."
though Harry didn't remember casting it. The clatter echoed in the silence that had dropped over the class.
Remus looked up from his essay and frowned. "No," he said slowly. "I think he's… confused. We all are, honestly. It's rather unheard of for a Gryffindor to side with a Slytherin on something like this. You might have noticed our Houses have a bit of a rivalry."
"Harry clearly has issues Mallory knows about," he said in his most confident, placating leader voice. "And Ilvermorny doesn't have a Slytherin house. Whatever Mallory is, I don't think he'll be as easy to bunch in with that lot. Even if they're not friends, maybe Mallory is just a decent sort helping a classmate."
" came Flitwick's voice, and a gust of hard wind whipped the Great Hall, buffeting the steam towards the front doors to dissipate.
The Elder Wand slapped into his outstretched palm as if it had been thrown by a giant invisible pitcher. Harry flicked it at Dolohov and disarmed him before that terrible curse could fully form. He snatched Dolohov's wand out of the air in his other hand and stood in the mouth of the alleyway, radiating cold, shrieking fury.
The wind whipped his hair and face, made his robes stream as if in a tornado around him. The air grew colder, fresher, and rushed in his ears like a living thing all around him.
Malfoy gripped his shoulder, and Harry held onto the sensation like another lifeline, another thing to keep him grounded in reality.
"Shut up, Sirius," said Harry in a cutting tone, not missing a beat, though he grabbed onto the table as if to steady himself. "I just… I can't even look at you right now."
Sirius reeked of smoke and sweat. His robes were singed, and a few holes had burned through to the skin leaving blisters and trickling blood in their place. A bruise was already beginning to form along his right cheekbone and jaw where he'd knocked his head against either the stage or the ground, James couldn't remember. There were doubtless other bruises on his ass and the back of his head where he'd been tossed back like a ragdoll from the explosions.
, which is a term that refers to whether or not their seconds will be in contact with one another. In many cases, the duelists have a dispute which can be solved by the extraordinary means of
"I'm perfectly well, thank you!" Draco said, the wild look not leaving his eyes. He cast about frantically, mouth working silently as he apparently tried to find an argument against Harry's logic.
"So, what animal are you going for?" asked James. He lounged beside Harry, amiable and relaxed, his feet kicked out in front of him, sideways in the desk with an arm draped over the backrest.
Tears pricked his eyes, and he looked down at his lap. He managed a short, jerking nod of acknowledgement. He wanted to say
apology to Snape as satisfaction. Be sure to have your second send it along as soon as you get cold feet."
some information from the seventh-year curriculum I've found worthwhile. If you study the text on your own time, you just might do well enough for your father to hand you a job on a silver platter, like you've always expected. Anyone else?"
Harry didn't feel like smiling. He didn't know if he'd ever be able to play Quidditch again without thinking about the Resurrection Stone inside the Snitch, of walking to his own death.
It took a moment for the implications to hit him, then he and Malfoy looked up at each other, identical looks of horror on their faces.
The smell of the feast wafting through from the kitchens added a layer of nausea to Harry's roiling gut. He forced himself to keep his eyes forward on the procession of first years. In his pocket, his fingers clenched around his holly wand, which he had reclaimed from Ollivander's on the previous day, grounding him.
He took a few steps back, put his hands in plain view hanging harmlessly, wandless, and said, "It's okay. They're gone now. You're safe. My name's Harry. What's yours?"
"He was just congratulating me on the duel," said Malfoy, feigning indifference, but Harry could see the slight flush in his cheeks and the way his chin tilted up. "And asking me if I'd like to try out for the House Quidditch team. He's the new captain."
They next day they were seated in the first row for a Quodpot match that Professor Burnes had helped them score entry to. Teddy seemed to particularly enjoy every time the Quod exploded, though Malfoy was more interested in what the solution that stopped that from happening contained.
"Well, I'll pay it," Harry said. He didn't mind. How could he? He'd helped start the shop, after all, so there was no reason he couldn't keep it going.
Harry knew this. He also knew his job was in jeopardy. He'd been one second away from owling McGonagall about her offer to teach when Ron stormed in.
Quite a few, actually, but Harry hadn't taken the time to look through any yet since he figured finding people who answered correctly was more important.
When Harry was getting ready to leave, Hermione asked if he was planning on seeing Malfoy again. He was pleased to tell her that he was, even though he left out the fact that it was for testing DNA, not a social gathering.
"Shove off," Harry said again and Teddy shrugged and pushed Harry away so he could get up and turn off the lights.
He stepped forward to stand beside Harry, and the pair of muggle trainers he'd donned caught Harry's eye, nearly making him laugh before he caught himself.
Luna shrugged and turned her attention back to Neville's hair, spelling a bit of it to stick up so she could attach an origami butterfly she'd made.
Harry went in to grab the bottle and saw the time on his grandfather clock. 3:28 am. Holy fuck. When had they gotten back, no later than 9? Had they really been talking for over six hours?
"Well, if my initial impression is correct, then that means anything you might want in here is gone now. Completely solid..." Malfoy frowned, looking at the room... "orange."
"Teenagers," Harry said and Malfoy agreed. They weren't much better themselves when they were his age.
When no response came besides a grunt, he set it down and reached into his pocket. "And some hangover potion."
She meant Harry. Malfoy nodded and Daphne opened the door. Most of his view was blocked by the people in front of him, but he could see a king-sized bed and a tiny woman laying down in the middle of it. She was so pale she nearly blended in with the sheets.
The creak of her voice carried across the room effortlessly, though he hadn't seen her use a sonorus. "This is a hearing to determine if Harry J. Potter—financier of Weasley's Wizard Wheezes and henceforth referred to as the debtor—will be allowed an attempt at salvaging the reputation of said business after and as soon as the appropriate sum of 150 Galleons has been paid to the order of Gringotts Wizarding Bank. Mr Potter, your statement, if you will."
"Oh. Stuff for Wheezes." He waved a hand vaguely, willing himself to focus on the present. It didn't work. He replayed the moment over in his head. "A plan for the reopening and a couple of potential products we've thought about introducing."
"Well that's—" Malfoy hesitated, flicking on the windscreen wipers to clear away the bugs crowding his vision, "that's bullshite."
Malfoy appeared from the other side of the bar, dressed in a skin-tight white shirt that was translucent and white skinny jeans. He practically glowed under the black lights. The men ordered three beers and then Malfoy saw him.
The Greengrass sisters lived a few kilometers out of London, within apparating distance, and Harry and Malfoy arrived at promptly 3 for the DNA collection. Harry realised he probably should brief him on the plan before they entered.
He should have asked earlier. Malfoy had this sick fantasy of wanting to get back at the killer somehow. They deserved to be locked up, Harry was almost positive, but if it was Ron, could Harry let that happen?
Harry thought about it for a few moments. Hadn't Malfoy always been the one who accepted him for who he was? Hadn't he always been the kind of person who thought the fame was a lie and Harry was just Potter after first year?
"Abstergeo," he pronounced cautiously, enunciating the ster very carefully, the way Hermione had shown him, and swirling his wand in a tight circle.
He tapped his wand against the window in frustration and looked around. There was a plunger sitting just to the right of the sink.
He out the paperweight into the machine and waited. This one seemed to take longer than usual. He could feel his palms sweating. The screen flashed the magical composition and he compared it to the one of the killer.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow and put one up as well and they made their way through the heart of muggle London without speaking.
It seemed like the end of the conversation and Harry knew he should say something back. When he thought it over later that night, he realised he could have just said, "Goodbye" or "See you then" but he wasn't hours past the event and regretting every second as it was happening so, with the considerable pressure so respond he said, "I like you too."
Malfoy's face was as shuttered as it had been back at Hogwarts and Harry startled at how easily he'd gotten used to it looking open and confident.
Ron frowned at this. "Harry, I thought you dancing with Malfoy at the Ball was your way of coming out. We all did."
"Why not? In fact, you could meet Professor Burnes right now if you want to. He's the head of our fellows program at Ilvermorny."
Harry took the swab out of his pocket and ran it around the rim of the glass. Hopefully, that would be sufficient.
They sat in silence until Harry walked back to his room later and passed out for a few hours. When Teddy woke him up at 4 to ask if he wanted to go exploring with him and Malfoy, Harry agreed. He'd promised Hermione he'd get her a present, after all.
"Those were just names, silly. And besides, there are very few witches who want their left nipple to be on fire. At least, none of them have admitted to it."
At first, Harry wasn't sure who'd said it. He didn't know if it was him or Malfoy or both of them at once. Maybe just a thought, a warning in his head.
"I saw him. He chatted up every woman who so much as said hello. Stole like three of my dance partners, though, so not a bad bloke in my books."
Harry spent the next day reading it over and wondering when he'd started letting Malfoy control his life. He did what any rational person would do when faced with a problem he wasn't sure how to even define, he called Hermione.
It still gave him chills, being here. The Hall of Prophecy was just a few turns away, but he forced himself not to think about it.
"Yeah, okay that's fine. Look, what happened? If you didn't fuck Malfoy then why are you freaking out? Is it because you wanted to?"
"Oh, there's a good boy." He collapsed on Harry's legs and closed his eyes. Harry reached for his cell before accioing it when it was too far. He called Ron. Hermione answered instead and she sounded groggy.
Seamus nodded mock seriously while Ginny began slapping Ron on the back, turning his cough-muffled laugh into some actual choking. "She's a genius, isn't she, and I don't think we tell her enough."
He flipped the machine back on. Without Malfoy in the room, he could test the samples and figure out if Ron had really done it. The door opened again and he turned around, expecting to see Malfoy, hoping he'd realised he'd overreacted too. It was Robards.
Harry tried not to stare, but he just couldn't help it. He wondered if he should say something or if that would be worse than just letting her keep it there. She didn't take well to teasing so he couldn't go about it in a funny way. What if she was offended? Every time she smiled at him, instead of feeling warm and fuzzy, he just focused on the green stuck in her teeth. What if she tried to kiss him? Would it still be there? When they were outside and had finished their meal, she said something that shocked him.
"Not if you don't want me to. They won't either." Ron and Hermione nodded their agreement after a lot of pointed eyeing from Harry.
"Right. You mean that because we have things in common you somehow understand a fundamental part of my psyche or some rubbish and that means that I should try calling Goyle even though I haven't spoken directly to him in years and I hate the telephone."
He was waiting outside the bar the next day when Malfoy got off work. Harry had checked the times online.
If Harry had thought about the moment Andromeda would die, it wouldn't have been Malfoy there, and it wouldn't have been him either. It wouldn't have been Teddy having to take solace in the arms of a cousin he knew before as only distant and slightly cold even though he was trying. It would have been with her daughter and son-in-law at her side, her sisters, her husband, and her grandson all crowded around as her breaths grew more labored and tears spilled down their faces, but Andromeda had already lost so much. And for that reason, only her grandson, her nephew, and her grandson's godfather were by her side when she left the world, and they all looked at her in stony-faced silence.
The person he sat down in front of next was a witch with a crooked nose and a shirt that read 'Muggle-born and proud.' She looked to be at least five years younger than him and she smelled like a chimney.
"I think there's plenty we have in common. Not just surviving the war, Malfoy. I'm talking about other stuff."
Jerome looked to Malfoy anxiously and then back to Harry but didn't answer. Luckily for him, Malfoy did.
"Now... I guess you're right. Not impossible." Not impossible if he ignored the fact that he wasn't ever going to see Malfoy again.
He realised as he was lying in bed that though he could have done without the weird admission that he didn't dislike Malfoy anymore, he wasn't upset they were continuing with the Murder Misson, as he'd been secretly calling it. Malfoy's Murder Mission, actually. The Ministry was big on alliteration and it was a force of habit at this point. The amount of work he'd end up putting in was irrelevant. He wanted to do this. He wanted to help Malfoy.
Harry scowled for a moment, content to walk in silence until he remembered something the woman in the suit had said. "What makes you the most impartial?" he asked.
"What? Put an ad out in the Prophet: Dear reader, did you kill my dad? I'm sure that would work splendidly."
They sat in silence for the rest of their lunch, Verity eventually leaving to go work the register again.
Harry didn't read the papers the next morning, but Hermione told him that the quotes had been printed exactly as they'd sent them with minimal commentary. That meant they'd look something like this.
She smiled and handed him a drink that he thought was some type of punch before taking a sip and tasting the firewhiskey. He took another sip for good measure.
It would have shocked younger him to hear those words coming out of Ron's mouth, but now he'd already accepted it. He fancied Malfoy. He really did. He'd gone and cocked up the whole thing, but he fancied him.
"Just dance with me, Potter. You've embarrassed yourself enough for one night without getting drunk off cheap wine."
He went to Robards the next day and told him about Ron's idea. It was apparently the most unethical sentence Harry had ever uttered because Robards told him he needed to go on an unpaid sabbatical and that if by the end of the month he was himself again, he'd consider giving him his job back.
"Right after the war. No primarily wizarding place would hire me, said it was bad for business. That one is run by wizards but has a lot of muggle clientele."
Harry nodded unthinkingly and let himself be lead back. He'd have to owl Hermione to apologise for missing dinner later, but he'd see her tomorrow at the Burrow.
"Stop, you'll make me blush," he deadpanned, taking another sip of his drink. Harry studied the way his throat bobbed, shaking himself out of his reverie when Malfoy raised a brow at him. Merlin, he was drunk.
He had a point. Harry loved finally feeling like he was at home. He loved teaching kids like the now fifth-year girl he'd learned was called Sam and the boy Brian who'd cast the dragonfly. He loved watching new kids learn and grow and teach each other. His life was finally where he wanted it to be.
He flicked on the light in the bathroom and pissed, then looked in the mirror. His face was drawn, his eyes were red and puffy, and his hair was somehow messier than usual. There wasn't anything to be done for it, of course. He washed his hands and left.
Neville grabbed Ginny just seconds before she would have gotten her hands around Kreacher's neck, restraining her with minimal struggle.
Harry rolled his eyes. Malfoy wasn't wrong. "Still. You could have convinced anyone it's what you're interested in."
Ron struggled against Harry as he hit the floor, blanket still wrapped around him like a plaid cocoon.
"I will never feel safe. Not in my own home, not anywhere. I'm afraid that learning who killed Draco's father would only bring him more pain."
He was out the door before Harry had even made it down the steps, but Harry chased him out of the shop and down the street, pushing past witches and wizards in his way.
"Yeah, I guess since he's never thought of me romantically, he's never held me to the same standards some people do."
"I can't believe how easy this was. It's so quick. I've been wondering for years if it was him, wanting to know somehow why he did it, how he did it. Still, looking back at how he was around me as a kid, I can't believe he killed my father."
Harry shrugged and winked at Rosie who was sneaking chocolate from a bowl in the living room. Hugo would be fine, he was barely on solid foods anyway.
Malfoy wiped his eyes and smiled. "You've gotten good at taking attention away from yourself. Like tonight."
"They're hardly my people. Look, Luna's right there and she's certainly one of yours. And you dated Dean."
"Harry I think if you're having fun, there's no harm in it just, don't let it take over the rest of your life, okay mate?"
A creature tha feels threat'ned, Hagrid would have reminded him, doesn' respond well ter sudden movemen'.
"Well some people have alibis, you see." He sat on the edge of Harry's desk and picked at an invisible thread on his trousers. "And I already suspect someone over anyone else."
"Just a mild Itching Jinx and the Stickfast Hex. Not to worry, Zabini's gotten particularly good at getting unstuck over the years."
Harry leaned forward just a breath and froze, waiting. But when their eyes met, the stillness was broken, and Malfoy yanked away from his hand, tearing their gaze.
"There has to be some sort of questionnaire people fill out or something to determine who needs the most help, how much good each place is doing, what the facilities are like, and to weed out people who just want the money, that sort of thing," she continued.
"A questionnaire! I can't believe we didn't think of it before. A scientific way to filter out the Potter fangirls, the crazies, the crup haters-"
"I delivered, didn't I? Despite the fact that it's eight o'clock in the goddamn morning, are you or are you not eating a sausage right now. Is it or is it not on a stick?"
She winced and Harry thought it was a reaction to his words before she blew on her tea and settled her expression into something more business-like. "Right then. I suppose I should ask why you want to do this now."
He tested Patricia Gibson's tissue next. It came back negative. So that was it then, wasn't it? He'd already decided that it was wrong to test the candy wrapper and yet...
"Be here tomorrow at 9 am, sharp. Don't be late. I haven't ever tolerated lateness from my other clients, and I won't tolerate it from you."
Malfoy half-laughed. "Yeah, I've got one for work, but I get all kinds of nervous trying to use the bloody thing."
"the time I went to Cancún and almost got fined for underage magic. Who knew their laws were different there?"
Harry was overwhelmed by the feeling then that he'd had back at Hogwarts and as he was teaching those kids to cast their Patronus. This was life, this was living.
20 minutes later, they were out in the hall, each of the ones old enough to have wands attempting to cast and the younger ones looking on in awe and occasionally managing to get a turn.
Malfoy's face twisted and he looked away from Harry's face.  "I..." he hesitated. "I'm not so sure, anymore."
"I'm fine. Yes. Yes. Yes. All right. Okay. Fine. Goodbye. All right. Yes, goodbye." Harry snorted and Malfoy flipped him the two fingers. "Fine. Yes. I love you too."
They got to the home of the suspected killer that Saturday afternoon, three days after they went over the evidence. Malfoy had owled the man, a Mr. Joseph Rosier, before they arrived as they were apparently old family friends. Harry didn’t bring up Moody seeing as Malfoy wasn’t his biggest fan.
Harry hummed. "Not quite. Your first cousin, three times removed married Charlus Potter, my great great grandfather."
They met at the lab. There were three samples to test: the swab from Finnley Shaw's fork, the tissue from Patricia Gibson's bathroom, and Ron's paperweight. Harry still hadn't told Malfoy about the candy wrapper from Mrs. Longbottom and was terrified to get a result on Ron's sample.
Later that night as it approached dinner time and after they'd stopped to watch countless street shows, Malfoy dragged them into a pizza parlour that claimed to be "New York's Finest." Harry'd have to take back the thing he said about the restaurant he and Malfoy tried on their first night hanging out, but he didn't mind.
His mind immediately went to the questionnaires and he almost fell out of his seat. There was obviously another explanation. Or maybe Ron was joking. That had to be it. He had never grown out of playing practical jokes on Harry and had even taken to partnering up with George when he ran out of original ideas. Clearly, this idea had fallen right into his lap. It didn't make complete sense, though. There was no way Malfoy had completed the questionnaire, he was obviously straight. Even if he wasn't unattractive for a bloke by any means, neither of them would be interested.
They looked at each other, and Harry swore he could feel the weight of that statement simmer in the air.
"We've come to keep you company," Luna said, bouncing over and greeting her with a kiss on the forehead.
"We're going to New York," he said, shoveling eggs onto three plates already containing bacon and toast, no bacon for Malfoy.
The next morning, Harry let himself pretend he hadn't just made one of the dumbest decisions of his life for exactly three minutes.
When they got up to the rooms, Teddy went inside and slammed the door, leaving him outside with Malfoy.
Harry put out a hand, watching it land on Malfoy's like he wasn't the one controlling it, stilling the anxious movement of his fingers on the mug. Malfoy's head jerked up, eyes meeting Harry's like a cornered animal. How had Hagrid taught them to deal with this again? It was slipping his mind at the moment. Harry tried to steady himself, but all he could do was freeze, hoping he wouldn't scare Malfoy away, wondering how he'd never noticed the soft curve of his ear before, the small scars carved along his neck. Lean in, said a voice in his head. See what they might feel light against your lips.
Harry shook his head. "None of them are who I'm looking for. They're all missing something. I don't think you'll find anyone in here."
"You came a long way for my DNA, and I'm guessing you've gotten it somehow already." They had. Malfoy had swabbed a fork when no one was looking. "I'd be careful with how you proceed if I were you. You might wish you didn't know the answer once you get it."
Eventually, he got into a groove, shooting a spell at the floor or the wall every 10 seconds as he hummed along to the same The Weird Sisters song he'd heard Ginny blasting from her room the other day while she pretended not to be crying. Verity always had something going.
Harry woke up the next morning like he always did, the remnants of his nightmare still lingering in the forefront of his mind. Tonks was being tortured, shrieking as Teddy was ripped from her arms by a version of Nagini that inexplicably had six heads.
Teddy was getting ready to graduate and everything felt like it was changing but for once he wasn't scared or holding onto the past.
After that, they didn't speak for a while. When the cab stopped in front of Malfoy's flat, he turned to look at Harry. In that moment, he wasn't Malfoy anymore. He was Draco.
The wizarding world would stand there sighing adoringly at every word that came out of his mouth and the press would criticise anything they could find wrong that wouldn't cause public outcry. It was, in a word, hell.
He got downstairs and Teddy was still looking at the Tourist Restaurant Pamphlet the front desk had offered him.
He imagined a young Sirius dancing around his room at Hogwarts with his dad, Remus, and Peter. They were having fun, singing loudly and off-key, his mum was standing in the doorway grinning at them making fools of themselves.
Harry buried his head in a cushion, knowing he was settling in for a few more hours of this taunting, at least. He tried to feel grateful that Ginny even had the spirit to laugh like this.
Harry told her again how Ron had been the one to set them up under the pretence of solving The Problem and that he wouldn't ever live it down if Ron heard they'd 'hit it off' so-to-speak. He tried reinforcing the idea that there was nothing going on romantically between them but Hermione didn't seem to buy it.
When his heart had slowed, he slid off the couch to where he wasn't quite so on Malfoy and turned to look at him. He seemed, quite honestly, more shocked than anything.
Malfoy went on to tell him that he'd been able to recognise and label every bit of DNA so they wouldn't need a pensive. It'd all gone according to plan and the best part was, Harry's dancing hadn't been bad enough to attract reporters. They made a plan to meet at the lab the next day.
Hey, all! Sorry the updates are so sporadic but I only have the wifi to post every so often so I usually write in big chunks and publish what I’ve got when I can. Thank you so much for the kudos, bookmarks, and your lovely lovely comments. Hope you enjoy! :p
Narcissa stood and he was lead out. Draco had been sitting outside the front door, smoking anxiously.
"Well, you know, no excuse to miss watching Puddlemere get some of their confidence knocked out of them."
"It's... the taste of my mum's cooking. And the lights on the trees at Christmas. It's hot summer days by the black lake and late nights when we stay up playing games in the Ravenclaw common room."
"But I like women." He didn't say it with any intonation. It was obvious to him, so why was everyone else struggling with it?
Was that really all it was? Did Harry spend so much time trying to stay close to his friends—and, hell, keep open a shop when both owners were dead—just because they reminded him of who he'd been at school? Was that why he was here with Malfoy, trying to find a connection where there was none?
He was a collection of angles—short words, smooth jaw, well-cut suit. With his hair all ruffled like it was, though, it was easier to imagine him at a younger age when the lines weren't so defined, the edges not quite so sharp.
He was busy filling out a form for Robards that was overdue by a week or so now, but he just put the form over to the side as he called for the knocker to come in. The door opened to reveal Malfoy. They didn't see a lot of each other, but they'd gotten used to bump-ins related to Teddy and maintained a professional enough working relationship to make this visit not disturbing.
Malfoy glared pointedly and Harry lowered his voice so the men couldn't hear them so well. "I bet we could solve it. I bet we could find physical evidence and convict someone of it."
"And yet you're going to make us get there an hour early just to sit in the stands and freeze our arses off?"
They all stood up to cheer as the final goal went in and Thunderbird won. It was crazy how big the universe was, that here Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy could just be two people, friends, enjoying a game.
With that in mind he drifted off, and after maybe an hour or two of unfulfilling sleep, he rolled out of bed and went to the sitting room to call her.
Malfoy almost smiled when he saw Harry seated and took the seat across from him. The food wasn't great, but it was edible. They ordered a round of chips (to share), some type of Eggplant Casserole (vegetarian, for Malfoy), a soup that was mostly just beans and corn (Harry), and Treacle tart (divided and shared). Harry was pretty sure his eyes must have lit up when he saw the Tart on the menu because Malfoy scoffed at him but ordered it anyway. Harry also made sure they both got pints and it all worked well to make Malfoy look less absolutely-fucking-devastated.
They finished the pizza without any complaints out of Malfoy, though he admitted he'd never actually had it before that night. "What did you think a house-elf would have cooked up something like this? Can you imagine my father phoning a muggle takeaway?"
When an hour had passed and they were both pleasantly tipsy as well as fully drunk on laughter, she leaned in to kiss him.
Luna sat back, looking only mildly disappointed. "Why don't you come take a seat beside me, Ginny? We can talk about the shop some more."
Malfoy grabbed Harry's hands and began jumping. Harry started laughing and let himself be pulled along as people joined in. Malfoy's head bobbed to the beat and though his face was red from exertion, his smile seemed to glow.
"Just listen. It's a great way to gauge consumer interest, it gives you a solid deadline, you can introduce new products easily, and plenty of people will be interested in seeing what all the fuss is about."
"We haven't kept up with the payments," Ginny murmured, sitting at the other end of the kitchen table and staring determinedly at her tea. "Most of the money they made went to their... funerals. And some of it went to the War Orphans Trust Fund. Anyway, there's not much left now, and I don't think we even remembered."
He said he sorted vegetables, but for all Harry knew, he was finger-painting images of Walburga in the nude.
Malfoy fished a pack of cigarettes out of his pocket and offered one to Harry. He shook his head in reply. There was no way Malfoy would have passed the questionnaire, not that it mattered, seeing as he failed to meet even the very first technically unspoken yet distinctly implied criteria: female.
He went by Malfoy Manor as soon as he could and knocked on the imposing gates. He took a few steps back when Draco answered instead of the house elf he'd been expecting.
Now, though, Harry remembered the part that asked him to think about the happiest day of his life. It had been a while since he'd had to conjure a Patronus and it had taken him some thinking. He'd realised that his happiest days had all been spent at Hogwarts and that since he'd graduated, few had measured up. Over the last couple of weeks though, the answer had shifted and his night spent teaching the children while Malfoy mixed drinks stood as one of the most fun of his life. There had been something so freeing about the night that he'd had so much worry over initially, even if he had had to suffer through dancing with a handsy witch twice his age.
It was strange looking at it through someone else's eyes. The shop wasn't like it had been when Fred and George had run it, it looked dead. The labels everywhere were peeling, the paint on the walls was chipped... even the signs out front had been out-of-date, advertising products they no longer knew how to manufacture.
A questionnaire. A way to find a woman he could kiss without feeling empty. A life-parter, no less. His future wife.
Harry looked around the empty sitting room—the brown sofa Hermione had told him was hideous but was more comfortable than his own mattress, the rows of pictures on the wall that Dennis Creevey had given him after going through Colin's camera, the old rug in the middle of the floor that Harry'd bought because it reminded him of the Gryffindor Common room—what was Malfoy seeing as he took it in? Was he thinking about how Harry was attached to the past again?
"Harry," Ron started, taking his hands and assuming the male dance position despite Harry's complaints, "you'll never learn in 9 days, you're a hopeless case and you always have been." Ron spun him around in a circle and Harry tripped over his foot.
"There's got to be something else we could come up with." Harry's patience was wearing thin, and he had started to feel hopeless.
Harry wondered if there was some charm in place that stopped him from receiving those letters, and he felt vaguely grateful for whoever had put it in place. Hermione, probably. "And your boss?"
At first, it seemed like nothing had happened, but then he peered at the ground more closely and noticed a blank spot about the size of a galleon.
"Except bringing a Slytherin to Grimmauld." Ron was eating his eggs straight out of the frying pan with a fork, and he exchanged a knowing glance with Ginny.
Kreacher rolled his old, rotting eyes so far back Harry was convinced they'd fall right out. "Kreacher remembers misters Weasley and Weasley. Unnatural, loud, horrible little creatures, them."
"Even if that were true, your chasers won't have time to win. Jones'll catch the snitch within an hour, I guarantee it."
They couldn't have been more than 12 and 10 respectively and they approached Harry with the kind of wide-eyed reverence that bothered him in adults but amused him in children. Luckily, they were far enough away from the movement that he could hear them.
"That theory is so illogical though. Who would want a bunch of virgins? I wouldn't hold it against someone, mind, but with a bit of experience you don't have to worry about coming in your pants like a fifth-year."
"Well nothing, really. It's just that... well, you're the chosen one, aren't you? You could do anything. Be an Auror, a professor... even play for Puddlemere United if you wanted to. Hell, with all the magical energy you've got thrumming through your veins, you could imperius the whole Ministry and make any changes to the Wizarding World that you want."
Malfoy met his eyes again and Harry lost his train of thought for a second, stuck on the way he was finally close enough to see the pale blond of his eyelashes. Harry'd been this close before, hadn't he? Probably focused on other things, though, like how many punches he could throw before Filch came to break them up.
When he made it close enough to the ground, he jumped down and immediately Malfoy's arms were thrown around him. "Holy fuck you utter pillock." Malfoy pulled back and then slapped him across the face which made the people watching startle.
He blinked, his gaze falling behind Harry to meet Astoria's. She gave them a wink, the finger she was trailing down Ron's collar curling possessively.
"Fuck revenge I don't care about revenge, I want them off the streets, I want my mother to feel safe in her own bloody house!"
He arrived within seconds. The halls of St. Mungos were as stark as always but they felt too bright. He asked a Medi-Witch to point him in the direction of Andromeda's room before spotting it out of the corner of his eye. Well not it, Teddy, rather. Beside him was Malfoy, sitting stoically and not looking up from his hands.
He rang Malfoy at 8:20 a.m. on his way to work and left a message to call him back. There, that was over with.
"So, will you come? I've got Butterbeer or Firewhiskey if you'd like. I mean, you don't have to, or anything. I'm sorry, you shouldn't have to feel like you're obligated, because you're obviously not."
Harry scanned the list again. Almost everyone who hadn't been crossed out would be attending. The annual Valentine's Day Award Night at the ministry was an affair only high-class wizards bothered attending. It was only three weeks away.
Malfoy took a sip. "I don't know." He clearly did know. "I guess I'm always going to feel like I owe them something. For being on the side that killed their family members... friends, classmates."
"I'm not obtuse, Potter. Besides, it's just how it is for all things, a person does something bad and the punishment feels a thousand times worse."
"You don't feel like a victim," he said after a long moment. Harry sat back in his seat. "I never did anything to you I didn't pay dearly for in the end. I never hurt you so badly you couldn't return the favour. Somehow."
There was scarcely a difference in their answers, but Patricia raised an eyebrow. She scribbled something on a piece of paper and when an elf came in with the tea, she passed the note to it.
He pulled out the swabs from his pocket and gave them to Malfoy. He had brought 40, just in case there were any mistakes, and gave all but 10 to Malfoy. The rest he would use whenever he saw the opportunity and he had other ways of getting DNA if the suspects weren't drinking.
The muttered incantations would refrain from overlapping and their hands always stayed just shy of bumping one another in the cramped section that comprised the area of the floor they could safely stand in. When Harry looked over some time later, Malfoy's brow was glistening with sweat, his cheeks a ruddy pink, his sleeves rolled up high enough to see all but the top edge of his dark mark.
"Without a job, Harry, without something to get you out of bed each day, you'll fall apart. Who will look after Teddy then? And Barkley? This is your whole life we're talking about here."
"It doesn't require me to make a nice first impression without using my natural charm and good looks."
They both stepped forward so they were out of the way of new arrivers and Harry stuck out his hand for her to shake. "Hi, I'm Harry."
"It would break Mrs Weasley's heart to lose this too, even if she doesn't know it. We can't do that to her."
"Well, I'm Verity, and I've been working at the shop since Mr Weasley and Mr Weasley first started it."
"What's this, mate? An invitation to the Ministry of Magic's Muggleborn Mixer. I remember this. It was at least five years ago when the ministry was still trying to find Pureblood's who still thought themselves better than the rest."
"Because you're the boy hero who sees the best in everybody and argued me a reduced sentence for house arrest. Anyone would believe it."
It was a valid point. The War Orphans funding went to supporting independent orphanages all around London and some even as far as Scotland, but the money from this auction was expected to be more than they'd ever had before.
They'd spent a while drinking as one big group, but then Ginny had pulled Lee up to the bar with her for some food and Ron had followed Astoria when she saw some friends she wanted to talk to.
"Pfft. And I'd do it again. One of the things I'm most grateful for in this life is that I don't have to hang onto my past." He paused. "If that's what you want to do, Potter, I won't stop you. It just isn't for me. Goyle was... well, I wouldn't exactly call him a good friend, but he was decent. And he would never have wronged me. I'm glad to know he's alive, but, frankly, that's all I need from him. No more contact necessary. Not everyone is you—not everyone wants to go back to their Hogwarts days."
"You think it's some type of gesture to initiate a romantic relationship." Harry didn't ask it like a question, it wasn't really.
Ginny's mouth flicked up at the corner, and she shaded her eyes from the sun with a hand to look up at him.
"You alright, mate? The kids are just inside, mum's watching them and Hermione's talking with Angelina. You seem all jumpy."
What would Ron have had him do? Give up talking to one of his best friends until he pulled his head out of his arse and got back together with her?
He had a point. Harry couldn't imagine spending the rest of his life with any of the women he'd taken on dates so far, but he'd rarely made it past the second or third time out.
"It's not so much getting people there that's the problem as it is having anything to sell. With both Fred and George gone now, we're at a shortage of ideas."
He looked better than the last time Harry'd seen him, but that had been just a month after George's funeral. His jacket was wrapped tightly around him, face covered in blue and gold paint.
They met for coffee the next day, though Hermione insisted on decaf as she was still breastfeeding Hugo. Harry told her the situation, minus the parts regarding the search for Malfoy's father's murderer, since she wouldn't approve of all the illegal and possibly immoral DNA gathering. He pretended that they'd instead bonded over their competitive Quidditch opinions.
"Just making an observation, Potter." She gave him another pat on the shoulder and swept out of the hallway into the main room.
Harry was taller than average (if you included impoverished countries), his eyes were nice (even if they were hidden behind his glasses), and other than his unfortunately untameable hair, he'd been told by both Hermione and Ginny that he was plenty fit. Logically, he should have a wide range of people to chose from. The only problem was, this group dwindled significantly when it came to what he wanted.
Malfoy scooted forward and picked up the toy between two fingers with a grimace, throwing it down the end of the hallway. "Fetch, you ridiculous mutt."
Malfoy took a tentative sip and frowned, presumably because he realised it wasn't poisoned. "When'd you get those?"
Draco spoke up this time. "I already owled McGonagall to say you won't be in until the start of next week." It was a Friday and this gave them plenty of time.
"Today at 4. There are only three candidates left to test and two of them live in New York." Harry put the plates in front of Teddy and Malfoy and took one for himself along with some of the coffee Malfoy had made.
Her husband was already seated and he looked to be a few years older, though his hair was a more natural auburn colour and his beard only reached his shoulders.
Harry examined the samples again. It didn't make sense. One was clearly Lucius, the blood, but the other was such a small sample, the only read he could get off of it was pureblood, and related to Malfoy. Like that helped. Except maybe it did.
"How good are you at keeping appointments? Don't care about that. Do you like Quidditch? No way, it's bloody obvious I do. We should ask their favourite team instead." He crossed it out and scribbled Favourite Quidditch Team? Correct Answer (b) Appleby Arrows.
Harry began the second half of his life by owling Ron and Hermione on his way to Malfoy Manor to tell them to meet him there. If he was correct, he'd need people to be on his side.
They talked about Malfoy's family and the war reparations and how sorry they were to have missed some of the big social events since. When Harry tried to slyly ask why they'd left the country in the first place they just blathered on about needing a fresh start and Malfoy kicked him in the shin.
"And," Ron continued, "You have to do that speed dating thing Mione's been talking about. Maybe the questionnaire will help you get rid of people more quickly. That was always your problem, right, judging people in such a short amount of time?"
Alicia started a conversation with them quickly and Harry really wished he had some wine right about now. Was that what this nervous feeling was all about? Why didn't he like Alicia more when she was, quite literally, the perfect woman for him?
