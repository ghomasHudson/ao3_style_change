"Why didn't anyone tell me vanquishing Dark Lords was this taxing..?" he mumbled to the pillow and heard Draco chuckle while sitting on the other side of the bed.
It was a disquieting notion.
Snape glowered at him and took a step towards the tunnel.
Hermione went to Harry side and saw him flinch a little in surprise.
"Only your clothes - it's impossible to
"So, what is the plan?" he asked and then.. then they planned. Because, as it appeared - Potter didn't have a plan. What a surprise. If you didn't hear the sarcasm, read again.
Her eyes stared at his for a second and then they rounded up.
"On the 12th day of May, let the trial of Draco Malfoy begin!" the judge declared and Draco came to notice soon that was the only fair thing he'd hear from the man - evidently
still lingering in his veins, making it hard to focus.
"Yes, My Lord. That would be helpful", Draco was quick to say.
" Snape growled and held Draco tighter against the wall.
Hermione was at the portrait hole right when it was starting to close and scampered out hurriedly, having to push her way through a few people. The corridor outside was silent with no soul in sight. She guessed left or right and picked right, pointed her wand and tried putting a Tracker Charm on Harry. She bet he wouldn't notice the little pinch of magic if his thoughts whirled away on other things. Her Tracker did catch on something and Hermione smiled to herself, before weaving her wand around herself to disillusion herself from prying eyes. She wouldn't want Harry to see her - or the danger he was apparently out to meet.
"Well what am I to do? With Crabbe and Goyle playing the part of an alarm and watching my every move there's little I can do to wreck your.. other plans", he all but shouted at Malfoy, who seemed slightly impressed.
A shot of red fired after the bluff jinx, buzzing with power,
to save him. Just grab him while sidestepping a little and - tadaa!
"So a diadem?" Malfoy asked looking much more alive than a few minutes earlier, when reclining back in the chance chair in the room of requirement.
Voldemort swirled The Wand in his hands, checking to see if it worked the same, after noticing such threw Draco's wand back to him.
in front of him. Nothing had made him more afraid to speak, let alone look, even something so simple as
"Play with me?" he asked, so shocked he forgot to cansel the spell.
Harry obediently sat down.
"Oh that", Draco said quietly and stared at the sky again for a while, drawing strength from there, "I don't want to see people die. And you were our only chance to live, in the long run. I just did what I could to achieve that. He made us pay back for that dearly, though. But I'm alive, still. So that's that."
"Why'd you do the same?" He asked, before sighing in pleasure, "for me it's because I really don't have any control over my life, with everyone telling me what to do and all. So I like to have it at least now."
"Voldemort!" the Dark Lord's venomous bite was interrupted when a black haired wizard jumped into view, right in front of Draco and stared daggers at the darkest wizard of all time.
He panted in a mix of relief and unease, gripping the railing tight before he looked to his side to see.. Potter standing there, looking startled and a wand pointed at him. For once it didn't make him want to grab his own. Not that he had it - it was with Potter, too.
"you saved Dobby? A house elf?" he asked incredulously and Malfoy sneered at him angrily.
Draco was becoming jelly too fast under Potter's ministrations to keep on standing anymore.
magic is. And now.. I'm a bit sad I can't learn from him anymore after he finds out what I've been doing", Draco told in a quiet but conversational tone, looking at his hands at the same time. Hands where an equally pale but softer and smaller hand suddenly rested.
in on the information, Harry? Do you know?" Mr Weasley asked gravely once they had sat down, Kreacher by Harry side.
"Potter!!!!" she shrieked and shot her murderous eyes at him, dripping with venom. "What did you do to me!?"
From out of nowhere, Granger and Weasley found themselves sitting on a love seat in front of Draco's chair with Longbottom and Luna in tow.
"No it's not, 'Mione. You're brilliant. And I think I'll get us the perfect date for this endeavor."
. It was true, the beast knew how to teach.
When their air stopped, they pulled apart, panting hot air between their parted mouths, Potter's hand moving up along Draco's spine, making him shudder. It wasn't bad at all, what Potter made him feel.
"Be careful, my dragon", she murmured softly and placed a kiss on Draco's temple,
Despite his earlier feelings of annoyance toward the man, in that moment Draco respected him and decided to mimic him. Be cool, calm and fulfill every mission the best he could, so he could work his position as a.. something of Potter's well, with theÂ slyness it needed. Because he was a Slytherin; he could do it.
In the morning, Malfoy was gone, but it didn't stop Harry being ridiculously happy about the entire thing. True, he had no idea what to expect from Malfoy now, but he got out of bed with considerably more interest in the coming day than he'd had in years. Literally years, he thought. What a waste. He showered quickly, agitatedly, and went down to the kitchen. Lupin, Bill Weasley, and Hermione were the only ones there. Had Malfoy already been there?

Potter silently led the way through the door at the end of the corridor and onto the roof. In the summer, spring and fall, it was evidently a patio of sorts. Chairs, tables, and folded umbrellas dotted the snow-dusted patio stones. Potter set his gifts down on a table and went to lean against the wall. It came as high as his mid chest and he leaned his arms against it.
Harry glanced at him in quick understanding. "Right," he agreed. "It looks like they're going to be sort of adding to the security in some Muggle hospital, but it's not really clear why. Their assignments are all pretty similar, with different categorisations."
Ginny shrugged. "Fine. I had lunch with my mother and did some shopping."
"And stayed the night?" Ginny said dubiously, though much quieter.
"There are some people who would classify masturbation as a bad habit."
"You used it once, when we talked about Ginny before. The thing that means that you only like someone because they're always around."
"Then tell me," Draco said, thrusting it at Potter like a challenge.
"But Stunning worked?" Draco asked. "I mean, on that side of the canvas, you can use your magic?"
"You've been talking to someone," Potter said. "Tell me about it."
"Over here," Malfoy said from the corner. He was crouching, but straightened up with a kettle. "I had to boil it over the smallest cauldron, since all the rest are busy."
He had seen the name of the caller on the mini display and it could wait. It was six-thirty and he wanted to go home. And in fact, he decided that today, just for once, he would do that, rather than stay another four hours dealing with the day's paperwork. He stared at the pile of said paperwork and briefly considered Banishing it all. Very briefly. Instead, Harry put down his quill, turned off his laptop, and reached for his jacket.
Malfoy jerked his head toward the tiny bit of graffiti on the wall behind Harry. "We're only halfway done," he said. "And frankly, I prefer being fucked in a bed. Not that this wasn't - but you know what I mean. Do you live with people?"
"Malfoy," he whispered, not sure what he was going to say, but wanting something, some sort of confirmation. He wanted to know if Malfoy was sure he really wanted to do this, given his history and the obvious possibility of sex-related issues.
Malfoy stopped smirking. "Sorry. I shouldn't have said that. It's just hard to resist, you know?"
"It's true," Neville said. "They did bet on it. I had to sign as witness."
"No," Harry said. "Not at all, actually. I can see you being a very good spy, in fact."
He ground himself into Malfoy's body, his cock jutting into Malfoy's and it felt so good, so right, even through two sets of robes and trousers. It didn't matter that anyone could come by, that anyone could see - he needed this, needed it so badly he might have died if someone had come and forced him to get off Malfoy. Malfoy let go of his arms and dug all ten fingers into Harry's arse. They were rutting together like animals, not two grown men - well, twenty-nine was still borderline, in Harry's opinion, but still - and Harry was seconds away from coming in his pants like a fourteen-year-old. A strangled sound told him that Malfoy had just done exactly that, the pressure between them easing into a warm pool of release. Harry was almost there, almost - Malfoy forced his hand under Harry's robes and down his trousers, jerking frantically at his cock, and it was exactly what Harry wanted, feeling so good that he could - Harry felt himself shooting into those long, slim fingers, panting into Malfoy's flushed face.
"I want to go on the monkey bars now!"
"No. Not the office. Me."
Harry was horrified. In War Year I, they'd been eighteen. 1998, the year they should have graduated from Hogwarts, was now called Pre-War Year I, the last year before the Second War started in earnest. Apart from worrying about the war and how he was going to survive it, Harry had been off realising bitterly that girls in general were not going to do it for him and being miserable over the fact that no one, male or female, wanted to get involved with the bloke voted Most Likely Not To Live Through The War. And while Harry was moping about not being able to get himself laid, Malfoy was being held hostage like some sort of sexual torture device, experiencing the sort of thing that could scar a person for life. Harry's war had been extremely public and very much supported by the entire Ministry/Order side, its armies, Aurors, and allies. Malfoy's war experience had been a private nightmare - and when it had ended, he'd joined the public war and lived through that, too.
"Of course, that's a brilliant idea, Harry", he said smiling warmly at him. Harry smiled brightly and relaxed on the couch, feeling it was good again. That was when Tonks leaned in from Lupin's other side and dangeled her hand in front of Harry's face, grining widely.
The wards in the sky, protecting them, giving a few last preciously fragile moments to share a tensed look with your loved ones, grip the wand tighter in your sligthly shaking hand and
Position: Neutral; did not fight. Custodial staff, Ministry of Magic
Albus nodded. "Yes. Okay." His eyes shifted to Harry, his mouth opening slightly, then closed again. The train stopped. Harry got to his feet.
"Ginnyâ¦ I'm not sure where to start. I'm not even sure how you - if you still - " Harry stopped, not sure how to go on.
"Sorry to have asked."
Malfoy smiled sardonically and turned toward his small stack of clothing. "I need to buy more clothes. The problem isn't you. I don't know how slowly I can make myself go, not you."
Malfoy smiled, and it was all angles and cunning, but lacking the malice it used to have. "I know. It's okay. Somehow, I have a feeling you'll be a quick study."
Harry finally found his voice. "Good God, Malfoy!"
"You know what I mean," Harry said.
"What time is it?" Malfoy's eyes squinted at the clock, but the room was dim.
"Just you."
And Harry was still hard. He hadn't found it repulsive at all, apparently. Malfoy opened his eyes, still trembling from the aftershocks. "Merlin, Potter. Who would have guessed that was your first one? It was, wasn't it?"
"Am I distracting you?"
"He's my partner for this," Harry said carefully. "He's a spy."
"But you want to know why." It wasn't a question. "Irreconcilable differences. That's what we said, and it's true. We didn't love each other, and never really had."
Harry moved a pile of books off the chair on the other side of the desk, thinking that Malfoy's office used to be so neat.
"I don't. And as long as we're talking self-pity, I'm not the one who was drinking alone in my office tonight." It wasn't a fair shot, maybe, but it was difficult to keep Malfoy from getting under his skin.
"Maybe the wards shifted."
There was a moment of silence. "What was going on when you left? I meanâ¦ was thereâ¦ who was there?"
"You can't blame yourself for this any more than I can blame the fact that it had to be me to kill him," Harry insisted. "And now I'm glad I did. He needed to die."
"Dave. Here it is, come on," Malfoy said, and pushed the pub door open with a rather large hand.
"Damn it, Snape, this is important!" Draco shouted angrily. "Go and look!"
Beside him, Malfoy shifted. "Is it just me, or is it darker in this wing?" he muttered, leaning closer to be heard. "It's a little creepy."
He sat down and attempted to gather his thoughts. Where had his sarcastic inner monologue gone? The one that was meant to be talking about how he didn't care what Potter thought of him, how he was just a bespectacled git who'd lucked his way through an entire war, how he was only doing this to satisfy a requirement. All that. It wasn't working, though. The monologue was playing now, feeding him a steady montage of reasons to discount Potter's opinion of him, but it wasn't connecting or something. He cared. He did, and it was a problem, because how was he going to get through this ordeal if he was thinking that he cared about Potter for some misguided reason? He was not the type to fuck up his assignments, and he was fucking this one up royally. Draco gritted his teeth together and told himself get it under control, force Potter to believe it was all in his imagination. There hadn't been any untoward feelings on Draco's part whatsoever.
"God, yes," Malfoy moaned, fighting a hand between them to wrap around his cock. "Do it, Potter, fuck me like you've never fucked before."
"It's Polyjuice," Harry said urgently, under his breath. "Hold on to me!"
Potter didn't answer for a moment, then said, "Five questions, and I make no guarantee to answer anything. No Quick Quotes Quills."
Harry nodded to himself. "Right," he said. He Disapparated.
"They're fine. Thanks."
Harry knew some relief. "So the entire floor doesn't know, then? That's good to know."
Potter made a hmm-ing sound. "True," he admitted. "It was a good thought, though. Is that what you came down to tell me?"
The war had aged him prematurely, though he was still agile and fit. His eyes were hard and his smile less ready, and he had become quite controlling around the office since Voldemort's defeat. Particularly with Harry, or so Harry felt. It had also occurred to Harry more than once that, had they managed to extinguish all of the Death Eaters during the war, Harry would have personally made the Auror Department obsolete. It was a natural tension that existed in his relationships around the office.
"I'm quite happily single, as a matter of fact," Draco said. He drained his glass and nodded at Potter's. "What are you drinking? Can I get you something? I need a refill."
"Okay." With that, Harry got himself out of the kitchen and off to the bedroom to hide.
"So - fucking - good - ohmyGod Potter - " Malfoy's words cut off abruptly, his breath catching, and then he howled, bucking wildly and shooting come everywhere.
Harry looked at him then. "I need the rest of this sworn under Veritaserum."
"Not far," Malfoy said, oblique as ever. He slid a look over Harry that had the instant effect of making Harry feel both nude and fifteen years old. "I wouldn't worry; you look fit enough."
Potter was still enraged. "Close the damned door!"
* * *
"I don't know," Potter said, sounding oddly content. "You can choose."
He heard the soft pops of Apparition the instant he did so. "Now!" Malfoy hissed frantically. "Hold onto me!"
Malfoy was watching him, not quite concerned, just intently. "So what are you going to do?"
Inside, Malfoy asked, in English, to see someone about a room. The - receptionist? - asked if she could help through a heavy accent. Malfoy asked for a room for two for a week. After an exchange of unfamiliar-looking paper money, they were given a key - or rather, Malfoy was - and shown down narrow hallways to a small room with two single beds within.
"So kind of pry. We have to spend another three weeks together. It probably wouldn't kill you to get to know me a little better." Malfoy offered this very casually, but Harry had the sense to realise that he was offering, and Malfoy never offered like that.
He stopped again, and Harry could hear his own heart thumping in his ears. He'd been imagining Malfoy as a war criminal, not a victim. But he'd been as much a victim as Voldemort's captives, if not more so, having to live through it over and over again. He cleared his throat, cleared it again. "How long?"
Harry paused at the door, aware that he'd hurt Lupin's feelings. He tried to think of something to say, but the instinct warred with his temper and eventually he said nothing at all, just left. Behind him, Lupin chortled audibly and Harry's temper renewed itself with vigour. He closed the door loudly and went upstairs.
Waltz up and say: "I'm sorry for everything. Let's be friends."
Voldemort had been furious, causing another trip to his mind as his scar throbbed painfully. The object of that fury had been Ollivarder, whose advice on changing the wand was not enough.
Harry cursed under his breath when Hermione pointed her wand at the rat and stunned it without further ado.
"Bugger!" Harry shouted and jumped in the air, throwing the mug out off his hands when the realisation sank in, "It's today! His hearing!!! Oh, no, ohnonono, what time is it?"
"A piece of
Draco felt shivers go down his spine when a slight, very strange, very malicious and merciless smile rose on those too thin lips. There was more to it..
The hand petting him halted and the ever calm Narcissa Malfoy shivered in disbelief.
"Why do you say so? In the end even though he's You-Know-Who he's only one man. What could he do against many of us?"
Deciding that would do the trick he stuffed the coin back to his pocket, only to feel his back slammed against a wall and a furious, angry,

again, taller, cold skin, red eyes, filled with hatred and fear,
It tore and brought terror as always, but Draco was also curiously happy.
"A verdict you were about to draw without hearing for the amends, dear judge." Draco drawled out with a bite in his words he could not hide and saw the angry glare Potter sent the man's way, while piercing gray tried to spear him alive.
The judge's lip twitched and many looked at him with even more fury than before.
He kissed Malfoy, sealing those lips and stealing that infuriating smirk away.
"It was Snape, wasn't it? He's the only one who would have known", she said and all eyes trained on her before fleeting over to Harry, who nodded.
How could he know when all heâd wanted was for that frozen feeling lodged deep in his chest to melt, even momentarily. And Ginny was funny and fiesty and beautiful, no doubt, course heâd noticed! Heâd be blind not to see, for Godâs sake! And she wanted him. People wouldnât mind them being together - okay, well Dean and Romilda might but who cared?
"You disarmed
"Will not! I'm getting sleepy so I'm going. Bye everyone!" Harry said like a little kid and shot a kind smile everyone's way before fleeing, there was an uncomfortable length forming in his pants that he willed no one to see.
âSure, whoâd want depressing when you could have me?â he said laughingly and Draco smirked, pinching his cheek teasingly.
only chuckled darkly and said it was 'good practice'. She also
"Yeah, that's when you met", he confirmed and got a pained look from Malfoy in return.
After a good while of no one doing anything but looking at each other in silent conversation, the Madam continued and gestured for Harry to continue with his tale.
"I don't hate you", he said and saw green eyes meet his more seriously.
It was over before it had even really begun and the wards disappeared in a shimmer. Voldemort smiled.
Harry was just about to say something, when a door materialized from the wall behind them and a tall black haired wizard walked out, his eyes landing on them, widening when taking in Harry and glittering with hope.
"No", she breathed, almost panicked, "I haven't - how haven't I thought of that!!?"
As they got to the door way, Fred jumped in front of them and declared in a loud yell: "The Savior's here with a redeemed Death Eater! Everyone bow in honor to the brave souls!"
"Why me?"
"Well, we never affirmed what we were because if anything of it got out, we'd both be killed by Voldwmort. But by our actions it could be interpreted like that", Harry said again, blushing a bit lesser now maybe, not so sacrled anymore. Draco had a hand on his temple and looked extremely uncomfortable.
"Wasn't that just what I said?" he asked and Tonks laughed at the pair jovially.
Harry swallowed heavily.
"Like that, Potter? See how long you can last", Malfoy hissed into his ear, the smirk evident in his hitched low voice. Harry was always up to a challenge, so he sped up his rhythm and turned to kiss the pinked earlobe so easily accessible by his mouth before nicking at it gently. Both the jerk in his hand and a sudden hiss informed him it worked, so he kept on going, doing everything he could while Malfoy also sped up while ravaring his neck and letting his other hand wonder around, too, pinching Harry's nipple from over his shirt.
The resurrection stone dropped to the ground.
It was so strange. All that had happened. Meeting Dumbledore, knowing he could

A lopsided grin rose on the black haired young man's lips and Draco snorted before he laughed aloud and earned a look from Potter.

He only had eyes for a blonde boy standing in front of him, without fear.
It didn't quite go as he'd liked, though, although
"Draco", a shrill voice, so much colder, so much more precise called for him in a whisper, "Unravel the wards for your Lord."
By noon Harry finally got a message from Malfoy saying he 'was alive'.Â  It didn't really reassure them much, more so when that was the only thing he sent the whole day.
", quiet words flowed to Harry's ears and a slight tick appeared where a brow should have been.
touching him so closely was revolting, unthinkable, unimaginable, impossible!
"Not so chatty anymore, Potter?" He asked silkily, unblinking and intimidating.
"Of course not." she said and the feeling intensified.
Draco dropped down, not caring how foolish it must look like and cast a hex before rolling, sneaking a peak at the Dark Lord casually throwing the hex off of him, before leisurely pointing that godforsaken wand at his blonde head.
"I'm not used to people worrying about me - I don't want to start now either", Malfoy said evasively and conjured black robes for himself.
Like I feel like it would feel out of sorts in this (part3) and should deserve its own part 4.
"A bloody house elf tried to murder me!" Mundungus yelled from the floor. "Don't expect me to help this kid to move come July!"
Heâd find it out sooner or later. He hoped to God it would be later.
To peel the layers away to reveal soft tanned skin, all for his lips and tingue as well as hands to explore, all the while feeling the increasing bite of chilly air on his own chest as more of his pale skin got revealed by Potter's eager hands.
No others were there in that moment and Harry could freely run up the stairs without minding the echo of his footsteps on hard stone floor. He was almost up there, and he
Snape sneered and pointed his wand up.
his mind stealthily corrected.
"Wards are also easy to take down once you know how they are made", was the only explanation given, when a slightly sadistic voice sounded:
One of Voldemort.
"There's indeed much we cannot know, but Potter must go back, it is safest that way."
Curious, they waited until the door opened and a grinning face appeared on the other side, eyebrows rising when Fred took in Draco by Harry's side.
All eyes fell on her then, and more murmuring occured, clearly baffled how two of the golden trion would take varitaserum to vouch for a known follower of Voldemort, feared by even other Death Eaters.
The kiss was a total surprise and Harry gasped, which let the invaders tongue slip in and start gliding around and twine into his - that's when Harry mind relaxed and he knew just who had grabbed him. He ran his hands up slim hips and held the body to his as his tongue danced on with the other, going from mouth to mouth, tasting something sweet, so he'd eaten already, Harry thought distractedly.
Only the content of those memories kept nagging at his mind.. Why couldn't Snape tell him?
"Sooo, a juicy scoop! The Savior and a renowned Death Eater, the favorite of He Who Must Not Be Named.. How did it feel like to be apart while he was out there waiting, just to set you apart in the most cruelest of ways?" Rita Skeeter inquired, her quill ready, hovering over a piece of parchment.
"Excellent",
over here? Right under everyone's noses? With your house elf" one of the twins asked, obviously interested and a big toothy grin on their faces.
had the locket.
thank
A memory of cold skin on his freezing being surfaced in that moment and he shuddered violently, despite everything that had happened afterwards.
He was with his family, loved ones, in whatever form they were there with him.
They heard gasps all around, but Draco didn't look at them, he looked at Potter, lowering his eyelids a bit as he did.
Haha, thank you for bearing with me~~
Some excessive noises of outrage were made now from many members around the court and the young men both scowled, Draco looking ready to scoff and roll his eyea dramatically.
"That? Can't say the word 'wank', Potter? You sound like a virgin for Merlin's sake. And why
If Potter hadn't messaged him, Draco would have likely gone back to be a shivering, terror stricken boy every time the Dark Lord was there, because he would remember that threat, like the red eyes had wanted him to remember. Become a useless coward again. He knew he was one, deep down, always fearing something.
it was honestly no wonder he had turned out so bad as he had. Without the ability to love everything was bleak, cold and full of hatred.
And she almost jumped up and did.. something. Harry would never know, because he grabbed her hand and kept her still.
Malfoy straightened up, too and ruffled his hair, trying to get it back in order.
the spell wasn't broken, it
was not there anymore, ghosting the air around with his magnificent magic.
Although that's not what Harry concentrated on.
Everyone's eyes now trained on the little, withered elf,Â sitting by Harry's side looking very proud.
"How so? Is it valuable?" he asked, eyeing Kreacher warily.
Harry wrote back and sat on his bed, resting against the board. The galleon heated up soon and new words appeared.
. Obviously!"
the air in the room had been hellish.
Haha, continuing on~~
"Didn't you just
"You are?" Draco wondered why the voice was so casual, so inquiring. There had to be more to it..
He, the insufferable git, dared send
âThank youâ, the boy only said and looked so much younger than they were, so much more pure.
Those red, red eyes lingered on his form taking in the direction his wand was pointing to and meeting a Bellatrix dancing before the dark haired witch canceled the spell. The moment between Master and his servant seemed to last forever, as those eyes turned to him again, this time..
âAnd all we do is hideâ, Malfoy finally stated resignedly.
"Not for long", Harry said and stepped aside to let Kreacher in, "We're leaving tonight actually. To the Burrow."
In their stead was a wrathfull monster firing spell after spell at Draco, wanting the boy
And he continued walking, not giving the annoying creature any more of his time. Only obstacle was that Amycus wasn't on the same wave length as him, for he whipped out his wand, pointing it at Draco with a curse on his tongue.
"Shut up already and disarm me!
"So?" the raven only asked, tilting his head a bit to the side looking positively.. kissable.
Potter's annoyance grew. He shoved his glasses up his nose with one hand, then put both on his hips. "I don't know what your problem is, Malfoy, but - "
Draco gritted his teeth. "Potter is conducting the investigation."
Harry couldn't make words happen, so he gave a stiff shrug instead and walked away from the door. Malfoy came in and carefully closed the door behind himself. He surveyed the living room, Harry's shoes and robes littering the floor. He didn't say anything, clearly waiting for Harry to start.
"Okay. When should I be here?" Harry got out a quill and scrawled down his instructions, something which Malfoy seemed to find terribly funny. Malfoy didn't say a thing about his disguise, but then, he never did. Harry was not taking the lead, so he wisely kept his questions to himself.
Name: Angus McLaughlin
"Sorry," Harry said. To Malfoy, he said, "I'm just headed over to the produce section to see if I can find some minced garlic."
Harry stiffened. He knew that voice. "What can I do for you, Malfoy?"
Potter pushed a glass of clear liquid away from himself. "What are you doing these days, Malfoy?" He sounded little friendlier, but there was a hint of interest, if a little too much emphasis on the you.
Dudley picked up his cup and began drinking his coffee the way it was. He drained half the cup and set it back down. "This is important?"
"Of course." Harry slid his out and laid it on the table. "Did you want to see it?"
Albus climbed up and sat very close to him. Harry put his arm around his shoulders and spread the blanket over their knees. "What makes you think that?"
Potter's mouth opened and closed again soundlessly. Finally, rage. "How dare you," he expostulated. "That is not how it worked! You have no idea how it was between us, no idea how I felt!"
"Upstairs," Harry said, meeting his look. "I know. Don't say it."
"Had you ever thought that before? That you might be?"
"I promise to go down on you," Harry said. He touched his mouth to Malfoy's jaw line. "I promise to touch you any way you want me to. I promise to let you fuck me. I promise to get over my issues with being gay. I promise not to deny it, or you." His mouth was moving, snagging Malfoy's ear lobe in his teeth, kissing his neck, and finally running his tongue over Malfoy's lips. Malfoy made a choked sound and closed his mouth over Harry's tongue and they kissed for a long time. A very long time. Harry was dizzy, breathless with joy and relief and desire. He had never realised just how tightly Malfoy was emotionally capable of holding another person, but some reserve had fallen away, the aloof faÃ§ade dissolving.
Over his shoulder, Draco caught a flurry of whispering between two of the other subjects, and suddenly understood why Potter had had Dumbledore's portrait relocated to a private location. "We?" Snape drawled.
Malfoy's silence was telling. "I did see that one," he confessed. "I wasn't watching, Potter - honestly. But I had to see you safely home, and it came up rather suddenly."
"Absolutely. What would you like to talk about?"
Harry stood up, face-to-face with him, and didn't know what to say. Malfoy's expression gave him a sensation of vertigo, and if he wasn't careful, he was going to fall. But it might just be too late now, anyway. He could not deny to himself that he wanted to kiss Malfoy, but that could not happen. He took a deep breath. "Shall we?"
"Maybe," Hermione said dubiously. She sat back for a few minutes, thoughtful. "Some things aren't that simple, though."
A pause. "Yes," Malfoy said. "But I'm not asking you to."
"I never said it was. But as you may have realised, I run things around here now. What do you want?" Draco was smug, relishing Potter's irritation.
"No, it seemed fine," Harry said, holding his breath for some reason.
Potter's eyes glinted. He leaned forward, lacing his fingers together. "Get right to the point, don't you."

"Here," Draco said. "I live here. Where did you think?"
Harry wasn't sure what the reason for the sarcasm was, nor why it was a stupid question, but evidently it was. "Who, then?"
The breathing changed and Malfoy turned his head to the other side. "This," he said evasively. "That I wanted this."
The ensuing confrontation was cut off at the root when Draco had swallowed hard, then backed Harry into the towel rack. "Blow me." It was half demand, half desperate plea. "Please. Just - "
* * *
Malfoy's eyes bored into his. "Pay attention, Potter. Weasley. I'm asking why you broke up with her. Everyone thought that was going to be sort of permanent."
Harry glanced at the nearly-blank parchment and resumed, though slowly. "Which Death Eaters were your direct supervisors?" he asked quietly. It was another standard question, but he usually came to that bit later.
"Go ahead."
Harry ignored the sarcasm, too. "What's going on?"
It was the closest thing Harry had ever heard to a statement of emotional attachment from Malfoy, and it struck him hard in the solar plexus. "I will," he said, and it sounded like a promise to his own ears. Likely to Malfoy's, too.
This earned disbelieving gazes and Harry took it to be his job to explain: "Dumbledore explained how Fate had touched Draco when Voldemort touched him. She granted him his immunity of fear against
Perhaps that and the fact no one knew of their break-in in the Malfoy Manor yet caused them to get such an easy way in with a goblin guiding them - not under the imperious curse, but sentimentally.
Potter looked behind at his friends, obviously worried about them.
and all shit like that Draco had no time for.
It was the same old room, divan, fireplace and even that godforsaken poker there waiting for him to trip.
Another silence followed.
A tiny bottle flew to his hand and he handed it to Hermione, who started applying it carefully, while Ron whined in pain. Soon Hermione drew back and Harry saw how the skin started growing back visibly and relaxed.
"Let's just say that", Draco muttered wanting out of here,
He went closer, to stand right where he had that first time, watching Malfoy wanking, only to now watch Malfoyâs unreadable expression. Harry didnât like it one bit. Was he mad or furious or sad or what? Just show it on your face like I do! he wanted to advise, but kept the words at bay.
to kill. But he had not.
"I'm happy if you're happy Harry. I'm sure your parents would think so, too. No matter who you end up with. Mafloy here is quite a good option, considering all he did for you and you for him in the final battle", the werewolf said with an easy smile.
"Doubt it", George said with a shake of his head, "Think about the morning ruse, with a steel faced Lucius Malfoy looking at his son sitting next to a Potter. No one would want
"Slow down!" Potter said slowly, almost yelling.
Harry shook his head and said: "No problem, I understand."
"So is this just so we do not fall under the table when learning he's not an evil git?" George asked humorously and Harry had to laugh, before shaking his head.
"I did?" he asked, horrified. Oh no.. This wasn't going to be good..
A crack sounded to his left and Draco's head jerked up.
"I guess.." he consented finally, huffing a bit, "I say we are.. Potter and Malfoy. An annoying brat and an insufferable git who somehow got together."
"It's too easy to know Potter", he drawled and dragged them a bit further into the shadows, "Snape's been glowing about you having detention every Saturday, You've got Quidditch practice at least twice a week and then some stuff with Dumbledore when you don't and then there's your homework - in short, you're busy everyday."
", he said in a chuckle and lowered his lips to meet Harry's in a languid kiss, before deepening it further by probing at the seam of his lips with a tongue. Harry let him in and met his tongue with his own, tasting and saying all they did not otherwise say. Harry's hands rose to entangle in blonde curls, but Malfoy stepped back and held them in his.
"Go", Lord Voldemort whispered into the night, voice carrying along in the wind like the mightiest of bells, "And bring me Potter.
"You still won't let me do you?" Malfoy asked in a breathy, annoyed voice while going up Harry's chest, giving it light kisses as he went.
"It's like a crown, right?" Neville asked and Draco nodded, "We should ask Luna."
"Thank you", Harry said with a smile.
Draco felt a bit bad at dampening the mood so much with only one sentence.
"Yes", they gritted out, "Harry/I came/went to retrieve the Elder Wand."
angry, "That filthy thief stole it from my Mistress' ancestors house! That filthy thief.."
As Harry got to the point they were at the Shrieking Shack and Draco saved Snape with a poison cure and his recently acquired Healing skills, they all just stared at him and Draco, of course, enjoyed it to the fullest after the disrespecting gazes from earlier.
He dared a look at her. She stood there, mouth a tight white line much like McGonagall's, eyes brimming with hurt and anger. Before Harry even knew what was happening, he was punched hard on the jaw by her. He took the hit silently, letting the pain perhaps relieve something in her. Ginny was hokding her fist with a grimace.
Harry blanched at her words, grimacing a little and thinking back now... she had been fairly suspicious.. on many an occasion.. Harry huffed a little in defeat.
Anyone..!?
right this second. Draco gulped and moved faster than ever before, rolling more swiftly than he ever had, pushing his body to stay out of
Draco smirked and soon saw a similar one on Potter's face.
Hermione looked at the wards on the right door and smiled a little.
Hermione sat, once again, in the Gryffindor common room. Only this time Harry sat beside her, staring at the same page on his Potions essay for ten minutes already. Something was wrong with him, she knew.
! Was that you? Won't you get in trouble?" The black haired boy gradually turning into a man asked, looking worried.
So knocked out she was.
and the like, but it makes you grow. Become more.. human. See things differently while shouting in pain and writhing on the cold hard floor while
"I'm quite sure this is far from what you'd require, but I'm here, aren't I? We can be hiding here, brooding alone but together. I'm far from family to you, far from someone you'd care about, but sometimes.. That's just what feels right."
"One of us? You think it will be you, do you, the boy who has survived by accident, and because Dumbledore was pulling the strings?" Voldemort inquired in a mocking voice, carefully petting the wand in his hands.
........
that perhaps it would all come to be okay, that Fate was not fighting against them.
âI would bare my fangs for you.â
"I wouldn't mind. I'd hate to be left alone now", Draco said, startling himself with the answer as much as did Potter.
Harry frowned, staring at the delicate piece and thinking..
âWell alright, alrightâ, Harry laughed and looked to the flames now himself, âI think I might have liked her earlier this year, so it was almost natural when she has been so open with me this year. I know sheâs liked me since forever, so it wasnât about that either. And sheâs free, you know? No need to hide. I guess I wanted to try something like that.â
Ron.. was off snogging Lavender Brown.
Hermione was there, in their wards, looking for him anxiously. She flew out with Ron in tow, looking all Hermione in her worry and sudden hugs. Harry answered that hug gladly, missing the warmth of another so quickly taken from him. By being in her soft arms, his determination came bursting back.
, though", he said grinning widely and relished in the amused frown forming on Draco's forehead.
Draco cast a wordless
Their mouths crashed together again, both willing to come out as the victor in their battle of wills, lips and tongues.
Draco stood stiff and still, registering what Potter had said while the man in question looked down and bit his bottom lip in unease.
want to do. Stay or leave?"
"Yeah, I'm going to them - I'm just a waste of space with you anyway", Harry said, a bit bitterly but was surprised when Dudley spoke up: "I don't think you're a waste of space."
"Nonsense. We are much alike, true, but your intention is untrue. He is not yours but
"You said.. you got information - from where?" Lupin asked by his side and Harry looked guilty.
Every once in a while, there was a prickle in the lightning bolt scar on his temple, making a foreign unease known.
He was home. In the real definition of home, with his family.
Once they were out the door, Harry was crushed in a tight hug by Hermione.
"Yes, mother", Draco said and got up with his mother's help.
She wouldn't stand for this any longer!
"Yeah, yeah, I'm busy, you're busy, we're busy - I get it okay", he said and shook his head in exasperation.
", he bit out and smeared a bit of precum while fitting his length at the entrance, "Maybe I should really let you try this one day.." The rest was an inaudible mumble, but Harry's eyes widened in interest.
"Oh, right, before I forget: mother mentioned she would like to meet her sister and her offspring, meaning you and little you, someday if possible. She promised to write a letter but asked me to brake the news first", he said flippantly, like delivering that.. news, no life altering changes of family wanting to meet after decades.
"You're still an insufferable git, Malfoy", Harry more whispered than accused.
to destroy it."
They would have come through either way, his brains supplied him with information. Yes, it didn't matter it was Draco who took down their wards... but still Harry's heart cracked just the tiniest bit seeing that blonde head there.
"Don't go falling again", he quipped in a small laugh before falling silent again, gaze locked on in somewhere far beyond reach.
Only.. Instead of the divan, there was a strange mixture between a divan and a bed next to the fire, looking comfy and nice - and just perfect.
Apparently, the judge had a
And Harry was drewn to the taller blonde with one strong hand, the other holding a wand next to near-white curls.
"We both walked the length. Combined wishes it is", he said and went to sit by the fire, looking back to Potter from behind his back.
He moved slowly closer and nudged at the still tight entrance with his cock, groaning at the feeling even that made. Harry looked up at him with wide eyes.
Now there was that gleam in her brown eyes, a gleam that told them she knew what they were to do while they still didn't get it.
Harry just tagged along and hoped all would go well.
Or how Potter would have said, not only, only the least corrupting.
Harry blanched at that and stared at the taller man.
For his feelings.. he could do nothing.
Harry reached out and grabbed Malfoy's head by his blonde hair and pulled him down for a searing kiss.
Draco shivered profoundly from head to toe, and not just once but repeatedly.
It appeared she was so frazzled her emotions mixed with the words.
Ron looked speechless.
Now he only had his mother's love.
meant. his eyes filled with the fear difficultly kept at bay till then. Another smile shook him to the core.
Kreacher used the stunned silence to his advantage and sprang the skillet again straight to Mundungus' stomach, eliciting a pained groan from him. He bent down in pain and Kreacher stepped back, looking very pleased with himself, but Harry, Ron or Hermione didn't care about either of them now.
The second they were asked to scatter, Draco got up, ready to bolt from the stuffed snake laying contently on the table. He saw Bellatrix stay, to fawn over
They bickered and dashed for the door, where Draco turned and yelled at her mother: "We'll be at the Manor!"
Great. Okay then.
having Snape somewhere alone was not a good thing.
Because she'd vowed that,
It was all a way different from the safety measures in Harry's vault for example. That damn waterfall, a dragon trapped underground and finally the most annoying, multiplying treasures in the vault in itself. It took a while to get through, with finally Harry trying to touch something with Gryffindor's sword and the object not multiplying, they levitated him up over the treasures to get the cup.
He was ashamed, anyone would be in his shoes right now, he knew.
Snape and Draco exchanged a glance and both had came to the same result. Neither smiled, just stopped next to each other and mat their pursuers.
"I've been thinking this for a while now, but we
Mundungus looked dreadful.
he said against his lips, never once breaking his eyes away.
"What was that?" Draco asked crunching his nose.
Hermione met his gaze and decided. She would give her support, any way she could without giving out too much.
"Ginny!! To do that - you know the woman's a harpy!"
When Hermione blushed at the words all three of their eyes rounded and Harry and Draco screeched: "You DID!?"
Harry ran, eager to find it before Malfoy, but.. he had no idea where there it was.. It was like maze, with similar yet different things piled here and there, making it hard to navigate where he had been. To his luck, Malfoy seemed to share the same thoughts. But also to Harry's dismay, his thinking was faster than Harry's.
"Oh we have", Luna said while smiling dreamily, "In my fourth year when the inquisition squad manhandled us."
"What was it you wanted?" he mumbled sleepily, not having noticed how tired he was until Luna stopped his thoughts from whirling around and Potter came in yawning.
The twins eyes went as wide as saucers and identical wicked grins rose on their lips.
Draco didn't value her unreal naivety. He said as much, too.
They did not let out the tiniest of noise, not in Malfoy Manor, not unless it was desired.
Hermione looked up at his question, clearly perplexed.
. My Death Eater, forever marked by
He wanted them to stand side by side, hold their hands like he saw Lupin and Tonks do just a tad bit further from him. Tonks had flown in a few minutes earlier, unable to let them fight without her. Harry understood her, he really did. He wanted to run to the other side right this moment and snatch the blonde to be with him, standing at the apex of it all - but how could he do something so selfish?
"You can just tell later that Potter was being his own usual hotheaded self and ran away under his cloak or something - I can even get you the details later. We all know he does stupid shit every time and that would cut it - especially if his friends were to be in danger because of him. And it's done already, he's not gonna move on that day."
Even the sole loss of his mentor, friend, the most powerful wizard of time, left him wallowing in sadness and to add the probable betrayal of Draco? It was all Harry could do to stay sane.
my clothes and successfully getting me out of range. She continued my pursuit and Draco had to face Voldemort because he was going to kill Snape for betraying him, too. They battled but eventually Draco got hurt and he fell, Voldemort stepping closer and they.. talked.. I had finally gotten rid of Bellatrix by that point with help from Hermione and Ron and went to save him. Then we battled and our curses got stuck together. My
âPoor excuse, Potter - I donât believe youâ, he contradicted and tilted his chin to look at Harry with sparkling silvery eyes.
"We meet again, Carrow", Draco greeted and watched the eyes stare at him in an angry glare, "But I doubt.. you'll remember it.
stated then and red eyes turned to Snape, thin lips in a smile,
Harry shuddered. He couldn't help it. And watched a knowing smirk lift to those pale lips. He wanted to make it away, immediately. But his hands were kinda occupied, trying to keep another pair of hands from wandering, so he did the only other thing possible in that moment.
"He's a bloody thief", Harry interjected, "Been stealing stuff from Grimmauld Place even though I told him to stop. Kreacher wasn't happy about it, either, naturally."
The one
HeÂ sighed in resignation and hopped off of the sill. Better do something else than sit here all day, he thought and went to his bed to take his wand, when his eyes drifted to something that wasn't really his - a galleon on the table. It was what Mafloy had given him, dropped really, just before Snape dragged him away.
taught him, only to accidentally land in front of his most feared enemy.
leave today already.
horcruxes", Harry groaned, wanting to smack his head like Dobby all those years ago.
eyes going wide when the picture of Malfoy on the divan, touching himself registered into his mind and he actually comprehended what he was seeing.
Hermione knew then who was there, who'd made Harry so careless - his obsession of the year. Draco Malfoy. And maybe the Potions book could count as one, too. Harry had many obsessions this year.
Luna was well, too, after being taken as a hostage to lure them in, and Harry was glad to see her again. They talked and smiled to the early morning, getting a few hours of sleep at last when their eyes were refusing to cooperate.
"You dare say Harry Potter, the Savior of the Wizarding Wolrd, the Chosen One,
Every once in a while, there was an unknown anger rising inside of him, making Harry almost
"It's a boy!" he shouted happily and after the understanding hit in, there was a round of delighted laughter, smiles, claps on the backs and tight hugs flowing around.
her, then seeing her sleeping there, restless as hell, but still sleeping, defenceless, the feeling only intensified. He hated her more than anyone, more than Voldemort himself. Hermione saw him tensing and knew what he was thinking.
"Thanks Granger. You're brilliant, too, from what I've heard from Potter", he admitted honestly, a changed man he was, "No use denying that."
"I didn't think you were willing to come out yet, Potter", he drawled, drawing all eyes to him, reclining leisurely in the armchair.
I'm sorry..? Again?
"It's good to have you back, Harry."
They mostly trained in his dreams. Draco was there once again, standing in front of the Dark Lord, the scariest man in history and smiling, grinning wildly from ear to ear when praised by the man - a feat so rare and wondrous Draco had lost all ability to form coherent thoughts the first time it had happened.
He hadn't needed to wait long for Hermione's reply.
feet: bare feet, bony and looking frozen. A black robe swirled slightly in movement.
"When is it ever easy?" she asked with a little mysterious smile hanging on her lips. "When is it ever painless? It's not. And that makes it life, worth living for, don't you think, Draco Malfoy?"
So Malfoy earned a stab in the ribs.
Together they sat and watched how everyone else was living a normal a life as possible.
Snape's name could be seen on the Map, too, disappearing sometimes at the same time as Malfoy's. Hermione turned to Harry, to see him calm. Strange, she thought and stared at the Map. Maybe there was another secret Harry wasn't telling her.
The Burrow was a good.. and a bad place for a few reasons. They had mutually agreed to tell everyone of Harry's 'family' there, to cut down the number of times they had to share their relationship story, but that brought together all kinds of possible reactions, too... Some they didn't know would be like what, exactly.
Well thought Granger, Draco applauded her in his mind and said: "Well... if you are allowed, then why not us?"
I finally get to taste what freedom is like", he murmured into Harry's ear the second they were outside and secured him in a tight grip before they apparated away from the Burrow.
Albus thought about this. "No," he said uncertainly.
Malfoy nodded slowly, exhaling. "I guess that's fair," he said. "This is all very new for you. Your first time with a male, at least on purpose. All of that. And that it's me, too."
Malfoy held the door open and stood back. As Harry passed him, he said, "I'm alone at the moment. My wife and son are at her parents' for the weekend." His tone was casual, but Harry heard past that.
"You're not. I'm there already. How can it be pushing if I'm already where you want me to be?" Their elbows were resting on the edge of the wall, but Harry dropped his arms and pulled Draco's hand into his.
He was both hurt and embarrassed by it, as well as a little angry. What the hell was Malfoy's problem? Were Harry's feelings that obvious? They must have been, given what Pansy had said. If Malfoy was trying to make the point that he wasn't interested and never had been, that their drunken encounter had been a ridiculous mistake - confirmed by Harry's lousy performance - then he'd made it. Harry saw no need for him to go on making it every time they happened to be in a room together. He also didn't understand why he would sometimes find Malfoy watching him resentfully, something hateful smouldering in those unfathomable eyes.
"How long did you want it?"
"Look, Harry. My hand is on your cock, which is at half-mast at least, I might add, and obviously I get off on it, too. I don't know why you're so hung-up about it."
"Yes. I did. Mostly."
"I guess I don't have one."
He woke alone, but Potter's side of the bed was still warm. He'd stayed the night, then. Good. Draco turned onto his back and smiled at the ceiling, thinking about it. The very thought of Potter made his pulse stir to life, racing ahead of itself again. A more sobering thought was what he'd told Potter he would do. He thought about this and felt curiously free from regret or second guesses. It was the right decision. It was morally right, and it was something he'd needed to do. Perhaps it was just seeing Lucius that made him realise afresh that he was not a younger version of his father and had no intention of becoming what he'd become. More likely it had to do with seeing what his father was still capable of doing, even as a portrait. He thought of Potter's son, and hoped for both father and son's sakes that Albus was all right.
"Kind of my thoughts," Draco said, with a half-smile.
"I thought you didn't want to do this, since it turned into something you weren't expecting." Malfoy set Ron's file aside and scanned Hermione's.
Malfoy paused. "No. Let's talk about something else." He sounded uncomfortable. "Besides," he added, sounding like he'd gotten up and moved in the opposite direction - "those weren't the first times I'd been there. I'll be right back." The bathroom door closed, leaving Harry temporarily alone.
A chain cafÃ© appeared ahead and Harry made for it. He bought Ginny's coffee and his own and found a corner table.
"So I've been told," Malfoy said, smirking. "And thank you. Cheers to that." He handed Harry a glass and held out his own to be clinked.
Ginny didn't speak to him at all the next day, nor the next. Harry stayed on the sofa and nothing was said about that, either. He spent more time at work and tried not to think about it. Thinking about Ginny made him feel sick to the stomach. Thinking about Malfoy, thoughâ¦ it had a very different result, and it wasn't the now-familiar one. It was Friday, past six in the afternoon. Harry got up abruptly from his desk and went to stand near the window. It was underground, of course, but the illusion was that of a view from the seventeenth storey of an office tower. Rain was falling lightly, the sky muted with piles of light grey cloud.
Malfoy turned around. For a long time, he just looked at Harry. It wasn't uncomfortable. Then he said, "You do understand."
A long pause. "Iâ¦ don't know if I can say," Malfoy said reluctantly.
Harry went over, sat on the edge of the chair and bent to kiss her forehead. She allowed it, smiling slightly. Having distracted her, Harry found the remote on her knee and hit the mute button. "Hello." He was not about to compete with the television.
"I'll be right back." Draco ducked back into the crowd to seek out a waiter. He was talking too quickly, probably coming off forced and unnatural. Potter would notice, at least if he'd been any good at the Behavioural Observation unit. Why was he nervous? He couldn't possibly be that worried that Potter would refuse to be friends with him. So far it was going well, despite his stiltedness. Draco spotted a waiter and headed toward him, lifting his empty glass in signal and decided that it was anxiety about his certification. He nabbed two brimming glasses and went back to the table. Potter was waiting, leaning his chair back against a wall, hands shoved deep into the pockets of his tuxedo.
"James says there won't be," Albus said. "He said all the spots are taken on the Gryffindor team."
"You know better than that."
"You did know," he said.
She nodded, eyes travelling over his face in recognition. "That's me. I'm not alone, though. There are three of us."
If Harry hadn't looked at him just then, he probably would have let Malfoy go, and that would have been that. But he did look, and saw an odd expression in Malfoy's eye for just a split second, and it spurred him to motion. "Wait!" It was urgent, and he was across the room in seconds, yanking Malfoy around by the shoulder to pin him to the doorframe.
"You're not."
"Why I'm taking this so badly?" Draco repeated disbelievingly. "You're the one who had to rush over here as soon as you heard."
* * *
"We don't have to figure it out now. I'm more interested in getting pissed."
Malfoy nodded. He looked worried but not afraid, and something about that made Harry feel a little better. "I'll talk to you soon," he said.
"I know," Malfoy said, laughter in his voice. "I picked him up when he left your place - I was finished for the night, anyway - and persuaded him to do me, too."
"Maybe you and Ginny can work something out," Hermione said. "Depending on how she takes the news, I guess. Maybe you shouldn't talk about custody issues right after you tell her about Malfoy. That might not go over well."
"Just curious," Malfoy said, slightly defensive. "As long as we're on the topic, are you seeing anyone now?"
The light was fading again. Malfoy had transfigured his robe into a thick blanket and had been intermittently sitting on it, then getting up to pace and poke into the corners of the cabin, sometimes muttering spells, other times lapsing into prolonged silences. Harry just lay where he was and tried not to fall asleep. Not thinking was difficult. After a bit, Malfoy returned to his blanket and sat down.
Harry searched for something to say. "How are you?"
"Yes."
Harry realised heavily that it counted with him. He couldn't abandon Malfoy now because he didn't want to. He cared too much. It was difficult to know how much of that came from his genuine concern for Malfoy's physical and emotional wellbeing and how much of it came from whatever the hell was going on with Harry himself, but maybe that part was less relevant. The point being that there was someone in obvious need, who was too stubborn or too proud or too embarrassed (or all of the above) to ask for help.
Malfoy's shoulders were hunched. He looked miserable, Harry thought, looking at him across the bed. He supposed that if he had agreed to stay in order to keep Malfoy company, there wasn't much point in adhering only to the letter of the law. Malfoy had done something he usually didn't do: admitted weakness and asked for help, in whatever strange form that had been. Could it hurt to get over himself and just let Malfoy sleep near him, the way he had in the office? Harry moved over and hesitantly put a hand on Malfoy's side, the way he sometimes did with Ginny when she was angry with him and he was trying to placate her.
And letting it happen.
wards.
Draco Lucius Malfoy!"
"He's an infuriating git who gets me and is funny and intelligent but also independent and gifted in things I'm not while I'm at things he's not", Harry said, just wanting the lift would stop already...
"Spies stick together", he ground out, fighting off the desire to just run and never see the monster again, "And I saved him once already from you this evening - I'd rather not do that again, but what needs must..."
He asked and the coin heated again after a short while.
"That is actually quite dexterous", Lupin allowed by his other side, offering a slight smile before it grimmed, "But also dangerous if someone had seen."
"I'm sorry", he finally said sadly and smiled a little, goofily tilting his head to one side after it. "I'm known to be rash and stupid - certainly you know that as you've said it yourself so many times. I guess it's hard for us all, this war. I can't say I understand what it's like to be you right now or ever, but know that I think there are choices we all can do. There's always a choice - whether a better or worse one is unknown, but there are. And those choices, they make us into who we are. Dumbledore taught me that years ago and I've come to know it's true. What I'm trying to say.. Well.. I hope that whatever you choose, in whichever situation it is that you'll do the right thing. Not only for everyone else, but for you too. I don't want you to become a useless sacrifice either. Whose plans would I ruin then?"
Harry had never been a good liar and he was sure she deserved a truth so he faced, her bringing every bit of courage he had and saying: "I'm very sorry Ginny, to have brought you in on any of this."
"Get me something from my purse, Harry! Quick! Essence of Dittany. Ron got splinched!"
He pointed his wand at the wound and tried the healing spells he knew, some working better than the others - it was such a luck of a draw with the blasted snake's venom.
", Voldemort growled at Harry the moment his red eyes snapped up to meet his green in a heavy stare.
Sure enough the coming victim of his whim frowned.
Harry thought to what Mundungus had said and asked: "I know I'm going back for the summer because Dumbledore wanted that, but how are we going to get me out? There's two months left unknown between that and this - who knows what Voldemort decides to do during that time."
Well of course.
Failing quite badly if he said so himself.
"Ehm - thanks, Dudley", he stammered and was a bit flushed himself, too.
No flames burst out to scorch their faces, no yells of the fiendfire to lick their ears. Only a room, dark and inviting in its calm.
Harry nodded, too, smiling brightly at her.
Draco trained his neck to the side to look up.
, more precisely, he screwed Yaxley over was kinda bad.
"Little woman. Bow on top of âer head...Looked like a toad."
Harry looked down on the Marauder's Map and saw the snake walking steadily ahead on a corridor in the seventh floor. Harry hurried along, safely tucked underneath his invisibility cloak, of course, so he would catch up on the boy.
"I didn't bloody hell know you can heal too", weasel said in awe, venomously annoyed at being impressed.
"You didn't tell it was me, back at the Manor", he said simply, like wondering if Draco had a really bad memory or was just dumb.
"I guess there aren't", she bedrudgingly admitted but added, "Don't you dare disappear anywhere on your own, though! Merlin knows you always end up in trouble!"
"He disarmed You-Know-Who?" Hermione gasped, a hand landing on her mouth.
"Dobby?" Draco's voice was incredulous.
In the end, he didn't run into Potter, but Potter ran into him.
Malfoy's voice ended in a whisper so fragile and silent Hermione thought if it was real anyway. She also had a hard time comprehending all that Malfoy'd said just then. She had never thought about it like that - that he had to live with You-Know-Who, actually live with him and his anger and propensity to start murdering if something went slightly wrong.
They ran for the lift, the girls chuckling behind them, even Ginny now more relaxed and in sync with the revelation. Skeeter was only a few feet behind them, taking a mad run as she saw they did so, too. They had to stop by the lift, to first wait it arrived and then for it to open it's doors...
Harry stared at the longest string of messages that the coin had ever showed and took a shaky step back. Snape had.. followed Dumbledore's orders? What the hell!!? Who in their right minds would ask someone to kill them?? But then his thoughts took him back to that night, to those words the Headmaster had said.
"I went to the bathroom", he gave an absentminded reason for disappearing so suddenly.
They let the meaning sink in, when Hermione suddenly looked up.
âIt was inevitable. Maybe now Iâll get to live a few months more, at least.
"You were being pissy, so I shut you up."
as the giant snake appeared and coiled around the chair on the top of the table and white slim fingers petted the coils absentmindedly.
Harry stammered even more then.
It's been fun and stressing (deadlines to meet..hyrr), nightless nights and the lack of sleep I now have. I apologize for the varying balance of good and bad this has - I'll edit this whole thing once the clock doesn't show 1am with my alarm clock showing 5.30am..... Which is sometime after finishing this.. which will be someday - I don't even promise anything anymore, haha.
Narcissa stood back up and declared calmly: "He is dead, My Lord."
"Oh."
Harry's question filled the silence and Malfoy turned his neck to look at him.
A hand petted his head, like so many times before, always so gentle and warm.
"That's what they said," Neville confirmed, watching him warily.
The conversation on the walk was fairly stilted, but not as bad as Harry had expected. Malfoy seemed determined to keep things on moderately friendly terms and Harry tried to be accommodating. "So, Head Auror," Malfoy said as they left the building. "Impressive, Potter. Not that I expected any less."
Harry sat alone in the drawing room for a long time.
Her face brightened. "Of course!"
"It isn't," Potter said bluntly. "We've been separated since last May."
He was dressed appropriately for Diagon Alley, dark dress robes with the sort of metallic design down the front that his father had favoured. His hair was swept back from his face but not slicked the way it had been in their youth. He looked good, well-dressed and attractive. Harry felt instantly sloppy and straightened his glasses self-consciously. He fumbled after something to say. "I, er, Iâ¦ right. Sorry. Buying a cauldron, I guess."
"Revenge," Scorpius said coolly. "He left my broom up there the week before."
* * *
"That doesn't really sound like Malfoy," he said. "I mean, I can certainly understand people not wanting to work with him, but since when does he not show up for work?"
"A job, maybe?" Lupin prodded.
Harry hadn't even been thinking as far ahead as a relationship - he wasn't remotely opposed to the idea, but he just hadn't gotten that far. He supposed it was true. "But - " he stopped, trying to gather his thoughts. "Yeah, that's true, I guess. But it just feels right - couldn't you feel that, in the mosque?"
Malfoy looked anything but sure of himself. "But this isn't what youâ¦ you could just fuck me, if you want."
The horsie in reference was a small metallic one mounted in the sand on a large spring. Harry nodded. "Hang on tight," he said.
Harry nodded, waiting for her reaction with tense anticipation.
Harry floundered. "I don't - I don't know what I was going to say."
"Permission to serve as your squire, sire?"
"That much," Ginny said nastily, "is very clear. I can't even believe you're saying these things to me. We've been married seven years. Seven years, Harry. I've known you for much longer. Of course I know you're a 'real person'! And give you a break? What else have I ever done?"
Draco rolled his eyes. "Spare me," he cut in. "Let's get this over with, shall we? I have a busy day."
"I haven't even thought about that in years and years," Harry said. "Besides, you might have saved my life at yourâ¦ at the Manor."
"One of the perks of being the Boy Who Lived," Potter reminded him, using one of Draco's own jabs. "Okay, we're on Fulham. Where to?"
Harry made a random gesture. "I don't know," he said again. "I hadn't given it any thought. I mean, I didn't know the Death Eaters were gone. Yeah, I guess so."
"Actually," Malfoy said, "yes. There are a couple of accounts that show a regular transfer at precisely the same time, but it only happens quarterly. Once every three months," he added for Harry's benefit.
"I would imagine so."
Potter glanced around the nearby portraits. "Can you check the ones on the east wall here? I'll look over here."
"Oh my God, Malfoy," she said, voice muffled. "I can't believe I didn't recognise you!"
"Ginny wants a divorce."
"It was just a thought." Harry spotted a sign. "Let's go here."
Harry found that he was, and said so. "There's a restaurant just inside the East gate that I want to show you," Malfoy said. "It's really nice, despite its name - The Casablanca - and it has real, sit-down meals and good service. I thought maybe you were getting tired of shwarma and falafel."
Dudley leaned back. "Huh," he said. "I don't know. Maybe. I think so. It's all on disc now, so I could maybe make a copy or something."
He was in a cafÃ©, watching Malfoy watch Ginny from behind a Muggle newspaper. Malfoy wore glamours, but his eyes were unmistakable, as was the awareness and focus with which he watched Harry's wife. She was sitting across from a man Harry did not recognise, leaning forward over the table, speaking in a low, intense tone. Her companion's responses were terse and urgent. Phrases drifted back to Malfoy's ears; Harry overheard them.
Harry woke with a start, drenched in sweat, his heart pounding. It was just a dream. A dream, he repeated to himself. Nothing more. Nothing real. He listened over the thudding in his chest for any sign that his wards had been disturbed, but he couldn't feel anything. Everything was silent, except for the sound of Ginny fidgeting in her sleep nearby, probably disturbed by Harry's sudden movements as he'd woken.
"We'll see, then."
"Yes," Malfoy said, forestalling Harry's question, his eyes holding Harry's like magnets.
Draco pushed a little further in, waited, then experimentally pulled out a bit and began to thrust, very gently, with just the first two inches or so. He shifted, searching for something that was really much easier to find with one's fingers, and -
"I like rain."
"I meant my comfort," Malfoy said snidely. "We can't afford to lose you."
Only it was more than that. They would know if it was just put on. He would know. It did have to be genuine if it was going to accomplish the task they had set him: to get past his own personal weakness of character. He knew in his heart of hearts that it was more than just Potter. It was about turning tail when the going got tough. And while joining the Ministry's side of the war instead of waiting it out in Italy like Blaise or Switzerland like Pansy, he'd stuck it out in England and fought. Surely that had to speak well of his strength of character. Draco thought of Dumbledore, saw his wand wavering as his resolve crumbled before his eyes and clenched his jaw in remembered humiliation. They were right. It was a weakness, and a weakness that could betray him if he didn't take care of it. Potter was certainly the trigger he'd possessed the longest: the instant path to his own insecurity and consequent anger.
"I want to go higher!"
"Probably because Hermione wouldn't let him bring it to their place when they got married," Harry said dryly.
"Better this insanity than the other sort."
Harry tried to think of something to say that would make sense to that. It struck him as being the best idea. The only good idea, at this point. "Right," he said, still staring at Malfoy.
Malfoy was watching him guardedly. "Meaning what? Where are you going with this?"
"Wh-what are you doing?" Malfoy stammered, pulling at his hair. "Potter, you don't have to do that! I mean - "
For some reason, Harry felt faintly embarrassed by this, as though Malfoy had mentioned something that should not be spoken of in public. "Malfoy," he said, not sure what he wanted to say. "Erm, Iâ¦ don't worry about that."
"I knew," she said, shaking her head to herself. "I saw the signs and just ignored them, told myself that you wouldn't still be with me after all this time if you weren't straight. I even saw your shorts after you spent the night at Malfoy's, but I made myself believe that you'd just had an erotic dream or something. I have only myself to blame. And now you're leaving me for him, aren't you? You're leaving me for a gay alcoholic turncoat."
Malfoy's gaze was unwavering. "Why do you think they want the Order broken up?"
__________________
Harry was well aware of that, as Malfoy's wand was their only source of light when the windowless gloom faded to black every night. He knew that the offer would be flatly refused, as always, but he had to say it. "Can I try it?"
Malfoy looked him over, very definitely seeing him. "Yes. Your aura is baby blue, Potter, how sweet."
Malfoy was yawning. Harry went around the desk and looked down at him. "You're awake?"
Malfoy glanced up and caught Harry watching him. "What?"
Fine. He would see Malfoy. He would even be friends with Malfoy. But anything else was off limits until Harry figured himself out. He would have to be very firm on that point.
"Is it traceable?"
They returned to the tower and to Draco's surprise, Dumbledore was sitting in Snape's frame, chatting amiably with him. Or rather, Dumbledore was chatting amiably and Snape was making monosyllabic responses. They both looked up when Draco got back to the office, Potter just behind him. "Ready, then?" Dumbledore asked Potter.
Draco waved it off with the bottle and passed it back. "I don't need to know what you do, Potter. Relax."
For a few minutes, the silence grew. "How did you know it wasn't Voldemort?" Malfoy finally asked, breaking it.
That entire day was a little strange, but Malfoy was carefully his usual self, making no reference to the previous night. As he wasn't talking about it, Harry didn't bring it up, either. Considering how uncertain he still felt about it, he didn't know what he would even say when it came up, as it likely would eventually.
She waited patiently, looking at him.
Harry could feel Malfoy's eyes on him and wondered if his face would give him away. Wouldn't that be wonderful, to have Malfoy suspecting that he was stuck living with someone who - no. "Just stuff," he said vaguely.
Harry understood. Or thought he did. "Would you rather fuck me?" he asked. It was the first time he'd considered the idea of someone actually penetrating him; in all the years he'd known he preferred men, he'd always assumed he'd be the one topping. But there was no question in his mind that, despite his doubts about bottoming, he would do it for Malfoy. He eased himself out of Malfoy, his cock making a small suction noise, and dug his arms in under Malfoy's back.
Another silence began. Malfoy's body gradually relaxed against his. It had been taut all the while, as though stiffly apologising for taking Harry's space, while all the time feeling it was owed to him, anyway. It was comfortable. Harry's curiosity got the better of him. "Malfoy."
"Yeah. It exhausted me, but I got away. I didn't know where I was. Someone's back field or something. I have no idea where it was at all. Still England, I would guess, but beyond that, I don't know." Malfoy looked at his hands. "I didn't know where to go next, so I Apparated to London and started trying to find Snape. That didn't work until I actually just focused on Snape as an Apparition point and found him that way. But no one I talked to seemed to even know if he was still alive, never mind where I could find him. Not that I asked a lot of people, either. Snape was not exactly the world's most popular person back then."
"The future?" Harry repeated. "Meaning what?"
"Yes, it is."
"He never told you his name, did he?" Potter's eyes were blazing.
Bill shrugged. "Maybe he keeps odd hours, who knows?"
______________
"It's filthy, of course," Malfoy said, getting up and going to the first doorway. "I don't know very many cleaning charms, and I don't want to risk too much magic, anyway."
"What you're thinking." Harry reached for a lid of his own, carefully not looking at him.
He hadn't thought that far. "I suppose I should," Draco said. "It's pretty late."
Harry winced. "I'm not gay," he said.
"Sorry," Malfoy said again in that same tone.
"Well, we were up fairly late," Potter said, eyes glinting.
Malfoy shot him a quick, sharp look, then dropped his gaze again. "You're worried about the case in Surrey."
Potter's rising colour answered that well enough.
You. Was Malfoy going to send him off on his own? Harry hesitated. "Uh, I don't know if I could find it by myself - "
"Spare me," Pansy said, rolling her eyes. "You don't need to rub in it any more than you did then."
"I hacked into their computer system. Okay, we're here." Malfoy led the way up the long flight of steps leading up to the front doors.
"Any time." Tonks managed to get to the door without knocking over any of the chairs or bookshelves, which was not unremarkable. As she pulled the door closed behind her, she stuck her head back into the room. "Oh, and I heard about you and Malfoy. I think it's cute. No, not cute - wonderful." She beamed at him. "Congrats, Harry!"
Harry struggled. "It's not that I don't. I just wish you had a different method of dealing with it or something."
"Yes, actually." Longbottom looked surprised. "I didn't know you knew that. I'm teaching Herbology now that Pomona's retired."
Harry tried to remember what had happened. "I didn't invite him up," he said.
"You're such a bitch, darling," she said affectionately. "Of course I won't be late. See you there." She hung up.
She was so pretty. And he could see what he'd spent that wretched year that should have been his seventh waiting for. It just didn't fit what he wanted any more, and for that, he was genuinely terribly sorry. "Iâ¦ great. There's something I need to tell you," he said, and Ginny's happy expression faded.
He knew that he would know. Know, and feel terrible. But would he feel badly enough not to pursue Malfoy? He couldn't answer this. The thought of finding some other bloke to hook up with had not occurred to Harry. It was Malfoy in particular that he wanted. He had acknowledged this quietly to himself but didn't know what to make of it.
Draco approved. "No media," he said firmly. It was the best he could do, the closest he could come to admitting that there might be room for discussion about - whatever this was going to be. But he wanted it to be allowed to happen in private.
Draco would have preferred not to talk at this point, but it seemed rude to say so and the last thing he wanted was to fuck this up. "You thought I was straight?" he said, aware that his hair was dishevelled, his mouth wet with Potter's saliva. "I thought everyone knew I was gay. I thought you were straight."
"Stealth assignment, darling," Malfoy drawled. "One does what one must."
"No!" Harry said quickly. "No one sent me. I don't know why else, then. I justâ¦ I guess I have a lot of respect for you. I know I've probably never said."
He got his own hands on Malfoy, dragging him closer by one arse cheek, which tightened in a way that make his gut clench as he did so, to wrap his fist around Malfoy's cock again, and hadn't his palm memorised the feel of it already, hard against his skin and pulsing with need. Malfoy gasped, then grinned evilly back. "This is where the fun starts, Potter."
"No, I don't," Malfoy said positively. "If it was anything like that, it'd just be because Voldemort was attacking Syria in general, not because they know you're here."
__________________
"I emailed my boss," Malfoy said, "and he said that I should keep you here at least another week. I was afraid you'd be mad, so I was postponing the moment of telling you."
His hand was rubbing harder and Harry was hard-pressed to keep from making a sound when he felt the first warm drops begin to seep through his jeans. It wasn't piss, either, and he knew that Draco knew it. His hips shifted forward before he could help himself, and his forehead broke out in beads of sweat in a neat little row. "Draco - " His teeth were gritted.
"Breakfast, maybe." Lupin said levelly.
Harry nodded, resigned, and pulled himself off the doorframe. "All right," he said. "I'm going."
"Go to hell!" Ginny's voice was sharp with fire, but the fear was all too apparent.
"Thanks," Harry said.
"Malfoy?"
Harry's mouth fell open. "What? You're not making any sense to me. I'm not the one who has a problem with being here together, obviously, and I have no idea what you mean by knowing what I don't want. What? What don't I want?"
"Iâ¦ was in the club that night," Malfoy admitted. "I didn't follow you into the bathroom. I wouldn't have done that, you know."
"What?" Malfoy didn't move.
* * *
Malfoy was evidently thinking along the same lines. When Harry broke off the kiss, his lips were already moving. "Potter - " His mouth was on Harry's again, stronger, more urgent. Harry went with it, and it was about the only thing he wanted to do. Malfoy's hand got itself on his arm, then his ribcage, his mouth pressing into Harry's with a firmness that seemed a little suspect for someone who wasn't sure whether or not he was into men, but Harry didn't care. Maybe Malfoy had lied all along and just wanted to snog someone, anyone, before he snuffed it. Maybe he'd had a desperate crush on Harry for years and that was why things were always so awkward between them. Harry didn't care. It felt good, far better than it should have, maybe, but all he knew was that if they ever got out of there, he wanted to do it again. Many times. And this thought came after only about ten seconds into it now. Harry knew that, too, and still didn't care.
Draco held himself still as Harry's finger crept closer with every pass to his hole, though his thighs were clamped tightly around Draco's cock - oh, Harry knew exactly what he was doing, but it was very clear that he was the one calling the shots. Today, at least. Other days, he willingly did exactly what Draco told him, unquestioning. "I'll live," he said, fighting the need to groan as Harry chose that particular moment to slide his finger inside. It was just a tease, his other fingers and palm resting on Draco's abused skin. Harry's cock was poking into his belly, smearing pre-come over it.
Malfoy considered this. "Is that the place with the glass tiles in the sidewalk out front?"
"You absolute git," Harry said, stifling a laugh. "How long have you actually liked me?"
Potter laughed and shoved him lightly, just a push against the shoulder. "Git. I think I can say that much, at least."
"It comes in handy," Malfoy said. "How do you feel about putting your fingers in me?"
"I wasn't," Harry lied. "I'mâ¦ glad you called me, though."
"Looks like it."
"Could you feel that the wards, or whatever they were, were down?"
Potter glanced at him and looked away. "Hard," he admitted. "I could forget it, or at least let it be the past and stay there, but it's like the public won't let me move on and fade into obscurity. I never wanted people to know who I am. I was shocked when I found out that I was a wizard, let alone a famous one that people like you had been reading about their entire childhoods. I never did know how to deal with it, and now that it's all over, I still don't and I'm tired of trying. I just want to be."
A pause. "I want you to come and get me and make me leave this hellhole."
Potter glared right back. "I'll talk about whatever I want, if you're going to go undermining my job and talking to Death Eaters right outside the place where you sleep and work all year, out of my sight!" The twin spots of colour had returned to his cheeks, even as they drained from the boy's.
"They're both on my list, too!"
The next day, Harry was in the chilled sunroom in the fourth gable on the east side of the house, reading the Prophet. The entire household shared only two subscriptions, and to keep people from wandering off with the paper to their rooms or other parts of the house, they had agreed to keep both copies in the (unheated) gable where they could be read but not removed. Malfoy came in while Harry was looking longingly at flat rentals. He looked up, saw Malfoy and dropped the page he'd been holding. "Hi," he said, too fast.
They talked about the World Wars, as Harry had decided to pretend to be a World War II expert, since it was one of the very few periods of Muggle history he knew about. Malfoy pointed out that there hadn't been much choice of majors in the first place. Harry countered this by pointing out that potions and bio-chemistry were hardly exactly the same, either. "But I took NEWT-level potions by correspondence after the war," Malfoy reminded him. "I know the chemical theories behind it. Either way, I plan to be a not-very-motivated student who bores easily of talking about school, and I suggest you do the same. We're there for the beer and the women."
Harry's expression perked up. "Really? You want to? Okay. Uh, where to you want me?"
"I know!" Potter said, eyes flashing. "That's exactly what makes it so despicable, you creep!"
Harry got to his feet so that they were face-to-face. "Yeah. As in, you and me. What do you think?"
"Don't."
Harry turned back to the dishes in silent frustration, fuming.
"Apparently," Harry said sourly. "And apparently it's still my job, somehow. Who signed me up for Auror training, anyway?"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Are youâ¦ angry? I'm sorry, I didn't mean for it to end like that. Obviously."
Harry looked at him for a long moment. "I don't know," he said again, after a bit. "Can we just take it slowly and see?"
"I'm sure you would. Come on, we have a dinner date with some friends. I'm not walking all the way there, so would you be a love and call us a cab?" Malfoy's flippant flirtation was astounding. He sounded exactly like a girl. A spoiled princess, Harry amended, dutifully bearing in mind that many women did not behave this way on dates.
"Yes."
Malfoy nodded curtly. "Not a problem."
"Good night," he said firmly, lest Potter get any strange ideas.
Malfoy's face appeared, eyes narrowed as the calculating smile reappeared. "Like the show?"
Potter's smile was positively predatory. "Done."
Judy Blackwell
Harry paused, a glimmer of amusement hovering around his mouth. "I'll bear that in mind," he said dryly, and to his surprise, Malfoy flushed.
"Have you told the people on our list about this?" Malfoy asked, setting Hermione's file on top of Ron's and skimming through Lupin's.
Harry gave a hollow laugh. "Same thing as we are, I guess."
"I don't imagine that's usually an issue," Malfoy said.
Stung, Harry firmly closed his mouth. So even Lupin thought he was jumping at shadows. He should have known better. He didn't answer.
"We need to Apparate."
"What? Oh. Sorry. I wasn't waiting for anything except this thing to start playing."
Arthur grinned. "Hard to keep up with the news. Ah, sorry Draco, let me get out of your way." He moved aside and Malfoy, without a backward glance, slipped past him and out of the pantry. "Hmm. Those salt and pepper cellars could use a topping up, couldn't they?"
"If you're trying to talk to me, open the door!"
"You have to do as I tell you, Potter. Your entire assignment is to support my disguises," Malfoy said, merciless. "If I say you're playing boyfriend, you're playing boyfriend. Now take my fucking hand."
"It's my investigation."
There was something in Malfoy's face that made Harry want to kiss him again, but now that it was all over, he figured he shouldn't. He gathered himself back into his clothing, but never looked away from Malfoy. Malfoy followed his lead. "Busy tonight?"
He would have suggested a glamour, but supposedly only Aurors and Auror candidates knew how to do those, and he wasn't about to out them both. Potter's face showed similar signs of calculation, and then he nodded. "Great idea," he said. "I like it!" He pulled out his wand and indicated the alley with his chin. "Shall we?"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Harry laughed and pushed his glasses up his nose. "Tell me about it," he said. The boy was obviously Malfoy's son, so he didn't ask to confirm it. "How many have you got?"
"Because you were on opposite sides?"
Malfoy turned to him, sugar bowl in hand, and Harry considered his options. He glanced at Ron again and smiled. He could sense Seamus and Neville trading curious looks, but didn't look at them. He looked at Malfoy instead, and saw that it would be all right. He took the sugar but caught Malfoy's fingers with it, and, turning his head, kissed Malfoy on the mouth. "Thanks," he said, grinning, meaning the sugar, and felt inordinately pleased with himself.
"I hope not," Harry said. "He likes it well enough, but I'm rather hoping he tries for something a little more ambitious. He's got a lot of talents. Good Quidditch player, decent grades - although bollocks at Potions, like I was."
"Maybe."
"I wouldn't exactly put it that way," Harry said tersely. "I - "
"You planned all along to betray her," he said, his voice harder than steel.
Dolohov shrugged. "I do not know."
Harry closed the phone slowly, wondering if Malfoy was expecting him to come down or if he was coming up to Harry's office. He waited five minutes, then decided to go down.
Harry thought, Staying in a relationship I'm not sure if I like but haven't the balls to break off, and said, "Not really, I guess. Not like that."
"There's not much that's better to think about," Malfoy said, glossing over the admission on his own part.
"No. Intelligence."
"Assistant caretaker?" Draco narrowed his eyes.
Harry frowned and bit his lip. Had Malfoy really been offended? More likely he was just going out to buy some more water or something, Harry decided. The monastery provided one bottle per day, no more and no less, but of course it wasn't enough, as it and the small cups of intense, Arabic coffee were all that they drank. Another thing which Harry had been entirely new to, but he liked it. He turned back to his book. He was determined to learn how to bargain as quickly and convincingly as possible. To, if nothing else, keep up his share of the weight on this little venture. Malfoy had said nothing about when they might return so far, but Harry was finding that he was in no particular rush.
"Drink?"
Draco shifted slightly, his balls wedged up against the soft interior of Harry's upper thigh. "A bit."
Malfoy finally looked at him, swallowing painfully. "I really fucked up good, didn't I, Potter." His eyes were glazed, his face etched with pain.
He didn't sound convinced. "Are you sure?" Harry asked, rather pointedly.
Malfoy was still tense, his fingers not returning the pressure of Harry's hands. "What about your kids?"
Harry sat up carefully; he'd been sprawled out on his front. "Malfoy," he said carefully, "I didn't mean to hurt your feelings with that. I - I just sort of meant it as a joke. Because, you know - you're you, and I'm me. We've never gotten along, and here we are, getting along, mostly. I - "
The vendor indicated the pomegranates and Harry's glass, asking a question of his own. Malfoy intervened, translating, and Harry soon had a second glass of juice. Malfoy was still watching him, curious now. Harry downed half the second glass at once.
"Not really."
Harry nodded gratefully and followed Malfoy inside. "It's really early. Or really late. I'm sorry," he said.
"That's - never mind," Harry said, changing his mind and putting them on. He thanked Malfoy a third time. "You have money?"
Current legal status: Pending investigation: Ministry of Magic Special Services Dept.
The quick intake of breath told him that Harry was surprised again. "Draco - " This time, Harry did touch him, his hand closing warmly around Draco's upper arm. His other hand turned Draco's chin toward him. "You're all I want. Haven't I said that before?"
He looked at Malfoy over the top of the parchment. "Interesting," Malfoy said. "So she does have information."
Ginny looked away. "Straight answer, Harry. Were you with someone else last night?"
In answer, Harry took his chin and kissed him deliberately slowly, hands resting lightly on Malfoy's hips. Malfoy's cock was bumping his in arousal, but he responded at Harry's unhurried speed. Harry moved his fingers to Malfoy's hair and eventually stopped kissing him. "Come over here." He led Malfoy to the wall next to the fireplace.
"One would hope," Harry said, with a touch of asperity.
There was a sound outside the room. "Harry?" Ron's voice called, muffled by the closed door. "You in there? Can I come in?"
Draco turned his wand forty-five degrees to the southwest. "I have powers you do not understand," he said. "I am not dead. I am Headmaster of this school, and you must leave."
In short, he felt wretched.
Harry experienced a stabbing of unfamiliar emotion. "It's the Lloyds at Charing Cross?" he confirmed, hearing his own voice strain. "I might be able to help you there."
"So, I think that's it," Tonks said, flipping through the stiff parchment sheets a final time. "The file is all yours. I think I've got what I need from it." She tossed it on Harry's desk.
"Okay," Draco said, looking from one to another. "Where do I need to go?"
"In my bed, I hope," Harry said.
Alarmed, Harry stopped. "Do you want me to stop?"
Jealousy hit, burning a hole in his gut. "I can't believe that," Harry said. "That's so - I don't even know what to say."
"Wanker," Seamus grumbled. "You're just stalling." He put his cards down and got up. "All right, Longbottom. What do want us to do?"
"Are you getting divorced?"
Harry looked at the sheaf of parchments. "Don't tell me you had time to get that last night, or that your feed has already picked it up."
"Not at all." Malfoy advanced, picking his way through the maze toward his desk, a small copper kettle in one hand. "Excuse the mess."
"I will," Potter promised. "You can come with me to talk to him. He's usually still asleep before breakfast, but after you can come with me."
Potter took one of the apple quarters and took a bite. "What are you thinking about?" he asked.
"Quarter to five?" Harry repeated. "Er, all right. What's it about? Or can I - ?"
"Why them?"
This did not go over well. "If it's so easy, then why don't you ever make it?" Ginny asked, and without waiting for an answer, went back into the living room.
Malfoy found a row of seats and went in. "Are you going to tell her?"
"I'm sure."
Malfoy seemed to be thinking along the same lines. "I guess we need to go back," he said reluctantly.
"Hamish Reid with the Aurors, and Bernadette Smythe in Accounting, I believe," Kingsley repeated.
"What do you mean, 'what'?"
Snape glared. "I may have been younger than some when I met my demise, but I was also weakened after prolonged torture and a painful death. Furthermore, surely you realise that I would more likely become a target for the Death Eaters, should they find their way to the castle, than adequate protection for the students. No one would be safer with me than without me."
Harry cleared his throat and took the glass. "I was just thinking about my cousin."
He heard her snort. "I'll bet you left your coat on the bench, though."
Malfoy treated him to a long, hard stare. "Yeah?" It was breathier than his eyes would have given away.
"Sir? Professor Bones says that you are one of the parents in question."
Malfoy sniggered at this. "Right."
Harry considered this, watching Malfoy. "Is he, to your knowledge, Marked?" This, too, was slow, as he knew it could be a sensitive point for Malfoy. They'd been friends, once upon a time.
She stood up, twin spots of red blazing in her cheeks. "And you had no right to be having yourself an affair on me - with Draco Malfoy, of all people! Do you have any idea how humiliating this is going to be for me?"
The leader returned to the cart and resumed his position behind the goblin, including the wand to his head. "I don't suppose you want to say anything at this point."
Draco pushed the hurt down and forced himself to think about only about his son. "If you want to be, of course," he said carefully. "It may beâ¦ you may not be Sorted into the same houses, of course, and you might prefer to be friends with the boys in your own dorm. They'll be the people you have classes with and such, after all. But if the two of you still get along, then yes, of course."
"It's irredeemably. And you definitely have gay tendencies. You'll have to figure the rest out for yourself. Although, should you need to experiment any more, you know where to find me." Malfoy said, a hint of smirk returning.
Across the way, Harry met Draco's eyes. Neither of them said anything. "Just wait and see," Draco said carefully. "You never know what could happen. Just do your best. Try to get to know some people, and respect your professors."
"Good," Malfoy said again, his voice cold as steel. "Because I'd castrate you myself otherwise."
Harry jerked his hand away and shrugged himself into the robe. "What in hell's name is going on, Malfoy? Where are we, and why are we here?"
"How do you want to be?"
"What?" Harry was impressed. "Really? How did you swing that?"
Harry's cheeks grew warm again. "I can't believe I didn't realise you were following me all this time."
"That he hasn't fought in too long a time, that he's old and tired, and that he'd more likely be a target for the Death Eaters than good protection for the students. Which, to be fair," Draco added, "is valid."
"Everyone I know likes green beans except for you. Even the kids like them."
Scorpius got it abruptly. "Oh," he said. "Oh, God."
* * *
Malfoy found him in the drawing room. "What are you doing?"
"Was it in a club, then?" he asked at last, unable to suppress it.
Harry was surprised despite himself. "Oh," he said lamely. Then he recovered his poise. "What about before the Death Eaters had any prisoners? There weren't that many taken until War Year II."
"Scorpius," Draco said, "I thought I was clear: if you are having difficulties, it is my task, as your father and your Headmaster, to deal with them."
"Hey, stop that." A sudden smack forced Draco to obey, going momentarily rigid as Harry's hand came down hard. "Don't think I don't know what you're doing."
He carried the sound of their laughter and the feel of Malfoy's mouth with him into battle the next day, and the day after that, and the day after that, always counting the days until he could return to Spinner's End and to Malfoy. It might not have sounded like much to anyone else, but for Harry, it was more than enough.
"Can't wait to get your hands on me, can you?" Draco said, suppressing a shiver at Harry's tone.
"I already made myself something, is what that means," Ginny said, sounding peeved.
Ginny covered her face with both hands. "Oh, God. Don't tell me this is happening."
Harry attempted to pull himself together and sat on the edge of the bed, bringing up one of his own knees. "So what? Just because it didn't occur to me before. For all I knew, you were still a huge git."
"Yeah," Harry said, scanning the parchment. "Oh, they're getting leave tonight and coming to London. They want to meet us for drinks. They're not off until nine." He handed the note to Malfoy so that he could see the pub Ron had listed, a standard of their group's.
"Perhaps." Tonks checked the clock behind Harry. "Is it that late? I've got to get out of here."
Harry shook it warily. "Harry Potter."
Potter interrupted him before he was able to think of a decent exit line, mid-sip. "No - I didn't mean now, Malfoy. I just meant in general." He lowered the bottle and looked at Draco. "Come on. Sit down. It's kind of nice having the company."
Harry sat, watching him warily, still unsure of how things stood between them. "So, what have we got?"
He said this without any particular expression. Harry stole another look at him, but Malfoy's son had said something, drawing his father's attention. Harry watched James dangling upside down and was glad he'd put up the cushioning charm.
"I haven't yet," Harry said. "And you're not Voldemort. Are you."
Harry cleared his throat and stared at the parchment. "Come on. Let me at least get you cleared and then you can get out of here, or do whatever you want to do next."
Harry tipped the glass back and drank, glad of the reason to stall. Setting it back on the table, he suppressed a small sigh and shook his head. "I didn't know that, either."
Moody pulled something out of his file folder and handed it across the table to Draco. "Good man, Malfoy. This is an invite to the annual Minister's Ball. I don't know whether you've already been invited or not, but it's become more exclusive in recent years. Potter will be there. It might be a good place to start."
"And how," Draco agreed, his eyes narrowing in a way that Harry always considered particularly Slytherin. "And so did you, if I recall."
"Nothing. Go home," Malfoy said. He caught Harry's eye and glared. "I'm not going to drink any more. Stop thinking that."
"The hell it's not." Malfoy gave him a dirty look. "But if it will relax your saviour complex, I'll do you a favour and come out with you. But not for coffee. I need a drink."
"Nowhere," Harry said hastily. "I just wanted to tell you that I stopped by his cubicle on Monday and got him to come out for coffee with me."
"I didn't particularly want to get involved in a war on either side," Draco said, watching the tiny candle flame flicker and jump. "But it happens, and you either have to rise to the occasion or find someplace to hide."
"The Ministry?" Malfoy shook his head and pulled Harry down, wedging a leg in between Harry's back and the sofa. "I don't know. Come here." He withdrew his wand and sent a locking spell zinging toward the doors. "You're going to have to be careful," he said as Harry rearranged himself partly beside Malfoy and partly on top of him. Rough fingers carded through his hair. It felt oddly familiar, as though they'd done this many times before already. "People know what you're up to. I think you should back right off. I'll help you put the case together."
"Is that from Longbottom?" Fortescue sounded as though he were leaning forward in his frame to peer over Draco's shoulder.
Malfoy snickered again, and said, "Good." He kept his eyes on the button of Harry's jeans as he undid it. The zip was pushed out around Harry's cock, but Malfoy undid that, too, and Harry's hands bumped his as they both pushed the jeans down. The shorts were disposed of quickly, and then Harry attacked Malfoy's trousers. Malfoy was distracted, trying to get his hands on Harry's cock and get out of his clothes at the same time, and it was Harry's turn to laugh. He'd never felt this attractive to Ginny. Sex with Ginny had always been about her, about how attractive she was supposed to be to him, never the reverse. Malfoy's trousers were kicked aside and they stood facing each other, nude.
He couldn't tell Ginny. That was all there was to it. She wouldn't understand. His phone was off. She had probably already called it several times. Perhaps he should call and leave a message, but she would answer if he called. A text message to her mobile, then. He could claim the line had been busy. Harry caught his own train of thoughts and stopped short. Was he actually contemplating it? "What do you mean, stay with you?" Harry asked, endeavouring to keep the suspicion from his voice.
Harry thought about this. He thought of something else, too. He and Malfoy had been together many times now, but he had never been the one to bottom in sex, and he had never returned the favour of Malfoy's breathtaking blow jobs. Malfoy hadn't said a word about either of those things, but Harry knew that they were both aware of it. He thought of a particular conversation with Ginny, then firmly put it from his mind. "There is one thing I can promise you," he said.
Malfoy smiled distantly and shrugged. "I know I don't. Drink. Tell me what you think."
Malfoy hesitated. "All right."
In the end, it was all went down with less difficulty and prolonged searching than Harry had feared. Dolohov was at home and he was alone. There was no fight to speak of, though he certainly tried. Bound to his own kitchen chair with Malfoy's curses burning through skin and bone, the interrogation was swift. His methods were as brutal as Harry had instructed, methods that at any other point Harry would have forbidden, but he had told Malfoy to do what it took. And it worked: Harry received a full narrative of the operation, past and present. It was as bad as he had feared. Ginny herself had approached the Death Eaters through Dolohov, promising Ministry positions, prestige, and influence if they helped her to overthrow the Ministry. Malfoy asked about the numerology and got answers that Harry didn't even comprehend. The drift was that the stolen Ministry's finances were all supposedly going into funding the coup and financing the operation. Dolohov's right-hand, a shadowy, twisted man Harry only knew by the code name Phantom, had come up with the numerology spellwork and set it in place. Phantom was rumoured to be stationed in Egypt, though Dolohov himself appeared not to know his actual location. Malfoy later said that Phantom was supposedly all brain and no brawn, not someone to worry about. Dolohov narrated Ginny's ambush and death with tears of pain in his eyes; Malfoy had set his fingernails on fire. Harry then stopped pacing for the first time and went face to face with the older man. He bent over the chair, bracing himself against the back of it, his wand at Dolohov's temple, their noses inches apart.
"Keep it that way."
Draco heard this oddly impassioned speech from his normally private and very much contained son with a mixture of surprise and pride. He had not known that Scorpius was gay, nor had he had any idea that these were his true feelings for Potter's son. To his greater surprise and relief, Albus Potter stirred in his sleep. Scorpius saw it, eyes widening. "Albus?"
"Don't play stupid, Potter. You know exactly what I'm talking about. It can't happen. It wouldn't work, and he doesn't want it. So don't waste your time there." Pansy blew smoke out the corner of her mouth, her dark hair swinging into the hollows of her cheeks.
Malfoy made a derisive sound. "Looks like there's something I'm better at after all," he said. "Namely, hiding the fact that I'm harder than wood, Potter. Thanks to you."
"If you hadn't been there, I probably would have fallen, or made enough noise in trying not to that I would have been caught. I'm not usually so jittery that something like that would have startled me, but - "
Draco refused to acknowledge that he was about to do exactly that, but turned and strode from the office.
"Is he hung? I heard he was."
* * *
Malfoy wasted no breath. "You're angry about the vote." Harry said nothing, and he went on. "You really do think the Ministry still needs watching?" he asked. His voice was low and intense.
The suggestion went straight to his cock, which gave a particularly fierce throb of need. Harry endeavoured to ignore it. "Do you want me to?"
Harry opened his mouth and closed it again. Then said, "No. Not really. Angry, but not jealous."
"And you're allowed to get away with that?" Draco prodded, knowing that Potter wouldn't confess his actual profession, but enjoying the provocation regardless.
"Why're you here?"
"No. Are you done already?"
"You would turn my school into a castle of zombies," Draco said flatly. "To whom else have you spoken?"
"Thanks," Harry said awkwardly. He put the shirt on, simultaneously relieved to have something to cover himself with and feeling strange in the clinging shirt. He'd always been used to clothes that fit more loosely. And damn it, where had the self-consciousness come from? That had to stop. He looked discreetly around for a mirror.
And how exactly are you going to stop me?"
he was to be there. It appeared to be the proper way to talk to him, because once he saw Harry standing in McGonagall's old office, which she still used, he paled and started inching to the door, only for it to slam shut behind him.
"Right here, Professor Lupin", he said and walked closer, touching his arm.
He and Hermione exchanged glances. They needed to ask the order where he was. Harry felt anger rising inside of him by how the man had not stopped defiling Sirius' house even after his warning.
"He's annoying as hell and a brat with a short temper but he'd loyal and it's funny I can push his buttons so well all the time. he doesn't back out from a fight and that makes it interesting everyday. He's also good looking and can act cute", Draco snarled out between gritted teeth and finally resorted to drawing out his wand as the sneaky woman was being impossible. He hadn't wanted to do so earlier for
Harry could hardly believe his eyes as the women started talking while Lucius looked even more uncomfortable than with standing next to Harry just then.
"No need", Harry grunted out.
"I never wanted any of this, you know.. Not the fame, the awe at things that were luck - even the.. defeat.. of Voldemort was because you disarmed Dumbledore and I disarmed you at the Manor. His wand was mine and so I won. Luck", a grave voice Draco had never heard from the boy he thought he knew on some level made him calm down and look at him seriously.
âNoâ, he bit out.
the best of us. But I still vouch for fortifying the school and going with experienced pairs - that's what Aurors do, too."
me?" Harry asked incredulously, not even knowing such a thing was possible.
Harry nodded, before turning to Narcissa to avoid a tense moment between the families known to not regard each other nicely.
Draco rounded a corner to the left only to hear something bump into him from behind. Wand ready, he turned only to see green eyes staring at him in surprise and.. a flicker of hurt flashed there. Neither had time to process that, though, because a hex flew straight at them and Draco flicked his wrist to counter it while Potter sent an answering hex its way.
"Sorry 'Mione. I've been a bit off, lately. I love you, too", he said, trying to fix what his almost accusation had tore open. Hermione only smiled and set her hand on his shoulder.
"Mmm-mm.. I won't", Draco muttered and saw a little twist of a lip from his peripheral vision on Potter's mouth. Then they just.. were there, side by side, both missing things far too sad to actually voice, yet anyway.
"So you're making me scream soon?" Harry asked mischievously and played with the buttons of Draco's shirt.
"So we'll just have to do as always. You could stop being so stuck up Potter", Malfoy complained, but opened his zipper and got himself out and close to Harry's erection in his other hand.
"That Hermione went and spied on two boys doing naughty together before ickle Ronniekins had time to mature her up?"
Snape was among the few, the only one really, who could take that nefarious red gaze for minutes and still not flinch.
"You stupid boy, why did you do that? Our situation is grave as it is - you could have gotten us all killed."
Was his short reply. Harry smiled at the galleon and wondered how Malfoy'd done it - caused him to smile despite it all.
have worked, if not..
"Oh? So Saint Potter's got trouble in paradise? Who would have thought?" Malfoy tried to sneer, but the bite just.. wasn't there. Hermione got the feeling the boys found some kind of odd comfort in each other - not that they'd ever admit it.
Potter didn't seem to think the same. He definitely thought Draco was hysteric or perhaps crazy - or both, who knew?
"I did it", he sobbed in his mother's loving embrace, "I did it, I got us free."
Hid under Potter's cloak, barely, they listened as
raised his wand in that leisure movement,
"Insuffe-" "rable git, yeah I know by now. And you're still acting cute", Draco spoke over the dark haired wizard and decided to conjure some blankets too. Potter was still being all gruff and angry, but relented and sat opposite him snatching one of the blankets before Draco could even touch it. He raised a single eyebrow at the boy.
It was however a relatively simple room: a bed, wardrobe, door to a bathroom and a living room set, all in colors of black and red.
"Made you scream", Draco said in between pants and pushes into Harry, hitting that spot repeatedly after finding it, making the pleasure rise like a tide and taking Harry within so easily it almost scared him.
