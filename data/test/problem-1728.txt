As soon as he came in, the class went silent, Draco noticing that Harry still hadn't come yet, most likely still looking for his homework that lay comfortably on Draco's desk. Merlin, that boy was easy to distract, it was a surprise he had even gotten this far.
She paused, as if Harry could say something back, before she let out a chilling laugh. "You're nothing but a half blood, not even fully pure." She moved closer to him, poking his cheek harshly. "How should we sort this out then? Maybe we should do it the muggle way. You did have a muggle mother didn't you?" Pansy then covered her mouth with her hand, pretending like she'd revealed something by accident. "Oh, silly me, I forgot she died before she could even teach you any of her special muggle mannerisms. Good riddance, I suppose, though bad luck for you. Stuck with a different family of muggles."
, and your hair, what products do you use? I'd love to run my hands through your hair all day if I could." In the middle of speaking, Harry had started to poke Draco's flushed cheeks whilst Draco stood still.
"Yes you are." And to prove this, Harry placed his hands on Draco's normally cold cheeks that were now warm. "Blushing."
Harry started to slowly move his lower half against Draco's, which reminded Draco of a night that he couldn't explicitly remember, but when Harry began to take Draco's shirt off, he no longer wanted, or cared, to remember what had happened that night. Harry pulled away, trailing his fingers down Draco's chest, sending shivers through his spine.
"Views on what? He's talked a bit about how they're strict and stuff, but only because they love him, he claims."
"Don't you have quidditch practise tonight?" The words slipped out before Draco could stop himself. He realised he had just half exposed the fact that he had noted every house's practise time in his head.
And as Snape loured at the two of them, neither of them even noticed the scolding he was giving to the both of them, Draco seeing Harry trying his best to cover his smile, failing horribly leading to Snape taking off another five points from Gryffindor for Harry's discourtesy.
"Just saw your boyfriend." Pansy came up from behind Draco, wiping away his theories on why Harry had seemed so distant.
Draco's mood had completely flipped from the caring side Harry had just seen a few seconds ago back to the reserved one he knew so well. Harry didn't know this, since he so unfortunately wasn't inside Draco's brain, but Draco was still seething at whoever had thought they could even lay a hand on Harry's face. Harry didn't even seem too affected which irritated him more. (Typical life of a chosen one, Draco supposed.)
He couldn't just let his father down like that, after everything his father had done for him, this is how he repaid him: by being weak and being gay for none other than the Boy-Who-Lived.
." Harry corrected, but Draco carried on muttering something to do with the word 'lovers' that Harry couldn't quite hear. "Anyways–" He deliberately raised his voice over Draco's, cutting off Draco's conversation to himself. "I'm glad it happened."
"I- Er I didn't exactly think about that." Harry admitted. He had already thrown his feelings out into the air and it was clear Draco had the power here; Harry was just his puppet, waiting for the next move.
Harry's stoic face finally broke away as he chuckled at Draco's excitement. "Stop laughing." Draco ordered, but he didn't mean it; Harry's laugh was refreshing.
Why couldn't he have liked kissing someone who was kind, not actively out to get him? Someone who didn't steal his homework on purpose or hold a grudge against him because he didn't accept a handshake from when they were eleven.
Harry still risked a glance to the Slytherin table again to see Draco with his jaw clenched as he glowered at Harry. Seeing Harry looking at him, he got up, and practically stormed out of the hall, attracting heads to turn and stare at him.
"Miss Granger and Mr Weasley, out now. You'll see your friend later." Snape's voice was stern, not turning around to face them.
"Take it as you want." He simply replied, communicating for Harry to continue speaking. To elaborate on what he meant by needing help.
"Ugh for fuck's- I don't know Malfoy, what do you even bloody want? A snake or something? Or maybe a handshake would better satisfy you?" Harry snapped. He was just fed up. (He'd even rather be back where he was before, attempting to kiss Hermione.)
in the original fic, this chapter is called hair gel but I changed quite a lot so of course, the name had to change too. anyways, enjoy reading!
Draco had never really seen Harry as the most judgemental person in his life (there were many more higher on the list) but in that moment right there, he felt like the judgment could crush him. "You know what, forget I said anything. I'll see you tomorrow." Draco turned around, ready to leave in mortification, but he felt a hand on his arm, stopping him. "No, wait." Harry realised how he'd sounded- rejecting Draco. "Let's go then." Harry smiled, Draco also turning back around to hide his own smile. "Okay."
He had to stop, or all he would get at the end of this was a boner, so he instead brought up some more innocent topics. "I could really do with a shower right now... and maybe some treacle tart. Actually, definitely some treacle tart." And when he got no response from Draco, he carried on speaking. "Do you think my team's wondering where I've gone? I didn't tell Hermione or Ron but I'm sure– OH, Ginny! Did you see when she hugged me?"
"It's nothing. I'm completely fine." Draco so-obviously-lied, Harry nearly snorting at how bad it was.
A few first years nearly bumped into Draco, giggling, but when Draco took out his anger on them, telling them that if they ever walked into him again, he would cast a stinging jinx on them, they instantly ran away from him, one of them looking on the verge of tears.
"Is your father a part of your dating life?" When Draco didn't reply straight away with a 'No', Harry knew his question hadn't been interpreted correctly.
Draco had an urge to touch Harry's hair; just once would be enough, so he slowly ran his fingers through Harry's hair, making sure that Harry didn't wake up. What would he say then? 'My hands accidentally slipped and ended up in your hair.' Even someone as dense as Harry wouldn't believe that for a second. Yet these thoughts didn't stop Draco who let his fingers gently slide down Harry's cheeks, stopping at his plump lips. Draco pushed the temptation to just kiss Harry senselessly, give him those unlimited kisses that he had promised, but as soon as that thought ran through his mind, he automatically felt dirty at himself, snatching his hand away from Harry's face too abruptly that Harry's eyes started to flutter open.
Harry's smile dropped as he realised Hermione was serious. "I was joking Hermione. You're not actually going to ask him, are you?" Harry felt his palms clam up thinking of Hermione confronting Draco.
"No, you're only friends with him, he thinks the world of you and you know that." Her unsettlingly deep brown eyes stared right into his soul, trying to uncover all the secrets that he had pushed to the back of his mind.
But now Draco had done something wrong and this was not the time for Hermione to dwell on how blind sighted she had been, so obsessed with her exams that she had turned a blind eye to her own best friend's love life. The rage came back in Hermione's eyes as she realised that Draco had messed up badly for Harry to be this upset. "What did that bloody punk do now?"
Is what was ringing in Draco's head as he explained the incident so collectedly. It had been completely natural for Harry's name to just come out as
Harry walked back by himself from Madam Pomfrey, heading to his room. He was still suffocating in the shame of today's events and had lied to Madam Pomfrey saying he still felt a bit woozy, blaming it on the antidote's aftereffects.
Perhaps it had been building up for weeks now, or the hug had triggered it, but Draco didn't want to resist this
Hermione glanced up, sending someone's gaze on her and catching Draco's eyes. She gave him a death glare, hoping that would translate as
When they finally got to Draco's room, Draco immediately split from Harry, almost starting to sweat at how close together they'd been whilst Harry went straight to Draco's bed, flopping onto his stomach. "Your bed is so comfy."
Ron actually looked offended, going on a rant about why he should've been Harry's first 'boy crush' not moody Malfoy, and Hermione disproving Ron's claims whilst Harry was still thinking about his wand.
But Draco was bored, and was trying to stir up an argument that just wasn't happening. "You look ugly."
They had somehow found a way to roll over onto the grass with Draco on top and Harry underneath him. The same warmth that came every time they kissed ignited in Draco's chest and he knew that it was a feeling he'd never, and didn't want to, ever get used to. Draco should've been more worried about who could've walked past and seen them, yet he was more concentrated on the hands gently tugging his hair, he should've been more worried about how, or if, their relationship could even grow, yet he was more focussed on the soft, pillowy lips moving against his.
She turned her attention back to Harry, looking down at his slightly out of place knee, and gave her wand a few flicks, saying something along the lines of
"Yes, yes, you don't like boys, I've heard a thousand times yet here you are, holding my hand." Harry didn't know where all that confidence had come from but it felt good to get it out and surprisingly, Draco still didn't let go of Harry's hand.
"Is this still about Jack? Because if it is, I swear I didn't mean that I'd actually be angry at you."
"Miss Granger has enough responsibilities." Snape's answer was firm. "Potter's grades must improve before the next Potion's exam. Repeat everything I said to him as soon as you can." Snape walked away, once again giving no time for Draco to respond, or protest, even though he wouldn't have been able to either way.
Draco wanted to laugh at the irony of the Chosen One asking him to help with flirting skills but Harry's look was sincere, also being very ashamed.
"And as for you Malfoy." She turned to him, pointing her wand at him to do a spell and check for injuries. "You seem to have come out unscathed."
He would never truly admit it, but as much as he could say he didn't want to see Draco ever again, it wouldn't feel the same without his constant ridicules. However, as Harry got closer and closer, his embarrassment, and temporary kindness for Draco, had started to switch to anger, remembering the events that had led up to him drugging himself.
"It's not fine." Draco walked up to Harry, frowning when Harry took a step back away from him. "What the fuck happened?"
when number one, you and I-" Draco pointed between the two of them. " - are basically enemies and number two, I am a boy if you have not noticed, unless the Chosen one is a fairy."
"Maybe he's thinking of ways to hex you?" Ron gave his input, but it sounded more like "Mwaybe ees tinking of weys to ex yu?" due to the food in his mouth.
Or the other way around, depending on the angle, and on who would be the one telling the story of this day.
"I know you're looking for Harry." Hermione's voice scared him as he turned to the side, looking at her slightly disappointed expression.
Neither boy knew how long the tranquillity lasted for, but it was weird for Draco. He'd never known Harry to not want to pop in a word or two at random times. "Potter, are you still awake?" He knew Harry was, but if this question would trigger Harry's voice, he was up for asking it.
Harry still stayed against the wall, his uniform now a mess and his cheeks rosy, "That was unexpected." He stated the obvious, seeming unaffected in Draco's eyes whilst actually panicking on the inside.
But when he started to grin at Harry's feeble attempts to protest the reduction of points, Draco knew Harry had been completely right in his saying:
Harry was listening intently to Ginny when he felt a stare on him, looking across the hall to see it was none other than Draco. With their 'budding' friendship, Harry had expected a bit more support from Draco at the fact he was talking to his crush, but instead, he got a glare.
"Full of questions today, aren't you?" Draco spoke under his breath. "I called Potter four times and you didn't answer."
"Singing?" Harry frowned, his brows furrowing. "Oh, just now?" Draco nodded. "Just some muggle song." Harry seemed surprised at the question and paused, maybe expecting Draco to say something about muggle music, but he didn't, so Harry carried on. "I heard it on my cousin's radio–"
Draco rolled his eyes, carrying on walking. "No surprise there that you're friends with second year muggles."
Draco and Harry immediately separated from each other like their bodies had been on fire, needing to get away from each other as quick as they could. Draco rapidly flung on his shirt whilst Harry adjusted his glasses, (and his trousers), wild thoughts running through both of their minds.
That was probably the closest Harry would get, and the closest Draco would allow him to. "You could say that." Draco turned away and collected the books he needed, signalling for Harry to drop the topic. Harry was still curious but he -sometimes- knew when to stop and pulled his own stuff out as well.
He didn't exactly expect, or want, anybody to be up there. Harry and him had moved their 'kissing tips' to when they had the tutoring, so there had been no reason for them to meet up at night.
Harry should have looked away, maybe it would've been easier to say no, but then Draco was placing soft kisses on his jaw, getting closer and closer to Harry's mouth, grazing the corner of his lips. "Only five." Draco whispered, his hand sneaking down into Harry's lap.
"I went back to Madam Pomfrey, but I'm feeling fine now." Harry could see in Hermione's face that she was hesitating to bring up what had happened yesterday so Harry quickly changed the subject. "Where's Ron then?" Another hangry Ron was not what either of them needed, or wanted, this morning.
"Yeah." I agreed with her half-heartedly. If Ginny was the way to get Hermione off my back, then I would follow it gladly. This thing with Malfoy... I needed to fully come to terms with it myself before having a curious Hermione hitting me with question after question.
"I'm not stupid Malfoy, I know you don't want that either. I see the way you talk with him, I've never seen you so at ease before and I'm not saying you're my first choice on who I'd want Harry to be with, but if you make Harry happy, then I'm not gonna stop him. Just don't ever hurt him."
Harry kicked out the thoughts of him being horny for Draco's hand and did what he was meant to do from the beginning: Pass his essay to Draco. As Draco read, or skimmed, through Harry's essay on the properties of the ingredient Moonstone, Harry could already tell what Draco was going to say: it was–
, not moonstone, then you began listing the properties of something that's not even closely related to moonstone. Then the part you
Unlike last time in his bed, Harry woke up quicker, wiping his eyes with his hands before squinting at Draco. "Malfoy?"
But what he hadn't planned was for the conversation to turn to him. "What's that on your neck?" Ron was the one to question him this time.
Harry didn't want to lose a friend just because of his unreciprocated feelings. Draco was nice to talk to, someone to toughen him up and give him the bluntness he needed, but Harry was still confused with what had happened last week. Was Hermione right about something happening at the Malfoy Manor? "But you still... like me?" Draco's hesitance was clear in his voice.
"Wow. Maybe I can actually do decent in these exams now–" Harry pretended to wipe the non-existent sweat off of his forehead.
After the game, he would try and confront Harry, find out why he was ignoring him and why he was stressed, Draco decided as he walked back to his common room, filled with thoughts of Harry.
Draco was out before you could even say the word 'go', as Harry did a slight jog to catch up with him. "Where you running off to?"
Draco silently agreed then suddenly remembered what Snape's message to him had been. "I have to tutor you. Snape says your grades aren't sufficient enough for the O.W.L. Exams."
Draco chuckled, "Maybe you should recommend Snape some books, might loosen him up." He spoke, before confidently striding into the classroom whilst a less eager Harry followed behind him sluggishly.
"I should go." Harry turned to leave, but without even thinking, Draco stopped him, placing his hand on Harry's shoulder. He quickly moved his hand away from Harry's shoulder to his chin, forcing Harry to look into his eyes.
"Where'd you learn how to do that?" The words came out before Harry could properly think them through.
didn't reply at first, trying to grab time for his hormones to stop running wild and not speaking in fear that his voice would come out very breathy and desperate, so he took a few seconds to attempt to get his breathing back to normal before murmuring a small 'okay', despite it not being okay; his cheeks were on fire and there was no way they'd be able to cool down with Harry this close to him. As if that wasn't enough, he felt Harry's warm hand slide underneath his shirt, meeting his skin that was still burning from Harry's simple touch. Perhaps Harry could feel how hot he was, but he didn't say anything, all Draco heard come out of Harry's mouth was a simple sigh of relief, the warm air fanning Draco's neck.
Draco remembered the note from his father and his mood automatically darkened, Harry spotting it right away. Draco picked up his wand and pointed it towards the door, muttering a small
Draco, the boy who had wanted to make Harry's life a living hell since the day he rejected a handshake.
Draco let out the breath he'd been holding yet as soon as he registered that he was feeling relief at Harry's words, he didn't feel too good afterwards; why was he happy that Harry still had a one way crush on him?
Draco's mouth opened and shut a few times, nothing coming out until he saw Hermione arching a brow, waiting for his reply. "I'm not gay and I don't like Harry."
Harry sheepishly shrugged off the cloak, noticing that Draco didn't make any move to turn around, increasing his confusion even more. "How did you know it was me?"
He couldn't remember much, but his legs had definitely not been quick enough to make it outside before giving up on him... and there was someone else with him.
Harry thanked the heavens for Ron's unconscious distraction that he had given him and still, even whilst on the brink of having his secret exposed, Harry looked over to the Slytherin table whilst Hermione was busy trying to reassure Ron that she had simply noticed it by accident.
." If Draco had known to get Harry angry all he had to do was say his first name, that would've been the first thing he would've done when they were younger.
"Whatever you say Malfoy." With that, she dramatically strutted away, a small hope in her that Draco would follow after her, but he never did.
Draco gave a stiff nod and the-slightly tensed-silence resumed. Draco stayed silent but Harry was humming quietly to himself, using his fingers to play a mini game that he had been taught by Jack... Oh! Jack. "You know Jack?"
He nodded his head, all his thoughts on Draco. Hermione could sense this and put her arm around his shoulder, pulling him in so his head was against her chest, breathing in her sweet scent. Harry gladly accepted the comforting for at least he knew Hermione was still there, and that he would do anything to not lose her too.
They both shared a look, but Hermione still summarised what they had said which now made sense of why they had looked confused when he had said yes. "Oh yeah, that wouldn't be right." He agreed with them, feeling satisfied when they both nodded, moving on to another topic that Harry still wasn't paying full attention to, but enough that if they asked him a question, he'd be able to actually answer.
Draco let out a bitter chuckle, shaking his head. "Ironic huh? I'm the most selfish person I know, I don't think I need to 'take care of myself first'. "
It was pure torture for Draco who didn't know whether he wanted to run as far away from Harry as he could or figuratively attach Harry to his side so that he'd never leave him, but whichever option he chose, it all left him with the result that being friends with Harry was much harder then he'd like to admit.
Draco scoffed; Harry never knew when to stop. "Unlike you, I don't make a list of all the people I kiss and rank them."
And when he did finally come back to consciousness, he immediately noted a natural light shining over him, a bit of a breeze rumpling his clothes.
His neck? Harry dumbly tried to look down, unable to see what Ron was talking about. What would be on his ne–
Draco was quiet for a few seconds, taking in what Snape had said, before questioning him. "How about Grang- Hermione?" That would surely be an easier option for both Harry and himself.
Well, not literally, but compared to when Harry would practically follow him around whenever he could, he hadn't seen Harry for a few days, even in lessons.
It was Pansy's voice that reminded him that he had really done that. "Looks like the Golden boy likes you." Her tone was taunting, but not towards him, yet he felt rage towards it.
"But–" Thank Merlin. "We both agreed that we're better off as friends, I guess I had just mistaken my crush for something bigger, and anyways I think I like–" Harry stopped suddenly, glancing down at the floor.
"You were so great out there, well done!" She complimented, giving him a hug. Harry was sure he was sweaty, but Ginny didn't seem to notice, or if she did, she just didn't mind.
Hermione stayed quiet, staring at me intensely as if she was casting Legilimency on me which I prayed she couldn't do. "What's on your mind? Maybe I can help." She kindly offered, but just like yesterday, there was nothing Hermione could do to help me.
"I have a grave feeling you've messed up already." Harry looked up to see Draco, and instead of noticing the way Draco's previous confidence seemed to have deteriorated or being ready to prove to Draco how well he had done the potion by himself, he found himself falling hard for him.
Harry paused for so long that Draco was almost about to stand up and shake the words out of him until Harry blurted out, "I fucking like you Draco."
Many names popped out in the darkness but one stuck out the most and almost straight away, he got up. "Oh Merlin Hermione, you're a life saver." He gave her a quick hug, catching her so off guard that she was unable to do anything but let her arms hang to the side and as soon as the hug began, it was already over. "Sorry about before." Was the last thing Harry said to her before he disappeared under the invincibility cloak.
.) This was an official coming out, so he was a bit nervous to say the words out loud. Hermione could sense Harry's hesitance and gave him an encouraging nod, telling him to go on. He took a deep breath then let the words flow out. "I'm bisexual."
I nodded my head in agreement, Ron seeming to be satisfied by that answer, when the image of Malfoy winking came into my head causing me to choke on the food I hadn't even began to eat.
Draco froze, feeling Harry's arms wrap around him; he felt how Harry had felt when he had ambushed him with the kiss from weeks ago. Harry pulled away quickly though, looking into Draco's eyes.
It clicked for Harry, or at least he thought it had clicked for him. "Do you injure yourself a lot?"
"Can we... can we try again?" Harry plucked up the courage, hearing 'bloody Gryffindors... always brave' but ignored it, assuming Draco hadn't wanted him to hear it.
Draco had to cover up the smile that fought to appear on his face, settling for an arch of his brow.
"And it didn't look like a glare." She continued, eyeing Harry as if trying to scare him into spilling what was happening. "Are you two friends now? Because of your tutoring sessions? Malfoy barely spares a glare for you anymore."
The seat next to Hermione was empty, where Harry usually sat, but it wasn't surprising to not see him there. Hermione, mistaking Draco for looking at her, glared at him before opening her book. Draco rolled his eyes at the try hard but went and sat down next to Blaise, waiting for Professor Snape to come.
"Merlin Harry, are you okay?" She extended out a hand that he gladly took, standing up and nodding back at her, leaning on one leg slightly. "I can take you to Madam Pomfr–" She had started to offer when Draco came from behind Harry, grabbing his arm.
"What do you think?" Draco tilted his head to the side, a movement that clearly said 'of course he was joking'.
Hermione felt even worse for Harry who was chewing on his lip harshly, almost drawing out blood. "Well how about we start from the beginning?" She suggested.
The feeling of relief washed over Harry's body, holding the snitch in his hands. It was like a huge weight had been swept off of his shoulders and when he turned to look at the blond boy, it seemed as if he was suddenly fixated at the sight of his broom.
The sound of his name coming out from Hermione's mouth snapped Harry back into reality as he came face to face with a sighing Hermione and a confused Ron.
"Merlin Harry, can't you get one thing right?" Draco didn't even believe the words pouring out of his mouth but he just really wanted Harry to snap, yell at him, anything, but all Harry did was a twitch of his brows before his neutral expression came back.
It was just that every time he looked up at Draco, the memories of last night (or morning) would rush down to his groin, leaving him in a very uncomfortable position.
Harry was momentarily stunned by the Slytherin boy who was sitting down, but quickly remembered why he had practically stormed up all the way here. "No, definitely not, and I'm being civil here by apologising for how I practically er- molested you, I really wasn't in my right mind so sorry about that.”
Harry's anger had been stored up, but was now ready for release, so when he got to the top of the astronomy tower, he wasn't ready to even wait a second before letting it all out.
It just vexed him more that Hermione was right. Obviously it was his father, it always was. Draco needed something, or someone, to just release his frustration out on, yet the person he really wanted to talk to wasn't there, and it just enraged him even more.
"Me." Draco muttered quietly, stepping around Harry to sit down, his back against the tree whilst looking to the side at the school's building.
Hermione and Ron gave one last look to Harry but he didn't even spare a glance at them as they walked out.
her face into my neck, she thought she saw a bruise on it, and technically, that was your fault." Harry defended, folding his arms.
Draco pulled out the note from his pocket again, thinking about how his father would react to know that a boy, not just any boy, but Harry Potter, was sleeping in his bed.
"Is it your turn to interrogate me?" Harry joked, stalling to think of an excuse. As usual, Ron was able to easily brush away his suspicions and laugh, but stopped when Hermione gave him a glare.
"Leave me alone Granger, you know nothing." Draco walked off, not surprised at all that Hermione didn't follow him after his little temper tantrum.
"Yeah, it's just weird." Draco replied back, decidedly stopping trying to discover what Harry was hiding for now. "Harry, Harry, Harry, how does it sound?" Draco looked towards Harry to see him biting roughly down on his lower lip, the redness being sucked away.
"Shut up Potter." Draco tried to peek to see if Snape was watching them but Harry turned Draco's face back to his, his pupils dilated. Harry leaned in, focussed on Draco's lips but Draco tried his best to pull away, backing into a desk; he was not going to kiss an infatuated Harry, especially with Snape standing less than 5 feet away from them. "Please, just one, I promise." Harry pleaded.
"Oh look at this. I've got..." Harry stopped, pointing to the classroom, about to say something about the two of them splitting up now when he realised that they were at... "Potions." He grumbled.
other girls. His hand went to her waist and his body was against hers... but it wasn't the same feeling as that one boy's torso against his.
Harry started to show that cheeky smile of his, glancing back up at Draco, stirring some kind of worry in Draco. "You scared that I'll stop giving you my utmost attention? Or that I'll stop loving someone like you?" Harry joked, but then Draco's face went completely blank, his mouth slightly ajar. "What? I was just kidding."
"The, you know– Er... the beetles?" Harry guessed hopelessly, knowing he'd failed horribly when Draco lightly smacked his own forehead. "I am listening, I swear I was just... thinking."
Harry, taking this as a sign of rejection, looked down at the ground. "Sorry, I don't even know why I–"
It had been even worse when Harry had managed to actually get an Exceeding Expectations in the Potions exam despite Snape's disinclination to believe that Harry hadn't cheated and had practically jumped into Draco's arms right there and then, though they were lucky that people were more occupied with their own grades to work out if Harry had drugged himself with a love potion again. Harry had pulled back with a grin on his face, looking deep into Draco's eyes, as if he could sense what Draco was thinking, and if it weren't for Harry pulling away first, Draco was sure he would've done something that he would still be regretting, yet the thought of
His hands started to become clammy as he gripped onto his broom tighter, scouring his surroundings to see if there were any traces of the golden snitch. He could see Draco near him, sporting a sour look, most likely from the vexatious commentary that had been going on for the whole game.
"Nobod- Nothing. Shit." Harry cursed, realising he'd just exposed himself. If only Draco could be unobservant and simply move on, but no, Draco immediately noted what Harry was saying.
The conversation had come to a comfortable end, and Draco actually felt satisfied that he had managed to get on Harry's good side again.
If he were to ask Hermione, she'd be more occupied on who the boy was that had alerted Harry to start questioning his own sexuality and he was definitely not ready to talk to her about the Malfoy plan. Ron on the other hand... well, Ron would be Ron: he'd probably ask if Harry had a crush on him.
bed, but he didn't seem to care as much with Harry, and simply sat down, leaning against the chair opposite his bed.
this was a very slow update so apologies for that but i’m hoping there’s no mistakes so enjoy this last chapter full of rollercoasters :) thank you for reading!
Harry was more prepared for Hermione's questions this time and tried his best to do a relaxed shrug. "Nobody, just thought I saw something weird."
As if he sensed my stare, his head turned towards me, ice grey eyes meeting mine, his smile leaving straight away. A frown formed before quickly turning into a smirk... then he winked.
Draco felt disappointed at the emptiness in Harry's voice and tried again. "What are you thinking about?"
Harry could easily twist his head to the side, tell Draco that they couldn't do this, but then it was too late; his lips were on Draco's, and for the fifth time– not as if Harry was counting– Harry was kissing Draco, and Draco was kissing him back.
Pansy recovered quickly, acting like she hadn't just been hurt by his words. "Potter... and you agreed to tutor him?" She eyed him as if he had a whole say on the matter.
A pleasant silence settled between the two of them before Harry, of course, decided to speak again. "I've been thinking and... I don't think I like Ginny anymore."
Merlin, Harry knew it wasn't his best piece of work, at all, but Draco was being just a tad bit dramatic. Harry snatched the parchment from Draco, reading the first lines and being instantly taken back to when he wrote this the week before... on a week day... at midnight... after having just done Quidditch.
It took Draco a few seconds but when he got it, he felt the corners of his lips slightly extend upwards. "Very funny Potter."
"And you're a Gryffindor. Are we just naming salient things that we already know or-?" Draco riled Harry on, laughing internally at the way Harry's eyes squinted at him, as if he couldn't believe Draco had to have a second thought on who he would pick between Harry and Jack.
Bloody hell, Granger, if only she knew how not innocent that sounded, Draco thought to himself. He supressed the laugh that threatened to come out and nodded. "There's nothing going on between Potter and I."
"At least you've told him, gotten it all off of your chest." Hermione was still trying to encourage him, lighten up the mood, having seen Harry's withdrawal to conversations for the past week.
." Draco mumbled, imitating Harry's voice terribly, still looking away from Harry since if he was looking at him, Harry would've seen the eye roll from Draco and been even more aggravated.
Yet all his thoughts were once again knocked down by Hermione speaking... When had they finished arguing?
"Oh, yeah uh–" Harry paused, looking for the right words. He knew Ron would be supportive–hopefully– but he was the first person Harry was coming out to. (Hermione didn't count since she had just had to infer from the fact that he said
Draco headed to his common room, knowing he had a free coming up, expecting to have peace and quiet there.
For once, Harry didn't hear that same bullshit of 'but I don't like boys' and moved so he now sat opposite Draco. "I'll ask you a few questions and you have to answer truthfully."
The first instinct for Harry was to freeze, becoming a still statue. Draco assumed it was the shock at first, but when a few seconds passed, and Harry still wasn't making any moves, Draco pulled away. "Wow Potter, you really are that shit at kissing."
Ron didn't catch Harry's cue for him to stop talking about what had happened and carried on, "Malfoy's a little git. We'll get him back."
Draco shook his head in disbelief at the brown haired boy, wondering if he had somehow been drugged with a love potion. He was tempted to pull out his wand but resisted the desire to, and stayed with his hands by his side, his fingers itching to pull his wand out in the case of an emergency.
Draco noticed Harry's restlessness, glancing towards the Great Hall before looking back at Draco, fidgeting with his hands. "Merlin Potter, how much sugar have you had today?" Draco stalled.
As if thinking of his name summoned the movement, Draco peered up to see his door opening, but there was nobody there, except for those well known clunky footsteps.
"Him?" Hermione herself could admit that wasn't the best response, but even her, one of the smartest people in the year, could admit that Harry had just revealed a lot.
"Say something... please." Harry pleaded quietly. He hadn't wanted the urgency to come out in his voice yet it had.
"You shouldn't swear on anything." Draco lightly reprimanded him, but nevertheless went and sat next to Harry whose smile grew.
"Unless you want more." Harry winked, most definitely as a joke, but it sure made Draco splutter on his words. "I– No, I didn't mean... well, y-you're... Uh, no?"
Draco looked at the way Harry seemed so at peace, feeling this need to protect him from any dangers that would try to come for him, but what if he was the danger he was so worried about? But then he remembered Harry's words: 'You're not evil.' And he had seemed so sincere though he knew nothing of what Draco had done.
There were no good reasons that Harry could give to convince the Slytherin. Even he, a Gryffindor, would be entirely confused if Draco one day came strolling up to him and asked for a kiss.
He felt someone's stare on him and turned around to see Pansy glaring directly at him. He gulped, instantly turning his head back around and not looking at her again.
He hadn't heard one thing they had said, their conversations always seemed to zoom straight past his ears these days. Their faces were still expectant, waiting for an answer that Harry didn't have. "Uh– yes?" Ron and Hermione's heads both tilted to the side slightly, which would've been a bit creepy if it weren't for the fact that he had definitely not answered rightly. "What did you say?"
Apparently the offer for the two of them to be civil had been conditional; the condition being that they both had to only see each other in a friendly way, but Harry had broken the terms by admitting his feelings for Draco.
, and he had completely forgotten (again) that they were back to surname basis. Normally, before the
"No, you know–" Harry looked serious but on seeing the smirk on Draco's face, he rolled his eyes. "You're such a smart arse." Which would've prompted Draco to say
However, when he saw Harry sitting- or rather sleeping- against the wall, half of his body invisible, most likely by the invisibility cloak slipping down, he didn't feel the annoyance he thought he would've. He so easily could have left, found somewhere else to go, but he could always blame it on his ego; this was his spot, he had come here regularly before Harry, but he knew that wasn't the only reason he stayed.
Only he should be able to make fun of Harry like that, Pansy had no right, but then his father's face popped into his mind–how his expression had lit up finding out that a death eater who had been seen in the bed of another man had been crucio'd until his painful death, '
Draco didn't know why, but he reached his arm out, his hand ruffling Harry's hair, seeing the smile Harry was trying to fight appear, "No you don't."
Malfoy didn't seem to move any more, so Harry, thankfully, presumed that he was still sleeping, despite the moan of Harry's name, and tried to unwrap his arms from Malfoy.
Pansy didn't stop there though. "And you call yourself smart." She muttered, but deliberately loud enough for Draco to hear.
Maybe it was the ego, he blamed, that's why it felt nice to have that type of genuine attention from a person. (No other reasons)
"Yeah, course." Harry nodded, a polite smile on his face as Jack went to leave, but as soon as Jack had turned his back, Harry's smile disappeared scarily quick. "What do you need?"
Hermione nodded and sat down next to Ron who had come early, claiming he was feeling especially eager today.
Why should he, Draco Malfoy, be jealous of some ginger that was sitting with Harry? It's not like Harry and him were even close friends, though he was sure friends didn't get jealous over friends making new ones.
Draco gave the tiniest of a shrug before walking off. He spotted Pansy there and knew what he had to do, stalking up to her. "Can I kiss you?"
for the sake of this book, the love potion works by if u drink or taste it, the first person u look at is who u fall in love with unlike the og plot where it has to be received by the person for u to fall in love with them :)
"Yeah, yeah." Harry mumbled, rewriting the method.  He could feel Draco's stare on him as he wrote, slightly putting him off, feeling a bit self conscious. "Stop staring at me."
"Friends again?" Harry held his hand out to which Draco stared at it before swallowing down his doubts on their friendship and shaking Harry's hand. "Yes, friends."
A few weeks later, Draco and Harry's tutoring sessions had been going strong, despite the awkwardness they had to overcome every time they met, both of their minds going back to after that quidditch match.
Harry felt like his head was spinning, Draco and Snape's voice attacking him from all corners as his legs started to feel like jelly.
"Twenty extra points from Gryffindor for Potter's lack of organisation." A loud series of groans and murmurs came from the class but Snape simply ignored it. "Go sit down."
"You're fit." Draco tried again, dropping the insults whilst attempting to peek over to see what Harry was reading.
Draco could sense Harry shutting off from the conversation again and knew he needed to keep it going, so changed the subject. "How was quidditch practise?"
He was late, no surprise there, but there was a small part of Draco that didn't want Harry to show up, just so there would be no confrontation.
"Expect the unexpected." Draco moved away from Harry. "Because I sure didn't." He muttered to himself. Harry really was crap at kissing, but Draco still felt as if the confusion played a huge role in his freezing.
"Are you even going to look up at me?" Draco assumed he was doing this because of the... well, the confession Harry had sprung on him a week ago.
Harry rolled his eyes, shaking his head as if Draco had been genuinely asking him that question. "I'm fine, let's just do what we need to do here." The quicker Draco helped him with Potions, the shorter he would have to spend basking in this awkwardness.
That would maybe explain why he was in the library, pretending to look at a book on Goblins whilst trying to eavesdrop into Hermione and Ron's conversation.
This time, Draco didn't waste time to be in control, his lips barely staying on Harry's before going down to his neck. Harry threw his head back against the wall, feeling Draco suck on a certain sweet spot that was making him writhe in pleasure. "Don't be–
When the lesson came to an end, Harry was one of the first to pop out of his seats, ready to leave... until Snape called him and Draco back, saying that he needed to talk to them.
"No, no!" Harry denied too eagerly, causing Hermione to raise a brow at him; it was just a simple yes or no question. "I mean," Harry took his tone done a notch. "I'm fine, why?"
"Fine, just– Ugh." Although Draco grabbed Harry's hand roughly, looking to the side to make sure nobody was lurking in the corner watching them, he gently kissed the small mark that was on Harry's wrist before dropping his arm, letting it hang by his side. Harry was full on grinning by now and gazed at the place Draco had kissed in delight. "I feel so much better now, thanks."
"Well I- Uh, I was– You know..." Harry hopelessly stuttered over every word he could, rubbing the back of his neck.
"No!" Draco practically exclaimed, shaking his head. "No." He said more softer this time, burying his hands in his face. "No." He repeated for the third time, despite Harry hearing the other two times.
Harry shrugged, grinning as Draco put his arm around Harry's waist to support him whilst Harry put his hand on Draco's shoulder. Harry could hear Draco's breathing quicken, reminding Harry of how much this close proximity was like last night. He just hoped he didn't smell too bad after the match.
All my thoughts centred back to the kiss; as expected, I hadn't suddenly been an expert, but it was better than the first one, I actually being able to enjoy the feeling of Malfoy's lips moving against mine.
Harry frowned; his previous questions/statements being completely ignored, but then shrugged, hiding his annoyance with a tight lipped smile.
Harry didn't trust his voice to speak so shook his head, rubbing his palms on his trousers and watching as Draco came closer to him.
It was like Draco was trying to be civil, which didn't make sense to Harry at all. Why was he so formal to Harry yesterday then? He had shut down Harry immediately.
Draco deliberately kept his stare on the table, not meeting Harry's eyes. "You asked me if I liked Pansy yesterday, and the answer is no."
"Gryffindor's 10 points behind, but if their star seeker Harry Potter is able to retrieve the Golden Snitch, it'll be a sure win, unless the Gryffindor seeker stays distracted as he has this whole game... but that doesn't matter, Harry Potter could beat Slytherin in his sleep." Harry heard Lee's voice bellowing around the stadium but instead of comforting him, it put more pressure on him as he tried to block out the noise.
Context: Harry had just tripped over what appeared to be air and was pestering for Draco to help him.
Harry winced at his word choice, but it was Draco Malfoy he was talking about. The boy obsessed with blood status; of course he wouldn't be fully open to the idea of two boys kissing. "It's not that I want to necessarily kiss you, it's that I want to practise and since we're not friends, there's no feelings attached."
The rage in Harry was at an all time high. Here Pansy stood, spewing out insults, yet he could do nothing but helplessly watch.
"What's wrong with him?" Draco had heard Hermione's theory and although he knew there was a high chance she was right, and that seemed like the most valid reason for why Harry was acting like this, he didn't want to agree with the mudblood. Draco finally managed to push Harry off of him and stood at the other side of the room.
He would've been able to really think about how Malfoy had called him Harry; did he want Harry then?
"You told them about us?" Harry blurted out, seeing the way Draco's brow raised, most likely at the fact he had said 'us'. "Oh, I didn't mean us in that way, I meant, you know er- I just didn't think..."
When he did find it, he hesitated whether he should leave something, but decided against it, and simply walked out, looking at Malfoy one last time before leaving.
"He'll be here later, so now he's gone, we can talk about you and Ginny." Hermione smiled, her whole expression brightening.
"Yes, only now, I wouldn't take back anything that happened between him and I." He snapped in a way that made her wince but he instantly regretted it and calmed down. "I'm sorry, you did nothing wrong, I shouldn't be taking this out on you when you're just trying to help." He apologised in a rush. "I'm just... mad, I guess. Mad at him, but more mad at myself for being so naïve and trusting him. He's Draco Malfoy for God's sake and I
Draco spun around to look at Harry, shrugging off the hand on his shoulder. "I don't know, okay, I just– I'm sorry, I shouldn't have done that."
Ginny immediately perked up, all her stories flashing to mind straight away. "Unfortunately yes, you'll never believe what she said to this girl in my year..." She started to explain, using gestures to get her story across even more.
"Okay, great, yeah." Draco's voice wavered slightly, staring at Harry who was biting his lip, almost making Draco want to kis-
"Not a lot, I don't think." Harry actually seemed to be calculating it in his mind. "But that's not the point, why did you want to speak to me?"
"I said shut it Malfoy." Harry hissed, finally turning to look at Draco. Draco could no longer see that excited gleam Harry used to have sparkling in his emerald eyes, instead, it was replaced by the dull look that Harry was giving him.
Since Potions, Harry hadn't been able to find his wand...Well, he had actually forgotten about it, having frees that didn't require his wand, and it hadn't been till Hermione had asked him to accio a quill for her that he had realised it'd gone.  "No, I don't know where I've dropped it."
The silence was deafening as Draco assessed the situation, checking Harry out in an obvious manner, weighing the options against each other. Harry started to slightly rock back on his feet and felt the regrets wash over him when Draco still remained silent. If he was going to say no, he could just say it straight away so Harry could move on, find another person, and maybe bathe in his embarrassment for a day or two before blocking it out of his memories.
Snape's attentive eyes surveyed the class, glaring at the empty desk where Harry was meant to be before he redirected his glare to Hermione. "Miss Granger, where is–" Snape was in the middle of asking when a disgruntled Harry came running in, coming to a full stop next to Snape.
Draco sped up his walking pace, causing Harry to fall behind with his knee that was killing him. "Malfoy slow down, you're walking too fast." Harry grumbled.
Harry actually looked guilty and glanced down at the ground, kicking a rock underneath his foot that seemed to frown at his rude attack.
"Time sure isn't your greatest asset." Draco welcomed an angry Harry who rolled his eyes at him, staying quiet. "Go get the ingredients then."
Hermione shrugged, a curious glint still in her eyes, but she didn't bring it up again, though knowing Hermione, the first thing she would do as soon as she had the chance to would be to investigate where his 'bruise' had come from.
So blinded by her excitement, Hermione didn't pick up on my lie at all, instead smiling brightly, colourful words flying out of her mouth that I didn't exactly feel the need to listen to.
"Wha- What's that?" Draco pointed to something behind Harry's head. Harry quickly turned his head, and whilst he did, Draco's hand slid into Harry's robe pockets and smoothly grabbed Harry's wand out of it and hid it in his own pocket.
"But he's so... he- I don't want him near me." Draco knew he was whining, and with no response from Snape, he reluctantly stopped running and stayed in one place, Harry automatically catching up to him, standing by his side. Harry grabbed Draco's hand, squeezing it tightly then let go to cup Draco's cheeks. "Can I kiss you again? I really really really really want to."
Harry sat down at Draco's very fancy, and organised, desk, sucking in a deep breath when Draco pulled out a chair and sat next to him. "Let's start with the essay you did then." Draco held out his hand for Harry to pass it to him. Harry, instead, just stared at Draco's smooth hand, thinking of what it would be like to hold it and smile with Dra– "Harry!"
But then he changed the topic; and the smile vanished off of his face. "You know Jack thinks you're fit."
so just to clear things up, i am the author of this book from wattpad but i decided to modify and improve my previous writing so this still goes by the plot of the wattpad one, but there may be aspects that are added or taken out. in addition, in this chapter, it may seem like harry is calling draco by his first name in his 'thoughts' and vice versa, but it was just to make it less confusing so i wouldn't have to switch from Malfoy to Draco or Potter to Harry so they still refer to each other by their last names. If this doesn't make sense to you, don't worry ahah.
Harry nearly let out a sigh of relief at that being all. "We're friends now, I guess, so it doesn't matter too much." Though Harry would've been freaking out more if it wasn't for the knowledge that him calling Draco by his first name was a much better option than allowing things to click into place for Draco.
Harry opened his mouth, ready to thank her, or even start some small talk, when he felt someone crash into him from behind, catching him off guard so much that he stupidly lost his balance and fell onto the ground, hearing a click as his knee took the brunt of the fall.
"Yeah, you, you're still feeling vulnerable and me kissing you wouldn't be right. Might confuse you more,
Harry sighed, gently massaging his temples, "This friendship, the kissing whenever you feel like it, then denying it means anything to you." He let out. "I'd love to stay your friend Draco, I really would, but it's just... every minute I spend with you," Harry paused, glancing down at the floor. "–I get more attached to you." He whispered.
Draco's mouth slightly gaped seeing the fresh bruises on Harry's face and a (slightly) insensitive joke as some may say, slipped out. "Did you trip over every stair getting here?"
He wanted to end this thing before it got too far, his father's warning still ringing in his head, but he just couldn't bear to break it to Harry who always seemed pleased at any words Draco would say to him.
Harry didn't say anything more; he didn't want to mess up or feel that same silly feeling he had before. For some reason, embarrassing himself in front of Draco always seemed to leave the worst feeling yet it was such a common occurrence.
The sound of his name being used pulled Harry back to reality as he looked up at Draco's exasperated expression, but then he realised Draco had called him Harry, not Potter, and felt a small sense of achievement. "You called me Harry, not Potter. Why?"
Harry stared at Draco blankly, racking his brains of how Draco could've known how to do those spells. There were a few theories Harry ha–
Harry's smile came back as he leaned off of the tree, gently pushing Draco's arm. "Don't do that again, I would've been so upset if it were true."
It was all Draco's fault, definitely. If he hadn't have stolen Harry's homework, then Harry wouldn't have been late, then Snape wouldn't have been in an even worse mood and Harry wouldn't have been so angry and stupidly messed up the potion so yes, it all started with Draco.
It had simply been brushed past, unfortunately for Harry, and nothing more was said about it. Though Draco had continued to give Harry kissing tips, he had left the practical side of it out, reducing the teaching to
"Ah." Hermione appeared like she had figured something out but Harry didn't get it all and asked what she meant by that. "Would his parents have been at home?"
"Yes, yours. I told you to not be too obvious." Harry pulled down the collar of his shirt to Draco, as Draco noticed that the top buttons of Harry's shirt were undone, biting his lip as he saw the hickies he had marked Harry with.
"I'm joking." Harry did that hearty laugh of his again that made Draco have to bite down on his lip to not smile. "Except for the friends part, I'm serious about that." Harry clarified.
Harry, however, was too skittish to just sit down and study so decided he would take his leave. "I'm gonna go outside, see if I can find Ron as well whilst I'm outside."
Harry would've laughed if what Ron was saying didn't make sense in a weird way. He assessed Ron's looks; he had some nice freckles splattered against his face with his bright, impressionable blue eyes, but they just weren't Draco's angelic ones... and their personalities were different, much different. "I've only ever seen you as a friend."
"I knew you could do it!" Hermione exclaimed, at first going in to give him a hug before scrunching her nose up, deciding against it and giving him a slightly-awkward high five.
"–minutes late so that'll be ten points off of Gryffindor and since you're at the front of the class, I presume you'll be able to hand in your homework now." Snape held out his hand towards a sheepish Harry who had started to fidget, trying to find the right words to say under Snape's intense stare.
hadn't turned to face Harry, his voice seeming much sadder in his last sentence. "Are you okay?" Harry realised the irony of his question. After coming here and basically going off at him, he had taken a full 180, acting like he wanted to comfort Draco.
Harry glanced up, feigning a look of surprise as he let out a chuckle, stepping to the side. "Oh wow, what a coincidence. Well, now I'm here, I might as well wait for you."
Harry rolled his eyes, grumbling a small, "I hate you," that didn't sound convincing to anyone with a pair of eyes to see or a pair of ears to hear.
Draco was rendered speechless for a second before he composed himself quickly, putting on the best sneer he could. "You must be delirious to think I could be jealous of anything to do with you."
"But why him?" Ron turned around to look towards the Slytherin table, giving Draco a glare when he saw him looking back. "He's so... He's so Malfoy. Were there no other boys you could've liked? Surely I'm a better match than Malfoy."
Draco knew he'd said the wrong words when the half smile on Harry's face left as his lips pursed together, appearing to be in deep thought.
Harry just hadn't expected it to ache as much as it did. He had gotten on well enough for his whole life without Draco, so why did this one week without him have to affect him so much?
"I don't know really." Harry shrugged, concealing the reason why. It's not that he didn't trust Hermione, but he just didn't want to tell her everything that was happening with Draco and him yet when their relationship was still so messy. "What are you gonna do with the book then?" Harry changed the subject and Hermione could tell this, but was so consumed by her excitement that she allowed him to do it and started talking about the house elves.
Whilst Hermione projected her elation, I glanced over at the Slytherin table, catching Malfoy laughing at something Parkinson was saying. Seeing Malfoy laugh was a rare occasion. It was almost...
"Let's go outside, there'll be less people there." She linked her arm with Harry, leading him outside with her.
"I asked Ginny out on a date today." Harry finally spoke, though Draco would've preferred the silence over learning about Harry's dating life. "Well, I wouldn't entirely call it a date, but we're gonna hang out. Just the two of us."
Draco didn't even know where to start with his long list of questions: How had he gotten into the Slytherin dungeons? How did he know Draco would be here? How did he know which room was Draco's?
Draco actually seemed apologetic, shaking his head as he looked away. "Sorry." He mumbled, so quietly that Harry wasn't sure if he had heard correctly. He wanted to ask Draco to repeat what he'd said but then the moment would be ruined, and Draco would 100% not say it again.
It was no surprise that she had followed, he should've known. He turned around and gritted his teeth. "Granger."
They waited for everyone else to leave the class before Snape began what he needed to say. "I presume the tutoring sessions between the two of you are still happening as planned."
True to Hermione's word, Ginny walked in with Luna, the two of them looking to be in a deep conversation. Harry caught Ginny's eye and waved her over, separating her from Luna who went and sat with Neville whilst Ginny came to sit next to Harry.
Harry didn't make any effort to talk first so Draco gladly welcomed the idea of a silent Harry and started to speak. "Since you're so incompetent, I'll make the potion, you watch."
Between the stares Harry would give him when he thought he wasn't looking, ranging from wistfulness to yearning, and what Draco believed to be unnecessary physical contact (brushing hands, wrapping an arm around Draco's shoulder, leaning undeniably close to Draco in the name of teasing and much more) Draco was having a hard time believing that Harry was '
They both spoke at the same time, exchanging a knowing look whilst keeping the laughter in their heads.
Harry didn't ponder on it for too long though, and ran his hands through Draco's hair, savouring the softness of it, and let out a groan as Draco's hands made their way under his shirt. "Shit, Draco, what are we doing?" Harry breathed out, looking into Draco's dilated pupils.
Draco walked outside, Harry following right behind him. "I don't understand what you want me to do."
Harry was about to answer when Snape looked their way with an expectant look on his face, making Hermione go to her partner, and Harry, unfortunately, to his own partner too.
Draco hadn't been looking at Harry, slightly embarrassed at what had happened last night, but when he did glance at Harry, he didn't fail to miss the look Harry gave to Jack before turning to him and replying, "Well how about later?"
This whole conversation seemed so foreign; him asking if Harry was okay, Harry almost spilling a secret, calling each other by their first names...It was like a fever dream.
was he here? There were so many more, but they all left when Harry took off the invisibility cloak, revealing his chaotic self.
"I am, I swear, I've just got a lot on my mind." I kept the truth to myself, not yet prepared for Hermione to learn of my upcoming deal with Malfoy.
"No, stop it." Draco shook his head, desperately trying to communicate to Snape with his mind to hurry up. "Er- how long until it's ready?"
"No, you're right." He nodded with a grim look on his face. "I've been cowering behind a shell for too long, all because of my fear of what people would say and whilst doing this, I... I hurt you in the process too and I shouldn't have done that."'
His gaze would just drift to the brown haired boy and stay there, watching how at ease he looked :smiling, laughing, chatting... the opposite of what Draco had been doing lately with his 'friends'.
"Just because you're invisible, Potter, does not mean you are soundless. Anybody would be able to tell with those clunky footsteps of yours." Draco turned around, Harry instantly seeing the bags under Draco's paler-than-usual skin.
Okay, he needed to control himself, this was just Draco, there was no need for him to behave like a feral animal.
"It's fine, honestly. I guess we're both stupid then." Harry shrugged and without thinking placed his hand on Draco's thigh but feeling Draco tense under him, he snatched his hand back to his lap. "Sorry."
Draco didn't wait a second longer for any doubts to sink in and leaned in, lightly backing her against the wall. He roughly kissed her, desperately trying to get that spark he would with
"Malfoy." Harry greeted, and Draco despised the way his heart did a double take realising Harry was there. "Why were you glaring at Ginny?"
Malfoy, however, grabbed onto Harry's arms, whispering a soft "Stay" that Harry wanted to listen to, but he just didn't think Malfoy would be that glad to wake up in the morning and find the two of them together spooning. So Harry stayed still for a few minutes, making sure to keep a distance between his dick and Malfoy's ass, even though it was difficult with Malfoy being such a horny sleeping person, moving back into Harry, but eventually, Harry was able to slowly take his arms away from Malfoy and carefully slid out of the bed, searching for his invisibility cloak.
Harry tried his best to not let the irritated expression show on his face, but Draco must've noticed, raising a brow at him as if to say
That was the last straw for Draco who had heard enough. "Potter, do you ever get tired of listening to your own voice?"
And that's how Harry and Draco ended up sneaking into the Forbidden Forest, talking for the rest of the night.
Harry stared into those grey eyes he had become familiar with, trying to grasp where he was. "Wha-? Why am I... Where?"
"I didn't mean– Whatever." Harry grumbled, before realising the position he was in, and shooting up off of Draco, sitting beside him. "Why was my head on your lap?"
"Yes, he had to talk to me about something." Draco sat on the couch, moving away from her, but she simply perched right next to him.
Harry took Draco being comfortable enough to smile with him as an invitation to sit on Draco's bed, complimenting his bouncy it was.
"Don't stress, I'm sure you'll do really well, you're already so smart." Harry complimented, liking the way her cheeks went rosy.
It wasn't the fear of rejection, no surprise there since Harry liked him too. What was there to reject? It was the opinion's of everyone else, which he knew he shouldn't dwell on, it was 'his life' as Harry would love to say... but it wasn't.
"I've finished it." Harry announced after a few seconds, passing the parchment to Draco. He checked over it, searching for any mistakes, but there were none.
Draco swiftly looked down at the textbook in front of him, heat running through his cheeks at being caught. He cleared his throat and adjusted the collar of his shirt.
He always seemed to let his guard down around Draco and it always seemed to backfire on him. Harry glanced towards where Draco was and caught the smirk on his face before Draco looked away.
It took a while, but Draco did eventually calm down, his laugh coming to a stop. "What is going on in that head of yours?" Draco untangled their hands from each other, hearing a small complaint from Harry, and hit Harry lightly on the back of his head. "Why'd you think I brought up my father?"
"But whatever happens, I'm here for you. You know that?" Harry put his hand over Draco's. "You'll never be alone and if he even tries anything, I'll be there like... like your knight in shining armour." Harry laughed at the thought.
"I did it right, didn't I? I can tell by your face." Harry grinned lazily, pulling at Draco's heart strings.
"The Snitch has been spotted! Look at the seekers go! Draco Malfoy's catching up but... HE'S DONE IT! HARRY POTTER HAS CAUGHT THE GOLDEN SNITCH ONCE AGAIN!"
Harry shook his head, "It's alright. I can tell y–" He was in the middle of speaking when Snape turned around so quickly that it felt like Harry could feel the whiplash.
"No you're not. What's going on?" Hermione stared at a panicked Harry, also feeling the confusion at what was going on.
Draco tried to amble as casually as he could up to the two of them, feeling his confident falter when they carried on with their conversation, paying no regards to him. "We need to talk."
Harry smiled in return and stepped forward, reaching his hand out and using his thumb to caress Draco's lips, like he was wiping away the smile. "Why do you have to be so bloody attractive?" He whispered, but stepped back just as quick, leaning against the tree as if he hadn't just done what he'd done.
Draco couldn't deny the disappointment that ran through him, but he simply played it off with an "Oh."
Was what he was going to say before he started to get a bit dizzy, his surroundings kind of mixing into one.
Harry felt the mortification rush through him as he forced his voice to stay in control, not wanting to alert Ron. "Yeah, it's fine. Honestly. I should've paid more attention."
"But I was just going to ask–Okay, fine then, I'll change the subject... for now." Harry gave in when Draco squeezed his hand again. "Do you ever think about how different things could've been if it weren't for Voldemort?" He felt Draco flinch beside him at the mention of Voldemort's name but carried on. "We might've been friends... Or maybe more."
"None of your business, Malfoy." I carried on walking, praying that he'd take the hint, and for once in his life, act as a decent human being, but he didn't. Instead, I heard his footsteps coming closer towards me before he grabbed my shoulder, pushing me roughly against the wall.
job, not Harry's. Draco had no thoughts for an articulate or taunting response back, instead blubbering out a, "Wha-?" and watching as Harry smiled shyly, in an innocent manner though he was far from innocent.
"Just as foreseen, no apology. 10 points from Gryffindor and in fact, Mr Weasley, swap seats with Mr Malfoy, maybe that'll prevent either of you from talking over me."
Harry began to shake his head, the flush that had just left his cheeks steadily coming back, "No, it's not like that. It's just a one off; I found it in my aunt's room and I was bored, so I read it. That's it." He explained, missing out the part that he actually found it interesting and had consequently made several more journeys to his Aunt's room to
Harry didn't know how to react; he wasn't the best at working with emotions, especially emotions from Draco of all people. He sat down next to Draco, looking down at his hands. "You can tell me what's wrong, I won't judge."
Draco expected Harry's response, not even batting an eyelid at Harry's smouldering glare. "I don't know if you've noticed yet, but Snape is currently staring daggers into your soul right now–" Harry turned his head and realised Draco was right. "–so unless you want Gryffindor to go down to minus points, I suggest you get those ingredients like I said." Draco gave Harry a superficial smile, irking Harry even more who forced himself to not storm over to where the ingredients were.
"So when I told you to go practise with somebody you weren't close with, you chose... Malfoy?" Hermione still chose to focus on the first part of the story on how, and why, Harry had chosen
Draco actually sounded woeful which tugged at Harry's ever growing feelings. "I'm going to help you figure out your sexuality."
There, Draco could see Harry and Ron discussing something, Ron turning around once to frown at Draco whilst Harry shook his head. Harry probably would've spent his whole time there if he could've but Snape was truly watching him, threatening to take points off of Gryffindor
unenthusiastically took Harry's hand though it really wasn't necessary and stood up next to Harry. "Goodnight Draco." Harry was about to leave when Draco blurted out, "Come to my room."
"I'm not walking too fast, you're walking too sl-" Draco turned around, stopping when he saw Harry limping. "Wow, Potter, you really are a liability."
"Really Draco? Oh I can't wait Draco. Draco, Draco, Draco, my love, Draco Drac-" Harry had started to bust out into some song and Draco couldn't decide if the song was even worse than Harry trying to forcefully kiss him.
As soon as he got to the toilets, he checked the stalls to ensure nobody was in there and went straight to the mirror. He unbuttoned the top part of his shirt to find many prominent 'bruises' splattered just below his neck. "Shit, why'd he have to make them so noticeable?" Harry grumbled to himself, pulling out his wand to do the glamour spell when he heard a voice, causing him to jump.
"It's not your fault at all." Hermione stood up too, standing in front of Harry so he'd stop walking. "So he really just left you and kissed Parkinson?"
Seconds passed as Draco tried to think of something up on the spot. "Have you done the potions assignment?"
"Why are you upset over that? It's none of your business; it's not like I had a hissy fit every time you and Weaslette were together." Draco knew this was a lie; he had hated every moment Harry and Ginny had been together, always looking for a way to separate them, but not everything needed to be verbalised.
Draco looked to be in a foul mood, and Harry didn't really understand why... well, he knew it could be something to do with him ignoring Draco, but that couldn't be the only reason.
"I've seen that you and Draco are becoming quite friendly. Is there something more going on there?" Pansy didn't let Harry have time to disagree and contributed on with her insinuation. "Is the chosen one in love with Draco?" Her tone was drunk with sarcasm, her scowl attacking Harry.
She had suspected that Harry was having a fling with someone; after finding out the 'bruises' on his neck were hickies and that's why he had been so embarrassed about the topic, but she hadn't thought he could be bisexual, or any other sexualities, but then she had never asked, so it wasn't anybody's fault. "Who is he?" She curiously asked, not many names coming to her head of who Harry could've become infatuated with.
Harry's smile turned goofy as he waited for a congratulations from Draco but nothing came. "Aren't you gonna praise my amazing potion skills?"
Typical mudbl- Granger, Draco thought to himself, scolding himself at the word he nearly called her.
"Harry, are you that worried for the match?" Hermione finally asked, shocking Harry who had completely forgotten she was there, flinching a bit.
"You shouldn't just live to satisfy people. You should be who you want to be. Take care of yourself first."
"You shall play too knight..." Harry muttered under his breath, trying to understand when it finally clicked. "Oh! Usual place tonight." He half exclaimed the words a bit louder than he had expected to, Hermione's brows furrowing at him as she stopped talking. "What?"
sport." Harry teased, already knowing he'd– excuse the pun again– hit the mark when there was no reply from Draco except a grumble of some kind before a "Shut up." Then the sound of a door shutting.
"Thanks Harry, I guess I'm gonna have to spend the rest of today cramming for it." Ginny sighed, glancing to the side. "I don't know if I'm going crazy, but is Malfoy glaring at me?"
"Don't smile like that." It was like their roles had switched: Harry being negative and Draco being positive (Shocker!).
Draco shook his head, "Oh no, I'm not injured, I just had to assist Potter here." He explained, stepping back.
And there went the happiness that Harry had been feeling from before. He took a good look at Draco: his posture was more stiff as the eye bags under his eyes seemed to have increased. There was no sign of light in those thunderstorm eyes, just an impatient Draco eager to get away from Harry as quickly as possible. "Potter?" Harry questioned, they were back to last names?
As soon as Harry got to the tower and saw Draco sitting down, he immediately requested for his wand back, hearing a snort from Draco in response. "Not even a hello, Potter?"
The cogs in Harry's brain immediately started to turn, searching the contact book of his brain to locate someone who he wasn't too close to, and able to kiss without catching feelings.
"But I am evil. If I get the–" Draco suddenly stopped, almost like he was going to reveal a big secret.
Draco wasn't sure if he really did, but gave a little nod, allowing Harry to continue with the cheeky smile he had on. "You'd be ranked first in my list."
"Oh." Harry stopped talking and moved closer to Draco, their shoulders touching, then continued a second later. "I wonder how Ginny did in her test." Harry accidentally thought out loud, but Draco heard it loud and clear. Before Harry could say anything more, Draco had pushed him harshly against the wall, his eyes flaming with anger. "Someone ought to watch what comes out of that pretty mouth of yours."
Draco turned around, counting on the belief that Harry would follow, and headed outside, searching around for somewhere that nobody was and finally finding a secluded area around some trees. Draco stood opposite of Harry who leaned against a tree, scanning Draco's face. "Is this about last night? Because I'm sorry if I went too fa–"
Harry expected the Draco before to probably make a snide comment about muggles and their ways of fighting, but Draco kept quiet, not mentioning a single word on Harry's face, or the fact that he had somehow managed to heal it.
"How does that concern you Pansy?" Draco accidentally snapped, the words sounding much lighter in his head. Pansy flinched, causing Draco to sigh. "I didn't mean it in that way. I just... I haven't been getting the most sleep lately which explains my crappy mood. He just asked me to tutor Potter."
"I think we should talk." Draco was the first one to speak, actually having the skill to whisper properly unlike Ron.
He definitely wouldn't go to the Great Hall, unprepared for the rumours that would be circling, most likely about the fiasco that had happened in Potions and instead headed up to somewhere he knew would be empty.
Somewhere so far, but so close, Draco sat leaned up against his door, his whole room a mess. In his frustration, he had knocked down anything that had gotten in his way and pulled out the note his father had given him to read after he had left the Manor:
"It's your father, isn't it?" Harry guessed, knowing he'd hit the mark when Draco's head whipped to the side at the mention of him. "I should've known."
, causing Harry to hear a popping noise. He let out a little grunt, not fully prepared for the invisible force that had hit his knee.
Draco could see Harry's mood lighten up as he held his hand out to Harry who leaned forward a bit, but at the last second, Harry changed his mind and instead went in for a hug.
." Draco let the Potter run off his tongue smoothly, clearly enunciating every syllable in an over exaggerated way. Harry felt a weird tingle run up his spine but brushed it away.
"I need to tell you something later Ron." Harry whispered as soon as Snape turned his back to the class, writing something on the chalkboard.
Harry felt a burst of pride at the fact he had made Draco laugh; not Pansy this time. Though he didn't exactly know what was funny, he wanted to take in Draco's laugh, noticing the way his eyes crinkled at the corners as his hands stayed on his stomach.
Draco snorted, shaking his head slightly. "A high five?" Harry nodded back. "You can't be serious? You got a question right, not an outstanding in your exam."
Harry could see the look Draco had and quickly cast the glamour charm on his neck, buttoning up his shirt to hide his skin from Draco's burning gaze. "You're looking like you want to give me more. That wasn't the point of me showing you, you should feel bad."
"Amortentia. The boy has gone and messed up the simple draught of peace potion." Snape stood between Draco and Harry. Draco wanted to mention that the potion wasn't as simple as he had said, but it would make it seem like he was sticking up for Harry; which he definitely wasn't. "I'll have to brew the antidote."
Harry was about to explain that he wasn't, but just decided to keep quiet since it wasn't that serious of a misunderstanding. "Are you mad at me?" Harry bravely asked. After the quidditch game,
It seemed that there seemed to be a bit of luck on Draco's side; Harry had gotten the due date wrong.
Unlike with Hermione, he didn't feel the need to pull away, instead, his focus was fixed on Draco's lips as he licked his own in anticipation. Draco noted Harry's eagerness and internalised a smirk as the gap between their lips closed for the second time that day.
Harry was so shocked by how soft Draco's voice had become, and before he could even snap back in to step away from Draco, he heard Draco mumble something quietly, lightly touching one of Harry's bruises and somehow making the pain fade. Draco stepped away immediately afterwards, but not before Harry noticed a slight blush on the tip of his ears as he cleared his throat. "Right, let's start then."
Harry was trying his best to shut off the Draco side of his brain for the week, but it was much easier said than done, especially with how Draco had finally decided it was 'notice Harry Potter' week. It was like instead of him being repelled away from Draco, they were magnets being attracted to each other. Draco would just constantly seem to be in the same place as him; the bathroom, the corridors and even outside the Gryffindor common room once (though that was because he needed some notes from a Gryffindor in their year) . Perhaps this was how Draco had felt before, Harry showing up everywhere he was. Right now though, Hermione was searching for a book on her new project: House elves.
Time for him to leave, he decided, before Granger would dig deeper and unravel all the secrets he'd been wrapping up. "I'll see you later Granger." He didn't wait for her reply and walked away as quick as he could without running.
Hermione pulled his arms down so his blushing face was back on display. "Have you talked to her yet?"
or thought about whilst reading those books had made Draco feel very hot inside... and, well, he may have just nodded to everything that Harry had asked, thereby leading to this potion that was definitely not brewed correctly. Draco could feel Snape's eyes burning into him and cautiously took a sip of the potion, Harry's concerned eyes watching his every move. "I feel–"
Draco was not giving an explanation for why and simply remained silent so Pansy thought out loud, "Why not then?"
The taste was almost bittersweet— he would sure love some pumpkin juice right now to wash it down— but since he still felt relatively normal; no missing fingers or his teeth growing long like a beaver, like Hermione's once did, he shrugged, feeling okay with himself.
Neither of them spoke for a bit, not even Draco who just sat with his head buried in his arms, tapping his foot against the ground as if it would quicken the boredom he was sure he was destined to die from. "I'm hot." Draco lifted his head from his arms, putting his hand on his forehead that felt like it was sizzling.
He shook his head frantically, wiping off his proud expression and putting on one that hopefully seemed innocent. "Oh, no, nothing."
Harry's brows raised, wondering what Draco was on about. "Evil? Definitely not. Maybe the adjective annoying would suit you more."
"It's just, please don't laugh but... I've been told my kissing techniques aren't the best by uh-" Harry cleared his throat, drowning in the awkwardness. "-a lot of people? So I needed help and that's where you came into the equation."
And started to laugh at Harry who shook his head before burying his face in his hands, "You're never gonna let me live that down, are you?"
Harry moved his stare to his hands that rested on the table, shrugging in a way to show that he didn't care, when it was obvious he really did. " If suppressing my crush for you is all I have to do for us to be friends, then so be it."
"I don't... I don't particularly want us to go back to being enemies." Draco stared down at his hands as he spoke. If his father could hear what he was saying, he'd probably crucio him on the spot. "We can still be friends, just less... publicly?" He himself wasn't even sure on why he was saying this.
Harry didn't know what she would do next; he couldn't tell in those menacing eyes of hers, but what he didn't expect to happen was for a fist to come flying into his face with no warning, landing onto his cheekbone and sending a rush of pain to wash over him.
Harry wanted to spur out some insults but clamped his mouth shut, his eyes glaring daggers into Draco.
Hearing her name jogged Draco's memory to her saying that Harry had said they were friends. He didn't know why it bothered him so much, he should just forget about it, but his curiosity got a hold of him as he started to speak. "Granger told me that you said we were friends."
It only took a few more minutes for Snape to finish the antidote but for Draco, it had felt like years. Harry had still stood extremely close to him, sometimes brushing his hand with Draco's and it had taken every muscle in him to not shout at Harry again. When asked how effective and safe the antidote was by Draco, Snape had simply shrugged whilst Harry drank it up quickly, still expecting unlimited kisses from Draco after.
"No, it's not your fault, you don't need to apologise. We don't have to stop being friends, but maybe just for a week, we take a break you know? Gives you space to think and gives me time to try and get over you I guess."
When Draco did finally hear that knock on the door, he straight away whispered a "Alohomora" that opened the door up, revealing Harry who had his head down as he slightly...
Draco felt Harry's shoulder rub against his own, knowing Harry had also sat down, "I think I like boys Harry, this isn't good."
“Hilarious is not the word I would use. Why on earth would they want you to die? You’re the golden boy.”
“Okay. It’s getting a little easier. There are even days where I can go a couple hours without thinking about him. And then, of course, that just makes me feel like shite, so.”
“Yeah. Yes. That’s me. Open-minded. Definitely. Open to new ideas.” Harry managed not to groan at how utterly stupid he sounded. Merlin, what the fuck even was today? Draco leaned over him and Harry held his breath. Draco looked over his face and a smirk tugged at his lips.
“I know that. I get it. Really. It’s fine.” Harry tried to move away from Draco. If he was going to lose him soon, it would be better to get used to the idea now.
“For now, it leaves us right here.” Draco tucked Harry’s head under his chin. “We’ve only just found each other. I don’t want to lose you before I have to.”
“We are not going to shag on the floor of a dusty classroom with a Great Hall full of people that have surely noticed that you are missing and are looking for you.”
“Harry...” Draco reached out and pulled him into a tight hug. He stroked his hair and his back. “I am so sorry. You didn’t deserve to be treated like that.” Harry buried his head in the crook of Draco’s neck and took a deep breath.
“Of course, we will, Harry!” Hermione rested a hand on his shoulder. “True, maybe we’ll never be the same, but we’ll be okay.” She squeezed his shoulder. “Together. We’ll be okay again.” She gave him a small smile and he nodded. “Do you think you’ll come back for your seventh year?”
“See you later, Ginny.” She gave him one last smile before she turned and walked back to the castle. Harry heaved a sigh and laid back on the grass. It had been a long morning. Maybe he would just take the rest of the morning off from doing anything. On the one hand, it felt nice to hear that the Weasleys were his family and most of them accepted this new facet of him without question. And it felt good to finally be on the same page with Ginny. But Ron being...upset? Angry? Disgusted? He didn’t know what Ron was but he knew it bothered him.
“I guess all sorts of things are possible in the afterlife.” Harry shrugged and looked over at his odd companion. “Draco?”
“Well, I was trying to have two moments of peace and quiet.” Harry huffed and sat up. He wiped at his face and only really succeeded in getting more dirt on his face. Which was when his body decided to remind him that he had fallen face first into the hard ground of the forest. His face ached and then it seemed to seep down into the rest of his body. His arms, his legs, and bloody hell, his chest suddenly felt as though it were on fire. Ah, that was where the curse had hit him.
“Most definitely.” Draco sat up and shuffled back to Harry’s thighs. With his free hand, he tugged Harry’s pyjama bottoms and pants down to free his cock. Harry gasped as cool air caressed his hot skin. “Merlin, the things I want to do to you...”
“But really, Harry, you’re family. You can’t ever get rid of us. No matter what you do or what we do. We’re always here for you. That’s what family is supposed to do.”
“You’re an idiot.” Draco sighed but rested his head on top of Harry’s. “Do you often sit like this with your friends?”
“What has Kinglsey done this time?” Arthur asked. He didn’t gesture for the letter as the rest of his family had done.
“He loves me. In his own way. I think.” Draco moved to sit on the bed across from him. “What is this about, Harry?”
“That was where the Sorting Hat wanted to put me, you know?” Harry pulled his knees up to his chest. “I should have let it. Maybe if I’d been a Slytherin, Snape wouldn’t have hated me so much. Maybe he would have trusted me. Told me the truth ages ago.” Harry choked out a mirthless laugh. “Maybe I would have figured it out all on my own.”
“Look at you.” Draco huffed into the air between them. He pulled on Harry’s hair and shivered at the groan it pulled from Harry’s lips. Draco started kissing his neck and collarbone, occasionally stopping to nibble and suck. “I love how responsive you are for me.”
“What now?” Harry let his head rest on Draco’s shoulder. “I’ve spent the better part of my life trying to defeat Voldemort. What am I supposed to do now?”
“No.” Harry shook his head. “No, they – Fred – Madam Pomfrey has more pressing matters.” He rested his forehead on his knees and desperately wished his mother was here. Everything hurt. Maybe he was dying again. Maybe his resurrection only lasted long enough to finish the job.
“Come here, darling.” Draco pulled him tight to him and Harry let out a broken sob. “It wasn’t your fault. And you did nothing wrong. They are the wrong ones. Not you.”
“So is the war. And yet you still have nightmares about it.” He finally looked down at Harry. “Just because it’s over doesn’t mean it isn’t still affecting you. You don’t need to deal with everything yourself.”
“Good. I would hate for you to stay closed in your little Gryffindor world.” He hesitated before he leaned down and pressed his lips against Harry’s. Okay. Well. Not just joking then. Draco pulled back but he didn’t get far before Harry leaned up to kiss him again. Everything about this should be awkward and awful and wrong. Why didn’t he feel any of that? He should be thinking of Ginny.
“I am. Jeez.” Harry rolled his eyes but started to put some food on his plate. Draco followed suit and they all fell into a mostly comfortable silence.
“Hello, Draco! Will you be joining us for dinner this evening?” Molly handed him a plate and Harry suddenly felt warm all over when Draco smiled back at her.
“Not necessarily.” Hermione sighed. “Harry and Dumbledore were both beloved figures but as soon as they said something against the Ministry...”
“Fine. But only because I don’t want Narcissa Malfoy bursting in here and accusing me of stealing her only son’s virtue or something. Which I haven’t even done.”
“Most people, yeah! But if you wanna go shag Malfoy, then be my guest, since you’re such a slag for it apparently.” Ron looked just as shocked at his words as Harry felt. The color that had been heating his face drained at the accusation. “...Harry, fuck, that’s not...I’m sorry...I didn’t--”
“More than likely.” Draco pulled back. “But I think we should worry about that when it happens and not before.” He leaned down and pressed his lips against Harry’s.
“Blimey, Harry, you get attacked by the Giant Squid or something?” George gave him a knowing grin and he felt his face heat up. Luckily for all involved, Ginny was sitting over at the Ravenclaw table with Neville and Luna.
“Come on, Harry. You can’t stay in bed all day.” Draco sounded amused and Harry took his pillow and aimed in the direction he thought the posh git was. “You really do have terrible aim, darling.”
“Yeah, except he used...” Harry squeezed his eyes shut. “Seven.” He still had to swallow down bile at the thought. And he had thought the incident at the Ministry a couple years ago had been horrifying.
“Merlin, no. Did our mishap with Slughorn teach you nothing? Nobody would dose me with amortentia just for me. They want the Chosen One. The bloody Saviour.” Harry spat the word like it was the poison. “That’s all any of them want me for.”
“Are you telling me that Dumbledore was more concerned about Harry getting himself killed than my pathetic attempts to murder him?”
“Ready.” He held out his hand and Draco hesitated for a moment before he accepted it. Together they walked out the door and started down the stairs to the Great Hall. Repairs to the castle were going well. McGonagall thought that the castle would be back to normal in another week or two. Harry didn’t really want to leave Hogwarts any time soon. Mostly because this was where Draco was. And the two of them managed to sleep if they were next to each other.
“I pity anyone who dares to stand in your way, Granger.” Draco gave him a smile and she returned it.
“I have no idea. To be honest, I haven’t ever thought about it. Father raised me to be like him. And my father never worked a day in his life. He influenced other people to do his work for him. But my mother and I won’t be able to survive on the Malfoy name. Not anymore. I suppose I’ll have to find a vocation.”
“I’ll let this one slide.” Malfoy shrugged and then turned to sit beside Harry. They sat in silence for a few minutes. Harry missed the weight of Malfoy’s hands.
“Just can’t figure out what the hell you’re doing going around with Malfoy. What happened to Ginny?”
“And you’re okay with me being ‘gay or whatever’ as long as it isn’t with Draco Malfoy?” Harry could feel his voice rising but he couldn’t quite figure out how to stop it. “Would you feel better if I were shagging your sister? Or maybe Charlie? He’s pretty fit after all. And definitely wouldn’t use me for my fucking saviour status, right?”
“The parental figures in our lives wanted us to be what they wanted.” Harry shrugged. “Now that it’s all over, we can do whatever we want.”
“It makes more sense that people just want something from me than they genuinely care about me.” Harry tried to keep hold of the pillow but Draco wrestled it from him.
“Mate, I’m just trying to look out for you!” Ron was shouting now as well. “He’s a bloody Death Eater!”
“Maybe.” Harry sighed and then he spotted Ginny walking out of the castle. “I should have just stayed in bed.” Charlie glanced up at his sister and laughed.
“Of course, dear!” Molly gave him a bright smile. “You’re always welcome to join us.” Ron shot his mother a disbelieving look.
“As tempting as that is, it really isn’t healthy for either of us to stay cooped up in here. And if we miss breakfast, Molly may come looking for us. Or worse, my mother.” Harry heaved a sigh and fell back on the bed.
“I suppose there’s a reason the Sorting Hat never even thought about putting me into Ravenclaw.” Draco laughed.
“With Hermione.” Harry tensed. “Why? Is it weird? I’m sorry. I didn’t -- I’m just tired.” He tried to sit up but Draco wouldn’t move his head.
Perhaps Dumbledore had grown to truly care about Harry as a person and not just a pawn in his chess match with Voldemort. But he certainly hadn’t started out caring about who Harry was or what he wanted or how he felt. Dumbledore had outright disregarded Harry for an entire year with no explanation. And hadn’t trusted Harry with vital information about himself. Never even mentioned the prophecy that he had heard directly from Trelawney’s mouth.
“Is this going to be a thing now?” Harry didn’t resist when Draco laced their fingers together and started walking to the castle. “Am I going to have Molly, Hermione, and you bugging me about eating?”
“It’s okay. We had a good run. Short but good.” Ginny gave him a kiss on the cheek and stood up. “Want me to give Malfoy the shovel talk since Ron apparently isn’t going to?”
“Yes, I do.” Harry sat up and pulled his knees up to his chest. “I heard your parents talking after the battle. They were talking about leaving England.”
“You’re not making any sense, Ron.” Harry rubbed his eyes tiredly under his glasses. “Draco wouldn’t go through all of the work and trouble slipping me amortentia would be just to have me.” Harry and Ron stared at each other in silence and Ron laughed once.
“I think we all figured that out.” Draco stroked his hair back from his forehead. “It is curious though. If he was the most powerful wizard in an age and he was gay, why hide it? Surely he could have done so much for the gay community.”
“We are.” Draco answered simply. Harry snorted into his pumpkin juice when he didn’t elaborate at all.
“I think he aged us all about ten years. Why do you think Dumbledore looked so tired towards the end?” They both started laughing.
“I like that sneer a lot more when it isn’t directed at me.” Harry reached up to brush his knuckles against his cheek. Draco rolled his eyes but didn’t pull away from the gentle touch.
“Much rather see you.” Harry finally forced his eyes open and stared up at him. He lifted his hips to tug his pants and bottoms back up. Draco frowned for a moment before Harry tackled him onto his back. It was times like this Harry really wished Sirius was still around. He wasn’t sure their relationship would have survived something like The Talk or How Do I Have Sex with Another Man but they both would have tried. As it was, trying his best and going along with whatever Draco did had worked so far.
“You’re right. It’s just better when you say please.” Harry tugged Draco’s bottoms down to his knees and paused to admire the image. Draco Malfoy, shirt pushed up under his armpits, pyjama bottoms around his knees, his pale chest and pink nipples on display, and his cock hard and leaking precome. Harry had been wrong before. This was the hottest thing that he had ever seen. And the first time he had properly seen another cock. Sure, he would catch glimpses in the Quidditch locker rooms or in the dorm showers but never like this.
“Do you know, I have no idea.” Harry admitted before he leaned down and caught his lips in a passionate kiss. He knew how to do this. They’d been doing this for a couple weeks now. And he absolutely loved the feel of Draco’s lips against his own. Soft but hard, gentle but unyielding. He tasted like blackberry jam. Harry moved down to kiss along his jaw, down his neck. He bit and sucked on the side of Draco’s neck and was rewarded with a groan of satisfaction.
Malfoy took big and exaggerated breaths. In through the nose and out through the mouth. Harry watched his shoulders rise and fall. He felt Malfoy’s breath on his face. Breathe. He could do that. Right? He took a breath when Malfoy did. It wasn’t as big or as deep but it was a breath. Harry managed to hold it in before he breathed out in sync with Malfoy.
“We’re friendly. I got the sense this morning that Draco was a permanent fixture in your life now so I thought it best to make amends.”
“He has offered Harry a position training to be an Auror.” Percy adjusted his glasses and set the letter back down.
Harry had died today. It hit him all over again. But instead of being filled with grief and confusion and pain it was somehow...funny. He had died. He had walked into the Forest on the memories of a man he loathed to be killed. It was hilarious. It was absolutely the funniest thing that he had ever heard in his life.
“Deal.” Harry sat up and sent a Patronus off to Hermione. She would be the least likely to go directly against his wish to be alone and rest. He still had things that needed to be dealt with. The wand in his hand, for one thing. But Draco was right. He needed to rest. There would be time to deal with the Elder Wand and the victorious dead and Ginny and Draco. There would time to figure it all out. For right now, he could stay with his old rival and just be Harry. And that was an immense relief.
Draco stayed out of the hall, replaying the way Harry's smile had somehow managed to brighten up his whole day.
"Where were you last night? Ron said you’d vanished." Hermione asked as Harry speedily searched for an excuse that Hermione wouldn't be able to sense was a lie.
It was Harry who finally did it, initiating the kiss. He was still a bit shaky on his kissing skills so Draco took control, putting his arms around Harry's neck to bring him closer. Harry's whole body tingled at the feeling of Draco's body against his; it was like a wave of warmth had come over him, suppressing a groan when Draco softly bit his bottom lip. Harry's fingers had started to slip underneath Draco's top when Draco pushed Harry slightly off of him, a grin almost playing on his so-very-appealing lips, "You sure you're still not on the love potion?"
"Who knows what you'll do? Last time you said you wanted a high five but then gave me a hug instead." Draco purposefully didn't mention what had happened after the hug–neither of them needed that reminder right now.
But Draco had already dragged Harry away with him, a scowl on his face. "Don't ask any questions." Draco immediately ordered, sensing the long list of questions that Harry would have.
just because you like boys, doesn't mean I've got a right to just kiss you whenever I feel like it." Harry was saying all of this sincerely, from the bottom of his heart, so when Draco started to laugh the loudest he'd ever heard, he couldn't understand why. "What did I say that was funny?"
Snape gave him a blank stare and didn't say anything, the silence being his answer. Draco allowed Snape get to work whilst simultaneously trying to stay away from Harry who was chasing him around the classroom.
And for once, Harry and Draco both shared a mutual confusion that took over the silence in the tower.
"Look, if you get off me now-" Draco's eyes darted to the side before he lowered his voice so that hopefully only Harry would hear. "I'll give you unlimited kisses once you've drank that potion Snape's making." Draco cringed at the thought of that but Harry immediately perked up, stepping away from Draco who was able to take a breath of relief.
Harry remembered Hermione was still waiting for an answer, so took his eyes away from the Slytherin table and bluntly answered, "No idea." Completely aware of why Draco was staring.
"Uh yeah." Harry used his other free hand to scratch the back of his neck, looking up. With the hand that was still on Draco, he was distractedly letting his fingers wander around Draco's neck, then softly brush his cheek.
Draco regretted asking the question when Harry took his lips away, instantly feeling the air rush onto his neck. "Yeah, practised a bit." Harry answered sheepishly but Draco raised a brow; was it that Ginger girl he had practised on? Harry caught Draco's look and brought up his arm. "Practise."
Harry smiled back at her, nodding, then left the hall to go and find Draco, wondering what game he was playing at.
Harry knew this to be an obvious lie; Hermione finished all her homework's on the day. Hermione gave Harry one last knowing look before getting up and leaving the hall.
Draco almost choked on the air at how casual Harry had said that but forced himself not to react, feeling Harry's stare checking for any slight movements he made, but he was sure he'd let something show when Harry started to chuckle. "You're properly blushing." He spoke the obvious. "Oh Merlin in the Heavens above, Draco Malfoy is blushing."
Harry looked over to the Slytherin table. Pansy and Draco were sitting next to each other but they both appeared tense, an obvious tension between the two of them. Draco looked up, making eye contact with Harry who immediately averted his eyes back to the table. "Er well–" Harry had planned to lie, say no, maybe tell Ron one day in the future on a drunken night, but there was no point of hiding anymore, so he just came out with the truth. "Malfoy." He whispered, not knowing if Ron had heard until Ron spit out the food in his mouth.
Context: Draco had just finished his Quidditch practise and Harry 'happened' to be there, conveniently standing right in front of Draco's bags whilst simultaneously pretending to be occupied by a speck on his wand.
"Hm. It's so comfy, thanks Draco." Harry's almost luminescent eyes stared back at Draco, smiling and patting the spot next to him. "Sit." He commanded Draco like he was his house elf which Draco wouldn't have appreciated at all if it weren't for the fact Harry leaned over, dragging Draco by his arm and bringing him closer. "Lie down." Draco was going to refuse; Harry couldn't get away with ordering him around, but then he heard a small 'please' and who was Draco to refuse manners? "Turn around."
"I know." Harry sighed, looking down at the ground. "You were joking though, right?" He kicked at the ground, slightly lifting his head to peek at Draco.
Draco gingerly placed his fingers underneath Harry's chin, being painfully aware of the way Harry squirmed, and slowly lifted Harry's head so they were seeing eye to eye. "You're hurt, that isn't nothing."
"You were going to say nobody, you have to tell me now." Draco almost seemed excited, which also would've brightened Harry's mood, if it weren't for the fact Draco's excitement was stemming from Harry's embarrassment.
The younger girls at first paid no attention to the red faced boys and their heavy breathing, or the brightness shining off of them, until Harry-with no warning- burst out into a fit of laughter, his shoulders shaking with him. The girls stopped, staring at him confusedly, before they hurried away as quick as their little legs could take them, whispering harshly to each other. Draco, who couldn't just be like the girls and run away, had no idea of what was so funny, or wrong, gawking at Harry who kept glancing towards Draco as if he was ready to start explaining before no words would come out, only the sounds of his wheezing from the lack of oxygen he was breathing in.
He could feel someone's hand gently, and cautiously, running through his hair, the familiar voice murmuring a song he had never heard before under his breath. Draco then realised he was in fact not sitting up by himself, but instead, his head laying in the singing boy's lap. He would've loved to just pretend he was still unconscious, but his apparent search of where he was had alerted Harry who looked down at Draco and seeing him awake, (unfortunately, Draco drily thought) stopped humming and smiled. "You're awake!"
"I'm a disappointment. I've heard it a million times and I bet I'll hear it another million times. It's like I can never satisfy anyone. Either I'll be hurting my friends or random mudbl- " Draco once again stopped himself from saying the word, glancing at Harry. "-muggles I don't care about or I'll be hurting my parents, not living up to their expectations as a Malfoy or a pure blood."
harry gives draco an impossible offer that he decides to accept, making harry’s life that much more difficult.
Harry had an almost-defiant look on his face, keeping his mouth shut so Draco knew he had to answer for the both of them. "Yes, it's still going on."
Harry didn't react at first, instead, he simply lay back on the bed, making sure Draco wouldn't be able to see in his eyes how stupid he felt at his outburst of confidence.
Harry was so lost in his thoughts that he hadn't even realised Ron and the others had come back until Ron's voice popped up in the silence. "Hey Harry, you coming to dinner?" Harry's curtains were closed, thank God, so Ron didn't see the way Harry's cheeks reddened.
Harry checked behind him, just in case Pansy had decided to follow him outside until he once again bumped into another person.
Harry noticed Draco sitting at one of the tables– of course he was here too, Harry groaned internally– and turned the other way, just so he wouldn't have to make any awkward eye contact with him but Hermione glanced behind him, seeing Draco there and instantly started with her questions. "What's going on with you and Malfoy now? It's like one day the two of you are all over each other then the next, you're both running away."
"How about we talk tonight? At the usual place." Draco suggested, but Harry shook his head. "I'm busy." He deliberately played on Draco's words, seeing the frown appear on Draco's face as he understood why he'd said that.
"Don't we all?" Draco stated the joke with such seriousness that it took Harry seconds, feeling like minutes, before his face broke out into a smile, a heavy laugh pouring out.
"This essay." Draco held it up, the papers flapping around. "Were you on a broom while writing this? Because it's the worst I've ever seen." He didn't even try to sugar-coat his words, saying it as it was.
Harry let his eyes wander back over to where Draco was and saw that Draco was already looking at him. Draco mouthed something along the lines of 'you shall play too knight' before looking away, leaving Harry to decipher what he was saying; did he want them to play Quidditch... or maybe chess?
"That knee needs to be rested so I suggest you go back to your room. Don't overexert it, or yourself. You shouldn't be in any pain, but I do have some pain-relieving potions if you need them."
"You don't need to swear to prove it to me. I've seen your work, it's usually... okay, but this," Draco pointed to it. "This is appalling."
When Harry did zone back into reality, Hermione was giving him a sympathetic smile, like she knew what he was thinking... which she definitely didn't.
"Your lips are so irresistible." Draco dreamily gazed at them, the anger in him slowly dissipating. He was finally able to see a reaction from Harry, though it was one more of horror and confirmation that he had once again messed up. "Please for the love of Salazar, don't say that I've brewed another love potion."
"You're in Hogwarts Potter. Exactly where you were before you fell asleep." Draco's retorts fell out of his mouth smoothly, almost like his thoughts from before had never happened.
Harry was on edge for the rest of the day, thinking of what Draco wanted to say, and when the time came, he found Draco already there as usual.(How long had he been here?)
He didn't turn around to see how Harry looked, he couldn't, because he knew if he did, he wouldn't have the willpower to not run up to him and spill everything that was happening in his brain, but by the time Draco finally turned, Harry had already run off, all left being an empty area.
"I believe he's accidentally brewed a love potion, though I'm not sure how he didn't realise, or how he was able to get affected by it. Amortentia is a difficult—"
He nodded instead which seemed to satisfy Snape for the time being. "We'll see how effective those sessions are soon then. There's an exam coming up, and I hope to see an improvement in those lousy grades of yours." Snape insulted Harry who didn't seem the tiniest bit offended, then gestured for them to leave and turned his back on them as they walked out.
As usual, as soon as he was back on the ground, Harry was ambushed by his friends, hearing congratulations.
Draco heard Harry walk up from behind him, placing a hand on Draco's shoulder. "Not that I'm complaining but... Why did you just kiss me?"
Harry's mind is occupied with thoughts of Draco, but in order for him to keep it a secret, he may need to be more cautious about when, and where, he gets closer to him.
He froze, hearing Harry's breaths getting heavier on his neck, but now he was stuck in a position where his hip was digging into the bed, so he adjusted one more time- only once (or twice)- and regretted it when he heard a groan come from the person behind him, saying "Draco," in a kind of warning tone on the edge of arousal and cautioning. Harry pulled him closer than Draco thought was even possible, letting Draco feel his erection even more, showing the lack of shame Harry had. "If you keep moving, I won't last the night."
