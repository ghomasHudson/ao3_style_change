‘Or you bleed out. To death.’ Ron muttered.
- Nevertheless, the chambers are for Your Highness’ disposal, m’lord.
‘Harry, dear, slow down please. We don’t understand half of what you’re talking about…’ Narcisa was looking somehow ashamed of herself.
‘Why am I even with you…?’ Draco sighed but it was obvious he was just joking. ‘So far, I’ve been reduced to a housewife, a rather poor one at that.’
‘How am I supposed to know? I have never baked in my life! Go add more, I think since this looks dry you might have not used enough.’
‘Water doesn’t count! It’s water, what is it going to do anyway?’
- I probably shouldn’t tell you this, but she wasn’t lying for you. She lied to get back to the castle and find me, she knew the only way she was going back was if you were dead and this was a victory parade.
‘Fuck!’ He exclaimed, colliding with concrete. As soon as he stepped back, the wall disappeared. ‘Guess they didn’t foresee me being here for anything other than stealing something…’
‘You don’t ask questions here, Potter.’ Malfoy was now towering over Harry. ‘I repeat: where have you been?’
, Weasley. I’ve seen people crack during questioning. People who haven’t said a single word otherwise.’
‘Ready for this?’ Harry asked smiling.
‘Admit it, you’re a twink.’
- What the fuck, Malfoy? Are you trying to kill me? What was that? – It was safe to assume Potter was fine. He wouldn’t be able to yell at Draco like he did if the antidote didn’t work.
- Oh, ok. I wasn’t sure Draco told you. And call me Theo. Anyway, if we’re on the topic, I don’t know how you feel about it, but from my end I want you to know you don’t need to worry about it. It was one mistake, we never should’ve done it and it was a long time ago. – He looked somehow out of countenance. – And besides, we… - He hesitated. – We’re not compatible. We’re into different things there, if you know what I mean.
- Then let’s start now. – Harry seemed determined.
- Oh, that you do, no doubt. And rather expertly at that if one is to believe what was said by… - Harry didn’t hear the end of that sentence. He was out the door as fast as he could without raising suspicions.
- Oh, I see how it’s going to be. So I’m “Wesley” now, huh? It’s a good thing you two ended up together I suppose, you’re turning out to be just as much of a pompous, self-absorbed bastard as your – he spat – boyfriend.
‘I have to do this. If you’re willing to go for it and try the transfusion at all, I will give you my blood and that is final. You said it yourself, we will both survive this.’
‘Now, I do realize, Mr. Malfoy, that you are probably quite anxious right now…’ The Minister spoke again ‘but I do need to address a few issues before receiving a verdict has clouded your, or the prosecution’s, judgements. Mr. Potter, let me start with you. What you did during this case was at best irresponsible. It might even fall under gross misconduct. I want you to know that I will be filing a report with the Chief of the Auror Office and urging him to take appropriate action against you – you
‘You did WHAT?! Do you have any idea what this means?! You just blew this whole thing! I’m going over there and telling him that at this point it’s either me or you! He gives Draco a job and I stay or I’m quitting!’
‘More or less…’ Ron coughed as another cloud of smoke from whatever Malfoy was indulging in filled the room. ‘What are you smoking anyway?’
- I tried to convince myself I can’t feel anything towards you because I have to hate you, but after the last one it all just drained from me. I couldn’t pretend anymore.
‘I was, but I popped over to Harry’s on the way and he’s acting weird…’ He plopped down on a chair beside his wife. ‘I’m starting to get worried.’
- The Ravenclaw got scared as far as I know. I didn’t get much from Draco about it, but from what I gathered, he thought it was too intense for him and backed out. That’s why Draco was drinking so much then and… you know… - Nott was trying to force Pansy to drop the subject just by looking at her. Harry knew why.
Fair warning: It turns kind of violent towards the end (depending on how you look at it).
‘We do, Minister. I’m sorry for my outburst.’
- What did you just say? – Harry tried to step out from behind his boyfriend to stand next to him, but Draco’s outstretched arm stopped him.
desired, and that his slip-up with the quote would go unnoticed – if Draco knew how Harry felt, he would back out of the situation faster than it took to disapparate. He sighed and glanced at the clock – his meeting was due in five minutes, so he left the room without even glancing at Ron sitting at the second desk.
‘Actually, he hasn’t told anybody anything. Just that he has ran into you and you were in a very dark place. He wanted to help you get back on your feet, you know?!’
‘The matter at hand today is the case held by the Auror Office, represented by Auror Ronald Bilius Weasley, versus Draco Lucius Malfoy.’ Kingsley started ‘Am I correct that the accused, to be questioned right now, is Draco Lucius Malfoy, son of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy, age 20, born June 5
‘I told you a thousand times, I didn’t do it!’
- Oh, so you’ve looked enough to determine that? – The Slytherins were cackling, Hermione looked like she was about to burst out crying and Ron was reaching for his wand.
‘Self-transfiguration and glamour charms.’
‘I can, Mr. Weasley, and I just did. This is not your decision to make. And your refusal to obey by my orders on this, is precisely why you will be working with Mr. Longbottom from now on. Now, Mr. Potter, seeing as Mr. Malfoy will
- So I should just make friends in Slytherin and talk to them?
‘Even now. I don’t know how you managed to get Harry to trust you. How did you?’
- Normal people do. – Harry said bitterly.
‘I don’t know, it was weird so it stuck.’
- Draco, we all know how you feel about what Thomas was talking about. But that’s no reason to kill someone… – Nott was hesitant.
‘I fucked up, Draco, I fucked up big time…’ He whispered. He couldn’t even bring himself to look at the man. ‘I’m so sorry…’ He was bracing himself for tears, when suddenly he felt he was being wrapped in Draco’s arms, pressed into his chest.
- Stop being stupid. – Pansy was getting angry. – You know whose room that is, you know what happened in Charms and you know the history. It’s obvious what happened and if you had half a brain cell you’d know why it did.
‘But you had someone, you could always come to me.’
- I’m not. This time I want this for myself and myself only. Taking long showers just doesn’t do it for me anymore, you know? – Harry smiled suggestively.
- Oh, so you have no faith in your new boytoy, do you? You’re scared he’ll lose? Oh, wait, I forgot, you’re the…
‘Based solely on your hunch…’ Potter sounded bitter.
- Where did you get this idea anyway? Are you suicidal?
It was already August when both Harry and Draco finally received responses to the job applications they’ve sent weeks prior. Harry was offered a year-long training position in the Auror office under the leadership of John Dawlish, without having to undergo formal testing and training (Harry suspected that his actions during the war seemed enough for the Ministry to forgo the official path of career in his case and he hoped Ron would receive the same treatment).
- Good God Potter, this is too advanced for your limited brain power! – Why was he insulting Potter anyway? – This is a manual for the Healer training! You’re barely scraping by in N.E.W.Ts!
‘I don’t know, I just have this feeling that something is off. Like he’s going to come after someone and it won’t end well.’
coincidence…’
The second blow came a week later. Harry was eating dinner when Ron and Hermione stepped into his kitchen. It was obvious that Ron was furious.
‘I’ve never… I’ve never had that.’
- And I have only made eggs and hot dogs at the Dursley’s!
- I don’t know, all right?! – He was yelling again. – It all just came out of me last night, like something broke! What are you getting at anyway?
‘Maybe, but how would they know if they didn’t go there following something that happened?’
Faintly, Harry felt the ghost of the other man’s fingers on his own, like an imprint of what they shared back at the Manor. He didn’t know how or why, but the sensation provided him with a sudden wave of strength – very meek, in fact, not even enough to open his eyes, but in his current state it was a lot. Concentrating as hard as he could, Harry raised his hand and tangled his fingers in the blond strands next to him. He felt Draco stiffen under the touch.
- Who, not what. – Draco corrected him gently. – Ask yourself, if I were to tell you right now that I can, let’s say until the end of the weekend, take care of you, look out for you and guide you through everything, and you wouldn’t need to decide anything, would that sound good or bad to you?
He hated feeling this way. He knew it’s not normal, he knew he should be happy all of the darkness was behind him now and he knew that he should join in on the collective sigh of relief the wizarding world breathed. But he couldn’t and didn’t. And in those rare moments he managed not to blame himself, he blamed Voldemort and his Death Eaters. And now, one of those same Death Eaters that caused his life to be what it was, was sitting there, like nothing ever happened, in his own room, in his only true home ever, every bloody night. If his hatred was even possible to qualify, he hated Malfoy most of them all – for the fact that he got out without so much as a scratch on his criminal record (“minor my ass” Harry muttered under his breath) and for the fact that the fucking wanker had the AUDACITY to show his slime-y face back.
That same night, Draco was sitting on the floor between Nott’s and Zabini’s beds. Zabini was spending the night in the Hospital Wing having a broken arm mended after Neville’s mis-cast spell tipped over a cabinet in Charms class and it landed on Zabini.
- Yeah, sure… - She didn’t buy it. Of course she didn’t, she wasn’t stupid.
year Gryffindors. Looking at them he began wondering if he too looked that small and innocent at their age. God, it seemed like eons ago, he couldn’t believe he was only 5 years older than them. They looked like they weren’t old enough to be out of their parents’ care – even if that care was exchanged for being looked after by a whole body of staff and house elves.
It was almost an hour later when Kingsley, Ron and Neville emerged from the pensive for the second time – if it was possible, they looked even more horrified and shocked than before: Neville’s face had a sickly greenish tinge to it and Ron was visibly shaking.
‘I did. When we were hunting the horcruxes, we didn’t have a set route to follow…’ Harry hesitated.
‘On the incidents in places the snatchers turned up in. Apparently, there were several.’
‘Actually, Draco, it’s not dangerous for a person giving the blood.’ Harry seemed firm.
It was nearly three weeks into their stay at the Manor, when Harry and Draco finally managed to sit down to discuss their future work plans, both with each other, and with Narcissa.
‘You like your guys with no sugar, in your own words, you have a daddy kink…’
‘Well, I suppose…’ She hesitated. ‘Frankly, Harry, I’m still not convinced about all of this, but then again, I don’t really know Draco or his mother…’
‘Yes, Mrs. Wesley, we’ve been together for some time now and we’re moving in together once the jobs start.’
Harry pressed the tip of his wand against Draco’s lip. They were standing so close that Draco could clearly smell that familiar mixture of scents he first encountered in Potter’s bed. Suddenly, it was way too warm in the room again. He braced himself for another hard-on, but to his surprise, nothing happened. Only when Potter stepped back there was that cold breeze again. Draco flinched and walked to the bathroom to look in the mirror.
- Oh, Harry, hello. – She started hesitantly.
‘Whatever it is, if it’s going to hurt him more than what we’ve done so far, than it’s not even an option!’ Harry stood up.
‘Why are we even talking about this?’ Suddenly, Potter was looking ashamed and slightly angry. ‘Aren’t there any other topics for conversation?’
‘Think logically, father.’ He quickly composed himself. ‘With all they’ve used against you, they need new evidence to keep you here. Where would they go first? My guess is – the Manor. So I’m asking, is it completely empty or do I have to go there to get rid of things they haven’t managed to find yet? I have watched the house being emptied and all the secret storage I knew about, they found. But if there is something else, something only you knew about, you have to tell me…’
‘This is
‘Wow…’ Draco still looked shocked. ‘So we’re really doing this? How does it work from now on? I stay behind a desk while you go catch the bad guys or what? And what about Weasley? What did your boss say?’
be employed as an Auror, he will not have all the privileges and duties you have. I will not, however, inquire how you two divide the work between yourselves, as long as all the reports and paperwork are signed by you and you only, and any court cases that may arise will be prosecuted on your own – Mr. Malfoy will have no standing as a prosecutorial representative in court. Other than that, you are free to work together as you would with Mr. Weasley. And please, leave whatever it is that you have with Mr. Malfoy, at home. I do not condone office romances or public displays of affection.’ Harry was too ecstatic with the prospect of him and Draco working together to even be bothered that now, apparently, even his boss believed that there was something between them.
. Treat it as a trial period. If anything goes wrong or isn’t done according to proper procedures, you will both be fired, do we understand each other?’
- Muggle thing. You order food from some place, like a bar or a restaurant, and get it delivered to your house.
‘Of course. How often does a suspect solve his own case better than the Aurors that have a whole institution behind them?’
of you?’
‘The Underground?’ Draco looked unimpressed. ‘So we walk in sewer lines?’
‘Well, Mr. Malfoy, there is a catch… The residence in question is your childhood home.’
‘He was sure he had me, didn’t he?’
‘I’m…’ Draco didn’t know what to say. He was scared, he didn’t want to do it, but he knew this was the only option if he was to prove that he didn’t know anything.
- It matters. You don’t become a Death Eater when you’re a good person. It’s not what the mark caused, it’s what led to it being there.
‘Me? What did I do?’
- And you diluted it with draught of peace?!
‘At what?’
- On the contrary, Mr. Potter. The fact that this is the most private room available simply means that there would be fewer distractions from your former classmates to provoke, even unintentionally, any kind of tension between you two. I trust you noticed the rest of the rooms have for instance one bathroom per two rooms, whereas you and Mr. Malfoy have a luxury of having your own?
- No, you’re normal. It’s normal to want to be in charge… - Harry protested weakly.
‘And if you were to plan this? Without the
‘Hold on, I think Ron wrote a list at some point’ Harry stretched over Draco’s lap to reach to the other side of the couch for another stack of parchments. Suddenly, it felt very warm in the room. ‘Yeah, here it is.’ Harry sat straight up again and handed Draco a list.
He felt something warm on his forehead, he was tired.  He was in a comfortable bed, he didn't remember going to sleep;  but he didn't care and he would go back to sleep but those voices wouldn't let him.  He then he opened his eyes and saw the two people.  A man with black hair and a woman with beautiful red hair who, just by looking, you could tell, was scolding him.
"This belonged to your grandfather Abraxas"  I caught his attention as Dobby appeared and handed a small velvety box to Narcissa, who placed it in front of Draco's face, who was curiously watching her expectantly " He gave it to your father when he began his course  at Hogwarts and now it's yours.
"But you didn't say that ...!"
For that reason he did not want to be there.
- Good morning and welcome to the creature shop!  I'm John and it's a pleasure to serve you, ”she said as she gave a slight nod as he left the counter and stood in front of them.  What are you looking for?  .
"Dobby will bring it right away, mistress Narcissa!"  - and in a plop disappeared.
-A winter coat.
She already owed them too much.
"Are you okay."  She made a sideways face.  Although she noticed the tinge of pain when mentioning Lucius she did not say anything, she knew that not having her father at that moment affected him -as long as he is not a basilisk we can take him- she said with a touch of humor taking a  smile.  in Draco.
"What happened?  If you can say it ”it was unnecessary to point out that her son (despite her initial disgust) did not like to say certain things to anyone, not even her.  Better to ask if he was comfortable speaking.
Something strange was happening.
They were supposed to be visiting his father at St. Mungo's at the time, he had been so happy to see him;  he spent weeks choosing the outfit he would wear (Sirius and his mother helped him, although he said he didn't do it alone).  I plan everything I would say to him, like his godfather taking him on a walk in the fields to collect ingredients for his potions (it was a lot of fun, I even let him make a wreath of flowers! Of flowers!), That his mother showed him  new moves on the broom (although he only did a few), that his uncles took him to some Muggle games (great fun! I love to ride the Ferris wheel and eat cotton candy) that was in Germany.  That he finally got Castor and Pollux to behave (those troublemakers left him several scratches).
"Oh!  I'm Draco" with her flushed cheeks I shake his hand.
After leaving the creature store, they went to buy their robes for Hogwarts from Madame Malkins, where they were greeted and cared for by a somewhat older lady.
Her head ached and she kept running until, horrified, she felt them approaching her.
" This is the room, where mom and dad hold meetings and parties for important events " he said while taking slight turns imitating a dance and humming a song only heard by him.
His hands itched, his heart began to beat very fast, he felt cold and was short of breath;  he was seeing more and more blur.
He was angry.  Very angry.
"Thank you puppy," Remus replied kindly, as he raised them to his mouth.
"I don't know, but" I turn her face away from her shoulder from her mother's and look at her, I think it's him.
"Oh darling, it's good that you wake up" he calmly approached Draco and sat in front of him "we worried a lot when you didn't wake up."
His family mostly went to Slytherin it was almost a tradition for them to stay in that house.  Although he knew very well that his parents did not care in the house that was left.
"They weren't a bother at all!"  You can also visit us whenever you want, it will be a pleasure to have you here.
-Of course, the classes are about to start and it is very nice that they bring a friend to spend their days away from home -she spoke happily as she beckoned them to follow- -And what would you like to bring?
-Fantastic Animals and Where to Find Them, Newt Scamander.
The very thought that someone would be his friend filled him with a strange feeling but one that made him happy.
Books
At the time he was in the garden of the Malfoy mansion, chasing Alvin turkeys along with his uncle Regulus.  His mother, Snape and his uncles Sirius and Remus were in a little game of Quidditch (although in reality they were only his mother and Remus, since his godfather found it boring and Sirius is forbidden to ride a broom)  .  When suddenly a grayish owl came in and stood in front of him, causing the turkeys to flee probably relieved to be left alone, or perhaps they were simply afraid of the bird.
The woman laughingly took his measurements and adjusted the sleeves;  the way she worked she showed that she loved him.
"Just ... "he whispered as he took the arm that her mother offered her " maybe I won't be as alone as she thought.
-Of course it took a long time but I don't regret it -she calmly released it as she took out a phoenix and caressed it- Everyone needs a home and someone who loves them.  And it doesn't seem fair to me that they don't have a lot of conscience in their hunting and fear of them.
And then there was nothing.
They kept talking about normal things (as normal as it could be) such as their mother's visit recently to the couple's house to congratulate them on the next member of the pack, or the antics they did in their adolescence and the scolding received.  by Severus and Regulus, who never listened.
Her mother just smiled, kissed her forehead and caressed Apodis.  She took her hand and they walked over to the fireplace.
Lily simply gave him a warm smile and put her hand on Draco's shoulder.
When she released those words, it was as if everything around her had stopped, the clock stopped ticking, the birds stopped flapping her wings;  her breathing stopped.
-A pair of protective gloves.
"Yeah, though we weren't supposed to do it this day separately" He stopped abruptly. They weren't things he was supposed to tell anyone but, Draco had the strangest feeling that he could tell these things to Harry;  He hoped he wasn't wrong " today, we were supposed to visit my father at St. Mungo's.  Still bad and I planned everything we would do when I saw him but " - suddenly he stopped when he felt a lump form in his throat.
"I know Lily already reported it to the ministry."  He sounded nervous as he tried to calm the redhead that he assumed was Lily.
Parents are reminded that freshmen cannot have their own brooms.
"Mom," the little boy spoke in a low voice.  "Who was the cute boy in the yard?"
-"They are ... blank" he said surprised by the gift received.
"That's right," he exclaimed with an angry expression, which was so adorable for both men that they did not hesitate to give him some kind smiles.
" Uncle Sirius!  Uncle Remus! " He shouted happily as he ran into the open arms of the aforementioned who carried him and laughed in an almost animal way.
That said, they both went to the creature store, it was a somewhat new establishment compared to the others, it stood out a lot, the reason for this was its striking colors.  From a garish orange that formed clouds, a range of blues that cascaded backwards, to an explosion of flowers painted in all colors except purple.
-1 wand
Narcissa just sighs and shakes her head, asking Circe for strength.  They stop walking, so that she crouches gracefully at the height of her son.
-1 brass scale.
-1 pewter cauldron number
Apparently the man's name was James.  Very ugly name in his opinion.
Seeing that the spells didn't work, both adults paled.
"Pretty boy? You mean Draco?"  I ask, receiving an affirming sound "Why are you asking Harry?"  She found it strange that her son was interested in the boy, when every time someone came to her house, she just didn't care.
All students must have a copy of the following books:
"A locket?" he asked as he pulled her hand away from Apodis' beak that was trying to take it.
It won't be long to start the true story ~³●
He was very, very bored.
She walked gracefully (or as much as she could at the time).  When he knew that they could not see him he hurried to look for the door, it did not take long and when he opened it he discovered that it was the one he was looking for, without further ado he opened it and went out into the garden.
He felt let down, betrayed, and many other things.  With those feelings he went (without looking at her) with his mother to Diagon Alley.  They could say that it was an exaggeration (although the truth mattered little to him) but his anger was very well justified, very very well justified.
No. I was not happy.

Hogwarts, there goes Draco Malfoy!
In front of him you could see three figures.  A tall man, with a sharp face and long blond hair tied with a ribbon, a serious look but with a slight smile.  He wore a dark blue robe with silver and green accents;  In his right hand she held a cane with a golden serpentine hilt.  Next to him a woman with darker blond hair, neatly tied, in a blue tunic and navy blue dress, right in the middle of both a smiling little blond wearing a suit of the same color as the other two.
But not.  When going down to breakfast (because in a few hours they were going to leave) his mother told him that they could not go to see him, a letter from the healer who attended to his father said that, apparently, he had relapsed and they would  .  You have to check him again and take care of him, he could not have visitors.  And he was angry not because of what his mother said that she also seemed gloomy because of the news, no;  Rather, he felt angry with himself, for not having done something so that his father was not in that place, for being useless, for not having been him instead of his father.  Because he loves him and he's afraid of never seeing him again.
And before either of them could say their best, Draco heard his mother call him from afar.
Without further ado he got up wiping the knees of his pants, the last thing he wanted was for his mother to scold him for dirtying her clothes (although he knew she would never do it under the circumstances).  With nothing else to do out there, she a little more relaxed she returned to the house.  She glanced at the handful of chewed rose petals she'd left behind.
"I'll see that son of ..." I keep silent at the serious look that was directed from her husband who without the need for words told him not in front of the children, you idiot!  Which is why she just gave him a soft kiss on the lips, causing Draco to grimace;  that she just made him laugh.
Right in the center of the ceiling, illuminating the place was a crystal chandelier;  Draco liked to look at it and imagine it was the sun and try to reach for it.  He remembers that he almost fell from the stairs trying to reach him, luckily his parents were not at home and his uncle did not tell them anything.
They were running and running;  without scales.  At one point he was playing with his mother and uncle while they were eating chocolate frogs and some muggle sweets and suddenly everything turned dark and cold, he saw some large dark things floating in the direction of the small group that was in the middle of the immense flowered field  where he was running before he froze.  The adults, noticing this, drew their wands pointing at the creatures that were getting closer and closer.
" You're doing the shopping for Hogwarts right?  Harry asked curiously as he climbed onto the platform that was to the left of him and let them take his measurements.
"And this ... " He ran as he floated in front of a huge painting on a marble fireplace "is dad.
They walked what was left to reach the door, where they were immediately greeted by Regulus who smiled at them.  He greeted Narcissa with a soft hug and hugged Draco tighter who returned the hug a little softer.
"I'm very sorry, I was distracted" Saying that he was embarrassed was not enough, because he was in the thoughts of him he did not realize that they had already reached Diagon Alley and he did not realize the way.
Draco was excited, he would see Harry and Pansy again (with whom he still communicated by letters but few, since he was in America with his parents on a vacation trip).  Everything was ready in his trunk, he checked thousands of times to make sure he didn't forget anything at home.
"Take a good look inside the box Draco"  Narcissa answered without further ado.

He carried Apodis on his shoulder (he did not want to take him in a cage, besides he would not like to be locked up for hours and hours) he went down to the living room, standing next to his mother, ready to go.
"Mother" he said trembling as he clung tightly to his chest that was soaked from the tears he had shed.
"Draco dear," said a thin voice, low, in an elegant tone;  as he took the little one by the shoulders, making his eyes go to the beautiful aristocratic face of his mother, who saw him with a small but elegant smile.  Unable to help it, he returned her. "I know you don't want to be here, but I have to talk to Regulus about something important and I couldn't leave you with Severus.  So I hope you behave okay?
He smiled at what Harry was doing.
And as Narcissa continued to speak, she slowly positioned the small box in Draco's hands who slowly opened it.
Apparently, she was wrong, from the look of horror on Draco's face.
He fixed his gaze on the place, there were some plants here and there, very well cut grass;  some brooms thrown on the corner of a railing, nothing that attracted so much attention, he would have said something (as if they had some daffodils and carnations on the door) if he did not feel that he would die at any moment;  so without further ado, he walked over to a small white rose bush and knelt in front of the volume two roses and put them on the ground, closed his eyes, took out a pen and began to murmur while writing all over his right arm 11 times and then  did the same with the right.  Then he took the roses and began to remove each petal, put it in his mouth and spat it out.  He spent a while doing that until he calmed down, slightly opened his eyes and noticed that he could breathe easily again.
But before he could feel calmed by his mother's caresses, one of those things approached them.  There were screams and terror.
Making his uncle immediately take a firm and serious pose like all good purebloods (in Draco's opinion) and nod gently.  They both said goodbye to Regulus's office, promising to go out for a walk and eat chocolates afterwards.  So with nothing else to do Draco sat on the big charcoal sofa and asked Kreacher to bring some mint chocolate chip cookies;  who after a plop disappeared and with another plop appeared, handing him a plate with the cookies that after a bow he left.
"Don't fear Dragon, Mom is here," he whispered softly, and she placed a sweet kiss on his blond head.  No matter what, he would protect them, and if he faced a dark lord like that, he would not let anything happen to his dragon.
Excited, he took the letter and the owl left without further consideration, he ran jumping and screaming low towards his mother who, noticing that the owl was heading towards him, quickly lowered himself to the blanket where Severus was reading and Sirius eating, followed by Remus  .  who she approached to help her husband in the comfort of her and not eat too much.  Regulus also joined the mission "not to let Sirius eat Snape's candy because he's a bitter old man and he breaks their ass", which made Sirius angry and told them that they would kill their baby if they didn't let him eat.  sweets and his godfather.  he simply rolled his eyes and, to Sirius' horror, looked at him as he ate the candy.
"Mother!" She snapped in horror, "How can you believe I could take Pollux and Castor from my father ?!"  -because although she took care of them they were not hers (or at least not entirely) she also knows that if her father returns home she will feel bad if he does not find them;  because she knows that he will come home.
"Welcome, I suppose you are coming for robes for Hogwarts," she said as she led him to a dais.
"Draco I'll go buy some things, I'll wait for you near the bookstore" Narcissa mentioned as she left the store, leaving Draco alone.
Lily was moved to see the scene in front of her eyes.  She like every mother knows what, the mere thought that something bad happens to her son is fatal.
He was more focused on not exploding the Potters' cute white china cups and multicolored bird drawings when he suddenly felt it.
"We won't leave you here!"  Draco tried desperately to get to him, but before he could, his mother grabbed him around the waist and started running as fast as she could.  And upon realizing it, she could no longer see Regulus.
After wiping his face and pulling himself off her mother's lap, he stood next to her to her left.  Looking emotionlessly at the two adults in front of him.  Even he was somewhat exalted by what had happened, so they couldn't blame him that his magic was restless;  moving the cups that Mrs. Potter had given them so they could speak calmly.  His mother was talking to them about something he was not paying attention to, despite answering briefly each time she was asked something.
Intrigued, he looked carefully at the box again, where he could find a deck of cards.

Therefore, when she saw the dementors in front of them and Narcissa about to collapse protecting her son, she did not hesitate for a second to intervene to save them.  Then came her husband, who when she saw her flee knew that something was happening and confirmed it when she saw Narcissa on the floor, breathing with difficulty and very pale, without kneeling more to slowly pick her up and take her towards her house.
I was restless.
We are pleased to inform you that he has a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Consider the equipment list and necessary books.  Classes begin on September 1.  We expect the owl from him before July 31st.
The days passed in a sigh, between games in the mansion together with Apodis, Pollux and Castor;  visits to number twelve Grimmauld place, tutorials with his mother and Snape (who left him a month and a half before classes start to get some things in order for Hogwarts), letters from his father telling him about how he hated Saint Mungo or about  what they would do when he left and Harry who every time they arrived rejoiced, telling him about the adventures he had with the marauders (a group made up of Mr. Potter "antlers", his uncle Remus "lunatic", Mr. Peter "wormtail", his  Uncle Sirius "joint" and Regulus along with his godfather) who were full of jokes and letters where he simply talked about what happened in his day.  The latter seemed pretty to him, some with a few words saying that he hated eating cabbages or that he had seen a very pretty flower and others, with almost two meters of parchment asking him how he was doing or how cute the name of his Augurey was;  it's time to go to Hogwarts.
Before the abrupt appearance he was speechless, the features of the boy in front of him seemed familiar;  but it wasn't until he stared into his eyes that he could remember from where.
But of course!  if they were identical to the eyes of Mrs. Potter (or Lily as she said to call her) although these eyes in front of him seemed darker and brighter.  So intent was he on watching him that he didn't notice he hadn't returned the salute until Harry waved his hand again without even removing the huge smile he wore.
And with a smile they said goodbye and disappeared from the place.
I was scared.
(See the end of the chapter for
When I ran, I visualize the dementors very close to them, horrible beings capable of exhausting your happiness and good times;  besides throwing you into an abyss of decaying madness.  Narcissa wouldn't let something happen to them.  She certainly did not know how they could be in this place, when the Ministry had them as much controlled (or as much as possible) housed in Askaban to torture the prisoners.
While he was still waiting for his robes, he took the opportunity to talk to Harry;  They talked about varied and funny topics, such as the jokes that Harry made with his uncles and father or the excursions that Draco took with his godfather, his uncles and parents.  They had arranged to send letters to each other what was left of the holidays before going to Hogwarts and promising to meet again on the train and even though they would not stay in the same house, they would be friends, friends!
The moment they returned from Diagon Alley they took different paths.  Narcissa had to attend to matters pertaining to the family's business.  Unlike what some might think;  Narcissa helped her husband with everything, she always was and will be her right hand at work, as well as in daily life.
- "Merlin, for a second I thought…" he let out a sigh of relief and spoke in a low voice and started walking. "Well, never mind let's go Draco, where do you want to go first?"
- Anyone who is not too dangerous - Narcissa said as she looked at the crystals where all kinds of creatures were found, from Dragon eggs to Acromantula babies - I am curious that you have all these creatures in this place, my husband likes to take care of everything  Kind of creatures but you have permission issues, I guess you managed to get the permission right?
‘What does sex with a woman feel like?’ There. This was bound to shut Potter up.
‘Why? You’d like me to be into you? For what?’
- I… I don’t know, Harry. I love you, I really do, but my actions ever since the beginning don’t paint a pretty picture. I don’t know if I’ll be able to change, to control all the violence that’s in me. I’ve been in this cycle for years now, you can’t just shake it off. Frankly, I don’t know if we can do this.
‘Oh, brilliant! That’s just bloody fucking great!’
- No, no. – Draco laughed. – I’m just saying maybe you talk to Granger. Wesley doesn’t seem like the type of guy that would give solid love advice.
‘I’m not sure I know what you’re getting at.’
‘Appreciated.’ With that, Harry slid off the windowsill and left Malfoy alone. He needed to do some thinking on his own.
‘I know, Mrs. Wesley. And I’d really like to change that at some point – you’ve always been like a mother to me, so it would mean a lot to me if you could stand by us…’ He was interrupted by Ron and Hermione rushing in. Molly saw them, sent Harry a slightly saddened smile and left.
- What do you want to know then? How many boyfriends I had?
‘Oh, well, ok. So I’ll escort Malfoy down to the courtroom, we’ll get this done, and we’ll go back to my place to wait for the rest to be dealt with. Can either of you message me when the other depositions are done at least?’ Harry gave up. There was no way they were going to let him take part in the other depositions.
- So, Harry, what’s the problem? – Hermione was just now climbing down from Ron’s lap to sit next to him on her bed.
- It’s not running away from being an adult. It’s just that you sometimes want to not be in charge of anything, sometimes you want to, like you said, be taken care of. – Draco’s expression softened. His eyes were careful and somehow… tender? – You really think everyone wants all the glory and recognition all the time?
Not only has he been seen sobbing like a child on the floor, begging for drugs, but he was ready to sell himself, yet again, to Potter of all people, to survive. And somehow this was worse than when he actually did it over a year before – because this time there was no tricking, there was no Yasmine, it was clearly and undeniably him, in his own skin. His brain, seemingly on its own accord, decided to torture him with a mental image of Potter’s reaction when he found out who Yasmine really was, side by side with the memory of Draco being just left there last night. Last night was incomparably worse, that much Draco knew for sure. And then, out of nowhere, Weasley’s face, painted with utter shock and horror, swam into his head:
‘That happened ten minutes ago, Potter. So you’ve been bi-curious for ten minutes and now all of a sudden you’re into me?’
‘Slow down, Draco. We can work together like I would do with Ron normally, so you can join me in groundwork, but all the paperwork is to be signed by me only. And you can’t stand in court with me. Other than that, we’re free to figure it out for ourselves. Of course, they’ll be watching us closely, because now apparently even the Chief thinks we’re
‘Now you’re the one that’s lying.’
‘Where have they surfaced so far?’ Draco slid gracefully off the counter and crammed next to Potter on the couch, bending over a hastily drawn map. ‘Ok, so it seems like they’re steering clear from any big cities and communities with a large number of wizards… Now, do you have any dates? It might be useful to track when they went where, there might be a pattern somewhere.’
- God… yes… I can’t… - Harry slammed his fist into the shower wall. God, that sight was irresistible. – Fuck… fuck… Draco… please… more…
‘Malfoy happened…’ Ron scowled.
- I’m sorry… I came… so fast… - It was still difficult to figure out what Harry was saying through the laboured breathing.
‘No?’ Potter was fully looking at him by now.
‘Somehow, I don’t trust you. I’m going to stay here until I’m convinced you’re stable enough to be left alone.’
- Of a what? – Harry couldn’t wrap his head around it.
‘Interesting… You haven’t been
- So…?
- I don’t know.
‘You and me, tonight. Neutral ground, let’s say Grimmauld Place, if Harry’s ok with it. It can be just us, or you can bring Longbottom and I’ll bring Harry. Veritaserum. Both of us drink it and we hammer it all out. After that, you lay off us.’
‘Maybe you’re right. But I’m still not completely convinced everyone will be as pleasant as the Weasleys.’
‘No.’
‘Yeah. He started out by yelling at me for using the keys he gave us. He said I was acting like I owned his house or something. And then he admitted he’s been drinking and said it was my fault…’
- So, you feel well enough to tell me what the hell happened? – He really needed to know what caused Harry to nearly kill himself.
He moved to leave the room, but the Minister’s voice stopped him.
‘It is!’ Draco was getting excited. Plotting schemes was, after all, a very Slytherin thing to do. ‘You see, if I know that the testimony might be thrown out, the Auror Office would know too, right? So what would they do? They would look for other evidence to keep my father in prison, even with Rowle’s and Yaxley’s confessions not usable anymore – and the first thing they would do is go search the house. Enter me – I’m supposed to want my father out of prison, so I need to clear the house of anything that might implicate him. And to do that I need to know where to look, what to look for and how to get rid of it quickly.’
- So that’s why you always direct all the other Slytherins? – Harry knew he shouldn’t ask that question, but he couldn’t stop himself.
‘Just came for the last box of my cases.’ Ron muttered seemingly to no one.
‘What?! Who?! How?!’ Harry was panicking.
‘No. There’s no way anyone is smoking in this apartment.’
‘No, seriously.’
It was just Malfoy’s luck that barely 30 seconds after that thought came to him, when he looked at the dorm room arrangements posted on the board in the common room, he saw “Malfoy, Draco Lucius” next to “Potter, Harry James” in big, scarlet (because, of course, she had to favour bloody Gryffindors yet again!) letters on the list. He sneered again. It was his bloody luck.
Harry didn’t know what to think. He just knew he had to talk to his boyfriend in private. Without a word he stood up, took Draco’s hand and led him into their bedroom.
- But what? – Ron chimed in. – If he’s not acting up than what is it?
Safely back in his bedroom, Harry threw himself onto the bed and buried his face into a pillow. The confession he just blurted out without thinking burned like molten metal. Why exactly did he say this? It’s not like he has ever even thought about who his best sex was with. And even now, once he had the chance to consider this question a little more, the answer he gave made no sense. Not only did he never felt what Draco said sex should feel like, but even within his limited scope of experiences what they had was average at best. He had had much more intense orgasms with several girls, and what Draco, no – Yasmine, did, was far from what Normani was capable of. He was being stupid, he thought, it was just residual hatred he still must have had stored away somewhere, that just came out, purely to mess with Malfoy’s head, acting on instinct.
- Pity you didn’t get together sooner, it would have been fun! – Nott was laughing.
‘Will you let it go? I do not have a daddy kink!’
‘No problem, it’s the truth. Now, since we have the job side of it figured out, do you still want my other place? I’m not using it, so it’s up for grabs really. Although I warn you, it’s rather depressing.’
‘Wait, what?’
- Takeout? – Draco looked confused.
you…’ Harry tried to stop Ron, but it was too late – he managed to get out a big enough portion of a question for Veritaserum in Draco to work.
‘Mr. Malfoy, I appreciate it, but none of those are valid options in this case. Legilimency can be blocked and Veritaserum can be used in strictly controlled conditions, under very specific circumstances so as to assure only the necessary information is revealed, and nothing more.’ Harry glared at Ron. ‘However, since you say you’re willing to do whatever it takes to clear any suspicions, I will have to ask you for your memories.’
Harry felt the real, present-time Draco shaking looking at the scene. He took the blonde’s hand, linking their fingers together. It was cold as a corpse and trembling.
‘But you are not sure, and Mr. Malfoy is firmly denying everything?’
‘You’re not a monster, Draco.’ Harry wiped his tears away. ‘They forced you to do this. If anyone knows how Voldemort really is, it’s me, and I know you had no choice. It doesn’t change my opinion of you.’
- Sir, I… - the words got stuck up in his throat. He was a Malfoy for God’s sake, Malfoys didn’t beg! – I was wondering if maybe I could exchange some labour for some bread. You see, I just came to London – it was safer to just pretend he came from somewhere else and that’s why he was sleeping on a park bench. After all, it wasn’t really that much of a lie, Muggle world was a very different place to where he used to live – and I haven’t got any money, but I really need some food.
- That doesn’t mean you’re innocent! The fact that Snape was the one to kill Dumbledore doesn’t make you any less guilty! And since you’re so keen on details, YOU FUCKING TRIED TO KILL ME IN THE ROOM OF REQUIREMENT!
‘Are you CRAZY?!’ Potter’s scream was like an axe to the head. ‘You want me to bring you DRUGS?!’
- Ron, please, can you hear me out? I’m not asking you to be my friend, I understand your position. – That was a blatant lie. - I just have one tiny thing to ask of you. And I suppose you might be ok with it given how you’re feeling…
- We’ll get to that. – Draco realized he was too harsh, so he tried to soften his tone. It wasn’t easy for him to not be so icy in bed with someone, he wasn’t used to it. – There will be plenty of time for it baby. For now, let me take care of you. Do you want that?
He might have been sitting there for minutes or hours or even days, he had no idea. He paid no attention to the outside world, all he focused on was Harry, and making sure he was still breathing. Once or twice a pair of hands tried to pluck him from the floor but he stiffened at the contact and they went away. Several times he felt someone pour something on the slice on his forearm, but he didn’t even register the pain. He thought he heard Weasley tell him ‘Malfoy, you can’t be here’, but he didn’t react – they didn’t know what he felt, none of them knew. So he just sat there, for however long it was, trying to silence that one, incessant voice in his head that stubbornly kept echoing ‘you lost him, he’s never coming back, you lost him
‘No! Not a chance! You’ll never force me to do this!’ Draco was flailing his arms comically, protesting. ‘That’s an asinine idea!’
‘So what, Potter? The old lady was a drug addict?’
- If I don’t, so what? What’s it to you?
Then, on August 29
‘What happened?’
‘I don’t know. I mean, I would want to, but what if it changes something?’
‘That much I hoped you would tell us, actually.’ Malfoy was clearly enjoying himself.
‘You look sweet, all domestic like that…’ Harry said smiling.
Draco spent the next three weeks in Mina’s apartment. He tried desperately to find any sort of work, but it quickly became clear that he had no skills that would be useful in any Muggle job and those rare openings for physical labour seemed to instantly be filled by people much more suited for this type of work than he was. He suspected it was rather obvious that if the employers were to choose between a thin, rather androgynous 19 year old and a muscular ex-fisherman type, they would choose the latter. And so, Draco was quickly becoming desperate. He was now even thinner than when he came to London, having lived off of nothing but a loaf of Henry’s bread a day, since he was still too proud to let Mina feed him. One Friday afternoon he made up his mind and hesitantly knocked on Mina’s bedroom door.
‘Me? Please, don’t be ridiculous. And what can be worse anyway?’ Potter snorted.
- Wow… I never knew he was that protective. I mean I know he’s loyal and he’ll do anything if he cares for you, but that? I never suspected he had it in him. But, if he was so into this Ravenclaw, how come nothing came of it? Draco was with this older guy in our 6
- I did. – Harry sighed in resignation – I still don’t think it was the best idea though, Professor.
‘You’re still not convincing me. You might have been forced to do it.’
year at Hogwarts. He never wanted to be a Death Eater, he never wanted to do what he had been ordered to do then, he never wanted there to be a war. He just wanted things to be as they used to be before Voldemort came back – he wanted his peaceful, rich and respected life back. He desperately wanted to be back to being someone, without actually having to serve the Dark Lord and choose sides. Life was much easier when there were no sides to choose and he could bask in the glory of being a Malfoy in safety. But that was long gone – the war happened, “his” (although he never thought he really belonged there) side lost, Potter was once again a hero, and all it meant that now was that not only did he have to face all the people who despised what was currently covered by his sleeve, but he also that lost those who embraced him because of it. The fact that, as far as he knew, the only Slytherins that returned were Parkinson, Nott and Zabini, didn’t exactly bode well for him either.
‘You could properly dry yourself before coming out, you know? I’m going to snap my neck on that water you’re leaving all over the place.’ It was weak at best, but it was all he got for now. His brain was severely lacking blood supply at this point it seemed like, because all of it was rapidly rushing south.
They kissed again, slow and deliberate this time, like they were completely in sync, like they’ve been doing this for years and knew exactly what to do. Draco thought vaguely that he was tasting cherries on Harry’s tongue.
- I don’t know, I’ll have to figure something out. I don’t know anybody here, so last night I just slept on a park bench.
- You mean don’t tell anyone else you want Malfoy to give you orders? Are you already ashamed of yourself? I’ll see what I can do. I haven’t decided yet.
- Alone? Fine by me! At least I won’t have a delusional deviant as a friend! Go ahead, leave and get your new boyfriend to cut you up to get you off or something! See if I care!
‘You’re a
- I’ve got a house in London, I inherited it from Sirius.
- Take that back, Potter! – out of the corner of his eye Harry saw Nott standing up from the couch nearby and reach for his wand – Leave the guy alone or I swear to Merlin…
‘Draco, please. I’ve known you for eighteen years, I think I can safely judge who was the one to propose.’ She looked at her son clearly amused. ‘Anyway, that’s fantastic! We need to celebrate! It just so happens I might have some elf wine stashed in the cellar and there might or might be a roast beef that is nearly ready! Harry, dear, I trust you like roast?’
Harry was hurting, both physically and mentally. What happened in the shower could’ve easily been considered completely Draco’s fault, but Harry felt like he was equally to blame for it as his boyfriend was. He should’ve told Draco to slow down, that they were going too fast for him. At this point, he wasn’t even sure if he initiated moving past blowjobs because he really wanted it for himself, or because that was what he thought Draco wanted. Harry shook his head. He was torn between completely blaming himself for the whole situation, like he deceived his boyfriend to gain something (although he really didn’t know what) and being afraid of him after what happened. It didn’t help that his brain decided (completely on its own accord) to replay Nott’s words from the Great Hall. “I’m just not into as heavy stuff as Draco is… I’m just not into as heavy stuff as Draco is… I’m just not into as heavy stuff as Draco is…” – If that was what their first time together has led to, Merlin knows what Nott really meant by “heavy stuff”. Was Draco lying when he said he wasn’t a violent person? And if he was telling the truth and he wouldn’t consciously want to hurt anybody (somehow Harry managed to push the other option out of his mind, for now) was this a testament to the possibility that he had problems controlling himself? It was one thing to deal with his outbursts when they were caused by anger, like they were with Ron and Dean, but it was completely different when it was with Harry, whom Draco was supposed to love and take care of. And exactly how far would that aggression go? Harry registered bitterly that it was obvious that Draco wasn’t above killing someone when blinding fury overtook him, what he did to Dean proved that, but what if lust had the same effect? He was too afraid to think about it. God, how he wished he had someone to talk this over with! But he was alone in this – he knew the Slytherins weren’t the ones to go to with this sort of dilemma and for now he didn’t really want to confront Draco, not before he made up his mind at least on what it was he was feeling exactly. He desperately needed Hermione now – he knew she would be the only one that could help him and that he could trust her completely. But now, even she wasn’t speaking to him.
‘Because you’re idiots. And besides, from what I gathered, you didn’t exactly have a plan in place. ‘Find them and destroy them’ is not a plan, Potter. No, this is different, they clearly know who they are going to target and they are knocking them off one by one…’
- Oh, no, no, no! – Draco wasn’t even sure how he knew what the man meant, but he did – That’s not what I was talking about! I was thinking maybe I help you unload your cart or something.
Draco hovered over Harry and forced Slughorn’s antidote down his throat. It took a couple of seconds for Potter (and just like that, Draco slipped back to his old, guarded self, simply because someone else was in the room) to start coughing and wheezing.
For the next two weeks Harry spent time exclusively with Draco and his Slytherin friends. The Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs avoided the group like a plague (the first time they backed out the common room when they saw Harry, Pansy, Baise, Theo and Draco sitting by the fire, Harry had a sudden flashback to the 2
‘I don’t know, haven’t checked yet.’ He glanced at the Muggle alarm clock on the nightstand. ‘6:30. What time are we supposed to be in the office anyway?’
- Mate, falling for this git is not simple in itself… It’s the most bloody fucked-up thing you could tell me. And now you’re telling me it’s even more complicated than that?!
‘Oh, yes, of course! Harry, I’m assuming you’re going through with the Auror thing, right? Ron’s applying too! Hermione’s thinking about some sort of ministry position, although if you ask me, I don’t see her behind a desk. What about you, Draco?’
“Oh, God…” – that was all he could manage. Harry seemed to understand, because he laid down beside Draco and smiled, drawing circles on his chest with the tips of his fingers. They stayed like this for a while, just looking at each other. There was no need for words, they understood each other completely, like their whole lives were just a build-up that always had to lead to this moment in time, so when Harry turned around, Draco knew what it meant, and somehow all the fear and hesitation was gone.
‘No. And that was two questions in a row. Why did you attack him in the courtroom like that?’
‘Oh, there’s no need for that. Please, just call me Narcissa.’
‘Male? I didn’t know that.’
suggestion, but so far there’s nothing. And how exactly did you arrive at the conclusion that Shacklebolt’s asinine idea was because of my hunch? He could’ve just as easily sent him off to Azkaban.’
- No, it’s ok. I would’ve assumed the same if I was in your place. – That was a lie, but Draco decided to pretend to not be offended. He was quickly learning that without the kindness of strangers he wasn’t going to survive. – It’s just that I, uh, came to London last night and I had no money and nowhere to go and Henry here was gracious enough to help.
‘Intuition and bluff. I had an idea that something was off all the way back during the trial. Yaxley and Rowle would never spill this much on their own. But I didn’t know for sure so I lied to get Weasley to admit it.’
‘Ron will have to deal with it. If he can’t get it through to his head that he was wrong, he is just being an idiot. And frankly, regardless of the fact that he was wrong, I have absolutely zero interest in his input on the situation.’ Harry looked determined.
- Pansy, it’s not his fault. – Through Pansy’s screaming nobody heard Draco and Nott come into the room. Harry saw instantly how much of a bad state Draco was in. Both his face and eyes were red, like he had been crying for quite some time now, and he was even skinnier than usual, his sweatpants nearly falling off of him. The skin on his chest acquired a grey tinge and his stomach looked like he hasn’t eaten for days. – I was the one to break it off.
So he spent practically the whole summer isolated, slumped over in Sirius’s old bedroom, reliving memories of war. He barely slept, and whatever sleep he did manage to get was almost always interrupted by nightmares. By the end of the summer he was so used to them that they just drained him instead of provoking a panic attack.
- Please… - By now, Harry was reduced to incoherent moans and that was the most verbal response he could manage. All he could think of was the sensation of his boyfriend’s fist moving along his swollen cock. He felt he was a minute away from exploding.
- No, Ron, there’s no need. I’ll just go back to ignoring him. That has worked for now, it’ll work again.
exactly did I say it, Mr. Weasley? I merely said you found the room in his childhood home, this doesn’t automatically implicate Mr. Malfoy.’ He looked at Draco and Harry’s eyes followed his gaze. Draco looked horrified.
- Did you want me to? – Harry didn’t know what to make of it. Neville didn’t show any hostility towards them so far, but Harry wasn’t sure what went on behind the closed doors of his and Ron’s room. – Well, for now we’ll have to work together, but if you’re uncomfortable I’ll work with someone else next time.
‘It’s ok, really. I didn’t know there was any other option back then, so it didn’t bother me.’ Harry smiled. ‘And besides, most kids in the Muggle world have some chores to do around the house, it’s just I had to do most of them.’
‘Oh, those. Took them long enough, I almost forgot about it. Do they always take this long to do simple paperwork?’
‘Micro-what?’ Draco was clearly confused.
– out as evidence, although we don’t know if they knew that you were a Death Eater or if it was just a coincidence.’
- I have no idea what it means baby, but I like the sound of it. – Draco chuckled.
‘What is it sir?’ Harry looked up at the Minister.
‘What’s going on?’ He panted.
- Oh, come on, Harry. – Harry was surprised that Pansy addressed him by his first name. – We’re just joking. You’ll need to get used to that anyway, so why not start now? Come on, we’re heading to breakfast and then to the library since the first period is free. Come with us. – All three of them extended their arms welcomingly, so Harry followed them, feeling slightly better about their attitude towards him.
‘Well, I’m screwed…’ Draco was almost crying.
- What? What’s wrong? – Harry didn’t know what Draco was talking about.
‘Microwave. It’s a machine that heats up food. Sort of like an oven, but not as big. You put the food inside, set the time and it comes out warm. Well, mostly at least. Muggles have whole dinners you can put in there. You buy a tray that has for instance some meat, potatoes and peas, you heat it up in the microwave and you’ve got yourself a dinner. Most of the time it doesn’t taste very good, but if you don’t have time, it’s alright.’
‘And way under-desired for anything else…’ Draco said glumly. He knew Harry would take it as a reference to his Dark Mark, although in all honesty that was not all he meant.
- I don’t know what you’re talking about. Please, just stop this. – Draco was trying to shield his mind from Potter just like Bellatrix used to teach him to in his previous life, but it was too late. It felt like his head was being split in half and all of a sudden all the memories from Hogwarts started flowing right before his eyes.
- What’s going on? You look like you’ve seen a dementor…
- Yeah, we do. And last time you brought up this conversation I ended up not eating lunch if you recall. – Ron was appalled at the memory.
- Now, don’t panic. There’s nothing between me and Theo. We were just drunk one night and it sort of happened and trust me, we both regret it. We couldn’t look at each other for weeks. And besides, that was almost two years ago. Anyway, you said you were worried about something else?
- Feels good.
‘Not now. I’ll explain later.’ Harry shivered, but reached into the drawer and pulled out a thin, silver knife. With a shudder, he realized that there was dried-up blood on the blade.
‘Yes. Completely. I lied when I said I wasn’t into you.’ Harry smiled.
- But… But what would people say? You helping Malfoy? That won’t look good, you know it!
Once he threw himself onto Potter’s bed, he felt like he was in another world. However much Draco hated him, he had to admit the git knew how to choose a mattress. He stretched himself along the bed and drifted away almost instantly, faintly noticing being surrounded by warmth and a hint of a masculine scent that smelled like a weird but pleasant combination of sandalwood, pine and freshly cut grass.
- Oh, that. That was intense, even by Draco’s standards… - all three of them nodded.
- Oh yes. Forgive me, I’m still pretty new here and I haven’t yet seen a man so handsome. – Distracting the clients with compliments usually worked, so that was Draco’s best bet. He was frantically scrambling for some plan of action, since it quickly became apparent that facing one of the most prominent figures of his long-gone, past life, meant he couldn’t fall back on his usual disassociation between himself and Yasmine. No, he was Draco Malfoy tonight, and Draco Malfoy was a woman.
- MY room. The fact that you’re there is just very poor judgement on McGonagall’s part. You should’ve never been allowed back after all you did, after all you and your cohorts caused. You should be in Azkaban and we both know it! – that last part came out way louder than Harry intended it to.
‘Why?’ Draco started to get scared himself – what if Harry didn’t want Weasley to know what they did the night before? What if he regretted it? ‘You don’t want him to know what we are? Or is it because of what I used to do?’
It was no use thinking about it, Harry decided – he made his peace with the fact that whatever he felt for the other man would go unfulfilled for the rest of his life, and tonight shouldn’t change anything. But it stung, like an iron bar in his lungs, to know that Draco didn’t even consider this. Because surely, if he felt even an ounce of what was inside of Harry, he wouldn’t just take up and leave like that, not just because Ron saw them. If he was ashamed of what he had done that meant that there was nothing besides Firewhisky and poor judgement that motivated him.
With their education basically behind them, Draco turned his attention to the question of his future with Harry. He knew he couldn’t see them split again after they’ve left Hogwarts, but he was well aware that life outside the castle walls was going to be much different – somehow, while they were still in school, the word of and ex-Death Eater and The Boy Who Lived being an item didn’t get out, but Draco knew it was only a matter of time before it spread like wildfire as soon as they stepped foot off the grounds. And what was worse, his own parents didn’t know anything yet. Draco wasn’t particularly concerned with his father finding out – after all, he was in Azkaban for life, so how much could he possibly do about it? But his mother was exonerated and living in the Malfoy Manor, very much still a part of the wizarding community, albeit shunned to its outskirts. Draco knew he had to tell her before she would find out from some other source. One evening he sat down and wrote a lengthy letter detailing almost everything (he left out the part about their first night together and the subsequent fiasco with Theodore, she didn’t need to know about it, and him and Harry didn’t even consider this a part of their relationship history by now), asking Narcissa to try and understand that for the first time in his life he was truly happy and telling her that whatever her decision in the matter of supporting her son through this was going to be, he was set on keeping the relationship going. To his surprise, Narcissa wrote back almost immediately, her letter addressed to both Harry and Draco in fact, telling them how happy she was and inviting them to stay in the Manor as long as they wanted to while they figured out where they were going to go on.
- If someone told me I’ll be saying this even a year ago, I’d laugh… - Ron looked up from his porridge. – But I completely agree with Pansy on this one. You two are worse than my parents!
- Mate, I’m sorry, but you’re kidding yourself right now. I can see now you’re too far gone to reason with. – Dean stood up to leave and Harry knew this meant he lost all the support he might have had in his Gryffindor friends. He just hoped that Hermione would be an exception to that.
- You lied for me? – Draco caught himself producing tears.
‘Yeah, but it says I need two. As amazing as you are, you’re just one person. And who do I go to for the other one? Nott? Pansy? Don’t make me laugh…’
‘Why? You said you had nothing to do with this. Did you lie to me?’
The next evening Harry was still shaken by Skeeter’s writing – he couldn’t believe anyone would stoop that low and suggest that he not only had any ties to the Black family, but also that something happened during the war and as a result he was now afraid to show his face to the community. He thought his mood couldn’t get any worse, but upon seeing Ron’s expression when he stepped out of the fireplace, he quickly changed his mind.
‘And yet when he made you stay home longer, you did nothing! AND you requested a leave instead of working from home!’
- Oh, you’re too kind baby. – Harry stepped into the room, closing the door behind him and wrapped his hands around Draco’s waist. – You’re the most beautiful thing I’ve seen in a while, you know? If you’re as mesmerizing later on as you’re now, I might have just found myself my new favourite company around here…
- You need one potion for that, not half the bloody Apothecary!
‘Where are you going to go?’ Harry asked.
‘But why would he want to work anyway?’ Ron was still not convinced. ‘They’re
- Worse than you think.
‘Somewhere around electricity stores, honestly…’
‘And it didn’t seem suspicious to you that he would be interested in the case after some time?’
- Hm?
‘What force? Draco, you need to tell me everything, the healers still don’t understand what’s wrong with your arm, nobody has any idea how to fix this – they just managed to patch you up enough so you wouldn’t bleed to death…’ She looked worried. Did it mean she was worried about him or was there something else?
- Why? You were adored. – It was time for Draco to finally corroborate his own instinct.
‘Don’t flatter yourself, I’m not into you. I needed drugs and that’s it.’
- Well, on you, certainly. You taste incredible, Draco.
‘Because I needed a drink. Why do you care anyway?’
‘Don’t you dare use this…’ Harry was trying with all his might to not scream at him right now.
Harry stood up, ignoring Malfoy’s violent protests at the notion of being sent to Azkaban, and sent his Patronus to the Minister for Magic, requesting an immediate meeting. All three men spend the next 30 minutes in complete silence, until a knock on the door signified Minister’s arrival. Harry opened the door and led Kingsley inside. As he settled into Harry’s chair, Ron relayed the whole story of how Draco Malfoy ended up in the middle of London after a year of being presumed to be dead. When he finished, Shacklebolt stared at all three of them in silence for a while, lost in thought.
‘Granger…?’ His voice was almost a whisper. He was afraid to even ask this question, but he needed to know. ‘What’s going to happen to Harry when I get convicted?’
? He looked like he was about to blow the whole courtroom up!’ Draco was laughing, for the first time since this whole thing started.
- No, it’s nothing, I was just thinking. – He sat on the bed. – Well, no. I was kind of panicking honestly.
Narcissa was already at the entrance, door open, looking outside for them. As soon as she saw the two figures approaching, she ran towards them hugging them and practically dragging them inside.
- …But?
- You… more… inside… - it was almost indistinguishable between moans. Draco slipped his tongue inside, hardening rapidly. He knew that if they went on like that, with Harry begging him for more, he wouldn’t be able to control himself. He tried to shake it off, but the lust and greed was building in him too fast. Draco just hoped Harry would finish before he reached the point when he couldn’t stop himself.
He should’ve known this time would be different, though, because this time it wasn’t just his imagination he had to go off of. The second the picture of Potter’s (round, decadent,
Harry gave in. There was no use trying to fight his memories, they’d end up surfacing anyway.
…’ He winced. Somehow, he thought he saw, for a brief second, a tinge of pain in Draco’s eyes ‘and if we fuck anything up or something isn’t up to standard, we’ll both be fired. But hey, we’ll be fine, we can do this! And the best part? Weasley’s working with Longbottom now, Chief thought we needed to be separated, so we’re flying solo.’
‘But Minister…’ Neville looked almost as terrified as Draco ‘if we don’t even know if he’s involved, how can we let him on the case?’
By the end of the evening, it seemed like Draco was accepted into the Weasley clan completely. They left the Burrow well fed, with a box of Molly’s cookies and an invitation for tea for Narcissa, Draco clutching not one, but two character reference letters (Arthur insisted that since everyone knew of their relationship by now, it would look better if he was to write one along with Hermione).
‘But how much more? I have no idea how to convert this into a workable thing at this point…’
‘Fuck, it stings! Can’t you just use Dittany like a normal Wizard?’
‘Now you’ve gone too far.’ For some reason Draco felt like he had to cool down Harry’s enthusiasm just a little. He grew to like working with him and he didn’t want the case to get blown because Potter was a hot head. ‘You can’t just arrest them for use of magic in front of a Muggle, you’ll have to wait until they actually make a move to approach their victim. If you arrest them too soon, there would be no way to establish a strong enough connection for a conviction. It’s an issue of evidence – you may know you’re right, but you need to think of how this is going to look in front of the Wizengamont. Honestly, you really need someone with at least a little bit of procedural knowledge in that office of yours…’
‘What my father wants, most of all, is to get out of Azkaban and go back to his old life. And if I tell him I want it too, he’ll believe me, because, to him, no life would be better than what we had. So I need to convince him that there is a chance his conviction might be overturned – to do that, I need to have something that would cause the Wizengamot to throw out the evidence against him. The only thing that could potentially do that is if you used Veritaserum on Rowle and Yaxley, since they ratted out everything my father ever did wrong.’
- Like that, baby?
‘Engi-what? That sounds made up…’
‘I can’t tell you. Just trust me on this, I know what I’m doing.’ Draco breathed again – so Potter wasn’t going to sell him out. Somewhere in the back of his brain there was a voice reminding him it was the
? Like a person in your house that cleans? So, like a human house elf?’
Draco instinctively reached to Harry and pulled him in. They ended up lying there, at the foot of Harry’s bed, with Harry’s face buried in the crook of Draco’s neck, their chests pressed together, legs entangled, Harry tightly wrapped in Draco’s arms.
seriously. So seriously in fact, that Hermione, of all people, had to remind him on occasion that there is, in fact, life outside of work. ‘Malfoy!’
Diagon Alley looked like a Muggle photograph. People stopped dead in their tracks, in complete silence, looking at the three figures that just arrived. It was obvious nobody was expecting The Chosen One to show up with two of the most famous ex-Death Eaters. Narcissa stood rooted to the spot, while Draco made a move that seemed like he wanted to turn around and run from the place. Harry raised his head high and wrapped his arm around Draco.
The tarte miraculously turned out pretty decent, despite Draco’s reservations about it, so the three of them spent the rest of the day stuffing their faces with it and cleaning up the mess the boys made (not without some difficulty on their part – Draco managed to send the dishes through the window instead of into the sink and Harry somehow transfigured the rag, that was supposed to wipe the table, into a rather exquisite-looking tablecloth). Harry gave the Malfoys a brief lecture on cell phones (and for the first time Draco appeared to be impressed by Muggle inventions: ‘So it’s like when you use the Floo network to talk to people, but you can use it anywhere you like? That actually sounds useful!’) and washing machines (those, in turn, didn’t impress Narcissa much, since for some reason she was afraid her robes would just end up being sucked into the water pipe and lost forever).
- You would do that? – Draco’s eyes filled with tears. – You would really let my mum live in your house?
‘And how do you know about that stash?’
‘Nothing, I’m just angry.’ Draco shrugged and sat on the couch.
‘That’s not your concern. I feel fine. Now, please, leave me alone.’
‘So you’re a monk all of a sudden?’ Ron looked surprised.
‘What happened? Is Harry ok?’ He tried to sit up, but the nurse stopped him.
‘You’re telling me I slept next to Voldemort’s possessions for years? What’s inside? And how do you open it?’ He was raising his voice.
. Although you were close with that one.’ Harry supressed a laugh. ‘As I said, they sell all different kinds of things that run on electricity that Muggles use. Like microwaves or vacuum cleaners. A vacuum cleaner is a machine that sucks dirt from your floors. It’s like sweeping, but instead of moving the dirt into one place, gathering it up on something and throwing it out, the dirt gets sucked into the inside of the vacuum by air pressure.’
They all looked like they saw things they never wanted to see – Shacklebolt’s expression seemed determined and intimidating, Ron had pure horror painted on his face, and Neville looked absolutely terrified. Draco was still wrapped in Harry’s arms, crying quietly. They all stood there, in silence, waiting for one another to break it, but nobody seemed to have found the right words. Finally, it was Draco who spoke.
‘I don’t know yet. Seeing as we’re both up anyway, we might just as well talk.’ Potter seemed unfazed.
‘From the moment you’ve been made a Death Eater until the end of the war – for now.’ Draco calmed down slightly and reached for his wand. ‘I’m sorry, Mr. Malfoy, but the proper procedure is for someone else to extract the memories. It can more painful than usually, depending on the person that performs the spell, and I’m sorry for that, but we cannot risk any tampering with evidence. Mr. Potter, would you be willing to do it?’
Harry was twirling Draco’s wand, that Ron brought back, between his fingers. The hawthorn still felt good in his hand, still somehow felt like it belonged to him more than it did to Draco, maybe because he never actually won it back, Harry has just given it back to him after the war was over. But then again, it didn’t entirely make sense – he has disarmed dozens of wizards, both at school and during his career, and yet none of the other wands connected to him that way. There was never this feeling of warmth spreading through his fingers, up to his arm, when he was holding any other wand – he didn’t even have to cast any spells to know this was not the same. He never understood why, even though it jumped at him before, but Draco’s want felt almost like his own holly phoenix one – actually closer to it than the Elder Wand did for that brief moment he was using it. But the Elder Wand was different, he told himself, it was one of a kind so maybe the connection just didn’t work the same way as it did with normal ones. He never thought much about it, he was perfectly happy with his own wand, but now that Ron has retrieved Draco’s and brought it back, per Kingsley’s instruction, it struck Harry as odd.
- A sub. That’s short for “submissive”.
- …but I don’t think it’s that. It kinda feels like I felt about Ginny back in the day. On some level at least.
"Hey, it's okay if you don't want to talk about it.  You don't have to tell me anything that would probably make you uncomfortable, ”Harry said when he realized it was something Draco didn't want to talk about.  And if it was in his power to avoid giving him a hard time he would " You know, I'm very nervous about the selection.  Mom and Dad said they didn't care where it was, they only cared if it made me happy;  although I know my dad expects him to stay in Gryffindor and Mom knows that he is more likely to stay in Slytherin or Ravenclaw.
Her mother noticed the slight sobs that she let out and the humidity that grew in her chest;  she then she hugged him so tightly that she felt she could stay like this forever.  Narcissa only gave a shaky smile to the people who saved them.
-A history of magic, Bathilda Bagshot.
"What brings you here?" Regulus questioned as he motioned them past.
Students can also bring an owl, cat, rat, toad, or reptile.  (The entry of any animal older than xx that is not domesticated is prohibited, unless it is a relative or, failing that, it cannot be left, if that is the case, send a letter to the director who will notify his boss)
-The Miranda Goshawk statutory book of spells.
"Dragon Do you remember that your father and I had a surprise for you?  " Asked his mother while Draco nodded. "Dobby!"  " She called and in a plop she was in front of them.
"I'm telling you James, this is very strange" he let out a low cry.
When Lily saw that there was no trace of the Malfoys left, she with a slightly angry face she headed to the living room.  Her where she could see a little boy sitting on the couch.
-1 telescope
Reaching for the wand she had between the folds of her dress, she stumbled and fell crashing down with Draco shaking in fear.  She desperately prayed to all the entities she remembered that nothing would happen to them;  her mind was on it when she felt as if her soul was being sucked out;  that would probably be the end of her, she remembered that she and Lucius had a big surprise for Draco and she felt worse, she wished even if it was;  see for the last time the love of her life.  And with that thought she covered Draco with her body, if she couldn't save herself, at least Draco would be fine.
"I have a slightly distracted mother" he replied quickly before she spoke.
-...- The boy, hearing Draco's words, came out of his shock, smiled a little and waved his hands as a sign that nothing was wrong.
"I've come to talk about the other day, Regulus," she replied seriously.
-Study of magic, defense and its use, Tom Riddle.
Narcissa said nothing, she just watched the glint of longing and hope that rose in the gray eyes of her child.
Draco well ...
Draco leaned closer, raising his hand;  trying to reach them but quickly put it down.  Just appreciating the painting.
The impact hadn't been that strong, but he knocked the boy down in front of him.  She quickly helped him up, he was somewhat taller than him, red hair and covered with many freckles (it seemed a very pretty face to him) He seemed in shock and was more scared when she saw him do it.  Don't do anything to get up.  After the third attempt he managed to lift it.
So deep was she in his thoughts that he didn't realize that he had drifted away from his mother, until he collided with someone.
Draco was so focused on checking that his mother was safe and sound, that he didn't notice big emerald eyes staring at him curiously.
"If you'll excuse me, sir, Mrs. Potter, mother" she said trying not to fail her voice "I'll go out for a while to get some fresh air, if you don't mind?"  He knew in advance that his father would kill him if he did not behave as he should in front of older people.
And Draco when I look more at her thinks he is the most beautiful he has ever seen.
"Expecto patronum!"  She screamed and the stunned creatures fled the scene.  Quickly a man arrived, who leaned over to see the state of both.
"Narcissa, Draco run!"  Regulus screamed as he stepped in front of them.
Keep in mind every little detail of this, I really like to put meanings or important little clues into everything. I also like to make stories with a lot of descriptions and less dialogue.
"I'm very sure that I will stay in Slytherin, although it would not be bad to stay in Ravenclaw, right" he smiles as he says it and the other one, just like him, returns a smile.
Suddenly in front of him, a tangle of black hair, wild and untamed, was placed.  The way he moved, he would have a life of his own.
"Very good puppy, I've come to talk to the boring Reg, so I'll be right back." That said, he left, leaving Draco with the werewolf.  They both sat on the wide sofa and Draco offered him cookies with a smile on his face.
He was speechless.  Someone had interposed and saved them, she felt that her strength was leaving her so before she fell, only she could thank Lily and James Potter with all her heart.
They were in front of the gate of the Black mansion.  If they asked him if he wanted to be in that place, he would politely answer him to go to hell, although of course, he is not very worthy of a Malfoy insult.  But we go!  It's not that she didn't like visiting his uncle Regulus, she loves being with him;  but whenever he goes with his mother he must stay in the living room and talk to the portrait of his grandmother Walburga until he gets bored, while his uncle Regulus and his mother Narcissa talked about "adult things" (in his mother's words) which seemed to him  humiliating for Merlin!  if he is almost eleven years old and according to his uncle Sirius was a man.
The air was cold and gloomy.  She knew that she should report it immediately.
‘Why? You want me to treat you like I would one of my co-workers all of a sudden?’ Potter was sceptical.
- So… - Draco desperately hoped he was coming off as seductive. – What do you have in mind?
- And I have been up since 5 a.m. and yet, as Our Saviour so insightfully noticed, I’ve been there for 30 minutes. Which means, it would be enough to wake up at 7 a.m..
- Love, in all honesty, I think I went a little too much into the direction of me telling you what to do for now. Tell me what you want to do now. – Draco had to come up with something to mask what he really wanted. This night was about Harry getting used to the idea of them having sex, there was no need to force his fantasies on him just yet.
- I don’t know, honestly. – Harry looked down. – I’m not okay with what you two have done. You both told me I have nothing to worry about, and yet tonight proved otherwise. I can’t go on knowing that anytime we have a disagreement you may end up in his bed, you know? And not only that, but you might also return from said bed sliced in half! What is that thing on your back anyway?
‘There is no report, there was no trigger, I told you.’
‘You know, Draco, actually it sounds like a wonderful learning opportunity!’ Narcissa exclaimed excitedly.
‘Wow. That, I was not expecting…’ He tried to pull himself together. ‘But thank you, I’m flattered.’ Out of the corner of his eye, Draco saw Potter get up and leave the room.
- But you… - Harry looked down at Draco’s throbbing erection.
‘So what? I decided I’m going to stop fighting what happens. If he knows what I did in Muggle London, let it be.’
- Like in sex…?
‘I told you, Wesley, I know nothing about this.’ Malfoy was getting a little angry – to Harry it seemed like whatever he must have taken was slowly leaving his bloodstream.
‘We think we know what’s wrong with your arm.’ Hermione was visibly shaken. ‘There is a way to fix this, but it’s
Draco saddened. So Harry had no real feelings towards him. All the hope he felt a minute ago vanished. It must have reflected on his face, because Harry spoke again.
‘In the flesh.’ Malfoy grinned.
- No I didn’t! I can’t just pick and choose who I sleep with, you know! You think if I had any choice I would be here? I have nothing, I had to run away, I’m not qualified for any Muggle job, this is the only way for me to have a roof over my head! – Draco couldn’t help it. It was the first time he was able to tell another living soul what happened to him. The tears started flowing and he didn’t even make an effort to stop them. – Do you have any idea how it is to be… THIS?! I’ve fallen further than you can even imagine! I would rather be in fucking Azkaban right now!
‘Jesus, mom, let go!’ Draco was trying to escape his mother’s grip. ‘I’m not twelve!’
- WHAT?! – Draco was not sure if the sheer horror that swept over him was because of his privacy being violated or the idea that Potter was self-medicating based on a book he had no foundation to use safely.
They apparated outside Grimmauld Place a short while later, and climbed the stairs to the front door. Standing there, Harry grabbed Draco’s hand and raised his wand to lift the protective enchantments they’ve set in place.
Draco closed his eyes. He felt Harry’s trembling hands pull down his sweatpants and stroking his length hesitantly.
‘What happened? I heard screaming? Have you set something on fire?’
‘Yes, I do.’
feeling, and not what it looked like, it wasn’t like he didn’t respect Ron enough to talk to him, he was just guarding himself and trying to cope with all that happened ever since Malfoy presumably killed himself.
- I suppose it’s fair… But not here. I’d rather not everyone know what I did. – Draco hung his head. – Can we go into your room?
‘So why didn’t you stay there?’ Draco didn’t know who asked the question – his eyes were at Harry, who was looking like he was on the verge of tears.
Also, it's getting a little darker as we go along, so I think I'm just going to change the rating to Explicit at this point.
- Stay out of this. – Draco didn’t even look at Harry. – Listen to me, Weasel. If I were you, I’d think long and hard about saying anything else right now. You don’t want to cross me.
- Honestly, I don’t know. If I was talking to you and you acted like you’re acting right now, I’d believe you, but I can’t speak for other people.
- Muggle expression. They call pills and potions “drugs”.
‘I’m sure either of them would be happy to do it. They’re supportive of us, you know it. Ron has even converted Ginny to our side and believe me, that couldn’t have been easy.’
. And if I was you I would assume they saw the Dark Mark and used it – I wasn’t hiding it really anymore and if they’re as good as you say, they wouldn’t risk using someone random, there would be too much of a chance for fuckup. Besides, this was the only time they did that, right? So, if it was just a coincidence, this type of behaviour would pop up every time – why would they only do it once if they were just using a completely random person? They would do it every time if that was the case, there is a lot of unsuspecting Muggles out there they could use to strengthen their argument.’
‘I don’t know. I just felt like it’s not my place to go spilling your secrets. I saw your reaction to me seeing you then and I saw it a couple of days ago and it felt like it was more than enough that I knew…’
Ron knew he needed to talk to Harry as soon as possible and apologize for his behaviour – he looked up and opened his mouth to say all those things he just realized, but the door opened and Malfoy came back.
‘Oh, that’s such a cool job… Although I would’ve thought you’d be more of a law enforcement kind of person. Well, you never know, right?’ She flashed them a bright smile and pushed still sulking Dean out onto the street. ‘Write to me, guys, as soon as you get settled in London!’ She shouted before shutting the door.
‘As you wish, my love.’ Harry grinned. ‘I’m glad you found something in the Muggle world you enjoy. And they do sell this in bigger bottles.’
- It’s not that he was talking about… about that thing. It’s really not. I couldn’t care less if he was insulting me to my face about my past, I can handle that. It was the way he worded it, the way he directed it at Harry. – He looked at his boyfriend. – Harry, I’m sorry. I never meant for it to go that far, I just saw how he made you feel and I lost it. I can’t handle someone hurting you like that. I’m so sorry… I know you think I’m a monster right now, but I swear, that’s not me… - His eyes were starting to water, he couldn’t control the lump in his throat anymore. He knew what he did must mean loosing Harry and he couldn’t bear the thought of that.
‘I guess. I’ll have some first-year trainee look through the archives. But I’m keeping an eye on you both, I’m still not convinced you’re in your right mind.’ With that, Weasley stood up and left the apartment, without even looking at Draco. Potter sighed and rested his forehead on the counter.
- Mhm… - Harry murmured. He was lost in thought. – Honestly, I think that would sound like a protective bubble to be in.
‘And, Mr. Weasley, it is my understanding that you have not managed to present the Court with a conclusive proof of the suspect’s identity, in a form of a wand?’
‘Draco, you’re doing the dishes tonight!’ Harry joked when he opened the door. By the expression on his face, Draco didn’t find it amusing.
‘What gave you that idea? My letter to Potter?’ Malfoy raised his eyebrows. ‘I barely said I’m going, I never said anything about committing a suicide. So I went. Here. Which brings me back to my initial question: looking for someone?’
‘Exactly.’
- I tried everything I know, there must be something we haven’t used last year. Again, good enough for me, I have no desire to go back there.
I'm thinking of writing a oneshot set during their summer at Malfoy Manor - it would be way less dark than this one, kind of a general funny domestic fluff about how useless are both of them at household chores and how confused Malfoys are at things like cell phones and cabs :D Let me know it you'd be up for reading this one and what Muggle technology you think would be most confusing (in a funny way!) to wizards :D
Draco knew that there was a way out of this – he almost tried it once before, and he could just as well try now. But something was stopping him – something lurking on the outskirts of his memory, too far away to grasp it, but definitely there. He knew that he couldn’t reach for that razor again, that it would be a wrong thing to do. That somehow, for some unidentifiable reason, it was better to just ignore Potter completely and wait for this whole thing to pass.
‘Do you and Mr. Malfoy hate each other now? What’s the nature of your relationship?’
‘I can’t do this, Potter… I can’t. Just lock me up and don’t make me go there.’
‘Or just into twinks…’ Harry couldn’t manage a serious response right now.
He’s been locked in Weasley’s and Potter’s office with Granger for two hours now and he still couldn’t manage to say a single word to her. He knew he was going to Azkaban, nobody in their right mind would believe in his innocence after what happened. Not only did Harry lose his temper on Weasley at the end of his hearing (even though Draco hadn’t heard everything, the faint sound of
‘I know! You should’ve heard what he was muttering under his breath!’
‘I’m sorry… I know you don’t really want to be here, but you’re the only person that has a chance to help us if something goes wrong. We don’t know what’s in there.’
- I couldn’t go through it again. And this time it was even worse than then, because I was the one to hurt you, not some other arsehole. And it was physical, not verbal. So I started drinking again, just like then, to try and forget, I think. And it all led to the same pattern as before. And I ended up with Theo because I knew if there was someone who would be able to fuck me up like I wanted to, it was him. I’m sorry, Theo, I really am. I never should’ve even come to you, let alone do the rest… - He looked at his friend apologetically.
- Honestly, I figured as much myself. With all you’ve been forced to do, it seemed obvious that you hadn’t exactly had time to hook up with people.
- I don’t know! You think it’s easy for me?! At least you didn’t know who I am! I had to lay here knowing who you are! Fuck, I all but bleached myself after last time!
- Well, there is not much I can change about how I look – especially since I can’t just cast a glamour sitting here with you, Draco thought - so I suppose I’m going to have to work with what I’ve got.
‘So now you have a daddy kink? This is getting interesting…’ Harry smirked and took a swig straight from the bottle.
‘Fine. What do you have so far?’
- Have you tried lifting the charms?
‘Where to now?’ Ron asked. ‘Your father said the secret storage was next to your bedroom, right?’
‘Can you please explain this using something I’ll understand?’ Draco was trying to mask fear with impatience.
‘I assure you that you can. The groundwork can be done by one person and all the paperwork will not suffer if it’s being handled in the comforts of your own homes for a period of time.’ It was no changing Shacklebolt’s mind.
Draco Malfoy was walking along Grosvenor Place. It was nearly midnight and he had no idea where to go. It was barely 12 hours later he was a part of one of the most powerful magical families in Britain – now, he was an outcast. His parents have just been sentenced to life in Azkaban for their involvement in the war, leaving him with nothing. He chuckled bitterly. Their supposed friends were so certain they were all getting out of the whole ordeal scot-free that all their collective gold was spent on legal representation during the trial. Hell, his own parents were so sure they were going to be declared innocent that they took out a loan against Draco’s childhood home, thinking they were going to pay it back once they were cleared of all charges and back on their feet. Now it was all gone. By now, Narcissa and Lucius were probably sitting in their cells in Azkaban and Draco was lost in Muggle London having fled all the press that followed him ever since the moment he stepped foot outside the Ministry of Magic. He knew he couldn’t go back. He was a homeless son of convicted Death Eaters with no money and no friends – even if he was willing to ask for help, he was well aware that there was nobody that would be ready to spare him even a scrap of their floor. No, he needed to stay on the Muggle side of the country. But where to go? How on Earth was he going to survive? He knew nothing about earning Muggle money, he had no education that would be useful whatsoever and on top of that, his sheltered upbringing left him with no contacts here. He was so desperate to get away, he had no plan in place. He sighed. There was no use dwelling on that right now, he needed to find a place to sleep. He looked around. It didn’t seem like there was anything other than lying down on a park bench he could do right now. The thought terrified him, but it wasn’t like he had any other option. He conjured himself a pillow and a blanket and braced himself for what he thought was going to be the most degrading night in his life. Oh, how wrong he was…
