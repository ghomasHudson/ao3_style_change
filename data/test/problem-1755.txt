As soon as he was done, Harry gently pulled his arm out. A few muttered spells cleaned up the bed and the two of them as much as possible before he pulled Draco towards him and wrapped himself around him as tightly as he could manage. Another spell covered them with a blanket.
Harry waved off the boy before staring at the lodge once more. There seemed to be kids and parents all around sorting things out and Harry couldn’t find it within himself to move much further.
Draco didn’t bother to stop his practise as he addressed them, though his grip on the barre tightened.
Harry stopped trying to direct his Grandma to the proper grave. If she realised that her daughter-in-laws headstone had been graffitied she would have just gotten upset.
Hermione shook her head and tried to compose herself. “Harry, I don’t like ballet, In fact I'm pretty sure I hate it. It’s useless and unhelpful and it kills my feet.”
“God no they all look fine. Don’t blame yourself anyway, blame Daniel. He was supposed to help me bring these to the room.”
There were a series of leaps before a couple twirls back with his arms structured high above his head. He kept his toes pointed for this part to transition into the structured step sequence. He ignored his Dad’s wide eyes as he frustratingly continued to show off what he’d learned. It wasn't elegant like it had been planned to be. Harry was exhausted and huffed with emotions but he knew either way the dance meant something.
It’s not painful. Pretty mild in comparison to boxing. But he thinks maybe this type of pain hurts the most. The Inside kind.
Penelope had been more of a teacher to him than Snape had over that past year. She knew him and how he danced maybe better than he himself did. And now his mentor, and best friend was panicking, and leaving him.
Going through some more editing. Didn't even realise my seventh chapter was still in the drafts. Rereading this makes me realise how fast paced the first two chapters are. I wont change this because I like the ballet school aspect of this story more and the relationship that developed later on but just beware. Go watch the movie (Billy Elliot) if you want a better telling of this aspect of the story. Thanks if you enjoy though!
Lilly Evans had married Amos Diggory nearly a year after Harry’s father had died. Harry was unlucky enough to inherit the last names of all of his parents. Having four names made him feel like a right priss. The Potter part didn't even feel like it fit. It was as foreign as the memories of his long dead father were.
Harry faintly remembered little conversation, he mainly remembered his worry and anger. “Is that the reason?”
Harry heard the telltale sign of a punch. He stayed still and watched Cedric check his nose for blood in shock before grunting and barging his way to the door.
. It was so overwhelmingly depressing when she was sick but now there's just nothing there anymore, all her stuffs been moved. Staying there is like staying in a house on
He doesn't cry. There's no tears when you can't move. No tears when there's no melody, no harmonic sounds to soothe your thundering bloodstream. There's no beat to calm his mind no drums or violins. It's just silence. Pure mind numbing silence that would cause shivers if he could manage a twitch.
None of the girls even glanced at him a second time when he came out after their warm ups. Mrs Weasley didn’t even smile at him. She just handed him the shoes and talked to the piano man about music.
She was intricate and graceful and easily switched from calm to panic as the melodies moved her limbs like puppet strings. She was supple and eerie. At first a flute flowed her posture and there was almost a scared innocence about her. That was until the music became louder and an orchestra of french horns and trombones bombarded his ears with powerful sounds, then she too became
Like most of the studio rooms this one was painted in white and gold when not surrounded by mirrors. Harry could see three other older students stretching at a barre but they paid him no mind. He turned from them and placed the boxes in a cabinet Penelope had gone over to before standing in silence.
Penelope was amazing where Daniel was enthralling, and his heart skipped a beat every time he saw them.
He assumed she was Parvati as she was the one with the fortune to see him in general classes. “When do classes start again?”
Harry backed up to look over his friend. For that moment he felt like he was seeing in third person. Seeing
Before Harry can even comprehend what she meant or rebuke any statement a wet towel had been thrown towards Ginny’s face with a splat.
Harry’s routine began to consist of such lessons. It seemed like how avoiding Malfoy was impossible, being near him was also such. Harry could count on no hands how many times practise
Sometimes Harry wished there was a way to listen to music and run at the same time, he thinks he’d run faster if he could. He probably did't really need it though. He had his own personal soundtrack.
Draco was mighty sure sneaking out would not be a good idea. The consequences of being caught was not a particular fate he felt the need to experience… even so.
“I’m sure you know Harry but at this school we have a strict no violence policy.” The Scottish lady explained.
Draco took the offence. “Th—That incident was a year and a half ago. My worries about Potter ended after our second meeting.”
A familiar song he’d never heard before played on an old record and echoed throughout the room peacefully. The afternoon seemed to absorb the sound and Harry felt for the first time in weeks, a prolonged sense of calmness that he didn’t want to leave.
Harry wonders if he could work in a joke shop, he likes jokes and maybe a fun filled life would be cool. He thinks about it long enough to find he hates the idea. The thought of dealing with business and customers and having his life revolve around juvenile jokes. He sighs. He's been thinking of other paths for his future and they all seem to repulse him.
Harry waited, he knew they came in around the end of the song. He almost blushed at the words of the song but didn’t. Instead he turned to Malfoy.
matter. Harry could tell by his movement. Draco moved strategically with practise and knew exactly what he was working towards. Harry remembered how he said that the girls practised all the elegant stuff, but Harry reckoned he’d never really seen anyone dance as elegantly as
He didn't think anyone deserved their fate. This fate. With the striking, the cancer, Harry not showing up to boxing. He was starting to think someone up
Still in third year... Still! got this chap out really fast so that's a win. Hope you enjoyed this chapter~
Draco's friends, that is true. The strings attaching the three boys together were completely conditional. They were
Harry loved dancing. That was clear to him. He loved the burn, the excitement that rose within him when he did it. His heart quickened at the sense of camaraderie he felt when him and his teacher danced in sync, like they could predict each other's movement and bounce off the others' actions.
She brings him back out to practise again. She isn’t less careful with her words. She’s straight forwards and watches him continue to fail. He doesn’t feel like failing. He hates the idea.
I re-read this chapter like four times to get it right and I think I finally got it the way I wanted. Anyway here is the start of this self indulgent AU with more Harry than ever (seeing as my last fic had Harry out of the game for like 90% of it)
Potter the stupidly enthralling boy, he’d brought in magazines and letters from a friend. All these things detailing the specific uses of cosmetic materials and tips he gladly shared amongst the class. Lipsticks and face paints where handed out a plenty when they were given a little freedom after their first few attempts and soon Draco watched as an entire class laughed as they applied glue to their eyebrows and drew humongous fake smiles atop their own.
He tapped his feet in annoyance at first. Then again out of spite. Then again to the rhythm he’d practised for nearly a year.
He took a moment to huff before speaking. “Your movements are very… what's the word? Classical. Half the dances and practises you know are specifically for female dancers. It’s less prideful and more…
Harry didn’t understand how Malfoy seemed to instantly act like he understood the dance moves. Apparently they were supposed to click continuously while doing some form of agonisingly slow moves. Harry pushed away his complaints as he tried to examine and follow Malfoy’s moves.
Editors note: Three in one day! Editing is way easier than writing that's for sure. I forgot how much I liked my head-canons and little flairs in this story. Toning down on the swearing a little bit even though Harry does it an eleven year old doesn't really think in swears. I was also trying to rush through the early ears back then to get to the romance but now I kind of which i'd sat in the younger years more. At least I didn't get too far.
They had been in a car. Harry hadn’t known how old he was at the time but thinking back he would guess around three or four. His Mother had been crying. Sobbing in the front seat. her crying had wavered frequently and her pale hands had covered her face. It was dark out. The world didn't exist outside the car. His Father had just died...he hadn’t known that either. In the end not remembering was probably for the best.
He had to go into a changing room and put on the same attire he’d seen the two boys wear. He kept his gaze firm as he untied his shoes. He could hear a boy chatting to someone next to him.
“Where are you going?” She appeared to be holding a football of some kind but he hadn't the time to spare another glance.
Harry wondered if one day he'd look upon Hermione with pride like that. He tried to imagine but for some reason he just couldn’t picture it. In fact Harry couldn't picture Hermione Dancing in the future at all. It was a blank option.
A lady pointed them up the stairs and he had to call for his dad, who was looking around at the architecture in awe.
. Harry who was was scrawny even for an eleven year old. Harry who possessed a flat eye catching scar that ran across his forehead like lighting, jagged and smooth, noticeable and definitely
Draco would continue to wonder what the other boy might have said days after, it would have been his last mundane thought before his life changed.
Potter was the child that made his blood boil the most. He looked so much like James. It made him sick to see. He was revolted in the fact that Harry wanted to be a dancer. Lilly never wanted to, so why was her son like this? Why was her son set on taking a passion his mother should have had?
There was a bonfire in those woods, had been before Draco and Potter had even arrived. The panic was slow to start, just the off smell of smoke had made him want to walk right back to the school alone and grumpy at his own hindrances.
Someone helps him scale the fence and in a quick few seconds he’s running towards where he knows the bus goes. The mines.
Miss was trying to push him, teach him more than he could possibly learn. She was starting to worry and it showed. The audition was coming up and she was
Harry was shocked for a moment. The boy hadn’t seemed to acknowledge their first meeting that entire day and had even denied it outright. A million questions flickered through his mind before speaking.
Harry growled "Stop acting like you know everything! Can’t we just practise it bit by bit? Or with music at least!”
a before. An image of an old house. A cat. A rose bush he's sure must have plucked his fingers once. There were was one year before two before three. But the before never happened. Not in any ways that mattered.
He stays silent and breathes heavily and looks down. She holds her hands in front of her mouth and steps forward. They don't look at each other.
He had to be seen by a doctor or physician or something before the audition. He didn't really listen. All he knew was that two men walked around him and measured his height and arm length.
He’s given up on the idea of an audition, he reckons helping girls who couldn't care less is the closest he’ll ever get to being a professional dancer, It’s a depressing thought for an eleven year old. Knowing the peak of his dream career is this. He can’t even think about it though without getting angry. His shoulders snap hastily with the music. Rose doesn't notice. Miss tries to console him, says he’s improved quite a lot. He’s hit a roadblock and they both know it. There isn’t much more she can teach and there's no more for him to learn here. But that doesn’t mean he’s good. It just means he can’t progress.
some introductions may be in order. As your headmaster Albus Dumbledore, I welcome all students new and old to another year at this fine school of ours.”
Ron snorts. “Only barley. Ginny disconnected the landline so you couldn’t call mum the day of your audition. She tried to stop you from going.”
Like he once had before, Harry began to form a routine. He and Dean, who had turned out to be his roommate for the next year, would wake at seven for breakfast with the other boys. Dean would be sure to make as much noise as possible before they walked out, banging every bed frame and side table before sunrise. Their small class was rooming down the hall from the other boys meaning they would have to walk behind the others and wait for the rest of their year until they all ended up in their general classes. Around midday they would be sent to their gendered practises before combining. The boy's day would end at around six before they were left with free time. Dean had told Harry there was a curfew but Harry had never seen a single teacher enforce anything like that and was pretty sure it was a myth.
He’s glad she’s strong. His hurtful words did nothing to dent her. His eyes are still red in the mirror. But he doesn’t stop.
The girl was maybe sixteen with straight blonde hair and rosy cheeks. She quickly overcame her surprise and produced a kind smile before bending down to grab her boxes. “Oh it’s alright, clumsy of me to walk around with these things in front of my face.”
Malfoy pointed over towards the door. Harry looked to find that Penny was in fact waving him over frantically. He nodded quickly before muttering a “see you.” and rushing over to her.
smaller classes but have no doubt! Your schooling shall not be affected in the slightest. So no fear young ones. For I have a feeling this year will be a great one.”
It looked like a caste, or a mansion. A ground that beckoned him to come forward. Harry could picture the queen walking out, or a group of dancers that actually did.. He’d known a school this would be but it still somewhat shocked him. It was one of those places that were so fancy it had a name.
“Fred Astaire was your Mams favourite. Oh how we’d tap and dance our feet along with him to the tune.”
to have been. He knows this as he knows most things he's never been told. A start contrast formed in imperfect reasoning. Before was a definite, secured in the steady stream of his life. Before did happen. Even if he couldn't remember it.
Draco remembers the threat he’d told the other boy a year ago. He knows they’d both tried their weakest to avoid the other. Draco
Cedric came back home that morning looking triumphant. Harry hadn't a clue what he had done and he didn't want to. Amos seethed in rage when he saw him. His brother only grunted and went to grab his signs. His nose was red and he looked like he had a black eye.
Cherry Bomb by John Mellencamp (This is such a vibe and it came out the year this chapter is set! I recommend!)
“I’ve seen you dial it like a hundred times over the past two years! It was pretty easy to remember.”
The boy’s nose was almost blue and his eyes were stained red with tears by the time the two brothers had found him, curled up beside a phone booth. Cedric hadn’t the time to berate the boy as he helped Harry usher him to the heat of the car.
He waited for Hermione to speak. To tell her friends about the evil things their teacher had said. He waited for her to complain about how she was being forced out.
The rest of break comfortably continues as feelings are unacknowledged but all the more felt. An oddly quiet and overwhelming bus ride and the start of a new year. What is in store for our group of puppy love kids this year?
He waited for a moment but the other boy didn’t reply, so instead he turned and kept his eyes on the roundabout. He sat glumly and started to sway slowly to a tune he couldn’t hear.
remember is when he finally awoke. When a switch flipped. When he truly came into existence and became
Harry found himself tapping his foot anxiously, the performance was to be in nearly an hour and he shivered in a quiet empty room.  The rest of his year had gone to greet the parents waiting outside and all that was left was him, a few girls and Malfoy.
Snape never failed to point out one flaw made from either boy and Draco could only remember one time he didn’t outright insult their capabilities.
Somehow Draco’s year seemed to be filled with events he had no part in. Potter pretended to avoid him and all Draco could do was hum and sway.
familiar really. He wasn't sure he could keep this place to himself. Harry had made sure to have a piece of paper with everyone's phone number and was hoping to find a private place to call, he even had Luna’s house phone though they'd never really gotten on that well.
The room was filled with the people Draco had come to expect to see. Granger and Seamus seemed to be talking animatedly at a desk while Lavender pestered Blaise about some form of hair product he was using.
None of the dancers in the photos had scars, they were all so very clean and smooth. They looked like the perfect humans, no dents or marks. No wrinkles or one limb out of place. Mrs Weasley had never said that his appearance would go against his chances but he never brought it up.
. The room was painted with old orange light which shone through the slow floating dust particles amongst the cold air. If any one else had seen them they might have yelled. Called them all sorts of names. Harry couldn't see the sight as anything less than it was. It was a warmth filled magnificence. The making of certain type of memory he knew would hold great nostalgia one day. Like when one first learns to ride a bike or feel the grass in spring. It was something that filled Harry with warmth and dread, knowing he may never feel like this again. Knowing he can never truly dance the way he craves.
Harry studied the maps of Roehampton and Richmond Park he’d been given thoroughly... or as best as he could force himself to stare at a page for so long. Never in his life had he travelled so far along and so alone. He'd come to find the bus didn’t go into the park and he’d have to walk quite a trek to get to White lodge so he tried to familiarise himself with the landscape.
Ron walked along the curb with his arms out. “Ginny told me your dad found out. Said he made a right scene in the middle of class.”
For a moment he thought the other boy looked intimidated, but in hindsight maybe he was just confused. His upturned lip and slight grimace reminded Harry of someone he hadn't met yet. No thought of his really mattered in the end as a shiny boxing glove met Harry's face in an uncomfortable
Harry missed the audition. What will become of his dream now. What is eleven year old to do when all the world seems to do is crumble.
Draco cleared his throat. “It’s our purpose as dancers. The girls work on pointe and we work on jumps. Our stronger bodies are built for those movements.”
He was horribly confused. It as like he was thrown into a pool not knowing how to swim. The girls twirled around with their arms above their heads. Every other second Harry was bumped into or bumped into someone else. He tried to follow but huffed in annoyance.
boy was the subject of his fascinations. He knew though. Draco knew from their first alteration that Harry was something he could care about. He knew this because Harry hurt.
Draco goes still inside his arms, and he says nothing for a long time. Then, “It would be easier if I had never been born.”
Dumbledore stands up and storms across the office, pointing a finger at Harry. “Darkness is only the absence of light, nothing more. The only power it has is the power we give to it. I would hope I’ve taught you better.”
Ron rolls his eyes. “Well, I know you have an idea what’s going on, but if you can’t tell me yet, that’s alright. Now, what’s in the memory and why is it important?”
“Do you want to taste me pet?” he asked conversationally, as if his lover wasn't lying on their kitchen floor, wracked with pain and a desperate desire to cum.
Draco whined a little in frustration but quickly put his hands behind his back as he lowered his mouth to tongue at the thick cock in front of him.
“It's ok love...all good. Let's get you nice and cleaned up for me hmm. You want to be clean for me right?”
Draco’s hole was visibly straining against the pressure in his intestines and Harry traced a single finger around the red slightly swollen rim. It was going to get so much worse before the day was through, he thought to himself.
Once again the sentence was left unfinished as Harry’s cock finally emptied itself into the depths of Draco’s ass with a vengeance.
Harry set a moderate pace for their little excursion, just enough for Draco to work at keeping up, making sure he felt every step.
Harry paused after the fourth, waiting to see if Draco could reach through the fog of pain and follow instructions. He started a five second countdown in his mind when Draco did nothing but pant into the bedsheets. He had reached 4 when Draco seemed to come back to himself and pumped once. His muffled sob was the only physical indication that the plug had expanded further inside his burning ass. Harry marvelled at the efficacy of ginger oil, its potency increasing every time Draco clenched his ass against the paddle. He could either try to protect himself from the pain of the blows or from the burning from the oil, not both. And increasingly it seemed, neither.
It was a gorgeous autumn afternoon and Harry breathed it in deep. The air was crisp with the perfect amount of chill.
Draco went rigid at the command, though Harry knew it would be a lot harder to stay that way once the cramps started. “Yes Harry.”
“No Harry” was all he said as he took a trembling step forward and nearly keened before he shoved his fist in his mouth to muffle it. Then another step, and another till he was next to Harry, reaching out to grab the hand he held out like it was the only life preserver for his sinking body.
Draco’s hole gave in with just about as much resistance as Draco himself, after spending all day being stretched.
Harry waited for Draco to process what he said, meanwhile conjuring some lube and rubbing it to coat his hand.
Draco knew what Harry was actually asking. And he knew one word from him and Harry would bundle him up and lavish him with all the love and care he could dream of and then some.
Harry finished securing Draco's right ankle to the rings he had built into their bed for this specific purpose and then stood back to admire the spread eagled form of his lover. Every cell in his body wanted nothing more than to be buried balls-deep into the scorching heat of Draco’s ass and ream him till he forgot his own name.
“Yes Harry. I'm so ready” Draco continued to whisper, as if afraid that a sudden noise would make Harry change his mind. As if anything changed Harry's mind once it was made up.
And that was how they waited till the bag emptied itself into Draco’s bowels, and then till the room was filled with an almost continuous keening wail from Draco as he drooled around Harry’s cock, his tears creating a wet patch on Harry's jeans and his own poor neglected cock creating its own wet patch on the sofa cushion.
“I was thinking, a cosy lunch at Angelo’s followed by a leisurely walk along the river. It is simply too perfect an evening to stay indoors. What say?”
“Crawl to me pet” Harry said when he finally managed to put away his jeans and the pump fell to swing freely between his knees, the sudden tug on the plug making Draco flinch.
“Either say your safeword and we stop or fuck yourself on that cock till you come once more.” Harry kept his voice as neutral as he could, not wanting to influence Draco’s decision too much.
Draco’s cock jumped in the tight confines of his jeans and he was suddenly afraid of cuming untouched just then.
“There you go pet. A hard cock to fill that ever needy slutty hole of yours. You can ride it and come as much as you want. I will sit here and watch you, so you better put on a good show.”
“There pet...all done...it’s over…” he murmured into Draco’s ear, rubbing his hand soothingly over his arm and side, cradling him in his arms. Draco’s hands clutched around the pump he had just finished working for the last time and Harry gently unwrapped his fingers from around it.
“Harry please...please...I need...please...” He wailed as Harry licked all around his belly button and the copious amounts of precome he has slathered all over there without once touching the poor boy’s cock. It was so flushed and hard Harry was sure he would come if he so much as breathed over it. But Draco knew better than to come without permission, so he did just that.
The walk to Angelo’s, usually a short five minute stroll, must have felt like a marathon to Draco in his current state, Harry wagered. And going from the cloudy look in his eyes and his miserable attempts at keeping up a conversation, Harry could also safely assume he wasn't entirely aware for most of it.
Harry smirked. It was all standard punishment fare so far. Draco was accustomed to this. Time for some more surprises.
No he didn't need a verbal confirmation, but he demanded it nonetheless. Even after all the extensive negotiations they had had over this scene in the month since Draco had asked Harry for it, Harry knew he would be pushing every limit Draco had today. Pushing it till they almost broke, a line that was going to be a challenge for both of them to tread. Because he wanted to hurt Draco like Draco wanted to be hurt, but when a masochist like Draco met a Sadist like Harry, it was oh so easy to forget the lines.
Draco’s back lifted off the bed, his hands pulling at the restraints so hard Harry knew he would be healing deep bruises by the time they finished.
He waited patiently as pale eyelids fluttered open followed by an undignified jaw breaking yawn ( it's not undignified Harry- nothing a Malfoy does is ever undignified )
More whimpers filled the otherwise silent kitchen as Draco greedily sucked Harry’s thumb into his warm mouth.
Holding his head still with his hands in his hair, Harry simply shoved his cock straight down Draco’s throat without giving him any warning. He had been too hard for too long for it to be any other way.
Draco’s expression was priceless. The desperation warring with the conflict. Between a rock and a hard place, as the muggle expression went.
“Safeword?” He asked as he walked over, carefully settling down his accessories so as to keep his pet unaware.
“I'm sorry harry ...please...it burns ..please ... I'm sorry ..” he ranted mindlessly, rocking his head from side to side.
Harry twisted and turned the nozzle for no reason other than to hear some more delicious noises fall from Draco’s lips before pulling it out completely.
Harry let him off without finishing that sentence for once, continuously rubbing circles on his stomach. He looked up just as the bag finished emptying its contents inside Draco.
Draco’s cock was drippipng precome once again and Harry knew he would probably give his soul right now for Harry to touch it.
When no answer came forth, Harry stopped moving the dildo and climbed up Draco’s body to grab his thrashing head by the chin and look into his eyes.
With his hands busy exposing his still slack hole to Harry, Draco’s entire weight was supported by his shoulders and neck, a position that rapidly got uncomfortable under the best of circumstances.
If Harry’s heart was threatening to beat right out of his chest, no one could tell from the way he gently pushed the hair away from Draco’s face as he slept peacefully in their bed. That stillness and calm was hard earned through years of trying to be what Draco needed- a rock in the lashing storm that was his mind, a place to call home, the man he turned to when he needed to submit, to hurt.
“I’m waiting for the count pet, don’t make me remind you again” he warned Draco when the scream was followed with nothing but harsh panting.
Harry pushed two fingers inside while Draco tried to muffle his gasp. Draco was on fire, the ginger oil coating his sensitive inner skin continuing its assault. “Does it still burn, pet?" He still wanted to hear it from Draco.
One look at Draco and Harry almost came in his own pants. Draco looked wrecked. His eyes had watered, just barely keeping the moisture from spilling over his flushed cheeks. His lips were pressed into an unforgiving tight line, working hard to keep away the other noises that were beating at them to get out and be heard. His hands were fisted into the tablecloth and Harry craved.
He slathered the dildo with the oil, making sure it got in every corner and over every bump. A quick glance at Draco told him what he expected. His pet seemed to be dozing with that still sleepy smile on his face. It would be fun to wipe that off, Harry thought gleefully as he took the dildo and, taking aim, shoved it into Draco in one hard thrust.
“Of course you don't want me to take it out. Little sluts like you always need to be filled till bursting. Always need something stuffing your dirty hole. Am I right Draco?”
The blows continued raining down unforgivingly on Draco’s battered ass and thighs. His sobs had turned into wails somewhere around the fourth pump and Harry had to bite his own lips raw to keep in the moans that threatened to burst from his throat
Harry leaned back in his seat, smiling goofily as if he hadn't just left Draco’s beating heart bared for the world’s viewing pleasure on the white tablecloth between them.
As Draco took position (still so bloody graceful) Harry reached out to the clear plastic bag that hung from the pole and the long tube that ended in a medium sized plug shaped nozzle.He made sure the nozzle was adequately lubed. Draco was allowed lube during their playtime but no prep. He knelt between Draco's obscenely spread legs and traced his hands over his quivering abs and the fluttering pulse at his neck. Without saying a word, he lined up the nozzle with his tight hole and pushed.
“Close your eyes, and turn over onto your back. Pull your knees to your chest and show me your dirty little hole.”
But then Draco’s cock leaked against his thigh when he bit down on the lip he had marked earlier and the moment was benched for later. Right now, he had a promise to fulfil.
“Perfect pet. So good for me.” Draco blushed and Harry couldn't help but laugh at the lovely reaction his praise elicited from Draco that his dick up his ass couldn't. So he kissed him again, quick and hard.
When Harry finally pushed his plate away with what sounded like a deafening screech in the silence of the kitchen, Draco almost jumped out of his chair. Harry loved the fact he could reduce Draco to such a state with just some well timed movements and a steady build up of anticipation. This was not the start of their game. It had already begun the moment Draco had opened his eyes this morning.
Draco was rocking his head from side to side and Harry wasn't sure he was even aware of it as he groaned “Y..yess Harry...want to be..cl…” he broke off as another wave of cramps hit him.
“That's a good pet.” He dropped down a few inches and gave Draco a slow and tender kiss, waiting till Draco was actively and enthusiastically participating before making a movement with his hand. A sudden groan from Draco told him the dildo was once again thrusting in and out of his poor abused hole. Another look and Harry confirmed one more thing. Draco’s cock was slowly filling up again. His masochistic pet always delivered.
Harry continued to fuck Draco with the dildo with steady hard thrusts and knew the oil was doing its job if Draco’s garbled cries and tears were any indication.
It took Draco a few minutes to return. He was moving slower than usual already, a little more deliberately as if tipsy. Harry kept his eyes on Draco’s face as he crawled back and knelt next to the chair he was waiting in. His tipped his face up with a finger under his chin and asked “color”
Harry saw the moment Draco understood because his pleas of “No Harry” were accompanied by Harry pulling the dildo out and ramming it back again.
Draco positioned the dildo at his loose entrance till it caught his rim, then he looked at Harry as ordered and slid down every painful inch. The nubs scraping at his already tenderized insides, his mouth open on a soundless scream. Once he had seated himself fully, he finally took a deep breath.
All in all it took Draco about 24 minutes to make Harry come, or more like Harry managed to delay his orgasm by 20 minutes because what Draco lost in terms of skill without the use of his hands and the constant burning and cramping in his guts, he more than made up for with sheer desperation and wantonness. By the time he made Harry erupt in a fashion that made him doubt his own claim of orgasming before breakfast, every inch of Draco's face was covered in sweat and tears and drool. And Merlin, he looked gorgeous in his sheer filthiness.
“It’s rude to fall asleep in the middle of sex pet. And without even saying thank you for the lovely orgasm I let you have.” Harry tsked.
When Harry leaned back, it was as if Draco had been given permission to feel everything again. A fresh litany of moans and whimpers erupted from him as he begged Harry, first with his eyes and then his words.
He took a minute to tuck himself back into his jeans, admiring Draco’s swollen red lips and spit soaked chin.
“There you go ...simply perfect.. You are doing so well Draco.” Harry showered Draco with praises as he manoeuvred his fist inside the hot slippery channel.
Harry looked over his shoulder to where Draco was standing at the bottom doorstep. Standing was a very generous term for what he was doing though. His left hand clutched the doorsill in a death like grip and Harry could see the tremors that wracked his body from where he was standing, barely keeping the shark-like grin from splitting his face.
“There love. It’s over now. You did brilliantly. You can sleep now.” he murmured, running his hands in broad strokes over Draco’s back.
And Harry could see the understanding dawn on Draco’s face as his eyes widened and his mouth fell open on a small groan.
“Very good, pet. You remembered your orders. But next time don’t make me wait so long or I will add 4 more strikes to your punishment. Am I clear?”
Draco practically threw his head from left to right to emphasise his point as he cried “no Harry...I will...not...”
Harry did not intend for these strikes to be particularly hard, but he did mean for them to have a big impact. Aligning the paddle with its target, he brought it down smack on top of the plug, jostling it and sending shockwaves through Draco's ass, into his stomach, up to his lungs and out of his mouth in a scream that was probably heard by their neighbors.
Despite what was coming, or maybe because of it, Draco smiled shyly at Harry. "I'm glad I can please you Harry."
“Now let’s walk around for a bit and enjoy this exceptionally good weather we are having.” Harry said as they got up from their table after leaving a generous tip. Draco had stumbled for a second, as if the change in position had suddenly brought every sensation rushing back. Harry slipped his hand around him in support, working his hand once again to the pump and squeezing it.
“Come back to me now pet…" he whispered, turning Draco’s head to drop kisses all over his face. His face was wet with tears, snot and sweat and Harry loved him more than ever before in that moment of breathtaking vulnerability.
Draco’s eyes opened sluggishly, his gaze unfocused. Harry could see the pain floating on its silvery surface.
He waited till Draco was breathing normally, whispering soothing nonsense all the while, making sure Draco felt safe and warm and loved. He thought Draco had finally fallen asleep when he heard a faint “Thank you Harry”
The rest of the meal went swimmingly, for Harry that is. They loved the home cooked feel of the food at Angelo’s and the anonymity it gave them both being a muggle establishment. While he was jittery at first, Draco seemed to have settled into his situation by the time the desserts rolled in. Harry let him enjoy his chocolatey goodness in peace. His pet had earned it by taking everything Harry had given him so far so well.
Draco’s breath was coming in sharp desperate pants and his eyes were so cloudy Harry had to wonder if he was hearing him at all.
“There’s my brave pet.” He murmured right in Draco’s ear, dropping a quick peck on his blushing cheek.
Draco struggled with that simple order. His eyes fluttering open slowly, as if the simple task was taking all his strength to accomplish. He turned eyes the color of thunderstorms at Harry and Harry couldn't help himself. He leaned over and captured his lips in a kiss that started out soothing but didn't stay that way. He pulled Draco’s lower lip into his mouth and bit till he heard Draco groan. Then he let go and leaned back to see the blood that had risen to the surface, just short of spilling over. He licked over it again.
“Give me one last orgasm pet. And then you can sleep till tomorrow.” He promised Draco, reaching between his legs to finally touch his cock for the first time in the entire day. It got the desired effect, reanimating Draco with a scream. Harry simultaneously started pistoning his fist in and out of Draco’s ass, nailing his prostate with every thrust .
Now Harry took his time exploring his lover’s body. Starting with his swollen red lips. Harry often thought Draco kissed like each one was his last. Living with a sociopathic murdering megalomaniac in his house for over a year and surviving a war had given both of them a healthy appreciation for all the good things in life. But Draco had perhaps taken the lesson more closely to heart.
“Come here pet” He said, watching with hungry eyes as Draco crawled over to him. "Drink” He held the glass up to Draco’s lips and he gratefully gulped the whole thing down in record time.
“Such an obedient little pet Draco. You took that so well. We are done with the enemas now. Your dirty hole is all clean for my cock. Do you want my cock now?”
The next four strikes were concentrated around Draco’s thighs. Harry watched colors erupt across Draco’s pale skin and felt his cock get harder with each new cry from his gorgeous lover.
Before Draco had a chance to fully grasp the instructions, Harry pumped once and simultaneously pushed Draco into his seat.
With one hand Harry pulled out a chair and directed Draco towards it. And just before he sat down Harry whispered “Remember to be quiet now pet.”
“Do you want to come, pet?” Harry asked, each word landing a puff of breath right at the purpling head of Draco’s cock.
He deflated the plug to about half its current size, before pulling it out with steady pressure. Draco wailed through the entire process.
Before turning the water on, he sat down on the couch and pulled Draco’s head on his lap. He gently pushed his matted hair back from his forehead and looked into his tormented eyes. They had lost their focus and Harry could see Draco was starting to drift off already. And while that was part of the endgame, it was too early to let Draco lose himself. And so with a flick of his wrist, the water once again flowed from the bag.
He frowned as he watched them dance. They were smooth and their eyes never left the other boys unless to turn, they worked together like a well oiled machine and they didn't even know it. Snape's not sure how it happened, He’d given them the hardest moves and somehow behind his back they’d formed an alliance, broken down each mistake they'd once made and eradicated them.
“You can forget about ballet. You can forget about boxing. I’m busting my arse for those fifty pence I won't be having you wasting it. You know what they’d think of you? What they’d think of me?”
She looks around before lowering her voice. “You know I'm moving out of White lodge right? Th—this is goodbye.”
Harry had never really taken the time to think about what he wanted to be when he grew up. Now it was all he thought about. The possibilities could have seemed endless, but they weren't. There was only one path he thought about. One road into his future that nagged at him and reached down into the very depth of child like wonder and hope he never thought he'd see again. No there was only one thing on his mind. One thing he had even thought bout before Miss and maybe even before ballet.
These first two chapters are the movie and some extra stuff. The rest is ballet school, romance and growing up.
Ron enters the room. He seems to look around the scene before his eyelids droop unimpressed. He had somehow managed, Harry doesn’t know how, to firmly wrap a towel around his wet hair like in the movies. Ron folds his arms.
“It’s a ballet school Potter, not much happens round here. We dance, we ache, we sleep and we gossip. It's the nature of such a place.”
He stretched next to her in practice. She was mumbling something to herself when he spoke. “Why do you try so hard?”
He doesn’t remember waking up. There was no room in his mind left for the memory of having breakfast and walking down those empty blue halls. One moment he was in a car, the next day he was practising in his studio.
Draco was fine with the cold. He was an Englishman after all. “Fuck off! Go play soccer or something!”
Harry walked amongst the regal walls to the faint sounds he was beginning to realise might actually be real. He was soon getting lost in the noise and hadn’t begun to notice his surroundings… until he felt his front collide with a box.
She let out an exaggerated sigh as frustration grows within her. “I don’t do it for the money Harry, If you're bloody well not interested that’s fine by me!”
“...My mother. She’s maybe danced every role imaginable in the ballet. Fathers a pianist. My grandmother taught the art in Italy. It was to be expected.”
Draco coughed from across the room. Seamus seemed to turn red and giggle before composing himself. Snape looked unimpressed as he replied. “Yes. I am aware.”
She’d only shook her head. “This Math homework yeah.” He’d sigh for she’d already finished all the homework.
Harry felt the ghost of a smile come upon his face. “I wish they’d play music more during my class.”
I hope to continue working on this fic more while also my others, i'm so attached to all of them though I can tell this fic is going to be chonky :D There's just so much planned so It might take a while but I hope it's all pan out.
girl. Harry could tell she knew how to dance, but only technically. She moved like a robot reciting words. She knew the moves, and could pull them off easily enough. it was as if she could remember how to do everything, but not why she had to do it, or as if she didn't understand. Hermione just always seemed so far away when she danced. It was like to her, this was just movement, a thing she had to do. She never seemed entirely present during the mixed gendered practise.
“Potter it’s fire. It’s a pretty normal thing to have distaste for. It's hot, it hurts and it’s dangerous. It’s like asking why you don't like...w—what don’t you like again?”
Harry kept himself sharp for the rest of the lesson. He watched the other boys leap across the floor one after the other.
He found himself amongst the similar group of his year on the unused basketball court. Harry, Dean and Seamus were huddled in the shade from the basket hoop's back though every few minutes they were forced to move an inch as the shadow itself moved along.
Harry’s glad he hears this now. If he’d heard it any sooner he might have punched the lass. But then maybe he hopes he might have heard it sooner. Then he wouldn't have maybe punched the blonde boy. And then maybe he would have a chance to get in.
He remembered how sophisticated the classes had looked. There seemed to be no students with any faults. Brilliantly postured peers he was soon to meet.
Harry was in the middle of a ballet class. He could laugh at the sight. The piano helped though and he was glad to see Ginny wasn't having all of a good time either.
The assembly had talked about the older years. Those students after sixteen were moved further into London near the theatres. Harry was glad for that. He’d never met many nice eighteen year olds.
. Funny that. Harry's first true heartbreak wasn't lost love or mind numbing loss. It wasn't even his fault. Just circumstance. God damn circumstance that made the earth shake and the heavens cry. Within seconds Harry watched his brother walk out of that courthouse and he pulled himself away from the wall to follow. All he could do was follow. No words formed and his throat felt dry in despair. The rooms blurred around him and seemed to move along while he stayed still. The only thing in focus was him, and the time.
One of the men leaned him forward to check his spine. Harry shivered as the man put pressure on each bump.
He made his way back into the pool of dancers. The difficulty annoyed him. He stared at the mirror and looked at the weirdest reflection he’d ever seen.
Indeed they had. Though somehow that hallway with it’s sunset tint, seemed to all but erase their grievances and left two boys calm and peaceful.
“Obviously. I think Seamus wants to hunt while ‘Mione wants to find. Other than that—Dean, Lavender, Parvati and I want to find a clearing to play soccer.”
They walked along in silence for a bit. Harry couldn’t tell if he liked Seamus or not. He seemed alright but he kind of reminded Harry of a happier upbeat oblivious Ron.
. I heard your mother was quite successful in her prima days, money aplenty. Do us all a favour and stop trying to be her.”
“He’s helping our class get ready, I didn’t want to bother him—His parents are here with the company he’s aiming for.”
They wrestle before falling into a tight hug. Cedric squeezes his eyes shut. “He’s only a boy. He’s only eleven for fucks sake!”
the closest things he had to cousins though. He’d known them all his life but only due to the facts that their respective parents were politicians.
He could see a class of girls around his age. They looked nothing like the class back home. They all looked very serious and focused. No one seemed to dance out of turn. He gulped. He was glad there was a piano playing. Piano soothed his nerves.
He touched the back of her shoulder slowly but she still jumped in surprise. She looked at him like he was a stranger.
noise coming from himself. He pushed away his confusion and shrugged before speaking. “Lovely song, my mother has the record.”
He needn’t remind himself though. The mirrors showed two boys, dancing in motion with eyebrows furrowed with arms snappy and slow. It looked almost like a show of superiority, a fight between two boys set to song. The lyrics may have talked about love but all Harry saw was a rivalry, a slow cool rivalry with music and dance.
His word sent Harry back a moment. The recital? It seemed shocking that the thought of it had barely crossed his mind. Of course he’d known there would be another one—there was one very year after all— His mind hadn’t registered that fact. It was funny how something of such big importance could slip one’s mind after it had already been done once.
Harry noticed the boy next to him seemed to sniffle slightly. His cheeks were shiny and his nose was red. Tears fell like sad notes on a piano and Harry looked away knowing they weren't for him to see.
Draco had stopped trying to keep his distance the moment he saw Harry walk up to the landline for the second time. He stopped trying to avoid sections of the rooms he knew Harry liked to dance in and ultimately Draco was aware he himself was the one to blame for their close proximity.
Molly Weasley finds their house. She tries to explain to his father. She hasn't realised there is no explaining. No words that could convince or draw sympathy from the shaky man. “Harry missed a very important audition today.”
She walked off and left him there. He stood confused for a moment as he watched the girls lean themselves forward on the barres and come back up with their arms in the air. He walked along the barre before stopping in front of a familiar figure. Ginny was there practising on the opposite side of him. He didn’t know much about ballet but he would have thought that the teacher's daughter would have been the best in the class. She clearly wasn’t as she quickly stopped her practise and turned to him.
Harry stilled and gazed around the room. He noticed how it was much easier to ignore someone when hidden in a class of many.
They both laughed as Ron dragged the rope Harry had climbed up. They ventured throughout the hall and Harry felt as if he was flying. Cold stiff stuffy air hit his face and fought against his laugh. He dropped down as quickly as he’d got up there.
He positioned his feet like he remembered and lifted his arms out. He was told to bend his knees and hold. He could feel them wobble slightly and he clenched his eyes shut.
It was exhilarating. Violins and orchestras put together by a lass with the voice of an angel. She sings and his mother screams. He thinks the song screamed too. The music had filled the car like water. Cool to the skin. He didn’t know noise could be cold. He didn’t know a lot of things.
Out of all of his endeavours general classes were maybe the worst part of his day, and he wasn’t a hundred percent sure if his limbs were sore from writing or dancing. His teacher for general science was a small squat woman who went by Miss Sprout. This was his only really remarkable class not for the subject but for the people.
Ron had his reasons practised. They'd had this same conversation on numerous occasions since Harry started. There was a slight difference this time. Ron usually stayed acres away fro the hall. Harry thought he was afraid to be pulled in.
“Oh!” a young feminine voice called out in surprise as she dropped the four pink boxes she was holding.
like was the punching part. He didn’t really know why. The other boys looked like they had fun when they did it. God knows Harry would love to pay back the times all the other boys had hit him.
Harry could hear sirens. This time he thought he might have imagined them though. They seemed like warning bells. They told him not to say what he was about to. They warned him to stay silent. He didn’t care though. Harry was an angry person, he got that from Amos.
He bright grin spread across his face. A charming pleased smile stared back from the mirror. He looked towards Mrs Weasley proud.
at her. He fumed and felt his ears turn red. She’d spoken those same words for the past two weeks and they echoed in his ear.
Thankfully he wasn’t the only one to fall over in class. Ginny didn’t even try, she just stood there. Watched or walked away.
“Did you hear? Apparently they approved so many lads this year there's going to be a small class of boys separately, about five I think.”
Draco who'd almost walked out of sight wasn’t able to see that all were silent as eyes drifted towards Harry.
Draco’s looks hadn’t changed much though recently his hair had gotten a little unkempt and his height was slowly but surely growing. His sparkling grey eyes still demanded to be admired though that much Harry was sure could never change.
The boy didn’t seem to huff at his physical exertion and continued. “You going to the Ballet school?”
Harry stood there sheepishly as Malfoy pushed him away. “Besides, aren’t we supposed to be practising our
His mother said one of his cousins had done it. Picked up his uncle's empty beer bottle and smashed it right on Harry's toddler forehead. It was in the before times so he didn’t remember it but his mother had told him he was lucky to be alive. He was even luckier to still have his eyesight.
Harry watched as Malfoy stared blankly at his own reflection. The boy had barely moved that entire week and Harry worried he might never dance again.
Harry looked down disappointed, he would have wished to see her dance again, maybe even watch Daniel’s performance.
It ended with simple and strong steps and carefully placed arm movements before spinning back around to face him. His face red with anger with one arm to the sky and one arm folded to his heart.
She see’s Cedric walk across the kitchen and easily picks him up onto the table. “Dance.” He commands.
Dean laughed. “Harry, you eat like a whale and dance like there's no tomorrow. If you don’t end up those two things then I’ll shrink.”
He gets closer but Amos doesn’t stop walking. There's a shake in his step and the other miners look away.
Amos knew it as late. He didn’t care. His legs ached and he flinched as the neighbours dogs barked at him but he didn’t care. He banged on the Weasleys door in a hurry.
Draco moved backwards and tried his mightiest to not let his ears turn red as the boy brushed past in a surprisingly gentle motion. “R—Right.”
He sits himself in the hall. His school bag forgotten on the ground next to him. He tears the envelope slowly open and braces himself before reading.
Harry nodded and looked up. The boy was no older than him but seemed to have much longer legs. Taller. Harry couldn't speak in the moment as he examined the boy next to him.
“Okay then... Farewell. You should receive your answer in a few weeks time. I hope you both understand that this
Seamus stumbled halfway through his. As he did Draco seemed to roll his eyes and look away. Snape tutted. “Again! Get this
Harry looked across the room despite himself. A stringy weak built boy with a rabbity appearance and a face almost too confident for the one he had stood next to an unsurprisingly bored Blaise.
Before he could however Draco turned his head away and lifted his chin up. “Of course not Father, don't be ridiculous. I told you. A school of this calibre would never tolerate a student with such violent tendencies.”
Cedric joked. “He’s probably gone off to join the circus buy the love of some pathetic girl. just follow him next time.”
Harry felt an offended sting in his chest, mostly because her words were true. He stayed silent until he realised, “Hey! You're a dancer too.”
Greg slumped against a wall and looked across book spines. “We've been dropped off, our parents are all having dinner together.”
...and at that moment it was really annoying. Harry was figuring out he didn’t like posh people very much.
The woman seemed to look at the next name and sighed to herself. She seemed to know what reaction it would get and took a breath before speaking.
Snape nodded in approval. “Yes Mr Malfoy, very good. As males we are to provide the bravado to a performance and show off our strength. The females work on elegance, posture, flight and what have you. Of course dance can be done by anyone but the ballet is here to show off your strengths. Seamus Again!”
Miss called that type of dance contemporary. Before Harry would have just called it movement. This type of dance was well suited to his boots though. The hard noise they made could almost add to the song and he was glad to see how fun dance could be without structured and practise.
Seamus forced out a laugh. “Guess you really are an over thinker then. I think I’ll miss that...and you doing all our homework.”
The shock of what he was about to do hadn’t really set in mentally. He was off on his own, ready to bust his ass for one of the most difficult careers paths he could have chosen. He was only Eleven. He didn't realise it yet. He wouldn't have cared even if he did.
Their silhouettes were pronounced against the orange light from a large window in a large empty room where they forged their dance and entangled their lives into each others once more. That second year though uneventful and sad, built the foundations of possibilities. And where there were possibilities…
Mrs Weasley didn’t seem to like it either as she walked up to him and stepped on his foot, firm but not enough to hurt. “Boots off! What size are you?”
Harry ran throughout the theatre scouting for the shoe boxes. He hadn’t time to worry about his own performance as the only thought on his mind was his friend.
He spent almost every afternoon with the blond boy. Whether they talked or not didn’t matter as they opened a new book from one of Snape's endless shelves and picked out something new to practise. They never failed to end the day exhausted with aching tired feet making Harry almost wish
He turned his back to his Dad to spin and then came back around to kick the air. Amos leaned back in reaction but Harry didn’t stop.
Editors Note: I actually appreciate this chapter now more than the first one. It's nice to revisits this story nearly a year later. Not much has changed but still. I fear the spelling mistakes to come. I tried to fix the ones here and I reread all my chapters before posting but somehow some slip through. Anyway enjoy!
It was once a library. A family archive of books and papers. In the most technical terms it still was. The large open space still had rows upon rows of books and the walls were all covered well. Draco had been seven when he’d begged for his own barre and dancing space. He’d begged for one of the off rooms in the library to be his. He’d cried and whined and refused to eat for weeks.
The fire seemed to reflect in Potters glasses and Draco decided he’d had enough of the monster and turned around.
Holy shit this took me three weeks to write and I'm still not happy with it but I'm tired and can't progress until this is done. Sorry if there are any mistakes and I hope I didn't do Draco too dirty.
He had this routine like clockwork. Cedric and Amos would leave by early dawn leaving Harry enough time to pretend he was on a trampoline. He’d stay like that until the timer rang from the kitchen. He’d skip every other step in a hurry to get the boiled eggs out of the cloudy water and into the holders. He'd gotten used to eggs.
He couldn’t see the girls but they weren’t the ones that were interesting anyway. They were blocked off by mirrors brought up by Moody to the other boys dismay. What
Draco stepped on his foot on the way out. The other boy pushed him into the wall. Draco almost laughed.
“Parents mostly, some companies will be out there though, watching the older years and looking out for any promising talent to keep tabs on.”
Draco found Harry not caring made Draco want to speak more. “It’s like my entire life takes place in the afternoons here, and no matter how cold it gets the sky is always stained orange. We seem to live during a constant sunset.”
Not just the blazing, blinding kind that heated his face from metres away. Not just the horrifically hot kind that made his stomach turn and eyes water. No, his fear was driven from all kinds of fire. Even the slightest flicker from a candle could set in an unfounded panic from deep within the boy which meant he has, on many occasions stepped out of a room with heavy breaths.
Hermione hadn’t taken his advice but Draco could almost see the internal struggle within her eyes every time she approached a barre or put on Pointe shoes.
Hinting at whose going to be focused on in the next chapter ;) This one took a while to get inspired to write but when i did it only took a day so progress!
Harry didn’t think he’d look good in a dress. Somehow Ron suited it though, the yellow with red ribbons almost matched Ron’s hair and warm skin tone.
Harry doesn’t know what went down. All he really knows is one minute he’s forbidden from even thinking about ballet and the next Cedric and Amos are doing all they can to save up for the bus fare to London.
He didn't know if his words were an insult or not. They still seemed to sting and he wanted to sigh in relief when his name was called.
The man’s eyes went from Harry all along the line. It may have seemed normal to the other boys but Harry could tell he was looking from himself to Draco.
(I usually wouldn't include this as the chapter titles are songs but I really liked this selection so enjoy!)
There was no tact in the way he flung his arms up in the air as he jumped on an old springing mattress. A child like smile on his face even though above the music he could almost hear chanting and sirens.
but I didn’t really care. At least Not until it started getting cold and dark. I didn’t know where to go.”
“Oh don’t be an arse Daniel.” She cracked a grin towards him before going to the recorder and turning the vinyl.
She seemed to roll her eyes but he couldn’t see. “Not everything is about ballet you know. I swear you dancers only think about music and moves.”
Molly crosses her arms. She can see the temper runs in the family. “Excuse you! This is not for my gratification.”
Harry knew this. He knew she didn’t like it. It was obvious from her lack of drive, lack of… everything that made all his friends. She was different. Even when she drew her closest similarities to Draco in intelligence...they could see she was an outsider. An infiltrator from the outside world. He knew this fact, but he didn’t understand it.
Harry had been thankful that some length had reappeared before school had started back up but unfortunately there had been no hiding his scar.
Potter seemed to debate his next action before frowning and shrugging the other boy off. “Suite yourself then, christ.”
Moody walked over and dropped the halls keys into his hand like he did most days. “Stay here until you get that punch right. Give the keys to Mrs Weasley after.”
Harry stood there in silence for a moment. He looked down at his aching leg relived to be on the ground one again. He looked around before lifting it up once more. He never thought a leg could look pretty.
Lavender and the Patil twins seemed content in their big sun hats as they had the foresight to pack them. Hermione herself had a massive blue umbrella held above her head as she nibbled on her sandwich. Somehow it seemed Draco and Blaise had been allowed to share her shade though Harry was sure she only let them out of fear.
Amos knew what it was like outside of the bus. The pushing, the shouting. He knew what it was like when an angry crowd became one and made towards their target.
Harry didn’t want to be a miner. He didn’t like the idea of always being dirty, of being so deep in the earth and working hundreds of feet underground. The thought of busting his back to pick and stab at hard stone all for a lump of black. Cedric had said the mining wasn’t scary, the people paying the miners were. Cedric says a lot of stuff like that. It’s why all the police are around.
This was going to be one really long chapter about the entire first year but I decided to spit them yet again~ also I know nothing about what the school is actually like so don't @ me lol;3
Harry didn’t know how many students he expected the Royal Ballet to have. He didn’t expect many seeing as it was one of the more niche career paths to go down. Even still the numbers around him were daunting. His old school hadn’t more than maybe a hundred odd students, maybe even less. Around him now he could estimate maybe two hundred, all from the ages of eleven to sixteen.
Harry never visited his biological father's grave. He never had the opportunity nor the need to. He doesn’t even remember the man, not even his mind images or dreams. He thinks that means his dad was a miner. Only miners children never saw their dads for long in Everington.
Cedric tries to latch himself onto the bus but a cop pulls him towards the concrete. Two of his lads pull the bloke off Cedric and he takes the opportunity to run back into the crowd.
Wistfully watching his classmates was fastly becoming a new hobby of Harry’s. He can’t say he had quite the knack for analysing that Draco did but he did find there was something to be gained from the act. His year was quick and fun, it seemed everyone was fast paced, goofy and determined. A mix that made Harry laugh and his new partner scoff. They were all different amongst their sameness, and it was nothing but peculiar. Harry could imagine the laughs Ron or Ginny would give him at the disclosure of his new hobby so he never spoke of it even though their calls fall rarely to twice a term.
The first time he tried to pirouette at home he fell into the bathtub. In hindsight he didn’t think it was a very good idea to fill the tub up before his impromptu practise.
at the phone he’d been looking for. The boy hadn’t seemed to notice him and paced back and forth looking conflicted at the red landline built into a box in the wall. Everything from the phone to the boy looked out of place.
happened. Nothing noteworthy anyway. He couldn’t say much about it really. But the memory stuck. Very specific details like it was all important. He could picture how the room looked in the afternoon light, remember how sweat glistened off of nearly everyone in the hot hall.
There were a few times Harry could swear he heard humming. A small imitation of a piano or sombre melody. Harry might have hummed back if he could solemnly swear he’d actually heard the gentle noise. But he wasn’t sure, and he couldn’t risk it not being. He didn't know what to make of it, so he didn’t. Every afternoon was a surprise, and every memory was never recalled. Harry pushed those moments into boxes inside his head, there was no use trying to find meaning in placed there weren't.
She didn’t bat an eyelash before introducing herself, seemingly knowing he didn't remember who she was. “Hermione.”
Harry stilled for a moment. He saw Ron's ears turn red. He shrugged and beckoned his friend to follow him.
Due to this free time Harry would find himself in that small empty corridor with the landline every afternoon. Sometimes he didn’t even make a call. Sometimes he would stare at the faded red paint and gaze over the number wheel. He could flick the wheel around in boredom sometimes. He could pick the phone up to his ears, tap it. Listen to the monotonous hum it played.
The school settled into the warm wind and all was quiet when Harry found Malfoy by the landline. The boy had gotten closer and closer to the box, Harry could reckon any day now he’ll make the call.
“Well of course there are still going to be mixed gendered classes but they like having the lads train together. I hope I end up in the smaller one.”
“You better take better care of them. I saw how you acted at boxing last week. I’m paying good money for those classes.”
...Ginny walked along the street with him. She always seemed to find an excuse to walk him places. Back then he didn't bother to notice. A stick she'd found knocked against weather damage posters and found its way against a wall of police shields. It was strange how easy everyone had adjusted to the sight of it. The men didn't pay them much attention. A couple may have grunted.
. Cedric left almost every night and came back with more bruises than he started with. Amos didn’t speak other than to yell or tell Harry what to do.
He bangs on the mat. He can feel the tears well up before he even speaks. He’s got his escape plan and he can hear his heart thump rapidly within his chest.
There were a few times she'd say the same thing Draco did. The same advice. Harry never wavered when he heard her though. She was kind and useful and helped where Malfoy couldn’t.
Harry thought he had done rather well all things considered. But there was a problem. A big one. Harry couldn't hear music but he could hear the sound of his own feet hitting the floor. He wondered if they had always been that loud?
Lucius had indulged Draco. Figured it was a phase or some obscure hobby. Draco barely left that room.
It was like he’d dug so deep within himself that he found a well. A well full of energy. One that when it was found just
“Don’t act foolish. You're smarter than that. It’s why you don’t belong here. A medical school sure, Law maybe? Even a musical arts school would better suit your incessant need for learning. This place isn’t for you and face it, even if you graduate no respectable company would even go near you despite your mother's legacy.”
Everington had a library. Well...It was more like a van filled with books but the sign in front did say library. He’d spent a few days looking at all the covers before finding a book about Ballet positions and movements. It seemed simple enough to follow so he tried to take it. Unfortunately he hadn’t been allowed to borrow it on a junior ticket.
Snape snapped. “That's where you're wrong! You don’t try like the others you just do as the others do! For your own sake leave while you can and live to be employable.”
Potter shook his head slightly with his thinking eyes closed. “Not true, I can name so many songs not about those two things.”
stupid though, I mean we're like the only year not dancing to instrumental music. It looks like we haven't learned an ounce of actual ballet.”
It seemed everyone behind him in the hall made their way to walk, leaving maybe fifty odd students left.
That was to be expected in most, children hardly remembered early childhood. Even expected things could not be embraced. This just made him feel odd. He was a puzzle with missing pieces. It was as if he had
Draco took the time to compose himself before speaking. “Potter was telling us about his cross dressing friend and the ludicrous activities he’d been up to.”
. He stilled. Everyone seemed to still. There was a beat of silence before the hall realised he had finished speaking and a round of hasty applause followed after. Dumbledore might have smiled though it was hard to tell behind the beard and he soon walked off the stage and out of sight.
knows his father should be showing up any moment with the car, and to avoid a fuss he really should push the other boy away and go sit somewhere else.
What was worse was the fact that when they danced together, all the teacher in Snape saw was pure potential. And that—that made his skin crawl.
She nodded. “Yeah I don’t think my solution will work well for you...I do have an idea about the performance though.”
She seemed to look afraid before looking offended. “What do you know? You're just some pompous rich kid thinking the world revolves around what you want.”
Harry looked towards the clock, they had around seventy minutes until Penelope’s final performance. “Have you told a teacher?”
Penelope smiled. “The teachers allow us older years some extra practise as long as we don’t damage the room.”
Harry knew of expectations. He’d iced in them and then fought his way out of them. He knew how hard they could be. Even so he’d never seen such arbitrary expectations in his life. And even with all his worry of losing a friend, a teaspoon of pettiness arose.
Harry can tell that Dad agrees with him, he’s just more afraid. Cedric isn’t afraid, Harry’s never seen Cedric afraid.
He took out his boredom on his peers and spied around the group. He could see Seamus and Lavender giggle in secret and Dean loom on confused with something sad and lonely in his eyes. Draco rolled his own eyes at the show of young drama knowing full well the hypocrite he was.
Ron sat himself upon the bin eating a jam sandwich. He swung his legs and eyed the boys that walked past up and down.
He pondered going to Mrs Weasley’s studio, he hadn’t seen her in nearly a year and a half now. He brushed the thought away quickly as he passed down the stairs. Something within himself dreaded the idea of going and talking to the Weaslesy and his old friends.
Mrs Weasley met him on weekends and Wednesdays afternoons. She told him he would have to practise on his own most days but he mostly kept it to the days he saw her.
She spoke morbidly and though it was shocking, Harry couldn't help but appreciate it slightly. "Oh."
Small Harry wasn’t paying attention to his crying mother. He cried all the time so action wasn’t anything new. What was new was the
This chapter is a little short mostly due to the fact that's it's been in my drafts for over a year know and I haven't been able to work on it until recently. Happy Reading!
. Earlier that morning they hardly did anything but argue as Snape prepared them for the rest of the year and the way they were seemed to make no sense. Draco wondered if they were rivals. It felt like a rivalry.
Hermione seemed to almost cry though Harry couldn’t quite tell. For a moment it sounded like a sad bitter laugh. “My mother…”
That afternoon he watches Cedric get chased. He watched as batons and angry police kick and hit him until his white shirt turns red. Harry can't even scream. Just sigh and watch his older brother get thrown into the police car. A slow dread seeps into  his bones. He can hardly feel as the numbness grows.
He was going to be stuck here he's sure of it. His world seemed to crumble around him and his aching glossy eyes begged to whomsoever could hear.
“You said Snape doesn’t let you practice with music until it’s perfect? And you haven't even heard the song. I think in theory that works but me and you are a little different Harry. We
Dean, Potter and Seamus were in the same bar across from Draco. As they stretched the boys began to chatter.
He usually found himself next to a girl named Luna when he wasn't being the laughing stock of the class. Luna was a bit like Ginny in the fact that she doesn’t really do Ballet. She usually just twirls around and looks like she's lost. She speaks in riddles and goes on about nothing in particular. Ginny seemed to find her compelling. Luna reminds him of his Grandma.
“No offence but that has nothing to do with me.” Malfoy went to turn away and Harry was stricken with the desire to make him
Before the boy could finish, Harry leaned himself forward to wrap Draco in a tight hug. It was positioned oddly at an awkward angle and Draco’s shoulder knocked his chin but that didn’t matter as he tried his best to comfort the lonesome friend. They shook with heavy breaths like a house of cards about to fall and each grip from the other became tighter and tighter by the second, as if each boy was afraid the other would crumble.
—”  His voice turned quiet and Draco’s cheeks became an odd bashful colour, causing the boy to quickly turn away back to his practise.
like sports days. He'd huff and turn red and once he'd even coughed up blood. This meant every time they ran on the grounds he'd pull them away to skip. Harry didn’t feel the need to force his only friend to go through any pain, so he followed.
No matter how hard Harry tired he always seemed to dance in the same area Malfoy did. He was thankful that most of his stretching problems were being overlooked but every stumble he made seemed to make the other boy dance better. It was almost insufferable.
Harry doesn’t even know why Amos still keeps giving him boxing money when both Cedric and him are out on strike. He was was waiting for an excuse to stop.
The boys quickly shuffled to follow his instruction. Snape seemed to eye out all their abilities before taking them to the floor to practise stretches.
Harry didn’t follow this advice. He didn’t follow it because Malfoy was always mean, and was always surrounded by empty space.
Over time Harry had learned a few things during Ballet class. He’d learned first to fifth position and was quite proud at how fast he’d gotten them. He was still behind the girls though. He knew that. He remembered Ginny mentioning that Dancers had to start young. He wondered if he started too late. Half the girls could already spin and come back to the same spot.
(Going through some more editing. Didn't even realise my seventh chapter was still in the drafts. Rereading this makes me realise how fast paced the first two chapters are. I wont change this because I like the ballet school aspect of this story more but just beware. Go watch the movie if you want a better telling of this aspect of the story. Thanks if you enjoy though!)
Clumsy Potter blind as a bat even with his glasses had held onto his arm harshly while stumbling in the dark and Draco had been too amused to leave.
The drive seemed to last an eternity as Cedric toed the line between the speed limit and and cursed every other minute.. Harry couldn't stop himself from worriedly tapping his feet as stars started to appear into the darkened sky.
They sat like that. In sombre silence. Harry fiddled with his tie and sleeveless button up as he waited for the other boy to stop crying. Harry began to find he hated when other people cried. He especially hated when Malfoy cried. He wasn’t sure whether to feel pity or empathetic. Wasn’t sure if he was allowed to not care or if he did actually care.
Hermione does not understand it. She and Pansy have been observing them for weeks, and they both agree that something is there. They had planned this party together, hoping forced contact would nudge the the two of them in the right direction.
As it happens, Harry has only ever known these tame Gryffindor parties until returning for an Eighth Year at Hogwarts, where inter-house unity has been highly encouraged, and so, predictably, each House has taken a turn hosting a large party
But something about that moment stayed with Hermione, for whatever reason. It has to be important. She feels the tingling sensation she always feels when the right answer is just beyond her reach. All she has to do is reach harder.
“If someone you love,” Harry says, blushing at the raised brow he receives, “plans to...hurt someone else you love, and you can’t say anything because either way someone gets hurt, what do you do?”
They fall silent, and Ron and Hermione share a look that has nothing to do with what type of girl Hermione might be. Just this morning a rumor that Ginny and Dean broke up started circulating around, and still, it seems, Harry has not heard it.
He nods silently, then kisses her cheek absently, like he’s trying not to listen, trying not to understand her full meaning. She grabs his wrist and holds him steady.
“Draco?” A familiar drawling voice calls out from behind his curtains. Harry silently pulls the Cloak over himself. Draco can almost taste his heartbeat in his throat.
“I know.” Draco feels the futility of it all, and wonders why he even bothered fighting to begin with. Perhaps to save what little pride he has left. But Harry always gets what he wants in the end.
Harry blocks it easily, brushing it away with the back of his hand like an annoying fly. “Come on, Draco, is that the best you’ve got?”
several times, until finally succeeding with one last swing of his wand to stop the light and returning the room to darkness. He breathes hard. There is a long silence on the other side of the curtains.
Dean flashes her one last easy, sated smile before she creeps out of his four-poster bed, the curtains ruffling softly as she passes them.
Harry looks at the list disdainfully. He decides that if he cannot manage Potions, he would be dismal in Alchemy. He is not quite sure what Arithmancy is, but if it is anything like Mathematics in Muggle education, then he is better off avoiding it. Ancient Runes sounds interesting, but Harry remembers from Miss Granger that the workload was quite intense. That leaves French, Wandlore, and Healing.
Harry watches Draco pace nervously in the shadows beside the large, oak wood doors of the Great Hall. Draco sifts his fingers through his blond locks, and Harry wonders not for the first time how they would feel. Soft, wispy, like finely spun thread? Or silky, velvety, smooth strands that he could grip in his hand?
“Merlin, Potter, isn’t it enough that some of them have lost their minds?” Draco says sharply. Harry ignores him, but his mouth tenses into a line.
“—for afternoon tea, yes, I know,” Pansy finishes for him. He looks embarrassed, but pleased, blushing like a school girl.
“Well, I’ve always been a liar, haven’t I?” Draco asks softly. Harry flinches, and for a moment Draco almost pities him. Almost.
Draco looks torn between wanting to confide in Hermione and also wanting to keep it to himself. Something tingles Hermione’s memories, like a feather brushing against her neck, and she decides to press just a little more.
“I mean, yes,” Ginny says reluctantly. “But it can’t be you.” She hesitates, then adds, “At least, you can’t be that for me. If you asked me, though, I could be that for you.”
“I have to be at the Ministry,” Draco says in a single breath, and without waiting for Harry to say another word, he Apparates.
“The letter states that we must enroll in nine classes, which leaves six openings for other classes. And it looks like we have...yes, fourteen electives to choose from,” Miss Granger says, looking up at Weasley and Harry expectantly. “Well? Which classes have you two decided to take?”
“Lavender…” Ron comes up with a million reasons not to stay, but compared to Lavender’s plump lips, her wispy blonde hair floating like golden sunshine around her heart-shaped face, and above all—perhaps even the only real attraction—her willingness, eagerness, and simple availability, made Ron hesitate.
“Oh Harry, why can’t I remember the preparation of the Dreamless Sleep potion?” Hermione complains out loud. She looks off into the distance, biting her lip, her knee bouncing rapidly.
“Do you trust me?” Harry asks, holding out a hand. Draco’s gaze flickers from the outstretched hand and back to Harry’s eyes. His light grey eyes darken as if shadowed, and he swallows uneasily. Harry follows the movement of his pale, gleaming throat.
“Not that we know of, at least,” Hermione amends. “But he hasn’t left the flat in five days. Rarely leaves his bed to answer our fire calls. We tried to come over and find out what’s wrong, but he was always either asleep or drunk.”
“Yes.” Harry leans back, his legs spread apart in an intimidating way that Hermione has rarely seen him do, the last time being a certain Triwizard tournament when Ron had gotten all mad and Hermione had tried to convince them to talk. She had guessed he felt hurt by Ron's rejection. So what is he hurt about now? “I just know. Is that not enough for you? Do you not trust me anymore?”
“You spend many nights here with that boy,” Lucy observes gently. Harry chooses to stare at the blanket, picking at a loose thread with a focus he doesn’t feel.
“As such, I will begin with an explanation of a few important changes to your curriculum, as I am sure you all noticed in my letter. Firstly, I will be teaching Transfigurations for Eighth Years only. It is a mandatory course where we will be applying past curriculum with my guidance. Some of you may have already guessed, but this application will primarily include restoration of the castle and castle grounds. Much of the work you will be doing might be tedious, but I have faith it will also be healing in more ways than one.
“You were not ready,” Dumbledore says impatiently. He sits down on the edge of his desk, restless. “I did not want to burden you with this until absolutely necessary.”
Harry is the first at the tent flap. He hesitates, then says the password. The flaps rolls up by magic, and Harry ducks inside. To his amazement, he has entered the Gryffindor common room, or at least what looks almost identical to it. Weasley and Miss Granger follow behind him joined by gasps and surprised laughs.
Harry stared at Draco, stunned, and didn’t answer for a long time. Then, “What do you want, Draco? Because it seems like you’re lying to yourself just as much as me.”
“Sometimes,” Hermione says, shaking her head and sighing, a combination of gestures that is commonly performed in reaction to anything Harry Potter, “I want to strangle him.”
Harry moved one hand between their bodies to massage Draco’s inflamed skin, never breaking eye contact so he could see the agony seeping there afresh.
Harry looped Draco’s limps arms around his neck and putting his hands in position for a bridal carry, lifted Draco off the dildo, the action only getting a soft mewl in response, muttered straight into the side of his neck.
As the endearment fell from his lips, so did Draco’s gaze. His submission was already creeping into the space between them. Harry loved how easily Draco gave it over to him, this priceless gift.
When Draco finally managed to come, it was one long shuddering scream that seemed to be ripped out of his throat by jagged claws. After the shocks had subsided, Harry carefully undid the restraints and massaged all the limbs to ensure circulation. The bruises were blooming beautifully against that pale skin and Harry dropped a kiss on every one of them. Reaching between Draco’s legs, he pulled the dildo out as carefully as he could but Draco still flinched. His hole was slightly gaping at this point and Harry couldn't help run his fingers along the painfully red rim, eliciting even more flinching and a few mewls. Pulling Draco up into a seating position (one that put more pressure on his sore hole) he got him to drink some water and a few strength replenishing potions.
Draco’s eyes were watering and his mouth opened to say something. Probably an apology. But it never came. Instead another wordless cry was wrenched from his very soul as the surprise kicked in.
Eyes still trained on Draco’s face so as to not miss a single expression, he waved his hand at the bag and the solution started flowing through the tube and into Draco’s ass. At first Draco only let out a little squeak at the sensation of fluid filling his intestines, but it didn't take long for the first signs of discomfort to start showing. And the pain as the Castile soap solution irritated his sensitive insides and the cramping started.
“Now I hope you don't think I have forgotten about that little part where you fell asleep in the middle of sex.” He chuckled.
“It's ok pet. You can come on my cock, but only after I have finished. Do I make myself clear?” he gritted through his teeth, barely hanging on to his own restraint as he pounded into the tight wet heat that pulsed around his cock. His bollocks had drawn up tight, the heat at the base of his spine intensifying, and he knew he was not going to last the next minute.
Harry couldn't stop the little gasp that escaped him at the sight of Draco’s tight hole straining so hard against the massive intruder inside it. The rim was a dark red and swollen and Harry knew without touching it that it would feel hot. He reached for the pump with one hand, using the other to tug and twist the plug and hear the resultant screams.
Draco’s eyes continued to map his face, faster now as the dregs of sleep vanished from his mind. Harry must have given something away, judging from Draco’s sudden sharp inhale.
Covering Draco's white knuckled fists with his own broad brown palms, he leaned forward and waited till Draco made eye contact before he spoke.
“Stunning as always pet” he murmured just loud enough to reach Draco. He was rewarded with a charming blush that he could see traveling from his chest up to his sharp cheekbones. “Come sit and eat.” He pulled out the chair and Draco walked over on silent feet to take his place as instructed.
Draco’s screams had died down to broken whimpers by now. His breaths were still coming in erratic bursts and Harry continued to soothe him with his hands and words.
“I love you so much Draco. Every time you let me hurt you, everytime you suffer, not just for me but for yourself you take my breath away. Your agony and your submission are the greatest gifts you have ever given me and I want you to know I will never take them for granted.”
“You have some unresolved demons,” Ginny says, standing up, “that are getting in the way of you and the love of your life. You know what I would do in your place? If my love with Luna was at stake? I wouldn’t stop a second until all of those demons were dead.”
“But I would take the book, if you’re offering,” Draco says, clearly attempting to change the subject. Harry holds out the book, and after a moment, Draco strides over, his robes twisting and curling around his ankles like a dark frothing sea, and grabs the book, pressing it under his arm possessively.
No one is in the common room, thankfully. Harry hates answering uncomfortable questions. He easily exits through the Fat Lady, throwing her a flirty wink to keep silent. She fans her face and blushes, but doesn’t say a word.
“You’re right, Draco,” Harry says, and it’s the first time he’s used his first name. Draco can scarcely move a muscle as Harry takes one more step forward so he’s close enough to touch if Draco just reaches his hand out a few inches. He never noticed the sprinkle of sun spots on Harry’s nose, only a shade darker than his skin. “We’re not friends, are we?”
Harry doesn’t answer, because they both already know the answer. Ginny lets Harry rest his head against hers, and they stand like that in the kitchen for a long time.
“No.” Ginny follows Harry into the kitchen. She doesn’t have many memories here. In some ways, it’s a blessing. “Portkeying and alcohol don’t mix.”
Maybe all along Draco has been worried that other people would find out and they would hate him for loving Harry, and for Harry loving him. But maybe all along Draco should have been worried about
“I wanted to talk with you,” Harry says calmly, looking around to make sure they aren’t attracting attention. Draco laughs derisively.
Before she braces herself for the tumbling commute home, Hermione envisions walking through the front door, seeing Ron gape at her new midnight blue pant suit that she has to admit, shows off her figure very nicely, and seeing the happiness radiate from him at her surprise.
Harry stares at her with his usual intensity, his green eyes bright, reflecting tendrils of fire. With gentle fingers he reaches out and tucks a loose strand of red hair behind her ear.
“She knows.” Pansy shrugs, as if to say there was nothing to do now. “She figured it out, like I said she would. I assume the Weasley knows as well.”
“Harry, please,” Draco whispers. He reaches his arms out, as if to beckon Harry, and Harry bends over the side of the couch to try and pacify him. When Draco’s hands find Harry’s arms, he grasps them tightly and pulls, and the momentum brings Harry on top of Draco.
“Harry? Is that you?” It’s Lucy, coming from the pantry. Harry’s heart starts to pound, and he grabs Draco’s arm, pulling him off the counter. He crouches down and quickly scoops up the book, then follows after Harry.
Draco never considered himself fond of physical affection; it wasn’t the traditional way to show love in his family. But he’s found that Harry’s warm touches, brief presses of the palm against his thigh or his back, simple touches, really, that do not suggest anything else, have almost a grounding effect on Draco, as if all this time he never knew he needed it so badly, someone to touch him like Harry does, to make sure he’s there.
“It’s okay to cry,” Pansy says quietly. She looks into the fireplace, as if revisiting a memory long settled into the haze of the past. “It’s okay to be heartbroken.”
It takes a minute for Harry to think straight again. He distantly feels Pansy lift herself off the couch. Draco collapses beside him. His blonde hair sticks to his forehead. He kisses Harry’s chest.
“Here” he looped the tube between Draco’s legs, careful to avoid any contact with his still semi-erect cock. “Hold this”
Harry stayed there for a minute more, looking at Draco with the eyes of a long term play partner and lover. He looked till he was satisfied.
“Harrrrry!” Draco’s scream threatened to make Harry come right there and then. He held the nozzle at its widest part right at the rim, making sure Draco felt the stretch as much as possible. With this other hand he firmly pushed against Draco's abs to keep him in place. He pulled the nozzle out all the way and gave Draco just a second to take a deep breath before pushing it all the way in again.
“Merlin Draco you feel so good!” He groaned while below him Draco thrashed as much as his tight bindings would allow.
Draco could only groan louder and thrust faster against Harry's relentless fingers in response. Harry knew Draco loved it when he talked dirty to him. He captured his lips in another bruising kiss as he grabbed the base of the plug and pulled hard, tasting the scream that burst out of his lover. He let it go and watched as Draco’s hole swallowed it back inside like the first meal of a starving man.
When the last blow was done, Harry dropped the paddle on the floor and helped Draco move onto his side, taking the pressure off his overworked shoulder.
Clearly Draco had failed to notice that the plastic bag was full once again. And this time when Harry pushed the nozzle back inside that puffy hole Draco's anguish was sweeter than before.
Harry had just finished setting the breakfast at the table when Draco appeared in the doorway. And just like it had 5 years ago when they had started, Harry’s body still tightened deliciously at the gloriousness that was a naked Draco Malfoy. Every pale sinewy inch of that body held the appeal of a blank canvas for the artist in Harry. He wanted to spend the rest of life worshipping at the altar of his lover’s beauty and grace. And when Draco added the gift of his submission to the mix, as he had now, with his head slightly bent, his shoulders pulled back and his hands behind his back, it was all Harry could do to not fall to his knees and lick his way up from the soles of Draco's feet to that sensitive place behind his ear that never failed to elicit a delicate shiver. He gave himself a moment to relive the time he had done exactly that, but just a moment. Right now, his pet was waiting for him to pull himself together and take them on the glorious journey he had promised.
“You can take this time at the table to ask any questions you might have about what's going to happen today or raise any concerns. You have permission to speak.”
Harry nodded at him to continue. He watched every shade from agony to pleasure skid across Draco’s face as he rode that dildo, chasing his orgasm. Sweat bloomed over his whole body, hanging off the ends of his eyelashes for a few moments before plummeting to his flushed chest and sliding down to pool at his groin. He was debauchery come to life, unfettered desire unravelling on Harry’s ancient coffee table.
“It's ok pet. It's just water this time. You will take it. And this time I want you to be perfectly still and silent. Not a peep from you unless it's your safeword. Am I understood?”
Draco got into position sluggishly, every movement reminding him that there was a fist inside his ass.
Harry got back to his feet and gave Draco a once over, eyes snagging at his rock hard cock dripping and smearing precome all around his belly button. He ignored it again. His pet would not be indulged today, not that way at least.
Draco just lay there and took it, body trembling continuously, resigned to whatever Harry decided to give him.
“Come on then. Let's start the show.” He patted Draco’s rump encouragingly and shooed him on his way.
“Now,” he said as he sent the glass back to the kitchen, “get up on the couch, face towards the back knees pulled up.
The tears brimming in Draco’s eyes had started steadily falling over now, too overwhelmed with everything he was feeling right then for him to exercise any control over his response, not that Harry let him have any such control when they played anyway. He wrenched every feeling from Draco as if he owned them and Draco couldn't dare to withhold what belonged to Harry.
Harry raised his hand and summoned something from their bedroom. It whizzed past Draco’s head and when his eyes settled on it, they widened with equal parts fear and lust.
They spent the next hour just walking aimlessly by the river. Harry pumped the plug three more times during that and only agreed to return home when Draco simply could not take another step without agonizing pain and pleasure shooting up his spine and frying his brain.The plug continuously battered his overworked prostate and it was getting harder for Harry to keep him from drifting off into that lovely floaty space where only sensation was real and everything else a hazy blur he couldn't be arsed to care about.
"Brace yourself. I'm going to pull the nozzle out and you better not create a mess here or I will make you clean it up, with your tongue.” He warned Draco who simply hung his head with humiliation.
He took a moment to glance down at Draco’s cock to find it still hard. Even as he watched, a drop of clear fluid welled at the tip. Giving in to temptation he reached over and swiped it with a thumb, the barely there touch making Draco mewl. He brought his thumb over to Draco's mouth. “Already making a mess. Such a needy pet. Clean it up.”
“Now, I think 20 strikes should suffice for this infraction.” He waited for Draco to acknowledge him.
The rest of breakfast was spent in an uncomfortable silence. Well, Harry supposed it was uncomfortable for Draco considering how his cock had been hard since he sat down for the meal and had been steadily neglected since which of course only made it harder and the cycle continued. Harry made sure that Draco finished his simple meal of toast and tea and a tall glass of water. He would need the fluids, and the stack of potions he had in his bathroom cabinet would take care of the rest as the day progressed. Ah Magic!
Harry threaded his hands through the shiny blond hair that was by then damp with sweat and pulled his head back just before Draco was able to get his favourite treat .
“Then I will give you a choice, love.” Harry summoned the toy box once again. He pulled out a paddle with holes that he loved to use on Draco’s delectable derriere. And an inflatable butt plug. He laid them both on the bed where Draco could see them. “That plug goes into your lovely hole. Now the only lube you get is the ginger oil. So you can pick, do you want me to shove that inside you dry or with the oil that burns.”
As Draco stood up to follow the instructions, Harry made his way to the broom closet to retrieve what he needed next. He took his time, cleaned up a few cobwebs while he was there to make sure Draco was already kneeling when he went back. After all, his pet loved surprises.
“Green” Draco replied instantly. The fluids and the potions seemed to have put some color back into his cheeks and Harry was glad because he would need all that strength for what came next .
He let his hands linger on Draco's shoulders, rubbing them down soothingly before he crossed over to take his own seat.
“We are not even halfway through my plans for you, pet.” He watched Draco, documenting his reaction to that statement. Draco just licked his lips and kept his eyes somewhere in the vicinity of Harry’s chest.
He carried Draco to their bedroom, putting him down and arranging him so that he was on his stomach. Harry situated himself in between Draco’s legs and rubbed his palms gently over them.
Draco continued to look at the plate in front of him while he eagerly shook his head “No questions or concerns Harry.”
Draco’s hips stuttered, his eyes blinked owlishly as if the words had not quite made it from his ears to his brain. When they did, he shook his head wildly.
Draco gave a small sleepy and satisfied smile and Harry wondered if he thought they were done now. Wouldn't do to give his pet any wrong ideas.
Draco’s mouth opened and closed mindlessly and it gave Harry an idea. He freed his cock from his pants that he hadn't bothered buttoning back up. He wasn't totally hard yet, but it was getting there. He fed it inch by inch to Draco but stopped him before he could start sucking him down. “No suction pet. Just warm my cock like a good little cocksleeve.”
“Harry I'm gonna cum I'll come please Harry...” Draco wailed, clearly at the end of his self control.
The last chapter of my first foray into writing smutty smut! Hope you enjoyed it. Comments and kudos keep me alive .
Harry took the purple dildo they had been using earlier and with a quick sticking charm had it placed at the edge of the coffee table behind Draco. He knew that Draco knew what was coming.
This time the pump happened faster and Harry made sure to praise Draco for it. “That’s it, you are doing so well love. Is the plug filling your hungry hole nicely?”
Harry had never seen a ballet class before. He’d always just assumed it was a bunch of girls in tutus prancing around. Well they
Draco thinks he’s destined to love the things that hurt. His father, his mother, his dance. His fascination and love for the ballet that stretched his limbs and tortured his bones was enough proof of his little theory.
Malfoy rubbed his eyes but seemed to calm. “Tempo, timing. Snape will have us preparing our arm strength soon. Dean can leap better than all of us, Seamus has been trying to lift Lavender behind everyone's back and I think he's almost there,
Draco took his words and left. He kicked the doorway in his own pettiness on his way out and sighed. He had a feeling this would be a long holiday.
Her cheeks were brushed with pink and her eyebrows faced down. Narcissa Malfoy was the epitome of class and wealth. Her voice was hoarse though and Draco could feel the lingering essence of doctors and medicine radiation off of her. Sometimes he wondered how someone so sick could look as she did.
Dancers did a lot of hard work by the looks of it. It sounded like a pain. The body horror stories and warnings ever other page. Even so he couldn’t help but gaze in wonder at their elegant poses. Each dancer looked so defined and regal. Each photo was like a painting with perfect lighting and purposeful positions and Harry could only imagine the awe it must have been like in real life. He can picture how the movements would play out. It was breathtaking.
Draco was nowhere in sight as she spoke and Harry felt his old bitterness towards the boy rise up. “Is he the reason?” He asked with a light frown.
Harry looks up. The sky is gray. Harry wonders if everyone hears their own music all the time. He wonders if dancers do.
Dumbledore waved his hand around as he spoke. “I’ve always wanted the children of today to partake in the arts. A fine course of study and a fine course of life. This is why I am beyond pleased to inform everyone that this year we will have more students who will be taught than any other year before. I can feel the world of ballet waiting with open arms for all of you...
Draco rolled his eyes. He was aware the only reason he’d been allowed to attend the royal ballet was because of his outward skill. He wasn’t amazing but he’d convinced his father he couldn't be a failure and such he was allowed. He’s sure if Greg and Vincent had even expressed an interest either of them would have been immediately sent off to some military school.
