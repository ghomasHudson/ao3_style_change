“The hell I will!“
„I can take you, if you like.“
„That's very good,“ Draco says.
„Shut it, Blaise.“
She smiles in relief. I take a guess. „You are probably not the only one who was worried about this, right?“
“You're stupid, Potter.“
„I do,“ he says, quietly and the palpable relief coming off Harry makes Draco heady. „But I'm not sure it's the same. You're a good person, Harry. Your ugly isn't the same as mine.“
I walk him to the sofa, where we collapse in a tangle of limbs. Draco tugs at my shirt and I help him to pull it off.
„Okay, let's go,“ Potter says, getting up.
Something like a smile ghosts around Malfoy's pale lips.
He swallows and I hate myself for not being able to resist his charm. He's so fucking pretty.
He rolls his eyes, now definitely annoyed.
Draco smiles. I'm sad the second it's fading again.
Harry is on his way back to the shop after lunch break. A business woman passes him, shouting into her phone. A man with a little girl on his hand saunters down the street, looking rather sleep-deprived. Harry watches the traffic light turn red and smiles. Draco slept over last night. He does every weekend now and often, he'll drop by during the week as well. When he has to wake up before Harry, he is always quiet as a mouse – then complains the whole day on how Harry got more sleep than he did. When Harry has to get up first, Draco always wakes too, hisses at him. Then kisses him with morning breath before snuggling back into the sheets, closing his eyes.
We end up forgetting the pasta altogether, when Harry's hands grow indecent, palming the bulge in my pants.
Harry's jaw drops as Draco says: „I want to marry you, arsehole.“
Hermione smiles at me over stacks of books on Magical Gardening.
Draco bites his lip, shivering, but he doesn't look away.
„Hello. Thank you for the invitation,“ Draco says stiffly and Ron rolls his eyes.
„I'm fine.“
He only nods.
„I mean, I knew she'd have one. In the end. But... Ron lost it. He screamed at her and he... threw a glass against the wall. Not at her, of course. But still. He threw a fucking glass.“
Draco looks up.
My whole body feels on fire, flames licking over my skin. The heat makes my head fuzzy, but without so many thoughts distracting me, my desire is pure and raw and primal.
I don't have to wait long tonight. Precisely the minute my shift starts, there is a knock on the door. I close my eyes. Only very, very few people knock.
I step back.
I pull my hand away. „Do you want to hurt me?“
I'm a lot to carry, despite my slim frame. I know I am.
In the doorframe to the living room, I freeze.
I swallow.
I carress his face. „I thought about it so much. Tried to find a way. But as I see it, there is none.“
„The Aurors will find out eventually,“ Draco says.
„Only in the very end. I... just thought trying makes it worse. I thought anything I do would just make her more upset with me. So I decided not to do anything.“
My hands stroke all over his body, feeling his warmth. Feeling him tremble.
„Draco.“ Harry is pleading now, but he doesn't care.
„Potter, why don't you call your friends?“ Pansy asks casually.
Warning: Past implied rape/dubious consent
Harry's hand has wandered, is now caressing his face, tracing his lips. He slips one finger into Draco's swollen mouth and Draco is so, so hard, he thinks if he can't come soon, he might die from the tension.
„You're mad at her for trying to cheer you up?“
I nod, not trusting myself to speak and help him push down his trouser. He pushes me to the bed and I shiver as I flop down on the mattress.
“Can you... do you like your job?“
My glass isn't empty yet. I don't want to be drunk.
„I don't think I can get hard right now.“
Ron looked kind of sad and Harry understood him all too well. But it didn't change his decision.
He's only different to
„Draco.“
„'Course he is.“
The day I finally stop lying to myself, I go home early. Sit at the table and wait for Draco.
I give her one of my reassuring smiles. „I completely understand your concerns, but they're unfunded. I might be young, but I'm one of the best in the field when it comes to lycanthropy and related illnesses. You can trust me.“
“Thanks, mate. Should heal well now.“
„You don't even know if you like having sex with men,“ I point out.
„Are you sure you don't need me tonight?“
I exhale.
But what he's still not okay with is that she destroyed all his plans for the future. Just like that. Without any reason Harry could comprehend. Things were going great, until, one day, they weren't going at all anymore.
My stomach turns.
I rub my hands and make sure my disguise is still in check. Today, I'm a pale brunet with hazel eyes. Those are not spelled. I'm using contacts, because spells somehow won't stick with my eyes.
Before Ron can break free of my grip and attack Malfoy, someone approaches the cell.
I won't lie – I've been avoiding Draco a bit.
He just wants one more minute under the trees. It's where he feels calmest.
I open my mouth. Close it again.
„Okay, I think. She's working a lot.“
Draco whirls around again, fury in his eyes. „You're kids aren't sick. And your parents won't reject you if you come out as gay.“
„No?“
“Is he?“ Harry growls.
Ron huffs and I take the mug and enter my bedroom more timidly than I ever have before.
„Are you sure?“ She frowns at me, sipping on her tea.
„Are you sure?“ His eyes are searching mine.
„Please,“ he says and I moan, just a little, before leaning in.
Hermione gets up. Sits next to him, balancing on the edge of his bath tub.
„I think I should really go check on Hermione,“ Ron says, voice heavy.
My heart starts pumping. I don't dare hope this is what I want it to be. With lightly shaking fingers, I take the letter and open it.
. Whatever the fuck that means.“
I think Malfoy is going for haughty and pissed, but he doesn't succeed. He sounds scared. Scared and maybe embarrassed.
Ncuti's face is hard. „Yes, because you two somehow didn't want to solve it anymore. But I do. And I have.“
? Why did I think he was different? You know, I thought he saw me. I thought he was there for me, to touch me.“
They are just bones. I can't really think of a word to describe them.
„You don't have to do this,“ Draco says, standing in the middle of my huge, dusty living room.
“Stating the obvious usually isn't a sign of great intelligence, Potter.“
He comes over and chops the nuts for Draco.
„That's good,“ she says.
Pansy nods, looking at Blaise and taking a deep breath. Draco puts a tentative hand on her back and Pansy leans into it, smoothing one hand over Draco's hair, then pressing her forehead against his shoulder for a moment.
„If you're not planning on staying for good, you should leave now,“ I say urgently.
But it's not. It's Harry, probably with something similar in mind.
„My godfather got through twelve years and he didn't become insane. I mean, not to say it didn't leave marks, but he was still himself,“ I say.
Draco is
„Yeah, I'm fine.“
Pansy rolls her eyes and drops her head into her hands.
Scorpius smiles at me and follows his mother into the rain.
„Really?“
Draco smiles at me.
„I'll make sure I will, Potter.“
Ncuti's brows knit together. „We have to be careful. Do you know what it looks like, us bringing Death Eater after Death Eater in? Best case scenario, people think we're grasping at straws. Worst case scenario, we're predjudiced. And I don't know about you guys, but I think there are enough predjudiced Aurors in this department already.“
But now Harry isn't a weapon anymore. He's just a person.
“Hermione, come on.“
Hundred Galleons. That's enough to give me a perspective. Maybe. It will at least buy me some time to think. If, maybe, there's a way out for me afterall.
The look in Draco's eyes makes Harry flinch back.
Of course, Draco is completely right.
To this day, Draco's not sure he's quite over that.
Knowing that skinning people alive really was a thing amongst Death Eaters doesn't make that statement any less horrid.
Harry sips on his pint. It's lukewarm and looks like piss.
„It has to be.“
Malfoy rolls his eyes. His posture is flawless as always, but today, it seems like it takes him some effort to keep it that way.
When Draco enters the pub, everyone stills for a moment.
It's as if we had all the time in the world and maybe we actually do.
„Come here,“ I say and my voice is wrecked.
Hannah frowns.
“No, um...“
Harry is surprised that Zabini just told them that. If he thinks about it, it's the most he's ever gotten to hear about the Slytherin's private life.
„I thought you'd be happy,“ Harry says, quietly.
Ron lets his hands sink. „I didn't even know you're into guys, mate.“
„Sorry.“
My breath catches. I just look.
„Can I ask you a question?“
The first time they have sex again, they're both nervous enough to puke.
Nott gets up, gathering his plate and cutlery.
„It's not that complicated, Harry,“ he says quietly.
I can hear Andromeda shifting her weight behind me. „I think there have been two or three occasions. He once stopped the tab from leaking.“
My blood is buzzing.
I run into Ginny at Bill's and Fleur's baby shower – or the Weasley's interpretation on the occasion. There is a lot of food and butterbeer and everyone congratulates the happy couple.
„Coming to see you, I guess. Say goodbye.“
„You're a fucking asshole, is what you are.“
“I don't think they do, Harry.“
The question is so ridiculous that I don't bother answering it, instead pulling his head down to my lips and his hand between my legs, where I want it.
„You will eat, Teddy.“
I'm blaming it all on the veela.
The siblings exchange a look.
Draco nods.
Harry is hiding his face in his hands, shoulders drawn up. His back to me.
(Pansy's and my new favourite gay club – partly because of the hot dancers, partly because of the excellent cocktails) could cause an anorysm, but I like them.
Harry considers it for a moment. „I think you should ask her. She might not want to get married right away, but I can't imagine she won't be happy about you proposing. I'm sure she knows she wants to marry you, and as long as that's clear, it doesn't really matter whether you're engaged for a few months or two or three years, does it?“
There has to be a way to find Malfoy.
I wait for him too adjust, turning his face toward me by his chin, shaking with want.
It only stops when Potter becomes visible right behind Andromeda. We stare at each other and a deep pink blooms on his cheeks. He looks away.
When everyone starts yawning and Ron is going on a rant about the Cannons, Draco lightly touches my knee under the table. A smile is spreading over my face.
Your eyes widen a little and then you tell me you've never been with another boy, either, you haven't been with girls, really – just one. Just one girl. That's it.
„I'll be back tomorrow in the morning,“ he says and with that, he leaves.
„Sure.“ He shrugs off his coat and then steps next to me. Together, we spell way too many fairy lights into the shop window, making it seem glamourous for at least a month.
„Yeah,“ Sam says, wiping her hands on a napkin. Harry waits. „Actually, no. Not quite. I just... I have a hard time accepting that Otis is going out with Terry.“
We're snogging each other senseless at least once a day and I make sure to keep my hands to myself, even though Draco doesn't always. I think he still doesn't understand why I won't shag him, but he doesn't complain.
Slowly, Draco nods and I drape an arm around him. He stiffens for a moment, then scoots closer and leans into me.
Draco nods and Ron pours himself a generous cup.
„But his cock is pretty great, according to Draco at least.“
„You – you two...“ I stare at her, then back at the shop.
„Nowhere. Back to your flat.“
I sneer at him. „So does everyone else, Potter. You're not special.“
Pansy stares at me accusingly as the doorbell rings. I give her an apologetic smile and walk to the door.
Potter looks at me.
Harry got that, really, he did, but it hurt him all the same.
„Draco. It's been, what? Five years?“
It's the first time in forever they're all at Felix's – even Pansy. She's wearing a short skirt and thigh-high tights and heels, looking eatable, even to Draco, who'd never think about her that way.
„You'll have to wait, Potter.“
Draco kisses him because he doesn't want to talk about sad things right now. And maybe also just because he really wants to kiss Harry. They stand there forever, wrapped around each other, lost in the kiss that none of them wants to break.
Our order is to gather information about the Knockturn Alley brothels and clubs, for once because of the increasing drug dealing that seems to happen around here and also to check on the treatment of the sex workers and house elves. There have been quite many cases of dead sex workers over the last years and we're finally starting a way overdue investigation on the conditions the Knockturn prostitutes are working under.
„Okay,“ he says. „I'll date you.“
Harry smiles, triumphant.
It's going to be a long few days.
You sense the urgency in my voice and lift my leg over your shoulder, lining yourself up. You look into my eyes when you push inside me and I can't breathe, can't look away. You're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
„Merlin,“ Harry says, catching his breath, then gently pulling out and sliding off of Draco. He turns to his side and Draco feels those green eyes on him.
Harry raises a brow at me. „I'm not illiterate, you know.“
The only thing that as always been stuck in the back of my mind is Draco Malfoy. I felt guilty and angry equally.
He didn't change much in the last two years – his hair is still blond, longer on the top and short at his neck. He's still rather skinny and pointy, but there is a calmness about him now that was missing before. His gray eyes seem more open, his whole posture not as stiff. And while there are still sharp edges to him, they're not that prominent you're afraid to cut yourself on them.
He was ready. Harry was ready for the green flash to hit him and to see his parents’ faces.
Terrified, Harry held Draco close to him. “How did you get out of that alive?”
“Oh, shit. You two were together for a while then.” Harry’s eyes were fixated on the table, as he was feeling incredibly awkward, so he missed the blush that began to rise on Malfoy’s cheeks.
“He’s got a lot going on right now and it’s actually really difficult, Parkinson.”
Draco shook the thought of their death away from him. If he lingered on it, he just may go insane. There was always the possibility that the letter had gotten intercepted or, less likely, lost. Of course. That had to be it.
Draco sat back against the pillows now that he was alone, terrified at what he had just done. Did he know
“Well,” Ron began. “What could they possibly be using him for?”
Ron sat down next to his best friend. “How did the mirror break?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Laying back down, he pulled the covers up around him and took a few deep breaths before dropping back into the dreaded world of dreams.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. “Really?”
“See? That’s exactly why I’m not teaching there.”
His best friend pinched the bridge of his nose. “Fine. Alright. What is it, mate?”
As he turned away, Ron was there for him to turn into and Ron wrapped his arms around his best friend while Harry sobbed. While he comforted Harry, Hermione approached Draco’s body.
Draco smiled. “I will. It was nice seeing you.” Without another word, Draco was out the door.
Draco thought for sure that he was going to be dead. He was going to be tortured, he was going to be killed. He knew that the Dark Lord didn’t spare—especially not now that he had most of his memories back. He dealt punishment without looking back: cruciatus, avada, done.
What was going on?
“I’m just saying that, looking back on it, many of Harry’s actions make more sense if you factor in him having feelings for Draco. And, if you think about him being bisexual it only fits into place a lot of other questions like why he used to stare at Oliver Wood and Cedric in that way that we would make fun of him for.”
“Oh,” Hermione said, realizing what he was thinking about. “Right. Ron, that has nothing to do with Blaise and Pansy. Just because—”
Sorry for the short hiatus but we’re back!!
? Did they not care?
OH do yall remember that post that's like "dumbledore needed a martyr" cause i FELT THAT writing this fic i literally looked for it for so long it started off talking abt like the slug club and what slughorn collects and who dumbledore collects and UH
Again, Harry’s hands came to Draco’s shoulders. “Hey. Don’t think like that. There’s no point.”
“What the fuck does it matter?!” Ron asked. “You-Know-Who still has the most powerful wand of all time and the only person who can take it away from him is
Draco laughed at that, his eyes crinkling alongside his smile. Harry’s heart could have melted and honestly? Fuck that feeling. “You’ve always been unobservant.”
“Wait, what do you mean you’re cover’s been blown. What happened?”
It was in the silence that followed that Harry took note of the fact that his hand was still lying atop Draco’s. He pulled it back all too fast, as if he had been burned. The action earned him a strange look from Draco, but he didn’t comment.
Had to do a quick update cause couldn't leave yall w that one hanging too long lmaooo (but I /love/ the way this chapter ends fjawoifjaoifj)
__________
It was revealed that he was partially faking his amnesia and making it seem worse than it really was—that part of his memories were examined to the full extent. And it was excruciating.
“But, Harry—”
“I’m sorry,” Ron said. “But what the fuck? Malfoy? Ferret? Really?”
“Mentioned what, Pans?” Blaise asked her.
trusted Snape. And now it turns out that I was right this entire time,
It was possible these things could have been triggered, but it may also have been that Draco got his memories back.
Who was this man? Something familiar prickled in the back of his mind, but he just couldn't place him. Couldn't even remember his name.
“Help me,” Draco pleaded. “Please. You have to help me.”
“Even you?” Harry asked.
“No,” Harry said and his voice was surprisingly steady. “We’re not going to touch him. No one is going to touch him. You have to at least give the Deathly Hallows their—their—their time to work.”
Reaching up, Draco touched his face. He looked partly like a ghost, his skin was so pale. Around his eyes were dark bags. He shuddered to think he had let himself get this way. But, he supposed that being a Death Eater would do that to a person. The constant stress of being found out, being under Voldemort’s gaze.
I was just fighting for my life. I swear that I—“
“But he—” Harry started. Remus laid a hand on his shoulder.
bro ima level w y'all: I live in the desert and have NO IDEA how seasons work. i don't know when it stops snowing, when it starts snowing. idk man. roll w it.
“Rumors.” Draco smiled and it was warm. To Harry’s horror, it was like his heart stuttered. Would it have been that way before he had understood all of this? Would he just not have noticed it? What was all of this?
Expelliarmus!
“Why would we be friends with you?"
“I love defense except not this year and I hate potions. Not as much this year, but I do still hate it. Why? Hmm. Well, Snape is the literal
Tears welled up in his eyes. No, he couldn’t—how could he have—no. Biting his lip, He screwed his eyes shut. He couldn’t do it. Just—no.
At least he would see his parents again. And Sirius. They were waiting for him—he knew it.
“It actually is, thank you. You’re right. I should be going.” Draco made a move to stand and Harry did so at the same time, ending with them standing a mere few inches apart. Harry’s mouth went dry in that split second when Draco hesitated. But then, he took a step back, offering Harry a small smile before starting to walk away.
“Harry,” Hermione spoke up now. “I agree with you.”
“Excuse—” “What are you—” “You fucking—” Everyone began talking at once.
He and Hermione sat there, both glancing over at Ron every now and then, anxious for him to say something. Between glances, they would share looks, Harry sending worried faces, Hermione returning with sympathetic ones. Where was this going? Ron had to be okay with it, right? They were best friends, after all.
what else does Hermione have in this whole plan of hers? great question y'all cause i am NOT as smart as her smh
Reaching into his pocket, Harry withdrew the resurrection stone and placed it in Draco’s upturned, empty palm.
Bill and Snape exchanged a look before Bill put the Deathly Hallows back so they were making contact with Draco, figuring it couldn’t hurt.
He supposed it was a downside that now he wouldn’t be able to get any answers. They would all continue on having no idea how bad the damage to his brain was and if he would continue getting memories back, or only certain memories, or a thousand other things Ms. Topfeld could have told him. But, regardless of all of that, he was glad that he hadn’t allowed her in his mind.
Harry turned to the girl, still yelling. “What’s his issue?”
“No, really, it’s not, I promise.” Harry set his firebolt down and walked over to Draco. “Here, let me try it.”
“Good because I’m gonna be in the hospital wing all night and I need someone to laugh at my jokes.” Draco gave a little smile at that.
“Wouldn’t you like to know, Potter?”
“The memory is fairly private,” was all he said.
He untied it, thanking her and opened the note up.
Harry blinked. Had he heard Ron right? Did this mean he approved? He had, after all, listed a lot of things. A lot of things Harry had never thought about. It was starting to launch him into panic for an entirely different reason when he snapped himself out of it, realizing Ron was waiting for him to respond.
sorry for the long time no update but trying to graduate in three years is the WORST don't do it kids ride your scholarship money as far as it'll take you
“Ron, you made him cry! He doesn't remember anything since he was eleven. Can't you see how difficult that would be? I don't care how he treated us because that's not what he needs right now."
He had one mission here and one mission only: to go to the Room of Hidden Things and finish the repairs on the vanishing cabinet. Draco would have assumed that now that Dumbledore was dead, the Dark Lord wouldn’t have cared about trying to get into Hogwarts—he had mistakenly thought that the only reason the Dark Lord wanted the school was for the access to the Headmaster but there were apparently many other things in the school that he wanted. Hogwarts was full of secrets, after all, wasn’t it?
(See the end of the chapter for
Rumor was that after eighth year he had run off to France and stayed there for a damn while. Permanently was the info that Harry heard. What was he possibly doing back?
He took Potter’s hand and swung onto the broom behind him and Harry took off.
Because Harry did. He had talked it out with Snape—there was only one horcrux left. Harry knew the last horcrux had to be destroyed to have any hope of the Dark Lord not rising again. Even if that meant that the last horcrux would have to be destroyed without Harry able to get his hands on the Elder wand. Because he just didn’t see any way that it was possible.
“Potter, the whole school knew. Everyone that wasn’t an idiot, that is. And just so you know, literally every other fifth year would have joined and not snitched. We all hated Umbridge and wanted to pass our OWLs. What a bitch that woman.”
“…good, good, deep breath in—you’re safe, you’re fine—and then nice and slow deep breath out—the war is over, You Know Who is dead, you are safe—deep breath in…”
“Ronald, would you stop stomping?” Hermione said. “We’re looking for an invisible body, you could do a little better to try and not step on him.”
What? Me? Back? Wild!
like the big news but honestly I feel like the other thing I’m going to say is quite honestly a lot more revolutionary so just hold on, yeah?”
But then he jerked back, taking a step away from Ron.
Harry’s eyes went wide and he was clearly embarrassed. “No way! Holy shit, I am so sorry,” he laughed.
Anyway, things were going fine. He didn’t have internal bleeding in his brain, according to the muggle doctors, he no longer had the mirror, and Dumbledore was dead.
Eventually, Draco was able to breathe and he looked up at Harry, knowing his face was red and wrecked with tears.
Ron turned and gave him a look that said ‘what the hell, man?’ and Hermione yelped.
With an open smile, Draco greeted him. “Hello,” he said. “Fancy seeing you here.” They fell into step next to each other, continuing the way Harry had been going. “So, Minerva tells me that you will apparently be starting in the fall as the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. Why didn’t you tell me when we last spoke? You had mentioned it, but you kind of implied that she asked you and you said no.”
“Okay, fine,” Ron said. “What about Draco? If everyone is moving to their endgame, then what are the Death Eaters planning to do with him? He could be drawn into this somehow and—”
Draco was still reeling. What did she mean he had been oblivated? When? By whom? He was at Hogwarts? This didn't make any sense. He was going to have to tell Father and—
Gasping, Draco’s eyes widened and it was like a searing pain erupted in his mind. Harry stepped back from him abruptly, hands held out like he had somehow caused it.
i literally am cringing so hard that i did the tEXt LiKE tHiS but whatever yk live your life and please don't hate me for it lmfao
Suspicious, Draco narrowed his eyes. “What is this, Potter?”
wasn't the same man, either. They had both changed. It was clear in the way Harry's shoulders slumped when he talked about his work with the aurors, so opposite of how he used to be hell-bent on joining them. Not to mention that he wasn't as uptight as usual. Then again, Draco would probably be the only person to have ever described Harry Potter as uptight. It was just that, back during the war, the stress played clearly across his features. His shoulders were always so tight, brows knit as he would stare off into space, jumpy and easily upset.
“The Deathly Hallows weren’t what brought me back. Dumbledore was there and he—he said all this about what really makes you the master of death and all of this and—” Abruptly, Harry pulled back. “If the Deathly Hallows aren’t what really make you the master of death then that means…” He stopped and all the fight left him. Slowly, Harry laid back down on the bed.
me, a slytherin, crying in the corner: they're not evil!! they just want to do things!! ambition! does! not! mean! evil!!!!! let them know they are not bad, draco!!!
Sitting up straight, he decided he would try and send a letter to his mother. The one from the school would most likely have been addressed to his father: everyone knew that if anything happened to a Malfoy, Lucius was going to come for them, so the letter had likely explained the situation and pleaded for forgiveness. But his mother would likely be the one to respond.
Trusting her judgement, he took it and swallowed it, his headache immediately easing.
Sitting up, he ran his hands down his face, sighing. Would this relationship with Potter even work out? What was he getting himself into?
“Draco, listen to my voice,” Harry said. “It’s okay. Things are going to be fine. I am going to do what I can to help you and—“
Hand clutched white-knuckled on the Elder Wand, Draco collapsed to his knees, weak from the effort he had to spend in order to disarm such a powerful wizard of such a powerful wand.
“Okay, umm,” Draco thought about another question. “Favorite and least favorite class and why.”
fjajffj you didnt really think i was gonna keep draco DEAD did you klafjaklsfjlaksjf
Turning away from Draco was one of the hardest things that Harry had ever done. Remus took him by the shoulders and guided him out of the room, closing the door behind him. Then they began to walk down the hallway, Harry in a daze.
“Seriously?” Again, Draco laughed. “Teenagers are wild.” He took a sip of his drink and almost choked again. “Fuck, I’m going to be teaching those crazy fuckers.”
“Harry,” Dumbledore began and Harry felt the calm leave him. There was one more thing that he had to do.
“Kind of why I’m asking.”
“I—” Narcissa began before she paused, finding it hard to speak past her grief. “I think I would like to wait here with him. I know I have to, but I’m not sure I’m ready to leave him yet—” She cut off, her eyes jumping down to her hand.
SNAPE and HARRY and RON working together?? talk about ooc
It would also explain why he knew something was strange about her eyes; he knew to avoid them. A ligiliemens requires eye contact and something in Draco had picked up on that.
Draco swore to Merlin if he had to sit in McGonagall's office and tell her that he was "seeing" Harry Potter, he would tie a few rocks around his ankles, charm them on, and then jump into the lake. Like fuck was he going to do that. Policy be damned. That was absurd. No. Absolutely not. It would be
“Well, fuck, are you two dating now or something?” Ron asked. Harry noted that Hermione was still looking off into the distance, blinking occasionally. He could practically see her working all of this out in her head.
He took a deep breath. “I’m not spying on you, Potter, I was just studying.”
There was a long—
This morning, Ginny had come and collected the last of her things from his flat, officially signifying the end of their relationship (for the second time). He had also spilled tea all over himself. There was also a rip in one of his sets of auror robes that he didn’t have time to fix. Or know how to fix. He would have to ask Molly.
I remember watching your every move. I've been so diligent, I still know your timetable by heart. It probably makes me a creep, the way I've always been looking at you, simply not able to tear my eyes away.
He's not here.
I nod down at the tent in my jeans and Draco blushes as his gaze wanders lower – but he doesn't look away.
I just shake my head.
Helplessly, I catch Harry's gaze. His green eyes are shining, hopeful.
There are no official connections, but with not too much digging, we manage to confirm Draco's words. Flint did work with Runcorn and he was always present at the parties at the Manor.
„They only had former Death Eaters and such and I thought maybe that would make it – not
I sit back down. „You know you could get sacked for this.“
Ron pushes himself off the wall and heads back to his chair.
„What?“ I ask him, knowing I sound like a git. But I can't help it.
„It's okay,“ he rasps with his high voice. „Just feeling sick.“
I give him a vague smile and head out of the office.
There are two girls sitting only a few metres from me, curled around each other. Long, black shiny hair a stark contrast to blond curls. They're holding each other and I wonder if they're here for someone else or if one of them is sick. Or maybe was.
He shakes his head and lifts the mug. I want to reach out and brush back the loose strand of hair falling over his eyes, but I doubt my touch would be welcome, so I content myself with muttering some basic soothing charms under my breath. They won't really heal any wounds, but they should make him feel more comfortable.
„It's policy,“ Hermione says, looking at Draco.
“I thought about you a lot,“ she says. “What you were doing. I know they didn't put you in Azkaban, but your father were. I heard rumors Narcissa fell ill. But for a long time, I didn't hear anything about you.“
I nod, then pull him against me for another kiss. Not so sweet this time. My mouth is open and I press against him, making him feel just
A dark smirk spreads over Draco's face.
„I wasn't ignoring you for years. I only ignored one letter.“
My heart is racing in my chest, my bones like glass. Easily breakable.
For the first time in a long time, maybe ever, there is real fear in Harry's eyes as he looks at me.
He knows now what a freak I am. Not even Ginny knew that much, even though she knew a little.
My best friend just snorts and listlessly flips through a stack of papers. „Get your own bloody coffee.“
. Surely, you'd agree with me.“
„Sorry, I -“ He trails off as he pushes inside me. My mouth falls open on a gasp. It feels amazing, it feels...
His breath quickens.
“Well, Potter. Since we've gotten the past out of the way now, would you like to tell me how it comes that the Chosen One is taking Dreamscales?“
„People that are being coerced don't always realize it happens, Potter.“
„What?“
The unspoken hangs between us.
Ron regards me with his blue eyes, fine lines around his downturned mouth.
Whenever I pause to think about it, I wonder if I've finally gone completely insane. I'm hanging out with Malfoy of all people – and I don't hate it. I don't know why, but I enjoy every minute of our little sign-lessons.
„I'm seriously doubting your mental state right now, but... yes.“
I love her. I know I do. I always have.
Draco stiffens. I'm quicker to answer.
„Other than that...“ Other than that, I've spent the last two months going out a lot, messing up some bloke's sheets almost every weekend. But I'm not sure Harry wants to hear about what a little slut I've become. „I've been going out quite a bit with Pansy,“ I soften the blow.
„Stop calling me that.“ It annoys me like not much else.
He follows me to the door, catching my hand. „Draco.“ His eyes are so goddamn devastating. „I really want to try this. I meant what I said. I like you. A lot.“
„Malfoy, watch it. She's a Veela.“
Pansy tumbles back onto the bed, basically falling into Hermione's lap. The Gryffindor doesn't seem to mind too much.
She'll be running for Minister for Magic in less than five years, I'm almost sure of that.
And he does.
I roll my eyes. „Then you're an idiot.“
„I'd really like to eat dinner with you. Honestly. It's just -“
With a pang, I close the book. We've been over this a couple times already and by now, even just the word Christmas makes me aggressive.
„You do know, if you're withholding information that might lead us to the head of this underground trafficking, you could face worse than just a fine,“ Harry says after fifteen fruitless minutes of interrogation. He can feel his blood heating and knows he has to be careful.
His gaze makes me nervous. I glance away.
I don’t say anything and wait until I hear the front door shut.
I brush his fringe back and bear the ripping feeling in my heart. There he goes again, reducing me to an aching mess of bone and marrow and too tender tissues.
„If you have a problem with that, I won't,“ I add.
All of that turns out to be in vain.
I swallow. „Me neither.“
He straightens his spine and looks at me.
Another silence.
Deafening silence is ringing in my ears. My mouth tastes like blood. I must have bitten my tongue.
More steps.
„I want the truth, Draco.“ The name zips through me like an electric shock. My whole body aches. Yearns.
Potter still doesn't seem convinced and Draco wonders why he even cares. But that's probably just a Harry-Potter thing. He can't help but want to save people. He never could.
„How are you doing, Harry? Has it been very strange for you to see Ron and Hermione move in together?“ Luna's voice is as airy as ever.
„This house is huge. We won't even have to see each other.“
The Gryffindor does me the favour not to ask stupid questions like
But she cares about Draco, too. She's trying her best to make him happy, even though she probably knows she can't. Not really.
„Fuck.“
Astoria shakes her head. „No. It would be too exhausting for him. We have a private teacher that comes three times a week to help Scorpius with his studies.“
I still do. But at the same time, I'm not sure for how much longer I can live like this.
“Draco? Did he hurt you?“
„You do realize why though, right? No one can be that thick. Not even you,“ is what I end up saying.
„Do you miss her?“ Draco asks me at breakfast before my lessons of the day start.
I feel like I'll die if I don't. A terrifying feeling, but I don't care right now.
The clap-back I and the boy experience shock us both.
„And you think I do?“
Al can sometimes be a tight ball of energy, but he's not like James. One of the things I love most about my youngest is his consideration. I think he knew way before I talked to him about it that Scorpius had to be treated with the utmost care.
Draco's not available and he probably wouldn't be a good match anyway, so Harry shouldn't want to spend his nights with the Slytherin.
I spend the day cleaning the house and buying flowers and Ginny's favorite chocolates, before flooing over to Ron and Hermoine's.
„Would I have asked if I wasn't?“
„I don't want you swooping in and... arresting him.“
Harry pauses at that.
My breathing is ragged the second they throw me into the cell, even though it's a pretty cell. There is the plank bed again and a bottle of water.
„Dracodracodracodraco.“ He doesn't know what he's saying. He lost control.
Part of me doesn't want to tell him. But I'm not an asshole and certainly not a liar. „Pretty good. I'm spending more time with old friends again and I've been dating someone for a couple months.“
„I mean, we did talk about it. A little. He said... he doesn't know if he can want.“
„As for your friends – yes, I did care. I really... I'm sorry, deeply sorry, about putting them in danger while I was going after Dumbledore. I was desperate.“ He looks to the side, hair covering part of his eyes. „Voldemort was threatening to kill my mother. And me. I would have done anything to please him.“
The arm around me tightens. „That's bullshit, Harry. You never bug me. Or Hermione. We love you, man.“
He reaches through the bars and pushes the chocolate as far into my direction as he can.
“Not really, no.“
Pansy enters the kitchen. She's wearing new clothes.
I only spend about an hour at her bed. Saturdays are always busy and other visitors are casting me nasty glances.
„You gotta know her. She was with you at Craig's.“
I swallow thickly.
I swallow. Draco
She blinks at me. „He's apologized to me. Almost right after the trials. I've met him at the shop quite a lot.“
A smile spreads over my face and I lean down to kiss him.
„Mr. Yaxley says it's Malfoy he's made a deal with. Not Connor,“ the older Auror says.
A filthy grin bares Flint's teeth. „I really wouldn't call it that.“
My heart is pounding. I feel sick.
I don’t know why he cares. The flat we had sex in was the one I owned when no one believed that a Malfoy could be successful. There were times I used olive oil for lube because I was broke and Harry doesn’t like the conjured stuff.
Harry should have expected it, but really, he didn't. It hits him like a punch to the gut.
The Gryffindor looks down. The warm water has cooled somehow.
„I'm really tired, Potter. You should go.“
Suddenly a little embarrassed, I finish my drink and get up.
I'm worried.
„Well, I assume –
I look at Potter. He looks tired. His features are soft in the yellow light of the room.
A few argue against it.
„Let's take it back to the Ministry,“ Hermoine says. „Run some checks to see if there are any spells or curses on it.“
I flush bright red. Apparently, I'm more shaken than I thought I was.
„Yeah. I'm really sorry, mate.“
Most of the time, I manage.
Potter seems to sense that his eyes on me make me beyond uncomfortable, because he doesn't look at me when I push the berry into my mouth. It makes a little pop as my teeth crush the skin and it tastes... a little like kiwi and blueberries. A little bit like cherries.
Like someone in love.
„Always blame it on the alcohol,“ he grumbles, but is already feeling is anger fade. Pansy is right. He really can never be mad at her.
„I'll take a piss,“ I say and get up. The room is on the verge of spinning.
You look at me, horror on your face.
„Sorry,“ Potter says. He makes this face that means he feels horrible for talking too much about himself. He usually doesn't. I think he thinks talking about himself would make him a bad person and the Saviour can't be a bad person, can he?
„You can call me Draco,“ I say to Teddy. „I'll run a few general tests, alright? It won't take long and it won't hurt,“ I assure him.
„You've practiced,“ he signs as he closes his trousers.
But he must apparently not be very good at it, because he seems lost once again.
“Sounds good.“
And I won't think about that. Jesus.
I start coming to the shop again.
I blink, open my mouth. Close it again. My mind is blank I can only stare at him.
Potter stops rummaging through the pantry.
„I'm sorry,“ he says, barely audible. „It won't happen again. I'm so sorry.“
Well, most of them. There is one that makes working with him not really easy, but that's part of the job.
It's weird that no one seems to have seen or heard from him since he got free, but – well. My friends aren't really Malfoy's. Why would they know anything about his whereabouts?
He felt like it was his duty to help fixing it.
He hates how lately, everything he says to Derek feels like taken out of the script for a bad soap.
„Merlin, Potter. You keep exceeding my worst expectations.“
„Is it now?“
„Come to mine,“ Harry says, impulsively. „Drink something. Calm down a little.“
I know I have no right to. Potter, on the other hand, has every right to be mad at me. To hate me, even.
„You're sure about it?“
Draco smiles, even though it doesn't feel like it for him. He didn't really contribute anything in solving this case and... he doesn't want to leave the team. He's never worked with people that respected him like this lot does. And he's never quite respected any of his coworkers like this either.
„Okay, fine! It's true. Runcorn shagged Laila. I hated him for that. But I didn't kill him.“
I blink, tilting my head. „I mean, there is never a guarantee for anything, is there?“
We're both quiet for a moment.
„No, they're just using Potter to get to you,“ Blaise says, eyebrows drawn.
His hands slip from my shoulder and around my waist. As he pulls me closer, our bodies flush, I moan.
My brain is already blurring their faces. It's easier that way.
I look at my fingers, then back at her.
Which I countered with slicing his chest open. His blood on the tiles, mixing with the water.
„I'm not here for business.“
Draco nods, apparently not knowing what else to say.
But there is no wasting time with Hermione Granger. When Ron comes back as well, I'm fighting a losing battle.
Harry really can't, even though he's seen it coming for years now. But in his head, they're all still so young. Ron grins, almost a little maniacly.
„Yeah?“
Though it is obvious that there is some unfinished business between Weasley and Granger, they make the best of it and are way more friendly than I would have expected. Harry was a bundle of nerves the last three days, just because of this.
I kiss her cheek, then make my way down the stairs and out of the oppressive silence that has fallen over the
Lydia regards me with one of those glances that make me hyper uneasy.
Zabini shoots him a look that seems way too sharp for the situation, Harry thinks.
Weasley doesn't look at me, but I can see him swallowing.
Draco and I meet at a café and just like when I saw him at the reading, I can't help but notice how attractive he is.
I keep lying there for some minutes, indecisive. Maybe it's the good old Gryffindor courage that gets me to move. Gets me to sit up and slide out of bed, cross the room and then the hallway. I knock on Draco's door.
„Do you think Hooch is our man?“ Potter asks, looking at Draco with a thoughtful expression.
I shrug, not knowing what to answer.
„I'm not tired,“ Teddy murmurs, resting his head on my shoulder. His eyelids are fluttering.
Without even thinking about it, I reach out and touch his face. I stroke my finger over his cheekbones, his nose. My thumb is catching on his bottom lip. Smoothing over it.
He's definitely wide awake the moment I say his name.
“Please, Potter.“
„Did you coerce him?“
I can't imagine Malfoy would've come back here. Not if he had any place else, any place at all, to go to.
„Well, I think it's time for bed now,“ Astoria says and gets up.
“Brilliant.“
Zabini narrows his eyes at Harry.
„A little,“ I concede and then he's really smiling. „But I think I've always been.“
I'm the stupid one.
Ginny Weasley has always been an intimidating girl and the older she gets, the more does that impression grow. Her formerly long, fiery hair, is now cropped short, putting her blazing eyes on display and giving her a hard edge.
Both Sam and Harry look up from the files they'd been looking at for almost an hour now, watching Terry standing over them, his blue eyes dark. Blaise is leaning in to hear the Ravenclaw out as well.
I don't think I've provided those, so I like to believe my writing skills did the trick in the end.
„I feel like shit,“ he announces.
The Gryffindor puts his cup down. „Yeah, no shit.“
No, I'm not. I need to get out of here. Now.
I hesitate.
“That's really none of your business.“
Draco laughs. „You're jealous.“
Draco tries to swallow down the lump in his throat, but it doesn't work.
I'm not saying any of that.
„If you can wait twenty more minutes until my shift is over.“
„Shall we, then?“ He extends his arm for me and I take it, a buzz of excitement pulsing through me.
„I think I'll pass.“
Draco sodding Malfoy is going to be the death of him and Harry doesn't care one bit.
I rub my face.
„Hermione, you – are you?“
„Not really. But Gabriel doesn't like a lot of people. And Albert didn't always see eye to eye with him when it came to work.“
„Ron told me about the incident. No one hurt you, right?“
„Happy birthday, sweetheart.“
I'm not sure what to make of Weasley's expression right now. He picks up his own chocolate bar from the floor and peels the wrapper off.
Ron leans back again. „Merlin help me.“
„How was work?“ she then asks and I realize that I don't know what Draco does for a living.
„I should've told you sooner, I'm really sorry! I think... if you'd get to know him a bit, you'll see what I see.“
He laughs a little and I clench my arse around him. His laugh turns into a groan.
It's half the truth.
“I...“
For the first time today, I'm almost relaxed.
“But they'd still check, wouldn't they?“ I ask.
I slip into the room. There are several beds in the magically brightened room, but I only see the first one.
Ron finds me in the corridor where Draco's room is. He's looking tired, his shirt partly unbuttoned, sleeves rolled up.
I grin now. Harry post orgasm is apparently a Harry with Gregory's IQ.
now. I don't know why I've never realized it before.
I look up and shake my head. But Harry isn't finished yet. „Do you remember that day in the rain? On that bench?“
„If that's what you want, I'll be right with you. Or here waiting for you, whatever you need.“
„Kiss me, idiot.“
Zabini raises his brows, not really offended.
You take my silence as a yes and turn on several tabs.
“Why did you do that? You planning to blackmail me?“
I want to ask him who taught him how to cook. Maybe Molly Weasley. I know she's been something like a surogate mother to him.
Serpent eyes me, disapproval written over his features. It's not his real name, obviously. But it's what he likes to call himself and I'm not in the position to question it.
„And I was trying to pull this witch, but... I couldn't stop thinking about somebody else.“
“We need to get him to a healer.“
He shakes his head, remaining silent.
„I'm a natural with dragons,“ I say and grin at him.
„Me too.“
„Do you want to come in?“ I ask when we've reached my flat and he nods, still a bit red, but definitely excited. „Don't expect too much,“ I warn him before leading him into the run-down flat.
„I like this one,“ she says.
„I'll go. You take your time with Scorpius. I'll try telling them to go home.“
„My make up is going to be destroyed.“
„Hey, Draco.“
Curiosity is gnawing at me.
„It's gonna be okay.“
„I need to ask something about Teddy,“ he says the moment he walks in and I think he wants to make clear that this visit is strictly professional.
“If you fuck with Harry, you'll regret it,“ she says.
„Why does it have to be a secret?“ Ron asks, brows drawn. „I won't judge.“
I spin around. Malfoy is leaning against the wall of the shop, arms crossed over his chest, one ankle over the other.
„Draco Lucius Malfoy.“
„Do you want it?“ I ask, just because I want him to say
I grin sheepishly. „No, I really do think it sounds nice. I've never been to France. But I... feel bad that you can't travel that easily.“
On the first evening, he tries to seduce me, apparently already having forgotten about his offer, but I haven't. If I will only get one condition, then I'm sure as fuck going to be strict about it.
I conjure some lube to make sure nothing will hurt in the least and start stroking up and down. It takes a while until his thighs start quivering, until he starts panting and I can feel him getting closer.
I thought about you, what you said, the whole day.
„Weasley?“ he asks.
I smile and ache, not sure if I'm happy or destroyed – probably both – and get out two plates, dumping a slice of toast on each.
But Harry knew that was only half the truth. He suspected that she couldn't look at him anymore without seeing Voldemort, without seeing her brother dead and her family broken.
„I just thought you should know,“ she says, voice trembling.
Harry starts blushing and Draco knows it's wrong and fucked-up, but he wants Harry even more now. He wants him with an intensity that shocks him.
I want to touch Malfoy. It's probably just my fucked-up brain and even more fucked-up body, but the urge to reach out and lick the spot between his jaw and his ear is so intense that it's painful.
“Of course I do. I mean, who else would make me coffee and buy croissants while I’m still asleep?”
„They threatened to hurt Parkinson,“ I say. „Draco would do anything for her.“
A lot of things he probably won't answer unless he's really drunk. Since he isn't yet, I decide to go easy on him at first. „What do you do for work?“
Hermione sighs. „Harry, what are you asking me?“
Draco steps closer, between Harry's knees. He rests his hands on them. His fingers circle the bones.
„Totally sick, but it sounds like it could be true,“ Blaise says, exchanging a look with Draco.
He's hard. He's finally fucking hard for me.
I stare at her. „What?“
He walks out of the room and I could kick myself in the arse.
„This is confidential information,“ the Auror tries to explain to me. „He isn't yet allowed to have visitors. Not before the trial.“
I think Luna is more upset than Ginny when I walk in on them, but I don't have any patience for her right now. She betrayed me, just like Ginny did, so I have no qualms kicking her out.
Harry studies my face. „Why are you saying that? Did she talk to you?“
„I do love you, Harry.“
The Gryffindor glares at me, but it lacks conviction. Something akin to worry is rushing through me. Potter doesn't look good at all.
When Pansy moves out, I don't see it coming.
„Yeah. I know you're reading one of my books.“
All of his friends are here.
He tilts his chin up and we kiss, sweet and deeply.
I wonder if Draco can see the pain he's causing me. Maybe he does, because he quickly looks away again. Ron puts a hand on my shoulder and squeezes.
„Yeah. I usually prefer guys, but... fuck, women are so beautiful.“
„See who has risen from the dead.“
„And you can't protect him from a broken heart, Sam,“ Harry says, not without empathy. „We all have to go through that at some point.“
He takes a swig from his bottle.
Harry snorts. Then he makes a noise that is so pained, I can't help myself. I step forward, into his space.
„Yes.“
„You don't have to if you don't want to. I can burn it and scatter the ashes for you.“ Pale fingers are pushing my fringe back, then sliding down my neck, massaging lightly.
I take my time, making him squirm and sigh and arch his back, spreading his legs wider, before I move up and carefully remove my fingers from his body.
Finally, I look up. It's not easy to meet his eyes, but I do it.
He’s still so beautiful. His breath reeks of Hennessey though and his eyes are haunted.
He smiles at me and it has this dark edge, that I've last seen when he was sleeping in my bed, pale from blood loss.
I make my best impression of an innocent, excited grin and push past him, heading up the stairs.
Harry blushes, but nods eagerly anyway.
The look sent my way seems too exhausted to really sting.
Archer's dark brows meet over the bridge of his nose. He's already well over fifty, but his eyes are still piercing and one look of him is usually enough to silence the room.
Maybe it's good for Draco to hear that. What it can feel like.
I cut a piece of lime, ignoring the looks one of the guys at the bar keeps throwing me. „Depends on what you define as dating. I did go out. But not really to the movies.“
„Oh, yeah? Like what?“
I rise as gracefully as I'm able to and Harry is staring at me, mouth open. He takes me by my shirt and before I can wipe my mouth or say something mocking, he pulls me in and kisses me and kisses me, hanging on to me. The kisses are different now – little kitten kisses all over my mouth. His tongue flicks out and retreats, doesn't slip into my mouth.
And then he turns around and leaves.
Draco pulls his hand away.
Harry staggers back as if I hit him. “Draco…”
His testimony doesn't take long, but it leaves an impression. This wizard, who clearly doesn't know anything about me, takes a very clear stand, while remaining completely calm and polite.
„So... where are you standing? I mean, are you officially broken up or... like, taking a break? Or still together?“
I kiss his jaw and open his trousers.
„How?“
There is another pause, even longer this time.
Harry looks to the side. His head is spinning.
„Nothing. I just -“
“You fucking saved me, Malfoy.“
Thinking about kissing him evokes so many contradictory emotions in me that it feels like being torn in halfs.
“I won't do it, George. If you want to kill yourself, you have to ask someone else to help you. Not me, okay?“
„If you want me to.“
“This is the men's room, Gin,“ Harry says.
And with that, he walks into the sunlight.
With a shake of his head, Harry nudges Draco's shoulder. „Answer your phone, stupid.“
Ultimately, it didn't matter.
„I really can't. If I could, we'd be having this discussion at a pub or something.“
Harry winces.
„You mean creatures?“
An unfamiliar need has taken over him, a need that had more than ten years to build up. There is a fire in his belly that he's never felt before, not quite like this, and as long as the opportunity is on offer, he'll sure as hell take it.
„Your mother, you mean?“
Malfoy looks at me surprised. The eyes of the owner are the size of saucers.
My eyes snap up. „He misses me?“
A smile ghosts around Malfoy's pale lips. It's a new expression. One I didn't know before. „Of course it does. Someone has to make sure to deflate your big ego.“
„Tea?“ Hermione calls.
„Is that fun?“ Harry doesn't sound patronizing or even mean.
He puts a hand on my cheek.
I smile widely and kiss him.
I think I almost have her – she's almost sighing. Almost.
„Would you mind sitting with me for a bit?“ Granger asks.
“I mean, like – could we leave this club? During the time I – I paid for.“
„Really? Wow.“
„Draco, what the hell is going on?“
Draco knows. He knows Harry's heart better than his own.
For the first time since they've arrived, a pang of annoyance shoots through me.
The whole day, I'm giddy and excited. And broke (bartenders aren't really meant to be buying silken sheets, at least not those working at the
Either the Ministry has reopened the Malfoy vault or Draco is making money with his new job.
„Connor wants him back,“ he says and Derek is glaring at Harry.
I crouch down next to him. „Salazar, Potter.“
My lips stretch into a smile. „Vagina? Didn't know you could be so prude.“
„What if he hasn't changed? What if he's just manipulating me?“
I don't tell Ron about what happened between Draco and I. It's not easy, since I usually tell Ron everything.
„I'm sorry,“ Harry says. „I didn't mean to... scare you.“
Probably mostly to distract from himself, he starts asking me questions. Only very reluctantly, I tell him about my writing. It's not like I could deny the piles of parchment right in front of his nose.
I shrug, feining indifference. Looking at him and wondering if he'll hex me when he wakes up the next time, back to his senses.
„Hm-hm. You're drunk.“ I don't know what else to say.
„It wouldn't. Or, it would only make it worse. Sam doesn't even like girls.“
The moment the words leave my mouth, I want to haul them back in. But I can't.
„Yeah, it's snowing,“ I point out.
friends. But they are here, asking stupid questions, because it's not really my party, either.
I've always felt a bit like a freak for how much I crave physical contact. I don't anymore.
Who would have thought I'd ever be scared of Ronald Weasley?
I turn around and arctic eyes follow me.
„Draco,“ I whisper. „Let me go.“
„That's Jasmine. Aka Otis, Sam's brother,“ Harry says as a new girl steps on stage, wearing shoes that must sport about fifteen-inch heels and a short dress that is showing off endless legs.
„I don't know how to flirt. Being deaf,“ I hastily add.
“What do you want?“ I repeat, but it sounds insecure, unsure.
. It's strange how much Harry likes the name. He has the weird urge to say it all the time, feel it rolling off his tongue.
So I end up on his doorstep, soaking wet because I was too riled up for an umbrella charm.
, the sign says. I have a feeling what it might be, but I can't be sure. George knocks on the door and after a few minutes, a tall, thin man appears. He's slouching badly and his nondescript hair seems in need of a wash. I can't hear what George is saying, so I step closer.
The ghost of a smile appears on Draco's lips.
Rather suddenly, Weasley steps out of the embrace and faces me. I swallow and glance up into his earnest, freckled face, still a little red and beaming with happiness.
„Thank you, Harry. Truly.“
I hum. I think I want to say that my arse is not that scrawny, thank you very much, but somewhere on the way from my brain to my mouth, the words get lost.
I nod again.
„Yes, dad.“
We didn't talk much about the report after we came home yesterday. I was exhausted and Harry sensed that I wasn't in the mood for questions and deep talk. Instead, we napped on the sofa, ate dinner with Weasley who showered me with
„Yes. It's... not a nice place.“
“I'm not done here,“ the john pants, but Serpent won't have it.
„No,“ I say, tugging him to me hard. „I can't do that now.“
„Keep going,“ I murmur and he does and it hurts and doesn't even really feel good in any way, but I want more. I just want more and more and Malfoy knows it.
I don't sleep very much that night and the sleep that I do get is fitful and restless. I'm up at six in the morning, slinking through the house and making coffee.
Parkinson plays with her fork, stabbing a leaf of lettuce.
„We weren't even fighting anymore, Potter.“
Draco rolls his eyes. „I will not say it again, Potter. I do have
Draco just lifts an eyebrow. „That sounds nice. Where are you headed?“
I usually find ways to justify my stalking tendencies when it comes to Draco. In school, it was never all that difficult.
"But the biggest thing for me was, I think, that you didn't see me anymore. You saw your best friend's sister, your surrogate-mother's daughter. You saw a secure future with kids and a house and a pretty girl to take care of. I don't think that you ever loved me. At least not in the way I want my partner to love me.“
„Professional interest.“
„Are you just going to stare at me, Potter?“ There is almost a smile on his lips.
I arch a brow. „I'm fucking the Chosen One. I really don't think anyone in their right mind would say no to that.“
I look down, then into his eyes again.
Teddy tugs at my jeans.
Slender hands are sifting through my hair and I hum in contentment. „You have a lot of scars,“ Draco says quietly.
„But you want to.“
In broad daylight, Knockturn feels like a sad, forgotten place, roamed by sad, forgotten creatures. At night though, there is something dangerous in the glint of stranger's eyes, like every window would hide another secret.
“There is another way,“ she says.
Something dangerous creeps into Julien's voice.
It's hard to resist the urge to roll my eyes. I want to shove Malfoy against the counter, just to make him lose this haughty, composed facade.
When Weasley drops by late in the evening, unannounced and with me alone in the house, I have a panic attack.
Draco looks whiter than white in this light. Harry has always been amazed by the amount of veins visible under Draco's skin.
Weasley frowns. „Finite.“
But I've always been a stupid slag for Potter, from the moment on I first saw him as this scrawny child, bony wrists poking out of baggy jumpers. Atrocious glasses attempting to hide striking eyes.
He takes her from Draco's arm and Lily grabs at his face, which makes James laugh.
Unlikely.
I shift my weight. „I don't know. It might've.“
He always announces his presence now before walking up to me, after he has startled me several times, making me jump and spill tea.
They'd be scandalised. They'd think of me as foul and defiled.
„I'm fucking starving, Potter. Get off.“
„Nah, she won't.“ George flaps his hand.
„So do you,“ she says.
Anger. I'm angry at Draco. I'm angry at him for leaving me.
My stomach drops. To me, it sounds like there might be someone else. But I'm sure as hell not going to be the one putting that thought in Ron's head, especially not when I don't even know if I am right.
Despite the fact that Harry did like to play Quidditch with the Slytherin and to throw teasing insults at each other in the hallway, he hated him for his comeback at their first Quidditch match.
My heart is beating so fast that it's painful when Harry knocks on my door.
Telling Ginny I'm bisexual wasn't something I've dreaded. I mean, I was nervous, for sure. The Dursleys are, unsurprisingly, very strictly set on their conversative beliefs about sex and love and marriage and later on, with my friends or the Weasleys, the topic hardly ever came up.
“Let's get this over with, then.“
Harry snaps. He blames it on the high tension, on the panic – the past terror and his present, very very real fear of Draco leaving.
I look at her through the bars, my hair stringy. I've came here right after work, because they only allow visits in the morning on Saturdays. „I thought it would pass if I just ignored it, but it doesn't. I miss him so fucking much.“
who I am, Harry.“ I'm getting louder. „I never fooled you. You knew you were dating someone all the people you love hate!“
I can feel she isn't cool with it, not really, but I'm running late already, so I let it slide and make a mental note to go to Brandon's place if possible.
„You really hurt me, Draco. In school, I mean. And after, too. I understand that you hadn't much say in the matter when it came to doing what Voldemort asked of you. I don't think you really wanted to follow him. But I also haven't forgotten how you used to treat me and Neville. Ron.
I catch Kathy’s eye. She’s bartending every Saturday and Tuesday and by now, I’d say she’s my only friend beside Pansy and maybe Blaise, though no one ever really knows what’s going on in Blaise’s head.
Draco is glaring again. It's a less attractive look than when his face is soft but it's still, well – attractive.
Summer heat and dry grass. Blisters on my hands. Darkness, hard, unrelenting wood under my fingers. Spiders in my hair.
My breath catches in my too tight chest.
“Oh, damn.“
„What do you want?“ I ask instead.
„Maybe you should write an essay about them,“ Draco says distractedly, trying to wipe melted ice cream off Daisy's chin.
Draco buries his face in his arms, but lets out a breathy moan.
He pulls back a little and runs one hand through his hair.
When he enters me, tears are rolling down my cheeks. I gasp as he's thrusting with force, driving into me. Pleasure almost blinds me, but behind all of that desire, that primal urge for
I'm seeing the apartment through his eyes. A ratty couch, a small desk overflowing with parchment, all rolls scribbled on in tight, small handwriting to fit as many words as possible on one roll.
„I'm sorry for how things played out. I didn't want that to happen. Not like this, at least.“
I bite my lip.
„Something is up with you today.“
The first time Draco tries to touch Harry is a catastrophe. Harry freaks out and almost sets their whole flat on fire. It takes Draco hours to calm him down again. Then another hour until Harry stops apologizing.
Harry averts his eyes for a moment, then meets Draco's. „Never. It was nice to see you again.“
He's standing in the middle of his shop, gasping for air. Only when another customer walks in, he manages to pull himself together.
He looks genuinely offended. I don't back down, just arch my brow at him.
I trudge through the snow coating the way to my shabby flat, shaking, hands shoved into my pockets. It's day forty-one past Harry, meaning Christmas is long gone and no one wants any snow anymore, but it's falling almost daily anyway.
„You weren't ready,“ Ron signs, face full of compassion.
Pale, delicate hands are stroking down my arms. He steps so close that I can feel his breath.
She nods pensively. „It's strange.“
Liquid fear is running through Harry's veins. He knows that Draco will come. „And what then? Will you kill him, too?“
After a short moment, I decide to tell him the part of the truth I'm most confident about. The part that matters, because I know it's real. „Because I think he's innoccent.“
Draco squeezes his hand. His free one reaches for the bottle.
I wait when I have to recast the cooling charm on the champagne for the third time.
„He tried to convince Robards that he tricked me into having sex with him.“
“I didn't want to mess things up for Weasley,“ he says quietly.
„Harry! Wait up, mate.“
Harry groans as Draco draws back, wiping his mouth.
Hermione smiles. „I'll see you at the library.“
„You can have the couch,“ I then write and disappear into the bathroom first.
I'm not quite sure what he means with
It's so noticable that Draco even asks Harry: „Is there a policy about touching?“
„You mean that the victims' value might differ, in the eyes of the Death Eaters?“ Terry asks.
I catch a glimpse of him once as I cross Diagon Alley around Christmas Time, hood pulled deep into my face. He's with the Golden Trio, their hands full of too many shopping bags. I think he's smiling and I decide to believe he's doing better.
Malfoy smirks wryly.
After ninety minutes, I get off the machine on wobbly legs, drying my face with the towel I brought, yearning for a shower.
Maybe it's because it's been many weeks. Maybe it's because I have a perverted kink for virgins.
I nod. „Yes. It is illegal, though.“
„I know, love.“
I look into Malfoy's pale face. „What?“
“Owl me, you prick.“
„I trust Draco with my life,“ Harry tells him and he can feel Draco's silver gaze on him. He wonders if Draco would say the same about him.
Draco blinks at me. „I know nothing about sex.“
I lightly touch the little cut in my lip, made by a stranger's teeth. A stranger whose name I have either forgotten or never even known in the first place.
Seeing the pity in Draco's eyes is almost too much for Pansy.
This is Pansy. I can be honest with her.
„I get it,“ she says and I glare at her.
The first look tells me the terrible truth, but I refuse to believe it. I have to grab the bag, have to shove my hand inside, have to turn it and shake it and then whimper, high, choked off sounds, until I finally face the fact that I've been cheated.
I just shake my head, trying to breathe and focus on the cool air flooding my lungs, on the solid ground beneath my feet. But it's not enough. I'm drifting and I don't know how to anchor myself.
My hands are shaking only slightly as I push the paper away from me.
Draco nods.
It's funny that he deems my opinion on such a matter valid.
„Something like that. Weasley almost blew things with Granger and Potter got dumped by Weaslette,“ Draco says and for a second, he is the Draco Malfoy I remember.
„Not so much I'd disregard evidence pointing to it as the source of illicit potions,“ Malfoy snaps.
Our whole flat is littered with parchment and books, carelessly left on every available surface. We'll start our field training tomorrow and Robards made it abundantly clear that he expects us to be in top form.
He bites his lip, but doesn't look down.
Draco throws me a curious look. „I thought you'd be married by now. At least engaged.“
Pansy hesitates. „It can be. But it depends on the girl, doesn't it?“
Andromeda is a little hysterical when we arrive at her house. Teddy is fine – only the normal symptoms of the upcoming full moon. Draco, despite his own rather disastrous state, is endlessly patient with both Teddy and Andromeda.
„I kind of thought you'd have moved in with him by now, shagging in a king size, letting him buy you jewelry and talk about green-eyed brats. That maybe that was why you didn't come.“
„What did you want to say?“ Harry asks him.
She leaves the shop without buying anything.
“That was... a coincidence. I don't deal, George.“
I just wish I wouldn't have forgotten how to live my own.
The third time, I'm at his flat. When no one opens and everything stays quiet, I start to get anxious.
Potter nods slowly.
„In two days, you'll be complaining again.“
It must be some natural instinct that has your brain instantly release a rush of those fuzzy love-hormones. When James was born, I was afraid like I had never been before. And I've been afraid before, a couple times, I'd say.
Yesterday, I finally managed to get her to have dinner with me. We sat on the table together, drinking expensive champagne like we always used to, sharing takeaway and for the first time since I've walked through her door, I felt like what we used to have might not be lost completely.
„Harry and I did more than just kiss.“
Coffee. I love coffee. I remember that.
But Harry doesn't seem to think it's sappy at all. He presses his leg harder against mine, his thumb stroking my hand. „Yeah. Yeah, that's love to me, too.“
Harry hugs him, a little tighter than he normally would.
“I have to go.“
„You must be really desperate if you really have nothing better to do than stalk me again.“
All of this has started because he wanted to fuck Harry. And now there he is, telling him that he doesn't need sex.
“No, I didn't. I've been there before.“
The day at the fair is as stressful as it is glorious. Fae guides them all and Draco is constantly on edge.
Draco makes the sound of something that's dying and I grin widely. He turns his head away, embarrassed. I pull him a little closer, even though there wasn't really any space between us to begin with, and press a chaste kiss to his lips.
He does and my mouth falls open when he finds my prostate on the third thrust. My head falls back and I can't look at him anymore, my eyes closing. I clutch at his shoulders, scratch his back.
Maybe that's why I'm nervous as I slip the first finger inside Harry's tight heat, this lack of experience, but I really think it's because of Harry. The urge to make this good for him, to not betray his trust in me, burns bright in my chest, encouraging me and making me insecure at the same time.
