Harry had never asked him over for Christmas during their time apart. Draco couldn’t exactly blame him, but he didn’t know if Harry knew he’d spent the last three Christmases alone. Well, he’d gone to Hermione’s on Christmas Eve, but he couldn’t stay there and encroach on them, and the Weasleys always spent Christmas Day together – Harry and Teddy included.
“You probably wouldn’t believe me if I told you that was my Aunt Bella when she was a girl. It’s a Dutch commission, one of my favourites actually.” Harry jumps when Malfoy’s voice is much closer than he expected. There are many questions he wants to ask. Was she really once an innocent girl like the one in this picture? Or was it a great effort to have her sit for her portrait? Is it Malfoy’s favourite because it’s of his aunt? Or does he like it for the use of light and colour that drew Harry’s attention?
‘Hey,’ he wrapped an arm around Harry’s waist and rested his chin on his shoulder. ‘We’re past that. If it was enough for you to notice, then I wasn’t balancing my time very well. Anyway, it’s not really an issue now, is it?’ Harry turned and kissed Draco’s cheek.
‘Our application was approved. W-we can proceed with adopting Ella.’ As he looked up the first tear fell from his eye and ran in a neat line down his cheek. Even when he cried, he looked perfect. Draco thought his heart might cease beating.
‘Come on Rosie, you can help Mummy out of this silly dress.’ She picked her up from his side and balanced her on her hip.
‘I think you’ve been a little busy for that. Besides, I like a spot of research. Anyway, I think I found something which might shed some light on the situation.’ Draco was ready to hear just about anything that might help him figure out why his own magic hated him.
It was unfair, and it was selfish, and Draco would be back to his familiar self-loathing when it was done, but when Harry reached out and pulled Draco into him, he let him hold him because if Draco was honest, he was tired of this. He was tired of the lies and the games and the misunderstandings and he really missed his husband. Eventually, Draco fell into an uneasy sleep in Harry’s arms for the first time in three years. Neither of them made it into work that day, and somehow, none of their friends were surprised.
The blood was rushing in his ears as he watched Harry talk to the waiter. He had no idea what either of them were saying, he simply stared at the way Harry’s lips moved and his easy smile. To distract himself from the wave of anxiety, he studied the sharp line of Harry’s jaw as he talked, watched the tendons in his neck work and wondered whether they could just skip dinner altogether so he could take him home.
How? How could he have possibly been so drunk that he couldn’t recognise his own ex-husband? What was Harry even doing at a muggle club, didn’t he have Leggy-Blonde?
Just as he was about to fall asleep, he was jolted awake by Harry grabbing his bandaged hand. He didn’t say anything as he unravelled the gauze and revealed the inch-long slash across his palm. He pulled his wand out even though he didn’t really need it, and Draco watched as the skin knitted back together.
he’d made didn’t make him feel any better. He’d also never heard of mind spells before. Was that Smith trying to dumb down medical terminology for him? He’s not an idiot, he tried to get into healer training himself. Passed the exams with ease even.
At some point, sometime that day, she did go back to writing that letter. Instead of just staring at her, Harry even helped. But along with the signing of said letter, and the hatching of the plan to bring Remus and Sirius together, Potter became Harry and Malfoy became Lyra.
’ Teddy didn’t like that very much, he half climbed over Draco to give him a bear hug, even though he was far too big for that.
badge, the first snitch Harry ever caught, the invisibility cloak, the ring Harry had given him at Christmas that he’d handed right back again. His heard clenched painfully when he saw it.
“So what this is saying is, if we can get hold of Potter’s wand, it should be connected enough to him that we could create a living anchor on this side of the Veil and pull him back through?”
a favour getting me in today. You two are much better company. Try and pay me again and I’ll cast a rather nasty bat-bogey hex on you.’ Draco screwed his face up in disgust at that. No thank you.
‘It’s not really any of your business, Wood. Come of Ted.’ He cringed at how much he sounded like his father, and purposefully held his hand out for Teddy to prove the opposite. Teddy, to his credit, had learned better than to question Draco when they were in public. They left the shop and Wood, and Draco put on a brave face to battle the crowds to the apothecary where he’d need to go in the first place.
‘I think I’d like to be a healer when I’m grown up. Or I want to look after plants, people forget about them.’ Draco smiled fondly at how caring he was. Maybe they hadn’t done such a bad job of raising him after all.
He turned, his shirt still clutched in his hand and found Harry standing there with his wand pointing right at Draco’s naked chest. Draco dropped the photo which smashed and scatter glass everywhere, a shard of which bounced off the floor and wedged itself in Draco’s forearm as he tried to catch the frame before it hit the floor.
“I didn't noticed until you said it, but I’m shattered.” Ron yawned loudly and stretched his arms high above his head. Harry was exhausted too and glancing at the clock he realised it was already nearly two in the morning. He was sure it hadn’t been that late when they’d got back.
He couldn’t remember a thing from the night before. He’d been at a muggle club. Ok, he’d never slept with a muggle before, so it couldn’t have been a one night stand repeated. He’d gone out with Pansy. That meant that he’d probably gone to a club he’d never been to either. He’d been to a muggle club before but been too afraid to sleep with a muggle in case in his drunken haze he slipped up and used some form of magic. He couldn’t figure out what was bugging him about the whole thing.
‘Of course I will.’ He promised, and he meant it. Harry smiled the kind of smile that brought the faint creases around his eyes out. They really were faint, he wasn’t even thirty yet, but they were little reminders of the life they’d lived so far.
The wards embedded in the door clicked open beneath his palm like a key turning in a lock. The door creaked open slowly and sunlight streamed through into the hallway. The magically sealed room inside was any historian’s treasure trove. It was this library which held the oldest and rarest of the Malfoy volumes. It was carefully preserved with charms and wards to protect the most fragile of pages. The magic itself was so strong that even natural sunlight couldn’t penetrate the protections. From as early as Draco could remember his father had begun teaching him the conservation charms, although it was a while before he had the competency to try for himself. Now it was Draco’s sole responsibility to look after these books and manuscripts, some of which contained magic so rare that these tomes were the only written proof of its existence.
‘Bring us some tea please. And don’t let me hear you speak with such poor grammar again. I know you’re capable of better.’ He heard his father in every word.
Harry would have been hacked off - hadn’t he already died and decided to come back? Hadn’t he already seen for himself that the grass wasn’t always greener? But he was so shocked by the intimacy he daren’t say a word. People all around them were openly gawking at them.
‘Absolutely. Please do let me know as soon as possible. I’m sure for now you have much to do. I hope to see you soon Mr Malfoy.’ Kingsley stood and shook Draco’s hand.
“Well, you know… it was pretty standard. We just, broke up… we stopped getting along and stuff.” The shrug Ron gave wasn’t as nonchalant as he had aimed for and Harry could see the doubt on his face.
‘Hello stranger.’ He turned his head to the side to find Hermione sitting at his bedside this time. He smiled at her weakly.
‘Actually, I asked you what you would think if I kissed you,’ he admitted. Harry’s face practically lit up.
“I had better go,” Granger said hesitantly as his fingers landed on the last chord. Any atmosphere built by the ebb and flow of the piece evaporated in an instant. Pansy’s chin left Draco’s shoulder and in a blink of any eye she had flung her arms around Granger’s neck and was kissing her fervently.
“You. Stupid. Fucking. Idiot. How. Could you. Do this. To me?” Harry does his best to hold back laughter as Draco smacks Orion with his slipper. They look so similar that it’s almost like watching Draco fight his own reflection. The twins are often mistaken for each other, although Harry now finds it easy to tell them apart. It would be pretty awkward if he accidently made out with his auror partner instead of his boyfriend. Not that that has happened.
‘Oh. I don’t know that much really. It’s a later period than my interests. I only really started learning when I was renovating the chateau…’
‘Harry we can’t! I’ve already heard Teddy this morning. I couldn’t live with myself if he saw anything.’ Harry didn’t answer him at first, just kissed him to shut him up. It was really hard to say no to that.
He watched beadily as his ex-husband entered the coffee shop. Draco’s favourite coffee shop. As if there weren’t hundreds of coffee shops all over the city that would keep him well away from Draco.
He didn’t care that he didn’t know what was going on between Harry and Wood. Harry had come for him as soon as he had asked, and he’d been here the whole time. Draco had all the time in the world to be angry at him later, but now he really needed him.
‘I know baby, but you need to listen to me.’ She didn’t look the same as she had the last time he saw her. Before she died she’d been painfully thin, her cheeks sunken and her complexion yellowed.
Harry’s hand was splayed across Draco’s stomach, right where his pyjama top had ridden up. The exposed skin was practically burning with Draco’s overwhelming awareness of Harry, but he couldn’t bring himself to loosen up the tense posture he’d adopted the second Harry had reached for him.
Draco knew he was clock watching. Every five minutes felt like some kind of purgatory and he was sure he’d read the same set of results three times and he still had no idea what they meant. He’d sent a couple of the pills down to the labs because apparently there was a muggleborn downstairs who’d had proper muggle lab experience. Draco had to admit he was relieved. It wasn’t that he wasn’t capable of doing it himself, but he’d been in complete turmoil over his behaviour with Harry and he really couldn’t focus on anything.
Draco realised how stupid he was to be telling Harry all of this now, now that everything had already fallen apart. He should never have accepted Kingsley’s offer to consult with the Ministry, he should never have made a deal with Hermione to stay for six months before moving, he should never have told Teddy he would be there when he came back from school.
thing would’ve been to not play the game in the first place. It’s certainly one way to wake me up in the morning. Come on, lets open these infernal presents before something in the living room explodes and we’re picking pieces of that crappy muggle plastic out of our hair for a week.’ He was nearly always adamant that he got to shower and dress before going downstairs on Christmas morning, but he would let that slide today. It was only ever really a habit he’d developed in his childhood, it was good to be a little less well turned out from time to time. He got up and shivered because of the significant temperature difference and grabbed his fluffiest dressing gown on his way out of the door. Harry and Teddy scrambled behind him.
‘Honestly, considering how much you used to berate Harry for being a reckless Gryffindor, your sense of self-preservation is really quite terrible.’
‘You’re a good man Draco, and you deserve to be happy. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise, not even yourself.’ He kissed her cheek gently.
‘Well, you see, you know that letter you got from Gringotts? The one that told you about the estate?’ He frowned.
‘Will you tell me? When things have settled down?’ He looked at Draco so earnestly that he briefly wondered how he had ever had the strength to leave him, even if he didn’t regret it.
‘No one can help me,’ he choked. ‘I can’t do it… I can’t… It won’t work… and unless I do it soon, he says he’ll kill them.’ He sobbed into the sink, hardly able to breathe, gulping in air as best he could. He shuddered with the overwhelming feeling of doom consuming him from the inside out. He steeled himself, finally looking up into the mirror and found Potter staring at him in the reflection.
‘Love you too little wolf.’ He watched him bound back up the stairs and almost changed his mind before he realised he probably had a little separation anxiety and he needed to get on with it – like ripping off a plaster or whatever that stupid phrase Harry used was.
“I’m going to show you on the desktop site because the screen is bigger for you to see, but I think you’ll prefer the app version so I’ll download it and you can use mine.” Already Draco has absolutely no idea what Harry is saying, so he nods and smiles and hopes for the best.
“Get over here, you little secret keeper!” Harry grabs for Draco’s waist and pulls him into a massive bear hug. Draco laughs and squirms when Harry’s chin digs into the ticklish spot between his neck and his shoulder and tries to pull away when Harry starts peppering his face with damp kisses, even though he secretly loves it.
‘I get by with a little help from my friends.’ Harry sang totally off key but with great enthusiasm. He thought maybe this was the best Christmas morning so far and he hadn’t even gotten out of bed yet. He glanced at his bedside clock which read ten in the morning and he was genuinely impressed that Harry had managed to keep Teddy occupied for so long.
Today he sat cross legged on the slightly damp grass, closing his eyes and allowing his thoughts to wander to the earth beneath his feet. He could feel wisps of silver, thin like spider’s webs reaching out towards him. There was an instinct to run, as if he needed to catch something. The earth was solid beneath his feet, but he could sense the rumblings of life beneath the surface. A hunter, then. The wind blew through his…fur? And as he ran branches and thorns snagged on his tail. He was getting closer; he could feel it. Heart pounding heavily in his chest, he took a deep breath and brace himself for-
‘Honestly, Potter. Have you no manners? I’m trying to clean myself and you’re disturbing me. Just because you wake up looking like a drowned sewer rat doesn’t mean you can get in the way of my cleanliness. Wait your turn, there’s a good boy.’ He closed his eyes to avoid getting the next lot of shampoo in his still stinging eye area. Also so he didn’t have to look at him.
‘Don’t be sorry. I’m here, I’ve got you. We’ll bring Teddy home to see you. I promise he understands. No one is angry with you, ok? We love you. I love you. Shhh, shhh. Please don’t cry. I’m right here.’ Draco only held onto him tighter and let Harry whisper in his ear everything he needed to hear.
The pitch black was disorientating and Draco tumbled to the floor. They hadn't even bothered to untie his hands. He lay there spread-eagled for an unknown length of time before he figured out how to haul himself up with his hands numb and tied behind his back. He tried to them free, but the ties cut into his wrists further and rubbed his skin raw. There was nothing he could do but manoeuvre himself onto the rickety metal bed with the thin mattress. It was difficult not to be dismayed at the state of the cell, with its peeling walls and smell of damp, but he knew it was a lot better than Azkaban would be if he ended up there. He had escaped doing time in the wizard prison thus far, however he was skating on alarmingly thin ice.
‘Draco doesn’t have to speak to your teachers when you’ve been naughty, does he?’ Harry gave her his best don’t mess with me look which had terrified Teddy until last year. Ella was unsurprisingly less moved, but she did as she was told and put her book back on the shelf.
He headed out of the kitchen towards the floo. Yesterday, as with many days which came before, he’d limited his use of the floo because it made him sick and tired. He wasn’t going to let that stop him anymore. He couldn’t.
‘You haven’t asked him about it?’ Draco had considered asking Teddy outright if everything was ok, but he supposed he had a parental version of an inferiority complex – he still thought of Teddy as more Harry’s than his own. He would never really admit it, but he always thought he’d be overstepping if he took matters into his own hands.
Draco was dangerously close to letting Harry back into his heart based on one panic attack and a messy kiss in the kitchen. He felt like a giddy fifteen-year-old.
“It’s funny you should come today of all days. I was just sorting through that awful library, throwing away some of my family’s gruesome dark magic books.” Sirius seemed to shiver, but Harry might have imagined it. “I found a spell I thought I might use to restore the tapestry.”
‘Only if we can look at Quidditch supplies!’ Draco rolled his eyes but agreed. He reluctantly agreed to let Teddy take a muggle black cab since he’d always been fascinated by them and was grateful he’d had the foresight to bring more muggle cash with him than he normally would. He wasn’t sure he’d ever get used to pounds and pence.
At least he had intended to. Except, when their lips met and Harry’s were so dry they were almost cracked, Draco was reminded of how many hours he’d spent outside in the grounds after Draco had yelled at him. In an instant the kiss became gentle, tender even. Barely more than the softest brush of lips, as though Draco could heal each crack himself if he tried hard enough. Harry’s fingers threaded through Draco’s hair because the smug git knew he was the only person on the planet allowed to touch Draco’s hair. They’d kissed a thousand times before but this, this was different. It felt like coming home after such a long, long time.
He slipped under the covers and shivered. He’d always cast warming charms on his side of the bed. Harry might be a human furnace, but Draco certainly was not. The bed warmed instantaneously, and Draco’s head flicked over to Harry’s side of the bed.
‘I haven’t done anything, don’t panic. There's something I want to show you. Would you come to the flat with me?’ He held out a hand to Harry, who took it and carefully extracted himself from the pile of photos surrounding him.  They took the floo to Draco’s apartment which was cold, and dark, and smelled like stale air since no one had been in a while. Harry turned the lights on and was surprised to see the piled of papers lying around everywhere. Draco walked over to the typewriter he’d purchased months ago with a little help from Hermione. Next to it was a large pile of pages loosely clipped together. He handed them to Harry.
‘I know. I’m sorry.’ And there is was. The first apology since the divorce. Draco didn’t know if it was an apology for the invite, or if Harry meant more, but somehow it felt like something had shifted yet again. Draco stood very still as Harry stepped towards him. He fought the instinct to step backwards, instead standing his ground.
He was furious. Apparently, the agreement that the Prophet wouldn’t report on Draco dissolved along with his marriage. His head fell into his hands as he realised that the goblins would absolutely have heard about this and Draco was absolutely not getting his loan.
Harry had done a beautiful job with the manor he’d bought at that auction. Draco had been hesitant at first, since he’d expected it to be just like Malfoy Manor. However, Harry deliberately had experienced interior designers team up with child psychologists to made the rooms as open and cheery as possible without being too false. The children loved it.
“For fuck sake, Granger! What do you take me for?!” He slammed his hand down on the piano, making the strings beneath vibrate in an eerie drone. They, all three of them, were sat in the parlour. Draco had been running up and down every arpeggio he had ever learned to keep his hands from shaking. He sneezed, his head pounding twice before settling again.
“It’ll just be for tonight. It’s late, you’ve been drinking, and I’m really tired. It’d be better to deal with it when we’ve slept.” Even as he said it he was thinking it was probably just a dream or a hallucination induced by a long and difficult week. As soon as he let go of the silver fox it skittered across the room and into the corner where it bared its teeth at them. Ron finally took some initiative and filled a bowl of water while Harry retrieved a sofa cushion to transfigure into a bed. He wasn’t sure the fox would sleep in it but even if it didn’t, he'd at least feel like he tried.
‘Forget the paperwork, anything to do with this case has authorisation directly from me. We’ll deal with everything else later.’ Now this was a whole other ball game.
Draco didn’t quite know where to look for the best, so he stuck with staring down at the keys, letting the final chord wane to nothing.
It didn’t appear to be the right time to say that Draco wasn’t in fact a Malfoy. When they’d married, Draco had actually taken Harry’s name. It surprised a lot of people; the papers had been running bets on whether they’d become Potter-Malfoys or Malfoy-Potters, but Draco was firm. He no longer had a reason to associate with the Malfoy family. He had no family left and no land to claim – he figured his marriage would mark the end of the family line and the beginning of a new life. Anyway, Draco had never found the time or the inclination to change his name back after the divorce. He didn’t particularly enjoy being a Potter, but since no one had ever bothered referring to him as one it hardly made any difference anyway. Only the legal documents would show any different.
“She knows that. And she also knows that if something happens to you, that will be her too.” Granger pursed her lips as if she hadn’t considered that before.
With a pop they arrived at their destination and the breath was knocked from his lungs. They stood on the corner of the very restaurant they had supposed to have visited the night they had their last fight as a married couple. He was lost for words. His throated tightened and his eyes burned with tears. Why would Harry bring him here of all places?
‘You’re right. As always. I’m sorry to distract you from your work.’ He stood and smoothed the creases out of his trousers. He turned to go but was stopped when she flung herself at him. She smelled like fresh flowers and as odd as the connection was, it sort of reminded him of his mother.
The scream haunted Draco all hours of the day and night. Ever since the first dementor attack he had been trying to understand why he heard such a blood curdling sound. In the height of his delirium, he had seen nothing but green eyes behind his own eyelids, unknown voices and heinous laughter echoing around him like ghosts. At one point he’d begged for it to be over, although he’s still not sure whether he actually made a sound. He doesn’t even remember if the dementors came for him.
‘Do you think we’re doing this too fast?’ Draco asked him. It had been weighing on his mind since the article had surfaced. They still hadn’t figured out who had blabbed to Rita Skeeter.
‘Why do you care so much about Harry?’ Draco didn’t like the way Smith always asked about him. Was he a closet superfan who wanted all the details? Was he going to use Draco’s insecurities against him? Everyone had an ulterior motive.
He in fact had several things he’d like to say, but he didn’t dare say any of them. He was searched roughly for any personal times, although he had none. His wand had been abandoned at the table when they’d arrived to take him. Satisfied that he had nothing on him but the rather expensive and now scruffy shirt on his back, he was taken away.
‘The Malfoys, Master. Spungen can feel the house will accept an heir from the Noble House of Black, should Master know the correct procedures.’ Spungen shot Draco a scarily knowing look for a house elf addressing his master. ‘Spungen will prepare the chateau now.’ With a crack Spungen was gone.
Draco watched the pair of them talk animatedly as they ate. Teddy didn’t seem nearly as cagy as he had in his letters which Draco was glad of. Still, he had a feeling that he wasn’t telling them something, and the note he’d found in his trunk was currently burning a hole in Draco’s pocket. He supposed it was his own damn fault for wearing skinny jeans. There was no space for anything in any pocket.
. Anyone. After all, what did Draco really bring to the table anymore? Once upon a time he’d been charming and sophisticated and generally quick witted. Now he was an anxiety induced recluse with enough baggage to weigh down the world’s strongest man.
The double doors at the end of the conservatory which opened out onto the land out the back were wide open. The light curtains were billowing out of the open doorway like they were dancing on a gentle breeze, except where Harry was standing, there were icy gale-force winds whipping at his back. The whole conservatory was glowing like a warm summer’s day and as the strumming of a guitar drifted across the wind, Harry wondered if he had accidently crossed continents.
“Thanks,” he muttered groggily. Trying to sit up properly he became aware of a weight on his lap. Settling his glasses on his nose properly, he realised there was a pair of large, molten silver eyes staring at him unblinkingly. They almost glowed in the semi darkness and despite being a source of calm to him just days ago, in the near dark it was clear they were the exact same eyes he had stared into through the misty archway in his dreams and that made him uneasy.
“You have a beautiful voice.” He said before he could stop himself. Her glare softened, as if suspended, and it took a second for her to get over the shock of being complimented. She blinked her long eyelashes again and the warmth in Harry’s chest fluttered like it was trying to escape. A fine strand of hair fell into her eyes and instinctively he reached out to tuck it behind her ear. She stared, frozen, as he did so.
Then again, his own naivety wasn’t so far behind. Did he really echo his father that much? He had his own mind; he had always been capable of making his own decisions.
‘Of course she’d understand. She loved you very much.’ Draco jumped and twisted around to see Harry standing behind him, his hands shoved deep into his pockets and the collar of his charcoal coat turned up to protect him against the chill of the wind. His wand was sticking out of his lapel and casting a little light into the darkness. Even in the small glow it gave off he looked beautiful, if a little tired. ‘You didn’t come home to me.’ He said when Draco chose not to reply.
As soon as Granger had gone, he bolted up to the top floor. He stopped on the way to grab a small silver dagger his father pretended was a letter opener from his desk drawer. There would only be one chance for him to get this right and he couldn’t afford to waste time.
‘I feel like I’m missing something, like I’ve gone outside without any clothes on or forgotten my keys or something important. He’s my responsibility, I promised Remus and Tonks I’d look after him and he’s hundreds of miles away. What can I do from here?’ Harry’s voice wavered as he spoke, and Draco struggled to hold back his own tears. He felt the same most of the time, except he’d never said anything aloud because he could never tell if it was the feeling of his lost magic or missing Teddy.
‘Dad charmed the baubles to act like bludgers and they chased us around the living room. We used pillows to whack them at each other. It was great!’ Teddy gushed excitedly. Draco dropped half a pastry back onto the plate in his other hand.
it happen; it just did! It was a complete accident!” He protests. Draco pauses his pacing long enough to glare at Harry like he just told him he kicked a puppy. If only Hermione still had her time turner, he would have gone back an hour and prevented the whole thing from happening.
“Oh no. Please tell me he didn’t. Even he’s not that stupid.” Draco was worried Granger might cry. He didn’t really do crying.
“Nothing!” Pansy said too brightly, “we were just discussing… how pretty the roses are!” She pointed to the side of the window completely opposite to the rose garden.
Having OCD is the bane of his existence. That, and having a boyfriend who can’t read more than three pages before getting fidgety and going to play quidditch.
? ‘Watch me. In…and out, in…and out.’ Harry kept his grip on Draco’s chin as he showed Draco how to take a breath in and let it go again.
Harry decided to take a different route. “Ok, so when was the last time you saw her.” All the colour drained from Ron’s face.
He made it upstairs fairly easily but when he set Teddy down on his bed, the young boy stirred just enough to be aware of what was happening.
“Of course, I shouldn’t have kept you so long, I’m sure you have very important auror-ing to do.” Harry wants to point out that auror-ing is definitely not a real word, but he supposes that next to Malfoy he doesn’t have a leg to stand on.
Sometime later, when they’d finally managed to acquire a pensieve, Draco watched as Harry withdrew a memory from his temple.
‘Draco, please, maybe you should think about this. It's very sudden. Are you sure this is even what you want? At least let me do this with you.’ He couldn’t look him in the eye, but he did kiss him, so gently that his lips barely ghosted over Harry’s.
He didn’t say it enough, he knew that much. He couldn’t expect Harry to know how Draco felt if he didn’t tell him so. How could anyone express this feeling? It was like his heart could burst with how much he loved Harry, but that wouldn’t sound very nice if he said it. Did everyone feel like that about their partner? That the world would just cease to exist if anything ever happened to them? He’d lost Harry before of course, but he had always been there. He hadn’t gone far.
‘Do you remember when I told you all about your how your dad and my dad were troublemakers at school?’ Harry asked him. He nodded eagerly. ‘Well, they also made this. It’s a map of the school that tells you where everyone in the castle is at all times. It used to show you secret passages to get out of the school – like the one-eyed witch passage you could take to get to Honeydukes. They were mostly closed after the war though. We thought you might like to have it since you’re the last descendant of a Marauder. I don’t really need it now, do I?’
‘Do you want to see some magic?’ The children were exposed to magic of course, but it wasn’t a regular occurrence around the place, so they were always thrilled to see it. She lifted her head from his chest but still held onto him tightly, turning her tear-streaked face towards Harry. He didn’t need to, but Harry withdrew his wand to perform the spell for the theatrics of it. He waved it over the page lightly.
‘Don’t give me that. Do you really think I’m going to let Teddy stay at yours if you’ve got some disgusting potions addiction?’ Harry was seething. Draco could’ve seen it, having known Harry all these years, except he didn’t need to. The ink well on his desk was rattling and the generic picture frames on his office walls were shaking. Harry’s magic was reacting to his anger and threatening to explode.
‘I wondered if you’d teach at the orphanage.’ Harry looked sheepish as though he expected Draco to be angry with him. ‘It’s not much, but those are the muggle papers you need to fill in before you get approval to work with children. It’s a basic criminal record check, it’s supposed to prove you’re safe. We have to have them so that any of the children in the muggle social care system can be transferred without us having to obliviate anyone.’
“It’s just something I need to figure out for myself,” he said desperately, searching her eyes for understanding. She nodded once but the step back she took from him told him more than enough.
‘Of course,’ Harry said politely. ‘The kids are well and truly exhausted huh?’ He said, dropping a kiss on Hugo’s head and hugging Hermione goodbye.
After their lesson, they were seated in the corner of the main shop where they could eat and drink coffee. Really it was lunchtime by the time they were finished but Draco didn’t really care. He watched the tourists amble down the cobbled streets looking equal parts excited and lost. There were a lot of them around here since they weren’t far from Notre Dame.
“Whose?” He asked. Her face was stony, and it was obvious that her conversation with Pansy hadn’t gone well.
‘Back to Potter, am I? Ouch. I suppose I deserve that one.’ Despite everything, Draco found himself chuckling alongside him.
He was just thinking about how he was going to pull himself up off the floor when he got a letter. It skidded through the bars of the cell and threw dust up which caught in his lungs and made him cough like a smoker. The dirt had smeared over the envelope, but he could already tell that it wasn’t a handwriting he was familiar with.
“Oh don’t be like that,” she snapped, “he would do the same and if he tries to say otherwise he’s lying.” Right there and then Draco had a brainwave.
‘You don’t need to explain, Draco. We both made mistakes, we both went about things the wrong way. We can’t take any of it back, but I promise if you give me another chance, I’ll never be oblivious to your suffering again. I don’t care if it takes years, I’m completely and utterly in love with you and I’ll do anything. There’s been no one since you. No one even came remotely close.’ Draco could tell from the determination in Harry’s eyes that he was telling him the truth.
Once, a long time ago, Harry had remembered seeing a medical magazine at a doctor’s appointment his Aunt Petunia had taken him to when he’d caught chicken pox. In one of the articles he vaguely remembered that when children cried in the night, parents weren’t supposed to give them too much attention because it taught them their crying would work and they wouldn't develop a good sleeping routine. Although the fox was clearly not a human child, Harry thought maybe the same principle applied and screwed his eyes shut tighter.
he missed that bright turquoise hair and big brown eyes. Except the turquoise had just turned a familiar shade of white blonde.
“I had no idea. I guess I didn’t really think about what you do all day…” It’s then that Malfoy finally looks up.
Draco refused to acknowledge Teddy’s comment, his mind was already well and truly fucked, and he didn’t need anything else to think about. He figured he should probably eat too, so he followed Teddy into the kitchen and decided he’d actually make him breakfast instead of leaving him to the unhealthy cereal again.
‘I’m surprised you came Draco.’ Neville said. They weren’t exactly friends, but they’d learned to be civil over the years.
‘No. No you’re not.’ Draco’s voice cracked. His father was dead, he couldn’t hurt him now. He could feel it, everything was wrong. Magic prickled harshly across his skin, like he was being stabbed with hundreds of tiny needles.
‘Yeah, we did.’ Harry turned his head to the side and kissed Draco cheek. Draco was hit with the domesticity of it all, even though the novelty should’ve worn off by now. He wasn’t sure he would ever be used to it, really. He’d never expected to have a family like this in a million years. Before his father had died, he’d thought he would marry whomever he saw fit to match him with and deal with the consequences of being with a woman. Lie back and think of England as Pansy used to joke. Then, after his father died, Draco knew he could never live a lie like that, but it wouldn’t matter anyway because no one would want to be associated with him.
He was in luck however, because he found the fox when he went to the bathroom. Well, he didn’t exactly find the fox, more the trail of the fox’s destruction. It had clearly made the most of the opportunity to explore away from Harry’s watchful gaze. The collection of cologne bottles and deodorant sticks had been knocked off the shelf and were scattered all over the floor. A glass bottle of foundation left behind by Hermione was shattered, its dark contents splattered all over the pale floor tiles and up the side of the bathtub.
‘Oh!’ Draco forced a hideously cold laugh. ‘Is that what you did? And I suppose all those criminals you put behind bars were just
‘He lied to me Mum. He lied again and again and now I don’t know if I can trust him. What if I need to have my secrets? He doesn’t understand.’
‘Thank you very much Miss Daphne, I love it!’ Ella said politely when they were almost ready to leave. Draco helped her back into the coat he hadn’t noticed her taking off.
“Take a seat, Harry. I’ll get you some tea. You need it.” Remus pulled a chair out for him as he stood and walked over to the kettle, looking as comfortable as if it was his own home. All eyes were still on him as he sat down. He looked at Ron.
“Please? You don’t even need to help really; you could just leave me in there. I won’t touch anything but the books I promise. But since your father helped the Ministry a lot back in the day, it knows the library quite well…” Malfoy tenses at the mention of his father and Harry thinks he might well have just ruined his only chance at getting a look at the Malfoy tomes.
‘Is it that bad? It might be selfish of me but I just…I don’t- I don't think I’m ready to share you with the world again just yet.’ His head swam with all the things he used to be accused of – of corrupting Harry or using him to improve his reputation or even using him to get into the healer training programme. Perhaps that hurt the most of all. He worked damn hard for those exams, he was more than capable of getting in without help from anyone.
He was so caught up in watching her, he didn’t know where she was in the letter when she paused. She tapped the pen twice against the page and then let go of it, reaching up to her hair. Harry watched with fascination as she scooped her curls up in her hands and seamlessly twisted them onto the top of her head, a few loose waves falling down at the side of her face. The whole action took mere seconds, it clearly being a familiar and practised movement, but it left Harry stunned.
‘Of course he can’t, but he’s also from a long time ago when clever little girls like you weren’t nearly as big and strong.’ He wasn’t really equipped to deal with this, he still felt out of his depth with Teddy, but he was immensely proud of her intuition. He should introduce her to Hermione, they’d get along like a house on fire.
He tried to speak again but his throat was dry, and he ended up having a coughing fit. Granger handed him a glass of water, pouring steadily from the jug they had been provided with. Draco was impressed by how calm she seemed.
He took his time in the shower, allowing the hot water to warm his bones. He had never been more grateful for shampoo in his life. His was mixed especially for him after a ridiculously expensive consultation with a fancy London stylist. Looking at the minimalist bottle now, it felt frivolous and stupid.
“If you say so…” Harry doesn’t like how uncertain Malfoy seems. Does he really think Harry is here because he’s in trouble? “Would you like tea?” Harry nods, and Draco disappears out of the room faster than Harry can say ‘yes please’. He would have thought a house elf would bring tea for them, but since there wasn’t one to answer the door either…
‘Why not?’ He asked her. He’d found she always had something to say about the books she read, even if they were just simple kiddie stories.
Draco watched as Teddy practically danced down the street towards the ice cream parlour. He took in the delight on Teddy’s face that was there just because he was spending time with Draco, and he was sure that whenever his time came, he was most assuredly going to hell.
‘I don’t care about that. I care about not telling you Harry’s business. He has enough to worry about without me discussing him behind his back.’ Draco would not compromise on this. He wouldn’t.
‘You’re killing me.’ He adjusted his grip on Draco and his hand came in contact with the letter. ‘What’s this?’ Draco had completely forgotten about it.
“Are you sick? I don’t have much favour anymore, but I still know a few healers who would help if they knew-” His chest swelled with affection when he dared to meet her eye and saw the earnest look on her face. It was hard not to smile.
“It’ll all get cleared up in the end, don’t worry.” He tried to placate her, but her face was ashen. It only made her vibrant lipstick stark against her rapidly greying pallor.
He listened as Harry and Teddy wandered around upstairs. He wondered what they were doing, it wasn’t as if they needed to but Teddy to bed anymore. He tried his best to stop thinking, just for a few minutes, but he couldn’t. His thoughts strayed to how much more complicated things were now that Teddy knew. If things ever broke down between him and Harry, it wouldn’t bear thinking about what would happen.
and something fluttered in Harry’s chest at that. There wasn’t time for him to respond because Sirius and Remus emerged from the doorway.
‘The portkey leaves in two minutes. Have you got everything?’ Draco nodded and looked down at the small, mother of pearl button that had been designated for their journey. He found it insulting that such a small, insignificant object held more power than he did. He took a deep breath to prepare himself. Harry took his hand and gave him a small smile of sympathy. It wasn’t much, but it quelled Draco’s anxiety a little to know at least Harry was going with him this time. He’d sent an owl to Teddy to tell him what was going on, but they hadn’t had a chance to floo call yet. He missed his little boy terribly – he felt as though he’d been robbed of precious time with him. He’d been trying not to think about it.
As the screaming reached unbearable levels, and Harry was sure his eardrums were bleeding, he managed to find a gap around the edge of the curtain. In its panic, the fox had wrapped most of the fabric around itself. Harry pulled the loose edge and the fox tumbled around until it righted itself and glared at Harry. He would have been worried, knowing the ferocity of an angry fox, but with one ear up and one ear down where it had taken a tumble, Harry could only think how cute it was.
‘Smith. He- he wanted to take you away from me. Said I had to go back to dark magic. I-I don’t want to.’ His voice cracked painfully.
‘Yes, well, you two best be going.’ Harry said, rubbing the back of his neck as he always did when he felt awkward. His lips pressed into a tight line and Draco had the strong suspicion that something else was going on that he didn’t know about.
‘I know. You like this one though,’ Harry said with a smile. Draco huffed but that only made Harry’s smile grow. He offered Draco a hand and when he took it, he led him downstairs. It was a particularly frosty morning, there had even been snow forecast, and the chill had bitten its way through the warming charms, particularly against the glass panels in the living room. Harry waved a hand absently in their general direction and the draught stopped immediately. Draco pushed the surge of jealously away and focused on Harry instead. He’d been up and dressed before Draco, choosing to hang around the house in a long-sleeved shirt and joggers. Draco had thrown a fit the first time he’d seen him in a pair, calling them an abomination and an insult to fashion but now, now they were just Harry and of course, Draco owned a pair himself. Whenever Harry wore them Draco knew he was seeing the soft Harry who wasn’t a dangerous wizard, who let the kids use him as a human climbing frame and it made him relax just a little more.
‘Because she’d just received the planning permission for the refurb, which we could only get if we got approval for the whole project to go ahead. She was desperate to tell me the good news.’ Of course. Harry had answers for it all. Draco felt like a prized idiot for ever thinking Harry would date someone without telling Draco, or anyone else they knew for that matter.
‘Does it have something to do with this? Don’t worry, I haven’t read it, I just found it.’ He took the note out of his pocket and handed it to Teddy. He took it from him and unfolded it.
‘Would it have changed anything if I had?’ He asked, glancing up at Draco. Draco had to admit he had a point, but Harry didn’t give him a chance to fanswer. ‘I’d planned on leaving a long time before you were brought in on that case, I just didn’t see the point in saying anything.’
In the fifth month of Draco’s not-deal with Hermione, he moved to the outskirts of Paris. It was a strange transition, because he hadn’t expected to be making trips back and forth between his rented flat and a bloody chateau. Perhaps he’d been a bit premature with his move, but he used the first month in France to get the family estate in a liveable condition.
‘Take it off.’ He said gently. He didn’t try to unravel it himself, only lay there propped up on the plush pillows, watching him patiently. Draco picked at the edges. He debated how it might make him feel before he realised he was just making it worse by waiting. He peeled back the bandage. He held his breath as coil after coil slipped through his fingers until finally, there was just one, thin piece of material between him and the branding that turned his life upside down.
‘Is it that bad?’ Hermione asked him quietly. He could hear the distress in her voice and he didn’t dare look. ‘Harry just wants to help. We all do.’ He huffed a hollow laugh.
As if in a blur there were forms signed and dates stamped. All the while Ponytail stood next to Draco, keeping a tight grip on his upper arm as if it was necessary to hold him in place when he was about to walk right out of there. He could hardly believe it. It seemed so surreal after two days of solitary confinement and no daylight, so he kept his mouth tightly shut until he was certain it was safe to speak.
‘Why is it that everyone else hears about this stuff before I do?’ Draco moaned. Slumping down on his stool. Pansy shrugged.
He was just about to give up and turn in early for the night when he felt a shift in the wards around the house. Draco had taught him a lot about how to attune himself to the house and it had been a very difficult process without the necessary Black blood. Thankfully living in the house with an actual Black descendent had helped. There’s no way Harry would’ve got the stuffed house elf heads off the walls without Draco’s help.
“I don’t quite know how to phrase this part,” she said to the paper. Harry was so convinced that she had forgotten he was there that he leant over to read what she had written so far, mostly to remind her she wasn’t talking to herself. At that exact moment, Malfoy turned her head towards him to seek his opinion. They were a hair’s breadth from clanging their foreheads together, but they managed to stop in time.
‘I don’t talk about Harry. What goes on between us stays between us. He’s not even my husband anyway.’ He felt it like a real pain in his chest when he said it aloud. He hated being reminded how precarious his current situation was. One wrong move and Harry could easily kick Draco out again. There was nothing binding them together anymore, not directly anyway.
‘What?’ Harry’s mouth snapped shut and Draco looked down at Ella who was still sitting in his lap and looking up at him with wide, terrified eyes.
“Easy peasy!” Granger said with a grin. She handed the wand to Draco as if he would know whether this was Potter’s wand or not. It was immaculate despite the fact that it had been in an evidence locker supposedly collecting dust for eight months.
“Granger, I’m tired. Can we please wrap this up?” It was testament to his current state that in his fatigue he was still managing to be somewhat polite to her. She frowned at him and he wanted to glare back at her, but he hadn’t the spirit for it.
‘I’ve told you not to stare at me when I’m sleeping,’ Harry said groggily, his hand running gently down the bumps of Draco’s spine. He hadn’t opened his eyes yet, and Draco found it oddly endearing that he was so relaxed around him. He often would wake up with a wand in his face in the early days – Harry had had less control over his nightmares back then.
He jumped when Harry gripped his wrist and took his wand out of his hand. He was about to panic when Harry said,
There was a scuffling from the bath and Harry’s attention was immediately piqued. It was then that he noticed the shower curtain had been ripped from its hooks, in the same manner as the living room curtains, and was crumpled in the bottom of the bath. It was the shower curtain Hermione had bought when the previous one had started going mouldy. It was pale pink with white elephants all over it, but most importantly it was currently moving.
And that was how, in the fourth month of Draco’s agreement with Hermione Granger-Weasley, Draco Malfoy woke up in bed with Harry Potter.
The second they were back in the house, Harry was kissing Draco within an inch of his life. He hadn’t even waited to put Draco down, he simply stood in the middle of the kitchen/living room, holding Draco bridle-style. It was, hands down, the best kiss Draco had ever received. Harry kissed him like he was a dying man, and Draco happily lapped it up. They had three years of this to catch up on.
‘Auror Macmillan wants you to look through the file and tell him if any of the locations are suitable for growing aconite. He also wants to know if there are any wards or magical residues the aurors should look of for in the field.’ The intern sounded as if she was parroting the exact words Macmillan had said to her and despite Draco’s irritation, he knew there was no point in taking it out on an intern.
‘Draco don’t be silly.’ He held Draco’s face in his hands and Draco felt like he could float away. ‘Listen to me now. I would never do that. I shouldn’t have threatened you with Teddy I’m really sorry.’ He said earnestly.
any time soon.’ He emphasised her use of Weasley’s full name for dramatic effect. He was nothing if not committed.
“I want to get in touch with Remus. Professor Lupin, that is. I think it’s time he and Sirius… I don’t know, got a few things straight with each other? They were friends, before we were born. When Sirius was sent to Azkaban…well, I guess Remus believed what everyone else did.”
‘Good evening Edward,’ Andromeda said with a sly smile. Draco simply watched on confused. Teddy blushed profusely and hid behind Harry.
‘How did you get Daddy here? He hates the house now.’ He’d called him Daddy again – Harry had been telling the truth all those months ago. Draco felt like a bit of a fool. Teddy reached up for some glasses while Harry set the plates down on the table.
He was just finishing is second cup of tea with his aunt, who was telling him a lot about the various plants she was learning to grow in the garden, when Harry arrived. Draco was actually disappointed as Andromeda had grown up in the Black family and had some very interesting knowledge on some of the rare plants that were no longer available in England.
“All of this started when you showed up!” Harry started pacing the floor beside the bed, suddenly very aware he was wearing pyjamas that he hadn’t been wearing before. He hoped someone had only transfigured his clothes, not actually changed him. “And what good have you done since then?” He accused his fox. Aspen growled in indignation, baring his teeth as if ready to attack but with no real malice behind it.
The memory ended, and the present Draco found himself on the floor of his dingy little flat.  In the end, Draco had taken the floo to Luna’s where he’d cried himself to sleep. When he’d tried to return the next day, Harry had blocked the floo. Weeks of unanswered owls had told Draco all he needed to know. In the end, Hermione had gone to the house to collect Draco’s things. A few weeks after that, divorce papers landed on Luna’s kitchen table and Draco wondered where in the world his marriage had gone.
‘So it is drugs. You’re disgusting. Do you have any idea how disgraceful it is to be on this stuff when you’re looking after our son?! How dare you? Where did you even get this stuff. If I’ve brought you in on an official Ministry case whilst you’ve been off cavorting with dark wizards I swear to God I’ll-’
‘Draco, please. Don’t get yourself worked up. We still don’t really understand what’s happening to you, but I think it’s playing off your anxiety. Please, I know it’s hard but please try to stay calm.’ He was so angry with himself. Furious even. The last time he’d seen Teddy he’d yelled at him, made him cry, then promised him he’d be back soon. He’d gone back to Hogwarts and Draco had missed it. He’d gone off to Scotland without even knowing if Draco was ok. He was the worst parent in the world. He’d already put Teddy through so much and he’d done it yet again. He had to go to Hogwarts. He had to apologise. He had to never do anything so stupid again.
‘Please tell me he finally got rid of her,’ he said. Hermione did her best to supress her smirk and nodded.
‘Yes, darling, you’re a sausage. Now eat your breakfast.’ He glanced over at Susan who was making herself a cup of tea and watching him with a knowing expression. He didn’t know what she thought she saw but he didn’t question it. Susan made a cup of tea for him too and he leant against the counter as he watched them eat and chatter. Ella was desperately trying to keep yoghurt off Johnny’s face and failing miserably, but she didn’t seem to mind.
‘Not this time. Well, if you’re going to be an arse about it I suppose I could spend a couple of hours perusing…’ Harry’s groan was enough to have him feeling smug. ‘No, on this occasion I wanted to show you this.’ He stopped right in the middle of the street where one of the shop fronts had been hidden by a disillusionment charm. The muggles walking past would probably see them staring at a poster for the ballet. ‘Oh my…’
‘SAUSAGE!’ Johnny shouted and descended into giggles. He missed this. The amusement kids found in almost anything. He very rarely ever came here so early, not wanting to interfere with goings on too much, but this reminded him of what it was like when Teddy was small, and he missed how rewarding children could be.
‘I suppose it’s because they kind of look like roses. Only circular windows ever get called rose windows. They’re a particular style of Gothic architecture, so there are a lot of modern windows like these in England because of the Gothic revival. Sometimes they’re called Catherine windows. I think that’s probably where muggles get the name Catherine wheels from.’
Draco didn’t know what to say. It made complete sense and yet he had never thought about it. It wasn’t everyday people survived that kind of trauma, so it wasn’t as if there was a stockpile of cases to compare him to. Had so much of what he’d achieved been because of Harry’s magic though? Surely, he had some strength of mind to do it himself. He wasn’t a coward anymore and he wasn’t stupid.
“What rights?” The man said. “You think you have rights now?” He stepped backwards and two guards slammed the cell door closed behind him. At that moment, the bonds tying Draco’s hands released, but he didn’t move. He stayed where he had been dumped on the ground and stared at the man on the other side of the bars whose face was now half in shadow. Draco could feel his pulse thumping in his head, and his wrists stung where the invisible bindings had held them, but he was defiant.
‘Have you heard from Teddy? How’s Hogwarts treating him?’ Hermione asked as she walked into the room. Her curly hair was still a little damp, but she seemed much less flustered than she had been when he’d dropped into her office.
The Ministry was the same as ever when he arrived. The wizard who checked his fake ID slip barely even glanced at him before letting him through without question. That was especially worrying considering how soon out of the war they were – he would have expected security measures to be much more stringent than that. It was almost too easy.
“I don’t know. Luna told me he isn’t a magic fox, but I just don’t believe her. You know when you just have this
‘You remember when I told you about my Aunt Bella casting the Cruciatus Curse on me during the war?’ Harry nodded.
‘Hugga!’ She said happily, trying her best to kiss her little brother before she gripped Draco’s coat with such ferocity her small knuckles turned white. Being only two, she missed Hugo’s forehead and planted a very slobbery kiss worryingly close to his eye. Naturally, Hugo didn’t seem to appreciate it.
Luna had suggested some kind of oil to give to the fox to help ease this anxiety. A couple of drops in his food once a day and his mood swings should be easier to control. Already very protective of Aspen, Harry really didn’t want to start giving him medication, it didn’t seem right to be messing with nature like that. At first, he had tried to persevere, but these episodes were getting more frequent, so he decided to get a second opinion.
She leapt up from the table, sending cutlery flying everywhere. “YOU CAN’T ARREST HIM! HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT! Is this because he was a Death Eater? Because it’s
He kissed Draco with as much love as he could physically muster through a kiss. Teasing Draco’s bottom lip gently and sinking a hand into Draco’s ridiculously soft hair. Harry could never quite get over how much Draco melted into their kisses. Harry could actually feel the way Draco gave himself over to them as though he was literally giving Harry his heart with every kiss. Sometimes, Harry got so frustrated that he would never be able to express the amount of love he felt towards Draco, that his magic attacked their surroundings. He was managing to keep it under control just barely, because it normally sent Draco into an absolute frenzy when he was witness to Harry’s accidental magic, and Harry knew he wasn’t in the right frame of mind for that right now.
‘I don’t know why I said it. It isn’t true. I’m stressed and I took it out on you and I’m sorry.’ It wasn’t good enough. He didn’t get to throw curveballs like that and think a simple apology would fix it.
“How do you feel?” Granger asked him anxiously. She was an inch shorter than before, and he could see that the Polyjuice was starting to wear off, which meant he was already well on his way to being his normal self again. He was glad he had brought extra.
“The bloody hell is that racket?” The voice was painfully familiar to Draco and instantly his mouth snapped shut. Weasley was quite literally the last person he wanted to come across in this situation. The realisation sunk in as he noticed the messy black hair and the glint of glasses. He’d just prostrated himself against the legs of Harry Potter. He would never live it down.
‘Yes. I needed to ask you if you’d watch Ted this weekend. I have business to attend to.’ Draco was surprised by how formal he sounded. It reminded him of his father, and not in a nice way.
‘I won’t ask you again, Oliver. What do you want?’ Wood started trailing kisses down Harry’s neck and Draco thought he might be sick.
‘Oh no Draco dear, I have this all under control. Thank you for asking though, it’s more than that lot out there do. I suppose if you wanted to be really helpful you could coax Arthur out of that blooming shed of his. I dread to think what he’s doing in there this time…’
“Are you going to make me say it?” The way Draco’s lips moved as he enunciated every syllable was mesmerising; they were full and the perfect shade of dusky pink.
Blinking into the blaring sunlight until his eyes adjusted, he glanced around to find no sign of the silver fox anywhere in the room besides the bed he had transfigured the night before, which was crumpled and covered in white hairs. It was mercifully intact, unlike the curtains, which was a significant relief.
? Is this all a game to you? Play with my feelings and then what, rob me for all I’m worth? Sell me out? I’m really fucking curious because you can’t possibly have just forgotten about this, Mr
Potter’s birthday. How hadn’t he realised? He grabbed for the cover sheet even though the lightening was gone. It made it hard to read the small newspaper print, however even in the dimmest of lights he would have been able to make out the headline:
‘Take your time, love. There’s no rush. I’m here.’ Harry went to pull away, but Draco held him closer. He needed him or he wouldn’t get through it.
When he returned to the drawing room his friends weren’t there, but he quickly found them in the sitting room across the hall that was much smaller and cosier. They had ordered tea from the house elves and were sitting in an almost perfect circle waiting for him. It was strange seeing them all together, and even stranger having so many people in the Manor at once. If his mother were here, she’d have been ecstatic.
Harry only saw Ron first thing in the morning. He was noticeably absent in the evenings and never appeared during the weekend. It was strange that it never occurred to Harry to ask him what he was up to until after Ron had already left for work; doing a job Harry couldn’t remember and felt too embarrassed to ask. If it weren’t for Aspen keeping him very busy, Harry probably would have been suspicious.
‘It’s quite likely when you think about it.’ She looked as though she was searching his expression for some sort of agreement, but she wouldn’t find one. She sighed heavily and began adjusting the mess on top of her desk. ‘I have some friends who are in the medical profession. Researchers, not healers though. I can ask around if you’re nervous?’ He nodded enthusiastically.
‘Thank you,’ he said breathlessly when they pulled away. ‘You’ve been nothing but good to me through all of this and I’ve been a total shit to you sometimes.’
‘After you came back.’ Draco’s heart sank to the floor. He didn’t know what he had expected. He’d been the one to bring it up. He could’ve ignored it, pretending he’d not seen anything, but he wouldn’t be made a fool of. He slipped the ring off his finger and closed the gap between them. He took Harry’s hand and dropped it into his open palm.
He ripped open a particularly thick cream envelope and after flicking his eyes over the first page, Draco noticed that his hands began to tremble. He set the hot chocolate down on the natural wood surface. They’d taken to occupying the small apartment at the top of the building when they came on their own, although they planned on having the entire family over for Christmas this year – Draco was very excited even if it was months away.
Is there anything outside of this? He can’t see a way out, there’s nothing to see at all. Should he wait for the pain to go away or should he let it take him. He isn’t sure. Keeping track of time had never been his strong suit anyway.
‘The stories are always better when you read them.’ She stopped and looked around the messy room. ‘I tried to stop it, but I don’t know how.’ He eyes glittered with tears and he could see she didn’t understand what had happened.
But he wasn’t going to worry about that now. He was going to the aspen trees to clear his head. It was beautifully sunny that afternoon, and the dappled shade of the tall trees was a welcome relief for his pale skin. What he came to do here most often was to work on his animagus form. Granger had managed to smuggle him the potions ingredients he had needed to brew the potion which prepared his body to transform. It had been a nightmare to brew, but now that he had done it there were just two hurdles left. The first of which, was to figure out what form he was going to take.
He needn’t have worried. He’d only been walking five minutes when someone apparated right in front of him, blocking his path. They were facing the wrong way, but Draco would know that hair anywhere.
‘I need to rest for a bit. I’m sorry, but I can’t concentrate right now. Let me sleep for an hour and then we can talk? You can explore a little while I’m gone if you want.’ Draco stood up slowly, checking he wouldn’t make himself dizzy. Harry was on his feet in an instant too.
“I have no idea what you’re trying to say to me,” she said. “But I’m going to assume it’s something about how honoured you are to meet me. You’re welcome.” Harry snorted and Malfoy glared at him, but the fox seemed very amused.
For just a moment he wondered what it would be like to love Malfoy and to be loved by her. Until then he’d never thought of her as the kind of person someone loved. Not because she was unlovable, but because he’d rarely ever thought of her as a real person with real feelings and a real ability to care. Seeing her moved by the music made it hard to believe this was the same person he associated with ignorance, intolerance, and Death Eaters.
‘Oh for crying out loud, Draco. Get over yourself. We need to talk about that kiss and if you think I’m going to let those potions go, you’ve got another thing coming.’ Harry was leaning menacingly on his desk the same way Draco had done when he’d needed to bully the Minister’s secretary.
“He doesn’t look so sure.” Harry worried. It wasn’t as though he could think of a better name. Naming things wasn’t exact his forte.
‘He thinks you’re in France anyway. It would kind of ruin the surprise if you showed up right there on the platform. You know how much he loves surprises, remember that time we…’ Draco tuned out as Harry started talking about all the times they’d surprised Teddy. He leant his head against the shower wall and tried to ignore the pain in his chest. He was so bloody stupid. Of course things hadn’t changed. Just because he was home and they were working things out didn’t mean the past three years didn’t happen. Teddy was Harry’s godson. Draco might be related by blood but being honest the family feud ran so deep Nymphadora would have hated Draco being anywhere near her son.
He took a deep breath and started to explain. He started with the evening he and Ron had returned from the pub after watching Lyra sing and finding Aspen in their flat. Lyra flushed as she remembered how they had looked at each other that night and Ron nodded along vigorously at the bits he remembered.
Harry heaved a sigh as he sat down on the sofa with Draco and pulled Draco’s legs onto his lap as if they’d been doing this every day for six years instead of having been divorced.
Thankfully Spungen had had the foresight to supply a spare pair of Draco’s reading glasses since he hadn’t thought the bring any with him.
“Hey, Potter. POTTER!” Harry turned in the corridor on his way to Transfiguration. Draco was at the far end of the corridor, leaning languidly against the stone wall, his face cold and indifferent, as if he owned the place.
There was nothing, but there was pain. It was like he’d been thrown into the fiery pits of hell and left to burn out. White hot lances of pain whipped at him from all angles and he imagined this must be what it was like when a star died.
‘You’ll be able to when you’re older. You haven’t learnt how to channel your power enough yet.’ Teddy placed the star on the highest point and Harry let him down again. Teddy had seemed lighter since their little chat, although Draco felt like he was watching him, waiting for something. He wasn’t wrong either
Why was his husband kissing Oliver Wood? Draco walked away from his mother as fast as he could without drawing too much attention to himself. He hurried around the circumference of the pond until he was standing right behind Wood, who was still sticking his tongue down Draco’s husband’s throat. He tapped politely on Wood’s shoulder and the two broke apart. He briefly saw Harry’s look of surprise before he took a swing at Wood’s annoying face.
He was so unbelievably tired of thinking all the time and getting absolutely nothing done. He should be out there, using every spare moment to find Potter, to bring him home, to explain everything and right his wrongs. But instead, he was stuck in the dark, wasting away when he might be the only one who could fix things.
Draco sat back in his chair with a frown on his face. That had been one hell of a whirlwind, so much so that he couldn’t decide if Granger was on his side or just trying to goad him. His head hurt from all the thinking he’d just done and weirdly enough he was quite ready to go back to his cell and sleep some more.
‘Don’t be ridiculous. T’as une miette.’ He motioned for Harry to come closer and he swiped the crumb from the side of his lips. Of course, he couldn’t possibly do so without stealing a kiss or two. Or three. Ok no more than three.
He hadn’t been there on mornings like this when Draco’s defences were lowered, though. He’d missed that.
‘Yes, that’s what I came to talk to you about.’ The healer interrupted. ‘We’re willing to let you leave, Mr Potter, as there is very little we can do here; your tests all came back clear. You’re going to have to be patient and wait for your magic to return slowly. It’ll be a very slow process and we’re not sure how much of your magical ability will ever fully return, but that’s a bridge we can cross when we come to it. For now, it’s all about physical rehabilitation. You haven’t moved in weeks and it’s likely you’ll have some muscular degeneration.’ Draco felt like he’d been slapped in the face.
‘Actually, if I’m home for the weekend, do you think we could go to Kew Gardens? It’s ok if we can’t, it’s just I was talking to Neville and he said there are some really cool magical plants hidden in the regular ones if you know where to look.’ Draco appreciated Teddy’s interest in Herbology, he really did, but the second he mentioned Kew Gardens, every muscle in his body froze. He had that dream. Harry and Wood and his mother…
‘Ella, I know you’ve missed him, but would you mind if I borrowed Draco for a few minutes?” He asked her politely. Draco always thought it was cute the way Harry spoke to kids almost the same way he would speak to adults, he always managed to make them feel important. Ella pursed her lips again.
Draco shot bolt upright and regretted it instantly. His limbs had seized while he slept, and his neck had a crick in it from being slumped against his chest. The urge to sneeze had developed into a tight chest and sore throat, and he wanted more than anything to be back at home in the comfort and warmth his own bed. Except this was the bed he made, and it was the one he would have to lie in.
“Right. Well, uh, I guess I should leave you to it?” Harry would have made to leave but he knows he has no chance of finding the room they had tea in where his outer robes were left. He glances at Malfoy and he seems a little deflated – his shoulders are slumped in a way they definitely weren’t before.
Harry tries valiantly to reason with Draco. “Draco stop, please. You’re making me feel sick with all this to-ing and fro-ing. Please sit down. Pacing like that isn’t going to bring him home any sooner.”
‘We’re going out, Teddy’s going to stay with Ron and Hermione for the night. No more questions, go.’ Harry left him standing there bewildered as he spoke to Teddy about going to his aunt and uncles. Draco was slightly concerned, Harry had spent so much time working recently, getting everything up and running, that he hadn’t spent much time with Teddy in the week he’d been back. Christmas was just days away, and Teddy wouldn’t be home for long. Still, he was intrigued. He and Harry hadn’t been many places at all, being worried a headline would appear somewhere and kick up yet more fuss they didn’t want.
‘Well yeah, people don’t just have their magical cores severed just because they caught a common cold or had a bad night’s sleep. They have to be tampered with in some way.’
‘Ok,’ he said eventually, a smile cracking across his face. Draco couldn’t help himself, not that he needed to. He pulled Harry forward and kissed him gently. He’d been making a more concerted effort to show Harry how much he loved him, knowing he often forgot to. Harry was the kind of person who would never ask.
‘Draco? Are you ok? That tea must be scalding! You didn’t even put milk in it. Shit, it’s burning you.’ Draco felt’s Harry’s magic crackle over his skin but he stayed staring straight ahead, as if he wasn’t really there. Harry’s voice disappeared into the background and the world blurred around him. He could feel Harry’s hands on his cheeks, was vaguely aware of his face right in front of his own, but it was as though he was watching on as someone else.
‘A puppy.’ Teddy said finally, ‘but not a crup, just a regular puppy. I think they’re cute and I’ve never had a pet before. Well, except Eltanin, but he’s not really that sort of pet. I talk to him though…sometimes.’ Draco wasn’t sure what response he’d expected, but it wasn’t that. He shrugged.
“Thank you, Potter. It’s good to know that a thousand years of my family’s collection is up to your impeccable standards.” Harry doesn’t know why Malfoy has to be so acerbic all the time, but he can’t afford to let this opportunity pass.
of all things. And the hair that is pulled back from his face is actually neatly plaited down the back.
“Um, no, I suppose not,” he muttered dazedly. He was too distracted by Draco’s tongue and long fingers to put up much resistance.
The snug was much warmer than the outside air, much to Draco’s relief. He cast a quick incendio at the wood fire and it roared to life. He swaddled himself in one of his many blankets and curled up on the sofa. He watched the fire crackle and spit for a few minutes before turning his attention to the climbing plants. They were starting to die off again – he really needed to stop coming when the gardens weren’t in full bloom. He’d finished half of his hot chocolate by the time Harry returned looking flushed and downright terrified.
The same wave of irritation that had hit him before was back and he quashed it before he could say something he’d regret.
Draco decided to make himself some coffee, figuring he’d never be able to get back to sleep. He couldn’t believe he’d slipped up in front of Harry after all this time. Hopefully, their lack of communication would mean it would never come up again.
‘I do love him Hermione. I want it to work out this time. I just can’t stand the idea that he might create this bloody bond again just so I can have my magic back. I want to know he’s doing it because he loves me.’
“Um… hi,” he said awkwardly, not really knowing what to do with himself. It was the middle of the night and yet they were all sitting up… waiting? Worrying? He wasn’t sure, but it also meant a lot to him that these people cared enough about him to do that.
‘I’m being careful, promise.’ He smiled at her cheekily and she opened her mouth to respond but was interrupted.
She wandered back over to Draco and planted a wet kiss on his cheek and wandered out of the room. Not before sticking her tongue out behind Harry’s back.
“It’s weird. There being another pub in the middle of Diagon, I mean. It’s always just been the Leaky,” Ron said after a while. Harry realised he had turned and was looking down the opposite end of Diagon where the buildings were shabbier. It was unrecognisable compared to how it had looked when Harry first arrived with Hagrid. The Quidditch supply shop was still there, as was the menagerie and the apothecary, but Gambol and Japes had eventually gone out of business – unable to compete with the Weasleys. Fortescue had died a few years ago and the ice cream parlour had become an artisan coffee shop which Hermione loved but Harry thought was way overpriced. Madam Malkin had moved her shop up to York where the wizard community had grown exponentially since the war, the empty building boarded up and faded.
