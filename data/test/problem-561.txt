wasn’t the one in love with him for a decade.”
Harry didn’t have the first clue what to say to any of that.
Across the way, Kyle’s drool collected into a puddle on his textbook.
“Draco,”
“Hi, is Lav not here?” he asked.
“No,” Harry said aloud.
"It's alright Hermione," Harry interrupted. "Ron obviously has a few things he wants to say to me. Might as well say them now."
Now Harry sat, back against the masonry, his eyes fixed on someone’s welcome mat just across the way.
“With Voldemort,” Harry said slowly. “In the graveyard.”
Neville scowled.
"I'm well aware," Draco replied coldly.
Pansy had been right about the press, of course. Cameras were everywhere, and the sound of so many in the audience was perhaps even more deafening than it was the first time Harry had done this. He appreciated Greg and Vince keeping everyone at arm’s length, he was nervous enough without everyone clustering around him. But, inevitably, they all had to deposit him with the other champions and leave him alone.
"Go away," Draco replied.
this was actually the most emotional chapter for me to write so far and I’m really happy with it. Harry Potter deserves nice things because I said so
Draco sigh and then mumbled something.
"So it really wasn't on purpose than?" Blaise asked, sounding fascinated.
“This happens every year, Harry,” Cosima told him. “There doesn’t need to be an announcement because most everyone already knows, and there’s not going to be a search because she won’t be found.”
. Which he had known. He stood, ignoring the looks his Housemates gave him along with those of the entire Great Hall. The only person who's eyes he met was Harry. There was a question there, of course, but he couldn't answer it just now. Merlin only knew what was about to happen.
It was the wrong thing to say, apparently. Malfoy stepped in close, eyes flashing at the challenge in Harry’s tone. “I must say it’s a shame Granger doesn’t go to this school,” he taunted.
The moment broke when five sets of hands started clapping. The two boys untangled themselves instantly; Harry could feel the tips of his ears burning.
Lucius’s jaw flexed. “I am simply trying to... improve things between us.”
Harry couldn’t quite keep the bitterness from his tone at that. Once again, someone in his head set on controlling him.
Draco smiled. "You're sure you wouldn't like to discuss how Harry and I are going to pull one over on Snape?"
Potter looked up at him in surprise. "Malfoy?"
“Why, indeed,” Ophelia said, sardonic.
"Yeah I did," Malfoy said when he finished. "And then you sent a—" he broke off to laugh again. "—patronus at us. Greg nearly wet himself. If I'd had the nerve, I would have thanked you just for that."
Several seconds went by in which that did not happen. Fed up, Harry decided to just start talking. Draco couldn’t ignore him forever, after all.
With what Harry recognised as no small amount of irony, he found the blond in the restroom—standing in front of the mirror, his back to Harry. His black jacket was discarded on the ground, his dress shirt a bit loose. When they locked gazes in the mirror, Harry was hit with such a wave of deja vu, it was almost unsettling.
The last thing Harry wanted to talk about at the moment was Dudley Dursley. He mentally cursed himself for bringing the piglet of a boy up. He hadn’t considered that Draco would ask questions, which was unbelievably dim in retrospect. “You could say that.”
meant
Harry looked at Ginny, her tone setting off distant alarm bells in his head. When Hermione’s jaw tightened, almost imperceptibly, his brow furrowed. It almost seemed like they…
The woman shook her just so, enough to show that she was at just as much of a loss. “I haven’t the faintest. I thought one of us would have been attacked by now.”
help him.
He had tried to describe this to Sheila, and an extrospective look had come over her face.
"Probably a good idea to stop calling his best mate a weasel too," Blaise pointed out.
Ron's eyebrows knit together as he glanced between them. "Which is it?"
She’d moved so fast, then, that Harry felt the sharp stinging in his cheek almost before he’d put together that he’d been slapped. He stared at Lavender, wide eyed.
“You never asked why I had it tattooed. Why I’d make it stand out
Harry smiled wryly. “I’m sure she said enough to get the point across.”
“Because of you, actually,” she replied, taking him by surprise again.
Draco smiled, slowly shaking his head. "Gods, I love you."
what Harry had said. Draco couldn’t think of anything that would have been worse.
Draco had been waiting as close to the maze as possible, so he could immediately follow after the first polyjuiced Champion that came by. As it happened, it ended up being Fleur. He trailed her—at least he was assuming the Auror was actually a her—all the way to her position, and waited anxiously for the task to begin.
"Agreed," said Pansy. "We've hardly done anything yet."
“Get out.”
"If you regret this in the morning," said Potter at last, "it's not on me."
(Very sorry, ao3 hates me and won't let me embed working links).
"Bite your lip like that. Do you know how often you bite or lick your lips in classes? Because trust me Potter, I do."
Harry laughed, delighted. “You better tell him that,” he ordered, “just the way you said it. He’ll love it.”
Ayesha’s
The Slytherin swallowed. “It’s um... it’s from my mum. She said—I need to go find Harry.”
of you!"
As usual, Harry had not moved since Hermione left. Neither had Narcissa, though she never moved much at all. Which was why Harry was surprised to see her suddenly look up at the doorway and then rise. When Harry turned and met Dumbledore’s eyes, it made sense.
Harry shrugged his shoulders, unsure how to reply.
” Draco demanded the next day, just after Harry had sent off the letter to his godfather. He had saved telling Draco about Sirius for last for this very reason.
Blaise was, admittedly, shocked. Mostly at the timing, though. He and Neville had been eyeing each other since their Hogwarts days, after all. But he hadn’t imagined that Nev would admit that any time soon, much less in the middle of a wedding reception.
"Nice pyjamas," Harry said a moment later, standing at the foot of Draco's bed.
“What?” Draco prodded after another moment of silence. “You’ve an idea, what is it?”
Moments after he’d entered, it became eerily silent. Turning, Draco realised this was because the hedges had somehow blocked out the roar of the crowd as it closed them in. The Auror had already taken off, her wand out in front of her in preparation for any unknown threat, and Draco chased after her. He let Harry’s cloak fall from his shoulders as he did so, given that it was no longer necessary and would only slow him down.
Draco thought in Not Fleur’s direction,
Draco sighed and they both brought the girl along to shore, where she promptly got her footing, gave a small shout and plowed into Fleur's waiting arms. Harry could hear Fleur explaining about being attacked by grindylows and being forced to turn back, but Harry chose to address Draco rolling his eyes at him instead.
“Isn’t that who he—”
Judging by the look on Draco’s face, though, he had just realised that Harry hadn’t truly remembered the other man well. The blond looked as though he’d just confirmed something for himself, and was disappointed about it.
Hermione looked up at him sharply, her shock must have been written all over her face. “Lucky that Draco could die?”
"That's where you're wrong Potter, I never hated you."
He was facing them again, his eyes disappointed at their bickering. They both lapsed into silence again, sullen.
“Are you… are you seriously asking me if I want you to murder my aunt?”
Harry just looked at him, waiting patiently for an answer.
At first, Harry thought it was Lucius. But no, a glance around revealed Lucius in the opposite direction—mask off and firing curses at another masked Death Eater. Close by him was the Auror who had taken Fleur’s place, a giant dead snake at her feet and a jet of red coming from the tip of the wand in her grasp.
feelings?” asked Malfoy. “I thought he was the one who didn’t… er, fancy the other bloke.”
Harry admittedly didn’t have much of a plan beyond this point. He was hoping to avoid having the
"The more you say it, the stranger it sounds."
Lucius didn’t meet his eyes. “I was unsure you’d want me there.”
"You're acting like he meant it!" Harry exclaimed.
“I’m going to try. But how am I supposed to get my hands on it?” he said. “Not like Harry’s going to just hand it over to me.”
Neville cracked a smile. “I used to think you were like that,” he told Harry, thoughtful. “Now I reckon you’re probably the only person outside my family who gives a damn about me as, like, a person.”
She smirked a bit and then pointed. “You see that girl down there to the left of Matt? Dark red hair? Purple uniform?”
Pawns indeed, Harry thought. But not for long.
Harry blinked. "I should be asking you that, I think."
Neville sighed, but didn’t back down. In the past, Hermione thought he would have—or likely would have never said what he had in the first place. But Neville’s confidence had increased ever since Blaise snapped his wand in half accidentally (on purpose). Hermione had her theories, but they weren’t important just then.
Not bloody likely. You’re a fucking wanker. I have exhausted myself trying to make some semblance of a life out of your damnable mess!
He had no real expertise with media— discounting years of harassment. And he couldn’t owl Lavender and ask, because—agreement to help Harry or no—he still couldn’t be sure where she stood when it came to Skeeter and the
When Draco and Harry went back to Hogwarts that Monday, the school went into upheaval. Absolutely everyone was all over the both of them. Draco was constantly torn between being touched at the widespread concern and annoyed at the constant attention. He’d even caught nearly all of his Professors staring at him during their lectures. It was somewhat irritating, given that he already had two weeks of coursework to worrying about catching up on.
Hermione broke off, staring down at the hand she could of sworn had just squeezed hers. For a moment, she held her breath. Then Draco’s hand moved again, and her eyes snapped back to his face.
"I don't know! That's what I don't understand!"
One in particular that stood out but never made the cut: the day Ayesha told Harry she was pregnant with a boy and was going to name him after their dad. It was really tragic because Aya knew Harry still wanted to have a family someday deep down, and Harry did about as well as you’d think with the news. But it ended up that there was just never a good place to put it, really, and I thought there was more than enough melancholy memories in the fic already. So I figured I’d put that tidbit in the notes for you lot. And since it’s not strictly part of the fic, you can take or leave.
“Being strong enough, I guess. If you had—” He cut himself off, and Draco felt him take another breath. “I can’t lose you.”
Draco rolled his eyes. That hardly mattered. "A fair bit," he admitted. "Will you dance with me or not?"
“Not as if you like to talk about yours,” Harry deflected.
She waved him off. "It's alright. I should go back to the tower for clothes and a shower."
His sister had evidently been satisfied with that response, though, because she didn’t seem to notice anything amiss. Her eyes were busy scanning the quidditch stands for a place to sit. She must have found one, because she gestured for Harry to follow her up. The majority of the crowd were students, with only a few adults—probably mostly faculty—scattered within. Harry was eventually caught up in his surroundings. The closer to the start of the match, the more students filled the stands. It was clear there were significantly more than there’d been when Harry had gone to Hogwarts, in the other world. There was also the nostalgia of watching quidditch, hoping your house would win out.
Hermione stalked up to him in the midst of it all. Displeasure laced her every feature—and what only a select few who knew her, like Harry still did, as guilt.
"Don't worry Harry, everyone sports a crush on Diggory at one point or another," Pansy soothed. "You were just enamored by his pretty face like all the rest of us, Draco included."
in his head. And they were talking to him. Threatening him. It was like a long-ago nightmare had resurfaced and then come to life in its vengeance.
She’d been his friend too. Harim’s.
Guilt settled in his bones along with the certainty that he’d just lost something very important. Thrown it away, more like. And he couldn’t even blame his alter ego this time, bastard that he was.
The blond opened his mouth, but then snapped it shut. Harry had fully expected him to say something like,
Blaise turned to look at him when he’d finished, a brilliant smile on his face. Maybe he really did get a rush from this stuff, Neville thought. The dark skinned boy was clearly missing a few screws, so why was Neville smiling back? He shook his head to clear it. “Come on, let’s get out of here before we get caught.”
tipped him off."
And then the little girl was back, giving him a hug and telling him thank you. Fleur was waiting when her sister pulled away.
He started to turn away, but Malfoy reached out and gripped Harry's arm. The strangest sensation snaked through him at the contact, and he froze in place.
“Are we friends, Malfoy?” Weasley asked abruptly.
"He told us you asked him to Yule Ball, you know," Hermione said conversationally.
and couldn’t do magic anymore,” Maria informed him.
Harry had promised he’d go wherever it was today, and now Ayesha thought he’d only been lying, which must have been terribly in character for him.
"You could have just walked by and minded your own business," he pointed out.
"Something awful, yeah," Harry said.
Draco’s smile dropped. He didn’t bother to reply.
It was Ron who was the first to point out that Draco wasn’t actually wounded, and therefore didn’t really need to remain on his hospital bed. The Healers came in and ran a few tests, confirmed that he was fine and told him he was free to go.
"If you must know," she began, "I was ten. We lived across from this other family’s flat, and I told my mum I wanted to give their daughter a kiss on the lips. My mum said
. Draco could remember everything now, everything that been scratching at the back of his mind for Merlin only knew how long. He’d spent what felt like ages firmly believing that the hell he had dropped into was reality before he’d begun to sense something was truly off. After he’d realised that, it had become a challenge of endurance, seeing how long it would go on before—well, he’d assumed he’d die at some point. He never imagined that he would come out of it alive. He hadn’t even been able to remember what
Harry’s gut twisted a bit at the statement. Draco was having a difficult time with his father as of late, but up until fairly recently he’d always been doted on. Adored and given everything he’d asked for, even. Of course he couldn’t understand why Harry’s own blood would hate him. Still, even knowing this, Harry’s words came out slightly sharper than he’d intended at first. “No. They’re my relatives. Family doesn’t do... what they do,” he finished a bit lamely.
“Oh, Cos,” said Maria, “I’m so sorry.”
Harry looked up, hoping the question in his eyes would be interpreted the way he hoped—and not as total ignorance.
I really loved writing this chapter. Neville and Lavender will be main characters in this, because I love them and I say so. As always I’d love to know your guy’s thoughts.
Harry didn’t have a chance to ask directly what she’d said before Clark arrived, a crate hovering above her head as she passed the crowd of students and they began to follow her towards the woods.
"Right yes, how could I forget the millionth time you rejected me," said Malfoy.
But Harry appeared gobsmacked. "Really?" he breathed.
“Would you look at that,” Not Diggory said when the information sunk in, “the kid’s useful.”
Draco huffed a small laugh. “Interesting. I take it you don’t get along then?”
The Slytherin blinked, so thrown by the question that the answer came out honest. “I think we are. Er, right?”
I’ll not have you beating yourself up about this.”
The other boy nodded.
The next minute, Draco’s parents were stepping out of the fireplace. There was a silent, stretched out moment in which everyone eyed each other. Or, a moment in which Draco looked at anyone besides his father.
,” Harry said automatically, and then nearly tripped over his own feet in shock. It was one thing to understand when
“You can tell me what it is you came for on the way out,” said Hermione, and brooked no argument.
Harry shook off his thoughts and stood still as the Aurors put traces on him as well as themselves. It was, he was told, essential for all the other Aurors involved to be able to track where everyone was during the task. Harry was to be placed with an Auror named Timothy Reid on the northern edge, just outside the maze.
Harry looked morosely at his plate, still half full. He’d not even got to start on his eggs.
Draco swallowed. "And are you?"
There was an answer to that, one that a few minutes ago, he’d thought himself prepared to give. But now—it was the way Draco said the words that made Harry pause. He had spoken as though that was something he’d been waiting to ask for some time, not something that had only just come to mind and been blurted out.
Draco turned to face him, releasing a small breath. “I’m sorry,” he said quietly.
liked
Harry, who’s head was on Draco’s chest at the time, looked up at him through his lashes. Draco realised he’d likely been nearly asleep.
your son anything, Lucius, is myself. You, on the other hand, will exit the grounds of Hogwarts immediately. And you will not speak to Draco in person unless either myself or the Headmaster is present."
Harry shrugged, and gave him a half smile. "Something more important than sleep came up." He made his way over to Draco's bed and sat at the foot of it. His boyfriend's arm was thrown over his stomach, white-blond hair spilled on his sheets. He looked so peaceful, Harry suddenly wasn't in a rush to get him up. He loved seeing Draco's expression so open and relaxed, and all his problems would still be there in the morning after all. Before he'd even realised it, he'd reached out his hand and stroked through Draco's locks.
Neville laughed, eyeing Ron on the sofa across from him. “I think she might be trying to tell you something mate.”
“Even though I’m a shirtlifting blood-traitor?” Draco deadpanned.
Matt gave Draco a look that made plain exactly what he thought about that, then said, “So what now?”
“Then I must be dead.”
The blond boy stared at her for a moment, before collapsing back into the chair. "Bollocks."
“He said he needed your help with something,” Ginny put in, just the slightest bit too flippant. “Figured we weren’t exactly busy here, so you wouldn’t mind.”
Draco rolled his eyes. "Oh please. He's the bloody Saviour. He could find a date the day of in the space of time it takes him to walk from his dormitories to the Great Hall."
The blond blinked. “What else was I supposed to do?”
“Potter is a menace,” responded Malfoy, and Harry grimaced.
It took long seconds for Harry to work out how to even close his mouth. And by that point Lavender had already turned her back, marched towards her bedroom, and slammed the door behind her so hard the dust on the fireplace mantel shifted.

Hermione rolled her eyes as she sat, Luna planting herself right between Pansy and Harry and Neville taking a hesitant seat in the middle of Hermione and Draco.
Near periods end, Hermione wanted to strangle Malfoy more than ever. Or Harry, or Ron, or everyone in the entirety of Hogwarts—including, perhaps, herself—because no one had bloody

“I don’t care,” Harry cut her off immediately, resolute. “I’m not risking that again. For my little brother, yeah, but not for the sake of- self-improvement, or whatever you think it's going to accomplish. Besides, he’s not even here right now anyway.”
"Draco?" Harry asked when he realised the blond was not truly listening anymore.
"But—yeah okay." He apparently didn't have the energy to protest, as he laid back down in the next second and slid over some to give Harry space. Usually, if he slept here, Harry would transfigure a bed for himself or borrow a space from one of the handful of Slytherins who nodded off in the common room or elsewhere, but tonight he didn't want to.
All the while, Malfoy looked blank, as though, for him, time had simply stopped. Like he couldn’t quite manage to form thoughts, let alone words.
Blaise made a noncommittal gesture, but Pansy snapped, "Why shouldn't we?"
Neville laughed again but didn’t deny the charge as they both took their seats.
"Don't—" he started, but the girl was already reading. Draco sighed, cold already settled over him, and watched her eyes dart across the page and read the words it'd only taken him twice to memorise.
Miss Granger! Thirty more points from Gryffindor House! There is no fixing such a disgraceful muck up. Now be quiet and do as you are told!”
"Don't talk about my father you—"
Harry blinked. “Well, yeah.”
“Are you sure…” Harry questioned, rather against his own interests.
Sheila blinked at him. Harry saw the exact moment she realised he was completely serious, and the gravity sunk in. She sat up straighter, crossed her legs. “I think, Harry,” she said carefully, “that the best thing I can do to help you today is listen.”
peep the unexpected careers tag lol
Celine pursed her lips a moment, and then forced a small smile for him. “Thanks, Ed.”
“But that’s
“Helloooooo. Earth to Draco?”
"Ronald," Hermione began, in a tone that suggested she'd already given this particular lecture.
Harry loosed a breath. “Apparently we’ve got to go see Dumbledore.”
," Harry didn't miss the double meaning, "he should have prevented this."
Anxiousness was curling tighter in her stomach with every minute that went by. “I realise the irony of me asking this, to you of all people, but you don’t think I’m too young do you?”
This chapter is brought to you by that timeless classic: Complicated by Avril Lavigne.
The walk to the nurse was a silent one, both of them still tense and angry. Their injuries turned out not to be all that severe; they really hadn’t had much time to inflict damage earlier. They were eventually released in time for lunch.
“You have no idea,” responded Harry. “Now look. I want to make it clear that I’m not trying to threaten you. I’m not going to do anything and I won’t tell anyone, I swear. I’m just here to warn you.”
below us,” she hissed. “And I didn't ask for your approval, funnily enough."
Narcissa took a single step forward. “He is, has always been, and always will be
"Mr. Malfoy, something you would like to share with the class?" Professor Flitwick inquired, apparently at the end of his patience with the two boys having a discussion during his lesson.
Hermione didn’t say another word, but Draco could tell she was extremely pleased to have been taken seriously. He was rather proud of her, especially if this kept Harry out of danger.
And Draco blissfully lost count until, "Bloody hell, why must I always be the one to witness your every ridiculously sappy act?" Blaise's voice rang through the dorm room. "I am a gods-damned creature of the night!"
Ron finally exploded that night. Harry came back to the common room, having been gone for the past four or so hours—Draco was really a fantastic kisser, and he'd simply lost track of time—looking visibly disheveled. Hermione looked up from the book she'd been reading and gave a sly smile when she'd caught sight of him. But Ron, who had been playing exploding snap with Neville, gaped at him.
she told him.
"You are foul," the man was saying. "I can't even bear to look at you!"
A voice in his head that sounded suspiciously like Hermione asked him what in the everloving hell he was doing, but he ignored it. If Harry got to toss himself into dangerous situations for the sake of protecting everyone under the bloody sun, then he had every right to do so to protect Harry.
"He asked you to take a
felt for Draco was friendship. Or, at the very least, that the affection he felt for Draco was not at all a product of Harim’s.
“Thank Merlin,” she said exaggeratedly, learning foeward on the armrest. “Tell me everything.”
Horror was steadily spreading; the more his—Harim’s voice echoed through his head, the more panicked Harry became. This was, he thought, exactly what he’d feared all this time.
“You would sort of be out of a job,” Neville pointed out. “If you’re wrong about me.”
The delicate hands vanished abruptly, as though scalded.
Harry could only roll his eyes.
He read it twice through, and then dropped it onto the table. He could feel Hermione's concerned gaze on him, but he did not meet her eyes. Seconds later, though, the letter was snatched and in her hands.
When classes finally released for the day, Harry and Malfoy practically raced each other to the pitch. Joshua, Cosima, Maria, and Celine were all there to support them, even though these tryouts had far less fanfare.
“Glad to hear it,” the man said, setting his things on his desk and turning to the rest of the class with a smile of his own. “Good morning students. I figured we could use a more laid back day, today, so I’m sure everyone can guess what we’re talking about?”
So they were here for quidditch, Harry realised. That made sense; his brother would be Hogwarts age now certainly. Ayesha agreed, and then they were walking onto the grounds.
Pansy giggled at Harry's side, and Harry trained his eyes on the girl. "Is he really jealous?"
"Yeah, well, that was then. I didn't know you then."
of sticking your neck out like this.”
“Little Cordelia Gray,” she answered sadly. “She was the one who got her pick of Houses yesterday, hadn’t happened in like forever. And a Nomaj-born, too.”
"Talking about me?" Draco's groggy voice inquired, his lips turning up softly as his eyes slowly opened. It might of been the most endearing thing Harry'd ever seen.
Harry jerked violently—banging his head against the wall behind him in a most unfortunate manner. The pain barely registered, though. There wasn’t room for anything but his shock.
"Alright, he's not staring, really," Draco allowed, as the Hufflepuff had looked away for possibly the fourth time. "But he's putting me on edge."
“Huh?” he said dumbly.
"I made you choose," Ron finished for him.
Harry beamed.
Neville nodded. "Can I come too?"
"I just," he paused, scratching his neck. "Look I know that I was kind of... I mean what I'm trying to say is that I'm sorry. You were right when you said I never really knew what I was saying—about blood and such I mean. I said some foul things and I probably still sometimes think a few things you might not completely agree with because of my family—look, you're not at all how I thought you'd be. I can see why Harry puts so much stock in everything you say, and clearly you wouldn't abandon him like the w– Anyway, I just wanted you to know that I'm sorry is all."
“But now she’s actually trying to endanger people!” Celine protested. “I just never thought it’d get this bad.”
Harry groused, mimicking the old director’s overly stressed accent. “I can’t even begin to imagine the reaction that’s going to get. Alfie came up with Catatonic Howlers back in the day, he’s going to be upset and probably blame me. I can already hear it now. ‘Everything was fine until

"How about telling us what colour you
They both seemed to notice at the same time, breaking apart in the next moment. Draco’s face was flushed Harry’s favourite sort of pink, the pupils still blown and grey retreated to the outer ring. Harry knew he was in virtually the same state, half-hard cock and all. Apparently neither of them knew what to say. Draco ran a hand through his hair and gripped a bit before releasing it. Harry had had plenty of time to note it as a habit of frustration or nervousness.
“What else then,” she pressed, making a go-on gesture with her arm.
"Indeed. Five points from Slytherin for allowing this Mr. Malfoy," Snape said, and turned away.
And for once Draco could see no reason he shouldn't do what he wanted to do. He had crossed the room practically before he'd even decided.
he reminded himself the next moment. Knowing that didn’t calm him nearly enough, however, as he was still bewildered. He didn’t appear to be the only one, as Not Harry chose that moment to notice Auror Fleur and ask, “What do we do?”
She was Hermione, somewhere deep down, surely. Different world or no, it was something Harry was beginning to need to believe.
to die either!"
"Rejected y–!"
“Your entire argument is mucked up from the start even,” he barrelled on, “because purebloods are a part of the reason there are so few of us in the first place. Maybe muggles wouldn’t outnumber us by so much if half of us weren’t so set on keeping magic for themselves that they saw no issue with practices like inbreeding. And don’t bother denying it; I know you’ve not forgotten who my godfather is. So which is it, Malfoy?” he asked. “You hate muggles because they outnumber us, in which case you might think about not being so openly proud of your bloodline, to say the least. Re-evaluate some of those philosophies, I’d think. Or you hate them because they haven’t got any magic, meaning you hating muggleborns is nonsense.
"Did you read the article?" Draco asked.
"More than. I wouldn't have even known to think along those lines if he hadn't said something. This is it, Harry's going to do fine. Merlin it's like I can breathe again... er no pun intended."
He knew her, ergo she must be meant to know him. The assumption suited Harry perfectly, and he might have pressed the advantage and questioned her about where to find someone more useful, but it was only a few seconds later that someone joined them. An intensely familiar voice had called out after the little girl, and then Ginny was standing behind Victoire, just inside the door, saying “oh, can I help you?”
Draco’s back straightened, tense. There was no telling how this would go, and there was no one around to save him from the moment.
When Harry stopped, the resulting silence stretched so long that Harry found himself holding his breath to keep it from shattering. His mind was racing, ardently picking apart every statement he’d just made. He recognised that he’d actually taken a fair few of his words from Sirius. His godfather rarely spoke of his family life growing up, but, whenever he started in, it was obvious their prejudices were still a sore spot. Harry hadn’t realised until now how much he’d actually retained from the older man’s ranting.
“Oh Neville,” said Hermione as she reached over to hug him, heartbroken for her friend. “I’m so sorry I never knew.”
Essentially, if your mind was occupied by any person that was truly other—as you and I have talked about a form of possession before, think of that—it would fragment under the strain of housing incompatible structures, especially for such a sustained period of time.
“And you are certain that it would be a

“... time with your family!”
The rush of relief at seeing Vee felt like twenty stone being lifted right off his shoulders. It meant Bill and Fluer had to be just as happy here as they’d been before Harry had changed the past.
“Warn me,” repeated Neville, wariness flashing across his face.
"You'd of been able to, no doubt," said Draco off-handedly.
Harry’s eyebrows knit together. “Uh... why?”
Blaise laughed. "Every last one," he said. "Okay maybe not every
The female Slytherin huffed, her voice returning to sharpness. "When have I ever lied to you for the sake of your ego?"
To everyone who has left a comment or a kudos on this story I appreciate every single one of you, thank you so much for giving me motivation when I had almost none left. Much love.

?!" Draco demanded hours later after leaving the great hall, both outraged and disbelieving.
“—fist fighting like a couple of cavemen!” Clark was yelling in the background. “Can’t even say I’m surprised, the two of you have been trouble since minute one!”
With the third task approaching in just days over a week, Harry had found far more comfort sleeping alongside Draco in the cool dungeons than ever before. Being with Draco at night helped keep the horrid nightmares of mazes and Death Eaters and warnings of Voldemort’s growing strength at bay, replacing it all instead with warm fantasies of green ties and slow dancing, the scent of vanilla mint and ice lingering in his dreams.
“Wow mate,” Blaise said. “That was harsh.”
He went into a spiel then about current standing, and before long the Auror who wore Krum’s face was entering the maze. Draco took a deep breath and, as soon as it opened in front of Auror Fleur, he ran inside.
Harry did not feel lonely, and he did not feel the compulsive need to be so occupied. He’d spent his time thus far contacting people about Neville, taking on an agent role, and had already gotten some inquiries. But it didn’t feel overly urgent.
“I probably shouldn’t of said that, right?” Neville sighed after a long, quiet moment. He sounded completely resigned.
The chances that Draco really would come that night were slim, Harry was well aware. For all the reasons Harry almost hadn’t invited him to begin with.
Resolved, Harry pulled himself up off the concrete and went to see some Weasleys.
“Let me ask you this then,” Draco said. “Do you honestly see yourself loving anyone else?”
Joshua nodded. “Oh yeah. Muggles still watch soccer don’t they?”
“Because you are my son, and I should not have lost sight of that.”
Harry glanced over at her fiancé—or was he her husband now?—to see him still looking altogether happy and bashful.
“It won’t be mine for much longer,” said Harry.
"Hm, you and Po–Harry are Gryffindors yeah? Fancy some truth or dare?"
Harry was all too familiar with Malfoy’s sneering at him and the like, but this felt leagues off from that. Harry internally squirmed, complicated emotions creeping through him as he worked not to shrink away, and he didn’t know why.
Harry nodded unthinkingly. “Mhm.”
Lucius’s eyebrows crinkled in anger and confusion. “Of course the boy will have to die, you must see that the Dark Lord will not stand for him to live.”
Harry allowed Malfoy to lead him silently for a few minutes before he decided to try speaking again. "So you really erm..."
“Okay?” Harry asked, letting every ounce of hope he felt bleed into the one word.
“You’re
Bellatix’s younger sister, Narcissa, had already been married off, and her other sister, Andromeda, had been disowned by Cygnus as well as was married to a muggle. Neither of them stood to inherit anything.
“Victoire!” he exclaimed happily.
Henrick, his brain took inventory of what must be Not Diggory’s real name.
The Auror shook her head, exasperated. “Unbelievable. So not only do I have to pretend to compete—and therefore actually compete—in some bloody death tournament that I didn’t sign up for, but now I’ve got to babysit while I do it? How you even got in here is another concern entirely, so much for the stellar security.”
Draco was mildly hungover, but the memories of the Ball were still clear in his mind. He'd asked for a dance, and he'd gotten that and more. He remembered every kiss vividly, and he could recall the way they'd sat, Harry resting against his shoulder as they talked for hours afterwards...
“How do you know?” That was Hermione questioning.
Maria nodded. “Understatement. They tried to say that it must’ve been, like, a freak accident. Like they’d done it to themselves or something.”
He nodded quickly. “Yeah, m’fine. Just, that was fun, is all.”
So sorry for this particular chapter—let me know how we’re all feeling lol.
“What classes do you have today?” Celine inquired lightly, steering the conversation away.
So Draco breathed through his nose, and finished his breakfast as normally as possible.
"Ask Harry again. Only this time don't be so...
. “Tell me something about you that I don’t know yet,” he said.
she said, and it was final. “It is complicated, messy—as I said, I’ve been utterly fascinated over the course of our time together. But at the end of the day, your fear and inability to reconcile with Harim is still causing you harm most unnecessary.
Pansy smiled brightly at him, Draco looked pleased. "I dare you to go steal a potion."
“Gods,” said Draco with a shake of his head. “You just really make me want to kiss you. To just… give in and fall in love with you again.”
"Were you going for extra points Gr–Hermione?" Blaise inquired, smirking.
a pleasant reminder.
Snape's jaw tightened at this. "Is Mr. Malfoy, in fact, your date Mr. Potter?" he demanded of Harry.
Hermione watched the boys leave and prayed for all their sakes that Filch wasn’t anywhere near the Astronomy tower at the moment.
He felt lighter, too.
Ron chose that exact moment to join them. Normally he was content as he always was after dinner, nothing cheered Ron so much as a good meal. But today he was clearly startled to find what looked like Harry shouting at Hermione from across the sofa.
"Because," he began, "I think I may want to kiss you, and I don't want you to wake up tomorrow and hex m–"
“Excited?” Celine asked, barely restraining her smile as she observed the two of them enthusiastically scarf down their waffles.
Lavender obviously thought along the same lines. She let out a sigh through her nose, weary. “Harry,” she said gently, “I really don’t think you should keep ignoring what I said like this. Even Dumbled—”
For several tense moments, the Slytherin only looked at them in confusion. Hermione saw the exact moment that the memory came to him. “Oh

Sirius looked up from his food again at that. “What? Oh, of course! He’s still your boyfriend isn’t he? If you trust him then I don’t see why I shouldn’t.”
back then. And either way there’s nothing you could’ve done. There’s nothing you can do
"See you around, mate," Fred said, he and George smiling full rows of teeth, one reaching out to muss Harry’s dark curls before walking off. They went in opposite direction their younger brother had gone.
“Sure,” replied Joshua. “But I think those aren’t until closer to the end of the week, though. Most wait to try out for Quidditch, usually after they find out they didn’t make their Quodpot team. And then there’s Swivenhodge tryouts on Saturday, for the losers who don’t make either. But those games aren’t much to watch.”
“A graveyard by the looks of it,” Auror Fleur said as she stood up, bringing him back to present. She reached down to help Draco stand.
“You look like someone ran over your kneazle,” was the response. “Are you even taking notes?”
Harry gave her a hard look. “To start, it’s only been a few days. And more importantly, Draco’s
“Giffie!”
Harry shook his head sharply to clear the memory, but it still stung. He hadn’t meant for any of this to happen. He didn’t care about being a hero or anything that Draco had accused him of. He was pretty sure Draco didn’t actually believe any of it either—at least he hoped he didn’t—but he also understood why he’d said what he said.
She raised her brows, her expression asking
“You okay Harry?” asked Maria, who was looking at him far too knowingly for comfort.
Harry nodded again.
Harry put the paper down and sighed, pocketing the rest of his mail to put off reading any more negativity and resting his head in his hands for a second before looking back up at his friends. Ron hadn't spoken to him since before the Ball, and Harry doubted he'd start now. Hermione, though, was eyeing him with deep concern.
then?!” he demanded, causing Harry to flinch. “How dare you! You bloody know how much I love you! I don’t matter to you more than random Aurors you’ve not even met?! I can’t—I mean how am I supposed to—you promised me!”
“Because we have magic, Potter,” the blond said, as though Harry were being particularly thick.
“I don’t know what you want me to say,” Harry told him after a minute. “I don’t understand why you’re cross with me.”
"Not technically," Draco said with a smirk. "I am bent though."
you had a right to be. And I was so stupid—”
Malfoy scoffed at him, his jaw tightening at the insult. “I should think you’d be happy,” he replied. “It’s not a Basilisk, after all.”
“Hi, Mum.”
Harry couldn’t possibly have forgotten if he’d wanted to. Draco had been absolutely distraught when Harry had collapsed in the middle of Potions. That was also the day he’d fallen into the Pensieve, and he wasn’t likely to forget anything he’d seen while in there either. “Of course, Professor.”
Draco was still looking up at the singer in clear confusion, so Harry got to witness the exact moment when he registered what was happening, and the hand in Harry’s went slack with disbelief.
Draco's eyes darted to Harry's lips for a fraction of a second, but it was enough. Unfortunately, Hermione chose that moment to remind them there was more going on just then. She stood, shivering slightly with a blanket thrown around her. "You did it Harry," she exclaimed happily, teeth chattering.
She turned a steely gaze at him, daring him to question her again and see what happened.
Neville was probably six or seven metres away when they stopped.
Parvati laughed, conceding the point. “True, but ‘he’s a complete knob’ doesn’t give me much actual information.”
Harry rolled his eyes then. "No one is dying, and certainly not me. Which reminds me, I'm to take the egg to the bath tonight."
“Yes, well.” The older man looked around awkwardly before standing. “I’ll go inform your mother and Potter that you’ve woken.”
“So you’re a better wizard than me,” he checked. “Because my mum was a muggleborn. Your magic is better, godlier.”
Again Draco tried to reply, but didn’t do so in time. “Something about you, seemed like,” Hermione answered.
“You said during the third task. I’m still a Champion,” Harry argued, as expected. He had actually raised a good point though, not that Draco would ever say so.
“I’m sure,” he said, and then downed the rest of his drink in one gulp before starting to stand.
"Yes?"
“So is it magic that makes us gods?” Harry prodded. “Or is it blood that makes
Draco appeared to be attempting to speak, and having some trouble with the task.
"All right, Harry?" Cedric asked from right next to him. He sounded downright excited, only the slightest bit of nerves evident in his voice.
"It's only eight," she protested, but it was halfhearted.
Theo’s eyes flickered away. “Yeah. He got life in Azkaban, if it makes you feel better.”
“Well,” Lavender said brightly, gifting him the opportunity to move away from his melancholy, “at least since you’ve someone else to be your faux-therapist now, I don’t have to anymore. So let’s talk about what else you’ve been doing. Catch me up.”
In the middle of the field, the grass was wild; it came up tall, Harry’s fingers grazing the tops of shifting blades as he made his way steadily toward the Burrow. The closer he got, the more he could hear. A window or several might have been open, as Harry picked up the chatter of many voices and their intermittent, easy laughter carried on the wind.
Draco started. “Cross with—what? No. Oh gods. Do you really think you’re what’s upsetting me right now?”
Alright so, on another note, I’m potentially looking for another beta reader. It’s nothing dire, I promise, but I’m considering it for just a few reasons.

Harry laid back down beside him.
“Draco,” Hermione said. “The letter.”
pain—potentially even inadvertently.”
?" Draco hissed, grabbing the nearest movable object—which in this case was the chess board Pansy and Blaise had been forced to abandon when Draco had stormed into the common room just minutes before—and hurling it towards the wall opposite.
Harry regarded him cautiously.
With a last scathing look, Lucius Malfoy left.
At one point, Draco imagined that he could hear hissing. Almost like a snake would make… exactly like a snake would make. A very large one if his imagination was to be trusted, though at the moment that was admittedly questionable.
Draco looked at him warmly. “I know,” he said simply. “Besides, he got what he deserved, if Aunt Bella’s graphic account of things is anything to go by.”
"Why didn't you tell me?! We could have knocked some sense into him!"
The worst of it, really, was that Harry had honestly wanted to believe—ridiculously—that what
said Noelle, giving Harry a soured once over, “
So he took a deep fortifying breath, ignoring all the eyes he could feel looking on sympathetically, and followed after Draco.
Draco stood up from the table. “I’ve got to speak to him.”
Typically, Harry returned to sleep—and the majority of other times had found himself various places to be, without it even being a deliberate choice to do it.
"The only one of us who will be
Draco’s horrified words cut through the silence, and his thoughts. “What did she
Pansy's eyes once again narrowed dangerously, practically daring Draco to insult the Ravenclaw again. "She's genuine and sweet. And she accepted rather happily, thank you very much.”
"It's real," Harry assured him. "I'm not going anywhere, either."
"You're mental," said Ron. "Malfoy's a bloke, and he hates Harry. He's got to be up to something. Right?"
"I'm only asking so this lot isn't tempted to," she told him.
"How was I supposed to know if you didn't tell me?" Harry moved then, coming around and sitting down next to Draco. "What did he say?"
“He’s right, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said. “These will be professionals, trained to take on dark wizards. We are trying to keep you safe.”
come for Harry. They wouldn’t have known that the Dark Lord needed Harry in order to rise again at all.
He tried asking one of the mermen for a spear, but that didn't go over well. Finally he dove for one of the jagged rocks at the lake's bottom, swam up and began hacking at the ropes holding Draco. What felt like an eon later, they came apart and Draco floated free. Harry looked around—there was no sign of any of the other champions, and he was at once worried and frustrated. The hour was nearly up—what if they never came for the other hostages? What if they ran out of time? The words he'd heard sung earlier came back to his mind:
It was more than the tone of Weasley’s voice that made Draco look at him. They’d both been listening to one of Hermione’s oddly humourous stories about dentists, and it was unlike Weasley to interrupt the Gryffindor girl when she chose to eat with them. When Draco did look at the freckled boy, however, his eyes were not fixed on the blond but rather to their right. Ah, Draco noticed, the owls.
Draco huffed out a broken sound somewhere between a laugh and a sob in response. After a minute, when Theo hadn’t moved, he reached up and unlocked the door, pulling it open. Theo simply sat down next to him.
Thompson’s wasn’t quite as esteemed as Lewis & Williams, but it was certainly still noteworthy. He’d actually been here a handful of times over the years, though the place proved far better kept in this world. What was more, the patrons were more relaxed, and the dress code wasn’t so strict. There were people dressed like Harry, and then there were people dressed like Neville—wholly sophisticated. He was sans his typical eye makeup, and instead wore a plain pair of glasses.
“A compliment?” Malfoy gasped in mock surprise. “I’m touched.”
Finally the git stirred. “Ow,” he groaned, looking up at Draco and then blinking several times when he realized who it was that had woken him.
They stood a little at a distance from the fans trying to talk their way in.
"I'd not forgotten," Hermione said dryly.
stop short at the sight of Ophelia, but it was a near-thing. He had to work to cover how idiotic he immediately felt. There he was, waiting around for her to return from school before he could set anything in motion—not even considering where he might clearly find her before then. It wasn’t as though she was confined to her campus, after all.
“Perhaps you could have extra Aurors on hand, watching for anything that may happen,” suggested Draco’s mum. “Tell the audience they’re for the Champion’s security. When the Dark Lord does somehow attack, they could intervene.”
Harry knew they couldn’t solve everything like this, but damn if it didn’t feel fantastic to try. He couldn’t be sure when Draco had rolled completely on top of him on his own, or maybe he’d pulled the blond flush against him, but it didn’t matter. What mattered was how good Draco’s body felt against his. His right hand twined with Harry’s left, the beginnings of what would soon be impressive Quidditch abs against his own chest, the hardening length of—oh.
“Averie is a bloke?” Harry said, recognising the surname from girls gossiping in the common room.
“No,” Harry said. “Don’t—don’t be. That was unfair of me.”
“Have you heard?” Harry whispered to Malfoy a few minutes later, while Clark introduced her magical guests—small creatures called Doxies, which Harry immediately distrusted due to their apparent relation to Pixies.
Draco reached up to touch his beloved hair, staring at one of his best mates in horror. “You can’t be serious.”
made at fourteen, Lucius?" Severus asked, venom nearly dripping off his voice in defence of the young boy.
Still, Fleur's sister floated idly, having no idea that her older sibling was almost completely out of time and had yet to save her.
The blond blinked for a moment, an uncomfortable look crossing his face. “I was in Potions. Snape was... then you leaned over and told me I missed Harry’s birthday. I was, er, surprised that you’d speak to me.” He shook his head like he was clearing it. “Then nothing... I was just suddenly here.”
“I left you stranded, like an overdramatic preteen.”
Harry was struggling to keep himself in check. This was
Harry sat against the headboard and rubbed underneath his glasses. They were new, and improved his vision much better than his old ones. Both Draco and Pansy had insisted, though he’d not budged on keeping the rounded shape he’d been accustomed to. Sometimes, though, they still felt a bit strange. “Under the stairs,” he confirmed. “It was my room.”
“Might wanna get your girlfriend out of here at some point, mate,” Harry heard Ron suggest lightly from behind him. Instinctively, he turned—deja vu making him forget that Ron wouldn’t have any reason to be referring to him—and found the red-head elbowing Cedric in the side, because that was the reality.
That night in the Slytherin common room found one Harry Potter laying atop a quiet, contemplative Draco Malfoy on the sofa, watching the fire in front of them burn.
Hermione gave Neville a long look, and then reached out to take Draco’s cold hand. “I suppose you’re right.”
Ophelia flinched in surprise when she found him in her path. “Merlin, Potter, you scared me,” she chastised, irritated. “What?”
"He wasn't serious. He was just... being Malfoy," Harry finished lamely.
“Joshua sounded like he hated him, though,” said Harry, weakly.
Harry looked up from his pouring. “What?”
He never got to finish that sentence, however, because Draco had apparently had enough of listening.
Draco’s eyes widened. “Every legitimate Black left alive is her pawn, Harry. She’s the Matriarch. If my father had disowned instead of just disinheriting me, she’d have murdered him,” he said, like it was a gentle reminder instead of an abhorrence. “She’d have murdered him anyway, if Ophelia wasn’t there to carry on the blood.”
Harry could only shrug, kicking lightly against the gravel below him.
Harry stared at the dot in confusion. Mr. Crouch, as far as Harry had last heard, had been too ill to go to work. Crouch hadn’t even attended the Yule Ball—so what was he doing, sneaking into Hogwarts at one o’clock in the morning? Harry hesitated briefly, a warning voice in his head that sounded an awful lot like Draco telling him to rethink what he wanted to do. In the end, though, Harry’s curiosity won out. He moved toward the nearest staircase, planning to find out just what Crouch was up to.
Dumbledore seemed to be genuinely sympathetic to Draco, but it wasn’t enough. Which left the blond sitting here, on his bed, utterly hopeless once again.
It turned out he wasn’t hard to find. As suspected, he still looked a lot like Harry himself. He was probably fifteen or so now, and looked it. He was smiling widely, confidently. And he was very obviously imparting his team with one last pep talk. Probably captain, then. Harry felt a surge of pride—as if he was at all involved in that, he chided himself.
that I love you and I would never hurt you again.”
Draco didn't hesitate to take the offered hand, revisiting another instance of an offered hand in his mind's eye, and they left the nearly silent Great Hall behind them. Draco tried his best to ignore the smug look on Granger's face as they passed her.
The shock gradually faded and Draco listened for a while as his mum and Harry told him about what had happened the day of the battle after he’d been hit and since. Eventually, though, they were interrupted when all of Draco’s friends began pouring in.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Draco—”
The blond shook his head to assure him. “No, I don’t blame you. I’d probably have done the same thing in your place, but Theo’s still my friend. I have to fix this if I can.”
The blond hardly had to even think about it. He let out a long breath. “Weasley.”
Harry shook his head slowly, attempting to clear it. "You—but you hate me too," he pointed out.
And Harry remembered how it felt to be there, at that moment in time—helplessly, righteously angry and so very stupid.
Blaise clapped him on the shoulder. "Believe it's your turn, mate."
They’d barely entered the school again when a familiar voice stopped them on their way to the Thunderbird wing.
Harry bit his lip, effectively shamed.
Harry looked a bit stunned. "I thought that would take more convincing," he admitted.
"We've all told him he's being a prat, but he won't hear it," George added.
“It’s mail,” Draco told him. “Comes every day.”
Harry had sucked in a sharp breath.
"What about?"
“And who are you?”
Clark took a deep breath, regaining her composure. “As your Head of House,” she began, her voice a warning all its own, “I am sending you both
Draco barely made it into a stall before he sunk to the floor. He absolutely should not have done that. He couldn’t recall even deciding to. One second Harry was going to leave and Draco was going to let him, and the next second they were kissing. Why had he done that? Now it was all worse than ever.
“Anyway,” she stated, a bit forceful, “once we figured out what had happened, we went straight to the staff, of course. They weren’t happy.”
And then he had the audacity to
His mum pulled back to look at him, her hands on his cheeks. “Eighty two days.”
“Er, Hi,” said Harry, careful not to sound too hopeful.
Harry waved him off, doing all he could to ignore the uncomfortable feelings lingering in his chest.
“I don’t care about my job or I wouldn’t be here,” Harry told him bluntly.
Harry narrowed his eyes. “What?”
“You didn’t care to know. You wanted to erase me and take over my life, so you could allow yourself to blissfully forget your own as well. But I don’t care how dreadful it was; it doesn’t excuse you, not by half. Not when I—”
“Bartemius Crouch Jr. is alive,” said Dumbledore. “He has been acting the part of Professor Moody throughout this year. It was he who put your name in the Goblet. He created a Portkey using the Triwizard cup, and attempted to use the Imperius Curse on Auror Jenks during the task. You, Harry, have never met the real Alastor Moody.”
It’s like, even when you have a plan, you don’t really realize how long certain parts/sections are going to be and everything until you actually write them out. There was a time way back when when I thought I was halfway done, just because I was half way through what I’d put down at the time. And it was, as we now know, decidedly not halfway done at that point. I hope no one has minded. You guys are so lovely, part of me wishes I could keep this going forever. The other part desperately wants to get to everything I’ve been saving up. Ah.
“What?” asked the blond, just before understanding surfaced. “Oh, about the missing girl. Yes I’ve been informed of the ‘curse
"Who's to say you weren't just lucky the first time?" Draco said, voice strangled.
They kissed for a long time, only breaking apart when an astonished female voice said, “Dragon?”
Draco grinned. “Didn’t have much time to be nervous, if you recall.”
The brunet sighed again, but set his shoulders. “No.”
“Sorry,” Neville explained sheepishly, shooting her an apologetic grin. “Those

She sat down beside him a second later. “He’ll forgive you eventually, you know. He’s only afraid.”
“Hey.”
Her mother had just left the room, tears in her eyes, with the promise that she would see her soon.
“I would never disown you, Draco,” he finally said, meeting his son’s eyes again.
Here we are at the finish. Thank you so much for reading! I hope you guys had a bit of fun with this and I'd love if you'd come chat with me in the comments c:

Neville put his hands up in a far be it from me sort of gesture. “I mean, not exactly news that you want him mate. I did go to school with you, in case you forgot.”
“He will.”
“Why not?”
It hadn’t fit together, though. Harry had found he couldn’t process it, not with such a glaring detraction. “But the first time Harim shut me all the way out, completely and deliberately, it was because of Draco. And
Harry's vision was clouding over red, especially because Draco still had not said a single word. "Disgusting? Really? Well I think there are loads of things that are disgusting, Ron. Like homophobia for example. Oh and dishing out ultimatums. Abandoning your best mate multiple times, that’s also a good one. You know what mate? Me snogging my boyfriend isn't what’s disgusting here, you are."
“It would be messing with Harim’s head too,” Harry had finished in amazement. “He’s trying to block that off. He doesn’t want to think badly of Draco.”
Ron's cheeks were turning red. "It's just that, uh, you haven't erm... your potion."
Hermione now appreciated her seat because if she were not in this exact spot, she would not have been able to—now that she had cause to—note just how often Malfoy

"I believe it's my turn to ask," said Hermione after the two additions were added.
“You!” Draco shouted suddenly, startling Harry just a little. “I noticed, dammit. Every September you’d always come back just a bit too thin. Dark circles—gods. I noticed. And I made

something more to learn.” She paused, shrugged. “But Time had called to me as much as the Mind had those years before, and so I simply made the transition. For years, I was renewed. No longer bored; there was a world of knowledge at my feet all over again. Somewhat recently, though, I’d begun to feel that perhaps I’d exhausted myself with Time, also. Except that… well. There was a puzzle piece that was missing, is the only way I can explain it. There was something I didn’t know, so I stayed. To be frank, I was not even certain how to approach leaving, either. It’s virtually unheard of to retire so young as I am.”
So the story goes, way back in the summer, whilst outlining this fic, I was actually in the midst of watching season 6 of The 100 as it aired—that CW show I’m sure some of you have at least heard of. (And if you watch it, you’re probably starting to work out exactly how that little kernel is coming out to play sort of, amongst other things soon to come... *wink wink* lol.) Basically, I was pretty excited to get to this point, so please let me know what you guys think. Love it, hate it? Do tell me why, won’t you. I did so miss this.
Her brows furrowed. “Today, specifically,” she probed.
“He doesn’t want anything to do with me today, evidently.”
"He's a Malfoy!" Ron shouted. "How can you even—I thought we were friends."
Let’s not lie to each other, Harry.”
"I wasn't!" Harry protested, even though he might have sort of been a bit lucky. He took Draco's hand and forced him to meet his eyes. "I will be
, Hermione."
Harry had the thought that his entire life was a series of worst-case scenarios, and said as much. Muttered it, really.
.... I’m sorry.
Something in his voice must have alarmed Harry, since his eyes snapped up to look up at him. His jaw nearly dropped. "Wait," he said, "are you jealous?"
"I don't think anyone would choose desperate to describe you, Potter. And why wouldn't you want to take me? Because I'm a bloke? That's rather homophobic of you, don't you think?"
Harry forced himself to shift his focus, taking in the rest of the room. The whole family was here; Bill and Fluer were sharing a centre loveseat—and Harry spared a moment to feel almost warm at seeing Bill’s face unmarred for the first time in so many years. Charlie was on a stool nearest where Harry stood at the edge between what was considered the kitchen, a half-eaten slice of pie on the counter behind him.
“Until the next year, when Anthony Jackson disappeared,” said Maria.
She wrapped her arms around his neck, those treacherous tears gathering in her eyes for the millionth time that afternoon. “When did you get so wise, Draco Malfoy?”
“How do they even narrow down this many people?” Harry asked, deliberately changing the subject as they waited for things to really get started.
"We're your friends, Dray," Blaise reminded him, in a tone that suggested Draco may have brain damage.
“There’s this voice in the back of my head,” he finally continued. “It gets louder every time I wake up in a cold sweat alone, and it keeps saying that this is what you really mean. I’m

“Why,” Malfoy repeated flatly.
Draco thought that Harry Potter being on his bed should be far more exciting than this. But the topic of conversation was ruining it.
She broke off, seeming to register for the first time that Draco wasn’t by himself. Jacqueline tapped her foot impatiently behind her.
Draco side-eyed him. “What does that mean?”
The word
Harry looked around, not able to spot that familiar head of blond hair anywhere he could see. "He went off to give us some space. I'm sure he'll find me later on."

“You-Know-Who’s returned then?” Weasley asked.
“It doesn’t!” He hollered. “You’re—you can’t go back there! You can’t just live like that. Who the rutting hell let this happen in the first place?”
, and Harry melted completely against him.
"Or maybe that's a bit much. But I know that you like him. You're not nearly as subtle as you think you are."
It was apparently Draco's turn to defend himself. "I have
Malfoy glared at him and went back to eating.
“Two pleases? That’s something from the man who called me a talentless interloper not two weeks ago. You losing your touch or something, Potter?”
"How long have you been a bloody poof?"
“Here you are,” said the now triumphant voice a moment later, followed by the sound of dragging feet and protest. Draco did not need to have seen to understand that Not Harry had given his position away on purpose, just as the woman to Draco’s right had wanted, and was now playing the part of the trapped victim.
Pansy smiled. "Do you forfeit, then?"
Ginny, though, was in the midst of receiving a tongue lashing.
Neville left a short while later, and Hermione began to talk to Draco as she sometimes did. Pansy was always demanding she tell him something or another for her. But whenever Hermione suggested she come along to visit this time, the other girl would refuse. All their friends did. Hermione didn’t blame them for not wanting to see their friend like this. She didn’t like it much either, but someone besides Sirius had to check in on Harry and Narcissa. He had a house to remodel and an entire life to rebuild, after all. Lucius Malfoy surely was not going to take up the responsibility, given that he hadn’t even been seen at St. Mungos since the day Draco was brought in. First it was because of his trial. But now Narcissa insisted it was due to misplaced guilt. Hermione thought that was a worthless excuse, but graciously kept her opinion to herself.
That time, Harry obeyed.
All Harry's friends from Gryffindor had come as well, congratulating him often and being considerably warmer than Draco knew most of them had been lately.
“Something we can help you with mate?” G- no, Fred asked him, seeing as how he was holding one of Hermione’s hands in his lap, and that shiny diamond visible on the other where it rested on her thigh.
a good day, and he’d not wanted to come in. Reid, at least, had apparently gotten enough from Harry a few days ago that he hadn’t had to endure her ransacking his brain today. She’d just asked him a couple of seemingly random questions and sent him on to Sheila.
He got up, careful not to jostle Harry, and went to wake the poor sods. Mostly it earned him grumbles and groans and sometimes protests, but they all eventually cleared out. All except for Weasley, who was slumped against the far wall and snoring. Harry had informed Draco around two in the morning that he and his once best friend had indeed begun to reconcile, and Draco had told himself to smile and be glad about it. But, in truth, he was still worried. Weasley had been the cause of Harry’s misery when he’d abandoned him not once, but twice this year. And Draco didn’t completely trust the boy not to do it again, no matter how much he wanted Harry to be happy.
She nodded. “Very well. You and Harim—as you and now I refer to him—are, in many ways, separate entities. When you visit him in your mindspace, you are each a manifestation of your respective experiences and thus the memories of those experiences.
“I feel…. weak,” it hissed after a moment, causing more whimpers from the servant.
“What?” he demanded sharply, but then went carefully blank when he realised it was Draco who’d woken him.
took charge of our lives,’ he’ll say. Which will set Neville’s nerves. I can’t have them like this when we’re trying to brand towards the Muggles—especially with Rita still after me for what happened with the whole scandal. She’ll—”
But then they reached the den, where everyone looked over at their entrance practically in sync, and the momentary comfort he’d felt evaporated.
Theo was still up when Harry reached the dungeons, which really was no surprise given that he was practically nocturnal most days and tended to be exhausted if the sun was up. His nose was in a book when Harry entered and shucked off his invisibility cloak.
Hermione was about to wave him off, when something occurred to her. "Um Draco?"
A nod, and the uncomfortable moment passed, a silent decision having been put to rest. "Right then. Truth or Dare?"
“Definitely not worth it,” agreed Cosima, joining the conversation without missing a beat as she slid through to sit on the other side of Malfoy. “Damn, even more of a turn out than last year.”
“I think I do,” agreed Draco. “And that’s why I can’t.
And it had been doing so for weeks. Months, even. Even this very second, as he attempted this shoddily detached introspection, he could feel it—the devastation. Devastation at a degree that was
Draco stood for a moment in something like awe. Yes, he believed he was friends with Weasley. Ron Weasley. When had that happened? But then the ginger haired boy came back out, a shimmering ball of fabric in his grasp, and Draco refocused on what was at hand.
“Because I almost died?” Draco asked.
"Good. Because if you die in this bloody ridiculous tournament I'm likely to go mad."
occasionally take a break you know."
“But what if that never happens?!” Harry burst out. “I–I still don’t know… Harim’s not—! I mean… you shouldn’t be waiting for something that I don’t….”
Oh by the way, I forgot to say thank you guys so much when I passed the 500 kudos mark. This story is almost at 550 now, and it really means so much to me. Thank you to everyone following this story and being so endlessly patient with me all this time. And, as always, I love reading your comments and appreciate those of you that do so very much. This story has been such a blast for me to write because of all of you and I hope you enjoy what’s to come!
Harry and Malfoy both nodded to Fontaine by way of hello, waiting to be chastised.
He was going to be sick.
(See the end of the chapter for
Despite how massive the place was, it felt welcoming. Like he belonged there. His mother and Dhadhi were always about—the latter usually to be found carrying on long, friendly conversations with the house elves and insisting on helping in the kitchen. Making a good-natured nuisance of herself, surely, but the elves clearly adored her.
Harry nodded, Draco hadn’t exactly left him room to argue, and relaxed back down against him. “Thank you,” he said after a moment in silence.
,” Draco hissed at them both.
“Yes you have! How dare you?! You’d like to get me fired too, is that it?! What the hell am I supposed to give Skeeter?!”
“Apparently I sleepwalk now,” he explained.
Draco nodded. "Father's always been a bit of a prick,”
“I know,” Malfoy replied easily, pretending like he wasn’t gripping his broom like a lifeline. “I see him in the library a lot.”
“Who?” said Maria.
Harry looked her over, took in the calculation plain in her gaze, and got it.
Draco's eyes narrowed. "What, I suppose the both of you already have dates then?"
"What? Why would you—no you aren't!"
to you?”
you let anyone protect you! You care more about being the goddamned Boy Hero than you care about me, or you wouldn’t of even
Draco gave a half smile at that. “I’m still not totally convinced you aren’t dangerous,” admitted the blond.
"Denial is never healthy, Dray. Anyone with half a working eye can see that Diggory is unfairly fit. There's nothing wrong with admitting it."
friend, so I couldn’t possibly be arsed to care about you.
“Neville Longbottom,” she was saying now, “it’s wonderful to officially meet you.”
She turned away from her husband then, off in the direction of the study, but halted in her tracks when Lucius said, “Your beloved son. Even when he has not contacted you in months?”
have even succumbed to the strength of it, in a way. But if, in another life, your feelings with regards to Mr. Malfoy were less than pleasant…”
This chapter is so indulgent, it’s almost embarrassing lol. You’ll see.
“Who pissed in your cheerios?” Joshua wondered from beside him a while later. They’d sat next to each other for History of Magic, and Harry, as per his track record, wasn’t retaining a word of the lecture. Except, this time, he couldn’t blame the professor. The man at the front of the room was not only very much alive, but enthusiastic. His voice was strong and clear. Harry’s mind just couldn’t be bothered to care. He wasn’t used to being a helpless bystander; he was used to being the one to take on the problem. But this wasn’t Hogwarts, and it wasn’t Voldemort behind it all.
Harry understood what the blond was truly saying: that, ideally, it would be only a matter of time. That it didn’t matter if Ophelia rolled her eyes in disapproval, or if Harry might not get along with everyone in Draco’s life. Whatever the reason. Ending up together would depend on Harry and Draco, and no one else.
"I don't think I ever would have known..." Harry said, cursing his voice for coming out a near whisper and wondering where his supposed Gryffindor courage had gone.
In the morning, Harry would put aside his nerves and write to Sirius. He would tell Draco about everything that had happened, likely endure his boyfriend chastising him about attempting to investigate in the first place, and then they’d both work out what to do from there. But for tonight, Harry would put everything out of his mind and fall asleep in Draco’s arms.
The next moment Neville's potion exploded. As he did every day in Snape's class, Neville looked petrified as Snape turned and glared.
"Are students not allowed to snog their dates? I must've missed wherever that rule was written," said Draco.
“No,” Fontaine agreed. “But it is all there is. I know it can be stressful, to be somewhere in which you feel unsafe, that those around you may be unsafe. I realize that this can often inspire aggression, especially given that you are both transfers.”
Harry walked slowly towards the dungeons, needing to talk to Draco more than ever about the million questions firing through his head about Crouch and Snape and everything else. He knew, also, that it was probably a good idea to write to Sirius about the night’s occurrences. Harry hadn’t heard anything from his godfather since Christmas morning when he’d opened his gift, not even throughout the spectacle that was himself and Draco becoming a couple. If he was honest with himself, Harry was just the slightest bit worried about what Sirius had been thinking about him—he’d been doing his best not to consider the worst.
so question for the class: would anyone be interested in the songs I listen to while planning/outlining/writing this? I was thinking of possibly sharing the ever-growing list since some I really love and feel like they add to the vibe well
She waved him off. "Oh fine, but you classy Italians quite fancy your liquor, love."
. I promise, alright?"
Lavender had been hurt, perhaps rightfully. But that didn’t mean she had to be right. Lavender had also called him on avoiding all his friends from before, though, and she’d had a point.
Draco’s father passed the three of them, silently going back inside. Draco, however, turned and began a quick walk in the opposite direction. He didn’t want to see Harry just yet, betrayal still curling in his stomach.
Later that day, Harry quickly came to understand why there were three separate days allotted for Quodpot tryouts.
“No need to thank me. It’s in my best interest you two work things out. We miss you, you know,” she added gently. “And Pansy does too; I can tell.”
The second task was in less than two weeks, and they'd been through book after book about Merfolk and breathing underwater and been entirely unable to find anything Hermione or Draco himself labeled sufficient. Worse, Harry—in Draco's opinion—was nowhere near as concerned about this as he should have been. His endless optimism was beginning to worry Draco as much as the rest of it.
“Something like that,” replied the blond, sounding oddly hesitant. “Though usually I just help them practice their english.”
Maria made a noise like a bomb going off, complete with hand gesture. “Mass panic. If you think it’s strict around here now, you got no idea. Shit was like a prison back then.”
Draco’s eyebrows drew together. “For what?”
Malfoy stiffened. "Yes, well. That was—part of something that didn't work out. I was only—"
What he said hadn’t come from nowhere, of course. Harry’d had concerns for a while now. And, in hindsight, it couldn’t be entirely denied that part of the reason they’d gotten past the scandal with Zabini earlier that year relatively unscathed might’ve had a bit to do with the band’s recent decline in popularity. The numbers were getting harder to ignore, especially after the latest release.
“I thought Harry would be here,” Neville said after a while in silence.
Standing abruptly, he told Theo thank you and left the restrooms in a rush.
“Unless we stop it, right?” Harry said. Lucius Malfoy’s eyes turned to him and remained there. Draco imagined he could have reached out and felt the animosity between the two.
"Right." Harry sounded far more sure than he actually was, and, while Hermione's jaw tightened, she let the conversation drop with little more than a roll of her eyes.
Lucius opened and closed his mouth several times before he spoke again. "My son is
Ron rolled his eyes. “We’ve told him you’re harmless but he won’t accept it.”
“I don’t—”
His next words undermined Harry’s certainty.
Hermione didn't get the chance until the following Wednesday. Malfoy always seemed to be accompanied by someone or another, and he would avoid Harry—and Hermione and Ron by consequence—at seemingly any cost. Ron often said he was glad the git was minding his own business for once, and Harry would absently agree. More than once, however, Hermione would look up during meals to find Harry staring intently in Malfoy's direction, as if he were willing the Slytherin to look at him. Little did Harry know that Malfoy did look, only just as soon as Harry would give up and look away. Malfoy never noticed that Hermione noted this each and every time. That was, until Wednesday evening.
All Harry really wanted now was for Draco to look at him again. Not just a glance or anything like he did when required. No, Harry wanted Draco to look at
Blaise rolled his eyes. He couldn’t help it; how much more forward could a bloke be? “Actually, you should have said it a long time ago.”
enough
Like hell would he let that happen, Harry decided, and began his attempt to cut Hermione free.
Malfoy gave him a look that said ‘why do you think,’ and Harry rolled his eyes. “Of course,” he scoffed. “So what do you normally do? I probably would have stayed with Cosima.”
Everything got rather loud after that, as well. Most of the Weasley brothers were clearly ribbing after Fred, who had a wide smile on his face despite the shaky atmosphere.
She huffed impatiently. “Perhaps I should have lead with what are you doing here? And don’t give me shite about being part of the mission. You’ve not got a trace on you, and I’m not in the position to entertain any games.”
Draco bit his lip. "I don't know. I mean obviously at that time I wasn't... I mean I just thought that I wanted you to like me. Be my friend. And you had those brilliant eyes and I went about trying to impress you all wrong and—"
He was cut off by Draco's pillow hitting him squarely in the face. "I was
The blond parted his lips, then closed them again and swallowed. Hermione sprang out of her seat and ran to get him a glass of water from the sink. Some part of her was still surprised when, once she returned, he was still looking at her. Awake. Actually awake.
"Absolutely," Harry replied. "You in?"
“How was I to know, or even guess at your… confinement here?”
"You really are mental," said the blond, but Hermione could tell he had deflated.  "Have you ever met Potter? I must have been mad to ask the first time."
“No!” Harry cut him off quickly. “No, no. I want kids. But adopting isn’t a small thing, I didn’t know... how to bring it up.”
“Is that actually supposed to make me feel
(See the end of the chapter for
"Was it a success?" Luna asked.
Fontaine sat behind his desk, dismissing the other two boys politely before turning his eyes on Harry and Malfoy. Up close, the man didn’t look all that old. Possibly seventy or so, his hair a darker grey than Harry had thought. His eyes were nearly the same colour as his skin, a tan like honey.
” the inhuman voice replied.
"What?" Harry asked, bewildered and a little nervous now.
“Without you I’m just… cold,” Harry finished, his last ditch effort to get Draco to talk to him.
“I—of course I do,” Harry told him, still horrified.
. Hermione's got the most reason to be offended, but she supported me before
She gave him an unimpressed look. “Because he told me, duh.”
As always, it was as though a switch had flipped. It didn't matter that they were in the middle of a corridor where anyone could walk by and see them, given that it was still lunch time. In fact, that was the last thing that mattered. Harry wondered if there would ever be a time where kissing Draco was less exhilarating, and doubted it wholeheartedly. There was nothing in the world like this. Draco had always used to appear sharpened to him, all pointiness and bones. But his lips were softer than anything, and his hands on Harry's body were tender. His tongue was always gentle as it glided against Harry's own. One of them moaned, Harry was nearly sure it had been him. Harry took a moment to be glad they'd finally mastered how to breathe as they kissed, so the need for air wouldn't interrupt them. Harry was far too turned on to be doing this in public, but as usual he couldn't help himself. Draco was intoxicating.
“Come on,” Ayesha said, grabbing his hand and pulling him down the stands to the edge of the field. Amjad lit up when he noticed them, shoving his friends off so he could bound over. Harry didn’t have the time to prepare himself before he had his arms full of teenager. “You came!” shouted his younger brother, still exhilarated. “Did you like the game?”
Sooo I was nervous about this one, because it was a little brutal, so let me know your thoughts! It’s good to be back.
"Perhaps he did."
tonight,
“I guess.”
Malfoy stared at him. “And what would you like me to do about that?”
“I figured it was past time we have a chat, Harry,”
"In love with him," Hermione finished.
“No!” Harry and Neville shouted at the same time.
A bit of a filler chapter, this. I’ve been in such a writing slump lately. But I’m glad to be back!! Next chapter is about 3/4 written and should be up within the next week, ideally.
I Turn to You by Christina Aguilera
Foreboding settled heavily on Hermione’s shoulders.
Lucius Malfoy arrived at Hogwarts the very next morning.
"Sure. There are herbs for all sorts of things, why not this?" Neville said, completely unaware of the gravity of this revelation.
Harry couldn't help the laugh that escaped him. "I'm just kidding," he admitted. "This time."
Harry stood up, walking towards his kitchen. She followed him, watching him from the other side of the island. “Harry.”
you know?” Maria didn’t sound particularly comforted, however. Harry could sympathise. In light of it all, pairs seemed rather perfunctory and passive.
It was decided, much to Harry's initial protests, that during class was actually the safest time to pull off the gillyweed theft, as it was the only time Snape would be far from his storeroom and occupied so as not to notice any potential alarms. And since Snape was so meticulous about inventory, they would only have one shot: the day before the task.
Sheila had cocked her head to the side, calculating. “Tell me, Harry, what
Harry swallowed. “Not on purpose?” he tried.
Harry scoffed, almost involuntarily, and Malfoy glared at him. “What?” he demanded.
Hermione blinked, then gaped. "Oh, of course!"
Lavender looked at him incredulously, her eyes wide. “In case you’ve forgotten, that’s our job.”
Harry mentally growled.
Harry swallowed.
one of his best mates; he hadn’t spoken about him since the article was published, but that didn’t mean anything, necessarily. He could have very well been avoiding the topic for Harry’s sake. He was hardly obligated to inform Harry of everyone he spent time with, in any case.
And then he left in search.
“I haven’t the slightest clue why we’re mates,” Pansy stated haughtily. Luna smiled, her cheeks turning just a bit pink. “Other than being the prettiest girl I’ve ever seen? It wasn’t any one thing, everything about her is simply enchanting,” Luna informed everyone, eyeing the Slytherin girl almost dreamily. Pansy, who had grown quite red, seemed unable to say a thing.
"Draco," said Blaise once he’d collected himself.
“I wouldn’t change it,” Draco admitted quietly. “If anything, they remind me I’m freer than I ever would have been.”
Blaise shook his head in mock exasperation. “It’s a game. Does there have to be a reason?”
But he wasn’t given the opportunity to question such a decision further, as the woman grabbed hold of his upper arm and yanked him along with her. He wasn’t able to notice where the other three Aurors had concealed themselves, but he hoped wherever it was would be enough. He and Auror Fleur had ducked behind a large gravestone, the darkness providing extra cover.
When a team of blue-clad boys and girls walked onto the field, Harry learned his brother was a Ravenclaw.
There were various groans of disappointment at this, but no one was too surprised. Whatever the case, it meant there would be another dare. Draco contemplated for a moment. “Choose someone to exchange briefs with.”
Which, he understood now, as he stood in his tux, abandoned in the centre of the floor at Hermione’s wedding, was outrageously naive.
Everything Harry had heard about Congresswoman Vivianne Moore had turned his stomach in one way or the other, and he couldn’t say the newest development was much of a shock. According to Celine, her mum frequently referred to her as her greatest shame.
Pansy looked slightly put out at this. "Oh fine," she said. "I dare you to... hmm. Go fetch my dearest."
“We tried to convince him,” Celine was saying, “but Edgar has a policy against outdoor activities.”
"Right beside you. We all did. I woke everyone else and they left already, has anyone told you you sleep like the dead?"
Harry thought he might be ill, finally understanding the some of the underlying anxiety round campus he’d already begun to feel. If students were being kidnapped so often that no one was even bothering to search for them anymore, of course no one was allowed to roam about by themselves. The need for pairs made a horrifying kind of sense. He was nearly unwilling to ask the next question. “When you said she’d be back…” but he trailed off, unable to finish.
“We’ll tell you that story another day,” she said dismissively. “Right now what you need to understand is that Sirius Black is not, nor has he ever been, a Death Eater. He was framed by Peter Pettigrew—”
Sirius cut her off with another laugh. “Only having a bit of fun, I do understand. I assure you Mr. Malfoy, I’m no mad criminal.”
“What does that—”
Harry grimaced, and Malfoy grinned at him. Harry hoped that smile wouldn't always flip his stomach like it did.
Harry’s mind kicked into overdrive. Peter couldn’t die, he needed to testify. He needed to be alive to prove Sirius didn’t kill him. “Help!” he shouted out without thinking.
"I'm doomed," Draco repeated.
It turned out, of course, that one more day might not have been alright. Because said day was Saturday, and it had admittedly slipped Harry’s mind that that meant anything. He received his reminder in the form of his sister that morning. He was in the middle of the kitchen beating eggs, clad in just his pants, when his floo roared to life.
Draco opened his mouth again, to say what he wasn’t entirely sure, but Not Fleur beat him to it. “He’s some dimwit kid, followed me into the maze.”
Hermione’s mind repeated, unable to think past the shock.
Her sharp gaze met his.
,” Draco stressed. “You did nothing wrong. Harry was just scared when he said those things to you. It’s not the truth.”
"I've been sent to take you to Slytherin," Hermione told the young Ravenclaw on sight.
Harry hadn’t expected her to become so gentle. Her concern seemed so real. He found himself telling part of the truth. “I decided I don’t want to… be like this anymore. I’m trying to change.”
"Yeah, I'm fine. Just that my boyfriend's likely to get himself killed come next week."
"Yeah, mate. People really have died in the past," Neville put in.
Before he had the chance to say anything more, her expression had already shifted from expectancy to recognition and had settled rapidly into indignation.
And then, all at once, he was crying. Like a bloody
Pansy rolled her eyes. "There's quite a bit of press out there you dolt. It wouldn't be on for us to allow you to be hounded."
“So to speak, yes.”
Draco put his head between his knees. For the first couple days, he’d hoped that Harry would tell him that he decided not to go along, to let the adults find him a safe place away from it all so they could handle the Dark Lord by themselves. When that didn’t happen, Draco had just gotten angrier and angrier, until it was more principle than anything. Vaguely, he registered the tears in his eyes with the typical irritation and embarrassment.
one, but yeah. Luna.” He pushed the game along quickly, seemingly oblivious to the peculiar look the answer brought to Neville’s features.
"They could put anything under that water, Harry," Hermione reminded him softly. "Just because you'll be able to breathe now doesn't make the task safe."
“They’re letting this tosser be there too,” Weasley informed him, waving his arm at Harry.
"People have died in this tournament, Harry," he'd said.
He seemed to drag in a broken breath that sent something that felt like razor blades cutting into Harry’s chest. He didn’t move though, not until Draco suddenly looked up and shouted, “Go!”
“You made up for it,” Draco said once the words had sunk in. “You did the right thing.”
She continued without acknowledging his revelations.
It was clear that’s what she was hoping for. But privately, Harry thought that might be what he was afraid of.
This was how Draco had managed to let him back in. Because his aunt, who had frightened Harry into delirium right before his eyes, was a psychopath in this world as well. It was why he hadn’t been anything like insistent, or even visibly curious where Harry would notice. He thought…
Harry nearly jumped a foot in the air at the abrupt shout, and the immediate resounding crack that followed.
Also, to those of you who asked, way back when, if this fic would have a traditional ‘villain’: the answer is still no (sorry, it’s very late in the game for that anyway, I’d point out), but I do hope you enjoy this close approximation while it lasts. Who was Bellatrix ever but a villain, anyway.
Harry hadn’t seen Malfoy in person for years. He could still remember the end of the war, how beaten down and frail the blond had looked at his trial. How his emptiness had unnerved Harry.
Care of Magical Creatures was also the only class he shared with Malfoy this term, and he couldn’t say he minded much. When he arrived outside, the blond was stood next to two girls, chatting to them in french. There was something about the way the language sounded in Malfoy’s voice that Harry liked. He stopped beside the three of them, basking a bit in the light breeze and smell of mountain soil.
She stared hard at him, as if searching his face for something. A moment later, she seemed to have found it, because her face smoothed deliberately. “What did you do with the story, Harry.”
Draco’s appearance was always difficult to miss, even in a crowd, but with his sister at his side, it would have been impossible.
Hermione’s lip curled down at the corners when she recalled how the both of them had made her promise five separate times to send for them immediately if anything changed, as they always did. It had been nearly three months and there was no indication Draco would wake any time soon. It wasn’t healthy for them to spend so many hours here, neglecting themselves.
. Unfortunately, he didn’t seem to be able to stop.
Draco opened his eyes to find his mother staring at him. Hermione had disappeared a while back, presumably to tell everyone he was awake. Harry moved out of the way likely just in time. Draco had no doubt his mother would have peeled his boyfriend off of him otherwise, as she practically launched herself at him. Draco closed his eyes and sighed into her embrace, a moment passing before he realised she’d begun sobbing.
“Yes.” It was essentially what he’d planned to do, anyway, he told himself.
With that promise, she handed them over. Harry took them and looked down, zooming in and trying to catch a glimpse of someone who could be his brother.
“It’s always the quiet ones you have to watch out for,” Blaise finally said, sounding delighted as he stood up. “Well? Who’s coming with to keep me honest?”
Malfoy seemed to remember the last part about halfway through his meal. They were sat with at least three feet between them, Harry paying pointed attention to his food and trying not to react to the group’s watching them both with bewilderment, when the blond suddenly stood and stomped over to the table where Noelle and Jacqueline sat amongst a handful of other transfer students. Harry was immediately relieved.
“And he’s my cousin or something,” Draco reminded them. “Just because someone is family doesn’t mean they’re innocent, or that you should protect them. Merlin, do you even realise what could have happened if you’d been caught helping him escape? How you even managed it is beyond me.”
But now it all made sense. Harry was still staring at him, fear and hope mingled in his eyes, a more vivid green then the nightmares had ever managed to produce. That this was really happening struck him once again, knocking the wind out of him for a moment.
Harry demanded, his hands in fists.
“I wish I knew,” Hermione finally said.
the Slytherin dungeons? "He does?"
son,” she hissed. “And he has loved Harry Potter in some way or the other since he stepped foot in that robe shop, you cannot act as though you don’t know it as well as I with how he spoke. If you gave a damn about your son, Lucius, your
Malfoy twisted from her and punched the wall so hard Hermione heard his knuckle crack, but he made no cry of pain. Hermione swallowed her surprise. She'd never imagined Draco Malfoy the type to express anger physically, though she didn't now know why she'd thought that. Slytherins had just always seemed so... collected.
They were about a quarter into the game—Ravenclaw up by 20—when Harry’s eyes began to wander. He could see a figure a ways down with long white hair and colorful robes who could only be Dumbledore. It had taken him about five minutes solid to look away from the man’s back. Also from where he sat, he could see Madam Hooch, standing next to a slightly-older looking professor Flitwick and a dark haired, tall woman. It hit him, then, that there was no sign of Snape.
But as they made their way to the end of the school year, Harry knew there was no avoiding the daunting thoughts of the task to come. He was more than aware that his future with Draco could come to an end all too quickly if he wasn’t careful enough.
“I think I’ll do truth,” Luna decided happily. Pansy sent a warning look in Blaise’s direction that he ignored.
"I... I never—"
“Is that…” Draco began but stopped, obviously realising the uselessness of the question.
“What took so long is what I wanna know,” said Cosima.
The blond’s eyes narrowed as he looked down at her. “How so?”
“There was a time you loved that about me,” said Narcissa, angry and hollow at once. “A time that you loved me at all.”
Malfoy’s cheeks were bright red with adrenaline and pride as he ducked his head to hide a grin.
"I'm sure it surprised you that you are not, in fact, perfect miss Granger. But that is really no excuse for these theatrics! Get back in your chair and clean up your station, as you and Weasley have obviously failed this assignment," he finished.
“No trouble then?” Luna inquired with a soft smile.
, he added silently.
“It’s okay,” he said breathlessly. “We have loads of time. Some point in the future when we’re... ready.”
They went off in the direction of the bathroom, and the remainder of the group made small talk for the next ten minutes until Harry and Pansy re-entered the room. Even those present but not involved in the game turned to look, and there was a gasp or two.
He’d gotten lucky there. But today was not a day that made him want to appreciate small victories.
“Then maybe you should, I don’t know, stop talking about it?” Draco asked sarcastically.
“You won’t,” said Draco. “Ever.”
The Healers had assured her memory loss was nowhere on the list of potential effects.
Harry wished he could help somehow, and was grateful that Maria took her hand, comforting. Cosima visibly reigned in her sorrow, and Harry felt a pang in his heart at the sight of it.
Harry’s hands were stuffed into his pockets, chastised. “I meant that I’m sorry for taking advantage of your help and then not appreciating you as a friend,” he explained quietly, his eyes on Lavender’s carpet. “I’m sorry that I didn’t… that I kept myself at arms length and disregarded you when you were trying to be there for me all along. It’s not an excuse, but I want you to know that it wasn’t to do with you. Not truly. It was me. I’m still— it’s still hard for me to believe sometimes that this is my real life and not some sort of dream that I’ll wake from one of these days… and because of that it was hard to accept that it couldn't all just stay as simple as I ne-
Hermione must have seen the way Harry's eyes flashed, because suddenly she was up and standing between them. Harry wasn't sure who she was trying to shield.
This chapter is also another strictly-memory chapter, if you haven’t guessed. Bet some of you guys thought we were done were those.
When they were at last given permission to fly, Harry nearly laughed out loud with the force of his exhilaration. Godric, but he’d missed this.
The whirl of apparition caught him up—and then they were landing on weathered, near-frozen grass. The air was biting despite the bright sun overhead, and Harry had a moment to regret not thinking to grab a jumper before his first look around revealed where they were.
And finally, “Okay.”
For a moment, Draco thought she wouldn’t answer or hadn’t been listening for his thoughts over the Dark Lord’s voice. But then she said,
“Well my best friend is this really smart muggleborn,” he said into her shoulder. “She’s a genius really.”
“But you need to,” Lavender said, understanding.
Nothing.
Malfoy's lips pulled up a bit again. "You weren't supposed to."
“That’s the only reason you came over here, wasn’t it?” Harry shot back. “All about the story, huh. Don’t even actually care what might be going on in my life if it gets you closer to—”
Draco’s jaw dropped. “You mean... take Harry’s.”
The green eyed boy sighed. “Yes Draco, like where your bed goes. You can stop repeating everything I say.”
“Hold out your arm,” the Dark Lord commanded.
“Is it my turn to choose someone?” asked Luna. Several of the group nodded and she said, “Harry.”
“Dark Lord called him Wormtail. I was wondering where I’d heard the name before and then I remembered. Harry’s godfather went to Azkaban for killing him.”
Pansy rolled her eyes. "Your House changes its collective mind at the drop of a dime. Give it a couple days and it'll be fine."
Harry checked himself right on time, managing not to lose his composure at the sight of Lavender Brown, very much alive. She was clearly dressed appropriately for their surroundings: a pink cocktail dress and heels so high and thin it seemed impossible to look so effortless in them. And her face was strained into a smile, contrasting with the promise of violence in her eyes when she shot Harry a look. It felt like it was a warning, one for which context was a mystery to him.
,” the high pitched, inhuman voice demanded.

Draco tried not to show how delighted he was at the statement. This was all beginning to feel like it couldn't possibly be real. But it was. Draco would never dream of Ron Weasley in any capacity. And there Weasley stood, not ten feet away and gaping at Harry as though he'd never seen him before. It made Draco want to snarl at him even more than usual.
“I guess we get to decide who wins,” said the Auror with Diggory’s face.
Draco sighed. “I woke you up because you’ve been avoiding me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You want to be very careful, Harry,”
This time there was no response, verbal or otherwise. Cautious grey eyes watched him.
Harry couldn’t hold back his grin, thinking of the last five years. “Not at all.”
"Everyone's looking at us, you know," Malfoy told him. "Even the professors."
“Have a seat,” the man said instead. Both boys immediately did so, eyes wary. Dumbledore was very powerful, but Harry could admit he’d never been all that much of a disciplinarian. This Headmaster was a wild card, an unknown. It made it impossible to relax, even sitting.
"—think muggles would burn us to death given half the chance, and so should stay to their own place,” she finished, more confident in her assumptions now. “But anyone who's paid attention to you at all knows you aren't your father, Malfoy."
"Oh I don't, I assure you."
This time Harry did laugh. “You play, I take it?”
The girl made a sour face but didn't deny the truth of the statement. "You're all lucky it worked."
“So did you get on with Granger?” she asked after a moment, trying to appear unbothered.
Harry realised that Neville was asking him for expertise now, and abruptly floundered. He had no expertise to speak of, because he wasn’t actually a journalist. “I’m not… sure…” he hedged carefully, “I’ll uh, I’ll figure it out okay?” Harry barely hid his wince at the implied promise. “Just, be as careful as you can until we speak again, all right?”
shorter chapter since I just decided this memory should stand alone... i’d love to hear thoughts
“Yes,” said Harry simply.
Realisation seemed to dawn on Harry’s godfather all at once. “Oh! You thought I would be upset that you prefer blokes?”
He wasn’t sure how much time had gone by when someone knocked on the stall door.
Harry gaped. "Are you daft?" he demanded at last. "You were the reason the whole school hated me for months!"
was one of those areas Harry was not ready to address head on.
“Want me to go sleep in Gryffindor?” he tried again.
Harry opened his mouth to object, but Draco shook his head.
Malfoy finally seemed to have recovered some, because he leaned down close and hissed at her quietly. "I am not
“Of course I do,” Joshua said immediately. “You’re looking at the reason Thunderbird holds the Quodpot championship four years running, and you bet your ass I’ll make it a fifth.”
“And this is meant to be
"Oh," said Draco eloquently. "Well, in that case, um, thank you. I–I'm glad that we're friends. Merlin knows I could use someone to talk to that actually pays attention in classes."
Draco sighed and handed his boyfriend the letter. Moments later, Harry gave it back and ran a hand through his untameable-looking hair.
“He never deserved you as a son.”
“I know, Harry,” Draco promised. “And I’m here. I’m not going anywhere. I’m not pretending anymore that there would be anyone else for me. You don’t have anything to be afraid of in the meantime. All right?”
Harry tried, he really did, but he didn't even make it five feet away once the doors closed before he had felt it essential to pin Draco against the wall and kiss him again. There was nothing so good as snogging Draco Malfoy, Harry had recently concluded, and he'd never been the patient sort. There was nothing he wanted to do more in that moment. It was as if he'd been waiting longer than he knew to feel the Slytherin's lips against Harry's own. And the way Draco’s teeth gently pulled on his lower lip, Merlin forbid he would never get used to that.
“Fine,” he started, “but I’m not going anywhere. I’ve things to say and you seem alright to listen. Look. I understand that you’re angry about the task, but I didn’t have a choice. How am I supposed to just let people potentially die in my place? It wouldn’t be... I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if—”
“They’d better,” said Harry. “Took them bloody long enough to get together.”
"I know you miss being his friend."
Joshua glared at him. “You think I’m bad? That bastard Stevenson would take all the credit, and does. Thinks he’s a gift to mankind.”
Hermione personally hadn’t known much of Luna Lovegood before Parkinson had introduced them all, but all signs thus far said she was a lovely friend to have.
“Nevermind that, as I was saying: you’ll tell me. And soon. Understand?”
Harry turned his head to the side to look at the other man. He wasn’t looking at Harry, just kept staring at the ceiling.
A whole world of emotions went through Hermione at the sound of his voice, but eventually she settled on a mix of confusion and concern. “Granger? Since when do you call me that anymore?”
"Do please get a hold of yourself Granger!" Snape demanded. "Twenty points from Gryffindor for this absolutely unnecessary display!"
, his arms leaking streams of blood onto pristine flooring.
were everywhere—he should know, seeing as he'd been one—and Harry had been front page worthy many times before. Now that everyone knew he and Draco were bent? Yes, everyone knew. Absolutely everyone. And Draco wasn't the least bit bothered by it. Or he wouldn't have been, if everyone didn't very much include his parents.
“And I was promised that I would be returned to my full power and glory. Look at me, Wormtail. Do I look as though I received what was promised?”
Harry wasn’t paying attention, though, distracted by the moving boxes strewn about. “What’s all this for?” he asked curiously.
"Made what easier?"
"I already told you a million times—"
"I don't understand anything," he whimpered.
"Would you stop interrupting m–what do you mean
"Harry?" Hermione whispered, and Harry pulled his eyes away from Draco's retreating back in order to look at her.
A soft smile lit up Draco's face. "Wasn't too long ago you'd of agreed with me on that."
"I don't think I'll ever be used to that," Pansy absently informed no one in particular.
"Sorry Harry," Parkinson said. "Not used to it."
"Is that so?" Harry asked, biting his lip a bit and leaning close to him. Draco knew it really wasn't on to kiss with a very literal, bated-breathed audience, and it was as though Harry read his mind in the last moment. He seemed to meet everyone's eyes at once. "You lot waiting for a show or?"
What need was there, he’d concluded far too quickly, when Draco wasn’t
“Thanks,” Harry said, trying not to show the full force of his relief. He would have felt like a right bastard if she’d been serious. Especially since he hadn’t given her specifically much thought.
“Show him, Cos,” Maria said gently.
The entire group got very quiet. A beat later, Ron grabbed his empty glass and stood up. Pansy raised her own glass in manner of toast, knocked it back, and made herself scarce as well. Harry grabbed Draco’s hand and followed after his friends, glancing back once to confirm neither Neville nor Blaise had moved.
The truth of it was, even after half a year, Harry was still not altogether used to there being another Malfoy. Merlin, he was not even necessarily used to there being multiple
..... Okay. Oh my God. Okay. Long author’s note coming at you.
Right, Harry thought. It had never come up. And, he realised, he'd never told any of his Slytherin friends about the Marauders Map either.
His father had made certain Draco could hold his liquor quite young for social reasons, but he was a ways past pleasantly buzzed by the time he realized Potter and Weasley were sitting at their table, clearly sulking, the Patil twins nowhere to be seen. The weasel was glowering in Granger's direction, though she seemed entirely too delighted being in the arms of Viktor Krum to notice—and wasn't that unexpected. Who knew Granger had taste?
Draco sighed and rolled over to look at his barely-at-the-moment friend. "Oh please, you're like seven percent Veela if I'm being generous, creature of the night my arse."
“Shhhhhh,” Hermione and Harry both hissed at the same time. They each instinctively looked around then, double checking that no one was in the common room to overhear.
“Lavender…”
“You’ve… what you’ve put him through is unforgivable, you realise. I can’t imagine I’d
Harry took Draco's hand and the three of them walked over, Hermione still grinning.
“Merlin, is it too much to ask that you just put yourself first for once?!” Draco demanded, wincing at the hurt so plain in his voice.
Orion and Walburga’s single remaining legitimate son, Regulus—incidentally the only one of Bellatrix’s relatives that might have then contended for the title—had been reported missing by his elder brother only three days following the murder of his aunt and uncle, and had since been presumed dead.
Ayesha had her arms around him, her face pressed to his chest. After a moment of surprise, Harry tentatively hugged her back. He rested his chin atop her head, his body relaxing instinctively.
her!” she hollered. “You’ve spoken to Granger all of once! In case you’ve not noticed, we aren’t the same people, Harry! You’re not the Chosen One,” she began, exaggeratedly ticking off her fingers. “Neville doesn’t spend his days dallying amongst the plants, Draco doesn’t have a criminal record, and I’m fucking well not a bloody dead girl! You’ve not the first fucking clue who Granger is!”
"I mean, not now that I've seen the way you look at him."
the love of my life. That’s
possibilities that normal people have no interest in pursuing. You were under the unfortunate impression that they would actually provide answers to the hypotheticals they no doubt lobbed at you—with no shortage of threatening hysterics I’m sure—to obtain your cooperation, yes? It won’t happen,” she informed him, almost pitying. “Answers, definitive ones of the nature they so doggedly seek, are not found in months, or even in years. There is no sense in relying on the Department of Mysteries for guidance on anything that might be considered urgent. It would be folly.”
As though it could sense Harry’s gaze, it looked up and locked gazes with him. Harry’s forehead burned something awful, and he used all his willpower not to clutch it. He knew then, this was Voldemort.
It was true that his flat was chic, thoughtfully decorated, and something that was entirely his own. That had been the point after all: somewhere to seclude himself, to be his own man—which was really just a prettier way of saying that it was somewhere he could best avoid his family.
Harry and Malfoy were far better than any of the newcomers on the pitch, including the other Houses. When the supervisors first released the snitch, Harry caught it within three and a half minutes, and Malfoy actually cheered him. The blond was truly far better with a quaffle than he’d ever been with a snitch. Harry even found himself wondering if Gryffindor would have won less matches, had Malfoy been playing the right position.
Hermione herself was doing her best not to laugh, Pansy and Luna seemed to be doing the same. Harry was biting his lip, looking rather flushed. Grey eyes finally met green, and the air seemed to electrify between them. Draco swallowed and looked away.
the unobservant one,” Harry scoffed.
“Harry.”
Harry went completely still. In his mind, Harim’s low whistle echoed, and went determinedly unacknowledged.
“Hate to interrupt, but everyone’s ready for you now,” she told them. “Merlin, you are a gorgeous bride.”
“Not for you.”
"You will shut your repulsive little MOUTH!" Lucius shouted.
Harry couldn’t fully meet his eyes. But he was having trouble looking away. “Yeah, um. I’m sorry, it’s just I was stupid to forget a sweater. Just cold, s’all. We can go on in now,” he told his sister.
He was grateful that Draco and Hermione had informed him in such detail what the gillyweed would do, or he might have been distressed to find himself with gills and unable to breathe above water. As it was, he slid below the surface and began to swim, sweet oxygen ever present in his lungs. For what felt a long while, he carried on like that, growing more and more conscious of the time as well as worried he would run out of it. Those concerns quickly became secondary, however, when something latched on painfully to his leg. The water was murky, but it was still easy enough to make out the demon-like grindylow. For a moment, he thrashed against the creature before making for his wand. He finally grabbed hold of it, two more grindylows having emerged and taken hold of him in the meantime.
With that, she left, giving him a quick peck on the cheek on the way out. If he wasn’t already aware they’d been a relatively close-knit group, the casualty of the gesture would have made it clear.
Hermione, dejected, returned her thoughts to house elves.
Draco's head snapped towards the other boy so fast he nearly made himself dizzy. "A plant?" he repeated dumbly.
Next moment, Bagman's booming voice hit them. "It seems all the Champions are ready for the second task, which will start on my whistle. On three. One.... two.... three!"
“Boy or girl?” Draco asked by way of reply.
“Crazy Death Eater bastard chopped off his own hand for that maniac and now I think he’s bleeding out,” Draco told him, all business.
The only safe option Harry had was to go with his gut and hope it didn’t get Neville into even deeper trouble. Extreme trepidation gathering within him, he apparated out.
“I think I’m actually glad to know Quidditch is less popular here,” Malfoy told him when the whistle signaled the end of that session.
she screeched, the calm she’d held to the past fifteen minutes snapping completely.
She looked at him sadly, and reached out to pat his shoulder. "Maybe Harry will have an idea," she attempted to sound comforting. "This is
It was really no wonder he’d felt so inexplicably lonely sometimes, he thought.
Matt rolled his eyes but reached out so his hand hovered by the cup. “On three then?” he asked, earning a nod from the others. “One… two… three.”
"My mum says that all the time," she answered him as she brushed herself off.
Hey all! I’m putting a little warning here because there is a smidge of what one might call ***adult content*** in this chapter, so beware if that’s not your cuppa!
“It is back,” the Dark Lord said softly then, still sounding laboured. Draco decided he didn’t want to see what the monster looked like just then. “They will all have noticed it… and now we shall see… now we shall know…”
“Am I missing something?” he asked.
“It’s half past three,” said Hermione.
"Granger," he spit, pulling his arm from her grip. "Something you want?"
forgiving you. I’ll not allow you to make him feel lesser again.”
Harry thought.
“So,” said the blond with false nonchalance, “Thursday, it seems.”
The Gryffindor let out a long, exasperated breath. “Because he hates me, alright? I don’t talk about them because they hate me.”
There was minor grumbling to just turn the music back on, however, and Harry didn’t necessarily disagree.
th time.
"But I'm having fun," Luna sighed.
Harry and Ron were having a discussion with Neville about something, and Malfoy took his eyes off of Harry for a moment, long enough to notice that Hermione's eyes were on him. Her eyes met those of steel grey and she took the opportunity to attempt an encouraging smile. It had the opposite effect, and she watched as Malfoy’s eyes widened just slightly, seeming to say
“No,” she said, her tone defeated even as she said, “That’s me.”
“Theo,” Draco began sternly. “You’re my friend. I don’t want this between us. I want to move on. And for that I need you to stop feeling guilty and let it go, alright?”
“Hm, indeed. But,” she’d countered, “he has deliberately withheld the bulk of his memory base from you, has he not? He has even offered some to you at will. That speaks to complicated mind magick, keeping oneself confined to a certain amount of mindspace, if you will.”
Maria promptly punched him in the side. “Shut up,” she hissed at him.
Lucius scowled. “Must you always be so difficult?” When Draco didn’t bother to reply, his father spoke the next words through gritted teeth. “Yes, even though you’re a... shirtlifter.”
Then Malfoy stood up, abandoning his half eaten meal and left the Great Hall without so much as a goodbye to his friends. Neither of them appeared concerned, likely used to melodrama. It was now or never, Hermione decided and darted quickly out after him. She heard Ron say something, but ignored it. Who knew when she would have another chance to speak to Malfoy privately.
Wordlessly, Harry shook his head.
The only time he even acknowledged Harry’s existence was during Potions class, where he had no choice. And even then it was just lifeless orders about how to cut some ingredient or stir correctly. People pretended not to watch them, but Harry could feel their curious stares on his back almost constantly. Everyone wanted to know what had gone wrong between them, though it seemed the majority of the school had gathered that it was Harry’s fault. Harry’d overheard as much in the library on Tuesday.
wants
There were several gasps at this, and he knew that everyone in Gryffindor knew or would know by morning what had just happened. He sulked towards his dorm room, meeting several wide eyes in the hall on his way, and tossed himself down on the bed, wishing for an entirely different bed down beneath the castle.
And then Draco was laughing, short and helpless, like he was stunned. “Circe,” he said, his smile wide and almost awed. “You haven’t done something even close to this ridiculous for me since we were fifteen.”
“Cosima Taylor, Celine Moore, Anthony Jackson, Emily Hernandez, Tyler Brooks, Jeremy Johnson, and now young Miss Cordelia Gray,” he listed, voice full of an aching regret and responsibility. “I have failed them all.”
“Please,”
"So why tell me now?" Harry asked, feeling as though something we're stuck in his throat.
Luna's head snapped toward the Slytherin girl in an almost comical manner. Hermione swallowed another cackle.
Ron scowled. "S'pose Malfoy just cleared it all up for you then."
“Harry kind of beat him up,” Ron informed him, “said some things to him.”
It was not a lengthy kiss, Draco pulled away after only seconds. He didn’t even say a word, just grabbed his bag and walked out, leaving Harry staring after him. Hermione and Ron did him the favour of not commenting.
“Why are you all standing around it?” interrupted a voice.
Harry stood his ground. “I wish I had a better reason for you. But you would have tried to trap him into telling you something and then you would have gone right to Skeeter.”
Harry ignored the way Ron's shoulders stiffened when Harry said Draco's given name, just as he had been ignoring him all through breakfast. Hermione placed a hand on Harry's shoulder. "It'll be alright," she said.
“I’m s-sorry, Professor,” Hermione whimpered, wiping at her nose.
He pretended not to hear the put-upon sigh that echoed through his head.
The older Malfoy glanced away; Draco thought he must have imagined the flash of regret on his father’s face.
“What’s that got to do with anything, though?” Malfoy asked, sounding a bit strangled.
. He and the weasel would have a spectacular time laughing their arses off about it, I can practically see it now."
(See the end of the chapter for
He was sitting on his sofa later that afternoon when the owl came through.
“Studying?”
"Nonsense," Parkinson said. "Come on, everyone in a circle."
Harry could feel his hysteria rising, higher and higher until, all at once, it collided spectacularly with anger. Here he was tearing at his seams,
“That’s Abby Rollins, Horned Serpent Quodpot captain,” she said, “and soon, she’s gonna be mine.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Malfoy said, first to the black haired girl and then to the blonde,
It seemed that Draco and his friends were taken a bit by surprise, however.
Draco stood silently, not so much as flinching. Severus suspected he might not be listening at all. He also strongly doubted Draco had need to experiment. Despite his anger the previous night, Severus had not been the least bit surprised when Draco's homosexuality was confirmed. It was only that Draco's affections belonged to Potter of all people that turned Severus's stomach. Though even that perhaps should not of been a surprise. Lucius, though, had yet to even address Potter's involvement.
Draco's eyes flashed. "Make me," he hissed.
Draco’s mum turned to Harry then, her eyes soft but concerned. “The Dark Lord, dear. I am so very sorry.”
"Being around you," Malfoy said simply. Harry made a note that Draco Malfoy was honest when he had a few drinks in him.
"I'm fine Hermione," he assured her. "I should be used to this by now, after all. But Draco..."
“He’s innocent Draco,” Harry replied once he was again certain they were alone. “And he’s my godfather.”
That night, in decidedly
When Draco looked at him in alarm, the other boy only waved his arm. “It took both me and Pansy to drag it out of them, and none of us are going to tell anyone anything.”
She smiled brightly at the words. "That I can do."
Draco’d never seen a trained Auror in any kind of real action, and watching Not Fleur fire off spells and solve riddles—with someone else’s wand, no less—likely would have been incredible under different circumstances. As it happened, though, they were both far too reactant to every stray noise to glean any sort of enjoyment from it.
Harry reached out and took Draco’s hand in his. The blond flinched in surprise but didn’t pull it away.
Draco’s eyes sparkled as he squeezed Harry’s hand. “Good.”
He was in the hall a few minutes later when the statue moved aside again to let someone else out. There wasn’t time to even guess who it would be before his father was looking down at him.
“Doesn’t make it suck any less,” he said into his pillow.
Draco shook his head. “It wasn’t,” he whispered. “It wasn’t. I wanted—I just don’t know how,” he let out a frustrated sound. “I’m not saying any of this right.”
It was not altogether a space that indicated much use.
Happy new year everyone!! This update took a bit longer than I had intended. Some stuff has been going on that had me really bummed out, and I just couldn’t motivate myself to write anything. Comfort vibes to you all! :)
"Ask the lunatics who gave it to us," Harry replied, ears still ringing. "What clue we're supposed to gather from that, I've no idea."
“What happened?” he asked Draco when he reached him.
“Draco—”
“So I’m just supposed to be perfectly fine if I end up living without
Harim did not come off as much of a host, for one thing. And for another, there was very little wear and tear on the place. The hardwood floors retained their polish; the plush, centre rug was still the colour of fresh paper; the kitchen’s marble countertop displayed no cracks or scuffs. Dust had begun to collect where his books sat within the wall.
The other two Aurors just nodded dismissively—there was nothing they could do really—and turned their attention back on the cup.
“I shouldn’t have had to,” Harry cut him off, furious. “Everything you said was about Cosima just as much as Cordelia.”
“Of course you can,” she said fiercely, her arms wrapped tightly around him. “Of course you can.”
Joshua sniffed dramatically, completely dry eyed. “That was beautiful, you guys,” he proclaimed obnoxiously.
"Draco," said Hermione. The sympathy in her voice nearly did him in.
you said. Well, I’m talking now. So you best listen carefully when I tell you the very last thing I am going to do is give you anything. I didn’t know you were here, but be assured you’re certainly going to stay. If you’ll excuse me now, I’ve got to get on continuing to fix the shit show that is your life.”
Grey eyes glared at him coldly.
"I'm sorry," Hermione told him.
Also, updating update (lol): from now on, I’m just gonna post when I finish a chapter. Trying to keep a schedule has clearly not been going well of late.
Vaguely, Draco knew Weasley was gaping at him, but he found he couldn't care less. The indecision in Potter's eyes was enough to make it worth it.
But, since Draco was even less in control of himself than usual, his eyes drifted back to Potter. He nearly jumped when he found those enchanting green eyes already trained on him. They flickered away just then, though, and Draco was reminded of Granger's words in the hallway that day.
Voldemort had died again during the battle, Alyssa Cole—the Auror who’d been assigned to take Fleur’s place—had delivered the killing blow. She’d told
“Scrimgeour showed up,” Hermione told him, clinging onto his arm. He resigned himself and slowed his pace as she spoke. “Your mum convinced him to let the Aurors help. He agreed to use Polyjuice and everything just like I said.”
“Say the word,” Harry told him.
Harry had not considered how his interactions with the Department of Mysteries might become more difficult once he had to monitor his level of transperency.
"Fine," Harry said hesitantly, wondering how many times he would lose his best mate before it was permanent. And if this might just be it. "I choose him then."
He wasn’t going to let it happen.
Sirius let out another bark of laughter. “Of course, you’re Narcissa’s son after all.”
Harry’s glasses were not on his face, making the slashes of eyeliner even more effective. It rounded his eyes in a way that reminded Hermione of the muggle rock culture a few of her parent’s friends enjoyed. Harry’s eyes were always rather impressive, but at the moment they appeared nothing short of literal jewels surrounded by the abundance of soot black makeup. Pansy had even gone so far as to attempt to tame his nest of hair, apparently just for kicks, and having—impossibly—some success.
He deliberately kept his gaze locked with Neville’s, trying to force as much sincerity into his expression as possible. Amazingly, it must have worked, because Neville wordlessly did as asked. He watched Harry expectantly, suspiciously.
She merely nodded, already turning. “You take the stage in three minutes,” she said.
“Bloody—”
“I don’t know how much good it’s actually doing,” he admitted afterwards. “But yesterday… I feel like maybe the more she understands the more we can see eye-to-eye, or something. It’s just— I hate drugging up everything from my past.”
that?!" he demanded in a furious whisper.
“Oh um, okay...?” Neville said, like it was a question. Likely because Harry seemed barmy all of a sudden. He cringed to himself; leaving immediately was probably a good idea. Unfortunately, someone else had other ideas. A feminine hand landed on Harry’s shoulder, and he startled.
“I destroyed it,” he told her, looking her straight in the eye. “I destroyed all of it. Every picture I had. Every story I’ve written. I realise that plenty of them have been out in the world for a long time and I can’t take them back, but I can certainly not add to it.”
“... supposed to know —?!”
“I was,” Shelia confirmed, perfectly frank. “I’ve already ascertained based on our short time together that you are operating under several false assumptions regarding your situation. If you want us to be able to move forward to your benefit, you are likely going to need to put aside your preconceived worst-case scenarios.”
Finally, miraculously, the blond looked at him. He didn’t reply, but his eyes shined silver.
At that, her mouth opened into a small ‘o’ of surprise, face slacking somewhat. “Harry,” she said slowly, her voice softened considerably. “Is something going on?”
Luna smiled. "I suppose I can ignore curfew.”
Cosima looked so miserable, he almost kept the last thing to himself. Somehow, though, he forced it out. “But you still go to school here…?”
Harry wished he could punch his former self in the face. “I’ve been an arse,” said Harry, “and I want to try to make it right. All I want is for you to sit back down and let me help you.”
It’s actually finished. We’re at the end. Honestly guys, I debated about this epilogue. I could have wrote like 10, 15 years in the future and talked about Drarry’s gaggle of adopted kids and Pansy+Reg and Ophelia being a Weasley and Amjad being a mind healer and Ayesha being, like, Minister and Neville, man you guys know he’s gonna be a superstar and Harry is gonna have to learn social media when 2009 rolls around and like God just so many things in my mind. But that’s what it comes down to is that I really could honestly keep writing in this little AU I made forever and ever. I could write endless chapters about my precious OCs and altered!characters and odd pairings (we all know they’re odd, it’s part of the fun lol) and everything else. It could be endless. Which is why it had to end. Because this story was for Harry—who I deeply love and this whole fic was almost like my ode to that love if I’m being honest—and this particular segment of his life, and it had come to its natural close. I have had so, so much fun in the year and a half I’ve been working on and the 13 months I’ve been writing and posting this fic. I can’t even wrap my mind around the fact that it’s over. So first and foremost thank you to H, who dutifully read every chapter of this HUGELY LONG fic—it was never supposed to be this long. I’m sorry. I love you. Also to S, thank you so much for your boundless patience with me texting you incessantly like ‘what does this mean?’ ‘How do you say [insert thing I want said]’ ‘what’s a good name for someone [insert age]’ and so on and so forth. Lord, so sorry. Thank you. And thank you of course to every single person who read this fic—especially the ones who commented and/or subscribed to it or to me. The fact that this is marked as complete now is because of you guys. I hope all of you who read and who will read this had as much of an absolute blast as I did. I really set out to write something I wanted to read and it means so much to me that all you guys wanted to read it, too. Also side note real quick: please feel free to let me know in the comments if:  I should add any applicable tags to this fic (I’m terrible at tagging, truly) or you notice any (easily fixable) mistakes. Phew, I think that’s everything. I want to post another fic in the future really a lot. I so hope that reading more Drarry from me is something some of you guys would want because, well, let’s just say I already have a few plans. <3 - B
But we knew exactly what we were doing, and so do you.”
“I can’t tell you what he’s going to do,” Draco said. “I’m literally not allowed.”
"Yeah, I did. I do, I mean," Ron confirmed.
“I came to protect Harry.”
he thought desperately.
Sirius looked awful, incredibly thin in the same clothes they’d last seen him. “Chicken!” he said, voice hoarse.
Draco’s eyebrows scrunched together. “The battle...?”
It was not even a full minute later that Harry’s luck abandoned him, and he was, quite literally, stuck regretting his decision. He had forgotten about the trick step, and his leg had sunk right through, trapping him. Worse, his golden egg had slipped out from under his arm and, in an attempt to catch it, he’d dropped the Marauder’s Map. He’d managed to re-secure the invisibility cloak, but it hardly mattered. The egg had burst open on impact and was now wailing loudly in the corridor below him.
what? “What?” he said aloud.
Draco shook his head back and forth, really only the smallest movement. “Oh Merlin,” he breathed. “I really brushed it off as my imagination.”
She watched fondly as Draco walked up behind her.
"Yeah, scoot over though. We'll discuss everything when the sun's up."
“What if no one could see you?”
He’d not forgotten about Draco’s tattoos. The presence of this one alone did not surprise him.
“I’m sorry,” Harry finally said. “I… things are just really complicated right now and—”
She stood from the sofa and made to walk away, evidently expecting him to see himself out.
“No.”
Credit to:
that it hadn’t been difficult, given Voldemort’s attempt at reincarnation via Dark Magic had gone wrong, leaving him weak and apparently powerless.
“I know what happened between you and Harry,” Draco said, getting right to the point. “He told me it was your Dad.”
And despite the storm this would mean, Harry smiled, even as it occurred to him how much easier it was to know what to do regarding someone else’s issues.
Lucius’s lip tilted up at the corner, the only indication he understood what Draco was saying. He sobered up within moments, however. “Everything I have ever done had been for you and your mother. When I thought that you would be lost because of me...” He looked Draco right in the eye. “I do not have the words to express how grateful I am that you are alive and well.”
at least. But my father was..."
“You know very well that I’m French.”
“That I was still here? That I was
The brown haired boy rolled his eyes dramatically. “I realise there’s been quite a bit more change this year than usual, but I’m fairly certain you’re not a wuss Draco. I can’t believe you actually went and
“Point taken,” conceded Draco.
inform us what’s going on?” Hermione said, apparently out of patience.
“I still don’t see how that’s lucky,” Hermione quipped, low on patience and sleep.
!" Draco whinged.
She rolled her eyes. “I can’t exactly be competing with her all the time. Talk about a lose-lose situation.”
“I think…” Harry started, but he trailed off when something in his periphery distracted him, and his gaze strayed beyond Neville to see what had caught his attention. It turned out to be someone’s white-blond hair, gleaming under a stray light. And of course it wasn’t just someone’s, but Draco Malfoy’s.
Theo leapt nearly a foot into the air, then clutched his hand to his chest rather dramatically. "Bloody hell, mate. You scared the daylights out of me."
It must have been their surroundings that brought the random fact to Harry’s mind. “The first time I talked to a snake, we bonded over our mutual dislike of my cousin.”
Harry did
“What?”
Pansy rolled her eyes. "Please, Draco's been drinking since he could sit upright."
"We need to talk," Hermione said calmly.
of merging.
When he looked up at Draco again, his grey eyes were hard metal. “What else have they done to you?”
Lavender smiled kindly. “Just some tea for us if you would, Giffie.”
as the first chords came through the speakers.
“They’re miles away,” said someone else. “Merlin knows how or why.”
Harry had known that there were even some things the old man had held back, and he hadn’t minded. Now, as he spoke to the boy before him, he wondered if he should have demanded the truth in its entirety, if it’d meant he could have said more right now.
“But we can,” Blaise told him, sharing a conspirators look with Pansy.
Blaise laughed but followed after him anyway.
“But,” Draco annunciated, slamming the tension right back into Harry’s body. “I
Malfoy huffed but didn’t complain as she stood to follow him. Harry’s eyes trailed them as they walked away. Celine was only a few inches shorter than Malfoy, and with their matching robes and pale colouring, from the back, they could have been siblings.
Harry rubbed the side of his head, dismissing his automatic understanding of the unfamiliar word as something he was sure he’d have to deal with later. “So was I,” he said, then sighed. “I just… I feel like I don’t see Remus enough. Maybe we could visit more often?”
"Very well," Snape said at last through his teeth. He seemed to put great effort into turning from them and walking away.
Harry looked toward Draco's empty place at the Slytherin table, and then over towards Snape's, and he wasn't so sure.
The other boy looked incredulous. "No! I'm sure that I'd of remembered something like that."
Now that Harry looked, though, the infamous
Draco pretended not to notice when Hermione shot him a last look of concern. He could handle seeing his father if it meant Harry would be safe again.
Everything he saw was somewhat familiar now; he didn’t have trouble finding his way in the dim light. Dhadhi’s portrait was asleep, snoring softly as Harry imagined her flesh-and-blood counterpart was at that moment, as well.
Sirius sighed. “I wanted to be on the spot. Your last letter... well, let’s just say things are getting fishier.”
to Draco that he found a contentment he’d of never imagined could be had. Telling Draco anything he was thinking at any given time and knowing no judgement would come as a result, that was something unexpectedly gratifying. They’d been together well over five months now, and Draco knew nearly everything about Harry. His reaction to the dementors as well as the incredible pain he felt in his scar at times—the latter of which Draco had the misfortune of witnessing first hand recently, in class no less—being a few examples.
"Yeah."
"Harry," Draco had said, sitting up and nudging the other boy.
Since then, the three had ridden on the coattails of his talent, as far as Harry saw it. It was a year or so before they’d been signed on with the ‘Magical’ sublabel of Sanctuary Records, swiftly receiving high praise by Kirley Duke and Myron Wagtail of the Weird Sisters as being
“I haven’t even gone on yet, mate,” Neville said at Harry’s shoulder. “There’s still time for him to show.”
“No screaming infants in your future then?” Ron asked her.
“You keep saying had,” Neville pointed out after a long moment of silence. “You had. But you don’t anymore?”
The day before the task, he decided he had nothing to lose. Draco was, as he usually was at this time, waiting to be dismissed and pointedly not looking at him.
probably the correct assessment of Harry at that moment. It couldn’t have been more clear that he’d been a shite friend, and a selfish arsehole to top it off.
Malfoy seemed to agree, judging by the gleam in his eye when Harry met up with the group for lunch.
“Oh no, tons,” Blaise laughed. “Mrs. Norris spotted us on the way back.”
Harry furrowed his brow, shrugging at his friends’ questioning looks. The entire audience had perked up, though, awaiting an explanation. There was always going to be a certain charge in the air when something ‘unplanned’ occurred in a setting like this.
“ … and
“Obviously I’m going to pick Blaise, since neither you or Harry would truly allow otherwise,” he said, the closest estimation to a hiss any Longbottom had likely ever produced.
Draco woke the next morning lying on top of Harry on the common room sofa. Even in his limited line of sight, there were various students still asleep on the floor. He pitied them, knowing they’d awake cold and sore and irritated that their fractionally more sober friends had left them unconscious overnight in Slytherin of all places. Draco was grateful he hadn’t had too much to drink.
“So,” Neville continued into the mic, “due to some contracts I had to sign, I can’t really play the tracks you all are probably expecting!”
“Thanks,” said Sirius, sitting down and tearing off a large piece of chicken with his teeth. “I’ve been living off rats mostly. Can’t steal too much food from Hogsmeade; I’d draw attention to myself.”
Nope ;)
and start… sorting myself out. It might take me awhile to do that, but I want to. I want to go to Amjad’s matches sometimes and I want to visit Remus, and Sirius too. I want to go home more often. I’m tired of being this person that everyone hates, so I’m going to try–
"Draco asleep?"
A cry tore its way out of Harry’s throat as Draco’s neck snapped backwards, his grey eyes rolling back into his skull before his body fell to the ground.
Harry caught Draco's eye and the blond, to his relief, nodded his confirmation.
Blaise held up his hands, but only Greg looked properly chastised. Draco sighed.
Malfoy made a pleased sound that seemed involuntary and Harry nearly shivered. He discovered that Malfoy smelled like peppermint and vanilla and ice—if ice were to have a smell. It was a strange combination that Harry would never have thought pleasant before then. As it was, he was currently resisting the ridiculous urge to nuzzle Malfoy's neck and breathe in deeply.
person. You think I’m just going to roll over, become
Neither her nor Remus looked convinced, but thankfully let it go. Harry sternly ordered himself to get it together. How many times was he going to do this?
Now Draco was beginning to catch on. He spoke low enough that no one walking around them could hear. "Are you about to suggest that we steal it from Professor Snape?"
The Gryffindor glanced at the heavens for a moment before meeting his boyfriend’s eyes again. “I’ve survived the summers so far.”
Sheila was different, though. Even though the most they ever did was talk, Harry hadn’t had much reason to deliberately omit anything before now. He’d become used to saying whatever was on his mind, and it was odd not to do so.
Hermione rolled her eyes. "Yes, and?"
“He’s an arse,” he replied, and left it at that.
"But I was
And maybe that was a part of the problem. Harry
The blond looked at him, his eyes hardened. “Why wouldn’t it be? No bodies. Really, I almost admire the culprit,” sneered the Slytherin. “Going about setting the universe to rights without leaving such a mess behind.”
That was a bad idea of insane proportions, he knew. It was safer to make a quick exit and find somewhere to be alone, to sort through this mentally. But she was giving him such a worried look that, somehow, Harry heard himself agreeing. Relief crossed her face. And then they were apparating into his flat.
Harry sunk downwards, back once again resting against the mattress. Draco laid down next to him on his side, rather like how they’d been before Harry had dumbly brought up his first and only trip to the zoo. Only now Draco laid a hand on Harry’s cheek and turned his head to the side, their eyes forced to meet.
But Hermione didn’t get the chance to explain, because just then there was the sound of impact and a splash from behind her. She turned to see Harry, standing in the doorway, a spilled coffee cup at his feet and eyes fixed on Draco.
—the things only Harry knew was between them. The things that this version of Draco never did, and so could not be held accountable for, but that Harry would never be able to forget, nonetheless. Draco—no,
The first touch of his lips on Neville’s and the Gryffindor gasped. Next moment, they were kissing. Deeply. It was like this was oxygen and they’d both been deprived for an impossibly long time.
and, in fact, even younger than him didn’t help his case at all. Because, of course, Harry had faced the Dark Lord before—and wasn’t
Potter.”
"I—what?" Draco's cheeks flushed that delicious shade of pink.
“Salazar, listen to this,” said Draco from where he rested against Harry’s pillows, his voice horrified, “a spell to pull your innards out through the throat.”
Harry sighed as he folded up the letter, bending down to put it with the others in his trunk. His gaze wandered to Malfoy’s bed curtains. They were shut, as they always were around this time. Kyle had fallen asleep on his Care of Magical Creatures book on the bed across from Harry; William was scrawling something in his spiral notebook four beds over, pencil moving rapidly while his brows furrowed in concentration. The sight of the yellow stick and white paper was still an oddity to Harry, but he’d had no shortage of people quick to assure him that they were far more sensible for use—the very idea of using parchment and quill had mystified his fellow students, leave alone the professors.
Draco felt more alert than he ever had before in all his fifteen years, despite that he’d only slept for about three hours. He had to be sure he would beat the crowds, not willing to risk jostling anyone and ending up discovered.
“Granger.”
"Us?" Draco asked carefully.
“No, you tosser,” the other boy said with a roll of the eyes. “Isn’t that your owl coming towards us?”
Draco was looking at the floor, pink cheeked. "I think maybe that's enough for one game."
"Breathe Harry," Draco said, and a tension Harry hadn't realised had been in his shoulders seemed to relax a bit, even as his lungs still ached. There was a sniffle, the only sound to alert Harry that the little girl had also regained consciousness.
Maria rolled her eyes with a tsk. “Never would have taken you two for prudes,” she said.
She'd let him go on a while, trying to keep her smile at bay. After all, she'd been waiting years for that apology, never mind that she'd doubted she'd ever get it.
. “Settling down and having a litter isn’t in these cards, fortunately. I’ll settle for being a brilliant auntie.”
“Genuine,” Blaise scoffed. “Isn’t she, like, a first year?”
Neville did a remarkable job of keeping his expression neutral, but Harry could see the way his face whitened just the slightest bit. “I don’t know what you mean,” he lied.
Harry nodded, and suddenly her lips were pressed against Harry's mouth. A second went by, then two before Fleur pulled away and smiled rather roguishly. It was obvious that she knew perfectly well Harry had felt nothing, and Harry realised that she hadn’t used any of the pull he knew her capable of. It was a gesture of thanks alone. Still, he couldn't quite believe she'd had no problem kissing him, had really kissed him right directly in front of his boyfriend. His boyfriend whose eyebrows had raised, one slightly higher than the other and had opened his mouth just so in genuine surprise. A glance at Hermione revealed a bit lip and sparkling eyes. Finally, he looked back at Fleur, who smiled gently now in true admiration before turning to head over to where the judges were conversing.
For the next half hour or so, the five of them discussed everything they knew about Bartemius Crouch, his history and connection to the Death Eaters as well as all that had happened so far this year. When Ron mentioned Lucius Malfoy—looking surprisingly apologetic about it—Draco admitted that his father had been among those masked at the World Cup, which Harry had all but been sure of already. Draco didn’t know for sure who had sent up the Dark Mark though, only that the Marks on the Death Eaters were solidifying again. But Draco hadn’t had any real contact with his father since December, so he had no way of knowing what was going on on that side anymore. His guess work, though, seemed to be incredibly helpful to Sirius, despite Draco’s insistence that Snape was likely on the right side of things.
“I just don’t... understand. They’re your family.”
song!”
“Always good to see you,” he said, “and you too, Harry.”
issues, yeah?”
"Who's this?" Draco wondered aloud.
“Well, we’re obviously not the real Champions, but this is still the real final task. Whoever wins this takes it all and they weren’t here to compete for themselves. So it’s up to us, wouldn’t you say?” he asked.
“Oh,” he said. “I’ve finally died, then.”
“Hi.”
“You don’t know what you’re talking about.”
wanna be here for that.”
"You wanted to talk?" Harry prodded.
"Got lost!" The Hufflepuff mouthed, looking rather panicked, and then proceeded to pull out a knife and cut at the ropes binding Cho. She came free a lot quicker than Harry was able to release Draco, and Cedric grabbed hold of her and began swimming away.
For one thing, he very much doubted that would work the way she thought it would. Things were… strange when Harim had any control, as evidenced twice now. But he had absolutely no intentions of a third occurrence happening any time soon. Or ever, he swiftly corrected mentally.
It turned out that Joshua really was quite good at Quodpot. He and Matt were the last survivors of the initial match, playing with forty-four, double than what was normal—though being co-captains, neither of their spots were actually at risk. They were apparently meant to be supervising, but getting carried away. “Like always,” Cosima informed them.
Some might be on good terms with Harry, like Daphne or Dean, but Draco surely wanted to spend his birthday with a greater number of people. And it wasn’t like he could roll out the welcome mat for an entire party, if that was what Draco had wanted. Harry didn’t even know if Draco still considered
You and Brown have until tomorrow morning to put the Longbottom story on my desk, Skeeter had said. Him and Brown. Lavender was his partner, but she didn’t know what he knew, or she wouldn’t be here.
“Since you
If he was honest, he’d assumed that Harim’s other friends weren’t worth knowing, if based only on the limited memory and minimal interaction he’d had with them.
The Slytherin hadn’t so much as glanced Harry’s direction all weekend, which meant there’d been no change. He’d had nothing to go on, no indication anything he’d said had gotten through. Until now, that was. The very possibility was startling.
Harry’s fist moved blindingly quick. He was aware that he could have made this simple, could have pulled his wand and cast any number of awful hexes. But there was nothing so satisfying as the crunch of Malfoy’s nose as it gave to the pressure of Harry’s punch.
“Erm,” he started. “I mean, we’ve had coffee, and I- I invited him and his friends out with Neville and I.”
“I don’t think I do,”
“I’m not trying to mark my territory or anything like that, so don’t give me that look. But you need to understand something. I love him, and if you start up toying with his loyalties one more time, I will slice you from your neck to your bits and feed your innards to Mrs. Norris. Got it?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I suppose not...” Harry admitted.
“What?”
Draco had woken up to discover himself on the floor of the potions classroom, one Harry Potter asleep with his head on Draco's stomach.
It was easier being here, wasting time, not having to deal with his own problems.
All at once, Hermione understood. “Oh,” she said brokenly. “So I was there, then.”
Harry stopped that train of thought immediately. For all the innuendo and shameless talk, he knew neither of them would be quite ready for
Again, she hummed.
, Harry thought. Snape made his way over to Neville and began his usual tirade, made that much more severe by the horribly destroyed potion in front of the boy. "You are an embarrassment, Longbottom," Harry heard the greasy man say at one point, just after he'd taken another twenty five points from Gryffindor House, and Neville just accepted the complete tongue-lashing stoically. Or more like he was used to it. Harry gritted his teeth and, just when Snape had
When Theo didn’t reply, Draco looked back over at him. The other boy looked dangerously contemplative.
The carpet was comfortable, Harry thought, fingers brushing minutely through the coloured wool. He was currently lying on Neville’s carpet, languid, eyes fixed on just one of the framed vinyl records hung high on the singer’s bedroom walls.
The office itself was understated, the entrance to which hadn’t even been hidden. It led Harry to believe that there must be another room somewhere that the Headmaster actually used. This small place, though quaint and nicely furnished, was certainly not one to be occupied for hours on end.
He nodded, and she began to turn away. "Um Hermione?" he asked.
New determination overtook Harry, and he swam faster toward the music, soon coming upon a large rock in the muddy water ahead. It had paintings of various merpeople on it.
“What’s going on?” Harry asked. “I can’t see a thing.”
Neville paled, looking round at the company and realizing his very limited options at the same time Blaise did, judging by the appearance of his devilish grin. “In front of everyone?” Neville squeaked.
Draco had no way of knowing what the reply would have been, as Hermione chose that moment to suddenly shout, “Polyjuice!”
Draco nodded curtly, trying not to show how relieved he was at the news. It was better than what he’d been imagining, but he didn’t want Harry thinking that meant it was alright.
Harry met his eyes, unable to stop smiling. “It wouldn’t matter.”
"It's not my support that Draco needs. But I do, my dislike of the Potter boy aside."
“Oh Master… thank you, Master…”
“Bloody hell, this is not a soap drama. I didn’t ask for your
"That's not funny," the blond hissed.
Harry chuckled and left off towards Draco's dorm.
Harry’s attention had snagged, though. “End your tenure?” he repeated, unreasonably surprised. “As in, you’re leaving the Unspeakables?”
She grinned at him mischievously. “Slytherin. Try not to be too disappointed when baby brother wipes the floor with your house, yeah?”
A knot of apprehension formed in his gut as he swam, passing the underwater dwellings and faces of the merfolk that bore little resemblance to the beautiful depictions of mermaids Harry had ever seen. These, instead, were broken-toothed and wild looking, many clutching crude weapons. Harry continued swimming, doing his best not to look at them. That was when he came upon a sort of underwater village square, clusters of merfolk surrounding a giant statue in the middle. And tied to the statue were four people.
“You think she did something to me,” Harry breathed his understanding. “You think I treated you like I did… because she did something to me.”
“My behavior when I learned of your... sexual orientation,” he paused, and Draco did his best not to shift uncomfortably. “It was unacceptable of me to treat you as I did. I know that now.”
Neville shot the dark skinned boy a weary look, seemed to steal himself, and stood up. “Come on.” He sounded nothing more than resigned.
“That wasn’t real,” Harry told him. “Do you remember the battle? Getting hit with the curse?”
That time, Harry utterly failed to prevent a flinch.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Right, of course,” Hermione said briskly, and then shifted to more fully face the room. “Well, as Ginny has now so kindly brought me something else to attend to, I suppose I’ll just have to make the announcement so you can all get on going home as everyone clearly wants to.”
It had all been quite exciting, but nothing compared to the feeling of waking up thursday morning to the promise that Harry could fly today.
“Oh is it?”
It was about an hour or two later that they were all getting ready to head to their respective homes for the night. Harry had already said goodbye to a smiling Draco and had wished him a happy birthday for the
Harry smiled. "Sorry."
Harry's mind seemed to go blank for a moment, his jaw was somewhere beneath him. What on earth kind of scheme was Malfoy playing at? Perhaps there was someone hiding with a camera somewhere, and Malfoy was trying to make Harry look bad now that people were no longer insulting him on his way to class. Well, Harry wouldn't have it. And he was tired of being mocked.
So while Harry filled Sheila in on the events of the past few days, he made sure to brush over anything that might lead in that direction. It proved easier than he’d expected, much to his relief. He had plenty of happenings with which to drown out the need for certain minor details.
