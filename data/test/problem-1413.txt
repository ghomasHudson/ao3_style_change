Just because he could, he placed a kiss on the bare skin of Draco’s neck, just beneath his ear, and then moved so his chin rested on Draco’s shoulder, the soft wool of Draco’s scarf scratching at his cheek. He smiled briefly at the wizard behind the stall who was waving his own hands about just as enthusiastically, apparently delighted to have found someone intelligent to converse with.
His rich friends weren’t the only ones who had things to make up for. Most of them would be lucky enough to earn back society’s respect with donations and charitable acts. Draco had much more to work off, many more horrible acts that he needed to atone for and there were still times when he didn’t even think his work with the Ministry could make a dent in that list.
She imagined it was harder now when he saw Harry with Draco who was possibly richer and just as good looking and even if his fame was more infamy, he was still rich and famous and powerful. He was Harry’s equal in ways she and Ron could never be (that she at least never wanted to be), and she could only imagine how that made Ron feel. Ron who had struggled to see beyond his second-hand clothes and his attitude that everything he owned was “rubbish”. Ron who struggled with being stood in Harry’s shadow even when Harry never cast him there.
And he didn’t know how to explain that to her when he didn’t want to explain it at all. There were pieces of himself he owed nobody, ones that he’d chosen to share with Draco because, it turned out, once he started talking to Draco he didn’t know how to stop. Everything with Draco was easy, even when it was hard. There were moments in those early days, when all he wanted to do was punch Draco in the face or hex him, but he kept going back. He kept seeking Draco out and Draco always welcomed him.
Harry had never bothered to ask. He’d listened to Draco wax poetic about a curse he’d come across in a book from the Manor library and after he’d lost the will to do anything more than gaze at Draco with a glazed (though adoring) expression, there’d really been no question Draco found the subject fascinating. It was unexpectedly thoughtful of Hermione to ask. Which was probably why he gave her a straight and honest answer promptly, rather than being vague and fluttering a dismissive hand.
Ron paled beneath his freckles as Harry’s eyes locked on his before they flicked back to Draco. He didn’t have the energy to keep arguing, he just wanted Draco to be okay. It had been petty to throw Ron’s own words back at him and it didn’t make Harry feel better, but he wanted Ron to understand. He wanted his oldest friend to realise that he was wrong and that those words he’d said after Harry’s first lesson back had a real impact. That they were more than just words being bandied about because there were people out there with the influence to give a throwaway comment like Ron’s real and devastating power.
Draco, who couldn’t think what had happened then to make her think that, wrinkled his nose in thought as he chewed on a greasy, too-salty chip. Eventually he simply asked her what had given her that impression.
He and Draco had built something real out of pieces of their shattered lives and Harry didn’t want Ron and Hermione trying to call that into question. He didn’t want them giving him looks and asking about potential enchantments and suggesting he see a mind healer because he wasn’t acting like himself. Although, at least he could turn around and tell them he had seen a mind healer and despite her voiced concern over the choice of Draco, she had been happy with the way he’d been opening up and letting new people in.
He'd had similar thoughts before, but the more Draco knew about how the muggle world worked, about the advances in technology and culture they’d made, the more he was coming to realise that the magical world had stagnated in so many ways.
Merlin, why couldn’t he be a happy drunk? Why did he have to wallow in melancholy and the past? ‘I want to hate him so much, Pans,’ he whispered and then, ‘Why can’t I hate him?’
, but it didn’t make a fucking difference. He could fight for what he believed, he could work with the whole DMLE and Kingsley’s new people, but nothing had changed.
Harry snorted into his pillow and shifted around to get more comfortable. A sudden soft thump at the foot of the bed announced Athena had decided to join them for the night. For something so small she certainly weighed enough, as she stalked across Draco’s feet to squish herself into the small gap between them. Being only half kneazle didn’t seem to be slowing down her growth and Draco expected that, given time, she’d grow to be just as big – if not bigger – than Granger’s grumpy looking mess of fur. Merlin knew what kind of pedigree Crookshanks had but Athena came from a proper breeder and a lineage to be proud of.
They fell into an awkward silence after that. For a while there it had been easy to forget why they were here, what they were doing, and just get swept away by the memories and the events. It had almost felt like they’d been catching each other up on missed moments. As though he were telling Pansy about something Blaise said in a class she’d missed or an exchange he’d missed because of an ill-time bathroom break.
‘McGonagall was worried I’d be attacked in my sleep,’ he explained as she looked around the room with interest.
Granger was deeply intrigued; Draco didn’t much care, if he were honest. The implications that this new Ministry would serve him better were already showing in the lessons he was having with Bill and Head Auror Robards’ open acceptance of his place in Harry’s life. He’d already received an owl from the Minister himself talking about the changes that would be made, assuming Wizengamot approval, to the terms of his parole. According to the formal letter sent “from the desk of the Minister for Magic”, Draco could look forward to just a year of parole assuming he continued to prove himself a lawful citizen eager to prove how much he’d changed. Not to mention the actual offer of employment at the termination of his parole period.
For Pansy, Harry smiled. This smile had teeth. ‘Yes,’ was all he said. The word was sharp and contained a lot of threat for something so small. It made Draco warm all over. He’d blame the slight flush to his cheeks on the one drink he’d already had.
The fact his stomach rumbled loud enough for Hermione to hear in the quiet of the library gave him an excellent excuse to gather his things and make a quick exit before she could threaten to join him. It was why he urged Harry to turn around and hurried him back to the Entrance Hall when they met coming down the corridor. The last thing he needed was for Hermione to start asking Harry questions, they’d definitely never get to dinner. Or worse, she’d join them and then the entire evening would become about answering her questions rather than just spending time with Harry and Luna.
Also, the effect was somewhat ruined by the nasally sound of her voice and the tears still making her eyes shimmer. And the weeks she’d spent fuming over it while Harry had avoided any kind of serious conversation with her. He’d gotten spectacularly good at avoiding talking to Granger and Weasley about anything of importance, although he hadn’t bothered to conceal any actions of importance. It was hardly Harry’s fault (or Draco’s) that the two Gryffindors had been stubbornly ignoring all the signs Harry had made no effort to conceal that they were in a relationship.
Harry, eyes on Draco’s back where he stood alone contemplating the ward, listened as Bill ran through what they’d tried and what they needed if they were going to get through.
They must have thought they were getting real friendship, must have been so worried and afraid for him and hurt and confused when he dropped them as though they meant nothing. Because they had meant nothing. He’d watched Crabbe die in the fiendfyre and while he was sad, he didn’t mourn. Not like he should have been mourning, not like he’d lost a friend, someone he loved and treasured. Because he hadn’t, hadn’t been capable of it.
Malfoy looked at Granger and his smile was full of amusement this time, like he had a huge secret that he was bursting to share but this one needed the right kind of moment to share. ‘What do you say, Granger? Up for some tea with an old friend?’
Weasley pulled a face and Draco just knew he wasn’t going to like the next words out of the Gryffindor’s mouth. ‘She said we needed to spend some time getting to know each other.’
‘Uh, thank you?’ He refused to let the compliment thaw him even more than he’d let the open acceptance of his relationship with Draco thaw it. He had perfectly legitimate reasons to be annoyed, damn it.
He’d experienced the muggle world. Spent three days with Harry exploring muggle London, learning things he’d never considered before, all in the name of fixing Harry’s wardrobe and showing the Ministry he was willing to change. He’d enjoyed the ability to walk around without being spat on or without fear of being cursed but it hadn’t been the same. It really was just running away, and Draco refused to be the kind of man who ran from his problems.
Professor Joseph arrived just after the last student settled in and Draco observed the way some of the students straightened up in their seats (Granger amongst them) and how Joseph’s eyes trailed over the class. He saw it the moment the man realised Harry was there because he did a double take and then tried to recover without anyone being the wiser. It was far from a smooth movement and Draco chuckled under his breath.
The hand he’d had clenched in a tight fist around the sheets (which didn’t help much as it caused a fresh wave of pain through his shoulder) relaxed long enough for her to grab hold and squeeze.
It wasn’t exactly the ending they’d planned for their day, but it was hardly surprising they’d have their plans scuppered by an inconsiderate former Death Eater or three. Although which one of them had sent the call out and why there hadn’t been more to respond was a question Draco would very much like the answer to. He wasn’t naïve, he didn’t believe for a second that the Ministry had captured all of Voldemort’s followers, but only the four of them responding to the summons seemed a little odd. There were certainly less marked Death Eaters on the loose than marked and, as he and Harry were getting ready for bed, he started to consider ways to capture those, like the snatchers, who had never been marked but would likely still be up for a bit of muggle-baiting fun.
‘No, it’s not that.’ Draco took a sip of his cider before turning to quietly contemplate Harry. ‘We’ve been talking about it a bit, you and I, about all the empty classrooms and the subjects that aren’t taught anymore.’
They stayed silent after those words until Charlie and Marigold approached with Bill and Winthrop. Winthrop, like Charlie and Marigold was loaded down with a heavy backpack, no time for fancy charm work to lighten the load.
‘What the bloody hell are you laughing about?’ Ron demanded. ‘Why is my sister on a date with Draco Malfoy?’ He rounded on Harry for that last bit as though this was entirely Harry’s fault for bringing a Slytherin menace into their lives.
‘The treatment didn’t work,’ she whispered brokenly. ‘Every time it looks like they’re making progress and starting to remember, the memories start to slip away.’
Peering down at his foot and trying to keep as still as possible, Draco watched as Harry waved his wand over the bear trap – which growled at him and dug its metal teeth in further.
An exchange which, judging by the way Harry was starting to squirm, had been mortifying. That still didn’t explain the other spells Harry knew – or anything Harry knew about gay sex for that matter. He’d been awkward and nervous but he’d understood the basic mechanics of it all. He couldn’t imagine Fred had gone over that before he’d died – how would he have known it was needed? He could absolutely imagine George sitting Harry down and making the process as humiliating as possible just because he could, but George hadn’t even known about their relationship until they’d visited him at the shop with –
‘What?’ Harry’s eyes stared beyond Kingsley, the only one to break the silence in the conference room. ‘What did you say?’
She surprised him by saying, ‘Being a good student doesn’t necessarily mean you’d make a good teacher.’ She studied him thoughtfully. ‘Is that what you want to do? Teach?’
Most importantly, Harry would be able to cross the wards in a heartbeat to help Draco if something went wrong but until then, he could go back to dealing with the aurors and the witches incapacitated on the lawn. Keeping the muggles from figuring out what was happening was, thankfully, not Draco’s problem, either. He could see some of the neighbours starting to poke out of their homes now that the fighting was done. He blocked out all of that and with a deep, calming breath, he set about identifying and pulling down the first of the wards.
It could have been worse, he supposed. They could have taken his wand, shoved him face first into the pavement and shackled him like the other two Death Eaters. Instead, he wound up sat on the freezing cold curb, hands cuffed behind his back with the basic runed cuffs, and a twitchy looking junior auror he’d also never met before standing guard over him. Draco was getting the impression that all of his usual aurors had pulled New Year’s duty instead.
Draco had been keeping a list of the weird ways his and Harry’s magic interacted, starting with the way they could switch wands at a whim building up to the way Harry’s accidental magic could shield him and now it would need to include the way his magic latched on to Harry’s, was welcomed by Harry’s, until it could exist with his in such a way as the runes on his neck.
Because, before they reached that point, they had to deal with the rest. They made plans. Plans and contingencies and more plans. They plotted and lied and stole away for quiet moments. They planned some more. Honestly, Harry was about ready to pull his hair out by the end and more often than not, when they were together, planning slipped their minds and they took solace in each other.
‘It does!’ Ron protested, shoving his hand toward Harry who was obliged to take a sniff at Ron’s extended hand.
Ron nodded, not stopping to question how Harry knew that. He was about to ask a question about Harry’s wife – was it someone he knew? – when the door popped open and the head of Ron’s assistant (Ron would later learn she was less his and more the only one who kept the department running because no one liked to do the paperwork) was poking around the door. Ron looked at her expectantly but she spoke to Harry instead.
talked about Kingsley’s role. The front page of the paper gave over to a large picture of Kingsley standing in the Ministry Atrium holding a Ministry-wide meeting. Draco had (thankfully) not been forced to attend that (perks of technically being a tool of the Ministry and not a paid employee) but Arthur had and somehow, in the midst of their arranging the portkey to trick Harry into returning to his auror training, Draco had found himself discussing the changes at the Ministry and offering
Draco refused to flinch away even if getting such an up-close look at Weasley was disgusting. ‘Yes.’
He hadn’t exactly been planning to stop an attack but given how much notice the Ministry liked to give him before they came to take him out for a job, he’d gotten very good at improvising when it came to evidence collection. Although, the MLE was well behind the muggle police when it came to that sort of thing. He’d read a couple of books on the subject after Harry had sat him down in front of a television and showed him a sampling of what the muggles liked to watch. The muggles used sealed plastic and paper envelopes and little plastic numbered cards but in the wizarding world, MLE officers tended to use random scraps of paper, stared long enough to form a solid memory and then the lot got scooped into a box – charmed of course, just in case anything in there was spelled.
. It didn’t seem to matter that almost all the Weasleys were friendly and supportive, watching Harry turn away from Granger cemented his belief that Harry would choose him, no matter what the circumstances.
He didn’t know how to do any of that, wasn’t sure even the power he wielded as the Chosen One could attempt such a thing, but there was one thing he could do. Or rather there was one thing he could refuse to do.
‘All of them?’ Draco questioned even as he looked beyond the two to the others beyond them. An unbroken line of repeated actions. Pairs of auror and curse breaker all repeating the last actions before something was triggered and time froze and looped around them.
‘You don’t.’ This time Draco’s words were snapped, and Harry could feel the same argument they’d been having for days returning for round four.
Molly was attempting to feed him a third slice of pudding when the growl had all of the hairs on the back of his neck standing to attention. It was a deep warning growl that spoke of danger, one he felt echoing deep within his chest rather than heard with his ears. He froze, cutting himself off in the middle of a protest about being full (so full) and, confused, he glanced at Harry. Sat beside him, Harry had frozen too. For just a moment Harry sat completely still and then Draco watched, baffled, as Harry raised his left arm. After a long beat of staring in bewilderment at his arm, he tugged the sleeve down and boggled at the tattoo of the large dog.
She looks like she’s going to snap again but something about his calm tone helps her keep a lid on her anger and she nods.
If Hermione noticed the look, she might actually enjoy the lecture and as much as Draco would probably get a kick out of it too – dinner.
The suspicious look Draco cast that particular letter from home had Longbottom asking him if everything was okay. Not seeing any reason not to, he’d explained just what the letter from his mother had been about and Longbottom had enjoyed a laugh at Draco and Harry’s expense.
Draco gave a dark, humourless chuckle. ‘We were right to think he was a senile old fool,’ he told her. ‘He never cared if I lived or died as long as I played my part.’
Then again, maybe it’s not. Maybe she’s going to require a little bit more because she’s looking at him like he’s lost his damn mind and also like she has no fucking idea why she should even be listening to him.
And if Harry Potter could wield such darkness, then what was the point? Where was the light and the dark? Where was the line that Draco had crossed?
‘Granger,’ he greeted in return. He was perfectly civil, though not what anyone would call friendly, when he offered her the tea pot. ‘Tea?’
Sprawled as he was, half on and half off the bed, Draco could only snigger a laugh as Harry stumbled off the bed, hopping naked around the room as he tried to stretch out the cramp in his calf. He deserved the pillow to his face, he’d admit, but what else was he supposed to do? At least they’d both gotten off before the cramp had set Harry stumbling around in pain.
Draco hadn’t been offended like he once would have been. There really hadn’t been any pining then. Plenty of other things but he wouldn’t characterise it as pining. He’d been too much of a selfish prick to pine over Harry – romantically at least. He’d been a right sod over the whole scorned friendship thing, he would freely admit that. He
‘I can’t,’ the junior auror denied – making him all the more the fool for not realising it wasn’t a request and that he should absolutely be taking the cuffs of the apparent Death Eater because, in case he hadn’t noticed, the three that had been arrested on scene had already been transported and didn’t he think it odd that Draco hadn’t?
About the only thing he could remember clearly from that evening was Narcissa softly saying, ‘Albus Dumbledore did not do right by my son or you, Mister Potter.’
The sudden shift in his thoughts puts things a little better in perspective and he realises that, yeah, he’s being an arsehole, but he needs to say this and he needs her to understand that just because there’s a baby between them doesn’t mean that their problems are fixed.
It wasn’t. She and Ron tried to talk to him, tried to get an explanation out of him but he didn’t seem to think the details were important.
Narcissa had done what she could, enlisting Snape under the power of an Unbreakable Vow (and Merlin even Bellatrix had helped her with that – crazy insane Bellatrix had helped protect her nephew). In the end, when she’d finally seen a chance for it to all end, Narcissa had lied directly to Voldemort to save her son (and saved Harry and possibly the entire world – wizarding and muggle – in the process).
Today it wasn’t. The street was in chaos. Aurors in their hideously impractical scarlet robes were snapping spells back at a group of four witches standing on the lawn of an apparently ordinary muggle house that looked the same as every other house on the street. Another two wizards were attempting to fire spells at the aurors’ backs from the other side of the street, where they’d hidden behind a car parked at the curb.
Both Harry and Granger looked at him, eyes searching for any sign he wasn’t alright and that this should wait and the very fact that Granger was looking at him that way truly drove home how important Harry was to her. She had every reason to distrust him, every reason to hate him for what he’d done to her and the people she loved but here she was being nice to him, showing understanding when rightfully she should have whipped out her wand and hexed him six ways from Sunday. All she had to go on was a tattoo, his friendship with Luna and Harry’s friendly behaviour, but it seemed that, for the moment, that was enough for her to reserve judgement.
‘The incantation is simple enough,’ Joseph began. He demonstrated to the class the basic wand movement and correct pronunciation. Draco was sure he was the only one who caught the narrowing of Joseph’s eyes when he realised Harry wasn’t paying any attention to him, rather he was rubbing at a smudge on his wand with the pad of his thumb.
She’s sat at the kitchen table, eyes distant as she looks out the window, ignoring the mug of tea on the table in front of her. His newfound confidence doesn’t falter when he sits down across from her. Maybe he’s a cowered for not waiting until she looks at him, but he needs to say this now, needs to say the words he’s been avoiding for so damn long.
Draco sniggered at that; he could perfectly picture the arched brow of their late Potions professor. The snide look he’d have given her after discovering Pansy sat alone in some bushes. He much preferred that than Snape stumbling across him with his hand down some boy’s pants. Although the sour expression on his face might have been worth it.
‘You didn’t want to see it,’ Draco answered. ‘And honestly, you didn’t need to then. You needed Weasley but you don’t now and as fun as playing with what-ifs is when it’s you and me, this is only going to make things worse.’ He pinched Harry’s side none to gently. ‘You can’t change the past Harry, but you can make sure you don’t make those same mistakes again.’
He had been wrong – of course, he’d been wrong. He’d been more wrong than he could have ever imagined in those little moments hidden away in his room or his dormitory bed. More than any of them had been when they boasted about the Dark Lord and the changes he would bring once he and his followers had taken control of the Ministry and the wizarding world. He’d been wrong all those times he’d boasted of speaking in person to the Dark Lord, of gloating about how the Dark Lord had seen fit to choose the Manor as his home until he took his rightful place.
‘We need Malfoy,’ Robards explained, leaning back in his chair and watching Harry closely. ‘I read the reports of his work. He’ll only be going with Mendenhall and Winthrop from here on out. I can trust those two not to get him killed – if they can help it.’
Hannah offered him a wink over her shoulder while Longbottom looked somewhat torn between offense and amusement. When he turned back, he found Harry and Hermione watching him with amusement and Weasley a grimace.
The soft sound of paws racing toward them had them both falling silent and turning to face the stairs just as a large cat loped onto the landing and shifted to become a slightly out of breath McGonagall. Clutching at an apparent stitch in her side McGonagall strode toward them, lips pursed, eyes ablaze with fury.
Hermione rolled her eyes at the lot of them but took the plastic container Harry handed her with a smile. ‘Oh, this smells amazing,’ she moaned appreciatively, cracking the lid to peek inside.
‘I think I wanted to be your friend once,’ he mused and his words were slightly slurred now, that last swallow of firewhiskey probably a swallow too many.
‘It’s nice to meet you, Carter,’ Harry grinned. He leaned in closer, like he was just about to share a secret and asked, ‘What’s your sister’s name?’
‘Not intentionally,’ Harry assured him, but he dug around in the plastic takeaway bag until he produced a receipt with what Draco eventually recognised as a telephone number written on it.
Kingsley and Robards had agreed to a condensed training program so Harry could join the corps straight after completing his NEWTs (assuming he got the results he needed – Draco had complete confidence he would) which would give Harry the chance to prove he had earned his place just like any other Auror but gave the Ministry their Chosen One and Voldemort Slayer to hold up and show the people of the wizarding world they were going to do better and that things were changing in the right ways.
He might have asked her what but as soon as he focused on her it was obvious. He’d been letting his emotions control his magic again and the temperature in the Hospital Wing was soaring with his fury, the water in the jug beside Draco’s bed was starting to bubble and hiss as it boiled. ‘Sorry.’
The cleansing of the Ministry had eliminated quite a few people sympathetic to Voldemort and even more who thought their pureblood ideals should continue the plan to remove muggleborns. The Department of Magical Law Enforcement had survived the cleansing with half-bloods, returned muggleborns and the sort of purebloods who wouldn’t turn up on a list of acceptable visitors in a home owned and cared for by the Carrows.
‘Yeah,’ Ron butted in, agreeing heartily with the sentiment. ‘She could have sent them to Hermione. She’d be a much better choice.’
There was just something in the way he got so engrossed in it, the excitement that had him babbling really fast at Harry as though he couldn’t wait to share what he’d just learned, that turned Harry to goo and made him appreciate his homework and what the teachers were doing a little bit more.
‘Yeah,’ Harry drawled, ‘I’m not touching on that one.’ He shook his head, apparently marvelling at Draco’s nerve, before he turned his attention to Longbottom who seemed to have lost some of his nerves in the face of his and Harry’s (admittedly) pointless squabbling. ‘Also, bi. Probably.’
Not that Harry could complain, he did enjoy having clothes that fit properly and looked good on him and he had managed to bargain Draco into some incredible jeans that were probably a little tighter than strictly necessary but gave Harry a great view.
‘We’ll split the floors,’ Mustafa declared, watching McGonagall dispatch teams throughout the castle – though not before she checked that they had a firm grasp on the detection spells they would need. ‘Weasley, you’re used to working in dark tombs – you and the missus can take the dungeon to start. Sweep them, map them, and move on up to the ground floor.’
Draco sighed tiredly, it had already been a long day and looked to be getting only longer. ‘Don’t worry about dinner, we’ll sort it out when you get home.’
She couldn’t hurt Harry though. She held her tongue when the hatred boiled inside her and she played nice, and she was nice because there were moments when she saw Draco for what he really was and that wasn’t the boy she’d known.
‘I think, after the war, we needed each other, and we let that need turn into something it was never supposed to be.’
But that tiny window was the only reminder he had that there was a world outside Azkaban. It was his only reminder that this would end, that if he was strong, if he just held on, he would be free of this place.
He takes a deep breath, makes sure he’s looking her in the eye and says, ‘This marriage doesn’t work, Ginny, you’ve got to know that. I’m not happy. Can you honestly tell me you are?’
The smallest bedroom at Number 4 Privet Drive looked the same as it always did in the summer. The small bed shoved in amongst Dudley’s broken toys, the wardrobe that contained the small amount of clothing Harry owned – none of which was in his size. It was hot and stuffy in the room, little breeze coming in through the window he’d pushed open a fraction. Harry lay on his bed, wondering what tomorrow would bring.
Harry laughed. ‘That’s confidence, I think,’ he tried to explain. ‘It was sort of a shock to know that I could touch Ginny and I’d only really started to get comfortable reaching for her when I broke things off. Draco needs the reassurance,’ he stated. ‘He needs the reminder I’m here that he’s not alone in Azkaban anymore or struggling with Voldemort and what it means to be a Death Eater.’
His expression turned soft and confused as he read the words Draco had carefully written and then he was setting the short note aside and pulling the lid off the box.
‘Honestly, the damage wasn’t all that bad, but he’s grounded for a week and we confiscated all of his potions equipment until Hogwarts.’
Barrier spell in place and with a sense of calm washing over the injured muggles, Harry skirted around the fallen muggles to climb onto the small stage at the end of the square. As Draco watched, the familiar white stag swept from the square to deliver a message to the Weasleys, Draco sent his own enormous dog off to the Ministry and then set off a beacon spell because he still didn’t have any idea where he was. Then he sent another call off for emergency medical aide because even just a quick glance told Draco there were some muggles set to spend at least the night in St Mungo’s secure muggle treatment ward.
He felt the air move as Harry turned and he knew from the sudden hiss that he wasn’t going to like what Harry was seeing.
And, fuck, he’s about to be even more of an asshole, he thinks, but he needs to do this, and he needs to say this, and this isn’t at all what he planned when he came through the floo. It isn’t at all how he thought this conversation would go and he needs to talk to Draco about it, can’t go making life changing plans without including the man that is his life, but it could work.
When the post arrived, it was with a pleasant surprise for Draco in the form of a care package from his mother carried by his eagle owl and a less pleasant surprise in the form of a letter with the Ministry seal on it. This one was delivered by a friendly, if old, barn owl who didn’t seem impressed by the long journey and seemed quite content to take a rest on his shoulder before making the trip up to the owlery or back to the Ministry.
Harry looked to Draco for an explanation and then raised his eyebrows when he realised Draco was patting the floor beside him. ‘Old magical house,’ he explained. ‘Do you remember what this house looked like when the Order moved in?’ Not that Draco had seen it, but he could only assume it had been even worse than when Harry had first brought him to visit.
He managed not to start crying again and when he emerged from the bathroom, a mere five minutes after he went in, it was to find Luna had gone for her own shower and been replaced by Ron and Hermione who only looked confused as to why Ginny was seated beside Draco with her wand drawn.
‘Oh, it gets better,’ Draco assured him. ‘They’re requesting we come for a visit today to sign off on the paperwork for the Lestrange vaults and finalise the arrangement on your trust vault.’
It was Hermione’s turn to be taken aback. ‘Really?’ she asked, eyebrows shooting up as she glanced between the two of them.
Draco resisted rolling his eyes, but it was a close thing. ‘We need more teachers and we need new subjects. Harry and I got to talking to a man who makes spell-resistant cutting boards for potion making and he has a better home-schooling plan for his two kids than Hogwarts offers its students.’
‘We make sure every allegeable child gets a letter inviting them to study at Hogwarts,’ Hermione answered promptly.
Harry put his arms around him and murmured reassurances over and over again. A soft litany of, ‘I’m okay, I’m okay, we’re okay.’
Ron, who had no idea what Malfoy had to do with anything – he didn’t work for the aurors, Ron knew that much – was taken aback by the easy way Harry rolled his eyes and dropped his feet to the floor as though he was going to get up and give this more attention than it needed. Ron also had no idea who Rasika was or why Malfoy – he was assuming it was Draco Malfoy they were talking about – would think it was okay to use him as spell fodder at something called the Galahad Estate.
‘The wards around the house wouldn’t let anyone without a Dark Mark just walk through,’ Harry easily explained. ‘Draco painted the runes in blood so the wards would temporarily recognise me.’
‘You can’t kill him,’ Harry murmured but it lacked any real conviction because Ron’s words and actions had hurt and Harry wasn’t feeling especially charitable right now, not with how those words and the feelings they’d spawned in Harry seemed to have triggered a never-ending storm of nightmares.
His impression of Harry Potter didn’t mesh with the boy who had spent all night on the floor beside his bed in a Ministry cell. True, his understanding of what made Harry tick was different than it had been before Voldemort forced him to take the Mark and find a way to sneak his Death Eaters into Hogwarts. The boy he’d thought Harry was would never have turned back in a room on fire to rescue him. (The boy Draco thought he once was would never have lied to his family about recognising Harry). But there was a huge difference between not being able to stand by and watch someone fall to a flaming death when you could do something, and sitting guard over someone you’d never even liked in the bowels of the Ministry.
He sighed tiredly. ‘You’ve been gone nearly twenty years, Granger. We’ve all changed. I promise you’ll be perfectly safe, for what it’s worth.’
But Hermione didn’t know his secrets. She didn’t have an openness about her that let her see what others couldn’t, like Luna did. She wasn’t like Ginny, having been on the outside for so many years, that she’d been able to see things people missed (or had Voldemort take her over and show her how powerful and influential he could be – as
‘How would this even work?’ The words were as close as Draco would ever come to admitting he wanted to be the one.
‘Good for you?’ And yes, Draco was aware that was more question than congratulations but what else did the man want from him? ‘I’m not sure I understand the problem.’
There were times when he remembered a boy who had all the wrong choices forced on him and then had his hopes and second chances yanked away by people who were supposed to be good and if Harry was a little broken, if he was a little distant and cold then that was expected because he’d been forced to do a lot of bad things in the war and Ginny and the kids were maybe his only bright spot but sometimes it just felt so
So maybe there was a part of Harry that would happily let Draco kill Ron. But it was only a small part and it was fuelled mostly by the hurt and confusion because they’d all been expecting Ron to be angry. They’d honestly been expecting him to be furious that Harry was with Draco but none of them had expected the vicious onslaught of homophobic slurs. All Harry had wanted was a chance to explain how it had happened, how much Draco had shown that he’d changed not just said pretty words – hadn’t Ron seen for himself how much Draco had changed? – but all he’d gotten was anger and vitriol until Neville had stepped in and Harry had fled.
‘He’s got you under some sort of spell,’ the Ravenclaw said, eyes widening as though he’d come to a startling realisation. There were mutterings as the other students suggested this made sense and started eyeing Draco even more warily.
And that was when Harry sat down in front of Ron and Hermione and said, ‘I’m about to do something very stupid and I need to you to listen to me very carefully.’ He waited for them to realise how serious he was being before he went on. They needed to understand that there would be plenty of things happening in the next moments and that they would likely understand none of them.
Draco didn’t see how that would fix anything. And so, they were grumpy, and sleep deprived together, and showing up on Pansy’s doorstep to be grumpy and sleep deprived at her had seemed like a better solution than putting Draco’s mother through it for another day and actually what Draco had declared he would really like to do was kill Ron but that would only result in a nice new cell in Azkaban and some truly horrible conjugal visits – no thank you.
‘Owlery,’ he mouthed and she nodded but he felt her gaze on him the whole way out of the common room and when he glanced back at her over his shoulder right before he slipped out the door, she was wearing a soft expression on her face as she looked down at Weasley. It was such an unguarded look from her, one she clearly didn’t mind him seeing, that he was only saved from stumbling out the door by years and years of training and instruction from his mother in etiquette and grace.
They would be missed shortly. Draco’s absence wouldn’t go unnoticed much longer. He was becoming known for the violence and power behind his curses and the other Death Eaters revelled in the chaos he created.
Ginny grinned. ‘Hit him with another tongue-tying jinx the moment he opened his mouth after dinner yesterday. He started in on some really awful things about you while the rest of us were still worrying you were being summoned into a trap and about to die.’ The words were said lightly but there was real concern beneath them, and Draco reached out to squeeze Ginny’s hand.
Draco grimaced distastefully but said nothing. He wasn’t sure there was anything he could say to that. They’d been preparing for this mission for days. Charlie, Marigold and Winthrop had been behind the wards for eight full days before Bill had finally found the last of the curses and it had taken another two days on top of that for them to prepare to make the breach. Draco had spent most of those two days working tirelessly with Harry and Bill to get the harmony of casting in English and Parseltongue perfect and what time they’d had outside of that had been spent lecturing the aurors and Ministry curse breakers on what to expect from the Carrows’ farmhouse of horrors.
Mess might have been a bit of an understatement. The entire wall they’d been walking by had been blown into the Muggle Studies classroom by the explosion, forming an uncomfortable bed of stonework and broken furniture for him to land on. In the dim wand light, it looked like the floor had blown beneath them, sending all of them in different directions.
Ron frowned at Draco but before he could question Draco Malfoy wearing Gryffindor quidditch gear and why they’d been near enough his own that they could be grabbed first, Ginny crawled off the bed and made grabby hand motions for food.
Slughorn made it all the way through his pre-potion instructions and jovial blathering before Harry made an appearance.
She nodded. Reaching for the firewhiskey, she unscrewed the cap and poured a healthy splash into the second tumbler. ‘Are we really doing this, Draco?’ Despite the confidence she’d displayed since the moment she sat down, at her words she seemed to sink in on herself.
‘That’s got to be hard for Ron to see,’ Hannah said, unrepentant and without further explanation – just a casual shrug. Rather shrewdly, she added, ‘I think it’s hard for you to see too.’
He’d treated Pansy terribly at times. Now, with a new perspective, he didn’t blame her for the distance between them that grew throughout sixth and seventh year as he once had. Lying in bed beside Harry, knowing what he did now about friendship because of Luna – from watching Harry interact with Granger and Weasley – Draco understood he’d been a truly shite friend to her in the end. He didn’t blame her for not standing by him during his trial, for not visiting him or writing to him once he was out.
‘But they will work it out, won’t they?’ Hermione’s obvious anxiety over the issue had Ginny hastening to reassure her that Weasley would come around.
Harry smiled, releasing Draco’s left hand to take his right for a second coat, waiting patiently while Draco, despite his annoyance manoeuvred around a bit to give Harry his hand. ‘I always listen to you,’ Harry assured him and then with a cheeky grin he added, ‘I just don’t always understand what you’re saying.’
Harry snorted but he did as he was told, declaring, ‘I love you more than anything,’ as he shut his eyes and wriggled down into a more comfortable position, taking Draco with him.
‘I best take advantage then,’ Draco chuckled. ‘Go on then, tell me how all those what-ifs would have led us right back here.’
And he had told Hermione that – more than once. Two months after it had all blown up, Harry had come to accept that Ron had said and done some horrible things to him, and he had accepted that it was perfectly okay to not want anything to do with his ex-best friend right now. He’d always known why Ron had said and done what he did, he’d been friends with the man for years and lived through this sort of thing before – though not to this extent – and he understood that the vitriol had been aimed solely at Harry (well and Draco) just to hurt. Harry was well-versed in Ron’s need to lash out when he was hurt and angry and this time Harry had the capacity to stand back and be objective and feel the hurt Ron was inflicting and recognise that he didn’t need that in his life.
‘Hermione, I know you’re just looking out for me, but I really do trust Draco and you have to trust that when it comes to this sort of thing, he really does know what he’s doing. Blood Magic and the Dark Arts are exactly the kind of thing the Ministry wants from him.’ Harry pointed down at the article, waiting until Granger followed his very pointed look before he continued. ‘They talk about what he did here, not exactly because they don’t know any more about the blood runes than you do, but the Ministry curse breaker who arrived after Draco and I left, supports what Draco did. The two aurors assigned to work with Draco, did too.’
Luna giggled. ‘He’d already handed it over before you came back and he realised he didn’t have a chance.’
Draco thought it was safe to comment here without risk of Harry taking his words the wrong way. ‘You didn’t get the chance to grow and form relationships while you were with the two of them,’ he offered up softly.
He runs a hand through his hair and its shaking, but he looks at her and he knows they need to have it now, that life altering conversation. They need to clear the air.
Only some, of course, because Fleur studied it from a curse breaker’s perspective and wasn’t likely to do something as crazy as paint runes on her husband’s neck.
‘He’s going to be okay,’ Ginny reminded him, choosing not to comment on the uncontrolled magic. He was grateful, it wasn’t like he could explain Draco’s theory that the absence of Voldemort’s soul was finally giving his magic room to stretch. ‘It’s going to take some time but he’ll be okay, remember that.’
‘I still think blood magic is terribly dangerous,’ Granger sternly informed them, as though neither of them had quite worked it out for themselves already. As though she hadn’t been dogging Harry with questions about his blasé attitude to Draco’s Dark Arts use for weeks, constantly attempting to call him on his easy forgiveness of a man who still saw nothing wrong with using terrible
This time, Draco kissed the top of Harry’s head. ‘It’s easier to be brave now,’ he explained truthfully. ‘You give me a reason to be brave.’
He felt his eyes grow heavy and took the potion Pomfrey held out for him. McGonagall came back just as he was sliding down in the bed to get more comfortable, Luna fussing with his pillow. She looked furious and it was satisfying to know her anger was on his behalf. He didn’t hear all the words she said to Pomfrey, but he did make out the way she asked Granger and Weasley to come to her office to discuss what had happened. He thought he heard her mention that an owl had been sent to the Ministry and possibly to his mother.
‘You did choose him over me.’ Ron sounded defeated again and Hermione wanted to roll her eyes all the while she wanted to reach across the table and take his hands and reassure him that she’d never choose Draco Malfoy over him.
Given the only person Ron knew Harry had been close enough to have sex with was his sister, Harry was immediately wary of answering. His silence forced Ron to look at him and he must have read the expression on Harry’s face – sheer horror at how the conversation could go – because Ron coughed and rubbed his hands nervously against the leg of his trousers.
‘What?’ Draco asked, poking his head around the shower curtain to look at Harry who was standing in front of the sink brushing his teeth, dressed in nothing but a towel wrapped low around his hips.
He’s been pulling away. He thought she had too. He’s started planning a whole other life, one that features Draco and warm Sunday mornings in the bedroom they’d share in Draco’s cottage. Merlin, when he told Draco about seeing a lawyer, about drawing up the divorce papers, they’d started talking about the family they’d have some day, about their options and what they’d like to do.
‘Ah. Can you do that?’ Harry tried to picture the Manor as it was now, with big empty rooms, fresh coats of paint going up and the walls they’d knocked out to open up even more space.
Harry pinched his side, not bothering to translate his words for Hermione and smiled when Draco yelped. ‘I saw a mind healer,’ Harry explained to Hermione, not for the first time and certainly it wouldn’t be the last because it definitely bore repeating and truly was a fantastic explanation for so many things. ‘And I think not having a piece of Voldemort lodged inside me sort of helps.’
Needless to say, he was slightly distracted when they reached the vault and managed to miss the way Ron’s eyes widened when he approached the vault and reached for the handle without any sort of ceremony and no key in sight. There was no key to the Black heirloom vault, Harry and Draco just needed to wrap his hand around the big – and very, very cursed – metal door handle, wait for it to take some blood with a sharp pin prick and then he could haul it open. The goblins, of course, kept the hinges on all the vaults properly oiled but that didn’t stop Harry from having to give a good firm pull to open the bloody heavy door.
It certainly helped that the shrewd look she was now giving Harry suggested she was realising there were things she didn’t know about her friend that Draco did. She was studying Harry as she might have studied an interesting problem in Ancient Runes. She didn’t like that Draco was forcing her to consider her own actions and she didn’t like that she was hearing evidence that Harry and Draco talked about everything – how else could he have known about the Polyjuice incident? – and she’d had no idea that their relationship, whatever she’d thought it had been, was something she hadn’t seen or understood.
‘Not enough,’ Draco replied ruefully. He tugged on Harry’s arm to draw him close and the tugged down his scarf until he found smooth, naked skin. He licked it. In full view of half the Ministry’s aurors and curse breakers but he didn’t have time to worry about the implications other than bringing the protections the blood rune offered to the surface.
‘Draco!’ Harry shouted, edging as close to the gaping hole in the floor as he could and stumbling when he misjudged just how close that actually was. Hermione and Weasley grabbed onto the back of his jumper to keep him steady.
‘It kind of looked that way, mate,’ Ron added when Harry waited a bit too long to explain more. He might not have had any idea what was going on, but it seemed four months in Hermione’s company had mellowed Ron a bit because he wasn’t angry or snarling rude things about Draco. Yet. He seemed to understand Harry would not be receptive to them just now. That didn’t mean Harry wasn’t expecting more sharp words and angry comments later.
‘Astara, there’s somebody I’d like you to meet,’ Malfoy said. He was looking at Hermione as he spoke with a strange look on his face she didn’t know how to read. ‘Astara, this is Hermione Granger, Granger, my daughter, Astara.’
In retrospect, seeing a mind healer was probably something Harry should have been doing since First Year. He couldn’t give Draco and Luna all the credit for this new confident and centred version of himself, seeing a mind healer for the better part of the last year had certainly done wonders for him.
Positive thoughts were few and hard to come by, harder still with every passing day. Time in his cell was weird and hard to keep track of. It didn’t seem as simple as noting the rising and setting of the sun. The cold seeping into his bones crept into his soul and when the dementors came looking for him they fed that feeling, swelling the fear and the shame inside him until there was nothing left but the cold dead feeling.
He just wanted to fall into the chair beside Draco and watch him sleep until he was strong enough to open his eyes. He didn’t want to deal with his friends and their questions and the strange mix of pity and resentment they felt when they looked to Draco and saw a man who had been hurt, yes, but a man they (on some level) thought deserved what he got.
Harry wasn’t back when he and Hermione returned from McGonagall’s office, weighed down with course catalogues and notes on the number of students they would need to accommodate over the next five years (just to start with and because after that evidence of magic in muggleborns was spotty because they were still so young). Draco unthinkingly led the way up to his dormitory and Hermione followed without comment. She did raise her eyebrows though at the protective wards on the door as she followed him inside.
The cold look the portrait managed to convey when glaring at the smiling foolish face of Dumbledore settled something inside Draco. He’d once greatly respected Snape and although the events of sixth year and the war had tarnished that respect, some of it had been gained back when he learned how long Snape had been working to protect Harry. Though Draco did not think that weeping over the corpse of Lily Potter and saving her son’s life excused the fact that he did not do more to protect Lily or Harry once he knew what was about to happen.
Hermione rolled her eyes. ‘I see the changes in him,’ she tried again. ‘And I can see how maybe you might like this new Draco – because I can start to forgive him and I think we could be friends – but I don’t understand how you got there,’ she paused for a moment and then finished, ‘but I think that’s okay. I don’t have to understand it, I just have to appreciate that he makes you happy and trust that you know what you’re doing.’
Draco had winced, feeling a twinge of unwanted sympathy for her. He was perfectly aware how unhealthily obsessive he and Harry could be about each other. At least he’d never proclaimed to be in love with any of the people he’d been sleeping with before Harry. His obsession with the Boy Who Lived hadn’t gotten in the way of any of his relationships simply because he didn’t think anything he’d had with any of the other Slytherins came remotely close to being a relationship. They were certainly nothing like what he and Harry had now. Or what Harry had once had with Ginny.
‘I thought we had a no legilimency rule for the breakfast table?’ Although the words had come from Luna, they sounded so eerily like his mother that both he and Harry could only stare at her.
‘If only,’ Turpin grumbled with a roll of her eyes. ‘It’s worse, they’re all shy and smitten and working up to it.’
They’d reached the castle gates now and as they stepped through, they separated for apparation. Harry had the strength to take all three of them but not the skill to make their arrival as a group unnoticed in a muggle area.
The smell of the sea threatened to drag him back to this morning’s nightmare and he had to swallow around a suddenly dry mouth. As he did, he became aware of the taste and feel of magic in the air. It wasn’t something he liked to think about, his new sensitivity to magic, he’d earned it the hard way through torture and pain and nothing good came of dwelling on it.
‘I don’t know if you should be alone,’ Hermione’s words were fuelled by genuine concern for Harry, but he just couldn’t deal with it.
‘I came to see if you’re ready for breakfast,’ Luna informed them as she turned her back on them and went back into the bedroom. They both followed her out of the bathroom and she draped herself across the bed, gaze firmly locked on the ceiling to give them an illusion of privacy while they dressed.
Because Draco did the same. He’d drop his book onto the nightstand with a thoughtful thump and explain to him in halting words about the time he’d realised his father would rather buy him things than sit and talk to him. He could kick him under the dinner table and profess a deep loathing for lemon tarts but that he ate them anyway because they were his mother’s favourite and he wanted to share that with her.
‘But you’re Draco Malfoy and he’s Harry Potter and whatever this thing is between you, I think it’s been brewing since the day you met on the train and there is no way I’m going to get in the way of that. He nearly killed you. You were a Death Eater. There’s seven years of bad blood between you but he looks at you like you’re his whole world and he has no idea how he got so lucky and, ugh, the way you look at him.’ She’d shuddered theatrically. ‘You two are going to kill each other before the year is out or you’re going to be disgustingly happy for the rest of your lives. Either way, if Voldemort himself couldn’t come between you, I don’t think any of us are going to manage to talk some sense into him. Or you.’
And he was Draco now, even in her head. He was smart and knowledgeable, and he was trying and despite her desire to keep hating him, despite her desire to see him as the boy he was and the horrible kid he’d been, despite wanting to hold his past against him, the changes she saw in him were genuine and she possibly hated that even more.
‘You did when it truly counted,’ Draco whispered, startling Harry because he’d thought he’d been asleep. ‘Stop thinking so much, Potter. Sleep.’
It was so completely unexpected that he was startled into laughter. Sputtering, he managed to say, ‘What?’
The knowledge that Percy very likely had ulterior motives regarding prisoner rights and a better and fairer Ministry, had soothed the blow to his ego somewhat.
It wasn’t unsound advice and – frankly – Draco was astonished it had come from Harry. ‘That’s not terrible advice.’
…actually, that probably wasn’t a bad idea. He’d already thought about asking her for help with reforming Azkaban because Salazar knew that coming from him it would be seen as nothing more than an ex-Death Eater trying to protect the rest of those remaining from Voldemort’s little army. He’d experienced Azkaban for himself, seen what it had done to his aunt (he was sure she hadn’t always been
‘The last bit of Draco’s Christmas present,’ Harry answered honestly. With another sigh, he made for the first cabinet on the right and started opening drawers and poking about – with his wand (he was allowed to keep that now when he visited Gringotts) because he wasn’t an idiot. In theory, nothing in this vault could hurt him too badly but he was sure there were a few things in here that had blood protections on them, and Harry wasn’t sure how far his bond with Draco went when it came to ancient family curses.
‘You – what?’ Harry looked down in alarm at the leather wrapped around his wrist. He’d thought it was an odd token for Draco to give him, but it matched his wand holster and Draco was prone to doing odd things when it came to his wardrobe choices. He hadn’t thought anything more than that Draco had felt like giving him something. He’d assumed it would be some sort of accessory to clothing Draco wanted him to wear (it wouldn’t be the first time).
This time, she nodded and left without trying again or asking any of the million questions she so clearly wanted to ask. Ginny went with them, pausing at the door to wait while Luna slipped off the bed and pulled her shoes back on. She brushed Draco’s hair off his face, placed a soft kiss to his cheek and gave Harry one final smile before she went after Ginny.
In that moment as he lay bleeding on the cold floor, blood mixing with the water spraying everywhere, he wasn’t Malfoy, he was just Draco and he was a mirror of Harry in all his fears and his terrors and instead of being noticed, instead of being reached in his darkness he’d been punished for it. Punished for loving his parents, punished for not understanding until it was too late that his views were wrong. He was punished for the hopelessness that Harry felt when confronted by his own reality and as he skidded to his knees on the floor, water and blood soaking his pants and his robes, he realised that it wasn’t Malfoy lying on the floor but Draco with old wounds freshly sliced open and a betrayed look on his face.
He would be the second to admit he was slow on the uptake – Ginny being the first, though closely tied with Draco if he were being honest.
But only a small part. The bigger part of him had been watching the two of them pine for years and thought they’d probably be good together if Ron stopped being an arse about it and Hermione stopped letting him get away with so much. He’d had to put up with a lot from them over the years and he was ready to admit that Hermione, having known Ron’s emotional range, probably could have saved them all some trouble by just laying it all out for Ron in simple words. Of course, he didn’t blame her for not wanting to. He just wished it could have been so simple instead of her waiting patiently for him to mature enough to meet her needs.
‘Well, they haven’t killed me yet,’ Harry had pointed out but then Draco had been forced to demonstrate how the blood runes could be made to rise to the surface of Harry’s skin and he took some pleasure in making everyone uncomfortable by licking the side of Harry’s neck right there in McGonagall’s office.
For two days, the outside world didn’t exist, and it almost felt like those first days after his release from Azkaban, when they’d sit out in the garden soaking up the sun (or at least the fresh air) and not even really talking.
Ron’s eyebrows shot up at his vehemence and Harry sighed, shoulders slumping as he scrubbed both hands over his face – something that would have been awkward before and involved moving or smudging his glasses.
‘Because you spent so much time stalking him and watching him and obsessing over him,’ Granger remembered. ‘Well, so much of your past behaviour makes sense now.’
And maybe it was that he was sore and tired and just feeling lonely and emotional, but when he finished breakfast and stood up to go back to his dormitory to collect the right books for his classes, he dropped a kiss on the top of Luna’s head and murmured around the sudden lump in his throat, ‘Don’t ever stop being you.’
This didn’t seem to sit well with Weasley but Harry (not one for standing around) was showing remarkable restraint, especially when Draco knew he looked terrible and was swaying dangerously on his feet.
Harry’s soft “oh” suggested he’d only just cottoned on to what they were talking about. ‘Hold on,’ he said, ‘Ron and Hermione are having sex?’
‘You think it was one of the Unspeakables he had working for him that did this?’ Harry asked, hopefully starting to understand what Draco was getting at.
Harry grinned. ‘I’ve never seen Percy look so annoyed.’ He sobered. ‘He’s the only reason you got a trial so quickly.’
Happy Thanksgiving to my American readers! Also thank you for the continued comments and support you have all shown me by reading, leaving kudos and generally just brightening my day by putting up with this rambling bout of self-indulgent fluff.
The three aurors in their hideous robes had been joined by another two and Harry’s familiar head of messy black hair stood with them. More annoyed than ever about being shoved out of the way, Draco snapped off a spell Harry had taught him and watched in satisfaction as it collided with one of the witches busy trying to shield herself from the aurors expected attack. It slammed her back into the side of the house with more force than he’d intended. A beat later another spell collided with her, this one manipulating the garden hose to tie her up and keep her out of the fight.
‘I’ll say,’ Ron muttered, eyeing the tattoos he could see. Harry made it easier for him by pulling his arms from behind his head and holding them out for Ron to admire. Ron caught the glint of a gold band on Harry’s ring finger. ‘Alright, lay it on me,’ he said. ‘Married.’ He pointed at the ring. ‘Kids?’
All three of them turned to look at the dragon. In the fifteen minutes Harry had been working with Draco the dragon had slumped deeper into the snow. It looked miserable and in pain and Harry thought it might be kinder to end its pain and misery than try and heal it and restore it.
He’d found himself wanting to stay, to talk some more to this version of his father that he hadn’t seen in so long, but they were out of time and honestly, his father had looked exhausted just from their short exchange. He’d walked away from his father’s cell wondering how much longer the man could survive in there. At least he’d walked away with the knowledge that his father didn’t disapprove of his choice of partner. Although he still didn’t know if his father approved or was just resigned to the fact that this was the way things would be.
Draco grinned smugly. ‘I can be quite creative. And let’s be honest, I’m going to curse at least one of them. I can’t believe McGonagall would send her to me.’
Harry winced at his words, but Draco didn’t think he was wrong and clearly Harry had thoughts about this as well. He just didn’t seem willing to voice them to his upset friend.
Draco found the tattered remnants of a spell on the ceiling similar to the one in the Great Hall but on a much smaller scale. ‘I think they used to teach Astronomy in here during the day,’ he murmured. ‘I wonder why they don’t anymore?’
Legally and magically Harry was a Black. Sirius had known what he was doing when he left everything to Harry, and the intricate bond he and Draco had linked them tighter than any magical marriage ever could. For all intents and purposes, Harry was a Black by soul and marriage and most of the protections should recognise that. That didn’t mean Harry was going to go blindly poking about, the Blacks had generations of magic soaking everything in this vault, there were bound to be some nasty surprises.
Harry scrambled away from the table after him, calling his name in a panic, almost violently kicking his own chair out of the way. Molly, recovered from nearly being knocked over, was not far behind him, her eyes wide with fear and concern. Draco just kept stumbling away from the table and the crowd of Weasleys, arm clutched to his chest as though that could somehow shield him from the pain, until Harry caught him around the waist and steadied him. It was Harry who managed to pry his arm away from his chest but Molly who pushed his sleeve up to reveal the writhing form of his Dark Mark.
‘I know.’ And Draco did know, because part of that conversation he’d gotten stuck in with Granger had included her expressing a desire to understand the traditions purebloods were so afraid of losing. ‘I also think having proper Muggle Studies classes in necessary.’
Hermione gave Harry a knowing look. ‘How much skin are we talking? And how long before it switches? Does it just go from one to the other during contact or does it move back and forth until you separate?’
Just one more thing, on a list of many that he blamed his father for. Just another thing he blamed himself for. How different would life have been for him if he’d seen beyond his father’s teachings?
He remembered that first morning when he’d still been in the Ministry holding cells. He’d woken up to find Harry sitting on the floor beside what passed for a bed, knees drawn up to his chest, wand clenched tightly in his fist. He hadn’t been looking at Draco, his eyes were held fiercely on the slight shimmer of the powerful ward that formed the door to Draco’s cell. It had taken him far longer than it should have to realise the agony he’d been feeling for days had been eased to a dull ache. He hadn’t understood then, honestly some days he still didn’t understand, what had driven Harry to help him.
But after it all, after the threats and the fear and the lack of sleep and appetite, after he’d begun fading until he was nothing but a shell and so broken by what he was supposed to do, there was a moment in a bathroom with Harry Potter and Draco’s memory of that moment was worse, more distorted, than any other. He remembered crying. Had a vague idea that he’d attempted to cast an unforgiveable – knew that he had in fact – but there was a watery quality to the memory, a hazy wash of confusion and hurt and a strange moment of betrayal so sharp and deep that Draco didn’t understand it. That moment was blood and pain and a sort of helpless confusion because Harry (and he knew this now, Salazar, he knew, and he didn’t understand, and he was sorry) was good and light and the one meant to defeat the Dark Lord and probably the only one who could save Draco and his family from what was to come.
He could almost feel Draco roll his eyes; he didn’t need to turn to see him do it. He slowed his pace for a moment, waiting for Draco to step into place beside him before he lifted their joined hands and draped his arm across Draco’s shoulders until he could pull him close and press a kiss to his temple.
Draco swore – creatively because parseltongue had a wonderous extent of profanity that likely said a lot about snakes.
Surely if Hermione knew Dumbledore had raised Harry to die then she wouldn’t be so quick to defend him.
Harry pressed warm lips against Draco’s collarbone in silent agreement. ‘What if I’d come to apologise after I nearly killed you in sixth year,’ Harry whispered softly, ‘do you think that would have changed things?’
It didn’t matter that the war had changed him, he would still always be those things. He could share his past and his pain and his hopes and fears and all the in between with Harry and some of it with Luna. He could share bits and pieces of himself with Ginny and (fuck it)
There didn’t seem to be any pattern to the spells and curses they came across as they swept their way across the fields. Sometimes there’d be as little as three steps between trapped land and others there’d be as many as ten. They came across witch bottles, spelled iron, plants that tried to eat them – Harry quite literally tripped over a grumpy old mandrake at one point, dislodging him enough to have his mouth peaking above the earth and melting snow. He didn’t have enough clearance for a proper cry, but Draco wasn’t taking any chances, using a spell that Professor Sprout certainly wouldn’t approved of to stitch the old plant’s lips together.
No, he and his mother wouldn’t be doing things that way. In a quiet and frank discussion (perhaps the first they’d ever really had) they’d decided to simply live. His mother’s first step had been to reach out to the Ministry for assistance clearing the Manor. She’d followed it up by reaching out to her sister. Draco really was just trying to live his life, no matter how much he struggled not to drown in the guilt and let his past win. That new way of accepting his fate had brought Harry into his life, had given him the chance to know his aunt and his cousin, it was all for the better. He was all the happier for it. His mother was certainly flourishing. Despite being on house arrest Draco was sure he’d never known his mother to be so simply
No, Harry had no trouble believing that under different circumstances Draco would have loved the idea that he could be a highly skilled and highly sought after (paid) employee – or at least an over-priced consultant – of the Ministry. Harry thought that being a consultant would probably work best as it gave the public the impression the Ministry was still calling on Draco when they saw fit and not welcoming him into the fold with open arms – and vaults. If he spun it right, and Harry had no doubt Draco could spin it right, he could have the whole thing looking – rightfully – as though he was invaluable and highly sought after in the public’s eye and not just secretly in the Ministry’s.
Draco laughed, standing out of his crouch. ‘He definitely will not be marrying, Ginny,’ he informed Carter, to their dad he said, ‘The
This set Hermione off again, but it was nice, seeing her smile and watching her start to understand just how long this thing between he and Draco had been building.
He didn’t feel like he could do that with Ron, so he’d agreed when Hermione followed him into the corridor after they’d finished off their impromptu Italian dinner and “suggested” he take Ron with him to Gringotts. And now he was trying to think about every other possible reason Ron could have for getting annoyed at him just so he didn’t have to worry that his best mate would leave him the moment he realised Harry was sleeping with another man, let alone that the other man was Draco bloody Malfoy.
‘I want to hate him so much, Pansy, but he loves me and I don’t even know what to do with that.’ He looked at her beseechingly. ‘What am I supposed to do with that?’
‘I suppose I best give you your final present then.’ Although, Draco had no idea how he was supposed to top the precious gift Harry had given him. A pair of ancient Black family rings, imbued with centuries of family magic and made for long lasting love. The kind of love that ran warm and long, always simmering even when passion came and went.
‘I don’t think I love you.’ Her words are a relief, he can see it in the way her shoulders relax, in the way she sinks more comfortably into her chair. It’s an admission, something she’s acknowledging now because she can. ‘Not, I mean, I do love you Harry but not – not like I should.’
‘Pomfrey said you’re healing well, even with all the damage those jobs for the Ministry cause you,’ Harry murmured, voice suddenly sober.
Ron and Hermione sputtered, outraged, but Harry just rolled his eyes. ‘Draco isn’t stealing my money,’ he told them, reaching for more bacon. Which was true, he wasn’t stealing Harry’s money, he just wasn’t going to tell them that Draco was free to access his gold and not just because the goblins did like a Malfoy and were still mad at Harry about the whole dragon thing.
Molly made him jumpers at Christmas and she’d always made sure he had new robes that fit for the upcoming school year but he was the one who’d kept wearing Dudley’s old clothes, he was the one who, even with weeks spent on his own in Diagon Alley before third year, had never bothered to look for better fitting things. He’d never bought something for himself because he could, nothing big or even small, just because he wanted it. As far as Harry could remember, the Quidditch World Cup, when he’d bought them all omnioculars was the first time he’d ever just purchased something that wasn’t a necessity – and he’d gotten some for his friends too.
Draco listened to Luna’s rambling explanation about willow wasps that weren’t actually wasps at all but rather a type of ant as he and Harry guided her out of the conservatory and down into the basement kitchen to use the floo. None of them were sober enough to chance apparation and he didn’t think McGonagall would mind too much if they used her floo.
Hermione caught him by surprise in the library and had already erected enough privacy charms to wipe the distant corner of the library off any map of Hogwarts before he’d even had a chance to glance up from the book he was studying. A book on Dark curses Draco had found lurking in the depths of one of the Lestrange vaults and which Harry seemed only to be able to hold because of the strange connection he and Draco shared.
‘I think he was probably bigger,’ Harry admitted, taking the bag from Draco as he slid down onto the floor with them. ‘What did you do with Ginny?’ The smell from the bag was amazing and seemed to completely derail any thought Ron had of further questioning Draco’s role in Harry’s new wardrobe.
He talked softly with his mother and Andromeda as he sipped his tea and ate some toast until eventually Harry emerged from beneath the tree, Teddy held upside down in his hands with chubby fists clenching tight to a soft squishy package that Draco just knew, looking at it, came from Molly. Harry shuffled closer to Draco, flipped Teddy up the right way and deposited the giggling eight-month-old in Draco’s lap forcing Draco to shove the last bit of toast into his mouth so he could place a steadying hand on Teddy to support him before his enthusiasm for the present in his hands had him flopping face first onto the rug.
Her footfalls were quiet, she dropped into the booth across from them without warning with a soft, ‘Sweet fucking Salazar, it’s true.’
‘The next one is going to talk about the restructure of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, with follow ups to cover the legal changes and eventual restructure of the entire Ministry of Magic in the wake of Voldemort’s rather telling take over,’ Granger paraphrased drawing Draco out of his thoughts.
Such a small change and yet things remained remarkably the same. There was a funeral, words exchanged with the Minister and plans made with Ron and Hermione. He didn’t have to break up with Ginny.
Harry froze, all that extra syrup dripping off the piece of pancake now hovering above his plate. ‘A what?’ he asked, face blank, not at all clear on what he’d just heard Draco say.
‘I’ve got you, I’m here, I’m here, you’re safe,’ the words were soft, a gentle refrain of patience and love and Harry flailed as he tried to make sense of the soft words, the gentle touch, after being trapped in an endless loop of nightmares that were still clawing at the edges of his mind trying to break free of the box he desperately shoved them into.
She snapped her mouth closed and instead of asking him about it, gave him an approving look. Which turned into a sharp look of disapproval when her gaze met Ron’s again. ‘See, if Harry’s managed to get all his homework done around all of his other commitments, you can certainly get yours done when you’ve nothing else to worry about.’
Harry had stopped looking at Hermione at some point, translating his words without conscience thought because he was staring at Draco with nothing but a burning look of love and faith and so much pride that it was a wonder Draco didn’t choke on the tears he was determinedly holding back. He would not let Hermione see him cry because this was not about him, this was about Hermione and he would not sway her with tears and emotion but the words and logic she favoured.
Harry’s eyebrows shot up and rather than be offended he laughed. ‘Draco, you’ve turned down sex to study curses before – you love curse breaking.’
Why would anyone want to care about a strange little boy whose parents were dead and was obviously broken enough that his own relatives couldn’t stand the sight of him? Why should he have thought Hogwarts would be any different? Why should he have thought the wizarding world would be different just because there was magic and he was famous and there were no Dursleys to point out all his flaws?
"Of course I care, it's upsetting you so obviously I wanna know." Harry's eyes widened. He opened his mouth to say something, but nothing came out.
After Draco got all the pictures he wanted, which was three 10 packs of film, much to Harry's displeasure, Harry found it adorable but wouldn't admit it, they sat back down on the blanket and just talked.
But before she could speak Harry started talking, "she's just laughing at me because I told her, for some reason, that I'm in love with Malfoy, also we think that I've been hit with a jinx that makes me say whatever I'm thinking."
At this moment Harry looked around to find all the people in the common room staring at him. He looked to the person that pulled him away from the other boy, who was currently being carried to the hospital wing, Draco.
The day goes by quickly after and he was headed to practice. At practice they just went over drills and fully established their positions.
I take a deep breath. Do it fast like ripping off a band aid, I remind myself. "Ivelikedyouforareallylongtimeandiwaswonderingifyoudwanttogooutwithme?" I say in one breath while pushing the box of chocolates I had behind my back towards him. I don't even think he understood any of that. All of his friends look at me confused, but then at Draco and they all start laughing, including Draco.
Harry finally got up and got ready for the day. He put on his gray AJR, Neotheater hoodie, another pair of black, ripped jeans, and his pair of black and white high top vans.
When they were getting ready to leave, it was around 2:00pm. They packed up all of their belongings and started heading back to the car. On the way back they were just holding hands while laughing, stealing little kisses here and there.
He was all alone in his first class, he did have a couple of his teammates in it but they weren't close. Precalculas went by slowly but it was fine because he was actually good at it.
He said he needed to go back inside. "Wish I could explain the sound but I didn't hear anything." He explained. He said it must have just the wind.
Hermione grabbed Ron's wrist and pulled him out of the room with a "get dressed now and meet us in the common room and if you're not down there in 10 minutes it's a detention." I groaned but got up.
"I promise I'm not pranking you or anything. You're always welcome at my place, it's the one directly below yours. You can stay as long as you want, whenever you need a friend or just someone to talk to. We can talk about the sound when you're ready. But until then we can just say that it "must have been the wind."
"Honey, I don't even know what I did wrong, could you please just tell me and I promise I'll fix it." Harry was so confused and his face showed it.
After practice Harry noticed that a certain blonde was seated in the stands, he was about to call out to him when his coach came up to him. "Good practice today, Potter," Oliver patted him on the back, "now go shower and go home."
Harry himself is just wearing a white button up, the sleeves rolled up to his elbow, which makes his boyfriend just fucking melt, black ripped jeans, and his all white vans.
Harry nods, "yeah, that works, I'm guessing you'll drive us?" Malfoy nods. "Ok, I'll meet you at the doors after school."
He just decided to go flying. He grabbed his broom and headed down to the quidditch pitch. On his way outside he ran into Draco. He saw Draco start to speed walk towards him.
"Thomas and Finnigan." Was they were seated he pointed to the desk behind Ron's, "Patil and Zabini, Granger and Abbott, Malfoy and Potter-," he continued but he didn't hear what he was saying.
"Oh, I'm so sorry, I should have watched where I was goi-," but no one was there, he was confused until he looked down. It was Malfoy, he was on his knees, picking up his books.
Was he was home he was so exhausted that after dinner he went straight to bed (which Sirius totally didn't tease him for and Remus totally didn't reprimand Sirius for doing so).
I'm so bloody terrified, he is surrounded by all of his Slytherin friends and I know for a fact they're gonna laugh at me, but I don't care, I've put this off for way too long. He's sitting at the Slytherin table in the great hall.
“That is not the kind of voicemail someone leaves if they’re completely fine!” Harry jabbed his fork in the air to emphasize his point. Breakfast at the Weasley’s was often chaotic, but today it was just Harry and Ron. He half-wished it was a normal busy morning. It would have made it harder to focus on worrying about Draco. “And why did he drive all the way to London? Why did he call from a payphone?” Harry had tried to call the number back, but had no luck reaching Draco. He had, however, been able to reach a pedestrian, a motorcyclist, and what sounded like a very drunk seagull. None of them knew the whereabouts of a certain blond boy.
“Why him?” Draco groaned aloud. “Why did it have to be him? Couldn’t it have been a girl, a girl who likes me, just a girl in general? Why on Earth is it him?” He flopped back onto his bed, his hands on his face as if trying to erase something. He sat up abruptly, dizzying himself a little. He muttered something about feelings being stupid, and reached for the television remote. The sound of the cable news lady on the TV echoed through the empty house, talking about mundane events and old people’s funerals. An empty house wasn’t rare for Draco; his parents were always at benefits and charity auctions, which they only went to so people wouldn’t think they were selfish. No one knew the secrets that went on behind the closed doors at the Malfoy house. Draco had the scars and assorted casts and braces to prove it. Irritated, he switched the TV off and reached for his phone, mindlessly scrolling through people’s photos and outdated memes, until he saw the one photo he actually cared about (not that he’d ever admit that to anyone). It was a black and white photo of a dark, messy-haired boy wearing an oversized sweater, wrapped delicately in fairy lights, and although there was no color in the photo, Draco knew that the eyes behind those large, round glasses would shimmer like polished emeralds in the daylight and sparkle like forest moss in the moonlight. The caption underneath the photo read; “Darling, can’t you see? It’s you and me, meant to be.” Draco dropped his phone onto the floor, with no intention of ‘liking’ the photo, in an effort to keep up the appearance of hating that boy, that gorgeous dark-haired boy, that gorgeous Harry Potter. Unbeknownst to him, when he dropped it, his finger grazed the screen and ‘liked’ the photo. He rolled over on his bed, lying face down on his pillow. Sitting up, he hid his face into the pillow and let out a muffled scream.
If it was important, he would call whoever it was back in the morning. He set his phone down and tried to go back to sleep. Maybe he’d be able to resume his dream.
Harry spent the rest of the day in the infirmary. He lied to Ms. Pomfrey and told her he felt nauseous, so he wouldn’t have to go back to class. It wasn’t much of a stretch, anyways. His thoughts were racing. Focusing on anything would have been impossible. He just needed to think. Harry wished he had Draco’s cell phone number, just to make sure he was all right. Maybe Ron or Hermione had his number? He pulled out his phone and texted them.
Harry tried his best to ignore Ron’s incessant muttering about how this was all useless and how he “didn’t need to know how to read a bloody dot graph to run a joke shop”, but this task proved difficult. He glanced towards the teacher as she impatiently called Draco’s name for the third time, still to no response. To his surprise, the eyes he had been trying so hard to recreate on the paper before him were already looking at him. He felt his heart drop to his shoes and his face heat up until it was practically on fire, then quickly averted his gaze to the angry teacher leering over Draco. Ms. Umbridge said his name one more time, and Draco, without missing a beat, confidently explained the answer in-depth, and finished with a sarcastic burn that felt as if it scorched Harry.
“The Booger awaits,” Ron said, stuffing the last bites of his waffle into his mouth and heading out the door.
The school nurse, Ms. Pomfrey, gave Harry an ice pack and some gauze and sternly told him to sit down in one of the rooms off the office and be quiet so as to not “aggravate his injuries”. She was the type of stern that a mother was, wanting only the best for her hundreds of adopted children. Harry rolled his eyes—at least the one that wasn’t swollen shut—but complied. Ron and Hermione joined him, much to the chagrin of the nurse. He hoped that they wouldn’t ask about what Draco had said to him; he was already exhausted from mentally trying to explain to Mrs. Weasley what happened to his glasses. Harry took a deep, exasperated breath as Hermione opened her mouth.
“Mate, as much as I hate to say this, she’s right. He’s never hit you before. Don’t you remember how the Dursleys made your life a living hell? That’s why you came to live with my family and me. You shouldn’t have to deal with that shit at school too.” Ron’s voice cracked and faded as he saw a blond boy standing outside the window in the hall. Harry turned around to see that face, that damn face that made his heart race and his palms sweat. The nurse passed their room on her way out of the office, and partially closed the door. His mouth dried out as he watched Draco enter the office, and say something to the secretary about being summoned for a call. The secretary nodded her head, said something Harry couldn’t quite make out, and handed Draco one of the clunky corded office phones. Draco’s already pale face grew ashen as the person on the other end fumed loudly. The voice, now clearly male, yet still murky, continued speaking about how Draco was a disgrace to the family name. As the voice went on, Draco looked as if he was being crushed by some unseen weight. Harry watched as Draco defensively mumbled something unintelligible, to which the voice spoke louder, colder, and strangely calmer; so loud that Harry felt as if the speaker was right next to him; so cold that he felt the chill sweep through the small infirmary room; so calm, he was almost at peace. It was a terrifying calm, the eerie calm before a devastating storm, the unnatural calm of a normally bustling place after everyone is gone.
Draco left the car in the parking lot and started walking; he needed to clear his head. He could go wherever he wanted. He didn’t need anyone, and no one needed him. Perhaps he didn’t need anyone, but he wanted someone. He wanted Harry. All of it. The ups, the downs, the late-night fights and making each other coffee in the morning. He wanted to be happy.
He appreciated her concern, but he was sick of talking. Still, he mumbled a quiet, “I’m fine,” and went upstairs to the room that he and Ron shared. The room was messy, of course, but at least there weren’t rats (although Hermione’s loudly voiced concerns might lead you to believe otherwise). Harry flopped back onto his bed and waited for the inevitable sound of Molly’s footsteps following him upstairs. That was when Harry realized he was truly part of the family: when he could tell them all apart by the sound of their footsteps and the way they knocked at a door. Molly’s knock was two taps, a pause, then a third tap. Three seconds later, that knock came at the door.
Something hit Harry. He put on his glasses and saw a pillow lying on the floor. Ron must have thrown it at him.
“I knew he couldn’t come up with another one!” Ron chortled. “You just idolize him because you’re so in love with him!” Harry turned defensive, even though Ron’s words rang true.
The trio watched as Draco numbly let go of the phone, letting it slam into the desk, earning a nasty look from the secretary. Draco didn't seem to notice. It was as if his soul had left his body and he was but a shriveled husk of a boy, for that was what he looked like at that moment. Not a man, not even a teenager, but simply a small boy, wanting only a hug from his father. He blinked, and robotically wiped the two shining trails of tears off his cheeks with the back of his hand. As Draco turned to leave, he glanced around the office for some reason. Their eyes met through the small rectangular window in Harry’s door. Draco’s eyes widened and he sprinted out of the room.
Red phone booths were classic London. They were rarely used anymore, except as graffitied reminders of days gone by. Draco’s phone was dead anyways. He didn’t need it—he had the number memorized. The numbers on the keypad were almost unreadable, faded and covered in what Draco hoped was rust.
“For the last time, mate, I don’t know why he’d do that. I don’t know why he does anything. I don’t know why you’re so worked up, either. He probably just went to blow off some steam.” Ron’s words were barely coherent. He was not a morning person—he usually didn’t entirely wake up until around lunchtime.
Well, if you’re Draco, you go with a drunken, rambling voicemail that you certainly won’t remember in the morning, but if by some chance you did remember it, you’d never be able to face the person again. Luckily, he would already forget the message by the time he hung up.
“Hey, wake up. School is over.” Harry opened his eyes to see a slightly blurry Ron standing next to him. Hermione stood next to him, a concerned look in her eyes.
“Mate, you never had a chance,” Ron joined in, stopping to wait for them a few strides ahead. “It must’ve been a mistake. Why else would he ‘like’ that photo with your oh-so-subtle caption that you posted specifically for him to see?”
Hermione would often come over after school to study and eat dinner, since her parents often got home late. So it wasn’t unusual when Molly was there to greet the three of them at the door. She knew what had happened—Ron had texted her on the way home so she could get one of Harry’s many spare pairs of glasses. He was always losing them, so he had about fifteen pairs scattered about. This would be more useful if he wasn’t losing the spares. Still, Molly had managed to find a pair for him.
“Harry, this isn’t right, it’s been months and he’s still bullying you. You need to go to Principal Dumbledore,” Hermione whispered out of the side of her mouth, so the nurse wouldn’t hear their conversation. Harry opened his mouth in protest when Ron interjected.
“Draco has his ways,” Ron said from the backseat. Harry had made it to the car first today, and as such, was sitting shotgun. Ron had forgotten his shoes and had to double back to the house. “Mate, you need to chill. He’s fine. Hell, he even said that he was fine.”
Harry's thoughts distracted him from the call that he so badly wanted to eavesdrop on. He brought himself back to reality and caught the tail end of Draco's phone call.
he didn’t expect anyone to answer his call. It was late, and any reasonable person would be asleep by now. Draco, of course, was not one of those reasonable people. But the person he was calling was reasonable, and as such, was asleep.
Harry stepped out of the car and stood there in shock as Draco started his car and sped out of the parking lot.
“I don’t know, Harry, I’m sure he’s fine. His phone probably died, he decided it wasn’t safe for him to drive, he’s probably at some hotel enjoying the continental breakfast. He’s smart,” Hermione reassured Harry. “As much as it pains me to admit that,” she said under her breath.
“I told them to go back to class,” Harry said nasally, due to his broken nose. A drop of blood fell from his nose and landed on his jeans. “Oh, shit,” he muttered, distracted. “Damn thing just stopped bleeding.” Draco didn’t want to waste time on Harry’s nose. All he wanted to do was get to the point.
“Hold up, I’ve got to return a couple of books,” she said, pulling out seven impossibly large books from her backpack and slotting them into the outside return drop. “I wish the library was open on Sundays, I’ve got four more on hold.”
“How did those even fit in there?” Ron asked. “Oh, do any of those have little hearts and doodles of two boys holding hands?”
Draco had spent the day wandering through London, hoping for some clarity (which he didn’t get). Instead, he got drunk.
“Mate, your phone’s ringing,” grumbled Ron. “Now answer it and let me sleep.” Harry checked his phone. He didn’t recognize the number, so he ignored the call (after silencing it, of course. Ron would get even grumpier than usual when he didn’t get enough sleep.)
“Thanks,” Harry said, putting them on. Now Molly’s plump, rosy face wasn't blurry anymore. But now he could see the true depth of concern on her face.
forgotten homework assignments, and sat down on Harry’s bed. She still wore that same concerned expression, but didn’t say anything. The silence was killing Harry, and he was just about to say something when Molly did.
Draco's eyes watered as he listened to his father screeching at him through the phone. He tried his best to not let a single tear fall, to not show any signs of weakness. The secretary was a horrible gossip, he knew that much. Maybe not to the students, but to the rest of the staff, and they'd all come up to him and ask him if he was okay. Obviously, he wasn't. Draco was sick of lying.
Draco started his car and wondered where he would spend the night. He didn’t want to drive back home, not tonight, not ever. There wasn’t a home for him to come back to anyways. There was nothing left for him there anymore. Nothing… except maybe Harry?
“Harry, dear, you don’t need to say anything. I just wanted you to know that I love you and I’m here for you, and I trust that you’ll talk to me when you’re ready.” She opened her arms for a hug, and Harry fell into them willingly. They sat there, hugging, and when Molly started to pull away, Harry held her tighter.
Harry sat silently as Draco sobbed, his head resting on the steering wheel. It was always weird to watch someone cry, especially someone who seemed so cold and reserved. A strange sort of intimacy, like watching someone while they’re asleep. Harry wondered what Draco would do now, where he would go. Draco’s house clearly wasn’t an option—Harry refused to let that happen, to let Draco go back into the raging arms of his father, only to get more bruises that he tried—and failed—to cover up. Harry had seen them, had been seeing them for years, during gym class in the locker room. Draco always changed clothes so quickly, but he wasn’t quick enough. Maybe he would have been quick enough for someone who wasn’t watching him, studying him, falling in love with him…
he thought. All the hotels nearby had been booked. He even drove the additional hour and a half to London, hoping maybe someplace would have a cancellation. Of course, that was too much to hope for. So, he had spent the night in the parking lot of a Tesco. At least it was quiet.
“‘Mione, I don’t know what to tell you. Ketchup is a smoothie,” Ron said. “Tomatoes are a fruit, so when you mash them up into ketchup, they become a smoothie.” Even without his glasses, Harry could see Hermione’s jaw clench.
“Hermione, I’ve been trying to get over it. Ron, I’m sure it was a mistake, but I can’t help wondering if it wasn’t. And If I could choose to not like him, I would. But I can’t, because feelings are stupid,” Harry said, his hand idly rubbing his scar as they passed a jogger with a dog.
Another voice cut in before she could scold him further. Snape’s drawl was just as scathing as Draco’s when he said, ‘I assure you, Draco, it would never have come to that.’
‘It’s news to me,’ he replied, somewhat petulantly and perhaps it was the tone of his own voice that shook him out of it – because he refused to sound like a simpering fool in front of anyone – and made him say, ‘It’s possible I have a concussion.’
Draco opened his mouth to point out he wasn’t the only one who couldn’t decide on that and then closed it before he nodded, acknowledging now wasn’t exactly the time to get into the debate again. They’d gotten as far in their plans for the future as to agree they’d live in the Manor for a year with his mother while they got settled into their careers. Well Harry did and Draco just did whatever he wanted while the Ministry sorted out exactly what he was allowed to do. The plan was to finish stripping the Manor of harmful magic and further the renovations to make it into a suitable school for young children.
‘I didn’t upset Hermione,’ he told Weasley. ‘I received some alarming news from McGonagall that horrified her. I will not apologise for hitting you back.’ To Harry he said, ‘Kreacher’s already unpacking our things but he said he wants a word with you about the study at Grimmauld.’
Which wasn’t something to be thinking about just now. Draco focused back on the here and now and said, ‘I didn’t recognise either of them.’
It helped that his room was quite spacious, given he was the only eighth year Slytherin to return. Whereas the other boys had two or three beds in their rooms and had to share a bathroom, Draco had a large room and en suite bathroom to himself. McGonagall, perhaps foreseeing his desire to hide away, had provided him a comfortable couch, coffee table and a writing desk with a surprisingly comfortable chair. He had three large windows overlooking the Hogwarts grounds and columns of bookshelves between each one where he was slowly starting to store his books. He’d been calling on Kreacher and sometimes Winky to retrieve them from the Manor, it was easier than sitting in the library waiting for someone to hex him when his back was turned.
Harry cried because he could see his own life in Draco’s. He could see years and years spent being abused and neglected at the Dursley’s. He could see summers locked in a room with bars on the window, and years of physical violence from Dudley that was overlooked by his aunt and uncle because they’d never liked him, because they’d never wanted him.
‘I had this dream about what the future would look like, me and Ginny married, with three kids and it looked like the perfect life, just what everyone expected, but there were we on the platform saying goodbye to our kids and it was awful because I don’t know if I was dreaming about me and Ginny or my parents and what could have been because one minute I was me and then I was my dad and Ginny was Mum and,’ Harry broke off with a shudder and Draco tried very hard not to snigger.
And it is an awful thought, a horrible one, but it doesn’t feel horrible. It feels like maybe it’s an answer, one they don’t necessarily have to discuss now but, also, they really do.
They did have to coax him down to dinner eventually, which came and went with no sign of Draco. In fact there was still no sign of Draco late into the evening when people were starting to slip off to bed, some of them with the giggles and stumbles of the happily drunk. Harry had returned to the window seat to stare moodily out over the dark grounds and his friends seemed to have concluded they were better off letting him sit there and brood than try to get him to pay attention to their soft conversations. Even Hermione seemed to realise now wasn’t the time.
Standing on the platform, knowing that soon she would be on her way back to Hogwarts, Hermione felt a weight lift from her chest. For the first time in over a year she felt like she could properly breathe, that everything really would be okay now that Voldemort was gone. Looking around at the excited young faces, at the nervous awed glances of the youngest students, Hermione truly felt like the war was over. The quiet she’d left behind immediately after the war had felt like the world was holding its breath waiting for the other shoe to drop but here, now, standing on the platform, everything felt right again.
‘How can you stay in a world full of magic and wonder and never be able to experience it truly?’ Harry put to her softly. ‘How do you look at something so wonderful and know of its existence but never truly get to experience it? How do you let something like that go? How do you watch as the children you grew up with – your friends – go off to Hogwarts and learn magic while you have to go off and live in the muggle world?’
‘This is not why we’re here,’ McGonagall reminded them all, shooting a sharp look at Snape’s portrait before turning back to face Draco and Hermione. ‘I take it you have informed Miss Granger of the contents of the letter I sent you.’
‘They never dried and flaked off as they were supposed to,’ he informed her, without a hint of the wariness he’d felt when he first realised. ‘You and I need to have an interesting conversation about mine and Harry’s magic and the way it works together but we really don’t have time for it now.’
‘Ginny.’ Draco turned a page with a gentle glare aimed at the book (not Harry). ‘Also, Bill,’ he added.
Hermione gave him an unimpressed look. ‘If you’d said those things to me, I’d have chosen him over you in that moment – purely out of spite.’
There’d been a moment after Harry’s tears had finally subsided when Draco thought about sneaking away and cursing Weasley with something horrible (perhaps one of Ginny’s more vicious hexes?) but he’d known Harry wouldn’t want that and frankly, he didn’t want to risk leaving Harry alone.
He opened his eyes but didn’t raise his head from where it was pillowed on his arms. He liked the feel of Draco’s heat where his arms pressed against Draco’s hip. It was a solid reminder he was alive. He saw Luna first, she was a mirror of Harry’s position on the other side of Draco, head pillowed on her arms, face turned toward him. Ginny was the one who had been stroking his hair.
How had Granger thought simply wiping her parents’ memories would keep them safe? Why then had she taken the added step of moving them to Australia? And why now was she so upset that her memory charm couldn’t be erased. Why did she think anything had changed? Just because Voldemort was dead didn’t mean all the other things weren’t still a factor.
‘Stop!’ Draco snapped the order while Harry moved to block Mendenhall from stepping into the house, making sure the movement took him outside as well. The old auror paused sharply, one foot raised to drop onto the doormat.
Draco sat pressed back against the cracked leather, head tilted back to rest on Harry’s outstretched arm, enjoying the way calloused fingers stroked slowly through his hair. Harry had his back to most of the bar patrons (what few there were), curled inward, almost protectively around Draco. Their legs were pressed together and the hand that wasn’t threading through Draco’s hair had a steadying grip on Draco’s free hand. Draco’s other hand was occupied with a tumbler of firewhiskey.
Out of the air materialised a large sheet of parchment which she carefully manoeuvred until it was hanging from the wall behind the teacher’s table like a big ugly tapestry. On it was a map of Hogwarts. One more detailed than he’d have expected but one that didn’t have anything on the intricate spellwork of the Marauder’s Map. Another wave of her wand set some of the corridors and rooms on the map in a soft golden light – the rooms and pathways the Ministry curse breakers had already cleared. All the corridors and pathways the students needed to use every day. The library was bathed in gold, the Great Hall, all four of the house commons and the Hospital Wing. It was, looking at the map, only a tiny portion of the castle to have been declared safe but it was also a large portion of the areas the students used.
‘You’re doing so much,’ Hermione pointed out. ‘You’ve got private auror training, actual raids, you’ve got all your homework done, flown with Draco, you’re taking WSL lessons with Luna and I know you and Draco are trading auror and curse breaker spells – when do you sleep?’
‘I don’t like you, I don’t think I’m ever going to like you, but Harry does and Hermione seems to be coming around and – bloody hell, you’re friendly with Bill and Ginny and Luna adores you…’ he trailed off seeming confused by his own words. ‘You let Greyback into the castle and nearly got Bill killed but he thinks you’re alright. Fleur can hold a grudge like the best of them and she doesn’t hate you for what you did to Bill. I guess what I’m saying is – what I mean is – ugh why do you have to be such a slimy Slytherin?!’
‘But that’s what makes it so fascinating!’ Hermione declared enthusiastically, adding sugar to her tea. ‘I’m assuming there isn’t any spellwork in place to connect Harry’s tattoo of Sirius to the Dark Mark.’
Draco tried to think of a response that didn’t just draw back to his point about wild and raw magic and how easily he accepted its nature because he was a pureblood. He was saved having to do so by Astoria who slid into the chair at the end of the table, thumping her book to make her presence known. He thought she might have done that with a bit more force than strictly necessary but the scowl on her face gave Draco some clue as to her mood.
‘Yeah, okay, yeah.’ Harry smiled sheepishly. ‘By, Grandpa,’ he said it softly, voice filled with awe and he looked back over his shoulder multiple times as they left the room.
‘I will never expect you to like me,’ he went on. ‘But please don’t hate me because you think you should. If that’s how you feel, of course you should hate me, but don’t let Voldemort win by continuing to hate me because you think it’s what you’re supposed to do. I have changed and I think you see that – I think you’ve been seeing that for a while and it has nothing to do with the bond between Harry and I – but if you haven’t, that’s for you to decide.
Huffing indignantly, he changed his mind, ‘And now I’ll be eating in the kitchens, thank you very much.’
‘Come on,’ he coaxed softly. He scooped up the same jumper he’d slipped on for his trip to the owlery and found another for Harry and some warm socks for both of them. He helped Harry into the jumper and the socks and took his hand, lacing their fingers together and squeezing tightly before he led the way out of the room and down to the deserted common room.
pining (she could admit it, deep down, sometimes) after Ron, watching him be jealous and oblivious and downright rude when he struggled with his own feelings. She’d watched him be warm and supportive and so strong for her when she needed him, but it was all tangled up in guilt and fear and hope and…
And he would have lost them, he knows that. If they’d come home to find him in bed with Draco Malfoy (Slytherin, Death Eater, absolute git) they’d have thought he was drugged or spelled and fought against the relationship until it tore them apart. Because Harry wouldn’t have left Draco, not then, not after months of getting to know him – the real him – and seeing the man Draco could always have been if not for the ways his father had pushed and shaped him. This Draco, so fresh out of Azkaban, needed Harry. And Harry needed him. They were healing each other and, Harry hated the thought, but at this moment in time – or even just two months ago when he’d returned to Hogwarts – Harry would choose Draco over his friends.
Days later and Draco had honestly thought the conversation he’d been preparing for would never come. They’d filled their days with friends and Teddy (lots of Teddy, Draco was wholly unopposed to Andromeda’s shamelessly throwing her grandson at his godfather) and after finally agreeing to a dose of Dreamless Sleep, Harry had gradually lost the sadness until his smile always reached his eyes and Draco didn’t think he was the only one to breathe a sigh of relief when he saw that.
Winthrop at least had the curtesy to offer him an apologetic grimace as she held the restraints out to him. With a deep sigh he took the restraints she held out and snapped them onto his own wrists. The runes on the manacles glowed faintly, he wouldn’t be able to move more than a few feet from whichever of them they were tied to until they took them off him. They didn’t hurt, not really, but the pull on his magic was uncomfortable.
Harry had his own tattoo over his heart, because of course he did. He’d had it done during those two weeks Draco was at Hogwarts without him. The simple display of stars forming Draco’s constellation because he was exactly that much of a sap and he was okay with it.
‘He was proud of it, Harry! Proud to wear the Mark and be selected by Voldemort for his task. He’s arrogant and bigoted and the type of blood someone has matters to him. He was taught for
Charlie made a keening sound of devastation deep in his throat and beside him the witch – Marigold, she’d introduced herself – let rip a string of Tamil that Harry didn’t need to understand to recognise as emphatic profanity.
Carter didn’t seem to know whether to be impressed by the news Harry had really slain a basilisk or terrified that he was now in the presence of Draco Malfoy.
He didn’t think the room he and Harry shared was much bigger, but it probably looked it given there was only one bed and that Draco had crammed one wall full of bookshelves that he and Harry had steadily been filling over the last few months. They had a full-sized fireplace as well which, together with the rug Draco had taken from Grimmauld and had restored, made the room look cosy and inviting and hardly like a school dormitory at all. Which made sense given that this had once been a suite for married teachers. It certainly looked like the suite of a couple. His and Harry’s clothes hung together in the wardrobe, there was only one trunk stood at the foot of the bed – Draco’s much larger one which was filled with extra blankets, random things that didn’t have a home elsewhere and all that remained of Harry’s life before the war.
‘We’ll be sweeping the entire castle,’ McGonagall informed them. ‘There was a great deal of damage done during the war and not a part of this castle was left untouched by the destruction Voldemort and his Death Eaters left in their wake. Although there was a thorough sweep of the castle and grounds before reconstruction began, after Thursday’s attack on students it has become necessary that we sweep the castle again. We will search and assess every room, every corridor, the staircases and walls, furniture – everything must be cleared before we can resume full use of the castle.’
“And although it may not have seemed like I was listening, I was hanging on to your every word, Ms. Umbridge. Truly, I was. Absolutely riveting.” Draco’s words hung in the air for a moment as Ms. Umbridge realized what had been said. The class watched expectantly as her face swelled up like a large circus balloon, to the point where Harry nearly thought she was going to pop. She took a deep breath, which returned her face to normal, and pleasantly continued with the lesson right up until the bell rang, signaling the switch of classes.
“You’re no help,” Harry muttered. The beep of a car horn signaled them to Hermione’s arrival. She would drive the three of them to school, like she did every morning. At least she would be of some help.
The Weasley’s house was an odd mishmash of building styles and interior decoration. Originally, the house was a two-bedroom, two-bathroom. It was fine with just Bill and Charlie sharing one room and Arthur and Molly in the other, but then along came Percy, so they expanded the house to have four bedrooms. Then along came Fred and George, then Ron, and finally Ginny. When they couldn’t expand the house horizontally anymore, they went vertically. Now, at six bedrooms and three bathrooms, the house seemed barely able to hold itself upright. And, of course, each child left their mark. Crayon scribbles, stains on the carpet, and patched drywall that remained unpainted. At one point, Fred and George managed to knock down the wall between their bedroom and Ginny’s. Don’t ask. Despite its questionable integrity, Harry loved it. It was home, in the truest sense of the word.
“How dare you destroy your family like this? You are an ungrateful brat, and I know I speak for both your mother and I when I say that you should never have been born. You can forget about going to Cambridge. Forget about coming home! All you’ve ever done is ruin our lives. Your whole life was planned out and you stupidly went and disrupted it. Malfoy men only marry women, and no ‘son’ of mine is going to tarnish my reputation by being a goddamn faggot.” His father slammed down the phone so loudly that Draco jumped where he stood. The dial tone rang cruelly in his ears, leaving him absolutely sure that those were the last words his father would ever say to him. He stiffly held out the phone to the secretary, and as she was too busy with whatever online quiz her friend had sent her, he dropped it. It hung off the desk, bouncing slightly, the irritating dial tone still audible. Draco didn't notice the tears streaming down his cheeks, nor did he notice how he autonomously wiped them away. Out of habit, he looked over his shoulder to make sure no one had heard. His silver eyes met a single green one, and without wasting time, he raced out of the room.
“You okay?” The bartender looked at him with concern. “You’ve had a lot to drink tonight.” Her shirt was too tight around her chest—the buttons were barely able to keep the fabric together. Draco nodded.
Draco’s thoughts were speeding in perfect time with his heart as he ran outside the building and got into the driver’s seat of his car. His head was pounding like a drum, strobe lights flashing in front of his eyes, his ears ringing like a phone from the fifties. He felt as if he would be greeted by the warm embrace of Death’s arms any second now, and he knew he would accept it. Resting his forehead on the steering wheel, he took a deep breath, trying to calm down. Panic attacks struck him occasionally, and he knew what to do, but in the midst of everything, he had forgotten. Slowly but surely, his heart began beating as normal again. Draco put the keys in the ignition but didn’t turn them, and was just about to when he saw a person in the side-view mirror. Trying not to get nervous, he watched as the person walked to the passenger door and knocked. Harry Potter. It was Harry Potter. Why did that damn boy show up everywhere he went? Why couldn’t he get away from him? Draco rolled his eyes and unlocked the door. Instantly, he wished he hadn't. Harry slid into the seat without saying a word, holding an ice pack to his nose and eye. A pang of guilt wracked Draco’s body, and he internally reprimanded himself for feeling sorry for what he had done. He cringed a little, realizing how much he sounded like his father. Harry exhaled audibly through his mouth, and Draco sighed.
After a longer than strictly necessary shower, he and Harry dressed (Draco took control of that because Harry would be meeting with Pansy) and headed down to the Great Hall for breakfast.
Harry fired another Ministry spell into the air – a pacifying one – that slowly sank down over the street calming the remaining spell-affected muggles enough that their desperate attempts to crawl or stumble away were slowed and eventually they stopped moving at all. It was Draco who unleashed a barrier spell that roared away from him, wrapping tightly to the confines of the street, blocking any path that might let one of the muggles slip away or any new ones come to help. It would be up to the Ministry liaison to quiet things with the muggle authorities and especially any emergency services that responded to the square tonight.
for his wellbeing because it directly related to Draco’s own happiness. ‘I love you, so yes, yes he would fight for you.’
Harry looked back to Draco to find him looking at him. When he saw he had Harry’s attention he beckoned him over. Harry shared a glance with Bill, shrugged, and went to find out what Draco wanted.
They were in what seemed to be an open square, the muggle version of fairy lights were hanging around the area lighting up Christmas decorations and what looked like market stalls. The smell of warm fresh food was in the air accompanied by the crisp smell of fresh cut trees and Christmas. At one end of the square a small stage had been set up, instruments now lying abandoned as their players fled into the swarming crowd. Screams and terrified cries formed the backdrop now.
She did find Ron. She didn’t find Ginny but that was probably for the best. She let Ron hold her, let his anger wash over her when he learned what she’d seen and vowed to have nothing to do with Malfoy because there was no reason why she should let his return to Hogwarts ruin what was supposed to be her final year and the return of normality.
After witnessing the way he and Harry duelled in class she was left wondering what changes they were talking about. She’d thought they meant the way he was quiet now, the way he didn’t seek attention and spout off his horrible words and flaunt his money and his family name. Watching him duel with Harry, watching him more than hold his own with her friend, was something else altogether.
As much as he ignored it all, he couldn’t escape the whispers entirely. They’d been back at Hogwarts just four days and already the other students were gaining confidence, calling him a Death Eater and commenting on how he’d nearly killed three seventh years in an unprovoked attack. He had expected it to go like that, but it still stung that Granger – who’d witnessed the entire attack – never spoke a word to suggest it had been anything other than what the rumours speculated. He didn’t expect anything from Weasley, but he found, to his chagrin, that he’d expected a little more from Granger.
Harry took a step closer to the door, put his back to Robards finally, as though he’d said his piece. As though he didn’t have anything to worry about, turning his back on a man people considered quite powerful and adept in the field. He had one last thing to say as he passed through the door though.
‘Well, that’s one more that I didn’t know,’ said Bill, looking at the positive. He glanced back at his brother and Marigold before he asked, ‘Any chance there’s a doorway in the wards you can let Charlie through?’
Then they walked away, arguing. Everyone knew that it was a lost cause anyways, Hermione always gave in.
Harry let out an "oh, sorry." Then took the cloak off. He pointed the tip of his wand towards the map, "Mischief managed." Draco rolled his eyes and dragged Harry in by his wrist.
"Yes, love, of course," Harry says as he gives Draco a peck on the cheek, taking the basket from him, and opening the door for him. Draco happily skips out of the house.
"I don't think you even deserve to get what you want," Harry says darkly, smacking his ass once more.
"Hey Raven, where're you going?" Draco questioned, placing a small kiss on Harry's cheek, making him blush slightly.
Once the bell rang, he packed up his belongings and was met by Ron at the door. "Not eye-fucking Theo today?" Harry asked, teasing Ron. Ron blushed and punched him in the arm.
He hears a honk from outside then an automatic barking. He grabs his phone and bag, then goes downstairs. Dobby his dachshund was barking at the door. "I swear, if they don't stop honking, one day, I'll beat them with my glue gun." Harry chuckles, "Of course you will, love you mum." Harry kisses his mom's cheek, pets Dobby's head, then is out the door.
They sat down next to each other but didn't say a word. Other than that, class was just the same as the others, only Snape didn't care about introductions and just went over the syllabus until lunch.
They pull away and smile at each other. Draco never really liked the rain, it "ruined his perfect hair" but he now realizes that it's not the worst thing in the world. They just jump for a little while until Draco drags Harry back to the car.
"Cum-cumming," but Harry pulled his fingers out and grabbed a hold of the base of his cock, preventing his orgasm.
"Like everything I do is just a letdown, feeling like I always do the wrong thing. Telling all their friends I'm the bad kid. Now I'm on my own, I've lost my magic, dealing with your bullshit now I'm over it. And you took a part of me, left me with the memories oh, we were never a family, now you're standing in front of my door, like none of this happened at all. I guess I'm always gonna be the bad child, I guess I'm always gonna be the mad child, cause you will never understand my weird mind, my weird mind. And to every single person here that doubts me, telling me that they could live without me, cause they will never understand my weird mind, my weird mind."
"No, that's not my name and you know it, now, expect a punishment when you get back," he tightens his grip on his neck before fully releasing him.
They both take the ends and spread it out. Draco puts the basket in the middle as Harry sits down, crossed legged. Draco does the same.
Snape just looked at her, bored, "I don't care." Parvati just scurried to the seat next to Ron. He pointed to the second table next to theirs, "Longbottom and Nott," Ron brightened up at the mention of his boyfriend, who smiled at him as he sat down.
He sits on the toilet, contemplating what he should do. If he goes through with what he wants to, he's most definitely getting punished. He decided against it, knowing it'd be better to just get to Harry as fast as possible.
"So you don't love me?" Neville asked, amused, which made Blaise's eyes widen because he didn't get that Neville was just messing with him.
Ron was rubbing his side when they started settling in at a table. Snape stopped them in the process, "no need to get settled, you'll have assigned seating and partners." The class groaned.
"No, it's my fault anyways so it doesn't even matter. Let's just get this over with. Take your pants off." Draco scoffs.
I woke up, a little startled. I wasn't expecting my alarm to go off this early. I groan and fall back down onto my pillow.
"Not so loud," he hushed while looking around to see if anyone had heard, "and I don't do that-" but Harry had stopped him.
He was about to go back to sleep when he heard a male voice that sounded like he had been crying. He can't sleep, thinking that the man could be hurt or something.
"I know, but I want to get him something perfect. He's the best thing that's ever happened to me and I'll be damned if he isn't spoiled with everything he deserves or I will die on this rock."
"Well actually, asshole, it reminds me of your eyes." He says in an matter-of-fact way. Harry smiles with love in his eyes and leans down to kiss him with passion.
We made out for a while, taking small breaks here and there for air. After about 15 minutes we stopped because we did need to go to class.
"Yeah, wait here while I go fetch my broom." Harry just nodded and waited as he watched his boyfriend go towards the dungeon.
I look over in the far corner, seeing Harry with Hermione and Ron. It took a few years but they have finally come to terms with the fact that Harry and I really do love each other. They've come around and now accept me, wholeheartedly.
"Sorry, hon, Ron made us stop for food," a bushy haired girl said as she hopped out of the driver's seat.
He grabs a plain white T-shirt, a pair of black distressed jeans, his favorite rainbow checkered vans with some no show socks, and to top it all off, his red varsity jacket.
He realized he had zoned out, being brought back by Ron snapping in his face, "you alright there, mate?"
He soon had learned that green was his favorite color. Even if the only reason was because his soulmates eyes were green. It didn't matter, he loved the color.
Ron nudges Harry, "let's compare schedules while we can, we only have 5 minutes till class." Harry pulls his phone out of his pocket as Ron does the same.
Not even a minute later Draco came out of the door, looking around. "Potter, you've still got that damned cloak on, dumbass."
He stands next to Draco who is moaning like crazy, he then slid a gag into his mouth. He bends down real close to his face, turning it so he can stare into his pretty gray eyes.
"All good things I hope. I've heard a lot about you too, except for your name, for some odd reason," Draco said, sticking his hand out to shake Hermione's while side glancing at Pansy.
"I need to go to the b-bathroom real quick." Draco notices the crack in his voice and as Harry walks to the other door he can see a tear run down his face.
Harry contemplated just blocking Draco and going back to sleep, but he decided against it, this really was the only time he can talk to him.
Harry just took the elevator back to his own floor and went inside his apartment. He went into his bedroom lying on the floor.
It was currently 3:27pm, they had gotten out of classes not too long ago. Harry groaned and stretched as he stood up. Dinner started at 5pm so he had some time to do whatever.
"Huh? Oh, uh, yeah, I'm fine I just have to tell you something." He looks kind of concerned but I quickly reassure him, "It's nothing really, don't worry." He looks like he's trying to force a disgusted look on his face, "Worry? Malfoys don't worry, we have nothing to worry about!" I start giggling at that but immediately stop because Draco started to look at me like he was amused.
Fred and George had already gone to their next class, probably to prank their newest teacher, or as they called it, their "newest victim".
Draco had brought his polaroid camera to capture some cute pictures of their picnic and the flowers around them.
"Ah~ so-sorryyyy, Daddy~" Draco moans, trying to apologize but kept getting cut off by his own whines and moans. "Yesyesyes~ feels so good, don't stop~" Draco squeezes his eyes shut.
Draco bursted out laughing, "Oh my Merlin's beard, you should've seen your face," but he stopped when he saw the tears pricking Harry's eyes, "oh no, Harry, baby, I was just kidding."
Harry knows that Draco doesn't like him because he never acknowledged his presence, he never texts him just to talk, he hasn't actually talked to him at all for the past month and a half.
"I was planning on going to the library to see if I could find the jinx that was put on you and the counter for it."
They walked into the classroom as the bell had rung. The teacher had just came in behind them. "Take a seat so I can do roll call."
Honestly, I think I might start crying if he doesn't say something soon. Actually, I think it's best if he doesn't say anything at all. I turn around, ready to high tail it out of the great hall and run to moaning Myrtle's bathroom when I feel a hand gently grab my arm.
It has been about 20 minutes since he left Harry's presence and he was walking around Hogsmeade with a slightly nervous Blaise.
Draco just grabs Harry and pulls him in to hold him. "I'm sorry, baby. What I actually want to ask is, will you be my boyfriend?" Harry huffs and turns around, crossing his arms.
You see, it's their 8th year, they had to do an extra year due to the war. Draco and Harry have come to a mutual agreement that they aren't enemies anymore but they don't have a need to interact with one another. That agreement actually applied to the entirety of the Slytherin and Gryffindor houses.
"You got a little," Harry said while pointing to his chin, trying to tell Draco there was some remaining chocolate. Draco just rolled his eyes.
They both smile and Malfoy thanks him and he'll take the offer when he's ready. They both fell asleep knowing that they'll both be fine.
At that time a raven haired guy got out of the passenger side of the car. Draco hadn't even noticed him until that point.
He was just expecting to find his boyfriend doing something he does everyday like cleaning the dishes or taking a shower. What he didn't expect was to find the tragedy awaiting him in the bedroom.
"Padma and Parvati , so it'll be easier for you to work together. Neville and Lavender, Ron and Hannah, Susan and Dean, Collin and Zacharias, Harry and Draco-" She continued but he wasn't listening.
Draco had brought his polaroid camera to capture some cute pictures of their picnic and the flowers around them.
He looked like he was about to speak when the girl spoke up, "Hello, I'm Hermione Granger. And I've heard quite a lot about you, Draco Malfoy."
After he hears Fred honk. He puts his plate in the sink and ran to the car. "You guys have to stop honking, you're lucky mum wasn't home. Yesterday she said that she'd "beat you with her glue gun." They all just laughed.
Harry looks around the common room, it was empty except for Seamus and Dean who had fallen asleep in the chair sitting diagonally from the couch Harry was currently sitting on.
And who do you think you're talking to, slut? Should I even tell you where I am if you're going to act like a brat?
"I don't know why I'm saying those things out loud 'Mione. I think them and then say them, I don't mean to. What's happening? It's like I'm not in control of what I'm saying," I said, hoping that I didn't seem insane.
After roll call the teacher announced that they were going to project. The class groaned. "Oh be quiet, I'm also picking the pairs." The students just rolled their eyes and sighed violently.
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that, I didn't mean it." Is what I was trying to say but what came out was.
"Fuck this, I'm way too fucking tired to get up right now. Maybe I can convince Hermione that I'm sick, yeah, that's what I'll do," I thought, smirking, congratulating myself on my flawless scheme.
Harry run over to the curb and takes Draco's hand out of his jacket pocket with his own freezing one. "Come on, jump with me please," he asks giving him puppy dog eyes that he knows Draco can't resist.
"Huh? Oh, yeah. I just need to go to the bathroom real quick. You go ahead, I'll meet you there," he says, not giving Blaise a chance to tell him what store he's even heading to.
"Can you just get it?" Harry chuckled but nodded. Harry leaned over to him and licked the chocolate off his chin.
"I guess I'm always gonna be the bad child, I guess I'm always gonna be the mad child, cause you will never understand my weird mind, my weird mind. And to every single person here that doubts me, telling me that they could live without me, cause they will never understand my weird mind, my weird mind."
Draco turns to face Harry to glare at him. "The fact that you don't even know what you did wrong disgusts me to levels I didn't know existed!" He shouts.
He still couldn't help but think Malfoy wasn't as ok as he said he was. He didn't want to push it any further because he didn't know everything. He still couldn't think about leaving him.
Harry pulls out of the driveway and they head off. Draco turns on the radio, not too loud but just loud enough for some background music. Harry puts his hand on Draco's thigh which makes him beam with delight. He has told Harry how much he adores the little touches here and there.
Harry takes off his belt and shirt, keeping his pants on. Draco was currently on his knees so Harry laid down on his back, face directly under Draco's plump ass.
"Nothing, can we just get this over with?" This surprises Draco, Harry usually hates when they get finished too fast, he likes it to last as long as possible.
Hermione comes storming back to the table, obviously upset. Ron just looks at her questioningly, "I thought you were-," but she interrupts him.
"Draco, you need to calm down, I'm coming," Harry called down the stairs, smiling while rolling his eyes.
"There's pancakes and bacon for you in the microwave, I have to go to work but I won't be home to around 6 because I'm going to visit Petunia later," she says while kissing the top of his head.
"Yeah, I would have believed it if I wasn't, you know, your girlfriend," they heard Luna come up behind Ginny, pulling her away from Harry and in for a hug and a quick peak on the lips.
Harry looks over at Draco who is, quite literally, bouncing in excitement. "Babe, you need to calm down," Harry chuckles in admiration for his boy.
Yes, once school came around they both thought that this was a good idea. Take their aggression for each other and stress in general out on each other. Through sexual means.
"Yeah, me too, but I don't want my parents to know yet, but once we graduate we will let people know."
The car ride to school was filled with laughter and pain filled whines from Ron when Hermione decided she didn't like something he said or did and hit him in the chest or back of the head.
But immediately started laughing so hard their stomach started to hurt. "That was a really believable one," Ginny laughed.
The outfit that Draco was referring to was green lacy panties, black jean booty shorts, fishnets, a green crop top shirt that says "Master's pet" in black, black four inch heeled boots, and a black collar.
"Blaise, is this true?" Neville questioned, letting go and walking in front of Blaise to be face-to-face.
"Yes, I'm actually going to help, I like English. Oh there's Malfoy now, I gotta go, bye," he said while jogging up to Malfoy "Ready to go?" Malfoy just silently nodded.
"No, I don't think I will. But just remember, my name's the only one you get to moan out, alright?" He speaks, wrapping his hand around Draco's neck, getting his face really close to his boyfriend's.
Harry smiled down at him, rolling his eyes because he's gonna have to wake him up in 10 minutes to get him out of the car, but Harry just let him be.
Malfoy was his lab partner? He was kind of worried but deep down really excited. He looks at Malfoy, who was already staring at him, he blushed was he realized he got caught.
"No, no, please, daddy, I'm sorry. Please, please fuck me with your tongue like you said you wanted to~"
Harry pulls his tongue out, sliding out from underneath the blond. Draco whines at that but is smacked in the ass for it.
"Can you just get it?" Harry chuckled but nodded. Harry leaned over to him and licked the chocolate off his chin.
"Hell yeah, it is, and I also knew it was you who jinxed me, Hermione just told me I just thought that because I'm obsessed with you," god I really need to stop talking.
Pansy walks up to Hermione, "Hey baby, you still coming over after school?" Hermione sighed, "I told you, love, it's a school day, we'll have to do it Friday."
