"Sev, I have something to ask you."
"Minerva, I have something I want to tell you but I need you to form unbreakable vow. This information will change the history." Severus added.
"I couldn't tell you about the detail because I am not the best person who can tell. I'm not good with this stuff but I can give you few books. Read it yourself. The book contained full explanation about when your first heat, regular heat, contraception, pregnancy and lactation. It has content for Alpha too but not details."
" Griphook, Call Gornnuk here, told him a brief story about Harry's conditions. I need his assistance. And take a look at Potter vaults report. Who have the access to the vaults. Find out who the one steal from Harry. Don't forget to check artifacts and family heriloom lists. I am afraid some are gone."
Lucius left Severus and Remus and followed Minerva. He told her about his thoughts and Minerva told him about her plan.
"I am okay Moony." Harry said softly.
Harry awakened by the immerse pain in his lower part. Like someone casted crucio spell on him. His stomach like being ripped apart, his chest like being stabbed with a dagger, his body twitched few time, couldn't bear the pain he let out piercing scream before he curled up in fetal position almost fainted. He didn't have any power to move moreover stand and walk. He whimpered and clenched his stomach. He felt something growing inside his body. He tried to wake up but failed. He tried to grap his bed side but his hands lost it strength. After so much effort he crawled to the side table grabbing his potions.
They all shocked at the new truth. They knew James wasn't killed by Dark Lord since Lucius already told his version to them. And Remus already knew from James and Sirius's letters. But his death was beyond their imagination. Poisoned and burned alive. How cruel. That man was evil. He killed James because he was going to Dark Lord's side. So cruel and evil.
Both goblins nodded and proceeded everything in hurry. Draco and Harry waited inside Griphook's room. Draco was bit anxious but he gave Harry reassuring smile. Harry looked at Draco with awe expression. Draco was so reliable. He was so cool. Like king when gave his decrees. His Omega side released a content pheromones. He wanted his Alpha knew he was so grateful to him and made his Alpha knew how much he wanted to be with him. He felt so comfortable and almost sleep in the Alpha's embrace.
The wards somehow could be seen by naked eyes.
"Oh Merlin. It's worse than I imagined." Severus sighed.
"Okay let me summarise. Harry will be Harry Potter. We will have an exclusive interview about the blood adoption before we back to Hogwarts. Severus and Harry can act like a real family without afraid. We need a background story about how the blood adoption happened. As for their new appearance we could tell them it's the effect of the adoption. We could tell the truths to headmistress about Harry as Sev's son. We could tell her more if she can be trusted. We will do the same to Kingsley. Let's take baby step about this matter." Draco ended his summaries with humph. He didn't like the thought of McGonagall and Kingsley knew the truth. They could be trusted but he still wary.
Draco who hadn't fully cooling down after their heated snogging looked at his mate with lust. Harry provoking his patience with his cuteness. His mate trying to seduced him.
"What is your planing when in Hogwarts?"
Draco wanted to have a simple bonding ceremony but his mother wanted a grand party just like her favourite. He just need Harry's opinion about the party part. Not about the marriage part. He wouldn't let Harry said no for that part.
Minerva was like his aunt when he was student. She's maybe strict and firm but she was kind. She knew about his fur problem since the start and always help him when full moon. She provided him wolfsbane secretly without anyone noticed. Not even Dumbledore although Remus thought he must be knew.
" I hope you can read it with calm and civil. I do not want any unnecessary action and no wild magic. I've had enough." Gornnuk showed him the parchment and waiting for his response.
His Alpha was so smart. He felt giddy in instant. He missed his Alpha so bad. His omega side craving for his alpha touch. He missed his alpha calm pheromones. He opened the box in rush. There's a beautiful set of robes and a black can wrapped in thin cloth. Harry took out the robes, caressed the soft silk fabrics. He smiled widely. He's going to a date with his fiancé. He run to the bathroom in the study to change and finished not more than five minutes. He was so happy, he jumped and laughed. He wrote a letter for his mother and Cissa told them he has a date with Draco. He then took the cloth and opened it. He grabbed the black can and wait for the portkey to be activated.
The next morning, the two family had their breakfast in better shapes. They had simple full breakfast and finished shortly. Today would be a busy day. The Malfoys would do their blood ritual which took in several places inside the manor. They needed to renew the ward in several low magic concentration place. Liked in Dungeon, South wings, Attics, center basement, West wings, and several places outside the manor like near the stream, north quidditch pitch, east green houses, and under birch tree near the entrance of Malfoy woodland.
" Sure Dray. By the way, thank you for the bouquet. This is beautiful." Harry sniffed the bouquet and placed it on his lap. He then said with soft voice.  "Let's eat babe."
Dety, the house elf gave a simply yes madam then disappeared to prepare the banquet.
"Yes mother. The book surprisingly interesting. I can understand more from your notes. Why don't you teach us like this. I will get my mark higher. "
"You're engaged! Congratulations. I give you my blessing. After everything you've been through you deserves happiness and if that's mean being with Draco Malfoy. I haven't known him well but maybe this is the start. I want to know you and Draco more. I give you all my support. You are my honorary brother's son and you're my godson. I want you to be happy. I will be there for you cub. " Remus hugged him and squeezed his arm.
Harry was furious, hurt, and anguished. He couldn't believe the light wizards who he ever respected and he thought as family when he's young have done so far to make him to be their puppet. Harry was screaming, bawling and screeching. His whole life was lie. He was being obliviated, forced to hate his own mother, insulted his godmother, afraid of his godfathers and forced to be friends with those imbecile. He's screaming, bawling and screeching, his magic gone frenzied. His eyes unfocus, his hair stood out, his body unconsciously produced a storm that made papers, chair and desk were caught in whirlwind, he didn't realize he made the the windows shattered, he knocked up Griphook until he is unconscious. He even made Draco electrocuted when the blond boy trying to hug him to calming him down. Draco almost thrown away when he didn't let go of his hug, Draco finally casted pretificus totalus to stop the younger boy. The wild magic finally stopped, left the room in mess. Harry still laid motionless on his back, he glared at Draco in fury. Draco put his hand on Harry's shoulder tried to talk some sense to him.
"Yes sweetheart, we can. Remus Lupin is one of brave and loyal wizard. I didn't trust him enough but I know he love you. So he will be rational and open minded about our situation." Narcissa reassuring Harry. Her Alpha instinct tell her that Harry was nervous with their meeting tomorrow. She let her pheromones calm him down.
"Oh dear, I'm so happy. I can die in happiness. My heart almost combust by the warm feeling inside my heart. You are so perfect Love. This proposal is so perfect. I wouldn't take no for answers too. I will always say yes to you Darling. Oh Draco, you are so perfect for me. Have I told you how much I love you? I love you too much, I love you more than anything, I love you to infinity. "
"Thank you."
When he finished reading the letter, and looked at the desk, there's a package on it. How could he didn't notice there's a package on the desk when he entered this room. He assumed the package was hidden with spell and the spell off when he opened the letter.
Draco then casted silencing and then he introduced himself to Remus.
"Yes Love, I am sure. He is your mentor Harry. He is the one who teach you Patronus charm and many spells. He is your father's friend Darling. He's your godfather. I believe he has good heart." Draco rubbed Harry's knuckles.
After few minutes looking around the chamber they went back to meet Minerva in her office. They wanted to borrowed the floo network. Remus and Minerva talked a bit about teaching arrangement while Severus walking around looking at the paintings. He furrowed his eyebrows when he reached Dumbledore's empty painting. He muttered quiet spell and there's blue fog surrounding the painting. He cast another spell and another until the blue fog gone. He then walked back to Minerva and Remus. They bit a simple goodbye to Minerva and went to Malfoy Manor.
"I am okay with everything." Said Harry.
"Dray. I didn't do anything." He pinched Draco's hard nub make him halted his step. He smirked at Harry. His eyes gleam in mischievous.
"Sure. Let's go. I will show you your chamber. The location is not far from Severus's and Draco's. You will still have quick access to their room." Minerva lead Lucius to his chamber.
Harry could only blushed at his soon to be mother in law's comment. They're getting married in few couple days. He plead her not to held a grand party but he was threatened to be silenced if he didn't follow her plans. He could only sighed and nodded in defeated. His own mother even side with Narcissa. They scolded him for few hours until Draco saved him from their mothers.
Whilst Draco and Harry enjoyed their holiday in France, Lucius, Severus, and Remus spent their days looking for any information about old magic. They read so many books about ancient dark magic. They needed to know if their Lord was still alive or not. Lucius still had his Lord's wand. They tried to traces his magic and found that the wand somehow indicated that he's alive. They couldn't think why The Dark Lord who was mastered in wandless magic used a wand to face Harry in the last battle. Sounds strange for them. He could kill anyone without his wand. Why he used his wand in the battle, why he didn't cast a wandless protection spell, why he let Harry finished him without any force. There were so many whys and hows but they couldn't find the answers. Even Lucius who knew more secrets didn't have any answer for these questions.
" Ah yes of course, the first thing you will ask is about heat. " he snickered. Harry blushed.
"I will answer your questions but not here. Let's talk in more relaxed times. I invite you to come to Malfoy Manor. I will expect your presence at ten am tomorrow. And for the start. Harry is my fiancé. He lives with me and our parents. That's all the answers I can give you now. Tomorrow you will get more information but before you go to Malfoy Manor, I suggest you to go to Gringotts and meet Gornnuk. He is my vaults manager. Give this notes to him and he will know what he's going to do. I ask you to be open minded and don't do anything reckless. Don't ask any questions. Just do what I ask and I promise I will explain everything tomorrow in manor."
you leave the bar with a particular someone last night! I mean, it’s obvious enough who it is, but the least you two could do was wear different
“God,” he rasped, his throat raspy from all the harsh cries that had escaped him just before another thrust nailed into his prostate and a thumb ran over his leaking tip, making the blond whine with another small hiccup.
Potter felt the salty tears come before he did. Draco buried his face in the crook of his neck, letting his shields fall down once more; a mistake he swore to never do again, yet …
“She fucking
A stupid face that he didn’t know was smiling gently, a small huff escaping his chapped lips. “You think it was Ginny?”
A small, wavering smile broke out of the blond. “Is that supposed to be a good thing, Potter?”
maybe not immediately, but it was obvious enough.
Draco turned pink, and he knew there was no point in hiding it. “Ne—never mind.”
Draco let out a half-hearted scoff, shifting lower so he could nestle in the other’s chest as he hid under the blankets. “You find my insecurity adorable? You sadist.”
It was unfortunate that as the words were leaving Weasley’s mouth, Draco had been taking a sip of his coffee. He spluttered undignifiedly, placing down his cup again on the table as he ignored the other’s shit-eating grin.
There wasn’t much time to linger on it as the calloused hand on his hard, dripping cock started to stroke him at a hurried pace, with no finesse or teasing at all as the look on Potter’s face grew softer, enough to make Draco roll his head back with a broken moan.
Draco’s hole fluttered around Potter, making the other groan, the sound deep in the back of his throat. He couldn’t stop the tremble that left him as he attempted to rise, letting out a soft noise of pleasure when he felt the raven’s cock stretch him out so
He knew going to the club with Potter was a terrible idea—it was the git’s fault that Draco woke up passed out on the floor of his home, with absolutely no recollection of what had happened last night.
“Be patient,” Potter chided at him, clicking his tongue as the fist on platinum hair pulled just slightly—a warning. One that had Draco’s cheeks turning a pale crimson as he made a pathetic attempt to nod. That was when a hand snuck below his own fingertips, the grip on his hair slowly becoming loose, only for the blond to hurriedly tap three times into the other’s calloused palm because hell, all the wanted then was more, more, and
Potter smiled at him, running a hand through Draco’s hair. “Same.” The Slytherin heard him whisper a soft Scourgify, letting the earnest sweat and water on their body vanish into thin air like a cool breeze. Draco muttered something incoherent.
“I’m not,” Harry tried to say as slowly as he could, his patience running thin. “He doesn’t have a clue about anything that happened last night, like I just said.”
“Yeah, well,” Weasley sniggered, shaking his head at himself as he rubbed his ankle, “you don’t need to pretend around me, Malfoy, honestly—I always knew that Harry liked y—”
He heard Harry chuckle in bemusement behind him; then, without giving him another second to breathe, he thrusted in again with no such intention of being gentle, gripping Draco’s hips roughly to the point where he knew there’d be angry red marks etched on his skin in the morning.
"There you go," Harry cooed, tucking a pale strand of golden hair away from his pink-dusted cheek. "You can't just get enough of this, can you?"
“It doesn’t?” Potter spoke up in that same confident tone, but he could tell the bold arrogance had wavered slightly.
When Draco made a soft sound of protest, red tinting his flushed cheeks as the ache in his trousers grew painful to bear, Potter only responded by tsking at him and clutching a fistful of his pretty, pristine locks. Draco gasped, mouth parted to hiss out a likely insult, but it wasn’t until the other man sharply pulled his head back when he let out a sweet moan.
Draco’s mind took a few seconds to process what he’s heard, and when he did get there, he only managed to throw a wandless jinx at the laughing redhead as the door slammed shut.
Harry raised both eyebrows at him until they practically reached his hairline, a broad look that said,
Potter’s hand slid away, his fingers pulled out, and all the warmth that was tingling up Draco’s body washed away.
He groaned, his head dropping to the edge of the table with a dull thud. Draco heard parchment and glass inkwells clink and shuffle briefly around him, but he was too enamored about thinking of his damned grades to give a flying fuck.
Potter seemed to be surprised at the sudden change of mood, letting out a laugh as he placed a light kiss on Draco’s forehead. “Let’s get out of here, yeah?” he murmured.
“Make it up to me, then.”
“Fuck—fuck you,” Draco groaned, his head thumping back against the wall as Potter kissed him again, the same time as a hand found its way to his red, aching cock. But the Auror didn’t move—not in the way that the blond desperately wanted. He only fondled Draco’s erection, delicately watching as a bead of pearl-white precum appeared on top.
Call the curse-breakers, they need to break the spell!”
“Draco, listen to me—”
he blurted out, expecting an answer that somewhat ranged from ‘no’ to a down-right witty remark (you can’t blame him, Draco could be… surprising, sometimes)—but instead, all he received was a faint nod.
He gasped, suddenly struggling for air as he found himself shoved back and twisted, ashamedly bent over his study table, exposed and breathless. “Po—
It were times like this that drove Draco to the edge, helplessly aching for nothing but more, more and
Glassy, grey eyes held back tears that threatened to fall, a small whimper of a curse slipping from Draco’s lips. “Potter, I ca—“ he was interrupted as Potter delivered a savage bite of his teeth to his neck where a bruised hickey already lay, making the blond arch to the fiery touch as he instinctively jerked. “Wait,
“I’m the warden,” a woman said with a taut smile, offering out a hand. She chuckled to herself when Harry didn’t take it, his face blank as she clicked her tongue at him. “Never expected a female to take on a job like this, huh?”
for it as a quiet moan fluttered out of the blond.
Oh, Merlin.
Draco didn’t have to open his eyes to know that Potter was smirking at him. He snuggled closer. “Wandless magic. Show-off.”
“Do you have anything to do with Mr. Potter and Malfoy’s disappearance, Mrs. Weasley?”
that made his face go white, then—
The blond let out a small huff of approval, licking his lips as he hummed and tasted the sweet lip gloss that had been carefully applied there. It wasn’t often he cared so much about the way he looked—on usual days, he always trusted his cunning sense of fashion—but this was a different case. A different matter.
Harry flashed him a wiry smile. His hand traveled up Draco’s back, making him tremble slightly as it trailed over his shoulder blades, then up his bruised neck. “Well, from what I know . . .” Draco’s lips parted, letting out a near-quiet, breathless sound as Harry ruffled his hair, tucking golden strands away. “That’s when there’s tears and sweat sticking to your face, right after I fuck you just about anywhere, hard and rough, to see you moaning and whimpering so desperately . . .” He went scarlet under Harry’s intense gaze. “Just for me.”
—a slow ache that began stirring from below, twitching against the fabric of his pants. Draco knew his resolve was breaking, little by little, and so did Potter when he took his time rolling down the blond’s turtleneck, revealing…
But Potter didn’t reply, only rolling his head back slightly as his nape hit the couch, just before emerald eyes peered back up with a twisted laugh. “And what, exactly, makes you think I’m letting you come at all?”
All breath left Draco’s throat, because at that one moment that dawned on him, he couldn’t do anything else but let out a loud, muffled whine when Potter’s other hand slithered under his velvet skirt, fingertips trailing pale skin that sweltered under the heat before digging in harshly.
He choked on his own breath, the knot in his throat tight as he tried to cough it out.
“Malfoy!” said Potter, mimicking his high-pitched tone. The blond narrowed his eyes at him threateningly, right as the other broke into a genuine smile of mirth. But there was something else in those stupidly green eyes, too—an emotion he couldn’t read.
Draco looked hesitant as his gaze flickered to his bloodied hands, to the cell that he ruined, then to Harry’s pleading stare. He let out a shaky breath, taking one glimpse of the collar that had once been on him. On his neck.
“For your information, these are bruises,” he told her flatly, ignoring the faint ringing in his ears when short, broken pieces of the drunken party flashed before his eyes. “I got into a dirty fight with a wasted sod last night, and at the time, the odds were certainly not in my favour.”
“You are a hazard to society, Potter.” His voice was muffled underneath the blanket as only half of his face could be seen, earning a light chuckle from the other.
Potter hissed something in Weasley’s ear, something that quiet enough so Draco couldn’t hear. Draco watched in slight satisfaction as the redhead’s expressions morphed into irritation, disbelief, pure
Bemusement sparked in emerald eyes, but it wavered just as Potter leaned in once more, one hand tilting Draco’s head to his from behind with a dangerous kind of calm. His sultry mouth ghosted over the blond’s ear, just a few inches away from pristine skin—it was a move that made the blond tremble as he held his breath back in nervous anticipation, writhing against the fingers that slowly pulled back and circled his rim teasingly.
“Oh, you have all the symptoms, darling,” clarified Pansy, crooning at him as she brought a hand to his chin, tilting his head up in bemusement. “Neck marked with rosy bruises, red swollen lips, and I think I see a dent of teeth over there; bit of a masochist, was he?”
“Love,” his Harry whispered. He didn’t sound as tired as he was—and that was what frightened him. The defiance. “You can—you can lift yourself up, if you let me go.”
Draco gawked after them, right before deciding to close his mouth and curse Weasley to the darkest depths of hell.
the hardness that waited for him there—and this time, Draco was powerless to stop the long, pathetic whine that slipped out of him.
that seeped through.
Draco didn’t look up as Weasley entered his office, adorning a smile that was way too bright for his own good. Rubbing the bridge of his nose, he sighed as he put down his papers with a wince. “What could you possibly want this late in the afternoon, Weasley?”
Potter’s lips curled into a cruel grin as he forcibly held the blond down by the hips, firmly rubbing at the sensitive little nub that was buried inside of him whilst Draco held back a choked, desperate whine.
he swore—
Draco moaned brokenly, helpless as he bucked his hips up for more. Potter chuckled at him as he harshly thrusted in his fingers, all the while making the blond tremble as he teased his cock further. Heat pooled in Draco’s stomach as his eyes slowly started to lose focus, his body arching into Potter’s touch. His lips broke out into a whine, knowing he was close, then—
“Is there something I’m missing here?” said Draco, trying to sound bored and uninterested as he fiddled with his wrist-sleeve. From the way Potter spoke, it was lacking its usual temper—if anything, it sounded a lot more softer; pleasing to the ears, even.
His mouth went dry. “Yeah?”
“You’re flushed and sweating,” said Potter softly, one hand curling to the side of Draco’s face. He couldn’t read what was in those vivid eyes of emerald. “You need a shower. You don’t want to go to bed all sticky and wet, do you?”
But all the blond did was stare back just as defiantly, even as he was trying to fight the heavy lull of sleep that hovered over his eyelids.
Draco looked away, squirming and rightfully ashamed of how Harry could effortlessly make him feel so vulnerable and turned on. When he’d heard the way how Harry’s tone the slightest bit, deep and strained as if he were trying to rein himself in—Draco knew he was about to be fucked for the rest of the night, hard and rough and torturous.
Potter shoved his fingers in further, making the blond shiver in pleasure as his blurred eyes slipped shut, refusing to them water. The raven only smiled in satisfaction, rather pleased with himself before leaning in just slightly, voice hushed as his hot breath caressed Draco’s cheek.
“Why have so many dementors?” he found himself asking, his voice suddenly harsh.
“Is that…” she neared closer, staring at his throat in a delight that made him flinch. “Is that a
it was—
“I don’t
Draco felt the back of his legs hit the edge of his bed, against a strong body that held him up. His eyes were still flung shut; he couldn’t focus on anything else but the body that pressed against his own, and the warm cloth that wiped off the tears that had ran down his cheeks.
“Anything, kitten?” purred Potter, making another wave of hot warmth and arousal fill his head.
Draco huffed, giving in as he shifted on the couch and mumbled a curse. Harry offered him a triumphant smile, one that got him flipped off as he helped the blond get comfortable. After a few moments of shuffling along with the effort of finding his boyfriend’s favourite blanket (Harry calls it ‘Penguin’ because… well, there’s penguins on it), he finally stalked back to the living room—where the other was curled up against himself, visibly distressed.
He heard a gentle sip of tea, then the clink of a mug dropping to a table. “Well, considering what happened last night, I would’ve at least thought it merited a ‘good job, well done’ from the almighty Draco Malfoy.”
His depraved thoughts of careful planning only halted to a stop when he heard the sound of his doorknob clicking slightly.
And Harry realised, at that exact moment, that Draco looked
Potter made a raspy noise that sounded close to a growl as his fingers worked its way to his waist again, finding crinkles in the fabric from how deep he had pressed in earlier on Draco’s delicate skin, but he didn’t mind it at all as he pushed the blond
The woman only shrugged, turning away as Harry clutched unto Hermione’s forearms and helped her up. He felt something brush against his wrist and under his sleeve, but he paid it no mind.
Draco’s eyes finally flickered open, blinking up at Harry, shivering at the warmth that tingled on his skin, the towel now grazing his collarbones. He knew Harry could have easily cast a wandless Cleaning Charm, but he didn’t mind doing it the other way either. “I highly doubt you even know what ‘debauched’ means, Potter.”
Potter cast him a smirk, the two fingers knuckle-deep in his arse pulling out to rub at the blond’s sensitive, flushed skin. He slid his tongue past Draco’s glossed lips, tasting something rather sweet as the tip pressed against the roof of his mouth, swallowing every soft and lewd moan that escaped the other.
“I think I’ve wanted this for quite some time now.”
“Merlin,” whispered Potter, his words deliciously sweet. “I can’t wait to see how fucking
It came out harsher than he’d intended, and it wasn’t really the tone he was going for—if anything, Draco meant to sound like someone who was grateful for even having civil company in the first place.
Draco bit his bottom lip harshly, trying to restrain the embarrassing sounds he was making, but it only served as a challenge for Harry—his dark eyes gleaming, he slammed in one last time with a low groan of his own, more savage and ruthless than the last, earning a high-pitched moan from the blond.
Draco’s eyes widened considerably when he realised who he was, and parted his lips slightly to utter out a word—but almost instantly, his paused mid-way, harshly breathing through his nose as he hung his head low.
He shut out the warden’s yells, the panicked mutters of guards that tried to cast spell after spell at the door, and the hurried screech of metal in their ears. Harry didn’t waste time to help the blond to his feet, even as he was trembling just slightly.
as long as it wasn’t Potter’s stupid face.
Potter’s words were like a melted honey to his ears, sweet and tempting, and Draco was slowly drowning in them—he could only cry out again at another well-placed thrust, shaking as that one came earlier than the last, realising that Potter was almost close as a hot breath puffed on his fair skin.
It stayed like that for a few seconds. Their breaths were rhythmic; Draco was breathing through his nose harshly, his chest falling up and down at a pace as he tried to get rid of the inevitable ringing in his head. The hands on his hips have slid up, clinging to his upper body in an almost protective-like way that made his heart twinge.
Draco tried to stay still as the guard swiftly pulled out his wand, casting a quick Scanning Spell over him. “I don’t always wear a tight button-up suit, if you must know,” he stated coolly, ignoring the same disgruntled looks he received from his other coworkers that passed by.
a sob broke out from Draco, his thighs shaking from the merciless force pounding inside him—it was too much, he needed to come, he felt like he was going to
Draco blinked, swallowing a knot that formed in his throat at the blatant innuendo. He debated leaving, but then, Potter had a point—it would be near impossible to fall asleep without a good shower. But there was something else in the boy’s darkening gaze too; how it looked almost inviting.
A sound—most likely a faint yelp—echoed from his throat. “What?” Draco croaked, now clutching at the hem of his silken shirt like it was his only lifeline.
Potter only hummed back to him as a reply, which only served to make the situation much worse with all the slightly open-mouthed gapes and quiet whistles as he took in as much as he could of the blond. A crooked little smile was plastered on his face, green eyes finally rising to meet the other’s glower.
Until Potter slowed, nonchalantly pulling out as he inspected his fingers, coated and gleaming with thick saliva. Draco whimpered softly, knowing what mess he must’ve looked at the moment—hair tangled, his face streaked with messy tears that fell to his chin, lips plump and swollen…
at Potter, who was comfortably sat with his elbows propped up on the couch, as well as calloused hands that were raised to rest on the back of his head.
“Oh?” Pansy raised an eyebrow at him, right after sighing disappointedly with the back of her hand resting on her forehead. “How tragic. My childhood best friend remains a virgin, after all these years of fine men running after him.”
Draco let out a little breathy laugh, a glassy sheen to his eyes. “And what about you? What about the great Harry Potter? Hero of the Wizarding World?”
Draco knew all chances of stopping has disappeared now. He weakly angled his head up, letting Harry’s hands fumble around his school robes desperately as heat and white-hot arousal torched his skin.
He felt Harry stiffen, yet the voice that responded back was delicate. “I was just … so scared at—” he paused, smiling weakly. “—at how easy it was to be with you. My fears got to the best of me, Molly pressured me on, and I decided to …”
Harry found himself grinning at the blond's confused face. "Yes, I'm
He heavily exhaled through his nose, letting himself be manhandled as girdled hands touched him
Weasley’s grin turned entirely feral. “I thought you of all people would know, Malfoy, that it’s disrespectful to refuse dinner with your boyfriend’s family.”
Harry laughed, the sound strangely unfamiliar, even to his own ears. “No, it’s adorable, I just…” he glanced down. “I just think it’s sad.”
Potter leaned in on his ear, whispering softly, “Let me take care of you, Draco.”
“Propose to her,” Draco finished, his gaze travelling down. He should be pushing this man away from him, as far as possible; he should be fighting and kicking, but none of that urged him to move—not even the bittersweet ache in his heart.
“Wait—” he gasped when Potter’s hand slithered down and unto the hard bulge in his pants, caressing and palming and
“Aha!” Pansy grinned victoriously, jabbing a finger at his chest. “You got screwed over by a handsome gentleman last night, didn’t you?”
“You want that, Malfoy?” Potter murmured, and he could’ve sworn there was a fondness in his voice as his breath caressed the blond’s cheek—to which Draco only glanced away from, turning an exquisite shade of red.
“Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Potter, but I’m afraid your time is over,” the warden drawled outside the cell.
Even back then in Hogwarts, Draco had always been infamous for making risky bets that he always managed to win with a smug, triumphant smile—but not when he couldn’t even think straight with the rest of his ill-addled mind drowning in red
Potter threw him a triumphant grin, but Draco refused to react this time—he simply clicked his mouth shut, clearly not willing to satisfy the other’s sinful urges anymore. He shifted on the raven’s lap, shivering when a hand from his hips lowered further and below his skirt, leaving trails of feathery touches that made his breath hitch.
“Let me go, Potter!” he demanded, wishing the other didn’t hear the slight waver in his voice. Draco tried yanking his arm out of Potter’s grip, knowing it was already a lost cause when he was shoved roughly against the bathroom wall.
spell?” Harry spat out, prepared to hurl another thousand more of insults her way, but only for Hermione to stop him with a stern tug at his sleeve—a warning.
Draco shut his eyes again, letting out a broken sob that he hadn’t realised he was holding for so long. The pain was agonizing, making him feel like it was Sectumsempra all over again, yet this time …
Hell, even the bastard’s legs were parted slightly as if to mock him, partnered with a smug smirk on his face that made Draco’s jaw drop.
“What about Dra—” Harry silently cursed himself, his gaze falling down from hers. “What about Mr. Malfoy?”
Draco threw him a bored look, crossing his arms. "Yes, these ‘stupid NEWTs’—as in, the exam that would either land you in a high-class AOE occupation in the future, or some pitiful job in the streets. Totally unimportant."
“You’re gonna be late,” Draco pointed out, making the mistake of standing up too quickly as his knees gave out underneath him—Harry only had one moment to react before reaching out straight away to steady the trembling blond as a pained groan fluttered between them.
“Gods,” Potter groaned, using one hand to press the blond’s head deeper into the wall as a hand snuck its way to the crying blond’s hips. “Just like last night.
He found himself screaming, shouting curses and half-croaked cries, but all of it happened too quickly. The hand he’s once held slipped, and Draco hated it. He hated how the bastard smiled weakly, how he glanced at him one last time, leaving lingering touches on his skin that felt like a sparking wildfire.
that it was cruel and ruthless for someone to be locked away in here for—for the rest of their
So, Draco lifted his chin. Looked into those eyes, that rough jawline, and let his gaze slip downwards. “Make me.”
really trying.
Instead, Draco let his competitive flare arise inside of him, knowing that amongst all other traits, this was one that Potter knew too well—he never backed down. So, with hands that refused to tremble, he rolled his head back slightly as his eyes slipped shut, blinking them open a mere second later with a gleam of the very same, cunning Slytherin he used to be.
Draco groaned, crossing his arms. “Fine. Go ahead, you brute.” He watched Pansy shoot him a grin, her manicured hands carefully plucking out a bottle of thick, pale cream from the counter.
Even if it meant he’ll have to deal with Robards’s one hell of a shout-fest later.
“Potter,” he breathed, realising just now that Potter’s tongue was no longer fucking him—instead, it was his hard cock, slowly filling his hole up. Draco whimpered as the raven began noisily sucking at his neck with open-mouthed kisses at the same time, teasingly reaching up and licking his earlobe. He felt his wilted cock harden again, making him moan in protest. “Potter, I—”
“You don’t need to heal them,” he added. “Just cover it up with concealer or something.”
Unmistakable horror crossed Harry’s face. Then; a nervous laugh. “You want me to walk in there and say, ‘Hey, I fucked you last night during the party—oh, and don’t forget, we did it on your bed afterwards, too?’”
“Who shagged me?” Draco studied Potter carefully, taking note of tense posture and labored breathing. Then, he shrugged. “If I had taken a clear look at him, then I might’ve remembered.”
he could almost hear Potter croon, his breath hot and warm against his cheek,
“Oh, I don’t know, maybe the fact that we—that we—” Potter let out a string of curses, “—that you’re my Auror partner!”
and with it, a shallow thrust that elicited a cry from the other, one that dangerously neared a sob.
Potter began snapping his hips forward again and soon, white noise and static filled his ears, his mind blank and hazy. Draco couldn’t focus on anything but the hands touching him, the bundle of nerves abused inside him, the way his eyes rolled back as incoherent words tumbled out of his mouth…
And there was something, something unexplainable that made his head spin. “Y—yes,” he stuttered out, and he swore he saw Potter smile right before thrusting in with no such finesse.
Draco’s chest rose and fell in an uneven pattern, his breathing hard as he glanced at the other man with a confused look.
“I told you—the prisoners needed to be taught a lesson,” the warden answered airily, as if they were no more but two friends talking about the weather. “There are some that we personally keep in their cells from time to time so they could learn how to behave.”
“Don’t be so crude,” Draco snapped and, for the
Draco watched, frozen and shaking as Harry fell into the forest of flames, engulfed by the rolls of white-hot embers and scarlet that buried his body beneath. No, no
Mornings were not spent waking up in each other’s arms anymore, with his back to Harry’s chest that rose and fell slowly with each snore, and arms wrapped around him in a gentle, protective embrace.
Draco couldn’t breathe.
“You have got to be kidding me,” said Draco flatly, glancing to the side as his hands twitched and fiddled with the fabric of his dress. He furiously kept his gaze down on himself, trying to fight the intrusive scenarios in his head that seemingly appeared out of nowhere, ones that made his hands curl in on themselves anxiously.
Draco couldn’t help a confused glance at Potter when his fingers pulled out, his hips shifting below him for a bit, only to realise what he was doing when black-leathered trousers were taken off at the thighs down at a particular point, perfectly lowered to reveal a—
All of it made an unpleasant feeling settle in the pit of his stomach, but what made Draco falter was the familiar burn in his eyes—and the sudden blur of the room.
Draco grimaced, his shoulders going taut as he sauntered through the quiet halls, too distracted by his own thoughts to bid the guard farewell. Partner. Potter. Of course. He scrunched up his nose in disdain, unconsciously preparing himself as he reached his office. Potter’s office. Their office.
“Hey, Malfoy!”
The feather of his quill brushed against his cheek as he began scribbling down on one of the documents. The blond heard a muffled choke beside him—which sounded rather vile, actually—then the splatter of warm tea that soiled the marble floors. He didn’t bother looking up, dipping his quill with ink again.
Draco had to grip on to the last of his dignity to try and not look down. “I—um, yeah. Okay. But, um—I can’t use—this one’s only—”
He held in a breath as they descended further into another deeper part of Azkaban—and what made his stomach churn and his head dizzy was the awful, sickly smell that filled his nose and the lifeless shadows that trailed after him.
Draco let out a gasp as Potter pulled him
like I’m on the run.”
“You’re so much better when you keep that little mouth of yours shut,” breathed Potter, his voice nothing unlike the gentle caresses of his thumb across the other’s cheek. Draco’s mind must’ve gone blank, then, because didn’t find himself pushing or fighting back against the lips that captured his own.
A small smile. “For what?”
As far as Harry knew, his boyfriend never got sick.
Draco took all of Potter in, right before staring back into that expectant gaze and approaching with a light simper. He had danced with other men before, and always knew what to do to rile them up—he always made sure to never break eye-contact, to tilt his head at a perfect angle so that the light would make his eyes shimmer like melted steel, and to lick his glossed lips with an innocent smile as he swayed over.
The man in front of him resembled nothing like the Malfoy he once knew—his pristine hair had gone limp, strewn all over soiled skin that was littered over with scars. An iron collar choked him, and cuffs on his wrists held him up—chained to the wall like an… like he was a—
Draco let himself nuzzle in the crook of Harry’s neck, breathing in tiredly, focused on the heartbeat that thumped with his perfectly. He felt his consciousness fall into a peaceful slumber, darkness engulfing his body like a thick blanket, and—
and…”
He should’ve known from the very start that it was a terrible,
And yet, he ignored it, forcing his own body to relax and melt to the soundless rhythm as he slowly inhaled. The Common Sense in his head was screaming, but he shoved that away too.
Draco threw his head back, swallowing harshly as a gentle finger traced down his chin, his jaw, then his neck, peppering them with feather-light touches, one that made his breath stop entirely once it ran down his throat—
Draco curled closer, each breath seeming to slow. He didn’t want to move; this was what he wanted. In his lover’s arms, listening to each beat of his heart, making it so that it matched his own.
“Shit,” Draco whispered, feeling the familiar rush of hotness rise in his cock. He shut his eyes tightly. “I need to—” another sob escaped his body, making him tremble. “Potter—”
Draco collapsed, his breath puffing out over his cheek, his eyes near fluttering shut. He moaned softly when he felt the inching thickness inside of him pull out, slowly, only realising what the slick, wet substance that slavered out of his throbbing hole was. Harry had come inside of him.
that’s not fair! What—what the
Call Draco selfish,
“Stop talking,” mumbled Draco, and just about when he felt like the soothing darkness of sleep was about to claim him, he heard Potter speak softly once more.
His body wracked in shaking, uncontrollable sobs. No, Harry would never do that to him—he would
The kiss was nothing sort of the innocent—it was messier than those they’d normally share, but Draco loved it. He loved the brutal tongue that fought against his, loved the teeth clashing together, loved the thread of saliva linking their lips after they pulled apart.
As calloused fingers found their way into Draco’s locks once more, Potter’s mouth hovered over his collarbone before sucking, causing the blond to release another high, desperate whine.
“Draco!” Pansy’s head slipped inside the bathroom, her eyes going slightly wide as she took in Draco’s half-naked body, still sheen with trickling water running down his backside. “Looks like someone had a fun night.”
Harry walked over to the doorway, bringing up one hand to the wall for support as he hastily kicked off his steel-toed shoes (those were
Draco tried again for another roll as he lowered his hips further, his lips parting slightly to release a small, breathy moan—one that made him flush instantly in embarrassment as he exhaled shakily through his nose.
He looked back to Draco expectedly, swallowing when only a soft gaze greeted him back.
Potter looked innocently at him, feigning concern. “Crying already?”
The woman’s eyes twinkled. “Now, I’m a very busy warden, so are we going to visit Mr. Malfoy or not?”
He knew that the moment he heard the soft wails that echoed around each breath they took, felt the abrupt warmth that the darkness embraced him with, shivered against the heavy magic that were hauled on his shoulders—
“Potter,” said Draco calmly, not looking away from his desk. “Do stop that.”
making Draco let out a cry as his eyes rolled back.
Harry’s gaze flickered to him, catching on quickly as to how the other had gone unnaturally still, most likely from his rapid reflexes as a well-trained Auror that allowed him to notice the tiniest of things.
“That was when a prisoner tried to escape,” she informed him, her voice dangerously soft. “They needed to be taught a lesson.”
There it was again. The way his voice fell a little too flat, the sudden tightness that clawed in his throat, seemingly making it harder to utter out a word.
Something like a wild, fierce anger roared in his head, yelling at him, brewing a storm that raged in its wake—and even if Harry had the chance to force it down, he wouldn’t have taken it.
Draco started stuttering furiously as a smirk danced on the raven’s lips, only taking a quick second to swiftly gather what was left of his ruined dignity as he narrowed his grey eyes at the other.
“Good luck.”
“So,” she started, unsure, “you want to
Draco sat up straighter in his seat, swallowing. “Right. Thanks.”
When thick silence answered her back, she finally dared to throw a glance at Ron. Heavy splotches of red were painted over his freckled cheeks, an evident tell-tale that told her about how upset he had been earlier—and with it, tired eyes that blinked back furiously, mouth wobbling as half-coherent words tumbled out.
“Why?” he asked one more time, maybe because some silly part of him hoped that the boy behind those doors was still human.
Potter,” he said, rolling his eyes as he neatly placed his quill beside his papers, just before turning his whole frame towards the other Auror. “Why? Do you happen to know something that I don’t?”
“Yes?” His voice sounded so far away. It didn’t sound like his.
Harry didn’t do anything—he just held him there, rubbing small circles beneath his shirt, mumbling sweet comfort. The blond quivered, his breathing slowing down when he felt a kiss atop his head.
said Potter in disbelief, only urging on to make the other’s grin twist into a choked laugh, their throats too raspy and used to do anything else. “I hardly think a
“Just you?”
Potter slammed home as Draco cried out, releasing his come unto the white-splattered walls as he felt something as equally as dirty and wet fill his insides. “F—fuck.” Potter came inside him. Potter came inside him.
“What are
Potter shrugged, defiant eyes raking over his body before meeting glossed eyes of grey, his lips pulled into a grin. “So?” he answered with a challenging glance towards the other before leaning in to lick on the blond’s collarbones, letting his teeth graze over the delicate skin.
He felt like he was suffocating, his breath puffing in the smoke-white air that made his skin tingle. His eyes fluttered shut, and he could’ve sworn he passed out for a few moments then. He couldn’t hear anything, not when high-pitched screams and cries for help echoed above.
He quickly shook his head, glossy eyes meeting his. “No,” Draco whispered. “Don’t—don’t stop. Please.”
“Did I tell you to come?”
“Gently?”
Trembling, Harry reached out to cradle his face in his hands, a face that now felt strange an unfamiliar to him—only for the other to flinch, as if he were waiting for him to strike.
Too worked up to wrap his head around the thought, Draco focused on trying to inhale right. His breaths came in short pants, tiredness suddenly crooning at him and making his legs shake as the cock inside him drew out with a slick pop.
The raven snickered at him, plopping a hand on a pillow that sat on the side. “Lay your head down here.”
“Harry?”
Maybe if Draco wasn’t so intent on ranting his messy, scribbled thoughts out, he would’ve noticed his Auror partner cautiously get up from his desk and make his reckless move towards him.
Draco could’ve sobbed by then, an all-too familiar heat beginning to bloom in the depths of his stomach, rushing to his cock, hard and flushed ruby. Shuddering moans slipped past his glistening lips, sheen from the saliva dribbling on his chin, the lewd sounds of barely restrained slaps of skin filling his ears.
you’re not in
Harry let out a groan of agony beneath him.
Potter thrusted into him, more viciously than the last, needling out a scream from the Slytherin that bounced off the walls. Before Draco even knew it, tears were already running down his face from the blissful pain washing over him. “Fuck—oh fuck—please let me come, please—”
Draco gasped. A white-hot feeling burned through his skin, his mind unfocused, his mouth warm against another. Potter held him close like he was a one-in-a-million chance, like Draco might slip through his fingers if he looked away for even just a second.
“Shove off,” muttered Draco irritably, earning a laugh from the other as he finally collected enough courage to throw Potter a glance.
Draco’s mouth parted in disbelief as Harry kicked his shoes off, his jacket falling from his shoulders as he let out a loud, contented sigh. A question sat on the tip of the blond’s tongue, but he couldn’t find it in himself to speak with his sleep-addled mind as he simply watched, utterly
Draco felt himself go hot, and it didn’t help that there was a particular traitorous part of his body that went stiff. He settled on for a cool and collected voice, trying to put on his Malfoy mask. “I meant the other showers were locked, and I don’t think any of my housemates will be remarkably happy once they wake up to me showering in the dead of the night.”
“Breathe for me, okay? Can you do that?”
Draco didn’t hesitate to lift his hips immediately, and along with it, his knees—this whole dare was ridiculous, anyway, he’ll murder Pansy for it later—as he made a move to hurriedly get up from Potter’s lap. He heard himself mumble something, a quick ‘sorry’ maybe, but it was too late for him to process anything else as Potter growled and yanked him back in.
Draco assumed someone had dropped him off at his apartment, but even the thought itself was almost impossible to consider—none of his friends had enough free time to accompany him to the party with Potter, thus excluding them out of his choices and leaving out all the do-good Gryffindors.
The Warden stared her down.
“Actually, thank you for reminding me—“ the redhead propped himself on his elbows, leaning forward on his desk— “‘Mione told me she actually
A rush of fear and lust clutched at him, because Potter was right there, inches away from his face, perfectly naked that Draco swore he could feel a steel-hard erection brushing lightly against his thigh—
snarled Draco, and for once, his voice has never been more steady. His own hand clung to Harry’s in an iron-grip, and all that was in his mind was to never let go. “The emergency team’s going to come soon. Just—just hold on. Please.”
When padded fingertips reached the far end of Draco’s mouth, hitting the back of his throat, tears had welled at the corners of his eyes, threatening to fall—and Potter must’ve seen it too, because the harsh grip on his hair slowly paused and let go for a bit, and the nails that dug into his skin pulled back.
But even then, a ruthless prison like Azkaban was no place for something so filled with life. He could tell that the leaf was slowly wilting,
“Mr. Potter?”
“Well?”
But a weak noise of protest had his head snapping up.
But when shifting his body even for just a quick moment felt like a dagger violently piercing through his head, Draco would much rather drown in his sea of blankets for one week straight.
It was only then did Draco realise with a small tremble that the wet trails on his flushed cheeks were
He could already imagine the bastard’s head perking up like a deer with his lips pulled into a wide grin. Draco didn’t know why, but he knew Potter at least delighted in the sweet satisfaction that came with all the humiliation.
Draco stilled, glancing up with a tilt of his head. “For what?”
“I have my ways,” Draco whispered back, his words a tiny bit drowsy as a small smile broke from his lips, even if they ached as he did so. “Unlike you, I suppose, especially when it comes to the topic of fashion.”
Draco gasped against the knee that had managed to bury itself between his legs, rubbing against the warm fabric of his trousers tauntingly. Harry chuckled, using that as an advantage to lean forwards, slipping in his tongue inside the sweet cavern of his mouth.
Draco groaned loudly again, vaguely wondering if he'd be excused from the test if he jumped out a window and got out the next day with a twisted leg and a mild concussion.
“Hey,” Potter murmured into his ear, carefully rubbing circles against his back as to soothe him.
This time, Potter didn’t hesitate to pull on Draco’s hair tighter, eliciting a hitched moan that fluttered from the other’s bruised throat as he drew out two fingers that were slicked with sheen, wet saliva.
Draco burrowed himself deeper into the pleasant warmth of his soft blankets, letting out a breathy sigh through his nose. He attempted to roll over, tired eyes blinking to a silver clock that stared back at him, only to realise that it was still five in the afternoon—it wasn’t until midnight did Harry come home from work.
Draco flushed darkly, kicking her in the shin as hard as he could, but after having dealt with his antics for centuries, Pansy was practically immune. “Out, you
Potter cocked an eyebrow at him. “Oh?”
“Just—” he let out a wild sound when Harry dug his knee deeper, making his cock twitch in desperation. “Just fuck me,
Potter’s chest rumbled with laughter. “I shouldn’t even be surprised. Are you still on with that shower or not?”
“Draco,” Harry rasped, his voice barely a whisper. His face was so bloodied, adding to the dirt and soot that had smudged his skin—and yet, Draco thinks he’s never looked more handsome.
Draco tried to jerk his wrists away from Potter’s stern hands, but the other was having none of it. The blond let a soft moan fall from his lips because gods, he was so close, just a little more—
The cold warmth of holding a bottle of firewhiskey in his weak grasp, the laugh that had bubbled in his throat when he laid eyes upon a familiar green-eyed man, the frantic, passionate kiss they shared as whispers of ‘I’ve been waiting, waiting so long for this,’ was painted on his skin, and—
“You don’t wanna look at me?” Potter smiled coyly, aware of how Draco’s hands suddenly twitched and became restless against the couch. He could most likely see the way how the blond’s own cock twitched underneath his silken skirt, pulling away from his body, dripping and flushed to the tip from being unnoticed for so long.
He felt like he always knew; in a way, at least. Damn Potter for always being so bloody fit.
“Good boy,” Potter praised softly, making the blond keen as a drawn-out whine was torn from his throat.
Draco knew it wouldn’t do him good to throw out an offhanded comment, so he willfully spun around, a steady flush creeping up his neck.
Pansy swiftly parried his attempts at pushing her away, her lips pulling into a broad, devious smile that alarmingly reminded him of a particular, nasty cat that was up to no good.
“I advise you to stay still,” she told him decisively, arching an eyebrow before peering down on Hermione. “I’m afraid to disappoint you, Mrs. Weasley, but our little prisoner here is only allowed one visitor a month.”
Yesterday was a little exception—an attempt to see if they could become something more; an attempt to see if they could go from simple coworkers to…
have a rather intriguing night with a besuited bloke?
Draco kept his eyes shut, only realising that his back had arched off the wall and was pressing unto Potter’s powerful body. “Potter,” he whined, not quite sure what he was asking for. “Potter, come on, I—”
And gods, Draco tasted so
He made a strangled sound when he felt warm, sweltering skin press against his back; and even if he tried, Draco couldn’t help but buck his hips back with a quiet moan. He felt Harry’s lips come up to his earlobe, his voice derisively soft—enough to leave lingering burns that left its crimson marks.
Harry shifted below him, and that was when Draco realised with pure terror that the calloused fingers gripping his own was slowly beginning to uncurl themselves.
The door swung open, slowly, letting out a long creak. He caught a glimpse of shimmering silk, then a tangled mess of black hair beneath, and—
Draco groaned in frustration, trying to swat her out of his sight. “Out, out, out!” he hissed, muttering a curse when his elbow hit one of the intricate glass vases on the counter.
Harry threw him a genuine smile as he tucked himself in beneath the cosy blanket, humming pleasantly when he finally got comfortable on his side, just before looking to Draco and spreading his arms out. Inviting.
Ron had caved in almost instantly. His trembling body went still for a moment before melting in the warmth that welcomed him, burying his face in her neck. Hermione didn’t hesitate to lift a hand to his ruffled hair, rubbing tiny circles on his back as a way to soothe him.
All of it was too much, and Draco felt like collapsing from the blinding
He couldn’t stop the smile that graced his own lips later when he told Harry about it—when he told Harry he finally had a family that wanted to welcome him with open arms.
Another flush furiously took over Draco’s face, and he didn’t hesitate to take his hand off his mouth as he parted his lips slightly to throw an off-handed remark—this was when he caught the glint of challenge in Potter’s eyes, just as the hands on his velvet waist pushed him
It was painful. Draco’s breath caught in his throat. Was he—
drink more than he remembered? What if he
This time, the kick that Potter gave Weasley was much sharper. The redhead cried out, knocking over Draco’s pile of colour-coded files and unto the floor. Draco would’ve been delighted at the sight of Weasley bouncing around on one leg at any time, but the fact that his papers were sprawled on the floor
It was different.
and casual trousers.
Harry looked to him, eyebrows knitted in confusion.
He didn’t hesitate to kick the collar away a moment later, his eyes focusing on Draco’s neck—there was a pale strip of white there, stark against the rest of his skin that was marked with bruises. Bruises that had been thrown out there with no mercy, bruises that had never been able to heal properly, bruises that looked like they were
Draco stiffened, his mouth going dry as he forced out a half-hearted attempt of a sneer. “I don’t think I’m entitled to share anything with you, despite being your
His mouth was soft and warm, even as he drove his calloused fingers through ivory-soiled hair and felt crumbs of dirt scrape his skin. His entire world tilted, and nothing else could’ve mattered then because he missed this—his body
It only served to make Potter chuckle darkly, low and guttural as he leaned in.
Potter,” he whispered, his hands curling uselessly against the leather couch.
“Either way, you’re gonna do whatever I say, aren’t you?” the croon was soft and taunting, and his face burned when he knew that the words were true. “I told you earlier—I wanna see you
he adored the other’s dedication to his work, and he always relished in every moment that he got to spend with him. He knew how much Harry loved being in on the action, even if that meant coming home with a bruise or two.
“What’s it gonna be, Malfoy?” Potter asked, voice low, as if he couldn’t see the tears that Draco were desperately fighting to keep from slipping down his rosy, flushed cheeks. “You’re gonna let me cum then leave you here, all alone, until someone finds you like this?” he chuckled as he brushed against the blond’s abused prostate once more, watching as the maid-clad other was helpless to stop the sob that fell from his lips.
“Well…” Draco let out a small sigh, his blood-spattered hands rising up to his face as he clawed at his hair frustratedly. “What do you want me to do, Harry?”
“It was a mistake,” whispered Harry, nuzzling his nose in his crown of blond locks. “I realised I was missing on the best thing that ever happened to me.”
A stuttered sound of surprise left Draco as Potter shoved three fingers at once into him, pressing into the small, warm nub that was buried deep within, making his body thrash before a high-pitched whine left him once more. Potter finally backed away from the kiss, breathless as so was the shaking blond, just before him an entirely wolfish look.
Those lucky moments didn’t come too often, but the letters that the other always left him with poorly-drawn smiley faces told Draco that Harry
The collar.
“Mm.” The hand on his hair stopped, and Draco ignored the heavy ache of disappointment that tugged at his chest. “How can you tell?’
the chase.” A weak laugh. “And after you marry me, the chase is over. You’ll get
“Oh? What are you, his support system?” the warden finished her Scanning spell, leaving tingles to dance on his skin. She let out a short laugh at her own words, but Hermione didn’t look amused in the slightest. “Here, Mr. Potter—hand over your wand.”
him in a way that sent perfect shivers up his spine— “fuck, Potter, wait! The…the locking charms—”
He wasn’t just some other
Unthinkingly, he started fiddling with the buttons of his shirt whilst kicking his dragonhide boots out of his feet rather ungracefully at the same time. Draco knew that if he ever saw someone treat such precious items like this in the future, he’d internally cringe and wonder what type of people taught them to be so crude.
“That’s what you’re worried about?” If Potter didn’t look so incredulous, then Draco might’ve taken him more seriously. “Merlin,
A high-pitched moan fluttered from his throat, and Draco swore loudly a moment later. Potter only laughed—fucking
“Pff, as if you even have one,” she scoffed, checking her nails. When Draco made another attempt at shoving the woman out of his bathroom, she quickly raised her hands in surrender.
right against the clothed cock that perfectly thrusted back in the cleft of his arse.
“You taste like cherries,” Potter whispered lowly, voice thick as his words elicited another whimper from Draco, whose pale skin was utterly sheen with sweat and the thinnest threads of saliva here and there.
“Fu—fuck you,” gasped Draco, realising that Potter was shamelessly rutting into him, brushing against his obvious erection. A shaky breath left him as the other boy dived in, hiding his face into Draco’s neck, sniffing him—scenting him.
Potter cut him off again after another shallow thrust, the slap of skin lewd in their ears as dark eyes looked over to the other, one eyebrow raised in interest at the blond’s defiance that refused to waver.
thing to ever happen to me,” murmured Harry, hoping that the other knew he truly meant it, his voice soft and soothing. “I will never get bored of you—
scratches. Why were there— “I’m sure you have worse,” he added, smirking when the blond couldn’t find it in himself to speak.
“And who knew you were such a kinky
Draco’s breath hitched, his body going stiff. “This? What, you’ve wanted sex for a long time now or something?”
or something.”
Potter didn’t bother to reply as a growl escaped him, one that made him tremble as he delivered another brutal thrust. Draco couldn’t hear anything else as his soft sobs and hiccups shut out all the noise, stuck in a rhythm of delirious pain that he bathed in with each breathless moan.
Harry stayed quiet as he took his hand away from his, ignoring the warmth that left him to the writhing cold. He reached out to his pocket, tapping around until he felt a rich velvet—sheer anxiety crawled up his neck when he carefully took a box out, his hold unwavering for once.
Potter perked up an eyebrow. “Weren’t you gonna give me a lap dance?”
He teased the head, rubbing the aching underside of his cock, moaning softly.
He heard Potter lean in, whispering a praise in his ear that had Draco moaning softly. He only realised his legs were shaking when he felt his trousers fall to his knees, with something hard pressing in on his rim.
“You want to marry me?” Draco whispered, his eyes fixed on the silver ring that stood out in the dark—it was studded with a fair emerald that twinkled back at him, curved with tiny snakes that bore the whitest scales. It was—it was
Harry didn’t hear anything else that the warden had to say, only the low whisper of ‘fifteen minutes’ reaching him before the door slammed shut, the sickly screech of metal echoing behind him.
“I—I saw you
“Hey,” his boyfriend said, slightly breathless as he strolled into their bedroom without a mind. His hair was a tousled mess,
The blond only nodded, blinking wearily as he forced his lidded eyes open, letting out a short yawn before he mumbled under his breath, too near-silent, as if he wished that Harry couldn’t hear him. “You’re disappointed.”
“Draco?” Harry tried to say, wincing when it came out as a frail whisper instead. Maybe it was the desperation in his voice, the pleading look in his eyes, or the way his hands trembled—he didn’t know what he had done, but it was enough to have tired eyes blinking back up at him.
Potter’s smirk grew, his eyes twinkling as a chuckle echoed in his ears. “That’s all you have to say?"
“Shh, love,” the voice was soft and soothing. “I’m right here. It was just a nightmare.”
It was the soft, lilting way she spoke that made him stand up straighter—and the dangerous edge to her stare that was shielded behind a fake smile. He knew her type—Harry’s met people like her before. People who everyone steered clear of. People who no one dared to mess with.
He peered back up, biting his bottom lip.
“Hey, hey,” the voice whispered gently, “you saved me, remember?” hands cupped Draco’s face, careful and delicate. Harry. That was Harry holding him, murmuring comfort in his ears, letting him crumble in his arms. “You saved us and got us out of that pit.”
“Well?”
Draco found himself spluttering, the deceitful thing between his thighs twitching against the silk. “It is not—we’re completely—oh, shut it,” he scowled when Potter’s grin became wider, teeth flashing.
hear you say that.”
Potter looked flustered, all of his bravado and undying confidence earlier suddenly leaving his body. “I—no. Nothing.”
Harry shifted, drawing himself closer as he let out another quiet hum. “Left.”
“Knew you were aroused by this.” Potter went after his throat again, his sinful tongue licking and sucking on the pink marks that were lovely against the pale skin. Draco couldn’t help but to harshly bite on his bottom lip, trying not to let more embarrassing sounds from escaping.
Potter’s mouth went dry. “We … we never really talked, or—or discussed things, you know? I wanted to check on you, see how you’re doing, especially after the …”
Harry held out a panicked hand almost instantly as he nearly dropped the velvet box—but the blond just shook his head with a wince, waving him off. Draco twisted slightly to his left as his other hand fumbled around from behind, tapping a few times on the stained floor.
Wrong.
Oh, he was in for it. “I said, make me. Are you deaf?”
Potter’s thumb nudged at the blond’s bottom lip, just as the raven stared up at him with a bold, impatient look. When Draco refused to part his lips with a cocked eyebrow, the boldness not fitting in with the rest of his flushed state, Potter rolled his eyes at him before digging his fingers sharply against the blond’s thigh.
“Fuck, look at you, Draco,” Potter said in a low tone, resting a rough-palmed hand on the blond’s pale thigh, curling one finger underneath the lacy fish-net as he pulled, eliciting a breathless whine in the air.  “Lookin’ all cute and pretty when you cry.”
That tongue. That damn tongue.
“You know, that actually reminds me—” Potter glanced to him, eyes practically gleaming— “I probably should send her a thank-you gift later. It was her idea to make you lose that bet on purpose last night.”
Potter raised an eyebrow at him, still not averting his gaze. “Paperwork? You’d rather do that than the guy who you literally did it with last night?”
“You are the
And fuck, it was ecstasy and agony and perfect all at once. How Draco loses all sense of his own reality, his mind only focusing on the half-whispered pleas that slipped from his tongue; how Harry forgets what restraint was, letting his thirst for more take over his body completely.
“It’s for safety measures,” she informed him, turning on her heel. “As long as you follow my lead, then I’m sure we’ll—”
Potter smiled at him; it was so genuine—so real. “Not that. You. I’ve wanted you all this time, and I never realised it.”
“Ngh—” Draco’s eyes fluttered close, hating how his body jerked back into the touch as the raven prodded a sweet bundle of nerves inside him, breathless curses rolling out of his tongue. “Fuck, right
It was all she could offer.
Harry sees Draco for the first time in months.
He remembered every single moment—how Weaslette’s face lit up into a tearful smile, how they shared a tender kiss on the lips, and how Draco tried to down potion after potion of Dreamless Sleep the next day in hopes of thinking it was all just some delusional nightmare his mind had conjured.
His back arched off the wall, coming on the patterned walls with a sharp cry as he bucked his hips. Shiny white globs of his come stained the walls, his breath ragged as he tried to clear the pounding in his head. Draco’s eyes fluttered shut, muscled arms holding him up by the sides and pressing him against the wall.
Draco cracked a half-hearted smile. “It’s supposed to be a matching ring.” He slipped it on his finger, admiring his work fondly before catching the other’s bemused look. “Stop grinning, Potter, or I’ll shove this thing down your throat.”
Draco couldn’t help but jerk his hips against the ticklish feeling, eliciting a soft groan from Potter, only serving to make the blond tremble as his cock twitched against the tight fabric of his knickers. The smooth silk of his skirt wasn’t any help either, as every time it teasingly brushed over the inside of his thighs, a muffled moan would escape him.
He then realised it was a security measure, and not for a moment did Harry feel sympathy when he thundered out a menacing,
“It wasn’t
It was nice while it lasted.
A hand wrapped around his cock, fisting the red tip while the thumb teased his slit. Draco’s breath shook, unshed tears prickling at the corners of his eyes at the denial to come. He found himself begging, pleading in weak whispers, because he needed it so bad, he felt like he was going to die if he didn’t—
“I—okay.” Draco cursed himself for stuttering like a fool, letting his Slytherin instincts take over once more as he sneered delicately. “I’m sure you wouldn’t mind stepping away now, Potter? I must say, your body is quite something I’d like to stay away from.”
and—”
This time, Harry didn’t hesitate to practically stop whatever he was holding to walk over to the blond hurriedly. He ignored Draco’s complaints and weak attempts to swat him away as a hand was lifted to a milk-white neck, one that
“I’m so sorry,” Potter whispered. No, no—that wasn’t Potter. That was Harry. The Harry that gave him a chance, the Harry that whispered songs to him during nightmares, the Harry that made his heart flutter.
leaving a white-hot burn to settle in his stomach once more.
“Draco,” greeted Potter, and it was so utterly
“Can I kiss you?” The words had tumbled out of Harry’s mouth before he could think.
“For Merlin’s sake, just get it on already!”
“Yeah?” mused Draco, a platinum strand of hair falling on his eyes before he quickly brushed it away from sweaty skin. “Tell that to Pansy.”
“I definitely remember now,” his voice cracked as he spoke, breaking the soothing silence that hung in the air.
Draco nodded quickly, deciding to raise his arms to his mouth to try and quiet the embarrassing noises he was making. From the corner of his eye, he saw Potter drop down to his knees behind him, right before his hand sneaked inside Draco’s shirt and stroked his cock. “What—” he swallowed quickly, “what are you—oh, fuck!”
His nostrils flared as the warden fixed a challenging look on him. Hermione’s hold on his arm was firm, and when her nails dug sharply enough to hurt, he backed down. He muttered out a quiet apology that laid sour on his tongue.
Potter raised an eyebrow at him, but it wasn’t in the mocking type of way that usually made Draco's irritation flare up. If anything, it looked more . . . teasing. Amused, to put it in better words.
And before he knew it, he was already speaking in pathetic little stutters, his voice strained as he did so.
“How awfully romantic.”
Draco gasped loudly, and nothing could have prepared him to what Potter did next. The raven pressed his nose to the side of Draco’s face and shoved his tongue inside, mercilessly tongue-fucking his ear.
“What?” Potter laughed, that sly grin on his face growing wider at the other’s flustered look. “You’re dressed for the occasion, anyway, with that little outfit of yours.”
Potter’s face cracked into a tired grin. Draco wanted to see more of that.
Draco’s slicked lips parted, the half-hearted sneer on his face vanishing away into a wordless silence. It only made Potter grin wider at the blond’s weak attempts of defiance as he slipped two fingers in this time, noting the tiny shiver and the shaky suck of breath that he received.
The look on Potter’s face practically turned feral. “What, you’re gonna tell me that they were wrong?”
He swallowed the knot on his throat, mumbling in a faint whisper, “and we both know how much you
Potter’s breath hitched, his eyes glistening. “I didn’t know you were going to be there, love, I just—”
he felt, filling him to the brim.
The blond wanted to curse from the euphoric pain that throbbed between his legs, begging for release, but all that escaped him was a high, desperate whine.
Harry smiled in the dark—a wild, wicked thing. “He died a long time ago.”
like it at all
He nodded.
And the warden must’ve known it too from the look on his face, because Harry was greeted with a roll of her eyes. “If you can’t make it through the appetizer, Mr. Potter, then you’ll never survive the main course.”
“It takes little to know that you’re upset, Potter.”
“They don’t.”
“There it is,” said Harry softly, silently reveling in how his boyfriend tried to close his legs, as if it would do anything to stop him from rubbing the little, warm nub buried inside. He groaned, twisting his fingers around the tight ring of muscle, making Draco whimper.
“the guards here tend to be quite intimidating, I must admit. To whom did you request a visit with, Mr. Potter?”
“Potter, what
His gaze finally slipped to the other’s dark ones, and his breath hitched.
"Bloody NEWTs," he muttered, hiding his face in his hands before peeking at his notes. Draco's handwriting has always been known to be elegant and neat, but as time slowly ticked by, it was almost ridiculous to think that he was the one who had actually written it. His letters had become messier, and the words began getting harder and harder to read. Ridiculous.
you know? That rush
Draco frantically looked away, trying to think of disturbing images in his head to get rid of the rapid bloom on his face, but it was too late—Pansy had already seen it, her lips pulling into a derisive simper. “You sure are one kinky man, Draco Malfoy. Do you want me to help you find the guy who gave those to you, too?”
Draco shivered, writhing on the cock that twitched in him as he breathed out a moan. He wondered what he must’ve looked to the other at the moment—with silver, tangled hair that was firmly tugged at by a harsh hand; with flushed cheeks that were coloured pink, all the way to the tips of his ears; with a mouth that parted slightly as the bottom lip redder than the rest; and to finish all that, a maid outfit that no longer was as pretty as it had been, with silken lace sprawled messily over his lap, wrinkled and soiled with thin trails of saliva.
He wasn’t looking, but he could’ve sworn he caught a bare glimpse of Harry’s emerald eyes softening. “Draco.”
Potter shrugged in nonchalance, not at all bothered when he spoke once more, eyes glinting with a hint of wicked intent. “Can you blame me for enjoying the humiliation in seeing you all…” he tilted his head to the side, a bit too innocent for either of their sakes. “…dolled up?”
hot against his skin.
Harry slammed inside him with no warning, eliciting a scream from the blond. Draco broke off with a cry, arching his back helplessly as veiled tears stung in the corner of his eyes. He tugged at his bound, aching arms, only to have Harry hold him firmer in place—all Draco could do was whimper and moan when a rough, brutal pace started tearing him apart.
“You could’ve told me,” whispered Draco, his voice cracking. He didn’t have it in him to shout, to scream, to fight back—not when all that he’s held on to were shattering at his feet. “Why didn’t you?”
beneath him, the fingers that worked around his waist and tugged at the black silk, the hot breath that warmed over the sensitive skin just under his ear, and—
“But when?”
So, when knocks rapped against their door, Hermione forced herself to be still while cold-faced aurors marched in with no mind. Their wands were tucked away, but she knew too well that they were armed to the teeth. Their stances might’ve been up and proper, but she could still note how their narrowed eyes assessed her home.
“Open your eyes and look at me, love,” that same voice implored, and Draco did. His eyes fluttered open, shaken and petrified.
A blank, white noise filled his ears, and it was all that Draco could hear as his tired body went slack as he felt a calloused hand on his cock pull away, along with two arms that lifted his hips just slightly for Potter to pull out. A quiet whimper left the blond from over-sensitivity, his thighs shaking in discomfort as he heard the whisper of a cooling charm, then the feel of a cold wind that tickled at his skin.
All breath must’ve left him then because all so suddenly, Draco couldn’t find it in himself to
Harry looked at him, huffing for air as well. He stared at Draco, a hint of a satisfied smirk on his lips at how unkempt he’d easily made the Slytherin. “Either I fuck you in a nice, comfy bed like a proper gentleman—” Draco trembled, unconsciously closing his legs, only for Harry’s knee to knead deeper into his bulge, making him whimper. “—or I do it here, on your desk, naked and bent over for me.”
Harry slowly exhaled through his nose, then back in. He nodded weakly. “Okay. I can do that.”
Draco looked at him again, fire gleaming in his eyes. “No.” He already knew what Harry wanted to ask of him, but not for one second will he ever do it.
Draco let out a small, strangled noise as Potter thrusted back into him, hitting his over-sensitive prostate once more, but the tides of pleasure were washed over by the sharp pain that the raven’s mouth left on his bruised throat. Angry, near-purple marks bloomed on his skin as his breath caught, a yell slipping past every time the fingers on his hips dug deeper.
“You’re really good at remembering things, right?”
He couldn’t help but let out a tired sigh, his eyes blinking faintly as the room twirled on its own. He dreaded every minute that ticked by, the dust-ridden lamps that the guards always seemed to carry, the eerie silence that pounded in his ears too loudly—
“You—you cheating
Harry snorted softly at her, his lips curling into a bitter smile. “I would’ve thought that bit was rather obvious.”
Draco’s eyes fluttered shut, his flushed cheeks pressed against the table as he felt something hard nestle between his arse. “Wait, I . . .” his voice cracked when he felt Harry tower over him, leaving a path of harsh, sloppy kisses on the nape of his neck. “the—the locking charms.”
The blond sighed, his eyes fluttering shut as he pinched the bridge of his nose. He ignored the uncomfortable itch that bloomed in his skin whenever the fabric brushed against his thighs, and the sudden heat that washed over his flushed face.
why didn’t Harry notice this sooner?
just made a fucking mess, and you expect me to clean it up by
Draco’s toes curled, the deep, soft voice going straight to his swelling cock. “I . . .”
bad, I just—“
The aurors had barely spared a moment to throw her a doubtful look before nodding curtly, their steps soon fading away into nothing but harsh, ringing silence.
Hermione only hummed in disapproval. He thought she looked rather composed, despite waiting on the doors of hell to welcome them in—her mouth was drawn to a thin line, and her eyes were narrowed as they darted from place to place.
Draco inhaled sharply, almost forgetting the other boy was still there. “Can’t I have a little privacy?”
A hand patiently tugged at Draco’s arm, but he didn’t move a single muscle. “Tired,” the blond murmured quietly, finding way too much comfort for his own liking in the crook of Potter’s neck. “Wanna stay with you.”
“What?” he asked, subtly casting a wordless Cooling charm that sent a pleasant cold to dance on their skins.
Potter didn’t reply—he only hummed in satisfaction as he circled the blond’s rosy rim from behind, and without warning, shoved two fingers in with a filthy, wet sound.
tell me you at least remember a few things from last night.”
Draco’s eyes fluttered shut, savouring the pain Harry left with his teeth—then the pleasure from the warm tongue that soothed it. “Harry . . .”
seriously,” said Draco slowly, rubbing at his eyes with his bone-white knuckles in blatant frustration as his words came out drowsy and mumbled. “You don’t need to—” he paused for a second, wincing at his scratchy throat— “stay home for me.”
Draco fiddled with his quill for what seemed to be the umpteenth time. After hours of frustrated muttering and resorting of folders that Weasley had ever-so-ruined, he became restless. Even as Potter came back with a nervous smile, neither of them exchanged a word with the other.
From the other room, he heard a doorknob click open, a black figure dashing about and swinging the door close. Draco shut his eyes, pinching his nose, waiting for the strides of expensive, high heels to come closer, and closer, then—
was what Potter meant. The day he left the blond lost and confused, the day he offered to take another woman’s hand with a beautiful, jeweled ring.
“Shh, let me take care of you,” Harry murmured gently, his breath hot against his skin.
“Draco,” he scolded softly, not hesitating to tap lightly at the shivering skin before he pulled them back apart with one hand. “Keep them open or I’m stopping.”
“I promise,” whispered Harry, and somehow, Draco knew it was enough.
No one else.”
Apparently, that was enough for Harry to freeze and think of his options wisely (which he didn’t, but it wasn’t like he cared) before he took off his Auror coat, threw it over a chair, and decided that he will be—in fact—
“Do you really think I don’t know that you love this?” Potter inched two fingers on the blond’s bottom lip, urging his pretty mouth open. “Come on, Draco, you never liked being vanilla—you just always loved the fucking pain with the pleasure, hm?” the blond gagged a little, drool spilling past his lips when Potter took on a steady pace to fuck his mouth.
It was so dirty, so wrong—but it felt so good.
“Yeah, just like that,” Potter murmured against his ear, the praise low and rumbling from his chest. “Get off on my lap like a little
Harry’s breath stuck in his throat as a horrible white noise filled his ears. He didn’t know when he stopped walking, but he did.
leave him, not like that—he
“Whatever you say, Draco—
But this—this was
Then; a raspy laugh. “No.”
“Be gentle, will you?” Draco hissed, even as a traitorous part of his body twitched achingly when Potter’s hand drew so close to his cock, leaving ghost touches at its wake.
“Are you
“No,” said Hermione confidently, raising her chin. “I don’t.”
Maybe if Draco had been paying the smallest bits of attention to what’s happening around him rather than burning a hole through his papers with a fierce glare, he would’ve had the time to process the way a hand snuck its way to his forearm, and another spinning his chair to firmly hold him in place.
Draco let out strings of moans, knowing he was flushing red, and even more so when he felt a hand steadily tug down his pants, revealing a swelling cock that pressed against his stomach.
But when Draco swiftly swiveled around to walk out the shower stalls entirely, a calloused hand tugged him back with defiance.
“What did you say?”
Draco couldn’t help but chuckle at Weasley’s slowly reddening face, but just like Potter, the Gryffindor gathered his wits just as quickly.
Potter let out a low chuckle that sent chills underneath his skin, an abrupt blush warming over the Draco’s cheeks, embarrassed at the utterly
Draco slipped a pearl-trimmed comb through his blond locks, staring at his own reflection through the mirror with a disdainful sniff. A thick blanket wrapped around his waist, one side dangerously dipping down to his hips. He’d always fancied hot, warm baths—it was something he looked forward to after going through hours and hours of tiring paperwork.
His hand gripped over the frail edge desperately, trying to lift his weak body up. But he couldn’t, not when as seconds slowly ticked by, more of his crimson blood ran down his stomach. Not when he still had so much to live for, and someone finally worth being happy with. Not when …
Draco had always said his name fondly in a tone of endearment, or whenever he’d come across his lover doing something rather stupid and dunce-like. But now, the name flowed from his mouth like a curse, like it brought a painful ache to the chest every time he said it. “Don’t you dare call me
Just the way he liked it.
A scarlet blush crept up on his face as he forced his gaze to wander elsewhere, refusing to look down as his mouth went dry.
There was a muffled laugh from below him, and he realised it was the raven—chuckling at his stubborn impatience.
he thought bitterly.
he made an obscene gesture with his hands, making Harry raise his eyebrows suggestively. "—to do me in my bed over there, I still have books to study and a dreadful exam to pass tomorrow."
The warden looked at him. “These people we deal with are not meant to be treated like real human beings, Potter—” there it was; the malice
Then he felt Potter roam his body once more; his chest, his nipples, then his neck. Draco’s cheeks heated, knowing all too well that his neck was abused by one too many love bites. There was a pool of pleasure that swirled in his stomach at the thought of keeping the hickeys instead of spelling them away as Draco would have done with other sexual encounters—but the thought itself of driving the Gryffindor mad by flaunting them around was enough motivation for him to do so.
This wasn’t real. None of it was—this must be some cruel joke that the gods have played on him.
his words were hoarse, and every staggering breath felt like a stab to his heart. Draco found himself standing up abruptly, making his head spin with a sinful rage. “I would have understood, instead you made me watch you propose to her like an idiot, you—” a sob clawed at his throat. “—you fucking
Draco’s cheeks held a pink tint to it, but he ignored it as he cuddled closer, hiding his flushed face from sight as best as he could. “You’re an awful sap.”
was expected, but—why was
Draco stilled, staring at him, and it took Harry a while to realise that he was trying to figure out what to say next. He remembered loving the blond for it—always having some snarky response in check, or a flippant joke to slice through thick silence. But this…
Potter hummed pleasantly, raising a hand to the collar of his turtleneck and inching a finger in. Draco stared, hazily entranced at the slow reveal of bare skin, until a tiny yelp of surprise escaped him when he finally realised what Potter was doing.
“Don’t,” Harry warned him, trailing his saliva-coated fingertips over his furled hole. Without warning, Draco cried out as his hands were suddenly pulled above his head, bound together with a Slytherin tie knotted around both his delicate wrists.
Draco shakily exhaled, his shoulders trembling a bit against his thin frame. A pained cough spilled out of him, and soon with it, came a raspy whisper.
Potter stopped abruptly, his hand on the Slytherin’s stomach reaching up to caress him gently. Softly. Almost like he actually cared. “Too rough?”
He always hated random tapping or twitching knees—the sound always made Draco’s nostrils flare in annoyance because it distracted him from his work. But with Potter doing it, the noise sounded like it was amplified by a
Harry pulled him in for another brutal kiss, the force hard enough that Draco stumbled forwards, shamelessly rutting his own clothed bulge against his. A soft whine slipped from his throat once he felt a hand wantonly travel down the small of his back, then to the hem of his trousers teasingly.
Harry shoved down the bitter taste of bile in his mouth, his face painted with unmistakable horror.
“Really funny,” Potter snorted, shifting uneasily on his feet. It was in no way subtle, and they both knew that, but he covered it up quickly with a smug smirk. “What’s even funnier is that I can still recall you being the first one to pass out during the party, Ron.” He paused, pretending to think. “I think ‘Mione had to drag you home herself.”
“Let them hear you.”
Draco couldn’t speak, even if he tried to. He couldn’t hear any of the dirty nothings Potter was whispering in his ear filthily—he couldn’t even hear himself moan like some whore in a club. All he could focus on was that velvet-wrapped steel pounding into him, hitting his sweet spot every single time, eliciting a moan along with whispered pleas to echo from his throat.
“Friends—we’re friends,” said Potter tightly, a strain evident in his voice. “You’re my friend.”
you after all these—”
Potter raised his hands to his head. “All right, all right, I’m kidding! See, no wands here.” He showed his palms outwardly to Draco, showing that he was indeed unarmed. “Forgive a guy for celebrating over the fact that his dick is bigger than his rival’s.”
being bored.”
“I don’t care if they walk in and see you like this,” Potter cut him off shortly, leaning back to angle Draco’s head—to meet him in the eyes whose sea of greens were nowhere to be found, swallowed by clouded lust that stared back. A look of bemusement adorned his face when Draco looked away, flustered. “I thought you’d know by now that the only thing I care about is…”
“So, that means—” Potter awkwardly scratched the nape of his neck— “you remember who, er…”
“Oh,” Draco breathed out, a little of his old flame bursting to life as the Auror unclasped his belt buckle, tossing it to the floor. “Taking what’s yours since what, last night?”
The only clues of who might’ve been daring enough to bring him home was that they must’ve really known Draco rather well; it wasn’t often that people knew where he lived, aside from the Manor. But there was also something else, something that veiled a significant memory, somewhere in the back of his mind…
That was why when Harry was just about to leave for work after he kissed the other’s forehead, confusion settled on his face as his ears picked up a broken whine.
Draco fought the urge to lift his hand up to his throat and soothingly rub the ache that bloomed on his skin. “Yes,” he said tightly. “What do you want?”
Draco sucked in a breath, his lips curling to argue, but he knew better this time and shoved his pride
“Can you speak now?” Harry asked softly, making sure to keep his hands away, no matter how much he wanted to touch him. Hold him. Wrap him with warmth.
"Mother, I haven't told Harry about this. I am not sure he will agree and I haven't prepared everything." Draco said in slightly panic tone.
"Cissa, Draco you should get your rest. Tomorrow we will do Blood Ritual, cleasing the manor impurities. We could start after breakfast. We've lost too many bloods today. I need to regain my magic as well. That's all gentlemen. Good night." Lucius ended his speech and retired to his room.
Everyone laughed at this. Severus blushed hard. James loved to tease him about his stubbornness. They continued to read it.
Lucius and Narcissa took the parchment from Draco, they read it with frown face. They couldn't believe what they saw. How could someone as delicate as Harry being treated like that? How could they who called themselves light wizard who always talked about justice and equal treatment of all kind of wizard did something cruel, evil, unacceptable. How could they didn't notice anything about Severus. They've been known him since at Hogwarts. Maybe Severus been obliviated and forget about James. The anger was oblivious. They were ready to crucioed them.
He was half drunk in Draco's fragrant scents
"Oh yes, Minerva had a theory about why we couldn't find Dumbledore painting in her office after his death. Every headmaster or headmistress will automatically have a painting when they passed away." Remus moved his hand from Severus and now rubbed his neck sheepishly.
"Good night Mr. Malfoy, Cissa, Professor."
"I know. I know. It hurts so much when I knew the truth but it's too late. I determined to tell the world the truth about Dumbledore. But I still need more evidence. Lucius and I have few theories and I need your help for that." Severus talked quietly. He still felt hurt whenever he remembered James. He sighed few times to ease his pain.
"Nice idea son. What about if Harry was blood adopted by Severus before his second gender revealed. Since you two have a good relationship for two years it's normal for Severus to blood adopt you. And when your gender revealed Draco asked Severus to court you and now you're mate. How about that?" Piped Cissa.
The ceremony run smoothly and sacred. The vows was beautiful. The audiences felt so touched by them.
They spent their day with testing some spell and charms. Remus and Severus will be stayed in Hogwarts for few days. Leaving Lucius alone in the Manor since Narcissa and the kids still had holiday in France.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I know it's hard and painful. I know it's not easy. I can understand. Maybe I never been in your shoes but I had similar experiences with bullying and abused. I know how hurt it was. I know how hard to speak up. I don't know your feelings but I know mine. " then he added "talk to me when you're ready. I hope you can be more open to me and lean on me and learn to trust me." Harry cried in his mother hugs.
"It's okay Moony. It's okay. I didn't blame you. I was hurt yes but I am okay. Thank you for taking care of me  and thanks for loving me. You are a good godfather Moony." Harry reached Remus's shoulder and patted  it.
“I swear to God. What is wrong with them both? Ginny and Ron, I mean. They act like two biggest brats. They always had a big ego, but that is beyond anything,” Hermione whispered, heatedly.
He didn’t say anything, so she left, closing the curtains around his bed. He wasn’t sure he felt so lost and scared in his whole life. If felt like some sort of crazy dream that borderlined on a nightmare. In spin of what felt like moments he lost his friends, the love of his life turned out to be a liar, and now, on top of that, he learned he was having a baby with the said love of his life.
“Um. Yes. I wanted to know … how are you? Have you been to that clinic?”
“It is alright, I suppose. I don’t know … it’s sex. I don’t know what else I can say.”
“Zabinis are coming over. I wasn’t supposed to tell you, but looking at how … emotional you are these days, it is better for you to be prepared.”
“My room,” Harry said, simply.
Coffee was his new addiction. He had no idea how came that he never tried it before. It was always there at the breakfast table, but only recently he discovered the delicious taste. Though he had to switch to the decaf one, which was a boomer, he wasn’t going to go against the healer’s word.
“Thank you. It’s the most amazing gift I’ve ever got. And I’m not lying. I love drawing, I never tried painting but it always seemed fun. And I couldn’t get it for myself, because my father didn’t think it’s a thing for men to do, and even though you would think I have money to spend as I please, I don’t. I need to pay for everything in check so every receipt goes to Gringotts so father knows what I spent every Knut on.”
“It’s a-alright.”
Well, it was sort of sneakier than doing it out in the open field like him and Harry did, less than an hour ago.
Oh, did you think you would get 'and there was only one bed' trope just because your Author was missleading you since the beginning? Sorry to dissapoint but not yet! I hope you enjoyed this chapter and Draco's stutter situation didn't get out of hand like in my eyes. I just wanted to hint it here and there in presence of other people or when he gets nervous but not nearly as bad as in other chapters.
Salem got up from his spot on the bed, meowing loudly as he could already sense his distress. Draco didn’t want to lose much time on crying and worrying, instead of trying to figure something out.
“Can I ask you something?” Draco whispered.
"Mm. Sure. Why?" he said, distracted from his thoughts.
The Prefect Bathroom was thick with lavender-smelling steam coming from the purple water. Draco was enjoying the soothing effect it had on his aching bones, even though he didn’t have as much rest as he wanted to have. He was going through the notes Hermione gave him, checking if it matched up with his. He was very tired, and as he loved to at least have a bath without worrying about school work or anything else, he couldn’t let it happen anymore. NEWTs were coming faster than he would want them to, and he felt as if he was utterly unprepared, so he was spending every spare moment on learning.
“I knew it. You have this glow on your face. Oh, you poor darling. I can’t imagine what you are going through. So young and all alone. I had my first when I was only eighteen, and the second one soon after that. Ahh, my precious children. They don’t come to visit as often since my dear David passed away. They are busy, you see. One is a doctor in New York, and my daughter has three children herself, so they are always busy…”
“Yes. And they were still there. They run away into the woods and I needed to get you back to school instead of chasing them. It wasn’t hard to know who it was. I checked my memory few times and I knew all the faces. Carrow, two other Slytherins and one Gryffindor. I told Headmistress that I didn’t know who did it, that they were already gone once I found you. She didn’t believe me, obviously, but let me have a free hand. I think she also knew how it would end if she went on to reprimand them. So … I took care of it. Which wasn’t easy, because suddenly all of them were missing classes or disappearing before I got chance to get them. But then Salem came in handy. I don’t know how he knew but he managed to get Carrow out of the Dungeons. I don’t know how he did it, but that prick was running out of there as if he saw some monster. Anyway … you have nothing to worry about. I promise you. They won’t lay hand on you and I made sure they spread the word around that it is high time to leave you alone.”
“Are you really alright?” Harry asked.
He settled on making treacle tart as a dessert and roast for the main course. He was perfectly aware that it was Harry’s favorite food. Just as he was aware of what brand of Butterbeer was his favorite. And that he liked it cold, fresh out of the fridge. And he put extra effort so the man would get it. Which was utterly stupid.
“I do too. But now you should go. It’s already past four.”
“Don’t. Are you tired? I would like to take you somewhere.”
“Can you believe that only three more months and school will be over? We won’t come back here. Ever,” Harry said. He got apparently too bored by the book.
She just nodded, without further comment.

“Isn’t it lovely? Interhouse unity. Slytherins and Gryffindor,” he said.
Draco couldn’t help but crack up and start laughing. But then it hit him – did Blaise said lunch
TMI of today is that every time I post, I realize how bad my grammar is. I use Grammarly because if you saw how it looks without the corrections, I am sure no one would be here. Though I still need to get premium because my punctuation is all around the place. School failed me in this field, not going to lie. But I guess there comes a message here too. I get super frustrated because of this, and there are times that I don't want to write because I know how bad my grammar is. But I am always trying to come to terms with it and focus on the fun that writing brings me, and why it is important for me to write, not about little dots and all. And I think it goes like that for everything. So, don't let anything bring you back from doing what you love, darlings!
“But … isn’t it like, forbidden?” he whispered.
He was sipping on his tea, trying to suppress both the headache and unpleasant news when the shrinking sound of the wards came. Aunt A quickly scrambled to her legs to go see who it was.
“It’s okay, Draco. It’s just me. I am not going to judge you, or anything. So there is no need to be so nervous. I am your friend, not a threat.”
Harry waited until he got back to bed, Salem getting back into his spot between the pillows. Once he was settled, Harry gave him another adorable smile.
“Draco,” Harry started, looking at him carefully. “I’m …. I’m sorry how things have turned out. I really want to … us … crap. All I’m trying to say is…”
“I will tell you a story, okay? Don’t take it as a pity party, or anything, and maybe just listen and don’t say anything, if you feel like you might want to say you are sorry, or whatever. I … there was a time, a long time ago, when I didn’t know who I am, didn’t know about magic, anything. And it was time when I was really … sad, very lost. Life wasn’t really the greatest. The people … Muggles I lived with were horrible people. This years, when I was sleeping in the cupboard under the stairs, and even when I attended Hogwarts and knew I had a godfather and slept in a normal room, that was once my cousin’s toy room, because in that life, toys, things, were more important than me, a stupid, good for nothing kid. I … I was always thinking about the future. About doing things I could do to escape there, thinking what job I could land to get money and get the hell out of it. Then with Dumbledore and stuff, when I still had to come back to the Dursleys, I was so angry and lonely, wondering what am I doing wrong that I need to be back there. It didn’t even get easier once I knew I had money. I … fuck, this is really a pity party, I’m going nowhere with it … Ugh … What I mean is that I thought that I was good for nothing, thinking that my faith was already settled. Firstly the faith those Muggles chose for me, as I thought at the time, and then what Dumbledore had planned with me sacrificing myself, guiding my life as he pleased, and all … And it took a long time before I understood that I’m master of my faith, that it wasn’t laid for me. I never had to listen to Dumbledore and anyone else, I never had to listen to prophecies, I could have done whatever I wanted, no matter where it led me or anyone else. But I always let others control my life anyway they wanted. Maybe it’s fine when you are a child, but once you are old enough to make your own decisions it’s good thing to try an fight for yourself, have your own dreams and be your own person. It may be hard, you may fail and all, but there is always day after night.”
“Right, sorry. It was a movie reference.
“No,” he said, quickly. “No, I’m fine. I … I don’t want to fall asleep.”
it will be fun. It’s so warm outside still, we need to enjoy this long summer. I will organize food, and we will take a lots of blankets, and maybe few pillows. We will invite the rest too. It will be lovely, I promise.”
“What Harry wanted?” Hermione asked.
“Then we could still get married.”
He shook his head, eyes fixed full of tears fixed on the floor. “N-No. I want to… to be alone. I’m sorry.”
“I’m pregnant.”
“That’s a very nice scarf you got,” Harry said, after he spoke the password and they stepped into the staircase.
“Blaise Zabini. I refused and … we argued. I left and came here. Aunt A was nice enough to let me stay.”
“Let’s go. I will walk you to the Dungeons, I have somewhere to go anyway.”
He reread the letter few more times, smile on his face. He missed Blaise as they haven’t seen each other in a long time. Which he understood. Blaise was tending family business now and he was constantly busy. So, the fact that he was going out of his way to meet him was heartwarming and he wouldn’t miss it for anything.
