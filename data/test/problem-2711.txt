“Why not?” he asked sharply. Minerva flinched. Even though he was only a painting now, a shadow of the former man, he was still quite an intimidating figure.
Draco scoffed, “Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries that thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw!”
Draco drew her a bemused expression, unsure of how to respond to that. Harry, on the other hand, knew that it was better just to humour her. “Okay, let me think...was it a Crumple-Horned Snorkack?”
“...And all my fortunes at thy foot I’ll lay and follow thee my lord throughout the world,” said Hermione in a soft, lyrical voice.
“And you aren’t?” Harry replied. Draco shrugged.
After a few rounds of card games, Draco got bored and wandered off to hang out with Theo and the other Slytherins further down the train. Neville and Harry spent the remainder of the journey talking about their plans for after they graduated. Well, Neville talked while Harry listened for the most part since he didn’t have any jobs lined up after graduation. Not that he hadn’t received plenty of offers—he’d received letters from prospective employers as far afield as South America and Antarctica, offering him work that seemed to consist primarily of hunting down dark wizards. Kingsley was particularly keen to get Harry started at the Auror Academy as soon as possible. But while Harry wasn’t entirely opposed to the idea, there was still something holding him back...
and the door swung open, revealing a large pile of old, battered broomsticks. Harry sifted through the pile and pulled out what looked like the newest broomstick from the pile—a Cleansweep Eleven. Slinging the broomstick over his shoulder, Harry made his way inside the stadium, taking care as he climbed over broken beams and rubble until he was on the edge of the pitch. After two years of neglect, the grass had grown past Harry’s knees, but an unkempt pitch was the least of the stadium’s problems: a large portion of the stands had collapsed and four of the six goalposts had fallen over and were hidden beneath the tall grass. Harry looked around the once glorious stadium which was now in ruins, fondly remembering the cheers from the crowd and boos from the Slytherins, the cries and shouts, the roar of Luna’s lion hat. Some of his happiest times at Hogwarts had been spent on this pitch. What he wouldn’t give to play here one more time, to hear the crowd cheer and chant his name…
Ron plopped the leafy garland on his head and sighed as his miserable reflection stared back at him in the mirror.
“Very well, Liv. As I remember correctly, you graduated in nineteen seventy-four with five N.E.W.T.S. including an Outstanding in Muggle Studies—”
“No, he probably wants to be left alone,” said Harry, knowing from his own experience that he preferred to grieve in private. Having people chase after him when he was upset only made him feel worse. Dennis was one of many people who had suffered great personal loss during the war: his brother, Colin, had been killed during the Battle of Hogwarts. Harry couldn’t help but feel somewhat responsible for what had happened to Colin because he had always been an avid fan of Harry’s and Harry wondered if that had been a contributing factor in his decision to sneak back into Hogwarts to join the fight. Evidently, Dennis held Harry somewhat responsible for his brother’s untimely death as well. “Maybe I should leave. I can find somewhere else to sit…”
“Goodnight, Potter,” he said shortly.
“Now you’re starting to sound like a Slytherin,” she retorted. Ron gasped, looking affronted.
“No, and I don’t expect to either,” said Draco bitterly.
Draco sounded ashamed at his admission, but Harry cupped him by the cheeks and forced Draco to meet his gaze. “Well, I’m glad that you did.”
“I do,” said Hermione enthusiastically. “I mean, Shakespeare wrote the part to be played by a man, so I think it would be interesting to keep it that way but in a more literal sense.” She looked expectantly between the two boys. “So...what do you think?”
,” came the familiar, staticky voice of Lee Jordan from the radio. “The next password will be 'Meadowes'. Keep each other safe. Keep faith. Good night."
“Exactly.”
“Look, I don’t know what’s going to happen between me and Draco. And I know what you’re thinking—that this thing between us is doomed to fail—and you’re probably right. But right now, I’m happy,” he implored before adding sincerely, “I really am. Isn’t that enough for now?”
Seeing the despondent expression on Draco’s face, Mrs Weasley pulled him into a tight hug. Draco looked taken aback by the gesture but he tentatively returned the embrace. When she pulled away from Draco, she noticed that he was still wearing the jumper that she had knitted him.
“Miss, do we need to do this?” he asked.
“Thank you,” she mumbled, brushing away the tears from her eyes. “I just don't know how to bring unity to the four houses when we are so divided amongst ourselves.”
“This should do the trick, but I’m no Healer. You might be better letting Madam Pomfrey take a look at it,” she said, tying the loose ends of the gauze into a neat bow. Liv experimentally flexed her fingers and wrist. It was still sore but not so bad that she couldn’t hold a wand.
“You’re not telling me something,” said Harry quietly. Draco pursed his lips, which all but confirmed Harry’s suspicious. “Malfoy…”
“Why do you wear that thing all of the time?” Draco asked curiously.
“I—no,” Draco stammered. This wasn’t the direction he thought that this conversation would go and he felt ill-prepared to answer. “Obviously I can think for myself!”
“Professor,” he called, his voice pitched higher than normal. “I think I need your help.”
“O, then, dear saint, let lips do what palms do,” Harry and Draco pressed their palms together. Harry was aware of how sweaty his palm was against Draco’s, whose skin felt warm and smooth against his own. Harry laced their fingers together and said a little hoarsely, “They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.”
Anger flashed across her face when he said that.
Draco pulled a face. “A
“It does, doesn’t it?” he preened, strutting past an increasingly furious Ron to where Harry’s changing room was. “Potter, what do you think?”
While Hermione chattered away about her ‘promotion’, Draco (and by the looks of it everyone else) quickly tuned out. Just as he was beginning to regret coming over here, he felt Harry’s hand brush against his own. He cast a furtive glance at Harry, whose attention was focused on his plate as he finished his breakfast, toast held in his right hand while his left one tentatively reached for Draco’s under the table. Draco’s heart thudded so hard in his chest he was surprised that nobody else could hear it. Slowly, Draco intertwined their fingers and Harry gave his hand a slight squeeze in response. If anyone walked past the Gryffindor table right then, they would see the two of them unmistakably holding hands, but all he could focus on was how warm and smooth Harry’s hand felt against his own. Okay, so secretly holding hands might not constitute a public display of affection in Myrtle’s book, but they were taking baby steps.
“And more importantly than any of that, I want to do something good,” she continued. “For once in my life, I want to be a positive influence, to use my knowledge and experience to help others, and this job provides me with the perfect opportunity to do that.”
“Mate, I agree with everything you say and then some,” he’d said carefully. “But do we need to talk about it while we’re playing chess? It’s putting me off my game.”
“Well, that’s unfortunate. But it could have been worse.”
get hard kissing me, I’m going to take it as a compliment.”
“You’re going to get us caught,” Draco quietly chastised, although he made no attempt to stop his ministrations.
“Thanks, that’s sort of why I picked it,” he laughed. Professor McGonagall gave him a sad smile at those words.
Liv’s ears pricked up when she heard that. “Really? I find that hard to believe.”
“I like your costume too, Ron,” said Luna. “Who are you dressed as? Oh! Is it the Tooth Fairy?”
“Are you alright, Harry dear?” she asked, brushing his messy hair out of his face and giving him a thorough once-over.
“Why didn’t I think of that?” said Hermione irritably, stuffing her script into her school bag as they marched down the corridor towards the Great Hall. “If she let you do two auditions, do you think she’d let me do another one, too? I’m not sure I performed my best.”
“What’s more likely is that you were looking for me because you knew that we’d be together,” said Ginny accusingly.
“I find that hard to believe. You don’t have Quidditch this year to make sure that you’re the centre of attention, but you’ve got this play to fall back on. I take that you want to play Romeo?”
Liv cocked an eyebrow. “You’d rather play Miss Parkinson’s role because you have the same name as him?”
Harry sat in one of the sagging armchairs by the fire with Asha snoozing on his lap. The Gryffindor common room was in semi-darkness; the flames of the dying fire were the only source of light, emitting a soft, orange glow on the threadbare rug beneath Harry’s feet and warming his legs. He stroked Asha absent-mindedly as he stared into the flames, envious that his mischievous mustelid could sleep so contentedly; given the dramatic turn of events earlier that evening, she would be the only one sleeping soundly tonight.
“Yes, Potter, we’ve gathered as much already,” Snape cut in impatiently. “Do try to keep up.”
“Oof!”
“Sorry to frighten you, Harry. I did shout your name a couple of times but you didn’t hear me,” she simpered. “Did you almost fall off your broomstick?”
“I’ve read the whole thing.” Draco frowned at him. “Haven’t you?”
He inspected his heavily bandaged hands and tried to clench them into a fist but found that it was difficult to even wiggle his fingers. His movements were restricted but at least he wasn’t in pain anymore. He moved to slide off of the hospital bed but Madam Pomfrey gently pushed his shoulders back.
“How is your father getting on these days?” he inquired. “Nobody has seen him in public since his trial. Not since he bought his freedom and scurried back under his rock at Malfoy Manor.”
Professor McGonagall considered Harry in silent consideration for a few moments before speaking again. “Three years ago, you co-founded and led an organisation called Dumbledore’s Army. Correct?”
Ron frowned. “Who?”
“I think I’ve finally cracked it,” said Harry with more certainty than Draco felt was warranted. “This time I want you to give me everything you’ve got.”
“Not an entirely unfounded one,” Minerva pointed out darkly. Albus gave her a sharp look.
“What do you think so far?” Harry asked.
It surprised Draco how relieved he was that Myrtle was speaking to him again—not that he’d ever admit that, of course. He had, however, banked on her curiosity overruling how angry she was with him; evidently, he was right. “Well, I’m not heading straight home. I’m going to Muggle London for a few days first.”
“They have no idea what I’m feeling,” Dennis mumbled. “But I suppose
“It was her cats, wasn’t it?” he grinned. “She never shuts up about them. She’s like my great-aunt Tessie; she’s a mad cat lady, too.” Despite her best efforts, a smile teased the corner of Hermione’s lips and Ron howled with laughter, taking that as the affirmative. “It
“Still got the nose to the grindstone, Myra?” Liv teased lightly, sidling past several boxes strewn across the floor so that she could hand the slice of cake to her boss. “You should come out and join the celebrations. Dirk and Dora have snuck out of their offices for a bit and he’s brought along some rum punch for us.”
“Apart from the fact that there’s no guarantee that either of them will get the lead roles, Ginny isn’t going to fall head over heels in love with Harry again just because they’re cast as lovers in a romantic tragedy. This isn’t some cheesy romance novel, you know.”
The laughter died down abruptly at that stark warning. Liv gave a curt nod and marched back to her seat before letting out an exasperated sigh. “Right, where were we?”
“Oh, give me some credit, Harry!” he snapped. “I’ve been hexed to tell the truth, I haven’t developed a sudden bout of incurable stupidity!”
“A gentleman doesn’t kiss and tell,” he replied evasively, but his smile gave him away.
Liv’s shoulders sagged and she shook her head. “I’m sorry but there’s nothing I can—”
“Yeah? Well, good luck finding anyone else willing to sit with you!” Theo shouted after him.
“My my, you are quite impatient, aren’t you, Potter?” he teased, giving Harry’s already painfully hard cock a tight squeeze. Harry gasped and struggled to keep his hands to himself, desperately grasping his hands against the slippery surface of the mirror for purchase and finding none. Draco lowered his hand from Harry’s mouth. “You’re really desperate to come, aren’t you?”
“Like hell it is,” Ron muttered before suddenly yelping in pain as Hermione struck him on the arm with one of her heavy school books. “Ouch! Bloody hell, what was that for?”
“Better luck next time!” she shrugged.
Draco frowned slightly. “Are you serious?”
Harry snorted. “Thanks...I think.”
“If you must know, we’ve been trying to track down her parents but, so far, to no avail,” he explained. “I need you to double check that your office haven’t neglected to give us everything when we requested her files the first time.”
After an awkward few moments, he slipped a shaking hand into his doublet pocket and closed his eyes, taking a steadying breath, and the tension appeared to ease in his shoulders. When his eyes slid open again, he had stopped shaking, and when he finally spoke—to the surprise of everyone there, including the young man—his voice rang loud and clear...
Harry and Draco stayed for another couple of drinks before heading up to their room for the night. Draco sat on the bed with his back against the headboard watching Harry pace back and forth the room with his toothbrush in his mouth. He was chatting away about Quidditch, disappearing into the bathroom every so often to spit toothpaste into the sink before reappearing a moment later to continue. Draco smiled and nodded along, more taken with the domesticity of it all than the content of Harry’s words. He was going to miss this when they parted ways in the morning.
“Please,” Hestia replied with a slight nod. “So, today is your first day as a teacher, too? How are you feeling about it?”
The other students stood hesitantly by the door as they watched the wizened professor shuffle slowly behind his desk and began to scribble notes on the blackboard, but gradually they filed their way back into the classroom and took their seats. The rest of the lesson was mercifully dull as Professor Switch outlined the lesson plan for the year. Most of the lessons would be focused on mastering human transfiguration, which Harry wasn’t looking forward to; he’d struggled in previous years to perform relatively simple tasks such as changing the colour of his eyebrows. That said, the prospect of being able to change his entire physical appearance was appealing to him; it would be nice to be able to walk about in public like a normal person without always having to rely on his Invisibility Cloak. Harry thought that would probably appeal to someone like Draco as well.
“I’m not scared!” said Draco hotly. Harry couldn’t help but laugh at the indignant expression on his face.
There was more truth to that statement than Harry was willing to admit.
“What cheerful visual imagery you evoke,” he muttered.
“I’ll have you know that Peter Pan is one of the Muggle world’s greatest literary heroes,” Hermione offered.
wizards. His latest prey, sources report, is none other than the veritable saviour of the wizarding world himself, war hero and vanquisher of The Dark Lord, Harry Potter. No word yet on how Aline, daughter of Henri de Montmorency, Marquis of Chantilly, who is engaged to be married to the Malfoy heir, is taking this latest emotional blow. Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy couldn’t be reached for comment.”
Tom shrugged. “A few weeks. They’ve been taking it in shifts, see, waiting day and night, hoping that they might catch a glimpse of you. I suppose they heard that you’ve spent time here in the past. Not that I’m complaining mind; so long as they pay for their drinks and don’t bother the other patrons, they can sit and wait for as long as they like. I figured if I tried to coax them into leaving the pub today, that might arouse suspicion.”
Harry hesitated a moment before deciding it was better to be truthful. “Um, pretty serious, I think.”
“I’m not the one swinging doors into people’s faces!” Harry raged. His eyes narrowed and he gave Draco a curious look. “Why were you hiding in the toilet?”
Professor McGonagall’s eyes widened with surprise at those words but then she smiled fondly at Harry. “Very wise words, Mr Potter, and I quite agree. Still, it would be remiss of me to see two serial mischief-makers in such close proximity to one another and not remind you both that misbehaviour, tricks or stunts of any kind will not be tolerated, particularly after what happened earlier today. I’ve already had to confiscate alcohol and fireworks from a number of students.”
Draco huffed out a laugh. “Not particularly. Godric help me, I’m actually beginning to enjoy your company.”
Luna drew him a withering look. “Of course, it is! We’ve all put a lot of work into this play, everyone should know that and see it for themselves.” She glanced at her watch and rose to her feet. “I better head down to the Prefects’ carriage, I’ll hand out some more posters on the way.”
Draco frowned and snorted out a laugh when he noticed that Blinken had taken the present he’d bought for Myrtle out of his trunk and pinned it to the ceiling above his bed.
he reasoned. He could always get a toad...but considering the trouble that Neville had with Trevor, he didn’t fancy a pet that went missing constantly. He wasn’t sure what he’d buy, if anything. He’d need to think about it.
“I’ll never get used to talking to you hidden under that cloak,” whispered Ron out of the corner of his mouth. “Folk are staring at me chatting to myself. They must think I’m mental.”
“Hardly. I could do the Wollongong Shimmy with my eyes closed.”
Draco climbed between Harry’s legs and, after casting a contraceptive spell and applying a liberal amount of lube to his length, he lined himself up at Harry’s entrance, trying his best to ignore how nervous he felt.
Yes, everyone in Gladrags Wizardwear was thoroughly enjoying themselves.
“Sorry, Professor, I hope you don’t mind but Draco and I have been rehearsing together, too,” he said hurriedly. “I know I’ve already auditioned but…”
“I don’t want to talk about it,” he replied shortly.
“Traditionally, Muggle Studies has focused on the history and daily lives of Muggles and how they are able to live without magic. This year we’re going to apply greater emphasis on understanding Muggle society from a historical and sociological perspective. There will also be more practical elements integrated into the course; combining both these written and practical lessons will be essential to passing this course…”
“We were,” she said. “Only...well, since everyone else is at the show, Ron suggested that we take advantage of Gryffindor Tower being deserted, so we slipped away during the intermission. We didn’t realise that you were here, Harry...with Malfoy.”
“Of course you will,” Ron teased. “So, will you be letting Harry and I copy your homework this year?”
“What did?” asked Harry.
Draco smirked. “Thought not.”
"I don't fancy Malfoy!" he insisted, casting a nervous glance around them in case anyone else had overheard. Ginny grinned mischievously at him and held her hands up in mock surrender.
And panic had struck him then. He had looked down at his boxers where his erection should have been and seen, to his horror, that everything remained quite dormant. Ginny had taken notice of this too and had frowned at him.
Curious as to what he was talking about, Harry followed Draco’s line of sight and, to his surprise, he spotted Theo walking side by side with Ginny. The unlikely pairing didn’t go unnoticed by Ron, either. He glowered as his sister chatted animatedly to Theo while he smiled warmly at her and nodded in agreement with whatever she was saying.
Draco felt a wave of sympathy for Myrtle then. He was all too familiar with the feelings that she was describing; he’d been struggling with them for a while now, had been tormented them every time he had been in Harry’s company. But he craved the feeling as much as it tormented him: the giddiness he felt any time Harry smiled at him. The way his breath would hitch the few times Harry had touched him. The exquisite sensation of Harry’s lips pressed against his own…
“I know,” Draco replied. “Thank you.”
“Certainly not!” said Draco. “Besides, it’s common knowledge that gladiators fought with bare chests; the Romans viewed it as a symbol of masculine virility.”
Harry quickly covered Draco’s mouth with his hand before he could blurt out to curious passersby exactly what they had gotten up to earlier in the evening. Draco drew Harry an apologetic look and slowly Harry moved his hand away.
“Very well. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us on the matter. You are now excused.”
“The usual,” Theo shrugged. “Draco Malfoy, ex-Death Eater and least popular person in the wizarding world, is ‘attempting to revamp his tarnished image by taking part in a controversial Muggle play that centres around the love and tragic demise of the title characters’.”
“Yeah, I know,” he sighed. A deep frown set in Ron’s face then. He sat up suddenly and asked in an accusing tone, “Alright, tell me this—if you knew that you were gay, then why the hell did you string her along for so long?”
“The power of a prophecy is dependent solely on how much stock you put in them. The only prophecies
“Then have my lips the sin that they have took.”
When Hermione released Draco, Ron stepped forward and held out his hand to him. Draco eyed it warily for a moment before finally taking it into his own.
Luna glanced at the front cover and read the small headline at the bottom of the page. “Oh yes, I heard that Minister Shacklebolt has adopted a half-troll. Aurors are building a special reinforced nursery inside the Ministry for the baby.”
“It is a little bit,” Draco argued. “Look, I’m not particularly thrilled about it, either, but let’s be realistic—how many people actually read
Hermione didn’t look entirely convinced by Ron’s flattering remarks but she looked pleased nonetheless.
“Telling the truth and telling me what you believe are two very different things,” Harry countered.
“I have an idea,” he began slowly. “How about I go and distract them? I’ll get the books and the potions supplies while you go to Madam Malkin’s? It means I’ll need to put up with them following me about for a bit, but at least you can go and get your robes fitted in peace.”
Theo, still armed with his sword, marched over to where Harry and Ginny were sitting and beckoned Ginny to follow. “We’re up next, Weasley.”
“Uh, yeah,” she chuckled. “Who do you think that dishy blonde bloke he brought to Bill and Fleur’s wedding was?”
Liv’s head shot up from the desk at the sudden interruption, the note still stuck to her forehead. Standing on the other side of her desk was a woman that Minerva hated more vehemently than anyone else in the world.
he thought wryly to himself.
“Old issues of The Prophet,” she shrugged. “They’re forever taking photographs of you two, so there were plenty to choose from. I tried to pick two of the nicer ones.”
don't think important enough to mention,” he announced in a solemn voice. “It is with great regret that we inform our listeners of the murders of Ted Tonks and Dirk Cresswell…”
Draco talked Harry through the different techniques to relax and focus his mind, eventually falling silent and waiting until Harry felt relaxed enough to begin. He tried to focus on the stars overhead, but he couldn’t help but cast furtive glances in Harry’s direction, where he lay sprawled out in the grass with a contented expression. He so wanted to reach out and brush Harry’s hair from his face, the better to see those beautiful emerald eyes, sparkling in the light of the low-hanging moon. He wondered again what it would be like to kiss him, then immediately admonished himself for even entertaining the thought. How could he be foolish enough to think that Harry had been flirting with him? Draco was just convincing himself of things that he wanted to be there that weren’t. Besides, even though he and Harry might be on good terms now,
“Pity,” Ron pouted. “Ah well, I’ll savour these precious few minutes without him.”
The noise in the Great Hall faded away as Professor McGonagall rose to her feet, casting her stern gaze across the returning students.
“I hope I haven’t upset him too much,” she said, worriedly biting her lip.
“You’ll come down to visit me an’ Fang this Sunday, yeah?” he asked after finally releasing Harry, who staggered dazed back into his seat. “I wan’ ter hear all abou’ what ye been up tae this summer!”
Draco cocked an eyebrow at her. “If we won’t believe it, then how are we expected to guess what
“I’m not losing my temper!” Harry shouted. Draco cocked an eyebrow at him and Harry’s shoulders sagged. “The issue of my temper is beside the point—you didn’t help matters.”
“Why not?” he implored. “I can do better. I can try harder. Just tell me what to do, Gin, and I’ll do it. What can I do to change your mind?”
me?” he said, his voice rising.
Harry snarled and marched into the shop. Draco watched as Harry grabbed every single copy of
“It’s taking all of my willpower not to say anything derogatory about the Chudley Cannons fanatic you share a room with,” he quipped, nodding towards Ron’s bed, which was clad in a bright orange bedspread.
“I didn’t, but your shoes gave you away,” she replied simply. Harry turned to look at the apple tree and grimaced as he noticed his scuffed, white trainers sitting at its base.
“I know how it must look, Theo, but that’s not what happened,” Draco tried to explain, but Theo didn’t look particularly interested in what Draco had to say.
“Yeah,” Draco said quietly. “I came back.”
“Hold up. If you have a brand new car at home, why are you driving this old rust bucket?” Ron despaired.
“I still don’t trust those teeth of hers.”
Harry grinned. “Great. It’s a date!”
The doorbell tinkled and Harry quickly closed the shop door behind him, taking in his new and unfamiliar surroundings. The interior was not unlike the many bespoke tailors that one would find on Savile Row in Muggle London, only in place of three-piece suits were robes of the finest silk and pointed wizard’s hats with silver and gold buckles. Harry felt rather underdressed standing next to such fine wear in his grass-stained shorts and t-shirt. He caught sight of his reflection in one of the nearby mirrors and tried in vain to flatten his messy hair but quickly dropped his hand by his side when he heard hurried footsteps approach.
“Hogsmeade?” he croaked. “Is that really necessary?”
“And if she can’t?”
“I can manage this just fine on my own,” Harry grumbled. He glared at the feather on his desk with the utmost concentration, but try as he might, he couldn’t make it move. Draco watched Harry with growing amusement.
“You know what, Granger? I like it.”
“Alright...was it Nargles?”
“Yeah, I um...I need to buy some robes.”
“I’ve also had a few parents owling me wanting assurances that their child won’t be turned away at the school gates,” said Minerva. “I even received a letter from Azkaban from Theodore Nott’s father begging me to grant his son readmission. Although, I must admit, I was surprised that Narcissa Malfoy contacted me requesting that Draco be allowed to resit his final year.”
“I would like to, but I’ll only tell them when you feel ready for them to know,” Harry assured him.
Draco bit his lip and after a moment he nodded. “Yeah, okay. It’s probably a good idea to run through the scene a couple of times before we perform it in front of everyone else.”
“Tired,” he said irritably. “But not in any pain, thankfully.”
“How come you get to play Tybalt?” Draco cut in. Harry’s smile wavered.
“Well, genius, what do you suggest?” he asked huffily.
“I stand corrected—this is worse than my robes for the Yule Ball,” he declared mournfully.
As Ron and Hermione continued their argument, Harry’s eyes drifted towards the Slytherin table. He noted that there were a few more miserable faces there than the other three houses; several of the older students looked nervous to be back at Hogwarts, and unlike the rest of the school who chatted excitedly with one another, few of the Slytherins were speaking. He scanned the table and was surprised to see so many familiar faces had returned: Goyle was sitting with Theo, Blaise and Pansy, the four of them leaning close to each other, whispering amongst themselves. Someone was noticeably absent from this gloomy little group and Harry scanned the table for a platinum-blonde head. He was surprised to see Draco sitting at the opposite end of the Slytherin table, hand resting on his face and looking incredibly bored. Harry watched him curiously for a few moments—why wasn’t he sitting with his friends?
Minerva considered the proposition for a moment before giving her a curt nod. “That sounds acceptable.”
Draco shifted in his seat, unsettled by how relatable those words were. It had been the one thing that he had reminded himself constantly when he had first begun harbouring these dangerous and entirely inconvenient feelings for Harry. The perpetual thorn in his side since Harry had kissed him, and since he had kissed Harry back. Had he been anyone else in the world—anyone but a Malfoy—things between him and Harry would be quite different, they wouldn’t have to hide for fear of retribution. But his name, once a point of pride, now shackled him in shame. It served as nothing more than a constant reminder of how, as far as everyone else was concerned, he and Harry shouldn’t be together. Love be damned, he was a Capulet, and Harry was a Montague; they were sworn enemies, and nobody would ever let them forget it.
There was a pregnant pause as Goyle screwed up his eyes to better read the next line and stumbled over the words, “I mean, an be we—whoops, no, um—we
“It’s Weasley,” he whispered over his shoulder. “He’s arguing with Ginny and Theo.”
“What’s going on, Neville?” she asked, trying to step past him to open the door but paused as he held his hand up to stop her.
“Weasley,” Draco greeted him with a slight nod.
“Oh! Um, fine, I suppose,” Liv stammered. Needing a moment to collect herself, she took a protracted drink before speaking again. “No mutinies yet, thankfully. If anything, most of the students seem to be enjoying taking part.”
While chaos reigned, Peeves flew overhead, laughing maniacally as he revelled in the turmoil unfolding below. When Harry finally managed to reach his friends, he called out to them to get their attention and their heads snapped towards him. Ginny’s eyes welled with tears and Ron looked absolutely livid.
Harry frowned. “Dennis is back?”
“Have you considered that perhaps you only saw what Zabini wanted you to see?” Hermione suggested with a slight edge to her voice. Ron frowned.
A few days had passed since Myrtle told Harry about someone vandalising her beloved toilet. He couldn’t get the image out of his mind of Myrtle moping about her bathroom, unable to do anything about the graffiti herself, so he decided to do something about it. Aware of his own limited artistic expertise, he told Luna what he planned to do and she was more than happy to assist him. So rather than use their free evening catching up with their homework or spending time with friends, they were headed in the direction of the girl’s lavatory on the second floor armed with buckets of paint and paintbrushes.
“That’s putting it mildly,” Ron cut in, but Hermione ignored his interruption and pressed on.
“Well, don’t!” Harry shot back. “You’re just making it worse.”
“Well, it was a life or death situation…” Ron muttered.
Events took a predictably strange turn at the end of the lesson when Harry, Ron, Hermione and Neville left the classroom and started making their way down towards the greenhouses for a double period of Herbology. They were walking down a deserted corridor discussing their thoughts on the eccentric Transfiguration professor when, without warning, Goyle stepped in front of them, flanked by Theo, Pansy and Blaise. Hermione yelped in surprise and the group stopped dead in their tracks as the imposing Slytherin loomed over them, blocking their path. His expression was more threatening than usual, his heavy brow knitted into a deep frown and his hands clenched into tight fists by his sides.
“Helloooooo,” he called, his voice echoing in the empty corridor. “Is anybody there?”
“While you might not necessarily be gay, I think based on our previous attempts...I think it’s safe to assume that we, at least, are not compatible,” she replied carefully. “There’s a difference between loving a person and being attracted to them.”
"When will you tell Weasley and Granger?" he asked.
“They’re a bit like Quidditch, but Swivenhodge is way harder,” Ron replied. “You need to ride your broomstick backwards the whole time.”
Myrtle floated to the opposite end of the bathroom and pointed to the stall nearest the sinks. Harry stopped dead in his tracks and felt his stomach contract when he read the messages scrawled across Myrtle’s stall:
“Nothing in particular,” she shrugged before adding, “That’s a fine jumper you’re wearing. Did Ron’s mum knit it for you?”
months
Draco laughed and flopped onto the bench next to Harry. “I’d like to see you try!”
“I always wondered where you went during the summer holidays,” Draco continued conversationally. “I thought that you spent your time being trained by Dumbledore.”
Neville cried and the classroom watched with morbid fascination as a silent battle of mental willpower took place. For a few moments, nothing seemed to happen as the boys stood in front of each other, stock-still with expressions of extreme concentration on their faces. Then, suddenly, Goyle clenched his fists and grunted. Neville gripped his wand more tightly and frowned—clearly, he was putting everything that he could into breaking Goyle’s mental fortress. Goyle’s shoulders began to shake and his expression of concentration morphed into one of pain.
“No, I mean—” Harry wrung his hands in his lap and forced out the next words with some effort. “You’re not mad about me, being...you know…”
Harry let out an exasperated sigh and turned back to face Draco again.
“Draco, what on earth are you wearing?” she asked.
Liv resisted the temptation to roll her eyes then since she remembered, all too well, greeting teachers with the same level of enthusiasm when she was at school. Stepping out from behind her desk, she began to slowly pace back and forth in front of the class.
“If things go the way I think they will, then soon enough we’re going to have bigger things to concern ourselves with than the logistics around hosting the next Quidditch World Cup,” Myra grumbled. “You should start to seriously consider how much longer you want to keep working here at the Ministry.”
After clearing the air with Draco, Harry thoroughly enjoyed the remainder of his Christmas holidays. Draco and Theo became regular visitors at The Burrow, much to the annoyance of Ron. He seemed to be struggling with an internal battle between his long-standing hatred of the two Slytherins and the happiness that they brought his sister and best friend, but despite butting heads a few times, they managed to keep things civil for the most part. Draco probably didn’t help himself, however, when he insisted on wearing his Weasley jumper at every possible opportunity. Ron would draw the jumper dark looks as though it had caused him great personal offence, which Draco absolutely delighted in. When the pair weren’t slinging snide remarks at one another, they would take their frustration with each other out in the apple orchard playing Quidditch with Harry and the other Weasleys. Once Draco had proved himself a worthy opponent on a broomstick, the Weasley clan gradually warmed to him, too. Not that the Weasleys’ opinions would have changed his mind about Draco, but it did come as a relief when they began to accept that he’d be a more permanent fixture in his life.
Dennis visibly tensed when Professor McGonagall reached out and picked up the folded piece of parchment. When she had finished unfolding it, she stilled as her eyes darted across the page. After a moment, she slid the parchment towards the two boys. Dennis didn’t bother to look at it, but Harry sat forward, keen for any explanation as to what he was doing here and how the night’s events were supposed to involve him. When he read the title on the top of the page, Harry’s mouth fell open.
“Like I need another shower,” Harry laughed, brushing his damp hair out of his eyes.
“The play,” Hestia repeated patiently. “How are rehearsals coming along?”
“I’ll just leave you here,” said Sir Nicholas, already turning to leave. “I have other messages that I need to deliver. Good luck.”
“You look like Peter Pan,” said Draco.
“Yes, it’s quite invasive,” Draco replied stiffly. “But...I know what you did wasn’t intentional. And I may have overreacted a little bit, storming off like I did. I probably should have stayed to help you look for your wand.”
“Not until you drop your wand,” he countered, glaring down at Draco.
“I told you already, I don’t know anything about Muggles!” he cried. “And I’m still not particularly interested in finding out about them either, thank you very much.”
. I’m allowed to be distressed about my predicament,” she said testily. “You, however, are very much alive, and your biggest complaint is that a boy that you like happens to like you back. Excuse me if I don’t have much sympathy for you.”
“Handsome with a double dose of mischievousness,” she laughed, carefully placing it back onto her desk. “We wouldn’t have expected any less, considering what Dora and Remus were like.”
“Contraband!” he declared gleefully, pulling a large bottle of sherry out from the bottom of one of the trunks. “Someone has secured themselves detention with me on their first day!”
“Their love is doomed and the lovers die at the end of the play, in each other's arms.” Myrtle sighed dreamily, her pale, misty eyes glazing over.
“I’m just about to get onto that very subject. Our lessons will actually entail learning two obscure but highly useful branches of magic...” Hestia began scribbling across the blackboard and Harry’s momentary feelings of elation were immediately extinguished as he realised what they would be learning. Hestia underlined two words that she had written on the blackboard. “Legilimency and Occlumency. Who here can tell me what each spell does? Miss Granger?”
—” Harry angrily brandished his left hand which still bore the thin white scars from Umbridge’s Blood Quill “—prevented us from learning defensive magic. That’s why Dumbledore’s Army was started in the first place! And as for targeting Slytherins, you just had to take a look at the Inquisitorial Squad—full of Slytherins, it was. If anything, they were targeting us!”
As the lift pinged and the gilded door slid open, the foursome dragged their trunks down the well-lit corridor towards their rooms. As Harry fumbled with his room key, Ron and Hermione wished them both goodnight (well, Hermione did. Ron just grunted and disappeared into his room without a word), leaving the pair alone for the first time in several days. Harry unlocked the door, pushed it open and beckoned Draco inside.
“Sure you don’t,” she chuckled. She nodded towards Draco. “So, what’s going on with you two?”
“You know, Theo and Greg are going through a tough time at the moment and they’re upset about their dads. And with yours getting off, well…to them, it feels like you’re rubbing it in their faces a bit,” she explained.
“What do you mean?”
“Hmm.” Hestia looked thoughtful for a moment. “You don’t think that they…”
When it was Harry’s turn to speak, Liv was pleasantly surprised to see that, despite appearing nervous, his delivery of the lines was clear and well-paced.
“But we cannot tar all Slytherins with the same brush,” she implored. “There are just as many good ones as bad.”
Despite feeling the happiest he had felt in as long as he could remember, Harry couldn’t help but feel guilty about keeping such a big secret from Ron and Hermione. They had been to hell and back with Harry, seen him at his very best and worst. They were a constant source of strength and support for him throughout the years and he was repaying them by lying to them about his relationship with Draco. The more he thought about it, the more his guilt ate away at him.
“It happened by accident,” Harry explained. “The snake winked at me and we started talking about how annoying my cousin Dudley was. I didn’t even realise I was speaking Parseltongue, either, that just came naturally to me. But then Dudley saw the snake talking to me and knocked me on my arse to take a better look at it, and...well.”
“Why are you out here looking for me, anyway?” he asked, keen to change the subject.
“Maybe,” Draco admitted grudgingly. “Although it did nearly take my arm clean off!”
“We’re...what do you mean?” Draco asked, confused. Theo glowered at him.
cats, wasn’t it? Merlin, the Slytherins like to paint themselves as a mysterious bunch but they’re really quite boring, aren’t they? Not as boring as Zabini, mind you…”
An amused smile spread across Liv’s face. “Well, I'm glad to hear you're enjoying yourself. Did you like the play?”
Draco turned to see Harry, Ron and Hermione hurrying towards them, huffing as they dragged their trunks across the wet ground. Harry smiled when he saw Draco and came to a stop beside him.
Snatching the pen out of Draco’s hand, Harry drew a smiley face onto a piece of parchment to demonstrate. Draco looked mildly impressed by this.
“Have
“No, she hasn’t said anything.”
“No, but
Ron waved Hermione off dismissively and turned back to Harry. “Never mind her, this plan is sure to work.”
“Oh wow, one person out of how many?” he replied sarcastically rolling his eyes.
Before she burst into a fresh fit of tears, Mrs Weasley turned on her heel and marched down the platform in the direction of the ladies’ room. Draco turned to Harry’s best friends and smirked.
“I don’t know, nothing too fancy. Well…” she looked sheepishly at Draco and asked, “If you happened across a poster of Prince William, or maybe a plate with his face on it, I’d be ever so grateful. Or a tea towel! Yes, that would be lovely.”
Liv scrutinised her appearance closely and let out a weary sigh: god, she looked tired. She had faint marionette lines draping from the corners of her mouth and she was developing wrinkles around her coffee-coloured eyes. She tsked as she noticed a large toothpaste stain on the front of her olive robes. Licking her thumb, she tried to rub it off but to no avail.
“A chance to do what?” asked Harry.
Naturally, Harry’s wandering eyes fell onto Draco, who sat on his own with his feet propped up on an empty chair, nose buried in his script. He had a slight crease on his brow as he concentrated on reading his lines, his dark grey eyes flitting back and forth across the page. A couple of days had passed since their nighttime jaunt to the Quidditch Stadium and, much to Harry’s disappointment, they hadn’t spoken since. He figured that he’d leave Draco a few days to cool down before trying to speak to him again, but he found that he rather missed talking to the snarky Slytherin. His eyes fell towards Draco’s lips, pink and wet as he unconsciously sucked on the tip of his quill, completely unaware to the effect that this small action was having on Harry. He felt like he’d begun to obsess over Draco’s lips in the last few days, wondering how they would feel against his own. Would they feel as soft as they look? What did he taste like? Harry imagined that Draco tasted of something fresh and outdoorsy, like spearmint. His pleasant daydream was rudely interrupted when he felt a sharp nudge to his ribs. Finally, he tore his eyes away from Draco and turned to Ginny, who drew him a withering look.
“Wait up, Potter. I want to talk to you!”
“What is it?” he asked sharply.
“What’s this?” he asked curiously.
“Only the most disciplined witches and wizards are capable of performing advanced wandless magic reliably,” Hestia continued. “Transfiguration and Charms are particularly difficult to perform without a wand. But today we’re going to focus on something simple.”
“Thank you, Madam,” Liv replied flatly, staring at the pink folder in her hands.
Minerva buried her face in her hands and burst into tears. Albus and Severus watched her silently as she cried freely, Albus’s brow furrowed, concern set in deep lines in his ancient face. Severus’s expression remained impassive, but he didn’t criticise her like she had expected him to. He had been in her shoes, after all, and knew all too well the incredible strain headship at Hogwarts could put on you.
Yaxley didn’t look entirely convinced by the lie, but he appeared to let it slide as he changed the subject.
Draco hesitated, “You want to keep practising with me?”
“Fast at learning what?” he asked, confused.
Harry smiled and rolled his eyes. “Thanks very much, Professor Malfoy.”
Draco lowered his wand, breaking the connection between them, his expression calm and collected, whereas Harry was a panting, shivering wreck.
After a few moments of silence, Harry began to gently snore. Although Draco wasn’t particularly tired himself, he was content to stay right where he was. With the click of his fingers, bedside lamps switched off and the bedroom was plunged into darkness. The sounds of the city poured through the open window, but Draco focused on the sound of Harry’s heartbeat against his ear; a slow, strong thud that helped lull him into the first peaceful night’s sleep he’d had in a very long time. He and Harry both knew that they couldn’t stay hidden away in their little oasis forever, but for the short time they were here, he’d savour every minute of it.
“He’s not supposed to be here,” said Theo irritably. “You know that it’s against the rules.”
“I don’t think it would look very professional if students caught two of their professors kissing in the corridor,” she said a little breathlessly. “Would you like to come in for a cup of tea?”
“Well, that’s progress of sorts,” Hermione encouraged. “You did say that you were going to try and stay out of trouble this year. Well done for not losing your temper with him, Harry. I know that couldn’t have been easy.”
“Just curious,” she replied lightly. “We went to school together, you know. He was a couple of years ahead of me but I knew him through the Slug Club. And we’ve crossed paths from time to time at the Ministry.”
“Uh...sure.”
Just then, Ginny’s raucous laughter filled the busy corridor and she lightly slapped Theo on the chest. Theo’s face broke out into a goofy grin and Ron’s scowl deepened.
Tom waved goodbye to them as the group set off down the twisting cobbled street, bustling with shoppers who were enjoying the summer sun. Harry had grown adept at dodging people over the years so he wound his way easily through the thronging crowds without being detected. As they approached the burnished bronze doors of Gringotts Bank, he noticed that two goblins stood sentry, each holding gold spears. They bowed Mrs Weasley and Ginny through the silver doors into the main entrance of the bank but quickly straightened as Hermione and Ron (and, unbeknownst to them, Harry) walked past. Ron frowned as he passed the goblin guards.
The Fat Lady cast the Slytherin interloper one last warning look before reluctantly granting them entrance. Harry had hoped that the common room would be deserted but while it was noticeably quieter than usual, a few other students had also opted to skip the show. Predictably, Draco drew a few curious glances from the other Gryffindors while Dennis Creevey, who sat in the far corner with a couple of friends, looked incensed at his appearance. Harry thought that perhaps bringing Draco here hadn’t been such a great idea after all. Rather than risk any arguments, he immediately beelined for the stairwell towards the boys’ dormitory.
“You lot sit here in your ivory tower, telling us that we ought to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps and get on with things,” Dennis spat. “That’s be easy for you to say, especially when you haven’t lost anything. People lost their homes. Their entire families. The right to do magic. My brother
“The sword is pretty cool,” said Harry keenly, unsheathing it from its scabbard and swinging it from side to side.
“We all lost something during the war,” said Professor McGonagall solemnly. “Some more than others. But while I can sympathise with your situation, that does not give you and your friends licence to terrorise students, however you try to justify your actions.”
“On that note, I am happy to announce certain improvements have been made to the arena,” she continued. “In addition to playing future games, we have installed a retractable pitch, which will allow for a variety of events to take place there, including Swivenhodge and Stichstock, as well as concerts and theatrical productions...”
“Well, if you hadn’t nicked my Remembrall, McGonagall wouldn’t have seen Harry fly,” Neville pointed out.
Ron gaped at Hermione before turning to his best friend for support, “Harry, help me out here.”
“How are rehearsals coming along?”
“Well…” Hermione began. “It could have something to do with his father being handed a life sentence in Azkaban. Or his best friend being killed in a fire…”
“He told me to stick my script up my arse,” Liv repeated matter-of-factly. “To be honest, I was more upset that he broke my favourite mug.”
Despite Draco’s reservations, he didn’t argue the point with Harry any further. Relations between his best friend and boyfriend remained chilly in the days that passed. Ron regularly drew Draco dark looks of ill-intent at every given opportunity, but considering this behaviour was par for the course, to the casual onlooker, there was nothing about it that would have aroused any suspicions. That said, everyone was so fixated on their own problems that even if a mountain troll in a tutu had strolled past the Great Hall, people likely wouldn’t have noticed.
“Being a wizard in the Muggle world was difficult enough already without my sexuality complicating matters further. I didn’t want to give my aunt and uncle another reason to hate me more than they already did, so I kept my thoughts and feelings to myself.”
“It’s no more than he deserves, if you ask me,” Ron chipped in. “It’s one thing winding up Slytherins, but that didn’t give him and his mates licence to drag the rest of us into it. We didn’t do anything!”
Draco hesitated but finally, he nodded. “Yes, I agree. I think that it’s best we explore whatever this is a little more in-depth.”
“Shame,” she said as she tried to nudge Draco on the shoulder only for her arm to go straight through his body. “So, are you going to take him on a romantic stroll down Little Venice? Treat him to a fancy dinner and then kiss him under the moonlight?”
“I’m joking!” he laughed. “Let me know if I’m going too fast for you.”
Draco didn’t look ruffled by Harry’s angry outburst. Instead, he sat in silent contemplation for a few moments before speaking again.
Draco smiled and planted his forearms on either side of Harry’s head to steady himself before he began to thrust again. His pace was slow and steady at first as he slid in and out of Harry’s body in long strokes, but he wasn’t sure how much longer he could keep this up. The beautifully obscene sounds that Harry was making were pushing him dangerously close to the edge, and when Harry pressed the heel of his foot against his arse and practically begged him to fuck him deeper, Draco just about lost his mind. When Draco began thrusting harder, Harry’s hands clawed at his back and slid up to fist his hair. He pulled Draco down towards him, his moan swallowed up by the hungry press of Draco’s mouth against his own. If the gasps and breathy moans spilling from Harry’s lips weren’t a clear indication of his pleasure, the way his tight hole clenched and unclenched eagerly around Draco’s cock certainly was. It gave Draco an intoxicating rush of power knowing that he was the one who made Harry feel this way—the one to make him writhe and moan with pleasure beneath him, to make him beg for more...
“Are you sure?” asked Liv, but Pansy insisted that it wasn’t an issue. Liv gave a careless shrug. “Very well. I have no objection if Miss Parkinson is happy to swap roles.”
of Madam Pomfrey’s shoes as she hurried towards them.
Minerva closed her eyes and took several deep breaths, trying to compose herself. As her breaths evened out, the spiral of morose thoughts that had momentarily consumed her were tempered and pushed aside. She didn’t have time to be self-pitying: there was too much work to do, too many people were relying on her.
“Yup,” Liv sighed, vanishing the empty cups and walking Hestia to the door. “It’ll be interesting to see how many of them rehearsed.”
“Looks like we’ve saved the best for last,” she said brightly. “Draco, it’s your turn.”
“Merlin, Potter, are you as blind as you are stupid?” he snapped, slamming the toilet door shut behind him. “Watch where you’re going!”
Harry shrugged. “Not really. I didn’t need my school bag last year, so I haven’t looked in it since the end of sixth year. I must have a quill in here somewhere…”
Liv’s eyes widened in surprise. “Really? Th-thank you, Headmistress. I’ll do my best.”
Draco humphed out a laugh and pushed Harry’s hand away. “You really do have the libido of a jackrabbit, don’t you?”
“The Dursleys weren’t exactly connoisseurs of the theatre,” he explained. “I almost saw one of his plays once: my school arranged for everyone to go and see
“Well this simply goes to prove what I’ve always said: Muggles are a barbaric bunch,” he declared.
“When is this?” asked Minerva.
“These three,” said the goblin, pointing accusingly at Harry, Ron and Hermione, “are not welcome here!”
“Hmm.” Lucius signed the bottom of the letter in his usual elaborate cursive signature before pulling another blank piece of parchment towards him. “And school?”
“How I choose to teach this class and the format of examination is to my discretion,” she replied evenly. “But if it will put your minds at ease, Professor McGonagall has already signed off on the project.”
Harry shrugged. “It’s a rare chance for me to spend a whole evening where nobody knows who I am.”
“A study in idleness, perhaps!” she snapped. “Get back into your own bed, Mr Potter. Immediately!”
“How do I cope with your stupid remarks?” he sneered. “With difficulty.”
“Of course, since I let you have a shot of my broomstick, I think it’s only fair that I get a ride of yours,” Draco teased.
Luckily for him, the only person he happened across was Sir Nicholas who, after checking that Harry was alright, escorted him back to Gryffindor Tower to make sure that he didn’t make any more late night diversions. He tried to sneak into the dormitory as quietly as possible, hoping that everyone else was asleep, but Ron sat on his bed reading a magazine, evidently waiting for him. He looked up as Harry slipped inside and cocked an eyebrow at his friend’s dishevelled appearance.
A few days had passed since Harry had spoken to Draco about the pranks that the Slytherins had been subjected to. Thankfully, nothing else had happened since then, and he hoped that whoever was responsible had simply grown tired of their pranks and had given up. Still, that didn’t deter him from searching for the elusive P.A.’s identity. He had asked Hermione and Ron to help investigate and both had agreed, albeit reluctantly. Hermione was quick to point out how quickly Harry’s plans for a quiet, uneventful year of studying had fallen apart, but she wasn’t one to pass up the opportunity to help others or spend extra time in the library. Ron insisted that the only reason he was helping was so that he could shake the hand of the person tormenting the Slytherins, but Harry appreciated his help nonetheless. Unsure of what to look for, Hermione had suggested scouring the school register for clues. Ron had pointed out it would be pretty stupid for someone to sign the graffiti with their own initials, but Hermione insisted that they check anyway. Not surprisingly, they came up empty-handed.
It was hard enough being universally despised, having to put on a brave face every morning and endure the barrage of insults and dirty looks that followed him everywhere he went these days. It was exhausting pretending that he didn’t care about other people’s opinions because the truth was he cared very deeply. His father had raised him to always pay attention to what others said about him and to take care about the image that he projected: strength and authority, to never show fear or compassion because people would view them as weaknesses. In his father’s eyes, the very worst thing Draco could be is weak.
“What was wrong with it?” he asked, dropping Draco’s hand. Draco scoffed and made a dismissive gesture.
“Should we start by rehearsing the kissing scene again?” Harry chanced. Draco gave a dramatic sigh but quickly tossed the script aside. They still had all day to rehearse, he reasoned.
Mrs Weasley patted Draco on the back before releasing him and turned to face Harry again. “Alright, I’ll leave you to say goodbyes in private. I’ll be hearing from you soon, yes?”
“So, are you going to tell me what you’re dressing up as?” asked Harry for what must have been the hundredth time. Draco smirked and shook his head.
Draco snorted, “And?”
rang through the air and an ancient-looking house-elf appeared. He bowed so low that his long, thin nose touched the flagstone floor.
“I know.” Dennis gave a careless shrug. “As far as I was concerned, it was worth the risk of getting caught.”
“Not quite,” he said before casting a sly glance in Harry’s direction. “But I came pretty close to it.”
“Ever the humble man,” he chastised lightly. Draco’s smile broadened. He glanced around to make sure nobody was paying attention to them before he took a step closer to Harry.
“Exactly,” Hermione confirmed with a curt nod. Ron shook his head in disbelief.
“Yeah, these look...great, actually. Thank you.”
“Pleasure to see you again, Mr Potter!” Tom, the pub’s wizened barman, greeted Harry cheerfully, holding his hand out to him. Harry took the proffered hand and gave it a firm shake.
“It’s by the same author,” she explained, unable to hide the enthusiasm in her voice. “Technically it’s a children’s book but it’s still one of my favourites.”
An uncomfortable silence followed and no one invited Draco to sit down. Panic began to rise in Draco then; this was a much frostier reception than he had anticipated. He cleared his throat and turned to Goyle.
Harry was going to come out to his friends when he felt ready to do so. Draco ought to be accorded the same right to come out to his parents when he felt ready, too. He wasn’t going to begrudge Draco wanting to keep his sexuality and—by extension—their relationship private. And if Harry were being completely honest with himself, the idea of having some semblance of a private life was more than appealing to him. Up until this point, everything in his life had been reported, documented and scrutinised at such length that he wouldn’t be surprised if the cover page of the Daily Prophet one of these days was a play-by-play analysis of his latest bowel movement. It was nice keeping something in his life just to himself for a change—something special, something only for him and Draco.
Professor McGonagall drew them a disapproving look for their outburst before answering. “While it is too late in the year to play for the Quidditch cup, friendly matches are allowed to recommence—”
Defence Against the Dark Arts was one of the few classes that Harry had been looking forward to when he had decided to return to Hogwarts. It was by far his best subject and after his lacklustre start in both Herbology and Transfiguration, he was keen to show off his abilities at something he was actually good at. If he learned some useful skills that would help him on the road to becoming an Auror, that was an added bonus. Harry’s excitement grew when he entered the classroom to find that all of the desks had been pushed up against the walls and seats arranged in pairs had been set out. That could mean only one thing…
“I wouldn’t hold your breath, mate,” Harry muttered, focusing on the food on his plate rather than Goyle’s death stare. Harry had tackled with far worse in his life than the likes of Gregory Goyle, so whatever his problem was, Harry wasn’t going to lose any sleep over it.
Harry couldn’t help the mental image of him crashing into the Great Hall atop the thestral-drawn carriage at top speed flashing through his mind. He struggled to suppress a smile as he envisioned Filch and Mrs Norris diving out of his way and the other students scattering in all directions before he came to an abrupt stop in front of a livid Professor McGonagall. Harry quickly turned away from Draco to hide his face; he didn’t want to give him the satisfaction of seeing that he’d made Harry laugh.
Liv pushed open the door to the cramped bookshop and quickly closed it behind her, cutting off the blustering wind. She let out a small sigh of relief, enjoying the warmth within and the sweet, musky smell of thousands of old books. Not surprisingly, it was much quieter here than it was in Honeydukes or Dervish and Banges. A few of the older students milled about the maze of bookcases, stacked from floor to ceiling with ancient tomes and magical manuscripts. Liv smiled politely to the old shopkeeper as she weaved her way between the shelves, pretending to take interest in random books as she ventured deeper into the heart of the shop, occasionally pulling one off of the shelf and turning it over in her hand before placing it back without reading the title. Slowly, she made her way to the farthest corner of the shop. She was careful not to be seen hanging around in this particular section of the shop—the last thing she needed was for a student to catch sight of the books she was perusing and spread gossip about her at the school.
Harry’s smile fell.
The tailor looked pleased at the compliment. “My pleasure, sir. I’ll have these wrapped up for you.”
“Today is going to be a practical lesson,” Hestia announced as the students filed into the room. “Everyone just grab a seat for now, we’ll need to go over some safety checks before we can begin. Are we all here? No stragglers? Brilliant. Now, first things first…” She flicked her wand and a large pile of parchment sat atop her desk took flight, distributing a sheet to each of the students. “Everyone needs to fill in a waiver in order to participate in the upcoming practical lessons, which will be held once a week during lessons on Fridays. Everyone here is of age and can decide for themselves whether or not they consent to taking part. Miss Weasley, do you have a question?”
Harry shrugged. “Either or. Both.”
“The students are who I’m worried about,” she argued. “I’m concerned about how many parents believe the tripe that is written in this article and are now second-guessing whether or not to allow their children to attend Hogwarts.”
in col-choler...we’ll draw.”
“It’s a Wiggentree sapling,” he explained with a note of awe in his voice. “Gran got me one for my birthday this year. They’re quite rare but they’re dead useful: the bark is used to make Wiggenweld potions and anyone who touches the trunk of one of the trees will be protected from Dark creatures. When it’s fully grown I’m going to plant it in my garden and, hopefully, it’ll attract some Bowtruckles!”
“Fair point.”
“She won’t bite you! Just—oh for god’s sake, stop fidgeting!”
Draco stammered, “Sorry, that’s not what I...I just meant—”
“Are you alright?” he cried over the clapping of the crowd.
“Hmm, I suppose so,” Draco relented. “Still, it’s not a very flattering critique of humanity, is it?”
“Fine. If you’re not scared then getting on the carriage isn’t going to be a problem, is it?” He climbed aboard the carriage leaving Draco alone on the dark, deserted pathway. After waiting a few moments, Harry popped his head out of the carriage window and called to Draco, “Are you coming or not?”
As Harry recited his lines proclaiming love at first sight, Liv and Hermione watched intently as he crossed the stage to be nearer to Draco. On cue, Theo, in the role of Tybalt, and Michael began to argue on stage about the presence of a Montague at the Capulet ball but Harry paid them no mind. He had eyes only for Draco—or Juliet—whatever...
“Yes, you do,” she smirked. “I like you Draco, but you are prone to bouts of self-pity.”
“I didn’t say that,” Harry replied quickly. “It’s just...I’m surprised that you’re being so candid about your feelings, is all. Usually, it’s like getting blood from a stone.”
“A lot of them were just kids, Neville,” Hermione argued. “They didn’t have a choice.”
The script immediately ceased its assault but hovered ominously over his head as he stalked down the corridor towards Professor Tonks’s office. When it felt like he was dawdling, it nudged him on the shoulder, encouraging him to get a move on. Draco tried taking a swipe at it the first time it did this but it dodged his attack and struck him on the back of the hand. Draco gritted his teeth in anger and frustration but kept his hands to himself after that.
“Really?” she asked, sounding unconvinced. “That’s not what I’ve heard.”
“I’ve to escort you to her office immediately,” Sir Nicholas continued. “So if you wouldn’t mind…”
“It’s not a dress, Ronald, it’s a toga!” she bristled. “Men in ancient Rome and Greece wore togas every day and they were a symbol of your status and power.”
“I’ll let him know,” Harry assured her.
“Enough to put up around the school,” she explained, unperturbed by Harry’s horrified expression. “In the common rooms and classrooms, and a few to hand into the shops on our next visit to Hogsmeade.”
Ron stared blankly at Hermione. “Can I have that again but in English, please?”
“Very funny,” Hestia mumbled, screwing the cap shut again. “I’ll get Slughorn to take a look at it once he’s been treated.”
Harry sighed and stepped into the fireplace, resigned to the fact that as an adopted Weasley he was fair game to any and all jokes from his family. Tossing the Floo powder into the grate, he made sure to cry “Diagon Alley!” clearly this time before he was pulled forward and the Burrow’s living room disappeared in a whirl of emerald green flames.
“It looked like a rat to me,” Draco muttered.
Sure, Theo had taken the first step to try and repair their friendship by offering an olive branch to Draco, but if Theo knew Draco at all, he should have realised his folly: he had hurt Draco’s pride and that was something that he always had trouble forgiving. Even though Draco desperately wanted to be friends with Theo again, his own stubbornness prevented him from forgiving and forgetting the slight against him; it just wasn’t the Malfoy way.
Draco tutted, “Oh please, I’m not going to—WAAAAAAAH!”
“No, you weren’t. You spent the entire evening playing Exploding Snap!”
“Why didn’t you say anything?” asked Harry.
Draco suppressed a smirk and nodded to her. “Thank you, Mrs Weasley, you’re too kind.”
Harry’s speech stalled as he felt something tug the back of his broomstick. Looking over his shoulder, he found Draco with a mischievous grin on his face, pulling his broom tail.
The chatter in the room came to an abrupt halt and all eyes turned towards Draco. That surge of relief that had briefly risen in him swiftly retreated as he realised that his sudden appearance was not a welcome one. Theo Nott sat nearest the window to Draco’s left, a polite smile fixed upon his face that didn’t reach his eyes. Beside him sat Blaise Zabini, his haughty expression usually only reserved for non-Slytherins now fixed firmly on Draco. Across from him was Pansy Parkinson, whose eyes darted between Draco and Gregory Goyle, who was sat beside her. Goyle wouldn’t meet Draco’s eyes, a deep frown set on his face as he stared at his hands rested on his lap, clenched into tight fists.
Draco sat on one of the stadium benches, unconsciously thumbing the edge of his script as he watched Harry and Theo resume rehearsing their big fight scene in which Romeo kills Tybalt in a fit of furious grief. In truth, he was only half-watching the fight; Draco had seen the pair perform the scene enough times now that he knew the lines and choreography by heart. Instead, his gaze kept drifting over to Dennis who stood off to the side and out of sight of everyone else, painting one of the background set pieces. Liv had tried her best to get Dennis to participate in the play—she’d even given him a speaking role that would open up the performance—but Dennis remained reluctant to take part in any shape or form. For the time being, she had resorted to giving him small tasks on his own, such as painting scenery and running errands for her.
He rounded the corner and came to a stop when he caught sight of who the other customer was. Standing in front of the three-panel dressing mirror was a tall figure with white-blonde hair and a bored expression on his pale face. Draco Malfoy was wearing, to Harry’s shock, a brand new set of Hogwarts robes, glittering with pins around the hem and the edges of the sleeves.
“You came back.”
Harry glanced over at Draco who smirked at him. Of course, this was going to be no trouble at all for him. While everyone else screwed their faces up in concentration, struggling to make their feathers move, Draco easily levitated his off of the table and across the room to Hestia. Smiling, she snatched the feather out of mid-air and strode over to his desk.
“What are you boys up to out here?”
Harry dug a thumbnail into the palm of his hand, using the pain to distract himself from spiralling down that dark road again. Instead, he tried desperately to focus on Hestia’s words as she addressed the class.
As the students parted and made their way to their respective rooms for the evening, Neville nudged Harry on the arm and asked, “There’s a bar on the first floor. Luna and I are going to check it out—you guys fancy joining us?”
“I don’t!” she raged. “I don’t even like Quidditch!”
Draco looked uncertainly at Harry. “You’re not going to tell anyone about this, are you?”
“This is weird, isn’t it?” he said quietly.
Hermione sat in the centre of the circular changing room on a worn, sagging pouffe with her preferred costume already draped across her lap. She gave Ron a once-over and frowned.
Harry felt a little silly pointing his pen at the feather, but everyone else in the class was too busy concentrating on their own feathers to pay him any attention, so he did as Draco instructed and imagined that he had his real wand in his hand. He tried to imagine the feeling of his magic pulsing through him like a heartbeat, slow and steady like his breaths, travelling down his arm and into the tip of his wand.
“I really don’t want to talk about it, Potter.”
Neville snorted with laughter at the shocked expression on Draco’s face. Although Harry knew Luna better than most, she still had the unique ability to leave him speechless from time to time. He and Draco looked uncertainly at one another before turning back to Luna, who continued to stare back at the pair. They had expected the topic of their not-so-secret relationship to come up at some point, but certainly not before they had even reached Hogwarts. Luna, however, was more intuitive than the average witch; knowing her, she probably knew what was going on between Harry and Draco before they did.
“Well,” Draco’s voice came out lower and huskier than he’d expected. “You’ve finally got me all to yourself. What now?”
“Not much,” he shrugged. “You just look like you could use some help painting...what is this even supposed to be, a tree?”
“I cannot deny that Salazar Slytherin was an...
“Were you even trying to keep me out of your head?” asked Draco. Harry stared daggers at him.
Checking his appearance in the mirror one last time, Harry smiled to himself, and for the first time in as long as he could remember, the smile was a genuine one. Not the fake one he’d had to plaster across his face when he met fans or spoke to government officials, but a real one. Because this was the happiest he’d felt in a very long time, and he knew that was largely thanks to one person in particular. Harry grabbed the Zorro costume and exited the changing room with a definite spring in his step. It seemed that, against all odds, this was shaping up to be his best year at Hogwarts ever.
“No, I think it is an inspired idea,” she countered. “Although I am uncertain if you will be able to enlist the students’ participation.”
Harry’s eyes widened with shock. “Charlie’s gay?”
“What’s she so cheerful about?” he wondered aloud.
“I’m being serious!” said Ron hotly, glaring in Theo’s direction. “Look at him sitting there with that smug look on his stupid face. Who does he think he is?”
“Auditions start today, don’t they?” asked Hestia, hopping off of the desk.
Harry shook his head and leant on the wall next to him. “I had a hunch you’d come here. Where’s Myrtle?”
But Harry shook his head. “He might not be able to speak but that doesn’t mean that he’ll listen to me.”
“What’s this for?” he asked, picking it up. Harry made another ball of gauze and tossed it across the ward. Draco watched as it arced through the air and landed inside the bedpan with a soft
Draco cocked an eyebrow at Harry. “You want to rehearse with me?”
“Found him in the Room of Requirement, as expected,” said Hestia, still in her Aragorn costume. She escorted Dennis towards one of the empty chairs and made him sit in it. “He thought that by instructing the room from barring entry to Slytherins that he wouldn’t get caught. Unlucky for you that I’m a fellow Gryffindor, eh?”
Harry spent the rest of the lesson practising wandless levitation on his own using the various objects from his school bag. While he was still a long way away from being able to do it non-verbally, he had progressed further than a lot of the other students. Hermione, of course, had mastered it in no time, as had Theo and Luna. It took Neville til near the end of the lesson before he managed to make his feather float and, predictably, Seamus only succeeded in making his explode.
“Why are you telling me this?” Liv asked nervously. Myra gave her a warm smile.
“Very mature of both of you,” said Hermione in a disapproving tone. Ron didn’t look entirely convinced by this explanation but dropped his interrogation as they reached the Muggle Studies classroom.
what’s bothering you.” She slid off of the cistern and hovered over to where Draco sat in one of the bathroom stalls, his head in his hands, looking miserable. She tried to give him a reassuring pat on the shoulder, but of course, her hand went straight through Draco. He shivered involuntarily at her icy cold touch but he didn’t complain. He appreciated the kind gesture.
“And who are you supposed to be?” Ron grumbled. Draco slung a small wooden bow over his shoulder and struck a pose.
Draco began slowly making his way back down the train, keeping his eyes peeled for an empty compartment but knowing that he wouldn’t find one. Every single compartment that he passed was full, except for one.
“But he’s in love with Hermione.”
“Bad,” Harry confirmed. “You want to take a look?”
“How are you getting on in there?” called Hermione.
“Just how bad is your eyesight?” asked Draco curiously.
That was all that they said on the matter as they fell into a comfortable silence. Draco understood why Harry liked to do this: it felt wonderful being able to escape from life, even if it was only for a little while.
“Okay, let’s see what we have here...directly ahead of us, we have primates, toilets are on the left and the Reptile House on the right—where to first?”
“Yes, I’m sure,” he replied irritably, brandishing the broom. “Have a go before I change my mind.”
Professor Switch sighed and addressed the whole class, “Please remember that the incantation is
“Are you planning on running away somewhere?”
“What scene will you be reading today?” asked Liv.
Neville nodded vigorously, “We spent a lot of time together over the summer and, I dunno, something just...sparked.”
Pansy bit her lip. “Well, I’m about as popular as you are at the moment. We’re still friends, but I need to choose my alliances carefully. You understand, yes?”
“Understandable.”
“I don’t want it advertised!” Harry snapped. “It’s bad enough having to perform this stupid play in front of the whole school, I don’t need the rest of the world knowing about it, too!”
“And what’s that?” Harry asked curiously. A satisfied smirk spread across Draco’s face.
“Well, homosexuality was only legalised fairly recently, for starters…”
“In a minute,” Draco replied distractedly, a small frown forming on his forehead. “I want to keep listening.”
“I might,” said Liv unconvincingly. “Well, maybe...I don’t know.”
“Ready.”
“I’m already the most unpopular person in the school, Potter, I doubt bringing you into the dungeons will do much more damage to my already sullied reputation,” Draco pointed out.
Harry grabbed Hannah by the shoulder and nodded to Draco. “What lady is that, which doth enrich the hand of yonder knight?”
The tension in Professor McGonagall’s stance immediately eased when she recognised Harry’s voice. “Ah, it’s you, Mr Potter. I didn’t recognise you in your costume.”
“Morning, Potter,” he smiled. “Your reflexes are a little rusty. I managed to sneak up on you without you noticing.”
“Of course!” Ron smirked. “Hermione’s missed your rock cakes.”
“Of course I’ve heard of it!” she shook her head in disbelief. “And I suppose you haven’t? Honestly, you purebloods are nothing but a bunch of uncultured swine…”
“My dad. He said that I should take the job at MACUSA: the money was better...and it was further away from the war.”
mused Minerva. Knowing what kind of monster Yaxley was like, that didn’t come as a surprise to her. She knew better than to ask Liv about the finer details of her imprisonment at the Ministry—it wasn’t her place to ask. Instead, she did what she often did in times of crisis and opened up the large tartan biscuit tin on her desk.
Severus rolled his eyes and slinked out of his portrait without another word. They still hadn’t gotten round to replacing the gargoyle that guarded the office after it got destroyed during the final battle. For the time being, they had resorted to placing an empty portrait by the office door and the former heads of Hogwarts took turns guarding the entrance—some more reluctantly than others.
Harry shrugged. “I figured that you didn’t want to talk to her about happened back there.” He chanced a glance at Draco before asking, “Do you want to talk about it?”
“Oh yeah, I forgot about that,” said Ginny quietly. “Rapport’s Law, or something…so, gay Muggles can’t get married, either?”
“If that is true, then it is a rather curious name for the group.”
Harry was fairly certain that Draco had been about to argue “that’s different”, but he stopped speaking abruptly and averted his gaze, looking a little embarrassed. Normally, Harry would have jumped at the chance to point out Draco’s hypocrisy but evidently, he had realised it himself. Harry cleared his throat and continued.
“I don’t want you to get the wrong impression of me,” Liv continued. “What they quoted me as saying in the article, they twisted my words: I merely confirmed that I had put my name forward for the position. I wouldn’t presume to think that I had gotten the job before seeing you about it personally.”
Draco smiled at him and nodded, “I quite agree. Shame that there’s no skin on display but it still suits you. What is the costume of? I just saw the sword and mask and thought it was what you were looking for.”
“I’m surprised that you were so excited about tonight,” he mused. “You must have been to Muggle parties before?”
Turning on her heel, she left a bemused Draco to figure out how to do just that on his own. Lucky for Draco that his Aunt Bellatrix had taught him some wandless magic the summer before his sixth year. He doubted that she ever expected him to use those skills to catch up on schoolwork, but then he never did care what his dearly departed aunt thought. Settling back into the soft pillows, he levitated the script in front of his face and was able to turn the pages with ease. It was difficult, however, to concentrate on learning his lines when Madam Pomfrey kept running back and forth across the ward with a giant butterfly net, trying to catch the elusive flock of birds. Eventually, the dishevelled matron succeeded in capturing them all, placing the last screeching canary inside a large gilded birdcage on her desk.
“Why didn’t you say anything?”
“I’ll go see if she’s ready to see you now,” he drawled before disappearing out of the left side of the frame. Harry chewed on his fingernail while he waited, but too soon for his liking, Snape stepped back into the frame looking miffed. “She’ll be ready for you in a moment.”
“She brought something for me?” asked Draco, sounding surprised.
“Everyone: his friends, his fans,” Draco lowered his eyes and mumbled, “My parents…”
Harry called after her but Luna had already slammed the door shut in his face, cutting him off mid-sentence. He watched with mounting horror as Luna wandered down the busy corridor, handing out posters to anyone who crossed her path. Sinking back into his seat, Neville gave him a sympathetic smile before pulling a deck of cards from his pocket.
Okay, maybe Harry had laboured on his point a bit too much.
Harry hesitated a minute before mumbling a quiet “Goodnight” and Draco listened as Harry’s bed creaked and he imagined Harry was turning to face the other direction. After that, all was silent. Draco lay awake thinking about his day, which had started out as bad as it could get yet had improved greatly as it had gone on, and with the most unlikely company to thank. He put today’s pleasant interaction with Harry down as a one-off, a mere anomaly. Come morning, everything would go back to normal: he and Harry would nag at each other and everyone would still hate him. Just as he was about to fall asleep, he felt something cold touch his cheek and he shivered. Opening his eyes he let out a startled gasp as large, translucent eyes stared down at him.
“Will she be able to make it back on her own?” asked Draco.
Draco held the mirror up to his face and said ‘Harry Potter’. The surface of the glass shimmered like someone had dropped a pebble in water and a moment later Harry’s smiling face appeared.
Well, at least he had found a seat.
Draco didn’t move immediately, sitting stock-still as though he hadn’t heard her. Slowly, he rose to his feet and carefully walked to the front of the classroom. His expression remained impassive but she noticed that his script was clutched tightly in his left hand. She felt a wave of sympathy for him then, standing alone in front of an entire classroom of stony-faced peers. Harry’s expression was especially grave, his face a storm of emotions as though he were undergoing some silent internal battle as he watched Draco fumble with the pages of his script to find his lines. Draco cleared his throat and opened his mouth to speak but paused and looked up as he heard the loud scraping of a chair. Harry walked quickly to the front of the class, script in hand, to stand by Draco’s side.
“That’s not what it was like! None of that would have been necessary if Umbridge hadn’t been here. Have you forgot all of the things that she did? She kicked out Professor Dumbledore,
Ron retreated back to his own bed, leaving Harry to mull over the events of the evening. Things had started out well enough; with Draco’s guidance, his Occlumency skills had improved greater than he ever could have hoped for. And although their sessions had been hard work, Harry had enjoyed Draco’s company. Perhaps he’d gotten a little carried away this evening; he wasn’t a flirty person by nature, but he and Draco had gotten into the habit of teasing each other. But based on Draco’s awkward reaction to Harry’s joke about the broomsticks, perhaps he’d pushed it too far. Everything really went downhill when Harry got overconfident and had challenged Draco not to hold back with the Legilimency spell. And then Draco had accessed that particular memory…
When Mrs Weasley didn’t call on him again, Harry relaxed against the rough bark of the tree. He took off his trainers and socks and wiggled his toes into the cool grass and soil, enjoying the blades of grass tickling the bottom of his hot feet. It was a pleasant sensation and something that he had always enjoyed doing as a child, although heaven forbid his Aunt Petunia ever caught him doing it; getting grass stains on her peach carpet would have earned him at least a week in the cupboard. Not that he had to worry about that anymore, he supposed. He doubted the Dursleys spared a thought for him and he didn’t care much to think of them either.
Harry, Ron and Neville shuffled to the front of the classroom looking extremely nervous. Everyone’s eyes were fixed intently on the anxious trio, curious to see if they would sink or swim at the task.
When the reporters had owled her for comment on the article that they were writing, she had let her anger get the better of her and had ignored them.
Ginny had waited patiently for the Galleon to drop. After a few more moments contemplating these words, Harry’s eyes had widened with shock at the sudden realisation at what Ginny was suggesting.
“Stop gawking at Malfoy and help me get the luggage on board the train,” she instructed. Harry rubbed his ribs and glared at her.
“Uh, sure,” said Harry uncertainly, rubbing the back of his neck. “I mean, it’s just acting, right?”
“What?” asked Draco innocently.
Harry grinned and rested his hands on Draco’s hips. He was always happy to seize opportunities like this as they arose, and if he and Draco happened to find themselves alone for a few precious minutes, he’d be foolish
Draco stiffened at the sound of Harry’s voice. When he caught sight of Harry’s reflection in the mirror, his light grey eyes momentarily widened with panic before he quickly schooled his expression into its usual sneer.
“Why?” Harry pressed on. The frown on Draco’s face deepened.
“Let’s start from the beginning,” he suggested, hoping to steer the conversation away from himself and Draco. “Is the day so young?”
“We’re not looking for Draco, we’re here to see you,” said Harry. “This is Luna. She’s in Ravenclaw like you were.”
Would Ginny tell Theo? he wondered. Harry was adamant that she could be trusted, but then Draco had always thought Harry, by his very nature, was too trusting.
“That’s alright,” Harry shrugged. “I didn’t really buy this, it’s just something that I thought would come in handy over the holidays.”
. Murdered. In this school, by god only knows who, and his only crime was being Muggle-born.”
A collective groan rumbled through the office and Professor Sprout massaged her temples in frustration. Harry sat silently, keeping himself as small and invisible as possible, as the boys' Heads of House decided their punishment: detention until Christmas and one hundred points deducted each from Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff. Professor McGonagall gave them a few harsh parting words about their reckless behaviour before sending them on their way. Once the boys had exited with Professors Sprout and Flitwick in their wake, Professor McGonagall turned in her tartan wingback armchair to speak to Professor Snape, who had returned to his portrait above her desk.
Draco gave a derisive laugh. “Alright, since we’re being frank with each other...no, I don’t have a problem with your class. I just don’t care about it.”
“I expect you’ll be putting yourself forward for the starring role in the play, eh Potter?” drawled Draco, stepping up beside Harry. “You can’t resist the temptation to be the centre of attention at any given opportunity.”
“Could’ve fooled me,” Draco drawled. “Weren’t you the one who decided that taking the train wasn’t exciting enough and flew a car into the Whomping Willow? I’m surprised you didn’t hijack the carriage and ride it through the middle of the feast.”
Mercifully, his death had been a ruse on Potter’s part. In the ensuing chaos, Minerva was caught up in a whirlwind of bodies and screaming and fighting. Then, just as suddenly, in what seemed like the blink of an eye, Voldemort was dead, the Battle was won and the war was over. She hadn’t even had time to catch her breath when the monumental task of repairing the school and everyone’s lives had begun. In truth, busying herself with her work had served as an excellent distraction from dealing with her own feelings.
“In the pipes somewhere.” Draco bowed his head in shame before admitting, “She knew that there was something up with me but when she tried to ask me about it, I lost my temper. I think I hurt her feelings.”
Liv thought for a moment then nodded. “Yes, I suppose it has. There have been many more instances of Muggles coming into contact with the Wizarding community. Arnold says their office has been run ragged lately with the number of Obliviations that they’ve had to perform.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Yes, I suppose you did say that.”
After rinsing out his mouth, Harry flopped onto the bottom of the bed at Draco’s feet. “What are your plans for the holidays?”
Harry scrambled off of Draco’s bed and back into his own while Madam Pomfrey sat a small cage with three angry canaries on one of the unoccupied beds before drawing her wand and, with the flick of her wrist, vanishing the mess that they had made.
Umbridge grinned. “Excellent! I look forward to working with you, Miss Tonks, you came highly recommended.” Umbridge turned on her heel and strode towards the exit. Pausing at the door she turned to Liv and said, “Be sure to get those records to me as soon as possible. And congratulations on your promotion.”
“I…” Harry stammered. “I’m sorry, I panicked—”
“Bathroom,” he lied, stuffing a sandwich into his mouth so that he could avoid further interrogation. Ron seemed satisfied with this explanation and let the matter drop.
Ginny screwed her nose up in disgust. “I know my dad thinks Muggles are fascinating but the more I learn about them, the more I dislike them.”
“Hi Dennis,” Harry greeted him carefully. “How was your summer?”
“What about it?”
Harry rested his hands on top of Draco’s and replied, “I’m going to miss you, too.”
“Swearing at a member of staff normally guarantees you a lot worse than one night of detention with me,” she replied coolly. “You got a free pass the last time but I can’t let your bad language slide. Be here at six o’clock sharp. That’ll be all.”
A pleased grin spread across Harry’s face. “Before we got together, you mean?”
“Saints do not move,” said Draco quietly, his eyes fixed on Harry’s lips, “though grant for prayers’ sake.”
Harry mentally berated himself for finding a strange kind of comfort in that—his and Draco’s sparring sessions were never pleasant, but there was a familiarity to them that Harry desperately craved. He and Draco hating each other was perfectly normal and what did he want, if not normality?
“Does it really need to have our faces on it?”
the Nargle?”
“The fearful passage of their death-marked love and the continuance of their parents’ rage—which, but their children’s end—nought could remove, is now the two hours’ traffic of our stage.” He turned dramatically towards the audience again before sinking into a low bow. “The which, if you with patient ears attend, what here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.”
While professors enforced a zero-tolerance policy for bullying, outside of the classroom, they were seen as fair game. Jack Sloper, Susan Bones, and the other members of the group were ostracised from their respective houses, and had to contend with the other students glaring and openly booing them as they passed. They also found themselves subject to many of the same pranks that they had subjected the Slytherin students to in previous weeks, and poor Madam Pomfrey was inundated with students turning into canaries again. Harry knew all too well what that felt like, too, although he had little sympathy for their self-inflicted situation.
Harry had just begun unbuttoning the buttons of Draco’s shirt when, suddenly, Asha’s furry white head popped out of the top of the shirt collar. Draco yelped in fright as the ferret crawled on top of his shoulder before he tore off his robes and tossed them unceremoniously onto the floor.
“Good morning, everyone!” she greeted them brightly. “Did you have a nice weekend?”
Merlin, first Ron and Hermione, now Neville and Luna? Harry couldn’t help but feel a little jealous of his friends’ happiness. Not that they didn’t deserve it, but only because that elusive spark that Neville spoke about was something that he’d never felt himself. Still, he was happy for his friends, so pushing aside his musings about his own lacklustre love life, he smiled at Neville and patted him on the shoulder.
“I know.” Goyle bowed his head and shuffled awkwardly between each foot. “Even though we attacked you, you still saved me and Malfoy. If you and Granger hadn’t helped us, we would have died, too. So, I just wanted to say thank you and...I owe you one.”
Draco set to work then, licking Harry slowly, alternating between lapping at and flicking the smooth skin with the tip of his tongue. Harry’s moans were muffled by the pillow and Draco had to tighten his grip on Harry’s arsecheeks as his hips began to lurch backwards and forward, pressing more insistently against Draco’s mouth, fucking himself with Draco’s tongue.
It wasn’t long before Harry was panting, precum leaking from his cock onto his stomach. Draco decided to switch things up and began teasing the right nipple with the edge of his teeth before lapping it with the flat of his tongue, rolling the left one between his fingers and pinching it, making Harry’s back arch off of the bed again. Draco paused in his ministrations to watch Harry slide his hand down his body to touch himself, but before Harry grabbed his cock, he stopped—clearly, he had a better idea. Pressing the index and middle fingers of his left hand to Draco’s lips, Draco took them into his mouth and groaned as he sucked on the digits in much the same way that he would suck Harry’s cock. When his fingers were good and wet, Harry pulled them from Draco’s mouth, spread his legs further apart and pressed them against his hole.
“Malfoy,” he called, skidding to a stop by his side. “Malfoy, what happened?”
“You did,” Harry chuckled. “I don’t think I’ve ever heard you say sorry before, to anyone or for anything. Ever.”
“Alright. What about you, Harry?” she asked. “Where do you want to go?”
Ginny looked as though she was ready to give up the search when her gaze paused at the tree Harry was sitting under and her eyes narrowed. Harry’s heart missed a beat. Surely she couldn’t see him?
“Wouldn’t it be quicker if we just Apparated?” Harry asked.
“Harry wanted to tell you about him and me, but I asked him not to. In part because I’m afraid of what my parents will say when they find out, but the main reason I didn’t want him to tell you is because I knew that you would react badly. And I...I’m afraid that if you ask him to choose between your friendship and being with me, he’ll choose you. We both know what choice he’ll make.”
“I thought you were amazing,” Ron crooned, throwing his arm around Hermione’s shoulder and smacking a kiss to her temple. “Professor Tonks would be mental not to cast you as Juliet.”
Harry looked over to where Pansy was sitting on the other side of the classroom and, sure enough, she was wearing large Ray-Bans that completely covered her eyes. He also noticed that rather than changing her hair colour, her normally poker straight hair was now styled in a tight perm which she was admiring from all angles in her mirror.
Several students grumbled under their breath and avoided her gaze. Liv wasn’t surprised to see that a few of them looked nervous: they’d spent years learning spellwork and potion-making, but acting was well outwith their comfort zone. Poor Hermione, normally so confident and prepared, had a slight green tinge to her complexion and Neville was sweating profusely.
“Well, he isn’t going to hear anything from you if you just sit here staring at him.”
“Are you going to arrest me now, Sheriff?” he joked.
“Yes, that makes me feel much better,” he admitted. “Don’t get me wrong, it’s not that I don’t appreciate it. It’s just...I’m used to doing things on my own. It’s been a long time since anyone helped me. So, you know...”
“No. Just...unexpected.” Draco thought for a moment before deciding that he wanted to put his arm around Harry’s shoulder. He smiled to himself as he felt the tension in Harry’s body ease again. This, as with everything that involved Harry, was unexpectedly nice. The few dalliances he’d had in the past (which consisted of hooking up with one of the boys from Beauxbatons and an ill-advised evening with Cassius Warrington a couple of summers back) had been short, intense and ultimately impersonal experiences. Nobody had ever wanted to cuddle him afterwards. Draco thought that he wouldn’t like it—he wasn’t the most overtly affectionate person at the best of times—but feeling Harry’s warm body pressed against his own, his annoyingly wild hair tickling his cheek, Draco thought it felt...good. Enjoyable, even.
“We can’t,” said Hermione. “We’ve got too much homework to do.”
“No, I’m almost done…”
“‘Enjoy’ is a strong word,” Harry joked. He glanced at his watch and sighed. “I better head back to the castle. Ron and Hermione will be wondering where I am.”
“Very good. Now, if you’ll both excuse me, I need to go and track down my other patients. I won’t be long.”
“Guess!”
“Sometimes being such close friends with someone can be a scary thing. It’s difficult allowing yourself to be that...
“When?”
“Yup,” said Hestia brightly. “Fingers crossed I last more than a year, eh?”
“I can’t, I’m going down to Hagrid’s for a visit.” Disappointment flashed across Draco’s face, so he added quickly, “But I’m free in the afternoon if you’re not doing anything?”
Ron and Hermione hurried ahead, promising to meet Harry back in the Gryffindor common room later on. Harry walked slowly in the direction of the castle entrance, but as the Quidditch Stadium came into view, he paused. Checking his watch, he noted that there was still another hour to lunch—plenty of time to have a look around the pitch before meeting Draco for some remedial Occlumency lessons. Marching down the steep grassy slope, the blustery breeze whipped his hair about his face, cooling his clammy skin. Today would be perfect flying weather—if he had a broomstick.
Harry took a quick step back as Myrtle’s opaque head appeared through the door, giving her the appearance of a macabre wall mount.
“Sorry about that, mate,” he said cheerfully. “I’ll try and remember next time!”
“He did
“Yes,” Draco mumbled, his voice barely audible. “I don’t know why I told you that. I shouldn’t have told you that...”
“No sign of them?” he asked quietly.
“Correct me if I’m wrong, but that doesn’t look like the script that Professor Tonks gave us to revise,” she said accusingly.
“Give me a minute!” Harry snapped. Draco tsked and rolled his eyes.
“Here we go,” Snape sighed.
“Such a dirty mouth,” Draco said praisingly as he began pistoning his hips back and forth, knocking short, sharp gasps from Harry. His eyes trailed down Harry’s body and he marveled at the sight of him—mouth slack with pleasure, writhing and moaning freely now as Draco pounded his greedy, hungry hole—he’d never seen anything more erotic and beautiful in his life. Harry’s cock, red and hard, was weeping precum all over his stomach. Draco could tell that he was close now, only a few more thrusts is all it would take.
“What sort of punishment do you think Professor Tonks has lined up for Dennis when he comes back?” Hermione wondered aloud. “She doesn’t seem the mean-spirited type like Snape was.”
“So, I’ve read over the scene a couple of times and from what I can gather, I gatecrash the Capulet party hoping to see Rosaline, but when I see you—well, when Romeo sees Juliet—I...
“I know we have, but…Ginny, you know that I love you,” he pleaded.
were the one who decided that we weren’t friends anymore. Now that you’re regretting your decision, you think that you can crawl over here and act as though nothing happened? Well, think again. I’d rather have no friends than bad ones.”
“Urgh, yes,” Harry groaned. “Apparently, she and Ron heard us last night.”
“How can you be sure that it’s Professor Switch?” asked Neville uncertainly. Hermione hoisted her bag onto her shoulder and grabbed the door handle.
“This’ll give us more privacy than a bush,” said Harry, turning to face Draco.
Harry snorted. “I’d rather you didn’t!”
“You don’t think it’s a tad inappropriate for Harry to walk about Hogwarts with a bare chest?” said Hermione.
Goyle lowered his hand a little and gnashed his teeth as though he were in a great deal of discomfort. Pansy gave him an encouraging elbow in the ribs and with a reluctant sigh, he spoke up.
“Me too,” said Harry. He hesitated a moment before suggesting, “Well...since we’re both reading the same scene, wouldn’t it make more sense if we rehearsed together?”
“I was just wondering if you and Draco are still seeing each other in secret, or are we allowed to talk about it now?”
Harry felt the back of his neck prickle with heat but he asked as casually as possible, “What do you mean?”
“Don’t try to butter me up, Headmistress. It is unbecoming of your position,” he protested, although he looked pleased at the compliment.
The young boy vanished from view as the spotlight fell and the audience erupted into uproarious applause, hundreds of eyes struggling to follow the dark outline of his shadow as he strode across the dimmed stage and out of sight, which was still glowing an ominous emerald green and ruby red.
“Only if you do,” Harry replied quickly.
“Oh my god…” Harry whimpered. His skin erupted in goosebumps as Draco slipped his hand under his shirt and dragged his nails across Harry’s bare flesh, brushing the tips of his fingers across his sensitive nipples. Harry gasped as Draco took his right nipple between his index finger and thumb and gave it a light squeeze. Harry’s breathing was quicker now, heavier, louder. He was so caught up with the feeling of his impending orgasm he had completely forgotten where they were and who might be listening.
“Shut up!” he snapped.
“I did,” said Draco quietly. Unable to look at Harry or face his own reflection in the mirror, he kept his eyes fixed on the floor. “Not many people can take credit for starting a war, can they? I expect it’ll be written on my tombstone.”
“I didn’t think that they were going to hang out for as long as they did,” said Harry quietly enough so that Madam Pomfrey couldn’t hear him from her office. Draco frowned.
Liv nodded vigorously. “Oh yes, they perform very well together. All the students do.”
“If the shoe were on the other foot, there’s no way I’d have passed up the opportunity to humiliate me.”
Ron shrugged. “Honestly, I don’t know. I’m not going to change my mind about him based on one handshake...but you’re the smartest person that I know, so I’d be pretty stupid not to listen to you.” He kissed her on the cheek and whispered, “You’re a better person than I ever could be, Mione. You’re always trying to see the good in people. Even if it isn’t there.”
At the end of the lesson, everyone made quick work packing up their belongings and heading to the Great Hall for lunch. Draco didn’t even bother to wait until all the students had left the class before he marched up to Liv and slammed the script onto her desk.
Hermione sighed. “No, I’m not angry. I feel a bit sad that you didn’t tell me about you and Malfoy, but I assume that you had your reasons.”
“I still hate you,” Ron reminded him. “You do know that?”
“She’ll be fine,” Harry assured. “She reminds me of Neville’s toad; he likes to go out exploring on his own, too. Fancy going for another fly about the stadium?”
“This is a hospital, not a frat house!” she fumed, pocketing her wand. “Either you both behave in a civil manner or I will enforce lights out before supper. Is that clear?”
“No.”
“Romeo and Juliet are from wealthy and noble families, the Montagues and the Capulets. They both attend a masquerade ball and when Romeo sees Juliet for the first time, he instantly falls in love with her, and she with him. But here’s the problem—their families are sworn enemies! But they’re so in love that they don’t care about that, so they get decide to get married in secret...”
“If you think Myron Wagtail’s hot, wait ‘til you see Stephen Gately,” Harry smirked. “Unless you prefer blonds?”
“Draco?”
On Sunday morning, Harry, Ron and Hermione visited Hagrid and “enjoyed” a plateful of rock cakes while filling each other in on what they’d been up to over the holidays. Hagrid had spent most of the summer months helping Professor McGonagall and the other staff members repair the school. Unfortunately, he still hadn’t got around to fixing his old hut which had been destroyed during the battle, so he was temporarily living in a tent on the edge of the construction site where his new home would be built.
Harry waved Myrtle off and watched her drift away, taking care to avoid walking straight through any of the students. He suspected that the real reason that Myrtle had attended the party was to see Draco, but he was glad that he’d crossed paths with her first. Trying to take his own mind off of Draco for the time being, Harry decided that he would have some of that punch after all. He weaved his way through the crowd towards the buffet table pouring himself a ladleful of ruby red liquid into his goblet. Just as he was about to take a drink, he paused when a familiar voice whispered in his ear.
Liv frowned. “I’m not sure what you mean.”
“Asha!” Harry groaned, scooping the mischievous mustelid into his hands. “What are you playing at?” Asha squeaked in greeting and looked up expectantly at him. Harry sighed and removed a small biscuit from his pocket and gave it to her. “There. Happy now?”
you were—all your life, and then the next thing you’re thrown in at the deep end and expected to swim!” Draco shook his head in disbelief. “To be denied the truth of your heritage, and for what?”
Minerva scrutinised the papers for a few moments, but she had already made up her mind. She looked up at Liv and extended her hand across the table. Liv broke out into a wide grin and shook the proffered hand.
“No need to thank me,” she assured him with a warm smile. “It’s my job to take care for all of the students at Hogwarts, including the more accident-prone ones like yourself and Mr Longbottom. But please, try to be more careful in future. As pleasant as your company is, I’d rather not see you here so often.”
“Then count me in!” Ron declared cheerfully. Hermione beamed at him.
Harry grimaced. “Seriously? How long have they been here?”
While Liv focused on pulling a noteworthy performance from Pansy and Goyle, backstage was a flurry of activity. Several students were pouring over their lines, some trying to memorise them by practising in small groups while others, like Draco, preferred to sit alone and read in silence. Ron and Theo were busy trying to coordinate their upcoming fight scene while Luna and Neville—now sporting matching cowboy hats—sat and sketched out ideas for set pieces that they needed to build. It seemed that despite their initial reluctance to take part, all of the students were now taking the play seriously and seemed determined to do a good job at whatever task they had been assigned.
Draco’s stomach twisted with guilt. “It’s not that I don’t want to say that you’re my boyfriend. You know what it’s like with my parents—”
“What’s the point of having a sword if you’re not going to use it?” she pouted, swinging the rapier through the air, narrowly missing Goyle’s head.
Liv quieted as she watched the memory-version of herself spin around on her chair to face the cabinets behind her and proceed to rifle through one of them. After a bit of searching, she pulled out two files, one bearing the name Dirk Cresswell and the other, Edward Tonks. She slipped the files into her handbag before proceeding to trawl through the other cabinets in search of the files that Yaxley had asked for.
Checking the time on his pocket watch, he grimaced. They were still hours away from reaching Hogwarts and he didn’t fancy standing out in the corridor like a pleb for the remainder of the journey. After walking the full length of the train and confirming that there was nowhere else for him to sit, Draco had no choice but to slip into one of the unoccupied toilets. Locking the door behind him, he flipped the lid down and sat on the toilet, looking around with bemusement at the small, windowless room where he would spend the remainder of his journey.
Theo cleared his throat and bowed his head, unable to meet Draco’s eye. “Ginny and I have been talking…”
“No,” she sighed. “I got the gist of things from reading it the first time.”
“Yup,” Harry replied brightly.
“Of course, it does. You and Draco are the title characters.”
Three polite chaps at the wooden door signalled the arrival of her guest and Minerva opened her mouth to call out to her, but Albus spoke first.
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Fake memories, Ron. I seriously doubt that Zabini only thinks about personal grooming. It’s a clever tactic on his part: if you can’t block someone out of your head, you can throw them off by showing them a false memory.”
“I’m fine,” Liv assured her, wincing as she tried to put pressure on her wrist. She inspected the damage and while, thankfully, it appeared as though no bones were broken, she had taken the skin clean off the palm of her hand. “Oh, bugger…”
“I figured we’d need somewhere bigger than my classroom to rehearse the play,” said Liv, stepping into the room. Harry followed close behind and couldn’t help but smile at the sight before him. The last time he had been here, the entire room had been aflame. It had been one of the scariest moments of his life, and he had been certain that he and his friends were going to die just as Crabbe had. But against all odds, they had found some old broomsticks and made it out of there alive. Now, the flames were but a distant memory, the fear extinguished as Harry stepped out of the corridor at Hogwarts and into a magnificent theatre.
“That’s a big ask,” he joked. Smirking at the increasingly irritated expression on Draco’s face, he held up his hands in mock-surrender. “Okay, I’m shutting up now.”
“Does that mean Quidditch matches are back on?” cried a student from the Hufflepuff table.
"Don't go quoting Shakespeare at me," he warned.
“Yes?” he asked.
As the students filed out of the Great Hall to attend their first lessons of the day, many of them were chatting excitedly about the party, already brainstorming ideas for costumes.
Draco smiled sheepishly and averted his gaze. Myrtle gasped and swooped towards him until she was only inches from his face, trying to catch his eye. “Did you kiss him?”
“Force of habit,” said Draco mildly. “Now, the key to mastering elementary Occlumency is learning to clear your mind of thoughts and emotions.”
“We rehearsed while we played cards,” he countered, glad that he had the magazine to cover his atrocious poker face.
“She won’t bite you,” said Harry gently. “I promise. Go on, give it a go.”
“I better get down there before they kill each other,” he sighed.
Uncertainty flickered across Dennis’s face but he quickly smothered it with a frown. “You and I are nothing alike.”
“Well, thank Merlin for that,” said Draco sarcastically.
“I take a firm hold of my hard cock and imagine that you’re on top of me, sinking your tight little hole onto my cock,” he purred. “Would you like that?”
“Don’t think I haven’t noticed how distant you’ve been the last few weeks,” she accused. Harry grunted.
“I figured that your parents might get suspicious if owls are flying back and forth over the holidays, and if I can’t be with you over Christmas, at least we can still see each other… sort of.” Harry looked expectantly at Draco. “So, what do you think?”
“If we can refrain from ribbing each other for more than a few seconds…”
Harry pulled a face. “Lucius hates me, why the hell would he ask his son to befriend me?”
“Why are you being so bloody stubborn about this?”
They headed for the Reptile House next, partly because Draco wanted to look at the snakes but more so to get out of the cold for a while. The humid interior was a welcome relief but it immediately steamed up Harry’s glasses, much to Draco’s amusement. Once Harry regained his vision, they slowly worked their way between each of the windows, admiring snakes and lizards of every size and colour imaginable. They came to a stop at one of the glass windows which housed an enormous boa constrictor almost identical to the one that he’d conversed with as a child. That snake in question, of course, was long gone, and this one seemed more interested in climbing a thick branch than talking to Harry. He leant against the barrier and watched the snake’s slow, considered movements with interest.
“Yes, I think I will join you,” Draco accepted politely. Harry smiled and turned to Ron.
“I didn’t find out until my eleventh birthday.”
Snape let out a weary sigh. “So I’ve been told: you were a consistent troublemaker who believed that the rules did not apply to him. It seems that little has changed.”
Harry paused eating his breakfast and Ginny choked on her orange juice. While Hermione patted Ginny gingerly on the back, Ron looked perplexed at the exchange between Draco and his sister.
Harry didn’t have time to worry about his friends’ reaction to the kiss as they spent the next couple of hours rehearsing intensively. When the lesson concluded for the day and everyone began to file out of the room, Liv asked him and Draco to stay behind so that she could have “a word” with them about their performance. Harry’s panic spiked when Hermione also chose to stay behind, lingering by Liv’s side, clutching her notes closely to her chest. Had he and Draco given themselves away?
“For the love of god, will you shut up already about being attacked?” Harry hissed. “A ferret ran up your trouser leg, get over it.”
Harry peered into the classroom again and shrugged. “Looks nothing like the picture on the book cover.”
. Travelling up and down the country, scared to even use magic in case the Snatchers found us. But the whole time, Colin believed that Harry Potter would save the day. He never wavered in his belief, not for one second.”
“Yeah, I want to talk to you about that,” Draco cut in. He glanced over Harry’s shoulder, down the corridor, and back to Harry again. “It’ll only take a minute…”
Dennis bowed his head and avoided looking at the Headmistress. It seemed that all of the fight had gone out of him. Harry thought that he looked so exhausted that if the world swallowed him whole, he wouldn’t even have the strength to fight back. If anything, he’d welcome it.
Draco rolled his eyes but bit his tongue. He was still angry with his mother for enrolling him in Hogwarts this year without consulting him. Draco had never argued with his parents before—he’d never had reason to fight with his mother and he had always been too afraid to confront his father about anything—but when Narcissa had told him about her correspondence with McGonagall, he had been furious. The argument that followed had been unpleasant: Draco accused his mother of meddling in his affairs and trying to control his life even though he wasn’t a child anymore. It was then that his father had stepped in and informed his son that so long as he lived under their roof, he would do as he was told. With no counter-argument and nowhere else to go, Draco had retreated to his room where he had remained for the duration of the summer holidays, pointedly ignoring his parents as much as he could.
On the first morning of the new term, Liv Tonks sat at her classroom desk feeling excited and anxious in equal measures. Afraid that she would somehow be late for her first ever lesson as a Hogwarts professor, she had left her quarters an hour before the class was due to begin. She missed breakfast in the Great Hall, although her stomach was churning so badly with nerves she wouldn’t have been able to eat anyway. In the ten minutes that had passed since Liv had arrived in her classroom, she had already triple-checked that she hadn’t forgotten any of the books and notes that she needed. As the clock overhead ticked loudly, she proceeded to rearrange the items on her desk, first adjusting the angle of a framed photograph of herself and her dad a little to the left, then moving it back again a moment later. She shuffled her notes again and sat them carefully at the centre of her desk, desperate to keep her hands busy as her mind raced.
“Something that is easy for your attention to rest on,” he explained. “Something which brings pleasant emotions without too much excitement or boredom. Sometimes it’s easier to picture something that is meaningful to you, but try not to get distracted by its associations; the goal is to focus on the object itself.”
“Sounds like someone’s having fun.” Draco cast a flirtatious glance at Harry. “Fancy taking a tumble in the bushes with me?”
“I thought it would be fun just to have a year where we got to piss about,” he admitted. “Plus, Harry said he was coming back and I wanted to keep him company. Oh, and you, of course...”
“Oh, I don’t know,” she replied sarcastically. “Maybe it has something to do with you three breaking in and stealing treasure and a great bloody dragon from them?”
Armed with a tuna sandwich in one hand, Harry grudgingly pulled his Herbology textbook towards him with the other, wondering why he had been in such a rush to get back here. He found himself staring longingly out of the window, wishing that he’d stayed outside a little longer, when he spotted a small figure on a broomstick hovering above the pitch. Harry felt that familiar fluttering sensation growing in the pit of his stomach as he watched Draco fly through the sky with the ease and grace of a bird. Tearing his eyes away, he turned back to his homework, his head firmly in the clouds with Draco.
Gladrags Wizardwear had been a prominent fixture on Hogsmeade’s high street since its grand opening more than two hundred and forty years prior. In that time, they had built a reputation for providing high-quality, stylish clothing, and a determination to fulfil the needs of every witch and wizard that passed through their doors. They had a steady stream of customers and loyal clientele, but today their Hogsmeade branch was unusually busy. On this particular Sunday afternoon, the shop was packed with excitable students looking for the perfect costume for the upcoming Halloween party.
Harry had visited the apple orchard several times over the years, usually to play Quidditch with the Weasleys, but this summer, it had been his little oasis away from the rest of the world, a peaceful place where he didn’t need to think or worry about anything, where he could simply be. Granted, those peaceful moments had been few and far between in the four months since the war had ended, but right now he was enjoying a rare, blissful moment of solitude.
“Where have you lot been?” asked Neville curiously. “We’ve almost reached Hogsmeade, Harry and I were beginning to wonder if you’d come back.”
“Y-you have?” he asked, sounding surprised.
“It is a little bit,” he argued, grinning broadly. “And if you
“Thank you, Severus. You can send her up now.”
“No, I didn’t,” Liv admitted quietly.
Draco didn’t linger. Liv had instructed all of the students to meet her and Professor Hestia Jones outside the main entrance of Kings Cross Station in front of the Christmas tree. He’d leave Harry to catch up with Mrs Weasley and meet him outside. Lifting one end of his trunk, he began wheeling it towards the exit to stand with...who, exactly? Theo and the other Slytherins still weren’t talking to him, and the Gryffindors only tolerated him because of Harry.
“They’d be fine,” Harry reassured him. “Honestly, they would. And...if you don’t want to visit me as my boyfriend, we can just say you’re there as a friend.”
“And tell her what?” Draco snapped, glaring at Harry’s reflection in the mirror. “We both know that she’d be as glad to see the back of me as the rest of them. She’d probably award the culprits for services to the school.”
Hestia nodded approving. “Very good. Any shortcomings?”
“Uneventful,” Ron shrugged. “Mind you, the kids that got sorted into Slytherin didn’t look too happy about it.”
“What does it matter who else I’m helping? That’s not the point, I—urgh…” she spluttered. “This is serious, Ted. If you don’t do this, they will come for you. They’ll send you to Azkaban...or worse. Stop being an idiot and just let me change the papers for you!”
Of course, sneaking around the school snogging his secret beau wasn’t without its risks. There had been a couple of close calls when Harry and Draco had almost been caught in the act; one evening, after sneaking away from their study group, they had found a dark, seldom-visited corner of the library for themselves, thinking surely nobody was likely to stumble upon them in the Muggle poetry section. Typically, they had been interrupted mid-kiss when they heard approaching footsteps and barely threw the Invisibility Cloak over their heads in time when Madam Pince came into view, replacing books on the dusty shelves before moving on a few moments later.
“Really?” he asked. “I thought it was forbidden to bring non-Slytherins to your dungeons.”
Harry grinned and eagerly kissed Draco. Breakfast would have to wait while he sated his appetite.
Liv’s eyes widened with shock and she shoved the radio away from her as though it had stung her. It clattered to the floor with a loud bang, cutting Lee off mid-sentence. Liv clung to the vanity table for support, gasping for air, unable to catch her breath. She had turned deathly pale and Minerva worried that she might faint from the shock. Suddenly, the mirror on the vanity table cracked and Liv burst into tears, her head buried into her hands as she wailed like a wounded animal, her grief spilling out of her. Minerva cast a wary glance at the woman standing beside her; it couldn’t be easy for her to relive this moment, particularly when the events had transpired only a few months prior.
“I know you said that,” said Draco quietly. “But I’m still surprised. I thought Weasley would...well, I thought he’d be more resistant to the idea. Try to talk some sense into you or something.”
Liv nodded solemnly. “Yes, war and love don’t mix very well.”
“It’s not harmless fun when they’re smashing up Myrtle’s bathroom and sending threats to students!” said Harry hotly.
Dennis hesitated a few moments before getting to his feet and emptying the contents of his pockets onto the Headmistress's desk: he tossed a plastic Guy Fawkes mask, a silver hip flask—the same one Harry had seen Dennis use earlier in the evening—his wand, a folded piece of parchment, and a polaroid onto the table before slumping back into his seat. He maintained his defiant look as Professor McGonagall picked up the mask and turned it over in her hand while Hestia unscrewed the hip flask’s metal lid and sniffed the contents.
In the few weeks since term had started, Liv had quickly fallen into a routine: she would get up early on Saturday morning but instead of having breakfast in the Great Hall with everyone else, she would go to Madam Puddifoot’s for tea and crumpets. Sometimes, Professor Slughorn would accompany her when the weather was fair, but he had declined her invitation today when he had looked out of the window of his living quarters and saw how windy it was. She would then pop over to the post office and send a letter to Andromeda, asking how Teddy was keeping and sometimes sending him little gifts like children’s books and clothing. She would then head to her favourite shop in the whole village, Tomes and Scrolls, to find new books to add to her ever-growing collection.
“Hermione was ready to send out a search party for you,” Ron joked.
The heavy oak door creaked open and a pretty woman with a pale, heart-shaped face popped her head into the office. Her dark, twinkling eyes scanned the room and her face broke into a big smile when she saw Minerva.
“Argh, bollocks to this!” he cried, kicking one of the desks in frustration. “Why can’t I get this right?”
to stumble across me in a bush with my boyfriend? I find that highly unlikely!”
“Exploding Snap?” he offered.
While Ron and Hermione continued to bicker with each other (as was part of their morning routine), Draco watched on with mild amusement at the argument that he had helped to instigate. Harry had learned over the years to tune them out when they were like this, focusing on downing his coffee and gathering his belongings before heading to Muggle Studies. While Harry wasn’t revelling in the depressing atmosphere like Myrtle was, he wasn’t feeling particularly miserable himself. He was, in fact, the happiest he’d been in his entire life. He did feel a tad guilty about it considering how poorly everyone else was faring, but it was difficult not to be happy: currently, and as far as he was aware, nobody was trying to kill him (this was a novelty that wasn’t likely to wear off anytime soon). And while his lessons weren’t outstanding (by his own admission, he’d never been particularly studious) he wasn’t doing poorly in any of his subjects, either. Even his Defence Against the Dark Arts lessons were going well; Hestia had praised him on how far he’d come with his Occlumency, thanks in no small part to Draco. And therein lay the main source of Harry’s happiness—by far the most unexpected source considering how things stood between them only a few short months ago. Things were far from perfect, of course, but then real life never was. For the time being, at least, things seemed to be going his way for a change and Harry was content to go with the flow.
On the front page of her father’s infamous magazine was the poster Luna had designed for the upcoming performance of
The image of Draco lying sprawled in a pool of his own blood flashed through Harry’s mind. He instinctively clenched his eyes shut as though that would shield the shameful memory from his mind’s eye, but of course, doing this only gave it greater clarity. Yes, Harry knew all too well what it was like to use magic out of anger. It brought out the worst in him—in all of them. While Dennis’s actions and those in Potter’s Army (Harry cringed at the thought of them using his name) were understandable, it didn’t make them right. Lashing out and hurting others when you’re hurting didn’t achieve anything. They’d only succeeded in humiliating the entire student body and, most likely, turned everyone against their ‘cause’. Although, from what Harry could tell, he doubted Dennis would care about that.
“August second, 1997,” Liv continued. “Earlier that morning, I’d received an owl from my cousin, Ted, telling me that Minister Scrimgeour had been murdered the previous evening and that the Ministry had fallen.”
he told himself.
Enjoy this chapter and I'll post a new one very soon :)
“Well, apart from the fact that lions are native to the African continent and I think it’s highly unlikely one wandered off of the Savannah and into our classroom, there’s also the small matter of Professor Emeric Switch, a world-renowned Transfiguration expert, is also a registered Animagus,” said Hermione briskly. “Would you like to hazard a guess what form he takes?”
“A little bit of both,” Draco quipped.
“Yaxley was convinced that I was part of The Order, so he kept me in the holding cells at the Ministry, determined to get information from me that I just didn’t have,” said Liv matter-of-factly. “The last few weeks of the war were unpleasant, to say the least, but I was beyond caring at that point—I had lost Ted and Dirk and I just wanted to hurt the people who had taken them from me. Destroying the files, throwing a spanner in the works of their operation, that was the only way I knew how. Not that it made much of a difference: when the Aurors finally released me from the holding cell, they told me that the war was over. I’d sat on my hands for the whole war and then I sat in a bloody cell, oblivious as the final battle raged on. The story of my life…”
“Please, call me Liv,” she implored. Minerva gave her a small smile.
“It’s a two-way mirror,” Harry explained. “I’ve got the other one of the pair." He pulled the twin mirror out of his pocket and showed it to Draco. Curiously, the glass on his mirror was broken.
Far from deterring Draco, he increased his pace. Harry felt his legs begin to buckle as the build-up of pleasure spread from his groin and through his body.
“Comes with the territory, I’m afraid,” sighed Phineas. “To be appointed to such an illustrious position has overwhelmed us all at some point or another.”
“No, they weren’t,” said Harry darkly, climbing the Grand Staircase with Draco by his side. “What I don’t understand is how everyone else seems to be affected except for me.”
“Go get measured for your robes after you’ve grabbed everything else,” Mrs Weasley instructed. “We’ll meet back at the Leaky Cauldron at five o’clock. Harry, if you get lost or trapped Flooing this time—”
“Is my being there really necessary?”
“Don’t get me started,” she muttered.
“And why do you care what happens to me?”
Madam Pomfrey picked up Draco’s school bag and rummaged through it, ignoring his shouts of protest. She pulled out the script of
Without breaking their kiss, Draco walked Harry backwards and pushed him onto his bed. Harry bounced onto the mattress and stared wide-eyed as Draco climbed onto his lap and leant down to kiss him again, Harry rising up to meet him halfway. He fleetingly wondered what would happen if Theo or one of the other boys walked into the dormitory at that moment and he was caught straddling Harry’s lap, but he found that he couldn’t care less. He wanted this. He wanted Harry. And by some miracle, for whatever reason, Harry wanted him too.
“I don’t know what you expect me to do about it. In case you’ve forgotten, I’m dead,” she huffed, crossing her arms. “And even if I could help, I wouldn’t. You deserve that for throwing it in the bin.”
Eventually, he took Goyle’s hand into his own and gave it a quick shake before they both swiftly dropped their hands by their sides again. There was a collective gasp when Goyle then held his hand up to Hermione. She was quicker to respond than Ron, taking his hand and giving it a firm shake before letting it go. Goyle looked relieved—whether it was because they had accepted his small gesture of truce or because the awkward interaction had mercifully come to an end, they weren’t entirely sure. Pansy grabbed Goyle’s elbow and gave it a slight tug.
“He was only yawning!” she argued. Shaking her head she turned to Harry and said gently, “And to be fair, Professor Sprout did warn us to be careful with the fire seeds. Oh, Harry, it isn’t like you to get so distracted like that!”
“Professor Switch,” she implored, “I’m sorry to disturb you but the class was due to start ten minutes ago. Sir?”
They chatted a little more before Draco made his excuses and retired to his room for the afternoon under the pretence of making a start on the pile of homework that he had waiting for him. He strode towards the west wing where his quarters were situated, passing the long line of pale-faced portraits that adorned the wood-panelled walls. He slowed his pace when he approached the drawing room, which doubled as his father’s office. The door was ajar, which usually meant that his father was present. Draco wasn’t particularly keen on conversing with the Malfoy patriarch, but there was no alternative route to his bedroom. He was tempted to turn back and hide in another room until the coast was clear, but Merlin knew how long that would take. Instead, Draco braced himself and walked as quickly and quietly as he could past the drawing room door. If he held his breath and kept his head down, his father might not hear him...
Grabbing the play script from his bedside table, Draco settled himself back to read his lines. “Now,” he sighed, flicking through the pages. “We rehearse. Where did we get to yesterday?”
“Well, I think he’s a realist,” Ginny argued. “People would rather lay blame at the feet of intangible concepts like fate and destiny than take responsibility for their own actions. It’s a cop-out, if you ask me.”
An unbearably tense silence followed that little speech and Draco waited for Liv to explode—he was even willing to risk being transfigured into a ferret again if it guaranteed him a train ride home. Liv’s jaw was so tense with anger that it appeared to be taking all of her willpower not to toss a barrage of curses—verbal and magical—in Draco’s face.
After reading the published article though, and seeing how they had even managed to twist her silence into a thinly-veiled and unfounded criticism of Kingsley, she realised that perhaps that had been short-sighted of her. She would write to Kingsley later in the evening to discuss the article and reaffirm her support of him. Pushing her glasses which had slid to the end of her long nose up, she continued to read:
Ignoring Snape’s interruption, Harry continued. “All I wanted to say was that since you were willing to give Draco another chance, I think Dennis should be afforded the same courtesy. Christ, the amount of times
Liv protested weakly but didn’t resist as Hestia took a careful but firm grip of her hand and lightly pressed the tip of her wand to the deep abrasion. “This might nip a bit.
Harry looked down at Draco. “Will you be alright on your own?”
Draco let out a dry laugh. “You think just because we’ve come to a truce that I’m going to go easy on you during lessons? In case you haven’t noticed, I’ve got a mean competitive streak.”
“And we both know that if Malfoy fails in his duty to watch out for you, he’ll be spending the rest of his days as a gastropod sitting on Hermione’s mantle piece in a glass jar,” Ron quipped.
When Harry saw Eeylops Owl Emporium, he paused outside the shop window to admire the many birds on display. Scops, barn and eagle owls sat snoozing in their cages. A large grey owl opened an eye and stared sleepily at Harry for a moment before closing it again and hiding its face beneath its wing. There were even a couple snowy owls for sale that looked a little like Hedwig. Thinking about her made the empty feeling in the pit of Harry’s stomach spread; it was a cold and sickly feeling, so he turned away from the shop window. He knew that it would be worthwhile getting another owl as they were useful to have, but Harry felt an irrational rush of anger at the thought of replacing Hedwig. No, he wouldn’t be getting a new owl, now or ever.
“And after that?” she asked. “Are you going to find a flat and move in together? Once he does tell his parents about you, is he going to have any kind of relationship with them? And if he is, are you expected to form some kind of civil relationship with them for his sake? And I hate to say it, but you’re both going to have to contend with everyone else’s reaction when they find out—have either of you thought about how you’re going to deal with that?”
“What are you doing here?” he asked, drawing a sharp look from the somber spectre.
“Quit your whining, we’re almost there,” said Harry.
"I'd rather not," Ron replied coolly. Draco, however, didn't look ruffled by Ron's icy attitude. He merely gave a careless shrug.
Draco was a little taken aback by Luna’s appearance (not that he could miss her as she was dressed in a canary yellow fur coat with matching boots that gave Draco the thought that she resembled a giant Fwooper). Apart from rehearsing scenes together and a passing greeting at the breakfast table, they didn’t speak to each other. He looked over his shoulder to double-check she hadn’t, in fact, been addressing someone else, but nobody was standing there. He turned back to face Luna, who stared at him expectantly with that somewhat unsettling smile of hers.
“Stop it!” Hermione cried, pulling Ron away while Ginny stood in front of Theo as though shielding him. “Please, just stop fighting with each other.”
Liv smiled at him. “Excellent! I appreciate your concerns but I think once you get past your initial nerves, you’re going to enjoy this. Taking part in the play is supposed to be fun!”
Sorry about this, but I just wanted to assure you all that I haven't disappeared, and I promise the next chapter is going to be an absolute cracker.
Draco smirked. “It is. Don’t tell me you’ve suddenly developed a conscience about breaking school rules?”
“Will you stop walking and just listen to me!” he cried. Harry shook Draco’s hand off of his shoulder and glared at him.
“You can’t just disband one of the houses because you don’t like it!” Hermione exclaimed.
Harry gave him a small smile. “Tell them what?”
“That’s really not necessary—”
Ron turned back to Hermione, feeling vindicated. “See? Even Malfoy thinks I look stupid.”
is rather enjoyable. Enjoy the rest of your night, Mr Malfoy.”
“How could you?” Ron cried. “How could you break up with my sister for Malfoy, of all people?”
Harry frowned. “What?”
“Who would do such a thing?” said Hermione, sounding horrified.
“What did you boys get up to?”
“It does.”
Hestia nodded solemnly. “I heard that she and Remus had a son.”
“We won’t need food or drink either; we’ll just sleep and shag and sleep and shag again.”
“That is enough!” Liv bellowed, marching onto the stage and snatching the wooden sword from Theo’s hand. “We solve our disputes with words, Mr Nott, not wands or toy swords!”
“Yeah, I totally planned that…” laughed Harry awkwardly.
“We talked about trying things out first before dismissing them,” Liv reminded him. “Tell you what, why don’t you attend a few rehearsals first? Practice your scenes with Luna and Harry, then come back to me again in a couple weeks’ time, and if you’re still not comfortable being in the lead role, then I won’t force you to do it.”
Professor McGonagall looked somewhat relieved by this and sat back in her chair. “Very well. Professor Tonks, since Professor Slughorn is currently unfit to perform his duties, I am temporarily appointing you to Head of Slytherin House.”
“Yeah, she did, actually,” Theo confirmed, glaring at Draco. “Pretty stupid idea, wasn’t it?”
“Oh. Yeah, me too.” Harry took a step away from Draco only to immediately turn around and face him again. “You know, since it’s our first scene together, we should probably practice it. Together, I mean.”
“Draco’s not here if that’s who you’re looking for,” she sulked. She glanced at Luna who smiled up at her. “Who are you?”
“I know. But I need to be able to make those decisions myself, good or bad.”
“You going to eat that?” he mumbled through a mouthful of food.
“Of all the places in the world I could be, you knew that you’d find me in a bookshop,” Liv pointed out. “I spend all of my free time reading musty old books and reciting Shakespeare and Tolkien. There are probably flobberworms out there with more exciting lives than mine.”
to Hestia, who slipped
He watched as Draco kicked off the ground and soared high into the air until he was a small black speck in the sea of blue sky before he started to walk slowly back towards the castle. It had been another unusual, yet pleasant day for Harry and it occurred to him that these seemed to be happening with alarming regularity, particularly when he was in Draco’s company. It was strange even admitting that to himself, let alone his best friends.
“Malfoy, just do it already,” Harry cut in impatiently. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. “If I can’t resist you, then I’ve got no chance against a dark wizard, have I? So, just go for it. Hit me with your best shot.”
...falls in love with her.”
“M-Madam Umbridge,” Liv stammered, tearing the note off of her forehead and stuffing it into the top drawer of her desk, out of sight. “How can I be of assistance?”
“It’s going to be strange, you know,” he said. “Not having you two by my side.”
“Merlin, you’re permanently on a first name basis with him now, aren’t you?” he grumbled. Harry rolled his eyes and continued.
Professor Sprout left the Hospital Wing wishing Harry a speedy recovery and promised him that he would have plenty of homework on the proper methods of handling fire seeds to catch up on when he was well again. Meanwhile, Madam Pomfrey pulled several bottles from a nearby medicine cabinet and proceeded to mix various potions and ointments to treat Harry’s wounds. Draco pretended to be reading his script but watched out of the corner of his eye as Harry, with some difficulty, peeled off his robes and shirt and allowed the matron to begin treating him. Draco felt the heat rise in his cheeks when Harry moaned in relief as the matron began applying cool salve to his injured arms. He tried to focus on the lines that he had to learn but he couldn’t concentrate on anything but those obscene and annoying breathy noises Harry was making.
“No!” Liv replied quickly. “No, of course not. You’re funny and smart and...an interesting person.”
“Um, I’ve almost finished it,” he lied. “So, that scene...you’re okay with it?”
Draco smiled and nodded in agreement. “Alright then, it’s a date.”
Myrtle gave a careless shrug. “You wouldn’t be the first person who dated someone their parents disapproved of. Really Draco, it’s about time you stopped worrying about what your parents think. The only person that is going to live your life is you: take control, make stupid mistakes, at least you’ll be able to say that they’re
“Yes, Miss.”
“It was quite the challenge,” she admitted with a watery smile. “That said, it has given me peace of mind knowing that you and Theo have been there to support each other throughout it all, even if I couldn’t.”
Harry looked nervously at Ginny before declaring, “You make me happy.”
Harry and Draco turned to see Professor McGonagall dressed as Mary, Queen of Scots, looming over them.
“Any particular reason that you’re out here hiding from us?” she queried lightly, crossing her arms. Harry shrugged.
“May I help you, sir?” he drawled, standing with his hands behind his back. Harry pulled his backpack higher up on his shoulder and stammered.
“Hello, Harry dear!” she cried, pulling him into a bone-crushing hug.
Draco huffed and crossed his arms. “I am not a maiden and I don’t need rescuing, thank you very much.”
“No, he’s right,” she murmured into his shoulder. “Typical of me to play devil’s advocate when I should just learn when to keep my mouth shut.”
Relieved to have survived her first ever lesson as a Hogwarts professor, she snatched up her handbag from under her desk and slung it over her shoulder. She had a free period before her next class and decided to reward herself with a quick bite to eat in the school kitchens. However, just as she was about to leave the classroom, she paused as she noticed that one of the scripts that she had handed out remained sat on one of the desks untouched. Luckily, she had anticipated something like this happening and had prepared accordingly. Lifting the script, she drew her wand and muttered, “Revelio” and the owner of the discarded script appeared at the bottom of the front page.
Draco decided that it was best to keep things as vague as possible and give his mother just enough information to keep her ticking over until he saw her again over the Christmas holidays. He scribbled down a few other lines about missing her and the Manor, and, as an afterthought, added that he hoped Father was keeping well. His mother hadn’t mentioned his father in her previous letter and Draco didn’t care to ask about him. He assumed that the Malfoy patriarch was still cooped up in his drawing room, stewing over how hard done by he and the family were. Draco didn’t much care for his father’s self-pity and he had more important things to contend with, like memorising his lines for this bloody play.
“Miss Parkinson,” Liv called, interrupting the scene. “As much as I admire your passion, you probably don’t need to throw the prop sword about quite so much.”
The creak of the portrait door swinging open again pulled Harry from his deep reverie and his insides jolted as Hermione stepped through the portrait hole, closely followed by Ron. He immediately sprang to his feet, causing Asha to squeak in protest as she was unceremoniously dislodged from her comfortable sleeping position before scarpering in the direction of the boys’ dormitory and out of sight. When Ron and Hermione caught sight of Harry, they paused. Harry opened his mouth to speak but found that words failed him. Although technically there were only a few meters separating them, he felt as though the distance between him and his best friends was far greater now than it had been earlier this evening. He’d put their friendship to the test on several occasions throughout the years. The last year, in particular, had been incredibly difficult, but despite some stumbles along the way, the three of them had always come out the other end, the bonds of friendship stronger than ever. But by the expression written across Ron’s face—the look of betrayal—Harry wasn’t entirely confident that their friendship would recover from this.
Rather than look embarrassed, Draco smirked. “I’m sure that will have traumatised Weasley.”
Minerva gasped as the desk burst into flames and the parchment quickly shrivelled and turned to ash. Liv slashed her wand through the air again, causing several jets of flames to fly across the small office space, exploding on impact as they hit cardboard boxes, sending paperwork, ash and red hot sparks flying in all directions. As she raised her wand to strike again, she paused as she heard loud banging and angry, muffled voices coming from her office door.
“Good. Because I don’t need your help,” said Draco curtly. Harry groaned and turned to leave, already regretting his decision to help him out, but Draco grabbed his shoulder and said hurriedly, “Bugger. Potter, wait!”
“Not to worry,” said Draco lightly. “I got plenty more practice in while you were chatting with your friends, so I’m sure to beat you to top billing now.”
Harry smiled warmly at the Weasley matriarch and pulled her into a tight hug. “I’m going to miss you, too.”
“Harry!” Neville jumped to his feet and pulled Harry into a tight hug, thumping him hard on the back. “I read in the papers that you were coming back but then, you never know what to believe. It’s good to see you, mate.”
“Sorry, I just got the impression that most magical folk had never heard of him.”
Draco smiled. “So you admit that you’re enjoying my company?”
“That’s something that we can both agree on,” Minerva muttered under her breath. “It appears that you only spent five years in the position. You didn’t like the job?”
Harry let out an exasperated sigh. “You’ve been talking to Ron, then?”
Harry turned to Draco to gauge his reaction. As much as he thought it was an inspired idea, perhaps it was hitting a little too close to home for Draco’s liking. But Draco looked contemplative for a moment before an amused smirk spread across his face.
Harry’s voice trailed as he continued his search and Draco tutted impatiently. Distracted by something of interest on the desk, he picked up a biro with his thumb and forefinger and inspected it closely.
is an exercise in futility, Mother. Going back to Hogwarts isn’t going to change anything. Not that it matters, you’ve already made it abundantly clear that my thoughts on my own future count for nothing,” he replied accusingly.
The gloomy mood that settled over the castle reminded Harry of their third year at Hogwarts when the Dementors had taken up residence in the castle; it was like a dark cloud followed everyone wherever they went. Even Peeves seemed more subdued. As someone who thrived in chaos, the distinct lack of mischief and permanently depressed state of the student body seemed to be having some effect on him, and even the belled tails of his jester hat seemed a little droopier these days. The only person—dead or alive—that seemed to be relishing the sombre atmosphere was Myrtle. She basked in their misery like it was sunlight, smiling serenely to herself as she floated down corridors and through classroom walls. Everyone at Hogwarts was miserable: the students, the professors, the ghosts—and especially the culprits.
“Let him speak,” she instructed. “I’m willing to hear his side of the story.”
“And Ginny,” Harry reminded him.
“As okay as she could be, under the circumstances. She was very understanding about the whole thing, more understanding than I deserved, I think. She had every right to be angry with me, she just wasn’t.”
“No, sir. We were wondering whether or not England would be participating in the Quidditch World Cup next summer,” she lied. “We heard Senegal is in with a good shot of winning. It was a trivial conversation, we shouldn’t have been speaking about it during work hours. I’m sorry, sir, it won’t happen again.”
“Mm, not quite.”
Harry grew even more alarmed when Draco gritted his teeth and screwed his face up in concentration, trying and failing to answer the question. “Rrrr…rrrrr…RRR— GREEN. Slytherin’s colours are green and silver. Fuck.”
“Ah. Well, that’s a relief.”
Lucius Malfoy was at his usual spot, sitting behind a large, yew writing desk at the opposite end of the room. The pale winter sunlight shone through the diamond-paned window behind the desk, illuminating his hair like a halo. But that’s where Lucius Malfoy’s angelic qualities began and ended. As Draco drew closer, he noticed that his father still bore the look of someone who had seen relatively little sunlight in many months; his ashen skin was almost translucent now, giving his pinched features a sickly complexion. Even sitting behind his grand desk, he looked too thin for his tall stature, his bony wrists protruding from black dress robes of fine silk.
Both Harry and Professor McGonagall’s heads snapped towards him then. “If that is the case, then why is the group named after him?”
“I’m fine,” said Draco hoarsely, although he felt far from it. “What the bloody hell was that?”
“Oh brilliant!” said Hermione approvingly. “Do you feel prepared for it? I’ve been able to memorise most of my lines but I’m not convinced I’m actually any good at acting. You don’t think Professor Tonks will hold that against me, do you?”
“But what if we fail?” Ron argued. “Do you really want that hanging over your head?”
Liv continued to smile, but it seemed a little forced. “I suppose so…”
“I think the hat suits you,” said Luna sincerely as they filed out of the classroom at the end of the lesson. “I might transfigure one for myself.”
While the station was busy (that shouldn’t have surprised him considering there was only days to go before Christmas) what took him aback was the noise: he could hear alarms blaring in the distance, children screaming, car horns honking, the rumble of traffic and screeching tires on wet tarmac. All these other sounds were drowned out by an echoey voice that suddenly blared overhead, alerting the Muggles to long delays from Cambridge.
“True,” Draco agreed, keeping his tone even. “I must learn to accept that my reputation is in the dirt. My family name is in ruins. Despite remaining considerably wealthy, it seems unlikely that we will be able to buy our way back into high society’s favour this time around. But it may have escaped your notice, Potter, that I don’t give a shit what anyone thinks about me. Most people didn’t like me before the war anyway, so what difference does it make if they’ve got the balls to say it to my face now instead of behind my back?”
love with her.
“What’s the matter?” asked Myrtle concernedly, floating over to Draco’s side. “Has something happened?”
Harry took the proffered paper and his eyes widened with surprise when he saw his and Draco’s faces front and centre on the poster. “Where did you get the pictures from?”
Harry groaned and buried his face in his hands, great waves of shame and confusion cascading over him at the memory of their fleeting and awkward sexual encounters. When they had briefly dated in his sixth year, they hadn’t done anything beyond kissing. That had suited Harry fine; he enjoyed Ginny’s company, and while he enjoyed kissing her—she was undoubtedly a great kisser—he had no real desire to do anything beyond that. He’d put it down to how stressful things had been at the time—they were on the brink of war, and he had the combined stress of exams and Dumbledore’s task to contend with. And of course, he had spent an inordinate amount of time tracking Malfoy throughout the castle, convinced that he was up to something nefarious. He felt a little bit embarrassed thinking back on it now, the amount of time wasted following that git instead of spending quality time with his girlfriend.
“It was only four months ago!”
They spent another couple of hours wandering around the zoo before returning to the hotel. Draco counted his blessings that they got back with a couple of hours to spare before heading out for dinner. He and Harry used their time wisely, falling into bed for the second time that day before taking a very long shower together. Dinner with his classmates was pleasant enough; Liv had taken them to some Mexican restaurant just ‘round the corner from the Globe Theatre. What he didn’t enjoy was having to hide being affectionate towards Harry in the company of others. Initially, sneaking around had an appealing thrill to it. Now, it was just annoying. He had to stop himself several times from touching Harry, tucking a stray hair behind his ear or kissing him, so he tried to keep his hands occupied by holding his drink in both hands. It looked as though Harry was struggling too. He reached out only to stop and plant his hands firmly on his lap before giving Draco an apologetic smile. The situation was only made worse by seeing Theo and Ginny. He glowered at the happy couple sitting at the opposite end of the long dinner table, laughing and joking (urgh, and kissing) to their heart’s content. Draco stabbed his shrimp enchilada with his fork, wondering why he and Harry were partaking in this silly charade in the first place.
It's the penultimate chapter! I can't believe that this journey is almost over. But there are a few loose ends that need tied up before the story comes to an end. Enjoy this latest chapter, everyone. :)
Three more chaps, slightly louder, followed. Minerva cleared her throat and called out in a clear voice.
believe in are the self-fulfilling kind,” Liv argued. “Personally, I think it’s too easy to blame fate and destiny to excuse unsavoury behaviour. People ought to take ownership of the choices they make, good or bad. That’s the point Shakespeare wanted to get across to us—that each of us chooses our own path in this life. Yes, we’re all flawed human beings, ambling blindly towards the grave—”
“What was her name?”
“I always thought you were a prat, Malfoy, but Nott is a hundred times worse,” he grumbled, aggressively spearing the Cumberland sausage on his plate. Draco chuckled and put a Jack-o'-Lantern pot pie on his own plate.
Myrtle kissed the air and giggled to herself at the thought. Draco rolled his eyes but chose not to dignify her comment with a response. If he were being perfectly honest with himself, he wasn’t sure how much of London he’d get to see while he was there.  He’d be content if he saw nothing else beyond the boundaries of his hotel room, but he kept that thought to himself.
“We have nothing in common.”
Harry had worried that something like this might happen. A lot of the Slytherin students’ parents were dead or in Azkaban because of the war—because of him. He knew that, sooner or later, someone would corner him and his friends when there were no teachers around. Well, Harry had fought off worse than Goyle and his crew. Hermione and Ron shared nervous glances while the other Slytherins scowled at them.
“It’s just not right,” Draco persisted. “It shouldn’t have been allowed to happen—any of it.”
“If you think that wearing red is going to appeal to my Gryffindor sensibilities, you are sorely mistaken,” she warned. Liv chuckled.
“Tough luck, mate,” he whispered in Harry’s ear. “I thought she was a shoo-in for Juliet. Ah well, guess it doesn’t matter if you get cast as Romeo anymore.”
“Did you have another falling out with Myrtle?” he asked.
The school bell rang signalling the start of classes and Liv knew that she’d find out either way soon enough. Sitting at her desk, she watched as the classroom slowly started to fill with students, but there was no sign of Draco. Strangely, there was no sign of Harry, either. Professor McGonagall had pre-warned her of the rivalry between the two boys and Liv began to wonder if the conspicuous absences were connected.
“When you do feel ready to talk, I’m here to listen.”
When Harry had decided to return to Hogwarts, he promised himself two things: that he would try to stay out of trouble and that he would make more of an effort to study. But despite his good intentions, only two days into the start of the new term, he had already managed to fail on both counts.
“That was a wonderful performance, boys, totally captivating,” she gushed. “Well, that concludes our auditions for the day. Unfortunately, there isn’t enough time to begin our next topic, so you’re all free to enjoy the rest of the period however you please. I’ll be deciding who will be playing which roles over the weekend and I’ll announce the casting on Monday afternoon. Well done again to all of you, I was really impressed by each and every performance. Class dismissed.”
Harry grunted irritably and swatted away a fly that persistently buzzed around his face. It was embarrassing enough to be a grown man and still be dubbed ‘The Boy Who Lived’, worse still to be credited for the work and sacrifices of greater men and women than himself. He thought of Professors Dumbledore and Snape, of Remus and Tonks, Sirius, Fred, Dobby...all of those who had given everything to the fight and his stomach twisted unpleasantly at the paltry comparison.
Harry’s face broke out into a wide grin and he snatched the broomstick from Draco’s outstretched hand. He mounted it, ready to take flight, but just as he was about to kick off the ground, he paused. Turning to Draco, he tentatively offered his hand.
“You’re awfully fond of that jumper, aren’t you?” she mused.
“Haven’t you been practising your lines over the holidays?” asked Hermione.
THE END (OFFICIALLY).
After fixing up Myrtle’s bathroom, Harry had spent the rest of his evening mulling over the threatening messages that had been written across the walls. He decided to confront Draco about it at the next opportune moment, which came about the next day during their morning Transfiguration lesson. Professor Switch had tasked each student to transfigure their hair into a different colour, then to change it back again. So far, only Hermione had managed to change hers from platinum blonde back to its normal brown colour, but curiously it was a few inches shorter than before. Currently, Draco’s hair was canary yellow and he was having some trouble changing it back.
“Hardly,” Harry muttered, his confused expression quickly changing into one of embarrassment. “I was in Herbology and I just wasn’t paying attention. I forgot to put on my gloves before picking up fire seeds.”
Draco hesitated. “I suppose not.”
“Really,” he grinned mischievously at Draco. “I’m actually seeing someone at the moment, if you must know.”
“Because I read a lot of books, Potter,” he drawled. “The Manor has quite an extensive library, better than the one at this school, in my opinion.”
“It’s the tree that’s laughing, you plum,” he chastised lightly. Rolling his eyes at the confused expression on Harry’s face, he explained, “This is an Alihotsy tree; you use the leaves to brew a laughing potion.”
“Fuck,” Draco murmured, watching Harry with an awed expression as he pleasured himself, running his fingertips around the sensitive ring of muscles before pushing in slightly, meeting some resistance. Harry lightly pushed Draco’s head down again and, taking the hint, Draco continued to suck on Harry’s nipples with renewed fervour. Harry cast a silent, wandless lubrication charm and sighed with relief as this time his fingers slid into his body with relative ease. Draco felt a spike of arousal as he imagined that it was his cock instead of Harry’s fingers filling him up, fucking him closer to climax. The mewling sounds spilling from Harry was music to Draco’s ears. He was so turned on by the way Harry was falling to pieces at his touch, transfixed by the way he gyrated his hips and buried his fingers deeper inside of himself. He had to press his cock, aching from neglect, against Harry’s thigh and rut back and forth a few times just to relieve some of the pressure; his length, already slick with precum, slid back and forth without resistance. Harry took notice of what Draco was doing and moaned approvingly before his hand slid from Draco’s hair and he took a firm grip of Draco’s cock at the base. Draco’s hips jerked forward and he let out a shaky breath as Harry began stroking him.
The mistrustful voice in the back of his mind kept telling him that Harry must have some ulterior motive—why else would he want to talk to Draco? It couldn’t be because he actually liked him. However, despite his misgivings, he couldn’t help but trust that Harry’s motivations weren’t self-interested. He was too bloody noble and heroic to be planning anything nefarious towards Draco. Where that once would have made Draco balk, now he found it somewhat endearing. Draco allowed himself a small smile; stupid, annoying, funny and thoughtful Potter was too kind for his own good. Draco hoped that he’d never change. He slipped the little keepsake into his breast pocket and, for the first time since he’d arrived at Hogwarts, he felt glad to be here.
“I saw you two laughing and chatting away like old buddies,” he said accusingly. “Did he hit you with a Confundus Charm or something?”
“Sorry,” Myrtle replied mildly. “After you’ve been dead for a few decades, you can’t help but let your perspective on life—or death, whatever—become a little morbid.” Myrtle slid off of the cistern that she had been perched upon and floated down in front of Draco. “Don’t take this the wrong way but I’m sorry that you didn’t die during the battle.”
Harry snarled and reached for his school bag. With some difficulty, he managed to lift it onto his lap and, after rummaging through it for a few moments, he roughly pulled his copy of the script out and tossed his bag back onto the floor. Draco watched with growing amusement as Harry struggled to flip through the pages of the script with his heavily bandaged fingers.
“And? It’s probably full of rags, anyway,” Draco huffed as he tried to pull his arm free from Harry’s vice-like grip. “I’ll be doing you a favour blowing it up!”
“An unfortunate mishap with a Nose-Biting Teacup,” Draco explained. “And they’re not the only ones. There were the first year students who ate the Canary Creams, the Bang Bang Boggart Bangers that got released in our Common Room a couple of days back…”
“Tell me about it. Actually, that reminds me—I’ve got something for you.” Harry clambered off of the bed, threw open his trunk and began rummaging through it, searching for something. He pulled a small parcel roughly wrapped in paper and string from the bottom of the trunk and sat next to Draco again. Holding out the parcel to him, he said, “I know it’s a bit early, but merry Christmas.”
“Two households, both alike in dignity,” he began, his voice carrying across the large audience as though someone had applied a Sonorus Charm to it. “In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, from ancient grudge break to new mutiny, where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.”
Harry tried to wrestle the wand out of Draco’s hand but Draco wouldn’t relent. Twisting and pushing against each other, Draco took a step backwards and tripped over the trunk. He reached out for the only thing within reach and grabbed a fistful of Harry’s robes to stop himself from falling over, but Harry lost his footing and both of them tumbled over the trunk and landed with a loud thud on the carriage floor, arms and legs akimbo. Harry’s pet carrier flew out of his hand and clattered to the ground with a loud bang and the little ferret inside squeaked with fright. Harry’s eyes widened with horror.
Ron looked flabbergasted at Hermione’s outburst. “Crikey, Mione, next you’ll be telling me that you don’t like the Chudley Cannons, either.”
Liv waved Hestia off and walked back to her desk with a spring in her step. Anytime she and Hestia spent time together, she felt a balloon of happiness swell inside her chest and right now it felt so big that she worried that she would float out of the castle window and over the surrounding mountains. She managed to anchor herself back to reality by turning her thoughts away from Hestia and onto the upcoming lesson. Despite Hestia’s assurances, Liv couldn’t help but feel a little apprehensive thinking about how these auditions would go. What if none of the students had rehearsed? Or, worse still, what if they refused to take part? While she knew that wasn’t likely, Liv was a worrier by nature and she couldn’t help that the thought cross her mind. She also had the additional worry that Draco Malfoy wouldn’t turn up for class. She thought that she had managed to convince him to stay on at school (at least for the time being) but she hadn’t seen him during breakfast that morning and wondered if the incident with the bubotuber pus was enough for him to throw in the towel and leave Hogwarts.
Harry sighed and rolled over onto his side, hugging himself and wishing that he had someone to talk to about his feelings. It was in moments like these that he missed Sirius the most, although he could imagine his godfather’s reaction if he admitted to liking Draco Malfoy of all people. “A rose by any other name” Shakespeare said. If Draco wasn’t a Malfoy and he wasn’t Harry Potter, maybe things would be so much simpler. But they weren’t and it wasn’t. Harry’s life was one of neverending drama. Harry closed his eyes and fell into a restless sleep. He supposed he ought to just accept that already.
“A truly awful sight to behold,” Harry joked.
“Professor Emeric Switch,” she explained excitedly. “He wrote
“There will be a choreographed dance scene for the Masquerade Ball but we won’t begin learning that for another few weeks yet, so for now, we’ll begin with Lord Capulet’s speech and move straight onto Romeo and Juliet’s first meeting,” she instructed. “Mr Corner, if you could come centre stage, please. Everyone else, take positions. Any questions? No? Brilliant. Let’s get started, shall we?”
That production will be performed for us all on the newly built stage at the Quidditch arena on February fourteenth. I’m sure you’re all as excited as I am to see what our students have to show for their labours. Attendance is compulsory.”
Liv nodded vigorously. “Please.”
“Well,” he croaked. “When you put it like that. We might as well take full advantage of the experience.”
“Muggles aren't all bad, and things have gotten a lot better in recent years,” Harry argued but Draco was having none of it.
Without a moment’s hesitation, Harry grabbed Draco’s hand and pulled him through the low-hanging branches of the Alihotsy tree and back towards the castle. “We’re going to see Madam Pomfrey. Just don’t talk to anyone on the way.”
“Agreed,” muttered Draco darkly and Harry gave him a weak smile. He supposed Draco knew all too well what that was like.
Draco lunged forward and pushed Harry flat onto his back, knocking his wand out of his hand in the process. The connection between their minds was instantly severed and Harry looked around disoriented, sprawled across the grass as Draco loomed over him on his hands and knees, looking panic-stricken.
“Do you ever clean out your bag or is carrying loads of rubbish just par for the course for you?”
—time to go!”
Anger flashed across Liv’s face when Umbridge said the word ‘Mudblood’ but she quickly schooled her expression into a forced smile.
“A treat?” Ron snorted. “Look at the number of books she’s assigned us! That’s more than our other subjects combined!”
“Bugger,” Ron grumbled. He turned his attention to Hermione. “What about Bulstrode? Don’t give me that look, Hermione, I know that you must have seen something!”
Harry’s voice snapped Draco from his forbidden revery and he realised then that Harry was smiling up at him.
“Sure, why not? Who knows, maybe if I get the part of Juliet I’ll meet a hot Romeo,” she joked. She drained her goblet of orange juice before waving them off and leaving the Great Hall. Ron waited until Ginny was well out of earshot before he nudged Harry in the ribs.
“All I mean is that you’re really missing out on a great story,” she argued. “The play is set in Verona—that’s in Italy.”
“From forth the fatal loins of these two foes, a pair of star-crossed lovers take their life,” he declared, his voice growing in strength with each word that he spoke. “Whose misadventured piteous overthrows doth with their
“Told you that you’d be fine,” said Harry encouragingly. “You want to try petting her?”
“You’re too emotional,” Draco explained unhelpfully. “You need to learn to compartmentalise your feelings, otherwise your mind is like an open book.”
Draco immediately scratched that out. There was a part of him that wanted to tell his mother about Harry, to just be honest about his feelings, but deep down, he knew that he wouldn’t do that. Draco Malfoy had never been famed for his bravery. He tried to imagine telling his parents and them being completely fine and accepting of his relationship with Harry but he knew that was wishful thinking. No, it was better just to keep things between him and Harry quiet for the time being—at least until Draco was certain of Harry’s feelings for him, that whatever they had was something worth the risk of his parents’ wrath. As strong as his feelings were for Harry, it was still early days in their relationship. His secret beau might live with his heart on his sleeve but Draco was far more cautious with his feelings. Draco thought for a moment what he could say to his mother instead before writing….
However, Hestia raised her hand and said, “Let’s give him a chance to pull this back. He just needs to concentrate on keeping his mind clear.”
“Could’ve fooled me,” Draco mumbled.
I really struggled writing this chapter but I didn't want to post it until I was satisfied with what I had written. So thank you everyone for being so patient waiting for this latest chapter, I hope that you all enjoy it!
“They’re not press briefings, Malfoy. Journalists just follow me everywhere that I go and make up things about me to suit their stories,” said Harry defensively. “How do you think I ended up in here in the first place?”
Snape—was a Slytherin and a Death Eater, but ultimately, he was on our side. And as for Draco Malfoy...his situation was a little more complicated than most people think.”
“Even if it’s hard to find,” she corrected him with a watery smile before admitting, “I didn’t think it would be so hard coming back here.”
he thought irritably to himself. That was another thing that Ron was struggling to wrap his head around. After seven years of being at each other’s throats, all of a sudden Harry and Malfoy were laughing and joking with each other like they’d been friends for years. Okay, so Ron might have neglected his friendship with Harry of late, spending “quality time” with Hermione whenever the opportunity arose. But surely Harry wasn’t lonely enough to feel that he needed to buddy up with the likes of Draco Malfoy. There were so many other better, nicer people he could have chosen to be friends with instead. A horrible thought struck Ron then—maybe Harry was doing this to make him feel jealous!
she murmured. “Who do you reckon that could be?”
Draco chuckled. “You’re not the only one. Still, I’m glad to see that so many of the old gang are back. It should be an interesting year, if nothing else.”
“Yup, there’s a lion in there,” he confirmed. A panicked murmur spread through the crowd as everyone tried to figure out what they should do. Ron checked his watch and chuckled.
costume, what about mine?” said Ron, lifting his arms and turning on the spot for Harry to see him from all angles. “What do you think?”
“Of course not!” she cried, hurrying out of the hotel entrance and turning left in the direction of the nearest subway. “You know they all got destroyed that night at the Ministry.”
“It’s not that simple!” he snapped. “What if my parents find out?”
“I don’t think it’s the Friar who’s to blame for what happens,” said Harry suddenly.
Draco’s return to Hogwarts had been worse than he had expected. The other Slytherins had pointedly ignored him during the welcoming feast but at least he had a plateful of delicious food to keep him occupied, although he hadn’t had much of an appetite. The worst moment was when he had entered the boys’ dormitory and all of his former friends acted as though he were invisible, chatting amongst themselves and walking past him as though he weren’t even there. It was difficult to pretend that this behaviour didn’t bother him so he had forgone his usual nighttime rituals and instead had made quick work stripping off his school clothes and drawing the curtains around his bed. He had lain awake most of the night, shame and loneliness eating away at him, wishing that he was at home in the Manor. He hadn’t felt this homesick since his very first night at Hogwarts, but at least then he’d had his friends. This time, he was completely alone. The only person who had the courage to look him in the eye since he’d arrived was Harry, but then they were hardly friends.
“So do you,” Harry added conversationally, taking the seat opposite Neville and Luna. She fixed her protuberant, unblinking gaze on him and Draco, which always gave him the sense that she had x-ray vision. “What?”
“Is everything okay?” she’d asked uncertainly.
“Oh!” Minerva quickly tidied her desk and shoved the newspaper into the top drawer out of sight. She had completely forgotten that she had arranged for Liv to come for a job interview this evening. Pushing her glasses up her nose again, she sat up straight in her seat and poured herself a fresh cup of tea.
“It was?” Professor Switch pulled a battered watch from a chain around his neck and gasped when he saw the time. “Oh dear. Well, you did the right thing waking me up. Thank you, Miss..?”
