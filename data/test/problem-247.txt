“It’s not hard,” Potter says, a small smile on his face. “I nearly missed it too.”
this. Who would’ve known that you secretly wanted to be tied up, right here, where anyone could find us? Ha! Pervert.”
He’s lonely.
“Are you in love with me?” Potter asks, in the middle of unbuttoning Draco’s shirt, and Draco chokes on air.
Because even though Draco’s in love with him, has been for so many fucking years—he’s never even dreamed that Potter could ever like him back.
“Come off it,” Malfoy says, frowning at him. “And you weren’t with me?”
“Not sure,” Malfoy says, looking around them, scanning the crowd. Harry sees the moment his eyes catch on someone, an attractive man with sandy hair and dimples, dancing alone and looking nearly the opposite of Harry. “Maybe him.”
“I don’t do that,” Potter grumbles, scowling even more intensely than before.
Harry goes red. Fuck. “I just...”
“Do you ever think about what it would’ve been like if we hadn’t hated each other back then?” he says after a moment. Draco is uncharacteristically silent, so Harry turns his head and looks at him. Those grey eyes stare back, and Draco moves his arm over, the one that’s Marked, and curls his fingers around Harry’s hand.
Rolling onto his back, Draco stares at the ceiling, heaving a sigh. “Do you know why I still call you by your surname?”
“Ngh—not sure, I, oh fuck,
to get you to do this for weeks, if you remember.”
Finally, after a moment of struggling with his thoughts, his voice erupts from his mouth—“You absolute
“Maybe I was just covering my own arse.”
That hurts.
“For the time being,” Lupin said. Sure. That’s what they said when they locked Harry in the safehouse too.
Draco stops on his way out of the room, looking the mirror up and down. It looks innocent enough like this, the morning sunlight striping over it from the blinds, but he and Harry have used it for a vast number of vaguely deplorable acts, ranging from using it to show them all sorts of scenarios to just simply watching themselves fuck.
Draco laughs. “Ah. Well…” A casual shrug, a brush of fingers against blond hair, nearly down to Draco’s shoulders now, and the grin that never fails to set his heart beating faster. “You want to swim, then?”
He turns around. He is the one screaming.
Harry hates that he’s even
“No,” Harry shoots back, rolling his eyes. “I’m not making any accusations, unlike you. If anything I’d say it feels like House Elf magic.”
“Harry,” Draco says again, his lip trembling. “Harry…”
But he can’t seem to dislodge the insecure feeling in his chest.
He dreamed about it the night before Draco came to his shop the first time, although it seems his dream was hazy on the details.
“It’s not hard,” Malfoy tells him.
For some reason, Harry looks vaguely unsettled—probably because they’re so far apart from each other. Draco understands. So he gets up from his chair, and Harry stands too, but Harry looks a little shaky and Draco wonders why—usually Harry is the more forward one in these situations.
Harry nods, and then he braces himself for the inevitable wave of rejection to start slowly crushing him.
“I think you like it,” Harry says, sliding his hands over Draco’s back and sighing at the feel of skin on skin.
Harry shudders. God. “Are you sure that, er, this won’t hurt you or anything?”
“I’m mad about you,” Harry says, gazing down at him. Then he nudges Draco’s legs apart, waiting for Draco to pull his knees up before positioning himself.
Of course, the moment he thinks that, Draco does the polar opposite.
“Malfoy,” Potter says, and Draco looks up from brushing the dust off of his clothes and catches Potter’s gaze, intense and far too close.
“Not when the instructions are as idiotic as you are—Potter, would you
“It wasn’t just the dirty-talk,” Harry says. “It was just—all of it.” He gestures between them. “Us. I like us.”
Part of Harry had been annoyed. But part of Harry had jumped at the chance because he’d happened to have a stupid crush on Malfoy for far too long, and kissing him with no repercussions sounded too good to be true—just like the approving glances that Malfoy would occasionally shoot him when they were paired together in DADA.
Draco cuts him off with a kiss, the softest one they’ve ever shared. “Let me pretend to love you,” he says, “Just for now.”
“But…” Draco trails off.
Well, fuck. Draco’s caught red-handed, isn’t he? He sighs. “Just, er. That time when we were alone in the showers,” he says slowly, expecting Harry to tell him off for spying.
“How?” Potter asks, and Draco bites his lip, grabbing at Potter’s hand and moving it between his own legs.
He wonders if that makes him a bad person.
“I do. Just sit there and shut up,” Malfoy says, eyes tracing his lines on the page in front of him. And then he freezes. “Oh, for Salazar’s sake—” He stops mid-sentence, slamming the book shut and beginning to pace. “Absolutely
It was all a lie, wasn’t it?
Fuck.
“That’s precisely why I’m annoyed. You have the ability to have a normal, regular, possibly grand life and you’re squandering it.” Malfoy scoffs. “You’re the fucking Chosen One.”
Harry thinks of Malfoy calling her a Mudblood, and he thinks of the horrid scar marked on her arm, the curse from Bellatrix Lestrange that she won’t ever manage to get rid of.
widen of their own accord. “Twice in one night,” he breathes, and then he laughs softly. “Merlin. You should tie me up more often.”
And then there’s this…
Harry thinks he has to be terribly unlucky to have chosen the two dullest departments of all time for his first two rotations.
Draco fucking melts. He moans unabashedly, reaching up to wrap his arms around Potter’s shoulders, and they’re still moving with the beat but mostly Draco’s pressing his hips up against Potter’s, repeatedly gasping as Potter starts nipping at his neck and collarbone, liquid fire burning in Draco’s groin. It’s so much more than he could have dreamed of, and Draco soaks it in, mind going faintly fuzzy in disbelief, and then his knees buckle and Potter’s basically holding him up, fuck. Potter pulls back, steadying him, and Draco feels a wave of disappointment at the loss before Potter leans forward and puts his lips to Draco’s ear and says, “Wanna go?”
Thankfully, it works.
Draco stood up, looking mystified. “I was at Diagon with Harry. Why?”
‘Do you promise?’ Draco thinks. But the parchment cannot answer. He should bin it, but against his better judgement he puts it in his pocket instead.
He almost wonders if it would be easier on her if she were sentenced too. Not that he wants Mother dead, but it would save her the pain of losing the only family she still has, the pain that hurts Draco even more than he hurts for himself.
him that—he couldn’t, because very soon Draco will hate him, and Harry wouldn’t put it past Draco to use it against him.
“This was a present for my mother’s birthday a few months ago, but I think the charm is botched.” He twists the brush around and holds it toward Harry, handle-first, so Harry can see the thin cracks running through the silver. It’s an obvious indication of a charm gone wrong, and immediately Harry’s mind starts twisting with theories on what might’ve happened. “She said it was fine for the first couple months she used it,” Malfoy continues, “but then one night she picked it up and it shattered. Neither she nor I could figure out how to fix it, so I decided to take it back to the shop. Figures it was your shoddy charmwork,” Malfoy scoffs.
,” Draco insists, eyes wide with nervousness. “I really hate you.”
“Good, then,” Ron says, sitting back down on the sofa, and Harry and Draco head to the other one, across the coffee table from Ron.
No. He was not going to go there right now, not with Ginny right in front of him. He filed the thought away into the ‘save for later (maybe never)’ drawer in his brain, resisting the urge to shake it completely out of his head while he was at it.
“Fuck,” Malfoy sighs very quietly, and finally, it’s a crack in his smooth-talking exterior—a crack to show that this is Malfoy but this is also Draco,
It was that conversation, Harry thinks, that spurred Hermione to research her parents’ condition even more fervently than before. It was also the conversation that made Harry decide to finally mail a letter to the Dursleys to see what had come of them. Their response was fairly terse, which was honestly expected, but then Dudley wrote back separately, starting an infrequent but reassuring exchange of letters that still continues to this day.
He knows seeking Malfoy out is probably dangerous and ill-advised—Hermione and Ron would certainly say so. He doesn’t tell them about it for precisely that reason, even though several questions burn in his throat the next time he joins them for dinner—
“That didn’t seem to be a problem when you decided to tie me up,” Draco grumbles, squirming as Potter spreads his cheeks again, face near enough that Draco can feel the heat of his breath but not touching him just yet.
If Draco’s trying to hurt him… it’s working.
with your little Gryffindor friends? I’m sure the Weasel would’ve been more than happy to.”
“Yes, really,” Draco says, already feeling weary. “Just don’t say anything weird about our imaginary dating life.”
Draco feels suddenly selfish. He’s made this all about him again, when Potter’s wearing himself to the bone trying to help. “Anyway,” he says, “don’t you deserve a fucking rest for once?”
,” Draco says, trying to grab it back, forcing Harry to hold it as far away as he can.
“Yeah, whatever,” Harry mutters. “Let’s just get this over with.”
It takes about three seconds for Draco’s resolve to break. There’s no harm in opening the thing, and he doesn’t even know if what he wants is even
Potter gives him a strange look, shoving his hands into the pockets as he leaves the room.
“Fine,” he says, although he can’t avoid adding a small sniff of displeasure at the end.
Draco toys around with a chip, contemplating her words before taking a bite. “Do you really despise it? I just always assumed you weren’t interested.”
But Harry did want to, and it was killing him, burning him from the inside. Because Draco was… Draco was everything, and Harry craved the closeness of it, craved Draco’s body in a way that he’d never known before. But nothing could keep this from causing Draco pain, not with Harry being too broken to love him. Harry knew without even thinking about it that it would tear at Draco’s emotions just as the thought of going through with it at all was tearing at Harry’s heart, shredding it into tiny pieces.
Just as he’s starting to think that Potter’s actually stood him up, he hears a pop at the Apparition point and turns to see Potter striding toward him, wearing tight black trousers that actually fit for once, a dark grey Weird Sisters t-shirt doing nothing to hide his firm biceps.
McGonagall looked severely frustrated. “At this point, I’m not sure Minister Shacklebolt himself could do anything. But I called the Minister to my office just in case, so come along before the Aurors get here,” McGonagall said, already heading swiftly to the door.
Except there is, apparently. “You two are idiots,” the mirror says. “Why don’t you just fuck in the shower?”
The music stops. He blinks again, trying to focus on the source, but it’s futile because he can’t turn his head to see where it had been coming from.
Draco whirls around to look at the Potter standing next to him, eyes wide. “You—you tried to kiss me!”
He leapt off of the sofa, leaving the Map on the coffee table as he raced down the corridor. It wasn’t long before he was pacing in front of the blank wall, half curious and all sorts of terrified about what he was going to see.
Potter is silent.
Potter swallows, his Adam’s apple bobbing. “You suppose?”
Harry shrugs. “It was nothing, really.”
“That’s it, Potter,” Malfoy says, and the smirk in his voice is back. “I bet you’ve always wanted to do this, haven’t you? To submit to me? I can see it in your eyes when you’re glaring at me during breakfast, you know. You used to make me so
Draco looks at him seriously. “Everything,” he nearly whispers.
Harry throws a balled up piece of scratch paper at him, playfully scowling even though he knows Four can't see his expression behind the charms. “Prick.”
Draco wipes his mouth and his hand comes away with blood. “I have no fucking idea,” he says roughly.
He never imagined how good this would feel.
Harry nods, though he doesn’t think he’ll be taking Ron up on that offer any time soon, standing and heading to his bedroom.
“You could say that,” Draco says, something like a smirk on his lips, and Harry chuckles.
“No, it’s fine,” Malfoy says quietly. “It’s just—Granger’s here. I’ll... leave.”
Malfoy is silent for a moment, and Harry’s stomach drops.
But it’s really nice, to feel loved like this.
Harry wanted to scream.
“I think that’s rather obvious, given your first go around,” Harry quips.
“…Yeah. I suppose so.”
“So you want to—what. Eat lunch with me?” Malfoy asks. “Seems rather normal for a friendship, you know.”
“Okay,” Draco says, feeling a little numb. Somewhere between the awful pain of the bond and the warmth of Potter’s arms, his anger seems to have receded, and he’s not sure he could get it back even if he wanted to.
“That’s what you get for wearing robes so tight that I can see—well. Everything,” Harry says.
It’s pouring outside, and somewhere in their bedroom, the roof has sprung a leak. Harry can hear it dripping, tapping, counting down the time until he loses Draco forever.
Draco swallows hard. “You’re an idiot,” he says, his heard pounding in his chest.
Harry lets out a sheepish laugh, shaking his head. “Yeah, okay, I do. Sorry.”
“You have your parents,” Harry reminds him indignantly.
Harry laughs softly. “Did that already,” he points out.
Hermione’s mouth twists. “No, but dying wouldn’t be all that much worse.”
Malfoy looks startled, like the doe Harry once caught grazing in Hagrid’s vegetable garden. “Well,” he says slowly. “There’s also the fact that I can’t be friends with you because you won’t listen to me at all times, and I am obviously always right, so. There’s that.” He lifts his wand and starts painting again.
Hermione was the glue that held them all together, the one that really made them face their emotions. Without her, they’re just barely getting by.
“Oh,” Harry says, reaching up to touch Malfoy’s cheek, warmth filling his chest when Malfoy gives him a small smile. “That’s okay, then.”
“Okay,” Potter says, and smiles.
It makes Draco think that maybe the end of their marriage wasn’t the worst thing in the world. He’s always wanted her happiness, after all.
“I can’t feel any of the normal Veela urges,” Draco says. “But it could fail—not that I don’t trust your charms, but I do want to be careful.”
Harry is suddenly caught up in wondering exactly who Malfoy hangs out with these days, if he has friends he visits weekly or even someone to share a bed with. Maybe neither of those is true, if Malfoy’s expression is anything to go by.
“Sure, Potter,” Malfoy mutters.
But he’s not. Instead he’s just tired and grumpy and—now that Astoria’s gone—alone.
Harry looks like he’s just been given the best present of his life. He grins, shaking his head as if he can’t quite believe it. “I love you,” he says, voice rough, sparking emotion in Draco’s chest. And then Harry leans down and kisses Draco, again and again, and the slow shift of Draco’s entire world changing finally starts to settle.
Abruptly he thinks of the Manor, technically his, but absolutely not somewhere he’d be comfortable living. Looking at the musty relics littered on the walls as they climb the stairs to Potter’s bedroom, he’s starting to understand why Potter doesn’t want to be in his own home.
But he has to act normal, so he opens his mouth, turning to Potter and says, “Well, that’s bloody annoying…”
, not with someone he’d honestly stopped hating months ago—
“Did I ever tell you about that time I rode the Knight Bus?” Harry asks Draco. They’re in bed, naked, sharing a pillow with their limbs tangled haphazardly over the sheets.
“It’s okay,” Potter says, a small, sad smile on his mouth. “I might’ve done the same if I were in your shoes—we’re very good at fighting.”
“Wait, no!” Malfoy stops him, already sounding desperate. “It’s just—I suspect that would only make it worse.”
,” Draco groans, as Harry proceeds to suck him down again, steadying Draco’s cock with his hand. “Keep—a bit faster, if you can—oh, yes, like that,” he instructs, and Harry appreciates that he’s being gentle but really what he kind of wants is for Draco to manhandle him a bit more.
Harry takes a sip of his own, scrunching his nose up. “No wonder, it’s flat.” The cola tastes burnt-out and unappetizing, and Draco vanishes his drink while Harry squints at his own for an expiration date.
conversation that he avoids Draco entirely at work. It gets so bad that even Ron notices, remarking nonchalantly that Draco hasn’t been by their shared desk space lately, and Harry’s almost worked up the courage to say something to Draco about it when Draco makes a move first.
“But you…” Harry sobbed openly, biting his knuckle so hard that he might have started bleeding. “You l-love me… don’t you? Why don’t you want…? We slept together, and—“
He’s tired of being angry. He’s tired of Potter glaring at him and having to hold his tongue for fear that he’ll just confirm Potter’s negative image of him if he speaks; he’s tired of feeling like he can’t breathe except when they go to sleep. Most of all, he’s tired of Potter hating him, because some small part of Draco has decided it wants Potter to touch him even more, and that part dies a little inside every time Potter’s eyes go hard.
That means that these moments are mere treachery, setting Potter up for even more pain—and Draco is to blame, for grasping at a friendship that he’s never deserved.
He’s taking a risk, he knows. But the brilliant smile Malfoy gives him just then makes it worth it.
“Okay,” Draco says, still not quite believing him.
want to be apart right now, and at any rate even if we tried, I doubt we’d be able to stay apart once it starts—
“It’s none of your business.”
Harry wakes late the next morning to an owl tapping on his window. He takes the letter and then it flies away immediately—no return requested then, and no owl treat either.
Harry to like him.
Their spot. Somewhere, deep inside, Harry knew they’d come here.
“It’s okay,” Harry says, setting the book on the coffee table and turning to hug him, worried. “We’re together now, right?”
“I don’t think I like the telly,” he frowns, and Harry’s stomach flips.
“You can. Harry, you don’t even…” Draco’s crying now, sobbing, knuckles white around the bars of his cell. “You could get away with it. They let you bring your wand in without even asking, didn’t they? Just say you were getting rid of the last living Death Eater, and they’ll pardon you. They’ll fucking applaud. So just do it!”
“You feel s-so good,” Harry continues, rhythm steady as he fucks onto Malfoy’s cock. “I could—I could come from this, I—”
“Yes,” Harry admits, guilt creeping into his chest.
“Maybe,” Potter says, sounding rueful. Then he sighs, dropping his arms from around Draco to stretch.
“Are you sure?” Malfoy asks him, and his voice is steady but his posture betrays his nervousness, the way he's sitting a bit hunched over on the edge of the bed next to Harry. They're in the Room of Requirement, mended over the summer for all intents and purposes, though if Harry thinks about it hard enough he can still smell the faint scent of fire. Tonight, the room has made itself small and cozy, with a bed and a nightstand and a curious cupboard that neither of them has dared to venture into.
If it had been Ron at the door, Harry might’ve feigned sleep, but Hermione might have something to tell him about Draco. So even though his face is still puffy from crying, he croaks out, “Yeah, come in.”
” Draco stares at her incredulously, suddenly feeling all warm at the thought of Potter maybe someday walking up and—no, no. It’s not going to happen. Even if Astoria keeps muddling around in their affairs, the chance that Potter would actually make a move on him again are incredibly low—heated looks in the middle of work be damned.
“Hullo,” Hermione says, putting a bit of corn pudding on her plate. “Malfoy,” she says in greeting, nodding her head.
“That doesn’t make it any better,” Harry says, briefly distracted. “I am sorry, you know.”
There was no way anyone would ever approve.
“I called him Harry,” Draco says softly. “Harry Potter. I pretended we were friends for years and years.”
Harry feels more tired than normal when he goes home that night. He heads to bed early, hoping to get a bit of extra sleep, but when he closes his eyes, all he can see is Malfoy’s face, the way he’d looked when he’d smiled yesterday.
sleeping?” Harry asks with a scowl. What a hypocrite.
Draco bites his lip, eyes bright, taking Harry in. “Would you want that?”
“It’s nothing,” Potter says, averting his eyes.
Potter smiles at him then, that unreadable spark back in his eyes. “Huh. Is that what you dream about?”
“You are,” Draco says, and then slaps a hand over his mouth. “You’re really—fuck. See, I can’t stop myself. I can’t
Anything is better than that.
“Oh, I don’t watch,” Astoria says. “There’s a waiting area that I usually sit in—quite nice, actually, there’s a masseuse down there too. But I wanted to show you this, because I just thought that you might not believe me if I said that I honestly don’t mind you having sex with him.” She gestures at Malfoy. “I might encourage it, even.”
Draco swallows and complies, and then he almost wishes he didn’t, because the sight of Potter naked in front of him is almost too much. Potter’s hand is on his ankle—they can’t stop touching even now, and they’re going to touch even more.
Harry swallows as he tries to imagine how it would be if Malfoy
wand, and that’s the window of opportunity Harry needs to knock him to the floor—
Draco gasps in relief, but at the same time, his gut starts churning. “Fuck,” he says. “It was probably something hidden in Neville’s fan mail.”
Draco’s cheeks are pink. “Ah,” he says, stepping back and going to grab the box of pasta. “Well.”
And he doesn’t.
we do, Harry,” Hermione replied once when he said something to that effect. “You’re my—our—best friend.”
But then Malfoy started slowly shaking his head. “I have no idea why the hell I’m telling you this, but I’m frightened…” he cleared his throat. “…of Azkaban, you know. The dementors... My father told me stories. He’s there now, and I never want to be…” Malfoy’s gaze looked wild, frantic, caught between the life of a refugee and that of a criminal. Harry was struck by the intensity, the sadness of it, and somehow he thought that he understood.
Draco’s breath hitches, affection throbbing in his chest, and he turns his head to kiss him.
“Bonding, you mean?” Harry asks.
He gets it now, he thinks. Malfoy just wants to feel connected to another human being—just what Harry’s wanted for months and months.
As much as he wants Potter to love him, he’s not a fool enough to think that he’s more important than the war itself. But that doesn’t stop him from ignoring the lurch of guilt and curling his arms around Potter anyway.
“Fine,” Potter says. “I’m going to go do my paperwork.”
Every now and then, Malfoy’s eyes lift to meet his, and Harry feels a brief touch of Malfoy’s magic sliding over his skin.
—come like this?”
“You know exactly what I’m talking about.”
“Just tell her we’re dating,” Potter says after a pause, conveniently right when Draco has decided it’s safe to begin eating his curry again.
Draco pauses. “Actually…” He looks Potter up and down, noting the way Potter is most definitely hardening in his pants, and thinks briefly of Potter wanking off in front of him. His mouth goes dry.
It’s the first time he’s said it aloud.
Harry digs his nails into his palms and nods. “You don’t want me,” he says quietly. “I get it.”
They shouldn’t have gone to Diagon. No, Draco should have left for France with his mother. Harry shouldn’t have forced him to stay...
Draco eats even though he’s not hungry, watching the Muggles lounge or socialize around him. Many of them are using devices he thinks are called computers, but these are smaller than he’s seen before, shaped like a chair with no arms or legs. It’s so odd that they can stare at these things for so long without getting bored—Draco thinks he’d get far too restless.
Draco nods, and then he shifts closer, pressing his face into Harry’s shoulder. “Potter?” he says.
“They think I did it,” Draco muttered bitterly from beside him.
Right after Potter hired him, Draco had ever so carefully uprooted one of the trees from the Manor garden, keeping a safe distance from the bowtruckles as he planted it in hope of starting a small grove of his own.
“Oh, you will,” Malfoy says airily, and then his hands briefly disappear.
A scroll is spelled to the top of the mirror, and Draco detaches it, unrolling it the furl of creamy parchment and walking over to the lit torch so he can read the words. He skims over most of it, because really, he’s only looking for one thing—
“She says it’s addictive,” Harry says. The thought scares him. The only way his life could possibly be worse right now would be if he were to go and get addicted to some drug.
But Draco can’t let it go just yet. “I just want to know… why?” He gestures at Potter’s answer. “Why that rating?”
“W-what?” Draco says. He’s sitting there, frozen, mouth agape as tears trickle down his face. “Potter, no… no. You said—you said you d-didn’t, you always said that you weren’t—in love.”
Draco groans again, and he licks his lips, taking a deep breath. “I bought a dildo recently so I could fuck myself with it while I think of you.”
“Just don’t, okay?
Draco groans. He almost tells Potter to do away with the prep and just fuck him already, but then Potter adds another finger and the stretch is just painful enough to shut him up. He somehow didn’t think of how hideously vulnerable he would feel, on his knees below Potter, Potter’s hand moving in him with soft, wet sounds. He’s glad Potter can’t see his face.
“You didn’t cover me up last night,” the mirror remarks, speaking in its own voice for a change. “Interesting.”
He tears his hand away, tears springing to his eyes. “You’re supposed to be dead!” he croaks wildly. “You can’t—you can’t be here, you can’t!”
He stands there until Potter follows him a few minutes later, coming up beside Draco where he’s leaning on the railing and trying not to drown. And Draco wishes he would just go
“Really,” Hermione says, sounding surprised. “Oh,
Sliding out of bed, he picks up his wand from the bedside table and lights one of the torches. Then he goes to where the box is leaning up against the wall next to his wardrobe, staring at it for a moment.
Potter’s
to Potter—gets a whole lot harder to stop noticing.
“To feel... accepted,” Draco says quietly.
Draco leans in and whispers, “It’s the easiest explanation.”
He swallows nervously, pushing open the doors anyway and heading straight to what looks like the reception desk. He wonders if he should’ve Glamoured himself, but by then it’s too late, as the woman standing behind the desk has already spotted him.
He trails off when he realizes that Potter’s gone very, very pale.
“I was wrong,” Potter admits, and Draco opens his eyes in surprise. “You’re nothing like you were during the war, or before it.”
—he remembers how it felt like the world was ending when Will left. It’s not like that anymore, thank Merlin. And it’ll be okay for Malfoy too—right?
Harry’s embarrassed when his cock immediately throbs. “You better learn quite a lot of charms to keep us from getting caught, then, if you plan on shagging me in public.”
“Because it’s bloody awful,” Malfoy spits out, turning away from the canvas.
And somewhere in there, they fell in love.
“I did, a bit,” Harry says. “But I still thought a bit about having sex with you. Although I didn’t really know I was into blokes yet, which is why I guess I tried not to think of it too much—but even then, I still did follow you around an awful lot.”
leave. I could be sleeping right now.”
The guilt ate him alive, but he couldn’t lie. Not to Draco.
But he needs to win the war more.
want to fuck me?”
Harry leans over to hug him, and Ron and Hermione both look overjoyed. “Blimey,” Ron says, shaking his head. “You two are both geniuses.”
“Oh come
“Well, it’s certainly not Ginny you were smiling about,” Hermione says primly, somehow managing to make him flush without even looking up from her paper—which is ridiculous, anyway, as he’s not crushing on anyone. He’s
“Potter,” Draco says, a slightly amused expression on his face—“We don’t...
“Granger,” Malfoy says, and Harry can feel the nervousness radiating off of him.
Huffing a sigh, Draco puts his wand to his temple, envisioning Potter wet and naked in the shower, taking hold of the memory drawing it out of his head. He drags it over to the mirror surface, and the memory briefly pools at his wandtip before seeming to melt into the mirror, forming a thin glaze over the whole thing that goes transparent and disappears not a moment later.
,” he says, even though he’s already turning, moving closer to Harry and pressing his face into Harry’s shoulder. “Gross.”
“So you sit here and...” Harry waves a hand. “Wait for people.”
Sometimes he wonders what would happen if he simply showed up at Draco’s flat. He’d probably get punched again.
“Well, not really,” Draco says, shrugging one shoulder. “I mean, he’s the hot one, isn’t he?”
Then he tries to pretend he didn’t just wonder that.
All too soon, the waiter returns with their food, and Malfoy pulls his hand away to eat. Harry has to admit that he’s again pleased with Malfoy’s choice of restaurants, and Malfoy spends the rest of the meal looking smug he bites into his hamburger.
From far away, Harry hears music.
He sighs, leaning his head back against the doorframe and closing his eyes.
But despite Draco’s protesting, Harry’s already closing the door.
Harry supposed that was probably true. “Sorry, it was just… you know,” he flushed. It had been Draco, Draco surrounding him and holding him and loving him that made everything go so hazy.
“I liked it too much,” Draco admits. “I want to do it again, but you don’t even like me and I—” He snaps his mouth shut because Merlin, now he’s rambling.
“Harder, damnit,” he mutters, grabbing at Potter’s hips, trying to stave off the emotions overflowing in his chest. But Potter just shakes his head, and Draco has to look away from him then because Potter’s expression is so
Malfoy rolls his eyes, but there’s still a faint flush in his cheeks. “Whatever.”
“I’d like that, okay?” Draco says, and he briefly looks around the room, probably to ensure no one’s watching before focusing back in on Potter.
Draco stares at the paper. Then he reads it again, just to be sure.
The look only lingers for a moment before Potter’s face hardens again. “Stop what?”
“But I do,” Harry says, and it’s true—it’s heady and warm in his chest, his throat. He has to laugh then at the conflicted expression on Draco’s face. “What?”
“So?” Draco frowns at him.
“They just debriefed the whole building about it, actually,” Malfoy says, setting down his utensils. “Apparently it’s serious enough that all of the hospital staff are finally considered ‘need to know personnel’.”
“More,” Harry gasps out, pulling at the fastener on Draco’s robes. “Please, I need—I
Then he turns and leaves, tears streaming down his cheeks, before he can face what he’s done.
“I figure it might get too warm otherwise,” Draco says, standing. “Is that okay?”
“Welp, here we are!” Zeller guides them into a small meeting room, a large table dominating the space and comfortable-looking office chairs surrounding it. The window charms are set to be pleasantly sunny, and overall Harry would be excited to work here if only he wasn’t so bloody concerned right now. “You can take these,” she continues, handing Harry the clipboard. “Both of you, please fill out these surveys as thoroughly as possible, one for every instance the Amortentia was taken—feel free to take as long as you need, and let me know when you’re done!”
Draco groans, because of
“All right,” Harry says, retreating to his chair. “So?”
Draco’s pulse skyrockets. “Anything,” he says, leaning back to let Potter kiss his neck again. “Everything.”
Draco blinks irritably at him. “Yes,” he says, because he thought that was a given.
“For the last time, Malfoy, this is a suite, not just a room. We only have to share the common kitchen and living area and the loo. They said it was for ease of training, anyhow.”
Harry goes to him then, kisses him softly, and says, “I’ll Floo Hermione.”
Harry stumbled forward, falling back into Draco’s arms. He couldn’t stop crying. God. Draco.
Draco never imagined they’d make it this far—at worst he thought they’d continue fighting, resenting the bond until the day one of them dies. But mostly in this moment they just kiss, and then halfway through kissing they fall asleep, and Draco wakes up in the morning hard but still insists that both of them use a teeth cleaning charm before they kiss again.
“No,” Malfoy snaps. Then he sighs, bringing his free hand up to rub at his temple. “Merlin. This is impossible.”
It’s two breaths before Potter says, “Okay,” sounding tentative even he resumes his slow thrusts, and Draco lets his hands fall back to the bed.
And then, just as past-Draco turns to look at the bar so he can make an excuse about wanting to go get a drink, past-Potter leans in to kiss him.
Nonetheless, Harry draws his wand.
“No—‘s fine,” Harry says, his voice coming out strangled, because he absolutely won’t wank to this if Astoria’s here. So she can’t leave, because he doesn’t
“Of course. Because you never think,” Draco says drily.
Inside is a plain leather banded bracelet with a metal clasp. “It’s charmed with something Hermione taught me,” Harry says. “I dunno if it’ll do anything, but you should try it and see anyway.”
He lands at the Manor.
Harry nods, giving him a bleak smile, and motions toward the other sofa. Draco nods and follows him over, and they don’t sit quite as close as Ron and Hermione are, but Draco doesn’t let go of his hand either—rather, he seems to be squeezing it more tightly, and it takes Harry a moment to realize Draco really is frightened.
Ron shoves his hands in his pockets. “I figured we may as well be civil, since you’re dating—er. Shagging Harry.”
Harry clenches his fingers into fists. “Malfoy—you don’t… you don’t have to do this,” he says, his breath hitching as that slick finger returns, pressing more insistently at his hole.
“No,” Harry says, turning his head to smile weakly at him. “It was perfect.”
It’s just stupid Potter with his stupid volatility, baiting Draco until he has no choice but to react.
What?—anxiety surged through his system, and he gritted his teeth. What the fuck was Draco getting at?
“I don’t know what to think,” Draco responds truthfully. “I’m still angry at you.”
He won’t have to hate himself every time the potion fades away, hate himself for spilling his secrets to someone who used to be his worst enemy.
Harry swallows thickly, feeling his prick start to swell in his trousers as he thinks about it. “You were—you were getting fingered, and then he—he fucked you.”
“Sorry,” Potter says, in an absolute first.
ready, really, but he’d wanted this to last so he let Potter keep going past the point where he’d normally stop. But he wants Potter’s cock in him too, wants to see how it really feels—the dildo is a poor substitute, he’s sure. And Potter’s going to come inside him, isn’t he?
“Out with it, Potter, I don’t have all nigh—”
“Draco?” Blaise says cautiously, interrupting Draco’s train of thought, and Draco realizes with no small amount of embarrassment that he’s been staring at the package in front of him for almost a solid minute. “Sorry to pick on your love life,” Blaise says, sounding worried. “I didn’t think it was that much of a sore topic.”
But he does anyway.
“One thing, Harry…” Draco spoke again, gaze piercing him suddenly. “I-I… I’m sorry. I lied before. I’m… I’m really happy that you love me. Even though you’ll… y-you’ll be sad, but… You’ll lose me either way.”
Harry found himself wearily climbing to the sixth floor a few minutes before ten o’clock, as per a succinctly worded owl that Malfoy had sent earlier that day. He wondered at the lack of people in the halls—he assumed it was because the celebration goers would mostly be retiring to bed now.
“Mal—Malfoy,
“Potter, I can practically hear you thinking,” Malfoy says, jolting Harry out of his thoughts. “Go to
Then, as quick and fleeting as a Snitch, she darts out of the room, closing the door behind her. She has no idea what she’s done, does she?
“You do too,” Potter says, snorting. “I feel like when it comes to routines we’re about as incompatible as it gets.”
Draco clears his throat.
to process some paperwork—”
And Draco is left sitting there, wondering what the hell they’re doing right now.
All the want and longing and the fact that Draco really fucking loves Harry Potter.
“You know I won’t tell,” Harry replies, unable to hide his anticipation. “Do it.”
“You can go ahead now,” he tells Draco, motioning to the shower, and Draco nods and heads into the loo, shutting the door behind him.
“Sorry.”
Harry’s stunned. “Really? But the dementors... they’re awful, and you had to—you were trapped there, you—”
“You—” Draco clicks his mouth shut, at a loss for words. “Potter, you’re mad.”
him that you’re trustworthy again, rather than just saying sorry.”
“Can you try to think about it at least? For me? I’ve been trying, you know, to heal and to be different, to be a person you’d actually want in your life.” Harry could feel Draco shaking his head. “I know I'm whining like a fucking baby, but… If it’s not me that’s the problem, then try. Please?” Draco asked, voice muffled.
“I was expecting my feelings to change,” Draco says. “But they didn’t.”
“Oh Draco... Remind me to thank Ginny,” Harry says, and then he smiles brighter than he has for a long while.
Grinning, Potter leans into him, pressing a kiss into his jaw. “It means I can look forward to falling in love with you—cuz then I get to hear you say it back.”
happen the rest of the night?” Draco asks as they steady themselves from exiting the Pensieve.
Even after close to six months, Draco still isn’t quite used to waking up with Harry in his bed. It’s always somewhat of a surprise, to blink his eyes open and feel Harry’s hands on him—and Harry’s hands are
Draco swallows thickly. “I just wanted to know… What did I
Slowly, without moving away, Malfoy reaches over and takes the book back, setting it on the desk. His chest is warm on Harry’s shoulder, firm through their robes, and God, Harry wants to
Hermione gives him a grateful smile. “Thank you,” she says sincerely. “I suppose I will go to bed, then. Could we meet tomorrow evening?”
out of character for Draco, isn’t it? “Which one?”
“I don’t think so?” Harry says, surprised. “I mean, besides, um, the fact that we’re—Draco and I, I mean—are sort of together now, but. I thought you knew that.”
Then why is sadness slowly starting to sting in his throat?
“Nope. I’ve decided I won’t tell you,” she says. “Now, would you do me a favor and go back to work? I really am very tired.”
“We can’t,” Harry says. “I need—I need us to talk about it.”
Harry yawned, still drowsy. “You’re not my enemy. You never were, Voldemort was.” Belatedly, he thought about what he had said, and realized that he actually believed his own words. It surprised him—he couldn’t remember ever having thought that about Malfoy before.
“That’s okay. I never really watched it anyway,” he mumbles, then covers Draco’s hand with his own.
Harry’s mind is still reeling from the fact that Malfoy’s just said all of that so casually. He wanted a response from him, and he’d certainly gotten it, but it’s had the unfortunate side effect of making him want Malfoy even more. His mouth has gone dry again, and he clears his throat in vain. “That’s still awful.”
The realization comes to him, and he sits back against the headboard, feeling almost numb with guilt. “You don’t... You don’t feel good about what we just did, do you?”
“I was being
“Well, maybe that’s because I’ve been working here for years without issue,” Draco points out. His head still hurts, and talking with Potter is only making it worse, but he promised Neville, so.
Potter’s eyes flash as he rubs his finger against Draco’s prostate again, again, and thank Merlin Draco thought to put silencing charms on every inch of the walls of his flat because he can’t stop himself from letting out an incoherent stream of moans.
Which is where they are now, in Potter’s memory, past-Draco looking very flustered as past-Potter walks up to him wearing only a skin-tight pair of leather trousers. Fucking Lovegood and her insistence that everyone be true to themselves and allow their attractions to be unfettered for that one day—not that Draco had
Of course the next moment, the mirror speaks, making Draco jump in fright. “Well,
Draco replays the moment in his mind immediately—he thinks if he lets the memory slip then he might accidentally convince himself it never happened. But no. They’d been holding hands as they came, and Potter had called him Draco.
“You can use them to light fires,” Harry explained. “I thought everyone knew that.”
His heart starts racing. Has someone Polyjuiced as Draco, just to calm Harry down? It’s a brilliant idea, maybe one of Hermione’s, although he wonders how they found out about him and Draco having been lovers. But now that he’s realized the truth, he feels uncomfortable with someone else in his bed, and he starts to shove away.
things about Draco. Like the way his hair glints in the light from the ceiling when he tilts his head a certain direction, or the way the edges of his lips prick into the tiniest of not-quite-smiles just before he’s about to laugh. And maybe he’s noticed these things before, but they all seem so much more
And... fuck. That’s loads different than just wanting to kiss him, Harry thinks as they enter the restaurant and ask for a table. Wanting to kiss him just means there’s chemistry between them, nothing more. But
“You’ve just been so upfront about it,” Draco tells him, finding Harry’s hand. He squeezes then, so hard it kind of hurts, but Harry lets him hold on, lets him anchor himself. “You knew what you wanted.”
doing it again,” Harry tells him, crossing his arms. “The Amortentia, right? No.”
“Merlin,” he says, panting a moment later. “That was—that was...”
They break apart.
It’s a moment later when Potter puts his hand on Draco’s arm, warm and calloused, and all the thoughts fall out of Draco’s head. “Draco,” Potter says, quiet and serious. “It’s not just you. This is hard for me too, okay?”
He makes the mistake of turning around again. Potter isn’t there, of course, but the mirror sounds just like Potter,
“Potter,” he says—a gasp, really—and looks away as the tears start to slip down his cheeks.
Malfoy nods slowly. “Fine, then. Well. I suppose I just thought we could… talk?”
“No,” Harry says, hiding the slow smile growing on his face. “Hermione’s the one who’s always right.”
He’s absolutely fucking aimless without her.
A while later, after they've long since lapsed into silence, Harry aims a small, tired smile at Four and says, “Thanks for this.”
the one who climbed on top of me,” Harry accuses as he sits up too.
“I can’t,” Potter says, and then he squeezes his eyes shut. “I can’t do this anymore.”
He wonders if this is being brave, or if in the end, he’s still no more than a coward—if this is selfishness or selflessness, idiocy or strength. No matter what he does, he's still running away.
Harry lets out a small gasp.
And now it seems Potter has saved them. The only plants out of the whole damned warehouse.
as Draco slowly fills him.
Part of Draco wants to laugh, to say, ‘Ha! I was right.’
It’s more honesty than Harry had been expecting. He plays with the handle of his teacup, shifting it back and forth over the surface of the table. “Was it bad—I mean, did you fight or anything?”
Maybe he does care a bit about that last part.
“I’d forgotten,” Draco admits, biting his lip.
“I don’t know if I’ve ever seen you really smile before,” Harry muses, hissing as Draco dribbles lube down the crack of his arse.
He wishes it were true, so much it threatens to crush him, but he doesn’t have a tomorrow. He barely has a today.
Draco swallows back a sudden, absurd lump of emotion in his throat—he
fine. He hates that part of him still feels warm when he hears Draco’s voice—he hates even more that Draco can tell how nervous he is, hates that he
Malfoy growled, exasperated. “That’s different… shut up, Potter.”
“Of course not,” Draco says roughly, pushing Potter’s hands away and yanking the shirt off over his head. “What kind of question is that, anyway? Love is for fools.”
“What does that even
When he’s done speaking, McGonagall makes one last note on her clipboard. “Very well,” she says. “Your choice of topic is satisfactory—but prepare better for our next meeting, do you understand? And don’t go relying on Miss Granger for all of your research, either.”
They’re never getting out of this.
Maybe, just maybe, he still has a chance to fix this.
Ron had accepted the offer from the Aurors right after the war, the offer to enter an expedited training program without his N.E.W.T.s. He begged Harry to join him, but Harry just... couldn’t.
Draco doesn’t love him.
It’s then that Draco notices he’s holding a pair of brooms.
After a while, Harry rolls off of Draco, trying to catch his breath. He looks up at the sky, partially covered by the trees at the edge of their makeshift pitch. The wind, ever playful, is shifting the leaves artfully about. The sun alternates between hiding and blinding him, and he’s content.
“Where’d you go?” a low voice asks from beside him, and Harry jumps and turns to find Malfoy right there.
“But I’ve finished that,” Harry says bitterly, the self-loathing he’s been trying so hard to beat back rising like magma in a volcano. “I’m finished with my only job, and now I have nothing left except Ron and Hermione and a whole lot of people who don’t see me, who don’t understand at
Harry lets out a strangled moan. “Okay.”
to her. He’s made no real progress in healing, has he? His only real coping mechanisms have been ignoring the fuck out of how much he misses him and the fucking Amortentia.

going to leave a mark, isn’t he?
It’s also kind of everything he’s wanted from a sexual encounter. Not to mention that it’s
Harry’s momentarily struck by how much he loves him,

Harry comes first, groaning, pressing his lips to Draco’s mouth, his jaw, his cheek. But he doesn’t even pause after, pulling out and sliding down Draco’s body to suck him down again, making him cry out—“
When she
“So what if I am?” Harry mutters.
He’s been doing a good job of forcing himself to ignore him, he thinks, but that hasn’t made Harry want him any less.
“This doesn’t change the fact that you still need to make progress on your capstone topic,” Hermione tells him matter-of-factly as he sits down. “I’ll help you find more books once you decide on a different one, okay?”
It seems like Malfoy really has changed. Not enough to make him any less of a bristly prick, but certainly for the better.
He really, really should.
Draco sucks in a breath. “I’m so sorry,” he says. “I never wanted you to know. I’m sorry I lied, but I really, really didn’t want to tell you—and it seems it didn’t fucking matter anyway because I’ve already managed to hurt you, haven’t I?"
there, weren’t you?”
“F-fuck, that’s—you’re brilliant,” Potter says, sounding shaky as he leans down and presses a kiss to Draco’s back.
“But,” Draco says, “You have other things to care about.” Like winning the war, like offing Voldemort, like protecting everyone else he loves from people like Draco. Things more important than the two of them, more important than Potter’s own life.
At least there were no nightmares last night—just thoughts of this new, strange Malfoy, who doesn’t want to kill him or punch him or even sling insults at him like he once did; one who somehow actually wants to talk to Harry.
Harry opens his eyes, tracing them over Draco’s sharp features. His hair has only started growing back after the fire incident, back when he had to cut it shorter than usual to fix the damage.
Potter nods slowly. “Okay,” he says.
“Yeah? Well, so am I,” Harry says, trying and failing not to be offended.
Draco bites his lip. “Harry,” he says quietly. “Thank you for giving me the choice.”
Harry pushes Draco’s hand away, startled. “Why not?”
Potter is, how selfless and giving and kind. And it’s not fair that he always, always extends some of that to Draco, even despite their awful past at Hogwarts. It’s not fair that he’s the only person who even spared a look at Draco’s job application after their eighth year, when everyone snubbed him for the mark on his arm; that he hired him without a second thought and then somehow proceeded to ignore their past treat him as if they’d been friends for ages.
“Malfoy,” Potter says, brow crinkling. “She can come over, really. It’s fine.”
Harry looks at him, eyes half-lidded, dazed and breathless. “Huh?”
Just for a moment, Harry lets himself stop worrying, and he shuts his eyes and curls up in Malfoy’s arms.
So they’re cuddling, relaxing, their outer robes shucked off as they sit together, and Harry—Harry is comfortable, like this, in his ex-enemy’s arms. He
He feels almost content with the day, all the way up until he receives Potter’s owl that evening.
It takes a moment for it to open, and Harry curses every second of it, feeling like his spine is prickling with the discomfort of being in this room once again. But finally, the door opens, revealing a very short, very ancient-looking wizard, and Harry allows himself to breathe a sigh of relief.
“No, I—” Harry sighs. “I am. I shouldn’t have said that.”
Draco—Malfoy, now—Malfoy spreads him open again, making a humming sound as he inspects the space between Harry’s legs. “I can’t believe all it took to get you hard was to take your clothes off,” he mumbles delightedly. “You must really be gagging for it, Potter.”
“Oh?” Malfoy says, looking pleased in an almost predatory way, and Harry’s breath hitches. “Do elaborate.”
“Well, have you got any other ideas?” he asks, slowly starting to realize how bonkers this is.
But it doesn’t. He’s fully at Malfoy’s whim, it seems, and he leans on Malfoy's shoulder with no resistance, Merlin—
“Potter, what
And Malfoy keeps looking at him with something like warmth in his expression. Harry
Like last night.
“Hmm,” Draco says, wondering why he hadn’t known that before. He knows she doesn’t want children, and he would never want her to bear them—he’s fairly certain the strain would kill her. He’s known that she identifies as asexual as well, but he supposes he’s never pressed her on the particulars.
Strangely, the Hat pauses, seeming to eye McGonagall—now Headmistress—before opening its mouth again. McGonagall’s eyebrows are arched as high as Harry’s seen them, and a whisper of confusion drifts through Harry’s mind. “
“Look, you’d be fine if I was anyone else, right?” he asked.
He’s just… so tired. Tired of holding back, he supposes.
“Hullo,” Draco says, yawning as he lets the curtain drop closed behind him. “I apologize for last night. I know that was a bit—abrupt.”
The moment his fingers touch Malfoy’s shoulder, memories assault him—taking the Oath, standing side-by-side, back when he only knew Malfoy as Trainee Four—supporting each other. Steadying each other.
He thinks about kissing Potter, and what it might feel like to just throw his papers down one day in their office and just press Potter up against the wall.
“Just, um, figured something out with Charms, see?” Harry says, picking up the closest thing he can reach on his worktable, which happens to be a regular Muggle key from who knows what project.
“Sorry,” Harry mumbles, voice hoarse. He clears his throat, then wonders when he began apologizing to someone who can’t even stand to be in the same room with him.
And only a short while later, Harry watched them take Draco away. McGonagall couldn't do anything. Kingsley couldn't do anything.
“Well,” Hermione says, mouth working as she attempts to settle on what to say. “It’s hard to tell without knowing exactly what’s going on, but. Have you apologized?”
“Hm,” Harry grunts. They sink into silence, and Harry idly picks up one of the books sitting in front of them. The cover is so faded he can’t read it, but he flips it open and attempts to begin deciphering the text anyway.
They sit up, and Harry immediately grabs his wand and casts a
He toys with the vial. “I could do it anyway.”
Potter spends every night with Draco, but somehow Draco feels even more alone than when he was by himself.
“Because I bet you could if you tried hard enough.”
Draco buries his face into Harry’s shoulder as Harry leans against the pillows, and Harry shivers, feeling trembly and exhausted. At any moment, Draco could change his mind. Harry has to be okay with that.
“What?” Malfoy says, crossing his arms. “You’re staring at me funny.”
Harry is absolutely fuming by the time they’re supposed to meet for the portrait, and he stalks up to the classroom Malfoy paints in. He’s angry, angry at Malfoy, but he’s angrier at himself for even
, he was not Confunded, and this was definitely not just a pity fuck, and, “I love you, Draco, can’t you fucking see it? I
,” Astoria says, grinning wickedly. “I wrote a room number as well. Come there tonight at eight—if you’re curious, that is. About Draco. Or ignore me, whichever suits you.”
Since he stopped feeling like he had a place in the world.
It won’t hurt to ask, right?
Harry’s thoughts fly to Lucius Malfoy, sentenced to Azkaban for life, and he has the sudden impulse to reach out and comfort Malfoy. He restrains himself, unsure if Malfoy would even appreciate it, and instead twists his hands in his lap. “For what it’s worth, I hope you don’t get sick.”
Harry rocks slowly inside of him, stretching him open and shattering Draco apart.
, really, except that nothing in this damned dusty hellhole is helping get any closer to figuring out Astoria’s curse.
“Draco’s here,” Harry calls out, leading Draco into the living room the next evening.
Harry raises his eyebrows. “And what would that look like, exactly?”
“You don’t want to hear them,” Draco says sharply. “They’re. They would be too forceful.”
Draco’s eyes widen. “Potter…”
, the great Harry Potter would
“You too, Malfoy. But… really. Truce? For now, anyway?”
Fleeting images of the summer past, of seeing Malfoy around the castle, of working with him to rebuild the wards and taking silent lunches with him—all of them spin through Harry’s mind. He thinks of how they’d been paired together because most of the others gave Malfoy the cold shoulder, and Harry just didn’t care. He would’ve preferred Hermione and Ron, of course, but they’d been off tracking down Hermione’s parents.
He walks out of his room, moving quickly now. Nothing is amiss in the dining room or the large kitchen—the stove and oven are both off. He looks through the entryway, but there’s nothing of interest in there, and the rest of the Manor he doesn’t even bother checking. He’d blocked off all of the other rooms years ago so he didn’t have to think about the horrors they once held.
Potter definitely seems surprised at that, but his face brightens, and they stumble to their feet and make their way to the Floo.
They’re eating lunch at work later that week, and Neville keeps shooting them weird looks that Draco is trying to ignore. Fortunately, Potter doesn’t have the same sensibility.
,” he says imploringly, but she just shakes her head and laughs.
“Good,” Draco says, and starts to pull his robes off.
“I know.”
She is his mother, after all.
But he brings the vial to his lips and swallows a dose of the potion, and then he hands Malfoy the other half.
“McGonagall wouldn’t do that!” Harry put down a shrunken box, turning to face Malfoy with his arms crossed.
All of a sudden, he feels like his chest is splitting in half. He sinks to his knees merely a foot from the bed, tears welling up in his eyes.
Draco raises an eyebrow. “Last time we fucked up a case?”
A burst of flame erupted from the wand, and he didn’t even flinch. He held the spell, watching it diligently as it filled the room with light. Harry could feel the heat of it; he had to shield his eyes from the brightness.
and Draco—Draco can’t.
and that at least has to count for something. “Anyway, I hate clubs,” he complains. They’re too loud and crowded and the music is always weird stuff he’s never heard of.
“I—fuck, sorry,” he says, embarrassed. God, he’s going to have to look Draco in the eye later, and Draco will know that Harry knew that he was getting off—
Malfoy nods. “I do, yes. Why?”
“It’s stupid,” Draco says. “It’s all stupid.”
“Again?” Draco says, raising his eyebrows.
“Oh,” Harry says, his cheeks going warm. “I—er...”
They scowled at each other, both breathing heavily from all the shouting. It was Harry who gave into the urge to shove Malfoy. Soon they were rolling on the floor, unbridled anger filling Harry with the urge to embed his knuckles in Malfoy’s face. But Malfoy’s stupid limbs were too sharp, and Harry kept getting elbowed in the gut until he finally relented and rolled away.
Harry tries to call him ‘Draco’ just once, but Malfoy flinches and looks so terrified that Harry has to take it back. He doesn’t try again, after that.
He’s not sure how he’s getting his schoolwork done. He expects that Hermione has something to do with it, although when he reads back over his assignments, the content is surprisingly familiar despite sometimes not remembering having written it.
, it’s not, but—
Harry comes. He climbs onto the bed to straddle Malfoy and kisses him, and he hates that it really does feel like the last time, like all of their walls are down, all the barriers they had in place to keep this from meaning too much suddenly gone.
“Potter, what are you
Slowly, Harry feels the tension leave his limbs. “Oh,” he says, and he thinks he’s starting to get it.
They look over their menus, and then the waiter comes and takes their order. Malfoy does indeed order a burger, which makes Harry laugh as he puts in his own order for fish and chips.
,” and then try to short him on the payment for it, but if Draco’s good at one thing it’s getting his way in an argument.
“We’ll fight if we’re together, you know.” Draco says. “I expect we’ll row something fierce. Doesn’t that count as hurting me?”
Distrust prickles on Harry’s skin—or maybe it’s just the Glamour he’s wearing, as he stands in the shadows of the Muggle alleyway. He doesn’t even fully know why he’s here, if he’s being honest. Ron’s going to chew him out if he ever realizes what he’s done, and Hermione might just hex him—
The aura of the motel room has changed when Harry walks in for the final time. Malfoy is sitting on the bed, pale, paler even than normal. It’s almost as if he knows what’s happening.
, Draco,” Harry says, distraught, his chest heaving.
The pleasure comes in waves, and he shudders through it, gasping. Above him, Potter moans and fucks into him faster, and Draco can feel Potter’s cock start to pulse as he comes too, moments after Draco does.
So maybe Malfoy is dangerous and maybe he’s still cruel. Harry wants him anyway. Malfoy’s not even using his vampire coercion on him, but Harry couldn’t walk away from this if he tried.
“Will you go to sleep now?” Malfoy asks, sounding just as tired and annoyed as when he walked into the room—but there’s something else now, just the tiniest hint of fondness.
“...no Houses any longer...” “...hoping Mary would be Sorted with us!” “...what do we do?” Snatches of conversation swirl around Harry’s head, and he takes it all in. For once, everyone around him looks just as misplaced as Harry feels. Almost like he fits in.
“What is this again?” Harry asks Hermione, squinting down at his class schedule as they sit with the rest of the eighth years in the Transfiguration classroom. “
But then Potter kisses him, crowding him backwards until Draco’s knees hit the bed, biting at his lip until Draco’s gasping with want, and he forgets that thought entirely.
“Shut up,” Draco grumbles.
so much to him when they’re obviously such a volatile combination.
And one emotion, love, did swell above the buzzing in Harry’s ears, protecting him from the awful truth of what he was about to do. “I’ll n-never forget you,” he said, trembling, wetness dripping from his eyes and nose. He felt like he was drowning.
like this, but it’s so much to handle all at once. His senses feel overloaded, and all at once it’s almost

He feels… nothing.
leave?”
“You don’t care that much, hmm?” Potter asks.
“Coming, boss,” Draco says, snickering when Potter throws a glare at him. At least he can still get a rise out of Potter, given that Potter
But Potter doesn’t seem to notice.
But no. That’s ridiculous. Even his reckless streak isn’t enough to push him to go there unprepared.
with me.”
“Only because you said please,” Harry quips, and adds another finger, and Draco spreads his legs further as Potter stretches him open, groaning.
“I couldn’t sleep at all last night,” Malfoy admits, again looking miserable. That explains his appearance today, at least. “I just—I couldn’t stop thinking of—fuck. Never mind. We can do shorter.”
“I would be rather annoyed if you had,” Draco says, and Harry laughs. Then Draco holds up his wrist, the one with the bracelet on it. “I suppose I should take this off, then.”
But Draco shakes his head. “No need,” he says. “It’ll just be paperwork in the first few days anyhow. You can visit when that’s all done.”
Draco stares at him for a moment, and then he laughs. “That sounds bloody weird.”
Harry blinks at her, frightened. He’s not honestly sure he can even answer, as per the Unspeakable Oath.
But he was forced to pick the other parts of himself up and just keep going.
“But…” Harry swallowed a sob.
have Harry—but inevitably, those nights will have to end someday.
Malfoy gave him a derisive, ‘are you serious?’ eyebrow raise. “That’s a load of bollocks, Potter. It won’t work. Too much history between us.”
“I used to,” Harry says sheepishly. “It’s just...” He trails off, not sure how to explain it.
he wanted it. He hasn’t wanted anyone other than Potter for so long that he’s forgotten what it feels like, but he can’t exactly tell Potter that without giving away the secret he’s held tightly in his chest all these years, the one he meant to take to the grave so he could save himself from the obvious ridiculing Potter would give him if he knew—
Harry presses his face to Malfoy’s neck and blinks away the tears that want to come, because he needs Malfoy too.
Feelings rushed around in his body, buzzing and tingling as he tried to pin them down. He knew he was
And Harry’s surprised to realize that at some point he stopped feeling embarrassed sitting here. Somehow all his vulnerability has fallen away, replaced by a sense of wonder as Malfoy’s spells flash against the canvas.
“…magic… with grief… buried under it…”
“Potter,” Malfoy says in surprise, before Harry’s even stepped all the way out. Harry shakes the dizziness of Floo travel off, looking to find Malfoy sitting on the couch, his eyes wide as he looks up at Harry. He’s in another white dress shirt, a book about some sort of herbs on his lap. An image flickers into Harry’s mind, of what it would be like to spend the night curled up here with him, reading some book or another in comfortable silence.
,” Draco growls, glaring at him hotly.
“Even if that were always true, it doesn’t mean I’m not scared,” Harry tells him, and he cares so much about him in that moment that his chest goes tight. “You’re so important to me,” he says then, instead of saying something mad like
Draco’s face suddenly goes pale. “You wouldn’t.”
Harry is not all right. He’s just choked on his stew, and he coughs loudly for several moments before he manages to calm down. “Sorry, I—just. Never mind. Keep going.”
touch it now, fuck. So he does, down onto his knees and taking it into his mouth.
” Draco cries out, and all at once his orgasm hits, sending waves of pleasure through him that rock him to the bone. In the mirror, Potter’s face contorts, and then he’s groaning too, shudders wracking his body.
Oh. Well, then.
“Thank goodness,” Hermione says, taking it when he hands it to her and uncorking the vial. She swallows it down, grimacing at the taste, and sets the vial down next to the sink for washing. “I’ve put the kettle on. Tea should be ready in a moment.”
“Fuck,” he mumbles, half on accident, and he’s hoping it was quiet enough that Draco didn’t hear it, but then Draco pulls back to look at him.
Fuck. Harry gasps at first, but the too-sharp sensation quickly wears off, until he’s left groaning as Draco’s fingers twist and curl against his prostate. Draco finger fucks him like that, meeting his eyes until Harry’s so caught up in it he has to squeeze them shut, working him up until he starts to get nervous he’s going to come way earlier than he wants to. “Okay—okay. I’m ready,” Harry gasps out. He can’t wait any longer.
Harry mulls her words over, Vanishing the letter once he’s done with it. An eye for an eye, she said. And… oh.
Harry’s heart pounds. “I dunno either,” he says. “I’ve never—never mated before.”
Oh. Merlin. “That’s awful,” Harry says, aghast. “I didn’t know.”
Harry stares at the letter, reading it over again as if that’ll somehow make the words change.
“No, you’re
“You let me.”
Harry’s about five strokes in, pressing inside Draco in tandem with his hand, when Draco cries out and comes—“Oh,
He doesn’t even think Malfoy knows it, but somehow, he transformed into something of a comfort when Harry needed it the most. And Harry’s grateful for that.
“Never mind,” Malfoy says, shaking his head. “It’s fine.”
“I do like you,” Potter repeats.
But it’s not helping that Potter’s grinning at him, undeniable desire in his eyes, as he fucks his fingers wantonly into Draco’s arse.
The sun sets.
Potter gives a short laugh. “Er. You, I guess—you asked me to come home with you. But I kissed you before that.”
“Tomorrow,” he addresses Potter out of the blue, trying to make his voice sharp—“Tomorrow you shouldn’t come back.”
“You sure?” Malfoy says, aloud this time.
“Magic works in odd, stupid ways,” Malfoy mumbles. “She doesn’t want to be alive without him, awful as he was. So she’s stopped casting, and her magic is shriveling up. And when your magic dies, well...” He shrugs. “It’s so tightly wound up into our systems that it’ll kill you.”
“Do you want it?” Malfoy asks, gesturing at the canvas.
Finally, gritting his teeth, Draco relents, sliding his hand into his pajama bottoms and closing his eyes. Then, just like sixth year, he wanks to the thought of Potter watching him.
“Just give me a minute,” the mirror mutters, sounding annoyed.
“Fuck,” Draco mumbles, looking around the lift. “What was that?”
Their marriage has been fragile ever since Draco took the Mark, much like his own relationship with Father. He can’t bring himself to feel guilty for that, though. That part is Father’s own fault, for saying he had their family always in mind, when instead it was only power that he cared about.
Anger starts to churn in Draco’s gut, and he’s just about to turn and have a go at Potter when Neville says, “Merlin, would you two just
“Have to wha—”
“Oh,” Harry says, his eyebrows knitting together. “I wouldn’t want you to risk that either.”
Draco looks up, already frustrated with this bloody thing. “Why?” he snaps.
Harry can hear his heart beating.
touched Potter, but Potter had looked like he
“No, I mean—last time we got drunk together,” Harry says, feeling his heart start to race.
“Sleep,” Harry tells him, thinking of earlier, when Draco said he hadn’t slept all last night. “I’ll be here.”
They get dressed. Draco lends Harry clothes. He can keep them, he says—after all, Draco won’t need them any longer—and then Harry pushes him up against the doorframe and kisses him long and slow.
Harry said nothing.
“You’re barmy,” Draco corrects, but he curls his hand around the back of Potter’s neck and kisses him back, feeling like he’s flying—and then Potter’s tongue is in Draco’s mouth and he can’t think anymore, his cock is suddenly throbbing as he presses up against Potter and groans. “Fuck.”
“Is that—the only reason you don’t want it?” Draco asks.
Harry swallows against the surge of exasperation in his chest and forces himself to walk away. He walks to the Apparition point, Apparates home, and crawls into bed.
Harry thinks he’s okay with that. There’s hope in his chest that wasn’t there before, and he stands up, setting his glass on the coffee table and moving over to the Floo.
Draco gave a hard swallow. “Don’t answer that. Just… I want you, all right? And… I won’t go away, if we have sex. I… promise,” he said slowly, earnestly. He bit his lip and pulled the blankets off of himself, shifting closer so that their bodies were almost touching.
So he lies back on the carpet, staring up at where the ceiling meets the edge of the window, where he can see all the stars twinkling brightly around the moon. He wonders where Draco is—the constellation, that is—but he doesn’t think he’d be able to pick it out even if it were in view. Like many things in school, he was always rubbish at Astronomy.
—Draco’s cock twitches against his thigh as he imagines Harry, standing there with him in the showers, throwing furtive looks in Draco’s direction as he pulls himself off—
Harry can feel Malfoy getting more and more desperate. It’s killing him that he has no idea why. Malfoy simply avoids the questions he doesn’t want to answer, which is frequent—though to be fair, Harry does the same.
Harry stares at him, open-mouthed, as Malfoy turns and starts to walk away, still laughing. “Good to know you’re just as much of a prat as you always were,” Harry complains, loud enough for Malfoy to hear.
But Harry shakes his head tightly. “Just fucking tell me.”
A lump lodges itself in his throat when he realizes that this must be how Malfoy sees him.
Draco rolls his eyes. “Get it yourself,” he mutters, mostly to hide the insane sense of
“Hullo, ‘Mione, Harry,” says a familiar voice as someone walks up to their table.
Potter stares at him, shocked. “How can you say that? It’s your
“Why not?”
to admit that their whole bloody relationship was built on misuse of Amortentia, because he still feels like shit about it and Hermione would probably have his arse—“but… but I did something that made him stop trusting me, and I don’t know how to fix it.”
So he slips his hands downward, feeling much more nervous than when he’d started, and starts to unbutton his trousers. Thank God he’s not turned on right now, because he doesn’t think he could bear the embarrassment of getting hard in front of Malfoy.
However, this is an undeniable fact: Draco is going to die.
Harry’s vision goes blurry.
“But...” Potter says, looking lost.
“I have to say the same for you,” Draco mumbles, wrapping his arms around Harry. And then, so quietly Harry almost doesn’t hear it, he whispers, “Harry—my Harry.”
This is utterly ridiculous.
Harry breathes a sudden laugh, because God, did he really? “I didn’t know.”
“Potter, you
They don’t touch on the way back to Harry’s shop, but the multiple times Harry catches Malfoy staring at him make his heart race all the same.
“Common knowledge, honestly. You know how the Hogwarts rumor mill went,” Draco says loftily, and snickers when Harry curses again.
Harry tries to ignore the way his heart is attempting to rip itself apart in his chest, reaching his hand up to smooth it across Draco’s cheek.
Draco raises his wand and Summons his own clothes. They fly across the room just as they’re supposed to, and he pulls them on as Harry finishes dressing, looking bewildered. Then he Summons the bracelet too, strapping it on his wrist, and Harry feels the faint trickle of Allure-induced lust that’s been flowing beneath his skin finally drop away.
wanted to be the one inside Malfoy, and Malfoy doesn’t even know it.
“No, no, I’m sorry I interrupted,” Harry croaks, his voice hoarse. He rarely uses it anymore. The only person he would want to talk about is Draco, and all he has of Draco is this fragment his mind has created.
Next time, he thinks, next time he’ll have Potter come here instead. Maybe it will be easier then, to have Potter leave instead of Draco doing it.
Tonight they’re at Draco’s after the pub, which isn’t abnormal on its own. No, the abnormal part is that after they arrived, Draco went and pulled two glasses and a bottle of firewhisky out of the cupboard, offering Harry some with a raised brow.
Except that Harry is more awake now, looking at him with bright eyes and a soft smile. “Hey,” he says, and Draco swallows down the stupid lump of bloody emotion that forms in his throat whenever Harry looks at him like this.
Now he’s exhausted. So exhausted.
Draco’s flushing now, and he glares at Harry. “Are you really going to make me—oh fuck,” he groans, as Harry licks a stripe up his cock. “Harry,” he sighs, hips bucking. “Please.”
“That’s awful,” Harry says, shivering.
Malfoy to come back, sighing and going back to his charmwork.
It’s funny, he never used to have a selfless bone in his body. But things change when you’ve been on the losing side of a war, he supposes. Astoria helped him rebuild his name, enough to be able to get a job again, and he’ll be forever grateful to her for that. Even more than that, though, she helped him feel human again, gave him something to focus on other than his damned self-pity.
Draco—Draco doesn’t want him any longer.
When he finally pulls out, Harry almost expects him to immediately leave without looking back. But instead Malfoy slicks his hand and wraps around Harry’s cock instead, avoiding his eyes, stroking with a quick, sloppy rhythm that makes Harry shudder beneath him.
“I love you, Harry. You saved me.”
It’s awkward when Malfoy wakes up a moment later, looking over at him uncertainly, and both of them get dressed in what’s probably record speed.
But Malfoy… he didn’t deserve Azkaban. Harry believed that from the bottom of his heart. Malfoy was like him, was just a lost boy searching for the key to make his life mean something again.
He reached the classroom that Malfoy had mentioned. It was empty, a little eerie, a little cold. Spelling the dust off of a chair, he sat down and waited.
Draco can smell him, all warm and somehow reminding him of Quidditch, every time Potter idly shifts in his chair. Sometimes their knees brush against each other under the desk, sending sparks up Draco’s spine, and he’s fiercely glad they never located the missing torch in their corner because the
Just like that, the mirror surface shatters.
“Fuck, Potter,” Draco sighs, and how many times has he said those words in this room? But even his most vivid mirror fantasies couldn’t compare to the way Potter’s skin is hot beneath his hands when Draco slides them up the back of Potter’s shirt, and the sound of mirror-Potter moaning is really only a faint echo of the way the
This is... nice.
?” Harry says, now utterly confused. Out of all the things he could have expected to hear from Malfoy after two weeks of silence, this is certainly the least of them.
“I will,” he says, even though they’re not dating, not anything to each other. He’s not sure how to feel about any of this.
Harry’s nearly done perfecting a new type of self-sticking paper when Esther pops her head into his workroom. “Mr. Malfoy’s coming,” she says, waggling her eyebrows.
“How far do you want to...?” Potter pulls back to ask, breathing heavily, fingering the hem of Draco’s shirt.
It’s occurred to him that this may possibly be her revenge on him for losing all the prophecies years ago. He wouldn’t put it past her.
“Really?” Hermione says, her face lighting up.
Harry’s mind whirls. “Harry,” he says, taking a step closer. “You called me—”
So no, it’s not the first time he’s been out in the underbelly of Diagon at midnight, walking back to the Apparition point after a job. It’s just that it’s the first time he’s turned a corner to see Draco Malfoy sitting on a stoop, smoking a cigarette.
hot, even now in front of him, arching his back and pressing himself onto another man’s cock. And it’s okay to think that just for now, right? Even if Harry still hates him?
“Wait,” Malfoy says, and tilts his head down the alleyway. “I want to show you something.”
“Except me!”
But he can’t convince himself it’s a bad enough idea to stop, and when Potter pushes his knees up high and climbs over him, Draco can only clutch at Potter’s waist.
“I’m not…” Draco bites his lip, struggling with his words. Harry understands. It was easier on the Veritaserum. “I’m not the easiest to love.”
pushes in just the slightest bit, and Draco nearly keens, forcing himself to relax because he
“I didn’t
“Harry,” Potter says, “You can call me Harry now, you know.”
Draco gives him a look, one that seems to be half exasperation and half an odd sort of fondness. “Did you not hear me say last time that you’re literally my only friend in the department?”
“Are you all right? It’s not a big deal,” Potter says. “I just figured that’s what it looks like anyway.”
“Oh—ah, all right,” he says, swallowing and attempting to disguise his alarm.
—and Potter steps closer again, closer.
His heartbeat starts racing as Malfoy slowly starts working it inside him. Fuck, Harry can’t even tell how big it is with his face to the wall like this—all he knows is the slick sounds of the thing sliding in him, the feeling of its tapered sides working him more and more open, and Merlin, he’s so fucking
Harry’s chest throbs, and he squeezes his eyes closed, because fuck. He does want it. He really does.
with one’s enemy.
,” Draco insists, looking up at him. “It’s. It’s fine if you don’t believe me.”
Twice. He’d said it
“What are you doing here?” he blurted out, because the drawling had alerted him to one undeniable fact: the person he’d walked into was Malfoy. Part of Harry wasn’t surprised, because Malfoy was everywhere at Hogwarts. But the other part of him felt Malfoy’s presence buzzing on his skin like the crackle of a Stupefy, sharp and alarming. He hadn’t seen him since just after the final battle, since death and destruction and all of the things that had kept Harry awake at night ever since, and he almost wanted to flee.
Then Malfoy takes the letter, stamped with the St. Mungo’s seal, and Transfigures it into a canvas.
) and people everywhere in a state of half-undress.
“If you’re sure…” Astoria says pensively.
He knows that. But sometimes it still surprises him to hear it.
Adams walks away, heels clicking on the black marble of the meeting chamber, and Harry attempts to rid himself of the tension paining his shoulders as he turns to say hello to the remaining Trainees. He doesn’t recognize any of the others, only catching fleeting blurs of names before all three of them are upon him, gazing at him in adoration and thanking him for being so brave in the war.
“I was asking Hermione,” Potter complains, but Hermione shakes her head.
know, considering Potter usually invites him along.
He just fucked Potter on Amortentia.
“Fuck,” Harry whines, as Draco finally wraps his slim fingers around Harry’s cock.
“I don’t have the faintest idea what you’re talking about,” Draco says, and Harry snorts and pokes him in the side.
“Worse? What do you mean?” Harry asks, even as the panic fully sets in, panic about what’s about to happen, what he’s about to feel.
“But I—” Malfoy stops, looking away. “I was the enemy.”
Numbly, Harry shakes his head. He’s not. He’s
Or maybe just far more in love than he should be. Merlin, he doesn’t even know if Potter would even consider them
Potter’s eyes go wide. “What is this?” he asks, even as he takes a few steps closer to Draco, even as the pain lessens a little more.
Thankfully his thoughts are interrupted by their arrival at the department door. It’s labeled with shimmering runes, only visible to Unspeakables under Oath, to discern it from the other doors in the round entrance hall. Harry is more than grateful for it—otherwise he’d probably be unbearably lost.
, Harry. And I’m done being afraid.”
Draco had loved him. That was real. And Harry loves him too, so much that he can’t think about it without starting to cry.
He tosses and turns that night, feeling torn and desperate and alone, hating the fact that Malfoy sleeps only a few metres away.
Already, an idea is forming in his head as he thinks about the spell, one that makes him smile as he puts his coat on and heads to the shop.
“Tell me more,” Harry says, and Draco nods, his hand finding a rhythm that makes him tremble.
“Huh,” Hermione says. “No, I did know that.” She squints at Harry for a moment. “So let me get this straight—you’re not mated to Draco?”
Draco rolls his eyes. “There are charms for that, Harry.” He stretches, his long, lean arms flexing and bending above his head.
have bite? Have you seen what
“Okay?” Harry asks, pulling back.
He can recall the buzzing now, the white noise that filled his ears in the moments before he cast.
“We don’t have to mate,” Harry says, finding Draco’s arm and squeezing it. “I already said that—”
They crawl into bed, strange enough because it’s the guest room and even more so because Potter’s here, but regardless everything is going fine and well until Draco realizes that holding Potter’s hand means he can’t get into his preferred sleep position.
“A gift from Blaise,” he says, crossing to stand next to Potter. And then he lets out a small gasp—he’d had it all wrong, really, how they would look together like this. Potter’s actually nearly his height—Draco always thought he was a bit shorter, but no, they’re nearly even—and Potter’s eyes are greener too, his shoulders a bit more broad.
Strangely enough, a few days follow during which barely anyone visits his room. He’s glad of the quiet; now he can float in his pool of guilt in peace.
—you just talked about how you felt back at Hogwarts.” He lets out a sigh, his voice softening as he looks away. “And anyway, I thought that all changed after we snogged at the end of eighth year. You—you always avoided me after that.”
“You like that,” Draco says.
“You’re such a fucking idiot,” Draco spits out. “I shouldn’t have to explain this to you.”
Harry gives Malfoy a grin. “So you were obsessed with me.”
“Shh. Wait.”
“I’ll come with you,” Draco offers. “I should probably go soon, anyway.”
There’s only one bedroom. And it’s Harry’s.
Harry wants to press but decides to let it go. “Assuming I
“They do too,” Malfoy says. “Word travels fast, and it’s not like it’s a secret—you’re the savior, and I’m scum of the earth. Obviously.” He scoffs, possibly at himself, and turns to walk away. “You know what? Forget it, Potter. This was a stupid idea anyway.”
Malfoy snorts, pinching Harry’s arse in retaliation. “Patience, Potter,” he says cheerily. “Anyway, I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t attracted to you. Think of it this way: at least you’re not so ugly that the sight of your face makes me go soft. Otherwise I might’ve had to resort to some more…
George gives Harry a slow nod. “Interesting,” he says, a smirk growing on his face. “I can see it, though.”
He loves him.
Reluctantly, Harry steps closer, a sense of foreboding coming over him. Here it comes—Malfoy’s probably had enough of giving him the silent treatment, and now he’s going to start ridiculing him, now he’s going to pick a fight and Harry can’t do this, he
Only then does Draco look closer, enough to see that the liquid inside is clear.
him, wrapping him up in warm arms, and fuck, Harry loves him.
“Well?” Draco says, making no move to invite him in—and okay, he knows he’s being a bit of a prick, but Potter deserves it.
“Ah, Mr. Potter,” the woman says. “We were told we might expect you.” She picks up a small orb from beneath the desk, tapping it with her wand, and it glows brightly and begins to float. “You may follow the orb to your room.”
“Sorry,” Harry says, dismay in his eyes. “I’m fine, really.”
“No more headaches in the morning,” Potter points out.
Not that he actually thinks that's the case, deep down. It's Draco, it's always been Draco—
Potter doesn’t
He—he loves him.
Harry stares at the space in front of them, unremarkable except for being a tad bit dusty. “What’s supposed to—”
“Not at all,” Harry says. He thinks he would quite like that actually, having Malfoy in his home.
Ron sets his spoon down. “You know. The thing where you’ve been obsessed with him for forever? Don’t tell me you’re going to try to deny it again, Harry, we all know—”
punishments.”
“Not—not in a mean way,” Harry explained. “Just start with lighting candles, maybe, and then try to get used to bigger things, like fireplaces. I dunno. So you’re less scared.”
In all the time they’ve been fucking, they’ve never talked about this.
to hold him and kiss him and fuck him, again and again—
Harry groans, biting at Draco’s thumb, making him groan in turn.
“Fucking
A just-barely-not-shirtless man jostles against Potter, pushing him forward, and suddenly their bodies are colliding and Potter’s warm against Draco, like every fantasy he’s ever had but
Draco could spend hours doing just this.
Draco smirks. “I can tell you a better story, about how I’m going to fuck you right now…”
“Oh,” Potter says, sounding a bit surprised. Fuck, it
The realization hits Harry, and he swallows thickly, because—because he shouldn’t
“It depends,” Harry says. “They were a bit of a pain in the arse until I realized I could just make the item look a lot different from its Muggle counterpart, so generally I just disguise it as something else. At any rate, nothing I’ve made should be able to have its charm set off without a magical signature, so unless something malfunctions, then a Muggle would be fine even if they were to get ahold of it. Charming them this way is mostly precautionary.”
He feels bad. He’s always a bit distracted now because it’s so hard to focus when that tiny part of him feels like it’s never gotten out of bed in the morning, like it’s still asleep and he has to drag it around like a foreign limb. Hermione’s trying, he knows, trying to pretend like nothing has changed and they’re returning for their eighth year like everything is normal, but the absence of Ron is already weighing heavily on both of them.
He stands and goes to Draco, even though the Allure gets stronger with every step he takes, urging him to try to kiss Draco, or maybe even to fuck him. But he ignores it, instead clambering into the bed beside Draco when he shifts out of the way. “I missed you, fuck,” Draco says, pulling Harry close and latching on like a lifeline.
The worst part is that there’s a part of Harry that still wants—something. Wants Malfoy to at least mention what happened back then, to acknowledge that they’d once been—not friends, but more than acquaintances, he thinks. But as much as Harry wants him to fucking say something, Malfoy doesn’t breathe a word of it, instead avoiding Harry like a Spattergroit epidemic and barely speaking when they do meet.
Maybe he should punch Malfoy again, just to get all of this pent up tension out of his system. No, actually—Malfoy should punch Harry, because then Harry could have an excuse to get angry. And then he wouldn’t want to fuck Malfoy anymore. Right?
, so all he can do is wait until Mother leaves and ask, “What do
An idea occurs to Harry, and he grins, wrenching his hands free of Draco’s grasp. Before Draco can manage to grab him again, Harry wraps his arms around Draco’s body and rolls, tipping them off the sofa and into the spin of Apparition.
It’s not like Harry was in a Body Bind before. But it feels that way, as he slumps forward into Malfoy’s arms, head spinning with jealousy and unfairness and so much fucking yearning he could cry.
“Oh?” Malfoy asks, managing to sound interested, and Harry is grateful. “Sounds impossible. Nothing is interesting in that department.”
“What, you mean you’re not so rude to everyone else? Charming,” Harry says, and he really shouldn’t have, but he couldn’t resist, not when he still has such a prevalent mix of anger and stupid fucking longing in his stomach.
“Well
Slowly, Draco sits up. He feels blurry, discombobulated, and he crawls off the bed and starts to find his clothes. Potter follows suit, and then they’re standing there, trembling, much too far apart.
So he turns to face Potter on the bed, crossing his legs, feeling nervous. “I’m going to tell you about my life now,” he states. It’s Potter’s turn to listen.
“Yes—although, actually, I forgot to mention,” Hermione says, brow furrowing. “You most likely couldn’t catch it, and neither could Harry and I. See, we’re not quite sure if this is an absolute or not, but, well.” She frowns, as if what she’s going to say could be potentially incendiary. “Everyone who’s gotten sick so far happens to be a Pureblood.”
“You’re doing so good,” Potter says, even though Draco’s only taken one finger, even though Potter’s just barely twisting it around inside him. It gives Draco an odd flush of pleasure, and he presses his face further into the pillow.
, wants Potter to look at Draco like Draco looks at him when his head’s turned and no one’s around.
“And because…” he starts, looking wilted like a plant without water—“Because it’s easier than blaming myself.”
. Instead he turns around and inspects the jar of marinara with a lump in his throat. “Yeah.”
The office. Some sort of urgent memory pricks at the edges of his consciousness, something about one of the orders that came into their warehouse earlier that morning, but he’s too sleepy to remember it fully.
“Oh good,” Hermione says, looking rather relieved. “Not that I would disapprove or anything, if you did, but I suppose I was a little hurt when I thought you were keeping it from me—I know I’ve been gone at work recently, but I still would’ve hoped you would let me know,” she says, laughing, a little embarrassment in her eyes.
God. Draco’s cock is right there, and Harry wants to touch it. He
—I’m coming, Potter,
“Yes, but you complain all the time,” Potter accuses.
“Well, ‘just Harry,’ you’re either very bad at describing your life or you—” Malfoy throws his hands up in indignation. “I just cannot believe it. Do you ever do anything fun?”
“Oh, fuck you, Potter,” Draco mumbles, the effect mildly ruined by the fact that he’s in the middle of taking off his own shirt.
That, and a small pang of loneliness—the tiniest, smallest wish that he could crawl back into Potter’s bed, even though Potter won’t want him there.
They end up eventually making it to the bedroom, although they keep getting caught up kissing on the way, and it’s even longer until they make it on the bed because Harry gets preoccupied by undoing the rest of Draco’s buttons. “Oh,” he breathes, when he opens Draco’s shirt at last and immediately sees the faint outlines of scars, all across his chest and stomach.
Oh. Fuck.
Hermione walks in, shutting the door behind herself. “Oh, Harry,” she says, going to him and sitting on the edge of the bed. “You’re not quite all right, are you?”
Then Potter’s hand is on his wrist. “Wanna keep watching?” Potter asks quietly.
“Please,” Harry says.
Harry yelps and turns to face away. “You’re stripping in here?”
And then Potter walks into the room, all muscular and unfairly attractive and smelling like warm, blissful nights spent cuddling on the couch—fuck, Draco hates this. Hates
Potter makes a face. “Point taken.”
“You sound good,” Potter says, and the huskiness in his voice gives Draco a rush of pleasure.
Harry laughs and pats his thigh, and then he finally sucks him down until he comes, pulsing down Harry’s throat.
“How do you feel?” Harry asks later that night, pressed to Draco’s side as they lay in bed. They’re both naked, having had a relatively enthusiastic re-consummation of their bond, and they’ve been lying there in silence for quite a while.
Then Malfoy continues his casting, and Harry is left with a heat in his veins that has nothing to do with the warming charm he cast before he undressed.
Draco briefly has to turn away from the memory because—fuck. Potter
, Potter—that’s… fuck,” he groans, throwing himself into the fantasy. “I’ve—I’ve wanted this for so long.”
He doesn’t pass out, not immediately. Instead he lies there and thinks of Draco Malfoy.
Potter sets three wand alarms in the morning and still somehow wakes up late. For the first week it drove Draco up the wall, and it still does, but nowadays he finds himself staring at Potter in the time before he wakes, watching his chest rise and fall with sleep, wondering exactly why Potter hates him so much.
both pretty drunk, you know, but we both ended up naked obviously, and—”
“It’s Muggle entertainment. You’re supposed to watch shows and movies on it—moving pictures that tell a story. Kind of like a cross between Wizarding portraits and a Pensieve, I suppose,” he explains.
“Probably,” he says. “But first—you should know that Hermione knows. About the Veela thing.”
“Draco?” Astoria calls from the adjoining sitting room, the one she’s all but claimed as her own to lounge and sleep in.
Draco sucks in a breath. “You’re making fun of me.”
Potter looks taken aback. “I’m fine, I—”
Maybe it was just because of… the kiss. Maybe that was why he was disappointed that Malfoy didn’t want to be around him. Rampant teenage hormones and all.
So then Harry is left alone with the vision in front of him, of Malfoy’s pale body in profile, arched toward the other man, gasping with every thrust of the man’s fingers. He’s up to three, now, sliding slickly into Malfoy’s arse, and Harry can see
When the end of the workday finally comes, he Apparates straight to Mungo’s, planning on taking supper in Astoria’s room. He hopes she’ll only need to stay a night or two, now that she’s awake, although he assumes they’ll want to run more tests on her before she leaves.
“Hmm?” Potter says, and Merlin, he’s going to make him say it, isn’t he?
That thought hadn’t even crossed Harry’s mind, but now that Malfoy’s said it, Harry feels relieved all the same. Still, though, he wants to ask him more, to tease out exactly why Malfoy’s being so evasive about the issue.
“Hullo, Harry,” Hermione says, and a chorus of assorted ‘hullos’ echoes across the table from their small group. Harry nods his own greeting and gratefully accepts the pint Hermione pushes toward him across the sticky surface of the wood.
“Okay,” Harry said, half hoping Draco wouldn’t hear him. But Draco’s rambling cries ceased.
Harry bursts into a fit of laughter. “It’s yours, you know,” he says, grabbing his wand and spelling himself clean. He aims the wand at Draco’s arse too, but Draco stops him, cheeks reddening.
Harry makes a face at him and kicks at a rock on the ground. It skitters off into the lake, and he turns to watch it sink. “I’m a bit surprised you know what a broken record sounds like.”
that, but he can’t help it, not when this warm pulsing magic spreading through his body, not with Malfoy staring at him like that.
“You sure don’t act like it,” he points out grumpily.
“You don’t have to be dignified all the time.”
“I don’t know,” he blurted out.
He still
“I’m trying not to be,” Draco says honestly.
” Draco mouths at him, expression stern, and Harry shakes his head sharply. Of
He spares a glance at the other Trainees next to him, four others in total. He hasn’t a clue to any of their identities—they aren’t allowed to know anything about each other until after the Oath has been taken. It promotes unity, the mentors say, but sometimes Harry thinks it simply feels dehumanizing. Every day for the last half year, he’s been referred to as a number instead of his name.
“Well,” Harry says after a moment. “I guess I should... probably leave?”
Inwardly, Harry sighed, as Draco’s smile always did things to him.
“Yeah,” Harry says. “First year on the train, right?”
“We’ve made bad decisions,” Harry says, his voice husky as Draco nips at his ear. “I think I was leaving.”
“You didn’t even have to think about saving me, and yet you did it anyway,” Draco says, looking at him contemplatively. “Bloody savior complex. Does it even in his sleep.”
and that’s more than Harry could’ve hoped for at this point. “I wish you could too,” he says, rolling onto his side and looking into Draco’s eyes. “But—but I’m happy that you’re here with me anyway.”
Draco snickers, suddenly feeling breathless.
Draco scowls at that, and Harry laughs and kisses him.
“Ooh, Young Master is saying he wants Nimsy’s help! Of course, Young Master! Nimsy can do anything he is needing!”
“I don’t,” Draco maintains, but his voice is shaky and his body is on fire and somehow Potter is leaning in and Draco feels like he’s going to explode.
Fuck.
He shoves it toward Draco. “Take it,” he mutters. “I don’t want it.”
Potter frowns. “Do
“You were a Death Eater. You aren’t anymore,” Harry corrected him. Malfoy crossed his arms and opened his mouth again, but Harry waved his words away. “It’s already been a year, Malfoy. And McGonagall never thought you were a terrible person. I don’t know her that well, but I know her enough to know that she wouldn’t hold a grudge against you for things you did when you were just barely an adult. Let me try, please?”
Harry and Ron both stare at her in horror. Even when her parents hadn’t yet recovered their memories, she’d still sworn by research. The fact that she’s damning it now is more than a little alarming.
Draco will—
“But it’s unfair!”
“I’m starting to think ridiculous is a compliment,” Harry says.
“Sorry,” Draco says again. “But I’ll see you tomorrow? I’m not working.”
“Fuck,” Harry mumbles. He’s hard, now, harder than he was last night when he was lying beside Draco.
Harry shudders and comes. “Fuck, Draco—
What’s even more striking, though, is that Potter looks exactly the same way.
” Harry says, and he almost comes right there. His voice is rusty when he says, “Really?”
“I’m trying to tell you I care about you!” Harry nearly shouts.
wants to touch him. And now it seems they’ve touched each other quite a lot, and he can’t fucking remember it.
After a minute or two, Draco rolls back to face Harry, sighing. And then he says, almost in a whisper, “I wish I wasn’t a Veela.”
But this is the only chance he’ll ever get, isn’t it?
His face splits into a grin, because Merlin, his dream had been right. “Pot, kettle,” he teases, going along with the script, and Draco rolls his eyes.
Harry really, really has been trying not to think about kissing him, ever since pub night, when he’d gone home with his head filled to the brim with thoughts of Malfoy. But now Malfoy’s in his shop again, and his resolve is going straight down the drain.
Potter just laughs.
Harry rolls his eyes at him. “Git,” he says, unable to keep a smile from his face.
“That was
“I care about you,” Potter says matter-of-factly, as if it’s
—nngh, Merlin, you—you feel good,” Harry pants out, the rhythm of his hips stuttering as he pushes himself so he’s leaning on one arm, reaching the other arm between them so he can stroke Draco’s cock.
Potter sighs and looks away. “I didn’t want this to happen,” he speaks finally, words puncturing the silence of the room.
, I’m fucking sure, just—
Then he reaches out across the table and takes Draco’s hand, and Draco can’t hide a sigh.
Draco pauses to contemplate, and then slowly, his eyes soften. “I... it’s worth it for me too,” he says. “Otherwise I’d never have brought it up in the first place, you know? But—Salazar, don’t go telling people I
can get this over with,” Draco says snidely. “You only took the potion, what, three times?
, tired of pretending to be the Saviour of the Wizarding World and living up to all these expectations when all he wants is to lie down at the Burrow and nap. But he can’t, not with reporters finding him every time he sets foot into public, not with friends and acquaintances owling at any opportunity, and sometimes it’s too much, too much for his brain which has become oh-so-fragile, ready to crumple at any moment—
Draco huffs a dry laugh. “That, I did. It was bloody annoying.”
Harry stares down at him, swallowing. “What do you mean?”
Harry follows them.
Which is probably true, Harry concedes. But he’s still bracing himself for an argument, so he’s surprised when Ron relents, simply shrugging and says, “No, I s’pose not.”
Then Draco clears his throat. “I would do it again,” he says quietly. “If you wanted it, I would. And I think that’s precisely why I don’t want to. Because I can feel how easy it would be to do it—and to hurt you.”
And he leaves.
“What?”
,” Malfoy snaps, collecting his clothes and pulling them on with no small amount of force.
“Like what?” Malfoy arches a brow.
“Anyway, how could I forget?” he says, grinning through his tears, putting a hand to Draco’s cheek. “You were a right arse.”
“Come on, come for me,” Potter says, pressing the words into Draco’s jaw, and Draco stops thinking and just lets himself feel—Potter thick inside him, Potter’s arms boxing him against the mattress, Potter’s lips on his jaw, his cheek.
It’s the most elegant of all the rooms and by far the most beautiful, all done in white wood, the doors accented with delicate archways. The large Amortentia fountain in the center fills the main chamber with the smell of the most wondrous things, treacle and broomsticks and Ron and Hermione’s flat, and Harry takes a deep breath in and holds it until he thinks his lungs might give out. He exhales, looking around once more, eyes skating over the works of art that are lining the walls, ones said to encapsulate loving moments throughout history.
And Harry really fucking needed that this summer.
He’s fucked, isn’t he?
Slowly, he opens his mouth, watching as Potter’s eyes blink open, his chest heaving. Draco clears the despair from his throat, his own lip trembling. “I—I love you,” he says, the words tearing out of him, feeling like he’s dangling at the edge of a precipice.
to remember putting you in St. Mungo’s more than once.”
matter,” she says stubbornly, and now her eyes are fierce. “Because for the first time in literally all of the time we’ve been married, my husband came home and said he had sex with someone. And you
“It’s nothing,” Potter says, but his words ring false.
And then Malfoy catches his hand, pulls him closer, and kisses him.
He wants Malfoy to
“I can’t hear you,” Draco tells him, clutching at his head.
“Potter…” Malfoy says.
Harry nods again, feeling shaky with lust and exertion and the continuing aftershocks of his orgasm. Malfoy undoes his bonds, one by one—first Harry’s left leg, then his right, and finally his wrists—
“We’re just different, I think,” Harry says. “Fixating isn’t any better. Like—like how I fixated on you in sixth year, and. Well. You know how that turned out.” With a gentle finger, he traces one of the scars on Draco’s bare chest, regret in his eyes.
Harry stares at him, dumbfounded. “You’re not—I wasn’t—”
Harry, on the other hand, doesn’t need the potion—he never has.
for him, so much that it’s splitting him in half just to be a few steps away. ”
For a moment, just a moment, Harry thinks of Malfoy being just as alone on Christmas as Harry is now—he thinks of Christmases back in his cupboard, which got cold and drafty in the wintertime, and how sometimes all he really wanted was a hug—
Draco’s suddenly paralyzed because that would mean—that would mean Potter dislikes him so much that he doesn’t even fucking want to remember, and—
But he can’t. Not yet.
“Oh—sorry,” he apologizes, sitting up in the uncomfortable library chair he’d been slouched in. The book in front of him is still lying open on its first page, his parchment for his Transfiguration essay completely blank. Making a face, he glances at the clock—he really ought to get started since it’s due tomorrow morning.
“Tell me how it feels,” Harry says, forcing himself to stop wanking for now, because if he touches his cock now he thinks he might come,
“I don’t remember,” Draco says, too quietly to hear.
Everyone else had made moving on look easy.
“Don’t—don’t touch me,” Draco says, but he’s pressing his face into Harry’s chest anyway because this is the last time, right? The last time he’ll ever feel like this?
Malfoy tried to strike another match, a little too tentatively. It didn’t light, and he frowned at it, trying once more. This time, when the flame appeared, he flinched but didn’t drop it.
“Told you,” Draco says, and gets up to put on his clothes.
“Draco was saying that I should offer to help you with research,” Harry explains. “Which I should’ve thought of before, honestly.”
Stripped to his boxer shorts, Harry sits down in his chair, watching as Malfoy finally draws his wand again. Then Malfoy takes a deep breath and utters his first incantation.
For a fleeting, hopeful moment, Harry wonders if Draco has somehow come back.
Hermione will cure him.
“Felt like staying in?” Harry asks, moving to clear off the clutter that somehow has managed to take over his work table again. He swears that it breeds during the night when he’s not looking.
good to have Malfoy’s mouth on him. His thighs are shaking with the effort of staying still, of letting Malfoy lick him open, letting him press his tongue inside him with quick slides that make Harry gasp.
“I know. Ludicrous, isn’t it?” Draco says, raising an eyebrow.
—as if Draco had been the one to start it. No. He’s not going to stand for this—not this time.
Harry braces himself.
Harry breathed a relieved sigh, wandering in toward Draco. “What’re you doing?”
“Harry, shut
He stands, rubbing at his puffy eyes, and says, “Do you happen to know any anti-swelling spells?”
Married. It wasn’t the most surprising thing in the world, but it was still a slight shock to actually hear the words from Ron’s mouth. His two best friends in the world were getting married. Another new beginning, another couple his age making their dreams a reality. He swallowed down a sudden and potent thrum of loneliness, hugging them both at once.
“Sorry,” Potter says, then again, “Sorry.” Then Potter looks at him, eyes green and desperate, and Draco’s saved from falling once more.
Of course, it’s just as Harry’s standing there in the middle of the sidewalk trying to convince himself to leave before he makes a stupid decision that Malfoy catches sight of him.
,’ reads the heading. ‘
So he’s had to stay on his best behavior for the better part of four years, always with the Ministry breathing down his neck. One step out of line, even unintentional, and he could end up right back with the Dementors, going mad from visions of his worst memories.
“No, no, I’m interested,” Malfoy says, jabbing his wand toward the canvas. He runs his other hand through his hair, and Harry bites back another rush of attraction, hurriedly focusing on the floor.
you?” Malfoy hisses, cornering him outside the Great Hall after dinner the next night.
“We could leave?” Harry tries, already poised to Apparate.
“You sure you want it?” Potter asks, his tone light, teasing, and Draco hates how hot it is.
“What?” Malfoy asks, eyeing him strangely as he draws his wand.
Malfoy would make that assumption. He snatches the brush from Malfoy’s hand and examines it, picking up his wand and casting a couple of diagnostic spells. “This has been tampered with,” he says after a moment, furrowing his brow. “There’s an extra layer of magic that’s not supposed to be there.”
“I do,” Draco tells him. He thinks his hands are shaking.
him to perform well here. Maybe it’s because fiddling about with instruments of time reminds him of trying and failing, over and over, to fix the Vanishing cabinet, Voldemort’s threats dripping down his neck like sweat.
But Draco eventually nods. “I know,” he says then. “You loved it, didn’t you?”
Fuck.
for that, he was so terrified.
It’s almost a shame he’s gay.
Harry stares at him, that jealousy simmering under the surface of his skin. “Merlin, really?”
Draco works him open with two fingers, then three, treating him more gently than Harry would’ve ever imagined. Harry’s heart nearly bursts, full to the brim as he watches Draco hovering over him, loving him, God. The hard lines of Draco’s face are softened by affection as he presses his fingers inside him until Harry’s slick and open, clenching his arse with need for more.
They sat on the sofa, which Harry frowned at for a moment. It felt as though it had narrowed: a month ago, they could have sat on either end with two other people between them, but now they were almost touching. Not to mention that the other chairs in the room, which they had used less frequently, had seemed to disappear.
He sighs, rinsing his hair off. He really shouldn’t be thinking these kinds of thoughts, because it’s these kinds of thoughts that lead to being in love.
It’s silent for a moment as they both hop over one of the missing steps in the staircase leading to the fourth floor. “He’s... he’s one of us,” Hermione says eventually. “He’s the only Slytherin who returned, you know? And houses aren’t supposed to matter anymore.”
Harry’s gut twists. “Are you okay?” he asks, and miraculously his voice doesn’t crack from the sudden anxiety brewing in his chest.
es they’ve been casting to properly read their books aren’t bright enough to show his occasional flush.
“Is it okay?” Harry asks, breathing fast already.
“I thought you might,” Harry says, and kisses him. He’s taken his shirt off at some point, so Draco gladly runs his hands over the muscles on his back, moaning and pulling him closer.
He sighs. “Fine,” he says quietly, eyes flicking to Potter again. “Leave.”
,” Malfoy moans, back arching, and then
Malfoy wanted it.
“Hm?”
“Hm,” Malfoy says, taking a sip of his drink. “No wonder you haven’t been in the papers. You haven’t been doing
“Don’t get too comfortable. I’m still half-dressed,” Harry points out, even though he’d really rather not get up right now either—Malfoy naked and warm on top of him is something he doesn’t want to stop. But he’d only ever gotten halfway out of his trousers, and now they’re hiked down on his thighs, fairly uncomfortable now that he’s not distracted by arousal.
Draco stills, mouth falling open slightly. Never before has Astoria so much raised her voice at him. He shakes his head. “I don’t even know if I’m capable of—of doing other things,” he admits, looking away. He never realized—he never
“I wanted this,” Potter says, grinning, kissing him again. “I’m happy.”
“Think they’re slandering you?”
It’ll be better even though he crawls into his bed at his flat, nearly in tears at the thought that soon he won’t love Harry any longer, at the thought of not feeling happy again until the next time he takes the potion, and Merlin,
He looks down at it.
Malfoy Vanishes his pants.
Potter dodges with admittedly fast reflexes, rolling to the side and making a grab for one of Draco’s arms. “What the
Harry swallows. “What do you mean?”
Finally, Draco sighs, pushing his face into Potter’s neck. “I’m going to wait to say it again,” he decides.
“Get off,” Malfoy says weakly, pushing him away, and Harry tries not to feel disappointed as he lets go of his shoulder. “If you’re not going to—just. Just don’t,” Malfoy says, and then he turns to walk away.
“Shite,” Harry breathes, and then suddenly, Draco hugs him, letting out a bubble of laughter.
“You’re the one who owled me,” Harry points out, because Malfoy
his face? He never saw it coming!” Draco recounts, setting water on the stove to boil.
He pulls the dildo out and sets it outside the shower. Then he stands in the spray and shuts his eyes, willing the water to wash away this terrible, all-consuming need to touch Potter.
“I’ll sleep in your bed,” Draco decides, as they walk into Harry’s flat.
“Okay,” Malfoy says, and then again, “Okay.”
Harry stares at him. “What?”
, he says, because he always does.
“Here,” Harry says, shoving the extra Butterbeer toward him before he can take it back. Malfoy gives him a look that’s two parts confusion and one part fear. “Oh, Merlin’s sake—I’m not poisoning you or anything, okay? I told Hermione I was going to the kitchens, and she wanted one, so I... took extra.”
He’ll have to throw out that batch of potion. That’s okay. He can always get more from the fountain.
“I’m not—”
Malfoy and Potter to you,” the Head Unspeakable interjects loudly before they can begin to row, and Harry tears his gaze away from Malfoy, embarrassed. “And you
“There are anti-vampire extremists just like there are for all other magical creatures,” Malfoy explains. “It’s whatever. I made my peace with it when I got turned.”
Not to mention Malfoy’s
“If it’s not important...” Malfoy says, and then he leans his head just a bit closer, and fuck, Harry would
The part of Harry that once loved him aches slightly.
Draco doesn’t hesitate to answer. “No,” he says, shaking his head, and Harry shivers a sigh of relief. “Not at all. You… you were willing to give all of this up—" Draco gestures at the way their bodies are pressed together—“just to make me happy. And that speaks volumes.”

“Yes, oh—oh,

depressing than being cooped up at the hotel, so he decided both options were terrible.
Malfoy laughs. It’s a nice laugh, smooth and low. “Fair.”
“’S a bit warm,” Harry says breathily, feeling hot under his pajamas. “Are you warm?”
. The least Draco can do is suck up his stupid crush for an hour or two.
Draco shivers. “Fuck, Potter,” he mumbles. “You’re such a sap.”
Draco doesn’t even have to think before he nods. “
Harry turns around, takes one step and nearly keels over, collapsing right into Draco’s arms.
Fortunately, Draco is good many more things than simply getting his way—finances, for example, which is the reason he was originally hired at this oddity of a landscaping company. The owner of The Marvelous Watering Can (named after some oddly shaped Muggle tool that Draco vaguely recollects seeing once outside of Hagrid’s shack of a house) didn’t know
“Draco,” she says after a moment. “Your coworker—the one you slept with.”
“And yet you want me in yours,” Harry quips, and Draco pauses and gives him a look.
Potter looks up from where he’d just spelled lube onto his hand. “What?”
“Bloody
Potter doesn’t come, and Draco is left all alone.
racing through his veins and pooling in his groin. He’s so fucking hard he feels like he could come immediately—if Malfoy would just touch his cock.
“Ugh. What about hexes?” Harry asks, more out of curiosity than intent.
Instead of answering, Malfoy pulls his fingers out, leaving Harry feeling bereft of the touch. Then Malfoy Summons something, casts a lube charm, and Harry gets his answer when he feels the tip of a plug at his arse.
It hits him somewhere toward the second week that he doesn’t actually
Draco stares at him, not quite processing it—a second apology in as many months. “What?”
with him, anyway? He can’t be now, at least not for long, because Malfoy is everything he’s ever needed, he
Harry would be embarrassed if Draco wasn’t currently trailing a hand down his chest, tweaking at his nipple with a thumbnail, making it very hard to think at all. “Is that a problem?”
This is all Potter’s fucking fault, isn’t it?
Which goes to show how worrying it is that Harry hasn’t seen Hermione look so stressed about a case since she’d worked with the Longbottoms.
He’d thought—dreamed, maybe, that he could get over this if they had sex. And this is as close as they can get, but—
If Draco makes him wait any longer Harry just might lose it. “
“No, not completely,” Malfoy says, leaning forward. “But it works well enough for that purpose, and for the other symptoms as well. It does a very good job of keeping my wings from coming out, actually. And…”
“I’m so proud of you, ‘Mione,” Ron says, and Harry nods in agreement.
“I’m mainly trying to get the most accurate representation of Muggle genetics as possible,” Hermione explains. “I’ve read a lot of scientific papers, but I want to make sure I’m clear on the background before I begin designing spells, and even then I’m not sure it’s possible—I’d have no idea what to target.”
“I love you,” Draco sobbed.
Merlin.
And then, one time, Draco was nowhere to be found.
“All the time.”
In the meantime, Astoria is dying.
Then he stares at the table in horror. What is he
God, the voice is just right. The words are just right. He’s changed his mind; whoever is doing this is acting like Draco just to torture him, and now he’s going to go insane with this Draco being so close to the real one—
“Wait, Malfoy.”
Malfoy had heard him approach, apparently, because he narrowed his eyes at Harry for a moment. He then blinked, turning back to the water and not acknowledging him further. Harry decided that it was a good enough invitation to sit down a few feet away.
Now Draco won’t have to look at Potter when Potter breaks his heart.
“Oh,” Hermione says, her eyebrows raising. “Well, that’s useful to know for work—I should’ve thought to check the Creatures lists. But I wonder if that alone would disqualify him from the registry—hmm...” She Summons a leather-bound notebook, ‘Ministry Legal Department’ embossed in gold on the cover, which then results in a few seconds of silent conversation between Ron and Hermione that involves only facial expressions. They seem to be silently arguing about whether or not Hermione should be doing work at the dinner table, a fact that’s cemented by the triumphant smile on Hermione’s face as she finally looks away and opens her notebook.
His heart cracks in his chest when Potter avoids his eyes as they crawl into bed. He feels like he’s teetering, hanging over the edge of a cliff, with Potter the only thing keeping him from freefall—and Potter’s about to let him go.
get an erection right now. Quickly, he fumbles for a memory of something to distract himself, settling on trying to imagine Hagrid and Madame Maxine going at it—which thankfully turns him off almost immediately.
Then he reaches over and puts a hand on Draco’s shoulder, warm through his jumper, and Draco’s heart leaps into his throat.
you were acquainted.”
“I’m okay,” Draco whispered, as if he were trying to convince himself more than anything. “I’m okay.” He trailed his wand upwards, so that it pointed at the ceiling, and Harry watched as it lit the area like the sun.
Yes, Draco never imagined they’d make it this far—but here they are. He thinks with some horror that he’s going to have to tell his parents and Pansy and probably also the rest of the world, and that he’s probably going to get weird questions about the Imperius Curse from his parole Auror, and that someday, if they last far in the future, they’re probably going to have to talk about actually getting married to get rid of this damn bond.
But for some unfathomable reason, he stays.
The pain nearly fades entirely.
“Of course, Harry. I’m quite hungry myself, but you go on ahead. I’ll clean up.” Langley gestured to the mess that they had made that day. Books were scattered around the room from that day’s research, and several desks were broken and exhibited charred tops as a result of their dueling. Harry smiled appreciatively.
He can’t lose him.
“God, I really, really hope not,” Hermione says. “I’m—I’m working on a solution. But I keep hitting dead ends, and I just don’t have
real.
“I…” Harry says, a small smile on his lips as he stares into Draco’s eyes. “I love you.”
“Good,” Potter says, and kisses him. “I want to, too.”
Harry can’t seem to stay away from the pool, but when he does drag himself away for a day, they go flying. Casual flying, mostly, but one day Draco tosses a Snitch at him, and that’s all it takes to start a Seeker’s game.
“Harry,” Malfoy says then, sitting on the bed, pulling him down too. “I… fuck.”
“As your boyfriend, can I not look at you however I want?” Harry asks, grinning fondly when Draco rolls his eyes.
He pauses, and Harry shakes his head.
“I just...” Harry’s mouth threatens to clamp shut, and he has to force the words out. “You’ve been—you’ve been avoiding me.”
Draco doesn’t want it to be the last time.
Potter suddenly looks at him like he’d hung the moon, and Draco abruptly forgets what he meant to say next.
He also kind of wants to just let this play out because either this isn’t real or it’s a one-time fluke that will certainly never be happening again. And he wouldn’t be a true Slytherin if he didn’t take advantage of the fact that Potter is
Maybe Potter did love him after all.
“What was that?” Draco asks, and then instead of letting Harry answer he starts sucking at Harry’s neck, leaving Harry only capable of a garbled moan. “Thought so,” he mutters.
“Not—not yet,” Draco says quietly. “Not that again, for now. But—but maybe just...” He casts a spell to slick up his hand, wrapping it around Harry’s cock, and Harry whines and curls closer to him, pressing his lips into Draco’s shoulder.
Above him, Malfoy stills, his face contorting into a stern frown. “Fuck,” he says, then louder, “Fuck!”
“But you still want to sleep with me, don’t you?” Malfoy says, aiming a smirk at him.
It’s so much better than being with the Draco in his dreams.
“Oh. Me neither,” Harry says, and still he can’t stop from smiling.
So he lies there. He hears people talk around him, but the full meaning doesn’t register. It’s just bits and pieces.
“Yeah,” Harry says, chuckling at Draco’s look of surprise. “What’s wrong with Harry?”
It’s a good idea, as it turns out. Harry hadn’t realized just how stressed he was until they were each a drink in, relaxing at a corner table at the Leaky. And Hermione looks lighter too—he saw her laughing with Ron just a moment ago, as they went up to buy another round.
“Me too,” Draco says, “For everything.”
“Oh, fuck no,” Draco says immediately, standing up and pulling out his wand.
It’s taken Draco a long time to understand just why Potter prefers to do most of this the Muggle way. To be fair, there are certain plants such as the tree he now has to plant that are too delicate to have magic such as a
When he looks up, it appears the rest of them have finished writing. Adams raises her wand and swishes it cleanly, causing the slips to soar into the air in front of her. Then, one by one, she taps them with her wand and they disintegrate into ash. “Unspeakable Bailey is assigned to the Space department,” she says, motioning to whom Harry used to know as Trainee Two. “Unspeakable Lee to the Love department,” Adams continues. “Unspeakable Knight to the Hall of Prophecy, and…” She holsters her wand. “Both Unspeakable Potter and Unspeakable Malfoy to the Death department.”
“Everything?” Draco says, and then he slides his hands down to Harry’s waist and slowly presses their hips together.
Draco’s not sure what Potter wants from him. He thinks they both know he doesn’t have more information, and he can feel the distrust coming off of Potter in waves.
“Did you—talk to him?” she asks.
“He won’t go with me either,” Pansy chimes in from on the sofa next to Blaise, tucking one stockinged foot underneath her.
He can tell Potter hates him with every fibre of his being. It’s written across his face each and every day, and Draco can’t do a thing about it.
“Malfoy,” Potter says, his eyebrows knitting together. “I didn’t
“No,” Harry admits. “You?”
“She’s the best,” Potter says, sounding pleased.
Potter gives a long sigh. Then he lets go of Draco’s hand, and Draco yelps.
“I don’t even take the Prophet anymore. Wouldn’t know if I was.”
“Draco,” Potter says again, and Merlin, he’s so
A fierce whisper startles him from a nightmare. It’s his Draco, there to protect him. He smiles.
“Prick.”
That makes Harry chuckle, and he relaxes for just a moment against Malfoy before pulling away. “You didn’t get off,” he tells him, some unhinged part of his brain wanting to blurt out that
Slowly his anger deflates. Malfoy really does look bad, doesn’t he? And he
Harry’s stomach churns, and he sighs. “If you want to be friends, then I’d like to know something,” he starts slowly, steeling himself. Then he puts it right out there, words spilling onto the floor. “We kissed, Malfoy. We kissed in eighth year, and then you ran away and left me there in the closet, and—and why? Why did you run?”
“Just a moment,” Malfoy says, and then after several seconds he lets out a long sigh. “Okay,” he says, and starts to slowly ride him.
“Fuck,” Malfoy swears, sounding nearly overwhelmed—he’s been so openly vulnerable tonight, and it makes Harry feel breathless. His finger taps at Harry’s arsehole, once, twice, before pressing in agonizingly slowly.
,” Harry says. “We’re not doing this.”
Draco is utterly, vehemently
Kissing him is all Harry can think about when Malfoy looks at him like that.
“I’m pleased it’s working,” Harry says.
So he pulls away, sitting up, and Potter’s arms fall to his sides. He looks almost like he wants to say something, but then he seems to think better of it.
Hermione lets out a despairing sigh. “God, first Neville and Blaise, and now you—this is awful,” she says, looking stricken. “If only I had found the cure for this damned thing weeks ago!”
Esther simply laughs and goes to help a customer.
He pushes it away and stares back down at his book.
Standing, Harry looks at Draco and nods his head toward the door. “I want to go check on her,” he explains.
It’s not signed, though there’s something scribbled out towards the bottom, enough that even when Harry squints at it he still can’t read it. Despite the circumstances, somehow Harry’s instincts are telling him to trust the note. They haven’t had new intel in months. At the very least, if this checks out, the members of the Order at the stronghold will be kept safe.
He stops thinking about Mother then. His chest is far too tight.
Malfoy lets out a sharp sigh. “Go away,” he mutters.
“It’s getting there,” Malfoy says defensively.
Harry feels his heart clench. Draco—Draco may well have just said that he wishes he were dating
“What?” Malfoy asks, breathing heavily.
This will help him get closure from the war, he thinks—it has to.
Three nights later, the Garden is in shambles. Harry walks through the burnt remains in the aftermath, heart racing.
And finds Astoria lying on the floor unconscious.
Shit. He’s already thinking in ‘
getting angry, swinging a punch of his own at Draco.
He sinks to his knees, not even caring that he’s getting wet. Draco is gone.
“Shh,” Harry says, kissing the sudden furrow of Draco’ brow. “We’re not partnered, so it’ll be okay, right? It’s not like there are rules against it. And even if he’s angry—we’ll figure it out. Yeah?”
But it’s fine. This just means he can never, ever let Malfoy know how he feels about him. That should be easy enough, right?
cared about him anyway.
“No,” Draco tells him, “Not at all.”
Harry doesn’t want to read anything into it, especially since Malfoy’s already said that he doesn’t date at all—it could just be two blokes getting lunch together, like Harry and Ron do on occasion, but… still.
“Yes,” Draco says, and for once he doesn’t feel guilty for being a good liar. He can’t look at him. He can’t. “I’d like to be alone.”
He won’t.
“You felt that too?” Potter asks after a pause, and he also sounds like he’s in awe.
“Does she know?” Malfoy whispers quietly.
Malfoy shrugs. “Potions researchers don’t get notified about these sorts of things. Our group has to hear everything through the gossip mill.”
Except maybe Malfoy…
Draco whines then, pressing his hand against the base of his cock. He’s close already. He hasn’t wanked in a week and the dream with Potter left him randy and wanting—fuck, he could probably stroke himself off in merely a few seconds, but.
Or maybe it’s as simple as just wanting to be held, to be needed, as simple as craving the desperate look in Malfoy’s eyes when he leans in to kiss him.
Malfoy laughs softly. It’s not a laugh Harry’s heard from him before—it sounds almost fond, and Harry doesn’t know what to do with that, because it terrifies him and makes his yearning increase tenfold all at once. “It’s your fault for reminding me how lonely
Potter’s arms go limp, and he hangs his head miserably. “I can’t believe it. One stupid mistake and this—
“Harry!”
He brings it up to Harry later that night, having taken the Amortentia for the second time this week. That’s all he’ll allow himself—twice a week, no more. This is already fucking unhealthy as it is. He doesn’t need to get—
“Yeah,” he says quietly. “I do.”
To be fair, they’re more business partners than anything, and Potter hates when Draco calls him his boss. Which is precisely why Draco continues to do it.
Malfoy grins, pushing up the sleeves of his robes, which is a much more attractive action than it ought to be. His Mark is exposed for once, but Harry's gaze doesn't linger—he's seen it several times before, during quiet nights in the eighth year common room. "I suppose we have," Malfoy says.
Draco wants to collapse, or sob, or both. He doesn’t know why he’s reacting like this. He knew when it came down to it that Potter would choose everything else over him, but he can’t help but wish that Potter wouldn’t.
“Oh,” Draco says, swallowing, all of the fun suddenly falling away.
better than this. He doesn’t know what’s come over him today—lately he’s been quite good at lying low, keeping his emotions in check.
Harry shakes his head, gesturing at her to go on, and he heads towards the boys’ quarters himself.
“It wasn’t really that hard on my part once Draco was cured,” Hermione says. She looks at Draco then, her eyebrows raised. “Did you know that part of the sequence of your magical chromosome changed when you mated with Harry? That's why you got better—it changed in a way so that the virus could no longer attach to it at the molecular level.”
“I’m just fucking lonely,” Malfoy says, a sour expression on his face. “And now I’ve gone and admitted it. Isn’t that fucking pitiful? Almost as pitiful as you are.”
He took his cue from Malfoy’s silence, staring out at the lake and thinking about nothing in particular. The early summer sun was warm, comfortable, and soothing enough as to lull him into a sort of calmness that he had forgotten existed. Laying back in the grass, he reflected that this was the first time that he had felt this peaceful in a very long time.
Though her expression is cautious, she starts walking over anyway.
“Thank fucking Merlin,” Harry says, relief pulsing in his blood, and then Draco raises an eyebrow and kisses him again, tightening his grip on Harry’s wrists. Harry groans, then again, louder, when Draco bends down further and starts mouthing at his ear, then down to his jawline. “I—
one dies, but both he and Potter have separately brought that up to Hughes, and both times they’ve gotten the same answer: “Beyond the veil, of course.” Hughes refuses to humor any other questions about the topic.
And—and it’s nice to have Malfoy’s body warm against him too, Malfoy idly playing with Harry’s hand as he speaks.
“No, they wouldn’t—!” Harry started, but the look in McGonagall’s eye caused his words to stop mid-sentence.
“Why?” Harry says, and ducks his head when Malfoy levels a glare at him. “Never mind.”
“So,” he says, letting his eyes drift shut. “I take it I shouldn’t kiss you again?”
“Yeah,” Potter says. “Er… oops?”
“You again,” Malfoy says, sounding disinterested at best, and there’s a pang in Harry’s stomach.
Harry’s eyes actually
He must have gone tense, because Potter’s arms tighten around him. “You’re not going to tell me what you’re thinking about, are you?” Potter asks. There’s worry in his words, and Draco wants to cry.
“Oops.” He dropped it, picking up another one with his own name on it. He caught sight of Draco, who looked slightly wounded.
And Draco would be annoyed that Potter’s laughing at him, but really all he has the eyes for right now is the way Potter’s cock is right in front of him, thick and leaking and curving just a bit to the right. “Can I—?” he asks, breath hitching as he reaches toward Potter, and Potter nods quickly.
“No need to justify your choice, Potter,” McGonagall says, ticking something off on her sheet. “Well then, tell me about your current topic.”
Draco presses his forehead into the pillow in front of him, feeling more vulnerable and exposed than when Harry first saw him naked.
Harry opens his mouth, annoyed, but before he can respond Malfoy hangs his head, exhaustion in the hunch of his shoulders.
“I swear that never will I reveal the contents of my work to those unauthorized, unless under penalty of law,” the witch continues, and Harry, in trance, repeats the words with the other Trainees.
“I don’t believe you,” Draco says, glaring at the floor. “Why would you be sad over me?”
“No,” he says. “Very, very good.”
“Look at me?” Potter says, voice steady as he rolls his hips, pressing into Draco, stomach brushing against Draco’s cock with every pass. Draco has no choice but to look at him, to stare up into Potter’s eyes as Potter grins down at him, even as Draco lets out a surprised sob.
“I suppose,” Harry mumbles.
It’s been his dirty little secret for years that sometimes arguing with Malfoy turns him on. And it doesn’t
things.”
“…Right.” Harry pulled a matchbox out of his pocket, filched from the Transfiguration classroom. “Here, look.” He struck a match on the side of the box. “It’s one of the Muggle ways of making fire. It’s not as convenient as magic is, but it’s a lot more controlled because it’s small and you can blow it out easily.” He demonstrated his words as he spoke, watching the smoke as the flame disintegrated into the air.
“Late night? You look tired,” she comments from behind him.
“Do you mind? I’m trying to eat,” Malfoy says by way of greeting as Harry sits down.
And Potter’s right next to him, close enough they’re nearly touching—oh.
“Really?” Hermione says. But then she tilts her head, thinking, and says, “You know, I can see that, on account of his background and all. I can imagine he wouldn’t particularly like to be bound to anything, or anyone.”
But Draco is there, and he still tastes hot and sweet like before. Draco holds him, and tells him that it’s all okay. Draco is all he needs.
“—Not to be nice to you,” Harry finishes, “I know. But since when have I ever listened to you?”
“Oh, no—don’t worry, he didn’t,” she says, motioning him to the side of the aisle as an elderly witch pushes her trolley on by. “It was just a guess on my part.”
Draco rolls his eyes. “How many times do I have to say yes before you’ll believe me?” he asks, and Harry laughs.
He remembers not really believing it. But Malfoy was never lying.
“Listen,” he says quietly, taking in Malfoy’s posture, fierce and fragile all at once. Maybe Harry will regret this. But he’s already made up his mind. “It’s all right with me if—if you wanted to try again?”
“I mean—” Harry sucks in a breath. “It’s nice, isn’t it?”
All he wants to do is kiss him, really, and he can’t even have that.
“Forgive me,” Draco says, looking at him earnestly. “I… well, I was going to say that I didn’t mean to hurt you, but I think that I did,” he admits, his lips twisting. The Amortentia is confusing, replacing all his feelings about things with completely new ones, and sometimes he can’t remember which ones are real. But he
“I know,” Harry says. “And if you don’t want to... to change things, then we don’t have to.”
It was no question whether or not Hermione would return to school, and Harry figured it was better to join her here than to lie around all day with nothing to dwell on but the war and his own mortality.
If they could just slow down the curse’s progression, it would be easier to study, one of the Curse Breakers said. Right now, it’s simply too quick, too unpredictable, barely even responding to their diagnostic spells.
“Tell me if I’m going too fast,” Potter says, and then he grips Draco’s hip with one hand and slowly, slowly presses inside him.
“I don’t hate you,” Potter says then, and Draco can’t help the terrible way his heart flips in his chest.
Harry wants to cry, because he doesn’t quite think that’s true, but Draco insists that it is.
“Potter, please,” Draco says, but Harry shakes his head.
The third week after everything started, they’re standing in the supermarket, buying bread, when Potter scoffs under his breath and Draco finally snaps.
Hermione beams. “It’s no problem,” she says. “I’ve got to get to work now, but I’ll see you for research later?”
“You’re buying,” Malfoy shouts over the music, and Harry rolls his eyes but relents because it’s not like he doesn’t have the money. He buys them each a glass of the most interesting mixed drink he can find on the menu, something fruity and colorful with too many liquors mixed in it to count, and Malfoy raises an eyebrow at his choice but doesn’t protest.
leaving a mark this time.
“You wonder if they all would have been friends, had they been separated by House,” Hermione continues. All around them, Harry notices other students, older ones, who are tending to sit by year rather than former House. And something else new—barely anyone sits alone, and the ones who are seem to only be doing so because they’re frantically attempting to finish an assignment.
Harry feels like he’s drowning, because God, he doesn’t know what to do. He’s with Malfoy on the sofa, he’s
“Fine. I died during the Battle of Hogwarts, and I came back to life to kill Voldemort.”
Oh. Harry swallows.
“It’ll be okay,” Harry says. “I promise.” He turns to see as Hermione catches sight of them from where she’s standing at the door. Her eyes meet his, and he tries for a smile.
He stretches out his arms, briefly distracted by watching Malfoy paint. “D’you... d’you think we’re friends now?”
He thinks of when Draco was faceless Trainee Four, of a time when they were in one of the Unspeakable breakrooms until three in the morning the night before an exam because Harry was struggling with some of the concepts. Draco made snarky comments the whole night, of course—and how Harry
“Harry, is something going on?” Hermione’s brow is wrinkled in the way that means she’s worried about him, Merlin. He really is not ready for this conversation.
any of Potter’s business because all Draco tends to do in the evenings is lie about in his flat reading novels, occasionally penning letters to Pansy and attempting to dodge dinner invitations from his parents. It’s a bit pathetic, really, especially since he knows for a fact that Potter sees his friends practically every other day—he
“It’s okay,” Draco says, wishing that his heart wasn’t beating quite so fast. “Is there anything else I can do?”
“Let me?” Potter says. “I want to touch you.”
to get up—he’s already Snoozed the alarm function three times. He gives Harry a resigned look. “We have to get ready, or else Robards will have our heads.”
Fuck… no, no—he can’t know, he
Potter can sense magic. That’s not attractive, not at all. Right?
“What?” Potter asks.
Harry lets out a sob. Then he nods. “Yeah,” he says. “It is.”
“I suppose so,” Malfoy says. “I—” He cuts off, walking a few steps in silence.
Draco looked surprised. “You hate leaving the castle,” he pointed out.
Harry swallows. “This might be rude, but, erm. She mentioned at one point that you two weren’t really—a couple, I suppose?”
“Morning, Mr. Potter!” Esther calls from the till, as Harry hurries into his shop, soaking wet, just in time for opening.
“Too much beer for that, probably. I was going to take the Floo.”
“Yes,” Draco says, closing his eyes. “If you really, truly want to mate with me, then I want to consider it.”
He knows this because occasionally people will come to him with questions about spellwork and charms, or they’ll bring in a broken item they want fixed, just like Malfoy has now. Generally Harry shoots them in George’s direction, since George knows a ton more about charm theory than Harry does. But Harry’s well-versed enough to recognize House Elf magic when he sees it, especially since his general specialty is in household charms.
So he might as well just try.
And even further back in his brain, crammed down in a tiny box he tries to keep locked, is the thought that he’d really be enjoying his work more if Potter were here.
, the weight of his own past crushing him because he could never be good enough to atone for it, never—
“I already told you. I’m a coward,” Malfoy spat. “I don’t have anything to do, anyway. I need a job because the bloody Ministry took all of my money. Besides, they’ll find some way to throw me in Azkaban if I stick around, I just know it.”
Vaguely, he thinks about the fact that he smells Harry in the Amortentia now, whenever he opens the vial. And why wouldn’t he? Harry is important to him, so fucking important—
He should’ve known something was about to change.
“Fuck,” Harry groans, because now it’s warm and
“Nothing,” Malfoy tells him shortly, turning so that Harry can’t see the book, but Harry steps around him, trying to grab for it. “Stop—
“I have my sources,” Malfoy says, shrugging. “They don’t care so much about the vampire thing here, as long as you’re discreet about it.”
Potter looks at him then with such emotion that Draco nearly has to look away. “You are,” he says, then repeats it, “You
The thought makes him moan again, and Malfoy nips sharply at his neck and then pulls away, the edges of a smile on his lips. “Take your clothes off,” he says, aloud this time, and Harry immediately scrambles off of him to strip. In almost no time, his clothes are on the floor, and he's standing there in front of Malfoy, completely naked, hard as he's ever been.
Draco quite thinks he could get lost in them if he didn’t force himself to look away right that moment.
“Did you know he’s gay?” Astoria asks abruptly. Which. Harry didn’t. Huh. “Which means that there’s absolutely nothing I can do to give him a fulfilling sexual relationship, even if I wanted to.” She sighs. “I think he misses it.”
this, because I do like fucking you normally, and I like when you fuck me too, so—”
“It’s fine,” he insists, but her expression morphs into disbelief and instinctively knows that if he doesn’t at least tell them
But that still doesn’t change the fact that both conversations he had with Astoria were truly, astonishingly real.
Malfoy is caught off-guard—Harry can see it in the way he opens and closes his mouth a couple of times. Then Malfoy sighs and shuts his book, setting it on the coffee table. “I don’t...” He swallows audibly. “I don’t know how to say this,” he says, and for the first time since Harry saw him out on the stoop that one night, he looks scared.
“Yes! That!” Potter exclaims, hands deep in the dirt, beaming as if Draco has just explained to him the meaning of life.
Draco only stares at him in horror.
can’t help doing the same in front of you.”
Potter makes him feel too fucking aware of the slow, torrid beating of his own heart—the beating that, in seven days, will stop.
Now that Draco’s noticed his—well, whatever,
In the end, it’s Potter that does it—the real Potter, the one Draco sees every day at work and tries his damned best not to ogle in the corridors.
Harry was going to say something like
date him, only to run off with his mate in the end. And then he immediately stops trying to imagine it, because it only makes the despair in his lungs grow stronger. “Merlin, that’d be awful.”
Draco goes impossibly redder. “Incredibly lewd things,” he says. “You probably don’t want to know.”
He sighs, heart twisting in his chest. “I missed you so damned much.”
—Harry hasn’t bottomed in a while, and he always forgets just how it feels at first. “It—it won’t… it won’t fit, will it?” he asks, trembling with the effort it takes to stay still, to refrain from pushing back onto Malfoy’s cock.
The words beat like wings inside his chest. Draco couldn’t ignore them even if he wanted to; The Dark Lord’s wheezing voice is branded into his mind, repeating them over and over, growing louder and louder until every time is like the whack of a hammer into his skull:
Draco wants to say something along the lines of,
“Yes,” Draco says, looking down. “I don’t hate you. But you do make me angry.”
“After we kissed in eighth year, you left,” Harry says, rolling onto his back. “It took me a long time to get over that.”
The other part is devastated.
Back at his flat, he feels like he can breathe again.
Still, Malfoy doesn’t move.
“I know,” Harry says, and then he drops his hand from Draco’s wrist. “I won’t leave you,” he says again. “Promise.”
“Whatever,” Malfoy says, picking up his tea and sipping at it. “I’ll shut up now.”
It’s late that night when Harry hears a knock on his door. God. Bloody Malfoy
He doesn’t look fine. Fuck. Draco must have done something, something that hurt him.
“I know this may sound harsh,” Draco says, “But worrying about it isn’t going to help you at all. If you really want to fix this, you can’t let your emotions or stress get in the way.”
love me? After all that?”
Instead, he starts to talk, trying to chase away his own awkwardness. “I’ve been doing some interesting reading at work recently,” he says, cursing himself afterward for bringing up something so boring.
“You… you were on fire,” Harry’s voice broke. “What h-happened?”
. You use me so you don’t have to think about what you did, or—no, let me finish,” she says when he tries to interrupt. “You use me so you don’t have to think about your past, or how other people look at you now, or about how much you loathe yourself, and—and do you know how much that pains me? I adore you, but you
“It’s not that easy,” Potter says.
Besides a few cursory exchanges about work, they don’t speak for the rest of the workday.
But only for a few moments. And then the reality of everything crashes over him again.
“So you’re saying,” Malfoy continues, “that you haven’t even
“You mustn’t touch the prophecies,” the Keeper of the Hall, Unspeakable Moore, reminds him for about the thousandth time—despite Harry having told her his very first day that he
“Oh,” Draco says, feeling distinctly ineloquent. His head is going all fuzzy from being so close to Potter, and he sips his tea, wishing that he could clear it.
Harry laughs and thinks for a moment about how much he loves him, knocking their foreheads together. He can’t keep from smiling. “I’m glad you brought it up.”
“But I’m me,” Harry says. “And you’re you. You always said that.”
Malfoy looks away, eyes unreadable. “Maybe not.”
” and coming, his cock untouched, squeezing his eyes closed as he bucks his hips against the other man and spurts out over the sheets.
with him? What a fucking joke.
“I mean, we didn’t hate each other in eighth year, you know. So it’s not so odd to be friendly toward each other now, right?”
“Sorry, sorry,
“You have to strike it. Run it against the side really fast. The friction makes it light up,” Harry explained.
But, oh fuck, what if Potter goes home with someone
“I knew you would say yes when I asked about the portrait,” Malfoy tells him. “I knew you would help me. But I really hoped to be able to learn quickly and have it be over with, so I could...” He sighs. “So I could stop bothering you. Except I’m bloody useless at painting, and now you’re—I don’t even know what you’re doing. You’re being
“I know. But.” Malfoy finally rolls to face him, and Harry lies down again, close to him but not quite touching. “Listen, Potter. You’re not...” He shuts his eyes. “When we fuck, you’re not just a body to me, all right?”
Draco frowns at her. “I’m not trying to keep you fucking
“Good luck,” Harry says, giving her what he hopes is a reassuring smile.
“No,” Malfoy says. “Pansy’s been nagging at me to come to one of these things for months, actually. She keeps complaining about missing me, and if I want to visit with her, that means visiting with Ginevra as well—who isn’t so bad, actually—but with Ginevra comes you and Granger and your whole slew of friends.” He lets out a sigh. “Anyway, what I’m trying to say is I think Pansy would be rather angry if you and I got smashed and started a duel later on, you know?”
Draco doesn’t ask him if he’s sure. He only slicks up his cock and then spells his hands clean before climbing over him, fitting himself into the space between Harry’s thighs. “You know,” Draco says, his fangs visible and sharp in his mouth, “I’ve wanted this for a whole lot longer than a few weeks.”
for it. If anything, I’m indebted to
Harry bristles. “Well, you answered in the first place.”
It’s not as bad as Harry was expecting, especially with the extra alcohol in him. Actually, it’s far better than he was expecting, because as soon as they reach an empty space on the dance floor Malfoy pulls him in so close their hips are nearly touching.
Fucking tease.
It takes Draco a moment for him to realize what Harry means—for a second he nearly goes to pull out the vial he always keeps in his robe pockets now, because he didn’t
“Harry.”
For a moment Draco wonders if they should stop, if they should actually try to talk this out.
Potter’s looking at him, worry in his eyes, and suddenly the room feels way too bright. Draco reaches over and grabs his wand, spelling the curtains closed, and a blissful dimness washes over the bed.
“The rest of the Healers are working on curing everyone,” Hermione says, beaming. “I got sent home because I’ve been at the hospital for—well, ever since Draco was cured, actually. But Neville let me test my solution on him, and Gin and Blaise were right after that. They’re safe.”
Potter doesn’t thank him. Draco doesn’t know why he thought to expect it.
And then there’s the sound of a vial uncorking.
“I know,” Malfoy says, looking away. “I didn’t... I couldn’t...” He shakes his head. “I’ve thought that for a long time, okay? And when you first found me out on the front steps back then—I didn’t fucking know what to do about it.”
Of course Potter managed to drag that out of him after one fucking shag.
Harry wants to laugh and is also incredibly turned on all at once, by this strange sort of roleplay, by them acting like—well, themselves. “If you want me to fuck you,
His mouth goes dry when he sees it.
Potter’s face hardens. “I fucked you because I wanted to,” he says quietly.
Merlin. Harry smiles at him, and then the moment is broken when Draco starts to stroke him faster and Harry can’t hold back a gasp.
. Isn’t this what he’s supposed to be doing? “We’re
But they’ve known each other for half of their lives, after all.
“I know,” Draco says, voice hoarse. “I know.”
And now he was here, after the first day of the week-long celebration, quietly drifting through the corridors and wishing he could have had a normal school experience. Because really, he loved Hogwarts, but some (
Draco kisses his forehead, pulling Harry closer. “You know what’s happening,” he murmurs. “It’s because you need to leave.”
The man nods and unbuttons his collar.
Harry’s eyes flick down to Draco’s mouth. Then he shuts his eyes so he can’t stare anymore, because staring at him will make Harry want to kiss him again. “I just—”
Potter pulls out and lies beside him then, and if it weren’t for the bond Draco thinks he might’ve fled. As it is, he lets Potter wrap an arm around his waist, even as he stares blankly up at the ceiling, panicking.
Mate.
“Wouldn’t have come if I could bear it,” Malfoy says back. “Still freezing.”
It’s fine. He can do this. He doesn’t need to be fixating on every single thing Malfoy says and does.
That was the night Harry really thinks he forgave Draco, for everything. It was also maybe the night Harry started working on forgiving himself.
“No,” Draco says. “I mean—yes, I’m sure. And no, I don’t want to wait.” He swallows, averting his eyes. “If we wait, then that means you’ll have to go away again, and having you apart from me for even a little bit is—” He cuts off, shaking his head, and Harry knows exactly how he feels. “Anyway,” Draco continues. “I—I refuse to let my pride get in the way of… of the best thing that’s ever happened to me.”
“Were.”
“I’ve only had one Healer in,” Draco says. “We should be fine.” Even so, he picks up his wand, aiming a locking spell at the door—except it doesn’t work, and he swears. “Fuck, I keep forgetting that my magic isn’t working,” he says, briefly looking dismayed. “You better do it.”
Maybe this isn’t impossible. It’s just one spell.
“Sure, Potter,” he says, and Harry knows without looking down that Draco’s about to take his hand.
He will never see Potter again.
Draco pulls away, giving him a lingering look. Then he carefully nudges Harry toward the bed.
Still, the whole place makes him anxious somehow, for reasons he can’t put his finger on. Maybe because the repercussions for disturbing the time-space continuum are incredibly high, or because unlike the Death department, people actually
Fuck. Draco hates how much he wants this, how much he wants to
“Touch your cock,” Harry tells him, Summoning the lube from his bedroom and tossing the bottle over.
“I need you inside me,” Draco says, breathing fast.
Harry hears the whisper of a lube spell, and he shudders, leaning his forehead against the wall as Malfoy’s hands return to his arsecheeks. But this time, a slick finger darts out to slowly circle his entrance, and Harry can’t help letting out a moan.
Harry wonders if he should’ve brought a book to pass the time, though he hasn’t the faintest idea of what he’d actually like to read right now. “Can I help somehow?”
He shouldn’t be lying back on the bed, spreading his legs for Potter, letting him press nimble fingers slick inside him, aching for him.
“I... okay,” Potter says finally, voice hollow as he hangs his head. “If that’s what you want.”
He’s not on the Amortentia, he shouldn’t be feeling like
It’s not King’s Cross, though. It’s only St. Mungo’s.
“Whatever helps you sleep at night, Potter,” he mutters.
“Hi,” the mirror says in Potter’s voice, and then he grins a brilliant grin and Draco nearly chokes on the longing as he slicks up his dildo, fucks himself with it and comes with a broken ‘
Instead…
Malfoy walks in, looking distressed, his hair rumpled. “I changed my mind,” he says, pulling the potion vial from his pocket. “I need you tonight.”
Malfoy runs his hand through his hair and sighs. “It’s complicated, Potter.”
“I did,” he says, owning up to it. He steps back, leaning against the bathroom counter. “What do you think about? When you do?”
” Harry can’t seem stop himself from moaning now, and so he finally lets go of his inhibitions, little gasps and groans escaping him on every other stroke.
“I’m—it won’t take long,” Draco chokes out between gasps, and Harry nods the best he can while trapped between Draco’s hand and his cock. He focuses on keeping the rhythm the way Draco’s urging him to, and in moments Draco’s shaking, letting out a wordless cry, spilling hot and salty down Harry’s throat.
“Sorry,” Draco says, so faintly Harry almost thinks he’s imagined it. Draco clears his throat, staring down at the boiling water. “I suppose I was more trying to lecture myself.”
“Malfoy?” Potter says, and waves his hand in front of Draco’s face.
it is, to be together as they are, and suddenly he understands how Draco might feel.
Draco’s heart thrums in excitement, and he can’t stop himself from grinning at Potter, giddy with excitement. He hasn’t been on a broom since Voldemort took the Manor. “Yes,” he says, skin tingling with energy as Potter hands him a broom, “Merlin, yes.”
It doesn’t help that Malfoy’s slowly warming up, becoming even more alluring to touch, even though soon enough Harry will have no excuse to be doing this. Which is... unfortunate.
Harry nods, emptiness building slowly in his chest. This is all next to hopeless then, isn’t it? Because if Hermione can’t figure it out, then how is Harry supposed to?
“We can’t just go home,” Potter says. “I don’t know about you, but I don’t fancy seeing what happens when we Apparate to completely different locations.”
“Why not?” Draco asks, and then he almost asks, ‘
Then he reached up, aimed his wand at his head, and cast a cutting spell. Harry watched, eyes wide, as it sliced cleanly at his hair and sent the charred bits to the ground all at once. The blond locks were at an uneven angle now, but they were no longer burnt. “There. It’s back to normal, now.”
Unsureness clogs his throat as he Apparates, and it’s a miracle he doesn’t splinch himself. The building he lands in front of is one in a row of many lining a quiet cross-street of Diagon, its façade unassuming, not even a sign denoting what it is. But he’s been told of things one might do inside; it was one of many things discussed during a long conversation with Charlie after Harry’s ex dumped him. The club sounds intriguing, sure, but Harry’s never felt the need to go.
Instead, Potter nudges his side and says, “Want to Obliviate me?”
“Maybe if you quit interrupting, she’ll tell us,” Draco chides him, causing Hermione to give both of them a look that clearly says ‘
“But he’s still a Death Eater,” Harry points out, even though he doesn’t mean it.
Everything is good.
“Hmph.” Malfoy crosses his arms, but he looks caught off guard, as if the world beneath him has shifted.
“You know what you’re doing,” Draco says snidely, putting back the loaf of bread he’d been about to put into the shopping trolley. “Just mind your own fucking business, would you?”
“Anyway. Um. Why the no dating rule?” Harry asks again.
“Because she wasn’t talking about leaving before you and I fucked,” Malfoy says, his face growing all pinched.
Draco can feel himself going red. He looks away. “I’m just not used to—to touching people.”
They eat in silence for several moments. Harry wants to ask what Malfoy’s doing here, but he’s afraid that Malfoy will leave again if the conversation grows serious.
Harry closed his eyes again, wondering at how Malfoy had not yet told him to leave. He was also surprised at himself, however—since when had he had the energy to make conversation, much less have a friendly argument? Lately, every time he had talked to someone, he’d wanted it over with as quickly as possible. When Ginny had finally left their conversation the other night, citing tiredness, he’d felt a wave of relief even though she was a great friend. And she didn’t cause him nearly as much grief as his ‘adoring fans’ did whenever he was in public.
“It’s...” Draco waves a hand. “It’s fine. I mean. I don’t care if you’re thinking about it.”
Potter falls in line behind him as they go through the bouncers. Once they’re in, Draco checks to make sure Potter’s still following him, then heads straight to the bar. He orders two double Firewhiskies, waving away the offer of a tab—he doesn’t want to get
, willingly holding him even though Draco isn’t crying anymore, and Draco doesn’t have the strength to tell him to stop.
Harry doesn’t fuck him, but he does shove their trousers down, slicking up both of their cocks so they can rut against each other. Draco ends up gasping, his hands under Harry’s shirt, shuddering as he comes between their stomachs.
