“It was a joke,” Ginny said, laughing. “But I do mean it. Don’t settle. Nobody’s worth that, not even Malfoy. No matter what you see in him.”
“You can stop if you’d like.” Draco shrugged, looking down. “Or you could continue rambling. I don’t mind.”
Healer Benson let out a sigh coupled with an almost-fond smile. “Like I said, I can’t keep you. But Harry, I must stress the importance of coming back if this happens again. If you experience outbursts of magical energy like before or anything else out of the ordinary, you should come and see us at once.”
“You sent me a letter saying you didn’t know if you could be with me after all, and then I didn’t hear from you again.” Voice raising with every word, Draco stood up from his chair and threw his hands up in the air. “What was I supposed to think?”
“What, because I told you my sob story? Great, I’ll make sure to pull it out earlier next time.” Malfoy’s voice was reminiscent of their younger years: defensive and proud. It was only the slight shake to it that gave away how much his heart wasn’t in the fight. “If that’s all you wanted to discuss, Potter, I think I’d best be off.”
After a few moments of meeting Draco’s eyes and hurriedly looking away at what he found there, Harry cleared his throat. “Er, what are you doing in Diagon?”
Groaning, Harry ran a hand through his hair. He wanted to scream at them both that they were being idiots, didn’t they know this was Malfoy? They couldn’t trust him!
“I see.” Raising her brows at him, Hermione smirked smugly. “But more partial to one particular man.”
“You were?” Harry asked, slightly confused. “Well, you don’t need to be sorry. It was for the best.”
His mind blanked as he tried to think of any answer other than Voldemort occupying their room. “With the colours, you mean?”
Draco wasn’t the be all and end all of his existence. It was something he wanted to try, wanted to see if it could slot into the life he’d always dreamed of having. But he also knew that Draco was building his own life the way only he knew how. Maybe Harry hadn’t quite come to complete acceptance around knowing that he deserved to be happy—even when he wasn’t fighting everyone else’s battles—but he was close, and he wasn’t entirely certain that he could say the same for Draco. If the other man needed a stable family environment around him, who was he to deny him his penance in the guise of traditional family life?
“Oh, that’s fine then.” Her voice was icy and dripping in sarcasm as she uncrossed her arms and began gesturing wildly. “Are you serious? I didn’t tell you to stop for no reason, Harry. I’m not trying to be a—I don’t know, buzzkill? But that will literally kill you. You don’t understand how bad it is to have day after day. You shouldn’t really have it more than five days out of every month and you,” Her eyes were affixed upon him now, intent with concern beneath the angry front, “Have had it at least five days this last week alone. I also know you started taking it shortly after that first night we stayed here.”
Potter had given as good as he’d got, which was to say he’d made a half-hearted joke about ferrets before turning to leave, looking defeated as ever. Draco couldn’t remember seeing him happy for as long as they’d been back at Hogwarts and he refused to admit that he cared about why, instead focused on keeping Potter’s attention on him. It had only been for a split second, but as the Stinging jinx made contact with Potter’s left shoulder blade Draco saw the hint of a smile cross over his features.
Hermione shot him a sympathetic smile as she handed galleons over to Seamus. “Oh, Harry. You wouldn’t have listened to a word we said.” Turning to the rest of them, she sighed. “That’s enough now, leave them to it.”
“Alright,” Harry said as he sidled back into the booth they were sharing with the round of drinks. “What I reckon you’ve got to do, Dean, is get to know Pansy a bit. Tomorrow at the pub with all of us, try chatting to her more or something. Even just listen in to what she’s saying, right?”
“If that’s the case, then why show up tonight at all?” Draco stormed around the desk, coming face to face with Harry, rage radiating off them both and filling the room. “You barge in here, throwing accusations and demanding answers as if you actually—”
“Mother wants me to come visit more often. She’s not doing well,” Draco admitted. “The healers think they’ve caught whatever is causing her grief early enough to treat it, but I’m still worried.”
“I know why you asked me about it. I knew as soon as you asked, and I know what you’re thinking about now.”
If he was being honest with himself—which he was trying very hard not to be right now—the robes he had been given upon arrival weren’t in a much better state, or the thin underclothes that now covered him. There was a draft coming in from gaps in the stone that were too thin to see but clearly wide enough to chill him to his bones, and with the flimsy pieces of material he was allowed in here he didn’t even know if he’d make it one night without catching a head cold. Draco wondered if they’d administer Pepper-Up for it. It was known that Azkaban had no healers. They’d sooner let everyone rot away to nothing in here than take away the precious resources needed at St Mungo’s and the like.
“Well, they could give you Dreamless Sleep while you’re there. I think you’ll need to get checked after taking so much Wideye though. Your heart is likely working twice as hard as it has to.”
“There he is!” Harry cheered as he scooped Teddy up from the ground and spun him around in a hug. It wasn’t until he placed Teddy back on his feet that he noticed the extra set of feet standing further down the hallway from where Teddy had arrived.
“I will, but…” Casting aside the torrential flood of thoughts as best he could, Harry drew his attention back to the situation at hand. “What about you? What about marrying someone you love?”
“Her and the rest of the world,” Draco muttered bitterly. Looking up, he cleared his throat before speaking. “You’re the golden couple. Everyone loves you. Of course you’re good at marriage.”
A chorus of jeers met him, more potatoes shooting in Harry’s direction as he shot up a subtle shield charm to catch the worst of them before they covered him.
was the best cafe they’d found and had become a tradition of sorts—along with one decidedly awkward attempt at a pub night in August. Harry still didn’t know what to make of it; Draco had insisted upon leaving after only half an hour, citing some nonsense about worrying he wouldn’t be able to hold his Firewhiskey.
It took him a few flabbergasted moments to find his voice and then Harry was saying “yes, yes of course” and tasting wetness as tears he hadn’t realised he was crying found their way to his mouth. Draco was sliding the gold band on his finger and bringing his face down to press their lips together, awkward angle be damned, as their hands clasped together as if to defy anyone who ever made them part again.
“Please.” It was the raw emotion behind that cracked syllable that had Harry pausing in his tirade, waiting expectantly for more. “I can’t do this. Being friends was never a good idea.”
They were giving each other space right now. He chalked it up to Fred’s death and all the injuries her brothers had received, but deep down Harry didn’t even know if his heart was in it anymore. He wanted it to be. He wanted it so bad. There were so few times throughout his life that Harry had felt calm and at peace; when he had been with Ginny it seemed like maybe there was something worth fighting for on the other side. But now that he was faced with the reality of the win, well…
Ginny sighed. “I’m not going to stop you. I just know that you’re only interested in one person and he’s determined to stay in his marriage and raise his son.”
Harry wasn’t okay. Maybe that thought should have scared him more than it did but instead it felt like a confirmation of who he’d always suspected himself to be deep down. The freak who’d been locked away. The boy marked for death before he’d been allowed to live. There was pain in these thoughts but there was also a familiar comfort and he pressed his eyes shut tightly as he vaguely registered the distant sound of objects breaking, something crashing to the floor. Nails dug deep into the palms of his hands as suddenly the room fell silent, moments before his world went black.
Swiftly cut off by Healer Benson’s raised hand, Harry shrunk slightly as he tried not to let his shallow breathing take over.
Hermione shot him a pointed look. “Oh yes, sorry, how could I forget. Malfoy is a new obsession that we have never once before heard about.”
“I can hardly be blamed for the whims of dark creatures,” Draco drawled, trying to mask his discomfort. Guilt was hardly a new feeling these past years, but coupled with the familiar tone of Harry’s voice it was almost enough to make him regret agreeing to meet here. “Ow!”
Making a note on his patient file, Healer Benson shook her head. “You may need to stay a few days for observations, I’m afraid.”
“Why not? I know you’re mostly doing this for your parents but surely they would still want you to be in love with whoever you marry, right?”
“Yeah, but I didn’t know he actually killed people…” Teddy’s eyes flickered to where Draco stood a few steps behind Harry, uncertainty showing. “Gran just said he made some bad choices.”
The hesitation in his step was so imperceptible Harry wondered if he’d imagined it. “I can’t stay. Cillor will show you out if you’d prefer not to floo.”
Hardly daring to breathe, Harry wiped away the tears that threatened to spill and watched as Draco nodded, chewing on his lower lip in thought.
“Hmm.” She fell silent for a moment, the backdrop of childish chatter from across the room a familiar music to Harry’s ears as he waited. “Have you considered that perhaps… and I don’t mean to sound insensitive, but is there any chance you’re projecting your feelings onto him because you’re a bit bored? You never did like sitting around doing nothing. And trust me,” she said as she raised her voice slightly, “I’m not one to call raising children nothing. Mine are pains enough. But you always had a thing for following Malfoy around when you needed something to do.”
“Malfoy?” He asked before turning to confirm his answer. “You’re late—I mean, you’re usually here earlier… Bugger.” At least having the decency to look sheepish as his words trailed off to a mumble, Potter lifted an arm to run through his atrocious mop of hair before shrugging.
But as someone had once pointed out, Harry sometimes had the tendency to be slightly oblivious to the finer details. Even when it came to Draco.
“Harry. Stop pretending like you’re the only one who made a choice here. It’s not like I hadn’t started to suspect something and even if I hadn’t, I didn’t go into this marriage under coercion. You didn’t make me do it. We both made decisions, we’re both adults. I still love you, and… while your love might not be what we both hoped it would be for this marriage that doesn’t make what we’ve built any less real.”
Pressing his head into the back of the armchair, Harry sighed. Curse Hermione’s powers of observation. “Yeah, maybe that too.”
Percy was the one to break it, grabbing his drink and taking a swig before speaking again. “See what your actions have done, Harry? You could be so much more than this.”
Taunts about Potter’s family, though effortless, seemed meaningless after all both he and they had sacrificed. After Draco’s family had fallen from grace. In truth, Potter was miserable enough without Draco’s help these days. It didn’t stop the familiar words falling from his mouth—it had become a habit too long ago—but there was no bite, no hatred. Just a dull need for something he knew almost as well as he knew his own name.
Great, now Malfoy was looking at him like he’d lost the plot and maybe he had, honestly. Nothing much surprised him any more. With a sigh, he kicked at the snow beneath his feet.
He had no idea who was there or how many people were present. All he knew was that he had never seen the Wizengamot chambers so full. Draco suspected this was because the Ministry had started allowing onlookers from the greater public in; viewing trials of well known Death Eaters being sent away for life in Azkaban was sure to boost morale.
Nodding, Ginny turned to the boiled kettle and poured them each a cup of tea. Harry accepted his gratefully, placing the hot mug on the table and watching Ginny carefully sit across from him. Flicking her wand, she summoned the box of gingerbread men that Molly had sent home with her earlier in the week and offered one to Harry. He declined, laughing as he watched her shrug before dipping one in her tea and biting its head off.
“Yes, well the office keeps talking about how good this place is and I thought I should try it myself. What are you doing here?”
“You stayed with Ginevra almost two years after that day.” Draco’s voice was quiet, the uncertainty shining through in his tone. “Merlin, you had another bloody kid. I wondered if maybe—”
“What? I’m only speaking the truth. Those of us at the Ministry were quite astounded when the news broke.”
across the table before turning back to the boys, Harry shook his head, amused. “Don’t believe everything the kids tell you at school, okay?”
With a flirtatious giggle, Ginny swung her red curls to one side as she extended a hand. “Ginny, please.”
He had given up on trying to pinpoint the exact moment the rage had come over him because it hadn’t felt like it was entirely his rage; it felt like when Voldemort used to feel strong emotions and he would feel their shadow, except the feeling was amplified exponentially. The implications of this were less than desirable to say the least. Thinking about the possibility that someone was possessing him or worse, part of Voldemort was still inhabiting his body was not something he had intended on spending his nights doing.
“What are you doing all the time then? Surely you have some weekends free. Or weekdays? Do you even work?”
“We’d love to, Andromeda. Thanks.” Ignoring the grumble to his right, Harry took it from Andromeda and took great pleasure upon noticing that it was embellished with red and gold. Offering it to Draco, he smiled smugly. “Scared, Malfoy?”
“Not Potter.” he corrected softly, before barraging ahead with a raising voice. “I know. I wish I could take it back, I didn’t know what the spell did and I am so—”
Healer Benson raised an eyebrow at him. “With your health is what I was referring to. Do you understand the colours?”
There it was, clear as day. An announcement that a Malfoy heir had been born, healthy young boy by the name of Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy. Harry’s vision went a bit hazy and he couldn’t make himself read past the first sentence, giving up after the fourth attempt.
It was harmless, really, to start asking leading questions to Dean and Seamus over dinner the next week about who they’d each received as gifts. Nobody wanted to tell of course—such was the nature of “Secret” Santa, apparently—but after Harry had plied each of them with a few more rounds of ale they had started to loosen up. He had strongly considered point blank asking Malfoy who he had and what his game was, but the look on both Ron and Hermione’s face every time he’d mentioned the prat in the past week were enough to dissuade him from their bad graces at the very least. So it stood to reason that he could simply ask everyone else who they had, cross them off the list he kept in his pocket at all times and see who was left.
“I can so,” Draco said with a pout. “Fine. You want logic? I’ll give you logic. First of all: you know we’d barely see each other anyway. We’ve both got kids—”
Tipping back half of his coffee in one mouthful, Draco placed the mug between them and leaned back in his chair once more with a nonchalant yet genuine smile. “If you insist.”
Prongs carved from ice and snow stood shimmering in the low light and Harry smiled as he took in his handiwork, Teddy now talking with Nick in quiet tones as Harry moved closer to Draco.
Not buying it, Hermione raised her hands in despair. “They’re addictive, Harry! And lethal if there’s too much in your system. You’ll have to take more and more to get the same effect so eventually your body will simply shut down.”
“We missed you at the pub last night,” Seamus said across the stack of boxes between them. “You getting on alright?”
“It only seems like it’s ‘out of nowhere’ because you are the most oblivious idiot I have ever had the misfortune of knowing.” She rolled her eyes as she ran a perfectly manicured hand through her hair. “Listen to me, Potter, because I’m not going to say this twice. Everyone knows you’re obsessed with Draco—don’t interrupt me! It’s very obvious—but he’s convinced you can’t possibly be interested in him because you’re too busy accusing him of evil wrongdoings to show interest like any
It was habit, more than anything, that drew Draco to seek out the Astronomy Tower night after night. That was what he told himself as his stomach dropped every time the final set of stairs came into view. Yet to make it up to the top, most hours of his early mornings were spent curled up on the first step thinking over what had led him to this point in his life.
“No, I’m not done.” Taking a steeling breath, Harry pushed on. “Maybe we jumped into things too soon when we first did, but we managed two bloody years of things being okay between us. I know it wasn’t much, just taking time where we could find it, but it was still two years, Draco.” Harry’s voice cracked with the weight of his words, tears brimming in his eyes. “Then you ran at the first sign of conflict. That kid was just parroting some nonsense he’d heard his dad say, and you didn’t even give us a chance to get past that. You’ve had excuse after excuse and while I understand why, I need to know that you’re actually in it for real this time.”
The next time followed quickly after: he was eating his dinner with Hermione at the dining table. Harry gasped suddenly and clutched his chest before he could think and Hermione turned to him, concerned.
With a short, breathless laugh, Harry shook his head. “Of all the things you could say sorry for…” Trailing off, he saw Draco avert his eyes to the mess they’d made of his study. “That wasn’t the one I came here for. If anything, I should be sorry for getting carried away.”
Seamus grinned, reaching across the counter to slap Harry on the shoulder. “Absolute legend, mate. Thanks, Miss Chelsea. Reckon you could grab me one of those Scrambler kits, then?”
“Master Harry does not usually ask Kreacher when he worries. Does Master Harry want Kreacher to find information for him?”
“Harry.” Hermione’s voice was firm and he sunk into the chair, losing all possible resolve to pretend nothing had just happened.
Laughing at her indignant tone, Harry rolled his eyes. “You wouldn’t have had the chance if I’d made the tea.”
“Thought we agreed not to mention it before you got home,” Harry muttered under his breath, a soft snort from James the only indication anyone had heard him. “Er, right. Yes, Al. I was going to tell you all when we got home.”
Harry knew he was spiralling. He knew this was a sign that he wasn’t okay. But he couldn’t stop: the emotions he had been holding back for so long refused to stay at bay now that he’d opened the floodgates. With a bittersweet sigh he blamed it on everyone asking him to open up about what he was experiencing earlier. Surely he hadn’t been so bad before everyone had tried to make him talk?
“Well, Harry. Tea?” She gestured to a table by one of the giant windows that looked out on presumably the Manor grounds. “I can have Cillor bring some for us now.”
How much of that statement felt true anymore? They had been at each other’s throats far longer than they’d kept pleasant company. Maybe Harry had become too involved; not in the same way Draco apparently had, but in that he had pinned too much hope on redemption and turning a new page. Had he become taken with an idea, rather than with what he was actually being presented with?
The old elf stopped muttering at Harry’s raised voice and with a frustrated exhale, Harry sat upright again.
When the clock struck nine, Luna gathered everyone into the sitting room to open their designated Secret Santa gifts. Harry had given up trying to make contact with Draco at this stage and was instead decidedly
Turning to Ginny with a strained smile, Draco nodded by way of greeting. “Apologies. I didn’t intend to intrude on your Christmas.”
“I’ve been wondering… What would you think about moving here? We’re together more nights than we’re apart these days, and I know,” Draco said quickly, silencing Harry’s immediate response. “We spend most of our time at your house. I love it there, I really do, but I can’t give up the Manor, Harry.”
Shaking her head, Ginny gave him a soft smile. “I’ll stay here to watch the kids then. Just in case you’re not back tonight.”
“Just, don’t.” He turned away from Harry, but not before he caught sight of the tears in his eyes. “I’ll owl you, okay?”
“Right now I don’t have to do anything,” he said, cutting Hermione off as he raised his spare hand at her. “If that changes, yeah, maybe, but not now. Narcissa’s really sick and he’s spending more time over there with her every month. I barely see him, and we’re keeping things secret while he’s still with Astoria. Honestly ‘Mione, right now we’re just two friends who have sex sometimes.”
“You must be Ginevra Potter,” came the familiar voice behind his right shoulder. “I’m quite the fan of your column.”
If nothing else, Harry knew he’d made for a night of prime entertainment for his ex-wife. Ginny was by his side tonight, both technically invited of their own accord but choosing to go together to save the hassle of finding dates or showing up alone; Ginny’s current girlfriend was off in Norway with her husband and their two sons, and Harry was exhausted by the thought of the press seeing him here with anyone else. They were enjoying a child-free night: Albus and Lily were with Molly for the night, with Harry planning to pick them both up before getting James from King’s Cross for the Christmas holidays.
“Unless congratulations are in order?” Draco’s expression was unreadable, head tilted as he held Harry’s steady gaze. “Andromeda mentioned that you and Ginevra were still living together.”
There was a pause before Draco spoke, his overly nonchalant tone telling Harry just how interested he was in the response. “So, are you still as interested as you were when you made a scene in the middle of that crowded cafe? I’ve never been able to go back, I’ll have you know.”
Stepping out into the street as the lights changed, Hermione nodded. “It would probably be easier for you to do something anonymous. I’ll have a think on it.”
Draco sat there for a moment looking down at the snow covered street, face frozen as if stunned. He blinked once, twice, before turning to meet Harry’s eyes with a puzzled expression, eyes searching his face as if seeking the answers to all of the universe’s mysteries.
Malfoy sighed, the moment he gave in apparent across his features. “She’s hardly the mail owl I had in mind.”
“No. I think I’m managing quite fine without him. I just…” Trailing off, he saw the hint of pity come into Hermione’s eyes. “I didn’t actually think he would leave Astoria when we split, but a small part of me hoped he would at least want to talk.”
“You’re also going to finish that, because it’s hardly fair that I’m the only one with protesting tastebuds in this family. Then we are both going to forget this conversation for a few weeks if only to get through Christmas without a Weasley family breakdown or worse, an intervention.” She shuddered, standing to take her glass to the sink. “I know you’re incapable of not thinking about Malfoy, so perhaps you can use the next few weeks to think about everything you’ve finally realised and then we’ll decide what to do once everyone’s done breathing down our necks. Think you can manage all of that?”
Recognising a nervous habit as Draco watched Harry pick at his fingernails, there were a few moments of silence before he spoke again.
He couldn’t even imagine what a normal life would be like. He’d never had one, not really, and every time it had appeared like maybe, just maybe this time would be different, the people he cared about were ripped away from him again.
One of the benefits of being unemployed for almost six months was that Harry now had plenty of time to look after the kids. One of the drawbacks of being unemployed for almost six months was that Harry now had plenty of time to look after the kids.
Pulling him in for a hug, Hermione rubbed his back as she whispered in his ear. “I’ll love you no matter what. You know that right?”
“If it’s just not having much time, then I really don’t mind this being casual while we figure things out.”
Over the past years he’d sought out solitude more than ever before, despite being surrounded by schoolmates and houseguests at every turn. Draco had become an expert at Occlumency out of necessity—though he had already been excellent after years of forced training from extended relatives and his head of house—and knew better than anyone the importance of clearing your mind when people may be listening. He didn’t think there was much chance of needing to block out unwanted visits here but instead was thankful for the knowledge he’d gained, because now he could apply it to himself. The possibility of spending years in this cell was more time than Draco cared to spend alone with his thoughts and the longer he could prolong the onslaught of emotion, the better. He knew it was only a matter of time until he truly had to process what he had experienced but for now, this was the course of action.
He tried his hardest not to resent Healer Benson for the lack of both Wideye and Dreamless Sleep to beat his feelings of exhaustion and reminded himself that he was lucky to be in his own bed, not laying in St Mungo’s right now as he stared at the ceiling. Perhaps sleep wouldn’t be so bad tonight. It was ironic in the worst kind of way that now he accepted the possibility of sleeping tonight, his body refused to actually comply. The split second nap he’d had earlier must have tricked his mind into thinking it would be a few more days before rest came again.
“Sorry to interrupt,” she said, stepping into the room and holding out a Christmas cracker to the two of them. “But I thought you might like to share one of these before Harry leaves for the Burrow.”
A loud hiccup ripped from Ginny’s throat and she sighed, grabbing Harry’s drink from in front of him and downing it in one go. Wiping a hand across the back of her mouth she waited a moment—ignoring Harry’s indignant protests at having his drink stolen—and then grinned.
“Harry, for Merlin’s sake.” Draco raised his hands, exasperated. “You are out of line. Do not tell me how to raise my son or what to do about my marriage.”
The next hour was spent dodging glares from Pansy as she stuck by Draco’s side and together they avoided all of his attempts at conversation. He only managed to occupy the same room as them for half a minute at most, and even that was only because Neville had accidentally spelled the kitchen door closed from the inside for a short while. This meant that Harry barely got a word in with Dean either—he was tailing Pansy like a lost puppy, which would have been sweet under any other circumstances—and all in all Harry was not enjoying how this Christmas night was shaping up.
Confused, Harry reached out a hand and then thought better of it, dropping it awkwardly between them. “Why do it then?”
The lake cast patterns on the walls of the common room as their friends continued conversations by the fire, unaware of the significant moment Harry was sharing with him. Once again Draco had to remind himself that this was their reality now, that nothing would take this away from him.
She snarled, coming closer to Harry and shaking her head. “What I mean, Potter, is that the two of you have been dancing around each other for bloody years now and I am sick to death of hearing Draco complain about it. I told him to be a Malfoy about it and have an actual conversation with you but if he cornered you at work—“
“We’ll have him drinking cocoa before the morning’s out,” Harry said, laughing as he saw Draco sighing and shaking his head across the table. “But bring him the horrible dark drink before he changes his mind and leaves, would you?”
Knowing that he was the reason Ginny was hurting, knowing that she had spent time dwelling on this and praying that she’d been wrong, well. It broke him to realise the damage he’d done — and there he was again, making this about him. As he placed the glass back on the table and coughed up the taste of acidic death, he saw that Ginny’s plan was the best way forward for both of them. It was what she needed and if he was going to feel any amount of okay with the situation he’d landed them in it would have to be through letting Ginny take the lead. Making any big decisions now wasn’t going to change how they felt, it would just give him a temporary feeling of penance that would drag out their family’s pain in the long run.
He saw the blissful smile and glazed eyes mirrored back to him on Draco’s face for a few precious moments before the other man blinked quickly, seeming to snap back to his thoughts.
Hermione was the one to point out that perhaps they had overstayed their welcome when Teddy started to drool on her lap. They’d all lost track of time, of course; Christmas morning at Andromeda’s was only supposed to be a short stopover before they made it to the Burrow for lunch but after the week they’d all had it seemed to be just the reprieve they needed, with many exciting announcements being shared. Even Andromeda had gotten in on the celebratory eggnog as Ron passed it around, all the while looking thankful that Teddy seemed more interested in climbing all over the houseguests than being entertained by her.
There was silence for a moment before he heard Draco sigh in response, the telltale sound of metal chair legs scraping on the floor as he stood. “Go home to Ginevra, Harry. I don’t mean to sound terribly rude but I cannot talk to you if you’re trying to figure out your marriage. It feels inappropriate for both of us and I…I don’t want to be responsible for breaking apart the golden couple.”
Turning back to the mugs in front of her, Ginny shrugged. “Don’t think on it too much, we’re getting divorced now.”
Pale blonde hair twisted up on top of her head, highlighting the sharp features of her undeniably beautiful face. Her complexion was alabaster—they would have very pasty kids, Harry thought to himself—with rosy tint on her cheeks and lips. She was in casual wear from what he could tell: a simple turquoise sweater and dark wash jeans. The reflection from her engagement ring was so bright Harry thought it might blind someone on a sunnier day than today.
“…And you thought you’d try asking me if he’d already bought it for himself, so you could beat him to it if he hadn’t.” Harry grinned, shaking his head at his friend. “Unless he got it while I wasn’t in, you should be safe. Tell you what, I’ll check the purchase history now.”
“What I’m saying, Harry, is that he’s blinded by generations of prejudice—and inbreeding, to be quite frank with you. Scorpius has helped him to want better than that, but for our son, not for himself. You’re on the galleon when you say he doesn’t think he deserves the happy ending you could be for him.”
Harry sighed, wishing for the millionth time this week that the press would find something more interesting to think about. “I don’t think me telling them I like men is going to help.”
Snorting, Draco looked up at Harry from behind his mug. “Still can’t believe you named him Albus Severus. They’d be rolling in their graves if they knew.”
With a sigh, Draco shrugged. “I want to hope that’s the case.” His eyes searched Harry’s face for a moment, their grey depths seeming to find whatever it is he was looking for before he stepped forward into Harry’s embrace.
That was how Harry found himself spending a winter evening strolling the streets of London beside Draco Malfoy. They were both bundled up thick, Teddy a few steps ahead at all times and chattering non-stop at Nick about everything he saw without really expecting a response from any of them. It had been a few hours of enjoying festive lights, Christmas crowds and pleasant conversation with Draco.
“Harry?” Draco asked, bringing him back into the moment. “You could at least pretend to be listening.”
“They care about you. They would want to know. From someone who’s seen too many families breakdown because they had no idea someone was suffering… Just consider it.”
Frowning, Harry shook his head. “Are you sure you want to pretend we’re still together? I mean, what if one of us does eventually want to start seeing someone?”
There was silence for a moment, and he peeked up from underneath the mop of hair that had fallen into his eyes. Ginny was stifling a laugh, and he rolled his eyes before sitting up and glaring at her.
“What?” Harry felt a chill to his bones, unsure of what had brought about this behaviour. It had been so long since he’d had to defend Draco… He certainly wasn’t expecting it from someone who had spent as much time with him as Nick. “Where did you hear that?”
Past that aspect of conversation his memories weren’t so clear; he’d skipped lunch that day and the wine had hit him harder than he intended. There had been a lot of name calling, that much he could remember.
It wasn’t until he heard the unmistakably not-Draco’s throat clear to his left that Harry realised he may have been a bit rash in his actions and he froze, heart beating out of his chest.
With a heavy heart he saw that Apollo had returned without an answering letter and Harry sighed, fishing in the cupboards for a treat and scratching the tawny feathers atop his owl’s head. It had been fruitless to get his hopes up after all this time. He was a grown man with one child sleeping in the other room and another on the way in a few short months. Draco had made his stance on any communication very clear and he should have respected that instead of taking the other man’s child as an opportunity to reach out.
To his children’s credit, they had taken it better than he had anticipated—Ginny told him he was a chronic over-worrier these days—which he was eternally grateful for. That didn’t make it any less nerve-racking, however, as he brought the three of them to Malfoy Manor to meet his boyfriend for the first time.
There was a pause and he turned to look at Hermione fiddling with the glass in her hands. “You do love her right?”
Blue eyes met green in silent challenge as they stood side by side in front of the cloudy mirror in the once-again flooded bathroom.
“I am!” Harry snapped. “Why do you even care? You’ve made it perfectly clear that you don’t care about love, stop making fun of me for doing it.”
“Harry James Potter,” she began, in the voice that Harry knew meant he was about to get an earful, “if you would be kind enough to stop mocking me, I would like to point out that of the two of us I am the only pregnant one and furthermore, this is my third pregnancy. I would also like to point out that this is entirely your fault, so stop being a prick and let me complain nonsensically.”
“You as well,” he said, accepting the kisses that landed on each of his cheeks. “You’ve met my, er, Ginny. Gin, this is Astoria Malfoy.”
Harry read the parchment in his hands once, twice, three times over before crumpling it into a ball and throwing it with more force than strictly necessary at the waste bin in the corner of his enlarged cubicle. It missed by a mile, ending up on the floor for the milliseconds it took Harry to decide to send a wandless
Gingerly using his toe to lift the edge of the pile in front of him, Draco shuddered at his reality and his train of thought halted. He was a prisoner. A convicted criminal, in Azkaban. He knew it was temporary, that surely they couldn’t keep him in here indefinitely; the Wizengamot had been trying to put away as many Death Eaters as possible to make an example of them and instill faith in the public but a few glowing testimonies in his favour had worked wonders for the possibility of spending any time less than life here. His mind was just stuck on an infinite loop of Shacklebolt’s voice saying “Draco Malfoy, you are hereby sentenced to Azkaban,” before two stern guards had grabbed either bicep and carted him out of the hearing room to a temporary holding cell within the Ministry.
“I do,” Harry admitted, taking a tentative step forward and looking down as he gave Draco’s hand a squeeze. “But for some stupid reason, you’re all that I want. So if you can promise not to run away again, Draco, then I think we might be able to give this a try.”
The cracker steadied in Harry’s hand as Draco took the other end with a firm grip. Their eyes met and Harry caught the slight twitch of Draco’s mouth as he raised an eyebrow in challenge.
Draco pressed his palms to his forehead and sighed, letting his shoulders slump with his exhale. He was in for a long few years, that was for sure.
“That was prior to what I just witnessed.” Turning to Ron and Hermione now, Healer Benson gave them a reassuring nod before speaking. “Would you both mind giving us a moment?”
Harry shook his head. “You know what? Moments like this, with the two of us and all of the kids… I don’t think I’ve ever been happier, Draco. I’m so glad we gave us a chance. If this was how I spent every day for the rest of my life, I wouldn’t mind.”
“Miss Granger, I understand your frustration.. Unfortunately there isn’t a whole lot I can do at this stage.”
Unable to suppress the groan he let out as a sudden stab to the chest had him doubling over, Harry looked up to see if it had managed to go unnoticed. There was a sharp intake of breath as he realised the world was tilting on its axis. He blinked and suddenly noticed that there was an unmistakable fifth person in the room. How had he missed them entering? The panicked thoughts amped up another level at this lack of observation until the room began to right itself and he froze, realising what he was seeing once again.
“Maybe there shouldn’t be an us.” Draco’s voice was low, unrepenting. “You see what I’ve been saying all this time? If two kids who barely saw the war can’t forgive me, how will the rest of the world?”
Shuffling his weight from side to side, Potter fidgeted with his too-long robe sleeves—would someone please find him something that fit?—as he took a moment to answer. Draco waited impatiently, sensing the shift in the air around them as Potter finally made up his mind.
Closing his eyes and setting his head back against the chair with perhaps slightly more force than usual, Harry sighed. “Maybe, but I’m working on it.”
“We have heard the evidence against you, however before we reach our verdict we have a few additional witness statements to consider.”
Draco didn't forgive his father for his choices, and he had lost respect for him quite a long time ago. He pitied him really. But like any child who is raised in his father's image, always wanting his praise and attention, it was a hard relationship for Draco to dismiss entirely. He wasn't sure he would have made any decisions differently had he been in his father's position. Lucius had never really been a great man to model himself after, but he was still Draco’s father and it was hard to make that separation sometimes.
Shaking her head with a fond smile, Hermione paused for a moment before gently squeezing his forearm as she spoke. “Why don’t you try your hand at dating? If you’re really sure you don’t want to reach out.”
Harry pondered that for a moment, understanding where Narcissa was coming from. “Why don’t you just leave too? Surely the memories haunt you as well?”
“It would hardly be proper, Harry.” Astoria’s voice was soft, her gentle smile seeming almost genuine now. “Though I daresay Draco’s parents already know of his preferences.”
It took a few moments for each of them to let go of the other—smiling at your ex-rival was bound to distract you, Harry reasoned—and when Malfoy finally extracted his hand from Harry’s grip he took a step back, looking around uncertainly.
“Of course. No offence, but I’d hardly put my family and friends through that based on a few conversations with you.”
She closed the door behind her and Harry looked down at James in his arms. He’d already grown so much in the four months since they brought him home and though he was definitely sleeping better these days, Harry still didn’t envy Ginny the time she spent settling him while Harry was at work through the weeks.
“I’ve only really got happy thoughts about Quidditch, y’know? And that’s kinda what we’re doing. Cancelling out the bad stuff and making it happy again.”
“Have a coffee with me?” Harry blurted, panic setting in as he saw both faces look at him in varying states of confusion. “I mean, er. Surely you’ve time to stay for a quick coffee? For old time’s sake?”
Descending the staircase now, Draco’s voice was strong yet gentle, something in his eyes Harry couldn’t quite place. Had it been anyone else, he would have called it pity.
Giving himself another once-over in the mirror, Harry turned and walked back into his bedroom and sat on the edge of his four poster bed while he waited. After another minute or so, another loud noise announced Kreacher’s return.
Slipping them on, Harry realised he’d said at least the last part of his musing aloud and sighed. “‘Mione, he was practically jumping for joy. I can’t take that away from him, it’d be cruel.”
Turning, Harry came almost nose to nose with Malfoy; it seemed that even with Harry’s slight growth spurt over the past few months, Malfoy still had a few inches on him. The sharp lines of his face were less harsh than they'd been when Harry saw him at his trial earlier that year. He even seemed less pointy somehow, like he was finally growing into his features, and it wasn't an unpleasant look on him. It was strange, being this close to his childhood nemesis and not feeling any of the usual animosity; the urge to rile him up seemed to have died and in its place was simply... nothing. They stood like that for a moment before Harry took a quick step back, not realising how close they’d been while he stared.
. Got it.” With a lopsided grin that had Draco’s stomach flipping, Potter took his hand back and used it to point at the stairs. “Shall we?”
Whistling to himself, he headed back out to the bar and waved for another round of drinks, ale for the boys and a lager for him. While he waited he contemplated what Malfoy could possibly be doing, suggesting a gift swap like this. It seemed so… Harmless. Wholesome, even. Which was precisely why Harry knew something sinister was underway. Harmless and wholesome were words that you applied to kittens, not Draco sodding Malfoy. He vowed to get to the bottom of this, if it was the last thing he ever did.
while i'm not the hugest fan of the epilogue, this IS an epilogue compliant fic - we're only a few chapters away from that year, and i am very excited for you all to read how this develops and plays out 👀
“Harry, then. I am Healer Benson, on duty for the fourth floor tonight and from what I gathered during my discussion with Nurse Weilin and your diagnostics, this looked to be a simple case of stimulant overuse.”
Harry perked up, realising they had the same destination. “Oh! I was going to look at kneazles for James.”
Maybe the type of love he had once so struggled to understand was actually the love he’d felt all along.
There were lots of hugs and tears once they made it out the other side of the brick, Teddy’s ecstasy at finally stepping foot on the platform being quickly overshadowed by all other emotions that came with leaving home for the first time to attend Hogwarts.
He groaned, shooting a quick look across the room to see if the kids were paying attention. Absorbed in their own world as always, he breathed a sigh of relief. “Close call, but I think we’re in the clear.”
Kreacher bowed low once more, locket shaking as he shivered with anticipation. “Master wants Kreacher to be keeping secrets from the Muggle-born,” he muttered as he resumed his standing position. “Kreacher has never been told to do this before, Kreacher will be retrieving the potion now!”
Watching as Draco launched into an animated retelling of what Hermione had described to him as absolute hell, Harry grinned at the enthusiastic hand gestures that accompanied his story. There was a lot of tension within both the Ministry and the wizarding banking communities over the current legislation Hermione hoped to pass; the details were a bit hazy to Harry, but he knew they had been motivated by some of her conversations with Griphook all those years ago about wand lore and goblin rights. Entertained as Harry was by the thought of Hermione and Draco in a room together—from what she’d described, Draco was actually responsible for a lot of the financial decisions at Gringotts—he couldn’t help but get distracted by his actions. The way the light cast by street lamps caught his eyes, the stray piece of hair that had slipped loose from his winter hat. How his long spindly fingers moved with each word, telling a story of their own.
“What if…” Harry trailed off, wondering how best to move forward. “What if we just do this, for now? You’re right about us having too much history, and the papers are horrible at the best of times. And I know you won’t leave Astoria, and we’re both somewhat responsible for this one,” he said as he gestured to Teddy in front of them. “I’d hate for things to get messy. Having you cut contact every other year is a bit difficult now that we’re seeing more of each other.”
“It would be if it offered any explanation for what happened earlier.” She paused, pulling a purple thread out for closer inspection. “Interesting…”
They were well and truly most of the way through the bottle of Ogden’s finest when Ron mentioned the notice in the Prophet that morning.
“That’s rough, mate.” Seamus clapped Dean on the shoulder, grimacing. “Wouldn’t wanna be in your place.”
“I’m not answering that,” he said even as he heard Hermione’s laughter in response. “He’s made it very clear where he stands.”
“Draco Lucius Malfoy, you are here today before the Council of Magical Law accused with the crimes of following He Who Must Not Be Named and taking the Dark Mark. You are further accused of housing him and his Death Eaters in the Malfoy Manor, keeping prisoners in the cellars, torturing muggles, allowing Death Eaters into Hogwarts during your time there as a student and fighting in the Battle of Hogwarts, seeking to bring Harry Potter to He Who Must Not Be Named.”
Opting to ignore pleasantries in place of bluntness, Harry stood across the desk from where he sat and squared his shoulders, trying to exert more confidence than he felt at seeing Draco again. “Albus told me you’re divorced,” he began, the accusation clear in his voice.
“Alright. I’m only going to say this once, mind you.” She took a deep breath, fiery gaze staring into his soul. “You’re incredibly selfish and stubborn, Harry. I was the same. I stayed because it was the right thing to do, and I don’t regret it, but there is a world out there that we haven’t been part of. We settled down so quickly, we were so thankful to be alive after the war that we didn’t give ourselves much of a chance to live.” Pausing to look down at her stomach, Ginny smiled, voice low when she spoke again. “I know you still don’t think you deserve more than this. Merlin, you don’t even think you deserve this some days. I see the way you look at James and Albus. You’re living in the past, blaming yourself for all the loss and you don’t need to keep putting yourself through that.”
“Is this about what Astoria said?” Harry gulped, seeing Draco’s shoulders flinch slightly at his words. “Because I don’t care—”
Harry slumped back against the chair, thinking it over. He couldn’t think of himself as anything but an Auror, truth be told. More than that he couldn’t see Draco turning around and leaving his family just because Harry was stupid enough to care about him.
He lay there waiting for the telltale sound of footsteps coming up the stairs, hoping that Hermione would be too caught up in preparation for tomorrow to come and mother him immediately. There was a big legislation push, he knew that much, and Hermione had somehow slotted herself right in the middle of negotiations.
“You wish you weren’t interested?” Draco’s voice was cautious, guarded, eyes trained on Harry like he was a Basilisk about to strike.
The ire dripping from her voice sent chills across Harry’s back and he was thankful not to be entirely on the receiving end of it this time. He felt Ron shift beside him, clearly uncomfortable with the tension around them but also not willing to face Hermione’s wrath if he tried to calm her right now.
Rounding the corner out of Flourish and Blotts in a hurry as he clutched Hermione’s present to his chest, Harry checked the time on Fabian Prewett’s old watch and swore. He was going to be late. Knowing that Robards would forgive him for it didn’t make him feel any better about it either; the special treatment was really wearing on his last nerve, despite it being what got him into the Auror program to begin with. Taking a steeling breath, he soldiered on with the mission of finding a suitable gift for Teddy before sprinting back to the Ministry. Today was his last chance to peruse Diagon before the holiday events kicked off and though he loathed being out in the lunchtime crowds, he knew it would only get worse if he ducked back after training finished later tonight.
“But you hate letting—oh.” Harry groaned. “No. Now you’re treating me like I’m fragile. I’m fine.” At her raised eyebrows, he continued. “Really! It was just another stupid trial.”
It looked no different to many of the other colours to Harry—he was pointedly avoiding making eye contact with the gold for comparison—but he wasn’t the trained Healer who presumably knew what each colour signified. His curiosity was certainly piqued, but he didn’t want to draw attention to any possible problems by asking questions, so instead he waited.
“Just making sure I understand what you’re saying, Healer Benson. You, St Mungo’s, an institution designed to aid witches and wizards experiencing health issues, don’t actually have the resources to help Harry right now? While he, a wizard, is experiencing health issues? Is that what you’re saying? That you… Simply don’t do that here?”
He stared blankly as Andromeda led the way back to the car Harry had driven them in, tuning out most of the chatter coming from beside him as he wondered what had kept the other man. Draco had said he would be there. Obviously he’d let Andromeda know he wasn’t coming or she’d have been more concerned, but that didn’t make Harry feel any better about his absence.
He looked forward at her and was glad to see that at least for now, there were no tears in her eyes.
Laughing, Harry took a drink of the cocoa and was pleased to find that it tasted just as Christmassy as he could have hoped for. With the taste of cinnamon on his tongue, he took a steeling breath before throwing caution to the wind and casting a quick
“How, what exactly?” Draco questioned, even as he suspected he knew what was being asked. “Words, Potter.”
Laughing, Harry looked between Teddy’s obvious glee and Malfoy’s poorly concealed amusement. “Is that so?”
Rolling his eyes, Malfoy took the proffered hand and sealed the deal with a firm handshake. “You’re absurd.”
Shoving both hands into his pockets, Harry mustered up what little energy he had left to follow her and hoped that any discussions could wait until tomorrow. Nightmares be damned, right now he would be the first to admit that he needed to rest before losing the ability to function entirely.
“You don’t have to dance around it, Harry. Friends is what you want. I think… Perhaps not. Not right now at least,” he amended, gaze dropping to the floor once more.
Shaking his head slowly, Harry cleared his throat. “I wasn't sure. Draco’s spoken about you, of course, I just haven’t seen any photos in the
It wasn’t anything new to her, which hurt him more than anything. Maybe she hadn’t expected him to be so forthcoming about it but apparently he wasn’t the only one who had been giving their marriage a lot of thought in recent years. There was no shouting, just a resigned understanding and for that he was grateful. There even seemed to be an undertone of relief, both of them finally having all their cards on the table.
It was another case of right place, right time that had Harry running into Malfoy again almost a full year after the Eeylops incident. Harry was wandering back from town, appreciating the celebratory decorations that had been artistically placed through the park behind his house. Though Christmas was a few days behind them, the tree still stood tall and proud at the centre circled by countless light installations of various colours. Andromeda had told him that this was a slightly grander scale of festivity than the town usually engaged in over the holiday season, understandable considering the turn of the millennium only three short days away. Some of Edington’s residents had grumbled at the thought of such a display, their rural town gathering more tourists than was normal for the time of year. Harry was of a different opinion; he adored the fact that he could see a tangle of wires that lit up in all colours of the rainbow to shine ‘
Harry led Malfoy down the hallway and through to the kitchen before rummaging through the cupboards for two whiskey tumblers and a bottle of Ogden’s he was yet to open. They then sat at the table, an awkward silence falling over the room broken only by the sounds of Harry preparing their drinks. He was grateful that at the very least he'd had the decency to keep this room tidy in his drunken stupor last night.
“Not quite. He can’t marry for love because the person he’s in love with is already getting married.” Winking at Harry, Astoria smirked. “Congratulations, by the way. April is a lovely month for it.”
He was brushing his teeth later that night when the pain struck him again. Harry knew he couldn’t ignore this much longer, with the amount of anxiety and fear that rose in his mind each time he felt the stabbing feeling in his chest. Bracing himself with both hands on the sink in front of him, Harry raised his eyes to look at his reflection in the mirror. His pupils were dilated and where his toothbrush stuck out of his lips pressed tightly together he could see some foam residue from the toothpaste. Trying to focus on the image looking back at him instead of the pain that was eating him from the inside out, his eyes followed the line of stubble-bordering-on-scruffy-beard along his clenched jawline down to his shoulders that were rising and falling far too quickly as he hyperventilated.
Shuddering at the thought, he took a few steps closer and inspected Potter’s face. The moon’s light illuminated his angular features as he paced towards the window before turning, casting his face into darkness. Draco marvelled at how though his face held so many conflicted emotions, his body seemed to move with an ease that he didn’t know if he’d ever witnessed before. Taking a minute to appreciate a moment he’d likely never bear witness to again, Draco allowed a soft smile before reminding himself why he continued to frequent this corridor.
“Oh.” Stomach feeling slightly sick at that—probably the whipped cream, he reasoned—Harry gave a grimace in return. “Glad I caught you before you left then.”
Raising his hands as if approaching a wild Hippogriff, Harry quickly spoke. “No, no! I’m just… wondering.” He finished lamely and hoped Kreacher would believe him.
In a rare bout of emotion that Harry hadn't seen for years, Draco began pacing, hands tearing through his hair. “I am not in love with—that’s not what this is! I just… Fuck,” he added as he swivelled to face them both. “I’m sorry.”
Glancing back and forth between them both a few times, Ginny sighed gently before giving him a small nod. “I’ll see you at home?”
“Forget about this,” Draco began, waving off Harry’s protest before it had even left his lips. “Forget about your Saviour complex for once in your bloody life and let me marry someone who yes, I may never love in the same way as what you have, but I still love all the same.”
Harry nodded, heart racing as he considered whether he felt more terror or excitement at the prospect being presented to him. Equal parts of both, if he was being honest with himself.
“Shacked up with a Death Eater, eh? Seems a bit counterintuitive to your whole thing, if you ask me. Still, I suppose you have let things run away from you since quitting the Aurors. Shame, I really had high hopes for you Harry. Shouldn’t have thrown your lot in with this crowd.”
Sighing, Healer Benson fixed Harry with a stern look. “Trust me when I say that leaning on your friends for support is not making their lives harder. What will make it harder in the long run is if you shut them out now, when you likely need them the most.”
Opening the door, Harry froze as he saw Hermione standing in the hallway with her arms across her chest. She didn’t look impressed and he groaned inwardly as he realised she had likely heard most of his exchange with Kreacher.
There was an awkward silence, during which Harry refused to make eye contact and instead focused on absolutely everything else surrounding them. It wasn’t until Malfoy cleared his throat that he dared glance back at where he stood.
Harry felt his breath hitch as Draco reached out a hand to brush snow off his hat, making its way down to the tangled curls that stuck out beneath it before resting on the side of his face. The world stood stood still as he froze, eyes meeting Draco’s in a whirlwind of emotion.
“Yeah,” Seamus said with a grimace. “Shame he won’t make it back ’til the New Year but hey, work’s booming.”
Never taking his eyes from the boy beside him, Draco felt the corners of his mouth pull up in a hopeful smile. “
Hermione furrowed her brow, suspicious look crossing her face. “Just how many times has this happened, exactly?”
“Your family, that’s what.” Eyes downcast, Draco mumbled his next words. “I want to make a good impression.”
“Listen, Draco—I only meant, did something happen that night at the pub, y’know. You left and barely replied to my letters since then.”
Harry sighed, shaking his head. “I don’t know, Gin. One minute things were fine, I thought we were about to kiss for Merlin’s—“
“I’m here to tell you that stubborn as my husband may be, I’m glad you seem to be equally so. He’s a fool, and even more foolish to try denying how taken he is with you, but Merlin, he needs you. There’s a lot he will probably have to work through before he can admit to that, and there’s only so many times I can repeat myself before we both end up in Janus Thickey.” Astoria laughed nervously, shaking her head before letting out a sigh. “Those years with you were the happiest I’ve ever seen Draco. I don’t know if you’ll get much from him before Scorpius makes it to Hogwarts, but losing his mother changed Draco. It’s hard to explain, but I think he may almost accept what you’ve been trying to tell him these past years.”
Hastily opening the door and ushering Malfoy inside, Harry panicked as he tried to think about the state he’d left all the rooms in. The kitchen should be safe, right?
“Oh.” Draco tried to keep a neutral tone, realising that his mother’s story had more truth to it than he’d initially suspected. He watched as Harry kept a stoic face, the movement of clenching in his jaw the only sign he thought about this more than he was letting on. “Want to go there?”
Their eyes met, the cascade of emotions that passed between them enough to fill a million lifetimes. Above all there was hope, and the promise of something worth fighting for.
. “It just all seems… Like a different love than what I imagined. Remember how you described loving Astoria? That Christmas when I—”
“Harry…” Draco hesitated before shaking his head and sighing. “It’s your marriage. Who am I to tell you what’s horrible? Ask your wife if you really want to know.”
He looked down to the stone floor under his lightly-clad feet and sighed. The sparse rays of light highlighted how filthy it was in less-travelled corners but also how worn down the vast majority was, and he loathed to think of how he would be inevitably pacing within a few weeks. It was a shock to his system to be alone in an unfamiliar place after weeks of supervision prior to being sentenced. He hated it, all of it. The unjustness of his situation, the choices he’d had to make, the fact that he was living in a cell and the fact that he had no escape. What Draco truly hated most was the fact that in a place so full of misery and darkness, he felt lighter than he had in years. And more than anything, he hated admitting that, even just to himself.
