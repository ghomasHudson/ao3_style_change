“It’s extraterrestrial lifeforms, Draco,” Hermione said.
The tunnel was damp, rough stone-walled, and it seemed to take forever to get through it. Through the gradation of his steps, Harry could tell that they were very slowly rising up as they traversed it. Finally, the light from their lanterns was supplemented by the blue-white glow of moonlight, and he knew they were nearly there.
It’s the fastest beer he’s ever drunk, but Harry suddenly really wants to be anywhere but here. He drains the last of it, turns to set it down on the bar, and when he turns back again, his chest brushes against another chest. Harry attempts to stutter out an apology, but nothing comes of course, so he just gives the woman a coy smile.
“I know it isn’t healthy or normal to require another person in order to stay alive, but honestly, when has my head been healthy or normal since the war? We both know it hasn’t, and…that’s okay. You make me as normal as I can be. You’re my meaning of life. Without you, there

“Your mother moved on,” Draco says quietly. “You saw her in the Forest. You
“Oh, right,” said Hannah.
“Exactly what I said, Harry,” says Luna. “If Draco means so much to you, then maybe you should consider putting in for a transfer as well.”
“But there’s nearly seven billion people on the planet!” said Petunia.
“Yep,” said Harry.
Draco shrugged, but suddenly seemed uncomfortable. “Yeah, fine. Look, I was thinking about the Separation and Conjunction bits. Uncle Sev made that healing potion in third year, the one that worked on everything he tried. He didn’t try it on one particular thing, though. It was always too dangerous.”
Millicent’s fingers clenched around Harry’s thigh. “Are you—really okay?” she asked, working her throat. “I mean, you sound okay, but are you really okay?”
“I haven’t,” Harry says. “You’re the first.”
“Your cat,” said Harry, ignoring Hermione’s indignant squeak. “Not Peep. The less annoying one, before him.”
Muggles or their technology. All he knew was they needed more help than they had.
don’t think he’s fit—that’d be fucking grim—but my mate Piers has this weird thing for him. No idea why. Says he’s fit, though. And you’re like Piers, right? I mean, you’re not into women.”
“The times you’ve done it…” said Draco. “Now that I think of it, you didn’t seem to realise what you were doing. Like it was instinctive to use magic that way. Could be part of your intuitiveness.”
Malfoy turned to look at him, and Harry couldn’t help the tired, sated grin he gave him.
Harry could do a chase. Just ask Voldemort.
“Mhm,” said Yaxley, staring at his phone again. It vibrated then, and Yaxley tapped out a few words. He stood from the table, sent the dishes zooming off to the department kitchen to start washing themselves. “Time to go.”
“I’ve so many of those I wouldn’t even notice another,” said Malfoy.
“I’m stunned
Malfoy stares at him evenly. “Then what do you want?”
Draco smirked, and Harry realised at once that he’d been purposefully led astray. He narrowed his eyes, felt his body heat up with a weird desire at being one-upped.
“You were abducted?!” Potter said.
“Not yet,” Harry said. He felt a nostalgic piece of himself break off in that moment. The new flesh it left exposed was delicate and un-calloused, but it wasn't damaged. It left a spot open on him that he could fill or leave as it was. He thought maybe he'd one day like to fill it with Malfoy. He thought Malfoy might fit it well. Harry would know it when it happened.
” Minerva said, “is still in Atlantis.”
Hermione or some random wizard—either way, Harry didn’t get off.
“She’s worth something to me, so I’d like to pay for her.”
Harry sighed, and continued his tour through the wing, carefully letting Mrs Black peek out from his summer jacket. It was too hot even with just the linen, but he hadn’t been able to hide her sufficiently otherwise. They travelled through several more rooms before Mrs Black hissed, “Stop!”
Harry, too creeped out by potential caterpillars, did not sit down again. Instead, he wandered through the ruins, brushing his hands along the old stones and feeling very small indeed. Hermione found him not long later as he was standing before the bigger of the two giant penises, imagining the horror of having his cock snapped off. He couldn’t look away from the carnage; it was like a broom wreck.
“Tip for tip,” Malfoy said. “That’s how we’ll do this. Me first.”
Dudley turned back to Snape, who was currently petting one of Harry’s earliest Scottie attempts. “Anyway, I picked something up for you, Professor Snape.”
Even from his bed, he could see the blush suffusing her face. She was always a little surprised when he or Ron managed to show that they actually paid attention to her.
“Right, yeah,” said Harry. “Probably.”
Harry insists.
Dudley gave him a sharp, blue-eyed stare. “You can’t really think us Muggles are going to try to kill you all.”
what a vagina looks like?” Draco asks, leaning up on his elbows to get a closer look. “It’s so odd.”
“That’s why it shocked me,” Harry breathed. “We have to tell the others.”

that day.
using the allure.”
Water was the way to that. For a brief moment, he’d been interested in the blood magic that had let him keep his own life, but it had been, on the whole, much too creepy for him.
Hermione rolled her eyes, continued talking, her voice raising in pitch with each sentence: “Oh my god. The Tyson’s Chicken plant dumps
,” said Ron. “Now you know what you’re missing.”
,” says Harry.
He stepped back, watching Andromeda and then Draco saying their goodbyes to Teddy, but he couldn’t leave yet. How were Rosie and Teddy already eleven? Were Harry’s own Hogwarts years really that long gone?
“Money,” said Draco, suddenly.
“His father was killed by an Azkaban guard in May, but it was hushed up. There was an investigation going on and Malfoy had to give testimony right before NEWTs. A dozen witnesses came forward to say the Auror had acted out of protocol, but charges were dropped two days ago.”
“Right,” said Harry. “You, uh, you want something to eat? I’ve got some mince pies in the icebox I could heat up. Mrs Weasley made them for me before I left, so they’ll actually taste good.”
They had a lovely view. No wallabies yet, but Harry was hopeful. The sun began to set and the light from the candles made Ruby’s beard sparkle and shine. Still he said nothing. It wasn’t bad, really. Harry could get used to someone who didn’t want anything from him but a shag and love. He was quiet himself. And it was—it was a comfortable sort of quiet.
For a long moment, none of the reporters or officials said a word. Then one of their mobiles chimed and he dropped it on the grass, his fingers clumsy with the same sort of adrenaline Harry knew all too well by now. But it broke the spell, and people started shouting questions out, not even bothering to raise their hands first.
Harry stepped out of his rooms and set the ward so Ms Danger could come and go as she pleased—hopefully to return her library books on time—and headed for the front steps to wait on Malfoy, who would probably be late because he was a Slytherin.
the ice shelf. Two Cane Corsos slept beneath an open window.
Draco finally looked at him. He smiled, a little hesitantly. “It’s a permanent transfiguration. I’m good at those. Most people’s won’t last more than a few weeks, but I’m not most people.”
He took Draco’s hand and their eyes met and held. It wasn’t said, but in that moment, Harry knew Draco loved him, too. And maybe, he’d loved him this whole time, these whole twelve years Harry’d been visiting him or these whole eight years Harry’d known he loved Draco, too, or these whole fourteen years since they hated one another so forcefully in sixth year.
How had they done this magic?
Neither Ron nor Yaxley chose to elaborate on what that deeper motivation was. Harry drank his tea, feeling dazed.
“Right,” Draco said. “Let’s go.”
Harry exhaled in a rush. “Have you got the picture?”
Harry shrugged. “The memo said you could decline for your own death, immediate family member death, or women’s issues. I didn’t think anyone would believe I had immediate family, and I worried my paycheque might stop if I said I was dead personally, so I ticked the box for women’s issues and sent the form back. No one noticed I’m not actually a woman so I figured they also wouldn’t notice if I actually didn’t show. It’s not my problem that Draco’s annoyed I thought of it first.”
“But the other Nations are suffering, too, Malfoy,” said Hermione. We can’t fix one area and not the other. It’s not right.”
“No more a nutter than I,” Petunia said crisply. “Or Millicent, Draco, and Harry.”
He sloped off to the refreshments table and hoped that some enterprising student had come by earlier to spike the punch. Upon pouring himself a glass, he found that not to be the case, but positioned himself in a corner to nurse it anyway. Networking was not his thing. It wasn’t long before his peace was interrupted.
Ron approaches the pen, frowning down at Harry and the Wolpertingers. He’s always been a bit strange since coming into contact with the brain tank during their battle in the Department all those years ago. The effects had come on slowly, weirdly… a mania that built and built until he had his first episode. The intuition didn’t come with it, but it was heightened by it. Ron’s always been psychic. It’s just that now he knows it.
Harry did his best to keep his grin from turning into a grimace. There was no accounting for taste. And he’d been thinking unsuitable thoughts about Malfoy anyway, so he wasn’t one to talk.
Draco grimaces. He falls against Harry, letting Harry support his weight, and at that point, Harry knows there’s no way this can’t be an emergency. The Bitch Battalion do not show weakness in public.
Harry checked on his Cold Cure potion and added in the final ingredients. Merlin, this potion was annoying to brew. He’d started it six times already and he usually ruined it within the first twenty minutes. This was only the second time he’d made it to the third step.
Malfoy frowned. “I can’t even get to the visualisation.”
. Odd in what way?”
Harry uncorked it, blew once, and chugged it before Ernie could warn him further. It burnt his throat going down, but when his sprouting migraine immediately disappeared, he could not be bothered to be upset. “Oh, Merlin, thank you, thank you, thank you,” he said.
, made something in Draco twist oddly.
“I can hardly represent ‘life with meaning’ any more easily than I can ‘something worthless,’” Harry said, scowling.
But Draco wasn’t done: “You had
“Did he also tell you Jones put your name on the No Fly list as soon as she heard about it?”
. Potter wiped his eyes with the back of his hand, pocketed his wand. Then he stood from the bed and went to—of course—comfort Millicent.
Harry huffed. “Luna.”
soul mate than hers, being as he was largely attracted only to men and androgynous-looking women.
He’d played a dangerous game with himself, and he was about to lose. Hard.
And Harry was going to use every single pull his name could get for them afterwards.
Harry doesn’t really think he needs him as his Auror partner. Maybe everyone is right and Harry really does have a death wish. Maybe he’s not really in a mental place to be an Auror. But Draco is, and Draco’s strong and capable, and Harry shouldn’t stand in his way. So how could he need Harry then, if not as an Auror? Harry isn’t sure. He’s not good at anything else.
Blaise was already toying with the idea of doing exactly that, if his close proximity to the line and contemplative expression were any indicator. Lee jogged over, tapped his toe on the other side and then grinned. No sirens blared.
Harry had known it would be a crowd; he hadn’t realised it would be this big. Which was stupid, of course. They’d wanted as many people as possible there. Queen Sostrate had said she’d make it happen.
Harry pocketed Mrs Black before she could reply, feeling a little awkward. “She told me you were her favourite.”
“We’d probably have enough power to hide the Earth,” Malfoy said, somewhat grudgingly. He looked up, eyes sharp, and added, “But we don’t. And we don’t have a hundred years to go breed with Muggles, so what do you suggest instead?”
Finally, they arrived at the front steps of Hogwarts, where Headmistress McGonagall was waiting, arms crossed. There was a
men,” Ginny said. “Don’t you, Harry? That’s why we didn’t get back together, didn’t you know, Hermione? He never even wanted to have sex.”
“She’ll be pleased it got a good home,” Ron said, hopefully.
Draco startled. He charmed his tea hot again, sipped at it. “Sometimes.”
right now. I won’t be owned by anyone, Golden Boy, not even you.”
“Oh, come on!” Harry said. “We’ve been friends for over ten years and he still hasn’t attached me to his bloody office wards.”
Harry squeezed her thigh beneath the table and she shot him a grateful look before returning to the menu. She cleared her throat.
“Only if you plan to use her for
At dinner, it becomes clear.
“They probably will,” Neville said. “But it’s happening whether we like it or not.”
The final Thestral enters the ringed catwalk and everything in Harry’s body untenses; it’s got to be the billions of little pheromones let off by Malfoy’s allure. There’s really no other explanation for how
It was a strange feeling to be so in sync with so many other people, but the strangest feeling of all was being synced with Draco. Hermione’s words came back to him. He remembered:
“We can’t walk straight up to the door,” said Malfoy.
happened last night?”
“We can call her LJ,” Harry adds, unmoved.
He brought in Mrs Black’s portrait and propped it on the counter so she could complain about the Muggle appliances, then he turned to study the Keurig intently, looking underneath to where the coffee came out and flipping up the lid to see where the water went.
“We’re here,” Harry said, raising an eyebrow. Mrs Black never slept. “You want to come out or are you going to stay locked up in my luggage the whole time?”
The common room had cleared save for the Slytherins still huddled together in their protective formation by the fire. They seemed to negotiate homework help like prize Abraxans, and tonight was no different. Millicent was driving a hard bargain with Goyle that involved things Harry’d rather not think on.
, just enough, and said, “It’s time to go.”
“Master would like another scotch?” says Kreacher, voice remarkably even all things considered.
Harry chuckled again, and shook his head. “The bite I can attest to.”
Harry swallowed. His throat was suddenly dry. Good Merlin, this bloke was actually here to date
,” Harry breathed, realising something entirely different. He rolled to face Draco, and Draco copied the movement. For a moment, it felt like this was normal, and usual, and something that Harry could depend on. This was the part where he became his own Alchemy, where he understood the beauty hidden in the transformation. Separation was when all the components created during Dissolution came apart and expunged what they didn’t need, to make themselves pure and ready for Conjunction, free of inclusions and elements of
They’d fallen into some sort of unspoken Hufflepuff-induced truce. Or trance. It was fragile and uneasy. Harry felt his skin crawl every time Malfoy got near him, and he didn’t know how long they could last before it all blew up. There was too much between them to just forget. And then of course, Malfoy might murder him.
“Er,” Harry began.
No. That was a lie. Harry knew the uncomfortable and unbecoming ways a heart worked. He knew how one wanted—needed—to be near the person one loved, even when there wasn’t a scrap of a chance. He’d let himself get ripped off because of that for years, after all.
“Does anyone else besides your sister?”
Then she ruined it by wrinkling her nose at the state of his hair, and making a frustrated, abortive attempt at fingering it into some degree of decency. She shut the door behind her as she left, and Harry turned back to Ron, who was staring at him with one cocked eyebrow.
So the spell wasn’t useable in its current form. Queen Sostrate had been right about that. But it was a place to start. A plan to work from. They needed something different.
“Miss?” he called. “Miss, get help!”
“No problem,” Draco said. “You can probably drink it easier without them.”
afraid of Muggles,” he said, remembering his conversation with Malfoy. He knew his own anxiety was illogical. “I mean, we have magic.”
. He gave my children traits they’d have done better without!”
“What happens when they try it?” asked Snape, no doubt already knowing the answer. He approached the front of the canvas and stared intently down at the two of them. “Furthermore—you have the ability to attempt a line of inquiry I never had. What happens when an
It didn’t help that not even magical people knew what was going on.
The Mr Redfellow who joined them at their table just as they were sitting down may have had something to do with it. Mr Redfellow worked in magical politics, though he was cagey about which side. Regardless, he was very attentive towards Mrs Malfoy, and Mrs Malfoy was very aware of it, if her little smiles were anything to go by.
“So did all the witches in the dark ages, and not all of them made it out alive,” Hermione reminded him with a raised eyebrow. “But I will grant that even magical society has matured since then. It’s standard for all magic-users to have their own wand now, for example. Human civilisation didn’t really accumulate enough distributed wealth to allow for that until a hundred years ago or so. Even in the 1800s, many families shared one or two wands among themselves.”
“What?”
Harry threw his head back, moaning. God, this never got old. When he was as slicked up as he could be, he guided himself slowly inside. Draco’s fingers curled against the wall. He breathed in deeply, slowly, and Harry put a hand on his back, rubbing in soft circles, as he adjusted.
Draco made an annoyed sound, and tossed the letter in the fire. When Harry caught his eye, he was scowling. “What?”
Harry quickly pocketed his mobile. “Nothing.”
They’d previously been arguing over Draco’s owl using Harry’s bed to digest mice on, which Draco thought was perfectly reasonable since Harry most often spent the night in Draco’s, and which Harry thought was quite unreasonable because it was disgusting. But they stopped at once at the sight of Hermione’s hair flying behind her as she neared them. She had a newspaper in her hand and she looked horrified. Pansy was right behind her.
Potter frowned, but said nothing.
He slung his bag over his shoulder and followed Draco out of the lab and back to his rooms the corridor over. Draco opened the door before Harry arrived and held it open for him.
Millicent laughed and clapped her on the shoulder. “Good girl. Draco, suck it up and do it proper.”
“I heard it behind Hogwarts’ wards,” Draco admitted. “Was it a disaster there today?”
There were too many variables.
He spared only a moment for that useless thought before he was back to attacking Draco’s buttons, one by one. Draco writhed beneath him, his chest heaving as it had that time, so long ago, in their office. Harry’s throat closed up, and for a moment, he was desperately sad for the time they’d lost, before he shook himself out of it and, with shaking fingers, pushed Draco’s shirt open.
, asked. Which meant Albus was certainly being used as part of Luna’s Transfigurations lesson planning back at Hogwarts.
“Well, we learned from Chieftess Fontanne and Genevieve that their biggest concern is the oil spill, and the worry of another one. There’ve been three in the past decade, including one just last month when a barge had a collision and spilt over 400,000 gallons... and a really big one when Hurricane Katrina came through. And with the British Petroleum company drilling there now, they’re worried about another big one. The water’s all dead along the coast and it’s full of sludge. Padma got you some samples, Harry.”
? That rag? I don’t read that one.”
She swam through the door to the next room, and they could hear her rooting around in the cabinets. Harry swam over to the closest loveseat-chair thing and tried to sit without floating away. To his infinite pleasure, Malfoy followed him over. He applied a warming charm; it was just too fucking cold at the bottom of the Chesapeake Bay.
“Or you wanted to see if I was up to no good,” Draco said, eyes narrowed.
The shop owner looked pleased when he and Ron re-entered. Harry approached the desk, and, inwardly cringing, tossed his head casually, to flick his overlong fringe away from his forehead. He could practically
Draco said, “Distillation. Three stones distilled into their most perfect formulations.” He pointed to the first one, elixir that was sparkling and crystal clear. “Mercury, the life force.” He pointed to the stone, still blood-red and strong. “Salt, the body.” He pointed to the last stone, made of reduced wine, spirits, and decayed plant matter. “And Sulphur, the spirit.”
The ship moved slowly out of sight, and then they were alone again. Or as alone as anyone would ever be in this world created and monitored by extraterrestrials. When it was gone, Malfoy jumped up, dusting himself off and pulling Harry up, too.
He redirected his attention to Draco. “What’s wrong?” he asked again. He looked at the clock. “And shouldn’t you be at work?”
, Harry snaps. The man hesitates. Harry stands up, projecting his most menacing face, and he drops the towel and Apparates out.
“Oh, she’s plenty smart. Just won’t do you a lick of good when it comes to ward-setting. That’s all anyone ever wants a kneazle for, really. Good for detecting things that aren’t what they seem, and good for knowing when things aren’t what they’re supposed to be, too. Helps with monitoring wards and putting them up. Also work as pocket sneakoscopes if you can stand the fur on your cloak, but not this one.”
Hermione and Draco arrive together, both looking like they’d not slept the night before. That makes four of them, then.
“You are really good at Potions, aren’t you,” Harry muttered. He stabbed at his banger and felt genuinely bitter about life for a moment. Malfoy was ace at Transfigurations
Harry tried to slide by without making much of it, but he knew Draco, so he wasn’t surprised when Malfoy stopped abruptly before the tapestry. Harry paused at the icebox, and looked back at him. He was staring at the tapestry, so close to the threads that his nose nearly touched, and one hand hovered above his mother’s name as if he’d touch it.
Malfoy never disparaged other Hufflepuffs, current or former, outside of the Sett, and he never talked badly of Muggleborns. How could he have when Justin Finch-Fletchley and Mandy Brocklehurst were Muggleborn? It would’ve been against Hufflepuff values, which Malfoy, oddly enough, cared about. But other than that – yes, very much a prick. He and Ron still sniped at one another frequently whenever Hufflepuff and Gryffindor had a class together. He still called Harry ‘Scarface’ (within their dorm room).
Imagine that.
Lucius and Narcissa exchanged yet another look. “I know, darling,” she said.
“Oh, god, it’s too late,” Mrs Dursley said, her voice high. “This is what I saw in my visions. They’ve started!”
“Yeah,” said Draco. “Death is the catalyst. It’s the Azoth that we were missing. It was good that I died.”
?” she asked.
“I stopped coming around because I figured out I wanted you,” said Harry. “I realised I had been… courting you, without even knowing it. For like, eight years. And if I’d been coming to your office once or twice a month for eight years, and we hadn’t even so much as gone for a drink together, then I was probably out of luck. I stopped coming around because I didn’t want to fuck up and show it to you, and ruin what had turned into a pretty nice enemyship.”
Harry is beyond arguing about the Amortentia by this point. It occurs to him that he cannot recall having ever won a single discussion against Luna before, and the stuff wears off in twenty-four hours anyway. Better to just pretend like it’s not happening and hope Hermione doesn’t connect the dots when she smells grass and toothpaste at his show. He sighs. He’s already been up for eight hours and it’s only noon. There’s supposed to be lunch sometime today but he can’t fathom when that magical event might occur.
, he thought.
She hung up the phone and sighed. “All right, it’s nearly six now and I’ve been here since seven this morning, so let’s make this quick, okay?”
“Is something the matter, Harry?”
“Um,” said Harry. He shifted on his feet. He’d never felt so uncomfortable in his life. At least the first night he’d had Portkey lag and pleasant drunkenness to soften the awkwardness. “It’s been really great getting to know all of you. I had a good time scuba diving and then again at the…” Fuck, what was it called? “The rock. I, um, wish that we could all continue on to Greece together, but Luna says no, so I guess it’s time to hand out Snitches.”
“Not entirely stupid,” Draco allows. “But not worth missing lunch for.”
They got a table outside on the patio. Harry wasn’t the only one who sighed in relief when they sat down.
Harry huffs silently.
“Mother,” Draco sighed. “What kind of ideas are you giving Scorpius?”
Finally Draco pulls the door open, allowing Harry to step through.
“Harry?” Ginny whispered. “Is that you?”
The Queen opened her eyes, stared up at the blank, stone ceiling above them, and took a steadying breath. “We must hurry. They know we’re doing something.”
“Dildos don’t count, Malfoy!” says Hermione, and then the door to the Thought Chamber closes behind her. The room spins around Draco as the doors change position, causing his hair to lift in the subsequent breeze. It stops and his hair flutters down again. He winks at Harry before turning and following Hermione back to the Thought Chamber, through a different door entirely.
Malfoy grinned. “Little did they know that they were missing out on such a hot piece of arse.” He punctuated this with a quick, deep thrust that made Harry moan like a slag. “Merlin, Potter, your arse is divine. I could fuck you for days.”
“What does it feel like to hybridise? I’ve got indigenisation down, I think, but whenever I try to grow my snout or tail, I…just can’t.” He sighed. “McGonagall will never take me on if I can’t transform.
Harry cleared his throat. “Do you want to… ah…”
Hermione knocks back the rest of her cold tea like it’s a shot. “Dark hair,” she says dully, pulling at her own which is, at best, ‘medium brown’. “Fit.” She has that, at least. “Clever.” She smiles, then forcefully pushes it down. “I don’t know. His likes were fairly generic. He mentioned, er, penises. Well, he said ‘cocks’, but, you know. He likes those, of course.”
,” Harry says, screwing his eyes up tight.
Draco woke with a start in an unfamiliar place. Next to him, someone grumbled and shifted, and Draco forced his heart to slow down. It was just Potter. They were in a tent. In Cornwall.  He grimaced; he’d been having the worst dream.
“Me,” came a clear voice behind them.
Harry scrubs at his face. He’s not going to cry. He’s lived—and died—through worse than this. “But what if we did anyway?” he finally says, looking up and meeting Draco’s eyes. They’re so clear to him, even now, even at this distance. He can see them in his mind’s eye as close as they’d been when Draco leaned into him, panting his name, their bodies undulating together. It was not so long ago. But it feels that way, and truth is not subject to reality.
,” said Draco, but his voice was hoarse when he said it, and Harry knew exactly—
“We didn’t even get a fuck out of it,” Draco said, trying for levity.
Harry scowls and rubs at his eyelids as yet another miserable hallucination of Draco materializes. The curse is lasting longer these days.
At least he’d got the bloody immortal jellyfishes.
“Mum was telling them about when you and I went to Australia, the first time. And when you, you know.”
They said goodbye and reluctantly, Petunia hung up the telephone.
He shook his head. “Nothing,” he said. “Just tired.”
“Making me want you,” Draco said into his skin, as he trailed a slick trail of kisses down his neck. “I can barely function as it is, and then you go around counteracting Polyjuice because you
, Draco had said. Not just Teddy. Not just one person. People. Did it mean what Harry hoped it did?
“Maybe,” Harry allowed. Same difference, in any case. He started thinking about potions that worked with need. Felix Felicis, for one. Nutritive potions, maybe. Those shared a few common ingredients; both used a distilled water base. Purity, perhaps, could link them in some way, and then there was—
“Oh, right.”
“Do you feel free?” Harry asked, when the silence between them didn’t seem to be abating.
Draco’s eyes flicked to him, but his expression didn’t change. “Good morning, Potter. Although to call it morning is a stretch; it’s nearly noon. Feeling better?”
The Merwoman screeched back, and Lee, Hermione, and Padma looked relieved.
Malfoy rolled his eyes at him over his shoulder. “He’s being dramatic. What’s one extra portrait when he already has one here?”
The reminder, this first free moment to really think since Dudley’s abduction, made Harry’s heart ache painfully. He laughed, and it nearly turned into a sob. If his eleven-year-old self had known he’d one day be desperately sad and worried about Dudley’s safety—that he’d do

He growled, flipped them over, his hands bracing on either side of Potter’s face. Potter looked up at him with dark eyes, his mouth parted and already panting.
Harry eyed Hermione warily. “What about McGonagall?” There was an abrupt and violent uproar from Hermione-Dark-Lady, and Harry hastily scooted back on the rug, putting as much distance between himself and her claws as possible.
Harry repeats, lips quirking.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Pull the other one. How about the blackmail?”
“He trails his fingers from my temple to my jaw, leaving little tracks of magic behind. My eyelids fall shut and he traces over the lids, down my nose; his fingers catch on my bottom lip and tug it down. Gasping, I swirl my tongue around the tips, and it’s just as arousing as I’d always thought it’d be. He slides his fingers down the front of my chest, and the buttons on my shirt slip open in his wake. The fabric falls aside.
Hermione swiped to the next page in her newspaper. “Makes tea and coffee. Stick a pod in, put a cup underneath, press the button.”
He followed her gaze and immediately recognised it. “Oh for fuck’s sake. This

She eyed them, and then, abruptly, nodded her head at Luna.
It was that he knew they’d just been waiting for an excuse to send him off without officially ‘exiling’ him — because how could the Ministry exile the Boy Who Lived? But as soon as any international issue having remotely to do with water had come up, off he’d been sent. With barely a week’s notice, with no opportunity to decline, no opportunity to even ask for leave from work, no opportunity to settle his personal affairs more thoroughly than going to Gringotts and saying, ‘I guess I just need to withdraw it all.’
After fifteen minutes, Luna began calling them up in the same pairs they hunted in. They would show Harry the items they discovered and hand him a note with their guesses. They were, as expected, all rubbish at guessing.
“Let’s go inside,” he said, shuddering. “Stupidly, I’d feel a lot better with a roof over our heads.”
Harry’s guts twist like dud Christmas crackers that just keep pulling and pulling with no resolution.
Harry swallowed again. “Why’s that?”
there’s a pattern here, but fuck if he can find it.
Harry smirked. “Dunno. Floo your mum? You could try the Tesco for formula. Anyway, love you man—it’s been real, but I gotta go. I’ve a date with Hermione in the morning.”
Everyone cheered. Louder than they’d ever cheered for any of the other six Struggles, louder than they cheered at Quidditch games or races. It was a deafening roar that any nearby Muggles were bound to hear, but no one cared. Harry was screaming himself raw in his excitement. Little sparks of magic kept floating downwards. One landed on Draco’s nose and Harry, lightheaded from the atmospheric magic, leaned forward to kiss it off.
“Dunno, really,” Dudley said. “I changed all the locks on her doors and reinforced her windows and the garage door. Truthfully, I’ve been sleeping in her spare bedroom most nights since Atlantis, just to keep her from losing her mind, and I haven’t seen a thing.”
Shortly after, Quincy Malfoy brought down the first full batch of ready-to-go oysters for the Chesapeake Bay.
had a seat when she was still Director for Magical Creatures.”
After his second margarita and the third time he’d had to bat away a wandering hand beneath the water, Harry swam over to sit next to Hermione, who was, on the whole, a safer bet. She snapped her fingers to dry the water from them, turned a page, and returned her hand to the side of the pool, fingers dangling in the water.
Harry scowled at him and unrolled the vault statement. There was a very small balance, a single credit of one million galleons, and three debits: a 2,000 galleon contract fee for two house-elves who agreed to bind themselves to the Manor for its upkeep, and a single purchase of 512 galleons at the Diagon Alley location of Wittle Wizards, the toys and baby supplies shop that Ron and Hermione were always in these days. Rosie had the full collection of
“Something will come to us,” said Narcissa. “In the meantime, shall I and Misses Patil and Granger begin on the Arithmancy for the ward? Mr Zabini, I believe you took it, too; are you confident in your skills?”
“Draco,” Harry says on a swallow, when the pause becomes too long. “Is there anyth—”
But then Malfoy moved his hips and Harry’s head fell back. He panted, the delicious feeling of Malfoy’s erection against his own sending his blood pounding.
“Gryffindors
“Motherfucker,” Draco whispered, and it was poignant in the silence that followed it, unfilled by a rebuke from his mother.
sorted Slytherin
“Yeah, sounds great,” Harry said, while ignoring the glare Draco was discreetly giving him. “It’s sort of climate change, but more water pollution. It’s killing off your Mers’ habitats.”
Abruptly, the Queen stopped screaming. She and the alien fell still and lifeless on the ground. The fog of magic rushed up, pushing them all back with its force, and Draco started counting in his head, his wand still raised, as they barely managed to maintain the grid.
take this risk because no matter what happened, they couldn’t just let magic die. Even if they all died in the process, magic had to live. So instead, he moved with the Hufflepuffs into the ritual diagram position, a complicated, perfect shape that could not be represented with Muggle geometry.
Boot shrugged good-naturedly. His eyes creased when he smiled, and with his newly Mexico-tanned face, he looked rather rakish, in an overly-happy sort of way. “Ah well. I suppose it’s just you and Harry then. Say, Harry, if you go to that new place—what’s it called?—
Draco grinned crookedly. He slipped his finger beneath the seal on the envelope Harry’d given him, and reached in. There was a sheet of black parchment with animated fireworks. He flipped it open. There was a single, silver-foil ticket inside. Harry heard his startled intake of breath.
“I can get that,” said Draco. “It’s a common potion ingredient in the Mediterranean. I have a supplier there.”
By the time Harry and Draco’s monthly dinner with Andromeda came around on the first Sunday of December, Harry’s crush had gone from a steady, underlying niggle in his brain, to a rushing, sparkling burn all over his body.
, he remembered. Draco knew what he was doing. Draco wasn’t fucking with him. It wasn’t a game. Hufflepuffs didn’t do that. He
Draco curled his lip, cast several thorough cleaning spells over the bed and furniture. The thick fog of dust that had risen up when they entered disappeared, taking Severus’s scent with it.
“Not yours anymore,” Harry said. “In fact, it’s not even your lab. It’s just a manky, old classroom. Miguela’s got your lab, or have you forgotten?”
“I think so,” Hermione said primly. “Padma has the Rover. I’ll ring her.”
, I have to do this before NEWTs or I’ll be stuck tending Father’s business accounts for the rest of my life.” He slammed a hand against the table in frustration. Harry sighed, and turned his burner back off. Definitely didn’t want any repeats of last week.
Scorpius shrugged. “I want to close my eyes so I can absorb it better.”
Narcissa leant backwards, as if slapped.
Nope. No, it wasn’t.
Hermione gave him an odd look, but it was gone before he could decipher it. “I don’t know, Harry.” She glanced at their food, and added, “Wow, your dinner is very
“Et Gobbledegook?” Draco asked, smirking.
The Chieftess nodded slowly. “I am Chieftess Undine McConch. My tribe immigrated here twenty-six years ago, when the waters of the Hebrides died. My mother was Chieftess then, and she led us to prosperity. Now, our waters here are dying. We can’t move again. There are no free waters left to settle. The living coasts are all claimed now.”
“Ah, Potter,” said McGonagall. “I was looking for my apprentice and Severus assured me he wouldn’t be here, so of course this is where I came.”
Never one to waste time, he’d gone straight from Ron and Hermione’s to the Ministry to request travel authorisation from one of the poor sods who pulled a weekend shift. Then he’d gone to one of the other poor sods, flashed his Auror-in-Charge look, and silently demanded the records on file for Draco Malfoy and Druella Rosier Black.
The man at the head of the table, still standing and looking unfortunately overrun by his own ICW-issue robes, gave them an overdone smile.
Malfoy smirked at him. He was taking an unnecessarily long time slicking up his own cock. Harry could see pre-come leaking from the bright pink head and suddenly remembered having that delicious cock shoved down his throat, swallowing all the come from it.
But he knew they couldn’t. Hufflepuffs did not leave things like that to chance.
He just wanted Malfoy.
“You could,” Snape agreed, unperturbed. “Or you could attempt to assure me I chose a worthy apprentice by making the connection between your inter-subject project and the assignments I’ve set you this past month.”
Malfoy gasps a little laugh, and his wanking speeds up. Harry watches the little white speckles painted on his chest shimmer with every muscle contraction as he jerks his cock. “Coming on your mouth,” says Malfoy, ever the fucking shameless aristocrat.
“What!” he whispered. His face heated up and he tried to hide it in the voluminous collar of his black apprentice robes.

performed.
“What?” Harry croaked.
“The point is,” Millicent added, “it’s safer for you to go make a spectacle of yourself than it is to go somewhere they can snatch you up and we’d never hear from you again. And everyone knows your name now—I showed my alien to the reporters and said they’d taken you. People will want to know if you’ve come back.”
“I rather liked it,” Malfoy gasped. Harry thrust his hips forward in reply and Malfoy arched his neck back to give Harry better access. “The sun, the sand, the food.”
with an angry flick of his wrist. Malfoy watched the movement, his eyes widening fractionally, but then the sneer returned.
the stone to remove any surface impurities and set it inside his cauldron for safekeeping. “Professor?” he called.
Harry understood that passage now—Potions were a bit like him and Malfoy: Volatile ones needed a volatile base. Fortifying ones needed a fortified base. Life-giving ones needed a life-giving base. Cinnabar, Aqua Fortis, Aqua Vitae. Malfoy was probably all those things to Harry.
“We weren’t trying to get babies,” Draco interjected quickly.
And yet when he opened his mouth again, it didn’t take a Seer to guess who he picked. In the end, even when Harry hated him, he could never let Malfoy go.
Malfoy steps back from the door and Harry takes the invitation for what it is, stepping into the flat and looking around with ill-disguised curiosity.
Despite this, Draco’s head was slowly falling against Harry’s.
Maybe if Demelza had been his partner the whole time, if he’d never had Draco, he’d be perfectly happy blowing things up with her.
BBC’s homepage had suggested Atlantis wasn’t an island, but a UFO that had landed in the Atlantic and anchored. Queen Sostrate had indeed met with leaders from around the world, and a secret summit convened afterwards, though to what aim no civilian reporter seemed to know. And then came the abductions—something Harry had not even been aware of until he read the investigative report on BBC today. And then came the sighting in London. And then the truce had, apparently, disintegrated and militaries convened on Atlantis.
She eyed him distrustfully. “Yes, I suppose you are. Oddly.” They fell into step and she took the shortcut through the dingy service passage that came out near Professor Snape’s old office.
“Yeah.” That was pretty much the sum of it. Because his boggart was himself. Right now. Like looking in a normal mirror.
Malfoy harrumphed. “Not bad? Please. You loved it.”
Rosie flushed deeper and said to Harry, “Uncle Harry, have you got a wine key?” She saw Teddy then, and somehow managed to grow a shade even redder. “Teddy.”
The reporter looked chastened, but continued, “It could easily be someone dressed up in a very good costume. Movie effects are quite good these days.”
“It does have a nice porch,” Hermione observed, tucking an errant curl behind her ear. There was even a porch swing. And there were three decorative tin stars tacked to the wall, all in a row. It was homey.
“I know,” Harry said easily. “But you’re incredibly prickly. And hard to read when you want to be. And we were both so eaten up with guilt over Teddy that neither of us were thinking clearly. Could we… maybe start again?” he asked hesitantly.
“Afraid not, kiddo,” Harry said. “It would be rude for me to take you without an invitation. But, hey, maybe we can stop by Gringotts later today instead of calling. I need to put a few things in my vault.”
Sources for Ravenclaws:
“And your cloak!” Draco continued on a whisper. “I had to refresh your warming charm six times this Wednesday. How did you survive the Dark Lord? You’re absolutely helpless.”
“Think so,” said Draco, but he didn’t look convinced. “Pass me that book.”
“I’m sorry about the ratings,” Harry said to her when she came into his hotel room in the Castro District to brief him on their activities in the city.
“I don’t fucking know,” Harry says. “I don’t even know where Beirut fucking is.”
be squibs.
again.
Harry leant, briefly, against Malfoy’s shoulder, gave him a little smile. It wasn’t going too badly. They’d done it. They’d seriously, actually, completely destroyed the Statute of Secrecy, and it was fine. Muggles didn’t—immediately—hate magical people, which meant they had a chance to save themselves. They had a chance to fully come out of hiding and intermingle with non-magical people, become one people.
There was a row of vaguely lion-shaped statues. Bored, Harry sat down by one of them and watched as the contenders rushed off looking for clues. They were divided into teams of two and had to follow clues to collect items that—allegedly—gave insight into Harry’s deepest desires.
Harry downed it, scrunching his nose a bit at the hot sensation. “All right. Water in, flame on…” He looked beneath his cauldron to make sure this burner wasn’t emotional on Sundays. It wasn’t.
“We don’t have long before the Muggles figure out where the outage occurred,” Justin said, raising his voice over the sizzling and sparking of the power line. “We need to work fast!”
“I could latch on to several things,” Harry said, leaning forward. “But right now, I’m thinking of that time, last year. We were in your office—”
“It worked?” asked another witch.
the wrong emotion to be feeling right now.
He hopped up from his seat, paced back and forth. “This is so perfect—so obvious! Why didn’t I think of it before? Don’t you have a house-elf here? Can you call him?”
There was a pause. All Harry could do was listen to the sound of Dudley’s breathing, reassure himself he was
“Wonder why Shacklebolt even bothers telling everyone,” Ron said over his butterbeer. “Why not let them go on with their lives without being scared?”
Hermione, with one last pointed look at Harry, exited the room.
Draco ignored her.
Once installed in his rooms again, Harry realised with great despair the degree to which he’d fucked up. They somehow all ended up in the same positions they’d sat in last night, and he couldn’t even look in the direction of his grey armchair without picturing Draco’s exposed neck and hearing him reveal a secret fantasy—a secret fantasy that had kept Harry up all night in his bed, imagining himself in place of the mysterious man Draco wanked over.
sounds, not even breathing ones, and he doesn’t know why, but it doesn’t seem like the sort of issue a Muggle would have—surely even Muggles without voices could make Ms and Rs?—so he’s starting to suspect that this is the result of a curse scar on his vocal chords. And Harry knows all a-fucking-bout curse scars. Who the fuck let Reynolds through healing training?
“Which brings us right round to the crux,” Harry said. He turned to Ginny. “I want you and Al and Luna to move into Hogwarts full time. Or if you don’t want that, then Grimmauld with a Secret.”
At this point, Draco seemed to reconcile himself to learning the entire history of each Nation of Mers, and focused on eating his curry. Harry could only think about how bad that water must be if the oil in it was turning the young Mers a different colour.
“Totally,” said Dudley. “Disappeared right before everyone’s eyes as soon as the spell completed. It’s been all over the news.”
“That’s what Hermione ended up doing, since the goblins told her you’d put a freeze on deposits to your account. She was pissed off about that, by the way.”
Much like Potter’s pointed looks throughout every sodding meeting, the sodding guard portrait made no secret of wanting him gone. He wouldn’t give either of them the pleasure. He had people on his side: Pansy, Millicent, Theo, Pucey, the Headmistress. Even Potter’s cousin. Draco smiled; making friends with Potter’s Muggle cousin and knowing it annoyed Potter had been a special pleasure for Draco.
Snape’s eyes widened. “Absolutely not.”
“Harry,” Minerva said. He looked up. “We need an Ancient Cultures and Casting instructor to round out the new history curriculum and stay competitive with Beauxbatons—and which, I may remind you, you voted in favour of—and he’s the
“Yes, I am,” said Draco, stiffly. He held his hand out, though it looked as if it pained him to do so. “Very pleased to meet you.” It was the most he’d spoken altogether in three days.
“Ravenclaw,” she said, to Luna. “I have a good feeling about you. You can try first. Come here.” Luna stepped forward, and Ashwood continued, to the group, “There is no password for entering Hufflepuff. The entrance is the second barrel from the bottom in the middle row. You only need tap it in the rhythm of our founder’s name.
She replied after a long moment. “I know. Goodnight.”
—seen Draco look unkempt. He steps back, reflexively, his hands coming up to guard his own stomach, not from Draco, but from the primal fear that he could be sick.
“Weren’t we?” Harry asked. “Like, a lifelong one?”
Draco stared off into the crowd, gaping and blinking. Harry withheld a ridiculous laugh; he’d never seen Draco so stunned before.
Draco stood, dusted his trousers off and grabbed up his book bag. “Thanks, Potter. I think this’ll do for our lessons. See you around.”
, and
Harry took a few steps forward, unsure what to say. Merlin, they were all trying so hard not to lose their minds over this thing, not to completely break down with fear. But they could still
She was forthcoming in responses, surprisingly well-versed in magical theory and spell-crafting, but Draco supposed she would be. She had helped develop the spell they would use to save themselves. The last spell she had ever cast.
“Fuck, that’s a lot. Well, um, math…”  He searched around and found a spare notebook and biro. “Okay, so it would take one oyster 750,000,000 days to clean the Chesapeake Bay, which I’m guessing is too long. So to clean it up in, say, a month, we’d need… 25,000,000 oysters.”
. Of course there are potions that use Merpeople. But only
Then he remembered Ron had taken a two-month assignment in the Outer Hebrides and wouldn’t be back until Christmas. He was always taking long assignments. As he was thinking this, his self-evaluation survey popped into his inbox. Harry scowled, snatched it up, and ticked ‘Outstanding’ for every question, then popped it into his outbox. It disappeared a moment later.
“Did you ever finish reading this article?” Harry asked.
Harry groaned. God, was it too much to ask not to have to listen to Boot being so annoyingly chipper on an otherwise pleasant Sunday evening? He lifted his eyes to the ceiling. “Please, Merlin, if there was a Merlin, don’t let Malfoy win the fucking league.”
Harry lowered his binoculars to look at Malfoy. He wanted to take a risk. “I think…” Harry said slowly, “that you and I have something in common, if only we could find it.”
“For muggles, maybe. Believe me. Don’t watch it.”
Hermione made another small, unidentifiable sound; looked as though she might fall off the edge. Harry steadied her waist. He was feeling as though he could make unidentifiable sounds, too. It was just that, he could so easily see himself saying those things to Malfoy, and who would have ever guessed that
“I did not!” she said.
Harry turned to him, gaping. “What’s she talking about?”
“Oh, Mill!” Hermione rushed her, but unlike Harry, Millicent barely swayed from the impact of Hermione’s arms going round her neck. She fairly dragged the other woman from the room, as much as anyone of Hermione’s skinny stature could drag Millicent Bulstrode.
: (n) an unwillingness to come to terms with truth or facts.]
“True, yeah,” said Kyle. “But the difference here is, we’ve got so many people spread so far out that we can never come to an agreement on anything. MACUSA’s been thinking of dividing itself up among the MUS… it’s just too big to govern, with too many regions wanting different things. I wish the US would do the same, to be honest. They’d all be happier if they were five or six different countries instead of one, but try telling them that.”
“Of course he will, darling,” said Hermione. “He knows better than to not.”
He wasn’t much of a social butterfly, so it was a good thing that all the contestants were desperate for his attention and that Hermione was willing to bring over pre-screened ones as well. By the end of the night, Harry found that he’d almost enjoyed himself. He was a bit fuzzy around the edges when Luna told him it was time to choose the fifteen who would be staying on.
Harry gasped. She knew he was watching.
,” Malfoy said. “I’ve always done.” His fingers toyed at the belt keeping Harry’s dressing gown closed. At once, he tugged on the belt and the bow came undone. The fabric fell aside and Harry’s eyelids lowered. He was mercilessly hard and his brain was screaming at him to punch Malfoy in the face and kick him out, but there was an aching feeling in his chest that seemed to be overruling everything else.
“Um,” said Harry. “I quite like Ruby,” he said. “He’s, um, very manly.”
“You know what I’m talking about,” Harry said.
Malfoy groans. Harry manages a breathless smile as he works in a second finger. Suddenly, he’s flipped onto his back and Malfoy’s grasping his hand, scooping up all the slick oil there and coating his own fingers. He wastes no time pressing two into Harry.
“I’ve learned a few,” he said. “This one always seemed like a good one to know. You know, so they don’t see the wand coming and take off.”
Finally, Snape looked interested. “Isn’t it, Minerva?” he said. “Properly brewed potions don’t just fail, and as much as it pains me to say this, Potter’s Polyjuice was—perfect.”
“Just don’t fuck this up,” Dawlish said, passing them the case file. “The victim’s the Minister’s step-daughter.”
Hermione sat back, thoughtful. “Okay, that’s a start... I’m quite good at negotiating, haggling, and persuading,” she said. “And I love reading Andromeda’s blog, so I’ve been exposed to creativity. We could start a home redecorating business.”
“I’m glad, though,” Bill interrupted. He smiled. “It’s good to have you.”
Harry crawled up his body, and wondered if this was reminding Draco of his fantasy like it was Harry. He bent to kiss him again, letting his tongue slide against Draco’s swollen lips and dip into his mouth. Draco’s hand ran down his side, curved around his bottom, and dragged his body closer. Their cocks brushed, and Harry gasped, and then moaned when Draco’s slick fingers moved to wrap around it.
“Here are your information packets, including the requirements of your apprenticeship, standards for publication of your final project, and rules and other miscellanea you will find useful during your tenure here.”
“I’ll go see what Ms Sephora’s doing.” The door shut quickly.
this. If we could, someone would’ve done it already.”
“Which is?” Peterson prompted, annoyed.
Across the room, Ginny shuddered, and even Luna looked uneasy. They were finally starting to take it seriously.
“Tell me,” Snape bit out, “you imbeciles did not bind my already damned soul to yet another portrait in Hogwarts. Was it not enough that I already hang in Minerva’s office like a fucking boy band poster?” His black eyes flicked around the room and he grimaced. “God, it’s the fucking
. It meant cosiness and people you liked or something. Harry felt like it applied here.
“That’s it,” Potter agreed.
“Queen Sostrate offered her very life to protect us all, Severus Snape gave up the peace of an afterlife, and these four brave witches and wizards—and yes I say that on purpose, for despite their losses, they are still witches and wizards—gave their magic so we could live. In an ironic turn of fate, the magic taken from them was given to many of you.
Draco cracked an eye open and glanced down at the mess on his body, which would only become slicker and more annoying once it made contact with water. Ejaculate was such an annoying substance. His mind took that moment to helpfully remind him of what he’d just wanked to, and how he wouldn’t be adverse at all to Potter’s ejaculate. Draco grimaced, wholly disappointed in himself, but self-aware enough not to be surprised.
“And that’s another thing,” Malfoy said. “Seabiscuit.”
“If they’re desperate, they’ll just get worse,” Padma added, reasonably.
“Thank you, everyone, for coming.”
“No, there’s a New York branch,” Harry said. “Not a Mid-Atlantic branch, or a Seattle branch, or fuck it, even a Dallas, Texas branch.”
. He answered while still glaring at Harry. Harry put on as innocent a face as possible, modeled entirely after the face Teddy pulled when he’d been up to his worst shit-stirring.
, and I’ve got to fucking fix it first, so if it’s okay with you, get the fuck out so I can sort this.”
Draco opened his mouth to reply, and then hesitated. “It’s amenable to change,” he said carefully, instead. “Gneiss wasn’t one of the stone types McGonagall set for me to transfigure...I did it on a whim, after we found that one. But, yeah, it’s metamorphic, and I didn’t expect it to take a change at all, much less a change to quartz, when it only had a very little bit to begin with.”
Snape looked far too intrigued for Harry’s liking. It was times like these he wished he were dead and carefree, too. Snape studied Harry as if he were looking for remains of the blood he could sample.
“No, thanks, Kreacher,” Harry said, giving him a smile. “This is great. Go finish your game.”
Draco snorted. “You can’t be serious.” But the way he said it, the tone of his voice suggested it was less statement than question. “Potter, we already—”
She narrowed her eyes, but did resume her seat in the tartan armchair. The tartan armchair that most certainly had once been Harry’s favourite stool. “I’m always available to students, Potter. It is my job as Headmistress.”
Harry thought sourly.
“I wait only for your permission to share it, Your Majesty,” he said.
Ron nodded. “Hermione’s at Mum’s telling her it’s finalised now. Thought it best if we visited her separate, so she’d be able to ask us questions individually and not worry about the awkwardness of honesty.”
“It’s mind over magic,” Draco said. “You have to command your magic to come home. You people can do that right?”
, Harry says. He can’t look away from Draco on the hospital bed.
Harry rather thought that was an astronomically bigger promise than they could uphold, but he nodded just the same. He’d seen the elder Malfoys with the same looks on their faces once before. They’d been searching for Draco in a broken castle then. Now, Harry had Albus. He knew exactly how they felt.
“Merlin, redeem me,” Draco muttered.
“No shit, Nott,” Draco said, but he was smiling.
“Tea, yes, definitely,” said Padma, tapping their table with her wand to call the waitress.
They turned towards the Great Hall, but instead of going up the steps, Alick Macmillan tickled the pear in the still-life outside the kitchens. Harry was near the front, with Neville, Draco, and a group of seventh year new-Hufflepuffs, including the Head Girl, former Slytherin Imani Ahmad, who was already fast friends with Luna, and Ginny’s old roommate, Fayth Walliams. He could hear the house-elves working as the door swung inwards, but as soon as Alick stepped inside, the sound stopped. He followed them in, and the house-elves paused, watching them trail through.
They trundled down the stairs, both skipping the trick stair out of hard-learned habit. Harry wasn't sure where they were heading, but he wasn’t in a hurry to get back. He liked the change of pace from always having something that needed his attention. Hermione wasn’t un-tensing though, so he supposed he was going to have to broach the forbidden subject, if only to get it out of the way. “Was that an owl from Ron I saw waiting when we got in?”
Harry couldn’t stand the sound of his name coming from Malfoy’s mouth. Not after this. He shook his head furiously and dove for the en suite, slamming the door behind him. Malfoy banged on the door, calling his name, but Harry threw up a Silencing charm. He stared at his reflection in the mirror, seeing his bloodless skin and the dried tear tracks from his orgasm, and, if he looked hard enough, Harry thought he could see inside himself, to that piece of him that’d wanted so hard to trust Malfoy enough to let him be the one.
Today, flying along over the Atlantic in a loud Muggle machine, Draco remembered those weeks of dreams, and honestly wished the Dark Lord were alive right now to give him an awkward, confusing hug.
safe.
“I lost!” declared Terry. “But Merlin did I have a good time!”
if he doesn’t rename that cat,” Snape said. “I will not suffer this.”
“It affected Petunia?” Severus asked. “You didn’t even add variables into the spell to ignore people who rightly knew of magic already? Are you all truly as stupid as you were in my Potions class?”
“We should both quit,” Harry decided glumly. Their waitress came over with his pie, and Hermione ordered a second piece of banoffee and two more coffees for them.
more than your boggart.”
He thought maybe it was the way that Malfoy always seemed to be there, always seemed to be next to him, his body warm and solid and as if it were connected to Harry on some fundamental, basic level that Harry’d never experienced with anyone else before. It was sort of amazing, really. It reminded him of how Ron and Hermione always seemed to be glued together, how they seemed to be able to read one another’s minds and just know what the other was thinking, how their magic seemed so compatible and how amazed Harry always was when Ron would pick up Hermione’s wand to summon a fresh nappy for Rosie and it would work just fine.
Harry managed to get his cup in the right spot after a terrifying moment of coffee pouring onto the countertops—there were no tea pods—and joined Hermione with a half cup of coffee as black and tarry as Voldemort’s soul. Just how he liked it, if he couldn’t have tea.
“And you!” Pomfrey said, turning on the man now occupying the watercolour seascape behind Harry’s bed. He’d never seen the professor look quite so
At this, she grinned at him. “But as it’s a vintage, I wasn’t able to find it in the colour I wanted. I would like it red.”
"Fine, fine,” said Anthony. He was laying on top of Justin, who had elected not to make the trek back to Ravenclaw Tower. Harry didn’t blame him. Ernie Macmillan and Eloise were also in attendance, though the other old Hufflepuffs were gone, either to breakfast or their own dorms. Eventually, the rest of them were standing, books in hand, if not exactly awake and ready to face the day.
“I was just thinking that that had to be the result of them using, like, really ancient magic. We’d be able to do something different now, right? If, say, we got Atlantis to do the spell again, they could hide without not existing?”
Harry didn’t need to be told twice.
They got him sorted with a new account, which took far less paperwork than the cargo, although he did have to fill in several forms for the IRS, whatever that was. Another self-important governmental agency without enough oversight, Harry assumed.
Malfoy looked stunned for several, eternal seconds. “What do you mean?”
He levered himself up, grimacing at the feel of sticky come, rapidly cooling in the air as he peeled them apart. A quick
Harry complies. He can feel himself rapidly nearing his climax and he hopes to god that Draco is close, too. He reaches down and grabs Draco’s shaft, pumping him in time with his thrusts. Draco tenses all around him.
Draco attempted to gather himself. This was it. This was the last time he’d ever cast an ancient spell. The last time he’d ever be part of magic like this. It was—he found he was at peace. Because Scorpius was safe with the Weasleys and Potter’s ridiculous mutt, and Draco was here with Potter…It felt like this was how it was always meant to end. With him saving his family and Potter right there with him at the end.
Harry’s heart soars until Proulx says,
At dinner on Tuesday , Delta Ashwood leaned over Harry’s shoulder and said, “Meeting tonight. Common room, 10pm. Wear your good cloak and don’t be late.”
intuitive. I’d wondered.” Seemingly realising he’d sort of complimented Harry, he concluded: “At least you have that going for you.”
, today, and I am a vindicated man. I am ready to die now. When I reach Hell, and I meet your father there, I will greet him, and I will say, ‘Potter, I taught everything I knew to your son, little Potter, and he nearly became a Potions Master. But your genes won out, stubborn as they were, and he’s dead now. He
“Full marks for the article,” Orkney continued. “Excellent example of magical community security concerns.”
“Bugger, that’s not enough time to see the gallery. D’you want to get something to eat from one of the food trucks?”
But here they were large. Here they covered the earth, and it made the earth better.
“No, I can’t,” Draco hissed. “Because I’d be vomiting everywhere and that would contaminate the potion!”
Hermione gave Harry a curious look at the word ‘blackmailed’, but he refused to meet her eye, focusing instead on his coffee, which had a strange plastic aftertaste. She’d come too close to the truth with her joke the other week.
Hermione chewed her lip a bit. “Well. I’d quite like to pair Arithmancy and magical Renaissance art.”
Probably with Hermione.
Draco blinked, stunned. Potter had sat back abruptly, as if trying to literally escape such a truth.
“Hi, Daddy!”
He should tell Draco he loves him. Harry knows better than anyone how quickly lives can alter course or even end. It’s why he’s not an Auror anymore. Aurors hit with a spell that makes them an emotional mess whenever they try to use an offensive spell aren’t suitable for fieldwork, after all. He’s grateful that the Department wanted to take him in afterwards— a bored Harry Potter is a dangerous Harry Potter— but he misses the time with Ron, and he misses the feeling of usefulness he got from being an Auror.
Narcissa’s eyes widened further, then narrowed. She took a step closer to the alien, pressed her wand tip into its throat.
Hermione smiled, but she looked confused. “Is he well?”
“If it helps, I could get rid of him for you.”
In his dream, he relived the horrifying final moments of the day of the final battle, when the Dark Lord had hit Potter with yet another Killing Curse, and Potter was dead, or briefly dead, or faking dead entirely—Narcissa had never been sure. Hagrid held Potter in his arms, fat tears probably drowning the boy if he weren’t in fact already dead, and the Dark Lord was speaking at length.
“Standing on what?”
“Hello?” Granger called, as they stepped over the broken window panes, crunching into the Queen’s once-beautiful tapestry rug. “Is anyone here?”
But of all these confusing things, the most confusing of all was that Harry sort of
“Yep!” Ginny said right away. “We were just talking about our favourite Halloween breakfasts. Want to come get some grub with Mummy?”
Well. Hermione was a saint, but Harry wasn’t sure that this wasn’t pushing it a bit far. “You’d better ask,” he said.
“You’re odd,” Harry says absently, and the Healer seems to agree. He twirls his wand and the hologram spins, and then, wow, fuck, there are two heads. Fortunately on two separate bodies. Then, “Have you really never seen one before?”
Blaise looked as though he’d vomit. He was wiping at his arms as if he could get off more of the bay water from his skin.
Malfoy snorted. “You’re ridiculous.”
“I’ve really no compunctions about sweaty, manly men,” said Harry. He paused. “And anyway, there were women there, too.”
“Yeah, I like the pointy one,” Lee agreed. He looked up again. “Why are we talking about this?”
No one had an answer at first.
façade, he came round to stare at the grey kitten, now somewhat larger, in the pen by the window.
“Shall we take a moment to eat something before we bring the whole thing up?” asked Padma.
Draco made a small noise, low in his throat. He pulled away from Potter, fumbled for the Portkey. “We’ll figure it out,” he allowed. “Are you ready? Should we get this over with?”
Malfoy looked surprised for the briefest of moments, then it cleared from his face and he reached across the table to pour himself a cup of coffee and take a scone—he chose a chocolate pistachio one, which was very unconventional, Harry couldn’t help noticing.
to the IMDb page for the 1986 sci-fi film. Harry was careful not to click on that one, for fear of the nightmares he’d have the rest of the week.
“There you are! Sorry I’m late!” Hermione called, rushing up from behind them. They clamped up. She would be supremely disapproving if she heard about Mrs Norris.
Severus merely shrugged. “Death is boring.”
, except in a shared history. “Let’s start with the riesling.”
Harry followed his line of sight and felt his whole body freeze. That strange sort of terror you got in nightmares, when you knew you should run, fight—
Reluctantly, he said: “Average.”
People around the table curled their lips. Longbottom looked furious; Luna horrified.
painting in Potter’s rooms, of all undignified landscapes in the whole fucking castle. Draco, I am deeply disappointed in you. At least as disappointed as I was during your sixth year and no less disappointed than I was in every single class I had Potter in. God and Merlin, why have you fucking forsaken me—?”
Grimaces settled on all the faces around the table. Even Hermione looked uncomfortable.
“What am I going to do with a cat?”
Potter eyed him, but let the subject drop.
said the theme was ‘Volcanoes’. Not ‘Ms Pollen’s special’.
“He’s getting weird,” Harry said. “The more I think about it, the more baffled I am that he could’ve felt threatened by me enough to threaten to fire my friends and their families just to prove a point. I mean, I hadn’t even been in the paper in months.”
The bank was full of artificial light and bored tellers reading Muggle gossip magazines. The first one looked so relieved to finally have a customer that Harry almost smiled.
Draco scowled at him, his expression so fierce that Harry would’ve cowered if it didn’t make him laugh anymore. “I will not submit myself to be
“So you’d rather I’d just not’ve sucked you off, is that it? Would you’ve rather I didn’t come onto you at all? Then we’d still just be Auror partners and—”
“Hello, Kyle,” Draco said in a voice just one degree warmer than permafrost. “Fancy seeing you here, just three hours after I last saw you.”
“I’m not doing another interview,” Petunia called, peeking through.
He shrugs. “Dunno,” he says. “Thought it’d be a nice change of pace.”
The crowd was utterly silent, all eyes glued on the two people before them. Theo spoke some final words and there was a rush of magic shooting up from the ground behind him. It surged into the air and froze, curving over him like a wave ready to break. The light stayed there and Padma started speaking, her eyes flicking up to the silver-gold-green-blue magic framing Theo, and then back to his face.
Harry nodded. The two Healers pulled him into the Floo, and then they were away.
“Weasley was stubborn enough to stay in Gryffindor,” Draco reminded him.
“Okay,” said Hermione. “I’m sure it’s fine. Thank you so much, Harry! I’ll pick her up this evening from yours, and then we’ll be by Sunday night for dinner with Andromeda.”
“We met with Chieftess Delora and her sister, Vice-Chieftess Aegea. They were the oldest Mers we’ve met. Delora must’ve been in her three hundreds and Aegea not far behind,” said Hermione. “Anyway, they’ve got a huge problem with algal blooms up there. Entire lakes are basically dead for large parts of the year. Plus, the water’s full of microbeads—it’s these tiny little plastic exfoliating beads that come in Muggle face and body wash. They don’t degrade, and then they get in the lake and the fish eat them and the Mers swallow them, and so on. The beads have actually been showing up in the flesh of fish caught and sold for consumption.”
The Celestina Warbeck started up then. Harry and Draco shared a mutual grimace.
The scuffling came closer, followed by a harassed meow and just for the hell of it, Harry lifted an eyebrow at her, questioning. She nodded and they took off running as if Mrs Norris could actually get them in trouble these days.
Harry stops short. “Oh.”
. Nothing special.”
Maybe
Harry shook his head; somehow the entire thing felt like a dream. He wasn’t even sure it was happening. Try
He jabbed the burner with his wand and directed a strongly-worded thought at it; there weren’t particular spells for this sort of thing, only annoyance and magical power. Finally, it settled down into a stable, low burn, although not without resentment.
and Harry hugged Draco tight.
good. The most amazing moment of your entire life, you say?”
Harry tossed his half-eaten toast back on the plate and stood. Malfoy ignored him. Then Harry changed his mind and grabbed the toast again. Ms Danger would eat it—and if she smelt it on his hands and he didn’t come back with any for her, he’d never get anything done today.
Coddler smiled. “I’ll be right back then with some options.”
“No fucking way am I putting a toe in that water,” he said. “It’s disgusting.”
The translators went to work, and suddenly, one in the back called, “Ms Liu Ping, from
Still a twat.
The second best bed was facing the Forbidden Forest and part of the pitch and was, of course, Harry’s. It was also next to Malfoy’s. Sometimes one had to weigh one’s priorities very carefully.
Hermione looked pained. “Well, that’s the other thing, Harry,” she said. “Ninety percent of our regional magic wouldn’t mean that our wards and such are only ninety percent effective. That part
it would be.”
Sometime during the evening, Draco swallows his pride and puts on the glasses. Harry doesn’t comment on it. He likes it too much to risk their removal. It’s hot this time of year, Draco’s got his shirt off again, and the way his spine bends as he leans over to read the black file in his hand makes Harry burn. He doesn’t comment on that, either.
“Ah, yes. We perhaps should do that rather soon, shouldn’t we? I’ll gather people around, you go stand near the presents.” Harry mock saluted and began to turn us around and tread us towards the covered table. I detached from Harry’s arm and sat off to the side of the presents table enough to where I could still see Harry perfectly, but wouldn’t be directly in his line of sight. Soon enough people were gathered around to watch Harry receive his first present from Severus.
“Draco,” Lucius started, “why are you so against this? I don't see what is so wrong with marrying a beautiful girl, producing an heir, and becoming the head of the Malfoy family. I did it, your grandfather did it, we all did; it’s what is expected of us as a Malfoy, Draco. Think of the even greater wealth and prosperity it will bring to the Malfoy name and family!” And that's just the thing. I wouldn't mind settling down and starting a family. I just don't want to be married off to a stranger, or well a girl, for social and wealth status and an heir.
The fairy smiled shyly at mother’s compliment and waved at me, “I’m Laima.” Her skin was a beautiful, rich, dark color and she had a wild but kept frame of black, tight ringlets that reached her mid-back and a scatter of freckles on the bridge of her nose and tops of her cheeks. Her eyes were a bright hazel, and almond-shaped, framed by thick lashes. Her plump lips were positioned in a smile, a simple dimple appearing on her left cheek.
“Actually I wasn’t on pot to start with so I can’t really be off it,” Harry voiced through a smile and ended with a laugh.
“Yeah,” I replied casually, “of course they will.”
Curled up into bed for the night I think about owling Harry tomorrow and seeing if he’d like to come over for a while, even if it is to discuss what needs to be determined. I decide that I’ll do it after lunch tomorrow that way it ensures Harry will be awake before I send the owl
“I’d love some, thank you.” Mother gave me a glance and I shook head no.
) rose just enough to be excused from at least one class period.
“It’s, or I suppose, she is a Mexican Black Kingsnake.” I was filled with pride knowing that Harry liked both of my presents and couldn’t wait to hear Harry speak more parseltongue as I’ve always been fascinated by Harry’s ability.
“Oh, shut up Malfoy,” Ron was blushing heavily.
So now that two out of seven items have been completed, I’m left again in a state of undue boredom and I contemplate going back to my yoga, but I find that I’d much rather not. It’s late into the evening and I figure too late to invite Harry over or to go over there. I sit slouched on my bed for a few minutes before finally deciding to take a shower. Gathering up my clothes I head to my attached bathroom and proceed to follow my usual routine.
Screw when you accidentally set the white peacocks loose in the house and mother threw the biggest fit because her “precious antique vases and dishes that were old enough to be her great-great-great-great (and many more greats because honestly, mother was a bit over-dramatic) grandmother” could’ve been broken, and it was partially “all Lucius’ fault because he’s the one who wanted those god awful flightless birds in the first place”.
“Yes, laugh it up until you’re facing life in my dungeons,” I remarked.
“Draco, do please try and at least seem interested,” father said with a sigh. His left hand came up to rub at the bridge of his nose.
“Wha–! Harry! This is what you're worried about?” Harry let out a boisterous laugh. “How are you not worried? Or scared? Or mad even? I told my father, MY FATHER, that we are a couple!” Harry's laughing only increases and he pulls his hands away to clap them together, body bending from his laughter. His laughter dies down and Harry moves to sit up, a faint smile settling on his flushed face.
. My hair currently fell past my eyes, framing my face softly. The sides had grown out a bit but were nothing compared to the top of my hair, which was the concern. I’ve tried encouraging Harry to get his hair cut similarly to mine, longer on top, shorter on the sides, but he worries it will look weird with his 3a hair type. I, for one, think it’ll look better on him than it does on me. He’s already bloody gorgeous but with that hairstyle, it's like adding the cherry on top, or finding out that in your pack of 10 chocolates, they added another by accident. Simply delicious.
say. He’s been talking forever about loosening me out of my overly formal way of being, and he has made slight progress considering you don’t hang around someone for Merlin knows how many years and not pick something up from them. But I suppose that when you’re taught at an early age how to speak and behave in a certain way it doesn’t wear off easily.
“Too soon?”
“Alright, I’ll be around then,” I brought my hand up to his shoulder before letting it slip off as I made my way back outside. Reaching back to where everyone had mostly gathered, I ran into Hermione and Ron.
“I won’t deny that I thought your dad was going to roast
“From the Weasleys.” It was a decently sized box and when Harry opened it up a smile light up his face.
“Well father,” I began, “it's been how long since yule?” Lucius stared at me for a second before knocking back a gulp of the rest of the scotch and sighing to himself. We sat in silence forever and my nerves were starting to fray. I wanted to know what he was thinking. I wanted to know if he was disappointed in me, or furious. If he planned to disown me or embrace me in a hug of- well maybe not a hug- but give me a firm handshake, while one hand rested on my shoulder with a smile on his face as he told me he’d be happy with whatever I wanted because- my internal monologue was quickly cut off by my father's voice.
I caught glimpses of Harry as my eyes darted around; too afraid to maintain eye contact with him. He sat with his eyebrows furrowed and his eyes filled with worry. He reached out and grabbed my hands that were fidgeting with each other and began to gently play with them, rubbing delicate caresses on my cold and shaky fingers and palms.
(See the end of the chapter for
“None taken.”
“I have a favor to ask of you. Now I understand if you do not wish to go along with it, but please hear me out at least?” I ask pleadingly. Feelings of overwhelming nausea and dizziness are at large now and suddenly I feel regretful of ever even being born.
“Your parents took it quite well,” Harry said at last.
rowdy. Dobby nodded his head excitedly.
I raised an eyebrow before speaking, “drinking is not going to fix your problems father.” He turned back towards me and walked with his drink in hand.
“Really Ron? It’s Headmistress McGonagall; have some respect. And you know you shouldn’t be encouraging bad behavior in the lower years!” Hermione exclaimed. Seeing Hermione scold Ron seemed like the perfect opportunity to do the same.
“He’s inside, he wanted to put the finishing touches on the cupcakes himself. Said there was more love in it that way,” Severus rolled his eyes but his voice was fond and full of love and warmth.  My heart swelled thinking of the treacle tart I made for Harry and the similar line of thinking we had.
Harry stumbled over his words before speaking with a look of disbelief on his face, “what? I mean honestly, what? You’re evil, Draco. An evil git.”
“Treacle tart, you’re favorite and made only for you.” Harry hummed in delight.
“That was not funny. I can’t believe you genuinely just said that. Are you sure you’re not high now?” I was still laughing, his comments fueling me to continue.
Harry’s eyes were certainly wet at this point and he tried playing it off by laughing at mother’s attempt at a joke (but it was honestly not really a joke if you truly knew mother and Severus, and I wonder if Harry knew that.) Harry turned to me gave an amused laugh. “I guess when I said that this day has gone quire opposite of how I thought it would it gave fate an open invitation to try and fit as much weird shi-” Harry’s eyes widened as he remembered that my mother still sat with us and he quickly redirected what he was about it say, “things, as much weird things as possible in one day.” I wore a large grin filled with mirth all the while mother wore a confused expression but I ignored it, certainly not wanting to get into anything that’s occurred today. At least until I can no longer put it off. Mother stood and shook out her hands, before turning to us.
before sighing dramatically.
Harry and I walked towards a gathering of tables sat by the food that was laid out for the guests when we noticed my parents and assumed Severus was going to be there. Walking up to the table our parents noticed us and their conversation died down.
“I’m not serious, I’m Draco.” Harry deadpanned.
He moved onto the next box, and when he opened it his mouth dropped. Suddenly he was hissing and I felt relief flood through me as a smile blossomed over his face through his conversing with the snake. He slowly brought out the small black snake and there were “oohs” and “ahhs” from the crowd. “She’s absolutely gorgeous Draco,” Harry said with excitement. I only smiled in response.
“Right, well, uh,” I try to take a deep breath, but it's as though my lungs have shrunk and suddenly I feel like a fool. My body feels clammy and shaky, doused in a cold flush, yet my face feels as if I ate a
"Go ahead," he drawled, "I suppose it would be a good time to catch up on some reading. I feel as though even through the silencing charms I can hear those blasted drums." Severus gave Harry a little glare as Harry looked sheepish.
“Remus said he’s making muffins and they’ll be done soon,” I blurt out. We sit in silence and I feel my body go aflame. I am a bloody fucking idiot, sweet Merlin.
“Draco! What a pleasant surprise,” Remus said with a warm smile as he wiped his hands off on a tea towel and made his way to pull me into a hug. I met him halfway, and he embraced me tightly in his arms. Remus was probably my favorite of Harry’s family because he just
And everyone expects Harry to go into the Aurors but I expect he’ll go into mediwizardry. It’s always been a quiet fascination of his that was especially fuelled when he was prompted by Severus and Dumbledore to learn first aid through Madame Pomfrey during fourth year because of the Triwizard Tournament, up until the time in sixth year where the war was on the brink of ending or catastrophically pursuing. During those years he learned as much healing through potions from Severus as he could and as many spells as he could from anybody who had knowledge on it. He went through countless books and was always passionate about learning more on the subject.
“Harry James Potter-Snape, of course, you are welcome to join us. Why would you even think differently? Silly boy; that must be what you are,” she said, muttering toward the end with a slightly disappointed shake of her head at Harry. I prayed to Merlin Harry wouldn’t mention us “dating” but it was tempting to let him because it would mean that I wouldn’t have to. “You’ve been coming to the manor since you and Draco were in nappies; I hardly think we’re anything less than family now Harry.” There was love in her voice and a glint in her eyes that always came when she got even slightly mawkish. I could see Harry’s blush under his bronze skin and the way his fingers began twisting around each other like he usually did when he was being shy. I thought about the way she said we were family and gave an inward shudder because the way I have begun to think of Harry was not in an innocent brotherly way. It was an ‘
“So why would another, advanced species take so much time, energy, and resources to come to us? Your question of whether or not it’s bad that someone is here, visiting us, well…” She shivered. “Well, it’s just hard to imagine they’ve come for anything
He’s always been intelligent, even if it’s hard to see that sometimes. I blame that on Sirius.
“Well, for the record, I don't have a problem with you being gay, you should know that you silly dunderhead,”
“Ron, I think the last person Draco would be in love with would be you. No offense mate,” Harry said as he held up his hands. Ron shudders.
“Of course, see you mate.”
It has been almost a week since Harry and I have started fake dating and not much has changed other than the fact that my mother has taken to consistently reassuring me that it’s okay for Harry to come over more or vice versa and while he’s over we shouldn’t shy away from each other now that they know. And while the thought and encouragement is greatly appreciated it’s only stressed me out. I’ve been sort of worried that the reason she’s so persistent is that she and my father don’t believe me. Harry of course disagrees. He just thinks that she’s trying to push me to be happier and make sure that I’m aware of her support. And his reasoning isn’t far fetched or crazy, I’m just a paranoid bastard.
“Good, because I think I’d really like to kiss you right now if that’s okay?” My breath caught in my throat.
“Remus, looking lovely as always. Severus, I see that your scowl has yet to get stuck permanently,” I stood in the doorway, my left hand gripping the frame, as I smiled widely towards both men. Remus spun around, a look of surprise flitted quickly across his face before a look of warmth and affection graced his features. Severus shot me a look of playful disdain, a hint of a smile peeking out.
"No? I never really thought to ask him much past his relationship with Sirius. As I should. That's a weird question Draco" Harry had begun to mumble and gave his hair a tousle as his face contorted in confusion. Okay, yes it was a little weird in how I brought it up, but how else do you tell your best friend that one of his godfathers once dated his best friend's dad?
“Do you plan on hanging out here for a formal invite in your own house or might we be able to venture further in?”
“Yes, well. What kind of luck should boy wonder really expect, hmm?” I let out my own laugh as Harry groaned and rolled his eyes.
“I’ll see you both, in a bit, yes? Dinner should be in ten minutes roughly and I expect to see you both on time,” she spoke sternly, but we knew it wasn’t in bad nature. And with that she took her leave. Once the doors softly shut behind her, I resumed our conversation, turning my eyes back to Harry’s own.
“Yes, I am. I think I’ll apparate there myself, it’ll be a bit easier than trying to hold onto one of you and the box.”
I pushed myself off the door and lightly walked towards Harry, my heart racing slightly and my hands the tiniest bit shaky. I dropped my hands down onto his shoulders giving them a squeeze as I dropped my head down to softly called out his name. Harry's head spun around quickly, and I worried that he might get a serious case of whiplash from the ferociousness of it.
“What sort of snake is it Draco?” Hermione, of course, was the first person to say anything let alone a question.
“Draco,” Harry started softly, “whatever it is, you can trust me with it, okay? You're my best friend. You know that.” I couldn't help but think that Harry just might not feel the same after learning about what I had to tell him. That not only was I gay but that I told my father of all people that we were dating as well?
Surviving dinner with my parents seemed to have been easier than anticipated. Which I’m certainly not complaining about, it just seemed… suspicious. At least on the account of my father. My mother was surprisingly very encouraging and welcoming to my announcement. I thought she might react better than father, which was certainly true, but I didn’t take into account how much better.
Since I’ve been young my father tried instilling a sense of family pride that was rooted in wealth, prestige, and diluted pure-blood beliefs. Father, nor mother for that matter, never used the ‘m’ word I’ve heard some students at Hogwarts and portraits around the manor use. He’s never expressed explicit hate towards muggle-borns and half-bloods, but he’s always talked about pure-bloods having a greater responsibility to keeping “our population” plentiful considering “we’re a dying breed”. And because father was ever so insistent on “replenishing the dying breed”, I felt that perhaps he would be homophobic. Because even though it seems that both my mother and father have broken away from their parents’ ideas and views, some of them still lingered, even if they were thought and taught with good intentions.
“Yes, of course,” I drawled out, “let's sit here for the millionth time and discuss what you want from me, though you know for a fact it isn't what I want. Why won’t you just let me be?” Lucius stared at me for a few seconds before cocking his head to the side slightly. A questioning look flitted across his face.
“Draco,” he started with a laugh, “pot is a muggle drug. More commonly known as weed or marijuana. I’ve heard it can be a relaxant of a type, sometimes a little hallucinatory. But mostly a feel-good buzz.”
“Alright,” I started, “I’ll accept and move on. Be happy and celebrate. Should we talk about the whole fake dating thing?” I was nervous to confront it again but I felt it needed to be addressed for Harry’s sake.
And so I continuously try to remind myself of what Harry told me a couple of nights ago when I was stressing to him my worries: “Stop trying to constantly sabotage yourself. The more you fixate on what you think is wrong or will go wrong will just lead you to disaster. Stop. Breathe. And move on.” All in all, it was solid advice but it’s definitely easier said than done. That leads me to where I am tonight. I’ve taken up muggle yoga, a practice Harry introduced to me. He gave me books he found at a muggle book shop in muggle London with Remus and he said that he thought I would enjoy it. And as much as I hate to say Harry’s right, I do enjoy it. It reminds me of occlumency mixed with stretching and they work quite well together from what I’ve seen so far. There’s a lot of different positions you can hold and some seem silly but they get to be rather fun when you’re not so focused on whether or not you look like a fool.
) look on his face, “I must admit that I, myself, have had my fair share of boys at Hogwarts,” he said with a wink. I tried my best, I promise I did, but I couldn’t help the mock gagging from happening.
There should be more to a marriage than just benefits. And that's what I should have all said to my father. But instead, I panicked because my father wouldn't understand. He was raised, and raised me, to not think that there was nothing more important than wealth, status, and carrying on the Malfoy legacy. Too bad I defected. So instead of saying the truth, I blurted out something that even surprised me.
“Next time, please do. I hear enough of those as is,” Harry groaned. “Now back to our conversation.” I sobered up, a small smile still residing on my face. “I think you don’t have anything to worry about. Not about your dad, not about your mum, and not about that fairy. Things worked out well; celebrate and enjoy that yeah?” I suppose Harry was right. We’re both quite pessimistic, but we generally try to help each other see the light where the other can’t and I think Harry’s right about this light. I should welcome it in with open and arms and just going with the ebb and flow of life. Things are good right now, considering, and why should I jinx that?
Thinking of Harry’s gift to me lead me to remember his birthday that is fastly approaching. In nine days Harry will be 17, an adult in the eyes of the wizarding world. He wanted something big enough that all his friends and family could be there, celebrating more than just a birthday, but a start to a new year not poisoned by Voldemort’s presence. A year that Harry can finally take back as his own without fear. It’s a birthday to Harry that symbolizes freedom and peace. I want to make this birthday special for Harry, I want him to embrace who he has become and start to finally love and care for himself like he’s always pushing others to do.
“Draco, hello.” He sent Dipsy a glance, “She may put that in the kitchen, and the present are to be put upon that table over there.” He gestured with his head to a table with a small gathering of presents.
“They is being in different places sirs. Mrs. Malfoy is still in the gardens and Mr. Malfoy is in his study.”
This morning was just like every other morning, but with an underlying twinge of excitement and anxiousness. I sped through my slight breakfast of toast with orange marmalade and a cup of tea, my mother sending little knowing looks towards my father as though I wouldn’t notice them.
“I think, Draco Malfoy, that I may like you.” He really is out to kill me, isn’t he? Oh Merlin, is this real life? My heart just might pop out of my chest and into his hands if he keeps this up.
I checked on Harry’s presents, satisfied with finding that they were still intact and undisturbed. I called for Dobby and once he popped in I asked him to deliver them to the reception room then to have Dipsy acquire the treacle tart and meet me in there. I made my way to the reception room myself and upon entering the room I saw that my parents were already waiting for me as was Dipsy.
“How is Fred and George’s shop going?” I was genuinely curious to know as they really had blown up and made a name for themselves in such a short time. Their genius was to thank for that, and Harry’s little push certainly helped as well. Many of the lower years frequent their shop despite many of the products being banned from Hogwarts. It was nice to see them become so successful, especially when I personally knew how hard they worked and how much they truly deserved this.
“I called you peaches because you’re sweet, soft, and innocent. Just like a peach,” Harry said smugly. “Now, come along peaches. I want to whip your arse at finding the snitch, and I promise not to use an actual whip… just yet.” Harry started laughing hard as he stood up, making his way towards the door. My face was again in flames and I felt them to my core. Harry Snape-Potter will be the death of me and he doesn’t even know it. And if he does, he surely doesn’t care.
“Hello, Severus. Thank you. Where’s Harry?” I looked around trying to catch a glimpse of his hair but I didn’t see a flash of black hair anywhere.
“Well, unless you’d like to make me a cuppa and talk gossip with me, I’m afraid you lucked out on having me absolutely thrill you with my ramblings,” I said with a smirk. Severus rolled his eyes and took a sip of his tea. Remus’s warm voice cut in and my eyes drifted back to him.
“What does that even mean? Harry no, I meant you’re loony. Like crazy?” He really does concern me sometimes.
“Ooh, I am lucky. Peaches and treacle; my favorite.” Harry’s tone was bordering playful and flirty.
“Maybe that will be our next muggle exposure activity. You know, it is important I learn and understand muggle customs before we move to muggle London this summer,” I said with faux innocence and faux indifference. I never gave much thought to wizarding drugs, what little there are. They’re mainly potions that leave a person wrecked, a shell of who they once were. But this drug sounded nice… and fun.
I wondered how Harry could be so full of love and kindness despite the hate he has dealt with and the war he was forced to fight. I look at him now and he’s writing letters, one of whom I know is for Hermione, a Ravenclaw if I’ve ever met one, and the others are to various Weasleys. His face is smooth of any furrows, as he writes contently, unaware of my inner thoughts playing like a muggle film before me. I think of Harry’s future, of who he’ll marry and have a family with. Who he’ll be career-wise. I only know of Harry dating one person and that was Luna Lovegood. They dated for a solid three months before Luna broke up with Harry saying that the wrackspurts were getting to be too much between both of them and some time apart would help. A few weeks later Luna came to Harry saying Ginny cleared up her wrackspurts and wished the best for him. We’ve debated before on counting Cho Chang but it didn’t feel like a fair count because we’re quite certain Harry was only a rebound out of grief considering the only kiss they shared was one with Cho sobbing over Cedric’s death and most of their “dates” weren’t far off either. And there have been other girls and even selective boys who have expressed an interest in dating the chosen one,
Screw that one time Harry and you rode your brooms through the house and father almost throttled the both of you. And screw the time you both were paintballing and father got caught in the crossfire and was a second away from whipping out his wand and sending an  ‘Avada Kedavra' toward us both. Because this was probably going to be worst. Honestly Draco, great job. So what now am I supposed to do? I’ve basically just come out to my father, even if it wasn’t under circumstances I’d have preferred. I could tell him I was joking. Though I don’t quite think he’d appreciate my “joke…”
Hi there! As I said this was my first dabble into writing chaptered works of fiction and for all of you that enjoyed it, thank you so much! I would have enjoyed writing more on this piece but honestly, I just couldn't find a way to continue it and I feel disappointed in that but I am proud of what my idea has at least manifested into this far. Writing is a small hobby of mine so I don't expect what I produce to be super good or well done but nonetheless I'm glad some of you liked it and gave it some of your time and consideration.
“What brings you 'round today, Draco?” Harry asked me curiously.
“B-but,” I started, stammering my way through what I was trying to say, “what about mother?” Father looked ready to laugh, “what about her?” I looked at him incredulously, “w-what about her!? Does she know? And- and you still flirt with him!” At this point, father was laughing.
“Alright then, discuss.” Harry puts his arms behind his head as he slouches a little further into the chair and rests his right ankle upon his left knee. His eyes are resting shut and he looks like the picture of serenity. How can he be calm after all of this? Fucking prat.
I figure I can start with the items concerning things I can do at the manor, so I send a few freshening charms to myself and set out to complete the first two things I can do on my list:
As always, traveling by floo left me in an unkempt state; I was dusted with bits of soot and floo, my hair stuck up in twisted directions. I muttered a quick cleaning spell as I straightened my clothes and ran a hand through my hair. The smell of warm cinnamon wafted throughout the house and the air felt welcoming. Towards the kitchen, I heard clanking of pots and voices with boisterous laughter. Upon reaching the kitchen I saw Remus distributing equal parts of batter into muffin cups in a pan, chatting with Severus who cradled a mug of tea in his hands.
You must be gone off your pot Snape.”
I don't exactly know how I want to refer to Harry in reference to his last name because in this storyline, in my mind at least, Harry would take Snape on as his last name but keep Potter as an homage to James and Lilly, but I feel that he would want to use Snape as it connects with who he is present-day, not who he could have been with Potter had Lilly and James survived if that makes any sense? But also every time I use Snape it feels out of place and feels like I'm referencing Severus. Any particular thoughts?
“Fun?” Harry scoffs. “You think throwing me to the wolves is fun?”
“Are you always this sassy Harry or is this you practicing being gay?” I remarked snarkily.
I bent down and kissed her cheek smiling back at her, “yes, mother.”
“Well, it was actually more than that if I'm honest. We definitely have dated.” I can't believe this. Remus Lupin, one of Harry’s godfathers, Sirius Black’s- oh my Merlin!
“Well, you're the only one it made sense to say really, we're always together, we hug and cuddle, we're moving in together after this school year finishes.” Harry winces. “I mean we might as well be together at this point. Who else do I bring around my parents and do all of that with?”
“Just practicing, love.” Practicing huh? I don’t mind that. “I’ll be done in a bit if you’d like to head out and wait for me?” He was already turned around finishing the icing on the cupcakes.
With all this in mind, I cease my yoga and instead search for a quill and a piece of parchment. On it, I title the page
As I approached my mother’s hunched figure, hair tied up, and dirt was smeared randomly among her body, I could hear her talking to someone, yet no one was around.
“Yeah,
“Ready as I’ll ever be Harold.” And with that, I grabbed Harry’s hand gripping it perhaps tighter than necessary and begun to pull him out of the reception room and into the foyer where I called for Dobby.
“So I’m guessing you want to talk about our little predicament?” Would that predicament be my secretly raging boner? Because I’d say this is currently the most
“You,” he began with a slight stutter, “you and Harry? As in Harry Potter?”
“As always it is an absolute pleasure to see you as well Narcissa,” Harry voiced with charm. A soft smile was on his face as he spoke with her. “I will indeed be joining you all for dinner if that’s not too much?” Mother gave him an affronted look.
“How lucky for me,” Harry said cheekily. “What have you got there?”
I've noticed that my writing is very dialogue focused and I'm trying to add more substance to it. What do you guys think?
“Oh, I’m sure, Draco. No need to prove to me you’re not vanilla. No siree.”
“So what…” Harry starts, “you want me to grab you some when they're ready? It's not that far of a walk, Draco, but I'll do it I guess.” Oh, Merlin, I wish it was that simple. A nervous laugh makes it's way past my lips, a ball of hot nerves bouncing up into my throat and down into the depths of my stomach.
“He seemed very accepting of this all Harry, don't feel so worried. Besides, I don’t recall planning to throw you to Lupin’s feet so, I think you're safe from the wolves, or in your case, the wolf.”
I let out a laugh reading his letter to me, reveling in the sass Harry sent back my way. I was confused by his use of muggle phrasing as usual, but I didn’t focus too much on it. With a little under 20 minutes till Harry was to arrive, I set off to the library to catch up on some reading.
“Alright, well as you can tell I'm making muffins and they'll be done in 15 or so. Be sure to tell Harry, please?” I gave a mock salute and smiled.
“You kinda weren’t and that’s fine Draco. How many times have you been by my side whilst I did dumb things? Actually don’t answer that please,” Harry said with a grimace.
"Might come here for the night if that's okay Sev?" I asked thinking about what kind of chaos might ensue at home.
“Of course, love. We’ll meet you there then,” Mother replied as she grabbed onto father’s forearm and looked up at him expectantly. “Off we go then, Lucius,” her smile sweet. They left with a pop and I turned to Dipsy.
and grabbed his hand before he pulled us over to the table before he waved his hand, shrinking and collecting the remaining presents and putting them all in one box. He switched the snake over to curl around our conjoined hands before picking the box up and pulling me along towards the house. “Your presents were very thoughtful and lovely.”
“First, who do we tell that we’re only fake dating? This is important because we have your birthday party coming up and my parents will be there and obviously if we’re acting as though we’re in a relationship, people are going to get suspicious.” I hold up two fingers before proceeding, “Secondly, we need to decide on an end date. If we go into the school year “dating” then people will continue to draw conclusions, especially about you, and then girls won’t think you’re straight and it’ll be a whole mess and it’ll take you forever to find a wife and make little Snotter babies.” Harry let out a snort at my last comment and I throw up another finger, “Thirdly,” I cut myself off abruptly and sat there for a moment. “Actually I don’t think I have a third anything.” Harry’s only response for a while was a long and loud exhale from the nose until he finally spoke.
“You’ll see one day, Potter. Blondes have more fun.”
and begin listing items down each with their own individual checkbox.
“Well, I mean,” Harry starts, “as long as it's nothing crazy. But looking at how worked up you are I'm a bit nervous myself to know exactly what it is you want. Sit down, mate.” Harry grabs at my wrist and gives it a small tug while patting the bed. I breathe in deep and sit down across from Harry. My eyes dart around Harry, taking in his appearance and body language. His hair sits messily on his head, curly hair falling around his eyes. His emerald eyes shine bright behind his black-framed glasses.
“Mean what?” We stopped walking once we reached the kitchen, Harry putting the box on the table near us and turning his full attention on me.
“Draco,” Father started, “you know your role as Malfoy heir.” Cue the internal eye roll. How could I not when that's all he ever goes on about these days? I tried my hardest to not let out the sigh that was threatening it's way out.
“Draco, there is much that you do not know of us,” he began, “do not assume there to not be more past these faces. There is always more to someone.” And with that, he proceeded to stand up and begin to walk to the closed doorway.
“Oh, Weasley! You’ve found me out! I have been secretly hoping all along we would both one day become Head Boy of our houses and that we would rule over Hogwarts; how ever did you discover my secret?” The sarcasm from my voice dripped off each word I said.
“So bored you’ve resorted to me then, hm?” Harry said with false sympathy.
“Father,” I began, feeling scandalized, “what do you mean by your “fair share” of boys?” Lucius sat with a smirk on his face and nostalgia-filled eyes.
magazine open to an article that I couldn't pinpoint and a thing Remus called a
“Harry, be a doll and shut the bloody hell up.”
“More than,” I breathed out, and before I know it Harry was pulling his hands up to cup my face and his soft lips molded with my own. I could feel the slight wetness of his mouth until a slide of tongue brushed against my lips and I opened them graciously. Bringing my own hands up to nestle in and grip Harry’s hair I could feel his tongue slide against my own before it left to discover other parts of my mouth and I followed suit. The slick wetness burned a fire deep within me and I felt shy to realize I was growing hard. I went to pull away to gather some air and some sense and as I did so Harry caught my bottom lip with his teeth in a slight grip and pulled. I let out a moan faster than I could have stopped it and feel myself glow with the heat that coursed through me.
“Aw, thank you, love,” I say a wide smile framing my face, “never pegged you as the pet-name type, but it’s quite cute, I must admit.” An iced-over glare is shot my way before Harry drops back on the bed with a deep sigh. ‘This ought to be a bit fun’ I thought as a small smile overtook my face. It was silent for a moment before I remembered my great discovery. "Harry, do you happen to know who Remus once engaged in a relationship with?" Harry sat up with a confused "Uhm" trailing out of his lips.
"First off, you're a posh prat. Secondly, you really had me on there mate. That's a good one." Harry was chuckling with a slight shake of his head as he pointed at me with his index finger in a playful motion.
"I concede," Harry snorted, "but anyways, he dated my father of all people can you believe that?" Harry's mouth dropped down so far I am quite surprised it didn't dislocate or unhinge. Harry looked momentarily scandalized before pure mischief encompassed his face.
He closed his eyes and let out a deep, long sigh before speaking, “how long have you been dating the Potter boy?” I had to think quickly of a date that was believable. Memories with dates rushed through my mind when suddenly the perfect one came barreling through to the front of my mind.
“Dobby, do you know where mother and father are?” I asked just as Harry spoke.
“You make a compelling argument. Merlin, how did everyone not already ask if we've been dating?" Harry said in a bewildered tone, his face matching his sentiment. "Well, you'd have a bigger selection of fake boyfriends if you'd make friends with more people besides the Weasley’s and me. Which brings me to ask; redheads not your type, Malfoy? This all sounds a bit discriminatory,” Harry said with a straight face, hands still holding both of mine and eyes staring straight into my own.
do,” Ron grumbled, stressing the ‘we’ to please Hermione.
“A broom servicing kit, thank you all so much. I had been in need of a new one for ages now!” A snort could be heard from Ron who was sat near me.
Excellent. Should I plan for my demise now or later? I think that if I beg Harry hard enough he’ll put me out of my misery. Or just laugh at me. Yes… forget Harry; I’ll ask Sirius. He wouldn't even bother to ask for details as to why I need to be demised. He’d just do it. Perfect. I wish I had more time to write a will. I’d be sure to leave all my potions books to Harry; he certainly needs them. Not to mention my clothes surely. I mean his style is absolutely horrendous. I’d leave my favorite teacup to mother as I know that she would be the only one to properly take care of it…
Harry's face twisted with doubt, “and how can you be so sure?” I let out an exasperated sigh.
“My dad?
When I walked into Harry’s room, he looked to be already passed out, glasses off with his eyes closed and his mouth slightly agape as soft breaths puffed out and in. I climbed into the bed on the left side, snuggling deep into the covers, taking a deep breath and sighing out once I was situated and comfortable.
“Yeah, I just didn’t expect that answer, but yeah it’s fine. And yeah I am, but can I have some sleeping clothes? We left before I could grab some.”
“Oh shit, yeah, sorry about that by the way,” Harry apologized as he rummaged through his drawers and pulling out some bottoms and shifted through his closet for a shirt. Once he acquired an outfit he handed it to me and I made my way to the bathroom. I looked over the items he handed me, a pair of blue and white plaid fleece pajama pants and an old Appleby Arrows Quidditch t-shirt. Pulling on the pants I noticed that they fit me loosely but were at least the right length. Harry was a little shorter than me so I can only imagine the way the pants must bundle up at his feet, and I wondered, not for the first time why he doesn’t send a sizing charm to some of his clothing and make them actually fit him. He’s told me multiple times that it’s for
Severus said Lilly came to him in tears saying that the child was his and was conflicted about how to handle the situation. Severus by then had already conspired with Albus Dumbledore and was sent to be a spy in Voldemort’s league. He said that he told her to do as she wished because it was her body and her relationship that would be affected, he also told her of his mission to become the Order’s spy saying that he was not fit to be a parent when his child would be in such danger. A few days after their meeting Lilly owled that she would continue with the pregnancy and that James knew the truth and would honor Severus by being sure the child knew the truth of his or her parentage should Severus want that and that Severus was welcome to be a part of the child’s life. And so upon the deaths of Lilly and James Potter, in their will stated that should both perish before Harry’s 17th birthday, Severus Snape, Harry’s true birth father, was to decide if he would take the child in or pass guardianship rights to Sirius Black and Remus Lupin. Severus felt it only right to take the child in, a moral sense of obligation playing a role, but also his longing for a family and now with Voldemort out of the picture, he could be the father he wished he had.
Seconds after I finish conducting my letter and calling for Dobby to take care of the supplies and to mail off the letter, Dipsy comes in with my lunch. I thank her before she pops out of the room and I start in on my lunch. Half an hour later I am finished with my meal and awaiting Harry’s reply until in comes an owl from one of the open windows in the conservatory. Harry’s response is brief and written on the back of my own letter.
type of way. And I have no intention of bringing back the antique way of keeping it in the family.
“It’s great seeing you again too Dobby,” Harry said with a fond smile. Harry had made friendly with Dobby years ago when Harry would stay the night and mother and father thought we needed to be monitored to ensure we didn’t get
The dinner scene isn't my favorite and if I'm honest I struggled to write it which is why it took so long for this chapter to be posted. So I do apologize for that. Hopefully, so far the story is interesting enough and you enjoy reading it though :)
“Okay then, that was simply put. Thank you for your contribution to my inquiries.”
“Come with me?” I gave a soft
“Quidditch,” I shoot out immediately before registering that he said peaches. “Peaches? What do you mean?” I eyed Harry with distrust, my face still flushed.
“Well from how things here are looking you might as well call me Malfoy. Next thing I know you’ll panic blurt that we’re getting married and you know I refuse to face the wrath of your parents so I won’t be able to deny it.”
I almost couldn't help the gigantic smile from blossoming on my face; instead, I settled for a small amused grin, “father, whatever do you mean?” He looked up and gave me a look that blatantly said
“Quite well actually. They’re in the process of developing new products so I can’t wait to see McGonagall’s face when she sees them this year!” Ron’s excitement was evident and so was the disappointment in Hermione.
I did take notice that I never saw Harry’s mother around when we were little and thank Merlin I was instilled with enough decorum to not blatantly ask Harry in my little child stupidity why he didn’t have one, but it also helped that I had my simple-minded child brain and didn’t care enough to focus on more than playing with Harry. I eventually asked my own mother when I was older and had enough sense in me to understand things with more clarity and comprehension. She was honest with me and explained who Voldemort was and how he killed Harry’s mum and dad, and even tried to hurt Harry but he miraculously survived and even somehow killed Voldemort.
Severus desperately wanted to cease his part-time career spying for Harry’s sake, but Harry insisted to him that only harm would ensue from that decision. Harry said they would fight constantly about it until one day he told Severus that he didn’t have to worry about losing him as his son because no matter what Harry would love him and accept him. Harry told me that that was one of the few times he’d ever seen his dad cry and hold him.
My morning is another quiet affair. Breakfast with my parents as usual, with light conversation. Father leaving for the ministry after saying his goodbyes to us both. Mother and I then take a walk through the gardens, until she leaves for tea with Aunt Andromeda and Mrs. Weasley. Then it’s just me. This is the same routine we’ve lived for years now so it’s no surprise how my morning plays out. Simple. Kind of lonely some days, though I will admit. It’s nearly lunch when Dipsy pops in the conservatory where I’ve been settled since mother left.
“I can see that,” I said with a smirk, “congratulations.”
“Well if it’s any good I’ll survive to see tomorrow. It is about time to put it to the test innit?”
I was about ready to move onto my next ramble of thought processes before Harry’s warm voice interrupted me.
“So we won’t run the montage of every dumb thing you’ve gotten yourself into thus far?” I asked slyly with a slight smile. Harry let out a sigh that had traces of a hidden laugh.
one of the Weasley twins candies designed to swell your tongue and cause you to sweat while your face turned an incredibly bright shade of red as your temperature safely (though it's debatable just how
“Of course you’re not, peaches.” I flushed a light pink at the nickname and saw the way Hermione gave an inquisitive eye to our interaction adding to my lushness.
“Mother,” I began questioningly, “who are you speaking with?”
Dipsy was already in the kitchen when I arrived there and she greeted me excitedly. “Is master Draco ready to be baking the treacle tart, sir?” I gave her a friendly smile and told her yes, and watched her bustle about collecting everything it seemed that we would need to prepare Harry’s favorite dessert. Once it seemed that she had slowed down I spoke up.
“Oh I’ve been spending most of it with Ron,” she glanced at Ron with a smile as she swung their arms.
"Besides, I'm pretty sure everyone and their mum knows that you're gay Draco. I've honestly just been waiting for the day you told me." I blanched at Harry's statement. Was it that obvious? “But Draco, I gotta ask, why me?” And there's the million-dollar question; why Harry? It surprised even me, how am I to know why I chose Harry? There are reasonable explanations as to why Harry was the right choice, but I wasn't thinking of those reasons at the time. In fact, I wasn't thinking at all. But Harry didn't need to know that.
It sounds like a relatively complete list and I don’t think I’ve forgotten a single thing, which makes me content. One thing I’ve always loved to do is write lists. Harry hates it sometimes but it’s something that keeps me organized and keeps me from losing my head.
“Merlin, Draco!” Harry said with a jump, his jade-green eyes wide and mouth hung open. With a flick of his wand the music turned down, now sounding low and slightly muffled. He tossed his drum sticks off to the side and turned his body around so that he was facing me.
, after coming to the acknowledgment of my attraction to Harry.
Yes, that'd be about a reasonable time to say.
You see, I have yet to convince him that this isn't what I want. But as usual, it isn't about what I want; it's about what he wants.
“Well, I mean… It's not like I want to think about you and mother dating people!” I was strangely intrigued by the idea of this pairing. And more importantly, when has my father ever liked guys? One too many events have happened in the last hour, and I am suddenly well worn out. I glance longingly at the liquor cabinet and my father’s empty short tumbler. Just as I finished my inwards battle on whether or not I should just get up and get some, my father spoke.
“Only that he’s madly in love with me. Too bad ‘Mione already has me Malfoy and
“Alright then, Draco,” Harry started with a smirk, “I’ll just have to see one day, won’t I?”
“Of course I don’t have an issue with that. Goodness, no.”
He says it should be an honor to be a pureblood wizard. And isn’t that silly? We should
"I might've forgotten a few times, but at least I remember most times." Severus let out a pained sigh and waved his hand in a dismissive motion.
“Master Draco, whats will you be eating for lunch, sir?” I contemplate for a moment before settling on something simple
After finishing up eating, I walked up to my room and started to get ready. After taking a shower, I looked at my spread of clothing and thought that for Harry, I’d wear some of the muggle clothing he’d bought me a while back. Once I was dressed in slim-fit black jeans and a mossy green short sleeve shirt, I found a pair of stacked heel Chelsea boots to go with the outfit and observed myself in the mirror. It felt odd wearing the muggle clothing and I can only imagine how my parents would react to the outfit. I was originally skeptical and uneasy about wearing muggle clothing, but after discussing moving to muggle London, Harry convinced me that I’d have to get used to wearing something other than robes. It also helped that I looked
Lucius looked quite surprised. Hell, even I was trying my best not to look surprised. He mouthed like a goldfish for several seconds before actually saying anything.
Every face at the eighth year table turned towards her, many with mouths gaping. Harry supposed they hadn’t heard the additions to her vocabulary yet. This was nothing.
Harry cringes. God, is the bond really that strong? Even Gilderoy Lockhart hadn’t made Hermione do that… but it doesn’t matter, really. What matters is that Ron’s wife is in love with Harry’s boyfriend, and Harry should’ve told Draco he loved him first.
McGonagall’s lips twitched. “Be that as it may, Malfoy, you must know that the transfiguration wouldn’t hold.” She passed the rock back to him. “I’m surprised it lasted as long as it did, to be frank. Notice the central segment of the cross-section; it’s reverting to mica again.”
“Yes?”
And Malfoy seems pleased by this. He falls forward again, and their bare chests press together hot and damp. He slides his fingers into Harry’s hair and drags his tongue along Harry’s jaw. “Potter,” he whispers.
“You would not have done that,” said Draco. “You’re too stupid.”
Malfoy nodded. “We’ve made good progress.” He took a deep breath, gave Harry a searching look. “I think we can do this, Potter.”
“More so than any other house, I’d wager,” Draco said. “But don’t tell Pansy I said that.”
“I believe the words they used were ‘Climate change is a hoax,’” Narcissa said. “I’m not sure what that means.”
again. I’ve been given a new research team to figure it out. It’s already been over a month since Atlantis appeared. I don’t see how we could possibly
“I know,” Harry said, finally.
” The voice was muffled, as if buried beneath a pile of socks and pants, which, in fact, it was. “Potter, come here immediately!”
Potter, strangely, seemed to know exactly where to go, which was just like Potter. Of course he’d know Draco’s little secret. Millicent Levitated the alien through the tunnel, not taking particular care to keep it from bumping the rough stone walls. They were halfway to Hogwarts and the statue of the young hag when Potter grabbed his wrist and pulled him to a stop. Millicent nearly ran into them and the alien’s head banged the wall.
“Voldemort,” Harry guessed.
“In a sense,” said Lucius. He smiled, sharp white teeth slowly becoming visible. “They’re unused, untraceable Portkeys.”
Harry rolled his eyes. He was no more awake than the rest of them, despite the Pepper-Up potion from Madam Pomfrey, so they could just fuck right off.
Hermione’s sobs reached new levels. “Mill!” she wailed, half-laughing, half-crying. Her fingers curled into the fabric of the other woman’s robes and kneaded, catlike. “They wrote me a letter!”
“I don’t—” Harry starts to say, but his voice cuts off at that word and won’t pick up again to finish the sentence. He glares at Dawlish, thinking,
“It’s just Charms,” he said again. “You altered a Protean Charm for a galleon, made an infinite handbag, and survived a duel with Antonin Dolohov with only a 30 centimetre scratch. I think you’ll be fine.”
“Duh,” he said. “We have Muggle families.”
Severus was silent for a few moments, only slow, black blinks to show he was still conscious at all. Finally, he said, “Have you looked up recently?”
Harry doesn’t know. He feels like he never knows anymore. Shaadhon has calmed down now that all of the magic has been dampened and is currently sniffing a dead seagull lying further down. Harry pulls out a deck of Cards Against Humanity and raises his eyebrows at Draco. Maybe it’ll help to settle his nerves at the least.
“How’s work?” Andromeda was asking them. “Did you ever catch the person trying to steal Liesl Shacklebolt’s identity? I haven’t seen anything at all in the paper.”
After supper, Mrs Weasley pushed another glass of mulled cider in their hands, and shooed Harry, Draco, and the others back to the living room for presents. Mrs Weasley got a very coy look on her face when she unwrapped Harry’s flying yarn, and Mr Weasley was ecstatic with his game. He set off right away trying to figure out how to set it up on the telly, and Harry let him have at it for a while. If he hadn’t figured it out in twenty minutes, he’d go and help. He’d got Teddy a new colour-changing teddy bear, and it was already syncing up with Teddy’s own hair colours. Hermione loved her gifts from him and Ron, and Ron was very pleased with the autographed (and
