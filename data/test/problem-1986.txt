He couldn’t help but wonder if anyone else had ever touched it before besides Harry, himself. Was it another thing that only Draco was privy to, like seeing him in the morning without glasses? Ron and his other roommates from Hogwarts had likely seen that before. But had anyone else woken up to it beside them? Maybe the Weasley girl. Had she touched his scar as well?
Harry’s conversation with Teddy only a few minutes ago came back to him. He glanced at the open door, seeing the very corner of the sofa. He scrubbed the back of his hot neck. “I think I’d rather stay,” he admitted. He got to his feet. “My back has started to hurt a bit. It’s a comfortable sofa to nap on but not a great bed.”
Weasley rolled his eyes and turned back to his friends. Both Granger and Potter scoffed and sent light glares as well before returning to their huddle.
“Oh right,” she hurried to scribble down her number as well as something else. “Our address as well,” she said, returning the pen and paper, “call or come by if anything happens. If we aren’t there, we’re in the office.”
“No, no,” Ron shook his head again, even more profusely now, “I don’t, I’m just surprised.” Harry tilted his head quizzically. “Well, I was sort betting on you pulling away before you caught the snitch, if you know what I mean. But…you liked it?”
Draco yanked his hand away and stared at the door with wide eyes. Then a sing-song voice called out, "Draco, rise and shine!" The doorknob began to giggle, and he was only able to sit up before the door flew open. "Your fav-"
The flashes of memories bombarded Draco. He remembered many days in the Great Hall he wished he could forget. He recalled the days sitting at the Slytherin table, watching Dumbledore at the high table seemingly oblivious as Draco contemplated his death. Sometimes he still caught himself staring at the large window and pictured the glass spilling out like jewels, fragments lashing his face and drawing blood, his aunt’s wicked laughter melding with the sound of shattering.
“Potter!” Malfoy scolded. He glared down at the boy laying perpendicular over him, barely supporting himself up on his hand. “What are you doing?”
If it wasn’t the hopeful Slytherins trying to clean off their reputation and stay clear of him, then it was Death Eater sympathizers tossing him notes at meal time or sending quick jinxes his way in the halls. It was strange that of everything people on either sides of the war could decide to agree on, it was to torment the only person who had helped both at one point.
"What's that?" Malfoy asked when they reached the ground floor. He gestured to the drape, which hung over the portrait of Sirius' mother.
“He’s what?” Hermione stared at her boyfriend in absolute bewilderment. She had only beaten him to their apartment by about two minutes and was still trying to process her workday, let alone the news they were having company. She felt like she’d forgotten what it was like to have Harry over. Not to mention she knew that neither of them had anything planned for a meal of any kind.
They tore apart in a second then bolted for the room. They pushed past the door and found Harry had a room to himself. His face was bruised and battered and twisting into a contorted shape as he wrinkled his forehead.
“Who?” Ron demanded. Harry couldn’t make his mouth work, floundering for any bit of sense. Ron’s eyes narrowed. “It’s Charlie, isn’t it? You’re always staring at him.”
It was almost impossible to stop the bitter laugh that fell out of Harry’s mouth. “And have you ever believed me?”
It was Pansy who had broken the news to her. They had started frequent correspondents months ago when Draco moved away on his own, mostly to exchange notes on how he was doing when either one visited and to be certain someone was making an appearance at least once a month.
It only took a moment for Ron to catch on. He dropped the chip he was about to put in his mouth. As if it was hard liquor, Ron snatched up his water and took a quick gulp of it before settling his full attention on Harry. After another quick scan of Harry’s person, Ron said, “So things went well I presume?”
He hadn’t noticed he had stood until Hermione had spoken. He looked down at his friends. “Second-floor girls’ lavatory?”
Robards heaved to his feet. “I suppose he is,” he sighed. “He was mid-speech when I was called out.”
They both turned back to the large fireplace in Grimmauld’s kitchen. The Burrow was just out of range for comfortable apparition so they had to Floo there. Draco wasn’t entirely comfortable with popping into the middle of their house suddenly but it was less hassle than acquiring a portkey. Seeing his discomfort, Harry had insisted that they sit for a cup of tea with Kreacher before they left to calm him but it only prolonged the inevitable. Despite his hard glare, Draco’s hands were balled into trembling fists at his sides.
“Then we’ll need someone who knows how to accommodate you,” she declared. She looked at Draco. “As long as that’s okay with you? I understand if you were looking forward to a night off.”
Harry hesitated but gradually lowered his hands. The moment they were in his lap, Malfoy punched his arm. “You liar!”
Zabini leaped to his feet to take Draco’s hands. “None of that matters anymore, though. You’ve been amazing lately. Everyone loves you, even the Gryffindors. We don’t have to worry about that.”
For a moment, sadness filled him when he realized which memory was the dream. Then sense finally snapped back. He couldn't be having dreams like that, not about Draco, especially not while sleeping next to him. Thoughts like that would just ruin things.
He turned to put the glasses on the side table, not noticing that Harry had reached out to match his motion. However, instead of reaching for a pair of nonexistent glasses, his hand found Malfoy’s hair.
Once, without thinking, Harry had suggested going to Diagon Alley, and Malfoy's panic attack lasted almost thirty minutes. They usually just walked the length of Park Row, going around the block if Malfoy was feeling bold, then back up to the apartment. It was at least enough to get some fresh air.
Malfoy attempted a long shaky breath and held onto it for a second before it burst out of his lungs again. Harry nodded quickly. "That's good, that's good. Keep going."
After their meal, Draco used minimal persuasion to talk Harry into going back to the flat with him. They walked. The rare, dry London night provided a unique opportunity. They listened to the rumble of the city. Cars slushing through the damp streets. Distant sirens. The muffled sound of a guitar paired with a deep voice from inside a lounge they passed.
It took several reads before Draco processed everything they had said. It felt strange to see his own name written in that sharp, heavy scrawl. It didn’t appear they had made any connections but they did seem strangely paranoid.
Andromeda assessed the pair. Her previous suspicious were confirmed. However, she didn’t feel the pride of being correct. If anything, it made her sick. Of all these years of trusting Harry, she never thought he could be so stupid.
No one pushed it after that, including Harry, and Malfoy went back to his silent reading all alone in the corner. Harry felt something warm blossom in his stomach, not much unlike the feeling that once spurned him on to compete with Malfoy for all those years. A new challenge had arisen.
He passed the Dailey Prophet stand. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the front page with two figures standing far too close. He refused to look. He refused to give them the reaction they were looking for.
Zabini sneered. He shoved back against Harry, who was too light on his feet to fight it. Zabini started fixing his robes as he straightened. “It killed me to do that to him,” he huffed, “but I had to survive.”
The door had long closed when she finally turned back to Harry. “Are you sure this is what you want?” Her eyes darted across his face, looking for some sign of struggle, any hint of doubt. It was as if she suspected he was being held, hostage.
“Like I said, you’ve fixed all my problems. I’ve actually been thinking about it for some time. I just assumed you two were already together.” He smiled. “It appears I still have a chance.”
The bright wide eyes of his godson sent a pang of guilt through Harry’s chest. He looked hopelessly between Molly, the child, and Draco beside him. Draco took a careful step away followed with a reassuring nod. Harry silently thanked him.
He knew his way by heart. Before long he was standing on Grimmauld Place, watching number twelve shove its neighboring houses aside. The steps were still worn but the battered front door had a fresh coat of paint and the serpent knocker had been replaced by a regular, bronze ring. He watched as the small sign stuck in the prosperous flowerbeds dropped down to show the words POTTER MEMORIAL ORPHANAGE.
“And what’s the point of telling me that?” Harry interrupted. “You think that’s going to scare me off? Sorry, unlike someone else I know, my friend being gay doesn’t scare me.”
Malfoy’s shoulders relaxed. That made more sense―in a muddled Gryffindor type way. His eyes found the lightning-shaped bolt etched just behind his fringe, and he wondered for the first time how much he hated it.
Robards slanted a look up the man. “You know him better than most. You really think that’ll be enough?”
“Not quite,” said the woman, her voice only a fraction smoother than Bellatrix’s. “I think you’re referring to my sister.” Draco stumbled as if this information had smacked him across the face. He glanced back at Teddy and the pieces began to fall into place. This was in fact his aunt but not the one he knew. He let Harry guide his arm to his side.
Draco shifted, a shy smile playing on his own lips. Harry grinned at his friends. They really were the absolute best.
Ron kept going. It appeared to almost pain him to speak, but he feared that if he stopped, he wouldn’t say what he needed to say.
Conversations ebbed and flowed, naturally changing between topics and who was adding their opinion. Draco didn’t add anything of his own. He had become preoccupied with spying some ash still in Harry’s mop from Flooing to the Burrow. He started to pick it out detected but he didn’t expect Harry to lean into his touch or for him to lull his eyes so much. Was he trying to be obvious? He gave a quick pinch the root of his hair. Harry claimed retribution by pinching Draco’s ankle. Draco stomped his foot following it with a kick to Harry’s thigh.
Her face fell. “Oh Harry,” she simpered. He instantly turned his face back towards the mantel. “You really need to learn to think before you speak.”
“I’m going to kill you,” Harry snarled. His voice was capped by a hard thunk. Aberforth had just arrived with all four mugs in hand. His eyes darted once from Ron to Harry, then back again before sighing and shaking his head.
Draco frowned at the folder again, as if he could see through the thick paper. That didn’t add up with the assumption that they had all been random killings. Draco had watched enough muggle television to know that location mattered. “I might have been mistaken about him being crazy,” Draco said. Harry looked at him oddly. “Well, he is crazy, but he isn’t stupid. Weren’t you nearly caught in Diagon Alley during the war?”
He spun back to face her. “You’re right,” he admitted. “You’re also right that I don’t like it, but,” he glanced up at the ceiling towards Harry’s room, “I hate this even more. I refuse to invite Umbridge over for dinner, but,” he heaved a sigh, “I guess I can handle Malfoy.”
“No, you’re gonna pay. You’re gonna pay for all of that, and you’re gonna pay for what you’ve done to Harry.” Ron released one hand only to shove his wand in Draco’s face. However, he hesitated when the fear in Draco’s eyes abruptly changed.
With his best effort, he pushed away his father’s hisses and tried to coax out the small voice in his head he now knew as his own.
Harry went to open his mouth, but Ron and Hermione answered for him in a chorus, “Harry doesn’t drink tea.”
Let me tell ya, my obsession with BBC America growing up is my only saving grace with British slang and it's subpar at best.
It would be easy to act like he didn’t. Only, that was a lie, and lying to Malfoy just felt wrong now. It was strange but true. Besides, it wasn’t as if he had said anything especially embarrassing. It hadn’t been much worse than anything he had said to Ron or Hermione before. They were both well aware of his affinity to compliment or cling when he had too much. Ron would typically spend the following week repeating whatever he said simply to torment him. Malfoy doing that wouldn’t be a big deal.
“Wait, no,” Heather called, waving after them. “Don’t leave; I’ll keep her in line. I want to hear all about how you two got together.”
Harry was the only one who didn’t add his own. No one had to ask. He would win without a doubt. They saw the flocks of students pouncing on him the moment he was alone, and even occasionally breaking past Ron and Hermione to get to him. No one would compete.
Andromeda looked at the boy oddly, opening her mouth to instinctively deny. “Actually,” she said, turning back to the cupboards, “I do. My sister just sent me some a little while ago.” She picked up a yellow tin that Harry recognized well. “I haven’t even opened it,” she muttered more to herself.
He rolled forward to kiss Draco’s temple then his cheek then this jaw. Draco turned his face to give him permission to finally kiss his lips. It started as a peck like the others but, like a drunk man needing another hit from the bottle, he returned for a longer sip.
Hermione nodded with a twinkle in her eye. For possibly the first time ever, she did not reprimand him for abandoning homework. He set off at a dash.
Malfoy’s hand began to loosen and Harry felt a bolt of panic through his chest. He dropped the sleeve to grab onto Malfoy’s arm instead. “I don’t have any ulterior motives, I swear. I just want to put the past behind us.”
Soft lips swallowed Harry’s words. He instantly kissed back. His brain went fuzzy in the most delightful way. He’d been longing to feel this sensation again for what felt like ages.
Walking through London holding Draco’s hand, Harry found that he still had those rose-colored glasses on and it felt like he had a permanent sticking charm keeping them on his face. His friends were safe and happy. He had Draco all to himself. He hadn’t even had as many nightmares recently. He was so unbelievably happy.
On paper, the last three months were a dizzying dream. They were full of hotel room sheets, ancient buildings, and cities overfilling with life. In reality, they were probably the hardest and most rewarding months of either of their lives. Not only did they burry themselves into cultures – muggle and magical alike – but they ventured into deeper places as well.
Draco shook his head fervently, his chin brushing against the knees he pulled up to his chest. “I’m doing it again. I’m making the same mistake twice.”
“Okay, a few more minutes won’t hurt, I suppose,” Harry agreed. That was all Teddy needed to hear. His puppy-like expression instantly switched to a wide grin. He began to tug Harry to the table where an overly sprinkled cake sat, proudly telling Harry that he helped decorate it.
“Please, it’s not like we’re exhibitionists,” Harry claimed without a hint of remorse, making Draco’s face flame up even more.
Harry couldn’t forget it, though. He didn’t know what this reaction meant, and he couldn’t stop overanalyzing it. He finished changing then crawled under the duvet with Draco.
"Really?" Malfoy said slowly. "I never would have imagined. I thought you were going to put it under a lamp and wait."
Day turned to night, and they had dinner together then watched Will & Grace. It might have been a perfect day had Harry not had to go back to Grimmauld. Of course, he didn't have to. Malfoy had offered to let him spend the night whenever but he couldn't have possibly been serious. Malfoy had to be getting sick of him eventually. No one had ever
She waved a hand as she followed his guiding hand. “No one calls me that much anymore, Narcissa will do.”
There was one hiccup, though. His smile dampened. "I'll have to tell Roberts, though, just so he knows my information is creditable."
“Did something happen at work today?” Malfoy asked, hoping to find some sort of source for this behavior.
For a brief moment, it had sparked Harry’s suspicions. But he soon realized that Draco did not have interest in getting involved in anything around him, not even the fun interactions like drinking games, let alone bothering to conduct evil plans. He kept his head low. Not even the Slytherins appeared to want him, including fellow eighth-years. Quite honestly, his roommate, Zabini, acted as his most ardent critic. If Harry didn’t pity Malfoy enough, then the way his former friend treated him certainly did.
Draco opened his mouth, the processing was visible in his eyes, then closed it. “You’re ridiculous.”
Malfoy also started to sleep regularly in Harry’s room, only separating when someone would catch wind that McGonagall would do a room check. These nights were also when Ron magically materialized in his own bed. On the nights when they were together and their nightmares overwhelmed them, they would either go down to the Common Room to watch the fireplace or sit in the room and talk.
Her eyes ran over the Malfoy boy. A thick ball of cotton formed in her throat. “You of all people should understand the burden of physical similarities between family members,” she voiced. “You have your father’s eyes after all.”
“I don’t know if she said those exact words,” Harry said carefully, “but Ron said you were invited.”
In the end, he took Hermione's advice and attempted to improve his lot. He gave the elf a room of its own, though he rarely spent much time there, and an allowance that Harry was pretty sure he just used for groceries. Nevertheless, he did seem a lot happier.
This felt like a very sizable confession which meant that his stranger was likely a bloke as well. Something jittery ran through Draco’s chest and plummeted into his stomach.
Ron batted away the paper. “I’ve seen the papers and I know my partner. He’s not under any influence. There’s no news so get over yourselves and get back to work.”
"Oh," Malfoy's face began to fall, "well if you ever want to go out instead of coming here, you can just tell me."
Malfoy began to shake his head harder. “No, no. I don’t want to put her in that position. It’s better that we don’t have any contact.”
Ron leveled on him. “You’re joking, right?” Harry started to argue but Ron kept on. “I’m your friend, Harry, your best friend in fact, but we’ve never shared a bed, especially for an extended period of time.”
Still trying to register what was going on, Harry silently blinked at the well-lit living room. He was at Malfoy's, he could figure that out, but it took a little longer for him to remember that they'd been watching a movie. He must have fallen asleep. He started to get up and, as he did, noticed the blanket that was usually on the back of the couch was wrapped around him though he never remembered pulling it down. He tore it off, messily throwing it back into place before getting to his feet and stretching to his full height with a yawn.
Without a word, Malfoy placed his glass on the table and swirled it around the glass before lifting it to his lips and taking a whiff; he considered the smell then took a sip, swishing it around his mouth then finally swallowing.
It looked like Malfoy was going to agree, but he frowned when Harry went to pick up the cookware he had picked out. He turned to Kreacher. "Where are your wine glasses?"
They all shuffled carefully past Andromeda who barely moved to give them enough room to pass. Silence remained behind them, but as Draco mumbled once they were out of earshot, “It’s better than screaming.”
“It’ll dry,” Harry assured as he began to take a very leisurely stroll to his coat. Draco didn’t look away when he moved, now mentally cursing his eyes as they appraised Harry’s backside. Had he somehow gotten more muscular since that heatwave that knocked his shirt off for nearly a week?
"No, and I have a feeling we'll have to go a little farther than London for it," Harry said. "This is an American program."
Draco had a horrible feeling he did know his stranger better than he thought and had done something to them in the past. It wasn’t farfetched. He used to think himself untouchable with Crabbe and Goyle at his side and his father willing to do just about anything to keep his record clean. His father would always scold him after but it was never the same way he would if he caught Draco reading a muggle book or admitting that muggle-born Granger had done better than him in some class. No, his father’s scoldings when he did something ‘wrong’ were practically encouragement compared to everything else, and above all, at least he didn’t ignore him.
Malfoy uncrossed his body, smacking the table as he got to his feet. “Well then, Kreacher,” he said loudly, “take me home. I need to get some clothes.”
Seeing that he needed it but didn’t want to ask, Malfoy wrapped his arms around Harry’s shoulders and pulled him into a tight embrace. Harry began to soften. His fingers twisted into Malfoy’s shirt at his waist. His face resting on Malfoy’s shoulder
Robards didn’t reprimand him this time. He let out a long sigh. “And I regret not taking you seriously but there is nothing I can do about it now. We’ll just have to do what we can to clean this up.” He picked up the paper and began to fold it back up. “For now I’m putting you on light duty. I think it would be best if you stay in the office as much as possible while this sorts itself out.”
Harry pulled in a deep breath, supplying his lungs with just enough oxygen to manage a clear response, “Sounds good.” Draco shuttered, feeling the hum of the other man’s chest against his own with each horse word.
"How is your mother?" It was as good of a topic as any. Talking about interior design wouldn't last forever, and Harry didn't want to get back onto the subject of Skeres.
“I already do,” he gave her a perplexed look, “it’s what Draco calls you in his letters. I’ll admit, I assumed for a while that he he was taking about a different Harry. I never would have dreamed...” She fell silent, her eyes assessing her surroundings once more. “I suppose I really shouldn’t be surprised actually. He always did like taking about you. Drove Lucius mad.”
Draco shook his head slowly. “I don’t want that.” Harry’s eyes snapped to him and saw the pale gaze welled up in grief. “I don’t want you to just play along to make me happy. I don’t want you to kiss me out of pity.”
“And I said no press,” Robards spat, blocking the doorway. “You can wait for my formal announcement like everyone else.”
Draco had mentioned Harry’s occasional visits. Nevertheless, it was after Pansy’s visit in May that she told Narcissa that they wouldn’t have to worry as much anymore, that Harry Potter was taking care of him. Narcissa had read the letter a dozen times, attempting to come up with any other person named Harry Potter. What were the chances it was someone else though?
Harry started down the entry hall. It had taken some great effort but the portrait of Walburga Black had finally been removed. All of the rotting wallpaper had been torn down and replaced with fresh coats of taupe paint which was slowly being covered by pictures of the children who lived there.
Malfoy sighed as if his plans had been foiled. Instead of giving a real answer, he decided to find another way to fluster Harry. “Considering we didn’t actually sleep together, I didn’t think we needed to have the morning after talk. If it really meant that much to you then I suppose I’ll listen, but it seems unfair since I didn’t get the pleasure that usually goes along with the awkward conversation.”
One last shaky breath fell from Harry’s lips, and he wrapped his arms securely around Malfoy’s waist, burying his damp face into the crook of Malfoy’s neck.
Every bit of mirth on Harry’s face fell away. The only time he could recall doing anything that would leave a mark was in their sixth year in that damn bathroom. But Snape had gotten there so quickly, even the blood in the water had faded away. It couldn’t have actually left a mark. “Snape healed you.”
Harry wheeled around to send a harsh glare. When Malfoy only smirked in response, he punched his foot. Malfoy gave a short kick, but it was enough to nearly knock Harry over.
Harry groaned and crossed the room. He was trying to keep his distance due to not trusting his current state of mind, but getting close seemed to be the only way to ever get Malfoy to make sense.
He stopped at the open doorway as if a shield charm had been put up. The warmth in his chest became hot, and his muscles tensed, his lungs suddenly beginning to burn too hot to get a good breath.
Malfoy didn't back down. "Just tell me where they live. I'm sure Pansy would love to curse a muggle or two."
Draco instantly stiffened. His hand instinctively twitched for his wand lying on the table, the action not at all going unnoticed by Patil. Her eyes narrowed, the scowl deepening. Draco had shared enough Charms classes with Padma Patil and the other Ravenclaws to know they were fierce with charms. He also knew she’d been a part of Dumbledore’s Army like Luna. Paranoia was expected.
Draco pushed his spatula around the pan, careful not to break the yoke. “It will be ready in a moment.”
Malfoy pressed his head harder against his knees. "No, no. I hurt you. I keep hurting people. I'm sorry." He clutched his hands so tightly to his head that it appeared like he was trying to crush his own skull.
Hermione, Neville, and Draco hadn’t noticed the conversation in the kitchen as opposed to those who were closer. They were in a heated discussion about a book Neville claimed had misleading title –
He got down to the Common Room but forwent the chamomile—it didn’t work once already. He balled up into the same spot he had been in before, flicking on a fire to give himself something to watch.
“Fine,” Harry sighed. He placed his mug on the coffee table, allowing it to steep. “You can keep me company then.” He gave the clock a fleeting glance although he didn’t concentrate enough to actually read the numbers. “I probably won’t be going back to sleep anyway.”
When a second passed, and neither had said anything or pushed away, they both leaned forward once again. Harry pulled Draco’s face to his, Draco’s fingers twisting with his.
He didn't get far. Draco launched himself forward, grabbing Harry's wrist. "Harry, please. You're in no state to be out there. Just sleep a few hours.
A smile tugged on Harry’s mouth, and both Ron and Hermione straightened. They hadn’t seen that one before. “We do, but it’s actually sort of fun. Honestly, I think seeing Malfoy flustered and frustrated is more fun than seeing him angry. He definitely doesn’t like it.”
Malfoy took another deep breath. His smile began to fall. The cogs in his mind began to work. He turned back to the wine racks. "A crisp, dry white would probably suit that. A Chardonnay, perhaps." Harry hoped he was talking to himself because he had no idea what Malfoy was talking about.
Despite this, he tried to roll over and just go back to sleep. He wasn't in the mood to be productive today. However, the tapping sound coming from the sitting room insisted that he didn't get away with this.
Unlike back at the Burrow, things were different the following day after their talk. Maybe it was because he was already friends with everyone in the Weasley household, or perhaps it just meant more hearing Malfoy be vulnerable.
Harry began to shove Malfoy out, but the yelp of pain that came from the other man made Harry recoil. His breathing began to worsen again as he looked down in horror at where he’d grasped Malfoy’s arm.
over it and stepped inside. The sound of clinking from the kitchen caught Harry’s attention. He hurried around the small lip of wall that shielded the entrance from the kitchen and found Draco glaring at the stove.
Ron couldn’t have actually been that upset about what Harry had said, could he? He wouldn’t do that to Harry.
“Up for a game of quidditch after Charms today?” he asked Harry, as if forgetting Hermione was beside him.
This time it was Draco who initiated the nod of acknowledgment. He expected her to return it but instead, “Take care of him.” Her voice was stiff, but he could hear the underlying “
“I’ve got you now,” Harry cooed. “I won’t let that happen to you again. He’ll never hurt you again.”
Harry's eyes widened with panic. He spun around to look at the kitchen. "Oh! I'm so sorry, Mrs. Malfoy. I'll do it right-"
McGonagall was mad to think it was a good idea to invite students back for their eighth year. Or, perhaps she knew exactly what she was doing, especially sequestering all of them into separate dorms and common room. At least their rowdy nights wouldn’t wake up any first years or make prefects uncomfortable as they tried to tell off Dumbledore’s Army for being too loud.
"I need to do something." Harry grabbed the back of one of the dining chairs, his fingers clutching the lumber so hard that they turned white. "I need to look. I need to-"
“Okay, so you’re just magically cured now?” Harry spat. “Magic can do a lot but not that, I know that for certain.”
Harry’s heart was hammering now. “What the hell? He’s the worst offender of all of us! At least no one else brings outsiders up here, and just because you weren’t miserable on the sofa?”
Draco chuckled, one of his warm genuine laughs that made Harry smile. “I don’t mean farm land, just a nice cottage somewhere away from people; somewhere that I can just exist and not feel anyone’s disappointment or expectations breathing down my back.”
With a sigh, he stopped folding and refolding the parchment beneath his fingers. His curiosity about paper dragons had faded.
The shock of what had just happened finally began to spread off of him. Ron’s words—and Hermione’s before—finally hitting home. He pinched his eyes shut, rubbing the bridge of his nose beneath his glasses. “I know. I know. That’s why I didn’t mean to–“He stopped. His eyes opened.
Dread slipped down Harry’s throat, closing it up, and twisted in his lungs making it hard to breath. He suddenly regretted leaving Draco home alone even more. His head swiveled towards the door almost instinctually.
Draco spun around to grab the last pillow on the bed and launch it at Harry, who quickly ducked. “That’s not what I meant.”
The paperwork eventually arrived, and Healer Sow gave Harry a thorough warning to take it easy ― adding to Draco that he better make sure he kept off his feet. They both agreed, one more willingly than the other, and then were sent on their way.
“No, that’s not–“ The burning in Malfoy’s eyes pulled out more truth than Harry meant to give away. “Well, not anymore, at least.”
That had felt so strange, he told himself. He traded his index finger for his thumb and softened his touch, attempting to reenact Malfoy's actions. It didn't feel the same. Harry's heart didn't beat quite as fast as it had when it was Malfoy touching him. Harry's fingers were too coarse, too wide, too warm. He began to manufacture scenarios where he could get Malfoy to do it again. It was when he began to debate getting punched again that he realized how bizarre his train of thought had become.
"They may not know everything about wine, but Molly Weasley could outcook me any day. You should try her treacle tart. She always makes it for my birthday since she knows it's my favorite."
Draco stared at him through dark eyes. His legs felt like jelly. He wasn’t too far gone not to notice the smug smirk on Harry’s lips. “Wanker,” he mumbled.
Malfoy was standing in his doorway. He didn't look much different from the last time Harry had seen him, though there was an evident absence of blood in his hair. Maybe he was a little fuller looking but not the Malfoy that Harry hoped to see when he finally walked out.
After work, he only went home to change then picked up Indian on his way to the apartment. Like the night before, he knocked and told Malfoy the food was there before taking a share and retiring to his bench.
Harry gave a shrug. “I’m not going out to get dinner tonight so I didn’t think it was a big deal. Besides, it’s getting hotter. It feels amazing to not have all those layers on anymore. Why? Is it a problem?”
Harry rolled his eyes. “You know you actually may be able to beat me one day if you would just take one little risk.”
Ron rolled his eyes. “His father’s a tool and we all know it. Even Voldemort was happy to use him like scrap.”
Harry peeped open one eye, momentarily prepared to call bullshit on such a claim until he remembered who he was talking to. The crease in his brow told him enough. He waved his hand. “It doesn’t matter. You’re right; you don’t snore. You sleep beautifully, like a little cherub.”
That was, at least, what Harry assumed. Thankfully, Draco was a master at concealing his expressions and compartmentalizing his feelings. Nevertheless, Harry’s new ‘subtle’ affection was becoming painful. There was no longer space between them on the sofa, Harry often sitting as he did with his legs crossed and his knee overlapping Draco’s thigh. He was also very quick to help with stuff like opening jars or handing him something across the room, somehow always managing to make his touch linger. He was also pretty sure that Harry had moved closer to the center of the bed at night or maybe that was just his own subconscious action.
Harry leaned back against one of the four posters of his bed. “You really don’t think anything he’s doing is personal?”
Maybe that’s what also made it a distant dream of his though. That he could do for someone else what no one could do for him. He knew he wasn’t the only wizarding child who grew up in the muggle world without a single person around to tell him what he was. Tom Riddle, of all people, was an example.
Her original intentions faded as she looked around. Everything was so white and modern. So un-Malfoy-like. Her eyes lingered on the only door in the hall. “One bedroom?”
Ron brought his head off the door when it moved. He had his hands on either side of the doorframe; his body was slumped forward like he was tired from running and could barely maintain the position. When he looked up, Draco saw utter defeat in his eyes.
His two best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, are already inside, settled on the floor: Hermione’s sitting cross-legged, chewing on her bottom lip and fully engrossed in something on her laptop. Ron has stretched his lanky body into an approximation of a long, ginger, freckled rug.
“Severus Snape,” Harry decided, eyes tracing over the greasy black hair, sallow skin, and hooked nose, his stomach roiling as he recalled a particularly nasty and tear-stained passage in the diary. He also hoped that this man wasn’t his father.
“Exhausting,” Ginny replies with a sigh. “The guy next to me felt the need to take off both his shoes
“I’ll get you settled in,” Lily was saying brightly, gesturing for the guests to follow as she walked backwards into the open hotel lobby.
“My calves are good too! See?” He once again  shoves his socked feet in Harry’s face, pulling up the legs of his jeans to showcase his hairy calves.
the fact that he is straighter than a ruler (and madly in love with their best friend) isn’t worth the mention.
There was a growing mass of takeaway menus on Malfoy's counter though it seemed they were following Harry's old procedure of slowly ordering everything off each menu. So far, Chinese and Japanese were Malfoy's favorite, but Harry was pretty sure it was just because he liked practicing with the chopsticks. He was getting annoyingly good at it, occasionally stealing Harry's food just to smile smugly at him.
Harry stuffed his hands into his pockets. He began to look for that loose stone Ron had been messing with as he shook his head. “No, he doesn’t want to.”
Draco shook his head. “She’s my aunt,” he assessed the stability of the fence before resigning to choose a somewhat newer looking post to rest against, “I shouldn’t have been so surprised by the resemblance.” His corners of his eyes tightened, his gaze going far past the breeze strewn grazing land that he stared at. “Then again, most people have at least seen pictures of their relatives before.”
Harry appeared a little startled but also amused by this change of events. He didn’t argue as he switched places with Malfoy, even taking up being his backrest. However, despite not being of any help, he continued to lean forward as Malfoy had. Only, this seemed to be to cover up the way his fingers were fiddling at the nape of his neck.
Harry waited for Draco to respond. For a moment he wondered if he’d already fallen asleep somehow until, “Well don’t leave me on the edge of my seat.”
Draco sneered. He wriggled around, pushing away just enough to lay comfortably beside him. “You are such a child.”
He started down the street. It was a rare day of sunshine in London, and there were plenty of people out to enjoy it. Harry passed the dull sign of Allure. The club appeared open but certainly not at its peak yet, most likely getting ready for its busy Friday night.
With a low grunt of agreement, Kreacher reached out and grabbed Malfoy’s sleeve. Malfoy’s breath was pushed out of his lungs, and he stumbled when he finally found the ground beneath his feet. After a moment, he recognized the kitchen of Grimmauld. The elf began to move before he had completely caught his bearings, starting up the steps out of the basement. Malfoy hurried after.
As if summoned, two redheads stamped up the steps into house with Harry in the lead. Charlie stopped in the kitchen to dip his finger in the frosting Molly was working on, earning a swat with her wooden spoon. Bill went to the cupboards, beginning to pull out mismatched silverware and plates, likely to place at the table.
Ron crossed his arms over his chest. “Why does it matter if I know then? Unlike some people, I’m not exactly chummy with many ex-Death Eaters.”
Draco poked only one eye out from under the covers. Harry was sure that if Draco was any good at wordless, wandless magic, Ron would turn into stone. He might have even been near to making a breakthrough in his abilities if not for hearing Harry’s snort.
Harry’s chest filled with warmth he only ever felt around the Weasley family. Like the simultaneous comfort of homemade soup and a warm hug. He really was grateful to have them. “Thank you,” Harry said softly, his voice barely above a whisper.
Ron nodded though he was clearly not convinced. “Well, it’s good that the party’s this weekend then. You’ll have a good excuse not to be there.”
“You know,” Draco spoke in an even tone, trying to keep the badgers from scurrying away, “if you didn’t hold your wand in such a death grip, it may not feel so choked and blast out like that.”
For some reason, a sudden wave of relief rushed over Harry’s body. He didn’t know why, and he didn’t understand why he should be surprised. The Weasleys had always been accepting people. Of course, they wouldn’t care about such a thing. It still made him feel a bit lighter.
Harry’s furious gaze landed on Malfoy, and he took a threatening step forward. “Leave,” he thundered.
“Still a coward.” Harry eyed the boy who wore pursed lips and a raised chin, his eyes also on the scene. “That’s never been something to bother me. Everyone here thinks we’re dating, and I’m still around.”
Food once again became more important than conversation. Ron and Hermione were talking to each other, but Harry didn’t hear it. He was finishing up his toast when the prickle of a distant gaze pulled his eyes up again. It was Malfoy. He was analyzing something again. For once, Harry had a good feeling he knew what he was thinking. He was trying to tell if Harry recalled the previous night.
The eighth-years were not in a tall twisty tower like the Gryffindors or Ravenclaws, or underground like the Hufflepuffs or Slytherins. They’d been housed just off of a lesser used corridor―previous guest quarters according to Hermione. It was small and cozy, and the second floor, where all of the bedrooms were, had an open balcony over half of the common room. The fireplace was not visible from the boys’ side but Harry could see the warm glow of light floating up to the ceiling.
There was nothing inherently bad about Grimmauld Place. Others might actually be jealous of the fact that he practically fell into the ownership of a five-floor townhouse, not including the spacious basement and attic, in the middle of London with almost no added expense except for maintenance. Those people wouldn't have the same memories he had, though.
Granger frowned, her eyes dropping to the meager bags hanging from Potter’s hand. “You really can’t remember what it’s called?”
He felt Draco’s chin tremble but he gave a heavy nod nonetheless. Harry pulled him closer, catching his lips with his own. Draco kissed him back with just as much determination as Harry gave. However, Harry’s heart clenched as he felt the warm tear roll over his thumb and it took everything in him not to let his own eyes water.
She felt the urge to agree, but the tight feeling in her chest cautioned her. She frowned down at her bag, no longer seeing the documents she’d been pulling out of it to place on the dining table. “But they were fine this morning. Malfoy was a little worried about Harry, but that was all.”
Harry's eyes snapped up. He scanned Malfoy's expression, searching for any hidden anxiety. He could see the tightness in his jaw but no true uncertainty. "Are you sure?" he asked as a last attempt. They were having a nice day; he didn't want to try to push Malfoy too much.
There wasn’t a hint of a joke on Harry’s face. “So am I.” Harry brought his other hand up, cupping Draco’s whole face in both his hands. He spoke slowly, careful to enunciate each word. “I am not going anywhere.” His eyes fell down to Draco’s mouth, soft and kissable. His thumb dragged from one corner down to the center of his bottom lip. “All I want is to be with you, in every way.”
Harry balanced the cookware on one hand for a moment, quickly slip his arm around Malfoy's, before holding it normally again. Malfoy's head snapped to him. His eyes were wide and wild, and his chest was visibly moving up and down from his rapid breaths. "You're okay," Harry hummed over the rain. "I'm right here."
“Has your miraculous victory somehow given you new flying skills? The last I recall, you only ever won by the skin of your teeth.”
Harry took his hand. It continued to shudder involuntarily but his mind stilled. He looked to Harry with wide, uncertain eyes. “Are you sure you want to go?” Harry gave his hand a small squeeze. “I can tell them you’re sick. I’ll make an appearance and be back in an hour.”
His hair still mussed and practically calling out to be fixed properly, he dropped down beside Harry. It was only when the hand that was still in his own gave a squeeze that Harry finally looked away.
His memories from the night before hit him like a wave - one which sent a surge of warmth and delight through his entire body. He remembered every touch, every kiss, every caress. This moment was just as good though. To wake up not just beside Draco but to have him in his arms. To feel his warmth pressed against his body and feel no guilt.
Harry couldn’t find words. The thoughts that had just made him ache ran through his brain. Why would he look like Zabini? What part of his thoughts made him appear that scheming?
“No, no. He’s upstairs trying to clean up the bedroom. He didn’t approve of it still smelling like Buckbeak.”
A grin began to crack Harry's face open. If he didn't want the money or the recognition, was he really just doing this so Harry could tell him about his day? It would be nice to get some of this stuff off his shoulders. Telling Ron or Neville didn't help much, considering they were carrying the same load.
Hermione’s widening eyes were telling enough that Harry’s emotions were on his sleeve. She jerked around to look at the Slytherin table despite him not having sat there in several weeks. When the blond head could not be found, more panic filled her eyes. “What happened?”
"Harry, you've done all you can right now," Draco tried to coo. He took a calculated step closer, watching Harry's reactions. Harry didn't like him to be too close when he was all riled up, but he appeared too deep in thought to notice this time. "Eat, sleep. You'll be able to think better tomorrow if you do."
Harry shook his head, not even minding the swelling of his face. He’d gotten worse. “It’s just a bruise. It’ll heal on its own.” He grabbed up his bag of files, throwing it on his shoulder. “See you later.”
Draco shook his head, letting out a sigh. “If you believe so, then I won’t try to change your mind.”
Ron’s mouth fell open. His eyes darted between the two men before landing resolutely back on his boss. “You mean you knew about this, too? Am I the only one who didn’t?”
Malfoy agreed, picking out a random box and sitting down. Without a second thought, Harry broke apart a set of chopsticks. He was about to start digging in when he noticed Malfoy frowning at his hand. "What?"
Malfoys shook his head profusely. "It's not just Skeres. It's everyone. I-" He hesitated, glancing at Harry once before turning his eyes to the expanse of his apartment. "They all hate me, and they have reason to." He began to pick at his sweater again. "I'm the reason so many people are dead."
Despite what Hermione might have to say on the matter, Harry was convinced that hearts could quite literally break. His certainly did. That was the one thing he was most afraid of hearing.
Harry had had a long day. He was looking forward to just going to Malfoy's and curling up on the couch to watch TV. He silently thanked himself for cooking dinner the night before, meaning they had plenty of leftovers, and he wouldn't have to go out into muggle London to fetch dinner.
Harry didn’t respond, continuing to approach. Draco’s heart was pounding in his ears. He stepped back only to back himself into the wall. One step to the left and he could slip away into the bedroom, he knew that. However, despite his words at Grimmauld, Draco wanted this just as much as Harry. He’d been a bit surprised that the notoriously stubborn Saint Potter had actually given in with such little argument. There was a moment when Draco assumed that Harry wasn’t actually as interested as Draco was. The look in Harry’s eyes now flattened all of those doubts.
Things became a little better after that. He could at least walk around some. He had started to go out onto the balcony whenever it wasn’t raining, which was incredibly rare, but it gave him some fresh air. If he could live without Harry Potter once, he could do it again. It would just take some time to get back into his old habits.
Harry nodded. He took Draco’s hand and twined their fingers together. “What to walk home? It’s a nice day.”
Malfoy rolled over and elbowed Harry’s chest until he finally sat up again. Air gushed out of Malfoy’s clenched teeth as he sat up as well, pushing his back up against the headboard. “Really can’t handle the idea of someone ignoring you, can you?”
He didn't have a good gauge, though. He'd gone to muggle school up until he was eleven, and even if he had met a gay child, then he certainly didn't know it.
He also knew who the real stranger was. He didn’t know their name or their face but he knew them. He knew things even their closest friends didn’t, and part of him might have hoped he’d never tell them just so Draco could be the only one who knew.
Harry was only partially paying attention. His eyes kept flicking over towards Malfoy, who had taken up his usual position across the room. Harry was hoping he would look up so he could attempt to convince Malfoy to join them, but the boy’s eyes were glued to his book.
It was ridiculous. What could Malfoy really get up to in his room? It’s not as if he was going to lock him out like Zabini did.
Draco lifted his chin. “And what if I’m still secretly a Death Eater trying to get information out of you? I’m sure plenty of people assume that as well.”
"What, what is it?!" Draco said anxiously, peering out the back door. James watched helplessly as Draco, with a hand on the wand in his pocket, pestered the Muggles for more clear answers. But it wasn't Death Eaters or Prism pushers or whatever awful thing Draco thought could befall them now.
"Ye...oh James...ye poor bugger..." Harry was looking at Monty dubiously but apparently unsurprised at this reaction. "No wonder ye never wanna talk about it..." Monty's face was turning red as he laughed. "Ye sound like a madman! Potions, flyin' motorbikes, homicidal trees!"
Sirius was standing in front of him now, shoulders curled in on himself in a humble, pleading way that didn't fit the man.
"Cocoa?" Arthur called out, shoving the game board aside to make room for Munchkin. Alec was still gloating as he gathered the cards, but Arthur would soon take his revenge. The hot cocoa would be put to good use - it always made Alec sleepy. That would throw him off.
, James said, launching into it before he could rethink his strategy. If he just said it, if he just got it out there, things might click. Things would go back to how they were - no, they would get better. He and Monty would learn how to manage a confectionary shop together and he and Malfoy would be friends.
Again, the flashbacks are in no particular order, but the bunker timeline goes Danny, Denny, Lenny, Ben, and Fin.
"A real dragon?" Scorpius gasped. "But, you love dragons! His name means dragon, you know," he told their guest. "He's got dragons on his bed."
"Don't go sending my receptionist running away to the circus," Draco said as he re-entered the lobby. "The building would crumble without them."
"But that's not how it works," he said, leaning forward over his own mug of tea. "I mean, my parents are brilliant together but they don't
Harry wriggled around on his bum with barely contained glee, his legs hanging over the edge. They were so high up, it almost felt like flying! No, even better - it was the closest he'd ever managed to recreate the feeling of escaping the bunker. The sort of blissful, pure, natural euphoria that only comes about once or twice in a lifetime, and he'd somehow found it again - and
"Check out now or come back tomorrow, ma friend!" the Scotsman called, closing the cash drawer. "Got tae get dinner started fer the wee ones."
"What, Harry Potter?" Draco blinked and then explained, very slowly, "You...told me...that night at the bar.
Ron couldn't tear his gaze away from his partner. The firepoker stuck out on either side of his torso. He was slumped over in a grotesque angle, a pool of blood in the shadowed space under him. There was nothing left of his shoulder, just a glimpse of white bone and a severed arm out in the corridor.
Determined not to fly off the handle like a teenager would, Harry tried to be proactive and think of what Kim might say to him in their next session. She'd probably say he was being stupid by giving her the credit instead of recognizing that he'd learnt a thing or two about the human psyche in his life. Or she'd take all the credit and order herself a trophy.
His voice has risen with each alliteration and they see a light flicker through the syrup-swirled windows. Potter hauls him off the front porch and they duck behind a peppermint pillar, which isn't nearly large enough to properly hide them. Potter has his arms around him and he smells as delicious as the gingerbread.
"Right. And you're suggesting…" He looks around at their little room. "You're suggesting that this is our oven?" Potter swallows. Draco tracks the movement of his throat. A bead of sweat trickles around his Adam's apple, collecting in a little pool under his t-shirt collar, and he wants to lick it off those sharp collarbones.
Dad shifted in his seat, running his fingers over the grain of the table. Alec bit into the waffle and a string of syrup clung to his chin. The bite stuck in his throat and he washed it down with milk. Everything tasted like rubber. Who was it that usually made waffles, Dad or Monty?
Monty's heart dropped low into his belly as he read on. Four pages. James had been sleeping with a four page Ode to Romantic Chocolates from his blond whore. Four pages, tucked under his pillow like a little schoolgirl. And
he continued, a hollow feeling in his stomach. A thump on the ceiling over his head told him the boys were still rough housing, but he barely registered it.
Charming signed and Gibbs suddenly went watery in the eyes. When he spoke, it was choked and horrible and made Draco uncomfortable: "Ah...havin' a hard time wae the boys bein' gone. Ne'er been away from 'em. Can ye help wae that, doc?"
Draco bobbed his head and spoke with polite gratitude for the invitation. He wasn’t sure if he meant it yet. His eyes darted across each of the room’s occupants. Charlie and Molly were making attempts to smile. Ron looked as exasperated and mildly concerned as he had the last time Draco had seen him. The rest of the occupants barely hid their disdain.
Lupin had said that Lord Voldemort once tried to kill Harry Potter as an infant, even before that war picked up. Did these people think it was acceptable to leave dark lords running around, slaughtering infants? Why was it left up to teenagers to put an end to the madness?
"Oi Honda Civic, get yer caboose back here! It's ma turn tae wash up…." Monty rushed over to snatch the plates from James, steering him back to the table while he started the sink. "How're the appointments goin' then?" he asked lightly. They hadn't discussed the topic since the huge fight last month.
Denny holds him, pinned against his chest, squirming and choking and screaming and retching, and Harry doesn't end up eating in his hated loo-room that day after all.
He stored his trunk in the cupboard under the stairs because that's where it belonged. He didn't just know how to cook complex dishes, he had learned over a hot stove. He gave his boys the master bedroom, even after Monty had moved in, because he couldn't stand the thought of them sharing the smallest room, with broken furniture to boot.
He didn't give him a chance to answer, knowing James would just overcomplicate it with more imaginary nonsense.
"It's a standard disarming spell. If you put a little force into it, it can provide a decent propulsion of the target. Generally harmless but a good means of defense."
"Enough, Nott," Tony snapped, touching one hand absently to the cuffed sleeve of his robe. It was strange to see him in civilian clothes. "Your decision, Mr. Potter?"
Charming nodded, eyes flitting over to Gibbs, who was pouting much like Scorpius was prone to do when he was denied a sweet.
Monty was worried. He was a worrier. A nurturer, too. And his nurturing side was telling him to fix James. His flighty bird was restless, he thought. Lucy was a quick and easy distraction, thanks to Hermione's suggestion. But while he was certainly fond of the Madagascar Red Owl (who he insisted on calling Anne) James needed something to keep him busy. From the moment he woke up in hospital twelve years ago, James was pushing, pushing, pushing himself. To walk, to work, to be a good dad, to stretch time itself to do even more.
, but he can't be sure. He can't bring himself to ask. Draco follows the angle of his body to peer across the nest. He can nearly see the shadow of the Dark Lord, even now. He can nearly hear the roar of the Killing Curse, can nearly watch it sinking into Potter's firm chest, can nearly witness his Mum's unwavering courage as she lies to a mad man's face.
“I think it would be good for you to begin socializing on a larger scale,” Remus broached delicately. Harry rolled his eyes, not bothering to hide it. He heard Sirius finally descend the stairs behind him.
Pushing back from the counter, she turns to head back to her department, bypassing the Belrose display without a second glance. There’s a distinct lack of sway to her hips.
James idly wondered how long it would be before people told stories of a mad wizard who burned down his family's home, locked in a nightmare he couldn't distinguish from reality.
“Right,” Arthur huffs, taking over once Bellatrix is finished with her introductory spiel. “Diversity. What is diversity?”
"No," he finally croaked out. He could hear her footsteps approaching from the other side as they reached the back of the silo. He wrapped his hands around each rusted iron rail of the mounted ladder, staring up, up, up, as Kim joined him.
“Come on, don’t be shy.” He smiles benignly around the room, seeming to really enjoy himself while Bellatrix is barely managing to hold back a snarl. “Harry, my boy?”
"We've accomplished your goals," Draco explained as he referred to Charming's file. "You yourself claim that you're managing your empty nest much better now. You're using magic again and coping well enough with your nightmares without my input. We've covered self-care and you've improved on that front to the level of a basic functioning adult. Kudos." Charming scrunched his face up in that Potter-way, the one that told Draco he had said something annoying.
James swallowed and wished he could feel as happy as he thought he would when he was imagining Monty's reaction to the surprise. He thought he would soak up Monty's joy and carry it with him to Christmas, when the boys came home. Instead, it felt like a cheap consolation prize after a stupid row in which nobody won.
"NO!" a chorus of voices - Draco, Pansy, Sirius, Remus, Ron, and Hermione - shouted him down, and he trudged on grumpily. He wouldn't have agreed to the blindness spell if he'd known how far they'd be walking. Draco led him by the hand and Harry was glad to be wearing gloves today, certain that his own palms were sweating. He was nervous. This was it. This would be his
" Potter arches his back encouragingly when Draco's teeth taunt his waistband. "F-fuck!" he gasps, peeking down. Draco plucks the waistband again. It slips out from between his teeth and bottom lip to snap against the v-shape over Potter's groin. His eyes are blazing for all the right reasons now, his shirt is scrunched up in his armpits and his chest is heaving. The locked door might as well be miles away.
Instead of smashing his own head into the table, Draco patted his mouth with his napkin and excused himself. He had a letter to write.
Ron, still managing to be bleary with sleep, was giving him some sort of significant look. Ever oblivious, Harry just turned his head, prompting her to continue.
Draco watched with no small amount of petty jealousy as James played some sort of signing game with Scorpius. He wondered if his own father had refused to play with him as a child - who, with a soul, could deny a child their play? - or if Draco had simply forgotten those early memories.
familiar. If Ron or Hermione had walked into his shop without an introduction, he wouldn't have known their names, but he would have known without a doubt that
"Yeah, well," huffed Ron, then stretched in a grand, self-mocking way. "I reckon you've done enough hero work for one lifetime. Only took us a decade or so to return the favor."
, he retorted, feeling perfectly smug. Arty's green eyes nearly bugged out of his skull and, to James's surprise, he pushed his chair back and hustled from the room. Hm. Weird. Well, at least Arty wasn't smirking at him anymore. Only...he hoped he hadn't pushed him too far, he was only joking -
"We must do this more often," Scorpius said seriously as he settled the plate of biscuits back onto the table, which stood at the perfect height for his own six-year-old self to sit comfortably. "Do tell us about your travels, Mummy."
“Thank - thank.” That was what his brain decided on. Brilliant. James bit his lip to smother a grin and nodded decisively. When they moved on, they seemed to...move on.
"Thought I'd be a Hufflepuff, to be honest, but the Sorting Hat wanted me in Slytherin. Who was I to say no?" Harry felt a glimmer of pride. He had yet to tell a single lie!
. She hummed in delight at the cherry cordials. He set aside Scorpius's small tower of ridiculous candies and unwrapped the lumpy package with his name on it. He barked a laugh - of course!
"No, they had plenty." He can detect a hint of bitterness to Potter's tone, but it's the clenching jaw that gives it away. Potter has a strong, stubborn jaw. It clenches beautifully.
He wondered if he should traipse upstairs to save Arty's life now or give it another few minutes. He didn't hear anything, but that didn't mean James wasn't up there signing furiously or flinging some poor feline out the window.
…" He shudders. Potter jerks violently, still kneeling on the floor. He grasps the arm of Draco’s chair, inadvertently covering the faded design.
"Yer saying Da' killed an evil dark lord with magic?" Alec said, utterly dumbfounded. Arthur's eyes lit up like fireworks.
"You're bleeding!" he says in dismay, hands hovering over his head in uncertainty. Draco touches a finger gingerly to his forehead. It comes away wet and sticky—like the rest of him—but also red. Blood.
"Yeah?" Arthur knew exactly where he was going with this. Twin thing. He darted out into the hall, sparing a glance for the pitiful sight in the living room, before retrieving the sheet and all the spare pillows from the linen cupboard. When he returned, Alec already had their mattresses on the floor.
They arrived at the house and Harry marched - as well as he could with Scorpius clinging to his back - right up to the door, rapping sharply with his knuckles. They waited.
"Percy Weasley actually put it all into motion, if you can believe it," Hermione laughed. Harry frowned. It was only the second most ludicrous thing about this conversation, after Draco's mum. "He drafted some changes to the old regulations for hormone potions - aphrodisiacs, not gender-tuners - and the specific potion that
They took a Portkey directly to the stadium box. Ron insisted it was the safest way to travel; he insisted loudly and often. They arrived safely enough inside the box, where the others were waiting. But James was disoriented and nauseous, and he couldn't get the image of his graveyard nightmare out of his head. Green light. Figures in masks. Red eyes, pale skin...Voldemort. His cane slipped out from under him, jerking him back to reality, but Malfoy caught him before he could crash into the ground.
Apparently there was no response for that, even from a trained Mind Healer. Malfoy blinked rapidly, swallowed once, twice, three times. He was exceedingly uncomfortable and James didn’t know how to fix it.
"So's funny you should mention tha' bloke ye once knew, Mr. Lupin..." Monty went on pointedly. "Always thought maybe we'd run across someone who might recognize - "
"Yay..." he agreed simply as the hammock swung. He laughed as he caught Sirius's sparkling gaze. The faces of his family - smiling, albeit bemused - filled his space, his heart, and he slammed his eyes shut, too full of everything to take in anymore. The swing of the hammock was steady and brilliant.
They were quiet for a long moment. Hermione studied his pale face and furrowed brow. This wasn't a passing tantrum. James was angry, and grieving, and a bit lost.
Harry eagerly launched into a long series of signs, his nimble hands flying through the motions so naturally. Ron wondered if he would ever catch up, once he started learning. Because of course he would be learning how to communicate with Harry; now that he had him back, nothing would keep him from his friend.
“Could you at least transfigure a window?” Draco calls over, hoping to get back to the array of pudding. Potter’s forearm flexes beneath his fingers. The room is dry and suffocatingly hot.
"Hands-on experience, Draco. Unless you'd rather not get dirty?" Potter smirks over his shoulder while he navigates a massive log blocking their path. Perched up on the frozen moss on top of the log, straddling the wood obscenely, Potter's arse is divine. Then he swings his other leg over and drops to the far side, leaving Draco to scramble after him.
“Weasel didn’t tell you?” Draco leaned forward. He felt sure Weasley would have given James a heads up about any attack that was meant to gather information on him. No wonder he wasn’t carrying his wand on him, he couldn’t know how serious the threat was if he hadn’t known about Draco’s attack!
"Daddy, remember? I'm your daddy," the man always insists. And Harry insists on mishearing him every time.
“Welcome, Voldecorp Employees, First Shift, Group One,” Bellatrix begins in a falsely bright, slightly dead voice, “to Diversity Training. This is a mandatory three part series which each employee
Harry poked his head over the bannister of the loft that looked over the sitting room. "Who...?" Only two owls were permitted anywhere near the wards - Ron and Hermione's owl Pig, and Ginny's owl Tig. Anyone who wanted to reach Remus and Sirius these days sent their owls to their workplaces.
James waved his hands dismissively and started signing a response, but Monty looked away. He couldn't talk to James when he got like this, all wrapped up in his issues and his independence and his fucking pride, completely unwilling to give anyone a chance. This was why he hated fighting with him, it was nearly impossible to win and it only served to upset them both! When he finally looked forward again, James was back to signing slowly and gently.
"Are you afraid of cats, Mr. Charming?" Minerva asked carefully, trying to catch his eye. Alec twitched tellingly and shrugged again, avoiding her gaze.
Monty grunted. Arthur and Alec shared a knowing look. Dad wasn't keen to talk about those days, between waking up in hospital and meeting their mother, who taught yoga at the rehabilitation center. True enough, Monty coughed loudly and plowed ahead.
"Er - tha's an expression, right? 'For a spell'? Did a get it wrong?" Monty turned to Harry who smirked and nudged their shoulders together in answer. "Not much of a reader, but am sure tha's a saying."
"Poppycock." James tried again, but Draco carried on: "You split with your Muggle and your boys are feeling a reasonable amount of grief," he said. "It doesn't mean your family's broken."
"Fuck off, I've work to do." He shoved the random bits of parchment into a random folder and stood imperiously. "Always a pleasure, Zabini. You know your way out."
"This is what he took," Potter whispers. Draco's not sure he's even speaking to him anymore. He looks bewitched again. The forest is turning him barmy. "This is what he took from the world, just to stay alive… She would've been so much more."
, James retorted, annoyed. What other choice did he have at the time? He couldn’t afford bus-fare every day, there was no underground nearby, and cabs were out of the question even if they would come to their neighborhood.
"You shouldn't take someone's wand like that, we nearly gutted you," the wizard snapped as he tucked his wand into a sleeve.
Potter's hands come up, fumbling with his undershirt, running over his slick back. Draco's tongue follows a crease across his chest, just under his pecs, then down. He shifts back to taste more. Potter's hands drift into his hair again, no doubt smearing the mess of blood and sweat into a bird's nest to rival his own, the spiteful git. Draco closes the distance—his tongue drags across that sweaty, salty brown skin—his chin scratches against a promising trail of hair, the lean line of muscles under his tongue jumping, twitching, fluttering as he moves down, down, down…
Pansy is convinced that Potter has a saving-people thing, and she claims that theory is straight from Granger's horse mouth. She says that's why Potter always pairs himself up with Draco at every opportunity. Draco thinks Pansy should shut her gibbering gob and let them work in peace—or rather, in not-peace.
"Gibbs said they had a huge row about it last year when he went looking on the computer for missing persons reports," Ron went on in that same flat voice. "James told him not to bother. Gibbs assumed he was just sore about being challenged with technology and who
Malfoy's office was as sleek and neat as he was, but with a distinct magical flair that delighted Harry. He hadn't much experience with the working magical world. Remus's office at Hogwarts and the backroom of Zonko's - Sirius's domain - were about the limit of it. He'd never seen Ron and Hermione's Auror offices and wondered if they were as whimsical as this one.
“What a heartless bitch," Malfoy declared, prompting another surprised laugh from James. "Tell me about those first few months with the little goblins,” he prompted, his own lips twitching at the corners.
Monty shot Remus a mysterious look before using his own hands to reply to Harry. But then Harry spotted Alec watching from across the table, where McGonagall and Arthur were deep in conversation; Harry pulled Monty's hands down and ducked his head closer so Monty could whisper in his ear instead.
“Tell you what though, Harry’s my mate and everything, but it’s downright embarrassing to watch him pine over that posh git. He and Ginny had a thing going for a while - Harry and Ginny, I mean - but they didn’t work out. Always thought it would be cool if he was, like, my brother-in-law. And then Harry had some grand sexual awakening and pronounced his love for Cedric. Ruined a perfectly good Sunday dinner.”
"Draco," he says gruffly, pulling free of a random woman's grasp. Though he's the same height as Draco, he seems to tower over everyone. Draco steps out from behind the rack and reaches out, taking Viktor's hands in his own. As Viktor leans forward to kiss Draco's cheek, Harry steps out from behind the other side of the rack, glowering.
prescribed?" Monty grunted, not feeling particularly charitable toward her anymore. He handed over some fresh vials from James's supply.
“Ginny,” he says, his face splitting into a wide grin. He gallantly offers her an arm as they head for the employee stairwell.
Tony hesitated before stalking over to the doorway. He looked back at them as if he would say something but then he simply turned and left, muttering something about sending a letter to his mother.
They reached the steps onto the train. James blew past Ron and kept moving forward at full speed, pushing Alec and Arthur up into the carriage. He looked to either side, distinctly remembering the same narrow corridor from his own train ride to Hogwarts years ago. He pulled them to the left, limping through a crowd of students until they reached the compartment near the back.
He asks. He immediately regrets asking, because Harry doesn't lower the book, which means he wasn't even reading in the first place. Just using it as a prop between them.
It's abandoned. Frost covers every nook and cranny of the surrounding trees and roots, lending an air of death to what was once teeming with bustling, scuttling life. The ground is frozen over. Icicles are forming on the branches and Draco idly wonders if that's how the Malfoy line will expire—by an icicle dropping on the head of its young heir. How droll.
The door opened to reveal Dad leaning heavily on his cane, a sure sign of a long day. It was probably best his mobile was in Alec's desk drawer for now. He cast a blank look over the chaos of their room but didn't say anything against it. James Charming liked order -
Harry shifted Hugo onto his hip, earning a warning whimper as he hurried to point out one particular line.
It had been three-and-a-half days since James's kitchen revelation. Two nights of sleeping in the kitchen with the door locked so that no underage midnight snackers would catch on. Cushioning charms could only do so much to soften the wooden table, however, and now his back was in serious competition with his hip. He could hardly keep up with the boys that day, though he'd managed to keep them occupied in the kitchen while Monty worked the counter.
"Try some," Potter says, offering him a new sponge-cake. Draco hesitates, warily meeting Potter's straightforward gaze as he inclines his neck to take a bite. His teeth sink into the sponge and strawberry syrup floods his mouth. Then he loses sight of Potter's steady stare as his own eyes roll back in pleasure.
Draco glared at him hotly - or as hotly as one could while standing in an open field. In February. In fucking
Alec rolled his eyes at the all-too-familiar love story, moving to stand on top of his bed and raise the radio high in the air with determination. Now the voices were coming through clear as day.
Smoke pipes up out of the gingerbread chimney, spicing the frigid air with temptation. Draco's mouth is already watering when he marches forth, intent on indulging in every bit of the ridiculous cottage.
"What?" she snapped, already whipping out her wand and preparing to Apparate. "What's happened?...Arthur!" A million images flooded her brain: Alec was bleeding out, or James blew up the kitchen, or a Death Eater was holding them all hostage and only Arthur had managed to slip away -
He ignored the Inner Pessimist Voice that told him they'd been fighting for weeks - months, actually - and nobody else fought quite so often or so viciously. Ron and Hermione certainly didn't. If Dean and Seamus did, they hid it well.
Scorpius was mortified. Daddy received a gift by post that morning, one that was apparently so perfect it left him gaping, stuttering, and smiling like Scorpius had never seen before. Breakfast turned into an interrogation and Scorpius learned the gift was from Mr. Charming, the kind but quiet raggabrash who had taken them out for a Quidditch match a couple months ago.
She wanted to fix it all for him, to force the universe into alignment so everything was really was fine, so Ron was well rested and happy again. She felt useless. This was all Anthony's fault. If he weren't already dead, she'd drop him in the Forbidden Forest without a wand for what he'd done to Harry, and to Ron.
"I'll see you then," Blaise said in that low voice that wasn't his own. Draco barely had time to register the wand tip glowing before he cast,
The witch says nothing. She swings a little flap on the other side of the door, and the slat is closed.
Malfoy clicked his tongue, but didn't say anything. Harry suddenly got the feeling that he was being looked at like he was a madman who shouldn't live unsupervised.
At any rate, Harry prefers that to a homemade grave marker bearing the name Adam. So he shoves all desire for Ben to come back and tries to make his peace with Poseidon.
"Sorry!" he said, fixing his hat firmly in place by habit, then peered up through his glasses at the man. "Oh, bugger--erm, butter," he corrected quickly. Draco Malfoy looked as Malfoy-ish as ever and Harry could think of no one else who would subject an innocent child to such a name as Scorpius.
Arthur trailed off somberly as Harry's hands finally stilled. The room was silent once more and Ron felt a bit guilty for causing it. Harry obviously remembered quite a lot but without any context, without names to stick with the faces, he hadn't had a hope of piecing it all together in a way that made sense and -
He doesn't bother asking why or how mankind first discovered fire; he’s simply grateful for the heat.
"What's to become of your efforts, Draco?" Mum asked sharply, raising a delicate brow. The table descended into taut silence and Draco popped a bit of fish into his mouth to buy some time.
"You've gone through an awful lot this past quarter-hour to claim you don't actually care," Draco finished, wrestling the box away from Blaise and claiming another truffle.
"Daddy says Haz makes brooms!" Scorpius chimed in and Harry flinched at his insistence on saying 'Daddy,' but nodded. Terry looked intrigued and Harry took a chance. He always felt a bit like everyone was just humoring him about his brooms, encouraging him to have something - anything - to do. But Terry didn't know who he was.
was listed in the file, they'd long since assumed it was an attempt to keep him quiet. Harry shook his head. "So why - I mean, does it still bother you? Does it still hurt?" He brought his hand to his own throat, pressing against it in the way he'd seen Harry do sometimes. Harry ducked his head, scrunching his face.
Rachel was close to Tony, though she kept a stiff - almost steel - upper lip. Her dark hair was pulled back in a neat braid and her robes were recently pressed. She, like Tony, always made an effort to be presentable. But her eyes were sad, her voice was hoarse, and she was prone to snap at him for the silliest things.
this week." Draco raises his eyebrows meaningfully. Harry waits for more, but nothing comes. He blinks rapidly, appearing to scramble for something to say.
After a brief pause on the edge of Essex, they manifested outside of a brick house on the edge of Attleborough. At first glance, it looked forgotten. Most muggles who passed likely assumed it held no occupants. However, as  Ron and Harry walked further down the short path from the main road, some of the glamour began to fall away. The structure appeared more secure. Twisted vines climbing up the wall were well tended and not the overgrown spider webs they looked like before. Whoever was keeping them had apparently been working recently because there was a wheelbarrow with new blossoms sitting in the yard, waiting to be earthed.
They both said their goodbyes to Kreacher and started to make their way out. Harry watched Malfoy closely. It always took a moment of psyching up before Malfoy ever stepped out the door. This was no different. With a shaky breath, he pulled himself up to his full height then gave Harry a nod.
She gave Draco a chance to practice, and the determined Draco that Harry loved watching made a reappearance. As with anything else, he wanted to do it perfectly. His brow was furrowed with intense concentration. After his third time of not getting the same read that the witch had gotten, he yanked up his sleeves and tried again.
The sound of a door banging open echoed over the ruckus. “What in Merlin’s name is going on out here?” Robards stomped out of his office, already appearing stressed and disheveled.
Almost forgetting to get food in his rush to make up for the lost time, he grabbed Chinese again and headed over.
A smile started to crawl across Draco’s mouth as he stood. He walked with Harry over towards the Gryffindor table; their hands were still clasped, which Draco used to pull Harry closer and mutter. “You didn’t have to do that in front of all of them.”
“Oh, sorry for coming into my own room,” Ron replied just as bitterly. “Wouldn’t want to disturb the Ferret’s beauty sleep. You need it after all.”
“There is,” crooned Zabini, whose voice sent an instant chill through both of the standing boys. All eyes shot to the snake halfway up the stairs, which rarely deigned to leave his dorm to spend any time in the common area. He was likely on his way down to the dungeons.
I couldn’t decide whether to split this into two chapters or just keep it as one big one. A lot happens. I really just wanted to tie this story up though, and I know the amount of chapters is getting foreboding for casual readers. If you like commenting about what’s going on, feel free to comment more than once. I might push some parts of this back into the last chapter later if I decide to comeback to edit it.
All he wanted to do was see what their reaction would be to the dragon. He wished he could see their face when they opened the book. He really hoped leaving it flattened like that for so long didn’t ruin the spell work. He didn’t think it would take all day for them to see it. Considering Draco spent the whole evening in the library and never saw anyone going to the Muggle-Fiction section, he assumed they had some free period during the day which was when they were responding to him. He kept wondering if they’d seen it yet, checking his watch repeatedly and wishing the little hand would hurry up so he could talk to them again already.
Upon Malfoy’s request, Harry spent the next night at his flat as well. By the third night, he attempted to go back to Grimmauld but ended up at Malfoy’s door in the middle of the night after a particularly nasty nightmare. However, by the fourth night, he was beginning to feel like he was taking up more than a little bit of space.
“You’re a saint, ‘Mione!” was all that Harry got out as he flew past her and the unlocked Common Room door, not having to waste his time with a password.
His thoughts were becoming distorted. Instead of clean business robes, he saw tattered clothes damaged from spells gone awry and falling debris. The ministry atrium flashed in and out, the walls appearing to transform into gothic architecture, much like Hogwarts castle. Flashes of light from watches and hair clips shone in Harry’s eyes like curses and jinxes, making him cringe away.
Harry's guilt slapped him the second the words had come out. "No, no. It's okay. We'll come down and get it. I'm sorry."
“And twice you were nearly caught in the ministry headquarters ― the Battle of the Department of Mysteries and the Infiltration of the Ministry. And we all know about Godric’s Hollow.” Draco was reluctant to continue, not wanting to think about such things, but he could see it slowly clicking in Harry’s wide eyes. “He’s leaving them places he thinks you should have died.”
For the first and only time, Harry agreed. This didn’t seem like a good chat for him to join. He had assumed Draco would vanish up to their room the moment anything too intense was brought up, and he had no plan of stopping him. That would just be unnecessary pain.
“I’m surprised she didn’t mention it in her letters. She always used to...” Andromeda trailed off with a sigh and shook her head. “Things have changed. I’m surprised she’s even sending me anything, honestly.”
“What?” Harry snapped again, this time making an elderly woman jump as she exited the shop they were standing in front of.
All of Draco’s restraint fell away in an instant. “You told them!” He sprung from the bed. His pure anger flicked the light on without touching the switch or using his wand.
Draco wheeled around. His eyes were ablaze in a way that Zabini never thought possible. He looked frighteningly like Lucius. “I had the maniac living in my house! I would have died if I didn’t. My parents would have been killed! You’re really equating that to not wanting to go against the wishes of your over-controlling mother?” Draco was throwing his hands in every direction. He couldn’t sit still anymore. He was so tired of sitting still and just taking everything the world threw at him. “I protected you last year. Do you think I wouldn’t have protected you now? My family still has its fortune. Even if she disowned you, I could have helped.”
The idea of going to Hogsmeade was absolutely ludicrous. Draco knew it all the way down to his bones. There was no way he was going to go unless he was suddenly in possession of an invisibility cloak, which was unlikely.
There was a shifting sound. Harry thought he saw the handle of the door giggle, but it never opened.
Harry frowned. What was the point of secrecy? Everyone knew they were friends. Sure, most of their public conversations usually involved bickering, but no one could be under the impression that there was nothing more to them, right?
It took some effort for Harry to pull his gaze off the door and onto his friend. After a brief consideration, a smirk pulled up on his mouth.
He turned to Harry. “And clearly, you have none for me, or you wouldn’t have sent someone else to apologize for you.”
It wasn’t all that uncommon for Zabini to go to the Slytherin Common Room like Daphne; it was likely the main reason Zabini hadn’t noticed Malfoy missing at night—and the fact that he didn’t care. However, there was a noticeable quirk about it. Malfoy’s room was empty, and yet he still came here. Harry never pointed this out.
Ron eventually arrived with the food. Hermione was true to her word the whole night and never brought up Malfoy again. It didn’t mean that Harry didn’t think about him. They picked probably the worst takeaway for him. Like a heartbroken schoolgirl, he stared at the packet of chopsticks Ron refused to use ― he claimed utensils were supposed to make it easier to eat, not harder.
“That will only make it worse,” Draco’s voice croaked from neglect. “People will be left to simmer longer.”
Draco read the note several times before giving an uncharacteristic snort. How could one confuse moonseed and moonstone?
Harry glanced at the familiar Hawthorne that was poking out from beneath Malfoy’s thigh—always within arm’s reach and never unguarded. He had given it to Narcissa Malfoy after the trials while her son was still being briefed by Aurors on what his probation would entail. She had thanked him profoundly for his help in the trial, even offering to invite him over to the manor, but he’d managed to escape with the help of Minister Shacklebolt intruding to introduce him to more people he would forget later.
I don’t know why I have a thing about Harry being mildly James-like when it comes to flirting with Draco. I think it just fits well with their history of rivalry and while Harry is generally awkward and unsmooth, he is the king of sarcasm and I think most of his flirting has a sarcastic undertone to it, or that’s what he intends when he’s messing with Draco. Let me know if it feels authentic to his character or not for future reference, I just really like it.
The Head Auror glanced at Draco, asking for permission. It wouldn’t be that hard to put the pieces together now. Even a Weasley wasn’t that dense. Draco nodded. “He’s Harry’s informant,” Robards explained.
Draco admitted to his own nightmares, occasionally even taking a page out of their book and writing it down only moments after his mental monsters had yanked him from his sleep. It was hard to put the first one in the book. It made him feel naked. He was giving up information from the chaotic depths of his mind, places he, himself, was even afraid to look at.  He told them about the snake which haunted his own mind, often waiting for his guard to be down before twisting around his throat with a grip so tight that he woke up convinced that someone was actually strangling him.
Harry shrugged. "We'll apparate, and it's just my house. No one will be there besides Kreacher." He noticed how Malfoy shifted uncomfortably and quickly added, "It's completely up to you, though. Like I said, it won't take long."
He wasn’t buying that this was the whole story. That may be an awkward encounter, but it shouldn’t equate to this much fidgeting. Malfoy knew better than to try to end it there and eventually went on. “Well, he’s under this impression about us, that we’re…more…than friends.”
The old Draco sparked in his irises ― or at least the old determination he always seemed to have. He glared so hard at the door that Robards shifted uncomfortably, feeling too close to his gaze. “Can I see him now?” Draco asked in a slow, even voice.
The rest of the week followed a similar routine as well as the next. The weekends called for some changes. Ron and Hermione invited them over for dinner on Sunday and it went shockingly well. Harry had never noticed before how similar Hermione’s and Draco’s interests were. For a heart stopping moment, he thought something bad was going to happen when they got into a heated discussion about the morality of time turners but when he and Ron tried to intervene, they both received vicious looks for interrupting such a riveting debate.
They sat like that for a while. The television ran in the background, but Draco only watched Harry's reaction as he ran his fingers through his hair. He worked his fingers through most of his head, eventually ending up at his fringe, brushing it back from his forehead. He froze, his fingers still twisted in the other man's hair, as his eyes found the splintered shape etched into his skin.
She looked away from the magazines on the coffee table she’d been feigning interest in. When she saw all of the alarmed eyes on her, she raised a brow. “Please, we all see it.” She let out a short, mirthless laugh. “They were holding hands all through lunch.”
Proximity not a deterrent now, Harry’s hand moved on instinct. He smacked Malfoy’s leg. There was a startled moment from Malfoy before he retaliated by kicking Harry’s thigh. Harry couldn’t find it in himself to be annoyed; he could only smile. Malfoy matched it, and once again, Harry found himself liking the way it looked on him.
Malfoy’s eyes flicked up, as though his thoughts were finally being confirmed. Harry ignored it and went on, “I would like to know why you were gone this morning. You didn’t have to sneak out.”
It was easy enough to not care about what strangers thought about you. It was a whole other challenge to face those who called themselves your friends. Pleasant smiles and kind words were not always enough, not when you knew what it felt like for them to go sour. They were both in new territory.
He tried to be polite. He smiled and returned her greeting but his eyes moved past her. He had already spotted the other red-headed female in the room.
It wasn’t just the better sleeping that was hard to give up, though. He also liked waking up to Malfoy making them tea on the weekdays, or Harry spending the time on the weekend to make them breakfast, or watching the news together as a learning source to teach Malfoy about muggles. Above all, he would miss just having someone he always knew was around ― someone to come home to and who could easily distract him from his workday.
Harry narrowed his eyes, Malfoy’s face becoming slightly fuzzy. “Obviously. What did they teach you in Slytherin? Why would you be friends with someone you don’t like?”
Malfoy opened his mouth then closed it again. He shook his head and tugged his knees closer to his chest. “What are you doing out here, Potter?”
“Malfoy obsessed?” Harry snapped, admittedly louder than he would have preferred. Thankfully, he was fairly certain only Dean and Seamus on the couch across from them overheard. There was a faint snicker between them before they went back to their studies.
“Oh, right,” Draco crossed his legs under the covers. “Well this is how I always used to sleep and in that week you were gone I realized how much I missed it. Besides, you’re right, it has started to get a lot hotter. You don’t mind, do you?”
Ron became silent. It had been a cruel revelation during the trials. Voldemort had devised a way for Draco to actively bring about his own death, and he had to play along, or his family would die in his place. That information was what got the jury on his side.
Pansy had saved his life by sending her gift for Draco to Grimmauld with a note that instructed Harry to hand it off and give a not-so-sly prod that Harry should find something as well. He stopped off in Diagon Alley on his way home that night where he came across a small music box which was decorated in runes and a serpent like dragon twisted on the lid; when opened, a melodic tune would play accompanied by a tiny, statuette dragon which let out a puff of blue fire at the end of the song. He hadn’t been sure if it was Draco’s taste but he’d been desperate. His doubts had eradicated when Draco hugged him for nearly a full five minutes after opening it. He never explained why he liked it so much but Harry always felt proud whenever he spotted the box sitting front and center on the mantel.
Harry pulled back from their lazy kiss to admire Draco through hooded eyes. He couldn’t even fathom how he’d gotten here. Over four years ago he’d been a stumbling drunk and now he didn’t even remembered what liquor tasted like. “Thank you,” he said softly.
Draco watched as the Chosen One continued on and stamped out the door, his hand shoved in his pocket as if checking that something was still there.
"They're chopsticks," Harry explained, trying hard to swallow his laughter. "Some muggles use them to eat with." At least that answered the question of international cuisine in the wizarding world.
"No, it's too late for that. He picked his side ages ago. He housed and fed Voldemort, the man who killed hundreds, including your family."
Harry glanced over at the other bed in the room which was supposed to have Ron in it. Despite McGonagall’s adamant warnings, Ron had all but entirely moved into Hermione’s room after the first two weeks back. Her roommate was meant to be Daphne Greengrass but she rarely came up to the eighth-year common room let alone slept there, typically opting to stay with her younger sister in Slytherin. Seeing as how few Slytherins had returned, there were likely more than enough spare beds for her.
"Wine?" Malfoy spoke rather enthusiastically. He threw open the door without any other prompting and beheld the small walk-in closet of vintage wine bottles. "Did you even know this room was here, Potter?"
Draco turned his head, but Harry could only see a sliver of his eye. Draco studied him for a brief moment before turning his attention back to the tapestry. He traced the gold thread between his own portrait and his parents’ with a feather-light touch. “I love my parents,” his finger followed the ribbon with his father’s name, “but they are the ones who taught me that loving something does not mean I should allow it to hurt me. They tried to teach me arrogance, which they called pride, but what I really learned was respect. I learned what happens when you listen and follow someone who does not have respect for you in return.”
It didn’t even appear too forced when Ron nodded. In an instant, Harry’s light heart became weightless.
A few more plays passed before Harry finally felt Hermione’s gaze. He glanced up at her on the other couch behind Ron. The speculation in her eyes was easily recognizable after all these years. He raised his brows.
Draco crossed his arms with a firm pout forming on his lips. "Well, we can't come back here again, then."
Malfoy let himself be dragged up one flight of stairs before pulling them to a full stop. He ripped his arm away from Harry who almost reached for it again. It had been the only thing keeping him steady. Without it, there was a good chance he was going to turn around and hex every last one of them.
Harry had just spent the last five minutes protesting that Skeres should not be released. It soon devolved into Harry insisting that they do a thorough background check of the Public Records Department, during all of which Robards didn't look him in the eye even once. Harry was almost shaking with rage. While he respected Robards greatly, sometimes the man truly got under his skin.
Harry wandered up the stairs around three, almost four. When he got to his room he found the ferret lying in what was meant to be Ron’s bed. He supposed it had been the one that didn’t look previously slept in.
Harry watched a young couple accompanied by an older woman walk down the street. She held the man’s arm though she appeared to be in conversation with the young woman who was smiling and nodding politely. He watched them until they vanished into the small restaurant on the corner. Breakfast with the in-laws, Harry thought offhandedly.
“Mum? What’s going on?”  Mrs. Skeres stopped pushing on the door. They all looked back to find Terry inching down the stairs behind her. The furrow in his brow smoothed when he spotted who was at the door. Harry tensed, expecting him to bolt, but instead he continued down the steps. “It’s okay, Mum. I was expecting this.”
Harry’s eyes snapped to his. He frowned. He could tell Robards wasn’t talking Ron, his work partner. “What do mean by my partner’s safety?”
“Go on to lunch without me,” Harry spoke up, his eyes locked on the pack of Slytherins in front of them.
With a languid sigh, he sat back at the chunky desk at the front of the room that he’d come to recognize as his own. He decided to get a head start on finishing up some of the final exam grades. The soon he got it over with, the sooner he could enjoy his summer.
“I know!” Draco insisted sharply. His gaze snapped back, both irate and pleading, “But I want it to be on my own terms, okay?”
“Harry?” Hermione asked. She and Ron had taken a few steps past him, not at all noticing the confrontation happening right down the hall they had already passed. They watched Harry curiously.
“Pansy!” he snapped, but she only smirked at him. He deflated. She was the worst person to try to insult. She loved getting people riled up far too much, and insults were only proof she was getting under your skin. “Don’t talk like that when he wakes up,” said Draco. “I beg of you.”
Draco hallowed his cheeks. He kept his gaze centered on one speck in the granite counter as he shook his head. “No, I’m fine. Go get dressed; I’ll heat up dinner.”
Draco had been doing so well with keeping his temper in line. It drove him mad that Harry interrupted their time together to continue to do the work he'd just spent a majority of the day doing. It was worse when Kreacher popped into the flat in the middle of the night to deliver a message from the Auror Office, usually that Harry was needed at once. At the very least, these were rare events before but with whatever this case was, it was almost always one or the other each night. Harry barely got enough sleep to even function properly.
They believed in second chances. They didn’t hate just to hate. More than anything, Draco wished he could be brave enough to meet this person. Maybe, just maybe, they’d understand.
Harry was slightly heartened by Malfoy’s quizzical brows and concerned eyes. “Quidditch later,” it sounded far more like a statement than a question.
Harry’s heart was hammering. This was not the first he had heard of the pair being exceptionally close, but he couldn’t seem to make himself put words to what he felt.
Narcissa hadn’t specified what time she was coming so when she had yet to make an appearance by ten o’clock, Draco began to flutter around even more – if possible.
Draco sighed. Some poor muggle-born was likely going to be missing this come Monday. Maybe it was a good thing, it was quite terrible. They hadn’t even remembered to write their name and several of the ingredients they mentioned had been mixed up, not to mention that the historical context they’d added was flimsy at best.
“No, no,” Draco urged. “I’m certain that’s what they want.” He ignored the sharp look from Harry. “And it’s your own party; they would never let you stay for only an hour. Not that I couldn’t survive without you for that long.”
Sure enough, Ginny Weasley, Harry’s former girlfriend and Ron’s little sister, is standing in the doorway, smiling tiredly. She’s decked out head to toe in UCLA gear and carrying a giant duffel bag.
Harry felt a muscle in his jaw flex, and he unclenched his fists— he’d been digging his fingernails into his palms, he realized— and tried to take a deep, calming breath. “It wasn’t serious,” he said again. And when she looked up, eyebrows raised, he added, voice very quiet, “…To him.”
he was too tired for this), “We talked about this. You saw other people too, when you went off to uni—"
“I told you, he saved my life," Harry answered, but something in her face told him that wasn’t what she had meant.
“Malfoy. Prince Draco. Whatever,” Harry says, gesturing to where Malfoy is twirling a laughing Ginny and the photographer is faithfully documenting it.
He watches Draco’s shining blond head move through the crowd and scowls at it. He finishes his champagne to Draco faking laughs at members of Parliament; Draco smiling, showing all of his perfect white teeth; and Draco dancing with beautiful women.
Hermione keeps them honest, Ron can be counted on to take the edge off when any of them get too stressed, and Harry likes to think he keeps things interesting.
“Let’s go, Miss Granger,” Draco says, looking away from Harry like he’s nothing more than a drunk nuisance and offering Hermione his arm.
He’s been discreetly checking the labels on the champagne bottles, and the cheapest one he’s seen so far is a $200 Dom Perignon. The most expensive is the one Cho and Cedric poured together into the champagne pyramid, the Armand de Brignac 30-liter Midas that Hermione talked about, in its gigantic solid gold bottle.
hope you like it, hope you're staying safe, and (if you're able and in the US) remember to vote! leave me a comment in exchange for my eternal and undying love :)
“I just don’t like stupid blond princes messing with my friends,” is what he goes with, aware that he sounds petulant.
would be interesting. Harry watches Draco dip Ginny with surprising elegance. Stupid Draco. Stupid prince. He’s probably
Harry hides a smile at Ron’s delighted face; he knows his friend is already planning how the two of them will bond while working side by side on the campaign. “Hang on,” he says, registering what’s been said. “My mom asked both of you and not me?”
Harry took the Omnioculars back and zoomed in again, this time on the man’s wrist. Sure enough, a shiny watch glinted in the sunlight. He grinned.
“Me too!” Hermione says brightly. “I’ll admit, politics aren’t exactly my thing, but it might be a good project to work on during my gap year while I think about grad school—”
There was something hungry in them, something powerful, and it hit Harry rather unexpectedly, like a physical blow. Draco stepped forward, and Harry stumbled backwards automatically. He felt his back hit the rough bark of the palm tree, and he reached back to hold the trunk and steady himself.
Ginny and Hermione both look at him incredulously. “This weekend. Saturday. We fly out tomorrow?” Ginny prompts him. “Literally every news station has been covering this non-stop. Ring a bell? No?”
“Apparently,” Harry announces, flopping down next to Ron, who unceremoniously plops his socked feet in Harry’s lap, “‘The age of the power couple is over, and the age of the power friend group is in!’” Harry quotes mockingly, using his fingers to make air quotes. “And I guess ‘attractive, multiracial millennial friend groups’—
Draco comes back to his senses and he launches himself back off the bed, off Potter. He's overwhelmed with disgust for himself, for taking advantage of Potter's bizarre claustrophobia for the sake of getting off.
That was alright. Monty would take it to him later, after he cooled off. He knew better than to get the man worked up in an argument, after all.
medical issue. Before he could feel too silly for possibly overreacting in the fall, he launched into the tale. If anyone should have been witness to his pensieve memory, to his heroic defiance in the face of such danger, it should have been precious
"Tha' man broke yer nose?" he asked, unable to keep the growl out of his voice. What were Ron and Hermione thinking, sending James to a bloke who hexed him and cursed him and once broke his nose? Hadn't he been through
He saw that the hem of Blaise's robes was lopsided; spotted the crooked seam in the lining of his designer cravat. He noticed Blaise making more eye contact than usual, leaning a touch too far into Draco's personal space. He even caught the slip in Blaise's speech, the wide pronunciation of Charming that was more reminiscent of the working class than the esteemed, affable, and aloof Zabini family.
"Twenty five years - don't be silly, it couldn't've been more than ten. Now tell me, where are the mallowmarshes?"
"YOUR FACE IS BOTHERING ME, BEN!" Harry roars, snatching his own glasses off his nose so hard he manages to draw blood. "I'm SICK of looking at it! I'm sick of looking at this room! I'm sick of--of--"
"Meant more like a proper investment," he needled. "Marge next door is lookin' tae sell the boutique..."
"And how you insisted that I muck out the hippogriff stables every day because you're deathly afraid of them, but somehow all of them seemed to adore you? And your pockets?"
“Er - yes, very good,” Arthur says. Bellatrix is staring at Cormac with murder in her eyes as she writes
James laughed and sipped his wine. He couldn't say whether it was white or red wine, as he hadn't looked down at his glass in ages.
And so the Days of Lenny pass much like the Denny Days before, and the Danny Days of old, when this prison was fresh and new. When the concrete wasn't worn smooth with his pacing. When the cinder-block walls were still unscathed, before he scratched them all to hell.
"They're known for reacting reasonably to situations such as a man opening a compartment door on a school train - "
Alec stormed up the stairs with his brother hot on his heels. Leonard darted past and he only threw himself into the wall a little bit to avoid her. He was getting better with cats, or at least with Leo.
"Ah - yes, that bit there sort of paints you up like a damsel in distress," she admitted. "But isn't that at least a refreshing change of pace from all that savior drivel?"
James sighed and reached over his head to get another pot down. He was preparing Monty's favorite ganache for the next round of chocolates and he always made a small batch just for him.
James's heart was full and his stomach warm when they locked up that night and trudged up the stairs. He hardly noticed the pain in his hip and he wasn't nearly buzzed enough to credit the alcohol. No, he chalked it up to a near perfect night. For once. After months of stress, weeks of fighting, days of pushing each other to the edge, he felt content and at ease and his hip was granting him a pass for it.
"If my life is in danger," Draco began, "I need some information in exchange. Something I can use to protect myself from whoever this ominous 'someone else' is." Blaise hesitated and Draco took his chance. "How many?" he asked, keeping it vague. That was something he learned years ago, during the war, during the countless interrogations he witnessed. There was a lot you could get from torture, but plenty came from the right questions.
Blaise heaved a weary sigh. "I suppose your silly little Code of Ethics prevents you from cashing in on this gossip." His mouth quirked at the corner and he dropped his hand to pick idly at the arm of his chair. "Even to me, your most loyal friend."
That would surely get James to see that his world wasn't all sunshine and daisies after the war. There was plenty that was fucked up. James was always having to defend his parenting to people who thought someone else could do better, someone who was older or less mute or more mobile or entirely straight. So of course he would relate to Remus's struggle and build up an appropriate wary outlook on the Ministry and maybe start taking everything that came from magic with a grain of salt.
Of course, the next day Harry didn't come by and Ron didn't find him at Grimmauld Place. He was only curious then, not worried. The Aurors had been tailing Harry since May for his protection. He was surely fine, just not where Ron could find him.
Monty owed a new level of his excruciatingly slow-built relationship with James to that childhood trauma. He nearly adopted the tomcat himself.
Draco grasped his hand where it rested on Arthur's back. He didn't move it, simply folded his own inside and held it firmly.
"Well, well, well." Harry chuckled where he leaned against an antique well. He was clearly feeling superior despite his perpetually wrecked hair. Draco lifted his chin defiantly. "Look who finally decided to show up."
Harry patted his hair over his forehead in a way that Remus had seen so many times before. It moved something inside his chest to see it again…
Harry shook his head firmly. A spike of anger had him biting his tongue. Sirius reached out and Harry ducked away before he could do something tragic like
As much as it pained him to admit, he knew he owed so much of what he had to Monty's unending patience and support.
he nudged the man insistently as Alec began picking up the pieces dejectedly. "Still gotta customer."
Monty was laughing. Laughter did not fit in this moment at all. It was like trying to pick back up in his favorite childhood comic, The Adventures of Martin Miggs, the Mad Muggle, but accidentally flipping to the wrong page and reading ahead. It felt wrong, out of place.
“He doesn’t stock my department, so he’s not mine to punish when he needs punishing. Which is a pity, because I’m the only one who stands a chance against those big green doe eyes…”
he incanted silently as yet another ruthless flash tore through his once pristine kitchen. He thought of the little wire stag that Alec had given to him that Christmas and then suddenly Prongs himself erupted from his wand, as bright as the lightning overhead.
His eyes light up and a grin steals over his face, stretching those syrup-sticky lips and scrunching his nose. Their gazes meet again and Draco quirks a brow.
. Harry wasn't adverse to emotions, exactly, he was just tired of drowning in them at the drop of a hat....
With a hideous thunk, the penis was finally deposited onto the table and in one motion, Draco - the smooth, sticky bastard - grabbed James's hands and pulled him in for their first kiss.
He turned to Harry, who sat beside him on the antique settee. Harry settled his gaze on the Healer, looking for all the world as if
kids, and then spend some time alone because they were a lot to handle and he needed a nap. In a proper bed.
She came down a half hour later, hair done, face washed, even a bit of makeup making her appear more fresh than she felt. She found Ron leaning against the counter, phone off the hook next to him.
"That may be," Monty answered quietly, sounding strange. All three shared a mysterious look that Remus had no hope of understanding as he thought rapidly of how to recover.
James pulled a face and a tear spilled over. He swiped it away quickly and managed a quick nod, throat burning.
Harry's face screwed up in a telling way and Ron looked away. He desperately wanted to allow Harry some privacy but they needed his testimony.
Slipping and sliding, needing more contact, he clambers onto Potter's bare lap, much to his own surprise. Their legs move against each other sinfully, hair scratching against hair with little resistance. They're dripping in sweat.
Harry wasn't drinking at first, and while Ron couldn't fault him for being a miserable host on such short notice, he was glad to have dragged Tony along as a backup guard, awkward though he was in casual settings. With a proper Auror on duty, not drinking, Ron was free to bring out every Weapon of Mass Intoxication he had in his arsenal. Drinking games, frivolous challenges, whatever got Harry's competitive spirit roused enough to get those first few shots into him. And then the next few happened, and one or two after that, and eventually even the translation spell couldn't make sense of his wobbly signs.
"Right." Weasley looked chagrined and went on. "Harry and Arthur were in the kitchen when they heard Monty come in the front. Harry went to meet him in the shop, unarmed, the git. Luckily Arthur had
"Conjure a space for yourself where you feel safe," Pansy continued after some time. "The temperature is just right. Maybe there's a fire going, or maybe it's all from the sunlight streaming through the windows..."
He was still overwhelmed with pride at Arthur's good sense and more than a bit ashamed that it had come down to an eleven-year-old child to lend his assistance from behind a closed door. He kept his wand on him at all times now, in his back pocket, and thanked the forces of the universe that Arthur had remembered the story of a young Ron Weasley facing off against a troll.
Harry grunted, then sighed. "It's just… When we first met, I had my hat on, and he didn't recognize me. So, I told him - " He braced himself to keep from throwing Ron off the roof for the impending humiliation. "I told him my name was Haz Blue."
"Did ye see the Prophet?" Monty asked, rifling through the stack of discarded magic newspapers at the end of the table. He pulled out yesterday's copy and flipped it to the editorial page, where a long letter was submitted by one Marietta Edgecomb.
Looking at the damage Lucius Malfoy had caused, however, Ron wondered if house arrest would be enough.
His eyes were crossing as he tried to enter numbers into his accounting book for the day. He'd added new columns for the baked inventory and he hadn't yet gotten the hang of tracking those transactions. The numbers swirled on the page and he slammed the book closed. Sleep was tugging at him but his heart was racing. He couldn't count down the drawer, he wasn't hungry, he didn't want to see Monty. His Inner Dad Voice was telling him he was just cranky, telling him to stop whinging and take a nap, but his Inner Child Voice wanted to throw a spectacular tantrum.
No. He was not thinking of Monty now. This was different. A new, different...thing that he had with Draco. They hadn't put a label on it yet, but it was definitely...a thing.
"Where was he this time?" Scorpius tripped over his feet and crashed into Harry's chair. Harry put his hands out to steady the boy but didn't quite make contact before he was off again.
"Harry Potter had a savior complex the size of Hogwarts itself," Draco supplied. "Actually, the size of Europe." James looked sour. "Not always a bad thing." He took a breath.
"I don't like to waste food," Potter says, picking over the wide array of dessert with glee. "You never know when you might go hungry."
The moment his name came out of the wand, Daddy threw his napkin over Mr. James's hands! Scorpius was horrified - this was tea time, not a Quidditch match! - but Mr. James threw the napkin back and went on, seeming to enjoy emphasizing Daddy's name for some reason.
Tony was still missing. There were no more clues to follow and Ron was sick with fear. It was 1998 all over again.
It's tech week for Spamalot and I'm choosing to take pride in the fact that I still got a scene written each day, even if it was a rewrite of an old scene.  Thanks for your patience.  Hope you're still enjoying!  (Hope you're not hating Monty too much but also hope you're recognizing some of those squicky things about their relationship!)
This was an awful idea. What was he thinking? He should have sucked down a lemon drop earlier, he obviously hadn't been thinking clearly when he went tattling to McGonagall, he had to fix this or Harry would hate him forever -
“Staring again, are you?” Blaise asked without looking up from re-reading the article. The smirking bastard.
"You're one to talk about not getting dirty," Draco protests. "Am I to understand that our precious savior is advocat—"
Thank you for all of your comments! I read and cherish every single one of them, and any suggestions you have definitely help to inspire me! One more chapter to go. I am so excited to reveal Harry's home, which is entirely inspired by my neighbor when I was growing up. I actually drove home recently and snagged a more up-to-date photo of it for this story (the last one I took is well over ten years old). Stay tuned!!
There was a long pause; it must have felt excruciating to Monty, if his pained expression was anything to go by. But James could almost see a new light shining. If he could identify the problem, he could fight it. He could win this war. He'd like to take Monty along with him to victory, but the man would have to get on board. To get him on board, James had to give him some space tonight.
Dad was dubiously staring down at what was called a Firebolt, a broomstick that was top of the line fifteen years ago and still held a legit reputation, even among people who flew professionally. (According to Ginny Weasley, who was one of those professionals.) And wasn’t that a wild concept, flying broomsticks as a profession!
"Blood," he murmurs. "On your lip…" His mouth parts ever so slightly, that perfect jaw shifting under his grasp. Draco closes the distance, sinking his lips into Potter's.
Even Monty's foul mood couldn't cock it up. Christmas music was playing, the shop was full, the boys would be coming home in a matter of weeks, and he and Hermione had managed to hold a bumbling conversation together in sign language yesterday. Brilliant.
was the one trying to save his arse... "Those three young ones you mentioned, we don't have anything in the file matching their descriptions. Could be that they got away before the collapse, when you heard those Apparition pops. And we've got more to go on for the blond assailant so that's where we'll start looking until it's safe to use a pens - Tony, for shit's sake, stop fussing with it!" Tony dropped his hands away from his robe, clutching them together in front of him in a white-knuckle grip. "Merlin's bollocks, go home and sleep!" Ron ordered.
"You little shit!" he let slip in whispered horror, cheeks burning. Arthur snorted, sounding bizarrely like Weasley, before kicking Draco's shoe lightly and starting the game again.
Draco whirled around and looked up the stairs. "Scorpius!" His son wore a silk dressing gown over his pyjamas, tied tightly at the waist with a sharp little bow. "Go to bed."
“Sorry! I’m sorry,” he stammers. Potter leaps off the bed, his shoulders hunched up next to his ears and his shirt still stuck up into his armpits. Draco is still rock hard and even though Potter is too, he can’t think of anything more humiliating than standing here right now.
would be a good rule too. Ron shared a look with Hermione, who drew her wand as well, and they cast in unison:
"An' ye see here, nice wide open alley, rubbish down the way. You've got two bins, Mr. Charming has three." She was showing the shop to another prospective buyer, apparently not having had much luck after Monty withdrew his offer.
But sleep didn't come. He growled silently and shifted on the bed, feeling the ebb and flow of his blood as it clanged around his stiff muscles. There was no pain, after the potion, but there was no sleep either. The boys were rowdy - beyond rowdy, they were practically taking flight. Were they taking flight? Surely not...his Firebolt was locked away in his trunk downstairs.
James shook his head and smashed a finger against his temple again and again and again. His face began to crumple and he pulled his hair in frustration, curling up at the foot of the bed.
And James's wand was still abandoned in the kitchen after he was pathetic and stupid enough to be disarmed.
Ron shook his head. "Still can't believe we were so close to you that day in the cabin… Just a few hundred meters out the back door and we'd've found you ourselves with a strong
Draco simply pointed at his bald, bald head. Weasel lost the battle and burst into loud, squawky, hoarse laughter, bringing Goldstein down with him.
Monty wasn't happy. He wasn't a fine actor either so James knew he wasn't happy, which meant James was tense and ready to bark, which meant Monty was tense and ready to bite.
"Romilda Vane once tried to use a love potion on Harry," Hermione supplied. Ron relayed some orders to the Aurors in the hall and said his goodbyes before hurrying off.
"Right. Here's my card," he slipped a business card into his hands and Harry fiddled with the corners.
"Ah, the prodigal professor returns!" came Monty's voice, slightly muffled through the window of the door. A lock clicked and the door swung open. "And 'e's brought reinforcement!"
Without waiting for an answer, she clapped twice - softly, elegantly - and a full arrangement popped into place on the low table between them. Tea with cream, sugar, and a whole bevy of cakes and biscuits floating high in a towering display of house elf magic, courtesy of Grosh, their elderly but powerful house elf.
"You'll know exactly which ones are yers," Marge was saying now as she unwittingly approached the scene of James's perversion. "Or rather, which are his. Those boys've done a lovely job painting up his bins, it's a real treat!" Little did they know, they were about to happen upon a real treat.
Tony's body was collected by Forensics to be examined, documented, cleaned, and eventually transferred to the Goldstein family for burial.
. James's face softened but Monty wasn't finished. This was going to hurt. But it had to be said and done with. He was going to tear it all down and build it up right this time.
For years, that image would haunt Ron, whose fondest memories included bringing Harry home to the Burrow. Harry, his oldest and truest friend, the lad he followed into battle: slipping and writhing in a pool of blood on the floor of his parents' home. Dazed and disoriented, without even his name, but still just wanting what he'd come looking for that night, what he'd wanted his whole life.
Mum and Dad looked perfectly content, as if they were in their own kitchen. Dad bumbled through a dozen work stories at once, mixing up the names and events, trying to answer all of Harry's eager questions. Mum had that tell-tale look in her eye as she beamed over at Harry and Monty. She was right pleased to have her surrogate son back, and to find him happy and in love.
It was past lunch when he got Charming's enthusiastic reply, belatedly realized he'd forgotten to invite someone, and had to quill a letter to Blaise. On his fifth-best stationary.
The first night of Harry's disappearance was oddly calm. Ron figured his friend was staying at Grimmauld Place for the night and would return to the Burrow in the morning for breakfast, or maybe lunch. He sent an owl to check on him, but after what must have been an emotional visit, Harry apparently wasn't in the mood for a chat and the post was returned undelivered. That was alright. Sometimes Harry needed a good brood. Ron resolved to go to Grimmauld Place to snap him out of it if he hadn't visited by lunch the next day.
The Aurors were treating it as a poisoning, an attempted murder, possibly an assassination attempt given James's recent political endeavours. The words swirled around in Monty's head while James regained his color and started whinging.
James dropped the oven door as he threw himself on the tile floor, hissing when the hot door flapped down against his arm. Rachel ducked behind the island counter with him just as the room lit up, searing white light blinding them for a long moment in which time seemed to stop. Silence, as if time really had stalled, and then a horrendous, rumbling
Draco attempted to appear stoic but pink was budding on his cheeks after a brief rollercoaster of emotions. “You’re welcome.” He tried to find distraction to collect himself, watching as Harry pored himself a glass of water from the pitcher on the table. “I thought it was quite catchy.”
Hermione’s brow furrowed as she examined Harry’s face. “Yeah… Why wouldn’t we be? Ron even said it’d been pretty obvious in the dorms; it’s why he didn’t like Dean with Ginny. He knew it wouldn’t work out. That’s his story, at least. You know him.”
It was already the last few days of November when Draco entered the library on a Monday. He gave Madam Pince his usual, polite greeting which she had started to return lately, finally graduating from the curt nod that had first replaced her shushes.
A languid sigh pulled from Malfoy’s mouth. He finally lifted his head. “There are a lot of things you don’t know about, Potter.”
Harry put a hand over his mouth, but his eyes were still sparkling with mirth. He looked at Pansy. “He did do that, didn’t he?”
