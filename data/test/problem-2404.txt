“I bet he does, though. He’s a filthy Slytherin, the only one of his family that isn’t polluted by his disgusting ideas, is Aquila. She’s different in every aspect, but the rest of them shouldn’t be allowed in this school!” Keira yelled.
During the brewing, James knocked on the door and peeked inside. “Hi Draco. Could I sit in and watch?” he asked, greeting Theresa absently.
“I’m sorry, Cass, I can’t believe it. I just don’t understand how papa would have gotten a hoodie that was Harry’s. Sorry,” Scorpius said apologetically.
“Does it matter? After today we’ll never see each other in person again.”
Whithal sneered. “Family is not allowed to testify.”
Narcissa leant back slightly, leaving the stage to Lucius, who took a deep breath and sneered.
“Thank you. I love you, Malfoy.”
Comments are cool on AO3, or if you want, on Tumblr (also about any other thing you might want to talk about, because I love talking to people): i-am-and-proud
“Sure do, papa!” she called cheerfully. “Now, how about we teach those fuckers a little lesson to stop fucking with my fucking family?”
It was the only thing necessary to push Scorpius over the edge of sanity. He slammed against the ground on the spot where he had been standing, hyperventilating. When half of them were caring for Lily, and the other half for Scorpius, Albus found a moment to leave.
“I heard something about a hospital bed and racing?” Ron chuckled. “Is that the average, or …?”
In your eyes…” Here, Draco motioned for Cassie to join in.
Pansy started to say something, but Draco cut in, rather brusquely.
He was able to buy a very cliché Snitch pyjamas for Albus and a wooden flower press for Lily. When he returned at Hogwarts, he was satisfied with the amount of presents he had bought. Potter met him on the courtyard, as if he had known Draco would arrive at that exact moment.
Unless she was behind the charges. She had always wanted Scorpius for herself, and the charges being focussed on Scorpius could give her this chance. She would take custody of their eldest, and the others would become either Potter’s or his parents’s responsibility.
“Don’t get cheeky now,” the woman said, turning around. One of the others cast a spell that made Draco’s knees buckle, but he refused to get on the ground. He also refused them the satisfaction of making a sound. Pain is an emotion, he told himself. You can switch it off and ignore it. Numbness is a gift.
Draco looked at the ground between them. “Cassie –“
“One.” Potter and the students had spotted Draco with Lily on his back.
“Apparently you are not, because you are leading Professor Potter on. That’s not kind.”
Potter rolled his eyes, ceasing his conversation with Scorpius and turned to face Draco and Cassie both. “Stop it, both of you. Cassie, you’ve had enough of the cake as well and you shouldn’t try to rile up your papa like that. It isn’t kind. Malfoy, I expected better of you.”
Draco sighed. “Yes. Bullies thinking they were funny. It isn’t… harming his situation, is it?”
Draco made a perfectly executed slide at the final notes
his paranoia screamed. He managed to calm himself enough to feel a smug grin coming through, a sense of accomplishment. Cassie was still moving, whereto, he had no idea.
“I’m going for a breather. Be right back,” Draco announced cheerily, shoving his chair away and practically running to the back door.
Albus loved the Snitch pyjamas Draco had gotten for him, although Albus thought it was another one of Scorpius’s presents, since Albus and Scorpius had an inside joke about Snitch pyjamas. He smiled brightly at Draco when he heard it had been Draco’s gift, though.
Draco took the bag of groceries from Potter before sweeping his arm around. “The sea is just a couple hundred yards that way, along the treeline. The herb garden is on the other side of the house. I’ll show you when we go there to grab herbs for dinner.”
Draco sighed.
At the same time, Cassie had occupied her papa’s chair at the High Table, because she wanted to talk to Potter. McGonagall had disapproved, but when she smiled sweetly and promised that it was about an assignment she didn’t understand, McGonagall caved for her charm and allowed it.
“I had done all possible tests and some more. If there would have been something wrong with the potion, I would have known immediately. There is a reason I am the best potioneer in Wizarding Britain.”
Draco just laughed again and shook his head fondly.
Potter raised an eyebrow at Lucius’s obvious attempt at being more than polite, and nodded gratefully.
Draco agreed happily. “I would never allow that myself. And the moment I hear him causing any trouble anywhere, he won’t go there again. I promise I will make sure he won’t disrupt classes.”
How long had they already been watching them at the Lodge? How had they even come in? The wards around the Lodge could rival those around the Manor, there was no one that could get through if they hadn’t been invited.
“Or because you are the Boy-Who-Lived. Or any reason other than you being you. You know that, don’t you?”
“You see me now.”
“In a bit. But your final exams are coming up, and you need to focus on that. Malfoy would be disappointed if you failed your exams.”
“Tell me. Start at the beginning.”
And after those classes… Oh Merlin, Draco had promised McGonagall to have a little duelling demonstration, as an attractive sort of thing to motivate students in their studying.
“It is a very complex spell. Don’t you think that the counterpotion will be complex as well? It could take months, years even. Besides, we only know which components we have to counter, but we have no idea which ingredients we’ll need for that.”
“You seem happy,” Potter remarked. Draco smirked at him.
“What now, Potter?”
Also, my
“Very well. Why did you ask?” Draco relented at a certain point, where both had gotten uncomfortable with the silence during such a difficult conversation.
Draco eyed the box that indeed held many different flavours, most of which he didn’t know. While he was trying to make a decision, Potter joined him and easily picked one flavour, digging through the multitude of tea bags to reach the lowest one.
“It’s not a boy in the way you may imagine a boy.”
“Scorpius doesn’t know you?” Draco wondered. “Who spent all his free hours with you when I was held in custody? He knows more about you than about himself. He
“Then go to bed.”
Draco Malfoy took the Dark Mark when he was sixteen years old. He was accused of killing Mr. Dumbledore, the former Head Master of Hogwarts, but at his trials, he was cleared of this accusation, as his godfather, Severus Snape, finished the job Mr. Malfoy was assigned. Since his trials, Mr. Malfoy married pureblood Astoria Greengrass and had four children with her. Three years back, the year his oldest children attended Hogwarts for the first time, the announcement of their divorce came through.
“Do you bake often?” Potter asked, while throwing the dough around like he didn’t have a care in the world.
“That you are.”
The children nodded, promised to be careful and walked to the first stall, looking at some woodworking objects that were for sale there.
“Mr. Malfoy. If you’d come with me, then we can open Mr. Snape’s vault immediately.” The Minister signed for the boss Goblin to lead the way. “You may call me Kingsley, by the way. Or Shacklebolt, if you feel more comfortable with that,” he offered. “I have spoken to your mother repeatedly now. Is she well?”
“I’m stating that your robes were tightly fitted.”
As he tried explaining the workings of some simple potion to a first-year class, he couldn’t help but get distracted. He coughed to gain time and gather his thoughts so he could continue.
“I understand,” he stated simply.
“Yes, a family prophesy which I’d like to hear. Thank you.”
“You do remember how you reacted last time, don’t you?”
“Oh my sweet summer child, that wasn’t flirting,” Albus’s voice then sounded. “That was –“
“And you’re not afraid of anything that might happen?”
“Nope, nothing at all. I was just lost in thought for a moment.”
“I do. I really do. You couldn’t pretend to like me if your life depended on it,” Potter smiled.
talks. It’s
“Well… I don’t know what to think of it, but… there seems to be some kind of scar on his left forearm…?” the Healer asked, his eyes flicking to Draco’s own covered forearm.
This made Draco chuckle a bit, and he didn’t even bite back the words the Veritaserum forced him to say.
After dinner, when most of the students had left already, Potter smirked at Draco and quietly asked whether he was dressed warm enough.
A collective groan rose from their group.
Narrowing his eyes at Potter, Draco racked his brain to find the reason why Potter would know all this. “How much have my children told you?” he ended up saying.
“It’s a long story –“
He even sees his mother’s eyes flit towards him time and again. Her expression differs between concern, fear, and bravery. The last look she gives him, is clear as day. She catches his eyes and, without words, shows him that she knows. She knows why he is stalking back to the Castle, even if Draco himself doesn’t completely understand.
“Very well, thanks,” Potter mumbled, preparing the mugs and tea bags.
Hermione and Draco shared a heavy look, after which everyone pretended that they weren’t surprised and pleased to see them holding hands.
His children, even Phi, smiled indulgently and promised they wouldn’t think anything of it. Albus swore the same. He even promised to try and kill any rumours other students might make up. Draco nodded in satisfaction.
Steeling herself, Manila took her wand in her hand and nodded. “How else are you going to stop people being raised with the wrong ideas?”
James nodded. “All right then. Take the feathers off, Mr. Malfoy and pour them into the potion. I need to check the book for a second.”
While the children ran towards the river to look at the London Eye and the moving water, Potter and Draco remained standing where they were.
Draco chuckled. “I’m fine, Molly. It was … better than I feared.”
Headmistress McGonagall was the first to see them, and she greeted them with a worried frown. “Harry told me. He’s just about to tell the children. If you go up to Draco’s apartment, you’ll find them. Neville is there as well.”
“He said that the instructions on the handouts resulted in better potions, and that the Ministry was prejudiced against Slytherins, while Slytherins make the best Potions Masters. He sounded bitter when he said that.”
“But it looks like you!”
A minute later, Draco was still kneeling on the ground and humming the tunes to get the right note.
Luckily, Theresa didn’t utter a word about it, and changed to subject back to the House Secret.
“Just say it,” Albus snapped impatiently. “The couple of the SHS is young, I know. Lower than fourth year.”
Ophiuchus, who had just joined them, agreed with her and pressed himself against Scorpius’s side. “Besides, if it’s just some random sweater papa had found somewhere, he wouldn’t be Glamouring it. He would just wear it proudly around the house, unless it’s something somewhat special.”
“And the effect of the curse?”
Draco smiled faintly. If that was all, he could help his daughter.
In the hospital, he ran to the reception, with Scorpius still in his arms. “Miss, my son is unconscious. He –“
“Very well, thank you.”
journalist, are you? How pathetic,” Albus shot back.
They worked together on the potion until they had to wait for it to finish. When they sat down, Theresa peered at Draco, annoying him to no end.
“Do you like it?”
“But let me make one thing clear. Most Slytherins would never have done the things they did, if only they were treated equally.”
“Why did you tell them during the war? Wasn’t that dangerous?”
“You believe wrong. On August 14
“Papa, you can’t punish her for this. It’s the only way we could go on. Papa, you must understand!”
“Stubborn people are so incredibly annoying!” Cassie exclaimed tiredly. “I mean, I get why you would want to go your own way, but at least admit it when you’re wrong. Right?”
“Quidditch. Still a Seeker? We are in desperate need of a decent Seeker for our family matches.”
“You should come by more often, Draco. I miss you,” Narcissa said sincerely, when Draco had Side-Alonged her to the Manor.
“We want
Scorpius snorted furiously. “So everything is true? ‘
“Do not ever mention the underwear again,” Potter gnarled. Draco’s mouth quirked. “And I am not keeping your robes.”
“C’est la langue de nos ancêtres. Et c’est très élégant, non ?”
Potter’s blunt honesty made Narcissa smile. “In that case, I hereby approve of your courtship with my son.” Lucius made an aggressive movement with his hand, but Narcissa rolled her eyes. “And my darling husband has nothing to add. Does he?”
“James wanted me to say hi. He’s diligently working on something, although I have no idea what it is. He has gotten in touch with your father, did you know?”
Draco guffawed inelegantly. “What?”
“Exactly. You of all people should know that no information can be given to anyone not involved in the case.”
“Yes.”
A particularly strong hit in Draco’s stomach made him double over, but it was the unexpectedness rather than anything else that made Draco huff loudly.
“Merlin, Potter, this is
“You called him –“ James mumbled.
Phi nodded slowly.
“Get to the point, Mr. Potter,” Lucius interrupted icily. Narcissa shot him a look, before refocussing on Potter and smiling, less tight and more natural then when Potter had only just entered.
“Shut up, you know what I mean.”
Follow me on the Tumble door! i-am-and-proud
Potter nodded. “There are… I was just with Minerva, and there were… There are two Aurors in her office, Malfoy. They’re here for you.”
“Every bit of body language tells an intelligent animal, like thestrals, something about the interaction between two people. These thestrals like me, I’m their boss, their owner, their herd leader. I’m the alpha male. If I show myself to be threatened by you, they will do something about it. If I show that I’m only slightly annoyed by you, they will drop you into the mud.”
Yeah sooooo. More angst 'n shit.
Sitting up in a flash, Draco seemed to brighten. “Of course! Yes, we’ll be organising something for them.” He scurried around the room to change in presentable clothes and moved to the kitchenette. “I’ll bake a cake. Cassie, do you know where the decorations are? You and Phi can start decorating the apartment.”
“Of course, it’s always in my bag, look I have it… right…” Potter searched through his bag, slowing down and looking up at the end of his sentence.
“Is that the Muggle hoodie of mine? The one you told me about, the one you showed me? How did that get here?”
Draco immediately saw the change, and his gut feeling told him he had to be prepared. His wand was in his hand before he could even think about it.
“What?” James grumbled.
They were brewing a simple potion, since it was the first one they tried to make and Draco didn’t want to start something dangerously.
“Oh. When do you expect the letter?”
“Potter, promise me that you will always come to me when you have a nightmare. No matter what happens, no matter what kind of dream it, could you just come to me?” Draco pleaded softly. He saw Pansy and Blaise share a loaded look from the corner of his eyes, but chose to ignore it.
“Namely that an SHS also works when it’s written, as long as a complicated spell is cast over the paper and the words. The complexity of the magic
“That’s impossible, someone needs to proclaim it as an SHS, which means someone must know exactly who it is.”
“Simple? I don’t do simple.”
“This is our war song, Harry,” she then said. “Draco always used singing and all that to cheer us up, and in fourth year we choose one of those Muggle songs as our war song. You know, to keep us grounded, and a go-to song if we wanted Draco to sing. Let it go is our modern war song, when the war was over, but everybody just hated us.”
“I’m sure I don’t know who you are talking about,” Scorpius sniffed with his chin up in the air and a light smile around his lips.
“That means you don’t understand my line of thought.”
“I believe you just did, though.”
I made those mistakes, I can tell my children what to look out for. I can help them in the right direction. Those mistakes, this Mark, is what has shaped me. I learned from it. So no. I don’t want people to forget. I stand by my mistakes. I had my reasons. I had my motivations, and they were good enough for me to do what I did. If I would be in the same position now, I’m not sure whether I would do it any differently. I
, do you know it?”
awkward part.” Draco sat back down on the sofa, indicating that Potter do the same. “I saw it lying around –“ A grin spread on his face. “Pardon me,
Huffing out a laugh, Draco swallowed once more. “This is a conversation for somewhere private. I believe I was promised chocolate this morning for eating breakfast?”
“Libby will see if Master is home, sir. Please wait here.”
Hesitating for just a second and looking up at the window to see a bird sailing by, Draco nodded slowly. “I’ll give you a description. If you can guess correctly, I won’t ask more about Scorpius and you can keep your promise.”
“What’s going on?” Neville asked gently, while he sat down and Draco kept standing. Draco sent him a devastating look.
“Papa!” he heard Scorpius and Cassie. Potter had hid himself in the shadows, moving towards the children, still cautious of his surroundings and the overload of Dark magic.
he would pull out his wand and cast a spell: she was far too aware that he would never put his children in such danger.
“Thank you,” Potter mumbled. Draco’s felt himself frown. For what? Only then he saw the wand in Potter’s hands. His hawthorn wand.
“And you care?”
“Afraid I’ll see in your eyes that you love me?”
“I may not be your favourite Potter, but you certainly are my favourite Malfoy. I really admire you. Thank you,” he said sincerely. Before Draco could answer, however, James fled back to his friends and didn’t look up anymore.
“That too. We didn’t mean to… interrupt anything.”
“Draco darling!” Pansy greeted enthusiastically. Blaise followed her inside and gave Draco some exuberant kisses. Draco smiled at their predictive behaviour and poured glasses of Firewhiskey for his guests; he would stick to water for now.
Potter blanched and sat down. “Listen, Pansy, I –“
Draco only needed a split second to decide what he should do.
,” Narcissa warned.
Draco waved his wand again to turn off the lights and started his dance routine, not forgetting to look at Potter at the most explicit moves and making good use of the control he had over his body. He even walked closer to Potter, stood right in front of him while trailing a soft finger up Potter’s Adam’s apple. He smirked when he felt Potter swallow and couldn’t contain his grin at the embarrassed look after Draco hunched and opened his legs wide.
“No, you cannot. You can’t even hold up a paper without tiring. I’ll read it to you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Why?” Mr. Malfoy questioned.
He might have decided to pay the Gryffindor spawns some more attention, along with Theresia Zarnel.
“It’s not that easy.”
“It is, unfortunately. Rather ironic, isn’t it?”
“Do you think it’ll be difficult for me?”
“No, no, don’t die. Do
“I do like red, but a dark kind. Like the robes you lent me that time.”
“That’s incredible,” Draco breathed. “And how does the increased productivity influence their activity in potions they’re used in?”
Draco laughed, a kind of laugh Potter hadn’t seen from him before. It was more relaxed, way more comfortable. “Make yourself comfortable, Pothead.”
“Yes, yes. Horses are smart, don’t mess with horses. I need a shower.”
“The cookies. If those aren’t finished tonight, James will be devastated. They’re just regular vanilla cookies.”
“How do you have time for all that paperwork?”
“Good. I love you, and I hope you realise that.”
At the start of the refrain, he had Potter caged between his legs and arms around his waist, trailing one finger along his hemline and the other on his jaw. He bent backwards, tugging at his own hair before returning back to Potter and watching him with hooded eyes. He heard George whistling behind him, which made him smirk and bite his lip.
“I have to admit I have no idea how to braid.”
Potter smiled faintly. “Nothing. I’m tired, that’s all. It’s been four weeks.”
Malfoy smiled at him, but nothing else much. Harry smiled back, swallowing, but pasting another bright smile on his face. When looking around the room – in order to not have to look at Malfoy’s terrifyingly pale face and hollow eyes, although he wouldn’t admit it to himself – Harry saw a thick piece of parchment on Malfoy’s nightstand.
“I would like to testify,” Scorpius stated calmly.
“What? Oh!” James laughed surprised. “Sorry, no, it’s not something
Pansy’s gaze swooped to Draco and she tried to hide her pity behind a sympathetic mask.
Luna spots his movement and her eyes find his. Potter and Pansy turn around to see what she is looking at. The entire student body of Hogwarts are roaming this side of the courtyard, in hopes of spotting him before anyone else does.
Scorpius smiled again before nodding at Draco to go on.
“And Ophiuchus,” he said calmly, not bothering to turn around. “I don’t mind you being here. I would just appreciate you being honest about your whereabouts. So next time, tell me where you’re going and don’t lie, please.”
Frowning, Neville fiddled with one of the plants. A green flower bloomed in rapid speed, and died right after. Neville added some potion, after which the dead flower bloomed again, staying alive for a longer while, until it browned again.
“I know many instructions in your books are in fact useless. Your books are outdated and in some cases, even proven wrong. Unfortunately, the Ministry will not acknowledge new, modern Potions books to be used at Hogwarts, even though many top-of-the-class Potion Masters have written their own versions. I don’t mean to insinuate anything, but most Potion Masters have been Slytherins, and that might be a clarification.
When Draco nodded and Hermione seemed convinced that he had actually understood what she was trying to say, she went back inside. It didn’t take long for Draco to follow. He hesitated at the doorway, but seeing a tumbler of Firewhiskey without rocks standing at the coffee table, and Potter sitting curled up on the couch, convinced him.
“So you don’t think Katana May exists? It’s just a code for a name?” Harry asked, relief tinting his words.
“He lives in Hogsmeade. With a wife. And he never had nightmares,” Potter added as an afterthought.
Potter swallowed. “And now?”
“Since when are you siding with my parents? What would the Wizarding World think?”
Cassie nodded. She glanced at the parchment, almost giving in to the temptation to look, but decided not to. Papa would tell her when he was ready.
“Truth.”
“Don’t tell yourself you should be over it. You will never get over it,” Draco concluded.
She waved her wand under the desk – Draco saw her arm move and he could guess that it was an extensive locking spell – before moving outside her office, speaking in low tones with her secretary. In the meantime, Draco tried a few spells that could loosen up the threads of a locking spell, and then cast a searching charm, focussed on the name ‘Draco’, ‘Lucius’, ‘Malfoy’, ‘Narcissa’ and a few other related words, to see whether he could find any indication of documents about them.
“Yes sir,” James answered, quickly moving away to hand them out.
Draco smiled at his ice cream, taking a bite before answering. “Pretty good, I’d say. You haven’t broken any of the rules, which pleasantly surprised me.”
Uhm... sorry?
“Why am I dense? What am I overlooking?”
“Now you know how I felt when you started dancing on
“Anyway, the girl Scorpius likes is a Slytherin, a year under you and Scorp. She’s got strawberry blond hair, always up in a ponytail. She’s pretty smart, too.”
! Don’t pretend you don’t, please. I’m not stupid. You and I both know who is responsible for killing you.”
But that didn’t matter at the moment, because Minerva was finishing off her speech with the names of all Hogwarts students that had died during the Battle. Draco loved her for not neglecting to name those students with a Dark Mark, even though they had obviously been in the wrong. Draco also loved Potter for the soft squeeze he gave when Vincent’s name was said.
“Aren’t you?” Cassie pressed.
“What are you being dramatic about?” she had said.
“I’m going as well. Enjoy your day,” Potter mumbled, sounding put out. Then, he frowned and tilted his head like a confused puppy.
After dinner, Draco disappeared to his apartment to read up on some essays, before he went over to Potter’s. They shared some tea, then some Firewhiskey and then some wine. All in all, it was immensely homey.
“Like what? Start singing Christmas carols and prance around in red and green?”
“No.”
The other subject of his father’s monologue –the creepy one, Draco ignored. Except that he couldn’t ignore the worries whirling through his brain.
“I said: ‘Hello yourself’ with a smiley face,” James blushed again.
“You shouldn’t believe everything
Draco looked up at the ceiling, which showed small snowflakes falling down. “Well… First of all, she is the most dramatic. You should see her when she doesn’t get her way. And she’s quite sneaky, and sharp. She can be nasty, like, actually
“Have you ever seen any kind of sign that Mr. Malfoy might be mistreating his children?”
“Thirty seconds before the first ingredient needs to be added. Are you ready?”
And Draco couldn’t refuse, could he? It was very likely that this day, this week, was the last week he would be able to sing, and who was he to deny his children that last time? He would sing, of course he would.
Draco shrunk in on himself, scowling at Cassie who had started to laugh uncontrollably.
“As I said, you aren’t even a Hogwarts student. It’s rare enough that anyone manages to become an Animagus while still
“No. I am far too happy with my life as it is.”
Then, suddenly, Draco had a gift in his hands. Upon seeing the bucket load of chocolate, he started laughing. Scorpius scooted closer to see which flavours he had gotten and Draco popped a first piece in his mouth. “Best Christmas gift ever,” he grinned.
“DNA, isn’t it? Just like Polyjuice, you put a bit of someone’s DNA in there, like a lock of hair, and you fall in love with that DNA or start hating them,” a Ravenclaw called. Draco recognised her as a girl with whom Aquila had a longstanding rivalry, because they both wanted to be the best of their year. Aquila had assured Draco that it was all in good fun, though.
“Something like that.”
“No, of course not,” Draco stated calmly. He took a few steps forward to see his father better.
“Everyone keeps saying that, but I don’t know what it means!” Draco snapped. He immediately screwed his eyes shut, apologising softly.
“I’m taking it like I want to.”
“And I was about to lose my house and everything I owned after the war, because I had no money anymore. He loaned me millions, Harry, to ensure I could still live in the house I grew up. And Gregory…”
He didn’t buy any presents, but it did get saucy. The Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes, the joke shop of George and Ron Weasley, friends, adopted family and family-in-law of our Mr. Potter, was visited by the entire Malfoy family. There, the children were given many free items, while George Weasley laughed ‘welcome to the family!’ He also had a private moment with Mr. Malfoy, from which Mr. Malfoy reappeared a bit nervously, but very gratefully. Did George Weasley give their relationship his blessing? Has he forgiven Mr. Malfoy for his actions, because Mr. Potter loved him so?
“Well, how kind –“
Scorpius stared at the wall with their family tree on it – a new one, where every scorch mark was replaced with a picture and a name of their family members. A restored one.
“The drawer is locked. My regular potions are in the regular cupboards, but I keep a vial every potion with Neville’s ingredients here. These are the test-runs, vials that can be tested if I ever publish this research. And if anyone tries to sabotage me by adding an ingredient, the vial will blow up. I charmed them.”
“Who are they, then?”
is a werewolf, not
It continued like this until Albus groaned loudly, hitting his head against the table once. “Will you
He leant back, playing a bit with his mittens, before standing up in a rush and crushing Draco in a hug.
They grinned at each other.
When everyone was ready and Draco had grabbed his backpack, they took hold of the Portkey, just before it was activated. They landed a few metres away from the Burrow. The Weasley children immediately opened the door, causing the Potter and Malfoy children to run towards them.
And thanks for all of your love! I feel fine now, so you've helped. Yay!
Harry moved closer, inspecting the clothing with a grin. “Is this – is all of this for me?”
The man of the shop blanched. Looking around to see whether other customers were listening, he took the Prophecy Ball and placed it back in the window, after which he stayed away from Draco and his children.
The next morning, when breakfast had already started and no one expected Draco to show up, he opened the doors to the Great Hall and glided in. He wore one of his best robes, dark orange, like the colour of a rising sun, that fit so perfectly, he couldn’t gain or lose a kilogram without undoing the line of these clothes. He even wore his new shoes, which had a slight heel made of wood and clicked with every step he took.
“Now, pretend you belong here and everything will be all right. Straight back, chin up. Why don’t Potters maintain a proper posture? You are just as bad as your father and grandfather before you.”
Blaise shot up from where he was listening to the conversation and joined in. Potter merely laughed, but his smile became challenging when Draco caught his eye.
“I see most of you don’t understand what you’re supposed to do, and if I would let you continue, this entire classroom would blow up within an hour. Which we don’t want. So, let me tell you some of the basics of Potion-making. I can’t believe I actually have to explain this to fifth-years. Your former professor must have been terrible.”
“All right. If the two of you are in a courtship, don’t you think Harry should know something about you, Draco?”
Neville and Draco met in the Great Hall, not quite sure where they would go. Neville eventually suggested they went to the Great Lake. They didn’t talk much, and if they spoke, it was easy and light-hearted chatter. Neither one wanted to talk about the heavy things in this early stadium of their friendship –at the moment, it was still more like a truce than a friendship.
“They died for their beliefs, for their principles. Your godfather died, because he believed that his family was wrong, and he wanted to be different. Professor Lupin died, because he refused to let some furry problem control his life, and he wanted to do good, instead of being a murderous beast. Nymphadora Tonks died, because she knew it was the right thing to do, and she wanted a better world for her child. The Head Master died, because he knew it was the only thing he could do, to make sure the prophecy became truth. Severus died, because he had seen his mistakes and was trying to make up for them, but encountered a vicious snake on his path to righteousness. Our classmates, schoolmates, died, because they couldn’t let a madman take over their school, their second home. Not while they were still there to avoid it. And…” Here Draco hesitated, not sure whether he should continue. Potter looked at him with wide eyes, full of need for reassurance. Full of fear.
“Do you know the way through this maze? No, but I do. You can be all big bad Auror when we’re inside. I’ll need your guidance then.”
“When the child isn’t magical?”
“I don’t care about that. My sleep will be disturbed anyways; because of Cassie or because of myself. So don’t you dare worry about any of that. It’s my business.”
He didn’t notice Potter coming back into the room and sitting across from him. Draco took a deep breath and let his finger slide of the silver snake. He softly hissed. The snake started moving and unlocked the heavy lid. The box opened itself. Draco stretched his hand to take an article, but it hovered above the pile. He couldn’t do it. He couldn’t pick up an article and read it again.
“Not everyone’s down yet,” she responded absently. “I’ll put it away when the others are here too.”
Pansy grinned. “I know, I’m such a treasure. Now, don’t you have some snacks somewhere?”
And for everyone who's still wondering: YES they did almost kiss at Grimmauld Place :D
“You were Crucio’ed often, I heard. Don’t have you scars from that?”
“We, ehm. We heard voices. We wanted to surprise you.”
Cassie hummed. “It’s easy enough. We can get some kind of dangerous plant be put into the Department. When it starts breaking things, she’ll come out of her office.”
Scorpius’s laughter sounded from the kitchen. “Says the one who always shouts.”
giving you this hoodie. Your mother perhaps? She gave it to you in the first place, didn’t she?”
“I don’t care what you think.”
About one and a half hour later, they were walking up the driveway to a spacious, thatched house, surrounded by purple heather and low scrubs. The wind was whipping around their hair, salty sea air on their lips. Draco noticed that Potter couldn’t stop watching him, even though they were approaching the house.
“They told all of us.”
“Papa, I have asked the professors whether I can join their classes. There are three who don’t want me, but those courses are boring. The majority wants me to sit still and be quiet, but two professors said I could walk in and out whenever I wanted to. So everything is settled,” he told. Draco ruffled his hair Phi wasn’t in his Malfoy mood, so he wouldn’t be too vain to accept it.
After the joke shop, the five Malfoys met Ron Weasley and Mr. Potter in the Three Broomsticks Inn. The Malfoy children seemed very well acquainted with both men and did not have any scruples in talking to them. Draco Malfoy seemed tense in the beginning, but when he had been able to make Ron Weasley laugh, he relaxed considerably.
“And Matias likes it simple,” Phi cut in with a grin. Aquila blushed heavily.
Pansy’s eyes widened in shocked realisation.
Potter nodded a few times before he flung himself at Draco and pressed his nose in Draco’s neck. Draco automatically held him close.
“Why are we on the ground?” Draco asked.
Laurentia giggled. “It very much is. And I have such a good task for you. Are you excited?”
Malfoy hummed now.
“Harry, please, you too?”
“Great!” Potter exclaimed. “A Seeker’s game, tonight, you and me.”
“And so, he needs to be able to take care of someone. If we deny him that, he’ll go crazy. Him putting his foot down in helping you with every nightmare is a sign of that. But you’ll have to make a choice, Harry.” Pansy swallowed, as if the next part would be difficult. Then she raised her chin defiantly and a dangerous spark lit up her eyes.
Scorpius gestured for Draco to come closer, as the book was lying on the ground and too heavy to pick up without magic, not to mention too big to fit on Draco’s desk. Rearranging some papers around himself, Scorpius pointed at the first parchment, a list written in his handwriting.
At that moment, a frustrated cry came from upstairs, accompanied by a loud rattling and a bang that Draco recognised at accidental magic gone wrong. Draco was climbing the stairs before the others had realised that something was wrong.
“You were pushed and threatened by your parents, and Voldemort himself. You didn’t have a choice.”
Potter laughed. “Have you ever seen me? My hair doesn’t know what style is. Besides, a romantic walk means no shoes. Just walking through the water, and one of you carrying the shoes, throwing an arm around the other, walking silently or laughingly, but just… together. You know?”
Draco nodded, understanding that Potter was talking about the Animagus transformations. George then clasped his hands together.
Draco laughed and wrapped an arm around his waist. “We won’t, since we aren’t characters from some sleazy fantasy novel.”
“What is the curse?”
“I wouldn’t call him normal. He’s still worrying and breaking his head over this thing. And he normally isn’t as cuddly and clingy as he has been last week.”
Draco spun around, his robes swirling aggressively, in a way that would have made Severus proud.
Draco shrugged. “It’s fine.”
“Seriously? Who is it? Do I know them?” Potter leant forward, placing both hands on Draco’s desk.
“Please.”
“No. You see, today is the day that I’m going to start wooing you.”
A laugh burst from Scorpius.
When he arrived at Minerva’s office, he smoothed down his robes before saying the password and climbing up the stairs.
“I told them everything from the moment they were old enough to understand. I wanted them to know who I was, what I’d done, so they would be prepared for the harsh world. And it felt like I would be lying to them, pretend I was a better man than I really am, if I didn’t tell them.”
“What?” Draco cried out, coughing heavily after that and gripping his chest in a pain reflex.
“Reverted back to last names, have we?”
“Her name is Suzanne. She is so smart, she helps everyone with their homework! And she’s pretty, right? I really like talking to her, because she is very funny, but can also be serious when necessary,” he vented suddenly.
“Harry, love – don’t look at me like that! – if you wanted some proper riding clothing, you could have asked. I have some spare sets. Come on.”
“No, but I mean, with today being Memorial Day. There is bound to be some extra frustration around you. Take care.”
Before he could finish his sentence, Draco swished his wand aggressively and yelled the incantation with a scowl on his face. He let out a shuddering breath and kept the defensive position he had taken, until he heard Potter laugh from the other side of the classroom. Other students joined him.
“Oh, thanks. Is my tie there as well?”
“A day, actually.” Potter grinned and put the mugs of tea down. “I went up to the Manor and I may have demanded their approval. Mrs. Malfoy was agreeable enough –“
“Why would we?”
“So am I not male, or am I not a Malfoy?” Ophiuchus questioned innocently, having morphed his hair to his jet-black version.
“Who doesn’t?” Neville exclaimed, interrupting Draco.
“Then we’ll do it simple,” Draco chuckled. “How about an Andalusian?”
“No way, papa. You’re staying here for observation,” Scorpius sounded. His voice was soft, gentler than Draco could remember. “I don’t want you to exhaust yourself so soon after.”
“An animal.”
“A few hundred years back, Hogwarts was much bigger. Beauxbatons and Durmstrang didn’t exist yet, except as private schools with only thirty to fifty students. Hogwarts was the biggest Wizarding school in Europe, and even many Asiatic and African students came here. Every House had not only a Head of House, but also a deputy Head, a secretary and a small board. This room used to be the meeting room for the entire leading fraction of the House. The only meeting room that is still present in Hogwarts nowadays, is the Slytherin one.”
reporter?”
“Ehm… I told her once, yeah. Why?”
Potter frowned. “That’s not how it is supposed to go. There are rules for holding someone in custody. You should be better informed.”
“I’m not finished yet. It seems like I am the only who keeps his head clear. I don’t fight, I still sleep properly, I’m not angry and I don’t study my arse off. I keep normal. And that’s not really like you.”
Ron roared with laughter. “That’s an understatement,” he hiccupped. Only when Hermione laid a placating hand on his back, did he calm down somewhat.
“Not really. Bellatrix was fond of directing her Cruciatus to my back, so I have some very unnatural patterns there, but I wouldn’t call them scars.”
“I kept it from him to protect him,” Draco lied, Malfoy mask in place. It was a bit rusty, that mask, since he hadn’t had to use it in a while.
“Family May.”
“For example, if it turns out you have taught them the ways of your former affiliations, there is a pattern. If any of them are in touch with the wrong people, your fate is decided.”
“But please, respect the ‘silent’ part of that garden. We don’t want to hear a thing,” Phi added carelessly, bouncing on Aquila’s bed.
“Let me clarify. I would like to testify
winged horses? You
“Has this happened before?”
“Yes, papa! Sing and dance for us! Do one of your acts!”
“You started it!” Cassie exclaimed. The moment she noticed that she had broken out of her role, she collapsed against Draco’s chest and started laughing. Draco just rolled his eyes and held her close.
“No problem. Will you tell me what was really going on, or are we going to keep pretending it was your arm?”
Ron threw powder in the Floo and yelled their destination.
Draco smiled. “I know. I am about ninety-nine percent sure that Scorp sent you for this exact reason.”
Draco felt Potter’s eyes on his back until he turned a corner, where he finally allowed himself to start panicking.
“Thank you!” Aquila threw her arms around his neck and smacked a kiss on his cheek.
“Are we? In what way?” Albus sneered.
“Hiya, Pans,” Draco laughed. “Long time no see.”
“All right, give me some chocolate and we’ll talk,” Draco then demanded, reaching for the bar already.
Draco took her hand. “Cass. I need you to focus now. I’m going to Apparate to an alley behind the Ministry. I’ve been there before. Only bad people know how to get in and out of that alley, all right? I want you to have your wand ready for defense. I’ll drop you next to a door, but you won’t be able to see it. Feel along the wall until you feel a doorknob. I’ll make sure you are as close to it as possible. Open it, turn right and walk along. You’ll find yourself in an empty office. You have to go to the ninth floor, but you cannot use the lift. In the office, there’s a carpet, underneath with you’ll see a hatch. There’s a staircase moving to the ninth floor, and you’ll end up in another small space. Wait there until I call you. Do not light your wand with magic. Do you have any questions?”
Draco scoffed. “
“Mr. Malfoy, I hate to tell you at this moment, but it needs to be done. When Severus Snape died, he had written a will. Many of his Potions ingredients and items will go to Hogwarts, but he has given you some of it as well. Is there a place we can send it to?”
“And when I first heard about this case, I was told that they were charging you for unidentified charges in your time as Death Eater. Some murders or something. I volunteered to guard the conversations, so I could finally see the very reason I wanted to fight against crime. I was so sure you were guilty. I
“Today is the day for apologies?” he then asked.
“That looks like a good piece of gossip,” Potter remarked. “Do you know that girl? Isn’t she in Cassie’s year?”
Draco feels a chill run up his spine. ‘The future begins today. Does she mean this for everyone, or just for her beloved Gryffindors? How can Slytherins ever be forgiven for what they did? How can Pansy… Pansy!’
Some Gryffindors, who have been staring at Potter and him for what feels like an hour now, come in action. The female Weasel, no, Ginny, starts telling other Gryffindors something. It results in a group of students trying to shoo the others inside.
The woman smirked. “Lucky we have his daughters, then. How about a deal, Draco?” When Draco didn’t answer, merely screamed into the privacy of his own mind – but how private was that, still? – the woman continued. “You drop your Occlumency walls, and we don’t hurt your children. How does that sound?”
Potter finally turned to face him, with a desperate look on his face. “I
Around tea time, Draco was able to get his four children together, because they were all in the Great Hall, studying. When he told them they were going to celebrate Christmas at the Potter’s, all four of them responded with equal enthusiasm.
The chairman of the Wizengamot gestured to the scribe, who started to explain how the rest of the trial was going to be. The audience was now allowed to speak. There was a dozen that came to the stand and began to tell Draco how much they hated him, and how he had ruined their lives. After those few angry people had gotten their say, the noise and yells mellowed down. The chairman shortly explained how the Wizengamot was going to vote, and then called for everyone to raise their hand if they thought Draco was guilty.
“So what do the results say?”
“Yes. It may be an unpopular opinion, but the pureblood raising does give one great experience in gaining positive publicity.”
Potter looked at his plate and bit his lip in hesitation. “I don’t know whether I’m supposed to say. It was some kind of a secret. Albus told James, who told me.”
“No.”
“No. Of course they lost their brother, their son as well, but not in the way you felt it. They can’t expect you to deal with it the same way as they do. Every time you look in the mirror, you see yourself, instead of Fred next to you. You are allowed to grieve, to mourn, every second of the day. You are allowed to carry that pain on the surface until you die.”
Potter saw that it was rather small for two grown men, but he wasn’t about to dispute it. He knew well enough that a sofa can’t be transfigured into a king-sized bed. He sat on the edge of the bed, not knowing what to do, until Draco walked in, wearing a soft, blue pair of joggers and a t-shirt that appeared far too fancy to be a pyjama shirt.
“Aren’t you exaggerating now?”
“Well, magic is a personal thing. Why do you think everyone has a different wand? Why do you think not everyone is as good at Charms or Potions?”
Pansy lets go, shoots a look at Potter and steps backwards. After one more smile, she returns to the Slytherins. Perhaps she doesn’t hate him.
are me. We can’t be separated. Never.”
“I don’t know about you, but I actually raised my children to not come to premature conclusions. I taught them that whatever mistake I made, it had nothing to do with them, and never to assume children are exactly like their parents. I hope they treat others this way, as well as themselves.”
That was a lie. Draco knew Potter liked pumpkin juice, so of course he put pumpkin in it.
None of them seemed to mind that they had to share the gifts. The adult Weasleys all crammed together to take a look at the games, seemingly just as interested as the children.
Cassie’s words stung, but the way she only pressed closer and clenched her fists in Draco’s shirt and hair was enough for Draco to forgive her instantly and wrap his arm around her even tighter. He laid her head on his chest, which Cassie took as an invite to crawl almost on top of him in an effort to be even closer.
Potter fell silent, tension fled his body. He looked at Draco, who tilted up a corner of his mouth.
,” Potter grinned.
Draco turned around to watch his son and observe his body language. He was tempted to believe Scorpius, and everything indicated that he was being honest. Strategically keeping silent, Draco was trying to manipulate Scorpius into saying something more.
“Apart from that.”
“Magic,” Potter grinned. “Just a few charms and spells thrown over the telly and the area where it’s standing.” He indicated that Draco should be quiet and stared intently at the videos of people at Heathrow Airport hugging each other. All Potters whooped when the first ‘actually’ was said.
“I wanted to make this clear much earlier than now. I’m sorry for not telling you before.”
“No further questions. I would like to call forward my last witness, Auror Samuel Smiths.”
Worrying and wringing his hands together, he felt a rough, waxy something wrapping around his wrist. When he looked down, he saw a twine of the Whomping Willow holding onto him, with Cassie smiling softly down at it.
Without looking up again, he moved to his bedroom and started changing in his pyjamas. Right before he waved the lights off, Phi walked in and climbed in bed with Draco.
“It did. It went very well. I would tell you about it, but it’s far too long a story and I doubt you’d think it’s interesting. So for both our sakes, I’ll keep quiet,” Draco said, raising his eyebrow.
“That is where we come in!” Phi exclaimed. “He won’t take initiative, but he will accept our help. When he is ready,” he added with more emphasis. “Right now, however, he won’t. He will think we are meddling in his business and he’ll get angry. We should wait, at least until papa is more comfortable with his own feelings. You know how he gets when other people push him into admitting what he feels. He hates that! Let him take his own time!”
Draco scoffed, shaking his head again. “Yes, Potter, it’s really good.”
“I don’t know, it’s a gut feeling. And last time I ignored a gut feeling, I was hit by a curse that almost killed me.”

“They’ve never been bad to me.”
“You are supposed to be on my side, ‘Quila!”
“Harry, you were never expelled either. So it’s not fair to expel them for this kind of bullying. It doesn’t add up.”
After a few moments, he returned to the living room with a cup of tea –just how Potter liked it- and a slice of treacle tart. Potter thanked him and discreetly sniffed at the tart. When he caught Draco’s eye, he seemed surprised.
“Scorpius, listen to me. You’ve got to stay awake, all right? Can you do that for me?”
He was cut off by a surprised yelp of Aquila. She was pursing her lips again, eyes wide, muscles tensed. Draco’s face was drawn together in pain of having to see his daughter subjected to the Cruciatus Curse, again.
“I could ask the same to you, barging into the classroom and interrupting me,” Potter responded dryly.
“Scorpius, behave,” Draco murmured, which only got Phi to start laughing uncontrollably. Scorpius got a pained expression on his face, presumably from laughing so hard. Draco had a hard time suppressing his laughter as well, and the corners of his mouth kept quirking up and down.
“And Fred,” he whispered, voice hoarse. “I’m sorry. I am so, so sorry. I never wanted any of that, I never wanted anyone like that to die. I may have disliked the Weasley family, but I didn’t want them to die. I didn’t want Arthur to die when Tom attacked him, and I didn’t want Fred to die. I cried when I heard it. Fred and George were those kind of beacons in dark times, like with Umbridge. They managed to make everyone smile, they were able to make life just that bit better with their jokes and pranks. I am so proud of George to continue his shop, and I am so glad that Ron has decided to help him, but Fred’s absence always hurts to think of, when I walk into that shop. It’s why I don’t come there very often. Can you ever forgive me, Potter? For the things I’ve done, or haven’t done?”
“I do. Now, can I escort you back to your cell?”
, 1998. Phalanx was born in 1959, Shania 1960, both in Devonshire. Rissa was born in Truro, Cornwall.”
“He doesn’t have to know until it’s the end. That’ll be soon enough.”
“Two!” Scorpius grinned. Aquila resumed her eating.
“That, Mr. Malfoy-Potter, is confidential. My

Theresa shook her head in disbelief. “She has been pining for years. Poor Suzanne, she must think you were just playing with her!”
Seeing that James was about to think he wrote an abysmal essay, Draco deliberately caught his eye and smiled slightly. He handed over the pile of parchment, but didn’t let go of it when James reached out to receive it.
“We’ll see when the time gets there.”
When they saw Laurentia, Alissa and the two guards on the ground, incapacitated, and the others unharmed, they relaxed their stances.
“A cup of tea for me, please. And he’ll have the same.”
And we had a bit of unveiling secrets from the SHS. Who do you think is the SHS couple? And who is writing those notes? Tell me what you think!

Just before curfew, Pansy dared Draco to sing ‘
“That’s a sweet metaphor.”
“Astoria, I can assure you that Potter and I are not in a relationship,” he stated firmly. They let go of hands. At Draco’s words, Astoria turned sharp.
Laughing, Potter shrugged, conceding to Draco’s point. “Your dislikes were also mentioned. The don’ts of Draco Malfoy.”
Potter snatched it away from him, receiving a dark look. “No. We’re doing it the other way around. You talk and I give you chocolate if I’m satisfied.”
“Let me be clear. I would like to testify
Draco snorted. “Yes, all right. Has Potter told all of you then?”
“That’s easy for you to say. But you do realise that you are incredibly stubborn as well, don’t you?”
With this chapter, I hit the 50,000 mark AND the 100 pages mark (that usually goes together, but I don't care). WHOOHOO. Are you proud of me? Please tell me you are proud of me. I am proud of me. I never thought this story would be so long, and we're not even halfway.
Sounds start to resonate within the walls. People started to chatter, yell, cry, scream. Potter looks at him, and he looks at Potter. A voice cuts through all.
“Oh let me!” Cassie demanded impatiently. She grabbed the Ball and asked, “Which Chocolate Frog cards are the most uncommon?”
He sat down, smiling at Potter until Scorpius cleared his throat in an obnoxious attempt to get the attention.
“So you’re sure that your papa isn’t very angry with me anymore?” he asked, frowning.
“All right. So what do we want Papa to do?” Scorpius asked. “What’s the highest priority at this point?”
“Cyclamen stand for fearful hope, camomile strength when things don’t go well.”
Draco just smiled and nodded, urging Phi to keep eating his breakfast. It was silent for a few moments, until Phi exclaimed victoriously: “I’ve got it!”
Potter turned around and moved to the door.
Potter smiled. “So how is it different from regular Wolfsbane?”
None of these talks and plans were heard or detected by other students, nor teachers.
“Then why don’t you have your essay? Enlighten me, please, Mr. Potter.”
Harry’s finger curled themselves into Draco’s hair, twirling them around. “For now, we’re going to drink Firewhiskey and sing High School Musical until we fall asleep. Tomorrow, we’ll figure something out.”
“You seem to know a lot about them.”
“Yes. My horses belong to the best of the world. Beaux-Batons uses my Abraxans exclusively, since Madame Olympe Maxime passed away. The top five of fastest Granians are of my breeding. Even Laurentia Fletwock, the famous horse racer, has admitted that her breedings cannot compete with mine. The Aethonans are used by Ministry workers for official overseas trips to the continent. Hogwarts is my main client for the thestrals. They are extremely well-trained, as you can see. No danger at all, are you, Peanut?”
James frowned. “Draco isn’t the kind of person that swoons when he sees Dad.”
While Draco gathered a coat, a bar of chocolate –which he thought Potter didn’t notice- and identification papers, Potter worked on suppressing his grin. A grin wasn’t the proper expression for going to the hospital, especially not when going to visit the unconscious son of a guy he really likes. But the knowledge that Draco liked

, the duel. The potion in that letter of yours, which made you so angry during the battle, isn’t widely available or easy to brew. Scorpius being beaten, Lazarus, Terence and Priscus. Theresa. Phi having such difficulty with his Animagus magic. Now that I think of it, Phi being an Animagus is strange anyways. We have an explanation now, but it’s still highly unlikely.”
“Because my father thought you were a dark wizard, and he wanted me to befriend you. So that was the first task I got, and the first task I failed to do.”
“Not at all. I should get out today as well. It’s such lovely weather.”
I am so so sorry for taking so long. Some people said I was being distant and absent, and they forbid me to keep writing. I had to write in secret...
“Is this
“Him not going, my association with the Weasleys and our history with Riddle,” Draco summarised easily. Landing in front of the gates of the Lodge, Draco placed his hand over his mother’s that was resting on his arm. His mother remained quiet but gave him a sharp, warning glance. Draco responded with a mere nod.
They moved from the small gallery to the library, but didn’t stay there for long. The moment they got back into the dining room, where everyone was already seated, Phi and Aquila shot up. Phi flung himself at Lucius, who caught him so easily that everyone seemed surprised. Lucius very wisely pretended that nothing was wrong and sat down at the head of the table, with Phi in his lap.
Draco slightly bit his tongue to fight the words, but he knew what was coming and refused to be ashamed of it. “I prefer men,” he murmured.
“Still, papa shouldn’t have reacted this way. He said some horrible things.”
Groaning, Draco took another bite of his chocolate and handed Potter his mug to be refilled. “They are the epitome of disgusting, sappy couples that are impossible to hate because their love is so
We’ll show them together,
The thought flits through his mind, and without hesitating, he knows the answer. Yes. Yes, she knew. And now, Draco knows too. And his father perhaps. His father doesn’t matter anymore. And his mother seemed to accept the idea.
“Malfoy, don’t ignore me. I need your help,” Potter tried then. Draco still didn’t respond. He sent a smile in the direction of the Slytherin table, where all students were excitedly talking with each other, like they had been doing ever since lunch. Honestly, Potter hadn’t been able to get the Slytherins to work, because they had been too busy with something else.
He hissed at the silver snake, and the lid opened. On top of the pile was the article his father had almost found him with. He ignored it and dug down deeper. His fingers found a picture of the baby Harry Potter and his parents. Tugging on his mother’s hair, Harry Potter looked focused and determined. Focused on the strands between his chubby hands, determined to find out what it was. If this was Harry Potter, one should not make him angry. The boy must be taken into account. Draco was sure of it. If one had Harry Potter on one’s side, one would be safe. Protected. Valued. One would be able to do anything. One would be free.
“I know he doesn’t have a crush anymore on Theresa Zarnel. Am I correct?”
Potter grinned, watching the room unfold –quite literally- and all kinds of musical instruments become tangible.
A burst of colourful magic preceded Aquila’s arrival. The magic manifested in fairy lights hanging from the ceiling, bathing the living room in cosy colours. When Potter walked in with the completely finished turban, he smiled at the lights and waved the main lamps off, making the fairy lights and the tree lights the only illumination.
“Is this the story that Pansy and Blaise were never allowed to tell us because you couldn’t handle it?”
Potter merely clenched his fists.
“Yes?”
In the silence that followed, everyone was doing their best to not look at Phi, who had hunched together and bit his lip.
Potter chuckled. “I noticed, that day of the duel. She knows exactly when to pull out the big guns, doesn’t she?”
Silence.
Hence, dinner was quiet at the High Table, mostly because Draco and Potter were sending off such awkward vibes that all other teachers did not dare talking to either one of them.
“I said. The only thing you should be sorry for, is your lack of trust.”
This resulted in a loud bark of laughter. The murmurings in the Great Hall silenced a bit, but picked up soon enough. Draco heard one very familiar laugh ring through the buzz of the talk, so he sent a glance in Aquila’s direction.
“I don’t want to be friends because Scorpius set it up.”
“I don’t know. Perhaps because you like
“Like in the dream I had when you were in custody,” Cassie whispered.
“No need to help, I’ll clean them later. For now, maybe it’s better if you join your siblings. Is that all right?” Draco asked, making sure that Phi knew it wasn’t a punishment.
“Bullshit. Tell us the real reason.”
“Only if he has someone in bed with him. A warm body means that everyone is alive. Aquila once told us that that’s why they usually climb in bed with him at home,” Blaise said when Draco didn’t answer.
“Definitely. Not the kind of company I’d enjoy.”
“Yes, yes, that’s fine. He would love that, I’m sure. If he causes any trouble, let me know. He can be rather… cheeky, to say the least.”
Well. That's been four weeks without good reason. Sorry! Ugh man, this was really bad. I'll try to do better next time!
“First of all, Potter, thank you for admitting that you were pestering me. Second, just know to never snoop in my belonging, if I tell you not to. If I would have wanted you to know, I would have told you. Seems clear to me. Thirdly, of course you think I am to blame. When have you ever thought it was not me? Furthermore, don’t talk about my collection ever again. And what exactly did you think when you wrote that little note? You knew Pansy and Blaise would read it, do you have any idea what kind of foul tricks they have pulled to get me to tell them? I am only waiting for the Veritaserum. In addition to that, no. You won’t pick me up from this office. Do you really think I am going to wear this on a date? The fact that you have no style, doesn’t mean that I have to lower my standards.”
“If that’s your response, you probably have the right one in mind,” Draco answered dryly.
“They have. They skipped classes and slacked in doing their work. The other professors thought they were visiting you or anything. Except for Flitwick. They asked for his help in reaching the right notes.”
“Yes, I am. My type though, I can’t be sure. It’s not like I’ve done extensive research. But a sense of family is always very welcome. And ehm, yeah, well, the girls I’ve, well, sort of, ‘liked’, they were all, kind of, you know, athletic? So I think, yeah, that might be, like, my type. A bit spiky. You know?”
“Maybe when we were younger,” Potter protested. “But not anymore, I bet.”
Minerva stepped closer to hold Draco’s wand arm still. “You may be overreacting, Draco. You can’t speak Parseltongue either, you can’t open it, if indeed this is the Chamber of Secrets. Can’t you talk to us, tell us your suspicions? There is no hurry?”
“You’ll survive until desert.”
“Why, though?” Draco asked suddenly.
And just now, he had wanted to stay on the right side, and fight his parents, if necessary. He had wanted to fight side by side with Potter. Would he really be able to fight his family, if that would mean being on the good side for once in his life? ‘Yes. Yes, you would. Because it’s Potter’s side.’
Potter seemed to mull these words over in his head. When he looked up, Cassie was smiling at him expectantly.
“With what?”
“I don’t care, Potter. I want my cake.”
Draco sighed. “The effect of the curse is that the body part you cherish most, will slowly degrade in functionality, until it doesn’t work anymore. The most torturous part is that it happens slowly. In my case, I will get worse and worse, and one after the other, my body parts will stop working, starting with my hands and feet. At a certain point, I will be so tired that I can only lie here and listen to things, until my heart is beating so slow that the blood flow as ceased, and I will die.”
“You’re dying, aren’t you?”
Some stilted conversation followed between them, until Draco broke the polite bubble they had been in, and looked Hermione straight in the eye.
“No to all of those things. It’s complicated. You have to listen carefully.”
“My first question is, what’s up? With the trials and now this attack, someone must have a target on your back. What’s going on?” Pansy started.
Draco scoffed, ignoring Cassie and Lily’s giggles. “Because you can’t keep secrets from Hermione, that’s why.”
The Malfoy children had given him a book, of which the cover read:
Harry looked at the children, who all seemed in a much better mood after Draco’s message. Scorpius was even nibbling from his breakfast. “Yeah, that’s okay. We’ll be in the library.”
“Pansy,” Draco’s voice sounded weakly. He was stood in the door opening, heavily leaning against the door post. His hands were shaking, only just preventing the wine to spill over. Potter rose quickly, taking the glasses and handing them to Pansy and Blaise, after which he went to the kitchen to get the tea for him and Draco.
“Are you saying you like a replacement better than your own papa?” Albus laughed. Draco poked Aquila in the side.
realistic? Potter, what am I supposed to
“Why did you get a divorce?”
Draco nodded, giving Neville a light slap on the shoulder to thank him, as Cassie was already heaving the plant outside.
He is close. The Dark Lord is standing only a few metres away. If Potter would fire a spell, and his aim would be wrong, Draco could be killed.
“Perhaps, though it won’t be solved with one meeting only. It’s going to take time, Potter.”
you fall? You never fall. Your wandless magic is good enough to catch yourself when you trip.”
Breakfast was awful. It had been fine, until the Owl Post arrived and everyone received their
to meet the Boy-Who-Lived, but they knew he was eager to meet him. He tried to tamp down his nerves. A Malfoy was not nervous to meet someone. Others were nervous to meet a Malfoy. But those non-existent nerves were really playing up now. Deep breaths. The boy will never have to know how much you admire him. And always have admired him.
“Scorpius and Dominique are awful together, in their pragmatic mischievousness. And no one knows what they’re talking about, because they’ve created their own language, combining French and English and German!
“Yeah, I –“
“That’s not kind,” Potter remarked. “Especially since I was going to invite you for a couple of drinks with the other professors.”
Potter threw a look over his shoulder, seeing Albus and Scorpius laughing behind their hands. “Come on, we should join them again. Wouldn’t want to lose one of them, would we?”
Pansy sat up straighter and frowned harder. Potter bit his lip and frowned. Blaise giggled, but frowned after that.
When Potter only shushed him, grinning widely, Draco enveloped him in a tight hug. He pulled away after a few seconds, but didn’t let go of Potter’s hand.
“If you like to keep saying random things in French to me, I won’t stop you. I rather like it myself,” Draco shrugged, taking a small bite.
Jackie smiled at him. “There was something else I wanted to say. I admire you. You’ve always been cast away, been an outsider, ever since the war. And still, you managed to raise four children, who, might I add, are seriously amazing, and you’re Potions Professor here, and you’re better than our former professor. And the way you handled the debacle with Terence and Priscus. How did you manage to do all that, even with the Mark on your arm?”
Without further questioning, Mr. Malfoy took James’s arm and Apparated them to Gringotts, where James immediately sprinted to the reception area.
“I know. However, you wouldn’t want to answer the rest of my questions.”
“Tell me more.”
“You make it seem like we don’t trust each other. Is that it? Are you only visiting for your mother?”
of 1975, when James, Sirius, Remus and Peter were in their fifth year. They waved nonchalantly at the camera, as if it was an everyday occurrence that they were photographed at school grounds.
Also, today he was brewing Amortentia with Theresa, which was always fun. Unfortunately, Theresa couldn’t stop talking about the Slytherin-Gryffindor thing that was still going on. Theresa even said that SHS didn’t stand for Slytherin House Secret, but rather Slytherin House Ship. Then, she had to explain what ‘shipping’ meant.
Cassie hummed. “Who is Nagini?”
kill. Have I forgotten something?”
“Good, good. May I ask what you’re looking for in Snape’s vault?”
Dinner was fantastic, which wasn’t a surprise, given the amount of hours Potter had put in it. Even though the appetisers and main course were very good, Draco couldn’t wait for desert. The duck in cranberry sauce was sweet and perfectly cooked, but the only thing Draco wanted was the chocolate mixture he had tasted before. Potatoes from the oven were fine and all, but they weren’t white and milk chocolate with caramel.
He couldn’t wait.
“Quite. I told her that I would owl her if we needed more witnesses. Do you want her help?”
“And now I have no idea what to do with myself. Not to mention what my children would think.”
“As we were saying, papa is unable to lie or say no when he has ice cream,” Cassie stated. “I will give you another example, to show that it is not just, as we call it, the ‘Harry Potter Effect’. Papa?”
“Where are we, Potter? I don’t like surprises.”
“Hey, it wasn’t just a guide to how to woo you, Malfoy. It was a guide to how you work. People should know that.”
“Good. Now you can start talking,” George cut to the case.
Draco climbed out of bed at two in the morning. He scribbled some words on a note and creeped towards the Slytherin common room. Above the fireplace, he cast the strongest and most complicated sticking charm he knew, to make sure the note would remain there. He cast another spell, which would make it invisible until Draco spoke the countercharm. He grinned at his own work. It was time.
“She could run. She had less pressure from her family.”
Potter shook his head, giving her a little shove. “Don’t worry, Malfoy, I like the real you better than any replacement they’d send,” he said over the heads of their children. Draco rolled his eyes and let Scorpius tug him to one of the stalls that sold various flavours of chocolate.
“Malf – Draco,” Percy acknowledged Draco, a bit stiff since they never had the most flattering conversations, back at Hogwarts.
They locked eyes for a moment, until Potter faced forward again. Draco bit his lip to suppress a smile. “They have thought about everything, haven’t they,” he stated softly, deliberately not denying the underlying question Potter asked. The result was an enormous grin.
“Blond hair, grey eyes, tall, slender figure? Nothing at all?” Potter asked exasperatedly. His despair vanished when a look of recognition overtook the hunter’s face.
The portrait asked one of his riddles and Aquila answered it easily. She ushered Draco to the stairs, and ignored everyone who was looking at her funnily.
Kneeling down on the ground in front of Aquila, Draco caught her gaze and started singing, the song he started at the birth of the twin, and added to with Cassiopeia’s and Phi’s birth.
Albus laughed again, going to Scorpius in order to drag him away from the chocolate stall. Draco sighed sadly and followed them. While the five Malfoys and three Potter children were walking away, Potter quickly bought three pounds of chocolate, in almost every flavour available. If he could make Draco happy with a Christmas present made of chocolate, he wouldn’t let that opportunity pass.
“I get the idea you don’t like them.”
“You didn’t do it on purpose? Well, you were moving with your hands a lot and playing a bit with your fingers. Like a nervous teenage girl.”
At Potter’s curious look, Albus shrugged. “It’s just that Mr. Malfoy is very complimentary about him, and Neville said that he was a bully, but he could understand where Severus was coming from.”
James and Draco shared a look, then turned their gazes on Theresa.
Potter smiled. “I feel exactly the same,” he assured Draco. He felt the air between them change into something else, something heavier and more magnetic. He knew Draco felt it too, saw it in how Draco’s hand clasped in front of him and he started fiddling with his fingers, and how he swallowed without breaking his gaze.
, there was a memorial service at Hogwarts – and at many other places in Wizarding Britain. The memorial at Hogwarts was led by Minerva, as it was every year. It was twenty-two years ago now, and the period of grieving had not yet ended.
“Could you hand these out for me?” Draco asked, handing James a pile of parchment, on which instructions are for the potion the class would be brewing today.
Aquila, Cassie, Phi, Albus and Lily all shrugged to indicate they wouldn’t mind so much, but Scorpius stared at James.
Rolling his eyes, Draco observed Greg. He wasn’t looking good, cheeks pale and eyes hollow –either from the amount of alcohol he had been consuming lately, or the lack of it the last week. Greg sent him a reassuring smile, though, so Draco nodded and focused back on the conversation between Pansy and Blaise.
“It’s not as if I see her walking the aisle with me, or anything. It’s just fun, for now.”
Aladdin, The Lion King
“If that is your only concern, I will interpret it as being allowed to woo your son. Because, you know, purebloods are not in any way better than half-bloods or muggleborns.”
“I gave it to him.”
“I didn’t do it for you, of course,” Potter responded haughtily. “Why would you think I’d do something kind for you? That’s not like me
Laughing again, Potter shook his head and put down their now empty punch bowls. “Thanks, though. They loved it.”
Hi! So, first off... I know I missed last week, but I have a (good?) reason for that. Because, you see, I told you that I would have a lot of stress, and you all were so kind to say that I should take my time, so I thought you might not mind so much if I skipped a week? I was reeeaaally tired, could barely keep my eyes open, let alone write something of passable quality. So for your sake as well as for mine, I just didn't do it?
“Hi, papa! I was reading your book about Potions. What are mandrakes?” Draco grinned. “Oh, Phi, I wouldn’t want to bore you with that.”
“Yes.”
Why did all Potters have to be so annoyingly friendly, all the bloody time?
“I have. I keep messing up, and it has cost me many points already,” she complained.
“I think we’re underestimating it, still,” Aquila said. “We’re underestimating how large, how complicated this movement might be. I think – I think it might be even more complex than the Death Eaters ever were.”
Paragraph 2:
“Lure a student by promising extra credits,” he suggested then.
At Aquila’s nod, Draco shooed the children out of the house, closing the door behind him and tapping Potter on his shoulder to set the wards. When they left, it was in pairs or trios talking to each other; Scorpius and Albus, James with Aquila and Cassie with Lily. Phi had taken hold of Potter’s hand. His hair was flicking between Malfoy blond, Potter black and energetic orange.
“Gross. We need to make this decision within thirty seconds. Is this a Dark potion or not?”
Draco opened his door further in invitation. “Come in. Butterbeer is fine, and if your conversational skills are even worse than usual, I’ve got some Firewhiskey of myself. Make yourself comfortable,” he nodded. Neville grinned and sank down on the sofa, summoning two tumblers and pouring the Butterbeer in them. He winked at Draco, offered the fullest glass and took a sip from his own.
“Oh, are we talking about obsessions, now? Really, Potter, one would think you forgot your own tendencies,” Draco shot back, raising an eyebrow.
“I do,” Potter said when he was sure Draco was done talking. “I do understand. That’s why I want to give you the time you need.” He sat thinking for a few moments. “At the beginning of this talk, you used past tense. You said you ‘needed’ time and the risks ‘outweighed’ the profits. Was that intentional?”
“Pleasure’s all mine,” Draco assured her.
“Last month, I have spent my free time researching and retracing the steps you described. I tested the potion, and it seems to work. As your aim was, it is a Healing potion, designed to remove scars?”
Giving Draco a little nudge and gesturing to the abandoned plate, Potter bit his lip. “Keep eating, Malfoy. It won’t be good for anyone if you don’t take care of yourself right now. But how are the children dealing? I see Aquila has joined Cassie and Phi.”
As Draco was pondering what to answer, Theresa and James were walking out, their bickering loud but comforting. In the end, when their voices had faded away, Draco stuffed the note in his pocket and stalked towards Hagrid’s hut.
Draco hummed the rest of the melody to them both, burying his nose in the crook of Potter’s neck and inhaling the scent he knew so well. He felt Potter smile against his cheek.
is not something we can eradicate. We will make them stop assaulting me, but we can’t stop them entirely. There is too much hate towards Death Eaters still. The war is too fresh.”
“Cassie, love, the Yule Ball is very far away. I will make sure you’ve got your robes and Yule dress by the time it comes around. The rest of the packing isn’t very difficult, is it? Just take a good amount of clothes in which you can enjoy the out- and indoors. No, no, don’t take that gown, it’s far too beautiful. You won’t need it.
The cup of tea McGonagall was holding clinked on its saucer with the violence with which she put it down. “What?”
Nodding, Doctor Selaminder turned to the Wizengamot. “May I address the suspect with a few questions?”
James was glowing and grinning so widely, that Draco started to fear his face might split. “It worked, then? Did it work? The potion?”
“He won’t listen to me! He thinks I need to control my temper and –“ Scorpius growled, but cut himself off when he saw Draco entering.
“Aquila is calm as always, though she spends most of her time reading up on the Patronus Charm. I hope you won’t get angry, but I helped her practicing. She already managed an incorporeal one two days back.”
“Yes, but I got my letter when I was ten, too. It’s when your birthday is in the middle of the schoolyear, then you can get a letter when you’re ten or eleven. It depends on your magic,” another one answered.
“Really? Too bad. We’ll Firecall, yes? Should I walk you out?”
dying, because you didn’t stand up for yourself. And I dare say that he won’t be able to take much more before he breaks.”
“And Auror Whithal shaped it into a domestic abuse trial?”
Draco thought he would be silenced, for the first time in his life, but his mouth started talking.
“Not guilty, sir.”
“It’s escalating,” Draco murmured.
“Also, we would like to go to the Weasley’s outlet, if that’s all right with you,” Aquila supplied.
“Listen, Longbottom. I… I would like to apologise. I wasn’t very pleasant to you, I know. No, let me speak. There isn’t an excuse for it. I do have explanations, but they aren’t enough. Just… know that I’m trying to make it right, okay? And, ehm, my children aren’t anything like me. So, even if they are cheeky, or rude, or annoying, I would appreciate it if you wouldn’t… you know… treat them like I would be treated. They’re just children. Please.” Draco resisted his urge to fidget and put his hands on the table, half open and easy to see. He made sure that his body language was proud, but lacking arrogance.
“Finally!”
He shouldn’t have done that. He should not have done that.
He knew Draco liked him. That had become more than clear in the last couple of weeks. He wondered how far he could go before Draco would realise it had gotten more-than-friendly. Perhaps they could hold hands, before Draco shied away again. Potter would like that very much, to hold Draco’s hand. He loved – the physical closeness they had. Maybe, with all these cosy Christmas vibes, Potter could finally get Draco to talk about the possibility of a relationship.
“A routine? What would that be like?” Draco laughed.
“Floo?”
“And is it the curse that papa tried to invent a counterpotion for?”
“Sure, sure,” the others gave in. “But now, all we can do, is be the best students he has ever had, so he’ll notice us,” the third winked.
“He had me to lash out to, didn’t he? So no, during our marriage, our children were safe.”
“Ask Mr. Potter.”
“Same to you. How are you?”
“Oui, papa m’a appris des Français au début, parce que c’est la langue plus élégante. Et parce que ma grand-mère vit donc en France. Mais surtout parce que c’est la langue dans laquelle papa peut s’exprimer le mieux. Il n’est pas, papa ?” Phi rattled. Draco quirked an eyebrow at Potter’s stunned look.
“Oh, I don’t know, every single professor with a brain? Not that you would understand, given your own brainless head.”
Draco didn’t know what to do. George didn’t seem like the person who would want a hug, but Draco didn’t really have anything else to offer.
“That is word for word what I just thought.”
“I’m merely curious as to what has your knickers in a twist.”
“If you’d like to dance,” Albus repeated. Manila smiled softly, taking his hand and leading him onto the floor. Their dancing was uncomfortable and awkward. Draco grinned at Potter, happy with his match-making. When Albus caught their gaze, he rolled his eyes at Draco and stuck his tongue out to Potter. Manila just laughed.
Draco churned his teeth in realisation what the only option was.
“What about that hoodie? Do you know why he Glamours it?” Scorpius asked, suddenly interested.
“Hold up, hold up,” Scorpius managed to say through his giggles. “Why have you warded the labyrinth with your magical core?”
At a certain point, he saw that Aquila looked very downtrodden, more so than she had been previously. He flicked his wand and
“And when I said that I wanted to be the best potioneer Salazar had ever seen, he helped me. When I wrote him a letter telling that my new best friend was Albus Severus Potter, he invited him over. When I felt my back was forced against the wall, he broke it down and showed me the way to another chance.”
James huffed. “Oh, I don’t know, kiss?”
A bit later, he got another present, which turned out to be a locket with pictures of his children and parents in it. Draco squeezed Potter’s shoulder in thanks, sparing no words for something he wouldn’t even be able to verbalise.
“You’ve really got it bad, don’t you?” Draco chuckled. James just grinned sheepishly and shrugged.
“How?”
“Love?”
“Pansy is picking up Greg from the rehab centre, they’ll be here in a moment,” Potter told Draco, kissing the stuck-out lower lip fleetingly, and making Scorpius roll his eyes and Phi utter a disgusted sound.
“All right… But you know I can’t do this alone. Ms. Aquila Auriga Malfoy, would you do me the honour of accompanying me on my quest?” Draco said, with a formal bow. Aquila giggled and, adequately raised in the pure-blood manners, accepted her father’s hand with grace and let herself be lead towards the dinner table. Draco set her down on it. With a quick flick, he started the music he knew his children wanted to hear and began to sing.
“Very unkind of the Potions professor not to tell you anything about her progress,” Draco said sympathetically, while innocently looking at his plate. “Could I help, somehow?”
At Potter’s surprised sound, Draco grimaced again, but nodded.
Lucius narrowed his eyes at Draco. “No matter what you do, they will never forget your history with the Dark Lord.”
Around eight o’clock, Ophiuchus walked in, greeting Pansy and Blaise and moving to the bedroom. Potter followed him into the living room.
“Why did they have so much fun about that silent garden of yours?” Harry asked when they closed the door behind them, walking outside. It was a wonderful afternoon, one where Draco would like nothing more than to enjoy the sun with some good company and a glass of white wine. Perhaps a book or a puzzle as well.
“You saved the chocolate,” he breathed softly, eyeing the mixture with interest.
“She was almost placed in Gryffindor.”
“Malfoy, what is it?”
“I have spoken him a few times. Why?”
Potter laughed, throwing the spoon in the sink and lowering the fire beneath the chocolate. “White and milk chocolate, mixed with a bit of caramel and some herbs. It’s especially good with the ice cream I bought.”
Theresa looked at him with surprise written all over her face and doubled over in laughter. “Is the great Draco Malfoy actually indulging in gossip?” she managed to joke.
“But –“
“Because it’s a good movie. What, you don’t like it?”
was absent at a time that your siblings may have needed you. Does that seem like normal behaviour to you?”
“Not a password or a key or something?”
“Potter,” he whispered. “Potter, are you awake?”
“Draco Malfoy.”
“I know!” Potter nodded. “’Je vais’ is a pronoun with a verb, and ‘bien’ means ‘good’ or ‘fine’. And then you said ‘merci’, right? That means ‘thank you.’”
Favourite comment on my last chapter: 'CAN THIS JUST CALM DOWN FOR FIVE FUCKING SECONDS SO I CAN BREATHE??!?!!'
Cassie nodded. “Exactly, and if you don’t try, how can you know if it works out?”
My arms will hold you,
Hermione turned to them when Narcissa called her name, but her smile visibly faltered when she saw Draco.
“Free? Why? Were they begging? I told them they shouldn’t beg, because it’s far too effective and not polite, but –“
“He needs to know in order to even remotely understand you, Draco.”
“Good afternoon, boys. Let’s have a talk,” Draco said, letting his voice drop to a dangerous undertone and locking the door behind him.
“Hi,” Potter answered. Draco heard a loud honk come from the bed and shot a look at Scorpius, who was laughing without a sound, but holding his stomach.
“Come on, give me one good reason.”
Scorpius laughed. “Of course not, Albie. I was only thinking we should start decorating. You know, some candles,
“Why?”
Draco looked down at what he just wrote down. “Well, the graph shows us when the potion wears off and when it’s at its strongest. The tables say a lot of things I’m not sure of, because it all sounds a little improbable, and the other letters are scientific shortenings of certain effects and possible dangers. You’ll learn the meaning of all those if you decide to actually do your Potions mastery. For now, it’s too complicated to explain.”
Sighing, Ms. Euripideia stood up. “I will ask my secretary, if you’ll wait a moment.”
Draco shrugged. “Flea market,” he chuckled. “Somewhere around Diagon Alley, there’s this tiny little alley leading to a grand courtyard with a few high-end restaurants and the flea market I bought it.”
“Are we going to Hogsmeade? We can’t go to Hogsmeade, Potter,” Draco objected.
“I love it.”
Potter’s heart sunk. He may have read Draco wrong then, Pansy and the children may have been wrong. When Potter scooted his hand a bit upwards to tap Draco’s thigh, he had unwrapped himself from the five bodies leaning on him and stood up.
“Well, as I said, I never saw any sign of love between them. I haven’t seen explicit signs, like bruises or something. However, now that I think of it…” Lazarus frowned in thought. “I have seen Scorpius slipping out of the hospital wing a couple of times this year, with unhealed bruises and scars on his arms and face. I didn’t know what to think of it, until now.”
“No, I bribed a first year to do it.”
Narrowing his eyes in an attempt to read Potter, Draco gave a few tugs on the spoon, only causing Potter to take a small step closer in order to gain his balance.
had finished, the Potter children pushed a different movie in, while Potter started working on dinner. The entire day was spend by watching cliché Christmas movies and nicking sweets and cookies from the table, relishing the good smells coming from the kitchen.
Draco rushed to his side and pressed a few hard kisses to his forehead. Scorpius smiled at him, clasped his hand before turning back to Potter.
Walking into the Great Hall, knowing what was about to happen, made Draco fidget a bit. He saw Potter at the High Table looking at his plate. When they locked eyes, Potter blushed and looked away.
Albus and Lily stared in shock at Mr. Malfoy. Right. They didn’t know papa was dying, yet.
Greg smirked. “Everything. I know that you paid double the amount of your fines, half of which went to Hogwarts for rebuilding purposes. I know that you sent books and letters with spells to get rid of Dark magic, and potions for Healing. I know you have been able to open hallways and rooms that had been closed for centuries, and that can now be used as offices or storages. How did you even do that?”
He stood up and moved to the wing where all the bedrooms were. He met Cass and Harky in Cassie’s room, as expected.
Pansy seemed to want to say more, but Blaise pulled her away.
Harry relaxed against the cushions, trying to calm his rabbiting heart.
“Perhaps I should come back tomorrow?”
He ignored his father, not able to trust the man again.
Looking down at Cassie, who was still hanging onto Draco’s hand, Draco decided to bring all four of his to one of the rooms, followed by the young Potters and Weasleys. Soon, most children under sixteen had fallen asleep.
didn’t know, and you’re lying in the
“Obviously not. But their children will get a mixed upbringing. It’s not a coincidence that all Weasleys are in Gryffindor, even though some of them would fit perfectly well in other Houses.”
“What are we going to do?”
There was a bell ringing in his head, something trying to alarm him that he knew where to look. Right! One of Mr. Malfoy’s letters! He had said that papa had proposed a spell to Voldemort during the war.
“Yes. It was heartfelt and sincere.”
“They were perhaps a bit small on you, though,” Potter added.
“Look, papa, the Sugar Quills are on sale!” Cassie exclaimed, pointed at the extraordinarily sized quills in the front of the shop window. “Ten pieces for five Sickles! Papa, can we get some?”
Draco lifted his head with a sigh, and let out another sigh when he saw Albus.
. Alright?”
“Why would you always battle dragons? Dragons are cool, they should be loved,” Draco complained.
Also HIIIIII I MISSED YOU
Longbottom steps forward. Draco feels his blood drain from his face. ‘No. Not the Gryffindors. Please, Longbottom, no!’ Draco flinches. ‘Longbottom, please…’
“Anything, anything at all. Just one more spoonful. It doesn’t even have to be a spoonful, it can also be a few drips. A fingertip. I need chocolate.”
“Perhaps because your papa pushed her away when she was struggling with Aquila being in Ravenclaw. She wasn’t right, but your papa could have been more understanding!” Potter challenged.
everyone, come to you for relationship advice?”
Okay bye
Potter kept silent, visibly thinking. After a few moments, he narrowed his eyes at Draco and said, with a deep, rumbling voice, “Don’t you dare contact Hermione or Ron about this.”
Hihi. "Enjoy" the chapter.
“I worry about it. About what might happen to you and Jamie and Albus and Lills. What if you become victims as well?”
Perhaps he was a Squib. Could Harry Potter be a Squib? That would explain why he didn’t live in the Wizarding World, or at least, why no one was able to find him. Draco suddenly felt like he was punched in the gut. If his hero was a Squib, he would never be able to meet him. He would never see him walking in Diagon Alley, he would never shake his hand, or invite him to his home. His father wouldn’t allow it. Ever. Oh, please, let Harry Potter be a wizard!
Draco sighed. “I don’t know if I’m the best person to talk to about this. I’ve been married, but it was largely arranged as a business deal. I’m not good with the emotional stuff, James.”
“Are you always going to be this way?”
“Anything wrong, papa?” Cassie asked. Draco shook his head.
Like always, DYING to hear what you think of this! Please leave comments and feedback. Your comments make me happy, resulting in more chapters/longer chapters/better chapters and Happy Drarry.
Scorpius rolled his eyes at him but smiled at the same time. Dominique and Louis, the children of Bill and Fleur, exchanged a look.
When he folded up the paper, he noticed a sticky note on the back of it.
“What do you want, Aquila?”
“That’s exactly how it works, isn’t it?”
“Say Malfoy! I really like these pictures,” he said.
“Yes. The game of Quidditch you promised me. Why wait until tomorrow?”
Potter groaned. “Malfoy, you utter shithead. What is wrong with you?”
Pansy let out a breath, forcibly relaxing her hands and pasting a smile for her friends. “All right. I’ll do my best.”
! Of course not, that would be stupid.”
“No, Scorpius. No.”
“Potter, I truly hate you with every fibre of my being,” Draco announced, when the laughter had subsided. “You make me feel like a first year schoolgirl, having just been asked to the Valentine’s Ball by the Quidditch Captain.”
“I –“
He cast the spell that would make documents with his name on it light up, then started mumbling as he tried unlocking the drawer.
This resulted in the other Malfoys and Albus to agree wholeheartedly with him.
“Except for those few years of stupidity,” Scorpius cut in, rolling his eyes. “Not that we mind, of course, but you can’t say you’ve always done the right thing. Now, are there any other pranging matters we should address, or can we continue with tonight’s plan?”
Draco sighed. He should just begin already.
“There is a reason you bloody well didn’t know.” Draco knew his anger was getting out of control. It was only fuelled by his fear that Potter might find out the
Pushing a wheelbarrow in the middle of the corridor between the rows of boxes, Draco took a shovel himself and opened the next – occupied – box. “You pick up all pieces of muck. It doesn’t have to be entirely clean, as long as the actual scat is out. When the wheelbarrow is full, I’ll dispose of it and we can distribute the clean straw. It’s simple, really.”
“You two are awful. I hate you both and you will never see my children again if you continue,” he threatened. Pansy and Blaise fell silent immediately, blinking up at him in perfect innocence.
Somewhere around midnight, a few moments after the old grandfather clock in his living room had struck, someone knocked on his door. It was urgent, rapt. Cassie probably had had a nightmare, which would also explain why Draco was restless. He was always restless at nights Cassie had bad dreams. He felt them coming.
And Draco sang, as well as his tired throat could manage.
“Oh no, don’t you worry.” Draco leant forward as close as he was allowed to before Auror Smiths cleared his throat in warning. “I am thinking of you all the time, my love. You keep me company even in the darkest of times.”
“I’m sorry, sir, but there is someone here to see you,” he said. Draco frowned, and not just from the fact that Filch behaved and moved exactly like his house-elf Harky.
“May I ask, how are things going?”
MAKE IT NOT HAPPEN
“You are blood bonded?” George asked, sparing another glance at Smiths.
“I am really looking forward to becoming your brother, Scorpius,” Albus stated.
Pouring two glasses of water, Lucius settled himself in a bit more. “It’s about a thousand years old, I believe. I have no idea who invented it, but I know that it was used by Curse Breakers. During the 1100’s, Curse Breakers were just Aurors with some extra diplomas, and those Curse Breakers often used the spell for long-term criminals they couldn’t catch otherwise.”
“And what if we have insults?” a voice called from the back of the class.
“No, not at first. Scorpius mentioned it. When I asked about it, she told me more about them.”
“I don’t know, perhaps the receptionist could have recognised me as Harry “the Saviour” Potter’s son?”
Last chapter was far too short, so you deserved another one. Enjoy!
“Magic,” Cassie singsonged, starting to grab the materials Draco would need to do his own hair. “Papa, have you showered already?”
Malfoy shook his head again, muscles in his hands tensing and relaxing in a distressed rhythm.
“Fresh enough,” Pansy answered, when it seemed Potter had retreated in his sulky state.
Two weeks into the summer break, which had been filled with trips to a Muggle supermarket, a zoo, a lake, game evenings and gardening, Draco and Scorpius were back in Draco’s study. They had spent a few hours each day here, digging through archives and family trees in hopes of finding how Laurentia Fletwock and Katana May could be connected, or if they could be the same person.
The punches had been replaced by unrelenting kicks, until it took literally every ounce of focus to concentrate on his breathing.
Pansy laughed. “I have been indulging you for years now, why are you complaining?”
Fiddling with his shirt, James didn’t look up in Draco’s eyes. “Because Manila is part of it too.”
The first sounds after the transformation hit the black panther’s ears with a violence that made him gnarl, snapping his paws against the air. He tried to move away from whatever he was hearing, but the movement of his nails against the stone floor made him flinch the other way.
After dinner, Draco was tugged to Potter’s apartment, where Potter and his children were lounging about with homework and assignments.
“You don’t understand! We needed each other, every moment of the day. And I left him to fend for himself. I wasn’t even there when he died, Draco.
“I am sorry to call you here at this early hour, Mr. and Mrs. Goldstein, Mr. Belby. I’m afraid I have to tell you about your children, Terence and Priscus.”
“Oh, Potter,” Draco sighed. “There are worse things about you than your French pronunciation.”
Potter smirked. “You’ll see, sweet cheeks.”
Draco huffed in mock indignation.
“And why exactly are walks on the beach romantic? Isn’t it annoying, the sand in your shoes and the freezing wind blowing your hair out of style?”
Her voice turned low, threatening. “And that is more than we can say for you. You act like you have never done something wrong! But we all know that you have made mistakes as well. Horrible mistakes that have hurt people.” With a piercing gaze, she added, “The scars of your mistake used to terrify me.”
“Miss Weasley, do you happen to know why you’re not able to cut the bean?” Draco asked. He heard Severus’s voice through his own and grinned inwardly.
Draco smiled tiredly at her, sharing a last look with McGonagall before going to the Slytherin common room.

“Because someone might attack you?”
Lucius frowned. “You aren’t making sense, Draco. Try again.”
George laughed. “Never, since I already seduced you. Join me, instead of Harry. I’m much more fun!”
Scorpius, having thrown an arm around Phi the moment James was semi-okay again, rolled his eyes. “Because he doesn’t understand emotions.”
“Why?” Phi frowned.
your children. And Cassie, making such a big mistake. Scorpius was ruined when he heard about Cassie! Can you imagine what might happen if he had to endure one more such blow?”
“Why not? Afraid I’ll fall in love with you on first sight?”
“That means papa must have notes somewhere!” James exclaimed to the empty hallway. Gathering his parchment and his coat, he ran outside, ignoring the calls from classmates, in the direction of Hogsmeade. There, he Apparated to where he knew he would find what he needed.
“Why would you be nervous about asking me how I am? I appreciate it when you do that, you know. I’m glad you don’t seem to forget that Scorpius is in the hospital.”
While Draco ushered his children in front of him, so they would get their own lunch, he walked next to Albus.
Cassie nodded seriously, letting Draco turn back to his cosy conversation with Potter, and smirked at the others. “And that’s how you do it.”
“I… see. That’s… Why… What…”
“Yes, he’s lurking there somewhere, in case something went wrong.”
“Two minutes it is.”
“Oh…”
The moment all five of them were eating their second slice, a knock sounded and Potter walked right in. “Malfoy, you’re awake, right? Should we do something for the twins –“ He stopped himself when the Malfoys stared up at him, stopping their movements altogether and looking guilty.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Why don’t you ask another professor?”

Andddd... guess who's got Tumblr (:-). If you want ficrecs and small pieces of my own writing, mostly about Drarry, but also some half-poetic shit, please follow me! Name's i-am-and-proud :D
“You’re a radish?”
“And is it
“Dad, when do we have that Defense test again? Shania said it was next week, but I thought it was in two weeks,” she asked. “And if it’s next week, I’m behind on planning, and my grade will drop.”
James nodded approvingly, as if that was the only thing he had needed to hear.
“What is?” Ah, insults, Draco’s lovely way out of every awkward situation.
“I don’t know yet. I’ll have to read up on taking care of ferrets tomorrow.”
“I want someone who can handle my occasional sarcastic remarks.”
“The problem is that you ran off without telling me. We had a deal about that.”
At that moment, Potter came barging down the stairs, obviously having tried to tame his hair and failed.
The refrain had Albus and Louis in front, both singing but clearly not the main vocal that was heard. They too split to Slytherin and Gryffindor when their verse ended, making way for the third verse.
“In Euripideia’s office. It’s her family, Harry.”
Neville looked at him, with a clear question in his eyes. Draco looked back. “If you wanted me to…” he started. Neville began to smile. “… I could test out some theories. But I would need help of your Curse Breaker-friends. There’s a spell that needs to be adapted and changed.”
“My mother did not take the Mark.”
“Merlin, it’s been so long since the war. We’ve changed so much. All of us. It’s ridiculous to realise how much time has passed and everything that has happened since then. You’re in a relationship with Harry James Potter now, who would’ve thought?” Greg grinned.
