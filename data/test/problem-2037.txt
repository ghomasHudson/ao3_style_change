There was also a letter on the small kitchen table within that Draco cracked open with shaking hands, seeing a palm-sized wooden disk engraved with the word 'HOME' fall out and clatter onto the table.
“What are those?” he asked in an undertone. “We’re not authorised to ask to see Experimental Breeding permits, but surely we should mention them to someone. . . .”
“—don’t go!” Potter interrupted, then hurried down the rest of the steps toward him. “Really, please, don’t go. It’ll be fine, Hermione thinks you’re great, they’re all nice, Eddie’s here and he’ll tell you all about how much he loves dragons, and I’ll feed you, it’s fine.”
Then he pressed his thumb a little harder against the nipple and Potter let out a whine, releasing Draco’s neck along with a shuddering breath.
The man started awake, his eyes wide and bloodshot. And Draco noticed that he looked incredibly drawn, with puffy dark circles under his eyes. He was also pretty certain those were the same clothes he’d been wearing when they’d been out at the Mewstone. “Malfoy, you’re awake? You’re awake. Thank god, you’re awake.” Then he stumbled to his feet and raced out of the room.
, for fuck’s sake.” There was a slight tremor to his voice and Draco swallowed, still staring at the red liquid in his glass.
“I did, yeah. I hadn’t seen them since Christmas. I’m pretty sure that Eddie—that’s Edgar, Ron and Susan’s son—has definitely grown since then. And Luna only just got back from her latest trip out of the country after being gone for four months.”
“Fu—Draco—fuck! Holy—” Potter babbled, his hands reaching out to grip Draco’s arms, then grasp at the bedsheets, then reach blindly for him once more.
Potter rolled his eyes dramatically but did so, and grinned at him, his eyes lighting up in excitement.
“Butterfly weed,” she replied just as quietly. “I think it’s time to let go of his hold on the two of us, don’t you?”
Still chuckling he took a step back to retrieve the fallen mugs and was surprised when Potter’s hand darted out and grabbed his, then sharply pulled him into his arms for a short but searing kiss.
He got a distracted nod in return, then Potter’s frown deepened as he said, “All right. And, er, good job today. I guess.”
At some point Potter managed to release his hair from its tie and was running his hands through it, and Draco felt himself smirking. “You seem to enjoy my hair,” he murmured against the man’s mouth, before releasing his hand from its tight grip to instead slide it under his shirt, pressing against the warm skin of his lower back.
A cloying sort of fear bubbled up within him and he temporarily felt that awful trapped feeling but he took a slow breath and ruthlessly squashed it. “All right. I’ll stay.”
She gave him an amused smile, as if he’d said something particularly funny. “Oh, I’m not going anywhere now that you’ve brought me into this! Now, I’m free on Thursday mornings and most Sundays. If you can get Harry to agree to meet on Thursdays then I can be here for that and help out with testing enchantments, and Sundays would be best for any tests that need a secure facility. How does that sound?”
“Hermione mentioned that the joint pain sometimes lingers for up to three months,” Potter said in a low voice, and it took Draco a few seconds to piece together the words and their meaning.
When he arrived he slumped back against the front door, his breath coming in shuddering gasps, and he was only vaguely aware of the sound of Potter Apparating in before he was being held tightly in his arms. And he couldn’t do anything but continue to try to breathe, and it was so damn difficult, reminding him of being underwater, his body fighting against the dangers of decompression. His fingers were digging so deeply into Potter’s back that he was sure he’d leave bruises but he couldn’t let go of his solid form, since he was the only thing holding him upright.
The rest of the week passed much in the same way, and Draco thought that he might well go mad. It wasn’t until Thursday arrived that he finally had a break in the monotony.
A few hours later after they’d both eaten, had a drink, and retreated to Potter’s room they spent an eternity slowly enjoying each other’s bodies, but this was different from the times they’d done so before. Draco felt it in every touch, every kiss, every breath, each one so slow and soft and tender. It wasn’t just fucking anymore. He didn’t know how that had happened, but he couldn’t ignore it any longer.
“Merlin,” he breathed, reaching out to touch the surface. Thankfully, his beer-addled brain hadn’t purchased an enchanted mirror so he didn’t need to suffer a response.
Slowly, carefully, he withdrew himself and then lowered himself onto his back, sprawling next to him.
“So do I get a new minder, then? One who actually knows the product?” At this rate he would put up with McLaggen. There was no way he could possibly be as infuriatingly childish as Potter. Not at thirty years of age.
“Don’t bother coming any earlier than four o’clock on weekdays,” he finally said, after they’d remained silent but for the occasional sips of tea for some twenty minutes. “The classes end at three but the instructor tends to go over. Today, I’d like to look at one of the brooms and test it a bit. Depending on what I find, I might want to do some more checks, or get started on some adjustments next time you’re here. How often are you planning on coming by?”
“—check who’s here, I’ll be right back!” he heard Potter announce before he was clomping down the stairs, coming to a dead halt when he saw Draco standing there gripping the bottle tightly.
The seeds were tossed into a bowl to deal with later, and he put the kettle on in what was now somewhat of a ritual. After preparing the two usual mugs he sat in his chair and asked, “Well? What brings you here?”
“Sorry you had to see that, old friend,” he said with a grin, then rose, stretched, and went to clean himself up.
“What happened?” Draco asked. The last thing he remembered was being in the water, and trying to surface. It had been dark; if his
Draco let out a shaky breath, his forehead dropping against the man’s shoulder, momentarily overwhelmed by the tenderness in his voice.
“It’s good to see you looking so well,” Azzy said in a soft voice. “I know it’s been a long time since we last saw each other, but I’m glad you’re doing all right.”
up since I’m sure the light will be terrible underwater. Maybe you should follow along a little above me to keep an eye on things?”
He chanced a glance over but didn’t see any sign of mockery in the other man’s expression, which was a pleasant surprise. Instead Potter had a pensive look on his face.
Somewhat pleasingly, that made Potter splutter so Draco turned away to hide his small smile. The man didn’t find his ability to articulate until they were several yards outside of the clearing, where he asked, “What were those nuts, anyway? I don’t think I’ve had them before.”
Potter shifted slightly while the hand that was holding the mobile came up to awkwardly rake through his hair. As he did so the area between them was suddenly plunged into darkness, his face no longer illuminated by the light of the small display.
The moment stretched on uncomfortably for far too long until finally Potter caved, and Draco felt some satisfaction. “Right then. They also gave me a list of ways that new charms will definitely go wrong if certain new ones are added—anti-tampering measures. So depending on that we may need to remove some of the enchantments before you go adding some of your own.”
“Don’t worry about it,” Draco interrupted, then grabbed the mugs and was just turning with them when Potter said, “No really, I can—” and had apparently moved closer because suddenly Draco was stepping right into him and he dropped both mugs in surprise at the sudden impact.
He was searching for the right words to say when the man cleared his throat, an uncertain expression on his face. “Look, I know you said that you couldn’t but I want to put it out there again. I’d like for you to come by for lunch on Saturday. It’s not as many people as pub night, and it’s just here. And if you don’t want to, I understand that. But I want you to know that you’re welcome and—and I want to see you,” he finished, stumbling over his last words.
Draco still didn’t have any new ideas on heat protection nor had he received the additional muggle books to learn more about ultraviolet radiation, so he considered his list, then said, “Atmospheric Charms next, I should think. And depending on how smoothly those work together, I’ll follow them with Sticking Charms.”
Draco still hadn’t recovered from the vulnerability he’d felt during their time in the drawing room, so he didn’t look up, instead focusing on the coat in his hands. He wanted to stay. He absolutely wanted to crawl back into the man’s bed and lose himself for the rest of the night. But he was a coward.
If anything, that only encouraged Potter to shake the bottle of hot sauce even more vigorously over his plate of gallo pinto. Draco was beyond sneering at this point. His face was so twisted in revulsion that the small child at the next table over had erupted in giggles, and he couldn’t even sneer at her in response because his face wouldn’t contort any further.
It clearly took a few seconds for the words to take hold and Potter blinked a few times, before blustering, “What? What do you mean, both of us?”
“Oh. Er—” Potter looked around, then asked, “Do you have a table? Like, a proper one, not that counter space.”
“So you told your friend about my project, and you told her where I live, because you didn’t want to have a guilty conscience later on?” Draco knew he was being difficult, but at the same time he wanted to make sure he completely understood. He didn’t want any more surprises.
Despite Potter frowning deeply at that response he didn’t argue. A few seconds passed and he simply said, “Okay.”
Meanwhile, Potter chewed on his lip, avoiding his gaze. “What if we just keep travelling the world? No pointless bureaucracy. No Robards. No boring patrol shifts where we have to stand at the busiest corner of Diagon Alley giving bloody directions. Just . . . what we’ve been doing. I mean, you don’t have to. Maybe that’s what I’ll do though.”
“Yeah, yeah, no paperwork until we’re back to the dull procedural work and awful hours,” Potter replied. “He knows. Didn’t stop him from talking my ear off about how excited he is to have us back soon. Can’t believe it’s already almost March.”
Draco retreated to the edge of the clearing so that he could lean against a sturdy tree then set to work carefully boring a hole near the end of the handle, just large enough to hold the small enchanted stone but snug enough that it wouldn’t easily slip free. Then he set off on a few regular laps around the clearing, and gradually added in difficult flips, sudden spins, jarring turns and stops, all the while paying attention to the responsiveness of the broom.
Draco fought the urge to look back over at the man and instead focused his gaze inward, not really seeing the boats anymore as he continued to think.
Hermione exchanged a few words with Potter as she led them through the maze of the department back to the lifts, where she bade them farewell. As they were ascending toward the Atrium Potter asked, “So, the Mewstone? Did you want to do that tomorrow?”
Breathing rapidly he looked around, finding himself in a tangle of sheets on what was definitely Potter’s bed, though the man was not present. And, seeing the quality of the light that managed to make it in through the clouded window he gathered that it was later than usual for him to be waking up, since it was definitely well past dawn.
Draco shook his head. “No, those seem like rather reasonable instructions. I can’t imagine forgetting such simple rules.”
A minute later he was tying back his tangles of wet hair and looking out the open door to see Potter still just standing there, as if his brain had leaked out of his ears.
He shrugged easily and continued to let Potter get them helplessly lost. It ultimately didn’t matter if they didn’t find their way back to the yacht until dawn; they had quite a bit of leeway in their travel time on this one, since they’d wrapped up their scheduled meetings already and only needed to ensure that they were back in Athens by the 25th.
Fire immediately filled the room, brightening gradually as the seconds passed. Hermione was staring intently at a display on the console; when Draco looked over, he saw that there were several readouts, including a temperature gauge. The needle was slowly rising on it, and when it passed 750 degrees a symbol started flashing.
By the time Potter returned to the drawing room Draco had tidied up the sprawl of books and notes, condensing them to two small stacks on the table. There was some prickling in his right shoulder so he rolled it a few times, sighing in annoyance.
He spun around and pointed his spoon at Potter, ignoring as it dripped red splotches onto his bare feet. “No. I’m not talking about that with you. I’m not talking about any of it. You want to talk brooms? Fine. I want to experiment with a broom for a personal project. I expect I’ll break many brooms in the process. I might as well purchase several in one go, rather than ordering one at a time. But, if that’s what I need to do because of my status, then that’s what I’ll do.” And he turned back to his soup.
He double checked the measurements, then made a few notches with his knife so that he wouldn’t need to restart from scratch before setting the block of wood aside. “Potter.”
Potter’s eyes snapped open and he made a pained expression, then hung his head. “Yeah, I guess that’s for the best. I’ll show you to your room, then.”
He let out a short breath through his nose and had a drink of the ouzo, steeling himself. “You’ve been taking photos of me though,” Draco pointed out. “In fact, I’d wager the majority of those photographs are of me, not of the
Once he arrived he was pleased to see that the rock’s enchantments had held, as there was a visible ring of dry grass around it, uncovered by snow. Draco shook out the towel, laying it on the ground within the bubble of warmth and stretching out on it, feeling his upper back twinge, then gazed up at the twinkling sky. His eyes immediately sought the familiar constellations and he spent what felt like hours simply lying there, hearing his mother’s soft voice in his head, until his eyelids grew heavy and he fell into a dreamless slumber.
Since there was still no sign of Potter he helped himself to the pantry and soon had the kettle on, and was toasting thick slices of bread above the fire. At nine o’clock sharp there was a loud crack from the front entrance above followed by the sound of brisk footsteps descending the narrow staircase.
By the time he’d added a third finger Potter’s sounds were gaining a frantic edge so he rose from his position and lined up their cocks, taking a moment to rub their pre-come over them both before removing his fingers from his arse and positioning himself, sliding into him in one smooth thrust.
He finished his line, tucked the pencil away in his shirt pocket, then rose to his feet and met the man’s gaze. “Of course I am. It’s fucking December.”
He looked up at that and said sharply, “I do, you twat.” Then he swallowed noisily and looked back down toward the floor.
Draco looked up into his eyes and saw something tender that he recognised from Saturday. He wasn’t quite awake enough yet to be afraid of it.
He shrugged. Draco still hadn’t accustomed himself to the temperatures on mainland, and the air was a refreshing sort of cool compared to the frigid nights in Azkaban. “I’ve survived colder,” he said shortly, before sheathing his knife and setting off toward the clearing.
wasn’t likely to make me more amenable. Even if this interpretation of his death was more creative than usual.”
All went well with the adapted Bubble-Head, and he set up a Sticking Charm to keep the lid shut while the charm was engaged.
“No, I don’t have a hidden torture dungeon here, if that’s what you’re implying,” Draco said tiredly. He just wanted his
He could see Potter’s knuckles going white, but his voice was steady and calm as he repeated the question. “Will you consider accepting help?”
He bit his lip, then reached across the table to touch the tips of his fingers to the man’s hands where they clutched his mug.
“Fuck, I could do this every day,” Potter breathed, his hand reaching down to wrap around both of their cocks, pumping them loosely in a fist.
As they sat there watching each other, that buried part of Draco, the one that had an all-consuming need to annoy Potter, to hurt Potter, to do
“Oh, don’t worry about that.” Then she was digging through her bag and removing enough equipment to set up three decent stations. “I’ll let you arrange those the way you prefer. And if you’d like to make a list of ingredients I can pop back up here to pick it up before I head out later this afternoon.”
“The skipper mentioned he’d be staying on land tonight,” Potter said as he set down the water bottles next to the stairs that led to the berth. “Want to stay up for a bit and have a drink?”
Potter aimed an intent sort of frown at him that Draco couldn’t begin to understand, then mumbled something and returned to his room. Shaking his head in bemusement he returned his comb and towel to his room before setting off to start his day.
They both stood in a comfortable silence for some time, first watching as a squirrel leapt from branch to branch, making its way past the cabin, then simply looking out at the winter landscape.
After a brief hesitation he turned his back to make his way to the entrance hall so that he could Apparate out. Once he was back at his cabin he flinched at the look of contempt that Vince turned his way.
Draco snorted. “You’re forgetting the other point. That person would need to actually have an interest in helping me stay alive. That’s rather a short list. At this point I’m fairly certain that list only includes you and my mother, and I’ve got her ensconced away in a townhouse in Bristol. She’s not coming anywhere near here, and she knows absolutely nothing that could help with this project.”
The man just shook his head. “No, I won’t be able to for awhile yet. I’m too keyed up now that you’re awake and walking around. I’ll probably pass out in a few hours and not wake up for a week.”
So with that safe topic selected they made their way back along what was turning into a path with their regular use of the same route through the trees, as Draco described the end-of-winter activities when living in a forest.
suggested one of these places,” he said, gesturing around them. And sure enough they were surrounded by partitioned-off sections of tables, most empty at this late hour but the lights that were strung up on the overhangs were still lit up, and he could smell the aromas of grilling seafood coming from somewhere nearby.
He didn’t know what to say. Her words were so different from anything he’d imagined her to say, so different from the calculated guilt-inducing letters she regularly wrote that he couldn’t respond.
A bright flash of lightning streaked across the sky, followed by a rumble of thunder a few seconds later.
He was faintly aware of Potter murmuring something in his ear, the little puffs of air brushing against cheek and neck. But there were no words, only the rumble that travelled from his chest as he spoke, his embrace surrounding Draco with an anchoring warmth. Needing to feel and not think Draco clutched onto him tighter and sought his lips, letting out a pitiful whine that at any other time would have brought him shame but at this moment he only cared about
"I don’t remember it,” She pursed her lips, the air turning more and more awkward. “But yes, apparently, that’s where he…” She drew a breath in, shrugging. “All I remember is just green light, and that’s pretty much it, so…”
"Fine, but I warned you, I hope you remember how I was right while you ride the train home tomorrow—hey!”
It took Persephone a moment to look at their costumes (?) to realize these were probably not the same kind of ghosts she sometimes saw on Scooby-Doo. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: "Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance--"
"I... don't... want... her... t-t-to come!" Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. "She always sp- spoils everything!" He shot Persephone a nasty grin through the gap in his mother's arms.
Mr. Malfoy’s lip curled, “I have yet to be visited. The Malfoy name still commands a certain amount of respect but the Ministry still grows ever more meddlesome. There are rumors about a new Muggle Protection Act—no doubt that flea-bitten, Muggle-loving fool Arthur Weasley is behind it—”
"You haven't got a letter on yours," George observed. "I suppose she thinks you don't forget your name. But we're not stupid—we know we're called Gred and Forge."
“I’m gonna go upstairs and see if my uniform still fits,” She said simply, leaving the table. This was a lie, being as she had tried it one last night.
She was now spending all her free time in the library now that she had no rehearsals to get to. Flitwick was visibly glum and depressed and no matter how many of his theatre students sent him gift baskets, he would no cheer up. She was hoping with the approaching holidays, some happiness would come about. Hermione and Ron joined her in the library most times, in search of Flamel. Usually, however, Persephone got distracted and accidently got into reading something with no correlation to Flamel.
“Alright!” She raised her fist just as the door opened. Filch was standing on the other side and behind him, Snape was flinching, holding his robes over his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Snape had bandages in his hands, muttering something about, “…you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads…”
“You cheated for him?” Persephone hissed at her, turning back to stare in shock. “Why would you do that!?”
Malfoy seemed scared of her as they walked. He walked on the other side of the dog, trying hard not meet Persephone’s eyes. Her eyes had flashed dangerous, silver again. Her hair had shone in the moonlight, a beautiful silvery blonde that flowed down to her waist, almost floating around her.
Persephone was bent over the sink, pulling her hair back, gasping into it. She finally looked up, staring at Myrtle through the mirror, “And then?”
"No!" Hermione Granger shouted. "Madam Hooch told us not to move—you'll get us all into trouble. Besides, you don’t even know how to fly! You saw what happened to Neville, you won’t last five seconds!"
“And if Hermione’s the only one of your friends who knows that you’ve been meeting up with me. . . .”
That night he once again was unable to get comfortable in his chair, and fell asleep in the clearing.
“You’ve set aside my history for now, since there are other things that you see here that hold your interest. Other things to keep your mind occupied. But once you cease to be surprised by the way that I’m living my life, you’ll remember that I used to be a bully, and that I said and did horrible things to you, and your friends, and pretty much everyone, and that I was a Death Eater, and—”
He ran a hand over his chin, his fingers combing through his beard. He tilted his head and considered, then said, “Well, Vince, she was certainly in a mood when she wrote this one. So much guilt that she forgot that mentioning
He snorted. “What, carve a tub from rock? Or what, wood? I’m not going to chop down a thousand-year-old tree for something wide enough to make a decent one.
Draco released the nipple and caught Potter’s mouth once again, raising his hands to cup the man’s jaw, ignoring his aching cock for more of the man’s taste.
Kreacher’s eyes widened slightly after he mentioned the Manor but he gave a swift nod and vanished. A few minutes later he reappeared with a small pop, producing a trunk.
Draco knocked down the last of the ice and returned to the front door, feeling the bubble of warmth around the broom as he stepped up next to Potter. The man had particularly windswept hair, as if he’d flown in instead of Apparating.
A tension that he didn’t realise he’d been carrying since he woke up suddenly dissolved and he let out a harsh exhale, looking down at his hands. “And what did she demand of you, to agree to that?”
“I—” He didn’t know what to say. Thousands of moments were flying through his mind from their countless stops. The use of his name. The touching. The shirtlessness. The insistence on taking care of their meals. The time spent together, even though they weren’t required to do anything more than attend meetings and actually complete the travel portion of the assignment in each other’s presence. The unnecessary kindness. The care taken to not return to the ways of the past.
Draco gave him a nod then opened his door, stepping inside a moment later. It wasn’t until he had a portion of bone broth bubbling on the wood stove that he heard the crack of Disapparition from outside.
Draco threaded his hands into his mane of hair and held his head, eyes closed, trying to calm his breathing. As much as he hated to admit it, he was just going to hurt himself if he continued in this weather. Especially if Potter insisted on continuing his yelling and distracting him, which of course he would.
Weasley finally looked away from Draco and instead focused on her, his expression one of bewilderment. “
“Potter,” he said slowly, and when that didn’t get a response he reached over and grabbed his empty hand, clasping it tightly. It was cool, slightly clammy, though whether from nerves, lack of sleep, or a combination of the two he wasn’t sure. “Potter,” he repeated, “leave Hermione to me. As far as I’m concerned you did what you were there to do. You kept an eye on what was happening, and you got me to safety when things went wrong. Thank you.”
Draco shrugged and replied, “I have no issue with that. We’ll probably want to do that during the day so that we can make use of the daylight.”
Well, he certainly would have appreciated a little warning that they would be Apparating to the fucking Ministry.
“Yeah? Well when someone orders this many brooms and isn’t a Quidditch team, that makes it my business. Especially when that someone is
The infusion worked beautifully with the trunk, and there were no issues at all when they proceeded with their heat shielding tests. After that they continued with some tests of a Disillusionment Charm against some of the sensors that muggles would be using—Draco had no clue how Hermione managed to make the things work in the bowels of the Ministry, of all places—and determined that as long as the Atmospheric Charms didn’t extend outside of the trunk’s interior, the launch should remain undetected. Of course that prompted yet another theory-filled discussion of
It wasn’t a terrible way to start the day, he thought to himself some time later, his mouth slowly and leisurely swirling over the leaking tip of Potter’s erection, before abandoning it to nibble along his inner thigh. His mind felt wonderfully clear, not yet completely aware enough to begin to panic over anything. It was nice.
He dropped a wet kiss to the collarbone that was right there while he tried to hold onto his sanity, then with a twitch of his fingers he summoned his wand to his hand, a small part of him aware that there was something different about the grip but not caring as he then used it to summon whatever oil existed in the kitchen, dropping the length of wood again when a bottle slapped into his palm a few seconds later.
He could feel Potter working to get his breathing under control and he waited, until the man stood up straight behind him, leaning against his back, his arms still looped around his chest. “I’ll grab the brooms. How many?”
“And tomorrow is Sunday,” she continued when he didn’t respond, “so I’ll have the lab prepared for us with no interruptions. . . .”
After that, it was as though a switched had been flipped and they could hardly keep their eyes and hands off each other.
When he was done his hair felt silky smooth and was so long it reached the small of his back. Once he saw the difference in the mirror, he had the small thought that perhaps some of his reception around the Ministry wasn’t because of his past, but because he’d looked like a madman.
Draco tilted his head, assessing his response. It was almost instinctive, the need to rise to the challenge, to sneer, to say something cutting, to tear his old rival apart with words and a look. But it was all pointless, so he instead replied evenly, “That’s not against the terms of my probation. I’m allowed to order brooms. You and the other Aurors can ogle me at my next check-in, but I’ve done nothing wrong.”
Draco thought of the things he would be leaving behind, and though the answer didn’t come as easily anymore as it would have when he’d first contemplated the project, it was still there. “Yes.”
Hermione narrowed her eyes but Potter just snickered and shook his head. “Nah, he’s in Hufflepuff. Much more . . . rebellious than I ever was—he has far more friends to involve in his trouble, and the professors don’t even think to suspect him. Despite the fact that he was caught impersonating Flitwick on the first day of class.”
And it seemed that Potter also knew he was purposely being difficult because rather than fly off the handle he narrowed his eyes and took two steps closer until he was right in front of him.
They settled into a lighter conversation after that, with Potter asking plenty of questions about foraging, of all things, and that took them through until ten o’clock when a loud crack and a rapid knock announced the arrival of Hermione.
He shook his head, then muttered, “It doesn’t matter.” Still frowning, he turned to the kettle that was just beginning to whistle and set about making tea.
The next day Draco finished trimming his corner posts and on Wednesday he worked late into the night assembling the rectangular planks into a roof that he could install once the walls were built, only stopping when the bright quarter moon was directly overhead. Thursday brought terrible weather but also a horrid day of classes about muggle festive celebrations, during which they were required to sing, so rather than stay in from the freezing mess he immediately set to work upon returning home.
He let his head fall forward, gripping the edge of the counter. “You can’t expect me to believe that,” he said shortly.
Draco rolled his eyes again and chucked a fresh towel at the idiot then popped the kettle on the stove, preparing two mugs.
“I’ll need to get going, I’m afraid. I’ve got a meeting starting in half an hour and I’ll need to grab some things from my office first. Draco, will you want to do some heat shield testing in my lab this Sunday?”
“I have an Arithmancy mastery and an MSc in Physics, I do research as a profession, and I have access to a secure testing facility,” she answered promptly, then gave him a pleasant smile.
“Well if you don’t hack pieces off of the brooms. . . . Yeah, you should probably be able to. If I can adjust the tamper-proofing to allow it.”
Potter made a pained sort of sound, then retrieved a fresh broom from his bag. “I’ll need to get it prepped for your meddling. Go over there and don’t watch me for the next ten minutes.”
“Potter.” The other man had been watching him the entire time, a frown permanently affixed to his face. “Catch.”
Then again, even before things had come to a head in October, everything had been so surprisingly easy. Ever since they’d left on that first stop of their assignment, things had just . . . worked.
Potter frowned, and wouldn’t quite meet his gaze. “I dunno. But, er, just in case you do, the offer’s there.”
It wasn’t long before he heard the sounds of new voices from the floor below, though they were muffled enough that he couldn’t identify them. A short while later he heard a child-like shriek followed by peals of laughter, and he felt himself tensing, uncomfortable about the thought of so many people being in the house with him, with no possibility of escape.
That brought some sense back into him. Potter reached into his robes, making him tense slightly, but he didn’t pull out his wand. An instant later he was brandishing a letter. Draco narrowed his eyes as he caught a glimpse of some of the writing.
Once they arrived at the clearing Potter immediately made for his rock, then made a sound in his throat. “It’s still warm,” he noted, then felt the surface of the stone. “Not even melted snow on it. It’s dry.” He sat down.
He realised that Potter wasn’t the only one struggling to breathe steadily so he focused hard on the other events of the day, finally managing to find words that weren’t dangerous.
She gave him a patient look. “Given the history that the two of you have, if Harry considers you worth helping, I think that I should probably listen to him. Don’t you think?”
Draco was removing the rest of the seed clusters from his pocket and dropping them into a bowl for peeling when Potter cleared his throat.
Those were too many words for Draco, and he frankly didn’t understand how Potter was able to form so many of them. He removed his fingers, slicked up his cock with a few pulls, then slid inside with one sharp thrust.
Two days later found Draco sitting on his front step stripping bark from a wide piece of wood, after he’d determined from Vince’s sulking that the owl would be sheltering indoors that winter. He’d already trimmed and smoothed a branch for the stand and the perch, and just needed to turn this last piece into a base for it to be ready for the season. He’d also need to set up a tray to catch any pellets and droppings but he should have time enough for that.
would be, then Potter let out a ragged sigh, running his hand through his hair. “Look—you almost died. I thought you
Saturday, he awoke far too early, and after a few hours of trying to talk himself out of it he grabbed the last bottle of birch sap beer and Apparated to number twelve, Grimmauld Place.
Because beyond the troll leg and the house-elf heads there was also what appeared to be a family of stuffed puffskeins, a case full of doxies that looked like they’d been plucked or shaved, a mounted niffler, and what looked frighteningly like an erumpent head, most alarmingly still with its horn intact.
Draco took in the tension in his neck, the almost feverish brightness in his eyes, the grim set of his mouth, and bit his lip, thinking over their few options. Then he caught the way Potter’s gaze dropped down, lured by the movement of his mouth, then the slight flush that rose on his cheeks when he found himself caught. Draco cleared his throat and said, “We’ll both go.”
Mercifully, Potter retreated to his loveseat to finish his tea and Draco could breathe. A few minutes later, after Draco had returned to his chair and been looking out the window, Potter broke the silence by sharing a story about the emergency order of brooms that he’d needed to bring to Diagon Alley half an hour before closing on Christmas Eve, because of a toddler’s outburst of accidental magic incinerating half the shop when there was still a queue of last-minute shoppers.
“She wanted to be reintroduced to Andromeda. Apparently, she hasn’t reached out in all this time because it
Potter blinked a few times, his hand come up to his hair, and stammered, “Er, tomorrow. Sunday roast at the Weasleys’. Well, and yesterday too.”
After a final hour of flight he landed and tossed the sad-looking broom over to Potter, then said, “That’ll be all for today,” before returning to his cabin.
There was a pause as Potter took another gulp of port, then resumed his retelling of the events. “I was probably about eighty feet away from you at that point and the brooms were pretty slow in the water, so I Apparated to you. And you were completely out, so I disengaged your Sticking Charms and Apparated you to St Mungos. Then I had to yell a bunch to get you seen right away, since you didn’t even look like you were
He blinked a few times, clearly missing something. “If you have somewhere you’d rather be, don’t put that on me. I have no issue with you being present, as should be abundantly clear by this point.”
Their testing generated some results that they could work with, as one of the infusions when paired with the heat protections they’d previously attempted was effective up to nearly three thousand degrees, a temperature so high it seemed utterly ridiculous. Under the supervision of Hermione they then proceeded to apply the rest of the adjustments that they’d established to date and when that didn’t have any adverse effects on the efficacy of the heat protection they concluded that portion of the enchantments complete.
He heard her walk over in the direction that he’d indicated, and for a few minutes there was the clinking sound of her inspecting his creations.
that was present when Harry moved here. And other things that surface when the house feels like antagonising him.”
Potter was worrying his lip and his face was set in a deep frown. “You need to take care of yourself, Draco.”
All too soon he felt Potter tense, his hips straining away from the wall as his fingers tightened further in Draco’s hair, and he heard a strangled, “Malfoy, I’m—I’m almost—” He swiped his tongue over the sensitive tip then groaned as the man’s hips began to jerk, swallowing down the warm come while a muffled cry sounded above him. A few more pumps of his fist and he found his own climax, screwing his eyes shut at the intensity of it, before gently releasing the softening cock from his mouth and resting his forehead against Potter’s quivering thigh.
It was interesting, diving into the waters with the bubble of charms around him. He could see that his head was contained within a sphere of air, and the warmth circulating through the larger space around the entire broom remained constant. Manoeuvring the broom, on the other hand, was a different matter entirely; it was slow to accelerate, slow to turn, slow to respond in general.
Several minutes later the tingling sensation of a Cleaning Charm swept through his pants and he opened his eyes, carefully rising to his feet. Potter was tucking himself away and doing up his flies, a soft smile playing about his lips.
They stood in silence for another minute, then there was movement next to him and a hand reached over and took his. He stopped breathing.
She finished up her tasks of decorating and beamed under her teacher’s praise. She hoped Hermione and Ron had found something.
Hermione and Ron were looking at her from then on, as if afraid she would go catatonic again as they walked out of the dungeons. She couldn’t pay them much attention with her sudden disability. She made it out of the dungeon use pure memory and decided to find her way to her dorm to grab her glasses. She would suffer through Pansy’s taunts to be able to see. She refused their help and went off on her own.
And then her anger vanished, as soon as it came. Because yes—yes she had experienced it. Thinking back—it was in Astronomy class and they’d been looking up at the sky. And she remembered it clearly—so clearly…she’d seen the full moon…
“Why don’t you sit down and collect your thoughts—” She was hoping to return to him later but that seemed rude. She pointed at the bench just as the elf burst into tears. Shocked and confused, she reached out, not knowing what to do.
"That Quidditch cup'll have our name on it this year," Wood said happily as they trudged back up to the castle. "I wouldn't be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn't gone off chasing dragons."
She blinked and was surprised to find tears slipping down her cheeks. She looked away, wiping her wet cheeks with her sleeve. "The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Persephone, and I ask you not to go looking for it again.”
“Meet you back here,” Ron said to Hermione as the Weasleys and Persephone were led off to their underground vaults by another Gringotts goblin.
“Only American in Hogwarts, mate,” George sighed, leaning against the wall, his hands on his knees as he recovered. “Haven’t seen you in class though.”
“Me?” She choked, almost laughing. “Me? With my books? There are more important things—friendship, courage, kindness and just—oh!” She sniffed. “No matter what anyone says, you…”
The twins weren’t the only one who stood up for her—Cedric Diggory from Hufflepuff had told off several people in the halls and turned to her, “Don’t worry, everything’ll be okay. You don’t deserve to be bullied like this.”
The classroom Potions was held in was in the dungeons. It was colder down there but Persephone had planned ahead for this class. She brought her uniform sweater to wear under her robes and she brought out her mother’s locket to wear over it. She had combed her hair into perfect waviness, even making sure it was wavy by concentrating on it in the mirror. She’d placed an emerald green headband on her head for the first time, to make sure her hair didn’t get into her eyes. It made her green eye pop and her red hair look redder.
She felt slightly out of place, standing in the Great Hall dressed in black as students passed by, passing her strange glances. She was burning red with this attention, until finally, Daphne Greengrass came to her rescue.
Climbing quite like an expert, the cat clawed her way over onto her shoulder, around her neck, and Persephone looked at the boy in help.  “No! No, Minnie, no!” The boy gasped, “Oh my god, oh my god, okay, hold on—MINERVA!” The cat didn’t seem to care, still being on Persephone’s back.
Okay, first: a whole different set of house variety. hermione in ravenclaw. Ron in Hufflepuff, Persephone in Slytherin. The twins in Slytherin as well.
She turned, her pointed witch’s hat on full display, and started to walk farther into the castle. The first years made no mistake in immediately following, obviously having acquired the same vibe off her as Persephone had.
George was the one who maneuvered her. She made a grab for the cage but could only lean as so much to the lock. If she tried any further, she would hurt Hedwig. She pulled a bobby pin out of her hair and pick the lock, reaching farther to do so. She reached out, unlocking the cage and he pulled her back in and she cleared her throat and whistled.
She was able to sit before she could faint and the ghost she sat opposite to patted her arm, and finally made her take a big breath at the sudden, horrible feeling she'd just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.
She first noticed it in Charms. Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Persephone’s name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.
The two made their way down to the Great Hall, or where they thought the Great Hall was, when Ron insisted they passed by a portrait twice. It didn’t help when the portraits could move from frame to frame. When they did find their way to the Great Hall, half the students had already been seated and chatting animatedly at all house tables. She caught Daphne’s eye and returned the blonde girl’s wave and smile.
"Ye' all get yer firs' sight o' Hogwarts in a sec," Hagrid called over his shoulder, "jus' round this bend here."
“By those filthy Christian muggles who believed the power of the heavens would save them for killing our children!” Salazar bellowed. “And yet we allowed for their children to step foot in our sacred school!”
He probably didn’t hear her right but she didn’t blame him. He looked very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling.
She wasn’t fooling Persephone, who stared blankly at Hermione, who started to blush. She wasn’t the only witch blushing—the entire crowd was made up of mostly witches, with a few wizards dotted around, were all flushed with excitement and at how hot the shop was with how many people were inside.
He chuckled, but it was a dark laugh, “You foolish girl, he is never parted from me. He is always there, wherever I may go,” He said quietly. “I met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it...Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me."
“Yeah right,” Fred crossed his arms, smirking in amusement. “What can we help with, young Lily pad?”
It wasn’t just ballet—it was an assortment of different dances. Hip-hop, contemporary, ballroom, waltz, swing—it was a lot of fun. It was a class Persephone greatly looked forward to, though unfortunately it only came every second day.
He glanced at her with a dark, sardonic look, “I turn into the abominable snowman.” She narrowed her eyes, giving him a look. He rolled his eyes, “Usually? I don’t know because I don’t remember. Violence isn’t completely off but I don’t wolf out if that’s what you’re asking. Not completely—fangs are a thing, I think, claws are optional. Other than that…” He shrugged.
“I guess,” She sighed. “I’m starved.” She jumped down from the ledge and underestimated the height. She fell on her knees and Hades laughed.
The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Persephone shivered in the cold night air, or in her nerves, and crossed her arms to keep warm. A lamp was bobbing over the heads of the students, and Persephone was thrilled to hear a familiar voice: "Firs' years! Firs' years over here! All right there, Sephie?"
Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Persephone followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall.
“What is wrong with the sky?” She started walking towards what she thought was north, still staring at the red dot that could only be Mars, until a good way in, she bumped into something.
“Don’t know…?” Ben said. “Why don’t you get on your broom and follow him?” He said, smirking. She was halfway doing this already and he blinked in surprise, “I didn’t mean that—no wait, I seriously was kidding.”
"Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?"
Filch was accompanied by his cat, luckily. It took a few moments for them both to notice the cakes—muttering happily to himself, he picked up the cakes. The six listened as he said, “Lucky night, my sweet.”
“Hmm…” She pursed her lips, “Usually, I’d let you, maybe even join you, but its dance. I don’t want to be late.”
Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor, but Persephone could hardly care, as now, she’d just lost the snitch.
A moment of silence, before Percy said slowly, “I show not your face but your heart’s desire.” Persephone tore her eyes from her father to look at him skeptically.
She gestured to the row of deep trays as she spoke, and everyone shuffled forward for a better look. A hundred or so tufty little plants, purplish green in color, were growing there in rows. As they did so, Professor Sprout called for them to take a pair of earmuffs.
It took a good few moments before the boy was able to get ‘Minerva’ off Persephone and an immensely long time of him apologizing. She was now able to get a good enough look at the boy, and he definitely looked older than her. He had dark, now messy hair and steel, prominent gray eyes. His cheekbones were so nicely sculpted—and by sculpted, she meant they were so nicely prominent—that she couldn’t help but staring in envy.
It was that boy from Ollivander’s. His hair was the same dark and curly and his face was still pale—his eyes were intense colors of gold that she didn’t quite remember. What was his name? Benjamin?
Excitement surged through her veins. That was one of the first bits of information she’d gotten properly out of him without any meanness in his voice.
She hadn’t spoken to Ben—Hades?—since she’d found out about the trashing of the play production. It was an obvious crime—he hadn’t wanted her to perform so he trashed it. What really sealed the deal? The amount of hexes and jinxes placed on the entire room. Should anyone stay in there too long, their vision would become blurry and their voices would dissipate with an awful flu. It wasn’t terrible dark magic but if anyone was capable of dark magic, it was him. She glared at him when she caught his eye when she was with Cedric and a few other Hufflepuffs. He was walking over, waving to her but when he’d seen her glare, he stopped. He did well in avoiding her from then on. She wasn’t sure she wouldn’t smack him for his crimes.
He could hear the smile in the man’s voice when he replied, “He’s two years old. That’s normal when you’re not his parent.”
“No worries. Ron convinced Susan that she didn’t need to barge up here and investigate, or call in her bloody partner. Luna left with the three of them about ten minutes ago. Elliott’s been loitering in the front hall—is he heading home with you today?”
Draco ran a finger along his length, then slid this thumb along his slit, a full-body shudder running through him as he promptly gave a few firmer strokes, feeling himself hardening further.
“It was,” Draco agreed, then with a sneer he added, “but they couldn’t be bothered to release me after the ten years. I didn’t get out until the last week of December.”
“Agreed. I’ve also prepped that one for Sticking Charms, and further . . . assault.” The man reddened slightly as he averted his gaze, then stalked back toward the rock.
At worst he could increase the potency of some topical sun-protection potions, though that wasn’t ideal. He was glad that he’d continued his research into the topic of radiation, however; he hadn’t realised just how powerful such a thing was, and the thought of flying through space and not being prepared for it. . . .
“If you let me know soon I can probably find a nice branch for it. Otherwise, you’ll need to make do.”
“It suits you,” Potter said suddenly, either five or twenty-five minutes later. Draco looked up, and the man gave a vague sort of gesture toward his head, likely indicating his beard or his hair or possibly both.
When he left class it was overcast but dry, and he returned home to find Potter sitting on his front step, the broom with the green bow lying across his lap.
He huffed a quiet laugh before he could even think about it. “Of course not. We haven’t killed each other yet.”
Potter snorted and looked up at him, his expression shifting from one of anxiety to one more open and hopeful while his hand that wasn’t clutching the apple slipped into a pocket.
“Seemed about the same as the broom,” Potter continued, gesturing. “I did a few comparisons while I waited.”
Potter made a strange expression in response then pulled a broom from his expanded pouch and handed it over, before shuffling off toward his rock.
They ate in silence, and Draco surprised himself by accepting a second helping after he tasted how hearty it was, and realising that he hadn’t eaten since far too early in the morning. He was just letting his eyes slide shut in contentment after his final mouthful when he heard Potter push his chair back from the table and stand.
His hand was messing his hair up even further, and bits of melting ice that the drying charm had missed went spraying around the cabin. “Well what else could it be?” he demanded, his arm gesticulating wildly. “Because if you try to tell me you’re just trying to advance innovation, or some such rot, you know I won’t believe you.”
“I really don’t care how much you argue about this, Malfoy, you’re living with me for the next month. I was pretty sure that Hermione was going to kill me, and if you don’t have someone watching you she said she’s going to take action. I don’t think that either of us want to know what that means.”
The food was delicious. Of course it was. Other than the horrid habit Potter had of smothering everything in spicy death whenever he had the opportunity—and fortunately he only ever committed that crime against his own portions, thank Merlin—he seemed to have a good grasp of Draco’s tastes. Though that shouldn’t have been surprising at any point, given how obsessive the two of them had been about each other at Hogwarts.
What was surprising was Potter hadn’t once been petty or vindictive enough to deliberately order Draco something he wouldn’t like.
“Yeah. I’ll need to remove them in a specific order, and it’ll be best if we work on removing one and then adding one charm at a time, instead of removing all of them in one go, but there shouldn’t be a problem. It might take a bit of time on the first broom though until I get a feel for it.”
Draco sighed and tilted his head back toward the sky, allowing the snow to fall onto his face. “I explained why I don’t even think it’s worth a discussion. I’m not the sort of person that people want to help. However much they may claim to only be interested in the work, or to be forgiving, no one wants to look past my history.”
She was tapping her biro against her lip, her brow furrowed. “Yes, but I think some of the missile defence systems use sensors that rely on infrared, or other inputs apart from simply a visual. We’ll need to test a few different methods of cloaking against those sensors.”
“Er, sorry about your clothes. But also I’m not sorry at all,” he said with a grin, and Draco rolled his eyes.
“You know, I’m surprised you’re enchanting the air around the broom to be warmer. I thought you wanted protection from heat?” Potter said in a too-casual tone.
There was a sigh. “I don’t, no, but it’s the truth. He trusts me, and he knows that I trust you, so he’s willing to give you the benefit of the doubt. And if Ron can keep his cool, then the others definitely can. I’d . . . like you to join us next Saturday.”
“Oh, funny,” the man replied, rolling his eyes before stepping in close and pressing a lingering kiss to Draco’s mouth.
“The photos,” Draco said quietly once he managed to find his words. “When we get back, and you do whatever you need to do to get them off of this thing. . . . Can I have a copy?”
Something inside him smirked a little, but he simply replied, “I need to keep stirring this until it’s done. Tell me about the flight charms, and how they’re layered with the braking charms.”
Draco finished the second hole as Potter rounded the corner, so he took a few minutes to smooth a few relatively straight branches with his knife, cutting away the little twigs and any remaining leaves.
Somewhere behind him he could hear Potter swallowing hard, likely having knocked back what was left of his drink.
He felt Potter’s huff more than he heard it, then the sensation of a whisper in his ear made him shiver. “I told you that weeks ago.”
He felt his throat tighten. “I’m not certain yet. Potter and I can probably meet you in the Atrium,” he said, hoping the words didn’t sound as strangled as they felt.
“‘Mione, it’s been ages,” Potter said, his voice muffled. They broke apart and he looked down at the thermos she was still clutching, then asked, “Oh wow is that coffee? Yes
Finally, the man groaned. “All right. You can have your brooms on one condition. Any experiments need to be done under the supervision of Nimbus personnel in case there’s any sort of inquiry later on.”
It was very still for a moment, very tense, then Draco couldn’t contain his derisive snort. “I may have the Trace, but I don’t plan on casting anything punishable, don’t you worry.”
he was coming apart, but it was too late, he was in too deep, and with that realisation he was suddenly coming harder than he knew was possible, the beautiful man wringing every drop of come from him.
There was sleet each day, accompanied by biting cold winds, keeping him for the most part indoors. By Thursday he was seriously contemplating teaching himself to knit, and he had re-read his science books enough times that he could almost quote many of the more interesting chapters. On Friday he decided to give the inside of his cabin a thorough cleaning and painstakingly scrubbed every stone and every log until not a speck of dust or down remained.
Shrugging, he gathered his notes and made his way downstairs, eventually finding him in the drawing room.
He turned to the other owl and said simply, “No response.” Then he rose and went to grab a bowl of the stew he’d set to bubble away several hours earlier, ignoring the bird’s annoyed screeches as it flew away.
But he did notice that they were both suddenly completely naked, and that Potter had slid to the floor in front of the sofa and dropped his mouth to Draco’s cock.
Draco raised his eyebrows. “Aren’t you supposed to be here supervising me to make sure I don’t try to kill myself?”
Potter said something more, but he couldn’t identify any words in the sounds. He could only feel the relief of the pressure, the warmth of the firm touch, the tension that was bleeding out of the soles of his feet into the kitchen floor.
“Not my fault you were a spoiled prat and never had to make your own fun with a football when you were bored.”
Draco shook his head, then watched as the man conjured one before withdrawing platters of food from a bag inside his cloak.
“I know. Two more weeks and we’ll be back home, and you’ll be able to stretch your wings in the woods rather than the city.”
“Wish I could fuck your mouth too,” Harry says breathlessly. “Fill you all the way up.” Without thinking Draco drops his mouth open, arching up into Harry as best he can with the restraints. Harry snorts softly, then places two fingers into Draco’s mouth, pressing down hard on his tongue. Draco lets his jaw drop obligingly, feeling spit pool around Harry’s fingers until he slides them out again. Wetness lingers on his skin as Harry runs his fingers back down to Draco’s nipple, brushing across it lightly. Pressure is building deep in Draco’s stomach, kept at bay by the magical tightness around his cock, and he flicks his head to the side, suddenly feeling like every touch is too intense, too hard, too
“Okay, you have to be careful.” Harry shows Draco how to plug in the toaster, and even once they have perfectly brown toast Draco is still sulking, staring down at his plate.
Pepper chirps and leaps off his lap, leaving Harry with his head in his hands. He supposes this should come as a shock, or some sort of sudden rush of panic, but it doesn’t; all he feels is the butterflies that seem to have taken up permanent residence in his stomach. He really tried to tell himself that his crush on Draco wasn’t anything substantial, but that was before he dealt with months of Draco with a rat’s nest of bed head every morning. That was before they became close enough for casual touching, laying gentle fingertips to waists as they move around each other in the kitchen while cooking together. That was before he learnedthat the best way to wind Draco down when he gets anxious about work is to sit with Draco’s feet in his lap and rub the arches until Draco falls asleep, usually within three minutes.
“You hurt me really badly,” Harry says. “But not because the answer is no. Because you didn’t give us a chance to work it out. You– you’ve never done anything like this, and I thought you wouldn’t come back. I thought you weren’t going to come back and give us the chance to fix it.” Draco sobs again, his body jerking, and Harry holds him closer. “But we can figure it out. If you still want. We can be together for my entire lifetime without getting married and I’d be happy, because it’s you. I don’t need a ring to know how much you love me.”
Gravel crunches as Brennan strides forward into the driveway, his fists clenched in the weak streetlight, but Draco casually holds up his wand. “Nah,” Draco says as he continues to drag his key around to the trunk, pacing slowly like a jungle cat. “You and I both know what you did to Harry.”
“Hi, Pepper,” Draco is saying, his voice rounded and sweet in a way Harry has never heard. “How are you? How was your day?” A long silence, then– “I hear you, I hear you. That sounds like very important cat business.” His voice trails off into unintelligible, soft murmurs.
“No!” Harry’s palms hit the table, jostling the takeout containers and a jar of biros. Huffing, Draco crosses his arms and leans back in his chair. “You don’t– you don’t want to hang out with people in case they start caring about you? Well too bad, I already do. I’m here whether you like it or not.
“Wonder why it feels better to touch,” Harry muses, one hand loose on the steering wheel. They’re passing into Wyoming now.
Harry sets a steady, slow pace, working his finger until I’m blinking away stars. His dick drags against my own and the sensation is so good, I want more. I want
“Nothing,” Draco replies, a knee jerk reaction, but then his traitorous mouth just keeps going. “Well. You rejecting me. Or, you
“An untruth for you, then.” Harry smiles softly, flashing a dimple. “No one wants to kiss you right now.”
“Well–” Harry swallows audibly. “It’s just, you always seem so uncomfortable when we’re together outside of work. Pub nights and such, you know? And yeah–” Harry waves his hand above him, a vague shape in the darkness. “I know you get anxious in crowded places. Which is why I asked you on a picnic, because I just thought, oh, I’d like to spend more time with you in a place that doesn’t make you anxious, because now that we’re not trying to kill each other you really are rather brilliant. We make– we make a good team, so I just thought– well, it doesn’t matter. You said what you said.”
“Move,” I growl, bucking my body up.Before I realize what’s happening Harry’s got both hands under my thighs, lifting them up until I’m nearly bent in half as his hands cradle my legs. Muscles ripple under his skin and I grab the base of my cock, squeezing tightly, begging myself not to come.
“But hey,” Harry says, too casual, his eyes finally bright but in all the wrong ways. “If you’re saying we're not friends, then who am I to argue? You didn’t stick around last time to hear me out, so I doubt you will now.”
“I want to be tied down and– and spanked across your knees,” Draco repeats, less confidently. Harry eases down to the floor right in front of Draco and stares unblinkingly at him.
“I like that,” Draco whispers, and it sounds like a secret when they’re curled up under the sheets together.
“Now you may get in bed,” Draco says, and Harry sways toward him, resting his forehead on Draco’s shoulder.
“You.” Draco thrashes as Harry yanks his hips up, pulling the ankle restraints tighter, and wraps a hand around Draco’s cock. “Oh fuck, Harry, oh god,
“Well,” Harry says, running his hands down Draco’s arms, giddiness bubbling up in his chest. “I do. I do.”
“Medium,” Draco says, because he doesn’t want too much pain today, but he also doesn’t want only softness. “But I want you to
“Why are you here, Draco?” Harry asks, close enough now that Draco can smell him. Sharp and clean, like a fresh cut pine tree.
“C’mon,” Harry says softly, “c’mon, Draco. Baby. You’re the hottest man I’ve ever seen, Merlin, look at you.
Draco bounces on Harry’s cock, their shoulders pulled back proud and taut due to the cuffs. They flip their head again, then again, scowling as locks of hair continue to fall around their shoulders.
Draco recalls the moment perfectly– three and a half weeks ago, blindsided by Harry’s question, knowing he isn’t good enough for the offer, knowing he’ll give his affection away if he doesn’t have work or other people as a shield. He recalls panicking, throwing up every wall he has. His own mouth wrapped around the words
“Mhm,” Draco says, because he’s willing to try. His hands are shaking with long-suppressed affectation, and it makes him want to try. “I really do.”
“I need you!” Magic cracks around you, ozone tinted burning, and Draco staggers back, the neat line of his body crumpling, shuddering, becoming human
“Get a move on before we’re scoped by pirates. Also, you’re giving me your entire life story and a reason to trust you while we cruise.”
“You weren’t even paying attention to him,” Harry scoffs, and Draco presses himself fully against Harry’s side for a moment. Harry forces himself to take a deep breath in.
“Let’s go home,” Harry interrupts, pressing a kiss to Draco’s temple. “We’ll figure it out at home, love.”
“Ow– ow, that hurts,” Draco cries out as Harry yanks his head back with the fingers curled in his hair. “Stop, I don’t want this, I’ll
“It’s not me,” I retort, shoving past him back into the living quarters. “Take it up with the ISRC.” Draco glares at me until I crack a grin. “Intergalactic Spaceship Regulation Committee.”
“I am not a kid!” I yell, throwing my hands up and nearly clocking Harry in the nose. “I’m pretty sure we’re the same age!”
.” Draco bites Harry’s chin, then yelps as Harry bucks up and flips them over until Harry’s leaning above him, grinning. “
“Don’t,” Harry says quietly, suddenly exhausted. “Draco, just don’t, okay? We’re almost to your flat.”
“Oh.” Rejection shouldn’t hurt this much, but Harry’s heartbeat is in his fingers. “No, I get it, I just thought since we talked at work you’d maybe… It's okay. Really.” Harry laughs a bit, waving his hand easily, looking anywhere but Draco.
“That’s what the book is for. It explains… safety, and pressure points, and safewords. How to…” Draco waves his hands vaguely, leaving Harry’s palms empty. “Be risk-aware. That’s the term. I know you won’t hurt me.”
“That’s good.” Harry grunts as he sits up, then starts unbuckling each of Draco’s cuffs. After each one he rubs his hands gently across Draco’s skin, leaving gentle kisses after his fingers are gone. He bites at Draco’s ankle after the last cuff, smirking when Draco kicks out halfheartedly.
“I’m drunk,” Draco says, even though he isn’t– he just wants Harry to hold him. “Side-Along me.” He’s wrapped up in the smell of warm leather and winter before the tug of Apparition overtakes them. They land in the sitting room of Harry’s flat, and Draco stumbles a bit before looking around. “Nice paintings.”
“You help me pick outfits for my dates,” Draco exclaims, dropping his head down into the crook of Harry’s neck. “You seem so happy whenever someone asks me out!”
Harry finishes with the flannel and leaves again to put it away, tucking himself under the covers as soon as he comes back. Draco struggles to pull the sheets over himself without getting off the bed and Harry snorts, watching him wiggle around.
,” Hedwig states, and Draco nearly jumps out of his seat. I snort and pull my seatbelt on over my shoulders. After a moment, I nod at Draco’s seatbelt.
“Oh,” I breathe, unable to speak for how unbearably hot that is, to have someone turned on by my pleasure at their hands. Harry’s fingers remain still inside me, filling me up, and I think about his hands flying across the ship’s console, capable and strong. “Fuck, Harry, I want– I want your dick
He sits tentatively back down into his chair, and I sit in mine. He looks at me for a long moment, really
“Choose a toy, then.” I nudge his hands away and strip my shirt off, clambering back onto the bed fully naked except for the harness. Draco skates his fingers over the three toys in the box, finally pulling out the thinnest but longest one. It sparkles blue and purple against his palm, and his eyes crinkle up in the corners with the force of his smile.
He’s so fucking tired of watching Harry, day in and day out, working next to him; of catching the flickers of Harry’s powerful magic out of the corner of his eye. He’s tired of knowing how Harry’s curls get bouncier in humidity, and how he’ll drink his coffee black but only before ten in the morning, and how he tries so hard even for people who don’t try for him.
“Draco, I want to stop pretending,” Harry says, and Draco steps back again, jerkier this time, trying to breathe through the ache in his chest. Setting his jaw, Harry follows, reaching across the space between them, and Draco freezes. Harry’s hand on Draco’s waist is intimately familiar, but the burning light in his eyes is not. “I want to
. They work better than Draco ever expected or could have imagined. Harry is kind, and funny, and sharp in all the right ways. He’s not afraid to stand up to Draco, and in turn Draco finds himself letting Harry see his softness, his vulnerabilities.
A man can insult me all he wants but my ship is where I draw the line. I turn away from him, fingers flying across the helm controls, finishing the prep for the stabilizers and engines. Hedwig isn’t fully automated, she
“Cheaper rent,” Harry replies, wiggling his way across the sofa nearly into Draco’s lap. “Companionship. My good eggs. The way I make hot chocolate. The fact that I know how to do laundry. The way I rub your feet when you’re tired–”
“You’re going to come, pet. You’re going to come with my cock buried inside of you, and my come running down your legs, and it won’t matter that you said no, because you’re mine.”
“Poor– poor Savior.” Draco presses his eyes shut, but he just keeps talking. “What kind of guilt will you have, now that you’ve done this? Don’t worry,” Draco laughs, his flippancy jarring. “I don’t matter. This doesn’t matter. Just another thing for you to– mmph!”
I drape a hand across his waist, loosening one of the harness straps. Once Harry catches on he helps me, divesting himself of the strap-on. He slides off the bed to set it back into the white box it came from, and then he stands next to the bed, watching me. Seeing him like this, all at once, sends blood rushing back down to my soft cock, so I take my time looking him over– the dark hair on his legs, his thick thighs, his clever hands and his teasing smirk.
“Draco?” Harry says, and I startle before sliding into the bed. He follows close behind, and a softly spoken, “Lights down, Hedwig,” sinks the room into darkness. The bed is big enough that we’re not touching, but I can feel Harry’s warmth, like he keeps all his energy right beneath his skin. “Hey, don’t kill me in my sleep, alright?”
“Don’t wanna,” Harry murmurs into Draco’s jaw, his breath warm. “God, I want you, I love you. Baby.” Draco shivers as Harry’s lips ghost further down and nuzzle underneath the collar of Draco’s jumper. “Baby, baby, let me–”
“I– It’s just, a really bad night, you know, and I was hoping you would– you would come down, eventually, and I know I shouldn’t have bothered you if you were actually sleeping well for once, but I didn’t know– what to do.” Draco’s eyes are wild and bright; as she talks, the lace on her sleeves flutters in an ephemeral echo of her frantic hands.
“I thought… that we’re friends? Not– not great friends, but…” Harry trails off, looking so young and desperate for a moment that Draco grabs Harry’s hand and squeezes just once before letting go.
The sirens are screaming all around me, and my heart is going to beat itself out of my chest in the next thirty seconds if I don’t get off this ship.
“Fuck,” I say, staring at his profile as he stares at the dildo. His words burrow somewhere behind my heart, seeds of something I can already tell will blossom beautifully with time. “Wow. C’mere.” He hands me his chosen toy and sets the box down on the floor next to the bed as I situate the toy in the harness and pull the straps tight, my breath catching a bit as my cock presses up against the material. Once Draco’s situated underneath my thighs again, I run my hands down his side, marvelling at his smooth skin, pale as starlight. I flick a thumb across his nipple and he whines, arching his back off the bed.
– makes something strange and possessive twist up in Draco’s chest. He doesn’t want anyone else to know what it’s like to be called
Draco takes a step back at that, pinned down by Harry’s intense gaze. “I– I,” he says helplessly. “How did you know I...”
“Don’t let that shirt wrinkle,” Harry says firmly, and Draco sees the words for what they are– Harry knowing Draco will be upset later at his own lack of care. Draco carefully folds the shirt, bending over to set it next to his feet. When he stands back up again, his hand landing on his belt buckle, Harry speaks again.
Obviously he’s attractive– I knew that the moment I saw him, with his long legs and slim waist and brightly intelligent eyes. One night stands are familiar territory, when I have the whole galaxy to explore, but I told myself he’s off limits since he’s relying on me right now, and that wouldn’t be fair. Physical attraction, I can handle. I can push it down and interact with Draco normally, even though sometimes he glances at me with a searching, unreadable expression.
Draco murmurs softly again and I grin. I learned the hard way that Draco is not a morning person, and it’s best to just let him wake up on his own. Sliding quietly out of the bed, I pad into the main living space, pulling a canister of coffee and a scratched plastic mug from the cabinet. Once it’s brewed and steaming, strong the way I always drink it, I go to the cockpit and check our course. Half-warp is slower than full warp but takes much less fuel, and isn’t as hard on the human body.
“Hah,” Draco huffs, and Harry thinks of his pale body limp in Harry’s arms, his toe barely touching the floor, the way he closed his eyes and
“I–” Harry blinks, looking bewildered. His curls are getting long, nearly covering his ears, and stick up in all directions. “I mean, I’ve only been in there a couple times, but don’t you need to unpack the rest of your boxes? It’s been a few months since you moved in.”
“You keep asking me that like I’m going to suddenly come up with an answer,” Draco replies with no bite. His eyes are bright today; he’s been looking better recently, able to walk further from Harry without getting shaky. Harry is trying not to think about what this means, because if the bond is weakening then his feelings should be too. Maybe it has to do with the magical imbalance– maybe the bond is releasing Draco faster, while Harry remains tied to him. “I don’t know. Magic is weird.”
. Draco glances across Harry’s chest, at the mess of burn and claw marks littered there and the faint, curved scars underneath the newer ones. Harry blinks down at him for a moment, his gaze searching and intense. “What words do you prefer?” Draco asks quietly, and Harry visibly softens. He slides off the bed, pulling down his trousers and stepping into the harness as he speaks.
“Come on, then,” Harry says immediately, opening the door wider. With so few eighth year students, they each get their own small room, and Harry’s desperately grateful for it right now, because every nerve in her body is screaming at her to
“Yeah,” Harry says, even though Draco never finished his sentence. “If you– if you want to turn over, and don’t mind me touching more of you, I can hold onto your hip. So you’re not uncomfortable.”
“See, it’s easier like this,” he murmurs, tracing his fingers down the knobs of Draco’s spine. “It’s easier when you just give in. When you let me take what’s mine.”
“Hey,” Harry says on an exhale. Draco startles. Harry had been breathing so deeply, Draco assumed he was asleep. “Are you alright?”
I shove his shoulder hard enough that he catches himself on his hands, laughing. “Maybe we fit together, then.”
Hedwig is technically a three person ship but she’s been modified to accommodate my solitude– the extra bunk rooms were sacrificed to a larger lounge space and extra storage. The captain's chair sits centered on the helm but I left the co-pilot’s chair intact. Draco settles there as I start prepping Hedwig for warp speed again. We’ve been drifting for a bit but haven’t used too much fuel, which is good.
something Harry will ever tell him. Instead, Harry just judges Draco’s boyfriends very, very harshly, because he’s a bit jaded and Draco deserves the world.
“But I love you and don’t want you to be sticky,” Harry says as he reaches out to wrap his hand around Draco’s thigh. Draco’s expression goes soft, and he sits down beside Harry. As he starts to undo the ties on his chest, he picks up that same rhythm as before. Slide, release, wrap. Each touch of his fingertips brings up flashes of Harry’s memory, like an afterimage: Draco bouncing on Harry’s cock, a wet mouth pressed hard to Harry’s shoulder, soft hands everywhere, each sensation enhanced by Harry’s immobility.
“Shut up!” The room is too hot, and Harry is panting, trying to keep his hands from shaking. “Shut the fuck up.”
Draco clutches onto the slick material of his top, trying to understand what’s happening. This was just a shag. The best shag of Draco’s life, sure, but he doesn’t get to
. His pale eye nearly glows in the dim light, the other blazing green; the rapt attention of both at once is almost too much to handle. “May I?” he asks, tugging at the hem of my shirt, and I’m nodding before he even finishes asking. “Gonna make you feel so good,” he murmurs, tracing his fingers across the plane of my stomach, and I shiver, because if there’s anything I’ve learned about Harry it’s that he keeps his word.
“Oh, Harry. No. I– I get scared. I get so scared that I won’t be able to do anything. I don’t know what to do with all that fear. And I
“Yeah.” Draco tilts his face back up towards Harry and closes his eyes. In the stark light of the bathroom he looks so pale, the bruise purple-blue against his eye and cheek, but in the suspended moment Harry realizes how
“Darling.” Draco brushes a curl away from Harry’s eye and Harry turns, keeping his eyes closed as he nuzzles into Draco’s fingers. “Yes, I know you’re very sweet when you’re sleepy. But I want to hold you, preferably in our very large and very comfortable bed.”
“You’re gorgeous,” Harry murmurs as he climbs onto the bed, holding himself on all fours above Draco. He traces a lazy finger up Draco’s cock, smirking as Draco bites back a gasp. “Look at you. You want me so bad.”
"The difference is,” He said, “Stalagmite's got an 'm' in it," said Hagrid. "An' don' ask me questions just now, I think I'm gonna be sick."
"But—seeker!?" he cried. Persephone threw her hands up, gesturing for him to keep his voice down. “But—but first years never—you must be the youngest house player—”
They were then interrupted by someone toppling into the common rom. It was Neville, and his legs were stuck together, as if banded together by invisible rope if Persephone didn’t know better—she knew a Leg-Locker Curse when she saw one. And from the look on his face, it seemed he had to hop all the way up the tower.
“Well, actually, I’m a knight, but you’ll be the bishop, Lily. Hermione, you’ll be next to her, here, as a castle.”
Ronan pawed the ground nervously. "I'm sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best," he said in a gloomy voice.
“I hope not,” Fred said coming to stand behind Hermione, leaning on her chair, “We’re in dance this year. Mum is forcing us. Said all gentlemen should know how to dance properly.”
His eyes on the fire in her palm, he stared at her then, narrowing his eyes, “Only a foolish girl would believe that the greatest wizards of the time would have not cast fire-resistant spells on their portraits.”
Was this—was this her parents? Was this her mum and dad writing to her, asking her to meet? Her heart banged in her rib cage outside the kitchen door. Who else would know Persephone’s middle name, as it was written on the front of the letter?
He huffed but turned around to start the tryouts. Fred turned back to say something to Hades that she ignored, and George leaned in close to her, “Late night with the Purveyors of Mischief?”
Still, you weren't eleven every day. Maybe she could get claimed by Poseidon—it would be rather symbolic to be claimed right by the sea. Would Percy be her brother? That would suck—she had the
But these reasons were the reasons she was not allowed to stay home alone. "We could phone my sister, Marge," Uncle Vernon suggested.
This game continued until a girl of familiar golden, stringy hair appeared, her name being called as, “Selene Lovegood.”
She had made it halfway to Ron, who was watching with confusion, when Draco called, “He was lurking in the dungeons.”
“I won’t get caught,” She said quickly, touching the sink. Its coolness sent a shiver down her spine.
While she started the second part (adding four horned slugs to her cauldron, taking it off the fire to add two porcupine quills and stirring five times clockwise, which she could tell made a huge difference in how the quill simmered and mixed with her potion) she finished it in no time, waving Neville’s wand for the final time to finish the potion. Again, she was done before everyone else. She made a quick note to herself to do some research into how to grow her stupid wand.
“Looking for someone—oh!” She had spotted Malfoy. The tips of his hair were still red but now he looked like a punk instead of the usual rich white boy, “Wait here.”
Persephone had no objections to being sent to her room at the end of the night after collecting her packages.
She smiled, ducking in and out of the water. Fred saw her mischievous smile and started yelling. As everyone started panicking, she ducked under the water and found she was very quick, moving with the waves created. She pulled Fred down first and he gasped as he came up.
After lunch, while the Persephone, Hermione and Ron were walking out of the Great Hall, they had just entered the corridor when Persephone froze immediately upon seeing who waited for them.
It was in Astronomy where she fully reached her peak. The moon was full and she was supposed to be listing the effects of the full moon when she got a paper cut. Such a small, stupid thing but it was this small and stupid thing that caused her to excuse herself from the class.
Astronomy was ever so interesting—as the night skies were very present in the philosophy that Persephone read of, it was a wild interest of hers to truly see the stars. She was able to draw her map out accordingly to her basic knowledge of the stars from just using what she had read from Giordano Bruno. She earned Gryffindor their first ‘ten points’ for her ‘impressive interpretation of the solar system’, or so Professor Sinistra says.
“First years,” Someone spoke in a polished Scottish accent, gaining their attention immediately. A tall woman with stern facial structure and robes of emerald green was waiting by the staircase. She gave off a very immediate vibe that she should not be trifled with. “If you would follow me, pleae.”
So when she saw Hades that morning, she turned around and pretended she didn’t see him. She crossed her legs the opposite way and focused on Oliver listening when Seekers would be flying out. She’d be last, after Demelza Robbins. Usually a full Quidditch team didn’t need to have any tryouts but Oliver really wanted to be sure he had the best team he could possibly have.
Unable to hold her smile away, she passed the note over to Ron, whose jaw dropped to the floor in amazement, before eyeing the package almost enviously.
She had neglected asking about what differs a magical funeral from a non-magical funeral. She knew the basic dress code for a non-magical community’s funeral—wear modest, all black clothing. She was up on Friday morning very early, having showered and thoroughly brushed through her wet curls. Now she was stood in a bathrobe, staring at three different, all black outfits. The thought of an all-black dress code not being appropriate for a funeral had not come to her until that moment.
It was a quiet afternoon, where they dared each other to eat the dangerous looking beans out of Bertie’s Every Flavor Beans and laughed when the other started gaging in disgust. Persephone was delighted to find she’d come across a strawberry instead of peppermint flavour—she’d only taken the risk on a dare. Peppermints were usually her dinner on days that she refused to do Dudley’s homework—she was not trying to have those memories on the greatest day of her life, or second to, following her birthday.
She rushed back to Potions class, swiftly telling Snape she was wet from sweat from the hot cauldrons, which he replied to, in great disinterest, “At least that means you are doing something correctly,” (As if she hadn’t been doing something correctly this entire time.)
He was clutching what looked like a muggle camera, something that looked like a newer version of Hades’ camera. The boy went bright red and immediately took up the invitation, coming towards them with a star-struck expression.
Now, with both their robes and uniforms on—Ron’s pants and robes just a tad short on him at the heels—a voice echoed through the train:
“Well, I heard Gryffindor is going all out for the party tonight. The twins have been inviting most of our year so…”
“Oh, no, no, no! Don’t chicken out now because you’re the siren!” George called out, wiping hair out of his face.
A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait.  Persephone felt strangely as though she had entered a very strict library; she swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to her and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling.
“She’ll be fine, Molly, don’t fuss,” Mr. Weasley insisted, taking his turn in reaching into the flowerpot.
Diana handed him her phone and he frantically typed something in. Diana and Persephone stared at each other with questioning eyes, before he groaned, “Nooooo!” He looked up and looked at Persephone. “Percy Jackson isn’t playing anymore in London!”
“He may not be a pureblood,” She didn’t mean for her mouth to fall open, it was simply an instinct, “Would that be the family stuff that sent you to America?”
The girls were allowed to break and stretch away from the boys with the option to watch them perform. When finally the five boys were chosen, the girls joined them on stage. It was Draco (ugh), Cedric, Hades (who was confused and dazed), a boy named Richard from Ravenclaw, and Sammy from Gryffindor.
“I’m—I’m sorry you’re here and not there…I know you’d rather be with the, the others girls,” She blubbered, more tears falling from her eyes. “You can…can go,” Her breathing grew unsteady.
Her hairline belonged to her mother, her high cheekbones, and rounded face, her hidden angles—but her eyebrows were longer than her mother’s—she had her father’s long brow while maintaining her mother’s arch, it seemed. And his eyes—and her eyes. Her lips were rounded, round and full, just like her mother’s…the splash of freckles, exactly nine freckles on her nose were from her father…but the slope of a button nose was her mother’s. But when he smiled…her perfectly straight, even teeth came from him…
Hermione buried her face in her arms; Persephone could tell she had just burst into tears. Instead of cheering, Persephone wrapped her arm around her shoulder, shaking her. The entire Gryffindor table was beside themselves in absolute glee. They were a hundred points up—no longer last place but in second! Holy shit!(!!!!!) "Third—to Miss Persephone Potter…" said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet, as everything held their breath, “for pure nerve and outstanding courage, a Gryffindor at heart, I award Gryffindor house sixty points."
Her hands felt sticky and she looked down, distressed to find blood in both of them. George was quick to tell her it was his blood, not hers, but this only made her worse—he had been holding both her hands and she had squeezed them so hard, too hard, that they broke skin and were now bleeding profusely.
Mr. Malfoy’s eyes fell around the flock of redheads and his eyes landed on Persephone. A glint of interest filled his eyes and he took a moment to smile a most pompous smile. “Persephone Potter…Lucius Malfoy.” He offered her his hand and, not wanting to be impolite to even a man like Draco’s father, she offered hers. He shook it once and before she could let go, he pulled her forward, “You must meet my…nephew, Hades Black.”
“Lily I thought we were soulmates!” George cried before turning to his brother. “I can’t believe this!”
“Have you started studying for the exams yet?” Justin asked the group. “I’ve started studying but I cannot seem to figure out what I’m doing wrong with my transfiguration.”
Malfoy smirked, “Unless you can prove you aren’t—tonight, if you want.  Wizard's duel. Wands only—no contact. What's the matter? Never heard of a wizard's duel before, I suppose? I suppose only wizards know of them—and you’re just a little—”
Persephone fell asleep almost immediately, not waking up when Mr. Weasley started up the engine and started driving out of the yard. She didn’t wake when they had to go back so Fred could run in and get his broomstick. Then, they were again stopped five minutes after that when Gary shrieked that he’d forgotten his lucky quill, or when George and Fred teased him about having a lucky quill but, Persephone did not wake. She did wake, however, when they neared the highway and George had them turn around for his box of Filibuster fireworks. He made Fred go and get them, as to not disturb Persephone sleeping on his shoulder but when Fred passed them to him, he had knocked it right into her head, waking her up thoroughly.
Something seemed to be lacking in Persephone chest. It felt like a rather large hole in her chest and the inside was deep and plunging, where something important seemingly should be. It stung at the edges.
Almost at once, thin ink lines began to spread like a spider’s web from where her wand had touched the parchment. They joined each other, they crisscrossed, they fanned into every corner of the parchment; then she could make out a very obvious drawing of the castle bordering letters she couldn’t read yet. And then it all came together, and she read aloud,
Persephone and Ron exchanged a look—oh no—before they followed Snape up the steps into the vast, echoing entrance hall. Currently, she saw many house-elves out and cleaning. Waxing the silver knight armors, polishing picture frames, even mopping with a shiny looking liquid. There was a faint smell of food coming from the kitchen but they did not go to the kitchens—Snape led them away from the preparation commotion, down a narrow stone staircase that led into the dungeons.
She didn’t get a chance to tell Ron but when Potions ended, she dragged him down the corridor, to where the bathroom was. He was embarrassed when she pulled him in, but she promised it would be worth it. She opened the faucet and reached her hand out, waiting. The water did nothing.
"Hold on, I’ll be right back,” Ron said, eager to ditch his post on studying. He strode over to the aisle where Hagrid had emerged from. A minute later, he came back with a pile of books in arms that he slammed down onto the table.
She dragged George to the Gryffindor table before he could march over there, feeling highly distressed. Ron did not ask where she was during their lesson.
Another hit on the car, barely missing Persephone, sent the car off her. The car shot backwards, as if in reverse. The tree was still trying to get another hit in, but the car had sped off away. Ron had grabbed Persephone by the arm and pulled her into the car through the window. She could hear the roots of the tree creaking as it almost ripped itself up, lashing out at them as they sped out of reach.
He suddenly looked up at her and she had no doubt he was seeing, not Persephone, but Lily. He was seeing her mother. And from the looks of it, he was pained by what he saw. She felt herself weaken…did he…
She collapsed on her bed, wondering if she ought to amputate her legs. She could probably send an owl to Ben, to ask him to amputate her legs. She imagined how the conversation would go—he would ask if a mermaid were to cut their legs off, would they still have a tail? She’d assure him they would find out. She was sure she could convince him it would be in the name of science.
“Other than being a school for magicians and weird, roman mythology derived names? Not really,” She crossed her arms, “And I am nothing like my mother.”
There was a chorus of splashes and laughter and Persephone was left behind with the towels and picnic basket with the food.
“Noble men, working tirelessly to help a new generation of lawbreakers," Fred nodded just solemnly. “Don’t forget to wipe it after you’ve used it or anyone can read it.”
Both of them were heterochromia iridis, which meant two colors in one eye, also going by hazel. They each had a little bit of the other in each, so the green had specks of blue, while the blue had specks of green. You’d only see them if you paid close attention, though. She knew the terms only from one of Diana’s textbooks on human biology. She was pretty good at that too.
Professor Sprout’s arms were full of bandages, and with another twinge of guilt, Persephone spotted the Whomping Willow in the distance, several of its branches now in slings.
“My eyes, ‘Mione! I can’t—I can’t control them!” She hissed, glancing up at Hermione, who gasped and pulled her wand out.
She unfolded her legs from under her and, all the while hesitating, she slowly pulled herself towards the verge of the water, as she seemed to want to do so desperately.
An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop. Moving around the counter was a young boy with a thick and wide book in his arms that he set down on the counter. He barely glanced at her, and Persephone noticed how pale the boy was.
She ran down to meet them and Persephone accepted the hug, rocking back from the impact of her run, “Hermione!”
Ron jumped up to his feet while Persephone sighed, “Ron, it’s too early in the morning to waste your time on this.”
When they told him about Charlie's letter, his eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg.
Persephone woke before she could touch her mother and she woke suddenly and regretfully. She felt the bitter disappearance of the feeling in her hands and she swallowed. Hermione had been nudging her. Lockhart was coming around collecting papers. Hers was empty. She didn’t care, for she missed what she had just seen.
“My goals matter a lot to me, thank you very much.” She snapped. “And I don’t see you having any goals. All you do is lurk around and pluck strands of hair off people’s heads.”
,” She said, looking at Lucius pointedly in a mocking tone, “Of being an orphan. So that would make you, Draco, third in class behind two non-magically brought up witches.” She thought for a moment, taking a pause, “Or perhaps, this is just another example of the difference between boys and girls. Girls are taught from very early on about the real world, hm, aren’t we?” She exchanged a look with Hermione, who was looking on with amazement. “Yes, I do believe so. So, you, a boy, a white boy, at that, has had everything handed to you and the second that ‘daddy’ isn’t there, you aren’t able to get your way by simply being white and male and pureblooded.”
There was something moving. Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby. It sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground. The sound faded. “No werewolf could be killing unicorns fast enough,” She muttered to no one but herself.
Persephone spent time in the library with Susan and Daphne, each girl writing out test questions that could be on their exams at the end of the semester. They tested each other and made flash cards that they picked out at random from Persephone’s bag. Persephone had started writing up her review notes. She mostly needed to review for History of Magic and Herbology. She was sure she would do very, very well in her Charms, Transfiguration and Potions but she did more than the bare minimum, ignoring her ego.
Draco didn’t really understand what was coming over him, but it was all too much. He felt as his fingers pressed too hard into Potter’s back, and there was a rumbling against his chest as Potter murmured those same words again and again into his ear. If he could take a step back from everything he might have felt mortified at his reaction to the sex they’d just had, but he couldn’t even sort out that much. It was too much.
He glanced over, his frown not fading as he put on his shirt. “Who or what exactly are you talking about?”
“Disillusionment, then. That shouldn’t be too difficult. I’d likely apply that directly, rather than layering it into the broom’s enchantments.”
“After the classes, and four more years of probation. Though who knows if they’ll actually bother to cancel the Trace at that point.” Then he silently thought to himself that it wouldn’t matter, since he’d hopefully be long gone by then.
He took a breath. “Anyhow, I do need to get going, regretfully. I hadn’t intended on staying over, so. . . .”
He stared at the letter for several minutes, wondering what would happen if he simply sent it back. When he heard a bark from that snooty owl he rolled his eyes and cracked the seal to reveal the flowing script within.
There was a long pause, and he could see that Potter was puzzling something out. “Last week you said that you have a year of classes. And that you didn’t use magic for ten and a half years. But wasn’t your sentencing in June?”
He heard Potter set his glass down on the table, then the front door opening. “Happy Christmas, Malfoy.”
And his eyes were fierce, in that moment. They were full of that burning conviction, just like that day in December when he’d declared that he saw beyond Draco’s past. He felt as the air in his lungs vanished and the sound of the fire faded, and it was just the two of them, mere inches apart. There was the faint smell of citrus on Potter’s breath, and Draco couldn’t help but flick his eyes down to his mouth, watching as his lips just parted, and they were so close now—
Potter finally entered and shut the door behind him, then stared at him a bit while he replied, “Molly always sends me home with too many leftovers. And we had Christmas dinner yesterday, and she sent me off with far too much, especially since I’m going to be there tomorrow as well. You mentioned you weren’t doing anything for Christmas, so. . . .” He trailed off, still somewhat staring, and there was a dull flush rising up his neck.
Then, feeling productive, he embarked on a thorough cleaning of his cabin, using the remaining daylight hours to scoop away the snow that had collected against the front of the structure, organise the collection of trunks and tents, wash the dishes that had started to gather dust from a month of disuse, and air out his towels and quilt.
Then he was introduced to Eddie, a tiny thing with a mop of strawberry blond curls, a round face, and dimples, who immediately held up a stuffed dragon and shrieked, “No-but!”
Draco was just opening his mouth to say something—he didn’t know what, only that it would definitely be rude and he wouldn’t feel the least bit guilty about it—but Potter continued even louder. “But, I’ll explain the situation to them and see what information they can give me.”
Spanning most of his torso, from his shoulders down to the base of his ribcage, his skin was covered in a mottled rash, with patches of angry pink interspersed with sections that were so pale they were almost white. Swallowing hard he finished dressing and carefully rose to his feet.
He nodded, then asked, “Kreacher, are there spare tables in any of the rooms that aren’t being used?”
He liked to think that what he was feeling was merely irritation. Irritation was simple. He could live with irritation.
Hermione let out a puff of air, her jaw stiff. “No testing anything for the next month to make sure that you don’t upset your recovery. We’ll resume the project at the end of February.” After a glare for good measure she spun on her heel and Disapparated.
Draco explained, and soon they were embroiled in a lively discussion about the possible ways to circumvent the issues they kept experiencing with Extension Charms. Before he knew it there was a brief knock on the door and the sun had dipped quite a bit lower in the sky.
“Excellent. Well then I think that’s the next step, as I don’t see the point in testing the shielding in conjunction with your other custom spellwork if we haven’t reached the needed temperature thresholds yet.”
Draco shut his eyes, focusing on the tremors that were still running through his body, not letting himself think about anything else. A few minutes later he could sense a shifting on the bed next to him, then a hot arm was draped across his chest while the hard edge of a jaw pressed against his shoulder.
Suddenly there was a large rock sitting heavy in the pit of Draco’s stomach. “I—sort of. I was . . . aware of that being a thing that could happen, in an academic sense, but it didn’t exactly register that I was in a situation where it would apply.”
Potter left the room at that point and Draco continued to sit quietly, until Hermione dragged him into a conversation about the drink that he’d brought which prompted many sounds of surprise as he explained the process of tapping the birch trees in his forest, and the various uses of the sap that he collected.
Then he waited, continuing his simple routine of attending the horrid Ministry-mandated classes, and otherwise remaining his small section of woods.
She took a long sip and sighed, her eyes drifting closed for a few seconds before they snapped open again. “I hope Harry wasn’t too much of a bear when you two spoke?”
The man smiled and ducked his head slightly. “Hey, Malfoy. I thought I might come by a bit early and bring breakfast before Hermione gets here?”
“I see you,” Potter said, the quiet words ringing in Draco’s ears. “I see how much the thought of people upsets you. And I know that your whole thing with spaceflight is just a way for you to run away from everything. But while you’re
“I’ll wait here for you, Mother,” he said quietly, bracing himself for some argument, a cutting remark, a passive aggressive comment, but she simply nodded and strode forward regally, her head held high.
“It’s rather late,” he said instead, handing the bottle over to Potter who accepted it with a bemused expression. “I should get home and have some dinner.”
Draco frowned, then looked at him closely. “Potter. You always wanted to be an Auror. Everyone in school knew it, the amount you went on and on about it. What’s the problem?”
“Not anymore, no. At first he seemed quite frustrated, but after he asked what I thought you might be working on he’s calmed down. I think the visits have been good for him,” she said.
Potter had immediately crouched to collect the mugs, one of which had cracked in two, and Draco could only stand there staring at the man who was kneeling in front of him with his head right in line with his cock. He could feel blood rushing southward, and when Potter glanced up from his position on his knees, eyes bright, cheeks flushed, he considered that part of him that was no longer buried, the part of him that was actively urging him onward, and thought,
He nodded, kicking up clumps of snow as he walked. “Today, I think. Might as well while I’ve my mind on the project.”
Draco was feeling fortunate that he wasn’t the one gripping Potter’s arm, otherwise he was certain he’d have cut off the man’s circulation at the brazen act. “We’re supposed to cross at the lights! Or—or at least a zebra crossing!” he hissed, gesturing with his free arm.
Things even went well while he applied the initial Atmospheric Charms, though when he went to extend them into the vast space of the trunk’s interior things fell apart.
And he was thinking of her as Hermione now, because the look in her eyes when he’d called her by her surname was something else.
Draco flapped a hand lazily in response while he started applying the same charms to the large stone. Once he’d finished, he looked up to find Potter looking quite tense and flustered. A part of him enjoyed the sight.
He could see fingers twisting in the sheets and slowly made his way back up toward the heavy cock, giving it a long swipe with his tongue before slowly taking it into his mouth, inch by inch, allowing it to slide into his throat, swallowing the hot flesh and his own moans. He took his time, savouring the man and the delicious noises he was making. As the fingers moved to his hair and pulled, and twisted, and grew frantic he slowed further, making sure to taste every part of the offered member, not wanting to miss a thing.
“You really should have,” Potter replied with humour present in his tone, “considering we’ve cuddled plenty of times before.”
That weekend another heavy storm rolled in, the relentless whistling of the wind and groaning of branches causing Vince to tremble on his perch, and it didn’t let up until the early hours on Monday morning. Draco finished all of his outstanding reading during that time and sketched out a few ideas on shielding, but it wasn’t until he returned from class on Monday that he saw just how strong the winds had been. Within a hundred yards of his cabin two oaks and a hornbeam had been uprooted, and there were surely more farther out in the woods.
he had heard before. When he returned home a storm was just rolling in so he took out his frustration about the classes and his confusion about Potter on the poor, defenseless wall, hacking at the section that would become the doorway with his axe.
“Thank you, Kreacher,” Potter said in a low voice, and after a quiet pop he stepped up to wrap his arms around Draco’s chest, resting his jaw on his shoulder and joining him in facing the open window.
“Lunch,” Potter said patiently, though there was a nervous sort of energy around him. “I usually have a few friends around on Saturdays for lunch, and I obviously haven’t done that in several weeks. They’re starting to worry about me so I might head out? If you don’t mind?”
He released Potter’s hands and, hips still jerking erratically, reached around him to finish him off, only noticing as his hand encountered a very wet door that the man had already climaxed.
Draco felt something constricting in his chest as he listened quietly, feeling like something incredibly private was being shared with him. He wasn’t aware of how much time they spent with the decorations until Potter reached up for the next one and found all of the branches bare.
He was surprised by the apology, but rather than show it he simply tilted his head and asked, “Are you actually sorry?”
There was some more silence, during which he finished his soup and turned to wash his dishes. When he finished rinsing them he turned to see Potter still standing in the doorway, his eyes roaming the interior of the cabin.
When it was hours past dusk and Draco couldn’t bear to suffer another gulp of the swill he set his glass down and rose to his feet.
Slowly, in incredulous disbelief, he reached down with his hand and grasped at his half-hard cock, gasping slightly at the contact. He flipped off the quilt, still staring.
Potter flinched, then said, “I’m not stealing your post. This came across my desk, so it’s my problem. What are you up to?” he demanded.
The heat was so intense that he couldn’t think, and it was gloriously wet, and he could feel each of Potter’s moans so acutely they felt like they were penetrating him. And then the man looked up at him, his mouth still stretched around his cock while his eyes blazed in challenge, and Draco felt that hidden part of him yell in victory as he held onto that gaze, his climax hitting him hard an instant later.
Vince had had enough of the loud noises at that point and let out a piercing shriek, taking off and cuffing Potter over the head with a wing as he flapped out of the cabin.
Draco shook his head. “No. I can’t seem to sleep in this chair anymore because of my shoulders. I’ve been spending the nights out in the clearing.”
Draco nodded again. “The bath arrived on Christmas Eve, so I was able to finish everything off then.”
There was the sound of a snort, then Potter finally turned to face him, his expression one of amusement. “Yeah, yeah. I should have seen this, the two of you teaming up against me.”
He was just beginning to tackle the flies on the man’s denims when he felt the knot in his hair come undone, then his head was yanked back as Potter delivered a stinging bite to his bottom lip, then dropped his mouth to kiss, bite, and suck at every sensitive part of his neck.
“We really do,” Draco replied, his lips twisting into an expression of bemusement. “It makes me wonder about her job if this is the sort of project that entertains her in her spare time.”
“Can you tell me what house this is?” Draco asked, realising that the elf was also somehow familiar, reminding him of a childhood visit that he couldn’t quite place.
“Yeah, I don’t think she’ll make it a week either. Maybe she’ll go for guilt this time. Haven’t had one of those in a while.”
“Of course I see that!” Potter exclaimed, finally facing him, his eyes burning. “I know exactly what she’s trying to do, because she obviously thinks that the act will disgust me so much that I’ll refuse to do it, and guilt you into going. Because she’s your family, and she and the whole fucking world knows how important family is to me. Anyway, I don’t see why you care.”
That thought carried him through the next hour of torment as Potter worshipped his cock, bringing him right to the edge without letting him finish countless times until his mind was filled with senseless need and the pounding of his heart filled his entire body.
They listened to Hermione’s receding footsteps, Potter’s gaze roaming Draco’s face all the while, likely looking for lingering traces of the earlier incident.
He couldn’t help the way he inhaled sharply at the name, and he hated the fact that Potter definitely noticed. His hands found the edge of the counter behind him and tightened as he summoned a sneer and said, “I’m not your
“Hermione swooped in and saved the day, thank god. It still took her a long time, though. And once she confirmed that you were under stasis and wouldn’t be going anywhere, she tore me a new one. I still don’t really understand why, to be honest, but once she heard what had happened she said that if you ever woke up you’d better be prepared for her wrath. Because apparently you should have known better.”
“We were out there in the water for almost four hours, all told. Things seemed fine, completely fine. Then when you started to climb I figured you were done, and started to make my way to the surface as well. Then you veered hard to the left, spun upside down, and you must have fallen unconscious because you let go of the broom and were just hanging there limp.”
That question had clearly thrown him, since the man’s eyebrows contorted and he choked on his drink. Well, that hadn’t been intentional but Draco certainly enjoyed it, though he didn’t show it.
He watched as Potter seemed to redden even further, then suddenly it was as though all of the fight left the man, and he slumped forward, resting his elbows on his knees, hanging his head.
Once they arrived he sat down at one of the rickety tables while Potter fumbled through some horrendous Greek, even though the staff clearly spoke English. But he plodded along anyway and Draco shook his head more amused than exasperated at his partner’s need to be ridiculous, even while he rubbed his hand, feeling the way that its nerve endings were still humming from that earlier touch.
“Now for shielding.” She pulled what looked like a plain tree branch out of her bag. “I thought we might test on this, to make sure that the results aren’t being negatively impacted by the broom enchantments.”
His chest was tight, and he felt a prickling sort of heat behind his eyes, overwhelmed by everything that he could hear in the man’s tone, and everything that he himself felt. He wished that he could return to wallowing in the bath.
he fucking cared and just managed to snap his mouth shut again before the words came spilling out. After taking a breath to find another, less troublesome response, he instead said, “She’s my mother, and she’s trying to manipulate you in order to get to us
“Hmm.” There was quiet as the boat gently rocked beneath them, occasionally bumping up against the dock with a dull thud. “Is it what you thought it’d be?”
“Harry!” Hermione exclaimed, and Draco watched as the smile turned to a look of shock before Potter spun around toward his friend. She had leapt to her feet and was swiftly scooped up into a hug.
He made a strangled sound in his throat and withdrew the sad-looking broom that was missing most of its bristles. He handed it over to Hermione, almost reverently, frowning when she let out the tiniest titter of laughter.
Then he continued lower, hands firm against Potter’s sides, then his thighs, sweeping along the damp skin while his tongue followed, the salty taste of sweat filling his mouth while the scent of the man surrounded him.
Draco knew that he wanted to, but he also felt like the more steps he took toward him, the harder it would be to extricate himself once he inevitably needed to.
