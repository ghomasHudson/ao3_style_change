“Amanda, that’s quite enough. He is a medical staff, let him through,” Robards exhaled warily, giving Kevin a room to pass through.
“There’s no need to worry, Potter, you weren’t poisoned,” the woman replied. “This is a rather curious concoction that might help reveal your… true nature”.
Slowly they found their rhythm and the previous pleasant sensation was returning back with so much intensity that it was almost unbearable to move. It was amazingly bizarre, it was overwhelming, it was so deliciously wrong and such a perfect screw you to all their preconceived beliefs and inhibitions, that Harry would have liked to relive that moment more and more. He wasn’t losing anything, despite whatever nonsense the pure-blood customs were dictating, he was gaining a new experience, a new sense of closeness to the person in front of him.
“We excuse the disturbance, our people will search the building. In the meantime, everyone should remain where they are,” the Auror demanded.
В осень глухую порою ночной.”
Narcissa sternly reminded him that he was not permitted to be around her son as per his house arrest conditions. And their tea was short and awkward and the tension in the room made Andromeda usher Harry away too early. He didn’t even have a chance to talk to Draco properly, that’s why he spent his evening plotting a way to meet again without any interruptions.
“It’s fine, I guess. I learned how to stand menacingly,” Harry joked. It wasn’t too far from the truth, though. The trainees were seldom given any meaningful assignments.
“Hang on… You don't want us to do it the muggle way, do you?” the blonde smirked as he rummaged for his wand.
Draco cursed loudly and kicked the tire of his car angrily.
At the end of their class they all received Pamphlet about Special Auror Training Courses and what knowledge was required for them to be eligible to enter. The Gryffindor was happy to note that most spells were already familiar to him because of the D.A.
“What did you… Did you look at… it? Why didn’t you tell me…” he was babbling and it was a bit amusing if not for the fact that the sod might try to strangle him after that.
“Have you been here before?” Harry wondered. It was all a bit too much for him, the lights, the music, the scents of so many sweaty bodies.
* * *
“And you stopped being my father the moment you killed Amanda at the Department of Mysteries,” her blue eyes turned black the very moment she said that. “You used Ollie. You knew he had schizophrenia, and you used him to do your dirty job! You destroyed everything I loved! My mother, Amanda, Oliver, Auntie! And now you are destroying yourself! Stop it already! The Dark Lord is gone! And you have nothing left, but me!”
“Nan da? Kuso-mahoutsukai*!” she cursed at him, plucking a few strings without interest.
His friend was not moving, he continued sleeping like nothing happened.
“Want some, don’t you?” he waved it in front of Draco like bait on the hook for a hungry fish.
“He is not allowed to be in Three Broomsticks anymore, Ronald!” Hermione explained.
Cannenta was heading to the muggle car park, feeling too exhausted to apparate. She had to pick up her daughter from her muggle grandparents and swing by the grocer’s shop on her way home.
“Stay beside me! We need to find the child,” he murmured to the Patronus, gently petting its silvery fur.
Why was Potter always getting in his way? The git was relentless, not only he did not let him forget that his arse was handed to him by the Wizengamot this summer, but he also was creeping everywhere Draco went. The Gryffindor probably thought that Draco hadn’t noticed him stalking in corridors, staring during the meals. Potter’s new habit had helped the Slytherin determine where he was even when he was using some sort of disillusionment charm - a faint smell of firewhiskey was following him everywhere.
House-elves had incredible insights on the ins and outs of wizarding households. Draco gave the boy a satisfied smile and spoke to Auntie.
“Me too,” Harry smiled, hugging him tightly with his healthy hand and feeling the strong steady rhythm of his heart under the fingertips. He was there, it wasn’t his imagination playing tricks on him.
, he thought darkly.
“Neville here has been making a move at Miss Lovegood if I am not mistaken?” Seamus teased.
Draco smiled, maybe he would get his answer after all.
At that moment they heard somebody’s steps aproaching them in the dungeon corridor. Hermione quickly dragged the Invisibility Cloak over Malfoy and shoved him towards the alcove.
“Cut it out, Malfoy, do you have one more or not?” Potter was getting irritated.
Harry made his way to the Atrium, hastily altering the color of his crimson robes to something less eye-catching. He really wasn’t in the mood for unnecessary attention from half of the Ministry. Someone still managed to stop him, and he mentally prepared himself for an awkward hand-shake and a small talk with some big fan.
“Why wasn’t he affected?” he asked, gesturing towards the impostor disguised as a priest. “You said the spell was only tuned to our magical signatures.”
He walked next to her obediently, observing her curiously. She was probably as young as Elise was when she entered the Training Programme from those photos on Potter’s desk. Her uniform looked brand-new and her hair was neatly gathered in a work-appropriate ponytail. It seemed that she wanted to make a nice impression on her colleagues. Draco wondered whether he had any chance whatsoever to work for DMLE after everything that had transpired.
“Can I see him?” Draco asked immediately.
“Well, Mr. There-is-a-spell-for-everything, my father doesn’t even let me have a wand,” the girl retorted, “And somehow we need to make my hair as light as yours, so your bloody cover doesn’t get blown.”
“They’re tracking him down. Williamson is gone too, and the lady from the Orphanage denies any allegations against her.” Granger continued, “Your mother provided her memories for your defense but she hasn’t seen the altercation between Greyback and you two. So far your alibi is flimsy at best. The problem with the magical law is that there is no presumption of innocence...”
“Cause I felt like it” the Slytherin let out a short laugh.
“We had a strict no legilimency policy,” Amanda laughed, pointing at a well-read paperback of “Living With Legilimens” on top of the pile, “But she tried boy, did she try. Legilimens just can’t stop snooping around, can they?”
“Brilliant,” Harry breathed and the insecure expression on Draco’s face changed into a hesitant smile.
* * *
“Why are you doing this?” Harry demanded, “Who’s making you?... If it is Yaxley… You need to realize that he is going to kill you too afterward…”
“Have you heard of Saint Barbara’s Orphanage scandal?” Healer Cameron asked and noticed a dark shadow pass on Malfoy’s face.
Harry bit back an insult. It would be so much easier to explode and give the twats like McLaggen something to speculate about. But he genuinely wanted to be an Auror and so he would rather stay silent than soil his reputation. He wasn’t involved with anyone at the moment. Instead, he buried himself in work as much as possible to forget about the hollow place the relationship with Draco left in his heart.
“Don’t tell me you’ve never tried cola before,” Harry elbowed him playfully.
He found Potter’s warm fingers, stroking them gently and intertwining them with his. It reminded him of their evening in the courtyard back at Hogwarts and he wanted to just be like that, not caring about the world outside of their little universe that consisted of one bedroom in the refurbished Victorian house.
“My father can mail it to you tomorrow,” Luna replied.
He was supposed to stop whatever nonsense they were planning to do, but he felt too limp to do anything at the moment, the bint was going to wait.
A heavy-set bodyguard came in with the tea service. It was English, so the smell of high-quality earl grey and fresh scones made Draco’s mouth water. He didn't have a bite of anything since that botched job in the morning.
“He is… Do you know about section 28 of the muggle law, Mister Potter?”
Hopefully, Harry will be fine, we'll see in the next chapter :)
“You forgot that I am a Death Eater too, Potter!” he left the room and ran down the stairs quickly dismantling the protective wards that would keep him inside.
The vampire nodded and came over to transfigure dead Yaxley into the box, which he took and hid in his jacket.
“I know already,” the girl answered nonchalantly.
Льётесь, как льются струи дождевые
The blonde was staring at his palms smeared with crimson, slightly confused. A trickle of blood was running down his cheek from a shallow cut on his forehead.
Gryffindor’s mind was racing. How come the Auror that was proclaimed missing by his family was calmly working for the Ministry and getting involved with Malfoy and Auror Baelish’s case? Was there someone Pollyjuiced as him, was he under the Imperius charm? And now he knew that secret message Elise had left him in the confidential letter.
“But Ron, she was helping me with the Malfoys all this time... and Kingsley had vouched for her as valuable Order informant inside the Ministry. He said we could trust her,” he said.
The Gryffindor flicked his wand and a little paper envelope fluttered towards them. He took out a black and white reel of photographs, there was someone that looked like his father surrounded by his friends all still motionless smiles and silly faces and then the last picture made Draco do a double-take. He had never seen this man look so young and so nonthreatening, the only image he remembered was from the wanted posters: a hideous mugshot with a wild mop of dirty hair and mad eyes. Sirius Black was there, enjoying his youth and kissing another lad.
“A search? That’s preposterous!” Hermione exclaimed.
“And don’t they already know about… this?” the blonde asked gesturing between them.
It was a great chance for Draco to do his part. He took out his wand and cast a legillimency spell on her.
“Are you out of your mind?!... That idiot?! He is Robard’s dog through and through!” he exclaimed.
“I am sorry… I didn’t mean to… Was that the night… when…”
The room unraveled back into the reality, it was so hot around, the flame was slowly getting closer and the veela was still standing over them like some sort of avenging angel of death. Amanda stopped struggling and was desperately gulping smoke-filled air, she wasn’t staring at the creature anymore. The spell was broken.
That expression was so familiar to Harry, that if he didn’t know better he would assume that Draco sodding Malfoy had possessed his Auror partner.
“Harvey, are you okay?” Becky butted in, looking from him to Zabini. “What do you want from him? Malfoy’s dead, everyone knows that.”
* * *
“Mister Malfoy?! What in Merlin’s name is happening here? Why are you bothering my elf?!” the matron came into the lounge, Oliver Williamson standing behind her in his crimson uniform looking menacing.
“How do you know about her?... Wait are you somehow involved in all this?” Slytherin’s fingers dug painfully into his injured shoulder, and he shook him a couple of times, demanding the answer.
He remembered the first time he was able to do it, hiding in the Hogwarts alcove from Carrows, trying his best to find some cheerful thoughts in his depressed brain. His Dark Mark started to hurt when he finally managed to produce a Patronus, it felt like his skin was being peeled off his left forearm, but Draco for the first time in a while felt happiness and hope that those dark times would pass.
And my favorite character from the previous work is returning here.
And then Harry wasn’t thinking anymore, he was just stepping over the threshold and into the bedroom and kissing the boy before him with everything he had. He never knew he would find himself wanting another man so much. There was some inexplicable agreement between them, their movements fluid, their mouths fitting perfectly together, hands searching and touching, and bringing out pleasure.
“Ooh, a mediwitch? Anyone I know?” the nurse winked knowingly, and examined his injury, “Looks fine to me, just a couple of weeks and you will be able to return to your studies.”
“What I want is simple: you have something that my uncle would like to have. Vials with memories… does that ring any bells?”
“We might have a problem, Miss,” the vampire mouthed quickly before Harry came closer to them.
There is a little piece from Tchaikovsky's 6 duets for piano and voice, called Tears. It is always performed in Russian in a classical setting so I will provide a translation in the notes at the end.
“Granger, I need you to do me a favor!” Draco said quietly, “Before you refuse, I want you to know that it is related to Potter and his safety.”
* * *
He felt like his life had been completely tainted by the likes of Fenrir Greyback. The werewolf had savaged his poor beautiful cousin Jaques in front of him and then attacked Harry. Now he had another person with lycanthropy to look after, and he wondered whether the bastard had anything to do with that as well. Draco had tried reading on the subject over the years when he still had a smidge of hope that he could reconcile with Harry. But most of the literature was written from a prejudiced and dehumanizing point of view and Draco refused to see any merit in it.
“Why is he lurking about there?” Ron interrupted his thoughts pointing at the fogged-up window. Outside the pub a tall shape of Draco Malfoy wrapped in his expensive fur-lined cloak was standing apprehensively.
He thanked all his Black ancestors for having similar signatures.
One of them lit up in the corridor that led to the kitchen. It was probably the house-elf but it was better than nothing, so they went along to check. The place was deserted and looked like it hadn’t been used in months.  Dust thickly covered most surfaces and the remains of grease stuck to the cooking utensils suggested that no elf had even touched the kitchen.  Flint had probably had to free the help since the new laws demanded that masters paid their elves a living wage in galleons if they wished them to continue serving in their households.
“Very well! I can take care of that myself!” the veela cackled and then the Auror lifter her hands towards her own neck and started strangling herself.
“Nothing a memory charm can’t fix,” TJ gave him a sympathetic grin and helped his confused roommate to stand up.
“You do realize, where you are, peach?” the muggle grinned dangerously.
The feeling of uselessness was suffocating for him, he hated that everything was out of his control yet again and the more he thought about it the less it seemed like there was a chance to make it right. All he wanted was to have a normal year after the war, but his inability to make it work with Ginny and his constant meddling in Draco’s business made it impossible. He couldn’t just quit him, it looked like Malfoy didn’t have anyone who would have his back, and Harry wanted to be that person.
Malfoy huffed and offered a fag. The man refused, looking a bit taken aback.
“That is my exact question, er, sir,” Kevin gave him an incredulous look and then glanced at Harry worryingly. “Why is my patient that is in dire need of medical attention apprehended by Aurors?”
“He’s fine,” the girl concluded and chuckled softly.
“How dare you speak his name!” Draco yelled, “You bitch! You have no right…”
“LA?” The bartender asked again, his smile less seductive now. “Out at the back. Look for the purple door that says ‘staff only.’”
“She is brilliant… Granger. You’re lucky to have such a friend” Draco exhaled a puff of smoke and at that moment Harry realized how lonely the Slytherin had been.
“Erm, pardon, Kawahara who?” Cho looked utterly confused.
The girl with uneven pigtails and stains of paint all over her school uniform nodded seriously and showed them the way to a small lounge that had a couple of bookcases and cushions thrown around the place. The Gryffindor grabbed the struggling house-elf and carried her there while Draco was casting a barrage of privacy spells in the room.
“Only if you let me do it too,” Draco teased and was relieved when the other boy nodded.
The beetle-green Ministry Ford Model B was waiting for him outside, a couple of grim-looking Aurors were standing next to it radiating authority. Draco took the box of personal things and sat in the back seat not meeting the eyes of his convoy men. The young witch sat next to him smiling apologetically, her wand never leaving her tight grip and pointing at his heart. For her, he probably looked like a dangerous criminal, an offspring of a Death Eater, a venomous animal ready to attack at any moment.
The Slytherin let out a sigh of relief, at least St. Mungo’s Healers made sure that the Savior of the Wizarding World did not contract any muggle deceases from the scum that was Greyback. And there was something else that he heard that made him hope that Harry wasn’t infected with lycanthropy. The drugs. Muggles thought it was some kind of overdose, which meant that whatever happened to that hapless Healer wasn’t because of the full moon but rather because Potter was fed some kind of potion and then attacked him under the influence.
“Not so fast, Harry… Your wound has reopened again, I really need to take a look at it before you go anywhere,” the nurse was adamant and Harry had no choice but to endure yet another painful re-wrapping.
“I am afraid, you have no say in the matter.” Baelish replied shortly.
“As eloquent as ever, Potter” Draco smirked, “Want one?”
“I knew my daughter was an Auror and I knew that she wasn’t loyal to my cause! But why was she killed, it couldn’t have been anyone of my people! They don’t spill pure blood!” Yaxley shouted.
"But boss…" one of the henchmen protested.
The blonde sat on one of the dusty velvet chairs in the audience and patted another for Harry to join him.
“Language, Kawahara!” Savage warned her with a hint of a smile. He was also not afraid to swear here and there. “I see, so it is all a big coincidence. Weasley claims to have seen you when the incident happened.”
“Of course…” Harry sighed, “Do you mind helping me a little, I must have dislocated my shoulder a bit.”
“What?. What happened?” Harry croaked hoarsely wishing somebody would cast Aguamenti straight into his mouth.
“You!” Draco exclaimed. “Don’t you dare hurt her or I will kill you!”
It was the second day after Harry came to the Burrow after waking up to an empty bed and no sign of Malfoy anywhere. He suspected something like that might happen but he spent a couple of days fooling himself that whatever madness they’d engaged in would last a bit longer.
“Draco? Darling, is that you?” Narcissa called from another room and then she came into the hall, dropping everything she had in her hards and embracing her son tightly.
The reaction was about as bad as he’d expected: Ron was gaping at him like a Grindylow out of water. But Harry couldn’t bear seeing how hurt Hermione looked, even if it was about their school nemesis.
A little update in this chapter from Harry's POV
He was alert and tried to sit up but a hand with well-manicured dark-green nail polish stopped him, pressing on his chest painfully.
Like you never knew it
Malfoy doesn’t remember anything, concluded Harry. Somehow he felt sad about it. He thought maybe he should have put a tracking spell on the car, in case the blonde was planning something more notorious. But the vehicle was nowhere to be seen.
He woke up late. Harry managed to get onto the Knight Bus after a quick drunken groping rendezvous with the blonde muggle. He was too hung over to feel ashamed about what had happened, the only thing he wanted right now is to find another precious vial of hangover potion and not to vomit on the new rug he had purchased for the living room. It was a mystery how he always ended up sleeping on the sofa instead of his bed.
Kawahara levitated a clean mug with a golden M embossed on the surface and a small teapot towards Harry’s desk. The tea smelled of camomile and cinnamon and Harry felt the tension leaving his shoulders when he made a few sips.
“And how many times have the Ministry and your Precious Order failed?” Draco accused, “They couldn’t even keep my father out of harm's way when he was in their custody… They all have turncoats and Death Eaters in their midst! Are you seriously that naive to believe that anyone would help me… even if you ask!”
“Remind me again, why did we switch them?” he asked breathlessly, trying to figure out if Williamson was still behind them.
“What about Elise Baelish? Who is responsible for her murder?” he continued his impromptu interrogation.
“Yaxley made contact! He has my mother! He gave me 24 hours!” Draco exclaimed, anxiously looking around the room for something decent to wear.
Harry noticed how he couldn’t look at his injury, how the sight of his bandaged shoulder made him shiver and shut his eyes tightly like he was afraid that that wound would harm him.
“It says side effects... what sort of side effects might there be? Does it make you... do things?” Harry shamefully remembered what happened last night, how he’d gotten off with Malfoy out of all people, how he bloody enjoyed it. He felt so liberated from responsibility, from caring about what others might think. It was a dangerous feeling because he wanted to experience it once more.
“Did you and Ginny… er, did you shag?”
“Gimme your wand!” the Slytherin demanded.
It was too long for a license plate number and too short for a phone number, it had letters too. How was Harry supposed to decipher this mess? He could try to ask Hermione for help. And why was it written in muggle ink?
"What do you propose I do?! I can't let him go back to that place!"
“It is fine… I just need to take some potions,” Harry said sharply walking out of the bathroom.
He found her at the library, sitting in the Arithmancy section, surrounded by uneven piles of books that were about to tumble down at any moment, her hair a wild mess.
Draco had heard about muggle cinemas from Pansy, but he had never been to one. And although he enjoyed a record or two of muggle jazz or swing. The pure-blood wizards preferred watching the plays and listening to the classical music to such plebeian entertainment as films.
He looked seven, maybe eight, his hair was covered in dust from the larder, and big dark eyes were filled with dread. He was wearing wizarding clothes, something that Draco himself might have worn in childhood.
“Is it really okay to have a student here with us… she’s like five!” Harry objected, giving the stubborn girl an apprehensive glance.
“I know what it means. The next full moon is a couple of weeks away and when you transf…”
The Prophet and all the magical rags in the world would trip over each other just to get the image of the Savior of the Wizarding World writhing in the ex-Death Eater’s lap, but it was the sight only Draco got to experience. He felt Harry’s fingers digging into his shoulders as he grasped for leverage and started to move, his head falling backward and exposing the delectable skin of his throat. He could hear his hopeless pants as they picked up the pace. His hands were holding the brunette's hips in a deadly grip, urging him to keep going. The ungodly rhythm of their bodies was trapping and completely entrancing Draco as the rush of endorphins was pleasantly overwhelming his brain.
“How do you know my whereabouts? And how do I know it is not some sort of set up?!” he demanded, now willing to believe that somehow his hideaway was common knowledge and that Harry was in danger.
Aunt Bella had inadvertently taught him how to dissociate, when she Crucioed him until he couldn’t remember where he was and why he needed to continue living. She thought it would make him tough, build resistance, but it made him forget, made his mind get stuck on one point, and stop paying attention to anything else.
“Yeah… but why does she keeps complaining to me that when you two are together your thoughts are elsewhere?” his friend was looking at him worryingly and it made Harry feel really guilty.
Draco gave her a lopsided grin. Having to exist in her body for a long time made him reevaluate how he thought about Megumi. He somewhat understood how vulnerable she felt some times. At least Draco had the advantage of knowing a few dozen dark spells and curses. She, on the other hand, was raised in the muggle family and was actively discouraged from using magic. Naturally, she would feel inadequate in the world, where her father's shady business had an influence on every single aspect of her life.
, he thought, twirling a bright yellow label from a muggle teabag in his fingers. The Auror that was sitting across from him smirked understandingly but continued to drink her tea from a crimson mug with a golden letter M on it.
“Your student wasn’t on the train!” Robards exclaimed, giving Draco a dirty look.
****ahou - idiot
“There is a spell for that, you know. And does that thing have mercury in it?! You know you can get mercury poisoning… those muggles are completely loony!” Draco said eyeing the object suspiciously.
“All… er, all of them?” he asked nervously, watching the blonde intently.
“I shall be announcing my son’s eulogy...” Mrs. Malfoy spoke to him quietly, “If you have anything to add, Mr. Potter, you are more than welcome.”
The blonde cast a quick unlocking spell and half-dragged the ridiculous lad onto the passenger side. It was quite a task since the seats were higher than in a normal sedan. Once Potter was successfully inside, Draco hopped behind the steering wheel. Another spell and the muggle engine came to life, the blinkers and the ambulance siren turned on as well. The blonde pulled out of the parking space grazing the neighboring cars in the process. He had never driven the vehicle that was that big and bulky.
Finally, he saw the small shape of a wolf cub, splayed under one of the trees. At first Draco thought that something must have harmed it. But it was just lying there, its big yellow eyes frightened and its body rolled into a tight protective ball. Draco shook his head. He was an idiot. How could he let a child run into a dark forest alone and be okay with it.
“But we’ve been working so hard on it…” she bit her lip, “Keep it anyway, maybe one day it will be handy!”
There was a notice on the door written in all caps on the orange paper declaring one should not have sexual intercourse inside the training facilities. And Harry wondered who was that weird person that would do such a thing.
* You kinda stink like a dog.
“Quick! Push it out of the car!” Elise instructed from the back seat…
It is done, a work of almost a year is finished. I am excited about the sequel and hopefully start publishing it soon. I am very grateful for all the attention this fanfic received and that so many of you have read it. Thank you all for making it until the end!
“The Youngest Hollyhead Harpie in the century, blah blah blah,” she rolled her eyes at him. “You sound like my dad. I swear he will start making T-shirts with it soon.”
“Who are you?! What do you want?” he demanded squinting at the figure.
“Just give me your bloody wand, Potter! I’ve got an idea!” he grabbed the wand of holly and gave him his hawthorn one like it was every day that they exchanged them.
“What? Why? But we were… It was going fine,” the girl denied, tears glistening in her eyes.
“Are you going to be okay?” Draco whispered and heard no response, only slow and rhythmical breathing: inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale.
His eagle owl returned with no reply from Blaize later that evening. Perhaps,  he was in hiding or had gone to America like he’d wanted to.
“We wait for back up!” she insisted as another portion of fire rained down on them.
Pour inexhaustible, countless, miserable, -
“I just… I dunno. It’s not nice, I guess… to leave just like that,” Harry explained. He wasn’t making much sense at the moment but he’d hoped Draco understood him. He remembered how Ginny would get upset with him when he got too nervous to sleep with her and storm off, leaving him naked and helpless and humiliated.
* * *
There was no way his cock could get any harder, but yet he felt like he was about to come just from the thought of Draco impaling himself on those talented fingers to get ready for him. He would never have imagined that a person who had been lecturing him about pureblood proprieties, was willing to let himself be fucked.
“Protego Maxima!” someone shouted the incantation and he stopped writhing on the floor and begging for mercy.
“You are mental, Malfoy,” he heard and for a moment he thought it was Harry himself looking at him with an exasperated expression on his face. “Come on, let’s go before the nurses kick us both out.”
“Nott saw us... that’s why I needed Granger’s help. He was trying to blackmail me with it,” the blonde explained.
“Right… so you are telling me that you are really his babysitter and not some twat from the ministry that was sent to spy on us?” Draco asked dangerously, palming his wand in the pocket of his muggle three-piece suit.
He couldn’t muster even a glance at the deceased face, presented at the front of the chapel, resting in a lavish white coffin, adorned with a wreath of white roses. In a way, he understood that the body being mourned today could be real Draco Malfoy, but something just didn’t feel right. And Harry was willing to follow that instinct even if it could lead him towards deep denial.
“What are you? My mum?” the blonde rolled his eyes and started rummaging through the supply cabinet.
“Oliver Williamson!” the man introduced himself, “I am appointed as your new probation officer.”
“How did you…” he thought he had been careful, always going out when everyone in his dorm room was sleeping deeply and not letting Malfoy notice him either. He wasn’t sure the Slytherin would appreciate seeing him after Harry did exactly what he forbade him to do: take him to Pomfrey.
“You need to realize that the Orphanage was a dumping ground for undesirable children of Death Eaters for years. The woman who operated it provided everything for them, and she was a tremendous asset in taking down Voldemort. There is only this much the Ministry can do for them,” the Minister said simply.
The man tied to a chair gave her a short laugh, “I won’t be going anywhere with you. You stopped being my daughter the moment you turned to Dumbledore!”
“Auror Baelish did not respond to code crimson last night, and her body was found in the sewer this morning, it looks like she’d been strangled. All her personal belongings as well as her wand were missing. You were among the few people who saw her last.”
Happy Birthday to my fellow Gemini, Draco Malfoy. He's trying his best to do the right thing here :)
I used Liszt's arrangement of Saint-Saens' Danse Macabre that Draco was playing, you can listen to it on YouTube
“Malfoy, you know exactly why I am here, so stop with the bloody bravado and listen for once,” the Gryffindor said tiredly. “I am the primary witness on your case, and you have corroborated every memory I provided. The only thing I need for you is to plea not guilty and let me do the rest.”
Draco had seen endless torture, cold-blooded murder, and people’s minds being invaded almost every day during the war, he could not faint just because of little blood. He summoned some of the healing elixirs and applied them generously over the Gryffindor’s shoulder. The lad would not even flinch, but Draco noticed that his teeth bit his bottom lip hard and tendons in his arms raised tight against his skin when he gripped the edge of the bath.
“Very well, you may use it then,” McGonagall was still looking at him intently. “I give you one hour, Mister Malfoy. Don’t touch anything else in the room, I will know.”
It was there... the new melody, the twang of 13 nylon strings as quick fingers ran over them creating the polyphony of sound.
A body fell to the ground with a loud thud and Draco inhaled soundlessly, he was trying to keep it quiet as long as Yaxley thought he was actually dead. The hand was on his pulse point and then he was shaken once again. He had no chance now. The blonde wished there was a way to notify somebody that he was there. Random images were still swimming in his mind, voices whispering nonsense, and faces that he did not recognize anymore were staring at him.
“Ron… Shit, Ron… is Ginny inside too?” Potter exclaimed not leaving a protective circle of Draco’s embrace.
***** Wakannai - I dunno
“Stop that, you fool! Can’t you see there is a chance that you lot might harm him…” he hissed through his clenched teeth.
“Flattery will not help you, Malfoy,” Granger retorted, crossing her arms, “Why should I do that?”
"The ginger seemed to know me. Is he one from your current job as me?"She asked, her eyes twinkling with amusement.
The mystery is going to continue from now on so hopefully, I will have enough time to add new chapters frequently. It is going to be more than I anticipated but more adventures await!
They spend most of the morning exchanging ideas and theories about the Death Eater’s plan and when it was time for lunch Weasley was smart to decide to leave them alone.
The front door banged open unceremoniously and a squad of angry-looking people went inside, buttons shinning on their crimson uniforms, wands ready to attack and maim and kill if necessary. Aunt Andromeda ran out to them, shouting questions, baby wallowing in her arms incessantly. She was still wearing her nightgown, her hair in a loose braid.
It was so surreal: one could clearly see the smooth stretch of wet glistening tarmac but it was impossible to tell where the motorway was taking them.
It all looked very suspicious, Draco was reluctant to go on the train and kicked him out of his car. Everything suggested that he murdered Elise quite plausible. But on the other hand, he wasn’t a murderer, Harry had spent half of this summer trying to prove it and now it felt like everything was slipping out of his grasp. He really needed some alcohol to calm his nerves.
The liquid burned his throat as he took a big swig from his flask of firewhiskey. For the first time Harry had wished he did not come back from that forest alive.
“Creating an inferius is a criminal offense, miss!” the man objected looking at her wearily.
“Do you reckon, if he’s forgotten that he is a poof he might try to make a pass at Hermione? They have been too chummy recently...”
“For Merlin’s sake, she has a project to finish in the Department of Mysteries!” Hermione exclaimed. “My colleague had the same problem when she transferred to our section.”
The Slytherin had sent ten owls trying to reach his mother in the past three days and he the moment another bird would come back empty clawed was the moment he wanted to hurt himself. The withdrawal made him shiver and be constantly cold and dehydrated, and at those times he would refuse to eat and throw temper tantrums and call Granger a mudblood. Weasley had punched him in the face for that, a dull pain and familiar iron taste in his mouth reminded him that he was still alive.
” he croaked and Williamson let go, his heavy body crushing Harry. “Ron! Ron!... Somebody, help!”
“Janus Thickey,” Kevin replied instantly, “Poor sod, he’s not the first from DMLE to get his brains fried up with the Imperius… But at least I heard they managed to restore some of his memories.”
“Alright, but you owe me, Malfoy!” Granger warned him and took out a parchment to dart down their plan.
"What time is it?" Draco asked.
“BOY-WHO-LIVED REFUSES TO DISCLOSE LYCANTHROPY STATUS”
He mused that he should have learned those himself as an afterthought, but then again only a few months ago he had a vague idea about any sex, let alone the wizarding kind.
The dark-haired boy nodded and finally they were kissing. Malfoy maneuvered them away from the fireplace and they ended up tumbling down on the sofa in the heap of tangled limbs and hot mouths exploring each other. It felt so right, so certain for Harry, he had never kissed anyone like that before. All his apprehensions about it being wrong an unnatural were gone and replaced by the overwhelming desire.
“I think it was his mother, who came over to talk to the Quibbler at the end of July. Remember, we were making a list of people that died and were missing during the war,” the girl explained. “He was in the missing section, as far as I can recall.”
“You have a dangerous magical creature that just attacked a person that you were supposed to protect! And started a goddamn fire!” the blonde snapped back, “I think you have much more important things to attend to!”
Also, I've updated the previous chapter so if you haven't read Harry's memories go check them out...
“Master Potter is nice to elves…” she started speaking in her trembling high-pitched voice. “Master Potter gave an elf a wizard burial… No wizard has ever done that for an elf!”
Well, what can I say,  it has been a while.
“I thought I said no company!” Yaxley bellowed and threw a curse at Draco.
“Not one goddamn bit,” the Gryffindor smiled.
“She’s seven and she’s as hard-headed as you,” Malfoy commented ruffling her black curls affectionately. “Can you do something with that creature?! Her screams are going to get attention!”
“Year three!” the booming voice of Senior Auror Trainer Bernie Savage echoed in the chamber.
, goddammit! Crabbe, you’ve killed our source! You bloody fool…”
“You should be going to the hospital wing… you will smear blood all over the place!”
"We need to deal with such people like Flint swiftly and without mercy,” Kawahara exhaled a cloud of smoke and dropped the cigarette bud into a crystal ash-tray.
“Rayon,” the woman gritted through her teeth. “Can you not smoke? Mr. Smith is already under the third Confundus charm since we started.”
“Er, I do remember that… So is Proudfoot also involved?” Harry pressed on, remembering that the man was at Hogwarts on countless occasions instructing the classes and encouraging the students to enroll in the DMLE Training Programme.
“I haven’t thought about it... much,” Harry replied honestly.
He knew that it was futile to bribe a vampire with money. He clearly was working at the muggle hospital, not for the large salary. The uninhibited access to blood was his main reason, but he probably needed to ration it to avoid suspicion. Hospitals have always had blood shortages without their employees nicking a few bags here and there.
She always looked so fragile these days, Draco often found her just spacing out in the garden or when she had her tea. Narcissa rarely showed her emotions, but he could tell that Lucius’ death was devastating for her.
“Who sent him?” Draco asked, his mind working furiously.
“CODE CRIMSON. ALL AURORS REPORT FOR DUTY!” the Patronus announced in a strict urgent voice of Gawain Robards. They rarely got code crimson anymore. Not after the war.
“Ron! Why are you… asking such questions? It is a bit creepy, don’t you think!” he wanted to hide under the covers just to avoid this conversation.
” she screamed and the priest stopped cackling, he sagged in his chair, lifeless.
“We’re not done! I am trying to explain…” the git kept shouting, oblivious to his problem.
It was all out. Their tentative relationship was twisted around and dissected in one salacious article after another. Rumors mixed around with the truth and printed for all of the wizarding England to gawk and gossip about.
“Harry,” the blonde whispered harshly to the unconscious lad in front of him, “Wake up.”
It was once again apparent how wrong the likes of his late father were about Muggleborns and half-bloods all this time. After speaking closely with Elise and Granger, and Megumi, he understood that there was much more that he could learn from them despite being a pureblood wizard himself.
“Are you out of your goddamn mind, Potter?!” he heard an angry voice.
“I will owl you the schedule for the next meeting, folks. Thank you all for coming! Now let’s have fun and relax!”Lavender concluded, giving the people a big smile.
“That’s still impressive, Malfoy, and I reckoned you…”
The nurse’s voice was distorted and sounded either too low or too high-pitched, Harry couldn’t comprehend at that moment. He scrambled towards the fireplace, frantically trying to keep his mind concentrated on the escape...
She was putting her heavy handbag on the passenger’s seat when she heard a crack of Apparition and somebody was standing right behind her. Her hand gripped her wand instinctively when the person spoke suddenly.
(See the end of the chapter for
...The stars were spinning in the night sky and Draco felt pleasantly devoid of thoughts… his eyelids were heavy but he didn’t want to sleep at all... He could hear even breathing next to him… the rustle of school robes when Potter was getting uncomfortable lying on hard marble… he git wriggled once again and then sat up, looking down at Draco… his eyes seemed glossy with big blown-out pupils...
* * *
“But it is muggle police…” he interrupted her, “They do so much more! I have seen it on the telly!”
A small barn owl knocked on the window of the number 12, and he knew that he couldn’t just ignore it anymore. He picked up an official looking letter from Auror Baelish stating that his visitation request had been granted.
Kreacher came from the kitchen carrying supper on the tray that was twice as big as his body.
“Will you behave?” Harry murmured.
“Protego Maxima!”
“Oh, right… I forgot, not a big fan of brunettes. How about now?” her hair changed its color to blonde, it started to become shorter and shorter.
“He was the last person to speak with Miss Baelish and his car had registered her magical signature. We also found
His aunt saw him cry the previous night. She watched him bury his nose in that ugly sweater and sob like he never did during the war. Andromeda told him a story of how her sister, Bellatrix, had wept before her betrothal to Rodolphus Lestrange.
How could he go on with all there horrific memories coming back to haunt him? And why wasn't he putting more effort into finding his mother? Merlin knows what could have happened to her by now. And Draco was just there doing nothing feeling like he was losing control over the situation. A familiar grip of anxiety made his mind dissociate, he could see a stranger in the mirror, pale and weird and sickly, a cursed mark branded forever into his skin. How could anyone love that? How could he go on living like this?
Harry put the elf down and sat on the floor next to her, charming her a large handkerchief.
What Harry did not expect is to find Hermione’s dot make a sharp detour away from the Library and go down to the dungeons. He saw that she was nearing another label that said Draco Malfoy and was grateful that Ron was too emerged in his chess match to go with him. His friend might try to murder the git. Harry felt some weird sense of foreboding that told him that something fishy was about to happen. Was Malfoy trying to make a move at his friend?
“She has foreseen lots of applause, tips and drinks purchased in this fine establishment in your near future!” The bartender’s voice was amplified by the spell. “Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stage Krystal Ball. Enjoy our Greatest Muggle Hits Extravaganza!”
"It's, "read the room"," Harry corrected."But thanks, Kawahara."
“Not so fast…” he heard Crabbe sneer. “Eneverate!”
“You’re going to have to help yourself then,” he explained to the impatient boy on top of him, and then he couldn’t utter anything coherent anymore, because Harry was holding his erection firmly in his grip and guiding it inside him little by little. He closed his eyes and bit his lips in concentration, his body shivering from this sudden intrusion.
“Elise? You knew Auror Elise Baelish?” Draco asked cautiously, helping the lady with the tea.
“I want my mother to be safe as well. And I need some time… to… to say goodbye,” he admitted.
He knew that the Aurors would be guarding the room where unstable Oliver Williamson was confined to, but he did not expect the guard to be so distracted by the magazine he was reading and the magical wards on the door to give in so easily under his spells. It was way too easy and he was wondering whether someone else had already made sure that the man would not speak the truth.
He was about to doze off in the car for a bit when he noticed a quiet rapping sound on the windscreen. A silver shape of a raven was perched on the front of his car, staring at him with one big glossy eye. Draco cancelled the locking charm and rolled down the window cautiously, letting the Patronus into the vehicle. The raven spoke with the low barking voice of Gawain Robards.
The brunette wriggled around in his tight embrace so they were nose to nose. From up close he could see his fair, almost translucent eyelashes, just barely visible traces of blonde stubble on his jaw and tiny specks of freckles on his nose and cheeks, so unlike a Malfoy persona the boy always aspired to possess. His thin lips were quivering in the sleep and his eyebrows furrowed as though he was dreaming of something unpleasant. He once again marveled at how inexplicably beautiful Draco was. In those stolen washed-out muggle jeans and a cheap polyester sweater, with his fringe falling in his eyes, he looked so human, so approachable, so tender almost. It made Harry’s heartbeat treacherously fast.
"Curious, very curious," Auntie exclaimed, unperturbed by the damage the boy had done to her room."It is likely we are dealing with an Obscurial. Mr. Malfoy, I think it is too dangerous for you to be around this child."
“She’s brilliant,” Becky squealed, completely immersed in the performance.
It was too late already, Draco was dead to him and he had no idea how he would even go about seeing him again. With his current line of work, it was almost impossible.
Now Harry was expected to see a few familiar faces in the crowd that gathered next to the visitor’s entrance in the middle of the muggle London. He wasn’t looking forward to it. He fastened a few gold buttons on his crimson uniform. It looked almost brand new how rarely he’d put it on. Next to him, Megumi Kawahara had cast some spells to adjust her attire. He’d noticed she barely used her wand, as though she never needed one in the first place.
He was unconscious for a long time, his limbs were cold and mouth was dry. Somebody was standing over him, shaking him, begging him to wake up.
He had gotten the news that his mother was taken into protective custody after Yaxley was spotted in Birmingham. They didn’t even have time to talk properly when it happened and he wasn’t allowed to send her any owls. Draco foolishly thought that trying to catch Potter somewhere and ask him to bend the rules a little bit was a good way to go. But when he saw them all, laughing and being merry with the Weaslette in Hogsmeade, he wasn’t sure he needed to even bother with the git anymore.
“I am sorry… I didn’t know,” Draco replied lamely. Once again he fucked up something that was supposed to make them closer to each other. “Aunt Bella… she told me he could torture people with legillimency, so she taught me how to protect my mind… that was the most horrible experience in my life. I learned pretty quickly that to withstand all those things that were happening in my house I needed to imagine that I wasn’t there, that it was happening to someone else…”
"Same question to you! We were on patrol duty when McLaggen heard an explosion!"
They were sitting in the lobby of Crowne Plaza Hotel, trying to look as inauspicious as they could, given Harry’s roughed-up clothes and a bright crimson jacket on the Auror.
“Now we’re talking,” TJ smiled.
His actions spoke better than any words, when he crossed the space between them in quick long strides, cupped Potter’s face in his hands, and kissed him with everything he had. Draco's head was reeling, a long-forgotten euphoria rushing through his veins as he could taste those lips once more, as he could feel that fierce embrace, as he could once again succumb to the madness of being infatuated with this moronically brave boy.
“It’s Malfoy. He’s back on the hook, isn’t he?” she stated.
Approving applause resonated in the room as witches and wizards came closer to the grand piano to listen. The blonde sat down, casting a spell on sheet music to change to his own, and looked at the girl expectantly. She came up to the improvised stage smiling nervously and fidgeting with a layer of her robes. Draco’s fingers touched the keys, playing the introduction, and then she inhaled and started singing in the most heart-shattering soprano he’d ever heard, a slight English accent in her pronunciation:
“They’re fine. They still think nothing happened and the cremation is taking place as we speak;” he replied. He was glad he managed to leave confused Harry with his Aunt and she would be there to take care of him. His fingers touched his lips absentmindedly.
He would never have that with her, as much as he would make himself imagine it. She was a nice, proper girl but a girl nevertheless. Draco would respect her and probably have enough stimulating conversations about art and music and literature not to be completely disappointed by his future wife, but he could never love her, that was obvious.
The Mercedes swerved dangerously as the blonde moved towards the curb and hit the breaks suddenly.
“I am… fine, mother.” Draco said. “How can you determine whether your memory had been tampered with?”
* * *
He felt his stomach churn with anxiety. She knew, she knew everything and was reading him like a book.
“It is because of Malfoy, isn’t it?” Ginny asked. “He made you like that, he… that sleazy, disgusting serpent…”
The Slytherin had to suffer through three waltzes with the lady. Fortunately it wasn’t like Pansy at the Yule Ball, younger Greengrass could dance, her body almost weightless under his hands as he steered her across the ballroom in the frenzy of robes. She smiled at him as they finished their last dance and settled next to big glass doors looking out into the orchard.
“Oliver Williamson?” Potter blurted with eagerness.
“I am afraid they won’t think that house-elf is a valuable witness,” she shook her head.
"Wakannai*****."
He looked around the Hall, trying to find a familiar blonde head. Malfoy was sitting alone. There was quite some distance between him and the other Slytherins. Harry could bet that whatever rubbish the Prophet had been publishing about him didn’t help the matter.
“It was my stupidity that let this happen,” the Gryffindor exhaled.
And then he felt somebody jumping on the bed and grabbing him in a bear hug. A dark-haired head with glasses and a stupid wide Gryffindor smile was assaulting him with kisses on any available parts that were not protected by the blanket and his pajamas.
“And you had doubts before?”
“I saw you talk this morning... do you think he’s going to be alright?” Hermione asked carefully.
“If I start vomiting… don’t take me to Pomfrey, I don’t want to get expelled once she tests me for potion abuse,” Draco warned.
They were in the same wretched corridor: Harry who was gently guided by Kevin and the female Auror who was glaring at them with ever-growing suspicion.
“You asked her to erase his memory?!”
Draco had reunited with Krystal two years ago when she only started her transition. And his connection to Doctor Ito had helped her get all the potions she required. Now the three of them started a tradition of getting together before the 2nd of May and reminiscing about their school days and mourning the loss of Vince in the only way they knew how - getting completely sloshed.
“Which one of them? Me being a queer, or a lycanthrope or the Chosen One?” he asked bitterly.
As his quill was scratching away Draco’s mind inadvertently wandered back to that evening on Halloween. He did not question Potter’s actions, if he had discovered some potentially damaging information about himself he would have done the same without thinking. It was a very Slytherin thing to do. If his father had survived he might need to forget about his preferences to continue the family line. But now, it didn’t matter anymore.
“Harry…” the Slytherin exhaled a puff of smoke, “I think you need to go back to Hogwarts.”
With the flick of her wand, the heavy curtains were pulled away from the window and he could see that it was already sundown, dark snow clouds still lingered in the sky, covering the face of the full moon.
“Mister Williamson,” Harry exhaled, pulling the Cloak off, “I am here to ask a couple of questions.”
“Who?”
“What happened to the letter?” Potter asked tentatively.
He slowly turned around to see Amanda standing there, in the men’s lavatory, a sour expression on her face.
They were on the run and it would only be a matter of time until the DMLE would trace their magical signatures to that lousy muggle abode. He dreaded the moment when he would inevitably end up in Azkaban and never able to see Potter again. There was a slim chance that the Gryffindor would have liked to see him in the first place after he had betrayed his trust and stole his potions. But Draco wanted to pretend that somewhere Harry was still waiting for him and there was some future for them. He would have sworn he saw a silver shadow of a Patronus pass the dirty window before his mother insisted on putting up all the wards and shutting the curtains tight so as not to attract unwanted attention.
“Halt! DMLE! Don’t you dare move, Malfoy!” the girl gritted, firmly holding a wand and pointing it right at his heart.
Harry's palm felt warm as familiar magic rushed through his body. He cast a few healing charms on the blonde and received a grateful smile in return.
“A vampire?” Draco asked quietly. “You trust a vampire in this situation?!”
“They probably knew back then,” the blonde commented, studying the sculpture, the woman was reaching out to the winged youth like she had been yearning for him all her life, obvious passion portrayed in alabaster.
“Tchaikovsky?”
“Obliviated,” the blonde replied shortly.
The muggle hotel they were currently staying in smelled of mold, mothballs, and stale smoke. The walls were covered in sickly beige wallpaper and the bedding had to be cleaned a couple of times with the strongest Scourgify for Draco to be able to sleep on it normally. He would stare into the darkness, his tired eyes tracing cracks in the plaster on the ceiling and his painfully sober mind trying to come up with some sort of plan. Draco might have convinced his mother that he knew what to do when he decided not to ask that Auror for help, but the truth was that he was just trying to survive at that moment.
“Where’s Potter?” she asked immediately.
Seamus had smuggled some Butterbeer and they were all a bit tipsy by the end of the evening.
“I would like a visitation... just once... before Christmas. It will be the first one without Father and I thought…”
* * *
“Oh, I’m starting to doubt that,” the Gryffindor rolled his eyes.
Malfoy’s car was stylish and expensive, it smelled like leather, luxurious air freshener, and menthol cigarettes. Harry remembered that Slytherin smoked after that fiasco at the funeral. It was the stupidest idea to use hairs of the muggle that he’d gotten off with for the Pollyjuice potion to disguise himself, but he did it nevertheless. He just needed to make sure that Draco and Narcissa were actually free.
...Potter chewing his quill in the class like an idiot… Potter flying on the broom all concentration and fervor… Potter biting his lips nervously… Potter laughing together with his friends… Potter taking out his quidditch gear in the locker room… Potter holding out his hand and pulling him away from the fire… Potter kissing him… Potter… Potter… Potter… Harry…
“Was mistress bad to you?” he asked studying countless injuries on Pibsy’s small arms and legs.
His best friend had bitterly reminded him of the remainder of the Christmas Eve at the Burrow and him running into the living room, making everyone jump out of their seats and demanding to drop everything and go rescue Malfoy. It was definitely not one of his proudest moments however after seeing that bloody Patronus Harry forgot about everything, anxious feeling of desperation overpowering him.
“Do what?”
And then he lost all the ability to breathe because Draco was on him, pressing their mouths together, stealing any way for Harry to escape his grasp, his fingers moving lower between his arse cheeks. A couple of murmured spells and he felt himself being stretched by those long fingers, the ones who could run so effortlessly over the piano keys and make the instrument sing the most beautiful melody. It was weird at first and quite uncomfortable but then when he saw the way Draco was looking at him, the way his hands trembled when he tried not to make it too bad, he knew that he could trust him to get his body to feel the same, to light it up with pleasure.
“Shall we go?” Draco suggested lightly, not wanting to stay inside that gaunt and sterile room longer than necessary.
He almost got used to the dull pain he always felt in his chest every time he walked around this house and reminded himself of Sirius, pranks that Fred and George pulled, and the members the Order. The overwhelming guilt was his familiar companion and somehow this foggy feeling had become the new norm for Harry these days.
“I see. I’ll try my best, I promise,” he said seriously, catching her gaze in the mirror.
“Draco?” Harry was insulted by this lack of response to his touch, his face stung and his wound was throbbing painfully under the bandages.
“Draco, dear, how are you holding up?” his mother asked gently.
“All of them, I guess,” Ginny snickered. “I know you can become one hell of an Auror, and if those bastards start at it again, I swear I will...”
“It was you who ratted me out,” he replied and stuck his nose into the pillow too tired to be arguing with the twat.
Finally, Weasley emerged from his hideout, came up to where Draco was crouching and holding the kid in his arm, and pointed his wand at them.
” the boy shouted.
It was obvious that Flint wouldn’t just show up at the door to greet the collectors with tea and scones but it was probably no use explaining that to not so sharp goons employed only to rough someone up.  Draco felt like he had been taken back to school times when Crabbe and Goyle were following him around and were itching to beat someone up if they knew they could get away with it. The thought of them was unnerving under the circumstances.
“No. The offer stands. I do work for the CIA, have been working for them for quite a long time.” Elise replied. “But we will be going to the USA with one more person.”
"Mister Potter, I am asking you for the last time… What were you doing in the hospital room of our suspect?” Gawain Robards’ face was as red as uncle Vernon’s would be when he was especially furious, but he tried to keep his voice as calm as possible.
“I am sorry, kid.” Elise Baelish was next to him. She put a comforting hand on his shoulder and lifted her wand to his temple.
She brought the wand to poor sod’s temple and murmured: “
An old lady that had been walking her fluffy dog was now standing not far from them and watching their argument curiously. She finally cleared her throat audibly and made the blonde look in her direction.
Maybe Potter would actually want to smother Draco after all, that would be the least he could do.
“I don’t feel like talking about it, okay?” Harry replied defensively.
“I wish I weren’t such an insufferable tosser back then,” Draco murmured back. His fingers left Harry’s grip and were running through his dark locks.
It has been almost two weeks since his mother and him were released on probation, Potter had kept his word and the cases did not even go to trial. There was enough evidence presented at the preliminary hearing and the Wizengamot had reluctantly settled off court. They still had to pay the reparations, so the estate in Wiltshire would be auctioned off soon, his mother would have to live in a small apartment issued by the Ministry and do her community service. And he had to go back to Hogwarts to sit his N.E.W.T.S. Draco was to have a meeting with his probation officer scheduled every month. He was not looking forward to it.
“Would you rather Savage chew you for slacking right now?” Kawahara lifted her dark eyebrow at him.
“Because I feel like it...” the Gryffindor said and leaned over to press his lips to Draco’s chastely.
“For fuck’s sake, Potter… don’t get your wand in a twist, I am asking hypothetically… You’ve made it perfectly clear that you are with the Weaslette now,” Malfoy huffed.
“No! No, please, don’t make me…” he felt tears rolling down his face.
“I guess…” he agreed.
Green eyes widened in shock and before Draco could press his wand to the bastard’s throat, he Disapparated.
“Malfoy! What were you... d-doing there... with Nott?” Potter asked warningly.
Draco had been enveloped by somebody’s protective magic and then he noticed Potter standing behind him and holding the shield.
Guilt overpowered everything else in Harry’s mind, and he felt completely broken by the end of that speech. He wasn’t a hero who defeated Voldemort and brought freedom and peace to the wizarding world. He was a coward who sauntered around night London in the body of the wolf every full moon and during the day he had no problem pretending like he was just one of the Aurors, who conducted raids on lycanthropes and arrested them.
Draco thought morbidly.
All those memories Draco had managed to retract from the house elf and from the Aurors herself made complete sense now. She worked for the Order of the Phoenix and spied on her father who had hoped that she would go in his footsteps.
As Draco had suspected before: the matron from the orphanage was involved in Elise’s death and Williamson was just a muscle to do the deed. Poor man had been used by both of those horrible people, no wonder his mind was so confused he did not even know who he was speaking to.
“Harry, where are you going?” his girlfriend called after him.
” Malfoy chanted and pointed Harry’s wand into the sky as a large glowing green skull appeared in the air, a snake coming out of its mouth.
“It looks like it, Mr. Potter. Do you have any idea what that can mean?”
“Alright, Potter,” she said teasingly. “but you need to get out of your bed soon. Unless you want me to climb in and catch that cold?”
“To England… This place is clearly not helping you. And I have seen that muggle relations chick posing as your sister, I don’t think it is going to work out,” TJ finally lowered his wand.
“By doing absolutely fucking nothing!” the blonde smirked bitterly, letting go of his embrace abruptly.
“Morning,” Potter smiled, looking strangely out of sorts. “Are you alright?”
“Oh, you poor thing. What are you going to do with a child when you need Blaise to mother you into sobriety these days?” Krystal asked worryingly.
But the suffocating sensation did not stop, the air was leaving his lungs painfully and Harry opened his eyes to see a person wearing crimson robes like Elise did, but it wasn’t her it was Auror Williamson trying to smother him in his hospital bed. Harry tried to reach something to hit him with but he just managed to throw a bunch of potion glasses on the floor.
Williamson looked around suspiciously and took out a blank envelope out of the inner pocket of his jacket.
“TJ, have some decency and zip up your trousers at least,” he commented on the man’s appearance.“I wonder, do you fuck every Kawahara’s employee?”
“Get to the car!” Draco shouted, pointing at the vehicle that was already driving to them, jumping over the curb with the insane speed.
“What?… What is it?! Help! Help me!” Harry screamed trying to get away from his beastly doppelganger.
“Your mother has recently been discharged from Saint Mungo’s,” Williamson mentioned, “your letters to her have been very uninformative, are you trying not to upset her?”
“May I ask the name of said person?” Draco tried his best not to sound too intrigued about it.
“Are you going to babble on and on and never let me sleep in peace?”
“Let’s go, Harvey! Do you drink cocktails?”Becky dragged him to the bar without getting an answer.
Megumi Kawahara was the eldest daughter of a leader of what was once Japan’s most notorious crime syndicate. Now she and her younger brother Makoto had fled the country and settled in London, along with their father and a few devoted employees of the clan. Fumihiro Kawahara was Draco’s current employer and a muggle man with two magical children that brought him mostly headaches. Almost everyone in the remains of the group was not a wizard, except for the Kawahara siblings. They inherited the abilities from their mother, whom nobody liked to mention frequently. Her death was presumably a sore subject.
Harry tried to concentrate again on casting a stag but the animal was there, it was very odd, it was almost laughable how stupid he seemed to himself. He remembered how Tonks’ Patronus turned to a wolf when she was in love with Remus.
“Elise, how is your Auror training? I heard you are leaving soon for New York?” the woman asks.
She was wary of those who needed to get the potion for a child in such a back-alley way. As her experience showed a lot of them weren’t good people.
“Hey, are you alive over there?” he could hear that unmistakable Southern drawl and opened his eyes reluctantly. “Can’t you at least turn on the AC, since you’re staying ‘ere all day?”
He wanted them to be gone, he cried and he scratched at his arm where the hideous brand reminded him his worth, he pounded the walls until his knuckles bled and hurt and he couldn’t dissociate anymore. The melody would not come, the keys would not move in his mind, the piano was standing still, wood rotting, varnish bubbling up and peeling off, strings rusting and snapping. At those moments he felt like a little child who wandered into Grandpa's old study and opened the dusty cupboard to see the Bogart for the first time. It looked like his father, wearing his impeccable Ministry robes and holding a cane, an expression of disdain on his face. Lucius was never shy to use something he called proper rearing with Draco, he never beat him but one look full of scorn and disappointment, one venomous comment was enough to make his little son curl up and spend all night in tears.
“We will take it from here,” said one of them. “DLME! Mister Malfoy, you are under arrest. You are suspected of the murder of Elise Baelish.”
“Harry, I think you’re being a bit paranoid,” Hermione commented, pouring herself another cup of tea.
“Mr. Abraham, do you mind waiting outside until we finish?” the nurse gave him a warm smile.
“You should be careful next time you decide to do potions with Malfoy... People will talk!” she warned him.
“Who’s at the wheel, then?” she cocked her head curiously, nodding towards the silhouette on Harry’s right.
“Probably not…” the dark-haired lad mused, “but I am able to defend myself properly…”
“Long story. Nott was plotting something against Malfoy and it was… somehow related to me as well,” Harry threw a successful offensive jinx at Ron, while he was distracted.
He forgot how to make words, his tongue felt like a useless muscle flopping around inside his mouth, so he just shook his head.
“Can I… Can I have some too?” Potter asked quietly, not taking his gaze away from the glass.
The morning was a mess, he barely dragged manic Potter from the fireplace, the Gryffindor was trying to 'fix everything' like he always did. Apparently asking Lovegood to print something in her father’s shady rag was his bright idea.
“Well, the Wizarding law has something similar, to preserve… erm, the continuation of the magical bloodlines. The homosexual relationships and the promotion of such relationships are discouraged.” Auror Baelish said, eyeing him intently.
“Sir, don’t you remember your orders? Auror Proudfoot was supposed to deal with Lucius and my task was the woman and the kid. These people knew too much,” the man looked at him suspiciously.
“You have no power over me, you hag!
Draco shuddered unpleasantly when a few branches made a loud crack under his feet. The ethereal light of his arctic fox was illuminating the way into the forest, but he still felt queasy and slightly frightened. He hated the woods ever since that cruel and absolutely disturbing detention during his first year at Hogwarts. No matter if he was eleven or twenty years old, he would prefer to never step into the dark forest again. Draco was holding his wand in one hand and a muggle gun in another , fingers firmly gripping cold metal. He moved slowly deeper into the forest, trying to spot anything out of the ordinary on his way.
“You, sir,” Williamson blurted without hesitation.
But before he could even stand onto his feet the protective spells rang in his ears declaring that there was an intruder on the premises.
He could hear that distant melody he had always imagined when he needed to dissociate. He followed the sound and soon there was no cinema around them, only silent pleasant darkness…
“You may do that,” the blonde replied calmly, “Or you may actually want to see what is in this room.”
“Should I… return the favor?” the dark-haired lad suggested after they broke off.
“Is there a boy… that you love?” Astoria asked, continuing to spin around.
August was almost over. The sun was shining mercilessly and turning rich landscapes of Wiltshire into a sea of burnt grass and dust. Draco stepped out of a muggle Mercedes onto the pavement in front of the Smith, Smith & Smith Funeral Home. He opened the passenger door and helped his mother out of the car. She was wearing a muggle black dress and a mourning veil on her pillbox hat. Draco adjusted his tie and exhaled nervously, then walked inside the mortuary holding Narcissa's hand.
“It is indeed... She had a dangerous job,” Auntie said and sipped her tea nonchalantly, “Why are you so interested in poor Lizzy here, Mr. Malfoy?”
“He had to be stopped...” the girl said, replying to his thoughts, her wand hand was still shaking, but Draco couldn’t tell if it was from the shock or anger, “Bob... will you help me with the body?”
“Harry, Harry, are you in here? What happened?!” Granger yelled, what a busybody.
“I will give you your wand back if you promise not to call… or kill anyone. Remember I am a Legillimens I will know if you try,” the blonde suggested and Amanda reluctantly nodded.
“How could you?!” was the first thing he heard when he stepped out of the cellar.
*** Kakushite, barete shimau kara! - Hide, you will be recognized!
“Nah, too much of a hustle.” TJ had probably sensed the wayward magic crackling in the air around Draco and decided not to provoke him further, “Besides, sensei’s hung like a hippogriff. I seriously underestimated him… you know, for a Japanese man.”
Draco outstretched his hand tentatively towards the child and he slowly turned towards him, tears rolling down his frightened face.
“Stupefy!” the spell hit Nott in between his shoulder blades with such force that he fell on the floor his nose breaking with a loud crunch.
McLaggen was still thankfully unconscious. He had suffered a couple of minor injuries and was currently splayed on another table, waiting for his turn. Megumi and her bodyguard were sitting on the stools, talking between each other in hushed Japanese. The boy from Malfoy Manor was petting Megumi's white wolf lovingly. And Draco was nervously fidgeting with his robes and trying to decide what to do with the two Aurors.
Draco couldn’t believe his eyes: three Gryffindors were having a shouting match over him in this office. He met Potter in the Atrium looking disheveled and ready to Stupefy the Aurors who had brought him at any time. After making quite a scene he managed to persuade them not to drag him to the holding cell and wait for McGonagall here.
“But I will keep an eye on him, just you know, to be sure,” his friend glared and Malfoy once again.
“Why did you take the potion?” Malfoy was relentless with his sudden interrogation, “For all you know, it could have been a poison.”
Draco contemplated.
“A muggle?” he gaped at her, astonished at the revelation.
“Catch!” Draco produced another vial and threw it up in the air, the git caught it with the Seeker’s precision. He looked at it for a moment, shrugged his shoulders, and took a big sip.
Why was everyone making such a fuss all of a sudden? It’s not like he was any of their concern. Nobody cares about him anyway. Potter probably cared, since he was trying to manhandle him into sobriety.
“I… love you,” he whispered, knowing damn well that the other lad wouldn’t be able to hear it.
“H-how do I know, it’s really you?” the blonde asked as an afterthought.
PS. I am sorry about your father.
They passed the Whitechapel and were nearing the old abandoned wizarding neighborhood, where the orphanage was located. Before the Dark Lord’s terror on the magical and muggle population alike, many wizards preferred living close together in those charmed Victorian and Edwardian townhouses. But as random murders and disappearances and muggle-born purges became a common thing, those streets were forgotten and houses left behind, the wealthier hiding away in their country estates. The only building that survived was St. Barbara’s Orphanage, it was probably protected by very powerful pure-blood magic, judging by the sign of Salazar Slytherin on the door.
“This…” he moved up to press his lips to Harry’s for a brief moment and then withdrew putting his head back into another boys’ lap.
“How much longer?” the widow asked harshly, her voice low and raspy and very not lady-like. She yanked on the fabric of her lace blouse irritably. “And what is this shite made of? I feel like it’s giving me a rash already.”
As soon as his mother’s face disappeared in the flames he decided to get high again. He rummaged through his robes’ inner pocket until he remembered where the second vial had gone.
“But the fight is not over! The battle is not won! Every day I and many other people like me face discrimination and ostracism in the wizarding world!”
“Look what you made me do, Potter!” the blonde went over to assess the damage and then fixed the worst of it with a simple Reparo. Then he’d cast a muggle repelling and a disillusioning charm and opened the driver’s door. “Where to?”
“Listen,” Baelish said after a while. “I think you might want to know why I even work for the ministry… It’s because of Albus Dumbledore and a disaster that happened with Sirius Black. When the Dark Lord first came to power, many of his followers and those who opposed him were trying to become immune to Veritaserum. Purebloods like Black were more skilled in Occlumency due to natural inclinations, and thus were more likely to fight the potion, so of course, nobody would even bother giving him the serum. If they had, they’d known he was innocent. I moved across the Pond to study legilimency and Dumbledore persuaded a good portion of Wizengamot to employ a mind-reader into their due process protocols. So that a pureblood ponce like you might have a fighting chance.”
“Fine!” Malfoy snapped. “ Do as you wish, Potter. But I contacted Granger and she is here to pick you up, so explain all of that to her. I do not wish to remain next to a delusional prick who is a danger to himself and others for that matter!”
“You don’t know what you’re asking for, Potter.” the Slytherin said simply, “It’s not something you give up that easily.”
“It’s fine now, I was a bigger berk there…” Harry patted her back, comfortingly, “I knew about your parents, and still did this…”
Draco had heard of familiars before, but those were usually magical beasts that would come to the aid of a witch or a wizard. However, in modern times nobody used them anymore, and most magical creatures were treated as pets rather than equals. The concept of a shikigami was completely foreign to him, since very little of Japanese magical tradition was described in literature he came across at Hogwarts.
“Ronald, I told you that I would be working on the Memory restoring elixir. Well, Malfoy is my partner on this project,” she huffed and flicked a quick Episkey at Slytherin’s sore face.
Draco stood there completely speechless, he couldn’t believe that a righteous Auror such as Elise was capable of murdering someone. Let alone her father, even though he probably truly deserved it.
“Vespertilio…” Weaslette shouted. A bat bogey hex, how original.
Неистощимые, неисчислимые, —
There was a loud metallic screeching sound, then another. Draco whipped his head towards the noise. It was coming from a black muggle device propped on the coffee table next to a Bible and a yellowed room service menu. A telephone was ringing loudly at the ungodly hour in the morning. He picked up, blood rushing in his ears, cleared his throat, and said:
“Do you reckon there are any films left?” Harry asked and climbed the rickety stairs to the projector room.
Draco was mortified with the look the menacing bodyguard, Ootani, was giving him when he knocked politely on the door to Megumi’s room. She answered after a few minutes of fumbling. The girl was wearing a colorful muggle one-sie with a plush dragon head on the hood. Draco expected something like that to be found in his four-year-old cousin’s wardrobe. What an utter child she was.
They settled against each other, with Harry’s head in Draco’s lap and their fingers firmly laced. The blonde removed the other boy’s spectacles and gazed into those amazing emerald green eyes. He was staring at them so closely he was able to see the little specks of black and brown in the irises.
“We have a memory from the said eyewitness. I need you to corroborate their statement”
He was a stocky man in his late thirties and sported a couple of visible battle scars on his face and hands. He reminded Harry of Charlie Weasley a bit, mostly because of how uncomfortable the man looked in the dress shirt and tie.
“Don’t cry… darling… I’m alright,” he whispered and felt tears running down his cheeks incessantly.
“Mister Malfoy, this is not the way you should be speaking to your probation officer, is it? Besides this tampering had saved your stupid arse, so I would kindly suggest for you to take a seat and shut your bloody mouth.”
… a snowy bird is hooting in the brand new cage… a huge burly man with black tangled beard and dark glinting eyes gives him a wide smile holding two outrageously big cones with ice-cream… a giant motorbike is racing across the sky… the large man is holding something in his arms… a baby in the cocoon of blankets… a flash of green light and a woman’s scream…
“Oh yeah,” Malfoy replied bitterly, “As soon as you come off the Philtre you will start to regret it big time. I suggest we both leave before it happens…”
“Is she a pureblood, a half-blood? Is she even human?” Harry huffed, frustrated that he didn’t receive any tangible information.
“What should we do?” Harry’s whisper tickled his ear.
Draco closed his eyes shamefully, he didn’t want her to stand up for him like that, he didn’t need it. He could have just listened to his mother and did what he was told because it was his duty as the sole heir of the family to do so. He didn’t have any other siblings to cover for his mistakes and he realized that completely. What aunt Andromeda suggested offered too much freedom. And it was always frightening to have too much freedom.
* * *
“I need you to tell me something, it would only be a minute…” Draco said, quickly disarming him.
“So, you were up in my business since January because you wanted to recruit me?”
“Just bear with it for a bit, it’s not like I have enough Polyjuice to last you the whole day,” Amanda gave him another annoyed glance and sent a barrage of spells towards a curious undertaker who was bored waiting so instead he decided to eavesdrop.
“Listen, you will not get away with it. So just give up,” she reminded him, “I’m arresting you!”
“What do you want?! Are you planning to finally arrest me?” Draco gritted.
“I know, that’s why I want to finish my writing in peace and go to the pub.”  Ron’s partner shooed Harry away from his seat. And instead of dealing with his load of application forms, he started rearranging the knick-knacks that toppled accidentally.
“Mate, why would she make you bloody tea instead of reporting you to Savage then?” Ron asked. “She barely knows you. I don’t think anyone would risk getting dishonorably discharged from the force for a stranger.”
“Whoa, 27? Are you planning some sort of fancy dress party? Or have you finally found someone willing to impersonate Potter so you can get your prick wet for once?” another crafty grin danced on the lad’s face.
“You should be! You need to fix it! And don’t ask for my help until you do!” she exclaimed and went away to the girls’ dormitories.
He felt the crown of Potter’s head touch his own and then there was finally blessed silence…
“And your father suspects nothing?” Draco laughed incredulously.
He sat at the grand piano, letting his hands hover over the black and white keys and closed his eyes, concentrating on the melody in his mind. It was an unusual one this time. Modern and muggle, and it was a song rather than an instrumental piece. Draco recalled purchasing a record at the music shop in Soho and being so proud of himself for stepping out of his comfort zone.
“There must be more… the location of this memory was in the confidential letter and yours was…”
“I erm… must have lost it when Nott disarmed me…” Hermione said, quickly passing her wand behind her back for Harry to hide. “It is still in the corridor... probably."
“Of course she was!” Martha exclaimed, “Tell him! Tell Harry! It’s true!”
“I would appreciate it if our conversation stayed between us,“ Malfoy said. “The child is not mine, and he refuses to speak, or maybe he can’t speak at all. There are signs of abuse on his body… Imprints from silver objects, like spoons and whatnot.”
“I am not saying she has made good decisions in recent years, but she can help.” she protested. “Auntie had been working with squibs and obscurials all her life. She knows how to make that child speak again. I promise you she won’t harm him.”
“You know, this is not how it works. It’s not a murder, Harry,” she said probably in the umpteenth time, “Narcissa Malfoy had identified the body and they found the hawthorn wand next to him. I am afraid, that was enough to confirm that it was indeed Draco.”
“Duddley, Vernon Duddley,” the Slytherin answered for Harry, giving him a not so subtle look that said
It is almost over I hope you stay until the end
“And when I was at that concert... nobody would’ve known about me playing there until your arse was there and so were the reporters! Can’t you see that every time you’re trying to help it just costs me and my family! You stalled the trials and my father was murdered by the vengeful Auror because we didn’t get what we deserved!” he was screaming, angry tears spilling from his eyes, and fists clenched ready for a punch. “You fucked with my memories… you could just let me rot in Azkaban, but no, you had to go there and be a bloody knight in shining armor! I am not your little project, Potter! You need to stop!”
“Take care, Mr. Malfoy, and say thank you to Krystal and her friends for letting the LA host meetings at her club. The members were delighted and...”Healer Cameron trailed off when Malfoy disapparated without saying a word.
“No clue. Let’s get out of here… I think you’re bleeding,” the brunette suggested and rummaged for his wand.
This time Harry came first, letting out one more strangled cry and squeezing his muscles almost painfully. He was gasping something incomprehensible, his arms clinging to Draco’s neck as the blonde thrust into him a couple more times before losing himself in his own pleasure.
“Draco?” Harry replied and fumbled with the safety belt, trying to free himself. “What?… What happened?”
“I cannot do anything to her. The Occlumency is too strong for me,” he whispered angrily.
"Read the atmosphere, you plonker," Megumi muttered to herself.
Harry reminded himself that most of these children had lived through the war as he and the rest of Hogwarts had. They had probably heard instructions like these from their parents and guardians countless times when they were at risk of a search or a Death Eater attack. He felt saddened because their childhood was stolen by Voldemort and his followers.
“Thank you, Mister Potter,” the lady said looking at him earnestly, “Gentlemen, would you like some tea?”
“We’re cornered here!” the Gryffindor noted, “If she’s going to attack, we…”
“Thank you,” he said sincerely, giving the girl a small smile.
“I will explain everything when we are in the Burrow,” Harry said finally letting go of the Slytherin and hastily wiping his eyes with the sleeve of his jumper.
He felt a sharp pull of the seat-belt on his chest and midriff as the moving car came to a sudden halt. His head hit something soft and big and inflated as he heard the windshield crack dangerously. He gingerly tried moving his arms, pushing away the annoying airbag, and looked towards the driver’s seat. The other person was alive but there was blood on his hiking jacket.
Harry was about to engage in some awkward small talk when the fireplace in the sitting room roared to life with green flames. Auror Proudfoot stepped out of the fire, his wand ready, and looked around the room incredulously.
Cannenta Cameron was the one everyone called Chimera in the ward, her nasty temper and crude gallows humor was one of the reasons. Harry was a bit scared of the woman, there was an uncanny resemblance to old Snape, even though the lady was fiercely protective over her patients.
“He’d probably killed him as well…” the lad muttered, he wanted to see that body again, to check for any signs of bite marks.
“How’s Auror training?” Cho asked after a brief silence.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I didn't disappear, I was working." Draco protested.
“That bloody ferret. First he gets Hermione to brew potions with him and now you get a detention because of him.” said the ginger, giving the Slytherin a nasty glare across the room,  “Not to mention that the git fancied you!”
He could still hear her sneering voice in his head when she saw the memory of him snogging one of his French cousins in the backseat of that very Mercedes, while they were practicing Occlumency.
His heart skipped a beat, he was wandless and at the mercy of those people in the room. He looked at the agent and then at the vampire and suddenly everything clicked and the pieces of this elaborate puzzle were put into place.
Draco had never seen any magical spirit like that before. It looked completely real, but the muggles like most of Megumi's family weren't able to see it.
“I always liked driving at night,” somebody said from the backseat. A female voice.
He simply nodded, not willing to let go of him just yet. The door opened for a moment, there was an intake of breath and then it closed with a careful thud.
"Well, did you stick your mobile up your bum by any chance? Cause nobody has heard from you since last weekend!" Megumi sulked.
“Neville! Do you remember Auror Williamson? Wasn’t he the one who was at the Department of Mysteries?” he asked.
“Harry! Harry! Wake up!” he called, agitated.
“Very well,”  the doctor nodded. “Did you remove the damaged tissue?”
“Are you alright?” Harry shook him gently and the grey eyes opened slowly.
“Why do you think I can’t just use Legillimency on you and get the answers myself?” the Death Eater retorted.
Harry looked around belatedly noticing rainbow flags on the walls of the establishment and a couple of men sitting too close to each other.
“Draco, dear, don’t forget to smile,” his mother said through clenched teeth presenting her gloved hand to be kissed by one important person after the other.
“You look amazing, love. You do,” he complimented her and Krystal gave him a disapproving huff.
Harry blushed profusely, not certain whether he should even finish the second cup of that tea. It had helped, though, the sensory overload he had been experiencing since morning was suddenly manageable enough.
, he exhales a secret over Draco’s ear, and after that he is asleep…
“Don’t go in there, Malfoy!” the girl whispered urgently. “There might be an inferius!”
“So you’re saying Elise hid the memories in the orphanage… That’s completely insane who would even think of that?!” the ginger exclaimed in disbelief.
“And you’re telling me all this, because?” Draco lifted an eyebrow.
“Oh,” was a simple reply. Harry was relieved that he hadn’t started mocking him. “Why weren’t you ready?”
In gloomy autumn flow as night time spate.
“I escaped Granger’s prodding me with her muggle contraptions. And I reckon, I might know a bit more since I got all my memories back,” the Slytherin sat down in the armchair beside him looking at the array of paperwork around them with curiosity.
“D-Dontcha start yourself” Potter replied, slurring his words. He looked sickly and pale, his hair was even messier than usual and his body shivering. “I ac-actually need t-to talk to ya.”
The spirit vanished when it finished croaking the message. Code Yellow meant a werewolf attack. Draco looked out of the window into the dark woods. The kid had taken two portions of Wolfsbane before that night. It couldn’t have been him. He would likely just run around through the forest for a bit, maybe chase some animal there. Lycanthropes who drank the potions remained conscious in their wolf state and wouldn’t try harming a human. But he still wanted to look for him in case the potion was botched or its effects manifested themselves differently in a child.
“Millie?! Martha?! You there?!” the Slytherin shouted, he looked around the room, dreading to find a corpse or two.
Harry hid by the tall plant with large purple leaves and saw a little enchanted replica of the forest with pine trees and beds of moss and bushes of fern everywhere. The fern was radiating red glow from many little blossoms among the dark green leaves. It was a mesmerizing sight to behold but he also noticed that there were three figures opposite from Malfoy and the elf. Yaxley and another man who was holding Narcissa Malfoy at the wand point. He couldn’t see the man’s face properly because of the dark but he stank of blood and sweat quite strongly.
He was dry heaving, once again Draco was pulled back to that night, the night of his failure. He shut his eyes, trying to stop the shameful tears from spilling, trying not to vomit his tea and biscuits, trying to keep some semblance of self-restraint.
“Wake the fuck up! Wake up! You insufferable berk!” Malfoy was screaming at him and shaking him and slapping his cheeks.
“Ron… I’ve left her not because of Draco,” Harry replied, “I was confused… about a lot of things and me and Ginny… I thought it would keep me away from those unclear feelings, but the more I tried being with her… the more it was all going to shit.”
* * *
“I told you not to bring me here, you tosser,” he whispered fondly and tried to make himself comfortable once again.
The blonde came with the strangled sob, leaving Harry’s hand and his stomach covered in semen.
"Bob, you can be certain that mister Kawahara will generously compensate you for the inconvenience," Draco explained, and Bloodwood lifted his eyebrows in disbelief.
“Excited about Hogwarts?” Elise asked teasingly when she sat in the passenger seat of a posh black car Malfoy was driving. “Let’s park somewhere discreet, so I can give you back your precious recollections.”
“To cope, I guess... and then I started fighting with Ginny and it was the only thing that made me forget,” Harry quite liked being this candid with someone. Malfoy was still as snarky and prickly as ever, but somehow he didn’t feel awkward to talk about these things with him. Maybe because they were going through similar experiences.
“What have you taken?! Tell me, you need to tell me… right now, Malfoy!” his voice was concerned.
After a few seconds of silence the cover popped open with a loud sound and the boy climbed out of the car. He staggered a little, trying to stand up properly, and slowly looked up at the night sky and the bright disk of the moon. And then he ran into the woods, paying no mind to the car or it's slightly terrified driver.
A small disclaimer: Megumi has a foul mouth in this chapter, so excuse the slurs.
“Malfoy is innocent. I am sure he had nothing to do with it!” Harry protested.
* * *
“I won’t! There have been three months without me turning! It won’t happen, Draco!” Harry lied.
“Are you going to tell on me again?” he asked through clenched teeth looking at the muggle.
“If you hate Aurors that much, why do you want to be one of them?” Potter asked after a while. “You signed up for the Training Programme.”
“What’ve you got in your pocket?” asked Hermione suspiciously.
Amanda on the other hand had been merrily chatting away all through their night vigil at Harry’s bedside. She had even confessed that Elise’s untimely death was the reason she infiltrated the DMLE in the first place. Apparently, they were partners and not strictly in the work-related fashion. Draco realized at that moment why she was affected by the veela’s call. He started wondering what it would be like if he and Harry were working together, would he be able to protect him as much as Amanda tried with the Baelish girl, or would their relationship be in the way of him thinking clearly and making the right decisions.
“I dunno,” Draco grumbled, he was going through the medical satchel and examining one orange bottle of pills after another, obviously looking for a fix.
“Слёзы людские, о слёзы людские,
“Fancy meeting you here, Malfoy!” he heard a voice somewhere up in the snowy sky.
It looks like Draco started to notice that something is off about Potter. Let's see how long they are going to dance around each other ;)
“Nobody you need to be worried about… for now,” TJ shrugged his shoulders.
“Wayward magic, huh? What are you, five, Malfoy?! Pull your shit together, man!” TJ scolded him.
Harry did not expect to find himself at the entrance to such an establishment. He once had an accident of walking into a muggle gay bar while being completely pissed, but this time he was completely sober. The envelope he had received from Lavender Brown at the Battle of Hogwarts Memorial contained an invitation of a sort to the group that was supposed to gather at this very place, this very evening. It was called Lycanthropes Anonymous. And after a few especially annoying arguments with Hermione, Harry was fed up enough to agree at least to see what it was all about. So far it had looked more like a party than the quiet meeting he anticipated, but Harry was not about to listen to his best friend nagging again, so he bit the bullet and went inside.
“Merlin’s bollocks, it’s hard…” he croaked, “Why am I in the muggle hospital anyway?”
(See the end of the chapter for
He opened his eyes to realize that they had spent the night in that abandoned theater. Draco had transfigured some blankets, and they were huddled against each other on the enlarged cinema seats. The blonde’s long limbs were wrapped around Harry and his hot breath on his neck was reminding him of their previous shenanigans and making little prickles of desire spread all over his body. Before he would never have guessed that a posh and cold pureblood was so demanding for human touch.
Malfoy laughed sardonically. It was silly of her to mention Aurors to a former Death Eater, who was presumed dead by the general public.
“Please…” his face looked ugly, tears in his eyes and snot and drool coming out of his nose and mouth.
“How could you! What happened… why didn’t you wake me up!” Harry was shouting at him.
“Mmm-hmm”
“Alright,” Harry agreed, “Congrats on making it on the team. You will be...”
“Luna, I need that list as soon as possible,” Harry demanded urgently.
“Thanks,” Harry smiled. He didn’t expect Malfoy to do anything like that, he wondered whether he was able to restore his memory. He blushed involuntarily at the thought.
...a female Auror has a verbal altercation with a woman and rushes out of the building, throwing a couple of curses back at the lady…
Harry was afraid that all his efforts to conceal his inevitable changes from the werewolf bite were in vain, that somehow Draco managed to see the truth in his mind the night before.
“I am not a bloody Gryffindor, Granger… I will make sure to plan everything,” he replied taking ‘The Count of Monte Cristo’ away from the girl.
“Oh... just came back for my sudoku magazine,” the tanned lad told him, “Don’t you have to be in a group therapy?”
“Get in!” he heard and limped toward the vehicle.
In a way, it was TJ’s fault that Draco got involved in this mess, to begin with. He had introduced him to Fumihiro Kawahara and thus made him into a criminal without any way out. At first, it was drugs that kept Draco on the short leash. He was depressed and completely heartbroken when he had to cut things off with Harry and popping pills and potions was helping him not to think about it. That was why he had no choice but to accept more and more jobs from Kawahara to be able to afford his habit.
“Mate, you’re in there?!... What the hell?!” Weasley was standing there with a big fur tree under his arm, a box of Christmas ornaments that had been levitating in the air before fell to the floor.
“I have no clue, sir,” Harry genuinely had no idea what happened to his best friend. His memory was very foggy about the whole ordeal, he only said something about McLaggen barging into some wizarding home.
Harry reached out to unbutton his shirt but long fingers stopped him and Draco looked at him intently.
“As if you weren’t sneaking away every night to check on him in the hospital wing,” Hermione deadpanned.
Megumi gave him a wry smile.
She stood up and moved towards the pews, and then looked around the chapel, her blue eyes boring into the faces of the mourners. The electronic organ started playing something different. It sounded unlike most of the previous melodies Harry had heard and it was making him feel a bit queasy. There was this inexplicable fog in his mind and he tried blinking a couple of times to shake it off, but he couldn’t. He noticed the whole congregation staring at Narcissa Malfoy, as though she was entrancing them.
Harry walked into a muggle pub, sat at the bar and tried not to think about anything anymore. There still was 20 quid in his pocket - plenty enough to get himself properly hammered.
...There is a struggle, and he sees Potter prying a bunch of wands off his hands, and he lets him... he simply relaxes his grip and lets him escape, armed, with his very wand...
There is going to be some action in the next chapter if you know what I mean, stay tuned :)
“I just did… I’ve never even thought that girls might be attractive or whatnot,” Draco explained. “Have you thought that you might not be completely straight?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Mister Potter has asked to speak to you in person. You will meet with him and you will behave!” the Auror said in frustration.
“Oh, right…
* * *
“What? What are you doin’ here, sweet peach?” Isaiah grinned as nothing had happened.
Draco waited for her at the platform 9 and three quarters until almost every student boarded the Hogwarts Express. Nobody showed up.
They were still in the muggle neighborhood, so he couldn’t cast any spell on the man to see if he was actually Pollyjuiced. So Draco just sat on the bench in front of the funeral home and nervously lit a cigarette with a muggle lighter.
“Get off of me, you faggot!” Theodore whined angrily.
“I’m-a sleep… if you feel like going… you go, okay.” Potter said and it felt like he wasn’t addressing him, “Luna promised to owl… tomorrow.”
And then she saw it. A copy of today’s Quibbler still fresh from the printing press was in Auror’s hands, giant red letters screamed “ORPHANS’ MEMORIES ALTERED. MINISTRY OBLIVIOUS. WHISTLE-BLOWER REPORTS”.
The room looked as though an erumpent ran through it when he came back from breakfast. Two nurses were going through all of his belongings, emptying the drawers full of his nick-knacks unceremoniously onto the bed, pulling off the bedding, and ripping into the pillowcases. One of them took him by the arm and half-dragged him into the small bathroom attached to the room.
It was very cold inside the dungeon-like hospital morgue and eerily quiet. A muggle screen was working in the distance, flashing the images without any sound. An empty paper cup was propped up on one of the slabs and colorful chocolate wrappers were littering the working desk.
Granger came to his holding cell one day, she brought some of his normal clothes and muggle books and even tea and biscuits. She sat next to him on the shaky bunk and looked at him pityingly.
It was a euphemism for hauling stunners and stinging hexes at the peaceful protesters until they all disapparated. Sometimes arrogant twats like McLaggen would itch to arrest a few unfortunate ones, but mostly it was discouraged especially in the muggle areas.
Draco was stuck on that little glimpse of memory that had burst through the fog. His french cousin… he couldn’t recall his name but he remembered how he tasted, how it felt to touch him, how he was aroused by the pliant body in his arms. They’d only fooled around, but Draco thought that maybe there were others. Someone he’d forgotten, someone he was made to forget.
He dreaded his friends’ reaction to the fact that Draco had started using again and stole some of his painkillers when he left. They would probably start accusing him of being a treacherous Slytherin snake or something along those lines.
“How are you feeling now, mate?” Ron asked him when Harry drank the potion.
“So how are you going to get back to Hogwarts?” the Gryffindor asked, trying to change the topic.
“Auntie?! Stop this, please!” the Slytherin pleaded. “Let him go!”
The door with two serpents was still there although the Victorian house fell into a state of disrepair. The garden looked unkempt and overgrown and the walkway had still rotting leaves plastered to the stone from the previous autumn. All the windows of the house had their curtains tightly shut and the one he and Harry had blasted open was bolted in with thick wooden planks.
“Vengeance?!” Auntie laughed and hew voice sounded like a cry of the bird of prey. “You sure have a taste for dramatics, Potter… It is just the case of a destroyed reputation. I just want others to treat you like they treat me now… as a dangerous predator, that shouldn’t be around children.”
It was likely Flint's fault. Draco had no doubt that the Undersecretary treated the child worse than a house elf, and now he became like that. Frightened, wary of strangers and completely unsocialised.
It was a peculiar sort of torture for Draco. To be so close to him, to spar with him, to exchange a friendly banter over lunch, and then to realise that he perceived Draco as no more than a stranger. It was Megumi that was making Potter a cup of tea or pissing off McLaggen when he said something bigoted. For him Draco Malfoy was dead and gone and no amount of memories that he had stolen from Elise and sent to Harry would prove otherwise. Potter might have known the truth about what happened three years ago, but he moved on and would not be looking for a ghost of teenage infatuation anymore.
Malfoy let out a bitter laugh and continued to stare at her unperturbed.
“I dunno… the war had barely ended… I had a lot on my mind..”
The laboratory was eerily quiet. No potions were bubbling in the enormous cauldrons that stood in the neat rows and almost filled the whole room. There weren’t even any residue fumes in the air. As though everything had been scrubbed clean in time for a DMLE raid. Draco hated it when it happened because then he would need to wait at least a month for his order to be brewed again. It was one of many workshops of a bona fide potion genius, Doctor Ken Ito. Kawahara had scouted him somehow through his mysterious connections in the wizarding and muggle criminal underworld.
