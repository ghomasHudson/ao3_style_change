They were packing up, having covered quite a bit surprisingly, despite Harry being somewhat unable to focus after coming out.
Topics covered: References to past abuse (during parole meetings), mentions of needles, McG being a BAMF.
And so Draco had found himself in the library three times a week, helping Harry with Potions. After that, getting physical contact had become fairly easy and the bond stayed at an almost comfortable level for almost a whole day each time.
Back at the front she addressed the class. “Okay, you may lift the charm now, or you may vanish your potions and leave, your choice.” A mumble broke out all over the class and multiple voices spoke the counter charm. Harry hesitated for a moment before he too said, “Finite Incantatem”, holding his breath for a second and then, finally, inhaling.
Panic struck Draco at the thought of being alone with the stranger, even though he logically knew that he would be fine. Both Professor McGonagall and Gemma had noticed though, and the Professor rushed to reassure him.
Also after this there are two chapters and the epilogue left to go, so the story should be complete sometime next week.
Before he could think too much about it, Pansy spoke up, “Okay, so Blaise and Hannah are working on their History of Magic assignments, while Hermione and I are doing the Ancient Runes translation. I don’t know what you still need to work on, but we were planning to all go over Potions again in an hour or so. Depends how fast we get through our essays.”
“Malfoy! Wait!” Potter called, and hurried footsteps came closer. A hand reached out and caught Draco’s robes. With a herculean effort Draco managed to not flinch at the physical contact but scowled at the Gryffindor instead. He remained silent.
Draco had a few hours before he had to head to Astronomy and he still needed to finish his essay; he had put off writing it for the sole reason of needing a book from the library and never finding the energy to actually go. So of course he was stuck with going now, when loads of other students were sure to be there too.
“Well, are you gonna take it? I didn’t carry this here for you to just look at it.” she shrugged his awe off and pressed the plate into his hands. Then she reached into her robe pocket and offered Draco a set of cutlery, wrapped in a napkin. Draco took both and sat cross-legged onto his bed. Pansy carefully hung her robes and joined him.
Draco was silent for a moment but eventually said, “It’s okay. I  would have… liked you to like it if I had been awake.” They smiled coyly at each other.
Draco reaches up with his right hand, closing his fingers around Harry’s neck while careful not to push pressure on the windpipe and guides his cock into Harry.
“Never have I ever been interested in a guy.” Before Harry really registered the question, Draco had thrown back another shot. That meant that Draco Malfoy was interested in a guy. Only when Draco mumbled “So much for that” did Harry realise that he had forgotten to take a shot himself. Hastily he poured the liquid into his mouth, coughing when the liquor nearly went into his airways. Draco raised an eyebrow.
Taking a few deep breaths she began more calmly, “Look, I know you won’t believe me, but the other Eighth years aren't so bad okay? Apparently Granger and Potter had some talk with them about forgiveness, and they almost treat Blaise and I normally.”
“Try not to worry too much. This is just to see if we’d feel comfortable working with each other in the following months. Now, to make this easier on you, I will take out my wand and lay it on the table, so you can keep an eye on it. Feel free to keep your own wand in hand, if it makes you feel safe.” Gemma did as announced and slowly put her wand on the table.
His eyes snapped up as he realized where he knew the smell from. A soft, “Draco” fell from his mouth involuntarily and within a fracture of a second his eyes had focused on the blond in question only to find that he was already looking at Harry too. Blushing vehemently, Harry averted his eyes in an instant. While looking away he noticed that Malfoys table was already clean, not a trace of the potion to be found.
The little boy nodded with enthusiasm and Draco watched his hair change from blue to white blonde. ‘Inherited his mother's gift then’ he thought as he put the eleventh cookie into the bag and closed it. He went back to his cash register where Potter still stood and asked the man whether he would want anything else.
When Draco opened the doors to the Room of Requirement to actually reveal the potions lab, Harry’s face fell.
“Thank you then, Hermione.” Draco answered smoothly, slipping into the manners that had been drilled into him from early on. Nonetheless, he was surprisingly excited about the offer. Maybe Gra- Hermione had indeed forgiven him.
“We should talk about this before we get too into it.” Draco insists, ignoring Harry’s grumbled “bit too late, don’t you think?”
Once Harry had calmed down completely, Draco dismissed the silencing spell around them and the laughter of the circle hit them like a front. Momentarily panicking that they were laughing about him, Draco took stock of his surroundings and noticed that Hannah Abott had gone red next to Neville. Her boyfriend gently nudged her and whispered something in her ear that did nothing to diminish the redness. Draco calmed.
“shut it OFF!” came a sleepy grumbling from behind him.  When Harry rolled over to turn off his alarm, a hand fell from his hip.
They talked avidly throughout their whole meal, keeping their topics light and friendly. Harry talked about Teddy’s current obsession with dragons after reading a muggle fairy tale, and how Andromeda was glad to have Harry to watch over their little ball of energy. Draco felt queasy asking for the current condition of his estranged aunt.
“So I know you’re normally more of a salted potatoes and veggies person for dinner, but sometimes you take the rice with the spring onions and paprika as well, so I got you both. There’s also enough pudding to function as a whole meal, just in case the session went that bad. Oh, and one of the older elves insisted that I take some of those chocolate and pear muffins?”
Draco savoured the embrace for a few seconds and then gently pulled himself away from Pansy. “I can do this.” he said out loud and Pansy smiled encouragingly at him.
Staring at the parchment in front of him, Draco missed Potter nodding, only looking up when the dark haired man said that he did know.
Rolling his eyes — rather ineffective thing to do while invisible — Harry answered, “You know I can.” Thursdays were Ron and Hermione’s ‘couple time’ and it was also Harry’s and Draco’s most common date night. At least when Draco managed to sneak off.
“Oh darling, I have eyes. Of course I knew. So that leaves the how and when. Both are rather simple. How: You’ve been spending a lot of time with him in those potion tutoring sessions. So you got close. When: It can’t have been before Christmas, he seemed too surprised at the drinking game. If I had to guess it was sometime in the last two weeks. You have been rather cozy at meal times with him since then.”
A few days later and Draco was certain of three things: One, that the time he could spend without touching Harry had reduced itself to 12 hours; two, that the pull of the bond was becoming stronger at an alarming rate; and three, that the symptoms had changed, so now he felt pins and needles in his chest — the point where the bond was located — and the tiredness had evolved to being all encompassing, to the point where simply blinking was too much effort. Needless to say, this had only made him crankier.
They had a brief chat about what Potter did for work, in which Draco learned that the Saviour had actually quit the Aurors years ago and now taught intercultural classes for wizards and witches. Meaning he taught muggle borns about wizarding customs and wizarding folx about muggle customs. Draco thought it rather fascinating to see Potter get so passionate about his work.
“Merlin, Dragon. I forgot how responsive you are.” Blaise muttered but Draco suspected that everyone heard in the absolute silence of the common room.
When Draco entered with Harry, both still looking a bit sleepy, David raised a knowing eyebrow and winked at Draco who in return only rolled his eyes. “Good morning David, do you still have room for 2?” he asked, knowing the answer would be yes. David would rather seat him in his own living room than send him away. David smiled and led them to a small table in the corner.
Judging from the guilty look on Harry’s face, he hadn’t. In an effort to reassure him, Draco said “It’s not that bad. But you know I am aiming for a potions mastery and even without my reputation making it worse, most Potions Masters expect top marks.”
The door opened into a cozy sitting room, not unlike a smaller version of their common room. There were a few mismatched sofas and armchairs placed in a loose circle around a small table, a fireplace and a wall littered with windows completed the room. A corner of Draco’s mind supplied that they must be magical windows, as each one gave view to a different scenery. The main part of his brain was occupied with keeping his body in control, trying to stop his hands from shaking and his legs from running away. He walked towards the door.
“I was the youngest, the… softest in a group of bastards.” McGonagall nodded in acknowledgement when Draco paused.
Instead of hanging around after class to talk to McGonagall, Draco followed the Headmistress to her office to use the floo. With all the studying, socialising and overall
Harry mirrored his position on the other side of the couch and agreed, motioning for Draco to start.
Draco had to admit that it made sense. Realising that they were nearly at the classroom by then, he quickly told Pansy to keep it secret, even from Blaise. They entered the classroom just as Pansy promised her silence.
It didn’t matter that Harry hadn’t behaved any differently that morning compared to any other morning before their kiss. Or at least that was what Draco told himself as he ascended the stairs to the Headmistresses office.
Harry thought about the question for a moment. “I do actually. Let’s play Never Have I Ever. We still take copious amounts of shots but it doesn’t feel so much like alcoholism.” Malfoy raised an eyebrow and Harry launched into an explanation, “You make a statement starting with Never have I ever and if you have done the thing mentioned, you have to take a shot. For example: Never have I ever lived in a manor.”
“I somehow can’t believe you spent most of the holidays reading textbooks. There must have been something more than just Potions and the Weasleys.”
“Never have I ever used a charm in a way that it wasn’t supposed to be used.” It was phrased broad enough that Draco had to think back on the time he used Reparo on a wound as he hadn’t known any healing spells. Grimacing, he reached for his shot and downed it, reminding himself that he would never have to resort to such methods again. He was safe and he had learned proper healing spells. There was no need to worry.
It had surprised him how similar muggle baking was to potions and while he was allowed to do magic again, he kept his baking mostly muggle, only some time sensitive situations were aided by magic. He was —  after all —  the only employee.
They found themselves outside of “Starlight and Moonshine”, a place Draco had never heard of. It looked cozy and empty. Harry confidently opened the door and beckoned Draco to go in.
Barely keeping it together Draco shook his head and quickly headed towards his room. He couldn't deal with this right now, couldn’t break down here in the common room when dinner was almost over. The tears he’d held back for quite some time now, were threatening to fall.
“I know this is weird before the first date, but you could join me, your bed is big enough for two and I promise not to do anything untoward.” Harry said rather sleepily. And he was right. Draco had a big bed, liking the comfort of having the space, and there was definitely room for them to share. And the couch was rather uncomfortable…
“Uhm, well…” Harry hesitated and took a deep breath. “I think Hermione is onto us. I might have been a tad nervous at dinner…”
Harry gasped and Draco was about to pull back, when he felt a hand at the back of his head, stroking over the buzzed parts of his undercut and keeping him from pulling away. And suddenly Draco could taste more of Harry, could feel the heat of Harry’s tongue against his. Without really thinking about it, he pulled Harry closer still, their once chaste kiss turning heated. Draco’s brain gave up on thinking all together.
“Watch it,” Draco snarled anyway, albeit a bit half-heartedly and pushed past Harry Potter and into the great hall. Only once Draco sat and had secured himself some porridge did he take a deep breath; with his daily run-in with Potter already out of the way he could spend the day actually paying attention in class.
Suddenly his expression changed into something more sheepish. “Uhm, I actually meant that bit about keeping the coming out and any relationship stuff separate. It’s just that… you know, coming out will get ugly enough once the press catches wind of it and I really don’t want anyone accusing you of ‘turning me queer’ or something.”
“Never have I ever had gay thoughts.” He stated, raising his shot in the general direction of Draco and Pansy.
“Okay I´ll bite. Where did you get this robe? Where are we? And what´s going on? Why are we the only ones here? Even you couldn´t-.. Okay you could but you wouldn´t.”
After the initial rush, he felt it necessary to clarify something. “And you want to keep it secret, right?”
Reality hit him like a brick and he went still. Harry hadn’t come to kiss him of his own volition. It was a dare. To top it all off, Harry was absolutely pissed, and the chances of him even remembering the kiss the next morning were slim to none. A single tear slid down Draco’s cheek, and he tried to push the Gryffindor off of him. But Harry wouldn’t budge, instead he held on, mumbling something incomprehensible. Accepting his doom, Draco let him be and looked around the room.
Without a warning Malfoy grabbed his wrist and raised his hand to eye level. “Your predominant mount is Jupiter, no surprise here, but you also have very clear upper and lower Mars mounts.”
“I’m fine Blaise. You can go with him. No need to cancel on your partners for me.” Draco murmured and gently pulled himself off of the other’s chest.
“I was about to cast an unforgivable on you, knowing full well what it would entail. I think we’re even on that. I might have even deserved worse.” Draco mumbled, looking down at the table.
Draco interrupted him at this point, “Relax, it’s not as if we had a date or anything,” he shrugged, aiming for nonchalance but he still could hear the hint of irritation in his voice.
A surprising lack of noise confronted Draco when he opened the door to the Room of Requirement that evening. It wasn’t completely silent but on his way up the stairs he had imagined loud music and people screaming at each other just to be heard. Instead there was the normal noise of people chatting with each other like they did in the common rooms.
Harry automatically reached his arm up and cupped Draco’s face. He leaned forward and, before his brain could catch up with him, gently placed his lips on Draco’s. A shocked mewl escaped Draco’s throat before Harry felt the others' lips softening and moving against his, kissing him back.
Wearing the school uniform felt utterly ridiculous when going home for the holidays, and wearing the muggle-style clothes he usually wore around Hogwarts didn’t bode well for meeting his mother. While Narcissa had renounced her ways regarding blood status and supremacy, she still considered muggle fashion weird and said so often enough in the letters she sent Draco. Better not to chance it by wearing it for his first visit home in months.
On the inside Draco fretted that holidays spent reading potions books and visiting a friend for a day or two shouldn’t count as someone’s best holiday season, but he knew about Harry’s homelife now and how he usually spent the holidays in the castle. While Christmas at Hogwarts wasn’t all that bad it clearly didn’t compete with spending it with a loving family. Still he couldn’t refrain from commenting.
“Won’t last long — so close— ” Draco panted against Harry’s lips, which only encouraged him more. He buried his lips in Draco’s neck, sucking at the soft spot behind his ear. Draco brought his hands down, grabbing Harry’s arse, feeling the muscles in his back work, and encouraging him to keep going.
The surprise being: Draco Malfoy has proposed to his long term partner Harry Potter! Both fiancés were unavailable for a comment but were seen holding hands on a stroll through Diagon Alley yesterday evening; Mister Potter’s hand noticeably adorned with the well chosen engagement ring.
“It’s not worth it Ron,” Harry admonished him. “He’ll just do it more often.” Even though he said it with his best impression of disdain, he was secretly hoping for more hallway run-ins and shoves. After all, it meant that he would walk away with at least a note tugged into his hand or bag, mostly containing only a compliment or a thought Draco had had throughout the day that he wanted to share with Harry. Sometimes though, the notes were simply a time and place. Harry favoured those above all, because those notes meant that Draco would find enough time to sneak away from his friends and duties for them to have an actual date.
Draco sat in his room, willing his hands to stop shaking and his heart to stop racing. The others were still downstairs at the feast, and the dreaded party wasn’t planned to start for at least another hour; Draco was still under no obligation to go, but nonetheless his hands were jittery and clammy. He had tried to read for a while but had given up after having read the same paragraph five times without actually retaining any of its content. So he sat and waited.
This chapter deals with mentions of past (canon) events, scars, mental breakdowns and self destructive behaviour in the form of hair pulling.
“What do you want?” There it was again, the fear in his voice. Harry wondered if he really thought Harry would blackmail him, despite not knowing what Harry knew.
“What the fuck Potter?” Draco heard Blaise exclaim and found he shared the sentiment. What the fuck indeed.
“I thought I did.” he mumbled almost in defeat, his eyes steadily downcast. He could have said no, could have presented himself as a victim but he really had wanted to become a death eater. Had dreamed about it even, until he knew what exactly being a Death Eater meant. It had been too late to back out then, everyone already thought him one at that point, despite not being marked at that time.
The train would be leaving in an hour and Draco still wasn’t dressed or packed. The latter simply because he kept pulling clothes out of his trunk to consider them only to then chuck them back in, deeming them unfitting. He had been trying to get dressed for the better part of an hour and every single outfit felt wrong.
After giving the password to the stone guard Draco stepped onto the winding staircase, suddenly dreading the meeting. With each centimeter closer to the door, his mind was less able to ignore his nerves and slowly his giddiness from the previous night was taken over by unease.
Over the ringing in his ears and the tight feeling in his chest Draco could only think about how the comparison would have been a compliment to him years ago. Now it felt like an insult. Lucius Malfoy was a bastard, a horrible father, and an even worse person and Draco had finally managed to see that. He didn’t want to be compared to the man he had once loved so blindly and each new word felt like another dagger in his chest.
Draco could only nod. Speaking would only set Mr. Morris into more of a mood. He had learned that the hard way during their first meeting where the bastard had managed to restrict Draco’s access to Dreamless Sleep, simply because he dared to answer a question. Saying that he had slept badly the whole summer would be an understatement.
“I, on the other hand, still need to do that. Apologize I mean. I- I am deeply sorry for my role in the war. For what I did to you specifically. I know it’s not really worth anything but I never wanted you dead… I… just didn’t know how to get out.”
He smiled, “Hello Teddy, it’s so nice to meet you. My name is Draco. What can I help you with today?”
Hesitantly grabbing a muffin of his own, Harry settled into the pillow next to Draco. While Draco ate, Harry prattled on about the latest gossip he had overheard at the dinner table.  While he wasn’t nearly as informed as Pansy tended to be, Draco enjoyed the weird familiarity of eating and listening to the dinner reports.
“Pathetic. You skipped the whole hand shape and according to you I don’t even have a heart line. But I guess you really do think that.” Before Harry could take another look at the heart line (he had completely forgotten about that one), Malfoy pulled his hand away and beckoned Harry to place his hand on the table. “Let me show you how to properly do this.”
Draco shuddered at the name and McGonagall noticed. Tensed, he blurted out, “Could you please call me Draco and not … by my surname?” The moment the words had left him, he wished he could take them back. This was not what he wanted to talk about and on top of that it was stupid. Heat rose in his cheeks.
“Malfoy!” came a call when Draco was about to exit the Charms classroom. “Do you have a moment?” Potter hurried to catch up with him, joining Draco on his way to the kitchen. “I have a free period after lunch and wanted to get started on the potions essay, but to be honest I only understood two thirds of what Armado was talking about.”
Even though the bond hadn’t really bothered Draco in the past six months, Harry still worried. “Yeah I’m fine. Can’t I just miss my boyfriend?” he answered lightly and propped himself up to reach Harry’s face.
Taking his first bite Draco realised just what he had been missing out on. Even the simple porridge tasted bloody fantastic — the house elves really knew how to cook — and the experience was enough to override his queasy stomach.With a bit more enthusiasm, Draco ate another bite.
Suddenly self conscious, Draco tugged lightly at a few strands. “Minor breakdown.” he mumbled, clearly uncomfortable talking about it in greater detail just then. Luckily, Blaise snapped out of his stupor and picked up on it, as he instead chose to focus on Draco’s clothes.
After the lesson, when all of them were on the way out, Harry had held Draco back to the blond’s surprise.
It has been over a year if not longer since I started writing this story and in some ways it has grown to be something close to me, no matter how much I cursed while writing it. It is the reason I know one of my best friends.
Suddenly Draco felt self-conscious about his appearance. While the previous nervosity had stemmed from the unease of having everyone stare at him, he now needed the reassurance that Harry liked his transformation. That Harry thought he looked good.
All thoughts about Blaise, Neville and Hannah disappeared from mind when Draco began eating his muffin and Pansy casually mentioned their breakfast plans for the upcoming Saturday. In the privacy of his dorms Draco found the energy to actually fight the idea but of course Pansy wouldn’t hear it. Inside this little bubble they had built, life seemed nearly perfect; Draco ate, he slept, he socialised even.  Inside their little bubble there were no bullies, no hateful glances, no insults, and no hands balled into fists making contact with porcelain white skin. Not that Pansy knew about those in the first place. Draco prided himself on his glamours.
He shook the thought out of his head, he really didn’t have the time for a wank now, better not to think about his dream Adonis for now.
Realizing how that probably sounded to Potter, Draco hastily added, “Not that that excuses anything! I know it doesn’t! I just don’t know how to tell you how very deeply sorry I am.”
“It’s nothing, mother.” Draco tried to reassure her but he could tell that it wasn’t working. The sad look on her face was the reason Draco had never been able to keep secrets from his mother. “It was just the reaction people had upon seeing me at the station.”
Harry could feel his brain short-circuit, every nerve ending stood aflame with desire, happiness and warmth. The heat of Draco’s lips and tongue, the taste of them, was better than anything Harry had imagined. A heavenly mixture of sweet and just right, and in combination with the smell of Draco’s cologne and the dusty classroom it became too much to process. Harry lost himself in the way Draco moved his lips against his own and, when Draco snaked a hand into his hair to pull him even closer, he let out a low moan.
“You want to willingly spend time. With ME.” the Slytherin emphasized incredulously. They stared at each other for a few seconds before Potter looked down, his hand scratching at his neck.
Shaking hands lay the brush back onto the dresser. Another quick check in the mirror and Draco felt as ready as he was going to get. Pansy walked towards him when he stepped outside his dorm, clearly on her way to fetch him.
Draco was surprised at that, Blaise was never one to lose his temper so there must have been more to it and Pansy knew that as well.
A tentative hand on his arm ripped Draco out of his discussion with Hermione, causing him to flinch slightly. Pansy smiled apologetically and asked if he had a moment, shooting a sharp glance at Hermione. Confused, Draco signalled her to go ahead. With another glance at Hermione, Pansy began, “So, I know Saturday was a bit of a… well bad idea in the end, but up until that point I thought it went rather well.”
Understanding the meaning behind the words, Harry takes a step back. “You own the cottage? But…” He let his objection fade out, trying to sort his head.
“I need a favour,” Draco asked immediately after closing his door. “I overslept today and haven’t had breakfast. Would you bring me some food when you return from lunch?”
Draco’s brain short circuited, unsure whether he hadn’t just imagined the words. Only when Harry’s hopeful face turned sad and hurt did he realize that he hadn’t imagined them and he hurried to say, “Yes. Please-... Yes you can kiss me.”
Laughing softly at the name, Harry gave him a peck and whispered back, “The wedding isn’t until next year you git.” Even the former insult sounded like a declaration of love from his lips.
‘Because I was horny and couldn’t deal with you moaning my name’ Harry thought but aloud he said, “I didn’t want you to know that I know. I originally didn’t even plan on telling you that I heard you until I slipped this morning.”
Draco pushes himself onto his elbows and checks the mirror over his shoulder, chuckling at the sight. “I told you to tear me to shreds, and I would gladly let you do it again.” he says and Harry doesn’t miss the glint in his eyes.
Before he can answer, they are interrupted by the waitress bringing their entree. “Chestnut soup with port wine and chocolate, bon apetit.”
The muggle hair stylist looked positively shocked when Draco revealed his hair but regained his composure quickly when Draco asked him to fix it. During the haircut, Draco endured several compliments on his hair colour, innerly shuddering at the words. The compliments regarding his hair care routine however, he took with pride.
“PITY?” bellowed Harry. “Ever thought I might help you simply because I care? You could have told me! Of course I would have helped!”
“You’re being so good to me” Draco praises him again and begins anew to push into him, slowly building up speed and pressure again.
“That’s not true.” Draco said in a small voice, thinking about that day in September, years ago, where all he had wanted was to be his friend. Clearing his throat he spoke up, “I don’t hate you Potter. I understand if you still hate me, but I don’t hate you, not anymore. And even back when I did hate you, I never wanted you dead.” It somehow felt oddly important to drive that point home.
Nodding at her suggestion, Draco took a moment to think about possible questions. In the end he settled on the most pressing, “What do you already know about me?”
“I don’t even know.” Harry lamented, throwing his hands up. He groaned in frustration, before leaning towards Draco and placing his head on his shoulder. On the outside Draco remained calm, while on the inside he was once again freaking out. The other’s head felt heavenly on his shoulder, the perfect weight and warmth and he could feel himself losing the fight against his rising hope. His brain was replaying their drunken kiss near the end of the last party, jumping to conclusions and leaving him yearning for the touch of those warm lips on his.
Draco only repeated that he did not have one, which earned him a punch into the stomach. The ropes kept him from keeling over like his body wanted to, and instead he felt his abdominal muscles contract, forcing all of the air out of his lungs. It was by sheer will alone that he didn’t cry out at the impact; the only sound audible was him heaving for air.
In the end Teddy couldn’t decide on 10 cookies, he wanted one of every dragon AND a mermaid after all. Draco stole a glance at Potter, who was watching him and raised an eyebrow in a question he wasn’t sure would be understood. The other man just rolled his eyes but grinned and made a show of reading the menu above Draco.
A cough interrupted his thoughts, Potter was actually looking at him now. Green eyes piercing right into Draco’s soul, or so it felt.
Completing Hogwarts? This could give him the small chance for a future he had stopped imagining a long time ago. A chance to one day maybe find work, enroll in a magical university or start an apprenticeship. The odds were still against him but most of that was due to prejudice rather than factual disadvantages.
“How was dinner?” Draco asked, not having had the energy to go to the Great Hall himself after the previous evening. While nothing bad had happened, dinner still took a toll on his social batteries and he wasn’t yet at a point where he could make it every day. At least he had managed to go to breakfast and lunch with Pansy and Hermione the whole week.
“Guess I’ll be blind throughout dinner tonight then.” Draco snarled sarcastically but took the clue. They would both be missed if they spent much longer in the little alcove.
“I’m so sorry to force you out like this,” Harry mumbled, when the blond had finished crying and pulled away from him.  He really should have thought all of this through before just confronting Malfoy with it.
So Draco had done nothing and evaded Potter all together along with everyone else. Which now seemed stupid as Potter strode right towards their little gathering, and Draco was still rooted to his seat, his mind running.
Potter settled into step next to Draco and Draco wasn’t surprised that Potter had had problems following the potions lecture. With how much basic knowledge he was missing, Draco was more surprised that the other could keep up at all.
Sometime during that, Harry had let his hands slide out of the blond hair and now that he lies on his back, Draco on top of him anew, he opts for reaching for the buttons of Draco’s dark dress shirt. His plan gets thwarted when Draco intercepts his hands and forcefully pushes them into the mattress. Harry struggles against him but Draco is stronger and even manages to switch to holding him down with only one hand. With the free hand he pulls his wand out of his jean pocket and when he spells ropes onto Harry’s wrists, Harry feels another surge of lust racing through his body. He moans loudly, pulling at the ropes slightly only to realise that Draco must have anchored them in the headboard. The thought only turns him on more.
With his mother stuck inside, Draco didn’t expect much in regards to presents. He had, however, asked Pansy to bring him something from Hogsmeade for Narcissa, because she deserved it and Draco loved giving her gifts. So when he pushed the small box containing a beautiful silver necklace imbued with a protection charm for the wearer over the breakfast table to his mother, he was surprised to receive both a book and a letter in return.
“Never have I ever been caught in the act.” Harry repeated out loud, which earned Draco an angry look by Blaise, but he didn’t care. Blaise drank together with Seamus and Hermione, the latter blushing profusely at the manic cackling from Ginny beside her.
Suddenly Harry wishes Malfoy would pull his collar tighter, so that he can feel his blood struggle to flow into his brain, but he doesn’t. Instead Malfoy leans his head closer to Harry’s and whispers in his ear, “Notice how I don’t have control over your legs, hips or arms? Try rolling backwards over the other shoulder while grabbing my sleeves.” Shuddering at the breath ghosting across his ear along with the slightest hint of being choked, Harry’s blood suddenly does struggle to flow into his brain, although for completely different reasons.
Draco said a shy “hello” to no one in specific and sat down at the small end of the table, next to Pansy and Hannah.
Afterwards, sticky and sated, they sat kissing, though at a much more leisurely pace. Draco still hadn’t moved from where he was straddling Harry but neither of them cared to change that either.
His “Never have I ever been transformed into ferret” was met with a scowl and an answering, “Never have I ever had atrocious hair” which was followed by “Drink Potter. That rat’s nest is atrocious and you know it.”
This week's chapter is a shorter one and I am sorry for that. But just stay tuned until next week, as chapter 5 will come in with a solid 4k word count :)
A few moments later, Draco saw Potter walk into the common room. He was alone and beelined directly to the table Draco was sitting at. Over his shoulder hung his bag. Arriving at the desk, Potter hesitated for only a moment before he sat down. They sat in silence until Potter cleared his throat and spoke up.
Mr. Potter felt it necessary to emphasize once again, that his sexuality is independent from his current partner and that he would appreciate it if adoring fans would not harass his boyfriend with angry letters.
The common room was quiet for another second before Seamus exclaimed, “Malfoy’s gay??” and all hell broke loose. No one besides Draco noticed Potter slipping away from the group. Draco took another shot as he waited for the noise to die down and then addressed Seamus. “Yes I am. Although I don’t see how that matters to you.” His tipsiness let it sound like a threat.
“No I´m serious! The asshole was so mad at me getting more recognition than him, he acutally threw a temper tantrum. With stomping and flinging himself to the floor and all!”
Granger immediately piped up. “It is so fascinating though?! So many different nuances and details that need to be taken into account. And so much to learn from the texts!”
The stress of the upcoming NEWTs was nearly tangible in the 8th year common room. The table they used for their study group meetings was almost permanently covered in books, parchment and scrolls upon scrolls of notes.
Which is what he heard himself repeat yet again to a surprised Potter. Shortly before Draco could turn and continue on his way back to his dorm, he saw Potter's facial expression change. He looked almost sheepish and a little sad.
“Sure, give me a moment. I am nearly finished with the sentence before that anyway.” There was no sign of anger or resentment in her voice and Draco let out a breath he hadn’t even realized he had been holding.
Once again they grapple but instead of letting Harry push him down again, Malfoy uses one of Harry’s tries to swing himself around and pull Harry on top of him, his pale hands locking themselves into Harry’s collar. Harry feels the pressure on his neck tighten a smidge but never enough to actually choke him. On his back he feels Malfoy’s heartbeat where they’re pressed together.
Before his mind could run too far Granger spoke again, “We are planning a party for Saturday after the Halloween feast. It’s only us eighth years, mainly the study group, so we were planning on just having the party in the common room. Don’t get me wrong, you are of course very welcome to join in on the party, but I wanted to warn you about it, because Pansy mentioned that you don’t really like gatherings right now and I… I kind of noticed that too, to be honest. So whether you will be there or not is completely your choice, but know that you are indeed very welcome if you’d like to join.”
“Headmistress McGonagall reported that your first month at school has been uneventful and that you have shown good behaviour. Is that true?”
“What? No. We never…” Harry clears his throat. “We never got along. I haven’t seen him since we graduated.”
A single tear fell down his cheek as Draco stood to hug Narcissa. Her confession was much more than a simple apology to him. It meant that she chose him over his father, him over herself even, and Draco had rarely felt this close to her.
“Good.” growled Draco while releasing his grip on the other’s hands, moving to tangle his fingers into the black locks and devouring the saviour’s mouth again.
He had been talking with Potter outside the ministry when he thought he felt a spell hit him, but when there weren’t any immediate effects, he ignored it. It wasn’t until he was walking away from Potter that he began to feel the pull.  Some faceless stranger had cast the bonding spell on him as he stood next to the Saviour of the Wizarding World. Or at least that's what Draco suspected based on his research.
When Harry entered the miniature version of the common room, where they had spent the first evening in December, Draco put his book down.
Harry looked elated, eyes bright and a relieved smile on his lips. “But,” Draco began, before he got immediately interrupted by the other man, “But?” his eyebrows drawn together.
Extracting himself from Draco’s hug, Harry sat up and faced him. “I don’t know. But I’m sick of sneaking around like you’re my dirty little secret. It just feels wrong. I love you and I don’t see any reason to hide that.”
“That's not what I meant but nice to know anyhow. I meant our sleeping situation.” Merlin that sounded weird.
AHH my ever beloved alpha/beta/cheerleader/friend Monika finished editing all the chapters SO: have another one in celebration! I'll probably upload another one before the weekend, but we'll see (Screw regular uploading schedules, am I right?)
Afterwards, when the dread had set in, he had decided to screw it all and had changed into his comfort clothes: black muggle jeans, and the dark-blue jumper that was too big on him  (the one with the knitted-in warming charm that he had stolen from Blaise over a year before).
The Room of Requirement looked almost like an exact copy of the potions lab in the dungeons, the only difference being the enchanted windows. Harry wasn’t there yet so Draco took the time to look through the supplied ingredients and equipment, finding them satisfactory. Just as he was considering writing the recipe on the board like Severus had done, Harry arrived. He looked less rumpled than he had in charms that afternoon and in combination with the change of outfit, Draco suspected that he had used the afternoon to shower and change.
“Well for one: your bachelor status, and two: you being queer.” The matter of fact tone in his voice makes Harry feel stupid. Then moments later he understands what Malfoy is insinuating.
So all in all the meeting had exceeded all expectations. No cursing, no dark looks, Morgana! Not even a snide remark from the others against him — well except for Pansy but she didn’t count.
“Shh. Have to kiss you.” His words were slurred and Draco figured that he must have continued drinking, even after their previous game had ended.
Objectively, the process had gone by rather fast. Not that Draco had witnessed a lot of it; the Ministry still did not allow the accused to be present for their court process. So from his position in the holding cells in the cellar of the Ministry of Magic it seemed like a lot more than just 5 weeks.
Grabbing all 10 of them, he set his sights on decorating the dragons as lifelike as possible. With the mermaids, pixies and pegasi he just went for artistic rather than realistic, those were ultimately only fairytales to the muggles.
Draco takes the vial from him and asks, “What’s your safeword?” With only a second hesitation Harry answers, “Umbridge”. Understanding crosses the grey eyes and Draco nods. “I’d normally ask you to pick a non-verbal one too, since I am going to choke you - even if I am only going to restrict your blood flow and not your air supply. But I think tapping out will work for the both of us. Correct?”
The air flowed too fast through his lungs and Draco gripped the edge of the table tightly, trying to get his breathing under control.
Again, she received no verbal answer but Draco leaned forward and to rest his head on her shoulder. His own shoulders were still shaking. Gingerly Pansy reached up to stroke his hair in an effort to comfort him without accidentally hurting him again.
Grumbling under his breath Harry reached for his glass and drank, the alcohol warming his throat on its way down.
The scraping of wooden chairs against the wooden floor pulled him from his thoughts and he looked up to see the rest of their study group clearing their table. A tempus revealed that it was time for dinner. Harry must have noticed too, because he too was packing his books and parchment away.
“No touching my mark, no calling me ‘Malfoy’. Besides that, nothing your submissive little ass would even dare to try.” The sneer is back and Harry loves it.
“Forget it, I-” Malfoy began and Harry realised that he had yet to answer the other. Hastily he interrupted “No, yeah… I’ll… help you.” He was eager to find out what Malfoy had planned. “uhm.. empty classroom on the second floor after dinner?” Malfoy only nodded before walking away.
Harry misses the warmth the moment Draco pulls the slightest bit away and forces his eyes to blink open. A blush spreads on his cheeks again, he is going under far too fast right now. He needs to focus. Blinking again he mumbles, “Which one?”
“It is a matter of trust and personal chemistry,” Gemma added, “Which is why Minerva will be leaving us in a few minutes.”
Stepping out from the official apparition point of Kings Cross and onto Platform 9¾ took a huge toll on Draco. While he had mentally prepared for the thrum of students and parents, the crowd seemed larger than anticipated, especially after the quiet of the manor where he had become accustomed to not being around people.  With his left hand fidgeting with the hem of his comfort sweater, and his right pulling his trunk along, he made his way onto the platform.
Cookies safely stored inside his robe pockets, Draco hurried to his dorm, the halls still sent a shiver down his spine. Once he had reached his dorm, he pulled them out and gently laid them aside. He had his first planned tutoring session with Potter in half an hour and he hoped that the cookies would make for an easier atmosphere.
A sad smile curled around the thin lips before she answered. “Because you deserve to be happy too Mr. Malfoy.”
“What happened? Were you attacked? Are you hurt?” Harry asked once they set moving up the stairs to the 8th year dorms.
Neville and Susan murmured their agreement and just before Blaise could ask the next person, the portrait swung open and Harry Potter stepped into the common room. Instantly Draco felt on edge. He had of course seen Potter in class over the last two months, but he still hadn’t managed to sort out his feelings regarding the saviour.
Draco mumbled his thanks and took the empty seat next to Pansy. Once he was seated, Hermione seemed to have finally recovered her ability to speak as well. “The hair suits you,” she complimented, only to ask moments later, “Are those muggle piercings?”
Harry was pacing when Draco entered their classroom and he kept pacing when Draco settled into his usual cross-legged position on the floor. On Harry’s third round around the small room Draco snapped, “Merlin, sit down. I can’t concentrate if you’re running around like a beheaded chicken.” He had closed his eyes again before Harry could reply.
Groaning Draco buried his head in his hands. Not only did he need to manage physical contact with Harry Potter on the daily, no it had to be meaningful too. Bloody fantastic.
“You should come to our study meeting on Thursday. I know Hannah would love to discuss the Herbology aspect of this assignment with you — She really has been hanging out with Neville a lot lately — in any case, we are pretty productive during these and it is nice to properly connect with people outside one's old gang.”
And Harry has to admit he was, Malfoy outranked him by a lot and he doesn’t know what to expect. Still he answers, “You wish” and attacks. They grapple for a few moments, neither managing to really bring the other down as hands fight for dominance and a better grip. Finally, Harry manages to break Malfoy’s balance and pushes him onto the mat, following suit to pin him to the ground with his own body weight.
They all stared at Potter as he remained silent for uncomfortably long, neither answering nor reaching for his drink. Finally he said, “Maybe the time I was allowed to go to the zoo?” He didn’t sound sure and then muttered, “But then again I didn’t get to eat for a week after that.”
than him. He never had been good at being second best. How was he supposed to ever salvage their relationship?
the people around you? The Headmistress should be checked for an Imperius and while they’re at it they should check Potter too. No way our saviour would willingly testify for scum…”
there were SO MANY comments on the last chapter and I am super happy that you liked it!! I hope this chapter is to your liking as well. I sure feel good about it :)
Draco sneaked a glance at Harry (after pulling his jumper back on), who was still looking dishevelled and half asleep, and pulled together all his courage. “I’m meeting with the girls for breakfast, you want to come?”
Suddenly wide awake, Harry realised that Malfoy was having a bloody sex-dream — right next to him. He fumbled for his wand.
“I guess I never really said it, but I like you too. A lot.” he confessed, gaze fixed on their joined hands.
Wand in hand he dashed out of the room and fled to the kitchen. He would return after a tea, and maybe a cold shower.
The words wash over Harry with excitement and clearance all at once. He sobers up from his drowsy, lust-riddled brain and sits up straighter. “Okay, what do you want to talk about?”
Her excitement turned lofty and she fixed him with her head held high. “I guess I’ll have to remind you of your role in the whole event of my girlfriend asking me out, won’t I?”
Instead of answering, Draco transfigured his knife into another fork and handed it to her. They shared the cake in amicable silence, and if there were tears in Draco’s eyes, neither acknowledged it.
“I mean, I know what you’re referring to and I could say... like cutting and grinding and stuff. I could even list you the odd property here and there but details? Not happening. I don’t even know what the difference between chopping, cutting and slicing is, just that the book uses all of them a lot.”
Harry eyes Malfoy for a moment longer, the braid had loosened during the warm up and a few hairs had escaped, framing his face beautifully. The last two years must have been good on him, because even Harry has to admit that Malfoy has grown into his former pointy face. Harry’s thoughts get interrupted by Chris asking him if he would like to partner with him.
They said their goodbyes shortly after and Draco slowly trotted to his dorm again, aware that Pansy was following him.
Together they step onto the mat, face each other and kneel. Harry reaches his hands forward and lets his forehead touch the mat. Had someone told him two years ago that he would willingly be bowing before Malfoy, he would have hexed them. But he was bowing and so was Malfoy. They straighten up again and Malfoy smirks.
“Listen. You… don’t have to do this. I know Pansy kinda forced you into this.” Draco shut him up with a raised eyebrow, hiding his nerves behind the haughty exterior of his mask.
Draco shrugged, he wasn’t too keen on that particular headline either. “I’m okay with keeping it secret for a while. I don’t necessarily want to go public either, although I do want to be able to tell my friends and my mother about it at some point.”
The moment he left, Draco felt his absence as if losing a sense, though the places where Potter touched him still felt warmer than the rest of his body.
Also a heads up in the starting notes: there is a short instance of masturbation in this chapter to which the beginning and end of it are marked with *~~~* instead of only the ~~~ I normally use. The scene is skippable should you feel uncomfortable. Other topics that might come up (referenced or explicitly stated) as always listed in the end notes.
Draco’s hand reached for his shot glass, unwilling to talk about the war. But then he whispered “taking the mark” anyway. He chased the answer down with his shot but continued to explain his answer. The veritaserum gave him the words he normally was too afraid to say. “It was the beginning of the end for me. I mean I was a prejudiced asshole even before that, but after that there was no going back.” Realizing the gloomy mood around him, he stopped himself from saying more, filled his glass again and downed it.
Draco’s thoughts toppled over themselves. He thought back to the fiasco of trying to go to dinner a few weeks ago; the noise of a filled Great Hall a faint echo in his mind, nearly drowned out by the sound of his racing heart. He broke out into a cold sweat, and was about to protest but Pansy went on. “We’ll go at the earliest time possible, yeah? You know how empty it is on Saturday mornings, everyone wants to sleep in. Hermione and I will be with you the whole time.”
Sighing deeply, Draco pulled his eyes away from his notes and gave Harry a quick kiss. They joined Pansy and Hermione at the common room entrance and together they left for the Great Hall.
“Uhm. No yeah. Sorry I was just shocked. Thanks for offering it actually, I know you don’t have to.” Potter said.
“I also need to apologise,” Harry said softly into Draco’s hair, “I ....didn’t know what the spell did... when I used it, which makes it all the worse. I can’t tell you how sorry I am for that.”
Draco took this as the dismissal it was, leapt towards the desk to grab his wand and then waited a moment to make sure Morris had actually left. He made his way towards the visitors floos as fast as he could while still nursing his throbbing stomach.
“I… Thank you.” offered Malfoy after a short while. His voice was open and honest for the first time that day and it felt like the first time Harry ever heard him sound truly nice without any anger or politeness mixing in. He couldn’t help the smile blooming on his face.
With his robes out of question there were only a few options left: his formal dress robes, his quidditch jumper and some sweatpants, or a jumper and one of the muggle jeans he had ordered while on house arrest. Granted, he had only done so because his mandatory muggle culture tutor had told him to, but now he actually quite liked them. His arse looked fantastic in the black skinny jeans, far better than in robes.
Draco couldn’t help himself. “Honestly Potter. Cutting leaves you with uniform, cubic  pieces the size of your thumbnail - at least if not it’s not specified. Chopping leaves you with smaller pieces that don’t have to be as uniformly sized. Slicing leaves you with thin and long stripes. Besides, slicing is done with little pressure and more movement while chopping is more about pressure than the sawing motion.”
Or so he thought. After lunch the pull had begun to make itself apparent again. It wasn't as painful as it sometimes got when Draco hadn’t been able to touch Potter for a while, but it was still sooner than Draco had expected. Normally he would be fine for 12 hours before the pull started back in, growing more insistent over the next few hours. After 18 hours he would get tired and cranky; 24 hours and he would be freezing, feeling as though all warmth had fled from him; and once he passed 28 hours the pull would grow strong enough that it physically ached — as if his heart was being pulled out of his chest and towards the place where it longed to be. Draco had never tried to resist the pull once it reached that point.
This chapter deals with slight references to disordered eating, insults/verbal threats and anxiety attacks/social anxiety.
By the time he came, memory Blaise had shifted into someone else. Someone with a slight stubble, long dark curls and bright green eyes.
That night when Harry slipped into bed, he felt Draco cuddling into his side almost immediately, and he in turn wrapped his arms around him. Harry looked forward to waking in his arms time and time again.
“Urgh. Fine. I’ll play. But you cast on me. No one else.” It had always been useless to go against Pansy when she wanted something. At least for him. With a small squeal Pansy dragged him to the quickly forming circle on the assumed dancefloor. Apart from the usual 8th year party group, there were only Ginny, Luna and one of the younger Ravenclaws present.
— so each practice fight — you have to bow to your partner as a sign of respect and sportsmanship. You will start on my commando
During Harry’s tirade Malfoy’s shoulders had dropped, his head had lifted in between only to now vehemently stare at his plate again.
“Never have I ever been in the papers. By name or with a picture.” Hannah said, smirking at Neville and nudging him to drink. Draco downed another shot, observing as the rest drank. He had expected Blaise to drink but his shot remained untouched. Without thinking he said,
When their lips met, Harry felt his brain short-circuit. Cold lips warmed within seconds, melting into each other. At some point Draco had pulled his hands out of his pockets, embracing Harry gently, while Harry’s own hand had wandered from cupping his cheek to resting on Draco’s chest. The kiss was sweet, sensual and absolutely breathtaking. Draco and Harry were both panting slightly once they pulled apart.
“Oh shush. None of them fault me for trying to sell out Potter or ratting any of them out, none of the eighth years blame you for the war either. We were all just kids, we still are. Start with us, a small study group with max five people, a small way to get some human connection other than me. I’m not asking you to face every person in Hogwarts. Trust me that I wouldn’t invite you if I thought you would suffer from it. Plus, I’ll be there the whole time.
“Potter!” Draco groaned, after reading over the others' essays so far, “You can’t add ground wartcaps into this potion! It would explode right into your face. The assignment was to counteract the foul smell of the potion, not to kill everyone in the vicinity.”
But Harry shook his head. “No I kind of do. I… I was hoping that… whatever we had on Monday might… you know. Lead to something. And I really don’t want my coming out getting tangled up in some relationship rumours.”
He didn’t deserve this, not after the past years of hatred and pain he caused for her. But Granger sounded genuine, no trace of mockery in her voice or in her features, she just stood in front of the portrait, waiting and watching him. Draco let the sentences replay in his mind twice before he found the strength to speak.
“Stop that. You know I don’t care. I only mentioned it so it wouldn’t come as too much of a surprise if it takes me a while to get them off my back again.”
, but at least he didn’t have to get up at the crack of dawn to get food, which is what he reminded himself of when the dreaded study meeting crept closer. He didn’t even need the study meeting. He had finished all of the assignments already, not being distracted by mundane things as meals or people tended to make for a lot of extra time, and therefore he would only sit there and watch other people study.
They sat in awkward silence for a few seconds before Harry burst out, “Can I kiss you now?” Instead of answering, Draco placed a finger under Harry’s jaw and turned his face, capturing his lips in a soft kiss.
“Oh that is actually easier than it reads. You see,” Draco began, sounding similar to Hermione. And as he explained, Harry finally understood how chopping may look the same as finely slicing it but the individual pieces were inconsistent in size, while slicing them made the pieces uniformly in size. Draco even explained when it was okay to chop and when uniformity really mattered. With each word Harry could understand how someone might find potions interesting after all.
There were a few whispers throughout the room  when the first students began leaving but to Draco’s surprise, none of them were really hateful. Curious maybe but not hateful. Terry Boot mumbled something that might have been insulting if Draco had heard it, which he didn’t. Nonetheless Draco was well aware of Boot disliking him. The Ravenclaw wasn’t exactly quiet about it.
They had reached the Great Hall and Draco continued onwards to the kitchens to get lunch, when Potter stopped and asked, “You coming?” clearly gesturing towards the Hall. And maybe it was the uneventful breakfast in the Hall that morning or the way Potter clearly expected him to join him for lunch. Or maybe it was just Pansy’s voice in the back of his mind, whispering, “Promise me to try”. Whatever the case, Draco squared his shoulders and nodded. He stepped through the huge wooden doors with Potter.
They kissed for what felt like forever before they felt frozen to the bone. Hand in hand they walked the remaining way to the cottage, past snow-covered trees and candle lit windows.
Draco had set up camp on the large table they normally used for the study group, and spread his books out. His hands shuffled with the parchments in front of him for the upteenth time only to stop halfway through. The attempt to steady his nerves with a deep breath and the resolution to keep his hands still was thwarted seconds later, when his hands subconsciously reached up to run through his hair. It had become rather long, falling to his shoulders and Draco wasn’t sure what to think about it yet. Even though it was easier to hide his face behind the blond strands, it didn’t feel like him. Still he let it be for the time being.
Harry had the decency to look unsettled. “He named me heir.” he repeated quietly, “I don’t know why, but the goblins confirmed it and all. It was quite the fuss when we found out but I’m guessing Sirius didn’t want it all to fall to one of his relatives and all that, what with Grimmauld being our Headquarters.”
Professor McGonagall stood up, smoothing out her robes. “Gemma, I am once again very grateful for your quick availability, please feel free to use the floo once you are done here.” She turned to Draco. “I am aware that this is cutting into your lunch so you are exempt from Transfiguration this afternoon. The house elves are expecting you for a late lunch after you are done here, so please don’t rush this.” She swept from the room, the door falling shut with a dull thud.
Half an hour later Harry was positively drained and Draco had happily reduced the topics he still needed to cover with Harry down to one page, most of which being practical. He informed Harry that they would start the actual brewing as soon as he found a place to do so.
That meant it was Harry’s turn and Draco could see him struggling to come up with anything to say. He leaned over and muttered a suggestion into his ear.
Draco rolled his eyes and imitated him, seeing most of the circle drink. He noticed Luna giggling and whispering into Ginny’s ear before clinking their shot glasses. That at least explained why Harry wasn’t with Weasley anymore, Draco reasoned. He nearly snapped his neck though when Luna said, “Oh Harry, it’s good to see you finally accepting yourself.”
And as Draco looked at Harry with a sparkle in his eyes and excitement spraying from every fibre of his being, Harry blurted out, “Merlin I wanna kiss you.”
He could see that Harry was trying to believe him, but the fact that he was still gnawing on his lower lip gave away that he didn’t quite manage it. Draco wanted to pull the lip from between Harry’s teeth and kiss it better. Presuming that that would take Harry’s mind off of the worries, he did just that.
’ Draco thought. Images of all the taunts, the threats and insults, the beatings flooded back to mind and Draco desperately fought to keep them down. It would only get worse if it came out that he had run to the Headmistress and
They walked in silence for a moment, turning the corner to the 4th floor. When they were just a few feet away from the entrance to their common room, Granger spoke yet again.
They ate in silence and Draco debated with himself on what to do next. Harry had looked tired enough before they had their talk and now he just seemed exhausted and barely keeping upright. Sure enough, not long after finishing a second scone, Draco felt the weight of Harry’s head on his shoulders.
Despite the obvious exhaustion, Harry didn’t fall asleep right away and Draco noticed. His bedmate kept shuffling closer before turning away again. Draco itched with the desire to pull him close. “Screw it” he muttered, turning towards Harry and throwing all caution to the wind — in a rather Gryffindor way no less —  Draco quietly asked, “Would you like to cuddle?” opening his arms into the semi-darkness. Harry didn’t answer but he did scoot closer and snuggled into his embrace. Within seconds Draco felt some of the tension ease from the man in his arms and it didn’t take long for either of them to fall asleep.
“I need to apologise to you,” Draco said in a low voice, hands shoved deep into his coat pockets. “I was a complete prick to you in school and my… political views… were more than just problematic. I’ve worked hard to change since then, but it doesn’t excuse what I did and believed in during our childhood, nor what I did during the war.
Eventually, the tears stopped falling and he was able to breathe again.  With great hesitation, Draco looked to Potter, finding him with his nose in the potions book Draco had brought. Potter’s eyes quickly flickered from the book to him and back again.
The urge to apologize was strong, but Draco had promised to not pity Potter and so he didn’t. Instead he thought back to the admission Potter had made during the game.
David interrupted their tender moment with a malicious grin. “Everything alright here? Can I bring you anything else?”
Somewhere in between difficult conversations, laughter, and Potions essays he had gone and fallen for the bespeckled git. And just like that it felt wrong to hold him so close while he couldn’t object. What if he didn’t want Draco to touch him?
“Fucking finally. I don’t know how anyone enjoys this.” She leaned back in her chair and let her head fall back, closing her eyes and letting out a deep breath.
While Draco monologued, Potter’s quill dutifully scratched away onto his parchment. But as Draco paused for a second, Potter interrupted, “Any oil? It seems strange that there is enough of a distinction to separate water and distilled water but not enough to differentiate between the different types of oil.”
“Once?” he chuckled dryly. “I bullied people, for YEARS. I joined a fucking hate cult.” All of his wrongdoings flashed through his mind, his heart clenching at the reminders. He looked back up again, straight into Potter’s face, “I nearly cursed you, I let Death Eaters into the school, I almost killed Dumbledore.” His voice dropped into a harsh whisper, “I tortured, and stood by doing NOTHING while others were killed. So tell me Potter, how was that just once?” Draco sneers at him. His chest rose and fell in quick succession, adrenaline pumping through him.
The guilt inside of Draco rose and rose, nearly taking over his brain. He didn’t notice his fingernails digging into his palms or his body rocking back and forth on the hard wooden stool. He could just make out Morris’ voice, over the ringing in his ears, reminding him of his failures and crimes for the umpteenth time.
he thought and pushed the heavy doors of the Great Hall open to join Pansy at the eighth year table. Hermione shot him a surprised smile when he sat down and then continued her conversation with Potter. It was strange to see the two of them sitting in the Hall without Weasley, but the ginger had opted out of repeating his last year of school in order to help his brother at the joke shop. At least that’s what Pansy had said a few weeks back in one of her gossip rants.
Draco and Pansy were on their way to Muggle Studies. Transfiguration had just ended and Harry and Hermione had decided to hit the library before lunch. While Hermione and Pansy had been busy kissing goodbye, Harry had leaned over to Draco and whispered, “You should tell her today. She will be pissed enough that you told Hermione before you told her.”
“I just wanted you two to stop avoiding each other. ‘Mione said he’s hiding in his dorm half the time too.”
Pansy cast a tempus and shrugged, “Oh in about 10 minutes?” she said innocently while fluttering her lashes. She got up and turned to leave his dorm. Draco, who had just taken another bite, promptly coughed. When he recovered, Pansy was already gone.
He walked Malfoy through several meditation techniques that night, not once asking about the memories again. They planned another meeting for Friday evening and parted ways.
Draco’s jaw nearly hit the floor before he quickly composed himself, “You… You’d want us to…” He broke off, unable to say the words.
Draco shook his head, “No, just… thinking. I’m ready.” He leaned over to press a soft kiss to Harry’s cheek and then whispered, “After you Professor Potter-Malfoy.”
Giving a slight bow, she presented the plate to Draco, whose heart nearly melted at the sight of all his favourites on it. He had been miffed that he would miss the feast, prepared to just stick with some form of sandwich for the evening as always, but he had underestimated his best friend. On the platter were mashed potatoes, some slices of the roast, gravy, a serving of pumpkin bake and even some vegetables with garlic butter, all of them still steaming slightly.
With a sigh Draco fell back onto his mattress, it was only Pansy. No need to overreact. Still a bit shaky, he called to her, allowing her in. Pansy entered with the biggest grin on her face and a huge plate in her hands.
They languidly kissed for a few moments before Harry waved his hand to clean them both of their mess and lay down next to Draco, pulling him close to his chest.
“Luckily ignorance can be fought with knowledge. But enough with the deep topics, I promised to show you the kitchens so we should get going.”
Draco felt his skin heat with anger and still he felt the freezing cold creep into his bones again, he was already missing the others touch. He glanced at Harry and saw him close his eyes and take a deep breath.
Pansy saw Draco and leaped out of her chair, “Draco, could I ta–” she stopped herself, concern growing visibly, “Are you alright?”
“I should be going,” McGonagall said but stopped just inside the doorway again, “The offer stands, Mr. Malfoy. Feel free to come by my office whenever you need something. Other than that I look forward to seeing you at mealtimes in the Great Hall again at some point. Have a wonderful afternoon.”
Discussing his translation with Hermione was actually a good idea, and if Draco was honest he had missed studying with her too. “Sure” he allowed. Together they hurried up into the castle.
“Oh yeah. They talked it out over the weekend apparently. Good thing they did, Blaise was getting on my nerves with all the groveling.” Pansy mentioned and then continued reading the Prophet.
Draco had felt the same way in the beginning, but he had found another motivation for studying the runes. Without really thinking about it, he started talking, “Yeah, but once you’ve got the hang of the runes you can start incorporating the runes into your everyday life or different fields of magic. There’s a reason why every wandmaker and alchemist has a deep understanding of ancient and contemporary runes. They still hold power and can be especially useful in magical fields with a focus on creation.”
Nearly everyone drank to that except surprisingly Seamus Finnegan , who Draco had always pinned as a very sexually driven being. When Hermione noticed Draco wrinkling an eyebrow at the fact, she leaned over Pansy to whisper into his ear, “He and Dean have been together since third year. I don’t think he ever really noticed anyone but him.”
“It’s your dare and I am perfectly comfortable here.” Blaise teased and Draco recognised the playful tone.
Mentally preparing, Draco gave permission and held his breath for the expected touch of Potter’s fingers. The touch, when it came a few seconds later, was hesitant and warm, the fingers gently tracing the lines of the faintly raised scars on Draco’s chest and abdomen. Draco focussed intently on the fraying leather of the couch just next to his left knee. His concentration broke when the fingers stilled on the worst of the scars, the one that had cut the deepest, just below his right collarbone.
Is this the first sign of The-Boy-Who-Lived turning his back on the Wizarding World? Or is there another reason for our Saviour being lured back to the muggle world?
Draco didn’t hear what Blaise said to garner the attention before he turned towards Harry and cast a silencing charm around the two of them.
The constant beat of his own heart in his ears didn’t dull the whole way to the Hall, and when Draco reached the heavy wooden doors it was still beating at a steady, albeit fast pace. With a last fortifying breath Draco accepted his doom and pushed the doors open.
Draco let the shirt fall to the floor as his eyes raked over the beautiful body before him. Neither man moved for a moment, before Draco simply pushed Harry on top of the messy sheets. Draco quickly grabbed his own shirt and pulled it off, dropping it to the ground, before crawling up on the bed and straddling Harry. Even through their jeans he could feel Harry's erection as he ground down into it.
“We could meet after dinner if you’d like?” he offered instead, thinking about Harry saying that they could ‘lead to something’ and desperately wanting to see where it would lead them.
Draco propped his elbows on the counter and looked at the small boy. He was probably around 7 or 8 years old and didn’t look like Potter at all. The skin was far too light and the blue hair only had slight waves in them.
Smiling and thanking him for his understanding, Harry placed his feet back on the ground. Draco moved to do the same.
when I got stuck there. The combination of the discomfort rune while in a passive sentence, negated and used for a third party, actually represents the act of comforting said third party and therefore relieving the said party of said discomfort. I don’t have the book with me, but it is in the library if you want to look it up too.” Surprisingly she just thanked him and went back to her translation. He closed his eyes for a moment, took a deep breath and went back to his research, only to find a piece of parchment on it.
Draco tried it thrice more that evening, only producing some sparkles once more but after the third try he was exhausted. They settled on another meeting for Friday and before Harry could leave Draco grabbed his arm, stopping his retreat, “Thank you Po- Harry.” he said in earnest. Harry smiled at the use of his given name.
So it was of course at this point when Potter found him on the stairs, his body slumped against the banister, knees pulled to his chest.  Draco had stopped crying, simply too exhausted to continue, his eyes still puffy and red rimmed. Draco himself was only half conscious, the bond having robbed him of all of his energy, the pain the only thing keeping him awake.
They stepped into the halls. The little speech had lasted long enough that most students were in their afternoon classes or had retreated someplace else. Draco was thankful that McGonagall didn’t comment on the tears still falling from his eyes but instead walked in silence with him.
“Isn’t that the point my dear?” Narcissa asked gently, cupping his face. “You don’t need Lucius’ approval, nor do you need mine. Be the man you want to be, do what makes you happy. That’s all you need.”
Draco woke to sunlight rather than his blaring alarm meaning only one thing: It was Sunday. Content he pulled the sleeping form in his arms closer and closed his eyes again.
Draco closes his fingers around his neck again and within seconds Harry is close to the edge again, moaning hoarsely and angling his hips to let Draco deeper into him. Just before Harry can tip over though, Draco stops his thrusts and releases the choke — and while the release of the choke itself feels orgasmic, Harry refrains from coming.
In an effort to meet as few people as possible, Draco had apparated to London with almost half an hour to spare, but when he stepped onto the Platform it was already quarter to eleven.
When Thursday rolled around, Draco was a mental mess again. The few days of eating full meals had done wonders for his concentration, although that could have also been due to him getting more sleep. He didn’t necessarily sleep
After Blaise, or the fact that you never shut up about a certain speckled git. You literally talked about nothing but Potter for years, so Yes Draco, I'm very aware your gay and glad you finally realized it yourself.
Had Granger really just invited him? Draco Malfoy, ex-Death Eater? He could only nod , study meetings… people... He probably wouldn’t show, but it was nice of her anyway.
After he had been scribbling away on the same line for nearly 10 minutes he gave up. He could just as well start another essay, despite it being potions theory. So he finished his defense essay and belatedly realized that his potions book was still in his trunk. Well at least he could put on the kettle while getting the book.
“Not only that, but you helped me. You saved my life and later you helped us fight in the battle. And don’t even pretend it wasn’t you who paid and organized all those private healers for Katie. She told me.” Potter said quite sternly. Silence stretched between them.
“Congratulations. You neither poisoned me nor made enough mistakes to even influence the taste of it.” remarked Draco, smiling widely at Harry, who looked relieved and then smacked him on the arm.
Draco’s fingernails dug painfully into his thighs to stop him from cowering at the volume, and with a tremble in his voice he answered, “I don’t have one, Sir. I only have that one. Hawthorn with unicorn hair, 11 inches, it should be noted in my file that I only have that one.”
Despite the question, Hermione sounded sure of herself. It was only logical. Draco only ever left the common room for class, and nowadays meals, but for both of those he was accompanied by someone from their study group. There was the rare occasion that he would talk to McGonagall but then he still wouldn’t come back bruised. That left only one option open: his parole meetings.
Dragging his eyes away from their newest obsession he looked into Harry’s eyes, finding uncertainty and nervousness.
“Never have I ever had a threesome.” Pansy challenged and was disappointed when only Blaise, Neville and Hannah drank.
