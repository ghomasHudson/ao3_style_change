Right. He needs my core. Focus, Draco! I exhale, envisioning my magic, Potter's magic, the magic in the house. I don't know how to do this, exactly, but I try to imagine offering it to him. I feel a shift in Potter's magic next to me, then a pulling—almost the feeling of a Portkey hooking behind your navel, except less like a hook and more like suction. I try to keep calm through breathing, and, without thinking, I lean until my shoulder touches Potter. This is our only hope.
. "No! It's not going to work, James! I am your uncle, and I say it's time to bring your poor father to bed." James wolf-whistled, which was disturbing because Harry was his
This isn't something you can just like, try on for fun."
When the spinning stopped, Harry coughed and shouted, "Oi, Draco!"
Not even the energy-sapping fog of depression could steal the happiness of being alive from Harry these past months, and
Harry smacks Draco's arm. "I can't believe that when we had sex the first time, you said, 'Thanks for the fuck, Potter' afterward."
“Huh,” Draco said speculatively after a stretch of silence. “Turns out flamingoes are boring. More boring still than peacocks, and I thought they were dull.”
Harry snorted. "Yeah, going on reality telly definitely sounds like something I would do." His phone buzzed and he glanced at it. Text from James: "Dad, are you fucking kidding me? This is the 'planned leak' you warned me was coming? Are you out of your mind? Is this just what happens when you date someone in politics? What the actual fuck! Are you ok? You usually hate this kind of attention."
Harry laughed. “Hufflepuff?”
Harry grimaces at Hermione, wondering what the fuck Draco wants to say to his dead parents and assorted other parent figures, but Hermione just laughs.
Potter frowns. "What? The fuck? No. A fucking chain. A literal chain. Do you think he gave magic the form of a chain? I had just assumed there was like, a magic chain chilling there."
"Er, no. Not quite. I just—afterward, I just feel a bit numb. Like, what does it matter if I can come up with these imaginings, if they're not going to happen? I just feel. Blah."
mercilessly, so it’s built into the very fabric of your relationship.”
Harry pulls away. "Like what?"
Albus waved his wand to silence the music, but Teddy, James,
Harry leaned forward. “What about my room?!”

With Draco, there was none of that. There was only bickering and talking about their lives, and it felt normal, somehow.

"That's…disturbing."
“Ew,” Draco whispered. “It is hot in here.”
to do anything, he's just...doing. Maybe it's the alcohol, but he's nothing but a bundle of sensations. He's hot face and cold hands and sweaty shirt, he's hands on bony shoulders, he's stubble on chin, he's the deep pull of heat in his gut, he's the feeling of shirt peeling off damp skin, he's the sound of it hitting the floor, he's the
Harry let his eyes slide towards Draco, and once he’d made eye contact, he looked back at James.
“Alright,” she said. “Well, at least we know I was right to pair you for this. Let’s try to work through some of these. Let’s try to identify what type of unhelpful thinking you’re engaging in.”
We manage, somehow, to focus on the task. I spell a slim neck onto the creature and turn the fur on the top of its head black. I give it green eyes and shrink its teeth. I change the shape of its skull, removing the snout, and turn the nose into a more-or-less human organ. I glance at Potter to gauge skin tone. Turns out rat skin is pink-white under the fur, so I have to darken it considerably. It comes out looking a bit like a rat went overboard with a Suntan Solution, but this whole endeavor is never going to hold up under close scrutiny, anyway.
Last note: I am an American and more familiar with US politics than UK politics. However, there is canonically very little information about the political system in the Harry Potter universe (it's not even clear how/whether the Minister of Magic is elected, or who passes laws [i.e. is the Wizengamot a combined judiciary/legislature?]), so I am taking that lack of canon information as carte blanche to make up whatever I want. It will probably look closer to a US system, but please for the love of god do not try to britsplain politics to me. It's fairly likely from the books that the magical political system does not have a straightforward UK-type parliament, anyway.
! Can you believe it?”
“Does this answer your question?” Draco asked.
Somehow, Harry had almost forgotten they'd done
I flinch. As much as death seems likely, it's not as if I
"Oh, good shout, Harry—it's potty mouth." She looks up. "Yes, but
That's probably not a healthy way to think about it.
The next morning, the flat is spotless—like the party never happened. This makes sense, because Hermione is a skillful witch and probably cleaned the entire flat with one wave of her wand, but it makes Harry feel like he's losing his mind a bit. His mind is still stuck in the corridor with Ginny and Seamus and a song called "Brick."
"I'm fine," he says. "Fuck. It felt like I almost had it. I want my fucking wand!"
Harry tries to figure out how to put it into words. "He makes other people look wishy-washy."
do that if they were pretentious wankers, which they weren't, but Harry appreciated the company, cigars or no cigars.
Harry grabbed the lime fizz and, turning and letting his hand stay on Draco's back for a second too long, carried it back to Hermione. That was good, right? He thought he'd done okay. "Here you go, Mi."
a Death Eater. And he really did only tip two Sickles."
"See, that's the thing, though," Harry said, and Draco could
Draco's office was in the building next to Gringotts, and usually he loved the location, being surrounded by the happy hubbub of Diagon Alley: peddlers of magic, children entranced by charms, wix in colourful robes striding into the bank to conduct financial transactions. It reminded Draco of his childhood, of the way he had once thought adult life would be.
"What for?" Harry knew that James was capable of producing a perfectly functional Disillusionment, because he'd used it to try to trick Harry on multiple occasions. The cloak, meanwhile, lived in a locked cabinet.
"Could you get some food together for Scorpius and Albus's dinner? And pack it up for them to take home?"
"And if you're not fully comprehending the
"Hello," Draco said with some bewilderment.
He went to class, and sat in the common room smiling at Seamus and Neville's reenactment of a mishap from the greenhouse, and ate some food, and let Ginny experiment with hair charms on him. But he felt numb—more numb than he had in awhile, and the feeling of going backwards on the fucked-up scale was worse than being fucked-up in the first place.
They fell into a routine of sorts—Draco waking in a sea of profanity, Harry blinking awake and watching as Draco dragged himself out of bed, into his dressing gown, and downstairs. They all went to work—Harry worked the longest hours, and Draco usually brought work home with him. James, on the other hand, in his job as sport rehab therapist at St Mungo’s, had a very consistent nine-to-five schedule.
"Can you come over here?"
Every time he thought about it, he groaned and squirmed. So he kept trying not to think about it.
"So that's all," Draco pauses, choosing his words, and waving a hand, "settled?"
"You know what really gets my goat?" Draco continued, gesturing wildly. "The idea that the spells taught at Hogwarts are somehow not 'foreign.' Last I checked, Latin originated in what is now Italy. Nearly every spell taught there is 'foreign.' I don't see them teaching spells using Old English incantations. When they want to levitate an object, I don't see them saying
Draco raised an eyebrow. “You think Robards would put
Does she think—does Madam
and the
The song changes to something with a dance beat and lyrics saying, "Move to the groove, move to the groove, dance!" Harry hops into the circle of people who have stopped congaing and grabs Hermione's hand. It's too loud to say anything; she catches Malfoy's eye and sends him a drunk, sceptical eye, but continues to dance.
Draco glared harder.
For a long moment, I think Potter is going to try to be all noble and refuse me. But after a bit, he gets a look of determination on his face and nods. "Okay. You tell me if you need me to stop, okay?"
Draco is farthest from the Floo and, not having seen the new arrival, shouts, "If you wanna party let me hear you yell!"
Draco shrugs and sits on Harry's bed. "I think only Weasley and Finnigan." Harry sits next to him and flops onto his back. "Are you going to tell me what triggered it? Was it just seeing Weasley? You knew she'd be here, right?"
I roll my eyes and pick up one of the metal strips. My fingers tingle from the magic. I hold it like a wand and swish it through the air, attempting to cast a Lumos.
Harry almost laughs.
Draco turned, and their faces, bent over the butterflies, were very close. “Not everything that’s wonderful is magic, Potter.”
He's sitting there, having done what he came to do—talk to Ginny about the abortion and their split, figure out where he fits in this family—but he realises with sudden clarity that he has to tell her.
Harry burst out laughing. Thank Merlin Ron was in this with him. "Nice hair."
"The water doesn't get hot enough in the third floor bath unless you use a Charm. There's a thriving magical aquarium inside one of the toilet tanks—Scorpius Charmed that when he was younger and couldn't bear to get rid of it. Supper is at seven unless I'm stuck at work, in which case I always let Lorraine know." He paused, halfway up the stairs. "And you. I'll always let Lorraine and you know."
"We still see them for dinner at least once a week," Draco said.
No sooner had Draco shaken their hands than the two of them were gathering their things and muttering excitedly to each other. "We'll need to check the poll numbers—the data from the Smithwick elopement—the effect on the queer movement—voter mobilisation—"
"Oh for the love of…" Draco sighed. "You're impossible. My point is merely that the intentions that got us here don't change the fact that this is our family now."
Harry looked up. "What?"
"What can I get you?" she asked. Behind her, three giant coffee pots gurgled merrily, and an espresso machine shot steam out at odd intervals. Another barista gathered drinks (that were prepared magically) and sent them Levitating to waiting customers. A sign on the wall read, "NEW! Try the
"Harry," Draco says, grinning, eyes closed as Harry walks him backward into the bedroom. "I keep wanting to ask you something. When you saw me that night in the club, and we started snogging on the dancefloor with that Muggle girl, what did you think about me? I still can't believe we hooked up at a club."
Potter doesn't say anything, so I'm left to ruminate, which is always dangerous with me. I should never be left to ruminate.
and you should fact-check yourself before you try it. If we adopted a Kneazle and got divorced after I left office, we would certainly need to arrange custody of the feline."
life, about
"I'm sorry I sliced you open last year."
"It's about firearms."
He rolls his eyes. "You don't need to placate me."
"I thought you were going to do Legilimency!" Harry hissed.
"Oh for the love of…" Draco murmured. "Alright, so when I say we 'hooked up at a Ministry function', what I mean is that we left and fucked at one of our homes, in a bed, with no one else in the house. Is that better?"
justifies my means."
James nodded. "So what's my next step?"
, she and all of his baggage disappeared.
But when he's with Draco, he always ends up forgetting any resolutions to be circumspect. Because he doesn't really think about the things he does with Draco; he just
“She might have.” James reached for a muffin from a basket Lorraine had just added to the spread. “How could she think I want to food shame her, though?! When I first met her, we once had a marshmallow-eating contest. I am one hundred percent pro-eating.”
"But…?" Harry prodded.
Harry would never get over the fact that Draco's unionised house-elf was named
Malfoy looks up, his hair flopping in his eye. "We said we wouldn't have done it if we knew we'd be in class together. Isn't that discussing it?"
Albus nodded, smile matching Harry's. "We thought you'd want to know."
Harry finds his wand and crouches down to retrieve it, casting to clean his hand, then his body, then Malfoy's.
They walked out the door and down the front steps of the castle, heading towards the Great Lake.
"Like whom?"
"You've made
James grinned at the elf and Disapparated; Lorraine followed. Loud bangs sounded from the fifth floor.
"I really, really do. And I'm on Veritaserum, so you know I'm not lying. Merlin, Draco, I—"
Draco looked up. He'd been avoiding eye contact with their interrogators, but now his eyes found Hermione's, then Scorpius's. "You remember what it was like. You remember how we felt. The hopelessness, the disbelief. And I just—when the world is that shitty and feels that helpless, you want to do whatever you can to fix it. And maybe that's arrogant, or selfish even, but it's also the source of good change and improvement and social action!" He stopped, shook his head. "Sorry. I'm not trying to sound like a politician right now, but sometimes it just comes out. Anyway. So I talked to Hermione about what to do next. What could LabMag do? How could we possibly deal with this, this fascist
"Why hello, little one!" Harry's voice was always impossibly warm whilst cooing at babies. "Welcome back to the land of the waking!"
"Scorpius?" Draco said, his voice becoming drawlier in a manner that Harry now knew revealed anxiety—something in Draco's subconscious apparently thought the pedigree might help any anxiety-inducing situation. To be fair, that was true most times—blast this unfair world.
"True," Harry said. "It's just—I've
Draco blinked, his eyes taking on a calculating expression. "Trainings for the MLEOs and Aurors. We come up with some example of a case where they
“You do things, you make choices about your behaviour—so let’s try to think about choices that will push you towards health, rather than further away, yeah?”
Harry jogged down the stairs, through the sitting room, and onto the back patio. It was a gorgeous garden. Fairly small, given they were in the middle of London, but Harry suspected that it benefited from an Undetectable Extension. The walls surrounding the garden were covered with a thick layer of hedges and vines, and Draco sat at a table reading the
“He’s such a prick,” Harry said. “Calling me names, like we’re back on the schoolyard."
"Did you hear Greg was accepted to that baking programme?"
Harry turned away from the empty pitch. The morning sun glinted off Malfoy's hair. At close range, Harry could see a freckle near his left ear and that his hair got slightly darker at the roots, not like it was coloured, but like it had changed colour with time or sun exposure.
you! I
Another knock at the door. "Come in!"
"What about the press?" Albus asked. "You said you were going to keep us out of the press—what press?"
"So you want to make a plan?" Harry asked, leaning forward. "Is this what Slytherins do, secret plots? If it was up to me and Ron and Hermione, we'd probably just walk into the Ministry and start making out, plans be damned."
"Yes."
Hermione covers her face with her hand and flops next to Harry. "Oh, Haz, I'm so sorry. I should've told you about her. It's so awkward, having Muggle family—because it's hard to visit them and you can't tell them about your life or anything, and now that my parents aren't around, I can't just visit my relatives with them like I used to, and I honestly didn't know if I'd ever see any of them again."
we haven't been honest. Because the entire 'relationship' isn't honest." He made quotes in the air with his fingers, trying to emphasise the extent of the farce.
the law, as an example for the rest. So tell me, what are you wearing?"
"I paid the bill with Gringotts draft."
Draco laughed, unfastening Harry's trousers. "You're so easy."
," Lily snapped, her eyes teary. "How many times have you told me never to pretend? Never to pretend I felt something I didn't feel? Never to say I liked something I didn't like? Do you remember the time Honoria Nott told me I couldn't go to her party if I didn't join their secret society, and I didn't want to join but I wanted to go to the party, and you told me that I should be proud to be uninvited if it meant that I was being authentic? Because that's the most important thing?"
be real? It was like all the things my parents told me when I came out to them had come true."
Harry laughs. He can feel that his eyes are still red from crying before. But he's got Hermione. Hermione will let him be sad. Hermione will be sad with him. And they have Leo and Claire Danes.
Harry's feet slide sideways, out from under him, and he lands with a crash on his front, his hands just catching him.
Harry frowns. "What? Not at all. Our flat is fantastic."
Hermione’s finger flew into the air. “Don’t you dare try to make excuses for them, Harry Potter.” Fuck. “If that’s what it was about, why did they go out of the way to make this a gendered policy? Why didn’t they just say ‘no running shorts,’ hmmm?”
"Come in!"
Draco leveled him with a raised eyebrow. "Who do you think is less likely to be hired if an employee's Dark Arts can put the company on the line?"
"How could you think we would've
Malfoy turns to look at him fully with a scathing glare. "No, Potter, I didn't take N.E.W.T.s in the middle of a war in between sessions of torturing and being tortured."
"You know I agree that we—"
"Oh yeah?" Bill asked, then he winced. "How badly did he seem to hate me for leaving him alone?"
"That wasn't the baby," Harry whispers. "For me, it wasn't the baby. We never really clicked again, after the war. For me, anyway."
"We've thrown ourselves to the dragons," Draco said. "It strikes me as a bit terrifying, not
Veritaserum.
Harry laughed, which made it harder to hold the plank. “Don’t make me laugh, you knob.”
Hermione gasped loudly, then grinned, looking pleased with herself for making fun of Harry.
Draco snorted. “Not hardly a yogi. But I feel better if I do stretches before bed.” As if to emphasise his point, his sternum cracked as he raised his arms over his head and back. “Are
"Ugh, don't say it."
Harry found he was glad Draco was there. It wasn't that Rump intimidated him, exactly—Harry had faced much greater threats than this buffoon—but that his toxicity made it difficult to function. Harry, though, could feel Draco's presence behind him, and refused to cower before the pacing, red-faced fascist.
Hence, our general sameishness with regard to the current situation is disconcerting, to say the least.
Harry shoves his way inside, dropping his bag next to the door and pushing Draco against the wall, kissing his neck, capturing Draco's lips—yes, perfect, Draco always distracts him—
"Oh no," Harry whispered.
Harry nodded. "Ah yes. I'm a cheap date. All it takes to get me in bed is to almost kill each other, survive a war together, work together over decades, have children who fall in love and get married, get married for political reasons, pretend to be in love for two years to all friends and relatives, become grandparents together, and take a controlled substance to open up enough to tell each other the truth. That's all."
Harry changed direction, heading towards the stairs. Where the fuck were his jeans?
Harry's not sure how he should feel. He maybe just sent a message to his parents. Or maybe not. Hermione'd told him it was simply the act of putting the words down on paper that was meaningful, and she's probably right. But Harry, looking at Hermione's and Draco's faces in the shadow of the blue flames, thinks this is nice too.
We frown at the loot. "I feel like we're on a really boring game show," Potter says.
reality."
? Not really? It's more like, a thing to do. He can't sit around. So here he is.
“Yeah. I don’t know how good any of it is.”
“Eleven.”
"It's hard, with all this, to know what one wants," Malfoy said. "Isn't it?"
Draco opened his mouth to speak, then closed it again. "I don't even know what to say."
He made his way through the Floo, up the lifts, and into the Auror offices before his day went south.
"What?" Draco said, looking up, surprised. His hand shook as he pushed his hair away from his face. "No, I—I like my work. I'm good at it. It's fulfilling. It's not like how you were with your job. I don't—I don't hate it at all."
"No!" Harry laughs. "I noticed your flat was kind of bare. And you said that you felt like you didn't belong here, but you
Scorpius's eyes dropped to the place on Draco's hip where Harry had just put his hand. "You two alright?"
"I did," Draco said happily. "We may have to help put him back together again, but not until after he realises he absolutely does not want to go to law school."
"That's weird as fuck," Harry said, leaning back on the wall, his heart in his throat.
"You can leave us, Grusta," Malfoy said with an easy authority that Harry wished he was able to emulate when talking with subordinates at work.
“Official?”
Draco sat next to him with his own, much smaller, ice cream.
“Harry, what are they talking about?” Ron looked exhausted.
"You can?" Draco reached out, surprised to see his hand trembling as he placed it against Harry's cheek.
Draco hoped Lorraine was paying attention, because the vomit contingency was still in play. When he looked up, he knew his face looked as broken as he felt. He ran his hand through his hair, trying to settle his nerves and stomach.
"Potter."
Harry pulled out his phone, fumbling it as he held the baby.
Draco frowned. "There's so much there to address." He sighed. "Okay first, when you say you will 'attend to business on your own,' are you talking about masturbating—exclusively—for the remainder of our pretend relationship? Or are you saying that you can handle the logistics of having sex with someone else without involving me? Because if it's the former, you're more of a martyr than even I had thought, and if it's the latter, absolutely not. We need to plan this together."
"Not of which I'm aware," I say, annoyed that somehow he thinks this hinges on me. If anyone is going to magically get us out of this hell, it's obviously going to be him. Harry fucking Potter, after all.
"I—I don't want—you should have one part of your life where you don't feel that way, and I—I asked you to get married to save the world. I asked
Without overthinking it, Harry reached for Draco's hand, twining their fingers together.
Teddy leaned back in his chair, the front legs rising off the floor, and gave James a shit-eating grin. "Who is she?"
"I'm not mad at Dumbledore." Harry sighed, rolling his eyes. "Don't get upset on my behalf over things that are water under the bridge. You're forgetting that I
"So what happened?"
“Oh Merlin,” Draco said, his arms already shuddering with exertion. “We could take him, Harry. Whomever this sixty-year-old meathead is.”
“Are those the only comfortable places you can think of?”
“Additionally,” Pomfrey says, and how can there be more? “Orgasms stimulate the vagus nerve, which is also useful in calming intractable hiccoughs. My professional recommendation, therefore, is for digital rectal massage culminating in orgasm.”
No one could argue with that. The Wizengamot was notoriously glacial (unless they were launching a full inquiry against a fifteen-year-old, but Harry tried not to harp on that too much lest he be accused of holding a grudge).
Harry laughed, feeling like a knob. "No! Draco, please help me up. I would love your help."
"How's it coming?" Harry asked Draco. Then he turned to Aster and said, "Yes!" He booped her nose. "Let's ask Poppop how it's coming!"
Draco shut the door with a wave of his wand. "Did you hear about the baby?"
Harry laughed. “No. I dunno what he had to say. He’s trying to figure his shit out just like we are.”
Lorraine’s eyes grew even wider, and she looked between the two of them seriously. She snapped her fingers, enacting elves-only-knew what magic upstairs. “Consider it being done! Master Harry’s room will be looking like a perfectly tidy guest room.”
If Harry's going to have no family, at least he has no family with Hermione. "Let's go out and get drunk?"
"So?!" Harry's tapping on the table picked up pace. "Last I checked, it wasn't a problem to have emotions for your spouse."
Harry pushes himself up on an elbow and looks down at Draco. "I think I've finally figured you out, Malfoy. Whenever you feel wrong-footed or awkward, you fall back on saying really dismissive and arrogant shite."
"She elected to be moved to recovery."
That said, Harry and every sane person wanted to remain a part of the ICW. It was necessary. The magical people of the world needed to have accountability, communication—needed to feel that they had common cause. If Britain left…
He'd been the object of much press and celebrity gossip since he and Draco had revealed their 'relationship,' so it wasn't unusual for Harry to draw snaps of cameras or shouts from reporters.
"I don't think besmitten is a word."
"No, Dad. Actually, I am not very interested in your
he did was new. Almost every day, unavoidably, he was a new person, being asked to do new things, having new experiences. Now, though, his life's momentum was a comfortable, deep rut, stretching out before him in sameness. Doing new things, making hard choices, required dragging himself out of a deep trench.
Harry looks
Work was quiet. Everyone nodded at him with facial expressions somewhere between what you'd expect when seeing someone whose loved one just died and what you'd expect from someone worried they were about to be wrongfully committed to the Janis Thickey Ward.
“I am non-attached!”
"Draco was a prat as a teenager, but most of his actions in the war were under coercion from Voldemort." Harry met Lee's eye. "In a way, I think I have more respect for Draco living through that than I do for many people who claim to have been anti-Voldemort, but who didn't do anything during the war."
"The real problem," Draco said, using his knife and fork to cut his quiche, "is that you have never been able to disguise your face."
"I'm not helping clean up," Hermione says, giving them a little salute and grinning as she walks into her bedroom. "Call me when dinner's ready!"
Harry laughed, somewhat discombobulated by Draco calling him
to everyone, and to each other.
“Sorry about this.” Harry waved his hand; the drawers and doors closed with a synchronised
Harry sighed, adjusting his position on the sofa. "I certainly don't want to! But my position as head of DMLE is a bit strange, because
Lily leaned back in her chair and gaped at him. "Erm, excuse me. Are you alright, there? Can we
Harry laughed, reaching over to twine his fingers with Draco's. "I can't believe you actually wore that." Draco was wearing a pair of Ron's jeans and an old t-shirt of Harry's, with shoes Transfigured into Converse.
"Oh dear," Hermione said, crossing her arms over her chest. "We'd better form a queue."
“A splendid idea,” Draco agreed, standing. “I’m going to go show him around and see if he needs a Dreamless Sleep.”
Magical Menagerie—the magical creature zoo in Paris.”
She starts to laugh, but not like she thinks it's funny. She laughs like her entire life is unhinged, which, to be sure, it kind of is.
“My arse
“I worked up the nerve to ask you out!” Draco bursts.
"Potter!"
Neither Harry nor Draco answer.
“What about you? How was it between you and Mrs Potter?”
you don't want to piss me off?" Harry leaned back in his chair, and Draco found himself noticing how incredibly hot this man was.
“Er, what’s he playing?”
may not show their knees! Honestly! What about men! What about men’s knees, I ask you!”
Teddy's eyelids start to droop, and he blinks them back open, not wanting to fall asleep.
tangled. That's what family is, right? You're all tangled up and you choose to keep tangled."
“You’re damn right it is, Harry,” Hermione said, her face flushed with anger. “Let’s you and me take our trousers off and have the office vote on whose knees are more distracting. Because I bet it’s yours!”
Harry sighed. “Yeah, okay.”
She dismissed him with a wave of her hand. "I know, but like. What if I decide I want a baby and I have a hard time getting pregnant? You had James when you were, what, 24? You and Mum were like, so much more grown-up then than I feel now."
Draco reclined Aster, her head nuzzled in his right elbow, and raised the bottle to her mouth. Once she started suckling, he turned back to Harry. "Yes, you're right. Alright. I think I'm already doing that, but I'll double check."
"I think I might fail my Potions N.E.W.T.," Harry mused, crinkling his eyes against the sun.
He's right, though I'm surprised he knows that.
"Oh yeah?" Harry asks. "What else do you require?"
He flung out his wand, casting Cushioning Charms on the landing and all surrounding walls. And ceiling, for good measure.
Harry throws his hand up as if in exasperation, but he's actually touched. And he knows that Draco and Hermione know he's touched, too, though they won't call him on it.
Draco's mouth twitched in amusement. "Both, obviously."
Fucking hell.
Harry laughed as they passed a restaurant advertising brunch and mimosas. “Of course.”
Lee laughed. "Who usually wins?"
Lily shouted, "Now we dance!" and the speakers blared, "
"Harry!" Hermione says, all smiles, as she jumps up. "This is my Aunt Peggy. Aunt Peggy, this is my best friend, Harry."
They stand, transfixed by Aster, for a long while.
Harry nods and lets himself crumple forward onto Draco's shoulder. Draco's hands wrap around him in a hug, and Harry thinks incongruously of Hermione hugging him before the party. Two hugs in one day.
Harry nodded. "I feel lied to."
"Good!" he says. "I'd rather not see my face on Wormtail's creepy fucking corpse."
"What was what like?"
"Is that why you went so overboard talking to Nico about law school? It's hard to watch people make mistakes you once made?"
“I can’t believe
Hermione snorts, her hand flying up to cover her mouth. "Sorry, I'm just imagining year four Harry reacting to the statement 'Malfoy's funny'."
Harry huffed a laugh and shook his head.
"This way they'll lose interest faster," Harry said, wanting that to be true. "That's what she said, right?"
"I didn't do anything!" James cried from another room, in what seemed like a reflexive response, since he couldn't possibly know why Harry was calling.
He hears what Draco's saying—that they're not
scuttlebutt from the household items—they're nowhere near as gossipy as the Ministry supplies."
Draco turned toward him, catching his eye and raising an eyebrow slightly, out of Ron and Hermione's view. "This one is for Hermione."
It’s not a surprise that Harry is late. Harry is always late when he goes to Wheezes. He always ends up drinking Firewhiskey with George as they test new products. One time, years and years ago, Harry was so late that Draco grew worried they’d managed to explode themselves somehow, so he had Flooed there in a nervous tizzy only to find Harry and George, drunk, wearing pirate hats and prank-Flooing Ron.
I stare at the floor. I have no idea how to answer the question. It makes me wish I had Veritaserum, because then I'd know for sure what I thought, either way. As it is, I have no idea. It's all so muddled up. I still hate the Order's politics. I still think Dumbledore had lots of wrong ideas. I still think there's danger in mixing magical and Muggle societies.
“I know you don’t want to,” she said, giving him a kind smile. “But do you think you could force yourself to go outside for five minutes every day, even if you don’t want to? Maybe drink more water.”
"Very funny," Draco said. "And no, I donated that entire vault to Hogwarts once I realised the key wouldn't take no for an answer."
Harry tapped his finger lightly on the table. "Listen to the words you're saying! This makes no sense. I'm saying I like you. You're saying you wanted to be with me. And the conclusion you're coming to is divorce?! I thought you were supposed to be clever, logical."
One thing about being friends with a sentient clock was that he always thought the time was an appropriate topic of conversation.
"Nothing to it," Malfoy replies, tone dripping with smugness.
"I fancy all cheese," Harry replied, because
Draco sat back. "Something like that, who knows." He waved his hand dismissively, as if he hadn't just leered at Harry. "If we do that, the papers will write something, right? But their scrutiny wouldn't be
He adds a small vial of dittany, a button, and a Puking Pastille.
Harry leans back against the wall, trying to will the fuzziness in his vision to disappear.
Draco sighed in agreement, pinching his nose. "Yes. And Rump would find a way to make it seem like he was promoting you or something, to avoid public outcry."
It felt like being a kid, but like being a
There was dancing, and shouting, and screaming along to a Weird Sisters super-medley, and Teddy and James performing Bohemian Rhapsody, and Ron shouting every single lyric to Mr. Brightside. Harry never let go of Draco, because he needed the anchor of another person who understood the truth of what was happening here. As if Harry himself had a grasp on the truth of what was happening here.
"Enter, Potter, but take heed, of what awaits the sin of greed."
“Come have some breakfast,” Harry said, putting a hand on James’s shoulder, “and tell us what happened.”
And now, just a few months after he quit (slash was sacked), with a fascist in power, he was
—ugh, I don't know,
"You what?" Ginny scrambled to stand, a delighted grin stretching across her face.
months!? I wrote
"I don't really have any food," Harry says, interrupting Draco's analysis of the worthlessness of Runes translation without also teaching Runes implementation ("Because really, Potter, what good is understanding an old textbook if you can't cast a Rune yourself?").
“I fucking hate you all,” Harry hissed as he picked up his bag and headed for the Floo.
"Potter," Malfoy sighed. "You heard me recommend you eat eggs. At least make fun of me accurately. I would never be
Harry was not prepared for Draco to add him to a group text with Ron and Hermione the following week. If teenage Draco could see himself now! The surreal quality of the whole thing was tempered somewhat by Harry's eagerness to see Draco's reaction to the experience of Ron in a group text. Ron was the worst sort of group texter.
Pomfrey walks back in, her mouth pressed tight.
"And now?" Teddy asked. He looked much older than the other kids, like he sometimes did, despite being only six years older than James. The war had touched him more; maybe that was it.
"I can spell the sugar out of it, and transfigure the wheat into almond. It leaves it a bit…dry, but it's fine."
, it's like a rollercoaster up a mountain."
down!”
But Draco had scoffed, pushed Harry into the bathroom, and demanded that Harry pass him his jeans. So Harry had stripped to his pants and stuck his arm out to give Draco his jeans. A minute later, Draco had handed them back as cutoffs. Harry hesitated to even call them
“No questions,” she said, shooing with her hands to get them out of their seats. “Keep up with the other assignment in the meantime, and try to fill in some of the other columns this time.”
"One doesn't want that, no."
The music changed to Spice Girls, and everything was shouting lyrics and dancing again.
Draco grunts but squeezes Harry back. “For the record, this really isn’t how I find you most attractive. And neither is the flannel lumberwizard look, either.”
"Well, I think we would. Because we're both public figures, our sons are married, and we're thinking of the political implications, as much as I hate that. If it were real, I'd probably be annoyed at political concerns affecting our relationship."
Draco raised an eyebrow. "Do you
it. I nod. "Unless he has some other scheme to use me to torture my parents. One that requires me alive."
"Course," Harry said jovially. "Why wouldn't we be?"
After a minute, Harry turned around, trying to figure out how to go on with the rest of his day. He caught Wilhelm's eye and reached to put him back on his clock.
Harry blinked, unprepared for this to turn to questions about him. "With Draco?"
Hermione raised her eyebrows. “He acted towards you like he did at school?”
"Maybe."
Draco, unimpressed, stood in the doorway of Harry's room. "It will prove to the centre that we are reasonable and open to dialogue. We need those votes!"
"Like fuck, it's not important." Harry grins. "I say it's important."
"I guess."
Draco turned slowly to fix Harry with a glare. “Are you incapable of answering a question without snark?”
The Floo sounded from the vestibule and James's voice shouted, "DAD! I BOUGHT A CASTLE!"
Harry would be wearing a badge by day’s end.

Draco fixed him with a pitying look. “Obviously.”
Harry laughs. "I'm fine, get out of here."
"What?" Harry asked.
then. We were just like, family. You know, people you break bread with and worry about your kids with and have holidays with. We were like, platonic co-parents when I said that."
He's helpfully distracted by the appearance of an unreasonably blond head. Malfoy's coming around Piccadilly Circus wearing, of all things, a Tommy Hilfiger jumper.
A moment later, Albus emerged in his pyjamas—boxer shorts and a faded Hellebore t-shirt.
"You can make websites Untraceable?" Teddy asked with curiosity from the other side of the table.
"Oh, I'm keeping up. I'm just saying. I mean, you're right. But I'm not sure ranting about Old English is really the way forward."
Draco sat for a long moment, reeling from the speed and unexpected nature of the interaction. He closed his eyes, equilibrating, and when he opened them, he almost jumped to see that Nico had sidled sheepishly into James's abandoned chair.
Harry rolled his eyes. "We're doing this to save Magical Britain, remember? Snog Harry Potter, save the world."
Albus, apparently eager to change the subject, waved his wand to hold the pieces of his gingerbread house together, picked up a tube of icing, and said, "Dad, Draco, I've been meaning to ask you. What are you doing about the environmental potions thing?"
"God, you're hot when you talk about getting rid of all your money," Harry said, smiling but also clearly distracted—cheeks red, head lolling, voice uncontrolled. In a voice that sounded like an aside, like an actor pausing a performance, "Can I top you?"
"Do you really have to ask?"
"I don't understand," Albus said, voice quiet but powerful, "how any of this explains why you wouldn't tell
From there, it devolved into chaos.
Harry burst out laughing. He really shouldn't be gossiping with a clock, but one took one's jollies where one could, these days. "What did Smoot do?!"
Harry opened his mouth, then shut it. Aster poked his nose.
"DRACO!"
"I am," Draco said, confused.
Hermione snorts.
of that!"
Draco, to his credit, manages to let Harry continue talking without commentary.
Harry pushed the sleeve of his Auror robe up to glance at his watch. He'd be late for work if he didn't hurry up.
Harry sighed and slumped into his seat. Good. If Malfoy ignored him, all the better. Much less weird. Harry didn't mind being ignored by Malfoy.
Harry laughed. "Nothing. Sorry. Um." He took a breath. "I'm sorry I cancelled for skateboarding."
"You have something to ask me," Harry said wearily. "Look, you know I'll do what I can as head of DMLE; you know how much I've done these past months. I'm devastated that Penelope lost. But can you give me like a week to catch my breath before I start worrying about the next one? The last election has been over for like five minutes. I'm exhausted."
“Irrelevant. I should be able to have one. Would a beard interfere with my ability to perform my duties?”
Hermione brushes his hair off his forehead. "About being wanted, or about being unwanted?"
Draco sighed, then pushed his politician hair off his forehead. "We're talking about how we can manage to have sex while continuing to convince people that we are a besmitten couple."
"Yes, and I'm just telling you it isn't funny." Draco sat up and changed the subject. "So I suppose you need to follow this gag order. For now, anyway, since it seems too early to get yourself fired. It's better for everyone if you're in the DMLE to keep things from going to shit. Who knows what horrifying policies Rump will enact."
Harry's teeth bit into the tendons of Draco's neck and Harry's hand twisted on his penis and Harry's hips snapped forward—bodies, collision. Draco arched, gasping, and came, the warm feeling of release seeping through his whole body, eliciting tingles of heat and pleasure in his skin as the warmth of semen spilled over Harry's fingers. Harry moaned unintelligibly into Draco's neck, and Draco blinked, gathering himself back to reality in slow motion, face tingling, nudging Harry to keep going, to finish. Harry did, letting go of Draco and bringing his sticky fingers up to grasp—rough—at Draco's bicep, nails digging into skin. Sensing Harry was close, Draco reached forward, grasping at his arse, pulling as if to tug him closer though there wasn't any closer to tug, pressing his fingers firmly to the cleft of Harry's arse—fingers not long enough or lubed enough to penetrate, but
He still couldn't imagine. At least not what it would've been like as a child. He could
Harry snorted, staring at  Draco and wondering what that had to do with anything.  "Yes, I seem to remember stock in the
"Haven't you been reading about anarchism? Who's the one who says 'from each according to their ability, to each according to their need'? It's not about equal treatment, it's about making sure they each get what they need. And because Albus has an infant right now, his need for support is higher than the others'."
At this, Draco put his book back on the table and turned to fully look at Harry. It had been a very long time since Harry had seen him look so uncertain. "Well, sure? I'm surprised you'd want to."
“And look here!” Hermione continued. “
Draco took a seat next to Harry; their knees bumped together. "You're probably all wondering why we invited you here tonight, when there's not even a birthday or holiday."
He keeps asking himself why he hadn't even considered the possibility of an abortion. He should've immediately realised that's what Ginny would want. He should've immediately realised that's what
plan." He stood, crossing his arms and pacing slightly. "Is that how you planned all your Auror…raids and whatever it is Aurors do? Just, eh, worse comes to worst, it'll be fine, jump on in?"
The crowd cheered in horrible contrast to Harry's mood.
“Of course you’re not,” Penelope said with a smile. “I used something unrelated because otherwise you’d be too defensive to understand the process. I want you each to come up with an example—real or imagined—of a situation and an associated automatic negative thought.”
asked Harry on a date to Hogsmeade. One might say it was about time, but he’d gotten there eventually and is glad that Pansy can no longer harass him about it. But they aren’t a couple! Not yet, anyway.
Albus tilted his head. "How are
"Ex-husband," they each said.
“I guess the funny thing about living is that it doesn’t retain its novelty.” Harry sat on the bed to remove his socks.
"Well, I do," Penelope said. "I’m a person. I need imagination, too, even if my goals are different from yours. Imagination is important, Draco, even if you need to temper it with realism. None of us know what the world is going to be like, now, after the war. Maybe things will be different. Surely there are things that are impossible, but many things are possible. Many future paths are available to each of you."
"When did it change? A long time ago," Harry said, only moving his eyes towards the others once he'd said it. "But we've only been openly, honestly, actually together for a few months." Harry looked like he was done talking, but then he started up again. "And when we talked about it properly, we realised how bad it was, to build a relationship on a lie like that. And we—" he swallowed, "we figured it out. The details aren't important, I don't think. But we even dissolved our marriage vow, because we wanted to be sure our relationship is
"I'm serious!" she says, getting herself under control and bringing her feet up on the bed, legs bent. "I think there are exactly two people in the world who would tell you to get over yourself, and I'm one of them. Well, and Ginny. Three people."
"Har har," Harry said.
Draco nodded, then asked, "Is there anything we need to coordinate before Ron and Hermione arrive?"
Harry looked at the rug, then made himself look back up at her.
Harry closed his eyes and sighed. "Right, sorry Wilhelm. It's not you. I appreciate the reminder, but I will be here at my desk writing an important fucking policy paper and feeling like I'm going to fuck it all up, rather than listening as the nation is handed over to a madman."
Harry handed it over and let Draco lead. Draco was probably going to take them to the Reptile House, despite earlier claims to the contrary, and give Harry some kind of lecture on Slytherin pride.
"Lambicus warmicus?" Harry ventures, which earns him an elbow to the stomach.
I put my hands on the wall, imitating Potter imitating Dumbledore. At first, nothing, but then I feel it. A disturbance in the magical energy. I have no idea what it is. I try to get a feel for it, then I turn to look at him. "Is this a spot that's missing magic, or a spot that
“I am wearing colourful socks,” Draco said triumphantly. “I’m pretty sure that was disallowed somewhere in here.”
"Potter," I spit. He glances over at me, but I can't think of any words that could begin to address the situation.
Draco let out a noise like a cross between a frustrated groan, a lusty moan, and an amused laugh. "You have to stop with the bad innuendo. It's embarrassing."
? They're batty.”
I pull off my robe, leaving me in a vest and trousers. Potter gives me a strange look that I absolutely do not have time to dwell upon. I invert the robe pockets. There's a pocket watch, a Mixie's Mint, and a scrap of paper. "Empty your pockets, Potter. We need to know exactly what we have at our disposal." I rip apart the seam of my robe at the back of the neck and pull out the tiny metal strips that hold it in place. When I touch them, they hum faintly with magic. I toss them into the pile.
because it makes for such bad PR."
Harry sat back on his heels, staring at the flames. A
Of course they were. In those clothes. They didn’t shy away from confrontation when working to make change.
The witch behind Harry poked him in the back with the metal duck to get him to move forward in the queue.
Draco hitched his shoulder. "Of course. They're always welcome." He was about to Vanish the vegetable scraps, but a hand wrapped around his wrist.
Harry slumped in relief when the deafening noise ceased.
“I was looking out for your well-being,” Harry corrects. “Merlin knows you won’t look after it yourself. Hiccoughing for three straight days, no end in sight.”
Harry shrugs. "Your guess is as good as mine."
"And now?"
"It doesn't mean we're not in it together," Hermione says, frowning. "It doesn't mean we're not, what did you say? Going it alone, together?"
name, like my mum."
"But what you're suggesting is that those actions are, perhaps, beyond forgiveness? That's very interesting, Ronald."
Albus snorted. "Like it or not."
Ugh, I need to change the subject. "I can't believe we're going to die today. If I'd written a bucket list, it would be mostly unchecked. What do you wish you'd had a chance to do, Potter?"
"A Squib. She has a practice that sees both Muggles and magical people. I don't know how much I like her, yet, but I have an appointment."
Harry wonders, confused about what he's supposed to be doing, when Malfoy scoots down and swallows Harry's cock from underneath.
But right now Harry could imagine them all laughing, playing stupid party games (in his mind, everyone was pretending it wasn’t obvious that Seamus was using magic to make the bottle land on Dean), the look on Hermione’s face when she tried a tequila shot and the look on Ron’s when she proposed making it a body shot, Luna and Ginny aggressively playing Twister, Harry hanging back in the corner chatting up Malfoy, leaning in to kiss behind Malfoy's ear—
Harry frowns. "I don't—I don't think so? Kind of? I told him to fuck off, but at the end he tried to give me soda and said we could have sex."
they include women of ethnic minorities and use them in storylines with racist stereotypes." She crosses her legs. "What do you make of that?"
He hiccoughs into Harry’s mouth.
He needs to avoid the situation, not talk to Ginny's brothers.
They spent a full thirty minutes working on Harry’s automatic negative thought, “post-war wizarding politics is hopeless.” Penelope had to stop the two of them once they’d offered a combined twenty-four items for the “evidence for” category and not a single item in the “evidence against” category.
"I'm saying I enjoyed it immensely." Harry gave Draco's nipple a playful poke. "The Veritaserum judges are wank. We are really good at the whole having-sex thing. The best."
of the milk you offered?"
drunk," Teddy replied. "Just not as shitfaced as you two. And don't blame me. That was all your children's doing. I'm going to cast some charms to hydrate and so you won't puke, okay?"
"Hermione, where's the remoot?" Ron's rifling around under books on the coffee table. "I want to watch that music channel Harry paid for."
Harry squeezed Draco's hand.
Draco cut him off with a kiss, swallowing his infuriating and wonderful teasing. Harry's hands found Draco's back, scratched over scapulae and hip bones, grasped at the place where thigh met arse, tugging Draco closer.
"Well, I won't stand for it, Malfoy! Someone needs to call you out on your shit, and if I am in the vicinity it is clearly going to be me!"
"Are you insane?!" Harry spluttered, finally interrupting. "Why am I asking that—yes, the answer is yes, you're clearly insane. Draco, the next election is
Lorraine Disapparated.
“It’s so interesting,” Harry said, staring at the shimmering potion.
"Why don't you want me to know what you're drinking?" Harry asked, eyes still narrowed. "You know what I'm drinking."
"That is…" Draco paused, trying to decide how exactly to characterise Harry and his former assistant, both of whom quit their jobs at the Ministry, starting an anarchist book club, "adorable."
"I know."
McGonagall’s first order of business upon becoming Headmistress had been to hire three Mindhealers to work full time at Hogwarts for the next year. One, Penelope, would work solely with the returning eighth years. For the eighth years, weekly therapy sessions were a mandatory part of the curriculum. The other two Mindhealers were working with the rest of the student body as needed.
Malfoy opened his mouth, then closed it. "Fine."
"Potter," I say, "stop giving the corpse the once-over."
"I didn't want to put a bra on," she said, rummaging through cabinets and amassing a queue of ingredients Levitating behind her. "Plus, at the market you have to pay."
"In any case," Hermione continued, for some reason not wanting to continue talking about Malfoy's coffee habits, "Robards has assigned us a new case. We have a meeting in five."
Harry opened his mouth, but Rump didn't let him speak.
“Yeah,” Ron said, leaning back and closing his eyes. “Let’s just stay here.”
Harry pulled Draco close, crushing him in a hug. "I love you," he whispered.
"I can't believe you're still on that keto shit."
At the Muggle reference, Harry peeked at Malfoy, but Penelope's hand motions must have sufficed as explanation, because he didn't raise an eye. Or maybe he knew what rollercoasters were—it wouldn't even surprise Harry. Malfoy's surprises had ceased to be surprising.
It's mouths wherever they can reach, sucking an earlobe or a shoulder. It's the sensation of another body, of skin, of heat, of life. It's a bizarre desire to crawl inside another person, to not be alone in separate sacks of bones anymore, to be with someone else, to be done with this preposterous experiment in separate consciousnesses. It's a hot pool of warmth gathering in bellies. It's sweat-glistening forehead pressed against nose. It's "I'm close" / "Not yet, this isn't a Snitch race, I'm not there yet". It's the bristly scape of chin and the feeling of soft-fuzzy hair on tangled legs. It's a grasping of fingers and a gasping of breath as they each come.
Draco sighs. “I tried holding my breath. I tried scaring myself—took out my old copy of the Monster Book of Monsters. I tried standing on my head. I tried drinking an entire glass of water in one go. I tried casting Aguamenti while crossing my fingers. And nothing fucking worked!”
Malfoy sighed. “We got the miracle already,” he said. “Why should we think we’ll get any more unlikely gifts? We need to be realists.”
"I'm sorry about all this noise," Harry apologised, wincing. "You're probably used to a much quieter Christmas."
years ago, but Draco had a look in his eye that stopped him. Harry's mind started boggling, trying to decide whether Draco was suggesting that
Draco cut off as a giant horseshoe on wooden legs came careening down the corridor, nimbly dodging objects in its path, coming to a stop at the door. The mediwitch threw open the door to let the object in, looking up only for a moment to say, "Nine centimetres!" Once the horseshoe was through, she closed the door.
Hermione sits up. "Start over. What happened?"
Malfoy spun around to look at Harry and clamped his hand over his mouth. “Wha—I don’t—I never think like that. I can still think of about a million reasons why none of those things will ever happen.”
Draco paused his rant when they sat at the table with full plates of eggs, toast, and fruit. Harry figured there was no way Draco's rant was truly finished—Draco would rant forever about most things, after all—but that he merely needed a breather and/or sustenance. Now was Harry's chance to change the subject, to focus on something they could actually
"You donated it…to Hogwarts?" Harry tried to integrate that with what he knew about Draco, another tiny clue making the full picture a bit clearer.
out of a fancy teapot that we didn't buy, and I just freaked the fuck out!"
“Alright,” Draco’s voice said from behind the bench, sounding smug. “Close your eyes. Hold out your hands.”
"We could have signs like, 'If you won't let the Unspeakables research love on Level 9, you can all study us here.'"
"It boggles the mind," Draco agreed.
Harry scowled. "You're mocking me! Or, no—" He cocked his head, like he was figuring Draco out. "You're trying to distract me, actually."
"I—" Harry started. "We should've talked about it. I let my…fear, I guess, get in the way. I was all ready to talk about it, but then we got interrupted, and—" Even half finished, getting the words out was a weight off his shoulders.
Aster slept soundly on Harry's chest, her chubby little cheek smushed against him, her thumb now in her mouth. He had one hand on her back (amazing how she was so small—even now, as the good-sized seven-month-old that she was—that Harry's hand took up the better part of her back) and the other waving at his side to flip the pages of the book floating above them in the air.
"You absolute asshat!" Draco hissed. "What the fuck are you doing, you—"
“Not negotiable,” Draco says, pushing Harry off his lap. “Until then, we can go make the four lasagnas.”
He has a vision of Ginny, the way she looked at the beginning of the battle, how happy she was to see Harry. And how, after, he let himself use her as a way to feel normal despite feeling dead inside, how easy it had been to let the momentum carry them along. But then, a baby—the man on the TV stares at Harry (
"No," Draco said, "but if you want to come over and see about renovating the fourth floor to your taste, I'd be happy to call my designer. Or you can hire some Gryffindorish designer, if you like."
Draco walked in, closing the door behind him, and raised an unimpressed eyebrow. “Why does my room look like the site of an erumpent stampede?”
Radcliff is Stunned, so at least he's not moving, but I've never attempted such a complicated Transfiguration. Potter, staring at Wormtail's lifeless body, seems to be thinking the same.
If Harry had any doubt about his attraction to Draco (which he clearly didn't, despite pushing it out of his mind most of the time out of a swirling myriad of reasons), it would've been settled by the swoop of Harry's stomach, the tug of want he felt deep in his gut. Harry blinked, the smile dropping from his lips for the first time in hours.
"I love you too."
Ginny and Astoria ran in. Harry and Draco followed.
Draco caught his eye, and Harry could see all the ways that Draco understood. Draco's difficult, harmful family. The way his family put him in harm's way during the war. The way his parents constrained his options after. The way Lucius sometimes made Scorpius cry. The way Draco had to constantly atone for his parents' sins, getting nothing in return but lectures about tradition and a vague, aristocratic-distant regard.
"Like what?" Harry asks, looking down at himself, still confused.
"Wil, er, don't take this the wrong way, but I'm going to have to send you downstairs, alright?"
There was a long silence. Draco didn't speak. He wanted them to say they agreed, that they were sorry, anything.
but he also can't be arsed because he really wants Malfoy's tongue in his mouth again. She nods, and once outside, Harry turns around, his ears fuzzy as they adjust from the loud noise of the club. "Erm."
Draco elected to ignore this.
A note next to the cauldron read:
Harry had been keeping his eye on James, Albus, and Teddy, ready for them to embarrass him in some as-yet-unknown way. That was his own fault—he'd always had a soft spot for Lily. He should've realised it would be her, and that she had to do nothing more than distract him slightly while she refilled his drink.
"It is an important job!" Harry said, taken aback. "I needed to do it—to make sure that our law enforcement doesn't fuck people over! I, of all people, know how important it is for authority to be kept in check."
"I can't believe after everything," he says, throwing an arm out to the side, "I'm going to die here, with you."
"I'd really like to," Harry whispered. For a long second, Harry thought Draco was going to step away.
"Can I ask you something?"
Harry rolled his eyes. "No, not
They filed out, Hermione’s beard leading the way. Harry walked behind Draco and did his level best not to look at Draco’s bare legs.

"Alright," Draco said primly, spearing a bite of eggs.

Harry gives her a small smile.
“Did you see that little girl? My kids were naked like,
. I kept having nightmares after, and I keep wondering what I could've—"
"Are you sure you're not just talking about your reaction to him? You've always had a strong reaction to him."
Harry, resting his chin on his hand, looked up. "Sure."
"Kisses for Poppop!" Harry said, sounding delighted.
"I heard that," Hermione says, running her finger down the page. "Alright, it's after five o'clock on Samhain, the veil is thin, we conjure the flames according to these instructions, we send the letter to the Beyond."
Harry's face softened, and he groaned, dropping his face into his hands. "Draco. You're so used to getting everything you want. I mean, it's lovely that you want better for me, but the fact that you think it's changeable is…laughable."
"But what about this suspicious green drink?" Harry cried. "Who orders something that turns their mouth green?! Is this like, taking the Slytherin aesthetic one step too far? You know my track record for being right about Malfoy is fairly high."
"Of course not," I say. "Most places don't have magic like this. Only big wizarding homes, or like, Hogwarts. It's not exactly something one often needs to do. My father tried to teach me, and, of course, I ignored him. Something about giving the magic form? I don't know."
"We would let them take photos of us in the house, et cetera."
Draco loosed a loud sigh, which made Harry grin. "No. I meant, you peeled with a charm and then chopped with the knife. Why don't you simply chop with a charm?"
"Aye."
“I said I like you and you didn’t respond, just came back with some tangential thing and left me sitting here wondering if you like me back.” Harry kicked his shoes to the side. “Which is ridiculous, because I am not twelve.”
“The dress code said no visible knees,” Harry croaked out, staring at Draco’s knees. “I specifically remember something about knees.”
There was a long pause in which Draco stared at him in horror. “
"I got it," Jorgen said, kneeling down. "I'll bring them to your house—go, go! Tell me when she's born?"
Harry laughed. “Don’t you remember that with Scorpius?”
"He—we sat and drank coffee."
"I mean," Ron says, "it's one thing at the party, with everyone from RAMag there, but this?!"
Harry's face flushes with heat. Fuck. He'd been doing a fairly good job of forgetting for the past couple days, and now. "Erm. Yes, of course. Invite her. Ginny is family."
Draco gestured to the seat across from him, which only deepened the lines on Harry's face.
"So yeah, I was a spoiled brat, but all I really wanted was someone to pay attention to what I wanted, which they never did."
“You hook up with Bones and Finch-Fletchley in year five, and I get really annoyed.”
The waitress arrives with Harry's tea and Malfoy orders tea and a muffin. After she leaves, Malfoy grabs a sugar sachet and starts fidgeting with it, flicking it back and forth between his fingers.
you or anything. I thought you were propositing
Draco leaned forward and kissed him, a big, eager, closed-mouth sort of kiss, and it took Harry completely by surprise.
Malfoy’s eyes widened as he realised how much he’d said. “I don’t—” he stammered, “I don’t actually want to say that to them. At least, not like that. I really can’t do all that.”
Harry groans, not wanting to think about what any of this means. "I went over to Draco's before. He yelled at me."
“Hey Malfoy,” Harry said, his entire body flooded with imagination. “Want to go to a skatepark Saturday? I have no idea how to skateboard. We can suck at it together. It’ll be fun.”
“Are you better off?”
"It's hard to imagine her growing up," Lily mused. "And I'm her only aunt, not even a parent! But still, that's like, a big responsibility, Dad. I need to be cool enough that she wants to hang out with me, and approachable enough that she can ask me about periods and stuff when Al and Scorp scare the pants off her with their over-preparation and, I dunno, visual aids."
When Harry was an Auror, Head Auror, Head of DMLE, he'd put enormous effort into working against abuses of power. He single-handedly instituted de-escalation training, Muggle and Squib sensitivity training, Dark Magic recognition training for all officers, multicultural spell awareness training, Poverty Is Not A Crime Week, Being a Creature Does Not Constitute Probable Cause Week, and many others. He'd written dozens of policies that encoded proper channels of authority in ways that would minimise power over-steps.
Draco nodded. "Well, specifically about the spell tracking. I had a call from Dennis Creevey. He's wondering if I'd be willing to argue the case in front of the Wiz."
cannot second-guess
“Stop flattering me,” Harry says, pulling back to meet eyes.
Harry tugged his shirt off and turned around impotently, no idea where he should put it. “Er, do you have a washing basket? Should we get a second, or…?”
"They can handle anything," Harry said. "I'd be more worried about myself, to be honest."
"I said
"Have you had their muffins?" Harry asked. "This ginger cardamom sounds interesting."
I hit my head on the wall; the rough stone cuts a gash in my forehead.
"Angry about the research blackout, but otherwise good," Draco added. "Did you see the news?"
“That may be true,” Harry said, because he remembered how desperate he was. “But you’re still a wanker.”
The door to the bedroom—which had already been open—flew open farther still, hitting the wall with force. It didn't bounce back, though, just stayed open against the wall—Draco must've slammed it open with magic.
"It's just—this whole look is extremely leggy." Ron bit into an apple. "Usually when I see so much leg, they're shaved. It's just notable, is all." He paused. "Hermione is going to be so happy with you. Body hair is going to be one of her upcoming causes, I just know it."
“Oh stop,” Harry says. “You know I still think you’re fit. But we’re both kinda, you know. Saggy. Grandfathery.”
When the music blared, they danced. When people clinked spoons on glasses, they kissed. When people shouted "awwwww," they smiled.
Harry's trying not to question it. Easy is good. He deserves easy.
It was true—they knew they'd have to give an interview soon. Much of the public had been wrapped up by the star-crossed lovers angle and didn't seem inclined to rest until they had evidence that the couple was together and happy despite the odds. "It could work. Give the public the story they want and give a little fuck-you to Rump."
She shook her head. "Right. That seems likely. I just need some ingredients." The paper in her hand was a recipe.
Harry squinted. He knew that song. “Are you—are you whistling Willy Wonka?”
Harry snorted. “Evil Stepfather isn’t even a trope.”
But then Harry marched back into the room, not looking like Albus at all. He had a determined fire in his eyes as he took his seat, unscrewed a small bottle, and tipped liquid into his mouth.
They were so close. Harry could hear Draco's heartbeat. They hadn't been—not since the night Aster was born, not since they'd somehow made the ill-conceived choice not to talk about the fact that they'd joyfully fucked. And now he wasn't sure whether he should melt into Draco's touch or feel awkward about deriving pleasure from it.
Harry's brow furrowed. "It's not that deep. We're having coffee? I can't keep seeing you without feeling curious about how you are. We have too much history to ignore each other—I don't want to ignore you. So we can have coffee?"
"Of course I haven't!" Harry shouted, exasperated. "Of course I hate it! But this is my life, Draco. I do things because I have to. Welcome to my world."
quiet," whispered Harry, looking around warily. "When are my kids ever quiet? Quiet is a bad thing, Draco—I learned that lesson around, oh, 2010."
For a few minutes they sit like that, Harry sipping his tea, taking comfort in his friend's embrace, in the comfort of shared understanding. He has the sudden premonition that he's been a terrible friend to her lately—making everything about him, even though she's going through just as much.
Draco met Harry's eyes, and though he said nothing, Harry could see the understanding, the confirmation that this wasn't fake. Not all of it, anyway. But maybe that was the problem—that Harry knew parts of it were real, but he couldn't tell which parts weren't.
"Put the world to rights, will ye! Raise a pint for me, lad."
"Really?" Draco asked.
"It didn't feel fake," Harry echoed.
"It's not a bad thing necessarily, Dad." Albus patted his arm. "And the same was true of Draco."
to walk before I could so much as chew." He paused, considering. "To this day, I blame them for my weak core muscles."
“You know fucking Willy Wonka?!” Harry spluttered.
"I guess we wait," I say.
your baby, and every parent in the world has felt that exact way. I would worry if you didn't. That you feel this way proves your induction into parenthood. Second—"
Draco's face has that Malfoy-mask quality. With a measured tone, he says, "I wouldn't have blamed you, if you did."
“Er, that’d be fun,” Harry said, trying to smile and not freak out about the fact that at least three times now he’d imagined himself getting with Malfoy, of all people. Malfoy, with whom he apparently had no trouble imagining himself as friends. Malfoy, who was sat here imagining things with him and laughing at Harry’s jokes. Malfoy, who got it.
"It's true," Malfoy said, finally starting to talk. "I am a lone ranger. Which is exactly how I like it. I could never work at a place like the Aurors, where everyone gets randomly assigned to work with other obnoxious people."
"I don't know what the fuck I want," Harry said, thinking of career paths and housing decisions and the weight of society's expectations.
"In a way, it did," Harry said, pleased that they were almost but not quite directly discussing their political affiliations. Parvati had wanted them to talk about the Clearwater campaign. "It's hot to see someone fighting for a cause you believe in."
“Good things will continue to happen,” Penelope said. “Good things happen every day. Today I ate an almond croissant, and I’m going to walk to Hogsmeade. And even these big things that you feel so strongly about, the political things, are not foregone conclusions. Someone could spearhead a movement to change the structure of the government. You could do that.”
Draco lowered himself on top of Harry, bringing their mouths close. Just when Harry thought Draco was going to kiss him, he said instead, "I can't wait for you to get to Chapter 30."
The Floo roared behind him and Lily emerged, shouting, "Dad! What the fuck!"
"Wait for it, wait for it!" Teddy said, jumping to his feet and closing his eyes—hands out expectantly.

did you do?”
"Er, no. Thank you!" Harry said, turning around and fleeing out of the cafe.
Draco turns, confused. "My wrist? What are you talking about?"
They drop the bags on the counter and soon the kitchen is merry and chaotic, ingredients everywhere. They're missing at least five necessary pieces of cookware, so they keep having to transfigure items into spatulas and casserole dishes. The glass that they keep Transfiguring into a spatula keeps popping back into glass form as they're using it, so eventually Harry and Draco have to give it the ol' "one-two-three
“Harry, you first.”
“Was it?”
I know that spell. It's a spell parents use to locate their children and to check their child's health. In the blink of an eye, I'll be surrounded in a glowing blue light that will tell my father exactly where I am and that I don't have a fever or illness.
"Thanks," she whispers. "Sometimes I think he will grow and it'll be perfect. Other times...not so much."
"I know." Draco pinched his nose.
about us having breakfast. Come on. Be reasonable."
When the results of their first experiment with a condom are in the bin, and their bodies are cleaned, lying unhurried in bed, Draco says, "You know Hermione's your family, right? It may not be...traditional, but that doesn't make it any less real."
“Tomorrow.” Draco spread his hands. “Publicity? It seems the next logical step.”
There was something pained on Draco's face. "I don't want to be another thing that forces you into a life you don't want."
Harry ducks into a Tesco Express. "I'm getting food right now, shut up. What should we cook?"
"Breathe, Harry," Draco said, casting an orb of light that floated above their heads. "Are you alright? He's worse than I remembered. Every time, he's worse than I remembered."
The next day, Harry takes a deep breath, adjusting the bag in his grip, and presses the buzzer.
"It's a great idea, Al," Harry said, smiling. "I never would've thought of that. This is why we need intergenerational protest. The problem is, that kind of protest can't be tied to this family. With my position and Draco's position…it would be a disaster."
"Harry—over here! Does this mean you're still gay?!"
"Well I didn't." Draco Vanished one book off the shelf. Harry wondered which book he'd deemed unacceptable. "He hated me in school."
"You have a vestibule."
"Except for that time with the whole Death-Eaters-take-over-the-government thing," Albus deadpanned.
Harry took a deep breath and forced his feet to move farther into the room, taking the purple armchair next to Malfoy.
The door to his office flew open; Harry looked up, frowning. He'd told Jorgen to go home an hour ago.
"Haz, who is your favourite Backstreet Boy?"
"You don't say."
"He did not."
"Lovely," I say, affecting disgust though I can hear myself smiling.
"I know, but I just like, I thought it would be
He stepped forward and wrapped James in a big hug, squeezing tight and settling in for a long one. James's arms wrapped around Harry's back, returning the squeeze, but then James walked them backward and flung out one of his arms to yank Draco into the hug.
"Because it would be embarrassing for them to have to lock up a bunch of well-known, upstanding citizens," Scorpius added, coming to sit on the arm of the sofa on Albus's other side.
"As far as I can see, the only person this would help is Borgin, back in whatever-the-fuck-year Tom Riddle worked there after Hogwarts. The current law only says that business owners can be held legally and financially responsible for illegal activity on their premises. It's common fucking sense. Business owners
saying things with Hermione, so he leaves as soon as he can. He grabs his bag and makes his way downstairs. He walks the few blocks to the building where he's supposed to locate a class called
“The fuck is that?” Harry asked as they strode toward the intrusion.
Draco covers his eyes with a hand as he shakes with silent laughter.
kid. Harry realised he didn’t have a script for this. His happy adult Harry self didn’t go to zoos and act silly and just have fun. It was exhilarating.
"And Draco has spent his adult life doing good work in the Wizengamot, despite everyone treating him like crap when he first started," Harry added. "He's right—we deserve to be happy."
Harry’s brow furrowed in confusion. “You said that already.”
do not tell you that things are not your fault. Other people might, but I do not. If something is your fault, I tell you. Is that not true?"
He reaches into the pocket of his Christmas joggers—they’re green to complement Harry’s red ones, gifted by Lily who had made them herself for the entire family seven or eight years ago—and pulls out his phone. He immediately swipes away a bunch of news alerts from the Prophet app and opens his messages. His oldest grandchild, Capella, has sent him a message that says, “I’M FREE UNTIL JANUARY!” followed by a bunch of Christmas emoji and then, “Can you help me with my potions homework? PS Merry Christmas!” Draco snorts, amused, and texts her back in the affirmative. He hates that Scorpius and Albus live so far away, but he can’t be too upset, as he talks with his son and his granddaughter almost daily. That, and it’s an excellent excuse for multiple trips to California each year.
The door to the room flew open, revealing a grinning midwife.
"Alright!" Harry said, laughing. "I'm not going to buy things until given the go-ahead."
Harry laughed and helped himself to another petit four.
Harry shrugs. "Looks that way."
Everything as it should be.
Salazar the cat walked past, glancing uninterestedly at Harry's head in the flames before she wandered off.
Draco let his head fall towards Harry. “Once I become, you know,
"I don't want to force you to give birth!" Harry throws his hand up in frustration. She's not listening at all. "I want to force you to take one tiny millisecond to consider how I'm feeling!"
"I'm literally on truth serum!!" Harry couldn't stop laughing. "His name was Oskar."
Draco continues to lecture Harry about proper mousse preparation even as he asks Harry if garlic should be chopped like sopophorous beans or like shrivelfigs, which Harry finds surprisingly amusing. When Harry tells him that cooking is not the same as potion-making, Draco says, "Well, you
Hermione raises an eyebrow. "Are you really going to make me say it?"
“Yes. I will make sure little master is comfortable.”
for each other. Or at least, I thought you were. And we were at home, in private, and I was the only one here—so why did you put on that act for
A couple of minutes later, Harry's knocking on the door, and Draco answers. He's wearing some of his new Muggle clothes, a pair of jeans and a loose striped t-shirt. As the door opens, music turns off.
Harry poured Draco a whiskey and pushed the glass across the desk. "What are you doing here? I thought you would be with Hermione at the Lab-Mag headquarters."
"Interesting. Are we anarchists now?" Draco asked, feeling smug about his beard deduction.
"Thanks," Malfoy says, rubbing his hand on his stomach. "And thanks for the fuck, Potter. I needed that."
going up when each of our divorces were announced. What of it, Draco?"
"It's not polite to make fun of a lack of musical ability," Draco insisted from somewhere behind him. "Madame Toussaint did try."
"Do you like poring over documents and focusing on the logic of minutiae?"
"And you?" Malfoy asked, looking curious despite himself. "How's life for the Saviour?"
“Do you feel that there are a lot of comfortable places?”
"It was nice to meet you," Harry says, trying to smile as he walks backward, out of the flat.
Harry shrugs. "Does it matter?"
"You're both mistaken," Astoria said, wiping her eye with a handkerchief. "She's clearly named after me."
Research reports prepared by his underlings littered the desk, and even though he'd outsourced that work, Harry was still pulling his hair out. He needed to draft a policy paper on racial and ethnic profiling in the DMLE, and it was the exact kind of work he hated—detailed, academic, research-heavy, and high-stakes. It was worse than writing an O.W.L.
baby and they
“Yeah, this is a shit policy,” Harry agreed. And it was.
you that I was having feelings. I didn't want to get married on false pretenses."
Her eyes usually sparkle with indignant fury when she says it.
Harry only just stopped himself from laughing. “Would you like me to ask him to stop? How long has he been at it?”
It's easier, somehow, when we're touching, and I feel a sickening lurch, like someone just reached down my throat and pulled out my spleen. I break my fall with my hands, and I look up, through my hanging hair, trying to see what's happening.
“Let’s just do it,” Harry said, grabbing two phials and filling them with the shimmering liquid, handing one to Malfoy.
Harry put his hand on Draco’s cheek and rubbed it down the hair—it was soft, not the prickly feeling of stubble, but coarser than head hair. It felt—good. Harry brought his eyes to Draco’s and found them staring back at him, a pink flush high on Draco’s cheekbones.
Malfoy's eyes flit to the doorway and widen slightly. Harry stares at him. Fuck it all to hell.
Harry froze, milk sloshing off his spoon. He blinked, then waved his left hand to Vanish the mess as he put his spoonful back into the bowl. "You think what?"
Harry glances over his shoulder at Draco, who is looking at the floor, his jaw set.
Draco snorted and kept petting Harry's head.
"I suppose," Malfoy said, his voice sounding even more patrician than usual. "It showed me that my imagination is not principled. It's dangerous. It's not prudent."
Harry’s eyes dropped to Draco’s torso—thin scars criss-crossed it. They’d discussed it years ago; at West Wittering beach, of all places, when Scorpius and Albus were teenagers. It was interesting how the scars had aged. The puckered skin of the scars adorned his otherwise unmarred but aging skin. It was a body well-lived in, Harry thought.
"Well, I don't know. I'm pondering."
"Can I ask you something?" Harry asked, cocking his head to the side like a crup.
"No, with your other husband."
"And not because of the war, or not only because of the war. Because I'm the type of person who didn't take into account that you needed not to have this type of expectation put on your shoulders. You've already saved the world at least twice, and everyone keeps asking you to do it again. You need to be with someone who will protect you from all that, not increase the burden."
"George Chambliss," Draco said without pause, sticking out his hand. "Personal solicitor to Mr Potter."
"Usually no one asks me if my wrist is going to get sore unless it was one of my dormmates making a vulgar joke about self-love," Draco says, trying not to smile. "I couldn't understand why you were suddenly talking about that."
Harry blinked. "Thank you? You too!"
Harry decided he’d better follow, even though he really did
Harry wrinkled his nose. "How do we plant the
Draco stared at him for a full five seconds. "Potter, your whole saving-people thing is a lot more extensive than I'd assumed. Have you ever discussed this with a Mindhealer?"
"It's exactly what we wanted, I think?" Harry asked, tossing his phone down.
"Oh come on, that deserved a laugh." Draco sighs. "We don't need armour anymore, right Harry?"
A hooting noise alerted them to an owl flying through the owl door Harry had installed above the window. It landed on the side table next to the novelty lamp of a gnome holding a torch. Harry reached over and retrieved the letter, which was addressed to Draco.
"Er, yes? What kind of question is that?"
She blinks, staring at his hand.
"The house is being immaculate," Lorraine said, her big eyes traveling around the room.
His phone beeped. With gloved fingers, he tugged it from his pocket and muttered the incantation that allowed his gloves to operate the touchscreen.
Ginny sits up tall, her mouth falling open. "Excuse me? You're going to need to repeat that."
An invisible clamp tightens around Harry's neck, bringing to mind the fucking Horcrux in the lake. Hermione has an
Albus snickered, apparently amused.
with his eyebrows while chewing a bite of buttered bread. Draco rolled his eyes slightly as he turned back to his food, and Harry noticed the way his fingers fiddled with agita under the table, out of sight of everyone else.
But Draco was right there, kissing him, and Harry’s body melted into the sofa. This was crazy—it was a workday. He was meant to be at work. And instead, his bare legs in a pair of cutoff jeans were pressed against Draco’s bare legs, a corduroy skirt hiked up over his arse—and Harry reached around to tangle one hand in Draco’s hair while the other stroked Draco’s beard. Draco leaned forward, pressing their bodies yet closer together.
After a tense few minutes in which Lorraine served tea to go with the cake, their phones buzzed almost simultaneously. Harry grabbed for his with shaking fingers.
"Shut up. And then he said that being wanted isn't some magic formula for a perfect life."
"Harry," Hermione said, reaching over to put her hand comfortingly on his arm, "Malfoy is not up to something. He's got Auror parole checking up on him every three months until 2008. You know this."
"Ow, you brute," Draco laughed.
"Albus Severus," Ginny said from the floor, "the baby is yours. The cervix is not. Leave it."
Shit. They should've practiced this whole routine on people who would be more easily fooled—it was expecting too much, starting with Ron and Hermione. They knew him too well. Harry didn't know how to react to Draco's hand lingering on his back, even though lingering had been
"Hey, Malfoy? You busy? I thought we could look at this Charms article."
Draco ignored him, pulling the letter from Harry’s hands and dropping it to the side. He placed his hands on Harry’s thighs, rubbing them up and down for a moment. “I really like your legs.”
I think about all the disturbing things I've seen in this house in the last year. I think about all of the "meetings" that were really nothing more than the Dark Lord threatening every follower and ranting about mass genocide. I think about the way he talks about Potter.
Harry sighed and turned to Draco. "Want to turn off our phones and watch a film?"
A mediwitch walked up behind Harry and Draco. "Oh, hello!" She glanced at Astoria and Ginny. "Your husbands are here!"
I raise my eyes. I try to imagine Potter and the Dark Lord in a duel. I try to really picture it—how they'd stand, what they'd look like, what ugly words the Dark Lord would monologue—to figure out what my emotions would be.
When Harry finished reading, Draco was staring into space.
Harry nods, hating talking about it but ploughing ahead anyway. "I want to. I don't particularly want to like, define anything. Do we have to? It seems—premature." What he doesn't say is he doesn't think he can manage that discussion. He doesn't want to talk about if they're a couple. If they're
Blue-Lens moved to the side, and Harry approached the barista. "Good morning," he said with a smile, hoping that he wasn't about to get the "Oh my god, it's Harry Potter!" treatment.
“I can think of a lot,” Penelope eventually said. “For example, we could write, ‘Voldemort is dead.’”
Harry laughed as he opened the book. The room and the bed were warm and homey, he had a book to annoy Draco with, all his kids were under the roof. It was Christmastime, after all, and all the worries about Rump and the world and the environment and the difficult decisions about what Harry could do as head of DMLE could wait. He flipped to Chapter One.
The unimpressed look on Harry's face reminded Draco of Medusa. "That is such bullshit. I mean, it's true or whatever. But that doesn't mean that everything had to change when you touched my dick!" Harry paused for a moment, then added, "Merlin, you're acting like sex is some mystical thing!"
Harry's laugh rang out, and he stood up. "Let's go flying."
There was a knock at the door, and Jorgen poked his head in. "Mr. Potter, you've got a message to call Albus."
"Alright," Draco said slowly. "The matter at hand is this: I'm going to bid for the Ministerial election in four years. I know you understand the political situation well enough to know why I am a good candidate. The Blimps are a complete disaster. They're terrible on social issues, despicable on queer rights, detestable on treatment of all social minorities; they are confused on fiscal policy, backward on immigration, wand-happy on defense, and contemptible on international diplomacy both Muggle and magical. They have the backing of the pure-blood traditionalists—and the right-wing Blimps more generally—only because they're scared and their xenophobic fears have been stoked by Rump and the rest of them."
"I have to go," Harry says. "I need to—" He points at the door, reaches for his phone and keys, and tucks his wand into his jeans. "I'll see you later, okay?"
stoop to diminutive endearments."
. And all the other stuff too, obviously—war, et cetera.
Harry honks a laugh. “Unintentional pun. But also, it’s a sincere offer.” He holds his hand up and wiggles his digits. Draco can read the scar that says
Draco pulled his phone out, scrolled for a moment, and handed it to Harry. "The LabMag office got a copy. It will be announced tomorrow."
doing here?"
Shit, now he was sitting here
Harry glances at Ginny. She seems to be making a renewed effort to eat. Harry hopes she doesn't end up vomiting at the table.
"You know that I don't care if I get the Malfoy family…money, or whatever. In fact, I'd kind of rather
The morning light shines through the window; Harry can see a swirl of dust. "I can't
babies.
"I was just saying!" Harry said. "It only made sense, given the situation! I wasn't opposed to it. I mean." Harry paused. "I don't know why I said that to you, actually. It was pretty fucking weird."
"I don't think I'll ever sleep again, after seeing this," Potter says.
Harry stared at him, eyes bright. After a long second, Harry nodded. "I can do that."
They settle on a workaday warming charm, which only slightly improves the leftover lamb, and start up the NES. Harry selects "GAME B: TWO DUCKS," the dog sniffs, and they start shooting.
"What can I say?" Harry said. "We're both slobs." Laughter.
Harry knew, without a doubt, that Hermione was right about his knees being more distracting than hers. One summer Witch Weekly had published a photo of him at the beach with a cover story about his “distinctive” knees.
, Mother had said. I try, but even my eyeballs hurt.
"Nonsense."
As the other kids arrived, Harry glanced at Draco, wondering whether they were ready for this. Over the past couple months, they'd had regular meetings in public. Enough to cause speculation in the Prophet about the frequency of their meetings. The headline
Harry should laugh. Standing here staring at Draco was going to make it more awkward. He should lighten up the mood!
Five minutes later, Draco had finished his explanation of the uses of the different items. Albus loaded the baby gear into the Floo-ready fire and hollered, "The Snake Pit!" The flames whooshed, and the stuff disappeared.
"Right."
ancient.” Harry took his change, their tickets, and a map and thanked the person who helped them. As they walked through the ticketing area, he continued, “I think people tend to come with children, but it’s hard to see why. It’s not like animals are only interesting to children. Which animals do you most fancy seeing? Ferrets?”
Draco held up a hand. "I happen to be in possession of these items, which I am happy to offer you. Lorraine?"
“But I can’t take on big cases while also dealing with this Rump stuff and trying to prepare for a political campaign. Any word on the campaign to get rid of the Taboo?”
Harry pushed his shoulders back as he answered, "A kurta and churidar, surely appropriate clothes for a work environment, which is more than I can say of many Ministry employees. I've seen people in Muggle-Worthy Excuses come to work wearing bathing costumes, after all."
Albus set down his mug. "Dad, honestly, it's fine. It's actually really nice to see you like this. You seem— Well, you seem…undefeated."
And perhaps they spent most of their free time together, even on weekends, rather than Apparating to see other friends and relations. It doesn’t mean anything. It
"Understand what?" Harry asked, tugging off his shoes.
James nodded throughout Draco's explanation, having Conjured a quill that took notes on an invisible surface in the air next to his head. "And when do we worry about graphic design? Because I really want the label to have like, a castle, obviously, but also like," he paused, thinking, and blew a big raspberry, "a hippie potions master aesthetic. Like Severus Snape in an emo commune."
Harry didn’t want to hurt it, so he leaned forward and blew at it, pursing his lips to send a stream of air that would nudge it off Draco’s face. The stubborn bugger didn’t move, so Harry blew again.
"What would you want to try on those boards, Stability and Impact-Resistance Charms?" Draco asked.
a pushover with your kids."
comfort, in this case, but like a lover just the same.
," he spat, surprised by the vehemence and contempt in his tone.
He looked around, thinking how strange it looked, thinking back over the years he'd lived there. Nothing like moving to make one sentimental.
“Our room is on the second floor,” Draco said. “You’ll know Scorpius’s room because it says
?" she asked, looking up at Harry with her big brown eyes. "You seemed so certain."
He keeps thinking about what the world would be like if his parents had decided not to have him. He obviously believes in the right to have an abortion! He may have even come to the conclusion that it was the right choice, in this case. But it's hard—knowing that you yourself might not have been wanted. It's like Ginny's uterus is the cupboard under the stairs, and the baby was small Harry.
"Yes."
"You're completely ridiculous, do you know that?" Draco asked, squeezing his eyes closed and pressing his fists against them until stars appeared. Then, "You've fought off Inferi?"
Harry pushed himself up, pressing his lips to Draco's, pulling him closer, lest he think Harry had changed his mind.
He knew that he was about to face Goldie Masters, protegee of Rita Skeeter. What a load of bollocks.
Harry shrugged again. He wasn't proud of how he and Ginny had been before their divorce. It wasn't something he talked about much. He was proud they'd made it through that—that they were good now. "We fought all the time, about everything. Hermione said it was like watching Godric Gryffindor married to himself. We, I don't know, resented each other, I think. Maybe that's what comes from getting married too young, having kids young. Everything was chaos all the time. Neither of us would take responsibility for things. If one of us was on our own, we'd be fine, but when we were together! I don't know. It was a mess."
wanted, and life is still crap! Do you think that life is automatically fantastic, peachy keen, for people whose parents wanted them? Look at me, you fucking tit! All my problems are
Because Harry was an adult. And adults talked about things like this.
Harry would have liked to say he was not into it. In truth, his libido liked it even more than the skirt. Well. At least as much as the skirt. Well. Maybe Harry was just into Draco, because he was pretty distracted by him even on an average Thursday.
And he knows he could work at WWW with George, if he wanted.
Al groaned, dropping his head into his hands. Scorpius, rubbing Albus's back consolingly, tried unsuccessfully to stop a smile.
Harry opened his mouth to respond, but Rump held up a hand. "Get inside. Who is this?"
“Auror.”
Harry had been divorced for a long time—over twenty years now—and he didn't miss marriage. He was happy alone, for the most part. But this, having another adult around to make eye contact with, sharing a generation-removed moment of understanding, he'd always missed. When a child (of any age) said something preposterous, it was torture to be the only adult around, to have no one with whom to catch eyes. Harry often found himself texting Ron, Hermione, or Ginny—needing to share these moments, even though it wasn't the same when you had to relay it.
Harry sighs. "She went to St Mungo's and got an abortion while I was testifying at the Wizengamot. We didn't even talk about it. She just went and did it."
The three dots appeared almost instantaneously and he waited impatiently.
Ron started to laugh, his leg slung over Hermione’s lap and his face reddening as he tried to suppress his chuckles.
Harry doesn't answer.
"I think people will be focused on the fact that you're arguing for civil liberties. I don't think you need to make it any bigger than that. If you want, maybe Dennis can make some kind of public show of asking you, so it seems like you're responding to the call rather than eagerly jumping at the chance?"
Malfoy looks down at his white jumper with its enormous red and navy logo, reading
“Jamie, it does seem like maybe you’re better off. You don’t want to be with someone who doesn’t get you.”
Harry looked over his shoulder, hearing the frantic tone in Jorgen's voice. There was something on Jorgen's face—it reminded Harry of the anxiety of a parent getting a phone call from their child's school. It was one of his kids. It was the anxiety that bubbled in a parent's chest, provoking a panicked,
personality and tendencies—he wasn't talking about Harry Potter, the Saviour, or Harry Potter, father to James, Albus, and Lily, or Harry Potter, Head of the DMLE.
"Castle…" Draco tried to keep his face clear of judgment, but he couldn't be sure it worked.
Ron and Harry were well-matched Auror partners, too. The difference was, they spent most of their time trying to avoid extra work, and a small percentage of their time jumping into dangerous situations to stop bad guys. You couldn’t pay Harry or Ron to care about punctuation, and in fact, Robards had tried. He’d claimed it was part of their job—that their reports needed to follow the Ministry Style Guide, whatever that was.
Harry rolled his eyes fondly. "What are you, twelve? I don't know! Best blowjob I ever had was from a German bloke I was in a relationship with one summer in the twenty-teens."
He nods.
He knew that, whatever it was, it was going to be a fucking
Draco trailed off, stood, and wandered out of the bedroom, leaving Harry and Albus blinking after him.
Malfoy opens his mouth, then closes it. "This is literally true of any two or more people who are in the same place at the same time. This has been true every time we've seen each other for the past few weeks."
"Hey!" he said in the same soporific tone he'd been reading in. "How was work?"
He raises an eyebrow. "It seems worth noting that they can't keep the rats out."
He smiled. "I know I need to move. I should've moved before, really."
Aster sat, reaching up with pudgy arms. In one hand was Harry's barmy wooden clock man. The one that had perved on them that one time. Draco hadn't seen it in ages.
oppressed people, and because there's "no rule that you must be 100% Indian to embrace the culture, Harry."
"Of course I do," Draco snapped. "When it's convenient. With amenable co-workers, usually. I pretty much always get laid at the Magical Solicitors' Union annual conference."
helping Harry now would be akin to supporting Voldemort. "Erm, okay. As long as you haven't forgotten about, you know, electability and all that."
Draco raised an eyebrow, as if to ask Harry if he’d like to continue listening. When Harry shook his head, Draco recast his sound barrier.
"I'd do it all differently," I say softly. "If I had a second chance."
"Oh give me a break, Potter. We both know that's not true. Why would you be standing here right now if that were true?"
After they'd been there two hours, the mediwitch informed them that the mother was six and a half centimetres dilated.

he shouldn't, but he couldn't stop himself.
idea.”
She's tossing a balled-up jumper into her wardrobe. When it lands, it levitates off the shelf, folds itself neatly, then inserts itself into a stack of jumpers organised by colour. "Hi Haz."
"Er, no," Harry said. "But we should probably talk about this so I can stop taking out my anxieties over my uncertainty on unsuspecting co-op workplaces."
Draco rolls his eyes. "Get some forks." He carries the takeaway into the sitting room. "Let's play Duck Hunt."
Draco gave him an odd look, the breeze ruffling his hair. “Do you really want to know?”
Draco had once thought doing the right thing would get easier with age. He thought wisdom would shine a light on the path of rightness, or some nonsense. What he hadn't realised was that, in some ways, it got harder—when he was seventeen,
"Boys!" Hermione hollers. "What do you want?"
“The question is whether you want a hand with your, er, cure, or if you want to do that on your own. We can still make it to dinner. I’ll just wait in the corridor, if you like. How long will that take, really?”
“Of course,” the elf said, grabbed the bags, and Disapparated.
He looked around. The entrance hall was less ostentatious than one might imagine, although Harry was dangerously close to invoking the word "vestibule."
Harry smiled. "Excellent, because I don't fancy you charming my clothes." He walked to the sofa and flopped onto it. "Ugh. Work is unbearable with everyone talking about Rump."
“I don’t know,” she said easily. “No one can know for sure, though I’m sure you’re right about much of it.”
Malfoy pressed into Harry's space, and he was kissing back. Heat rushed to Harry's face and chest and he reached forward to touch Draco with no real plan of where his hand would land, just wanting to touch him somewhere. It landed on his shoulder and Harry pressed his fingertips into Draco's skin.
"I just—it made me feel like I've never been wanted, not for the right reasons, you know? And how am I supposed to figure out what to do now, when I don't belong anywhere?"
When the
“Very funny, Draco.” Harry waves his wand and the music changes to Christmas carols.
"That's not why I'm here, though," Draco announced. "Sorry, I got distracted. I wanted to talk to you about this legal action against Rump."
"About our wedding."
Draco, wearing a slim grey Muggle suit, was sat at a small table by the front window. His face was appropriately sad, a funeral face. Harry didn't know how authentically upset Draco was about Penelope's loss, or if it was an act—part of the whole political ploy. Sure, Draco didn't want Rump in charge, but he hadn't been a vocal supporter of Penelope's at first. He'd come around and worked on her campaign, but Harry knew Draco had been frustrated with how she did things. Draco's greying blond hair fell elegantly across his forehead, and Harry self-consciously rumpled his own as he dropped into the opposite seat.
"Why are you talking to me?" Malfoy asked, and he looked honestly perplexed.
"Wandless magic? You don't have some sort of special pure-blood connection to the house, enabling you to like, bend the house to your will or some shit?"
"Nice shirt," Harry says innocently.
"No!" Harry said. "Sorry. Well, I don't know. It would certainly put your opposition to Rump at the forefront of people's minds, which seems like it's probably a good thing when the election comes?"
, depending on your choice
, though. I went from thinking that maybe there was a possibility that I was hypothetically into blokes, like, if Ginny didn't exist, to
"That it's happening. He claims he doesn't need approval of the Wizengamot or of voters, blasted system as it is."
He hadn't said anything about Rump, but all the things that they knew about Rump swirled in the background—all his bigoted remarks about queer people and trans magical folk, all his othering of anyone different, all his disgusting oppression and hatred. His message was clear.
Draco leaned back in his chair and sighed. "I never wanted to get married again. I never wanted to get married to you for love. It wasn't…a thing I wanted. Getting married was a thing I did because it served a purpose, which didn't bother me. You know, Slytherin cunning and all."
When they landed on the beach, Teddy let go of Harry's hand and ran towards the house screaming "Vic! Dodo! Viiiiiiiiic!"
It's my father.
Draco came to stand next to Astoria. "I can't decide if it feels like a lifetime ago that we were here having Scorpius, or if that feels like it was just the other day."
this. Magical Britain needs this. Do you know how much joy you could bring to people, distracting them from their sorrow over Rump?"
“If what you wanted was for me to ravage you,” Draco says, putting mental effort into making his accent as posh as possible, “you should’ve given me one of the libido-enhancing potions from the Silver Sorcerers line, not this. Or honestly, if you wanted me to ravage you, you just had to ask.”
Draco spelled Harry's trousers and pants off, cast a stabilisation spell at his own spine (which Harry would almost definitely tease him for later), and took Harry's penis into his mouth.
After awhile, Malfoy sat on the stool next to Harry, back aristocratically straight. Harry stared at him for a moment, and then Malfoy slumped over onto his elbows, his body slouching like Harry’s. “Need to wait ten minutes.”
"Maybe you could drop some hints that you'd like to see me," Ron says. "Otherwise who knows how long it'll be."
intense because they're scared of you. So they would just vaguely speculate."
Harry stared at her long enough that she eventually added, “Is this going to be a problem?”
Draco's mouth tightened, a tiny bit of butterbeer foam on his lip. "Too right. I don't like it, but I don't think we can tell anyone. Not even our kids." He sighed. "Because if we tell just our kids, that's four people, plus two partners of James or Lily's, plus Teddy because you'd feel guilty not treating him the same as your biological children, that's seven, plus if Teddy tells a partner that's eight."
"Teddy's been texting us," Draco said.
. "The executor is Scorpius."
Harry was moderately drunk, and it was Lily's fault. She was wearing antlers ("If you're a Potter
"Yes," Draco said, and Harry got the impression that he wanted to be more involved in this interview but didn't know how to interact with Lee. "They were best friends since they started at Hogwarts, so it's been almost twenty years that they've been close."
The past few weeks had been a whirlwind—Rump about to become Minister, telling Ginny and Astoria and Ron and Hermione about his relationship with Draco (they'd all seemed less surprised than they should've, in Harry's opinion, and he worried at least one of them suspected it was a farce), then telling the Weasleys and dealing with the knowledge that Draco had informed his parents. It was simply too much to deal with. So yes, he'd been thinking about Rump's upcoming vow, along with all the other bullshit.
He saw, also, at least two Prophet journalists.
Potter groans. "I'm so fucking tired of waiting. All I do is wait."
“Hey Harry,” Hermione said. “Listen to this. Ron tried to get a book about sex from the library, only the Hogwarts library doesn’t really have any sex books, as we all found out in about year two, so what he found was this, in with the Muggle anatomy books.”
Harry wanted to say
Harry opened his mouth to make a lewd joke about what he'd like to put in Malfoy's body, but Malfoy, with a smile on his face, pulled out his wand and whispered "
"Who else did you tell?"
For approximately half a minute, Draco allowed himself to freak out. He buried his head in his hands, closed his eyes, and gave his mind the freedom to think whatever it wanted to think, which, in this case, was the thought equivalent of a string of about a hundred exclamation marks.
“I guess,” Harry said, uncomfortable with this whole thing. “Why can’t I just play it by ear? See how I feel then.”
, Draco. You realise we need to convince him we're head over heels for each other."
"Draco," Harry said loud enough to interrupt, "I'm not talking about us. You were right to ask me. It will be good for everyone, for the country, plus it's good for me, too—not living alone. You know this."
Harry's eyes scanned the sign with the offerings, and when it was his turn he smiled at Wren and ordered a vanilla latte, then stepped next to Malfoy to wait for it.
Harry sipped his coffee and let the happy warmth of Shell Cottage seep into his soul. Dominique finished nursing, and the sling immediately adjusted so that she sat upright, facing her mother, but she twisted her head around and reached for Harry. "Ga!"
fancy you. I sometimes unthinkingly assume everyone else is exactly like me."
"Harry!" Draco's muffled voice called.
Draco's heart clenched. He was about to ask the group if they believed him, if they could stop this interrogation, but Hermione stood, and he closed his mouth.
Harry knew from experience that the sofa was comfortable enough, though clearly not chosen for comfort. It was white. Harry had sat on it many times, but he didn't really want to sit there now, by himself. Maybe he should go help Lorraine. Maybe he should call Ron and have a good old-fashioned freakout—Ron probably wouldn't even blink, as it would come off as Harry being scared of commitment, which was of course a cultural expectation of men. Ron need never know that Harry's freakout was about agreeing to a decade-long marriage of convenience that required him to be Draco Malfoy's roommate in a much-too-fancy townhome with a vestibule.
"I once watched Dumbledore pull a chain of magic out of thin air," he says, jolting me from dwelling on my Patronus failure.
sounds different. Higher and less scratchy. “It’s a potion that changes according to your lover. I had to put one of your hairs in it, luckily you shed like a kneazle and I found like ten on my coat.”
Awhile later, while the stereo's blasting "Bulletproof...I Wish I Was", Hermione comes in and sits on the bed without saying anything. When he doesn't send her away, she crawls into bed next to him, wrapping an arm around him, and squeezes.
Harry nodded. “Good idea.”
I sigh. "Well, alright. There's only one Wormtail, though. I don't really fancy cutting the corpse in half first."
At Scorpius's voice, Harry jumped backward, away from Draco, eyes wide. Draco's cheeks were red and Harry covered a laugh. "Erm." He cleared his throat. "Wouldn't want our kids to catch us at it before we have a chance to tell them of our secret love affair."
did it," as if he hasn't just used this as proof he'll excel at Duck Hunt. "I don't particularly enjoy the outdoors, and I fear I'd be as hopeless at killing fowl as I was at killing Dumbledore."
"She has access to an Apothecary, you know."
Draco took a sip of water. "You don't say? Knock me over with a Hippogriff feather."
. It had been love.
"My parents were only nineteen when—"
Draco raised a quelling eyebrow. “You do realise that is definitely sexual harassment.” He turned to Hermione. “Is this what it’s like, all the time?”
They walked past the Forbidden Forest, and for a moment, the air seemed to crackle with tension. Harry knew Ron was remembering what Harry had told him about how he’d died, and hadn’t been sure he wanted to come back. Harry knew Ron knew Harry was thinking about it.
"For here am I sitting in a tin can, far above the world." Draco grinned widely now, apparently delighted that he could meet Lily's challenge.
Potter stands and starts pacing, which is going to give me a headache. "They didn't teach us this at school!"
you were ever attracted to me?” Harry blurts, laughing and then covering his mouth with his hand. “But Draco. How old do I look? Seventeen? Eighteen? I know how much you were attracted to me when we were older, when we were fucking each other’s brains out five times a day, and somehow it was
Harry, still in plank, turned to look at Draco, who was sitting on his arse not doing a damn fucking thing. “Think you can do better? Give me a break.” His voice did sound a bit strained.
The day after that, Harry set his alarm.
That this “eighth year” was a total farce.
Now Malfoy's brow wrinkled with confusion. “Of course. Willy Wonka was one of the first wizarding films, Potter, keep up. How did
Draco untied his shoes. “Imagine telling your fourteen-year-old self that his husband would be Draco Malfoy.”
“Sure, I—”
"Your guess is as good as mine, Potter. I have no idea how house-elf magic works. I'm sure they can keep him out for a while, at least."
"What?"
Harry tightens his grip.
He wanted to go home. He never should have let himself get involved with this bloody election. He'd been spending all his free time campaigning for Penelope, and now the unthinkable had happened: Norris Rump had been elected, and Harry's backlog of work was all for nought.
She laughed, the sound echoing oddly in the empty house. "I just want you to be happy."
"Yes," Harry says, looking at the tea cup in his hands. The cup shakes in the saucer, and he places it down on the counter. "Actually, I've just realised I've forgotten something I needed to do for my...class. I need to go back out. I'll see you later, Hermione, yeah?"
"You brought coffee! Bless you." Albus took the pot and Levitated three mugs to the table.
Potter doesn't deny it, but he pushes himself up and kneels, feeling around on the ground with his hands.
Harry’s good mood deflated. “Well, let’s see. Smacked me around a little and locked me in my cupboard. But not until after they bought my cousin a giant ice cream and wouldn’t buy me any.”
"You know what?" Harry said, finding that he had negative fucks to give about this. "Fine. You can give me as much money as you want, any time."
Harry's mouth dropped open towards the end of this explanation. "What the fuck, Draco! I
"I have no idea."
Well, there was nothing for it.
Harry and Draco had pointed out—many times, and to no avail—that a get-together with one's spouse-to-be and all your combined children in your own house (even if that had been decorated for a party with speakers and some kind of disco strobe) did not count as a "stag do." The kids had asked who they wanted to invite, but since Harry felt like he was going to be in Dad Mode at this party, the thought of inviting the entire Gryffindor contingent did not seem fun. So he'd said "just Ron and Hermione," and Draco'd said, "just Pansy and Daphne," and that was that. Here they were.
Harry rolled his eyes. Draco was rubbing it on a little thick. "Yes, husband, hello. What can I do for you that couldn't wait until I get home later?"
But Malfoy's right—he didn't kill Dumbledore, and the war is over. Harry wants Malfoy to go back to joking. "Yeah, if you tried to shoot birds, you'd just be standing in the field, mud up to your ankles, having a staring contest with a quail, trying to convince yourself to AK it."
"Voters won't vote for an unmarried candidate," Draco recited. "Statistics show that voters feel entitled to know about the Minister's personal life and that they would worry about how dating would affect a Minister's ability to perform their duties. Even if I were to swear up and down that I wasn't interested in dating, voters wouldn't believe me. They already know I'm gay—and despite the fact that I'm open to dating a woman again even if it hasn't happened yet and am therefore technically bi, people persist in their views—and we've never had an openly gay Minister. An openly gay
"I'd better come through," Draco said, casting an apologetic glance at Harry.
"They killed my owl," I say, and it still stings—Rutherford hadn't done anything wrong.
"No, it was meant to be a meaningless small-talk question about your work," Draco said, picking up his cup and taking a sip.
Draco steps out of Harry's reach. "If you try to talk about the war, you're not allowed to touch my cock."
. Think of the headlines! What better way to get public attention on the fact that Rump blockaded the Love Room?"
Hermione pulled out an Editing Quill and stabbed the parchment with aggressive red ink while Draco jabbed his finger at different parts of the text, egging her on.
"Who the fuck would drink that?"
Draco makes a pained
"Right," Harry said, not relishing the thought. He sighed. "I kind of can't believe the kids believed us."
Harry drowsed against a pile of pillows, opening his eyes when he heard Hermione’s warm laugh from the other side of the bed. He sat up, righting the book that had fallen off his knees while he napped.
"Draco!" Albus's face. A baby wailing in the background. Albus's
"Ah," Draco said, smiling meanly, "but you forget that they are proud of being arseholes. Being anti-love is probably part and parcel of their PR strategy."
Harry went to hug Ginny. "Hey, Gin. Good to see you. Hi Astoria. Is Gardon here?"
Harry leans closer, not breaking eye contact. "Do you want to see my bedroom?"
"And what about you, Draco?" Lee pushed. "When did you know you were in love with Harry Potter?"
Harry makes his way through the crowd, smiling at people, trying to look casual, trying not to give off a vibe that he's taking Malfoy into his bedroom. Malfoy rests his hand on Harry's elbow, and even that doesn't feel strange; it just feels like a friend touching his elbow because they're trying to stay together in a crowd—because that's what they are, friends. Except—Harry looks over his shoulder—not friends.
"I'm not certain whether rats engage in cannibalism," I say in my curious-academic voice.
"Which, to be fair, I was," Draco confirmed. But then he looked up. "Were you? Obsessed with me?"
“I was joking! She slathered on like half a jar of mayo! It required a joke!”
"She said it
Harry glared. "My point remains."
Malfoy sighed. "Fine, whatever, let's just order our drinks."
"How's it going, Al?"
Author's Note, 7 April 2020: Howdy from quarantine! I have never posted a fic as a WIP before, but I decided to do it because I am craving the community of an ongoing project. At the time of posting the first chapter, it is not completely written (I have 10k words written, I expect it will be somewhere around 100k). I will update tags and warnings as I go on, and if I add anything that might be triggering later I'll make sure to note it in the chapter notes. This is a bit of an experiment for me, and will force me to take a step back from perfectionism (what if I want to change something later?!), but I will prevail.

been holding up the queue, then stepped behind Blue-Lens. The queue was moving quickly, even if it was preposterously long. A moment later, Harry stood at the doorway, in the awkward position of being the one who had to hold the door open. He tried to hold it with his foot, but it slipped and hit him in the shoulder.
"We're okay," Draco says quietly. "I wasn't cross." Then, louder, "Though, I'm not sure whether you can really
Draco presses his lips together. “What the fuck did you do.”
Draco rolled onto his side and wrapped himself around Harry like a burrito, one arm and leg hooked atop him.
"There's lots of drinks that turn your mouth green," Ron said. "Witches Brew. Frog Fanta. Crocodile Cider. Burbling Sludge."
Harry smiled. "But I was finally going to order the Mood Mug."
There were three quick knocks on the door, and then it opened. “Dad, I was—”
“How much do you pay Lorraine?”
Harry raises an eyebrow.
want to talk about any of it, but it's not like we have any choice, is it? That's what our lives are like, full of all sorts of bullshit trauma and feelings and having to talk about it."
"What, and develop an addiction to a chemical compound that tastes like Skele-Gro? No thank you."
"Well that's not so strange," Hermione pointed out.
It took them ages to get out of the butterfly house, as every butterfly seemed to want to get a taste of Harry’s nose and Draco’s lip—even after they cast discreet
He whispers, "I don't know. Try to visualise it."
"Well?" Harry raised an eyebrow as he chewed. "Hit me."
Draco grinned. "Come now, Harry, I know you can't possibly be thinking more of time with your grandbaby than you are about the state of Magical Britain." The smile fell from Draco's face. "It really will be a fucking mess after four years, Harry. Rump could ban fertility treatments for gay couples. You know he's been talking circles around that. He could privatise St Mungo's. And who else could run? You know how hard we looked before deciding on Penelope."
If I wasn't so tired, I'd pick a fight, just to get his attention solidly on me again.
Hermione heaves a dramatic sigh. "Alright, I'm going to have to pick Malfoy up at a bar for a one-night stand." She cuddles closer to Harry. "Don't tell Ron."
"You're sure?"
"Well, yeah. But I love your rants, and I do want to hear why you're full of rage about infant ambulation charms. I mean, beyond the fact that they've been proven to be bad for kids' development and Healers have recommended against them since like the '90s."
"It's the shirt, isn't it?" Malfoy asks. Harry turns around to find Malfoy looking down appraisingly at himself. "You can't keep your hands off me in this shirt."
Every time someone (Padma, Justin, Luna) had tried to get Harry to go hang out or have a party or go drinking, he’d declined. He’d rather stay in his room with Ron and Hermione, or by himself. That wasn’t a crime, was it? It was so much effort to go out. So much that could go wrong. It wouldn’t be fun, anyway. It’d just be a lot of chatter about meaningless nonsense that made Harry itchy with how that kind of conversation seemed so trite to him now. He couldn’t pretend the war hadn’t happened. He didn’t want to pretend, and he didn’t
Draco had closed his eyes, his lips twitching up in amusement. "He's your son, Potter," he whispered with relish as he gestured towards the Floo.
Draco looked up at Harry, his face resting on his hand, fingers mussing his hair. He was a study in weariness.
As soon as he was gone, Harry slumped against the counter. A moment later, a cup flew in front of him. He grabbed it out of the air, watching with a touch of wonder as the little wings transformed into a sleeve, and took a sip.
He stopped.
"Dad! Stop making eyes at your husband and come on!"
Harry snapped a quick photo on his mobile and sent it to Ron and Hermione with the comment,
“Not long.”
As Harry waited for his vanilla latte, he thought about Malfoy, wandering around Gringotts, no one to talk to but a bunch of goblins, saddled with extra work while Bill was on parental leave.
lose his self control just because he had the hots for Harry Potter. Draco was no longer a horny teenager. He would not be party to Harry Potter's continued martyrdom.
to think about that, so he tries not to. He just has to hope against all hope that Ginny won't find out that Harry sucked Draco Malfoy's cock just a few days after she aborted their baby.
Harry saw a queue up ahead. Though the queue stayed orderly, the waiting people all looked antsy. Some of them were checking their magic-powered mobiles, others were reading the
“Let’s just brew, okay?” Harry said.
Harry turned to face him, wrapping arms around Draco's waist and squeezing. "Hi."
They hadn’t yet managed to get off the floor. They were red in the face, short of breath, and rumpled.
"And what if I have nowhere to go?!" I ask.
Draco frowns. "Ah, I suppose we could just agree that—it's not casual?"
Harry made to turn away, but Draco grabbed Harry's wrist. "Seriously, it's fine. It's probably smart. Only a matter of time until one of the kids pops in when we're not around and accidentally stumbles upon the fact that you live upstairs."
Harry's face crinkled with displeasure.
Harry blinked. The number of times he'd seen Draco this rambly-upset were few and far between. Maybe the time Scorpius hadn't been invited to one of his and Albus's mate's birthday parties because he was a Malfoy.
to. So stop pretending like that was all you, please."
“The what?” Harry said.
Potter’s laughter escapes. “You’re sitting here, unable to stop hiccoughing, and you’re allergic to an entire group of plants, and I’m just imagining you sitting inside your big manor house as a kid, hiccoughing and sneezing, and your mother telling you to stay inside because the outside world is too dangerous and your constitution too fragile.” Harry pauses. “Which, to be clear, is funny because that is very much
Neither of them mentioned that Malfoy could never work at the Aurors because the Aurors would never have him.
which he was sure would've gone down poorly. He couldn't remember for the life of him what Rump actually called those things.
After pulling on a t-shirt, he ran downstairs. "What's wrong?"
There was an odd, strangled noise. Draco and Harry looked around, confused for a moment until they realised that Aster was covering Wilhelm's face with her fist. Harry persuaded her to relinquish Wilhelm's head, and Wilhelm said, sotto voce, "It's very serious in there. No idea what they're up to. Haven't heard
Malfoy turned to look. A group of otherworldly-gorgeous women sat around a table with a pot of tea, the tables around them all conspicuously empty. "We can sit there."
to slapstick duel you," Harry replied honestly. If they were ever short of cash, they could probably charge a small fortune for tickets to that.
Draco cracked his eyes open. "I suppose you'll tell me it's not a relationship, if there's not love. That sounds very on-brand for you. But then I have a follow-up: what's 'love'? No, really—try to define it. If we have combined our households, spend time together, jointly engage in family activities, work together on important issues, eat together, et cetera, what about that isn't
He stops laughing and looks at me with something that might be concern.
"What are you talking about?"
Malfoy doesn't even blink at Harry's outburst, he merely looks around, assessing. "The problem is, one doesn't want to wait in these queues without being certain it's a good game."
Malfoy rolls his eyes as he drops the bag from the thrift shop onto the sofa. "I never said
“Interesting you should bring that up, Harry.” Hermione crossed her arms. “The code’s exact stipulation is that
He follows her into the club, blinking at the loud music and flashing lights as they head to the bar. "Should we have invited Ron?" Harry asks, yelling over the music.
Draco nodded. "No idea if it would work, but it might."
In this quagmire of personal and political despondence, Harry attempted to concentrate on the sounds of nature, to look at the clouds drifting across his ceiling. He was fairly certain he'd succeeded at calming himself down a bit, but then he heard his phone buzz and his heart rate quickly returned to previous levels.
Harry instinctively pulled the duvet toward his chin.
Harry quelled a smile. "Sorry, it's just. Nevermind. I gave a sex talk to James. I gave
Jorgen nodded. "Will do, sir."
Draco walked in wearing a slim dress shirt and a pair of elegant trousers. He looked markedly more Muggle than usual—he often wore Muggle clothes for work, but at home he usually wore casual robes.
Penelope held up a hand. “This is not group therapy. If you two need counselling to work through your relationship issues, it’ll have to happen at a separate time.”
“The most efficacious non-potion remedy for intractable hiccoughs is digital rectal massage.”
his sense of humor was intact. Yes, it was hilarious that Teddy was just now discovering books of queer theory that Harry had been gifted by Hermione over three decades ago and yet if you listened to Teddy it was like he'd made a novel discovery, like his generation had a monopoly on insight. Yes, Nico was pretentious in a very hipster manner, even as he seemed well-matched to Lily. Yes, James loudly discussing the intricacies of his "castle aesthetic" was outrageous, if simultaneously endearing. Yes, Scorpius's anxiety about the baby was completely detached from reality and yet also understandable.
He took two long strides and found himself on the side of a bed. Albus and Scorpius sat cross-legged on the bed, their shoes still on, facing each other, heads bowed together, knees touching. They held between them a tiny bundle of blankets, and Harry had to shift to the side to see the baby's face—scrunched, red, perfect.
She looks up, surprised yet unimpressed.
Albus closed his eyes.
"He said he'd come when they close the shop," Hermione replies, rummaging through drawers. "What do you two feel like for takeaway? I could eat kebab. Or pizza."
," Lily said. "Just some nice words you said to me, for some reason, even though you didn't believe it."
“Good, because I really shouldn’t wear them anymore. I don’t want people to think I’m like, faking it for a laugh, or for attention. That would be offensive.”
He lived here now. He lived here now with Draco Malfoy. This was fine.
, haven't they?"
The zoo was good people watching, Harry decided, as they walked. Muggles were as interesting a group as wizards, really. Especially the children. He saw one little girl who kept grabbing the hem of her dress and tucking it into the neck, leaving her belly and nappy exposed while her parents tried fruitlessly to get her to leave it.
Harry was jolted out of his stupor by Draco snapping his fingers. “My eyes are up here, you neanderthal.”
“It was Friday,” Harry insists. “I met you after the first block to walk to lunch and you were hiccoughing the entire walk down.”
"He wants you to argue the case for the Magical Civil Liberties Union?"
She doesn't answer, and Harry eventually tears his eyes away from trying to find non-existent constellations on the ceiling. He wrinkles his nose in confusion; Ginny is poking one of her tits. "Um, Gin?"
The clock ticked as Draco waited for Harry to respond. He looked like he was restraining himself from talking, trying to give Harry some space.
I have no idea what a game show is, but I agree with his sentiment. I sigh. "Look, you're not allowed to mock me. I don't think this will work, but I feel like I need to try."
"Wombs," Harry mused, failing to elaborate.
"They are not. If anything, they have a big responsibility to
"Mr Potter!" a voice cried, and he saw the pink flash of a Press ID badge. "Mr Potter, would you like to make a statement about your outfit? About your position on the R.O.B.E.S. Order?"
Draco snorted inelegantly, rubbed his forehead with the back of his hand. "Sure. I'll be happy to squeeze you in, Mr Potter."
"I don't need to
"My new therapist told me about this program they have at the Muggle Liaison Office that works with Muggle-borns to help them connect with their Muggle family. It's not perfect, but they have a gentle spell, similar to a Confundus, that adjusts their thinking about anything magical. Like, if I showed them a moving picture, they'd see it as still. They also told me that, if I have no parents and no siblings, I can consider making my aunt my next of kin, in order to make it permissible by the Statute to tell her about the magical world."
"This is too easy," Draco said. "Everyone knows Harry stays up all night long on the Twitter."
again, but he kept his mouth shut.
"Legally I can only talk about my personal life," Harry said. "As it happens, my personal life is quite political."
So what were they hashing out, anyway? "I guess we just need to agree that, if this changes, we'll discuss it. When it, er, comes up."
"Er, you said," Harry replied. "Congratulations? But like, how? Why?"
The bell on the door chimes as another early riser comes in. Harry glances up, expecting to see an old person, or a businessperson or someone like that. But it's Draco fucking Malfoy.
. He'd have to overlook the full stops.
“What’d Malfoy have to say?” Ron asked. “Did you imagine throttling each other?”
ing, but then pushes Harry away by the shoulders. "What's wrong?"
. I'm so fucking tired of decisions. When the war is over, I'm putting a moratorium on decisions. No choices. No life-or-death. No thinking, just acting.
"Not true, is it?" Ron added.
Draco's face reddened. "Personal…genital business."
tea cups, they have cheap, comic-adorned mugs. "Have a cup of tea, love. I brought Hermione this old tea set that belonged to my parents, her grandparents. It was sitting in the cupboard, unused, so I figured I should bring it, let it serve the next generation, right? No sense having things if you don't use them, I say."
Harry sighs and holds up his hands. "I'm not! I really don't know. The Muggles I lived with didn't let me do anything, and I spent most of the last decade at Hogwarts being chased by Voldemort. Sorry if I can't tell you exactly which video game to play, fucking
“We’ll be officially breaking the code this time,” Hermione said, tapping her finger on the table. “No more loopholes.”
Ron sighs, as if he's the victim of an enormous injustice, but turns and Floos home.
Draco tried to ignore his racing heart; he pursed his lips and went rummaging in a cabinet for the dried cherries, which hadn't responded to his Accio. Offerings of stuff! Was that the only way he showed affection to the kids? He knocked his elbow into the shelf.
"No!" Harry says, hurriedly forking a large bite into his mouth. "The chicken is delicious!"
“That’s kinda ominous, isn’t it?” Harry asked.
Harry flushed. It was, kind of. Even if he hadn't actually wanted to sleep with him. "Sure."
Harry had been going to say "real." He deflated a bit—not that he disagreed with Draco, mind. He huffed a laugh. "Yeah, it was good. But I meant that we're—we're not—it's—"
Harry gapes. He is living! He's doing his best, isn't he? He's allowed to care about the thing with Ginny and the baby. He's allowed to care about having lost nearly everyone in the world he ever cared about.
Malfoy stood taller, glancing only for the slightest second at the goblin before turning his attention back to Harry. "It's green chia kombucha."
Aster giggled.
Draco closed his eyes, exhaling slowly.
Harry tries to remember what had started their loud discussion. "He forced me to talk about my feelings."
"Can't you give her something?" Albus asked from the seat next to Harry.
"Can we stop at the bookstore before we go back?" Draco asked, wincing as one of the boys fell and slid down the ramp on his bottom. "I know you wanted to look for that book on charming wood."
"It's
If Hermione were there she would’ve said, “The war didn’t end. Harry ended it,” because she didn’t like the way people were already talking about it as if it had been an inevitability. But Malfoy’s words felt true to Harry. The war ended, and here they were.
"Who is she?!" Teddy repeated, laughing delightedly. He turned to the rest of the table. "James uses the cloak to show off to the ladies."
"Yes. Biology. Except you should qualify your language to account for asexuals. Ace erasure isn't done anymore." Draco's cheeks were red. "But, yes, in our case, biology. Nothing to get worked up over."
"Your kids. Your dashing new lover. Quidditch."
And you—"
, sort of?
). Really, it's Harry's fault, isn’t it? If anyone's to blame here. But how can he feel responsible when he wasn't even there with her? He—
I turn, incredulous, and smile at him. I can't help it. I'm not being safe. I'm not protecting myself. I'm smiling. "It worked."
“Can you believe,” Draco hissed, “they’re trying to
"Right," Harry said, and sighed. "Fine. But if I fall in love with someone, we're cutting it off. No questions asked."
After the war, he'd sold Grimmauld Place. He hadn't much cared what happened to it so long as it was no longer
"I'm starving," Draco says, opening the fridge.
"In this family," James declared, "stepdads are included in overly sentimental hugs." Draco let himself be pulled into it.
A tear rolls down Harry's cheek. Draco has the courtesy to look away.
Harry hears and feels the bed squeak as Draco rolls onto his side towards Harry. "That's exactly why it's important that people only have babies they want, yeah? Because then they won't lock them under the stairs? Because then they'll all be wanted." Draco rests his hand on Harry's stomach.
you wooing me? Because you told me I would know, and I have to say, I'm not yet certain. I have an inkling, but there remains a shadow of a doubt."
"I grew up with my aunt and uncle. They locked me under the stairs. They told me every day how much they wished I wasn't there. They literally said to me, every day, that they wished I didn't exist. I just—it's a big deal, to make the decision not to want another human."

think?"
"No way in hell." Malfoy leans on the wall next to Harry, in the spot Neville vacated. "But I'm not going to judge if you want to try it. It's very highly valued."
didn't break up with
“We tried not to sign it,” Hermione said, “but Robards said we had no choice. All Ministry employees need to accept the new Code of Conduct.”
Ginny is puking, and Harry doesn't want to hold back her hair.
Harry groans, letting his head fall dramatically between his knees.
"What?!" he says, all defensive. "I'm not done!"
Hermione lets loose a manic cackle. "So what you're saying is that Malfoy made some bad decisions in the war, decisions he couldn't easily take back, even though when the time came he did what he could to save Harry?"
"That's a good question," Draco said. "I wonder if we could use that lack of clarity as a challenge to delay the law, arguing that they need to add in those contingencies. I'd do it, but I don't think I'm the best person. I don't want to be on record as trying to make this law 'better,' since I oppose it entirely."
“No way!” Harry says. “How?”
“Very well.” She places Draco’s medical record on the table. “Digital rectal massage.”
“I am not
Draco opened his mouth to respond, but Harry answered first.
"Potter—" Malfoy starts, looking hungrily at Harry's lips, and Harry decides he doesn't want to hear what Malfoy's going to say. He lunges forward, grabbing Malfoy's bony shoulders and pressing their lips together. He pulls back almost immediately, wanting to look at Malfoy's face, to see his reaction—but Malfoy, bringing their lips together again, doesn't give him a chance. They're properly snogging now, on the dance floor, and the girl in the Ramones t-shirt seems to be cheering them on, but Harry can barely register anything except the heat of Malfoy's mouth, the way the prat's pointy fucking fingers are digging into his hips, a maddening slide of posh tongue.
, about
They stared at each other. Draco didn't want to be the first to ask something, not with them both hopped up on truth serum. He knew himself—he had no self control around Harry. He'd end up asking something completely irrelevant and inappropriate, just because he could. And the truth serum had not been his idea! Let Harry be the one to talk first.
A minute later, Ginny jogs down the stairs, slowing when she sees Harry. "Oh. Hi."
"That depends what you've heard," Harry sighed. "That Rump outlawed 'non-Western robes' in the Ministry and is trying to expand the rule to all magical places? True. That he used actual racial epithets in his speech announcing it? True. That his underlings are telling the press that Rump has his sights set on outlawing Muggle clothing next? True."
Draco rolled his eyes and sighed. "I'm not—I—argh!" He walked over to Harry's bed and flopped dramatically onto it, looking up at the ceiling. "I don't like the idea of there being a financial incentive for businesses to refuse to hire Slytherins or kids of Death Eaters. You know I don't give a shit about the actual Death Eaters. If they haven't done the fucking work to redeem themselves, fuck them and the broom they rode in on."
Harry laughed. "Goes with the territory."
"Good idea," Draco said, head bent over the paper. "Lorraine can get magi-linguistic books from the Manor's library, if she needs."
She shrugged, smiling. "Friends help each other move. It's like the first line on the friend contract." She pulled away and looked around. "It's so empty."
Harry leans forward, wrapping her in a hug, and they're both crying. "In another life," he says, "it would've been a fantastic person. We would've been an incredible family."
The smile vanished from his face as he walked out of the public area and into the lifts corridor. He leaned against the side of the lift to give his heart a chance to calm down, relishing the quiet and the vaguely disdainful looks he was getting from a witch in traditional robes.
"Whether it was good. And it was. The sex was good." Draco's face flashed a cross between attempted sexiness and attempted escape.
"As a point of fact, I would say Harry
Draco scoffed. "Of course not."
“Accomplice to murder, in that he provided safe passage for those known as Death Eaters into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Attempted murder, in that he willfully and with premeditation planned to kill Albus Dumbledore. Assault, in that he harmed both Ronald Weasley and Katie Bell in the course of his attempted murder.”
Relieved, Harry smiled. "True. The only reason this whole thing works is because we antagonise each other, right?"
Harry hums into Draco's neck. "She was pretty pissed off, but."
discussed it with a Mindhealer for most of the twenty-teens. "Don't take me up on it, then. No one's forcing you."
Harry scowled. Draco wasn't going to say anything about it, but the scowl made the whole thing impossibly more adorable. "It's not adorable to make sure you're being a fair-minded parent. To make sure you're not unintentionally punishing your children who aren't following society's prescribed path."
During Draco and Hermione’s last campaign, Harry’d had a dream where Draco was in his bed telling Harry they needed to have sex to stop global oppression.
“Comfort can come from things other than just places, too, Harry,” Penelope said kindly. “People, hobbies, stuff like that. Think about that?”
Harry's addled brain thinks maybe he shouldn't be comparing this kiss to past kisses with Ginny, but he can't help it. He and Ginny used to kiss like this, more or less. Back in sixth year, when they were each other's bright spots in a bad year. Their recent kisses weren't like this. After the war, they'd been kissing like desperation, but not like desperation of
She says nothing, which is unlike her. She just walks, apparently content to let Harry have the full brunt of the awkwardness.
“Fromage?” Draco ventured.
Eh, he'd do it. It was only sex—bodies, penises, ani, friction. Bada bing, bada boom. After a few decades of parenthood, most bodily functions had lost their mystique.
want to protect small businesses. This isn't about Scorpius. It wouldn't take much for you to support the bill, Harry—all I'm asking you to do is—"
Harry closed his eyes, letting out a huge exhale. "I spent my
After she was out of sight, Harry turned to Draco. “I’m just glad I don’t have to be on that committee.”
"To my dead parents?"
As they near the top of the rocket escalator, Malfoy turns, his face a rictus of horror. Harry springs into action, pushing past Malfoy so he's a few steps ahead just as it reaches the top, and he models how to step off. Merlin, the last thing Harry needs is someone to hit the emergency stop on the escalator because a posh wizard has no Muggle skills!
“The new dress code in the Code of Conduct has been revoked, and new changes to the code will be considered in committee.”
Harry's heard her say that dozens of times over the years, to various brothers who've pissed her off. To Ron after he told Molly she was dating Dean. To Fred after he turned her favourite jumper into a rat and couldn't change it back. To Percy, after the war.
regret it?"
Harry poured the milk potion into a bottle and hit it with a warming charm. He tested the temperature with a mumbled, "
Parvati turned to him, her face showing a bit of surprise at his question. “I cried.”
“I didn’t.” Draco turns to glare at Harry. “We were supposed to be on our way to Hogsmeade, and Potter told me he needed to stop by the Hospital Wing to drop something off. He
Harry turns and looks at him. "She didn't do anything! But yeah, she is, isn't she?" He grins. "I love her."
He Vanishes all but two letters.
For a long moment, Harry thought Wilhelm was somehow poking fun at Draco. It was terrible music. But no—it looked like Wil was earnestly attempting to supply dancing music. The music, though, was absolutely unsuited to dancing, even if Draco had been serious.
"That's enough of that talk, Albus," Draco said, his voice sharp. "She
Harry bursts out laughing. "Alright, then—you're in charge of pudding. Do you know what you need?"
"What?!" Harry's heart was beating hard enough to feel each thump.
Draco rubs his hands up and down Harry's upper arms. "You're okay. What do you see?"
Harry closed his eyes for a moment, for strength. "I'm not a martyr. I'm a human being who knows what he wants, and what he wants doesn't include sex with awkward, star-struck strangers. Sex isn't all that important to me when I'm single. And we already decided that if I somehow fall in love with someone, this whole thing is off anyway. So it's irrelevant."
. I figured the most revolutionary thing I could do when faced with Rump's nonsense was to stay sober for it."
"Both, maybe," he said.
Harry shrugged. "Happy Christmas."
Harry laughed even harder. "Malfoy.
Malfoy gapes at him, seeming as shocked as Harry is. "Funny. I'll remind you that this is the first time I've run into
Harry didn't interrupt his silence. Eventually, Draco sat up, meeting Harry's eyes. "I hate you." He picked up the bottle and tipped a generous dose onto his tongue.
"Can't believe I am one of only 2% of cis wizards," Harry mused.
