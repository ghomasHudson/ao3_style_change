Harry considered this. “Yes and no. I did notice my trousers haven’t been fitting very well.”
“Are you fond of cheesecake?” Draco said. “I have a recipe I’ve been meaning to try.”
“Not at all,” Draco said. “And that’s only the first piece. I’m working on that hypnotic painting next. So, no pressure, naturally, but if you’d like to start re-doing Grimauld place, I’m happy to consult.”
“Stone is so much more evocative than pound, don’t you think?” Pansy said, leaning a head on her hand and gazing at Harry. “You look like you’re carrying stones in there, not pounds.”
Draco could see that he was. His belly looked swollen beneath the thin jumper, rounder than when they’d sat down. “There’s still half this curry left,” Draco said. “Here, let me.” He poured the remaining curry over the rice and offered Potter his own spoon.
Soon enough they were tucked in bed, Harry on his side in nothing but a pair of new, roomy boxers, Draco big-spooning him and reaching over with one long strong arm to rub his belly. It was mounded up faithfully beside him, taking up so much space that Harry felt another flicker of the alarm he’d felt over dinner.
“Then stop stalling, and eat,” Draco said. “You’re nearly halfway through that bowl. You won’t let Weasley win, will you?”
Distantly he could feel Ron thumping him on the back, and he turned to hug him next, surprised to remember how tall his friend was, taller even than Draco. “Will the baby be tall, do you think?” he said. His brain still wasn’t working at full capacity.
“That, too.”
Narcissa, seventy years old, silver haired, perfumed to within an inch of her teeth and glittering with jewels, presented her cheek to be kissed. “Hello Draco, darling.”
“Do tell,” Narcissa said, shifting her attention. She adored a good story about bad service.
“Go on, tell him what you want,” Harry said, looking amused. “If he can get it, we can have it.”
Harry blinked owlishly behind his glasses. “Excuse me?”
“Oh god,” Pansy gasped. “Oh fuck, oh god, oh god I’m gonna –”
“I think Ron’s right, though,” Harry said, looking down at himself.
“I myself cannot ‘ave it,” she said sadly. “Too many calories! This weight, it suits you, but not me.”
“Apparently,” she said.
“Well,” Harry said. “Realistically – what should I wear?”
“Merlin, yes,” Harry said. “And I can’t lie on my front anymore, so I can’t even get Draco to rub it for me.”
Pansy began kissing her way back up his belly, pausing to suck on the soft flesh below his navel. “One last plate,” she said. “Then I’ll take my top off.”
“Do you want to stop?” Draco said. “I would if you wanted to.”
“Oh, how indeed,” snorted the mirror. “Might have something to do with the cake you took to bed with you last night, hmm?”
“Don’t touch the hair!” Pansy shrieked, and Draco yanked his hand away. It had been going, by instinct, to thread itself through Harry’s black waves. “Christ,” Pansy complained. “I haven’t been laid in a month, could you kindly refrain from kissing each other like that? Unless you follow it up by proposing a threesome. Which I’d say yes to, by the way. If it were on offer.”
“Draco,” Harry said. “I’m getting fat. Properly.”
“I’ve got to stop,” Potter said, “gotta stop eating like, like this. Fuck, I’m, I’m packed.”
“Clearly, I have not.”
“I know,” Harry sighed. He shifted in his chair. “I’m starting to notice it, myself. Feeling a bit heavy.”
In answer there was a foreboding clatter. Then Pansy yelled, “This lasagna’s hot, should we feed it to him and then see what happens?”
“Looks like four more bites, go on. Beautiful, darling. Yes. One more. That’s it. Well done, my good boy.”
“Enjoying those?” Malfoy murmured.
“A million galleons,” Harry laughed. “Go on.”
“Let’s get you sat down so you can stuff yourself on appetizers in peace,” Ron said, leading them to the couch. Harry reached out to steady himself on the sofa’s arm before lowering himself carefully down, trying not to simply fall back with a thud as he’d gotten accustomed to. He arched his back, letting his belly settle more comfortably atop his thighs, wincing a bit as he tucked a finger in his tightening waistband and tried to give himself more room. Too late he realized that the button-up flannel he’d worn was getting snug and the buttons strained around his mound of stomach when he sat, showing slices of the white t-shirt beneath it.
“Does your back hurt, ever?” she asked, putting her hands on her lower back. “Right here?”
“What is this?” Potter said doubtfully, though he immediately poked a finger into the whipped cream and licked it off. Draco found he had to look away from this sight.
“You’re making this so awkward,” Hermione scolded.
Harry nodded grimly. He put one hand on the table and the other on the side of his belly and slowly, carefully, began to hoist himself out of the chair, belly-first. He felt like he’d gained a stone just over dinner. When he’d gotten himself upright he then had to submit to being kissed and hugged and belly-patted goodbye by everyone, Fleur caressing his round side, Ron giving him a firm poke, Ginny drunkenly resting her hand on the swollen push beneath his pecs. It was not unpleasant, necessarily, but he was glad when Draco had steered him firmly to the floo and nudged him in.
Draco’s first few weeks at the Ministry were without incident. It was very odd, to be working in such an official capacity after so many years of freelance work, of taking whatever jobs he could find. After his father had died in prison, he and his mother had begun painstakingly cataloguing and selling off the contents of Malfoy Manor, a years-long process that had not only amassed them a certain amount of liquid wealth, but also accidentally made Draco into something of an expert on removing ancient curses. It had turned out that the majority of the Malfoy’s heirlooms were not only very old and very expensive, but also very hexed to react poorly to any non-Malfoy – not ideal, obviously, for selling off. After five years spent breaking centuries-old curses on vases, wardrobes, spoons and more under his mother’s highly critical eye, Draco had decided it was time to leave the nest, and bought a flat in London. He was surprised to find that he’d gotten something of a reputation for the man to see in ancient cursework, and the jobs had come thick and fast. Still, it had been a bit of a shock when the Ministry had reached out.
“Coming right up,” Ginny said.
“Water,” Draco said. “Which you could probably use, too. And maybe – a firewhisky?”
“You approve?” Harry said with some amusement. De la Cruz was married to a Cursebreaker and considered herself something of an expert in their office culture.
Emboldened, he crept into the breakroom the following day and made himself a cappuccino, and again, saw no one but Sheila and Giggy, drinking lattes.
“Is he a better cook than me?” Ron demanded.
It was the way Ron looked at Hermione.
Harry considered. “Finish.”
“I’m going to burst,” Potter said, wincing as he began to eat the curry. He took a long swig of beer, belched, kept eating.
“A piece or two?” Pansy said. “Don’t hold back on my account, I’ve already watched you eat a whole cake. And what’s more, I enjoyed it.”
With dawning horror, Harry realized that they were going to get along. He hadn’t fully accounted for this possibility. As if reading his mind, Ginny smiled wickedly and said, “So, does he still do that little screamy thing when you bite his –”
“No,” Harry said sharply. “I’m inviting you to my best friend’s house for dinner.”
“What’s baked brie?” Harry said, looking interested.
Draco drew in a sharp breath and was silent for a long time. Then he said, “Is this news to you?”
“Barely!”
“But it’s a good hurt, right?” Draco said, suddenly worried. “You like it?”
“Yes sir.”
Flustered and thrilled, Harry jammed another pumpkin bar into his mouth.
“I’ll have the green curry with tofu,” Draco said. “He will have the fried egg rolls, the fried golden chicken and the beef satay as an appetizer, and then the pad thai with duck. And…” He flicked his eyes through the menu. “The massaman curry with chicken.”
Draco turned to raise an eyebrow at him. “Well, that’s why you’ve got to let me have a go at those rooms you’re scared to enter. I could sell of a million galleons worth of antiques easily, once I’ve taken the murder out of them.”
“Look, I don’t mind having dinner with your mum. I mean, I’ll be honest, there’s no love lost between us, but I’d have said that about you a year ago, and now look at us.” Harry rested a hand on his belly. “I’m not going to the Manor, though.”
Draco huffed a laugh, breath soft against the back of his neck. “I fancy it very, very much.” He squeezed Harry’s hip. “But I think the more important question is, do you fancy it?”
“Don’t worry,” Wendy put in, poised at his side to take notes. “They’re great friends.”
“I know,” Ron said, suddenly sounding very sober. “It’s mental, isn’t it? After everything. Oh, come on, don’t cry again.”
“I thought I… was getting… a paunch? I honestly don’t know.”
Harry sighed and ran a hand through his hair. “Still can’t quite believe this is all me,” he said. He jostled the belly in his shrinking lap. “I got out of breath climbing seven stairs today.”
Harry plucked at the green wool. “Hermione gave it to me. Says it brings out my eyes or some nonsense.”
“I don’t know how you can compare our experience,” Draco said stiffly.
“Malfoy?” Potter said, sounding just as shocked to see Draco as Draco was to see him.
“Draco Malfoy,” Ginny breathed. “You always did have a thing for him, you must be over the moon.”
Harry gave him wide, pleading eyes. “But it’s spooky.”
Harry didn’t answer, too busy gasping as Pansy began nibbling along his jawline.
In the dining room, Hermione managed to skooch her chair closer to the table than Harry, whose belly was mounded about a foot in front of him and blocked his access unless he spread his legs wide, and even then he had to lean over it to reach his plate.
“I’d heard something about that,” Draco said, grinning.
“It’s not just you,” Draco said.
“I want you to stay over my place. Next week.”
“I don’t want to be outdone by Draco sodding Malfoy!” Ron said. “Anyway, I’m curious to see if you can get down a whole shepherd’s pie in one sitting.”
Surprised, Draco glanced to the timid-looking young witch at his elbow. He was technically part of the Cursebreaker’s team and she, apparently, was their collective intern, barely out of Hogwarts. He’d forgotten she was there. “Yes,” he said. “Coffee.”
“Because I’m relatively certain he doesn’t eat dinner,” Draco said.
Harry and Draco glanced at each other speculatively, but the floo began to sputter before any conclusions could be reached. Harry got laboriously to his feet while Pansy whisked the evidence of cake away, and then they hung back as Draco stood before the floo and waited to greet his mother.
“Well then,” Draco said. “I guess you’ll be eating more than enough for four.”
Harry belched in response.
“Harry,” Arthur said, “Draco,” shaking both their hands very vigorously. “Have you heard the news?”
“How does that belly feel, by the way?” Draco said, pressing his fingers into it experimentally. “You’ve finished off most of this brie and you’re not even tightening up yet.”
It came up again, of course, when dessert was dished out, Ron piling so much sticky toffee pudding onto Harry’s plate that even Hermione started laughing.
Harry gave him a look so soft and sympathetic that Draco looked away. But aloud he only said, “Fine.”
Draco nearly choked on his own beer.
“She’ll probably show up loaded, herself. Not exactly a teetotaler, my mum.”
“I do,” Malfoy said. “Thai sounds fine.”
Draco kissed his neck and pushed another bite between his lips. “What’ll your house elf make us next week?”
The truth was, Draco knew his apartment was in fact quite beautiful. Space was important to him, it always had been, and he liked lovely objects, liked nice things. It was gratifying to see Potter momentarily forget his physical discomfort and go wide-eyed.
“Another stone,” he decided, and tore off a piece of the bread, loading it up with hot, melty cheese.
“Tight,” Harry said, yawning. “Achy.”
“You’ve gotten bigger since just last week,” Draco said. “Did you know that?”
He swallowed the last bite of pasta and sat back with a groan. Draco was talking intently with Fleur about Merlin knew what, and for a while he just sat there, bathed in the chatter of his loved ones, floating on the pain in his belly and the haze from the beer, one hand rubbing the fullest part of his belly, which was stretched and aching. The straining button-up didn’t help. He met Ginny’s sympathetic eye and gave a helpless little smile.
“What are you –” Potter looked around him, as if expecting to see Crabbe and Goyle. “What are you doing here?”
His jaw dropped. Malfoy’s office was small, tiny even, but it was one of the loveliest spaces he’d been in in the Ministry, which was overall drab, dull and functional. This room was bright, full but not overcluttered, all soft wood and glimmering glass and rich, velvety colors. Malfoy sat behind his desk looking posed there, as if arranged to enhance the beauty of the tableau, so tall and golden and upright in the midmorning sun, his brow creased at the papers on his desk and then smoothing out a bit when he saw Harry, almost as if he were glad to see him. A second later he was frowning again.
“You are nearly finished! I will get you more.”
“Hey,” Harry said. “I’m likeable aside from… that. I did save your life, you know.”
They were both fully clothed, though Harry’s t-shirt was rucked up around his chest to give Draco access to the belly that had grown out of another pair of overstretched trousers in the past month. There were angry pink stretchmarks spidered around his navel and striping up his sides, and his pecs in Draco’s palms were meatier, nipples peakier. Draco slipped a hand under Harry’s shirt now and cupped one of these pudgy pegs, thumb swiping over the nipple.
“Well,” Harry said, feeling slightly stunned. “I guess I got huge, too.”
Harry nodded, his mouth too full of lasagna to talk.
“Go on,” Draco coaxed. “A few more bites. There we go. Two more. Yes, Potter, excellent!”
“Ah,” Harry sighed dramatically. “Love.”
He’d had to hang back from a series of planned interviews with suspects that afternoon, too full to go anywhere; had instead locked the door of his office and popped the button on his jeans, thinking maybe he should start wearing robes to work, if he planned to eat like this at every meal.
“Fine,” Draco said crisply. He held out the freshly-made cup of heavily-sugared coffee and after a second Potter took it. He’d added another scar to match the one on his forehead, Draco saw, this one a fine white line cutting through his lower lip, and Draco watched as he licked coffee from it.
“Good,” Draco murmured. “Almost there.”
Harry debated telling Ron he’d already eaten a pie that day, but decided against it. Instead he put a cautious hand on his belly and said, “To be honest, I think I can.”
“While I’m up here, let’s take this off,” Harry said, and pushed Draco’s shirt off, his big belly nudging up against Draco’s flat torso. Draco reached down and held onto the domelike underside, hefting its considerable weight in his hands as he kissed Harry deeply. Pansy came up behind Harr, running her hands down his broad shoulders appreciatively and squeezing the thick spare tire that now encircled his waist, a crease of fat that went around his back.
It was very rare for Draco Malfoy to be caught off guard. But right then, he was. He felt blindsided by the compliment, by the sincere way it was given as well as its contents. Potter, he saw, meant every word. He could feel himself growing red and scowled against it. A Malfoy did not blush like a schoolgirl just because a handsome boy had called him beautiful.
“Stop.”
He was pleased to find Potter in the breakroom the next day, and even more pleased when he saw Potter’s eyes grow wide at the spread Draco’d brought him. He’d wrapped up an entire pan of five-cheese fettucini with a half a loaf of cheddar focaccia smeared with most of a stick of butter, plus a heavily-dressed walnut and bleu cheese salad – but that was nothing compared to dessert. Two heavy fudge brownies, two enormous sugar cookies, and a gigantic slice of lemon-iced pound cake.
“Yes,” Ron said, leering.
“What are you two lovebirds whispering about over there?” Ron said darkly.
“No,” Potter said, eyes wide. They really were a remarkable shade of green, like fresh grass. “I couldn’t take your lunch.”
“Draco sodding Malfoy?” Ron said.
“Honestly,” she said, turning wide eyes on him. “Would you come round and have a look at mine sometime, give me a bit of advice? Maybe if my office looked like this, I’d come closer to matching your stats.”
“He might have a piece or two,” Harry said with dignity.
“I’m leaving early today anyway,” Draco said, which was perfectly true. He was picking up his mother at the Manor and taking her to an appointment at St. Mungo’s; her arthritis had been bothering her. “I’ll eat as soon as I’m out.”
“Yes,” Potter agreed. “I bloody well have.”
Harry let out a heavy sigh. “You know I did. God, I can’t remember the last time I wasn’t so full it hurt.”
“Would you mind showing me again how to make espresso?”
“Thank you for having me,” Draco said somewhat stiffly, but Harry saw how pleased he was.
“What about your sides?” Harry asked, rubbing the tender skin of his waist and ribcage. “I get achy right here, from carrying all this extra weight.”
“Yes?”
Potter was already twirling a forkful of noodles. “Good thing I’ve got practice.”
Never in his life had Harry actually felt like what every called him: the Chosen One. Never, until now, chosen by Draco sodding Malfoy, of all people.
“How does it feel?” Harry said. “When you’re surprised like that?”
“Grand,” Harry panted.
Draco was laughing so much tears were streaming down his cheeks, and at his side Harry was gripping his belly, laughing helplessly and saying, “Oh god, that hurts, stop –"
Malfoy inclined his head, cool as ever. “I’m free tomorrow.”
Harry pretended to check his notes, as if he didn’t know very well. “Draco Malfoy.”
“It’s a wheel of cheese,” Draco said, stalking over to him. “Baked in a pastry crust.”
Harry said, very calmly, “The last time I was at the Manor, several of my friends were tortured.”
Harry felt obscurely cheered by this. Two stone was a lot. He might easily plateau before then, mightn’t he?
“Nonsense!” Molly said, so affronted that Draco managed to smile even through the slightly strangled look he was giving Harry. “Here, I’ll make you a plate.”
“Taste, Potter,” Malfoy drawled. “A foreign concept to you, I’m sure. Have a seat.”
Afterwards Draco, draped across Harry’s desk now, said, “Oh! I forgot to tell you. You’re rich.”
“I’m up another stone,” Harry said around a mouthful. “And then some. That’s forty-six pounds, American, by the way. More math skills for you.”
“Of course you do,” Pansy smirked. “Probably get yourself off to it after Harry goes to work.”
“Yes, but the Weasleys won’t fuck me senseless later,” Harry said, and had the pleasure of watching Draco choke on his white wine.
“Hang on,” Ron said. “Are you two comparing symptoms? Because Harry, I hate to tell you, I think you might actually be a bit bigger than my eight months pregnant wife.”
“Because,” Harry said, grimacing slightly, “we’ve got an unsolved disappearance from a year ago, and the only evidence on the scene was a single rose.”
“Why the rush, darling?” Draco said. “Hungry?”
“You’ll probably put on more,” Draco said, leaning forward and letting his breath ghost Potter’s ear. “If you don’t learn some self-control.”
“Draco’s a very good cook,” Harry said neutrally.
“No, he isn’t joking,” Hermione giggled. “He doesn’t want to be outdone by your boyfriend!”
“Has no one offered you boys anything to drink?” she tutted. “What’ll it be?”
“What. Is. His. Name?”
Draco was on the couch, Harry tucked between his legs and leaning back against his chest, a pint of ice cream propped against his belly as he spooned it tiredly into his mouth. Draco stroked his firm stomach with one idle hand, admiring Pansy’s bare legs splayed across his nicest armchair.
“I think I’ve only just realized it.”
“You really are getting round,” Draco said, his tone sending shivers down Harry’s spine. He caressed Harry’s sides. “Keep eating like this and you’ll have quite the muffin top.” He gently bit the swell of hip that bowed out over Harry’s tight trousers, then dragged his tongue downwards. Harry filled his mouth with milkshake and Draco filled his mouth with Harry, both of them sucking, sucking, sucking, until Harry was choking and coming at the same time, gasping for breath, so full even as he was emptying himself down Draco’s throat. With the ebb of the intense pleasure came the after-effects of chugging that much ice cream, and he sighed as Draco patted his tortured gut.
“I’ll just leave this here,” he said, putting the sack on the table. “If you want to let it go to waste, well, that’s your business.”
“Takes one to know one,” Draco said snidely, and they stepped through.
Both things managed to somehow be true at once. The hair was the same, wavy black chaos, and the eyes were the same, big and green behind the same terrible glasses. The basic face was the same. But Potter… there was no other way to describe it… Potter had grown up. He looked like a man, not a boy. His shoulders were broader, and though he was still thin – too thin – there was something sturdy about him, too, as if his stubbornness had etched itself into every line of his body. His jawline, sharp and strong, was covered with dark stubble. He’d gotten… oh, gods damn it. He’d gotten hot.
“Hmm,” Draco said, tracing the curve of Harry’s tummy. “Honestly? Two, maybe three.”
Draco grinned wickedly. “Good. That drives me wild.”
“If you want me to fuck you,” Pansy purred from between his legs, “I’m gonna need you flat on a couch. Your belly’s too big in this chair.”
“What about this,” Ron said, leaning over and poking Harry’s belly. “Have you told her about this?”
“No, that’s all right, I --! Oh, dammit. That cake was disgusting.”
“You’d turn me on no matter what,” Draco said fiercely.
“Sorry,” Harry said, and tried to suppress his tears, only to hiccup loudly. “Ow,” he said, clapping a hand to his belly, and hiccupped again. “Ow. Ow.”
“Well, then I think you can manage one more serving.”
“Actually, most of that’s olive oil,” Draco said blandly, gesturing. “Except on the garlic bread.”
“By then, you probably won’t even need your hands to hold a plate,” Draco said.
“Surprises me sometimes, too,” Draco said.
“Goblin hex,” Potter said. “Couldn’t talk for a week.”
“Sounds good.”
Fleur, who’d somehow swapped seats with Draco and was now sitting beside him, fluttered her fingers over Harry’s stretched-out navel. “May I?” she said, then gave him a gentle caress that had Draco glaring over her shoulder.
Because they were in public, Draco did not lay a proprietary hand across his belly, as Harry knew he would’ve liked to do. Instead, he put a hand on Harry’s thigh and gave it a squeeze. “We ought to talk about this more in-depth later. Alone.”
Harry blew on a hot mouthful of shepherd’s pie. “Right.”
“Can’t believe how much weight I’ve stacked on,” Harry said. He hauled himself a bit further up the cushions so he could look down at himself, and Draco watched him trace the jut of swollen underbelly that crushed his waistband and threatened to settle in his lap. He’d eaten a little over half a pan of the lasagna and Draco could feel how full he was, could hear the strain of it in his voice, but he opened his mouth again when Draco raised the loaded fork.
“Oh, Merlin,” Harry groaned. He could already taste the flaky, buttery crust. “When are you going to let me take you out, for a change?”
“I’ll be honest,” Potter continued, “I had to call Hermione last week to help me with a stretching charm for my trousers.”
Ginny slung an arm around Harry’s shoulder and lay her hand over his belly. “You’re the father, I assume?”
“No,” he said, looking between his two best friends. “Hermione?”
“Will there still be cake by the time we come down?”
“Precious,” Emmaline agreed, exchanging a smile with Harry. “You look good, Harry.”
“What can I say,” Potter said, eyes slitted like a lazy cat beneath Draco’s ministrations. “Someone’s been feeding me too much.”
As he worked, he congratulated himself on his savvy business sense. Get on Potter’s good side, somehow, and he wouldn’t have to worry about office gossip anymore. For all the nasty things he could say about Potter – and there was plenty – he knew one thing for certain: the man protected his friends. Draco had only ever been on the other side of that fierce protectiveness – he’d always been the one Potter was protecting
“Nothing, nothing,” Hermione giggled. “All right, I’ll walk you through it. Take the trousers you’ve outgrown and –”
“We’re – old friends,” Harry corrected, though that was not true either. What did you call a former enemy, someone who’d been manipulated to kill the person you’d admired most in the world and now brought you extravagant lunches each day? Maybe friend was the right term. Had to be, considering Harry’d put himself on the case just to be close to him. Well, no, not close to him! Not close, it was only that Harry was curious about how Draco worked, and this was an excellent opportunity to make a connection and get to know a new member of the staff in their professional capacity. Yes, it had nothing to do with wanting to spend time with him and everything to do with Harry’s commitment to the aurors. Good to be clear on that.
Harry sat. “Merlin, this is a comfortable chair.”
Harry gaped at him. “Are you mad? Of course I want to re-do it. Merlin, you’ll have a fight on your hands with Kreacher, though.”
“Wendy said you needed to speak with me?” Harry said.
“Four o’clock,” Harry repeated, hand straying unconsciously to pat his aching belly. One by one they filed out of his office, and he locked the door behind them before collapsing into his chair and tucking his hands up his shirt, cradling the throb of two breakfasts too many. Why hadn’t he stopped at one plate? Especially on top of nearly an entire chocolate cake from the night before; especially on a morning when he’d had to charm his trousers just to get them buttoned. It was humiliating.
“Blimey, Harry, this place looks amazing,” Ron said, turning in an awed circle. “It’s like a different house.”
“It’s nice to see you again, Narcissa,” he said.
“Hmm,” Draco said, stroking his hands down Harry’s round sides. “This lap feels smaller.”
“We’ll be there,” Harry said.
“Er – yes,” Harry said.
“Well, all right,” Ron said, as if that settled something. “He’s still an absolute dick wrinkle, but I suppose he’s your dick wrinkle now.”
He ran through the math. It was true he’d put on another two and a half stone in the past few months, which made three and a half altogether since Draco had made the comment about outpacing Hermione. That was more, in fact, than what Draco had predicted. Harry cleaned his plate as he considered this, barely noticing when Draco took it from him to quietly refill it.
Kreacher was beaming. “Master is looking less like a garden rake every day,” he said approvingly.
Actually, Harry’s gaffe made Draco feel better. It was easier to think of it as a meeting than as a reunion. “Of course I’ll come,” he said. “If you’ll promise to protect me.”
They stumbled out into a scene of total chaos, everyone hugging and yelling and shrieking, and Harry realized he’d misjudged the scale of this dinner. It wasn’t just Ginny – it was Molly and Arthur, too, and Bill and Fleur, and George and his wife Niti, plus their terrible three year-old daughter, Freddy, who was sat in the middle of the room screaming her head off.
“Feeding himself’s not his strong suit,” said a willowy blond witch, head appearing suddenly around the door to the auror’s department. “Sir, bit of a situation…”
A slow smile spread over Pansy’s face. “Tell me,” she said. “Was his jumper too snug before you started working there? Or is this a recent development?”
“Very dark magic,” Harry said, tugging down her panties and leaning forward over his gut to taste her. Her knees went visibly weak. “Draco,” Harry said. “Come help me. She’s dangerous and I’m too fucking full to take her down myself.”
“Stop it,” Hermione said, putting her arms around Harry and giving his cheek a ringing kiss. “It’s relationship weight, it means he’s happy!”
Harry had barely started to bristle in Malfoy’s defense when De la Cruz continued.
“I think I’m bigger by the hour, too,” Harry said quietly, watching Draco’s face, which turned a wonderful pink. He put a deviled egg into his mouth, and quickly followed it up with three more, eating much more quickly than he’d normally do in public. Draco had taken a risk accompanying him tonight and he wanted to make it worth his boyfriend’s while. It took him barely a minute to clear the whole plate of six deviled egg halves and then start in on Draco’s.
“For dessert?” Kreacher wanted to know, and Draco laughed in delight. What an ally!
“Please, surround me with Slytherins,” Harry said.
“I think you ought to know something,” Draco said. His heart was pounding in his ears and Harry looked faintly alarmed, struggling around his packed belly to sit up. Draco laid a placating hand on the buttery, softening skin of his stomach, and forced himself to meet those green eyes. “I think you ought to know that I love you.”
Draco did. He also knew rice pudding and samosa and pakora, all of which Potter would be having for lunch tomorrow.
Potter looked supremely disappointed, as if he’d been hoping for a more pressing emergency. “Ah,” he said. “Thanks Wendy. I’ll see to it after lunch.”
“I’ve eaten half the pan already,” Harry said.
Cursebreaking had ten employees, the youngest of whom had only overlapped with Draco one year in school. He was embarrassingly grateful for this, that none of his new co-workers had known him at Hogwarts, though of course they knew who he was and treated him with a kind of willful tolerance that was a cousin to condescension. Still, they were polite and did not loathe him outright, which was honestly more than he had hoped for.
“Or at eating, apparently,” Draco said, who was very good at bossing indeed. His own lunch sack was still in his hand and to his shock, he found himself holding it out. “Go on,” he said. “I make a brisket that will absolutely destroy you.”
Ginny let out a shriek when she saw Harry, and rushed him so enthusiastically he was worried she’d knock him over.
“Do you really have to report on that?” Draco said, horrified.
Harry laughed at the wistful look on Malfoy’s face. “Seems I’ve found your weakness. Murderous antiques.”
“Garlic bread?” Potter said, brightening, and he peeped into the bag. “Oh gods. This looks…”
“Good,” Draco said briskly. “Your hair’s already full-on scarecrow, best not to tempt fate by skipping meals.”
Harry smirked at Ron. “My boyfriend bought it.”
“She?” Harry said.
Harry and Draco and Pansy all have sex, whatttt you've been warned
“We can go to mine,” Draco said. “If you want.”
“I’ll love her even if she’s a boy!” Hermione said hotly. “I’ll love them no matter what gender they are born with or choose for themselves! But oh, I hope she’s not a boy. No offense, but I’ve been absolutely surrounded by you lot, and with Ginny off playing for the states, I need an ally. Oh Harry, she’s coming home next month, by the way! Did she tell you?”
Stalling, Draco fed Harry more of the cheese and bread. Sitting at a table with Hermione and the Weasleys was nervewracking to imagine. He felt confident that Harry saw him as he was now, but he had a terrible suspicion that Harry’s friends would look at him and see only the boy he’d been, mean and wrongminded and frightened out of his mind.
“No, your arse has gotten a bit bigger, too,” Draco said. “And your thighs. And your face, a little.”
“Both. Lots. I forgot my lunch.” Potter had been frozen in the doorway, but now he began to make his way across the room, warily, as if approaching a wild animal. “How – er, how have you been?”
“Bosworth, Kaplan and Abebe, you’ll be following up with the Museum of Useless Artifacts to review their security penseives. De la Cruz and Murphy, I need you with the Diagon Alley Shopkeeper’s Association again. Ryan and Schmitz, how’s the Whittmer case coming along?”
“You guys must have a lot of sex,” Pansy said, eyeing him.
Hermione made a thoughtful sound. “What are you trying to stretch?”
“Well, you look very nice,” Hermione said decidedly. “That color blue is beautiful on you, is it new?”
By the time Ron had turned back around, Harry had cleared his plate and was leaned back in his chair, one hand resting gingerly on his aching belly.
Harry stood before the scuffed glass, breath held, trying in vain to button his trousers. Finally he let out his breath in a whoosh and watched the new curve of his belly relax forward over his boxers. “They closed yesterday,” he complained.
“Big strong auror,” Pansy panted. “I used to be a dark witch, you know. Are you going to punish me?”
“So did I,” said Harry, smiling.
Draco hadn’t thought of it this way. He hmmmed noncommittally. Potter was really making inroads, done with the pasta already and ripping himself another buttery hunk of bread, swirling it around the cheesy sauce and lifting the dripping hunk to his lips.
“Well, that’s not bloody likely,” Harry said, watching with some alarm as Kreacher piled his breakfast plate high with French toast, butter, syrup, scrambled eggs, sausage, and bacon. “This is delicious,” he said, mouth full, “but I couldn’t get my trousers done up this morning. Going hungry might not be the worst thing for me.”
“We’ve been dating for almost five months,” Harry announced over dinner. Dinner, or whatever it was called when you were in bed with your boyfriend feeding him a pan of lasagna.
“Hermione’s dying to meet you,” Harry said, then realized what he’d said and tried to cover it up. “I mean, you’ve met, of course you’ve met, I only mean she’s looking forward to meeting you as, as my boyfriend, you know…”
“Ah,” Draco said. “How about… baked brie and a baguette?”
“Don’t ask him, ask me,” Draco said.
De la Cruz raised her hand. “Who’s lead on Cursebreaking, sir?”
“What about next Thursday?” Draco’s mind was racing. “I’ll roast a couple chickens, some new potatoes, nothing fancy. Maybe a trifle. And then something for when they’re gone – lasagna’s always good, isn’t it?”
There it was, that bright, unconcealed grin. Potter pushed his glasses up and waved, so transparently pleased to see him.
Draco did know. “I don’t think you’re mental.”
“Yes,” Potter said eventually. “Yes, I like cheesecake. I like everything.”
“Yes,” Harry said. “But first I have to search you.”
To his utter chagrin, his cock didn’t seem humiliated at all. In fact it was downright perky. He’d noticed this happening before when he ate too much, as if there was some strange connection between the swelling of his poor belly and the swelling of his cock, blood rushing to all the wrong places. He palmed it hopelessly then resolved to ignore it, focusing instead on the clock. He still had an hour before he had to meet Malfoy in his office – plenty of time for a quick nap, just to try and work through some of this debilitating fullness.
“You hurt him, I kill you!” he said cheerfully.
“Of course you have,” Arthur echoed. “Well, marvelous, isn’t it?”
“Yes, she may stay with me for a night or two,” Harry said. He and Ginny were on excellent terms since their breakup, which had been hilariously mutual: both of them had turned out to play more for the other team, so to speak, although for Ginny the euphemism was quite literal. She’d fallen in love with Emmaline, a teammate on her Quidditch team. “I haven’t told her yet, though, about…”
“He always did have good taste,” Hermione mused, leading them to the table. It was set very nicely, Harry noticed. They didn’t usually pull out any stops for him, but tonight they were eating off Molly’s mother’s good china, candles flickering in silver holders, and there was a champagne flute set at his and Ron’s seats. Not at Hermione’s, however – and his heart gave a skittering lurch in his chest.
“I don’t mean you should fetch it,” he said. “I just want to know where it is and how to get it.”
“I didn’t have a thing for him,” Harry said indignantly. “I hated him!”
“How much have you put on?” Ron wanted to know. “Two stone?”
“Hear, hear,” said George, who was quite drunk.
Breathlessly, she confirmed what he already suspected. “It’s Harry Potter!”
Harry waved him off and managed to sit upright. He tugged his shirt down and stroked a hand over the tight curve of his belly, thinking of all he’d put into it that day. He’d eaten enough for three people, easily, and here he was, anticipating breakfast. Quite a change from the weeks before Malfoy had come back into his life, when dinner was often the only meal he managed to eat with any regularity, to his house elf’s supreme distress. Kreacher was a lot happier now that Harry had started eating breakfast again – it was, for reasons unknown, the elf’s own favorite meal of the day, and also the only meal for which they both fully agreed on timing. Kreacher was old and devoted to the five o’clock supper so he could be in bed by eight, while Harry preferred to dine later. Often Kreacher charmed his dinner to stay warm and Harry would eat it alone by the fire instead of at the table with his elf, and that, too, had contributed to how thin he’d let himself get: he never managed to eat much when he was eating alone.
“Well, of course, you’re the type who’s up on history.” Wendy nodded smartly. “Anyway, the Minister’s got this house-husband, does all the cleaning and cooking, apparently he’s a real gourmand. Harry’s at theirs twice a week, getting stuffed to the gills.”
Draco set down the empty plate and reached down to unhook her bra, and she shrugged out of it, turning so her full, lovely breasts spilled out into Draco’s hands. He thumbed one of her hard nipples, then reached down and palmed his cock as she pulled herself slowly up Harry’s body, her tits teasing the painfully taut skin of his full belly.
“A lot of them,” Draco said. “Enough for your master to eat until he has to lie down.”
“Bloody stuffed,” Harry sighed.
“How did that happen?” Draco said, touching the place on his own lip. Potter’s eyes followed his finger and lingered there for a moment.
“Master will not go hungry in this house,” Kreacher clarified.
Draco dropped a hand to the side of Potter’s poor stomach, knuckling it gently. “Think we burned some calories. Time for dessert?”
“Oh,” she said, “that’s not really my –”
Relief flooded Draco’s body. “That’s fair. That’s absolutely fair. Really, you’ll have dinner with her? I could invite Pansy too, she’s in town next week and my mum’s mad about her.”
“Is he coming to family dinner tomorrow night?” Ginny called over her shoulder. She and Emmaline were tromping up the stairs with an energy Harry had lost two stone ago. He hoped they couldn’t see how winded he was getting.
“Draco, I honestly think I’ve gotten bigger since yesterday. I don’t even fit into my robes anymore.”
“When this git gets over it,” Harry said, clapping Ron on the shoulder. “Speaking of dinner, what’s on the menu?”
Draco nearly dropped the plate several times, transfixed. It was bizarre and incredibly sexy to watch this beautiful woman do to Harry what he did every night.
“He’ll eat whatever you put in front of him, won’t he?” Ron said to Draco, and then, at Draco’s answering leer, “Oh, Merlin, I walked right into that one.”
“Can we move to the sitting room?” Harry begged. “I need a lie-down.”
“The denim’s gone all thin,” she said. “It’s obvious around the knees. Soon it’ll be see through.”
“Some kind of three-layer cake,” Draco said. “Preferably chocolate. And a side of cream.”
“Anyway,” Sheila said, running an admiring finger over the walnut bookshelf in the corner, “it’s Giggy’s birthday and we’re having cake in the break room. Come and join us, won’t you?”
“It’s all here,” Harry said, tapping said belly.
She was already pushing past him into the flat. “Pansy, you are absolutely stunning,” she pronounced. Then she looked at Harry, and Draco found he was holding his breath. Harry reddened under her gaze, his hands in his pockets, leaning back a bit to counterbalance his belly, looking so sweet and nervous and delicious that Draco wanted to pounce on him.
“And he’ll never let me forget it,” Draco said to Pansy. He sat up and said, “Does my hero want some lasagna?”
“No,” Harry said with relief. “I bloody hate shopping, thank you.”
But Draco was realizing something about Potter, something very important.
Harry made a carry-on motion with his hand. “Your point, Wendy?”
Potter shoved away the empty curry dish and curled over himself, arms wrapped around his bloated middle. He was panting audibly, glasses slid so far down the bridge of his nose that they were nearly coming off, and Draco, daring greatly, leaned forward and gently pushed them back up for him. Potter met his eyes and Draco could have sworn he saw actual sparks.
Harry accepted a beer and watched as Kreacher set down a spread of appetizers – a cheese plate, a dish of olives, a platter of smoked meat, a plate of sausages on toothpicks, a baguette sliced and buttered. They were on the coffee table before him, right at his knees. He watched as Hermione slid to the edge of the couch and spread her legs even further, leaning awkwardly around her belly to start filling herself a plate as Ron and Draco sipped beer and made smalltalk about George’s latest business venture. Harry, too, slid to the edge of the couch. He had to hold his breath to lean forward enough to put together a plate of food, and even with his legs spread wide his belly squished up on his lap and left him breathless. At his side, Hermione appeared unwinded. She had her plate partially balanced on her belly, but needed one hand to hold it in place. Harry, very casually, rested his own plate on the crest of his tummy, and found to his shock that it decidedly did not need any hands. It sat comfortably on the shelf of fat.
“Actually,” Draco said, feeling inspired, and reached forward for the plate. “I’ll keep feeding him this lasagna if you’ll keep kissing him.”
This information cheered Draco immensely; the coffee here really was outstanding. It was with total confidence and security that he breezed into the breakroom the very next afternoon, happily flicked his wand for a cappuccino, heard the creak of a door, and turned to find himself staring at Harry fucking Potter.
A weak laugh. “Yes. To, er, to put it mildly. But Malfoy… the war, it was… we all did things we regret. I’m not saying I’m happy with what you did, who you were – how could I be? But...” He tightened his jaw as if about to say something difficult, and Draco braced himself. “But I forgive you. I forgave you in the Room of Requirement, when I saved your life.”
She disappeared around the corner and Harry said, “I’m – uh – I’d –”
Harry put a careful, bracing hand on his belly as he stood, and he saw Malfoy track the movement. “Overdid it with those,” he said, nodding towards the pumpkin bars. “Had a big breakfast this morning.”
Potter shrugged, forking up more pasta. “We were both pawns, in a way. Working for forces that shoved us around. Neither of us really had a choice.”
By this time, most of the table had drunk a fair amount, save for poor Hermione. Harry’s belly was bloated not only with a fantastic amount of food but also with several strong beers, which had the converse effects of dulling the pain at the same time they added to it. He’d undone his jeans button around his second plate of pasta, and when the sticky toffee pudding landed in front of him he gave up and began undoing his flannel shirt, too. He had a perfectly nice white t-shirt underneath, after all, though it was a bit snug and showed off the deep hollow of his belly button. He sighed with relief as the flannel fell away, then blinked down at the solid heap of belly he’d uncovered.
“Nice to meet you,” Draco said politely, and at Harry’s snort, snapped, “I haven’t learned absolutely nothing from Granger, thank you. I’m a contributing member of S.P.E.W., I’ll have you know.”
“I see why, it’s a good color on him. Can’t you swap it out for a larger size when he’s not looking?”
“More penance?” Harry said, then draped a hand across the upper curve of his belly. “I think you’ve done enough.”
“A word?” he said.
“That way you won’t be hungry,” Pansy said, “and your mood will be less likely to take a nosedive when Narcissa complains about Muggle rights.”
He hurried back to find Pansy sitting on Harry’s knee, one hand resting on his belly. Harry looked terrified – terrified, and turned-on. Draco knew that look.
“Aren’t you worried about insulting me?” Draco said. He handed Potter the last slice of buttered cheese-bread and Potter looked up, his eyes meeting Draco’s. He looked tired and full and intrigued. He took the slice of bread and ate it slowly, leaning back in his chair as he did so. It definitely wasn’t Draco’s imagination: he was filling out his shirt better than he had been. It fit him perfectly now, and it was all Draco’s doing. Well, and perhaps Ron Weasley, but Draco batted that thought away like he would an annoying fly.
That wasn’t what Draco had expected. “You have every right to hate me,” he tried.
The man liked taking orders. He was not, as he’d said, good at bossing – but he was very, very good at being bossed.
“How’s it feeling in there?” Draco asked, smoothing both strong palms down the bow of Harry’s belly as he sat against the headboard.
“Yes,” Harry said adamantly. “It’s – I’m sorry it’s taken me so long. I mean, it’s nowhere near as nice as your flat, and my bed’s not half as comfortable, and Kreacher won’t let you in the kitchen so you’ll have to ask him whenever you want to feed me something, but… if that all sounds okay with you… then, yes. I want you to come over.”
“Almost done,” Draco said, voice low, his whole body a taut, quivering string, completely focused on Potter.
“No Pansy, then?”
“Your relationship with your best friend is very different from mine,” Harry commented, scraping his spoon around the nearly-empty pint.
“Don’t worry,” Harry said dryly. “He’s on your team. Tried to get me to finish off an entire pound cake for breakfast the other day.”
“Malfoy, pleasant?” Ron pursed his lips and pretended to think. “Nah, can’t picture it.”
“Next week?” Ron said. “Ours?”
“Well, that was batshit,” Pansy said a while later, wrapped in one of Draco’s (many) silk kimonos and sipping the champagne Narcissa had left in the fridge. “I haven’t had that kind of fun in a while.”
And with that he was gone, the bastard, leaving Harry to fumble with his trousers and try to make himself presentable. He stood, thinking it might be easier to get the fly done-up that way, but even standing his belly was too swollen to allow the buttonhole to swallow the button. Gritting his teeth, he threw caution to the wind and attempted a stretching charm, and a moment later let out a groan of despair. Wendy had been right: the denim was essentially see-through. He tried to reverse the charm, but to his absolute horror, his put-upon jeans gave up the ghost entirely, and burst into a shower of glitter. He was left standing in his office in a too-tight pair of boxers and a shirt and jumper that were clinging to their last legs.
He collected his various notetaking devices and exited his office somewhat sheepishly, certain Wendy would be able to tell he’d been sleeping on the job, but she just smiled and handed him a folder.
Draco raised an eyebrow at this, and Potter shrugged, sheepish. He really was paranoid.
“The things I did,” he said. “The people I – the person I – Dumbledore –”
“Literally can’t believe you’re eating again,” Pansy said.
“I’m so fucking full, is what,” Harry said, and looked at Draco through lowered lashes, an invitation Draco took gladly, leaning forward to catch his mouth in a bruising kiss.
“Hmm, point. Harry, kiss me, I’m getting nervous.”
His only saving grace was the pair of robes hanging on the back of his door. He pulled them on with relief, though he frowned when he smoothed them down his torso and saw that even they clung just a bit to his stomach.
“Merlin’s beard,” Draco said, raking his gaze across the round belly pushed out against his palm.
“Prat?” Draco suggested.
“Malfoy,” Potter groaned, but he took the brownie and doggedly began eating it, as if he couldn’t help himself. Draco found that his own breath was coming a bit short, and he sat up straighter, trying to regulate it, trying not to let on that he was…
“You mean this?” Harry said, framing his belly between his hands. He accepted another bite of lasagna and chewed thoughtfully. “I’m not bothered, I guess. Or, no, I am a little bothered. I feel a bit… out of control, I suppose. Especially when I catch sight of myself in a mirror. It’s always a surprise, how big I’ve gotten. How big I’m letting myself get.”
Kreacher announced dinner shortly after, and everyone got up to file into the dining room. Hermione planted her hands on her knees and heaved herself up on the first try, but Harry found he needed a bit more momentum, leaning back and forth a few times and then lurching upright, belly throwing him off balance. Draco caught his expression and gave him a questioning look, but Harry shook his head, lips pressed tightly together.
Draco laughed, visibly relaxing. “It was a team effort.”
“Guilty,” Malfoy said, almost smiling.
“But you would look so ‘andsome,” she pleaded.
“I work here,” Draco said. “In cursebreaking.”
“Incredible,” Harry said.
“This is ridiculous,” Hermione said, though she was watching with undisguised interest, chin propped on her hand. “Harry, you’re sweating.”
That night, after he’d dropped his mother back at the manor, Draco made an absolutely enormous supper. Lasagna, garlic bread, buttered spinach, treacle tart for dessert. Cooking was something he’d always left to house elves growing up, but over the years of living alone he’d found it was something he quite enjoyed, and what’s more, he was good at it. He barely made a dent during his own dinner before he began packing it up for the next day’s lunch: one small portion in one brown bag, and one considerably larger portion in a bag he labeled “Potter.”
“Yes, I think that’s wise.”
“Am I going to have to restrain you so you don’t run away?” Draco said, reaching around Pansy’s body to cover his breasts with his big hands. He let her feel how hard he was against her ass.
“I am hungry,” Harry said. Then, because he knew what it would do to Draco, he put a hand to his belly. “I have put on four stone, though. Maybe I’d better not.”
“The only thing that’ll burst is those trousers.”
“Hermione’s not fat, she’s with child.”
“I’d imagine. I think you ate half the pasta on this table.”
“And the… consequences?”
“Then you’ll never come visit!” Molly said, but immediately started shouting the recipe across the table, and soon enough everyone was yelling at one another about something other than Harry’s weight, which suited him fine.
Potter shook his head, eyes half-closed against the discomfort he must be feeling. Then he said, “Butter chicken. Can you make that?”
“Sit,” Draco ordered, and felt an odd flicker of pleasure at seeing how quickly Potter obeyed him. A moment later the coffee machine spat out an incredibly rich, sugary concoction of chocolate and caramel, topped with a quivering mound of whipped cream.
“Right,” Harry said. “There is that. Turns out I’m a bit of a glutton. And you’re a bit of an enabler.”
She cackled, and a moment later her laughing head disappeared with a whoosh of flame. Draco frowned at the empty hearth. There were downsides to being very well-known by an old friend. Although the advice about the tie was appreciated.
“That was ages ago!” Draco yelled back.
Harry sighed, reaching for the platter of bacon. He could feel this meal settling in his belly on top of the cake he hadn’t quite managed to fully digest; could feel each bite of sausage and syrupy French toast stretching his stretched-out stomach. Yet he didn’t stop. He let Kreacher refill his plate again, and then once more, until the table was just a mess of empty dishes and Harry’s hands were sticky with syrup. He was lightly out of breath, leaned back in his chair to give his stomach more room, sticky fingers pushed up beneath his jumper to soothe the gurgle of his pained gut. He pet himself as he’d pet an unpredictable animal, with soft, reassuring strokes, feeling how tight he’d gotten yet again.
“Leave the apparating to me,” Draco said, leading him to a darkened alley nearby. Potter nodded, too out of breath from the walk to speak, and Draco took his hand. It was surprisingly large and calloused in his own smooth fingers, and there was such trust in his grip. Draco squeezed once, and with a ferocious crack, they vanished.
In answer, Harry turned towards her, angling his belly to one side so he could pull her close and cup one of her beautiful breasts, lowering his head to lick a stripe across her nipple before sucking it into his mouth. It absolutely killed Draco that he had to stand sideways to do this, and to kiss her, her arms entwined around his neck.
Now it was Draco’s turn to laugh, surprised at the honesty. “Yes.”
“Or eat, probably.”
“I’m no good at bossing,” Potter said.
“Might be too full for that,” he said. “I’ll have it later.”
“Can you imagine,” Potter said. “Excuse me, Minister, if you wouldn’t mind filling out a report on how much toilet paper the auror department used last week, thanks so much, I’m sure you’ve time for it.”
Kreacher gave Draco an approving look and vanished. Draco took the pastry-encrusted cheese to the couch and tucked himself into Harry’s side. Experimentally he tried to lay the baguette atop the curve of Harry’s stomach, but it rolled off.
“I haven’t outrgrown them,” Harry said hotly, “they just don’t happen to fit right now, today.”
Harry looked up. “Yes?
“I’ll be in the kitchen,” Harry said. “There’s cake.”
“You know, I’m also about to put on quite a lot of weight,” Hermione said. “Are you going to poke me, too?”
“Here, here, have some more firewhisky, that’ll fix it, go on.”
Ron burst out laughing. “You look so surprised every time! Oh, this is priceless. The great Harry Potter, felled by hiccups.”
“I’m stuck in the office doing paperwork,” he said glumly. “If I’d known how bloody much there’d be, I never would’ve accepted this position.”
“That was amazing.”
Harry walked the narrow, familiar hallway, his heart thudding for some reason. Maybe it was vestiges of the panic that had overtaken him post-nap, or maybe it was just the elevated heartrate of pure curiosity to see where Malfoy spent his days. Either way, it banged in his ears as he banged on the door labeled Draco Malfoy. It sprang open a crack, and tentatively Harry pushed his way in.
Admit it, Draco…
“Mmm,” Harry said through a mouthful of beef.
Ron snorted. “No, that’s a stone. And you’ve been eating me out of house and home lately. Did you get hit with a curse, or something?”
Harry mimed throwing the last bite of cinnamon roll at her and she whirled away, still laughing, his office door closing behind her. Harry put the last bite into his mouth instead, and chewed, looking down at his overstretched trousers and the thick belly that was mounded above them. Did he mind? He genuinely wasn’t certain. He’d never been anything but thin and now all of a sudden he wasn’t. He wasn’t fat by any means, or even podgy, but he’d added an undeniable paunch that only seemed to get bigger by the day. It was especially large right now because he’d had a stressful morning and had, admittedly, been eating almost nonstop. He was absolutely stuffed, belly throbbing with the onslaught of food, probably six meal’s worth and it wasn’t even two pm. He let out a heavy sigh, fingering the impossible button. Wendy was right: these jeans wouldn’t last another stretching charm.
“Er – yes,” Harry said again.
“And those little fried dough balls,” Potter said. “In honey? You know those?”
“That armoire, the one that grew teeth and tried to eat anyone who came near it? I got the curse off yesterday and sold it today. Seven hundred thousand galleons. Not quite the million you promised me, but…”
“Calories,” Draco said. “From what I remember, you didn’t have lunch yesterday, either.”
“You really can’t believe it?” Draco said. “You’re eating enough for three men your size. Every day. With absolutely no let-up.”
“The difference is, we’re drinking crap rosé and she’ll have put down a hundred galleons worth of champagne. Harry, pet, how’s the gateau?”
“Oh, I believe in you,” Draco said airily. “Anyway, your ex-girlfriend’s coming next week. Don’t you want to look your best?”
She turned back to Draco, who let out a breath of pure relief. That hadn’t been so bad at all. “Darling, I brought champagne, hurry and put it in the fridge.”
“Come in,” Harry said, waiting ‘til the door was properly closed and locked before he grinned at his boyfriend.
“Kiss me all you want,” Harry said, and smiled. “But you know what? It’s already better.”
“You didn’t bring the wine,” Pansy noted. “I’ll go fetch us three glasses, and while I’m in the kitchen, have your little chat.”
“What’s it done to you?” Draco said.
“Yes,” Draco said. “In your office.”
Potter peered at him through his glasses, those green eyes resting on his face with a kind of soft curiosity. “I suppose I’ll be seeing you around.”
“Is he going to make a thing about your weight?”
“Someone’s been eating too much,” Draco countered.
“We do,” Draco said, and thumbed a creamy droplet off Harry’s chest, offering his thumb for Harry to suck clean.
“Starved,” Harry agreed, and he was, though there was absolutely no reason for it. Malfoy had made him another absolute spread that afternoon, a homemade pepperoni pizza and mozzarella sticks and a thermos full of creamy tomato soup, plus three thick slices of toffee pudding and a half pint of vanilla ice cream, and Harry had eaten every last drop, as he always did. Something about the excellence of Malfoy’s cooking, and the odd, sideways manner in which Malfoy watched him, and the peremptory orders Malfoy gave him… it all made him so damn
“Later,” Draco leered, taking the empty shake cup from Harry’s hand and disappearing it. “You can make it up to me tonight.”
Harry introduced them, smirking to see that even Draco was a bit dazed by her beauty, touching the place on his cheek where her lips had been.
Potter flinched slightly at the name, like the twinge of an old wound. “Yeah,” he said. “Well, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t wish I could go back in time and… and…”
“C’mon, love,” Emmaline said, dragging Ginny off Harry and herding her towards the floo. “You don’t want me to get jealous.”
“Draco,” she said. “I’m so glad you’ve come.” She stood on tiptoe to put her arms around him, well-practiced with reaching Ron, and gave him a kiss on the cheek.
“Beer for me,” Harry said. “He’ll have white wine, if you’ve got any.”
“That won’t bother her,” Draco said. “So long as she doesn’t think it’s got anything to do with me. It’s me she’ll judge, not you.”
“I can’t,” Potter protested. “I’m absolutely packed.”
“I know,” Harry said, clearly weary of this conversation. “I’ve put on about six stone altogether.”
Harry’s stomach moaned unhappily as he bit into a pumpkin bar, eating it mindlessly as he watched Malfoy work. It was clear he was not only an expert, but an artist. Harry helped himself to another pumpkin bar, watching the twist of his clever fingers as he teased out the dark matter of the curse. Any good the nap had done was being dismantled as Harry reached for a third pumpkin bar, adding it to his enormous breakfast and bloating his belly even further, the skin tight and stretched. Malfoy bit his lip in concentration. Harry bit into his fourth pumpkin bar. Malfoy pushed a lock of hair out of his face. Harry began pushing his fifth pumpkin bar into his mouth. He licked a long swath of frosting off his thumb and Malfoy fumbled his wand, the first non-graceful move he’d made, though he recovered quickly.
“Dark magic,” Harry growled, and unfastened Pansy’s skirt, pulling it down so roughly she had to steady herself with a hand on his back. She stepped out of it, in just high heels and panties now, and Draco groaned as he watched Harry pull her forward so he could mouth her cunt through the lace of her panties, one hand steadying her on her hip, the other hand dipping beneath that lace, thumb finding her clit.
Draco had known Potter for nearly twenty years. He knew the man was determined, focused, passionate, reckless – knew this intellectually. But it was quite another thing to know it physically. Potter made love like he sought the snitch, like he’d fought the Dark Lord, like he’d saved the whole damn wizarding world: very fucking well. Even half-incapacitated with fullness, Potter took Draco apart even as he himself was coming apart, both of them panting into one another’s mouths and whining like beasts, unable to get enough contact, enough friction, until all of a sudden it was enough, it was too much, it was glorious and painful and perfect, and they were both shouting as they came.
He glanced up to find Malfoy staring at him. “She’s right,” he said shortly. Then, before Harry could process this, “Finished. It’s all yours.”
“New clothes, I know.”
Potter was breathing heavily, glasses slid down his nose and the scar on his lip somehow more pronounced after all the exercise his mouth had gotten.
“Say the word, and we’ll stop,” Draco said. “I’ll start making broccoli instead of cake, we can watch your portions, we can go on walks…”
Draco bit her neck and began manhandling her towards where Harry lay back on the couch, looking swollen and indolent and so fucking sexy. She straddled his thick waist, Draco behind her, and she leaned forward to grip Harry’s lovehandles as she sank down onto him, both her and Harry gasping as she began to ride him.
“Giggy says he’s first rate,” she said importantly, then lowered her voice a bit. “Former Death Eater, though.”
“Harry, Hermione’s five months pregnant and I reckon you’ve got a bigger belly than she has,” Ron said. “’Mione, turn to the side!”
Eventually Pansy rolled off him and stretched out at his side, wedged between his body and the back of the couch, arm draped across his chest. His belly was heaving as he tried in vain to catch his breath. Draco was only too happy to finish himself off to this sight, and at a nod from Harry, he spurted across that stretchmarked flesh with a hoarse groan.
“With rice,” Potter said.
“Bring the wine!” Pansy called after Draco as he slid the lasagna into the oven. Then he heard her say, “So, about that threesome.”
Draco glanced at Potter. “Beer?” Potter nodded. “Two.”
“Oy, Harry,” George called. “You’ve packed it on, mate!”
“I expect breakfast.”
In his fifth week, his co-worker Sheila turned up at his office and took a moment looking around the tiny room, thick black eyebrows raised.
“—and for cappuccino, it’s three flicks to the right,” the intern was saying. They were standing at the coffee maker, and Draco blinked. He’d missed the entire demonstration, but that hardly mattered. He’d bring his own coffee from now on, the better to avoid this place, to avoid Potter. Although, since he was here…
“Wait,” Harry said, trying to sit up straighter in his desk chair. “You aren’t joking?”
They all sat there contemplating this until Draco said, “I’m getting us all some water. Harry, can you do an impression of a man who did not just eat an entire cake?”
“I hope she’s ten feet tall!” shrieked Hermione, who was clearly also too happy to make much sense.
“Big portions,” Potter said, looking at the mound of pad thai in front of him, and then at the steaming tureen of rich peanut curry with its generous side of white rice. “One of these alone is more than enough for two.”
Potter popped keenly to his feet, and the witch added, “… with the copy-spell. All your reports are coming out in French.”
“Who cares with who,” Hermione said, squeezing Harry’s hand. She was such a bloody romantic, Harry almost preferred Ron’s teasing. “When will you bring him to dinner?”
Harry shook his head. “I don’t think so. Keeps surprising me, somehow, how big I’ve let myself get.”
“Can’t you do as you used to and fob it off to Granger?” Draco said, and Potter let out a startled laugh.
“Is this enough for Master and Little Lord Malfoy?” he wheezed.
“About twenty stone, give or take.”
Harry let out a little huff. “You scared me.”
“You’re already half-hard just thinking about it, aren’t you,” Draco said resignedly.
“Well,” Ron said heavily, “bring it in.” And he took a very uncomfortable-looking Draco in his arms, delivering several powerful thumps to his back before releasing him. “Guess you’re part of the family now,” he said. “Can’t believe my kid’s going to call you Uncle Draco.”
“No,” Bill said, not looking up.
They grinned at each other for a moment, a strange shyness in the air, and then Draco piled the fork high again. “Well, that’s settled. Let’s give you a horrible stomachache, shall we?”
“Can we put our things down, love?” Emmaline said to her. “Then you can give Harry a hard time.”
“I was in the papers yesterday, did you see?” he said. “The Boy Who Ate. Oddly complimentary, actually. Nice to see him happy, was the gist.”
“Keep drinking,” Draco said, and Harry sucked more rich milkshake into his mouth. “I’ll take care of getting you some new things,” Draco said. “Unless you’d rather.”
“I suppose you of all people have the right to be paranoid,” Malfoy said, shrugging. “Still, I hate thinking of all those treasures locked away in dusty corners just because they might be deadly.”
“A spot of weight,” Harry muttered. “It’s over two stone.”
“He’s wasting away,” said Ginny sympathetically.
“I simply provide lunch,” Draco said, palms sweaty. A stone and a half! “I’m not the one eating it.”
“And did you?”
He sat in the break room for a whole hour, quietly eating cake, drinking (tragically excellent) coffee, and listening to his coworkers banter – and in all that time, he didn’t see a single auror.
“It most certainly is not,” Hermione said sharply, but Ron, of course, was grinning, and a few minutes later he was egging Harry on as he spooned biscuit, strawberries and cream into his mouth.
“I look big,” Harry said ruefully.
“Brought you a milkshake,” Draco said, holding up an enormous frosted cup. “Chocolate.”
“Stretching charms? Of course, they’re a snap. Haven’t you read Sartorial Magic by Mugsy Poddington?”
Draco coasted a hand across that hot, tight skin. “I lied, earlier,” he said. “I can tell you’ve put on weight.”
“Obviously,” Draco said.
“Right,” Pansy said, “but this isn’t work.”
Ron magicked away the dishes and Harry stood with a groan, making his way to the green velvet couch and throwing himself down onto it. Lying down, half-supported on the cushions, he could see the gentle swell of his packed stomach rising from between the unbuttoned flaps of his jeans, and he tugged his shirt up a bit, too, just enough that he could lay a warm palm across it soothingly. With his other hand, he knocked his glass of firewhisky against Ron’s and took a warming sip. Immediately he began to feel a bit less nauseous.
Pansy yawned hugely. “Well boys,” she said. “Congratulations, you wore me out. I’m going to bed.”
“Color has nothing to do with it,” Draco said. “You know, pink used to be reserved only for young noblemen, and it was only later, in the nineteen fifties, that –”
“I know,” Hermione said happily, giving him and then Draco a kiss. “Everyone’s shocked when I tell them I still have a month to go. I hope it means my baby’s lovely and fat.”
“Me too,” Harry breathed, because it was true, his cock was twitching to attention in his tight jeans.
“I love it,” Ginny announced. “If Harry had looked like this when we were dating, I might’ve stayed with him.”
The charm worked like a – well, like a charm. The jeans were up a size, the denim slightly thinner overall since the extra material had to come from somewhere, but that would reverse itself when Harry reversed the charm tomorrow. He buttoned them with ease and pulled on a t-shirt and green wool jumper and went downstairs feeling far more cheerful. Thank god for Hermione.
“You were absolutely obsessed with him,” Ginny corrected, swooping back in to pet Harry’s belly at its broadest point. “I suppose he likes this, does he? Pervy git.”
“Come off it,” Harry grumbled. “It’s only been a couple weeks since I’ve seen you.”
“Thanks again for dinner,” Harry said.
“Happy. With Draco. Sodding. Malfoy.”
“Doubtful,” Draco said, and was horrified to hear himself saying it fondly. “He’ll probably wear horrible dark wash jeans and a too-snug jumper like he does every day.”
After Narcissa had vanished into the floo, Draco collapsed onto a couch.
“Come on,” Draco said, extending his hands, “get up and say goodbye to our guests.”
“What?” Harry said, looking adorably startled, and he tried to peer around the mound of tummy that blocked his view of her head.
Draco had stopped dead in the middle of the hallway, one hand on the wall to steady himself. A horrible buzz was sounding in his ears. Surely he would know if – surely he would have heard…? He said, “The Head Auror. His name.”
Potter was waiting for him outside the restaurant, hands in his pockets, sage-green jumper stretched gently over that little push of stomach. It would be tighter by the time Draco was through with him, he thought, and had to stop to school his features before he turned the corner and let Potter see him.
“Looks good,” Potter said, tongue playing with the edge of that tantalizing scar.
“Good,” Draco murmured. “Another bite. Good. Merlin, you’re going to feel this tomorrow. Thank god you’ve got me to rub that gut of yours.”
Because that was the truth. Watching Potter eat was undeniably erotic, and the more he ate, the more erotic it was. When he picked up the last brownie of his own accord and, panting, started to chew, Draco had to bite his lip to keep from making a sound.
“Milk? Sugar?”
“I am,” Harry said, tucking in, “so stuffed.”
“I haven’t put on
“That t-shirt’s on its last legs,” she noted.
Curious, Harry turned to him. “How so?”
“Fat.”
Potter was already tucking into the cake, dessert first like a giant child, and Draco watched him, wondering how much he’d be able to finish. Perhaps Draco was imagining it, but Potter didn’t look as underfed as he had just a month ago: an observation that filled Draco with a strange, urgent feeling he didn’t want to examine too closely. Instead he stared as Potter polished off the cake and ate the two sugar cookies in rapid succession, then began twirling great forkfuls of pasta and shoveling them in. He always looked so serious and concentrated when he ate, slightly hunched as if someone were going to snatch it away from him.
“Ron’s a bit horrible, too.”
“I’m not sure you’ll be able to fit it all in, mate,” Ron said.
“Doubtful,” Harry said, smiling. “Considering I live in the old Black mansion.”
Molly appeared with two plates piled high with deviled eggs, which Draco and Harry took dutifully. Hermione appeared behind her, looking harried and happy.
“Malfoy…”
“Sir,” Wendy said. “With due respect, that’s your third cinnamon roll.”
Draco had planned to say something cutting and breezy about the thinness of Potter’s underfed frame, but instead he found himself saying, “I’m not like I was at school.”
Draco laughed helplessly, imagining Granger in her full Minister for Magic garb trying to talk Potter through one of the most basic sartorial charms in the book. Potter was grinning, watching Draco laugh. It took a moment for his mirth to subside and the basic facts of what Potter had said to sink in.
“I can’t remember the wand pattern to make it start,” Potter said. “And I’m too embarrassed to ask my secretary, I’ll never hear the end of it. I forgot my lunch again and now, no coffee…” He looked positively morose.
“Molly,” he said, “I was thinking, maybe you could give Draco the recipe for that onion soup I like?”
“No time like the present, I suppose,” Malfoy said, pulling on a pair of white gloves, and a moment later the vase itself appeared on the desk in front of him. Harry yelped and scooted back in his chair. “This may take a while,” Malfoy said, narrowing his eyes. “Here, you can have a snack if you get bored.”
Draco expected Potter say,
“I’m sure it’s not,” she said, still scrutinizing him. “You know, the last time we saw each other, you’d just saved my son’s life. And now you’re sleeping with him!”
“Yes sir!”
Draco considered. She had a point. “Very well, no tie.”
“I’ve put on another five kilos,” Harry said, red-faced.
“Let’s get the cheersing over with first,” Ron said, raising his glass of champagne, and they all clinked merrily and then sat down. True to his word, Ron set a bubbling shepherd’s pie down in front of Harry’s plate and then another between himself and Hermione. There was crusty bread, too, and buttered peas, and more champagne, and Harry thought he’d never been so happy.
“And for his next trick,” Ron said, handing Harry a massive slice of heavily-buttered bread, “he’ll disappear half a loaf of sourdough!”
Draco smiled tightly, waiting for her to state her business and hurry along, but she wasn’t done.
“What d’you mean, you should’ve guessed?”
He never should have mentioned it. “Now and again,” he hedged, though of course the real answer was yes, every day.
“Mr. Malfoy? Is there, er, something else you needed?”
Draco slumped down, forehead on Potter’s shoulder. “Merlin’s beard.”
It did sound good, even though Harry was technically stuffed silly right now. He climbed to his feet, one hand still soothingly cupping his protesting belly, waved to Ron, and managed not to splinch himself as he apparated into his bedroom at Grimauld place.
As if on cue, Ron called, “How you doing there, Harry? I didn’t give you too much, did I?”
“Ah,” Harry said. “Well, that’s –”
“A bit,” Harry agreed. “But I’m still rather hungry.”
“No, no, no,” Ron said. “You’re not sleeping here again, bugger off to your own house.”
“Oh god,” Pansy moaned.
“Oh, little things.” Draco was rubbing his knuckles up and down Harry’s side now. “You take up more space in bed, and now and then I’ll reach for you but find your belly’s in the way. I tried to sit on your lap the other day but it’s too small now to be comfortable – that belly again. And sometimes I’ll catch sight of you at work and I won’t recognize you. I’ll think, Merlin, look at that gut, and then I realize I’m looking at you.”
“I prefer the term encourager.”
“Gotta talk to you about something,” Harry said thickly.
“We share the break room with the aurors,” the little witch was saying. “Technically it’s in their department but they’re quite good about letting us use it whenever we want. Only…” she hesitated. “The Head Auror is – he’s a bit of a – a—”
“Little Lord Malfoy has fed my master very well,” Kreacher said, and Harry blushed. “Kreacher is not so talented as you are, no, not nearly, but Kreacher will do whatever he can to keep master fed.”
Harry laughed.
“Let me,” Draco said, masking his eagerness with impatience, and he handed Potter the whisky and slid beside him on the couch. Potter bit his lip but allowed Draco to carefully, so carefully, tug his shirt up to reveal the firm packed bulge of stomach that sat out over the waistband of the stretched trousers. The button was straining, and with as much gentleness as he could muster, Draco unfastened it. “These don’t look as if you’ve just stretched them.”
“Bill?” she said.
Harry and Draco grinned at each other. “I like everything,” Harry said.
“Draco, your mum’s met me. She’ll think I’m cursed if I go pure-soul on her.”
“Really?”
“The vase is safe in the department,” Malfoy said. “Why do they need an auror on it as well as a cursebreaker?”
But instead he sipped air and said, “Anything like – like you.”
When he’d finished, he slumped forward in his chair, elbows on the table, black hair hanging in his eyes. Even through the fabric of his shirt, Draco could see the slight outward bow of his flat belly, packed so full it was trying to expand its territory.
“Ah, well, good.”
“Are you gonna fuck her?” Draco asked.
Draco shifted so Harry would not feel the beginnings of his erection, but Harry laughed and pulled him closer.
“You most certainly can,” Draco said. “And what’s more, you will.”
Wendy closed the door on him. Potter rubbed the back of his neck and sighed, looking resigned.
“Wring my neck?”
“I’m still floored by how much weight you’ve put on,” Pansy said, who was herself sylph-thin and so blond she nearly glowed. “I saw you, when was it – six months ago? Seven? You were getting a bit of a belly but now it’s your main feature!”
“I’m not hungry,” Harry protested, but a tray of thickly-iced pumpkin bars had already appeared on the corner of Malfoy’s desk, well away from the vase. They smelled divine. Harry turned his head resolutely away, watching as Malfoy began gingerly moving his wand, teasing out a long shimmering thread and then vanishing it before beginning again. He was such an odd, graceful person, Malfoy was, every movement economical and calculated, down to the curve of his wrist and the tilt of his head. The old Malfoy was still in there, young and pointy and horrid, but he was such an adult now, his pointy features blunted by age until they came off as strong, not weak, his slim body firm with muscle, and so tall…
The server had collected the Muggle plastic and returned it without Draco’s noticing. Potter picked up a pen as if it weighed a great deal and painstakingly signed his name, then began the slow process of leveraging himself to his feet. He was hunched over a bit, protective of his food-filled stomach, and as they left the restaurant Draco found himself hovering a protective hand across Potter’s lower back.
