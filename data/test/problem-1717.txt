"Yes well… It's regarding the day the Potter boy ran away from his home. About a month ago? That entire show he threw about Dementors attacking him," the man gestures wildly with his hands and chuckles, staring at Shacklebolt to do the same. Kingsley flashes a dim smile and Fudge stills, clearing his throat before tapping his desk.
He sleeps, but Draco has to stay awake. He slept about three hours last night. His body aches fiercely. His eyes burn. He can’t sleep.
“Leave, Nott.” Severus takes vindictive pleasure in seeing Nott’s scowl as he is interrupted again. There is relief too, if he’d just started, there is a possibility that Potter might not be completely incapacitated.
He feels it in his blood, the happiness, the morbid amusement at the pathetic vermins surrounding him, at the ones lying on the floor, one dead and one wishing he were.
"I'm alright. It's fine, shhh," he tiptoes to the kitchen, not quite sure why he's being so paranoid as he passes his cupboard and faces the Dursleys living room. He locks the backdoor and closes all the curtains. He's scared. It takes him a while to accept that. His skin still feels clammy and cold.
"Nobody looks happy about that," Hermione says as she glances at the staff table, noticing, maybe not for the first time, how vacant it seemed. More than half of the staff is absent from the table, with the exception of McGonagall and Snape. And neither looked happy to be there. These past two days haven't been easy on anyone.
He's been taking charge all day, just a calm constant as Draco panicked over the smallest things. Harry just stayed calm and collected. He found them food and water.
"You abducted Harry Potter and the son of a fellow Death Eater, one with a much higher ranking than yours,
He makes his way down the stairs, aimlessly. He doesn't know what he wants to do, but he sure as hell isn't going back to sleep. Somehow he feels this part of his nights has been easier to deal with at the Dursleys. There he knew he was locked up with nowhere to go… here, he'd rather die but stay in that room.
Several papers from different publications lay strewn around the breakfast table, each said the same thing. Even the Quibbler isn't exempt from the general outrage and utter disbelief that plagued the papers.
As Draco sets the kettle to boil he realizes that he has more in common with these birds than he had realized. They're both being domesticized, and what's worse… Draco doesn't mind this.
“Perfect,” he whispers, and it is. Out of every kiss he’s ever had with anyone, Harry’s kiss is something they never could have compared with. He’d never thought kisses could feel so good. The circumstances around all dictate that this should be his worst possible kiss ever. But it isn’t. He couldn’t have asked for a better kiss.
Ron almost rolls his eyes, trust Harry to look a gift horse in the mouth, "Your blood relatives just died, I know you hated them, so did I, but for your own sake, just take this without complaining. You do deserve a day off, without that hag Umbridge honing down on you."
Harry reaches out a tentative hand to unwrap his shoulder, the robe is almost completely soaked through with blood. But before he can touch him, Draco’s hand shoots out to grab Harry’s wrist, “Just-” he gasps out at Harry’s startled face, “Just give me a second.”
Severus sometimes thinks Morris had it easy. Following his loved one into death. Maybe not soon, but soon enough. To not live long enough to see all these failures pile up, to see the Dark Lord rise again.
Chapter warnings for; explicit language, blood, violence, implied/referred torture and implied/references self harm/suicide.
Severus wants to laugh. Of course, they had to make things difficult. So damn complicated. One last fuck you to Albus for dragging them into this mess.
Draco knows better. He always does. They both need this, he hates thinking of this as splurging, he winces because this should be nothing. This is just fucking ice cream.
He kneels down beside Potter, who is still except for the tremors that wrack his body, eyes half-lidded as he stares at Severus in stark terror and… determination. “Potter, can you hear me?” he murmurs.
It’s nine now. Curfew time. Maybe he will wait ten more minutes to see if Potter turns up. He hasn't really figured out why is he even doing this in the first place. When discovery means certain torture and probable death. Discovery by certain individuals, at least.
He imagines that, since the start of the year, he had lost more than a pint of blood to this quill. He could have easily felt better if he had donated the same amount instead of it being tortured out of him. There's no way he can stop this now. At this point, she won't even need to make up a reason for assigning him detentions. She's the Headmistress now, she can make a whole decree just for Harry.
"If that wouldn't be too much trouble," says Severus, who as far as Draco is concerned abhors such trivial gatherings with a passion that rivals his hatred for stupidity.
"If the muggle says we don't have it, thank him after you look around a little, then get out. If he does have that… just look at the jar for a minute then tell him it's not the type you want."
His sudden but strong hatred feels like the same rush of feelings, those few times he's been on the Knight Bus. And he’d always hated it, and Severus, who was the only one even allowing him on the damned thing, hated that
. And he should have been screaming long ago, given the state he is in, there was no way he could have stayed so silent, and it had been so
He finally stows his wand away, relaxing; if only marginally. He almost looks lost for a second, but then walks over to a cabinet in the kitchen with purpose. He pulls it open, and even though he
Hermione hums. "We've heard Sirius mention it in passing. He doesn't like talking about his past much. He talks about you a lot, though."
The nightmare is so fresh before his eyes, it feels as if he's walking into the dream and not by the shore. The sand is the mounts of bodies and the sea is the blood. Harry can smell it thick in the air.
And suddenly, he can breathe again. He's standing on solid ground again and he trips. And would have fallen face-first on the ground if not for the hand that wraps around his arm to steady him.
It takes everything out of Harry not to pale as the woman mentions Sirius's name. "Yes, I did know that."
“Harry,” Draco says, breaking off a bite sized piece from the sandwich, “Eat.” When he is halfway through the sandwich, Harry makes a gesture with his hands, insisting he can feed himself. Draco is skeptical, but still places the other half in his shaky hands before moving onto his own.
Sirius turns away from him and bends over to pick up a bottle from the coffee table, "Stop making sense," he chugs the bottle down, "Dammit, Remy," the clattering sound is loud in the room as he slams it back down on the table.
“No, I don’t think it works like that. He didn’t bite you last night and these are shallow wounds, not deep enough for a werewolf’s nails to really get in there, and it wasn’t even the full moon.”
"Pain relievers. This is good," Harry carefully picks up the lilac-coloured vial and hands it to Draco.
He is the boy who lived (a very heavy title and responsibility for a boy his age) and he has endured so many things happening to him at once. There's an appalling lack of a stable authority figure in his life, a parental figure on whom he can lean against and trust. An adult who knows what to do.
Draco. Harry can only think about one person at that moment and it's maddeningly Draco. He wanted to kiss Harry, he cooked for Harry, slept with Harry, comforted Harry…
"Harry?" Sirius asks once he sits back on his chair, this time scooting a little closer to Harry. "Why don't you just munch on this," he hands Harry the ruined chocolate. "And we explain everything, alright? I know you're tired-"
"Oh look at that," Harry mutters and lets go of his hand. Draco wants to mourn the loss, or better yet, reclaim Harry's hand, but the boy is looking at the glass panel behind the chairs.
He might have felt guilty for hiding something this big from Harry, but given the circumstances and Harry’s ridiculous guilt complex, he can’t find it in himself. He still doesn’t know what the curse is. If it’s reversible. How it’s reversible. It
"Do you know what happened to Harry?" Someone else asks, Hermione whips her head in their general direction, but then more voices join in.
His hands, Severus notices with some satisfaction, actually shake a little less than they did the last time he'd seen them. Not by a wide margin, but noticeable to the observing eye. Though the boy might not have noticed it himself. Potter is fidgeting under his stare now.
"So you did." She drops her chin on the back of her hands, and Harry takes a deep breath. The cats meow on the walls. "Did it make you wonder why Albus Dumbledore, who seemed quite taken with you, was assisting your parent's killer behind your back?"
"Here," she shoves the egg bowl into his hands. "Be quick, boy. Vernon likes his breakfast after reading the paper."
"I'm sure, whatever he feels, I don't want to go back to that game again. I want to let myself feel, for once. I think I'm done not facing the world," his eyes prickle a little.
The dementor leans in with no hesitation, its rotting leathery breath brushing against Harry's face as it leans into his mouth. It freezes his blood, numbs his mind, and Harry can't breathe, he cannot breathe under the pressure and the distinct familiarity of this feeling. His body hadn't forgotten this, it had dreaded it since the day he's last experienced it.
“Listen to me very carefully, Potter,” he says as he starts to furiously dab the blood away with the wet flannel Potter had already dipped in the bowl. He cannot afford to use direct magic on it, too risky. Nott played them dirty, of course that babbling dweeb wasn't known for his intelligence, but using such a dark curse in proximity to Potter while being aware of the boy's importance to the dark lord spoke of a new low.
Fudge opens his mouth for a beat and then occupies it with another nervous sip of his tea. The cup clatters against the china saucer with a loud 'clink'.
"We'll find Tattershall, it can't be that far. He can help us, and…" he runs his hand through Draco's hair, and he feels so fucking guilty for enjoying it, and being calmed by it. "And even if he doesn't, we'll think of something. I promise."
Severus puts his mug down in place, passively scanning the room to catch several heads bobbing in agreement. Minerva still seethes in her seat as the others settle into trial activities such as mass grading their papers, and quipping between themselves.
Minerva glares at him in a way that would have made a student cry, and then turns away. Tensed. Enraged. Severus has seen that look on her only a few times before. "They're slandering my student and the Headmaster of the most prestigious school in the entirety of the Scottish Isles. I don't see how you could be calm. You have to refute this, of course…"
Their lives were now at stake, every time Harry was not consciously aware of his surroundings, it wasn't just their dinner burning.
"I'd imagine yes," Fudge pointlessly flips a book close and then leans back in his seat. "Crime does seem to skyrocket particularly in September,"
The door screeches loudly as they push it open, and Draco’s mouth tightens in a grimace. He half expects the door to fall off on them, and wouldn’t that be great.
Harry throws Draco a small smile over his shoulder, it's dimmed but reassuring, Draco hates himself for feeling its warmth.
Harry holds onto the walls as he walks, and after a while he hears whispering. Unintelligible, hissing sounds that he can't decipher, can't even tell the direction of. It's as if he's standing in the middle of a crowd, but doesn't speak their language.
"His shoulder is more urgent though, isn't it?” Harry says, frowning, “It's been five days, the wound hasn't even closed, I change the bandages three times a day, per your instructions… nothing seems to change." Harry had been worse than Draco about his wound, constantly fretting about the bleeding, hovering like a mother hen. It drove Draco up the wall, but, and he would never admit that to Harry, it also made him feel not so wretched to be worried about.
He summons his potions kit while waving his wand in a simple diagnostic charm. Albus’ breathing is shallow and loud, which Severus tries to ignore.
He crashes onto his knees on landing, and hears Harry cry out, landing on his hands and knees beside him. Draco thinks he fucked up, Harry’s injured, he’s splinched and bleeding out and Draco fucked up because he can’t do a single thing right.
Harry doesn't take the bait. "Do the others know I'm alright? Sirius, and Remus and my friends. Do they know I'm alive?"
step outside the wards, no further than a hundred yards around the cottage. You’ll step out and you will be found sooner than you can say the word ‘snitch’.”
So while he wasn’t really beat up about the muggles as he was listening to McGonagall, he is concerned about how Harry’s going to take it. He hates them too, he must have on some level, but what Ron really cares about is whether that hate is gonna amount to Harry’s locked up pile of emotions that he never talked about or is it going to float over his head like Cedric’s ghost. He wonders whether their deaths are causing more harm than good, and then he wishes that he had maimed those bastards himself.
"Too many failures, too many shortcomings, Evan, I'm disappointed," Evan feels the tip of the Snake's tail brushing against his hip and he
"You have the intelligence of a toad, Dolohov," Rosier sneers, his mouth dramatically curled down to show his displeasure with the other man as he rolls on the heels of his feet to face him.
Harry snuggles back into Draco as gently as he can, mindful of both their injuries. He stares up at the plain ceiling so he doesn’t have to look at Sirius, the light fixtures casting a dull glare over everything.
Mrs. Weasley sends Ron and Hermione trailing in front of Harry in a walk of shame, with Ron holding a plate for Harry if he 'happens to be hungry' later. They don't try talking to Harry, as if they know better than that, and Harry's glad. He might have let out the remaining dredges of his anger on them if they did.
Draco has practised his best pompous expression before in his head. "Two sundaes, if you would please."
Selfish wants win out in the end and he makes his way over to the astronomy tower. Draco really knows his potions. Or healing. Or whatever. Harry doesn't need a label for what Malfoy is doing. The boy himself had named it 'Blackmailing' and Harry refused to see it for what it was. 'Helping'.
“C’mon,” he grits his teeth and manages to stand, Harry wringing his hands beside him. Draco puts one arm around Harry’s and the boy manages not to crumple under him.
"You seem awfully composed for someone whose relatives are dead." Draco finally makes his hand move, turning the gauze several times around his hand before cutting off the rest of the roll.  He very pointedly refuses to think about how much of a wreck he was, still is over his mother’s death. That was for the Draco from ‘Before’ to deal with.
His stomach is churning violently, even though he’s already emptied it. His innards are trying to turn themselves inside out. His stomach wants to come out of his body and walk away as if it could quit its job.
"We're being used as manual labor, Hermione. You're just drooling because Sirius said you could use the books if you helped in the cleaning,"
“I found Potter’s.” He says, holding the two wands in his hand. Severus stares for a moment, before inclining his head, he takes the offered wands and puts them away.
“Harry…” Draco’s voice is strangled, he takes a step towards him, Harry’s head snaps up to him, and then to his hands. Upon finding them empty, the panic starts receding, but he doesn’t get up.
Draco shakes his head to dispel the rebelling words as he pulls the now empty bottle away from Potter’s face. Who seems slightly more lucid than before.
He's never seen the old man look so weak and frail, he’d never seen him beg before this either. Albus Dumbledore had always seemed like this all-powerful, untouchable, unpassable, all-knowing figure. Being in his confidence had done nothing to assuage that image.
"He's right, we kept asking them what was going on and they didn't tell us anything, and everyone was just freaking out, Sirius was beside himself… he couldn't contact Remus or get any news from anyone… it was a mess." Hermione finishes lamely, slumping on the bed.
The bathroom is quiet as he enters, he looks around for a minute, almost waiting for Malfoy to jump out at him. But there is no one here. He removes his Cloak all the way and quietly calls out, “Myrtle?”
'Kiddo.' Sirius steps closer, and if he were real Harry might have actually felt his breath against his face. 'Focus,'
"Actually, no. I just thought I would replace my father one day. It doesn't leave any room for other career prospects,” Draco shrugs, but Harry knows grief when he sees it. Draco quickly changes focus.  “You?” He lights up, “Wait! Let me guess… Quidditch player."
"This is outrageous!" a clenched fist comes down upon the staff table, rattling cups and clinking the silverware. Severus Snape calmly regards the snarling woman, as Albus does the same.
Draco wants to keep a hand on his shoulder, to comfort Harry, but he can’t bring himself to. So he just stands a couple steps away, looking at him helplessly. “Harry, I’m so sorry. I was just startled. You’re safe here, I wasn’t going to do anything.”
Before he can experience a full-blown freakout, Harry shrugs his hand out of Draco's and reaches into his coat pocket, where the wallet is.
"Of course you wouldn't,” he turns away from her back, rolling his aching shoulders, “She might as well be a quill to you. I hope she stays well, she and your brat."
"Harry," he calls louder, minutes later, fixedly staring at Potter as the boy stares at his lap, this time wincing as the action pulls at the scabs on his face. He reaches a hand and physically shakes the boy's shoulder. He doesn't feel intrusive, or uncomfortably self conscious as he does this. He hadn't considered touching Harry to startle him out of his ' mindset' and the fact that Potter's warm skin shifts under his fingers at last is such a blissful relief.
There’s a small curl of displeasure on Harry’s mouth. “And if I have to tell you this one more time, I swear to Merlin, Ron I'm gonna drop a spider in your underpants."
"What is this?" A third voice rings out, a very wretched, familiar voice. Harry's blood runs cold. Neither he nor Malfoy turn. But they don't need to.
Severus grits his teeth, and contains the urge to growl. Potter has been tortured, for two straight days, Severus is not going to snap at him right after. "We really don't have time for this, Potter." he says instead. "Just for once in your life, listen to me without asking incessant questions. I will answer each and every one of them once we're out of here, we have a very limited time slot and if you keep--"
They pass the street, making a swift turn, before Remus stops before a set of matching houses, right in the middle of the street. He reaches a hand in his pocket and pulls out a piece of torn parchment.
Ron and Hermione have been growing up with Harry since they were eleven, They KNOW some habits of Harry's are a result of childhood or Hogwarts trauma, and they know that some of these habits might be harmful.
Harry turns, against every nerve in his body that screamed at him to stay, and mechanically makes his way to the spiral stairs that lead down the tower.
Moody's fake eye swivels unnervingly as he stares at Bill. "The same way he knew his way to the kitchen?"
"And can you fathom what's worse, Evan?" comes the gentle coo in sync with Nagini's flickering tongue near Evan's neck, right where Voldemort's foot rested only a minute ago. Evan weeps.
Ron waits for the right time to approach Harry, about eight in the evening that night after they've already had dinner and Hermione has gone off to her dorm to nap, something about a stomach cramp, Ron keeps in mind to bring her something from his secret chocolate frog stash tomorrow morning, that would improve her mood a lot.
Harry is frowning in her direction, as if he can’t quite figure out what a house elf is doing in there. To be quite honest, Draco can’t either. Death Eaters aren’t known to show this kind of hospitality to their prisoners, especially since both their deaths are kind of guaranteed in two days.
“Okay,” Potter says, his voice soft as he goes back to staring at Draco. Draco groans a little, slightly shifts. The wind chime tinkles away in the background. Severus can’t bring himself to even feel irritated by it right now.
Harry bites his lips as he leans down the counter to speak to the ticket guy. Some man in his middle thirties, dressed in a dark blue uniform who looks just about done with the world.
Time passes. He keeps writing. Umbridge has gone back to some paperwork by now, so at least she isn’t staring at him. There is the steady scratch of his quill on the bloodied parchment, and the turning of Umbridge’s papers, along with the clock on her desk which is ticking at a steady rhythm. A few cats purr on the wall.
Draco mulls over this as he gathers his empty vials into his school bag, and vanishes the bloodied rags, he thinks about how Potter is nothing like he had thought he’d be in the last few years.
He's content, with Draco finally getting some rest, with them safe and warm and not freezing to death.
In the memory, he's lying flat against the grass, his small body shivering under the lashing rain. The cut on his head keeps bleeding in rushing rivulets under the droplets.
"You make tiny disasters in your head.” Draco takes Harry’s hands, “It's going to be fine. No one is going to die because we stole a wallet from them. Harry, no one carries their entire wealth in a wallet… or coin sack or whatever."
again. The hand drags him harder, throwing hasty glances over his broad shoulders. Harry tries to yank his arm away again.
‘She is only eight, Lucius,’ Draco could practically hear his mother rolling her eyes. ‘I think Valentina would wait a few years before handing her a dagger and letting her into the wild,’
Hands close around his chest from behind, and Harry gasps, rough fingers pull him up by his hair and the other hand moves to his mouth, muffling his angry cries.
Sirius sneers, an ugly expression. Sirius is supposed to represent the good things. If everything had gone right. If. If. If.
"Trust me, Remus," Ron says, "that means she's got everything figured out. We both do. We've been planning this for days, and we have a list of suggestive spells that we thought you could look over--"
His vision swims a little, and he glances up. He doesn't have time to curse himself, as he sees Umbridge sending a jinx at Potter, Draco quickly shouts 'Protego!", sending a shield propelling in front of the other boy, stopping him from collapsing.
Harry jumps off of a very familiar rooftop, his action is NOT intended as suicide, but rather the consequences is treated as such. If this is triggering to you in any way, feel free to skip the last section of this chapter. We want you guys to feel safe!
"Malfoy and I should be going now," he says it mostly for the other boy's sake, but Umbridge clicks her tongue once more. The sound makes Harry want to wriggle in discomfort.
Severus takes Draco’s left hand in his and touches the tip of his wand to the back of it. Draco winces when a stinging pain erupts there for a second as Severus nicks a shallow tiny stripe of skin from the flesh and quickly drops it in the potion, before closing the wound. He gently swirls the vial and the murky blue colour changes to a deep blood red.
Umbridge rests her wand against Draco's cheek, and he lets out a strangled noise. The touch repels him, disgusts him, and he wants it
“The most I, or anyone for that matter, could give you at this stage is nerve soothing agents,” Severus hesitates, wondering if he really needs to tell Potter this, but then the boy looks up at him with those eyes, looking so stoic even as he trembles, even as his eyes betray his fear. All he sees for a beat is Lily's eyes, staring at him across the room in an order meeting, a fussy baby on her lap, she was furiously determined. Afraid and determined at once.
She doesn't show any indication that this might be strange, her words are spoken as if telling him something as mundane as time, not inviting him to her office past curfew after she specifically told the only other witness that she was taking him to his dorms.
on Nott’s advancing form that was advancing on Lucius, and cringing as the man hollers profanities, he dangles in the air upside down.
He hates admitting how helpful it is. Well, Malfoy, really. Who made it possible. Malfoy whose mother was dead. And Harry had seen it happen.
This time he doesn’t have to search for his wand, quickly grabbing it off the table, he mutters the spell, fully intending to just grab Harry, warn him about the wards and fuck off.
"They're organizing a resistance group," Remus continues. Not exactly a resistance group, per se. Hermione had stressed upon that fact a lot. But Sirius would probably be more interested in a  resistance than a secret study group.
Heart in his throat, he makes quick work of pulling off the well-worn steel-tipped boots from Rosier’s limp feet. He carefully does not look up from them. Or tries not to. His eyes snag on a piece of wood lying next to Rosier. A familiar piece of wood, now.
deserve to know?! Do you have ANY idea how hard it's been for me?! I was scared and alone, and… and you couldn't care enough to tell me that you were together the whole time? You couldn't bother writing something more than 'We're alive, don't you flip out' and just expect me to sit in my place like a good little boy until you’d bother coming for me-"
Harry sends a stinging hex towards Umbridge, and Draco doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. A stinging hex, what the fuck is wrong with Potter? His fingers strain to grab the freaking wand.
Kingsley leans down over his own parchment, his brows knitted in concentration. "Tonks?" he doesn't look up. "You still haven't handed in your report."
"They'll win in a second." Harry reaches for his mug, clenches his hand, and then holds it out for Draco. "I'm just realistic."
He finally finds his voice, and it sounds weird coming out of his mouth as he speaks, “What’s happening?” And then he remembers another thing, something from the note, this place is a headquarters? “What’s the Order of the- the Phoenix? Why am I here? And why was there a Dementor-”
Harry regards Bill with narrowed eyes. "Maybe," he finally admits. "But I actually should be heading upstairs."
There's a roll of gauze in his hand, and Draco closes his fingers around the bundle and Harry's fingers.
“What else is there to do between torture and cleaning up each other’s wounds?” Put that way, it makes everything sound even more terrible. This time, the scowl comes easy.
There are faded posters stuck to the narrow walls, aged over time in a way that indicates they're part of them now, and cannot be separated, there are whispers within the breaks, damp and wheezing. Anything and everything can be found here.
Once again, he raises his hand to call for a house elf and some god damned snacks, but Hermione clears her throat.
Harry lifts up his chin, "I don't think I've ever met anyone as real. And if he's real, then so am I. I feel real." It’s a funny conversation, Harry thinks. Even by his standards. Both he and Sirius ignore what the other is saying, despite being part of the same mind. He wonders how this would’ve gone in his head if he were normal.
"I'm booked for the day, baby," the man winks at him, unfazed, "Me and this beer bottle have a getaway plan."
"From the garbage?" Draco hates himself for sounding like a fucking child. Especially when Harry's face contorts for half a second before smoothing out.
'How many steps is a yard?” Sirius asks. He keeps distracting Harry. Which means Harry is just distracting himself, he shouldn’t- he can’t. “I'm not sure you understand this game well enough. Let's go back, let's wake Draco.'
"Tattershall," Draco squints at the map, tries his best not to look intimidated by the small dots and the overabundance of names and places and signs. He doesn't know what half of them mean.
It is true. Valentina wasn't the sort of bitch, the dark lord just kept hanging off his arm. She is as much a snake as Nagini is to him. Precise and vicious. Evan is more than sure that the whore has at least some poison on her person right now.
"During times such as these," Moody sounds just as gruff as he always does, but his voice still sounds oddly strained. "Constant vigilance is even more important than ever!"
Harry scoffs in response. "Some of us have high endurance," he says with a mask of dignity, settling down the slight tremor in his hands by gripping the edge of the counter.
Draco gently coaxes the bag out of Harry's grasp, rolls up the coat, and the shirt into a tight roll, and places it under the vials so they don't break.
He never seems to do anything, does he? No matter how hard he tries, the people he ends up caring about suffer the most horrific fates.
It has taken spending so long in the ‘After’ not to stiffen. He makes himself give her a nasty smile, and lets her arm go, taking a step back and straightening up.
A sense of wrongness permeates from the air, the same one that the Manor’s ballroom seemed to have been seeped in for weeks after his mother was murdered there.
He shakes his head as if to dislodge the thought, and turns on the tap, letting the cool water run over his hand. “Just wanted to say hi.” He refuses to look up at the mirror and see his reflection, which could no doubt give Malfoy a run for his money.
They are two fifteen year olds, who still don't quite understand that Harry is struggling with a dissociative mental disorder and maladaptive daydreaming. Harry, as a result of his childhood/Hogwarts trauma DOES in fact need special and constant attention.
Harry doesn't know why he is privy to this sudden piece of gossip. Marge must have called when Harry was out working, the Dursleys usually never bother telling him about their plans.
Then the door blasts open, and Harry gapes at the three people in the room. The phrase 'deer in headlights' has never fit anyone better.
"How do I know you're Remus, though?" He abruptly says, raising his wand again. The thought had come to him suddenly, and it leaves him feeling cold and scared again, even though he did his best to keep his face carefully blank.
Before he can come up with any offensive spell in his panic-induced state, Val speaks up, “No, lower the wand right now, Draco. I wasn't hurting him."
None of the machines are working, they look gigantic, infused in the walls, surrounding them from all sides.
"No!” Draco says quickly, “I mean, yes. Yes, we can be friends, no,” Draco wants to smack himself, “Not can, we are. We are friends, Potter." He clears his throat at the end, as if it would make him any less of a bumbling fool.
Severus can barely keep Albus upright, and his eyes still haven’t adjusted to the dim light of the cottage after the fiendfyre inferno of the cave. He shudders, remembering the sheer power Albus had wielded despite being poisoned.
The idea makes him pause. God, what is he doing? He could be walking right into the Dark Lord’s arms. Severus was right, he is too attached to Potter.
"Harry here is somewhat of a rebel," Tonks drawls with a teasing smile at Harry as if expecting him to shout 'GUILTY!' with a grin of his own. Instead, Harry's face goes blank for a moment, and then he slowly nods along as he replays Tonks saying something similar in his bedroom. Quickly turning around to look for the glasses, Harry bites his lower lip. He hasn't been in this kitchen long enough to know where they kept the cutlery.
"What the fuck is going on?" Harry's question is followed by several indignant noises, mainly from Mrs. Weasley and Remus but Harry barely hears them over the sound of his blood rushing in his ears, the roaring downs out everything else, everything but his own blinding rage.
"Potter, what are you talking about?" Severus' voice came out sharper than intended, and Potter rears back in his chair for a moment, before forging on with vehemence.
Twinky disappears and Harry sags down once more. Lately, it takes so much effort to stay upright, and Harry would much rather lie down, with his eyes closed and his mind not concerned by anything. He wants the luxury of laying around and doing nothing, but with Draco’s condition and his own predicament, he doubts he’ll ever get to have such a thing.
Malfoy is unrolling the gauze right now, and Harry watches him, secretly marveling at his unhurried expression. This is the last time he'll ever see Malfoy like this again. Harry discreetly mourns the loss for a reason he himself is unaware of. Malfoy's eyes flick over to the already murky bowl, tainted with blood, and he frowns. He grips Harry's wrist again and pulls it out. Harry almost protests at the loss of Murtlap essence, but then Draco speaks.
"Don't tell me," Harry pulls him off the hard cold chair, and eases the bag off his shoulder. "Let's go."
Severus gives no warning as he starts tipping the contents of the vial onto his shoulder in a small trickle, and Draco's eyes water at the burning sting. He tries glaring at Severys for the lack of a heads up, but he's too busy clutching at his discarded shirt to keep from crying out.
He barely has time to lift his wand, let alone put up a shield himself, when she says, her voice impossibly stable and vindictive, "Crucio,"
"Do help yourself to some scones," The man says, his plump face testimony of how tasty said scones are supposed to be. John politely shakes his head and takes out his parchment from his dragon-leather messenger bag. It was a gift from Anna for their tenth year anniversary and John hadn't stopped using it since.
The voice is too close, so close that Harry feels the person's breath against the back of his neck. He jerks, no one had been around when the Dementors attacked, much less someone who can see Harry pathetically losing to a magical creature. A hand clamps around his arm in an almost bruising grip, it belongs to the same person, and it hauls him up, almost dragging on his knees. Harry quickly grasps the broken remnants of his glasses in his hand, stumbling.
“Completely numbs the pain in my chest and cheek, and the shoulder is a fierce throb, but not unbearable burning.”
A huge thanks to our Beta, and we hope you like this chapter! Things are looking pretty bleak for our characters here.
Harry pulls out the dittany vial, which is slightly bigger than the others, and another pain reliever. His hand, then pauses inside the bag and Draco narrows his eyes.
you pull off poaching chicken, until then the gulls get your share. Besides it's too cold for them outside."
"I hope so," he tightens his fingers around Draco’s as much as he can. Which isn’t much, but Draco squeezes back.
The small hall-if it could even be called that- is lit only by a dirty overhead light casting a yellow glow over the room. The sound of the lashing rain is overbearing in the background.
A bit of the potion dribbles down his cheeks and Severus is just about to spell it directly into his stomach when Potter’s grip tightens on it and his head lifts up a fraction. Severus nods.
Harry doesn’t let him fall and the pain fades back to an almost manageable level eventually. And eventually lasts longer than he really wants to admit. His vision feels permanently tunnelled, edged with darkness. His breaths are laboured and he can feel Harry vibrating against him.
"You bitch!" Rosier cries, repeatedly slamming Harry's head back against the floor. Harry cries out in pain but jerks his knee up right into the man's shins.
Draco looks at him, he knows Harry's lying. Of course, he is. Because the truth is, Harry has no way of knowing what will happen if left alone. Something could happen, and Harry knows firsthand just how shitty their luck is. Kidnapping, torture, blood and all those niceties.
Of course, it doesn't, he realises with a sinking feeling in his chest. The Dursleys have locked him in again.
"We can use the cup," he says, as he carefully splits the muffin in two, he keeps the part with the wrapper, the side that touched the transfer for himself, and hands Draco the top part.
We were so happy about every single response we got for this story, and are so excited to share this chapter with you today.
"No one is aware of the instructions. None of my vials have been missing either. Trust me, Potter, no one can make this poison the way I do. I recognize my work."
Just like the corpse of the man next to him, mocking him with his gaping mouth and glassy eyes. Evan cannot hear what the body might be chanting, his ears are whistling so loudly in his head that he cannot even hear what his master is drawling over his head.
Has he passed out again? Potter looks dangerously pale, and his hand seems almost bloodier than usual. Merlin, how can one lose this much blood and still be alive.
The boy crosses his arms for dramatic effect, but he's shaking too badly to impose a threatening image. "It doesn't matter." he says. "I just do. Draco begged you and you did nothing. I don't trust you." he adds that last bit as an afterthought.
Potter, in spite of seeming that he very well realizes that fact, still lashes his wand at her "Confringo!"
"When you're dripping all over the school's bathroom, it is. I happen to care about the sanitation of this place, I’m a prefect, you know."
“I don’t blame you for this, Harry.” The name sounds weird on his tongue, he hasn’t really ever used it, “I forced you into it.”
"I created this poison, it's a slow-acting one,” Severus is speaking, “subtle enough to slip right past any skilled healer."
"What else am I supposed to do, Molly?!" Sirius yells back at Mrs. Weasley who has a steaming pot trailing behind her, her wand suspending it in the air, out of the way.
"I wanted this too,” Harry pats his hand thoughtfully, “I never knew I wanted it with you, never in a million years. But, yeah. Also, you're nowhere near a sewage rat. You're like a tiger, if we're in the realm of animal symbolism."
"I liked it there. It was small, quiet and warm. They turned the lights off, so it was dark too and it was… Just me. Me being with myself. I liked that."
Harry’s gaze on him is growing concerned and it’s making Draco itch. He’s the one who should be concerned for Harry, not the other way round. They haven’t had anything to eat, or drink, just walking for hours and hours.
“Okay,” Harry whispers, his hand giving a small awkward pat to Draco’s back. “Okay, I am going to remove the cloak now, Draco. Alright?”
“Master Lucius also told Twinky to be giving you some-” she looks even more scared than before as she quickly blurts out, “Food. But he says not to let anyone know.” she's not looking at them, at his face, or Harry's body.
"And you do know that,” Ron bites his lips for a second, “That I didn't mean to say those things last night either? You know I say a lot of shitty stuff when I'm angry."
Harry willingly goes along, drowning out the questions in his head. This man saved him just now, questions can wait for a little while. Just a little.
His mind goes blank for one terrifying moment. The man peers at him and Draco clears his throat again, "Do you have pickled garlic?"
"For what it's worth, I'm glad the muggles are gone,” Harry looks up at him at that, mildly surprised, and Ron grins toothily back at him, “Personally speaking.” he shrugs, “That fat pig of a cousin always irked me."
He could be alive right now only to die in the two-minute delay it takes for Draco to run to the cottage.
In the middle of that quarrel, Pomona makes a sympathetic noise in her throat. "I feel bad for Potter," she says with a shake of her head. "His name is getting dragged in the mud left and right… and with his relatives’ deaths? Poor lad."
"Potter, nerve damage isn't…” Severus hesitates, “There is bound to be chronic pain, pins and needles, some people have mentioned short stabbing sensation in the damaged area. I just assumed, given the amount of damage your body took…" Draco winces. As if being tortured wasn’t enough. You have to live with the pain for the rest of your life too.
Draco can barely speak through the pain, but he doesn’t need to. Harry is already pulling out the dark cloak. He very gently, worried eyes bearing into Draco’s, tries wrapping it around his shoulder.
Harry stares at him and finally sees the third person push past Moody with a jovial grin. "Hi there, Harry!" the short woman with pink bubblegum hair waves at him but then walks right past him to the front door with her wand pointed to the locks.
"So you do not believe that Harry Potter's relatives were specifically targeted to send out a clear message?"
"Then what would you call this incident? It seems that the targets were ambushed in a muggle mall, there are claims of a dark mark hovering over the bodies for hours, and Obliviators were sent to the scene."
"This is delicious," Harry says, licking his spoon. What was his obsession with licking stuff in front of him? It’s like he deliberately wants Draco to get a hard-on in public places.
There's an uncharacteristic pause, and Rosier's hand moves away from his face. There's a dim whistling in Harry's ears.
He still remembers the way the man's bones felt under his foot, the way they shattered and gave away, blooming a spurt of blood and an animalistic cry of anguish. Harry has never been disgusted with himself more. Not even in Dumbledore's office, in the instant that he learned of his relatives' demise and was immediately flooded by relief. He can almost still smell all the blood.
"A tiger?" Draco asks absently, too busy relishing in the way Harry snuggles up to him. God forbid, anyone, particularly his classmates catching him
He steps out of the fireplace, dusting himself off, barely glances around the study as his eyes land on the figure sitting behind the desk. Lucius’ cane is resting against his chair and he has two wands in his lap as he stares at Severus impassively.
"She's just doing it because there's a meeting," Fred stage-whispers to his twin and he nods fervently.
Draco sneers at himself. It's not about the alcohol. Of course, it's not fucking about that. Potter hates him. He rejected him, pulled away and ran from Draco. To get away from him.
"Don't distract me, please." There's a mental count, in his head, one step after the other, sinking into the cold sand, as the wind muses his hair. The moon is full.
"I won't have to," She smiles at him, sweetly. Disgustingly. "You'd be dead before you find out, wouldn't you?"
Eyes widening, he grabs his wand off the bedside table. He’s probably overreacting. But it’s better to be safe than sorry. Overreaction is better than under preparation.
The memory is clear in his head, despite his apian fixation dying out years ago. One of his best memories. His mother and father, and the bees. The hives built like houses, and the smell of blooming flowers. If he tries hard enough, he’d even be able to recall the exact buzz of the bees. The better the image the better the apparation.
Harry has no idea why he just blurted out such a thing. It is true, what he said, he's tried it out himself quite a few times, mostly when he cannot sleep. But that still doesn't tell Harry why Draco Malfoy is privy to that information now.
, that’s what his father would say. Don’t let her know. And money can open so many doors. A door to a muggle motel room? HE shouldn’t even have to try. "We are in a pinch, ma'am. I am willing to compensate for any trouble this might cause. We're just staying the night."
"Hem. Hem," There's that irritating clearing of her throat and Harry pauses four words and two letters in, five vowels and nine consonants. He looks up.
'You can't keep avoiding me,' Sirius says, and Harry turns his head towards him, reigning back a sigh.
Harry loops a finger under the floorboard and pulls. "Something like that," he mutters and pulls his cloak into his arms just as Remus bustles into his room as well, Harry's trunk floating behind him.
He pulls the door open, a scowl on his face, which falls off as quickly as it had come, jaw slackening at the sight in front of him. Before he can even process what he is seeing, his hands are one Potter full. He stumbles under the sudden weight, but quickly regains composure, taking a second to lock the door behind him as he props Potter up by the wall again.
Draco can't get them out of his head. Those two pesky, little worms. Granger with her bushy hair everywhere and Weasley… just being his insufferable self. Them crowding Harry, with their annoying voices and annoying faces and their intolerable existence.
Apparently, they've been doing this every week with Minerva. Remus imagines how hard that must be, turning them down every day.
, do you hear me?” Severus doesn’t look up from his work as he speaks, and it's an effort to keep his own hands steady. The adrenaline rush is tapering down.
"Why are you helping me?" he asks. He’s finally lowered his wand, but he can feel the ornate handle leaving indents in his palm as he holds it, trying to let it anchor him.
Here's the second interlude! Next week, 18th June, Friday, will be our chapter update, so stay tuned and have fun fellas!
As soon as he's in, Harry feels a rush of adrenaline course into his veins, and he slams the door shut, hastily locking the wall chain and leaning back against the door as if trying to physically block any intruders from barging in.
‘I’ll take you to a magical theme park sometime, ask the real, less gorgeous version of me, and if he isn’t too much of an idiot, he’ll arrange something.’
Harry wakes up at the crack of dawn each morning, or correction, he resumes being awake at the crack of dawn each morning. Draco knows that the other boy isn't getting much sleep during the nights, even though they share a sleeping place, and Draco's dreams are dramatically milder in comparison to Potter's inner fight every time he closes his eyes. Draco actually doesn't know a whole lot about Harry’s sleeping habit beyond the fact that he's a blanket hog.
Draco, of course, cannot answer, and only grumbles in response before slumping back down on the ground into another restless slumber. Meanwhile, Harry spends his time slumped against the wall, nerves frayed from more than just the cruciatus.
slashing him. He doesn't want to contemplate the outcomes. The full moons. And whether he has to go through an immeasurable amount of pain every single month. That is, if he gets to live after two days.
Harry clenches his teeth, and then slowly loosens his jaw, counting backwards from twenty. "He's kind of like you, but different. He's real, Sirius. I swear to God, he is so real. I don't think--"
Belatedly, he realises he’s still got Harry’s wrist in his grasp. But he doesn’t let go just yet. It’s warm, his wrist, which should be impossible because Draco’s own hand is ice cold. He can feel the pulse thumping unsteadily beneath his fingers.
Draco knows how this goes. Fire purified. This is not going to be pleasant. It's going to be extremely painful and Draco abhors pain.
He gets to work quickly, but tenderly, as he wipes down more blood. It hurts a lot more than his cheek did, perhaps because there’s more blood, perhaps because it didn’t receive the treatment last night.
"I'm not a squealing pig hiding behind people." Potter finally says, slowly, his eyes cold and his face slack. "You are. You and your racist ass hiding behind your father and his name, 'my father this' and 'my father that'…" he continues in a high pitched voice, a crude exaggerated version of Draco's own. Potter's nose wrinkles. "Well news flash, Malfoy," He spits. "He's
There’s no buzzing of the bees. There’s no smell of flowers. There’s just weeds around them, unkempt and wild. Overgrown and twisted, broken fences. There’s the splintered remains of a few hives, the smell of rotting wood filling Draco’s nose.
"How did you not breathe once during that sentence?" He is truly astonished by Potter's lung capacity, more so than his ability to ramble on about anything and everything, Draco is more than certain that any lackadaisical word can set Harry off for hours and hours if prompted. It's somewhat impressive and surprisingly not annoying in the least.
This all happened in one night. He made Harry dinner. He almost kissed Harry at dinner. Harry was taken. Draco found him because he always will. They kissed. They kissed and Harry likes him back.
It feels like it goes on for eternity, just on and off, on and off again, before the doors of the crypt slam into the walls and Harry rolls away, the crash sending his heart thudding even louder than before.
Only as he looks down at the dark blue grass crunching beneath his feet, does Harry realize that this place might be the most magical place he has ever been to, and the irony of it, the fact that the most magical place he has ever seen only exists in a distant place that is only in his head, is not lost on him.
Sometimes, he also wonders whether the whole thing in the graveyard too had been nothing but a nightmare. Maybe Voldemort isn't back. Maybe everything is just an awfully long dream.
"I fire-called Albus," Arthur Weasley is shouting now too. "Shacklebolt sent him a Patronus, the situation is under control,"
"Come closer, Evan," his Lord commands, and Evan does, ignoring the way Nagini is coiled around the marble throne, lethargically hissing at Evan as he strides to kneel before his Lord's feet. The snake's face is close enough for him to sense the rotting odor of death clinging to her like a cloak.
It's like being squeezed through a narrow tube, it's disorienting and everything is blurry for a moment. Harry screams but can't hear a thing over the high whistling in his ears.
This is the man who’d defeated Grindelwald in a duel, Severus reminds himself, watching as Albus shivers and groans. He sets the man down on a couch, where he slumps nervelessly.
Draco moves towards them, pouring half a glass of water for Harry, “C’mon Harry. She won’t hurt you, I’ve known her all my life,” he mumbles.
So, two pieces of toast, a couple of spoonfuls of peanut butter jar, and exactly three stripes of bacon...that's all he's getting. Hedwig flaps her wings and settles on Harry's shoulder once more, nibbling on his ear as Harry surveys the food with narrowed eyes.
"Oh, if only mom knew," Bill laughs and then leans back in his seat. "You don't have to be in such a hurry, it's not like we're gonna kill you or anything,"
How is Harry functioning at all without any pain relievers? After being tortured for so long? “At all?"
Then he hears the door creaking open, and freezes. Somehow, even Myrtle remains quiet, looking at the opening door.
This only makes Harry more sick, and he gives up on breakfast, he pushes the bowl away and wriggles to make some room between his two friends, squashing him between themselves as they're quietly discussing the paper still.
Ron's eyes narrow into a glare, "You're treating us like she does," he says in an overly accusing tone, "We're going to do this you know, whether you want us to or not."
Harry's body hates him for having to endure this again. And it curses Harry as vehemently as Harry screams.
Harry almost has an intimate moment with the asphalt before Remus tugs him back up, steadying him on his feet before looking around.
“It’ll be okay,” That’s what Harry tells him, surprisingly, as Draco’s desperate gaze comes back to him. They both know who Bella is really here to torment. Harry seems as if he wants to say more but by then Bella is already in the cell, a stone cold look on her face as she dispassionately points her wand at Harry and the screaming starts anew.
"I have him. You were so good to me, for so long,” Harry smiles, “I love you. You are my childhood, and my comfort… but he is--” He glances down at their intertwined hands, “--my love. He is real. When he kisses me, I feel like a good person."
He doesn't even notice or acknowledge Draco putting the coat on him, and quickly changing his own shirt.
"Why--" Potter's lip curls. "Why are you helping us?" The boy looks so genuinely confused that Severus is almost offended.
They abandon the alleyway and walk, it's cloudy above their heads, and the neon lights flicker all around them, the pavement is damp.
"They're people," Harry doesn't sound frustrated, not even annoyed. Just tired. So tired that he might fall asleep on the spot and Draco does
“How’s this place not discreet?” Draco interrupts sharply before Harry can open his mouth. This place wasn't compromised, not as far as he knew anyway.
"Yeah, it is," Draco says, but unlike Harry, he is not admiring the buildings and the neat streets, but rather Harry's face.
was kidnapping a fifteen-year-old boy, and I don't see one hiding in your robes now," Rosier looks around. "The order found out. There's a mole in the ministry, either that or your snitch is compromised."
The best Severus can do right now is keep another actual infection out, while also counteracting the effects of the curse which causes blood poisoning on top of everything else. He pulls out the advanced brew of dittany that he had perfected throughout the years and hands four full vials to Potter.
The voices are nearly deafening, and Harry stumbles back into Remus's chest and Hedwig's cage as people bustle around, shouting and causing mayhem.
"I'm not a ministry fanatic secretary, obsessed with pink, Ron. I'm just worried about you guys. This could backfire terribly."
What in the actual world ran through Draco's mind when he stood to kiss Harry Potter? What witchcraft compelled him to spend his nights in the same bed as the boy, and enjoy it, and what force is pushing him to pursue Harry time after time?
"Have our own methods. Don't worry about it." He brushes him off, "I'll consult with Poppy over your file. Maybe allergies are at play. Brighten up, Potter."
Sirius deflates at that, back to his lazy sprawl on the couch which is giving Remus a backache just by watching. "Ginger and brunette Lily."
He shivers in the cool breeze before his head whips around towards the backdoor. Harry isn’t on the porch, but the door is half ajar. Heart in his throat, he quickly pads over outside, frantically looking around.
One would think with the events of last year and all the shit he went through they'd be more… attentive. Harry knows that they are, which makes the whole situation even stranger. He's worried about them. He's mad at them too. But he's mostly worried. He won't admit to himself how mad he is at them. Not until he knows the facts, anyway. So for now, he settles on being worried.
"Did you learn nothing," she says, her eyes taking on a malicious glint, and dread pools in Draco's gut, "from your mother?"
Draco murmurs his assent as he twists open the cap and scoops up a fingerful of the clear gel, slowly and carefully applying it to one of the cuts on his abdomen. It was wonderfully cool against his still slightly heated skin.
Potter looks resigned as he opens his mouth, bringing his left hand up to steady the vial as he drinks it. The colour is finally returning to his face. He still looks too pale, but at least his skin doesn’t have that sickly grey pallor anymore.
"I'm sorry, I know," then he purses his lips, and amends, "No, I don't actually know that, just, ignore me. Sorry."
His lord is displeased. Evan cannot blame him, he is displeased with himself, with the Malfoy family's ongoing betrayals. With the failure in his mission.
No, he couldn’t rely on Valentina, the butcher, the Knight, he can’t rely on her generosity to get Harry out of this alive. He should just be grateful she didn’t murder them all last night.
He doesn’t know how Harry’s walking right now. He’s seen the boy’s legs shaking, the way they sometimes seem to buckle under their own weight, no warming. The way Harry cries out and scrambles for purchase. He’s massaged those legs himself, on a few occasions.
“Oh no. No, no.” If Harry had been having trouble breathing before, he definitely can’t breathe now.
Malfoy's mother had been killed. And Voldemort sure didn't seem pleased by him or his father either. From the urgency with which Malfoy had asked Harry not to tell anyone about it, Harry could only imagine what horrors he'd been promised.
Mrs. Malfoy was being killed, brutally murdered. Harry had seen it happen, every second of it, with his own eyes, which were so absurdly, so horrifically, so inexplicably and uncontrollably narrowed in
Draco groans once more and Harry swears, struggling to get on his knees before the boy. He has been an idiot. He’s been so worried and preoccupied with his own torture, and the werewolf thing that he completely forgot about infections.
Dear nyx, thank you for reading our story and liking it! We are beyond elated that you enjoy reading it. We're also very glad that you felt comfortable enough to share your experience with us regarding the matter. Good friends are miracle savers in our lives, they truly are, and finding the good ones is never easy.
With one last gasping heave he sits back on his heels and looks around the darkened bathroom, his chest slightly heaving as he pants for breath and listens to the silent sounds of the cottage. He feels satisfied, unimaginably, and heinously satisfied with what he had done to Lucius and Rosier.
" she says and Harry takes the quill, his hand already throbbing in sympathy of what is about to come. The quill rolls between his fingers, and Harry has the sudden urge to think whether he can stab her with the quill. The image is violent and bloodied, but surprisingly neither deter his daydreaming. He wants to see her in pain.
he thinks. But he's glad that none of his screams had disturbed Ron. Or anyone else, for that matter.
"And it's not our fault either," Ron says. "It just had to happen. We're sorry that we were cooped here and you were with the muggles, if it's any consolation, I don't think we had that much fun either...the other day I cleaned so much that I couldn't feel my hands for the rest of it."
Then as an afterthought, he hands in the wands in his pocket over as well. "Do you understand, Potter?"
The fourth revelation reaches Harry when he’s mere seconds away from passing out for real. And it’s the most haunting one so far. It’s quite simple too. Harry’s body, or anybody’s body for that matter, does not keep a memory of pain. Not even an aftereffect. Once they stop and leave, Harry is going to forget. It’s a horrifying truth, that one can forget this kind of pain. How anyone could ever forget. But he will, his body won’t, not in the physical sense of the word, he would be shaking as if he were having an earthquake for some time, maybe even the rest of his life, but the pain? It’ll be gone, nothing but a memory until they decide to come back again.
The weather keeps getting colder, and Harry decides it's time he got back to Privet Drive. He frowns as he walks. It's only July, normally by this time of the month even asphalt starts baking in the streets.
And even if this is the last thing his godfather would think of saying, who cares? This is Harry's game, Harry's rules. In this alternate world that didn't include weeding the lawn under the scorching sun, Sirius is the cool fun godfather, and Harry loves him anyway. And Sirius loves him too, for him, and not James's phantom that takes the shape of Harry's body.
"I have a point. Sirius, you weren't just an Auror, you were one of the best. Even Moody cannot deny that. What you teach them will do more than teach them how to fight.” He grabs the bottle and pushes it out of reach as Sirius tries to grab it again, “It'll save their lives."
"I had high hopes for you," the foot is moving down to his windpipe and Evan chokes on his own blood, his feet writhing and his arms uselessly flapping. He can barely make sense of the words that are coming out of his Lord's mouth.
Draco keeps breathing and Harry shakily follows, Draco’s own breathing eases a little, “You need to actually hold it in your chest for a second,” Harry huffs in response. “Don’t just huff and puff, Potter,” Draco snaps and Harry glares at him, but obliges.
"Yes, thank you,” Draco says sharply, watching as Harry scrawls the name Larry in such a sloppy script it’s little more than chicken scratch. “How much is the fare?"
Harry's entire being is taken over with pain. A very familiar pain. He screams and his nerves contort, singing and twisting and
The bathroom is filled with steam and the water is starting to run cold. Running his hands through his hair one last time, he reaches forward and turns off the tap. His shoulder aches fiercely but the pain in his chest is too profound for any other aches to be significant.
The bench isn't comfortable, but he could sleep here if he wanted to. It's in the open, and that somehow feels better. And maybe, just maybe, he won't have a nightmare for once. He laughs at his own joke. Then abruptly stops when he realizes how pathetic it is making him look. Sitting in a vacant park, laughing at something only he knows.
'You can't dream anymore. That is a big fucking deal,’ Sirius runs his eyes over Draco, ‘He's asleep… you need to--'
It's Tonks and Bill, he realises. The voices are more discernible now, and he can make out what they're saying.
It's pathetic to admit that he had no friends, to begin with, and perhaps, even more pathetic to consider his parents (and previously Severus) as friends in the first place.
They would have to synchronize four individual schedule, right under Umbridge's eyes, with a number of people that is just beyond risky. The more the people, the more is the chance of some child tattling.
Even though Valentina just helped them, she’s still a Death Eater, one of Voldemort’s best. And it could just be a trap. She told him not to use magic.
The feeling is foreign to him, almost, the only instances of his scar hurting had been during his first year, during his entanglement with Quirrel and the Philosopher's stone, and even then the pain hadn't reached this intensity when Voldemort had touched him through Quirrel's body, that was mild, compared to that
“Okay, okay.” Harry’s voice has gotten shakier, which doesn’t seem like a good sign. He lifts his head off of Harry's chest and looks at his pale face. “You need to, um, remove your sweater.”
"You don't really have a choice in that regard," Draco says, a warm fuzzy feeling growing in his chest. It feels like a hug and drinking tea next to a fireplace and being wrapped in a blanket.
Sirius watches them blankly for a second, before registering what Ron had just said, "Not with that attitude, Ginger. If you guys want to be me, then you have to cut out your old selves and start soaking up the room energy. Do you feel it? The amazingness of this?"
"Yes?" he says aloud and Umbridge leans on her desk, her ugly cardigan pulling tighter as she drops some of her weight on her linked hands.
Potter is frowning now, his eyes half open and glazed over. “It’s just a blood replenisher, Potter. Surely, even someone as incompetent in Potions as you should know what it is supposed to do.”
“Potter, there are always other factors to be considered, now, if you don’t have a death wish, come here.” Potter’s still looking at him suspiciously, and without his glasses, Severus can clearly see his wide and slightly glazed over eyes.
Father gave him Mother's wand. With a lump in his throat, he gives it a small swish. A cool wind breezes through the room and he shivers.
The fade to black didn't involve penetrative sex, as we have not tagged this fic as underage, HOWEVER sexual intercourse occurred and will be talked about in the following chapter.
“He’s burning up! It’s an infection, not a scraped knee. Infection kills, I don’t know why or how, but I know that much. Infection kills. What do I do,”
"Be careful," Harry says as one of the creatures croons under Potter's shaking hand, "Or I'll teach them how to peck the hell out of you."
"Can you um-" Potter's gestures at his flushed face and red-rimmed eyes and Severus rolls his eyes before swishing his wand over the boy's face.
Because he cannot, not even in the furthest corners of his mind, imagine a way out of this, he cannot feel his hands, he cannot find his wand even though it's right in his pockets. Everything is too dim, under a moving veil of blackness. And it all feels numb from the cold. Even his mind. His thoughts are lethargic, hesitant. He had felt like this before.
"Even though we invented it on the spot and Harry might have no idea what we're talking about," Ron interjected with a wince.
Draco finds himself nodding even though he doesn't fucking mean it. He just hates seeing Harry so upset
"How do you know that?" Severus knows for certain that Draco would never divulge that information to another living soul. Much less Potter.
"Fuck you," he gasps, unclenching his throbbing hands. He can't even feel them through the stabbing pain.
“Okay.” Determination and panic are both equally prominent on his face as Harry grips at Draco’s arms to keep him upright, “Okay, what do we do, then?”
"We weren't hiding things from you on purpose Harry-" Sirius begins but before he can say anything else, the door opens behind him and there's a loud clatter and muttered curse, and suddenly chaos begins anew.
"I received a letter this morning, it seemed a bit disconcerting," Fudge was spinning his bowler hat in his hands, almost looking nervous.
“Draco, Draco, oh my god,” Harry says, almost hovering if not for the fact that his hands are shaking violently, that he too is flopped on the ground. “Draco, you’re bleeding, your shoulder. God, Draco, what do I do? Tell me what to do!”
It was new and eccentric and Draco's mind latched on immediately. Even after the hand was rejected and his intrigue twisted into strong dislike.
But if it isn’t a joke, then it means Harry has been taken. He's been taken from right under his nose, and Draco hadn't known. Hadn't heard anything.
It takes him a while to realize that the reason why his hearing is impaired, is because they have been clogged by his blood. His Lord stands over him, unimpressed by Evan's hoarse screaming and useless thrashing, as if he was expecting better, then flicks his wand and Evan's ears clear with a painful pop.
"It's okay," Harry leans forward, kisses him on the cheek, and his lips, unlike the rest of his body, are warm, and soft, not chapped and dry like Draco's. Harry hugs him, he's careful with his shoulder, he smells like trees (and blood), and Draco buries his face, his cold, ugly, chapped face in the crook of Harry's neck.
The boy in question is in the kitchen right now, banging the cupboard doors and rummaging around, seemingly overly comfortable in the small, but cozy kitchen. Five days have passed, and neither of them has stepped outside the cottage yet. Not even to the porch. Harry tends to glance through the back door or stare at the serene waves outside their windows, but he hasn't even once mentioned strolling outside.
"Harry?" asks Mrs. Weasley, exchanging an uneasy glance with her husband. "Maybe we should call Poppy and-"
The only person happy with this transition, is surely Black, and his goons. Because that daft man believes that having another person trapped in a cage with him would relieve him of his depression. But it wouldn't. It would perish Potter.
Potter doesn’t say anything as Draco takes his hand out of the now murky liquid. At the first touch of the gauze against his cuts, he hisses a little, and Draco makes sure his next movements are slower and gentler. Not much, though. He doesn’t care as long as Potter stays alive, after all.
"Honestly," Draco had told him this morning, "Fuck Severus. But let's cut him some slack for being a control freak. He saved our lives."
"Harry,” he says, a little desperately, he needs to know what it is. He has to know if he can fix this. “Harry, listen to me," he grabs Harry’s arm and the boy pauses.
“They’re… they’re too big,” Harry protests, half-hearted at best. Draco notices with distant satisfaction that his grip has tightened on his wand. At least he won't lose it. Hopefully.
Harry gulps, clenches his hands and looks at Draco again, he cannot freak out, he wants to, really really wants to but he won't, because for the second time in his life,  he feels as if a force he can only describe as ‘Draco Malfoy’ had sneaked up on him on his rooftop once more. He's on the rooftop, not in the cell, the wind whips against his face and his hands aren't shaking. He's standing on the ledge, only an inch away, the crowd bustling beneath his feet before the force suddenly propels Harry off the rooftop again, and this time, instead of falling headfirst into an endless sea of crowds, Harry isn’t falling at all. Instead, he is in a place he has never been before.
Swallowing hard, Harry firmly- or as firmly as he can- shakes Draco. Draco’s lips part and he lets out a small groan, but otherwise doesn’t break. Harry moves his hand to his cheek and almost flinches back.
The crack that resounds in the cell is almost inaudible. Harry doesn't care anyway. His sole attention is focused on Draco.
"Mr. Potter," she nods as Harry stops before her desk, his hands carefully and steadily lax, dangling freely by his sides, even the right one that's still stinging.
Draco's first impulse, right in tandem with his panicking, is to cast the spell again, to get to where Harry is as fast as possible.
Attached to the flimsy page and messy handwriting, is a folded parchment, browned around the edges, the ink almost faded;
"You don't have to be scared if you don't run your mouth, Rosier," she says, he can't see the curl of her mouth under the metallic mask but he knows it's there.
Lucius Malfoy died in an instant, much quicker than Mrs. Malfoy's messy, heartbreaking death. Harry had killed the man himself, with a careless flick of his wand that first paralyzed the man, and then tore through his head, spattering blood and brain matter on the floor. Dead. All those lives, in the palm of his hands.
"Get up! Now, you little twerp." He strides to Harry, bends down to grab him by his hair again but Harry is prepared. He surges back and yanks Rosier's leg with him, sprawling the man on the ground with a yelp.
He almost hopes the other boy would jump out of the non-existent shadows with a ‘boo!’ and laughter.
Rosier seems nonplussed by the exchange, as he reaches for the floo powder and inches Potter closer to the fireplace. "Hand him over," he says to Umbridge and the woman squeaks indignantly. "What?!"
Harry lets Hedwig hop on the kitchen table with a chuckle. Aunt Petunia would have kittens if she saw Hedwig on her pristine tablecloth now, preening her feathers. The image satisfies him, even if the feeling is short-lived and fleeting.
To what point? His mind argues. The Dark Lord killed his mother. Draco would rather die than serve that monster.
They searched. They did. Albus has been doing it for months, every nook and cranny, every mattress and pillowcase, because Morris told him, to his face with venomous words, “I have what he gave me,”
He lets out a slow breath. Harry’s alive. Not gone or taken or dead. In the far end of the barn doing-- What is he doing?
"We're so lucky we have matches," he mumbles and Draco tries not to whimper in pain. It comes and goes in varying waves and he's about to faint. He might.
He just has to remain alert. He would be able to at least get out of there if something happens. He doesn't know what could possibly go wrong with serving detention at least two hours after the curfew, but he also wouldn't dismiss every fiber of his being that screams that something will. Draco is going to be ready for it.
The boy shrugs. "Kind of. I wouldn't know, I wasn't around uncultured wizarding families. You should ask your friends."
"Even if I did," Harry says with absolute conviction, "I would have chosen to hang out with you, Draco. You're a good friend."
Blinking back the blurriness furiously, he shakes his head hard. He can't afford to think like that right now. Everyone he knows is in danger. He can't just isolate himself and live somewhere in a hole.
This chapter has one of our ABSOLUTE favorite scenes in this story. We adored writing it, and we hope you like reading it too! Thanks a bunch to our Beta~
Sirius looks away and flops his head back down on the armrest, "I also skinny-dipped in frothy chocolate foam that same year."
Murphy raises his bushy grey eyebrows. "Are you daft, Shacklebolt?" The man snaps. "We're on the brink of war, boy. The ministry should be declaring a national emergency,"
Chapter warnings for; explicit language, description of injury, mentions of character death and torture.
"I don't know!” Harry exclaims with a snort, “I've never had a boyfriend before. Or a girlfriend… or I don't know.” Harry bites his lip, “Noodle?"
"Aren't they insufferable?" The words are just blurted out, "I mean, constantly sticking by your side, constantly talking and arguing and Granger comes with her own warning--"
"I read it in the papers," he didn't. Remus came to him, dragged him out of bed, pulled him in the corner of the common room, and rapidly fired off the facts at Harry's face before claiming that he had to leave. It left Harry feeling very put out, and slightly shaken.
"Stop teasing him," Tonks finally says, as she sees Harry's shoulders tense, "It's four in the morning, let him be."
Albus calmly blinks. "I happen to agree with Poppy on this matter, Minerva. I've rarely seen you this peeved after reading the Daily Prophet."
We shouldn't hurt other people with our words, nor actions, in any way. Please be kind to each other, and choose the people who influence you wisely.
There is a foolish voice in Draco's head that just likes hearing Potter talk, regardless of the words or their meanings, a very tiny minority that secretly revels in the sound of Harry's voice, the way the words are formed in his mouth, and more absurdly, the way Harry says his name. Draco chains that voice to the most obfuscating corner of his mind.
The first five minutes were always vital, in every task imaginable, Lucius knew that once they were managed, then the rest of the task was easily determined. And as Rosier, that slimy wriggling creature, had manhandled his son and Potter down to the dungeons, Lucius was left alone in his office once again, and he hadn't wasted any time. He swiftly walked back to his desk, leaned his cane against the chair and opened the second left drawer. The golden quill lay innocuously, rolling as the drawer was opened. He had taken it and snatched the parchment he was attempting to write a letter upon only a few minutes prior to the entire mess. He had kept the words brief and simple;
With a frown, and his mouth curled down, Harry wrenches the worn gardening gloves off his hands and dumps them in the weed-filled bucket. He feels hot and dizzy, both indicative signs of spending too much time under the sun. He should probably go and cool down before his brain fries.
"What if the people who lost the money really needed it?" he twists his fingers in his lap. He’s starting to feel really guilty about the ice cream now.
“No,” Albus whispers, and Severus’ heart sinks. The locket opens with a soft click, and it's… Just that. A locket, with a piece of yellowing paper folded into a tiny square inside.
The ice cream store was pretty close to the train station, but funnily enough, the bus station isn't as close as they thought.
It's cloudy, not quite cold enough to rain, but Harry feels the crispness in the air and dreads the next twenty-four hours as he downs his last vial of nerve soother.
Twinky shakes her head vigorously and comes to stand near Draco’s head, meekly inspecting the boy’s sweat coated face as she wrestles with her pillowcase. “Twinky hears Mr. Harry Potter sir calling and Twinky goes to Master, for permission! And Master says that to help if Young Master is being in danger or Young Harry Potter is dying.”
Harry reaches the door, his cold fingers wrapping around the doorknob, twisting. Even that small task takes so much effort.
It’s this fourth one, that pushes Harry down and he finally lets his conscious mind leap out of his grasp.
with it, Potter,” Severus says dryly, “I'm a potion master, I have my own set of responsibilities. Brewing advanced poisons is one of them."
“Severus, now!” Lucius’s voice cuts through the air as he ducks, his cane clattering to the floor as he whips his wand out. Severus quickly darts about, grabbing Draco by his arm and pushing him towards the fireplace while Lucius sends a curse after Rosier, making him dive away.
He stops the torture curse and Harry arches his back. There's no curse but the pain stays. The pain is dormant. Soaked into his bones.
"Snape!” Sirius raises his voice, “Do you think I'm going to take that bastard's word over my own eyes?” He stands up, then. “He's alone. And he's afraid, and he's in pain and I-” he chokes, and then continues more quietly, “And I cannot help him."
"Oh just let him have it," Draco cuts the man off and stands as well, grabbing his empty plate to discard it off in the sink. "He made a lot of boiled carrots."
Severus has a stony expression on his face as he asks, speaking before Harry has a chance to say anything, "What's this?"
from the vice-like grip of guilt on his heart whenever he thinks of Cedric and his lifeless eyes, the Dursleys, the utter, bone-deep, crippling loneliness he has been feeling all summer. Away. Away. Away.
"Right, Adams." Shacklebolt shakes his head. "You may leave my office." He doesn't need people from other departments snooping on them and seeing them in disarray.
He toes the edge of his left shoe with his right, and distracts Rosier with his hands, scratching the hands holding him, hard enough to hopefully draw blood. And he does, but Rosier doesn't even flinch.
He’s pretty certain the last person Harry wants to see right now is Draco, but he also knows how he can get in these situations. If he somehow went outside the wards--
"Er, no sir." The man says, looking wildly out of place, Futternic almost runs right into him, sending him leaning on a stack of papers. "I'm from the magical mishaps department?" The man says, throwing a glance at the passing woman. "Minister Fudge wants to see you, sir."
"Constant vigilance, Potter! I'm glad someone has it," he says in a gruff voice, nodding to the wand Harry is still holding in his hand, poised and ready to attack.
With a wave of his wand, the Death Eater garb he is wearing vanishes, leaving him in his usual clothes. It doesn't help make him feel better.
Harry ignores the pain seizing his fingers into stillness, flexes them and then reaches for the bag's strap. He hasn't looked over Dumbledore's diary in a while. They were too busy not dying, and now that he has time, he might as well.
Draco quickly unshrinks a small bowl he had brought with him, and dumps the Murtlap essence in it, before gently lowering Potter’s hand into it. He is still disturbingly still, too.
Either in his career. Or his life. Severus, while unabashedly confident in his abilities, as a dueler, and a Slytherin, really has no qualms about the odds of failure stacked against him. Of course, all might end well if he goes according to the carefully crafted plan.
He ponders on what it'll feel like. To be snuffed out of existence. Not death, but complete obliteration. Getting kissed.
"Just a reminder," Harry breathes, "We don't have a space for wasting in our budget. They're not just gonna--"
"Sure thing, sugar,” she says, and opens up a register, picking up a pen that’s chained to her desk. “Are your parents on their way as well?"
Chapter warnings for; torture (not explicit), child abuse(not explicit), explicit language, violence, and disturbing themes.
"Somebody shut up that damned portrait!" shouts another voice. Younger and feminine. It's Ginny, Harry thinks.
Her cruciatus wasn't as strong as Aunt Bella. It wasn't, he knows it. His limbs aren't shaking as violently as they had the last time, and he can
“Just breathe like I am!” He dramatically inhales, and huffs out. He does it again and again, and Harry’s eyes, instead of the wand, are now trained on him. That should be as good a sign as any.
"The harder you fight me the worse your punishment will be!" Umbridge snarls at him, "Our Lord will not remain merciful forever, Draco!"
Hermione knew a lot of Gryffindors would be here today, and she knew about Luna and Zabini. But this? Almost the entire pub is filled with them. It’s making her nervous and giddy at the same time. They’re a suspicious bunch, a mismatched group of children from all years and from all houses.
"Now he's tainted," Nagini's head bumps his chin. "He's stained by your magic, his mind could be corrupted beyond use, and that is all your fault."
Something is wrong. He knows it the instant he sees the door. Severus' head whips to the kitchen. There is food serving the table, stale food, untouched.
"It's such an open wound," Harry's fingers trace the air above his shoulder, but doesn't lay a single touch, "I can't use my wand. It's bleeding. Okay…" he closes his eyes, and he looks as if he's holding himself together for the sheer purpose of not scaring Draco.
Severus nods, "Anyone can be on the receiving end of it, even the brewer. Intelligent people would know, a sharp blade is only appreciated when it's pointed at the enemy."
Draco opens his mouth, incredulous, "You lived in the leaky Cauldron," the ice cream on his spoon is starting to drip.
Draco pushes open the bathroom door, illuminates it with a wave of his wand, and steps in, which results in him almost slipping and cracking his head open on the wet floor.
He can’t leave Harry alone. Not when this all is his fault. If he hadn’t so stupidly tried to kiss him, then Harry wouldn’t have run. If he hadn’t run, he wouldn’t have crossed the wards and gotten kidnapped. Harry could be suffering right now. Being tortured.
Twinky is still standing away from them, and he sighs. He doesn’t have the energy to make his way over. Harry isn’t even an option. “Come here.”
Draco doesn't understand that either. He has been brought up in wealth and aristocracy and blueblood societies since the moment he was born. Extravagance had very little meaning to him, or rather… The definition was a tad different from what others considered as 'too much'.
Harry's still mad at them, so even though he has missed the two of them all summer, he stifles the urge to gaze back, and instead pushes his food around sullenly, eyeing the burnt area on the table where his accidental magic had acted up. No one has bothered to fix it.
"We need to…" Harry muses, then his eyes narrow. Draco follows his gaze, to a small store with baskets set in front of it.
"Or he could be like… dead--" cold dread seeps into her stomach. She’s been wondering that too. She needs to focus, she can’t think about Harry, and where he is, and how he is right now. But no one lets her speak.
"If you're finished with your antics now," he inclines his head, and points his wand at Potter, levitating him as Umbridge heads to wrench Draco off the ground by his elbow.
He reaches the lower levels, near the cellar door, and that’s when he starts hearing the screaming. It is only with pragmatic practice years in the making that he doesn’t let his steps falter.
Unlike Aunt Petunia, he doesn’t imagine her without a mouth, rather, he imagines her without her whole face, just a void where it should be starting from the top of her head, and ending just above her thick, meaty neck. Without those beady little eyes, tracking his every movement, or those lips that simper so disgustingly.
There are so many things lining the tiny store shelves, Draco recognizes crisps and beans for some reason. The muggle behind the counter is old, staring right at him.
"Is he alright?" Sirius asks Remus who's still standing behind Harry. "Did you give him something? He looks pale."
"Yes, as am I. Well, that was all. Good luck with your work, Auror Shacklebolt. You may leave." He waves his hand at the door.
When he feels a hand on his shoulder, he startles. Badly. Bad enough that he jumps away with a snarl, and then his side bumps into the corner of the stool, making him gasp in pain. He looks up, Harry is backing away from him, hands up as if in surrender, or as if to placate him. Panic is creeping into his eyes as he keeps backtracking.
The elevator pings open and Kingsley is the first to step out, hearing Murphy grumble under his breath and two women in yellow robes get inside the elevator before it closes once again. The minister's floor mainly consists of the man's office and his secretary's, and so Kingsley walks up to the Secretary's desk in a looming silence.
"Stay. Here," He grits out. "Don't cast any magic, do you hear me? Just stay. Don't get out of the house premises. No matter what."
Had. He hates himself for switching to the past tense so readily, even though he knows father didn't have the smallest chance of survival.
Draco sighs, and nods. Quietly gulping down water, stopping himself from moaning in pleasure as the cool water slides down his sore throat. The soreness couldn't only be as a result of thirst. He probably has an impressive ring of bruises around his throat that attribute to the pain too.
"But you're not friends," Harry says, his mouth downturned and his eyes sort of pitying. Draco doesn’t care. He doesn't.
"We cannot let you do this without supervision," he says once he's finished looking over the parchments.
They have Potter, tucked away, safe and sound in a place where even flies can't pass in without being noticed. He is safe. He is protected. His
"Doesn't make me any less curious. What kind of a code name is Argent? He could have chosen something more badass."
" There is a scowl on Harry's face, which is decidedly more hostile than anything Harry could've made towards Severus.
Hedwig nibbles his hair, and affectionately rubs her face to his cheek. Harry sits on Uncle Vernon's chair, discontented by the ticking clock that's the only source of noise in the house. The soda stays unopened in his hands.
Bill and Charlie are sitting on either side of him, with the woman named Tonks and Ginny across him, Ginny is almost on the verge of passing out as she silently chortles at Tonks' impressions, Harry very pointedly ignores them too.
Logically he understands he can’t. He’s underage and they’re not warded here. But Rosier’s body is a few feet away from him, and there are tear tracks down Harry’s face. He’s trembling badly, the way he had when the poison’s effects had been at their worst.
"It feels like we've never been apart. It's like I've known you all my life." He stuffs another bit of ice cream in his mouth. And Draco stares. Harry’s halfway through his, but Draco has barely eaten two spoonfuls. He’s suddenly reminded of that day in Shell Cottage, sitting on the porch after a fight. Eating Harry’s mango ice cream.
"Do you see how this is different from Cedric?" Ron takes one out for himself too. Eating chocolate just after dinner is probably a bad idea, but damn him if he’s having this conversation without it.
Draco is surprised that the sole of his shoes hadn't given in yet. It's late in the afternoon, and his feet fucking hurt and there is nowhere to sit.
The breathing speeds up, dramatically advancing as Draco attempts to step closer, the blonde quickly reels back and drops the wand, almost completely on instinct. Harry’s eyes dart down with the wand and there they remain, as he slowly sinks down with it.
Harry hasn't heard of the man since the big scare the other day. He's still not quite sure of how it happened, but Remus appeared the night after, looking disgruntled and quite distressed as he pulled Harry aside and quietly told him that 'Yes, he's okay, and yes, it really was him, and no, he's not hurt, just shocked, '
Harry avoids his gaze, then opens the matchbox. "You could… lean your back to me. It'll be easier that way."
They're going to treat him and Draco like prisoners. Both boys will abhor it, Severus is damned sure of it. They will rot in that gloomy, rotten place. Just like Black is.
"This food is for me," Harry says as he picks up one of the toasts. Still, he gives Hedwig more than half of his breakfast, which was only the toast, and then sets her to go hunt in their backyard, wolfing down his breakfast in two bites. Two not very large and not very satisfying bites.
Harry tilts his head to the side, chewing on the inside of his cheeks. What was that about? He knows better than to ask, but he can’t help being curious. Draco looks a little unnerved, and Snape is still staring intently at Draco.
He screwed up. And Harry… Harry will never be his. In no world is that a viable option. Draco is a Malfoy and Harry Potter is the boy who lived. Sheer isolation made Draco believe in something that sounded so good but could not possibly take root.
"You're not supposed to address your elders or people with higher blood status or political standing without their official title. But Severus is my godfather. So I can abuse the system."
"He's holding me. I don't feel like everything is going to shit when he does that. He found me." And it wasn’t the first time either. He’d found him before too, bought him back from death, in that bathroom, all those weeks ago. Merlin, it feels like a lifetime. Draco’s always saving him.
Sirius ignores him, "--And Remus asked me whether I could help my kiddo's friends out and well?" He throws his hands up in mock defeat, "How could I refuse? My generosity knows no bounds."
"No, it's not!” Harry snaps, and then quickly softens his voice, “I swear I knew it. Um... something with S. Maybe,” he taps his chin, “We need to buy a map too."
He never unpacked his school trunk. That should make things easier. All he needs is some clothes, and his cloak that's wrapped around his photo album. The situation seems urgent enough that Harry doesn't think they'd question the padlocks on the cupboard at all.
He wishes he could do it now. Climb out of the window and get away. Far away from whatever he is feeling right now, the disturbingly vivid nightmare, the pain in his scar which always meant something is
"Be very careful about the words you're going to choose next, Potter." Draco has no qualms about hurting Potter, in fact, he has been craving to hurt
Harry pretends not to hear him again, he pulls out rolls of bandages, two out of the five Draco had packed. He wants to argue but Harry gives him a look. Then quickly leans for a kiss.
“I have my duty,” she says, looking like she opened her mouth with some difficulty, “and you have yours.” she looks strikingly like Valentina whenever her face hardens, the harsh cheekbones and the slightly pruned nose, and narrowed black eyes, but as far as Draco is aware, that’s where the resemblance ends.
"Hand it over and fetch me a quill, there should be an even distribution between defensive and offensive spells that you're allowed to teach," he's not aiding a prank, just damage control.
She leaps for him, her beak running through his messy hair and her wings flapping in front of his face, blocking his vision. She must have sensed his distress.
Valentina, the Knight, one of the Dark Lord’s best soldiers, an assassin and who knows what else, stands up to her full height. Her wand is gripped in her hand, but it’s not pointed at him. Or Harry.
"I'm starting not to,” Ron says, and Hermione elbows him. He lets out a small indignant squeak before saying, “So can you teach us?"
"Settle down," he says as he presses the back of his hand to Draco's glistening forehead. He's too warm for comfort. Severus has to take care of that after he has gotten the boys out of here. For now, a mild fever reducer would do.
His mouth is dry from thirst, well, at least partially from thirst. The only liquid they have are the potions in their bag, and he’s not willing to use them up anyway.
But before Harry can open his mouth once more, clanking sounds interrupt them, and the sharp clicks of high heels against the damp stones echo around their cell. Harry drops his eyes and gulps. Draco curses under his breath and scoots closer to Harry as Bellatrix finally comes into view.
But, given his luck, the wound itself throbs steadily in rhythm with his heartbeat. Sending waves of pain and nausea coursing through his veins.
Draco is sitting on the floor, twirling his wand around, and the rapid motions are causing small sparkles to fly from the tip in shapeless sprinkles. He doesn't acknowledge Harry's entry until Harry plops down next to him, wordlessly holding out his hand.
"We're here," Harry points at a star at the bottom of the map, "Warnham." He's on his knees on the chair, and leaning toward the glass.
From this chapter on, this story is going to take an even darker turn. Please read the warnings, and the tags carefully, as they aren’t put there lightly. Some of them might be triggering for some readers and we wouldn’t want to be the cause of that. We want everyone to look out after themselves and only proceed if they are comfortable.
Lucius Malfoy's eyes have blue flecks up close. Not just a dull gray, but actual vibrant tendrils of icy blue, now glazed and utterly emotionless.
"Whatever." Potter throws his hands up in exasperation, not understanding the severity of it, "That's not even the point! I know when it happened. It happened three nights ago, at midnight, didn't it?"
He has now read the same few lines about three times, and it still doesn't make much sense. His quill feels like it is about to splinter in his hand, and Severus closes his eyes, schooling his face into a cool mask as he drops down the essay in disgust.
"Yeah but still," Harry's green eyes are stitched to his behind his glasses, "Don't you miss them? Any of your friends?"
Draco groans, but tries to assist in the run, he looked confused before, but one affirmative order from Potter over his shoulder prompted Draco to blindly let Severus guide them through the maze of corridors to the main stairs leading up to the Manor. Severus doesn’t show much reaction to that other than raising his eyebrows. How much bonding have they had in two days?
"Don't make that face at me," Harry says with a grin, "you just don't know the pleasure of licking off food off your fingers, once you start... there's no stopping."
“Draco,” Harry sounds horrified but moves to pull him into a sitting position. “You’re fucking bleeding, we can't move you!”
"You may sit, Mr. Potter," Harry plops down in his seat, eyeing the black quill and the empty roll of parchment with slight dread.
He is in so much pain, that he is more than sure that his body isn't registering the majority out of sheer overwhelmed senses. He might die of shock right on the spot, except… his lord wouldn't allow that. Not just yet. If he wanted Evan dead, he would already be in the same predicament as Lucius Malfoy, or served as a meal to that hateful pet Snake.
Not technically a bit. It seemed as if his best friend has turned into a mobile whiskey bottle. Rude, drunk and abrasive.
Draco moves as close as he can, within an arm's distance of Harry. Harry has loosened his grip, and his trembling hands now rest upon bent knees. He is breathing on his own now, slowly and deeply, eyes shut, even the trembling is subtler.
"Potter, I need you to understand something, first and foremost. You. Weren't. There." Severus doesn't know when he stood up, but he is now standing, an arm's length away from Potter as the boy stares up at him, "Not when Narcissa was dying and not while Rosier was being punished. You never left this cottage or your home in Surrey, you never left your bed." Severus leans down, trying to drill the fact into Potter's head, "You seeing it from a certain point of view doesn't necessarily mean you are the wrongdoer."
"You failed in your mission," the foot lets up only for a moment before pressing down again with clear intent, Evan's face is purple and his hands, in spite of their burning agony are now clutching at his neck, intensifying the pain beyond a coherent measure. Too much is the answer.
Harry nods, "You were always there for me. But I can't play the game anymore, knowing that it wouldn't get me to him. I think… I think I love him."
There's commotion all around him, people bumping into other people as they all scramble to put some relief on their paper load, Futternic bustles around the cramped space, distributing coffee mugs and scones randomly to anyone who extends a hand out of their desk, Kingsley avoids her by a few inches as he races from stack to stack, waving his wand and organizing the cases.
"Harry," he carefully keeps his voice mellow and not askance. He wonders, idly if the other boy can hear him from wherever he currently is. Draco envies that Potter has the ability to be anywhere but in a cell, in Draco Malfoy's basement.
When he touches the doorknob, he's consumed by an irrational rush of fear that it would be locked. It can't be, of course not. No one here would lock him in, besides, Ron is here with him.
"Look into his cereal bowl!” he points towards the littered coffee table, “It's beer! Instead of milk. Remus was wrong about this--"
He hears Moody bark out a short laugh and tenses even further. Remus is staring at him tiredly, and says, "You can ask me a question, Harry. To prove that I really am Remus Lupin. Just please,
Draco is fine. Physically, way better than Harry. And mentally...well. All Draco has to show for his troubles is his mutilated shoulder.
He doesn't want to think about anything anymore, and Harry could do anything that he wanted. Draco doesn't care.
"I was so fucking worried, that you were dead or maimed or something that you weren’t telling me about. You didn't say a fucking THING! In those damn letters, and I kept wondering what I've done to deserve this! I've been miserable since the moment I got back to that place, I was nearly out of my mind! And you've been all here, all buddies having a laugh over me?"
'Go to sleep, kiddo,' comes Sirius's voice and Harry sighs, randomly heading down the corridor instead of his own room. Draco's door is ajar, and it softly creaks as Harry pads in, blindly heading to the bed Draco is resting upon. The other boy is on his back, hands locked and perfectly resting on his stomach upon his blanket.
"How is the trembling,” Severus asks, eyes flicking over Harry's hands, which Draco hasn't seen still even once since coming back from Malfoy Manor, “Has it lessened?"
"And you've thought this through?" He warns, because they're fifteen-year-olds, and there's a huge chance of them not thinking shit through properly, "The whole thing? Time, location, duration, each house's schedule--"
“Twinky,” Harry repeats, then, apparently satisfied, goes back to nibbling on his sandwich. Draco tries not thinking about the fact that the elf had already uttered her name at least twice while rambling. Harry is exhausted, he gets a leeway.
Footsteps. Harry tenses up even further. He stands up, and slowly walks over to the kitchen. They are coming from the backdoor. His feet barely make a sound on the floor.
Albus had relieved him of his duties as a spy; which just went to show how grave the entire ordeal was. Not that it needed any confirmation for Severus's sake. In fact, he might be one of the only people who would understand the delicacy, and sensitivity of this situation. This is running away from a broken dam, the surge of the flood.
"You could put it that way," Draco's shoulders straighten, his face taking on his usual expression. He cannot afford to show weakness to Potter, not twice in a row anyway.
“You and Draco were both injured, and I wasn’t available. Do you really think maintaining discretion should have been given priority if you just ended up killing yourselves?” Severus asks, raising an eyebrow in that deadpan way of his that always made Draco feel small.
Severus can hear a few people, from above,  but doesn’t let his body freeze in terror. He knows how to proceed if worse comes to worst and also, Lucius had promised him to keep everyone cleared. They also have the element of surprise.
"Draco, I always tell you everything." There’s a small mischievous smile creeping across his face when he holds Draco’s gaze.
"It's fine," Draco says quietly. There is a mounting degree of terror, that he feels whenever Harry forgets something, because the truth is, most of the time, Draco can’t tell whether it’s a Harry thing, or the curse being at play. He just doesn’t know, and it’s that uncertainty that is driving him insane.

Evan rolls his eyes, "Run my mouth to the mice running in the walls?" His face hardens, "He's being paranoid."
“What are you doing here?” she comes swooping out of one of the stalls, hovering over his head. Harry wonders how offended she’d be if he stuck his hand through her, but the ice-cold would feel so good against his aching hand.
"Don't thank me, Potter. I don't owe you anything, and you don't owe me anything. I'm blackmailing you. At least try sounding like you're miserable."
Then he had rolled the parchment into an extremely thin roll, shrunk it to the size of his thumb and then slid it into the open nook of the golden quill. Sufficiently hidden out of sight.
“You filthy blood traitor!” Rosier yells, a trickle of blood trailing down his mouth as he makes a slashing motion with his wand. Lucius levitates a chair in front of him, which breaks down in half.
He has to steady himself against the wall as he starts walking, and his hand actually does leave a bloody trail of crimson droplets on the stone floors as he walks. Gritting his teeth, he clenches it into a fist, wrapping his scarf around it. At least with magic, he’d be able to get out the bloodstains. He takes care of his macabre trail as well.
"It doesn't matter." Potter is still trying to pull his hand away, although his attempts are now half-hearted at best.
Cold is great, because cold hurts now. He rubs his thumb lightly against Harry’s hand, wishing that he could will away the pain. The sweater Harry is wearing is still damp with blood and unlikely to keep the November chill out.
Harry throws a confused glance at his direction, before his eyes clear with realisation, he turns back to the eggs, “Oh yeah, Snape gave them to me the other day.”
It doesn't. It's not, and that's infuriating enough on itself. Draco has no abstract concept of a single thing that goes through Harry's mind, and like an insisting itch on the back of his neck, Draco has the strongest urge to delve and immerse himself in the mystery. He needs a key to Harry Potter.
"Are you sure this fits our budget?" Harry says slowly, just for Draco's ears to hear, and the blond squeezes his hand.
So he keeps lying there on the cold hard ground, his eyes almost determinedly stitched to Harry's face. It has a very enigmatic and calming effect on him, and Draco can blissfully tune out annoyingly persistent thoughts that plague his mind. He pays attention to Harry instead. To the smaller details, ones that people never get right on a first glance. Draco feels as if his entire relationship with Harry up until now has been nothing but a very long first glance.
Chapter warnings for; explicit language, referenced torture, implied/referenced car accidents, implied/referenced child abuse.
Draco looks out the window, "I can't believe 'Market Deeping is the name of an actual place," Draco mutters, as they pack up their meal and shoulder the bag.
Draco exchanges a glance between the water bottles and Harry's pale face, pale but dotted red from the cold.
Potter’s finger closes around the quill, and only a beat later, they’re pulled by their navels, disappearing on the spot once again.
Remus Lupin knows most people like the back of his hand. This isn't an exaggeration of any sort, nor a fib. Throughout the years, he's discovered that he can just look at a person and know things about them without having to ask. Ironically, much similar to a magic trick.
Almost as if readying himself for the impact, Harry closes his eyes, waits and then opens them again. No one pushes him. Even though he can feel Draco, this time the dizziness of disorientation or instability doesn’t grip him as he falls helplessly.
Finally closing the tap, Harry rummages around his backpack and comes up with a broken half of a quill, “It is,” he says, before quickly transfiguring the quill into a small piece of handkerchief.
Nott is about to cast another Cruciatus on the boy, his hand is raised and Severus quickly enters the cell, “Nott.”
*** the following will contain MAJOR spoilers as to what is about to happen in this story, proceed with caution***
It's over too quickly. Or maybe it just feels that way. He blinks away the darkness to the feel of Harry’s hand carding through his hair, murmuring unintelligibly.
He didn't set a finger on that brat. He didn't! He only tortured Potter three times, three times! All the while the boy danced under his spell, writhing and sobbing as pathetically as Evan is doing right now. It was Bella! She damaged him!
Aunt Petunia is nowhere to be seen as he quietly turns on the hose, washing his hands with the blessedly cool water, before splashing some of it on his face.
Wallwind nods, slowly, letting his curly hair subtly shift around his head. "Strong words with meaningful intent, Minister Fudge. This interview was a pleasure," he stands to shake the man's sugar powdered hands.
"But keep spiralling over the fact that my godson, Jamie's son, was captured and fucking tortured for days. Trying not to panic about what that bitch has done to him, with no response from him or Albus day after day. At least I can drink and worry myself to grave."
"Your father will be most displeased. That is, if he gets to live through the night. Bad blood… he seems plagued with it,"
"My ear isn't food, Hedwig," he distractedly runs his hand over her head and she hoots again, almost as if she's thinking of jumping into the fridge.
"Fuck you," Draco snaps, and surges forward. He takes Harry's startled face and closes the space between them, not for a kiss, but just for effect.
Myrtle, instead of replying, flies from his right to his left, leaning in closer to the basin. “What happened to you?”
How is this real? That's what he thinks, gazing up at the barn's ceiling, catching small peeks at the sky through the cracks.
"He laughed at my name!” He throws his hands up in exasperation, “Why are we even arguing about this?"
"Diffindo!" Draco flinches in surprise, and Umbridge jerks her hand back with a hiss. There is a long, red gash running from her wrist up to her elbow. Then his eyes flit towards the doorway, from where the voice had come, and Draco gapes.
When Draco touches him, or holds him, or even looks at him, he is sure of himself. It's always been this way, it doesn't have anything to do with them dating, anything with the kisses. It's just how Draco is.
Draco's tongue turns leaden in his mouth and he gasps for breath. This… is some sick joke. Because Harry can’t be gone. Except Harry wouldn’t be so cruel. Even if he doesn’t like Draco back, he'd never be so cruel.
"Are you alright?" Hermione asks and Harry hastily nods. Picking an apple on impulse. He takes a huge bite out of it despite nausea clearly sending the opposite message.
His bones are probably brittle from years of malnutrition though, so he doesn't know what Umbridge could do with them. He just shrugs. And then winces. The pain has started flaring up not only in his hand but up to his whole arm. It's dull and ignorable. But present. He can't explain it. For a moment he contemplates telling Malfoy, but then decides against it. They're ending their meetings today. He's ripping that imaginary band-aid off, not confiding in it.
"Of course I have, my dear Minerva." The man sips on his tea and smiles at her softly, he gestures at the Professor to sit back down but Minerva just shakes her head at him.
Then he remembers that this is war and the man haughtily coughing in front of him has done way worse and yet leads the fighting force against the dark side. The world is twisted that way. His eyes flitter, and he can feel the stifling pressure in the room.
And then Harry starts looking uncertain too, "Aren't we friends?” he says, hesitant, “I thought that--"
Remus still sounds weary, but not frantic anymore, as he says, “I think we should all sit and calm down for a moment.”
It's fine. Harry hates that sentence, in fact, it's right up there in his list of passionately hateful things. Right at the top is 'Great ' closely followed by 'Dolores Umbridge' and 'Pink toads' and 'Squirming insects'. 'Fine' takes the fifth place, while being in no way less hated than the others by Harry.
A smirk curls across Rosier’s lips. “Bad seeds,” the man shrugs. “That should be it. The seeds of a traitor, the womb of a traitor… I mean there’s only so much you can hope for. CRUCIO!”
"He's barely five feet," Rosier turns to Draco once more, who has been subtly hinting his wand towards the man. "Potter and Malfoy's whelp. Treachery runs in their blood it seems,"
"Absolute mess, ain't it?" Murphy, his fellow Auror, says. Kingsley knows that he's on the brink of retirement. Not likely while this whole mess is going on.
"You're not going to get anywhere with combative spells with that posture. Also,” he points at her, “Hermione you might want to change into pants, we need to warm up and the skirt wouldn't be doing it for you."
Harry wakes up with rancid bile already in his mouth. Frantically pushing the covers away, he falls to the floor, and nearly crawls towards the bathroom. Disoriented, and still unfamiliar with the new place, he almost doesn’t reach there in time and expels his guts in the hallway. He scrambles into the bathroom and retches in the dark, holding onto the toilet for dear life.
this. If Umbridge has infiltrated the Ministry into letting her interfere in Hogwarts then that means she and by proxy, the Dark Lord, have essentially infiltrated two of the most important wizarding organizations in Great Britain. He has outsmarted us. By far. Checkmate.”
But as he sees Bellatrix twirl her wand over him, as he sees him writhe, bending and twisting and clawing at the ground with cracked, bloody nails, mouth open in a silent scream, blood bubbling out of the corners, trickling down his face, Harry finds himself wishing to see the familiar blank face.
In this respect, Draco almost considers snapping his fingers in front of his eyes, just to see what would happen. But he's wary of whether it would do Potter any good. You weren't supposed to wake a sleepwalker.
Right before he enters the kitchen, though, he hears noises. He freezes. What time is it? Who else is awake at this time? Frowning, he steps closer, almost completely pressing his ear to the door. He can distinguish two voices, talking.
He's out of breath, so he stops himself, his eyes glazed and his face flushed. He had no idea he had been this mad. No idea at all. But it feels good to let it out, finally. He could never have done it with the Dursleys.
"Oh, don't even mention it, my curly-haired apprentice,” Sirius gives a grin, “So you want to be like me? A task many and many dreamers befall to and fail at."
"There won't be an attack but in the event that there is," he pauses for effect, "you two are to grab as many children as you can and head to the floos."
"No," he says, looking up at Harry's face with a frown, "Still too much for that. The cuts, however deep, shouldn't bleed so much. They aren't cutting into any major artery or vein."
Harry keeps staring at it for a second before getting to work; it wouldn’t do to give Umbridge another excuse to assign more detentions. He writes the first word,
Chapter Warnings for; Explicit language, explicit depiction of torture, violence, gore and explicit language.
He looks at the door, swallows harshly, and walks over to it barefoot. The chill of the floor is almost comforting.
He tilts his head to the side, “Really, Potter? Your love life is pretty much irredeemable at this point, no matter how many times you try that ritual.”
Tonks mumbles something under her breath but extends a finger to the inkwell in Harry's hand, Moody reaches for it as well, only Remus has yet to touch the Portkey.
"I know what he said," 'Tonks' cuts in irritably. "Just give the kid two seconds to process three strangers in his living room."
"If you cannot handle two teenage boys, then what must be said about the cause you serve to our Lord?"
They look quite normal, if not a bit tense. And maybe also a bit pale, but that could easily be the rainy weather.
"Well,’” Harry runs his fingers on Draco’s knees. “we have two hours, and all this compartment to ourselves,"
Draco stifles a shudder. He thanks Merlin every day that his godfather shows too many antisocial behaviors and straitlaced ruthlessness to bother and antagonize other people. Merlin knows how the suicide count would have risen if that weren't the case. Even Draco's father had less bite than Severus.
Almost unconsciously, he throws a glance at Umbridge, sitting in Dumbledore's place, sweetly sipping on her tea, and smiling down at the subdued students. It's a sinister smile, or so it seems as such in Harry's head. That woman had never looked like more of a toad than as of this moment.
Before he can even twitch his wand, Rosier whips his own wand, ripping Draco's wand out of his clenched hand and flying into the air. Draco hisses as Rosier smirks in triumph. Nonverbal magic. Fuck.
*Due to our heavy schedules, and busy hours, the updates will be back to every alternate Saturday once more, terribly sorry for the wait. ;)
"We can make it that far." He says, without a grain of doubt in his voice, his hand is fucking shaking and probably cramping from the cold but he looks confident in his word. "Then we can find this Slugborn--"
Draco sneers. He cannot handle this level of irritation and cheek that Potter's throwing at him without
He doesn't pause as he strides towards the fireplace, grabs a fistful of floo powder and changes his teaching robes for the death eater garb. He takes a deep breath, as he does nearly every time before a mission. This might be his last.
"Okay…” He swallows, “Okay, I'm sure we can find someplace…" He squints out in the rain, unable to really see through the barrage of water.
"Yes, we know," Tonks cuts him off and then smiles at Harry. "Wotcher Harry," she says with a small smile, and Harry hesitantly nods back at her.
And now, now that safety is paramount, now that Potter is needed alive more than ever, the old fool orders him to
We are currently experimenting a little on update schedules, and update days, so the next update would be on a sunday instead of saturday. Sorry for the one day extra wait!
It's hilarious, the power Harry holds over his own pain. If it's inconvenient, it's not worth mentioning. Harry almost died from blood poisoning because of it.
She flinches at the name hard enough that her teacup rattles, sloshing the smallest amount of tea on her saucer. Umbridge's eyes narrow. "We are not speaking of his involvement. Black had a very distinguished role in getting your parents killed, wouldn't you say?"
Five words, sixteen letters, six vowels, and ten consonants are causing Harry much more pain than they ought to.
When the boy starts tipping over, Severus acts on instinct and catches him by his arms, but the boy cries out in pain and stumbles back. Severus winces, there is probably a lot of nerve damage if Bellatrix got her hands on him.
"What are you talking about?" He asks Sirius sharply. "Why is Harry here? Why shouldn't he be okay?” Harry turns to him with a confused frown. He wasn’t expecting Ron to be just as confused as he was, seeing that he was actually here with the adults. “Didn't Dumbledore say we're bringing him a week from now? What's going on?"
He clears his throat. "I met young Potter after the Third task, John. I have expressed my concern regarding the poor boy's health time and time again to Albus to no avail. Diggory's death was a tragic accident indeed, and young Harry seems to be the most affected by what transpired last year during the tournament."
Harry shakes his head, and Draco had already known that it wouldn’t be possible, but his heart still sinks when Harry says, "We don't have a budget for another set of tickets. We need to get to… um, jeez what was the name…"
“We can't leave any traces behind. The vestigo potion, he must have used your cloak.” Draco murmurs, and Harry nods, still confused but sated for now. While the shoe burns, Draco starts scourgifying as much blood from the tomb as he can.
Chapter warnings for; violence, pedicides/multiple child homicides, genocide, mentioned racism and elitism, explicit language, implied/referenced torture.
They have a routine now. Or, more accurately, Harry has a routine now, and Draco is unintentionally tangled and woven in the bizarre sequence of tasks the same way one might be in the tightly packed weave of a shawl. Sewn in and inseparable.
Draco shrugs with his good shoulder. "It doesn't hurt too much anymore." Now that's one upside to binging on pain potions, Severus's in particular, highly effective and rarely addictive. Draco still has no idea how the man does it.
'You were always bad at math. It wasn't a Dudley thing, remember? You didn't have to fake those grades.' Harry can hear Sirius perfectly clear, even over the sound of crashing waves.
Draco shouldn't be lying to Harry, but he will, because this is the right thing to do, and he knows exactly what Harry needs to hear right now. And also the pain is killing him.
“Portus!” He hisses and then instead of dragging Potter, crouches by the boys, wordlessly holding out the golden feather and grasping Draco’s uninjured shoulder in a tight unflinching grasp with his other hand.
Mrs. Malfoy had it cast on her so many times. He wouldn't wish it on anyone. Well, maybe Bellatrix. And Voldemort.
Seeing him reduced to a terrified wreck, begging the invisible phantoms of his past life looming over him had been a jarring, eye-opening lesson. Severus banishes the memories behind strong occlumency shields, and gets into professional mode. He needs to help Albus right now, not dwell on his mortality.
"You got a kick out of bullying me?” Harry’s eyebrows shoot up but the grin stays in place, “Nice to know."
Harry looks all bloody but Draco can’t find any new injuries on him. Draco’s on the cold, muddy ground, face buried in his uninjured arm as he tries to breathe through the pain.
Harry is gaping as he looks at her, and then Ron, who looks kind of greyish, and Sirius, who looks like he wants to grab him again.
There are no more cooking incidents, and Draco grudgingly admits that Harry's cooking is a pleasant surprise in the sea of one bleak fiasco after the other. They have breakfast, Harry changes Draco's bandages after he's showered, and then goes to take a shower himself. He's out in less than seven minutes, his hair a right dripping mess and his clothes clinging to his body in a way that suggests he hadn't dried himself adequately.
“Well to be fair, we’re not exactly in top-notch condition. I’ll give you a pass for cooking for now.”
With a small sigh, Harry drops the pillow next to Draco's and folds himself on the bed, burying his face in his aching forearms with a small gap remaining open in between where he peeks at Draco, lying perfectly still and poised, arrogantly graceful, even in sleep.
They share the rest of the bag of crisps Harry found in the train station the day prior, and use it as an excuse to walk shoulder to shoulder, pretending they were fine. Pretending this was just an outing and not a desperate attempt to escape.
"What if it's a trap?" Potter asks but is following him out of the cell, nonetheless. Staggering, but more or less upright.
"You should try it, Severus," Draco continues, nodding his chin at Severus's plate. Harry's fork does a sharp screech against the china as his hand starts seizing, he lets go of the fork and fists the hand on his knee. Draco doesn't respond but Snape's eyes swiftly shift to Harry's.
"My guilt just magically disappeared," he says, and there’s a bit of ice cream smudged on his lips. If they weren’t in such a public place, Draco would’ve kissed and licked and sucked it off his lips. He clears his throat and crams his spoon in his mouth.
“Severus,” Draco turns to him, his eyes narrowed. Severus reads the silent question without missing a beat. ‘Are we getting out alive?’
It cannot be the torture. Draco knows better than that. He just fed Potter, they exchanged words and he seemed sane enough. Besides, Draco has seen people who had gone mad due to the Cruciatus curse. Their eyes are never void of any emotions, they're overfilled with a conflicting abundance of them. Too much for anyone to handle, and the truth is, they don't. That's why they're called insane.
"Listen to me, there is no time." She grips his shoulders, with the hands of a killer, "Rosier used the vestigo potion to track down Potter, and kidnapped him. I destroyed the source text so it will not be repeated again. I need you to listen to me." Her grip tightens on his shoulder, and he winces.
Harry remembers that night. He remembers how he’d slipped off his stool whilst making dinner,  hitting his head to the sharp corner of the counter, he remembers Petunia's livid face as she’d dragged him by the arm, out of the kitchen, through the hallway, past his cupboard, to the door.
"From butcher to watchdog?" He says, his hair flicks as he tilts his head, his eyes catch a tiny glimpse of Potter's torn rob wrapped around his wrist. It's such a cherished part of him now.
"I haven't brewed it or the poison in more than five years. It won't take long to prepare." He turns to Draco once more. "You have been treating it with the vials you took from my office, yes? The usual?"
"Let me see them," he says, looking at the hands Harry’s trying to hide. The bag falls off his shoulder with a subdued plop on the carpet. The same brown as the hallway.
Harry also has pretty serious self image issues regarding being viewed as normal, and while Ron and Hermione have created a 'system' around Harry, they knew that maintaining said system, whilst also trying not to make Harry aware of it, Is not an easy thing to do, and in the moment, their frustration got the better of them.
"You have no idea--" Rosier huffs in his ear, lets go of his hair and hooks an arm around Harry's waist, "No fucking idea how long I waited for this moment."
Hedwig settles on his shoulder and they venture downstairs, Harry fixes his glasses, his jaw tensing with a wide, eye-watering yawn. Last night wasn't pleasant. Not Mrs. Malfoy's level of gore, but the Cedric dreams were back. He doesn't know if it was better or worse.
Everyone, please pay attention to the warnings. They’re important and put there for your benefit, we don't want to hurt anyone, do not take any of them lightly.
While they wait, Harry dabs the wound clean with dittany. He's right, it's a really open wound. Almost gaping. Draco has no idea how his whole arm is still attached to his body.
“Twinky I need your help,” Harry furiously whispers as he quietly crawls his way to the timid house elf. “Draco, your master-"
The man yanks his arm away and shoves up his robe sleeve, showing him a smooth, markless forearm, Harry can see it's unblemished even with his impaired vision. "I'm not a damned Death Eater," the man grits out. "Now cooperate unless you want to get your soul sucked out," he doesn't wait for a response as he starts dragging Harry away again, like a disobedient child throwing a tantrum.
Draco can barely feel the burning of the shell around his wrist over the adrenaline rush of panic. There are pots and pans banging in his head, a steady litany of screams that sound too much like Harry’s. Screaming in pain, screaming his name.
We all know that this year was a rough one, we were constantly tested and challenged and put through the wringer, but we still had the good moments. For us, those were whenever we got a comment or kudos from you all! And now here we are, and the year is over! Finally over. Things are about to look up again. New year, new life.
He wants to rest his eyes as well, but he doesn't. The store being empty now doesn't mean that they're safe in any way, and besides, he's too busy rubbing his hand over Harry's arm to expedite the warming up process.
Evan wants her to be that still when his hands are wrapped around her throat, pressing, choking the life out of her, watching the veins pop in her eyes.
He gurgles a fistful of water a few times, and mourns the lack of his toothbrush before trudging out of the bathroom into the corridor, and just stands there, aimlessly staring at his feet as subtle tremors run through his body. He grips his forearms in an almost bruising grip, trying to steady his hands just a little. He also knows it’s futile.
"What about the pain relievers? Are they burning out faster than usual as well? A typical dose can last about five hours," Severus asks.
"Oh, I will be on time," Harry promises with the same smile that painfully stretches his face and then turns, his face dropping into a glare as he picks up his bag and heads for the door.
He wished he knew the hidden meaning behind those words before he came to know why she would make him promise such a thing.
John lets the words float over him in the tensed air of the office before inclining his head. "Are you indicating that these claims are untrue?" He makes each word count, he has to, in his line of work.
Kingsley rolls his eyes and signs the bottom of the parchment, reaching for another as he rolls this one. "Work on it harder," he tells Tonks, passing her cluttered desk in a flurry to get to the stack of closed cases. "Robert? Where is yours? " he asks the room as his eyes don't pin down Robert immediately.
His knuckles have turned white from his grip on the wand. It's not dementors, at least, he knows that. There's no chill in the air to indicate that. Besides… Dementors don't have wands.
They need to get as far away from here as possible. And Tattershall… he still doesn’t know where they really are. If he wants to go to Slughorn’s at Tattershall, they need to start somewhere they know.
"It's also fresh," he puts it inside the bag, then looks at Draco. He must have noticed the sharp sting in his eyes because he drops his trembling hand and walks up to him, touches Draco's face with his other, clean hand. "The garbage they put out is dry, just wrapping papers, and...and tissues and stuff okay? It looks clean. If we don't eat now…"
Sirius dashes out of his chair, chocolate still in his hand, and Tonks is profusely apologizing over the yelling and rambling on about a broken vase, Remus calmly gets up from his own chair to help and they all wait, just staring at each other as the screaming continues in the background.
"Hey, aren't they joining us?" Harry asks, craning his neck to glance at them over his shoulder whilst trying to match Remus's brisk pace. Lupin doesn't stop but extends a hand to Hedwig's cage in a silent offer to take it from Harry.
He sighs in relief as Number four Privet Drive comes into his view, and the man looks almost as relieved. As soon as they're near the porch the man shoves Harry into the yard with a stern glare, his wand lighting at the end in his other hand.
It's a miracle when she pauses, and Draco can see her black eyes, fractionally softening, "I'm sorry for your parents, truly. This is what I owed to them," she exhales, "Go."
"Take a pain reliever. Another," Harry pulls the bag between them, lips pursed into an invisible line.
“Please, Harry,” Draco whispers as he lowers him back down to the floor, where Harry sits leaning against a damp wall. His fingers clutch at Draco’s sweater for a few seconds before he loosens his white-knuckled grip reluctantly.
Then Harry sighs, and Draco can literally feel him shrinking with his eyes closed. He didn't mean that, he didn't mean it like that.
Lucius’ smile doesn’t falter, even as he takes in Draco’s appearance. He steps forward and Draco flinches, it makes Lucius pause. Severus notices Potter tensing up where he is leaning against the wall.
Happy birthday to our dear Harry, and anyone born on July 31st! We thought you guys deserved a little treat!
Draco stares at Harry. The boy sitting in front of him is so different from the one who’d been his archnemesis in school for over four years. The one he used to bully and the one who used to give back as good as he got. Most people wouldn’t dare stand up to him, a Malfoy.
"Draco," Harry’s voice is quiet, subdued. Draco glances at him, they’re huddled together under the meagre shed over the bus stop. The rain hammering against the thin roof is loud enough to drown out most thought. Draco has to strain to hear Harry’s voice. They’ve been here for hours.
Severus doesn't let his thoughts regarding Potter sink deeper in his mind. Doesn't let the thought of permanent damage, and singed nerve endings and the ambiguity of the boy's mental state hinder his detailed, very, prominently time oriented plan. They need to leave. Now.
There's silence once more and neither Draco nor Severus are obliged to break it. They are both very much aware of the Dragon in the room. Possibly a very dead one. The miasma of it is almost stifling, and has no place in the brightly lit kitchen.
"Let's go rest there," Draco points across the street, at the flickering, red neon letters spelling out the laundry store's name. Twenty-four seven. That means they won't be bothered.
His head whips around in the grey darkness, there’s no one except him here. Just sand and waves. His wet hair is mused by the chilly wind.
Draco snorts, and picks up the kettle from the stove with a rag. "Why not just throw us in a pit and let us fight it out then?" He says as Harry gently toes the birds out of the backdoor to the porch.
‘Oh, the nerve of this guy,’ Harry wholeheartedly agrees with Sirius, his horrified face no doubt reflecting Sirius's.
"I made plenty," he says and gets up to act on his passive threat. He's more than sure that Severus Snape would regard it as such. In a way, Harry is getting exactly what he wanted.
"You did,” Ron says, and then rummages around his trunk for a moment and thinks that perhaps he can spare two chocolate frogs and tosses one to harry, who catches it on instinct, “You still do. Come on, I know you better than that. It's alright, they were really bloody awful people. Eat that."
"Stop arguing, you guys," Harry says and heads for his trunk, but then changes his mind and heads for the bed instead, dropping down between his friends with a loud sigh.
Draco already doesn’t look like his best, and Harry doesn’t want to worry him by having a  meltdown worthy of a lunatic. ‘It’s not about the rooftop, there’s something wrong with
Draco stares at him and Harry looks right back at him in response, unblinking and unfazed by the longevity of their staring contest.
They are still wide open, unblinking, but this time in pure, withering terror. He's still on the ground, just like always. But he isn't
"Let me see your hand, Mr. Potter," she continues as Harry slowly gets up to his feet, his hand knuckle-white around the quill and his other hand drowned in blood. He walks up to her with a hidden grimace.
"Butcher gets fresh meat to chop," Evan snaps the book shut, even though it's nowhere near her line of sight, it's always better to be vigilant in her presence. "I'm spoiled meat, Valentina. He's having you gorging on spoils."
himself could dose Potter with anything at this moment and Potter wouldn’t be able to do a thing. He could easily deliver him to the dark lord, be done with it, have his father back, his home, his everything.
Honestly, at this point, he’s just relieved that Harry hasn’t… gone away in a while. This morning was scary. While he could handle these episodes from him in the safety of Shell Cottage, they couldn’t afford to be distracted here.
Draco feels nauseated, and not at all ready for what's about to come. He's going to burn his flesh close. On two vials of pain relievers.
"I don't want your lavish spendings, Malfoy. This is nice. Thank you for buying me ice cream with stolen money."
"I might even forgive you for your shortcomings," Voldemort continues, caressing the end of Nagini's tail.
The very small ridge on Harry's nose, right beneath his eyes where a lifetime of glasses have left their mark, just a small, tiny red dent, the curve of Harry's ear as it melds into his jaw, and the very small, almost unnoticeable scar under his chin, white and camouflaged into the skin. Then he looks at the real scar, the famous, lightning shaped scab. It's red and irritated. As if it has been recently carved by a knife, like the words on his hand.
And then the hand goes slack, the pressure lifts from his throat, potentially the only thing holding him upright at all, and gravity pulls him down. He falls several feet to the ground, disoriented, feeling as if some of his soul is still out of his body, not quite
"It’s just...we're not going back, ever." Draco nods weakly in agreement. He's too deflated, too worn out. His face is sticky with dried tears, and his throat is raw, "and I didn't pack us--"
Friendly chat. Harry would rather throw himself off his rooftop than imagine having a friendly chat with this woman of all people. But he is in no position to object to what is clearly an order. Hesitantly, he puts his quill down, trying his best to ignore the throbbing in his hand. He cannot wait until he can plunge it down the Murtlap Essence when he's done here.
"You know how I've never asked anything of you before?" He asks the apathetic man lounging on the couch, his hair unkempt and his tattooed chest bare under his blue sleeping robe.
Umbridge huffs, and clenches her wand tighter. "One of them happened to be Potter," She glares down at Potter's unmoving body. Rosier raises an eyebrow.
She gives him a smile, which is probably meant to look grim, but just comes across as gleeful and sadistic, and Draco braces himself. If
"Alright. Thank you, Headmistress." Harry quietly picks his bag, and sneaks a glance down at Malfoy, still on the ground.
Narcissa Malfoy, Severus thinks, was one of the fiercest, most graceful women he had ever known, even coming as far as showing up Lily Potter, his former best friend. All that beauty and grace and she had been reduced to
"You should be proud to even breathe in this sacred soil," Rosier slashes Harry's wand and he can feel a deep cut etching itself on his arm. Harry curses.
me finding it. Only the wrapper touched the garbage can. It looks clean, it smells fine. Do you want me to try first?"
"I should hope so," Fudge says with a pointless chuckle as he twirls his own quill in one hand, his small beady eyes size John as if he's a dress robe, put behind a glass for sale. John Wallwind steadily holds Fudge's gaze, for nearly half a minute before he starts.
He half-expected them to be lying unconscious in a puddle somewhere until he bled to death, or the Ministry, or Death Eaters, found them. But here they are.
"Shut up woman!" Sirius hollers back at her and seizes the curtains, almost wrenching them off their hanging place as he draws them together. It's silent again. Harry glares at a salt shaker, which is upturned and spilling salt on the table, refusing to acknowledge Ron and Hermione's beseeching glances.
Draco heaves a sigh before moving his hands to unbutton his shirt, shuddering slightly. But when he moves to open it, it doesn’t move. Breath hitching, he pulls a little harder, wincing when the shirt is stuck to his wounds, and then gasping when the wince catches on the cut at his cheek.
He lets out a small groan, and tries to roll over to his side, or at least his back to alleviate the burning in his chest. Or face. At this point, he cannot tell which is worse. He gingerly touches his cheek, then cringes at the dried blood there, scabbed over a long wound that runs down to his chin. It hadn’t stopped bleeding long into the night. Or morning. Draco doesn't quite know. He just knows that sometime into the painful haze that clouded his vision, the sluggish moving of the blood had given into dried flecks of irritation on his skin. Painful irritation. Harry hadn't dared touch those again last night. Or Draco thinks that's the case. He wasn't paying attention.
Harry doesn't turn, his shadow moves, but he doesn't react to having his name called. The panic that had left him at spotting Harry is starting to return.
Severus unwraps the bandages manually, and Draco opens his mouth, but Severus cuts him off, “I’d rather avoid magic as much as possible.”
Harry regards the small, clear stream and then kneels to run a careful hand into the trickle. It’s cool against his fingers, and just by staring at it, Harry can tell that it’s the cleanest, most purified water he has ever seen.
It strikes Severus once more, how young Potter is in the face of something like this. The boy is embarrassed of being tortured. Of surviving Bellatrix Lestrange. He's just a boy.
"No Hermione, no shenanigans. Just keep your heads down for now, and Harry will be back." They drop their heads, "I promise. Besides you're going to be doing a lot of good with this new project, I'll talk to Sirius about it, and you should start putting this binder to use."
He flips the diary open, his fingers tracing random pages as he tries to remember where he left off last. Albus Dumbledore, whilst very organized with the sequence of events, was not as neat when it came to writing down said sequences.
"Yes, I haven't seen them in so long, I miss them, and I'm sure they're going bonkers over the fact that I'm missing. With the attack and all…" Harry trails off.
It has to be a curse. Jinxes don't carry enough force to propel that kind of reaction without a jinxed object nearby, and Draco searched Harry several times last night as thoroughly as he dared.
“Well, let me highlight it for you anyway,” Draco starts, straightening up slightly, as if to increase the weight of his words, “It means that there is
Remus does know that. And he is more than sure that the repercussions of their plan will be much worse without supervision.
"I'll run your blood over his coffin in respect. After all, he is being awfully magnanimous for letting me have my fun here," he lets the curse up for a moment, then it's back again. Like a dripping tap, the intermittent pauses are annoying Harry to bits.
Sirius wiggles his eyebrows with an impatient huff. "So? Chop chop! Go do your thing,” he waves his hand, “Also someone bring me a pepper up from the kitchen."
Harry, by Draco's insistence for some reason, takes the window seat. They're somewhere in the middle row. The bus is semi-filled, it should be about forty minutes from here to Spalding.
"Protect them?" He suggests although he is still a bit baffled as to how two fifteen-year-olds would be able to get into enough trouble that warrants babysitting.
"That would be adequate," Severus easily replies and turns back to Draco. "Shall we head to the living room?"
"Have you memorized it?" Remus asks as Harry passes the note back to him, and he nods, pushing the questions under the surface once again. He slightly flinches as Remus sets the note on fire with his wand.
He waves his hand at John as if he had just told him a funny joke, "Of course this is the work of a Death Eater, sir," the tone is ridiculously condescending. "I have had reports of the mark myself. But there's no reason to chalk this up as an organized attack."
This work does NOT undermine or question the difficulty people go through when depressed,  having a difficult time, or feeling suicidal. We are trying our HARDEST to handle this delicate matter with the grace it deserves.
This was the worst plan Albus had ever had, and that included keeping Potter and Draco in isolation after they’d been through a traumatic event.
But the sound that erupts from his throat is not his own. It's feminine and Harry recognizes it before he can finish his half-formed thoughts, incoherent and loud.
"You'll pay." He promises as he walks away, hands back in his pockets and his steps fading further and further away.
He's not scared of her. Not really, not more than anyone else in this fucking place. Evan has forgotten fear. Fear meant nothing in the presence of pain. And of pain, there was an abundance of at the moment.
Draco, despite his simmering rage, is quite content to leave Potter to have his laugh over him, this is entirely his loss, Draco loses nothing by Potter bleeding to death in an abandoned corner, in fact, it might even help his cause by alleviating the pressure of housing the dark lord in his home.
“We’re not fine, Twinky,” Draco says, exhausted as well. He needs a lifetime of sleep to get over the weariness in his bones. A lifetime of sleep… well, technically he is going to get that in two days. Draco hopes that death would have some semblance of peace in it. “But thanks for asking,”
Severus isn’t completely sure, but Potter doesn’t need to know that. “I’ll treat him now, and then return with more supplies later. I do not know when that would be, and I cannot stay long for now. So until then, you’re responsible for him.”
“Put exactly seven drops of this in two cupfuls of water and soak a cloth in it. Apply it to his wound every three hours, change his bandages as soon as they soak through, and give him half a vial of fever reducing potion if his fever spikes up again, he’s stable now. Do you understand me Potter?” he starts working on disinfecting the claw cuts on his torso and face.
, as Bellatrix Lestrange, deranged and unstable, cursed and tore the other woman. Harry had sensed Snape passively standing by his side, and the Malfoy patriarch on the floor, restrained and staring at his knees with a fixed expression as the younger Malfoy thrashed in his bounds and called for his mother until his throat had been rendered raw.
Nevertheless, if Minerva hadn't been smart enough to act as shocked and enraged at him as she had, she would probably have been arrested too. As it is, Black managed to disappear before the aurors could gather their wits.
No. Harry feels tired, hungry, in pain, and quite simply more murderous than he has ever felt in his life. If she keeps this up, he might just go through with Imaginary Sirius's plan. Kill the bitch. Then dissolve the body in a potion or something. Maybe Snape would help him too, he certainly didn't seem to like her all that much either.
Draco had never seen anyone that way, and it's momentarily alarming. Potter is absent. He feels absent too. And Draco is intrigued, latched on, on what could possibly string Harry away from this cell, away from his body. Unconsciously, he scoots closer to him, waiting to see whether Potter's reflexes acknowledge Draco's proximity to him. They don't. And Draco keeps staring. He's peeved by it.
“What’re yuh doing?” Potter’s sharp but slightly slurring voice comes from behind him, where he is now on his hands and knees, trying to stand.
"I'm not in pain,” Harry explains, clenching and unclenching his fists, “I'm actually fine, it’s just the fuck… the trembling."
He is surprised to see Twinky still standing there, and looks at her, about to ask what’s she waiting for, when she asks, “How is you doing, Master Draco?”
His cheeks are flushed, and a small smile quirks his lips. His eyes are still worried, and the tears haven’t yet fully dried from either of their faces. His face is still close enough for Draco to be able to feel his warm breath on his face.
"The salve?" Draco asks, hating himself for it. He knows it won't really help, and he'd said as much. But the possibility of reducing the scarring even by a meager two percent was better than nothing.
"You don't sound too sure,” Draco laughs. “No, let me try again...hmm, Auror doesn't seem your type.” He cocks his head to the side, “A professor?"
Harry imitates the act with an invisible brush, dramatically dunking it into an also invisible bucket as his eyes shine with amusement. “And I dunked it into the paint bucket and started painting the windows," he laughs again, "Seriously? I just told you that the moon is moving away by itself and this is what you're intrigued about?
"Shall we get to it then?" John keeps his face carefully blank, pasted with an afterthought of pleasantness, he has chosen every word with care as to not aid the man in any way.
She strides forward, and Draco flinches, taking a step back. But she’s put her wand back in her sleeve and is now standing right in front of him. Draco digs his heels into the floor to keep from backtracking further.
No one talks during dinner, and Harry feels responsible for the uncomfortable glances and subdued dialogue around the table. He doesn't eat much either, even though he hasn't had anything to eat since that piece of toast that morning, and the chocolate bulks Sirius and Mrs. Weasley forced down his throat.
Harry arrives with a tiny piece of apple still lodged in his mouth, the only evidence left of the apple he had picked up from the Great Hall before he headed for the detention, he's missed lunch and really couldn't even stomach the thought of facing the toad on an empty stomach.
"You're fifteen," he says, more to himself than the duo, he presses the heels of his palms against his eyes.
"You can't touch them,” Val says, not sounding worried in the least. And Evan once again imagines her choking beneath his hands. It's his happy place right now. “Locked up in here, so stop ranting."
Draco doesn't reply, he's standing directly behind Harry's crouched form, and he's staring like a man dying of thirst. He's not a savage, he knows when to ogle people and when to avoid such an undignified habit, but he just cannot help it today. Not with Potter.
"I understand, sir."  Severus looks Potter in the eyes, staring until he is sure that the boy actually understood. Then huffing in satisfaction, he starts hauling Draco alongside.
"Oh Poppy, I could care less about that blasted thing." She whips her head to face Albus, her bun the image of a mangled mane around her face. "Fudge is discrediting you. And people are listening to him… can't you see what he's doing?"
"Do it," the pain relievers have helped reduce the pain a bit, but he still feels it numbing his entire arm.
His hands have seemingly gone numb, and he can't get a good grasp on his wand, but Umbridge is still speaking, "The Dark Lord would be most disappointed, Draco. He had such high hopes for you."
The water feels blessed on his tongue and throat and his mind too. Harry makes him drink half of the bottle against his vehement protests.
He knows he had good reasoning for what he did, that it saved Harry’s life. He shudders to think what would have happened to him if Draco hadn't found him as quickly as he did. Or left alone with Rosier and Valentina.
He turns around, pressing his back to the door, a small childish part of him hoping that it would give away under his scrawny body.
"All forgiven, and hopefully forgotten soon. So...you miss Granger and Weasley. Don't hit me, but how could you miss them?"
We’ve also made a playlist for My Safest Sound on Spotify. It has some of our favourite songs that remind us of Harry and Draco here. If anyone is interested,
All in all, we are trying our very best to raise awareness about serious issues, as realistically as possible, and we promise that your concerns will be addressed to the best of our abilities, especially as the story progresses.
The hallway is carpeted with a truly atrocious brown rug, and the walls are a hideous beige colour. There’s a lonely little table with a vase full of wilted flowers at one end. Draco can see, quite clearly, the way his parents would have turned their nose up at such an establishment. Only fit for the lowest of scums. For dregs and thieves and people who can’t afford even basic luxuries.
Draco uses her distraction and ducks his head and just as he had thought, his wand lies, innocuously under the desk, slightly out of his reach.
"Come on," instead of dragging him around like a ragdoll, the man puts a hand on Harry's shoulders and hurries him along towards the Dursleys house, the street lights cast long shadows of them on the sidewalk.
Severus grips the note and stares up at the ceiling, wishing it could give him some more answers. All of that pain and trouble and misery and death, and they still have the exact same amount of Horcruxes to find as before.
